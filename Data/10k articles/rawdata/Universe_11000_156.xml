[[Image:Asperities.svg|thumb|The top image shows asperities under no load. The bottom image depicts the same surface after applying a load.]]

In [[materials science]], '''asperity''', defined as "unevenness of surface, roughness, ruggedness" ([[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]], from the Latin ''asper''—"rough"), has implications (for example) in [[physics]] and [[seismology]]. Smooth surfaces, even those polished to a mirror finish, are not truly smooth on a microscopic scale. They are rough, with sharp, rough or rugged projections, termed "asperities". Surface asperities exist across multiple scales, often in a self affine or [[fractal]] geometry.&lt;ref name ="contmech"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Hanaor| first1=D. A. H.| last2=Gan| first2=Y.| last3=Einav| first3=I.| title= Contact mechanics of fractal surfaces by spline assisted discretisation| journal= International Journal of Solids and Structures| year=2015| volume=59| pages=121–131| url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020768315000323| doi=10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2015.01.021}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[fractal dimension]] of these structures has been correlated with the [[contact mechanics]] exhibited at an [[interface (chemistry)|interface]] in terms of [[friction]] and [[Normal contact stiffness | contact stiffness]].

When two macroscopically smooth surfaces come into contact, initially they only touch at a few of these asperity points. These cover only a very small portion of the surface area. [[Friction]] and [[wear]] originate at these points, and thus understanding their behavior becomes important when studying materials in contact. When the surfaces are subjected to a compressive load, the asperities deform through elastic and plastic modes, increasing the contact area between the two surfaces until the contact area is sufficient to support the load.

The relationship between frictional interactions and asperity geometry is complex and poorly understood. It has been reported that an increased roughness may under certain circumstances result in weaker frictional interactions while smoother surfaces may in fact exhibit high levels of friction owing to high levels of true contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Zappone| first1=B.| last2=Rosenberg| first2=K.J.| last3=Israelachvili| first3=J.| title= Role of nanometer roughness on the adhesion and friction of a rough polymer surface and a molecularly smooth mica surface| journal= Tribology Letters| year=2007| volume=26| pages=191–201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Archard equation]] provides a simplified model of asperity deformation when materials in contact are subject to a force. Due to the ubiquitous presence of deformable asperities in self affine hierarchical structures,&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19111">[[Bose–Einstein condensation]] can occur in [[quasiparticles]], particles that are effective descriptions of [[collective excitations]] in materials.  Some have integer spins and can be expected to obey Bose–Einstein statistics like traditional particles.  Conditions for condensation of various quasiparticles have been predicted and observed. The topic continues to be an active field of study.

== Properties ==
BECs form when low temperatures cause nearly all particles to occupy the lowest quantum state. Condensation of quasiparticles occurs in ultracold gases and materials. The lower masses of material quasiparticles relative to atoms lead to higher BEC temperatures.  An ideal Bose gas has a phase transitions when inter-particle spacing approaches the thermal De-Broglie wavelength: &lt;math&gt;k_B T =~ \hbar^2 n^{2/3}/M&lt;/math&gt;.  The critical concentration is then &lt;math&gt;N \propto (T/2 \pi)^3 u^{1/2} P / v \hbar^3&lt;/math&gt;, leading to a critical temperature: &lt;math&gt;T_c &lt; 32\pi^3 \hbar^6 V^2u_0P^2&lt;/math&gt;. The particles obey the Bose–Einstein distribution and all occupy the ground state:

The Bose gas can be considered in a harmonic trap, &lt;math&gt;V(r) = M \omega^2 /2&lt;/math&gt;, with the ground state occupancy fraction as a function of temperature:

: &lt;math&gt;f(0)  = \frac{N_0(t)} N = 1 - \left( \frac T {T_c} \right)^3&lt;/math&gt;

This can be achieved by cooling and magnetic or optical control of the system. Spectroscopy can detect shifts in peaks indicating thermodynamic phases with condensation.  Quasiparticle BEC can be superfluids. Signs of such states include spatial and temporal coherence and polarization changes. Observation for excitons in solids was seen in 2005 and for magnons in materials and polaritons in microcavities in 2006. Graphene is another important solid state system for studies of condensed matter including quasi particles; It's a 2D electron gas, similar to other thin films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Bose–Einstein condensation of excitons in bilayer electron systems|date = 9 December 2004|journal = Nature|accessdate = |doi = 10.1038/nature03081|pmid = 15592403|volume=432 |issue = 7018|pages=691–694|arxiv = cond-mat/0404113 |bibcode = 2004Natur.432..691E  | last1 = Eisenstein | first1 = JP | last2 = Macdonald | first2 = AH}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Bose–Einstein condensation and superfluidity of trapped polaritons in graphene and quantum wells embedded in a microcavity|date = 1 November 2010|journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A|accessdate = |doi = 10.1098/rsta.2010.0208|pmid = 21041225 |volume=368 |issue = 1932|pages=5459–82|bibcode = 2010RSPTA.368.5459B  | last1 = Berman | first1 = OL | last2 = Kezerashvili | first2 = RY | last3 = Lozovik | first3 = YE | last4 = Snoke | first4 = DW}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Excitons ==

[[Excitons]] are electron-hole pairs.  Similar to [[helium-4]] [[superfluidity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = London | first1 = F | year = 1938 | title = The &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;-Point of Liquid Helium and the Bose–Einstein Condensation | doi = 10.1038/141643a0 | journal = Nature | volume = 141 | issue = 3571 | bibcode=1938Natur.141..643L | pages=643–644}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;-point (2.17K);&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, A. (1920) Proc. Berlin Acad. Science&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kapiza | first1 = P | year = 1938 | title =  Viscosity of Liquid Helium below the λ-Point| doi = 10.1038/141074a0 | journal = Nature | volume = 141 | issue = 3558 | page=74|bibcode = 1938Natur.141...74K }}&lt;/ref&gt; a condensate was proposed by Böer et al. in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Blatt, J.M., K.W. Boer, and W. Brandt, (1962) Bose–Einstein Condensation of excitons, Phys. Rev. '''126.5''', 1691&lt;/ref&gt; Experimental phenomenon were predicted leading to various pulsed laser searches that failed to produce evidence.  Signs were first seen by Fuzukawa et al. in 1990, but definite detection was published later in the 2000s. Condensed excitons are a [[superfluid]] and will not interact with phonons. While the normal exciton absorption is broadened by phonons, in the superfluid absorption degenerates to a line.

=== Theory ===
Excitions results from photons exciting electrons creating holes, which are then attracted and can form bound states.  The 1s paraexciton and orthoexciton are possible. The 1s triplet spin state, 12.1meV below the degenerate orthoexciton states(lifetime ~ns), is decoupled and has a long lifetime to an optical decay.  Dilute gas densities (n~10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;) are possible, but paraexcition generation scales poorly, so significant heating occurs in creating high densities(10&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;) preventing BECs. Assuming a thermodynamic phase occurs when separation reaches the [[de Broglie wavelength]](&lt;math&gt;\lambda_{dB}&lt;/math&gt;) gives:

: {{NumBlk||&lt;math&gt;n^{1/3} = \hbar^{-1}(m_\text{eff} kT_{cr})^{1/2} \longrightarrow T_c =  \frac{n^{2/3} \hbar^2}{k m_\text{eff}} &lt;/math&gt;|}}

Where, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the exciton density, effective mass(of electron mass order) &lt;math&gt;m_\text{eff}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; are the Planck and Boltzmann constants.  Density depends on the optical generation &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; and lifetime as: &lt;math&gt;n = g\tau&lt;/math&gt;. Tuned lasers create excitons which efficiently self-annihilate at a rate: &lt;math&gt;dn/dt = -an^2&lt;/math&gt;, preventing a high density paraexciton BEC.&lt;ref name="Heinrich Stolz 105007"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = New Journal of Physics|last = Heinrich Stolz|year = 1050|journal = New Journal of Physics|accessdate = |pmid = |display-authors=etal|doi=10.1088/1367-2630/14/10/105007 |volume=14 |issue = 10|pages=105007|arxiv = 1206.7029 |bibcode = 2012NJPh...14j5007S }}&lt;/ref&gt; A potential well limits diffusion, damps exciton decay, and lowers the critical number, yielding an improved critical temperature versus the ''T''&lt;sup&gt;3/2&lt;/sup&gt; scaling of free particles:

: &lt;math&gt;N_c = \zeta(3) \left( \frac{kT}{\hbar \omega} \right)^3&lt;/math&gt;

=== Experiments ===
In an ultrapure Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O crystal: &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; = 10s. For an achievable T = 0.01K, a manageable optical pumping rate of 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;/s should produce a condensate.&lt;ref&gt;Aurora, C.P. (2001) Thermodynamics, McGraw-Hill&lt;/ref&gt;  More detailed calculations by J. Keldysh&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keldysh | first1 = L.V. | year = 1964 | title =  | url = | journal = Eksp.

Helium cooling allows miili-kelvin setups and continuous wave optics improves on pulsed searches.  Relaxation explosion of a condensate at lattice temperature 354 mK was seen by Yoshioka et al. in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Transition to a Bose–Einstein condensate and relaxation explosion of excitons at sub-Kelvin temperatures|date = May 31, 2011|journal = Nature Communications|accessdate = |doi = 10.1038/ncomms1335|pmid = |arxiv = 1008.2431 |bibcode = 2011NatCo...2E.328Y |volume=2 |issue = 328|page=328|last1 = Yoshioka|first1 = Kosuke|last2 = Chae|first2 = Eunmi|last3 = Kuwata-Gonokami|first3 = Makoto}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent experiments by Stolz et al. using a potential trap have given more evidence at ultralow temperature 37 mK.&lt;ref name="Heinrich Stolz 105007"/&gt;  In a parabolic trap with exciton temperature 200 mK and lifetime broadened to 650ns, the dependence of luminescence on laser intensity has a kink which indicates condensation. The theory of a Bose gas is extended to a mean field interacting gas by a Bogoliubov approach to predict the exciton spectrum; The kink is considered a sign of transition to BEC.  Signs were seen for a dense gas BEC in a GaAs quantum well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Evidence for a Bose–Einstein condensate of excitons|date = July 2014|journal = EPL |volume=107 |issue = 1|pages=10012|accessdate = |doi = 10.1209/0295-5075/107/10012|pmid = |arxiv = 1304.4101 |bibcode = 2014EL....10710012A |last1 = Alloing|first1 = Mathieu|last2 = Beian|first2 = Mussie|last3 = Lewenstein|first3 = Maciej|last4 = Fuster|first4 = David|last5 = González|first5 = Yolanda|last6 = González|first6 = Luisa|last7 = Combescot|first7 = Roland|last8 = Combescot|first8 = Monique|last9 = Dubin|first9 = François|citeseerx = 10.1.1.771.3531}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Magnons ==
[[Magnon]]s, electron spin waves, can be controlled by a magnetic field.  Densities from the limit of a dilute gas to a strongly interacting Bose liquid are possible. Magnetic ordering is the analog of superfluidity.  The condensate appears as the emission of monochromatic microwaves, which are tunable with the applied magnetic field.

In 1999 condensation was demonstrated in antiferromagnetic [[Thallium|Tl]][[Copper|Cu]][[Chlorine|Cl]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first = T.|last = Nikuni|title = Bose–Einstein Condensation of Dilute Magnons in TlCuCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;|journal = Physical Review Letters|volume = 84|year = 1999|doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.84.5868|last2 = Oshikawa|first2 = M.|last3 = Oosawa|first3 = A.|last4 = Tanaka|first4 = H.|pmid = 10991075|issue = 25|bibcode = 2000PhRvL..84.5868N|arxiv = cond-mat/9908118|pages = 5868–71}}
&lt;/ref&gt; at temperatures as large as 14 K. The high transition temperature (relative to atomic gases) is due to the small mass (near an electron) and greater density. In 2006, condensation in a [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] Yttrium-iron-garnet thin film was seen even at room temperature&lt;ref name="dem"&gt;{{cite journal |first = S.O.|last = Demokritov|title = Bose–Einstein condensation of quasi-equilibrium magnons at room temperature under pumping|journal = Nature|volume = 443|pages = 430–433|year = 2006|doi = 10.1038/nature05117|pmid = 17006509|last2 = Demidov|first2 = VE|last3 = Dzyapko|first3 = O|last4 = Melkov|first4 = GA|last5 = Serga|first5 = AA|last6 = Hillebrands|first6 = B|last7 = Slavin|first7 = AN|issue = 7110|bibcode = 2006Natur.443..430D}}

'''Ducati Energia SpA''' is an [[Italy|Italian]] company based in [[Bologna]], part of the [[Ducati (company)|Ducati]] group, which produces electrical and electronic components.

It was founded in 1926 by the Ducati brothers, Adriano, Marcello and Bruno, to produce vacuum tubes, capacitors and other radio components.  The original Ducati company was called ''Società Scientifica Radio Brevetti Ducati''.

In 1935 Ducati became successful enough to enable construction of a new factory in the Borgo Panigale area of the city.

In the late 1940s Ducati began producing engines for bicycles and later motorcycles, leading to the later split into two companies: [[Ducati|Ducati Meccanica]] and Ducati Elettrotecnica.  The former specializing in the manufacture of motorcycles and the latter for radios and electrical devices and components.

Ducati Elettrotecnica was renamed Ducati Energia in the 1980s. It designs and produces a wide range of electronic components and subsystems for use in automotive, construction, security, and transmission and distribution (T&amp;D) energy efficiency.

It has a presence in many countries in Europe, Middle East, Asia, Africa and Latin America.

'''Earth mass''' ({{Earth mass}}, where ⊕ is the standard [[astronomical symbol]] for planet [[Earth]]) is the unit of [[mass]] equal to that of Earth. 
The current best estimate for Earth mass is {{math|{{Earth mass}} {{=}} {{val|5.9722|e=24|u=kg}}}}, with a [[standard uncertainty]] of 
{{val|6|e=20|u=kg}} (relative uncertainty 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;4&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name="AA"&gt;"[http://asa.usno.navy.mil/static/files/2016/Astronomical_Constants_2016.pdf 2016 Selected Astronomical Constants]" in {{citation | title = The Astronomical Almanac Online | url = http://asa.usno.navy.mil/ | publisher = [[United States Naval Observatory|USNO]]–[[United Kingdom Hydrographic Office|UKHO]]}}.

It is equivalent to an [[average density]] of {{val|5,515|u=kg⋅m&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

The Earth mass is a standard [[units of mass|unit of mass]] in [[astronomy]] that is used to indicate the masses of other [[planet]]s, including rocky [[terrestrial planet]]s and [[exoplanet]]s. One [[Solar mass]] is close to 333,000 Earth masses.
The Earth mass excludes the mass of the [[Moon]]. The mass of the Moon is about 1.2% of that of the Earth, so that the mass of the Earth+Moon system is close to {{val|6.0456|e=24|u=kg}}.

Most of the mass is accounted for by  [[iron]] and [[oxygen]] (c. 32% each), [[magnesium]] and [[silicon]] (c. 15% each), [[calcium]], [[aluminium]] and [[nickel]] (c. 1.5% each).

Precise measurement of the Earth mass is difficult, as it is equivalent to measuring the [[gravitational constant]], which is the fundamental [[physical constant]] known with least accuracy, due to the relative weakness of the [[gravitational force]].
The mass of the Earth was measured accurately in the [[Schiehallion experiment]] in the 1770s, and within 1% of the modern value in the [[Cavendish experiment]] of 1798.

== Unit of mass in astronomy==
{{see|Solar mass|Standard gravitational parameter|Gaussian gravitational constant}}
The mass of Earth is estimated to be:
:&lt;math&gt;M_\oplus=(5.9722\;\pm\;0.0006)\times10^{24}\;\mathrm{kg}&lt;/math&gt;,
which can be expressed in terms of [[solar mass]] as:
:&lt;math&gt;M_\oplus=\frac{1}{332\;946.0487\;\pm\;0.0007}\;\mathrm{M_\odot} \approx 3.003\times10^{-6}\;\mathrm{M_\odot} &lt;/math&gt;.

These methods are less precise than observations of artificial satellites.

The relative uncertainty of the geocentric gravitational constant is just  {{val|2|e=-9}}, however, {{Earth mass}} (the mass of the Earth in kilograms) can be found out only by dividing the ''G''{{Earth mass}} product by ''G'', and ''G'' is known only to a relative uncertainty of 
{{val|4|e=-5}} at best, so {{Earth mass}} will have the same uncertainty. 
For this reason and others, astronomers prefer to use the un-reduced ''G''{{Earth mass}} product, or mass ratios
(masses expressed in units of Earth mass or [[Solar mass]])  rather than mass in kilograms when referencing and comparing planetary objects.

== History of measurement ==
{{main|Gravitational_constant#History_of_measurement}}
[[File:Mendenhall gravimeter pendulums.jpg|thumb|Pendulums used in Mendenhall [[gravimeter]] apparatus, from 1897 scientific journal. The portable gravimeter developed in 1890 by [[Thomas Corwin Mendenhall|Thomas C. Mendenhall]] provided the most accurate relative measurements of the local gravitational field of the Earth.]]
The mass of Earth is measured indirectly by determining other quantities such as Earth's density, gravity, or gravitational constant.
The first measurement in the 1770s [[Schiehallion experiment]] resulted in a value about 20% too low.
The [[Cavendish experiment]] of 1798 found the correct value within 1%.
Uncertainty was reduced to about 0.2% by the 1890s,&lt;ref name="Poynting_p50-56"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Poynting|first=J.H.|title=The Earth: its shape, size, weight and spin|publisher=Cambridge|date=1913 |pages=50–56 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=whA9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA50}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
to 0.1% by 1930,&lt;ref&gt;P. R. Heyl, [https://archive.org/details/redeterminationo56124heyl A redetermination of the constant of gravitation], ''National Bureau of Standards Journal of Research''  5 (1930), 1243&amp;ndash;1290.&lt;/ref&gt;
and to 0.01% (10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;4&lt;/sup&gt;) by the 2000s.
The [[figure of the Earth]] has been known to better than four significant digits since the 1960s ([[World Geodetic System|WGS66]]), so that since that time, the uncertainty of the Earth mass is determined essentially by the uncertainty in measuring the [[gravitational constant]].

===Early estimates===
Before the direct measurement of the [[gravitational constant]],
estimates of the Earth mass were limited to estimating Earth's mean density from observation of the [[Crust (geology)|crust]] and estimates on Earth's volume. Estimates on the volume of the earth in the 17th century were based on a circumference estimate of 60 miles to the degree of latitude, corresponding to a radius of about 5,500&amp;nbsp;km, resulting in an estimated volume of about one third smaller than the correct value.&lt;ref name="Mackenzie2"&gt;Mackenzie, A. Stanley, ''[https://archive.org/stream/lawsgravitation01newtgoog#page/n6/mode/2up The laws of gravitation; memoirs by Newton, Bouguer and Cavendish, together with abstracts of other important memoirs]'', American Book Company (1900 [1899]), p. 2.
&lt;!--https://books.google.com/books?id=-3JkAAAAcAAJ&amp;hl=sl&amp;pg=RA3-PT186 
Zedler, Universal-Lexicon (1747) gives "26625660000 cubic miles" [2.66e+10] as the volume of the Earth
based on a diameter of 1720 miles. These are German miles, 1 mile = 7,532.5 m.
This corresponds to a radius of 6,478 km, overestimated by about 1.7%, for an overestimation of the volume by some 5%,
as "2.66e+9 cubic miles", but the volume calculation is off by a factor of ten, probably just an additional zero.
--&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
The average density of the Earth was not accurately known. Earth was assumed to consist either mostly of water ([[Neptunism]]) or mostly of [[igneous rock]] ([[Plutonism]]), both suggesting average densities too low by several orders of magnitude,
consistent with a total mass of the order of {{val|e=24|u=kg}}.
[[Isaac Newton]] estimated, without access to reliable measurement,  that the density of Earth would be five or six times as great as the density of water,&lt;ref&gt;"Sir Isaac Newton thought it probable, that the mean density of the earth might be five or six times as great as the density of water; and we have now found, by experiment, that it is very little less than what he had  thought it to be: so much justness was even in the surmises of this wonderful man!" Hutton (1778), p. 783&lt;/ref&gt; which is surprisingly accurate (the modern value is 5.515).
Newton under-estimated the Earth's volume by about 30%, so that his estimate would be roughly equivalent to {{val|4.2|0.5|e=24|u=kg}}.
 
In the 18th century, knowledge of  [[Newton's law of gravitation]] permitted indirect estimates on the mean density of the Earth, 
via estimates of (what in modern terminology is known as) the [[gravitational constant]].
Early estimates on the mean density of the Earth were made by observing  the slight deflection of a pendulum near a mountain, as in the [[Schiehallion experiment]].  Newton considered the experiment in ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'', but pessimistically concluded that the effect would be too small to be measurable.

An expedition from 1737 to 1740 by   [[Pierre Bouguer]] and [[Charles Marie de La Condamine]] attempted to determine the density of Earth by measuring the period of a pendulum (and therefore the strength of gravity) as a function of elevation.  The experiments were carried out in Ecuador and Peru, on [[Pichincha Volcano]] and mount [[Chimborazo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ferreiro|first=Larrie|title=Measure of the Earth: The Enlightenment Expedition that Reshaped Our World|year=2011|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-465-01723-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Bouguer wrote in a 1749 paper that they had been able to detect a deflection of 8&amp;nbsp;[[second of arc|seconds of arc]],
The accuracy was not enough for a definite estimate on the mean density of the Earth, but Bouguer stated that it was at least sufficient to prove that the Earth was not [[hollow Earth|hollow]].&lt;ref name="Poynting_p50-56"/&gt;

===Schiehallion experiment===
{{main|Schiehallion experiment}}
That a further attempt should be made on the experiment was proposed to the [[Royal Society]] in 1772 by [[Nevil Maskelyne]], [[Astronomer Royal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maskelyne|first=N.|date=1772|title=A proposal for measuring the attraction of some hill in this Kingdom |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|volume=65|pages=495–499 |bibcode=1775RSPT...65..495M|doi=10.1098/rstl.1775.0049 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested that the experiment would "do honour to the nation where it was made" and proposed [[Whernside]] in [[Yorkshire]], or the [[Blencathra]]-[[Skiddaw]] massif in [[Cumberland]] as suitable targets. The Royal Society formed the Committee of Attraction to consider the matter, appointing Maskelyne, [[Joseph Banks]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]] amongst its members.&lt;ref name="Danson_p115"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Danson|first=Edwin |title=Weighing the World |publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2006|pages=115–116|isbn=978-0-19-518169-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UNH_Y7ERFeoC&amp;pg=PA146}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee despatched the astronomer and surveyor [[Charles Mason]] to find a suitable mountain.

After a lengthy search over the summer of 1773, Mason reported that the best candidate was [[Schiehallion]], a peak in the central [[Scottish Highlands]].&lt;ref name="Danson_p115" /&gt; The mountain stood in isolation from any nearby hills, which would reduce their gravitational influence, and its symmetrical east–west ridge would simplify the calculations. Its steep northern and southern slopes would allow the experiment to be sited close to its [[centre of mass]], maximising the deflection effect.
[[Nevil Maskelyne]], [[Charles Hutton]] and [[Reuben Burrow]] performed the experiment, completed by 1776.
Hutton (1778) reported that the mean density of the Earth was estimated at 
&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{9}{5}&lt;/math&gt; that of Schiehallion mountain.&lt;ref name="Hutton"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hutton|first=C. |date=1778 |title=An Account of the Calculations Made from the Survey and Measures Taken at Schehallien |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society |volume=68 |doi=10.1098/rstl.1778.0034|issue=0 |url=http://rstl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/68/689.citation}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This corresponds to a mean density about 4{{frac|1|2}} higher than that of water (i.e., about {{val|4.5|u=g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}), about 20% below the modern value,  but still significantly larger than the mean density of normal rock, suggesting for the first time that the interior of the Earth might be substantially 
composed of metal.
Hutton estimated  this metallic portion to occupy some {{frac|20|31}} (or 65%) of the diameter of the Earth (modern value 55%).&lt;ref name=Hutton783&gt;Hutton (1778), p. 783.&lt;/ref&gt; 
With a value for the mean density of the Earth, Hutton was able to set some values to [[Jérôme Lalande]]'s planetary tables, which had previously only been able to express the densities of the major solar system objects in relative terms.&lt;ref name="Hutton" /&gt;

===Cavendish experiment===
{{main|Cavendish experiment}}
The [[Henry Cavendish]] (1798) was the first to attempt to measure the gravitational attraction between two bodies directly in the laboratory.
Earth's mass could be then found by combining two equations; [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law]], and [[Newton's law of universal gravitation#Modern form|Newton's law of universal gravitation]].

In modern notation, the mass of the Earth is derived from the [[gravitational constant]] and the mean [[Earth radius]] by
: &lt;math&gt; M_\oplus =\frac{ GM_\oplus}{ G } = \frac{ g R_\oplus^2}{G}.&lt;/math&gt;
Where "[[little g]]":
:&lt;math&gt;g = G\frac{M_\oplus}{R_\oplus^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

Cavendish found a mean density of {{val|5.45|u=g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}, about 1% below the modern value.

===19th century===
[[File:Room in Which Mr. Baily Weighed the Earth.jpg|thumb|Experimental setup by [[Francis Baily]] and [[Henry Foster (scientist)|Henry Foster]] to determine the density of Earth using the Cavendish method.]]

While the mass of the Earth is implied by stating the Earth's radius and density, it was not usual to state the absolute mass explicitly 
prior to the introduction of  [[scientific notation]] using [[Power of 10|powers of 10]] in the later 19th century, &lt;!--reference for this? no history in [[scientific notation]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=i-1MAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA404  this] suggests that it wasn't common in the 1860s.--&gt; 
because the absolute numbers would have been too awkward. Ritchie (1850) gives the mass of the [[Earth's atmosphere]] as "11,456,688,186,392,473,000 lbs."&lt;!--5,114,592,940,535,782 tons--&gt; ({{val|1.1|e=19|u=lb}} = {{val|5.0|e=18|u=kg}}, modern value is {{val|5.15|e=18|u=kg}}) and states that "compared with the weight of the globe this mighty sum dwindles to insignificance".&lt;ref&gt;
Archibald Tucker Ritchie, ''The Dynamical Theory of the Formation of the Earth'' vol. 2 (1850), Longman, Brown, Green and Longmans, 1850, [https://books.google.com/books?id=EGdDAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA280  p. 280].&lt;/ref&gt;

Absolute figures for the mass of the Earth are cited only beginning in the second half of the 19th century, mostly in popular rather than expert literature.
An early such figure was given as "14 [[1e24|quadrillion]] pounds" (''14 Quadrillionen Pfund'') [{{val|6.5|e=24|u=kg}}] in Masius (1859).
&lt;ref&gt;J.G.Mädler in: Masius, Hermann, ''Die gesammten Naturwissenschaften'', vol. 3 (1859), p. 562.
&lt;!--these are German pounds of 7680 German grains, here assuming the 1816 Prussian pound of  467.711 grams. see https://books.google.si/books?id=r0BEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA271 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Edmund Beckett, 1st Baron Grimthorpe|Beckett]] (1871) cites the "weight of the earth" as "5842 [[1e18|quintillion]] [[long ton|tons]]" [{{val|5.936|e=24|u=kg}}].&lt;ref&gt;
Edmund Beckett Baron Grimthorpe, ''Astronomy Without Mathematics'' (1871), p. 254.
Max Eyth, ''Der Kampf um die Cheopspyramide: Erster Band'' (1906), [https://books.google.com/books?id=VoE5DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA417  p. 417]
cites the "weight of the globe" (''Das Gewicht des Erdballs'') as "5273 quintillion tons".&lt;/ref&gt;
The "mass of the earth in gravitational measure" is stated as "9.81996×6370980&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;" in ''The New Volumes of the Encyclopaedia Britannica'' (Vol. 25, 1902) with a "logarithm of earth's mass" given as "14.600522" [{{val|3.98586|e=14}}]. This is the [[standard gravitational parameter|gravitational parameter]] in m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;2&lt;/sup&gt; (modern value {{val|3.98600|e=14}}) and not the absolute mass.

Experiments involving pendulums continued to be performed in the first half of the 19th century. By the second half of the century, these were outperformed by repetitions of the Cavendish experiment, and the modern value of ''G'' (and hence, of the Earth mass) is still derived from high-precision repetitions of the Cavendish experiment.

In 1821, [[Francesco Carlini]] determined a density value of ρ = {{val|4.39|u=g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}  through measurements made with pendulums in the [[Milan]] area. This value was refined in 1827 by [[Edward Sabine]] to {{val|4.77|u=g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and then in 1841 by Carlo Ignazio Giulio to {{val|4.95|u=g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}. On the other hand, [[George Biddell Airy]] sought to determine ρ by measuring the difference in the period of a pendulum between the surface and the bottom of a mine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The first tests took place in Cornwall between 1826 and 1828. The experiment was a failure due to a fire and a flood. Finally, in 1854, Airy got the value {{val|6.6|u=g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} by measurements in a coal mine in Harton, Sunderland. Airy's method assumed that the Earth had a spherical stratification. Later, in 1883, the experiments conducted by Robert von Sterneck (1839 to 1910) at different depths in mines of Saxony and Bohemia provided the average density values ρ between 5.0 and {{val|6.3|u=g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}. This led to the concept of isostasy, which limits the ability to accurately measure ρ, by either the deviation from vertical of a plumb line or using pendulums. Despite the little chance of an accurate estimate of the average density of the Earth in this way, [[Thomas Corwin Mendenhall]] in 1880 realized a gravimetry experiment in Tokyo and at the top of [[Mount Fuji]]. The result was ρ = {{val|5.77|u=g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

===Modern value===

The uncertainty in the modern value for the Earth's mass has been entirely due to the uncertainty in the [[gravitational constant]] ''G'' since at least the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;"Since the geocentric gravitational constant [...] is now 
determined to a relative accuracy of 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;, our knowledge
of the mass of the earth is entirely limited by the low accuracy
of our knowledge of the Cavendish gravitational constant."
Sagitov (1970 [1969]), p. 718.&lt;/ref&gt;
''G'' is notoriously difficult to measure, and some high-precision measurements during the 1980s to 2010s have yielded mutually exclusive results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schlamminger|first1=Stephan|title=Fundamental constants: A cool way to measure big G|journal=Nature|date=18 June 2014|doi=10.1038/nature13507|bibcode = 2014Natur.510..478S|volume=510|pages=478–480|pmid=24965646}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sagitov (1969) based on the measurement of ''G'' by Heyl and Chrzanowski (1942) cited a value of  {{earth mass}} {{=}} {{val|5.973|(3)|e=24|u=kg}} (relative uncertainty {{val|5|e=-4|}}).

Accuracy has improved only slightly since then. Most modern measurements are repetitions of the Cavendish experiment, with results (within standard uncertainty) ranging between  6.672 and 6.676 ×10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt;  m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; kg&lt;sup&gt;−1 &lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; (relative uncertainty 3×10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;) in results reported since the 1980s, although the  2014 [[NIST]] recommended value is close to 6.674×10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt;  m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; kg&lt;sup&gt;−1 &lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; with a relative uncertainty below  10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;.
The ''Astronomical Almanach Online'' as of 2016 recommends a standard uncertainty of {{val|1|e=-4|}} for Earth mass, {{Earth mass}} {{val|5.9722|(6)|e=24|u=kg}}&lt;ref name="AA"/&gt;

== Variation ==
Earth's mass is variable, subject to both gain and loss due to the accretion of micrometeorites and cosmic dust 
and the loss of hydrogen and helium gas, respectively.
The combined effect is a net loss of material, estimated at {{val|5.5e7|u=kg}} (54,000 tons) per year. This amount is {{val|e=-17}} of the total earth mass.&lt;ref name="IJSRP" /&gt; The {{val|5.5e7|u=kg}} annual net loss is essentially due to 100,000 tons lost due to [[atmospheric escape]], and an average of 45,000 tons gained from in-falling dust and meteorites. This is well within the mass uncertainty of 0.01% ({{val|6|e=20|u=kg}}), so the estimated value of earth's mass is unaffected by this factor.

Mass loss is due to atmospheric escape of gases. About 95,000 tons of hydrogen per year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sfsite.com/fsf/2013/pmpd1301.htm|title=Fantasy and Science Fiction: Science by Pat Murphy &amp; Paul Doherty|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{val|3|u=kg|up=s}}) and 1,600 tons of helium per year&lt;ref name="techdaily"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scitechdaily.com/earth-loses-50000-tonnes-of-mass-every-year/|title=Earth Loses 50,000 Tonnes of Mass Every Year|work=SciTech Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt; are lost through atmospheric escape.
The main factor in mass gain is in-falling material, [[cosmic dust]], [[meteors]], etc. are the most significant contributors to Earth's increase in mass.  The sum of material is estimated to be 37,000 to 78,000 tons annually.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-1-4419-8694-8_5 Spacecraft Measurements of the Cosmic Dust Flux]", Herbert A.

Additional changes in mass are due to the [[Mass–energy equivalence|mass–energy equivalence principal]], although these changes are relatively negligible. An increase in mass has been ascribed to rising temperatures ([[global warming]]), estimated at 160 tonnes per years as of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McDonald|first1=Charlotte|title=Who, What, Why: Is the Earth getting lighter?|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-16787636|website=BBC Magazine|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=9 February 2016|date=31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another 16 tons per year are lost in the form of [[Rotational energy|rotational kinetic energy]] due to the deceleration of the rotation of Earth's inner core.{{citation needed|reason=needs reliable source to back up claim|date=February 2016}} This energy is transferred to the rotational energy of the solar system, and the trend might also be reversible, as rotation speed has been shown to fluctuate over decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tkalčić |first1=Hrvoje |last2=Young |first2=Mallory |last3=Bodin |first3=Thomas |last4=Ngo |first4=Silvie |last5=Sambridge |first5=Malcolm |title=The shuffling rotation of the Earth’s inner core revealed by earthquake doublets |journal=Nature Geoscience |volume=6 |pages=497–502 |date=12 May 2013 |doi=10.1038/ngeo1813 |bibcode = 2013NatGe...6..497T }}&lt;!--|accessdate=7 February 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Mass loss due to [[nuclear fission]] is estimated to amount to 16 tons per year.&lt;ref name="IJSRP" /&gt;

The '''Einasto profile''' (or '''Einasto model''') is a mathematical function that describes how the density &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; of a spherical stellar system varies with distance &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; from its center. [[Jaan Einasto]] introduced his model at a 1963 conference in [[Alma-Ata]], Kazakhstan.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jaan Einasto|J. Einasto]] (1965), Kinematics and dynamics of stellar systems, ''Trudy Inst. Astrofiz. Alma-Ata'' '''5''', 87&lt;/ref&gt;

The Einasto profile possesses a [[power law]] [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic]] slope of the form:
:&lt;math&gt;
\gamma(r) \equiv -\frac{\operatorname{d}\ln\rho(r)}{\operatorname{d}\ln r} \propto r^{\alpha}
&lt;/math&gt;
which can be rearranged to give
:&lt;math&gt;
\rho(r) \propto \exp{(-Ar^\alpha)} .
&lt;/math&gt;

The parameter &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; controls the degree of curvature of the profile. This can be seen by computing the slope on a log-log plot:

:&lt;math&gt;
d\ (\log\rho)/d\ (\log r) \propto -r^{\alpha} .
&lt;/math&gt;

The larger &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, the more rapidly the slope varies with radius (see figure). Einasto's law can be described as a generalization of a power law, &lt;math&gt;\rho\propto r^{-N}&lt;/math&gt;, which has a constant slope on a log-log plot.

Einasto's model has the same mathematical form as [[Sersic's law]], which is used to describe the surface brightness (i.e. projected density) profile of galaxies.

Einasto's model has been used to describe many types of system, including [[galaxy|galaxies]]&lt;ref&gt;J. Einasto and U. Haud (1989), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1989A%26A...223...89E  Galactic models with massive corona. I - Method. II - Galaxy] ''Astron. Astrophys.''

'''Energy in Ivory Coast''' refers to the energy [[industry]] in [[Ivory Coast]]. In recent years, the country has been an important supplier of energy to the [[sub-Saharan]] region as a result of its reserves of [[natural gas]], excess electrical generating capacity, and recent [[offshore drilling|offshore]] finds of [[petroleum]] and natural gas.

==Oil and petroleum==
[[Offshore oil]] was discovered in 1977, with production starting three years later. The bulk of the country's [[oil well|oil]] and [[gas well]]s, (86%), are situated in shallow marine areas, with another 7% located in deep offshore wells. Only 7% of the country's oil and gas wells are onshore. Estimates by the [[Oil &amp; Gas Journal]] have placed the country's proven [[petroleum reserves]] at {{convert|100|Moilbbl|m3}}, as of January 1, 2005. Production for 2004 was estimated at {{convert|35541|oilbbl/d|m3/d}}, with crude oil accounting for {{convert|35000|oilbbl/d|m3/d}}. However, recent{{When|date=October 2009}} finds and new production at several off shore fields and blocks may push the nation's proven reserves and output totals higher. For example, the [[Espoir field]], which began producing in early 2002, is estimated to contain recoverable reserves of {{convert|93|Moilbbl|m3}} of oil and {{convert|180|e9cuft|m3}} of gas. Also, Block CI-40, which is jointly operated by [[Canadian Natural Resources]], [[Svenska Petroleum]] and the state oil corporation, [[Société Nationale d'Opérations Pétrolières de la Côte d'Ivoire]] (Petroci), and which lies {{convert|5|mi|km}} to the south of the Espoir field, is estimated to have recoverable oil reserves of {{convert|200|Moilbbl|m3}}. In Block CI-112, located off Ivory Coast's western coast, is estimated by [[Vanco Energy Company]] to contain {{convert|2.7|Goilbbl|m3}} of oil in the block's [[San Pédro, Ivory Coast|San Pedro]] ridge and in other deposits.

Although natural gas was initially discovered in Ivory Coast in the 1980s, it has only been recently developed as of January 1, 2005, the country is estimated to have of natural gas reserves of 1&amp;nbsp;trillion cu ft. In 2003, natural gas output and domestic consumption were each estimated at 46&amp;nbsp;billion cu ft.
Ivory Coast’s [[oil and gas industry]] is managed by Petroci. Founded in 1975, Petroci was restructured in 1998 into a holding company, Petroci Holding, with three subsidiaries: Petroci Exploration-Production which handles upstream gas and oil activities; Petroci Gaz, which is responsible for the natural gas sector; and Petroci Industries-Services which manages all other related services. Petroci Holding manages the three subsidiaries as well as the country’s holdings in the gas and oil sectors.

Recent openings of the oil market by Pres Laurent Gbagbo (reported originally in North African press &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://poorrichards-blog.blogspot.com/2010/12/ivory-coast-crisis-is-about-oil.html|title=Ivory Coast Crisis is About Oil|website=Poorrichards-blog.blogspot.com|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;) to the Russian and Chinese are suggested in these articles as the substantive reason the UN and France and the US are now very concerned about 'democracy' in Ivory Coast as it was traditionally a French fiefdom run by Francophile elites who are long associated with the opposition candidate Alassane Ouatarra who implemented the routine very strict IMF rulings on Ivorians when he was last prime minister.

==Hydroelectricity==
Ivory Coast uses hydroelectric and thermal generating facilities to provide all of its electrical power. As of January 1, 2002, the country's generating capacity stood at an estimated 900&amp;nbsp;MW. Although hydropower accounts for around two-thirds of its generating capacity, it accounts for less than half of the power generated. In 2002, an estimated 4.8&amp;nbsp;TWh of electric power was generated, of which 38% was [[hydroelectric power|hydroelectric]] and 62% [[thermal power|thermal]]. Gas powered stations alone generated more than half of the total power produced the use of natural gas fueled power stations has also made Ivory Coast into an exporter of [[electricity]]. In 2002, exports of electricity to neighboring countries totaled 1.6&amp;nbsp;TWh. [[Benin]], [[Ghana]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Mali]], and [[Togo]] are among the countries connected to Ivory Coast’s power grid. Domestic consumption of electric power in 2002 is reported to total 3.109&amp;nbsp;TWh. [[Compangnie Ivoirienne d’Electriciti]] (CIE) is the sole supplier of power, and manages, not only the government-owned generating plants, but also the transmission and distribution of power. Although official estimates place the percentage of people living in urban areas that have access to electricity at 77%, less than 15% of those living in rural areas have such access. [[Rural electrification]] has become a major priority with the government.

'''Erucic acid''' is a [[Monounsaturated fat|monounsaturated]] [[omega-9 fatty acid|omega-9]] [[fatty acid]], denoted 22:1ω9. It has the formula CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;CH=CH(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;COOH. It is prevalent in [[wallflower]] seed with a reported content of 20 to 54% in high erucic acid [[rapeseed]] oil,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=M. R. |last=Sahasrabudhe |title=Crismer values and erucic acid contents of rapeseed oils |journal=Journal of the American Oil Chemists' Society |volume=54 |issue=8 |pages=323–324 |doi=10.1007/BF02672436 |pmid= |year=1977 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 42% in [[mustard oil]].  Erucic acid is also known as ''cis''-13-docosenoic acid and the [[geometric isomerism|trans isomer]] is known as brassidic acid.

== Uses ==
Erucic acid has many of the same uses as mineral oils, but it is more readily biodegradable than some.  It has limited ability to polymerize and [[drying oil|dry]] for use in oil [[paint]]s. Like other [[fatty acid]]s, it can be converted into [[surfactant]]s or [[lubricant]]s, and can be used as a precursor to [[biodiesel]] fuel.

Derivatives of erucic acid have many further uses, such as [[behenyl alcohol]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;OH), a [[pour point]] depressant (enabling liquids to flow at a lower temperature), and [[silver behenate]], for use in photography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Economic Research Service, USDA | year = 1996 | url = http://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/IUS6/ius6c.pdf | format = pdf | title = Crambe, Industrial Rapeseed, and Tung Provide Valuable Oils | journal = Fats and Oils, Industrial Uses | pages = 18 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061010225533/http://ers.usda.gov/publications/IUS6/ius6c.pdf | archivedate = 10 October 2006 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sources of erucic acid ==
[[File:RanscombeFarmRape9919.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The seed oil of the rape plant is rich in erucic acid.]]
The name 'erucic' means: of or pertaining to ''[[Eruca]]'';  which is a genus of [[flowering plant]]s in the family [[Brassicaceae]]. It is also the Latin for colewort, which today is better known as [[arugula]].

Erucic acid is produced naturally (together with other fatty acids) across a great range of green plants, but especially so in members of the genus ''[[Brassica]]''.  For industrial purposes and production of erucic acid, [[rapeseed]] is used; for food purposes a 'low-erucic acid rapeseed' (LEAR) has been developed ([[canola]]), which contains fats derived from [[oleic acid]] instead of erucic acid.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;David J.

== Biochemistry ==

Erucic acid is produced by elongation of oleic acid via oleoyl-[[coenzyme A]] and [[malonyl-CoA]].&lt;ref name=Bao&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bao Xiaoming |author2=Pollard Mike |author3=Ohlrogge John | year = 1998 | title = The Biosynthesis of Erucic Acid in Developing Embryos of Brassica rapa | url = | journal = Plant Physiol | volume = 118 | issue = 1| pages = 183–190 | pmid = 9733537 | pmc=34854 | doi=10.1104/pp.118.1.183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erucic acid is broken down into shorter-chain fatty acids in the human liver by the long-chain [[acyl CoA dehydrogenase]] [[enzyme]].

Publication of animal studies with erucic acid through the 1970s led to governments worldwide moving away from oils with high levels of erucic acid,&lt;ref name=McInnis/&gt; and tolerance levels for human exposure to erucic acid have been established based on the animal studies.&lt;ref name=fsa/&gt;&lt;ref name=CFR21&gt;U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, [http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=184.1555 CFR - Code of Federal Regulations Title 21] 1 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=efsa&gt;{{cite journal | author = The Commission of the European Communities | url = http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31980L0891:EN:HTML | title = Commission Directive 80/891/EEC of 25 July 1980 relating to the Community method of analysis for determining the erucic acid content in oils and fats intended to be used as such for human consumption and foodstuffs containing added oils or fats| journal = EurLex Official Journal | volume = 254 | year = 1980 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Food Standards Australia set a provisional tolerable daily intake (PTDI) for an average adult of about 500&amp;nbsp;mg/day of erucic acid, extrapolated based on "the level that is associated with increased myocardial lipidosis in nursing pigs."&lt;ref name=fsa /&gt; "There is a 120-fold safety margin between this level and the level that is associated with  increased myocardial lipidosis in nursing pigs.  The dietary exposure assessment has concluded that the majority of exposure to erucic acid  by the general population would come from the consumption of [[canola oil]].  The dietary intake of erucic acid by an individual consuming at the average level is well below the PTDI, therefore, there is no cause for concern in terms of public health and safety.  However, the individual consuming at a high level has the potential to approach the PTDI.  This would be particularly so if the level of erucic acid in canola oil were to exceed 2% of the total fatty acids."&lt;ref name=fsa /&gt;

{{Use mdy dates|date=January 2012}}
In [[computer science]], '''evolutionary computation''' is a family of [[algorithm]]s for [[global optimization]] inspired by [[biological evolution]], and the subfield of [[artificial intelligence]] and [[soft computing]] studying these algorithms. In technical terms, they are a family of population-based [[trial and error]] problem solvers with a [[metaheuristic]] or [[stochastic optimization]] character.

In evolutionary computation, an initial set of candidate solutions is generated and iteratively updated. Each new generation is produced by stochastically removing less desired solutions, and introducing small random changes. In biological terminology, a [[population]] of solutions is subjected to [[natural selection]] (or [[artificial selection]]) and [[mutation]]. As a result, the population will gradually [[evolution|evolve]] to increase in [[fitness (biology)|fitness]], in this case the chosen [[fitness function]] of the algorithm.

Evolutionary computation techniques can produce highly optimized solutions in a wide range of problem settings, making them popular in [[computer science]]. Many variants and extensions exist, suited to more specific families of problems and data structures. Evolutionary computation is also sometimes used in [[evolutionary biology]] as an ''in silico'' experimental procedure to study common aspects of general evolutionary processes.

== History ==
The use of evolutionary principles for automated problem solving originated in the 1950s. It was not until the 1960s that three distinct interpretations of this idea started to be developed in three different places.

''[[Evolutionary programming]]'' was introduced by [[Lawrence J. Fogel]] in the US, while [[John Henry Holland]] called his method a ''[[genetic algorithm]]''. In Germany [[Ingo Rechenberg]] and [[Hans-Paul Schwefel]] introduced ''[[Evolution strategy|evolution strategies]]''. These areas developed separately for about 15 years. From the early nineties on they are unified as different representatives ("dialects") of one technology, called ''evolutionary computing''. Also in the early nineties, a fourth stream following the general ideas had emerged – ''[[genetic programming]]''. Since the 1990s, nature-inspired algorithms are becoming an increasingly significant part of the evolutionary computation.

These terminologies denote the field of evolutionary computing and consider evolutionary programming, evolution strategies, genetic algorithms, and genetic programming as sub-areas.

Simulations of [[evolution]] using [[evolutionary algorithm]]s and [[artificial life]] started with the work of Nils Aall Barricelli in the 1960s, and was extended by [[Alex Fraser (scientist)|Alex Fraser]], who published a series of papers on simulation of [[artificial selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fraser AS |title=Monte Carlo analyses of genetic models |journal=Nature |volume=181 |issue=4603 |pages=208–9 |year=1958 |pmid=13504138 |doi=10.1038/181208a0 |ref=harv|bibcode=1958Natur.181..208F }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Evolutionary algorithm|Artificial evolution]] became a widely recognised optimisation method as a result of the work of [[Ingo Rechenberg]] in the 1960s and early 1970s, who used [[Evolution strategy|evolution strategies]] to solve complex engineering problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rechenberg |first=Ingo |year=1973 |title=Evolutionsstrategie&amp;nbsp;– Optimierung technischer Systeme nach Prinzipien der biologischen Evolution (PhD thesis) |publisher=Fromman-Holzboog|language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Genetic algorithm]]s in particular became popular through the writing of [[John Henry Holland|John Holland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Holland |first=John H. |year=1975 |title=Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems|publisher=[[University of Michigan Press]]|isbn = 0-262-58111-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; As academic interest grew, dramatic increases in the power of computers allowed practical applications, including the automatic evolution of computer programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Koza|first=John R. |year=1992 |title=Genetic Programming: On the Programming of Computers by Means of Natural Selection|publisher=[[MIT Press]] |isbn=0-262-11170-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionary algorithms are now used to solve multi-dimensional problems more efficiently than software produced by human designers, and also to optimise the design of systems.&lt;ref&gt;G. C. Onwubolu and  B V Babu, {{cite web|url=https://www.springer.com/in/book/9783540201670|title=New Optimization Techniques in Engineering|publisher=|accessdate=17 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jamshidi M |title=Tools for intelligent control: fuzzy controllers, neural networks and genetic algorithms |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A]] |volume=361 |issue=1809 |pages=1781–808 |year=2003 |pmid=12952685 |doi=10.1098/rsta.2003.1225 |ref=harv|bibcode=2003RSPTA.361.1781J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Techniques ==
Evolutionary computing techniques mostly involve [[metaheuristic]] [[Mathematical optimization|optimization]] [[algorithm]]s. Broadly speaking, the field includes:

*[[Ant colony optimization]]
*[[Artificial immune system]]s
*[[Artificial life]] (also see [[digital organism]])
*[[Cultural algorithm]]s
*[[Differential evolution]]
*[[Dual-phase evolution]]
*[[Estimation of distribution algorithm]]s
*[[Evolutionary algorithm]]s
*[[Evolutionary programming]]
*[[Evolution strategy]]
*[[Gene expression programming]]
*[[Genetic algorithm]]
*[[Genetic programming]]
*[[Grammatical evolution]]
*[[Learnable evolution model]]
*[[Learning classifier system]]s
*[[Memetic algorithms]]
*[[Particle swarm optimization]]
*[[Self-organization]] such as [[self-organizing map]]s, [[competitive learning]]
*[[Swarm intelligence]]

== Evolutionary algorithms ==
{{Main article|Evolutionary algorithm}}
[[Evolutionary algorithms]] form a subset of evolutionary computation in that they generally only involve techniques implementing mechanisms inspired by [[biological evolution]] such as [[reproduction]], [[mutation]], [[Genetic recombination|recombination]], [[natural selection]] and [[survival of the fittest]]. [[Candidate solutions]] to the optimization problem play the role of individuals in a population, and the [[Loss function|cost function]] determines the environment within which the solutions "live" (see also [[fitness function]]). [[Evolution]] of the population then takes place after the repeated application of the above operators.

In this process, there are two main forces that form the basis of evolutionary systems:  '''Recombination''' and '''mutation''' create the necessary diversity and thereby facilitate novelty, while '''selection''' acts as a force increasing quality.

Many aspects of such an evolutionary process are [[stochastic]]. Changed pieces of information due to recombination and mutation are randomly chosen. On the other hand, selection operators can be either deterministic, or stochastic. In the latter case, individuals with a higher [[Fitness function|fitness]] have a higher chance to be selected than individuals with a lower [[Fitness function|fitness]], but typically even the weak individuals have a chance to become a parent or to survive.

== Evolutionary algorithms and biology ==
{{Main article|Evolutionary algorithm}}

[[Genetic algorithms]] deliver methods to model [[biological systems]] and [[systems biology]] that are linked to the theory of [[dynamical systems]], since they are used to predict the future states of the system. This is just a vivid (but perhaps misleading) way of drawing attention to the orderly, well-controlled and highly structured character of development in biology.

However, the use of algorithms and informatics, in particular of [[computational theory]], beyond the analogy to dynamical systems, is also relevant to understand evolution itself. 

This view has the merit of recognizing that there is no central control of development; organisms develop as a result of local interactions within and between cells. The most promising ideas about program-development parallels seem to us to be ones that point to an apparently close analogy between processes within cells, and the low-level operation of modern computers &lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/information-biological/#InfEvo &lt;/ref&gt;. Thus, biological systems are like computational machines that process input information to compute next states, such that biological systems are closer to a computation than classical dynamical system &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= J.G. Diaz Ochoa |title= Elastic Multi-scale Mechanisms: Computation and Biological Evolution |journal=[[Journal of Molecular Evolution]] |volume=86 |issue=1 |pages=47–57 |year=2018 |pmid=29248946 |doi=10.1007/s00239-017-9823-7 |ref=harv|bibcode=2018JMolE..86...47D }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Furthermore, following concepts from [[computational theory]], micro processes in biological organisms are fundamentally incomplete and undecidable ([[completeness (logic)]]), implying that “there is more than a crude metaphor behind the analogy between cells and computers &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= A. Danchin |title= Bacteria as computers making computers |journal=[[FEMS Microbiol. Rev.]] |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=3–26 |year=2008 |pmid=29248946 |doi=10.1111/j.1574-6976.2008.00137.x |ref=harv|bibcode= |pmc=2704931 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The analogy to computation extends also to the relationship between [[inheritance systems]] and biological structure, which is often thought to reveal one of the most pressing problems in explaining the origins of life.

'''Fermi liquid theory''' (also known as '''Landau–Fermi liquid theory''') is a theoretical model of interacting [[fermion]]s that describes the normal state of most [[metal]]s at sufficiently low temperatures.&lt;ref name=phillips&gt;{{cite book|last=Phillips|first=Philip|title=Advanced Solid State Physics|year=2008|publisher=Perseus Books|isbn=978-81-89938-16-1|pages=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interaction between the particles of the many-body system does not need to be small. The [[phenomenological model|phenomenological]] theory of Fermi liquids was introduced by the Soviet physicist [[Lev Davidovich Landau]] in 1956, and later developed by [[Alexei Alexeyevich Abrikosov|Alexei Abrikosov]] and [[Isaak Markovich Khalatnikov|Isaak Khalatnikov]] using [[Feynman diagrams|diagrammatic]] [[perturbation theory]].&lt;ref name=caltech&gt;{{cite web|last=Cross|first=Michael|title=Fermi Liquid Theory: Principles|url=http://www.pmaweb.caltech.edu/~mcc/Ph127/c/Lecture9.pdf|publisher=California Institute of Technology|accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory explains why some of the properties of an interacting fermion system are very similar to those of the ideal [[Fermi gas]] (i.e. non-interacting fermions), and why other properties differ.

Important examples of where Fermi liquid theory has been successfully applied are most notably electrons in most metals and Liquid He-3.&lt;ref name=schulz&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schulz|first=H.

[[Helium-3]] is an [[isotope]] of [[helium]], with 2 [[proton]]s, 1 [[neutron]] and 2 electrons per atom. Because there is an odd number of fermions inside the nucleus, the atom itself is also a fermion. The [[electron]]s in a normal (non-[[superconductivity|superconducting]]) metal also form a Fermi liquid, as do the [[nucleons]] (protons and neutrons) in an [[atomic nucleus]].

==Description==

The key ideas behind Landau's theory are the notion of ''adiabaticity'' and the [[Pauli exclusion principle]].&lt;ref name=coleman&gt;{{cite book|last=Coleman|first=Piers|title=Introduction to Many Body Physics|publisher=Rutgers University|pages=143|url=http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/~coleman/620/mbody/pdf/bkx.pdf}} (draft copy)&lt;/ref&gt; Consider a non-interacting fermion system (a [[Fermi gas]]), and suppose we "turn on" the interaction slowly. Landau argued that in this situation, the ground state of the Fermi gas would adiabatically transform into the ground state of the interacting system.

By Pauli's exclusion principle, the ground state &lt;math&gt;\Psi_0&lt;/math&gt; of a Fermi gas consists of fermions occupying all momentum states corresponding to momentum &lt;math&gt;p&lt;p_{\rm F}&lt;/math&gt; with all higher momentum states unoccupied. As interaction is turned on, the spin, charge and momentum of the fermions corresponding to the occupied states remain unchanged, while their dynamical properties, such as their mass, magnetic moment etc. are ''[[renormalization|renormalized]]'' to new values.&lt;ref name=coleman /&gt;  Thus, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the elementary excitations of a Fermi gas system and a Fermi liquid system. In the context of Fermi liquids, these excitations are called "quasi-particles".&lt;ref name=phillips /&gt;

Landau quasiparticles are long-lived excitations with a lifetime &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; that satisfies &lt;math&gt;\frac{\hbar}{\tau}\ll\epsilon_{\rm p}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{\rm p}&lt;/math&gt; is the quasiparticle energy (measured from the  [[Fermi energy]]). At finite temperature, &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{\rm p}&lt;/math&gt; is on the order of the thermal energy &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm B}T&lt;/math&gt;, and the condition for Landau quasiparticles can be reformulated as &lt;math&gt;\frac{\hbar}{\tau}\ll k_{\rm B}T&lt;/math&gt;.

For this system, the [[Green's function]] can be written&lt;ref name=landau&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lifshitz|first1=E. M.|last2=Pitaevskii|first2=L.P.|title=Statistical Physics (Part 2)|series=Landau and Lifshitz|volume=9|year=1980|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-7506-2636-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (near its poles) in the form

&lt;math&gt;G(\omega,p)\approx\frac{Z}{\omega+\mu-\epsilon(p)}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[chemical potential]] and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon(p)&lt;/math&gt; is the energy corresponding to the given momentum state.

The value &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''quasiparticle residue'' and is very characteristic of Fermi liquid theory. The spectral function for the system can be directly observed via [[angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy]] (ARPES), and can be written (in the limit of low-lying excitations) in the form:

&lt;math&gt;A(\mathbf{k},\omega)=Z\delta(\omega-v_{\rm F}k_{\|})&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;v_{\rm F}&lt;/math&gt; is the Fermi velocity.&lt;ref name=senthil&gt;{{cite journal|last=Senthil|first=Todadri|title=Critical Fermi surfaces and non-Fermi liquid metals|year=2008|journal=[[Physical Review B]]|volume=78|issue=3|page=035103|doi= 10.1103/PhysRevB.78.035103 | arxiv=0803.4009|bibcode = 2008PhRvB..78c5103S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physically, we can say that a propagating fermion interacts with its surrounding in such a way that the net effect of the interactions is to make the fermion behave as a "dressed" fermion, altering its effective mass and other dynamical properties. These "dressed" fermions are what we think of as "quasiparticles".&lt;ref name=caltech /&gt;

Another important property of Fermi liquids is related to the scattering cross section for electrons. Suppose we have an electron with energy &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_1&lt;/math&gt; above the Fermi surface, and suppose it scatters with a particle in the [[Composite fermion#Fermi sea|Fermi sea]] with energy &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_2&lt;/math&gt;. By Pauli's exclusion principle, both the particles after scattering have to lie above the Fermi surface, with energies &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_3,\epsilon_4&gt;\epsilon_{\rm F}&lt;/math&gt; Now, suppose the initial electron has energy very close to the Fermi surface &lt;math&gt;\epsilon\approx\epsilon_{\rm F}&lt;/math&gt; Then, we have that &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_2,\epsilon_3,\epsilon_4&lt;/math&gt; also have to be very close to the Fermi surface. This reduces the [[phase space]] volume of the possible states after scattering, and hence, by [[Fermi's golden rule]], the [[scattering cross section]] goes to zero. Thus we can say that the lifetime of particles at the Fermi surface goes to infinity.&lt;ref name=phillips /&gt;

==Similarities to Fermi gas==
The Fermi liquid is qualitatively analogous to the non-interacting [[Fermi gas]], in the following sense: The system's dynamics and thermodynamics at low excitation energies and temperatures may be described by substituting the non-interacting fermions with interacting [[quasiparticle]]s, each of which carries the same [[Spin (physics)|spin]], [[Electric charge|charge]] and [[momentum]] as the original particles. Physically these may be thought of as being particles whose motion is disturbed by the surrounding particles and which themselves perturb the particles in their vicinity. Each many-particle excited state of the interacting system may be described by  listing all occupied momentum states, just as in the non-interacting system. As a consequence, quantities such as the heat capacity of the Fermi liquid behave qualitatively in the same way as in the Fermi gas (e.g. the heat capacity rises linearly with temperature).

==Differences from Fermi gas==
The following differences to the non-interacting Fermi gas arise:

===Energy===
The [[energy]] of a many-particle state is not simply a sum of the single-particle energies of all occupied states. Instead, the change in energy for a given change &lt;math&gt;\delta n_k&lt;/math&gt; in occupation of states &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; contains terms both linear and quadratic in &lt;math&gt;\delta n_k&lt;/math&gt; (for the Fermi gas, it would only be linear, &lt;math&gt;\delta n_k \epsilon_k&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_k&lt;/math&gt; denotes the single-particle energies). The linear contribution corresponds to renormalized single-particle energies, which involve, e.g., a change in the effective mass of particles. The quadratic terms correspond to a sort of "mean-field" interaction between quasiparticles, which is parametrized by so-called Landau Fermi liquid parameters and determines the behaviour of density oscillations (and spin-density oscillations) in the Fermi liquid. Still, these mean-field interactions do not lead to a scattering of quasi-particles with a transfer of particles between different momentum states.

The renormalization of the mass of a fluid of interacting fermions can be calculated from first principles using many-body computational techniques. For the two-dimensional [[homogeneous electron gas]], [[GW approximation|GW calculations]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=R. Asgari |author2=B.

===Specific heat and compressibility===
[[Specific heat]], [[compressibility]], [[spin-susceptibility]] and other quantities show the same qualitative behaviour (e.g. dependence on temperature) as in the Fermi gas, but the magnitude is (sometimes strongly) changed.

===Interactions===
In addition to the mean-field interactions, some weak interactions between quasiparticles remain, which lead to scattering of quasiparticles off each other. Therefore, quasiparticles acquire a finite lifetime. However, at low enough energies above the Fermi surface, this lifetime becomes very long, such that the product of excitation energy (expressed in frequency) and lifetime is much larger than one. In this sense, the quasiparticle energy is still well-defined (in the opposite limit, [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]]'s [[Uncertainty principle|uncertainty relation]] would prevent an accurate definition of the energy).

===Structure===
The structure of the "bare" particle's (as opposed to quasiparticle) [[Green's function]] is similar to that in the Fermi gas (where, for a given momentum, the Green's function in frequency space is a delta peak at the respective single-particle energy). The delta peak in the density-of-states is broadened (with a width given by the quasiparticle lifetime). In addition (and in contrast to the quasiparticle Green's function), its weight (integral over frequency) is suppressed by a quasiparticle weight factor &lt;math&gt;0&lt;Z&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;. The remainder of the total weight is in a broad "incoherent background", corresponding to the strong effects of interactions on the fermions at short time-scales.

===Distribution===
The distribution of particles (as opposed to quasiparticles) over momentum states at zero temperature still shows a discontinuous jump at the Fermi surface (as in the Fermi gas), but it does not drop from 1 to 0: the step is only of size &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;.

===Electrical resistivity===
In a metal the resistivity at low temperatures is dominated by electron-electron scattering in combination with [[umklapp scattering]]. For a Fermi liquid, the resistivity from this mechanism varies as &lt;math&gt;T^2&lt;/math&gt;, which is often taken as an experimental check for Fermi liquid behaviour (in addition to the linear temperature-dependence of the specific heat), although it only arises in combination with the lattice. In certain cases, umklapp scattering is not required. For example, the resistivity of compensated [[semimetal]]s &lt;nowiki/&gt;scales as &lt;math&gt;T^2&lt;/math&gt; because of mutual scattering of electron and hole. This is known as the Baber mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baber, W. G.|date=1937|title=The Contribution to the Electrical Resistance of Metals from Collisions between Electrons|journal=Proc. Royal Soc. Lond. A|volume=158|issue=894|pages=383–396|doi=10.1098/rspa.1937.0027|bibcode=1937RSPSA.158..383B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Optical response===
Fermi liquid theory predicts that the scattering rate, which governs the optical response of metals, not only depends quadratically on temperature (thus causing the &lt;math&gt;T^2&lt;/math&gt; dependence of the DC resistance), but it also depends quadratically on frequency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=R.

==Instabilities==

The experimental observation of exotic phases in strongly correlated systems has triggered an enormous effort from the theoretical community to try to understand their microscopic origin. One possible route to detect instabilities of a Fermi liquid is precisely the analysis done by [[Isaak Pomeranchuk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=I. I. Pomeranchuk|year=1959|title=ON THE STABILITY OF A FERMI LIQUID|journal=Sov. Phys. JETP|volume=8|pages=361–362}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to that, the [[Pomeranchuk instability]] has been studied by several authors &lt;ref&gt;Actually, this is a subject of investigation, see for example: https://arxiv.org/abs/0804.4422.&lt;/ref&gt; with different techniques in the last few years and in particular, the instability of the Fermi liquid towards the nematic phase was investigated for several models.

==Non-Fermi liquids==
The term '''non-Fermi liquid''', also known as "strange metal",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ong|first1=edited by N. Phuan|last2=Bhatt|first2=Ravin N.|title=More is different : fifty years of condensed matter physics|date=2001|publisher=Princeton university press|location=Princeton (N.J.)|isbn=978-0691088662|page=65|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=oledr2LiDxYC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is used to describe a system which displays breakdown of Fermi-liquid behaviour. The simplest example of such a system is the system of interacting fermions in one-dimension, called the [[Luttinger liquid]].&lt;ref name=schulz /&gt;  Although Luttinger liquids are physically similar to Fermi liquids, the restriction to one dimension gives rise to several qualitative differences such as the absence of a ''quasiparticle peak'' in the momentum dependent spectral function, spin-charge separation, and the presence of [[spin wave|spin density waves]]. One cannot ignore the existence of interactions in one-dimension and has to describe the problem with a non-Fermi theory, where Luttinger liquid is one of them. At small finite spin-temperatures in one-dimension the ground-state of the system is described by spin-incoherent Luttinger liquid (SILL).&lt;ref name=soltanieh-ha&gt;{{cite journal|last=M. Soltanieh-ha|first=A. E. Feiguin|title=Class of variational Ansätze for the spin-incoherent ground state of a Luttinger liquid coupled to a spin bath|year=2012|journal=PRB|volume=86|issue=20|page= 205120 |doi= 10.1103/PhysRevB.86.205120 | arxiv=1211.0982|bibcode = 2012PhRvB..86t5120S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of such behaviour is observed at [[quantum critical point]]s of certain second-order [[phase transitions]], such as [[heavy fermion]] criticality, [[Mott insulator|Mott criticality]] and high-&lt;math&gt;T_{\rm c}&lt;/math&gt; [[High-temperature superconductivity#Cuprates|cuprate]] phase transitions.&lt;ref name=senthil /&gt; The ground state of such transitions is characterized by the presence of a sharp Fermi surface, although there may not be well-defined quasiparticles. That is, on approaching the critical point, it is observed that the quasiparticle residue &lt;math&gt;Z\to0&lt;/math&gt;

Understanding the behaviour of non-Fermi liquids is an important problem in condensed matter physics. Approaches towards explaining these phenomena include the treatment of ''marginal Fermi liquids''; attempts to understand critical points and derive [[critical scaling|scaling relations]]; and descriptions using ''emergent'' [[gauge theory|gauge theories]] with techniques of [[Holographic principle|holographic]] gauge/gravity duality.&lt;ref name=polchinsky&gt;{{cite journal|last=Faulkner|first=Thomas|author2=Polchinski, Joseph|title=Semi-Holographic Fermi Liquids|year=2010| arxiv=1001.5049|doi=10.1007/JHEP06(2011)012|volume=2011|issue=6|pages=12|journal=Journal of High Energy Physics|bibcode=2011JHEP...06..012F|citeseerx=10.1.1.755.3304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Flerovium''' is a [[Transactinide element|superheavy]] artificial [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Fl''' and [[atomic number]] 114. It is an extremely [[radioactivity|radioactive]] [[synthetic element]]. The element is named after the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions of the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] in [[Dubna]], Russia, where the element was discovered in 1998. The name of the laboratory, in turn, honours the Russian physicist [[Georgy Flyorov]] ({{lang|ru|Флёров|nocat=y}} in [[Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]], hence the transliteration of "[[yo (Cyrillic)|yo]]" to "e"). The name was adopted by [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] on 30 May 2012.

In the [[periodic table]] of the elements, it is a [[transactinide element]] in the [[p-block]]. It is a member of the [[period 7 element|7th period]] and is the heaviest known member of the [[carbon group]]; it is also the heaviest element whose chemistry has been investigated. Initial chemical studies performed in 2007–2008 indicated that flerovium was unexpectedly volatile for a group 14 element;&lt;ref name="volatile114"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eichler |first1=R. |display-authors=etal |date=2010 |title=Indication for a volatile element 114 |journal=[[Radiochimica Acta]] |volume=98 |issue=3 |pages=133–139 |doi=10.1524/ract.2010.1705 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in preliminary results it even seemed to exhibit properties similar to those of the [[noble gas]]es.&lt;ref name="tanm"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gäggeler |first1=H.

The question of whether flerovium behaves more like a metal or a noble gas is still unresolved as of 2018.

About 90 atoms of flerovium have been observed: 58 were synthesized directly, and the rest were made from the [[radioactive decay]] of heavier elements. All of these flerovium atoms have been shown to have [[mass number]]s from 284 to 290. The most stable known [[isotopes of flerovium|flerovium isotope]], flerovium-289, has a [[half-life]] of around 2.6&amp;nbsp;seconds, but it is possible that the unconfirmed flerovium-290 with one extra neutron may have a longer half-life of 19&amp;nbsp;seconds; this would be one of the longest half-lives of any isotope of any element at these farthest reaches of the periodic table. Flerovium is predicted to be near the centre of the theorized [[island of stability]], and it is expected that heavier flerovium isotopes, especially the possibly [[magic number (physics)|doubly magic]] flerovium-298, may have even longer half-lives.

==History==
{{see also|Discovery of the chemical elements}}

===Pre-discovery===
From the late 1940s to the early 1960s, the early days of the synthesis of heavier and heavier [[transuranium element]]s, it was predicted that since such heavy elements did not occur naturally, they would have shorter and shorter half-lives to [[spontaneous fission]], until they stopped existing altogether at around element 108 (now known as [[hassium]]). Initial work in the synthesis of the [[actinide]]s appeared to confirm this.&lt;ref name=Sacks&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[nuclear shell model]], introduced in the late 1960s, stated that the [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s formed shells within a nucleus, somewhat analogous to [[electron]]s forming [[electron shell]]s within an atom. The [[noble gas]]es are [[reactivity (chemistry)|unreactive]] due to their having full electron shells; thus it was theorized that elements with full nuclear shells – having so-called "[[magic number (physics)|magic]]" numbers of protons or neutrons – would be stabilized against [[radioactive decay]]. A doubly magic [[isotope]], having magic numbers of both protons and neutrons, would be especially stabilized, and it was calculated that the next doubly magic isotope after [[lead-208]] would be flerovium-298 with 114 protons and 184 neutrons, which would form the centre of a so-called "[[island of stability]]".&lt;ref name=Sacks/&gt; This island of stability, supposedly ranging from [[copernicium]] (element 112) to [[oganesson]] (118), would come after a long "sea of instability" from elements [[mendelevium|101]] (mendelevium) to [[roentgenium|111]] (roentgenium),&lt;ref name=Sacks/&gt; and the flerovium isotopes in it were speculated in 1966 to have half-lives in excess of a hundred&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name=emsley&gt;{{cite book|last=Emsley|first=John|title=Nature's Building Blocks: An A-Z Guide to the Elements|edition=New|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-19-960563-7|page=580}}&lt;/ref&gt; These early predictions fascinated researchers, and led to the first attempted synthesis of flerovium in 1968 using the reaction &lt;sup&gt;248&lt;/sup&gt;Cm(&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Ar,xn). No isotopes of flerovium were found in this reaction. This was thought to occur because the compound nucleus &lt;sup&gt;288&lt;/sup&gt;Fl only has 174 neutrons instead of the hypothesized magic 184, and this would have a significant impact on the half-life and cross section of such a reaction.&lt;ref name=Transuraniumppl&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoffman|first=D.C |last2=Ghiorso|first2=A.|last3=Seaborg|first3=G.T.|title=The Transuranium People: The Inside Story |publisher=Imperial College Press|date=2000|isbn=1-86094-087-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=superlourds&gt;{{cite journal|last=Epherre|first=M.|last2=Stephan|first2=C.|date=1975|title=Les éléments superlourds|language=French|journal=Le Journal de Physique Colloques|volume=11|issue=36|pages=C5-159-164|url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/46775464.pdf|doi=10.1051/jphyscol:1975541}}&lt;/ref&gt; It then took thirty more years for the first isotopes of flerovium to be synthesized.&lt;ref name=Sacks/&gt; More recent work suggests that the local islands of stability around hassium and flerovium are due to these nuclei being respectively deformed and [[oblate spheroid|oblate]], which make them resistant to spontaneous fission, and that the true island of stability for spherical nuclei occurs at around [[unbibium]]-306 (with 122 protons and 184 neutrons).&lt;ref name=Kratz&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Kratz |first1=J.

===Discovery===
Flerovium was first synthesized in December 1998 by a team of scientists at the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] (JINR) in [[Dubna]], Russia, led by [[Yuri Oganessian]], who bombarded a target of [[plutonium-244]] with accelerated nuclei of [[calcium-48]]:

:{{nuclide|plutonium|244}} + {{nuclide|calcium|48}} → {{nuclide|flerovium|292}}* → {{nuclide|flerovium|290}} + 2 {{nuclide|neutronium|1}}

This reaction had been attempted before, but without success; for this 1998 attempt, the JINR had upgraded all of its equipment to detect and separate the produced atoms better and bombard the target more intensely.&lt;ref name=Chapman&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.chemistryworld.com/what-it-takes-to-make-a-new-element/1017677.article |title= What it takes to make a new element|last= Chapman| first= Kit|date=November 30, 2016|magazine=Chemistry World |publisher= Royal Society of Chemistry|accessdate=December 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A single atom of flerovium, decaying by [[alpha decay|alpha emission]] with a lifetime of 30.4&amp;nbsp;seconds, was detected. The [[decay energy]] measured was 9.71&amp;nbsp;[[electronvolt|MeV]], giving an expected half-life of 2–23&amp;nbsp;s.&lt;ref name="99Og01"/&gt; This observation was assigned to the isotope flerovium-289 and was published in January 1999.&lt;ref name="99Og01"&gt;

[[Glenn T.

Ghiorso later recalled:&lt;ref name="Seaborg-obituary"/&gt;

===Road to confirmation===
In March 1999, the same team replaced the &lt;sup&gt;244&lt;/sup&gt;Pu target with a &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Pu one in order to produce other flerovium isotopes. This time two atoms of flerovium were produced, decaying via alpha emission with a half-life of 5.5 s. They were assigned as &lt;sup&gt;287&lt;/sup&gt;Fl.&lt;ref name="99Og02"&gt;

The now-confirmed discovery of flerovium was made in June 1999 when the Dubna team repeated the first reaction from 1998. This time, two atoms of flerovium were produced; they alpha decayed with a half-life of 2.6&amp;nbsp;s, different from the 1998 result.&lt;ref name="00Og01"&gt;

In May 2009, the Joint Working Party (JWP) of [[IUPAC]] published a report on the discovery of copernicium in which they acknowledged the discovery of the isotope &lt;sup&gt;283&lt;/sup&gt;Cn.&lt;ref&gt;

This was followed by confirmation of flerovium-288 and -289 in July 2009 at the [[Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung]] (GSI) in Germany. In 2011, IUPAC evaluated the Dubna team experiments of 1999–2007. They found the early data inconclusive, but accepted the results of 2004–2007 as flerovium, and the element was officially recognized as having been discovered.&lt;ref name=jwr&gt;

While the method of chemical characterisation of a daughter was successful in the cases of flerovium and livermorium, and the simpler structure of even–even nuclei made the confirmation of oganesson (element 118) straightforward, there have been difficulties in establishing the congruence of decay chains from isotopes with odd protons, odd neutrons, or both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Forsberg |first=U. |last2=Rudolph |first2=D. |first3=C. |last3=Fahlander |first4=P. |last4=Golubev |first5=L.

Using [[Mendeleev's predicted elements|Mendeleev's nomenclature for unnamed and undiscovered elements]], flerovium is sometimes called ''eka-[[lead]]''. In 1979, IUPAC published recommendations according to which the element was to be called ''ununquadium'' (with the corresponding symbol of ''Uuq''),&lt;ref name=iupac&gt;

After the discovery of flerovium and livermorium was recognized by IUPAC on 1 June 2011, IUPAC asked the discovery team at the JINR to suggest permanent names for those two elements. The Dubna team chose to name element 114 ''flerovium'' (symbol Fl),&lt;ref&gt;

==Predicted properties==

===Nuclear stability and isotopes===
{{main|Isotopes of flerovium}}
[[File:IBA nuclear shells.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.6|Regions of differently shaped nuclei, as predicted by the [[Interacting Boson Approximation]]&lt;ref name=Kratz/&gt;]]
The physical basis of the chemical [[periodic trends|periodicity]] governing the periodic table is the electron shell closures at each noble gas ([[atomic number]]s [[helium|2]], [[neon|10]], [[argon|18]], [[krypton|36]], [[xenon|54]], [[radon|86]], and 118): as any further electrons must enter a new shell with higher energy, closed-shell electron configurations are markedly more stable, leading to the relative inertness of the noble gases.&lt;ref name=BFricke/&gt; Since protons and neutrons are also known to arrange themselves in closed nuclear shells, the same effect happens at nucleon shell closures, which happen at specific nucleon numbers often dubbed "magic numbers". The known magic numbers are 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, and 82 for protons and neutrons, and additionally 126 for neutrons.&lt;ref name=BFricke/&gt; Nucleons with magic proton and [[neutron number]]s, such as [[helium-4]], [[oxygen-16]], calcium-48, and lead-208, are termed "doubly magic" and are very stable against decay. This property of increased nuclear stability is very important for [[superheavy element]]s: without any stabilization, their half-lives would be expected by exponential extrapolation to be in the range of [[nanosecond]]s (10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;s) when [[darmstadtium|element 110]] (darmstadtium) is reached, because of the ever-increasing repulsive electrostatic forces between the positively charged protons that overcome the limited-range [[strong nuclear force]] that holds the nucleus together. The next closed nucleon shells and hence magic numbers are thought to be at the centre of the long-sought island of stability, where the half-lives to alpha decay and spontaneous fission lengthen again.&lt;ref name=BFricke/&gt;

[[File:Next proton shell.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.6|Orbitals with high [[azimuthal quantum number]] are raised in energy, eliminating what would otherwise be a gap in orbital energy corresponding to a closed proton shell at element 114. This raises the next proton shell to the region around [[unbinilium|element 120]].&lt;ref name=Kratz/&gt;]]
Initially, by analogy with the neutron magic number 126, the next proton shell was also expected to occur at element 126, too far away from the synthesis capabilities of the mid-20th century to achieve much theoretical attention. In 1966, new values for the potential and [[spin-orbit interaction]] in this region of the periodic table&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kalinkin |first=B. N. |last2=Gareev |first2=F.

In 2008 it was thus hypothesized that the stabilization against fission of these nuclides was due to their being [[Spheroid|oblate]] nuclei, and that a region of oblate nuclei was centred on &lt;sup&gt;288&lt;/sup&gt;Fl. Additionally, new theoretical models showed that the expected gap in energy between the proton orbitals 2f&lt;sub&gt;7/2&lt;/sub&gt; (filled at element 114) and 2f&lt;sub&gt;5/2&lt;/sub&gt; (filled at [[unbinilium|element 120]]) was smaller than expected, so that element 114 no longer appeared to be a stable spherical closed nuclear shell. The next doubly magic nucleus is now expected to be around &lt;sup&gt;306&lt;/sup&gt;Ubb, but the expected low half-life and low production [[cross section (physics)|cross section]] of this nuclide makes its synthesis challenging.&lt;ref name=Kratz/&gt; Nevertheless, the island of stability is still expected to exist in this region of the periodic table, and nearer its centre (which has not been approached closely enough yet) some nuclides, such as &lt;sup&gt;291&lt;/sup&gt;[[moscovium|Mc]] and its alpha- and beta-decay [[decay product|daughters]],{{efn|Specifically, &lt;sup&gt;291&lt;/sup&gt;Mc, &lt;sup&gt;291&lt;/sup&gt;Fl, &lt;sup&gt;291&lt;/sup&gt;Nh, &lt;sup&gt;287&lt;/sup&gt;Nh, &lt;sup&gt;287&lt;/sup&gt;Cn, &lt;sup&gt;287&lt;/sup&gt;Rg, &lt;sup&gt;283&lt;/sup&gt;Rg, and &lt;sup&gt;283&lt;/sup&gt;Ds, which are expected to decay to the relatively longer-lived nuclei &lt;sup&gt;279&lt;/sup&gt;Mt, &lt;sup&gt;283&lt;/sup&gt;Mt, &lt;sup&gt;287&lt;/sup&gt;Ds, and &lt;sup&gt;291&lt;/sup&gt;Cn.&lt;ref name=Zagrebaev/&gt;}} may be found to decay by [[positron emission]] or [[electron capture]] and thus move into the centre of the island.&lt;ref name="Zagrebaev"&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Zagrebaev |first1=Valeriy |last2=Karpov |first2=Alexander |last3=Greiner |first3=Walter |date=2013 |title=Future of superheavy element research: Which nuclei could be synthesized within the next few years? |publisher=IOP Science |booktitle=Journal of Physics: Conference Series |volume=420 |pages=1–15 |url=http://iopscience.iop.org/1742-6596/420/1/012001/pdf/1742-6596_420_1_012001.pdf |accessdate=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the expected high fission barriers, any nucleus within this island of stability decays exclusively by alpha decay and perhaps some electron capture and [[beta decay]],&lt;ref name=BFricke/&gt; both of which would bring the nuclei closer to the beta stability line where the island is expected to be.

===Atomic and physical===
Flerovium is a member of group 14 in the [[periodic table]], below [[carbon]], [[silicon]], [[germanium]], [[tin]], and lead. Every previous group 14 element has four electrons in its valence shell, forming a [[valence electron]] configuration of ns&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;np&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. In flerovium's case, the trend will be continued and the valence electron configuration is predicted to be 7s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;7p&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;;&lt;ref name="Haire"/&gt; flerovium will behave similarly to its lighter [[congener (chemistry)|congeners]] in many respects. Differences are likely to arise; a largely contributing effect is the [[spin–orbit interaction|spin–orbit (SO) interaction]]—the mutual interaction between the electrons' motion and [[spin (physics)|spin]]. It is especially strong for the superheavy elements, because their electrons move faster than in lighter atoms, at velocities comparable to the [[speed of light]].{{sfn|Thayer|2010|pp=63–64}} In relation to flerovium atoms, it lowers the 7s and the 7p electron energy levels&lt;!--|level is an important word. Lv has no 8s electrons but they've been shown to affect its chem---&gt; (stabilizing the corresponding electrons), but two of the 7p electron energy levels are stabilized more than the other four.&lt;ref name="Faegri"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stabilization of the 7s electrons is called the [[inert pair effect]], and the effect "tearing" the 7p subshell into the more stabilized and the less stabilized parts is called subshell splitting. Computation chemists see the split as a change of the second ([[azimuthal quantum number|azimuthal]]) [[quantum number]] ''l'' from 1 to {{frac|1|2}} and {{frac|3|2}} for the more stabilized and less stabilized parts of the 7p subshell, respectively.{{sfn|Thayer|2010|pp=63–67}}{{efn|The quantum number corresponds to the letter in the electron orbital name: 0 to s, 1 to p, 2 to d, etc. See [[azimuthal quantum number]] for more information.}} For many theoretical purposes, the valence electron configuration may be represented to reflect the 7p subshell split as 7s{{su|p=2|w=70%}}7p{{su|b=1/2|p=2|w=70%}}.&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt; These effects cause flerovium's chemistry to be somewhat different from that of its lighter neighbours.

Due to the spin-orbit splitting of the 7p subshell being very large in flerovium, and the fact that both flerovium's filled orbitals in the seventh shell are stabilized relativistically, the valence electron configuration of flerovium may be considered to have a completely filled shell, making flerovium a very [[noble metal]]. Its first [[ionization energy]] of {{convert|8.539|eVpar|kJ/mol|abbr=on|lk=on}} should be the highest in group 14.&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt; The 6d electron levels are also destabilized, leading to some early speculations that they may be chemically active, although newer work suggests that this is unlikely.&lt;ref name=BFricke/&gt;

The closed-shell electron configuration of flerovium results in the [[metallic bonding]] in metallic flerovium being weaker than in the preceding and following elements; thus, flerovium is expected to have a low [[boiling point]],&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt; and has recently been suggested to be possibly a gaseous metal, similar to the predictions for copernicium, which also has a closed-shell electron configuration.&lt;ref name=Kratz/&gt; The [[melting point|melting]] and boiling points of flerovium were predicted in the 1970s to be around 70&amp;nbsp;°C and 150&amp;nbsp;°C,&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt; significantly lower than the values for the lighter group 14 elements (those of lead are 327&amp;nbsp;°C and 1749&amp;nbsp;°C respectively), and continuing the trend of decreasing boiling points down the group. Although earlier studies predicted a boiling point of ~1000&amp;nbsp;°C or 2840&amp;nbsp;°C,&lt;ref name=BFricke/&gt; this is now considered unlikely because of the expected weak metallic bonding in flerovium and that group trends would expect flerovium to have a low sublimation enthalpy.&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt; Recent experimental indications have suggested that the pseudo-closed shell configuration of flerovium results in very weak metallic bonding and hence that flerovium is probably a gas at room temperature with a boiling point of around −60&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=gaseous/&gt; Like [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[radon]], and copernicium, but not lead and [[oganesson]] (eka-radon), flerovium is calculated to have no [[electron affinity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kernchemie.uni-mainz.de/downloads/che_7/presentations/borschevsky.pdf |title=Fully relativistic ''ab initio'' studies of superheavy elements |last1=Borschevsky |first1=Anastasia |first2=Valeria |last2=Pershina |first3=Uzi |last3=Kaldor |first4=Ephraim |last4=Eliav |website=www.kernchemie.uni-mainz.de |publisher=[[Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz]] |access-date=15 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180115184921/http://www.kernchemie.uni-mainz.de/downloads/che_7/presentations/borschevsky.pdf |archive-date=15 January 2018 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical===
Flerovium is the heaviest known member of group 14 in the periodic table, below lead, and is projected to be the second member of the 7p series of chemical elements. Nihonium and flerovium are expected to form a very short subperiod, coming between the filling of the 6d&lt;sub&gt;5/2&lt;/sub&gt; and 7p&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; subshells. Their chemical behaviour is expected to be very distinctive: nihonium's homology to thallium has been called "doubtful" by computational chemists, while flerovium's to lead has been called only "formal".&lt;ref name=Zaitsevskii&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tan11.jinr.ru/pdf/07_Sep/S_3/04_Titov.pdf |title=Relativistic DFT and ab initio calculations on the seventh-row superheavy elements: E113 - E114 |last1=Zaitsevskii |first1=A. |first2=C. |last2=van Wüllen |first3=A. |last3=Rusakov |first4=A. |last4=Titov |date=September 2007 |website=jinr.ru |access-date=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first five members of group 14 show the group oxidation state of +4 and the latter members have an increasingly prominent +2 chemistry due to the onset of the inert pair effect.

==Experimental chemistry==
Flerovium is currently the heaviest element to have had its chemistry experimentally investigated, although the chemical investigations have so far not led to a conclusive result. Two experiments were performed in April–May 2007 in a joint FLNR-[[Paul Scherrer Institute|PSI]] collaboration aiming to study the chemistry of copernicium. The first experiment involved the reaction &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Pu(&lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;Ca,3n)&lt;sup&gt;287&lt;/sup&gt;Fl and the second the reaction &lt;sup&gt;244&lt;/sup&gt;Pu(&lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;Ca,4n)&lt;sup&gt;288&lt;/sup&gt;Fl: these reactions produce short-lived flerovium isotopes whose copernicium daughters would then be studied.&lt;ref name=2007ex/&gt; The adsorption properties of the resultant atoms on a gold surface were compared with those of radon, as it was then expected that copernicium's full-shell electron configuration would lead to noble-gas like behaviour.&lt;ref name=2007ex/&gt; Noble gases interact with metal surfaces very weakly, which is uncharacteristic of metals.&lt;ref name=2007ex/&gt;

The first experiment allowed detection of three atoms of &lt;sup&gt;283&lt;/sup&gt;Cn but also seemingly detected 1 atom of &lt;sup&gt;287&lt;/sup&gt;Fl. This result was a surprise given the transport time of the product atoms is ~2&amp;nbsp;s, so the flerovium atoms produced should have decayed to copernicium before adsorption. In the second reaction, 2 atoms of &lt;sup&gt;288&lt;/sup&gt;Fl and possibly 1 atom of &lt;sup&gt;289&lt;/sup&gt;Fl were detected. Two of the three atoms displayed adsorption characteristics associated with a volatile, noble-gas-like element, which has been suggested but is not predicted by more recent calculations. These experiments provided independent confirmation for the discovery of copernicium, flerovium, and livermorium via comparison with published decay data. Further experiments in 2008 to confirm this important result detected a single atom of &lt;sup&gt;289&lt;/sup&gt;Fl, and supported previous data showing flerovium having a noble-gas-like interaction with gold.&lt;ref name=2007ex&gt;{{cite web|date=2009|title=Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions|url=http://www1.jinr.ru/Reports/2008/english/06_flnr_e.pdf|pages=86–96|accessdate=1 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The experimental support for a noble-gas-like flerovium soon weakened. In 2009 and 2010, the FLNR-PSI collaboration synthesized further atoms of flerovium to follow up their 2007 and 2008 studies. In particular, the first three flerovium atoms synthesized in the 2010 study suggested again a noble-gas-like character, but the complete set taken together resulted in a more ambiguous interpretation, unusual for a metal in the carbon group but not fully like a noble gas in character.&lt;ref name=2009ex/&gt; In their paper, the scientists refrained from calling flerovium's chemical properties "close to those of noble gases", as had previously been done in the 2008 study.&lt;ref name=2009ex&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eichler |first1=R. |last2=Aksenov |first2=N.

In even later experiments from 2012 at the GSI, the chemical properties of flerovium were found to be more metallic than noble-gas-like.

The same year, new experiments aimed at probing the chemistry of copernicium and flerovium were conducted at GSI's TASCA facility, and the data from these experiments is currently being analysed.

Using the continuum hypothesis, fluids are classified into fluid particles, which are composed of numerous fluid molecules. These particles interact with one another and with the surroundings they are in. Using a Eulerian model (the [[continuum hypothesis]]), fluid motion can be described in terms of [[acceleration]] or [[velocity]].

==Unsteady and convective effects==
The composition of the material contains two types of terms: those involving the time derivative and those involving spatial derivatives. The time derivative portion is denoted as the local derivative, and represents the effects of unsteady flow. The local derivative occurs during unsteady flow, and becomes zero for steady flow.

The portion of the material derivative represented by the spatial derivatives is called the convective derivative. It accounts for the variation in fluid property, be it velocity or temperature for example, due to the motion of a fluid particle in space where its values are different.

==Acceleration field==
The acceleration of a particle is the time rate of change of its velocity. Using an Eulerian description for velocity, the velocity field V = V(x,y,z,t), and deriving it with respect to time, we obtain the acceleration field.

The '''Gedser wind turbine''' is located near [[Gedser]] in the south of the Danish island of [[Falster]]. It was constructed by the engineer [[Johannes Juul]] in 1957 for the SEAS (''Sydsjællands Elektricitets Aktieselskab'') electricity company with support from the [[Marshall Plan]]. Its innovative design was a major breakthrough in the development of [[wind turbine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/17/wind-power-renewable-energy Niki Nixon, "Timeline: The history of wind power"], ''The Guardian'', 17 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=turistnyt&gt;[http://www.turistnyt.dk/news/Tema/10163.html "Gedsermøllen - en kulturkanon på Elmuseet"], Turist Nyt. {{da icon}} Retrieved 3 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DWIA&gt;[http://ele.aut.ac.ir/~wind/en/pictures/juul.htm "The Gedser Wind Turbine"], Danish Wind Industry Association. Retrieved 3 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
As a 17-year-old, Johannes Juul (1887–1969) had studied wind electricity applications under [[Poul la Cour]] at Askov Højskole, a [[folk high school]], in 1904. In the early 1950s, he built two smaller [[alternating current]] turbines which operated at [[Vester Egesborg]] near [[Næstved]] and on the island of [[Bogø]].&lt;ref name=DWIA/&gt; His three-bladed Gedser facility (1957) was Denmark's first large wind turbine. With a blade span of {{convert|24|m|abbr=on}}, it produced 200&amp;nbsp;kW of alternating current fed directly into the [[Electrical grid|grid]]. Its electromechanical yawing, [[Induction generator|asynchronous generator]], and the three stall-regulated blades with emergency aerodynamic tip brakes (these were invented by Juul) is a design that is still widely used in Denmark. Stall control was provided through an asynchronous generator.&lt;ref name="Nelson2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nelson|first=Vaughn|title=Wind Energy: Renewable Energy and the Environment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VKGF-E738yUC&amp;pg=PA9|accessdate=8 February 2013|year=2009|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4200-7568-7|pages=9–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The turbine, which for many years was the world's largest, operated from 1957 to 1967 without maintenance, demonstrating incredible durability. In connection with NASA testing for the U.S. wind energy programme, it was refurbished in 1975 and brought back into operation.&lt;ref name=DWIA/&gt; It continued to run for a few years, providing test data for the further development of wind turbines in Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energimuseet.dk/Emneinddeling/Wind-power-Gedser-Turbine.aspx "Wind power &amp; Gedser Turbine"], Energi Museet. Retrieved 3 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of its lifetime, the Gedser wind turbine generated 2.2 million [[kilowatt hour|kW-hours]] (7.9 [[Terajoule|TJ]]).&lt;ref name="Gipe1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gipe|first=Paul|title=Wind Energy Comes of Age|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8itBNxBL4igC&amp;pg=PA54|accessdate=8 February 2013|date=14 April 1995|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-471-10924-2|pages=54–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The turbine's straightforward design, safety features, and low cost were key assets. It was one of Denmark's most important innovations since the [[Second World War]]. The design served not only as a basis for developments in Denmark but was adopted by wind turbine manufacturers around the globe, who referred to it as the "Danish design".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moellearkivet.dk/egeskov-mlle23 "Gedsermøllen, Energimuseet, Bjerringbrovej 44, 8850 Bjerringbro"], Møllearkivet.dk. {{da icon}} Retrieved 3 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  Its design was considered seminal for the modern wind industry.&lt;ref name="Jamieson2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jamieson|first=Peter|title=Innovation in Wind Turbine Design|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qCAwt6Tgga4C&amp;pg=PA4|accessdate=8 February 2013|date=27 September 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-69981-2|pages=4–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, it was included in the design section of the [[Danish Culture Canon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://kum.dk/Documents/Temaer/Kulturkanon/KUM_kulturkanonen_OK2.pdf "Om kanon for design og kunstværk"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121211223858/http://kum.dk/Documents/Temaer/Kulturkanon/KUM_kulturkanonen_OK2.pdf |date=December 11, 2012 }}, Kulturkanonen. {{da icon}} Retrieved 3 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Museum exhibit==
In 1992, the turbine was dismantled. In 2006, the nacelle and the rotor blades were taken to the Energy Museum (''Energimuseet'') near [[Bjerringbro]] in central [[Jutland]] where they were reassembled as part of the museum's collection.&lt;ref name=turistnyt/&gt;

'''Gulf Publishing Company''' is an international publishing and events business dedicated to the hydrocarbon energy sector. In mid-2018 it rebranded as '''Gulf Energy Information'''. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Gulf Publishing Company - About Us |url=https://store.gulfenergyinfo.com/aboutus.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1916 by Ray Lofton Dudley, Gulf Energy Information produces and distributes publications in print and web formats, online news, webcasts and databases; hosts conferences and events designed for the energy industry. The company was a subsidiary of [[Euromoney Institutional Investor]] from 2001 until a 2016 management buyout by CEO John Royall and Texas investors. The business and strategy publication ''Petroleum Economist'' also transferred to the company in May 2016.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Gulf Publishing Company completes management buyout, marks 100-year anniversary |url=http://www.worldoil.com/news/2016/4/30/gulf-publishing-company-completes-management-buyout-marks-100-year-anniversary|date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-2017 the company acquired 109-year old Oildom Publishing. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Gulf Publishing Company acquires 109-year-old Oildom Publishing |url=https://www.worldoil.com/news/2017/5/1/gulf-publishing-company-acquires-109-year-old-oildom-publishing|date=May 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company's flagship magazines, ''World Oil,'' ''Hydrocarbon Processing'', ''Pipeline &amp; Gas Journal'', and the ''Petroleum Economist'' are published monthly. Gulf is headquartered in [[Houston, Texas]], with sales staff and columnists around the world, due to expansion efforts by William G. Dudley, Sr. The ''Petroleum Economist'' publishing and map cartography staff are based in [[London, UK]]. Gulf Energy Info's Data Services staff support on-line ''Energy Web Atlas''&lt;ref&gt;http://energywebatlas.com/&lt;/ref&gt; energy data visualization, and ''Construction Boxscore''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.constructionboxscore.com/&lt;/ref&gt; downstream project database, from Houston, London and Mumbai. 

Since 1916 ''World Oil'' has covered the upstream oil and gas industry for conventional, shale, offshore, exploration and production technology in oil and gas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldoil.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1922, ''Hydrocarbon Processing'' has provided job-relevant information to technical staff, operations, maintenance and management in petroleum refining, gas processing facilities, petrochemical and engineer/constructor companies throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hydrocarbonprocessing.com&lt;/ref&gt;  Bi-monthly supplement ''Gas Processing &amp; LNG'' was added in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://gasprocessingnews.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1934, the ''Petroleum Economist'' has written about oil, its politics and economics - explained some of the industry’s biggest disruptions: such as the 1973 oil crisis, the Gulf Wars, the rise of China, the Arab uprisings, and the more recent supply-side shocks from North America’s unconventional energy sector.&lt;ref&gt;http://petroleum-economist.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1859, ''Pipeline &amp; Gas Journal'' has been the essential resource for technology and trends in the midstream industry; written and edited to be of service to those involved in moving, marketing and managing hydrocarbons from wellheads to ultimate consumers. &lt;ref&gt;https://pgjonline.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

The company formerly published trade books, but spun off the division as TaylorWilson (now part of [[Taylor Trade]]) in 2000;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Publishing Gulf?|first=Brad |last=Tyer |url= http://www.houstonpress.com/2001-08-16/news/publishing-gulf/|newspaper= [[Houston Press]]|date=August 16, 2001 |accessdate=June 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; sold its professional book list to [[Elsevier]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/58628-elsevier-acquires-book-assets-of-gulf-publishing.html Elsevier Acquires Book Assets of Gulf Publishing]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aluminum Honecomb Sheet.jpg|thumb|An image of aluminum honeycomb structure.]]
'''Honeycomb structures''' are natural or man-made structures that have the geometry of a [[honeycomb]] to allow the minimization of the amount of used material to reach minimal weight and minimal material cost. The geometry of honeycomb structures can vary widely but the common feature of all such structures is an array of hollow cells formed between thin vertical walls. The cells are often [[column]]ar and [[hexagon]]al in shape. A honeycomb shaped structure provides a material with minimal density and relative high out-of-plane [[compression strength|compression properties]] and out-of-plane [[shear modulus|shear properties]].&lt;ref name="wahl"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wahl|first=L.|author2=Maas, S. |author3=Waldmann, D. |author4=Zurbes, A. |author5= Freres, P. |title=Shear stresses in honeycomb sandwich plates: Analytical solution, finite element method and experimental verification|journal=Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials|date=28 May 2012|volume=14|issue=4|pages=449–468|doi=10.1177/1099636212444655|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1099636212444655}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Man-made honeycomb structural materials are commonly made by layering a honeycomb material between two thin layers that provide strength in tension. This forms a plate-like assembly. Honeycomb materials are widely used where flat or slightly curved surfaces are needed and their high [[Specific strength]] is valuable. They are widely used in the [[aerospace]] industry for this reason, and honeycomb materials in aluminum, fibreglass and advanced composite materials have been featured in aircraft and rockets since the 1950s. They can also be found in many other fields, from packaging materials in the form of paper-based honeycomb cardboard, to sporting goods like skis and snowboards.

== Introduction ==
Natural honeycomb structures include [[beehive]]s, [[honeycomb weathering]] in rocks, [[tripe]], and [[bone]].

Man-made honeycomb structures include [[sandwich-structured composite]]s with honeycomb [[sandwich core|core]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krzyżak|first=Aneta|last2=Mazur|first2=Michał|last3=Gajewski|first3=Mateusz|last4=Drozd|first4=Kazimierz|last5=Komorek|first5=Andrzej|last6=Przybyłek|first6=Paweł|date=2016|title=Sandwich Structured Composites for Aeronautics: Methods of Manufacturing Affecting Some Mechanical Properties|url=https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijae/2016/7816912/|journal=International Journal of Aerospace Engineering|language=en|volume=2016|pages=1–10|doi=10.1155/2016/7816912|issn=1687-5966}}&lt;/ref&gt; Man-made honeycomb structures are manufactured by using a variety of different materials, depending on the intended application and required characteristics, from [[paper]] or [[thermoplastics]], used for low strength and stiffness for low load applications, to high strength and stiffness for high performance applications, from aluminum or fiber reinforced plastics. The strength of laminated or sandwich panels depends on the size of the panel, facing material used and the number or density of the honeycomb cells within it.  Honeycomb composites are used widely in many industries, from aerospace industries, automotive and furniture to packaging and logistics.  
The material takes its name from its visual resemblance to a bee's [[honeycomb]] – a hexagonal sheet structure.

== History ==
The hexagonal comb of the [[honey bee]] has been admired and wondered about from ancient times. The first man-made honeycomb, according to Greek mythology, is said to have been manufactured by [[Daedalus]] from gold by [[lost wax casting]] more than 3000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus, ''Library of History'', 1st century BC&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marcus Varro]] reports that the Greek geometers [[Euclid]] and [[Zenodorus (mathematician)|Zenodorus]] found that the [[hexagon]] shape makes most efficient use of space and building materials. The interior ribbing and hidden chambers in the [[dome]] of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in Rome is an early example of a honeycomb structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacDonald|1976|p=33|}} "There are openings in it [the rotunda] here and there, at various levels, that give on to some of the many different chambers that honeycomb the rotunda structure, a honeycombing that is an integral part of a sophisticated engineering solution..."&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=July 2018}}

[[Galileo Galilei]] discusses in 1638 the resistance of hollow solids: "Art, and nature even more, makes use of these in thousands of operations in which robustness is increased without adding weight, as is seen in the bones of birds and in many stalks that are light and very resistant to bending and breaking”.&lt;ref&gt;Galilei, G., ''Discorsi e dimostrazioni matematiche, intorno á due nuoue scienze'', Leiden, Elzeviers, 1638&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Robert Hooke]] discovers in 1665 that the natural cellular structure of cork is similar to the hexagonal honeybee comb.&lt;ref&gt;Hooke, R., ''Micrographia'', London, J. Martyn and J. Allestry, 1665&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Charles Darwin]] states in 1859 that "the comb of the hive-bee, as far as we can see, is absolutely perfect in economizing labour and wax”.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C., ''On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection'', London, John Murray, 1859&lt;/ref&gt;

The first paper honeycomb structures might have been made by the [[China|Chinese]] 2000 years ago for ornaments, but no reference for this has been found. Paper honeycombs and the expansion production process has been invented in Halle/Saale in Germany by Hans Heilbrun in 1901&lt;ref&gt;Heilbrun &amp; Pinner, ''Papiernetz'', DE133165, 1901&lt;/ref&gt; for decorative applications. First honeycomb structures from corrugated metal sheets had been proposed for bee keeping in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;Julius Steigel, ''Verfahren zur Herstellung von Kunstwaben'', DE57655, 1890&lt;/ref&gt; For the same purpose, as foundation sheets to harvest more honey, a honeycomb moulding process using a paper paste glue mixture had been patented in 1878.&lt;ref&gt;Küstermann, F. H., ''Künstliche Bienenwaben nebst den Instrumenten zur Herstellung derselben'', DE7031, 1879&lt;/ref&gt; The three basic techniques for honeycomb production that are still used today—expansion, corrugation and moulding—were already developed by 1901 for non-sandwich applications.

[[Hugo Junkers]] first explored the idea of a honeycomb core within a laminate structure. He proposed and patented the first honeycomb cores for aircraft application in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;Hugo Junkers, ''Abdeckung für Flugzeugtragflächen und dergleichen'', DE310040, 1915&lt;/ref&gt; He described in detail his concept to replace the fabric covered aircraft structures by metal sheets and reasoned that a metal sheet can also be loaded in compression if it is supported at very small intervals by arranging side by side a series of square or rectangular cells or triangular or hexagonal hollow bodies. The problem of bonding a continuous skin to cellular cores led Junkers later to the open corrugated structure, which could be riveted or welded together.

The first use of honeycomb structures for structural applications had been independently proposed for building application and published already in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Höfler, R. and S. Renyi, ''Plattenförmiger Baukörper'', DE355036, 1914&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934 [[Edward G. Budd]] patented a welded steel honeycomb sandwich panel from corrugated metal sheets and [[Claude Dornier]] aimed 1937 to solve the core-skin bonding problem by rolling or pressing a skin which is in a plastic state into the core cell walls.&lt;ref&gt;Dornier, C. ''Improvements in or relating to a method for the fabrication of lightweight structural members more particularly for aircraft construction'', GB515267, Dornier Metallbauten GmbH, 1937&lt;/ref&gt; The first successful structural adhesive bonding of honeycomb sandwich structures was achieved by [[Norman de Bruyne]] of [[Aero Research Limited]], who patented an adhesive with the right viscosity to form resin fillets on the honeycomb core in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uksaa-www.me.ic.ac.uk/awards.html |title=Society for Adhesion and Adhesives |publisher=Uksaa-www.me.ic.ac.uk |date=1904-11-08 |accessdate=2014-02-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019161418/http://uksaa-www.me.ic.ac.uk/awards.html |archivedate=2013-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[North American XB-70 Valkyrie]] made extensive use of [[stainless steel]] honeycomb panels using a [[brazing]] process they developed.

The three traditional honeycomb production techniques, expansion, corrugation, and moulding, were all developed by 1901 for non-sandwich applications. For decorative applications the expanded honeycomb production reached a remarkable degree of automation in the first decade of the 20th century.

Today honeycomb cores are manufactured via the expansion process and the corrugation process from [[composite materials]] such as [[glass-reinforced plastic]] (also known as fiberglass), [[carbon fiber reinforced plastic]], [[Nomex]] aramide paper reinforced plastic, or from a metal (usually [[aluminum]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hexcel.com/NR/rdonlyres/599A3453-316D-46D6-9AEE-C337D8B547CA/0/HexwebAttributesandProperties.pdf |title=Hexweb™ Honeycomb Attributes and Properties |publisher=Hexcel Composites |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601083938/http://www.hexcel.com/NR/rdonlyres/599A3453-316D-46D6-9AEE-C337D8B547CA/0/HexwebAttributesandProperties.pdf |archive-date=2010-06-01 |access-date=2006-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Honeycombs from metals (like aluminum) are today produced by the expansion process. Continuous processes of folding honeycombs from a single aluminum sheet after cutting slits had been developed already around 1920.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/US1389294], Dean, H. B. (1919). Artificial honeycomb. US1389294. USA, John D. Howe.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Continuous in-line production of metal honeycomb can be done from metal rolls by cutting and bending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lesjoforsab.com/news/news_detail.asp?nyhetsid=190&amp;sprakid=2 |title=Lesjöfors develops tool for Ericsson invention |publisher=Lesjoforsab.com |accessdate=2014-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thermoplastic honeycomb cores (usually from [[polypropylene]]) are usually made by extrusion processed via a block of extruded profiles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&lt;!-- Nidaplast Corporation--&gt; Nidaplast Corporation |url=http://www.nidaplast.com/en |title=Nidaplast Environment and Composites, creation of polypropylene honeycomb products |publisher=Nidaplast.com |date=2013-11-08 |accessdate=2014-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; or extruded tubes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tubus-waben.com |title=Tubus-Waben |publisher=Tubus Waben |accessdate=2014-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plascore.com/ |title=Honeycomb Cores – Honeycomb Panels Products |publisher=Plascore |accessdate=2014-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; from which the honeycomb sheets are sliced.
   
Recently a new, unique process to produce thermoplastic honeycombs has been implemented, allowing a continuous production of a honeycomb core as well as in-line production of honeycombs with direct lamination of skins into cost efficient sandwich panel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.econcore.com |title=EconCore NV |publisher=EconCore.com |accessdate=2014-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, a wide variety of materials can be formed into a honeycomb composite.  For example [[paperboard]] honeycomb is used in [[paper pallet]]s and package [[cushioning]], blocking and bracing.&lt;ref name=Bitzer &gt;Bitzer, T (1997). ''Honeycomb Technology: Materials, Design, Manufacturing, Applications and Testing'', London: Chapman &amp; Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
Composite honeycomb structures have been used in numerous engineering and scientific applications.

More recent developments show that honeycomb structures are also advantageous in applications involving nanohole arrays in [[anodized alumina]],&lt;ref name=Masuda&gt;Masuda, H. and Fukuda, K., (1995), Ordered metal nanohole arrays made by a two-step replication of honeycomb structures of anodic alumina, Science, 268(5216), p. 1466.&lt;/ref&gt; [[microporous array]]s in [[polymer]] [[thin film]]s,&lt;ref name=Yabu&gt;Yabu, H. and Takebayashi, M. and Tanaka, M. and Shimomura, M., 2005, Superhydrophobic and lipophobic properties of self-organized honeycomb and pincushion structures, Langmuir, 21(8), pp. 3235–3237.&lt;/ref&gt; [[activated carbon]] honeycombs,&lt;ref name=Gadkaree&gt;Gadkaree, KP, (1998), Carbon honeycomb structures for adsorption applications, Carbon, 36(7–8), pp. 981–989.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[photonic band gap]] honeycomb structures.&lt;ref name=Broeng&gt;Broeng, J. and Barkou, S.E. and Bjarklev, A. and Knight, J.C. and Birks, T.A. and Russell, P.S.J., (1998), Highly increased photonic band gaps in silica/air structures, Optics Communications, 156(4–6), pp. 240–244.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aerodynamics ==
[[File:Langley First Wind Tunnel - GPN-2000-001296.jpg|thumb|Honeycombed, screened center for Langley's first wind tunnel]]
A honeycomb [[mesh]] is often used in [[aerodynamics]] to reduce or to create wind [[turbulence]]. It is also used to obtain a standard profile in a [[wind tunnel]] (temperature, flow speed). A major factor in choosing the right mesh is the length ratio (length vs honeycomb cell diameter) ''L/d''.

Length ratio &lt; 1:
Honeycomb meshes of low length ratio can be used on vehicles front [[grille]]. Beside the aesthetic reasons, these meshes are used as screens to get a uniform profile and to reduce the intensity of turbulence.&lt;ref name="WTdesi"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-htgl.stanford.edu/bradshaw/tunnel/honeycomb.html |title=Honeycomb |work=Wind Tunnel Design |last=Bradshaw |first=Peter |last2=Mehta |first2=Rabi |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902183558/http://www-htgl.stanford.edu/bradshaw/tunnel/honeycomb.html |archive-date=2011-09-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Length ratio &gt;&gt; 1:
Honeycomb meshes of large length ratio reduce lateral turbulence and [[eddy (fluid dynamics)|eddies]] of the flow. Early wind tunnels used them with no screens; unfortunately, this method introduced high turbulence intensity in the test section. Most modern tunnels use both honeycomb and screens.

While aluminium honeycombs are common use in the industry, other materials are offered for specific applications. People using metal structures should take care of removing [[Burr (edge)|burrs]] as they can introduce additional turbulences. [[Polycarbonate]] structures are a low-cost alternative.

The honeycombed, screened center of this open-circuit air intake for Langley's first wind tunnel ensured a steady, non-turbulent flow of air. Two mechanics pose near the entrance end of the actual tunnel, where air was pulled into the test section through a honeycomb arrangement to smooth the flow.

Honeycomb is not the only cross-section available in order to reduce eddies in an airflow. Square, rectangular, circular and hexagonal cross-sections are other choices available, although honeycomb is generally the preferred choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=Bright Hub |url=http://www.brighthub.com/environment/renewable-energy/articles/19131.aspx |title=Components of a Wind Tunnel |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120204331/http://www.brighthub.com/environment/renewable-energy/articles/19131.aspx |archive-date=2010-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Properties ==
[[File:CompositeSandwich.png|thumb|A composite sandwich panel (A) with honeycomb core (C) and face sheets (B)]]
In combination with two skins applied on the honeycomb, the structure offers a sandwich panel with excellent rigidity at minimal weight. The behavior of the honeycomb structures is [[Orthotropic material|orthotropic]], meaning the panels react differently depending on the orientation of the structure. It is therefore necessary to distinguish between the directions of [[symmetry]], the so-called L and W-direction. The L-direction is the strongest and the stiffest direction. The weakest direction is at 60° from the L-direction (in the case of a regular [[hexagon]]) and the most compliant direction is the W-direction.&lt;ref name="wahl" /&gt;
Another important property of honeycomb sandwich core is its compression strength. Due to the efficient hexagonal configuration, where walls support each other, compression strength of honeycomb cores is typically higher (at same weight) compared to other sandwich core structures such as, for instance, foam cores or corrugated cores.

The mechanical properties of honeycombs depend on its cell geometry, the properties of the material from which the honeycomb is constructed (often referred to as the solid), which include the Young's modulus, yield stress, and fracture stress of the material, and the relative density of the honeycomb (the density of the honeycomb normalized by that of the solid, ρ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;/ρ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Cellular materials in nature and medicine |last=Gibson |first=Lorna J. |date=2010 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |last2=Ashby |first2=M.F. |last3=Harley |first3=Brendan A. |isbn=9780521195447 |location=Cambridge |oclc=607986408}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Mechanical behavior of materials |last=Courtney |first=Thomas H. |date=2000 |publisher=McGraw Hill |isbn=0070285942 |edition=2nd |location=Boston |oclc=41932585}}&lt;/ref&gt; The elastic moduli of low-density honeycombs have been found to be independent of the solid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Torquato|first=S.|last2=Gibiansky|first2=L.V.|last3=Silva|first3=M.J.|last4=Gibson|first4=L.J.|date=January 1998|title=Effective mechanical and transport properties of cellular solids|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0020740397000313|journal=International Journal of Mechanical Sciences|volume=40|issue=1|pages=71–82|doi=10.1016/s0020-7403(97)00031-3|issn=0020-7403|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanical properties of honeycombs will also vary based on the direction in which the load is applied.

In-plane loading: Under in-plane loading, it is often assumed that the wall thickness of the honeycomb is small compared to the length of the wall. For a regular honeycomb, the relative density is proportional to the wall thickness to wall length ratio (t/L) and the Young’s modulus is proportional to (t/L)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Under high enough compressive load, the honeycomb reaches a critical stress and fails due to one of the following mechanisms – elastic buckling, plastic yielding, or brittle crushing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The mode of failure is dependent on the material of the solid which the honeycomb is made of. Elastic buckling of the cell walls is the mode of failure for elastomeric materials &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;, ductile materials fail due to plastic yielding, and brittle crushing is the mode of failure when the solid is brittle.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The elastic buckling stress is proportional to the relative density cubed, plastic collapse stress is proportional to relative density squared, and brittle crushing stress is proportional to relative density squared.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Following the critical stress and failure of the material, a plateau stress is observed in the material, in which increases in strain are observed while the stress of the honeycomb remains roughly constant.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Once a certain strain is reached, the material will begin to undergo densification as further compression pushes the cell walls together.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Out of-plane loading: Under out-of-plane loading, the out-of-plane Young’s modulus of a regular hexagonal honeycombs is proportional to the relative density of the honeycomb.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The elastic buckling stress is proportional to (t/L)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; while the plastic buckling stress is proportional to (t/L)&lt;sup&gt;5/3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The shape of the honeycomb cell is often varied to meet different engineering applications. Shapes that are commonly used besides the regular hexagonal cell include triangular cells, square cells, and circular-cored hexagonal cells, and circular-cored square cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Qiancheng|last2=Yang|first2=Xiaohu|last3=Li|first3=Peng|last4=Huang|first4=Guoyou|last5=Feng|first5=Shangsheng|last6=Shen|first6=Cheng|last7=Han|first7=Bin|last8=Zhang|first8=Xiaohui|last9=Jin|first9=Feng|date=October 2015|title=Bioinspired engineering of honeycomb structure – Using nature to inspire human innovation|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0079642515000377|journal=Progress in Materials Science|volume=74|pages=332–400|doi=10.1016/j.pmatsci.2015.05.001|issn=0079-6425|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relative densities of these cells will depend on their new geometry.

The '''Hongcheng Magic Liquid incident'''&lt;ref name="csicop" /&gt; was a [[fraud|scam]] in China where Wang Hongcheng ({{zh|c=王洪成|p=Wáng Hóngchéng}}), a bus driver from [[Harbin]] with no scientific education,&lt;ref name="science" /&gt; claimed in 1983 that he could turn regular water into a fuel as flammable as petrol by simply dissolving a few drops of his liquid in it.&lt;ref name="csicop" /&gt;&lt;ref name="science" /&gt; He founded the Hongcheng Magic Liquid company with funds from Chinese governmental agencies&lt;ref name="csicop" /&gt;&lt;ref name="haunted" /&gt; and other supporters, raising a total of 300 million [[CNY|yuan]] (US$37 million),&lt;ref name="daily" /&gt;&lt;ref name="guangming" /&gt; but no product was ever released.&lt;ref name="csicop" /&gt;&lt;ref name="science" /&gt;

Around that time, in 1994, the Chinese Government, alarmed by an increase in [[pseudoscience]] and [[superstition]]s since the death of [[Mao Zedong]], made a declaration decrying the deterioration of science education in the country, taking several measures to improve science education and to improve the prevalence of science and technology in courts.&lt;ref name="science" /&gt;&lt;ref name="haunted" /&gt;&lt;ref name="science2" /&gt; One of these efforts was to require the scientific authoritative journal ''[[Science and Technology Daily]]'' to carry an article critical of Hongcheng's invention, which had been previously rejected at several major Chinese publications.&lt;ref name="science" /&gt; This created a growing publicity and opposition of Hongcheng's invention, silencing his supporters.&lt;ref name="science" /&gt;

In 1995 Hongcheng refused an invitation to carry a scientific appraisal of his invention at Beijing, and the notable scientist and debunker [[He Zuoxiu]] and 40 other scientists made a statement calling for the Chinese Government to investigate his claims.&lt;ref name="science" /&gt; Hongcheng was eventually arrested, put to trial, and in 1998, was found guilty of fraud and deceit and condemned to 10&amp;nbsp;years of prison.&lt;ref name="csicop" /&gt;&lt;ref name="daily" /&gt;&lt;ref name="guangming" /&gt;

==Invention and initial experiments==
Wang Hongcheng was a bus driver from [[Harbin]], a former soldier with ninth-grade education&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Meaning that he was schooled until the age of 14 or 15&amp;nbsp;years old. The magazine stating this is from the US, "ninth-grade" in the US corresponds to the first year of [[High school#United States|High school]]&lt;/ref&gt; and no scientific training.&lt;ref name="science" /&gt; In 1983 he claimed that he invented a liquid that could transform a liter of regular water into a fuel by simply adding two or three drops of his liquid, and that this resulting fuel was as combustible as petrol.&lt;ref name="csicop" /&gt;&lt;ref name="science" /&gt; Hongcheng called it "the fifth greatest invention of China", in a reference to the [[four Great Inventions]] of China, and his invention became more popular, finally reaching on 28 January 1993 the front pages of a major national newspaper.&lt;ref name="interview" /&gt; In the winter of 1985, Wang showed this technique in Beijing, Hebei, [[Zhejiang]] and Shanghai.

==Hongcheng Magic Liquid company==
The Chinese security and military departments started to look into his claims and funded his research.&lt;ref name="csicop" /&gt;&lt;ref name="haunted"&gt;From a Carl Sagan article, the same text also appeared verbatim in his book [[The Demon-Haunted World]]

==Chinese Government reaction and repercussions==

In 1994 the Chinese Government was alarmed by a recent raise in pseudoscience and a revival of old superstition, and issued a declaration declaring the rise of superstition and ignorance, how the science education had declined among the population, and how it would make efforts to combat this situation.&lt;ref name="science" /&gt;&lt;ref name="haunted" /&gt;&lt;ref name="science2" /&gt; After this declaration, [[Song Jian]], then chief director of the Chinese [[National Science Committee]], held a conference on how to carry this work among the public.&lt;ref name="interview" /&gt; Song Jian was then told at the conference was that an article [[debunking]] Hongcheng's invention had been refused publication in three major national newspapers and one scientific publication.&lt;ref name="interview" /&gt; Song Jian then required ''[[Science and Technology Daily]]'', the most authoritative newspaper in China's science and technology,&lt;ref name="chinaculture"&gt;[http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_aboutchina/2003-09/24/content_23434.htm Science and Technology Daily] chinaculture.org&lt;/ref&gt; to publish it.&lt;ref name="interview" /&gt; This publication explained that when Hongcheng's invention hit newspaper front pages in 1993, different newspapers reported different proportions of oil and water in their announcements, and used this to make a critical analysis.&lt;ref name="interview" /&gt; It publicized the invention, started an opposition feeling, and silenced Hongcheng and their supporters.&lt;ref name="science" /&gt;

==Fraud conviction==
After the public backlash caused by He&amp;nbsp;Zuoxiu's article, the Chinese people started to realize that Hongcheng's "technique" was a fraud. Hongcheng faced growing criticism from scientists and media.&lt;ref name="science" /&gt; He&amp;nbsp;Zuoxiu, a member of the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] as well a notable scientist and debunker, had been invited several times by Hongcheng's supporters to visit the northeast and watch his invention in action. In 1995, Zuoxiu asked them to Beijing to pass a scientific appraisal of his liquid, as the country capital would be a proper place for such a scientific and universal invention.&lt;ref name="science" /&gt;&lt;ref name="guangming" /&gt;&lt;ref name="interview" /&gt; Hongcheng refused, prompting Zuoxiu and a group of other 40 scientists to ask the top Chinese legislative body, the [[People's Political Consultative Conference]], to investigate his claims.&lt;ref name="science" /&gt; After this declaration, his invention collapsed by itself,&lt;ref name="interview" /&gt; and it was finally found that it was a fraud.&lt;ref name="haunted" /&gt;

In 1998 he was found guilty of fraud and deceit and sent to prison for 10 years&lt;ref name="csicop"&gt;{{cite web|title=Paranormal in China |author=Wu Xianghong |work=Skeptical Briefs newsletter |publisher=[[CSICOP]] |date=March 2005 |url=http://www.csicop.org/sb/9503/china.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121210512/http://www.csicop.org/sb/9503/china.html |archivedate=21 November 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="daily"&gt;{{cite news | title = From scientist to 'science policeman' | work = [[China Daily]] | author = Jia Hepeng | date = 18 August 2005 | accessdate = 8 November 2008 | url = http://www.xys.org/xys/netters/Fang-Zhouzi/interview/chinadaily3.txt }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guangming"&gt;{{cite news | script-title=zh:王洪成被判刑十年 | work = [[Guangming Daily (China)|Guangming Daily]] | date = 29 May 1998 | url = http://www.gmw.cn/01wzb/1998-03/29/GB/1530%5EWZ1-2920.htm | language = Chinese | quote = Wang Hongcheng is given 10-year imprisonment for defrauding 300 million yuan }} (online translation [https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=es&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gmw.cn%2F01wzb%2F1998-03%2F29%2FGB%2F1530%255EWZ1-2920.htm&amp;sl=zh-CN&amp;tl=en&amp;history_state0=])&lt;/ref&gt; Hongcheng acquired the status of a legendary figure, because some people thought that it was a case of [[cover-up]] or of [[free energy suppression]], where he would be imprisoned not because his formula would not really work, but because of refusing to release his secret formula to the government.&lt;ref name="csicop" /&gt;&lt;ref name="haunted" /&gt;

==Political and cultural context==
The Chinese Government were alarmed by this and other similar cases of promotion of pseudoscience even before Hongcheng's refusal to carry a scientific appraisal at Beijing and the publicity it carried.&lt;ref name="science" /&gt;&lt;ref name="science2"&gt;{{cite journal | journal = [[Science (magazine)|Science]] | title = China Tightens Appraisal System | author = [[Ted Plakfer]] | date = 7 April 1995 | pages = 23–24 | volume = 268 | issue = 5207 | doi = 10.1126/science.268.5207.23 | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/268/5207/23.pdf | pmid = 17755222 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese government decided to tighten the appraisal system for scientific claims and other measures like creating science and technology courts.&lt;ref name="science" /&gt;&lt;ref name="haunted" /&gt;&lt;ref name="science2" /&gt; After the death of Mao Zedong, several Western pseudoscience theories appeared in rural areas, together with the return to [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient China]] practices like [[Ancestor Veneration in China|ancestor worship]], [[Chinese astrology|astrology]] and [[Fortune telling#Asian fortune telling|fortune telling]]. The government newspaper had lamented "the superstition of [[Examples of feudalism#China|feudal]] ideology is raising again in the Chinese countryside".&lt;ref name="haunted" /&gt;&lt;ref group="n"&gt;The [[Cultural revolution#Effect|effects of the recent Cultural Revolution]] had caused almost a generation to receive incomplete or no education, had reduced the literacy rates severely, and had killed or driven away many [[intellectuals]].&lt;/ref&gt; Individual claiming to have "special powers" claimed that they project their [[Qi]] out of their body to cure people, and called "masters of [[Qigong|Qi Gong]]", one of them being arrested after causing the death of several patients. The [[Asian Rhinoceros]] was being driven to extinction because pulverized [[Rhinoceros horn#Rhinoceros horns|Rhinoceros horn]] were said to prevent [[impotence]],&lt;ref name="haunted" /&gt; despite the fact that Rhinoceros horn is composed of [[keratin]], the same substance that is present in [[human hair]] and [[fingernails]].

To address all these issues, the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|government of China]] and the [[Chinese Communist Party]] made on 5 December 1994 a joint public declaration called "Some Suggestions on How to Reinforce the Popularization of Science". In it they lamented the recent withering of public education and the growth of pseudoscience and anti-science ideas, and then indicated that they would reinforce the public education about science.&lt;ref name="haunted" /&gt;&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;{{cite news | work = China Information Newspaper | title = An interview with He Zuoxiu: How he exposes and fights against Falun Gong | date = 20 August 1999 | author = Zhang Pengwen | url = http://www.facts.org.cn/Views/200801/t75537.htm |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120218165702/http://www.facts.org.cn/Views/200801/t75537.htm |archivedate= 18 February 2012 }} hosted at facts.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Most officials support the effort to root out [[pseudoscience]] in China, although the government still sends occasionally mixed signals, like one incident when a high-ranking official ordered the [[Guangming Daily (China)|Guangming Daily]] to pull a letter critical of Hongcheng at the last minute.&lt;ref name="science" /&gt; He Zuoxiu explains that corruption will also have to be fought at the same time as pseudoscience, since some officials and journalists may "have a stake" in these inventions, and would be harmed by their exposure.&lt;ref name="science" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5235">'''Horsham Stone''' is a type of calcerous, flaggy [[sandstone]] containing millions of minute sand grains and occurring naturally in the [[Wealden]] clay of the English county of [[West Sussex]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Sussex Stone, The Story of Horsham Stone and Sussex Marble, Roger Birch, 2006, {{ISBN|978-0-9551259-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brandon31"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brandon|first=Peter|title=The Kent &amp; Sussex Weald|publisher=Phillimore &amp; Co. Ltd|location=Chichester|year=2003|isbn=1-86077-241-2|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also high in [[mica]] and [[quartz]]. The rock extends in an arc-like formation for several kilometres around the town of [[Horsham]] from which it takes its name, and lies just below the Wealden clay surface in bands {{convert|4|to|5|in|cm}} thick.&lt;ref name="Brandon31"/&gt; Horsham Stone is significant for its ripple-marked appearance, formed by the action of the sea similar to the ripples on the sandbanks and beaches of Sussex.
[[File:Horsham Stone.jpg|thumb|Horsham Stone]]

==Formation==
[[File:Carfax Horsham West Sussex England - Horsham Stone tiled roof 1.jpg|thumb|Horsham Stone tiled roof in the Carfax, Horsham]]
Sussex Stone and its limestone equivalent [[Sussex Marble]] were formed around 130 million years ago in the Lower Cretaceous period when Britain was quite different from the shape it is today. It is estimated that the latitude for Britain was approximately [[30th parallel north|30 degrees north]] of the equator.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The fossil evidence in Horsham Stone and Sussex Marble indicate a diversity of life living on a broad, flat subtropical landscape.Towards the end of the [[Cretaceous period]] around 90 million years ago, most of Britain including Sussex would have been submerged beneath a tropical sea that was depositing [[chalk]]. 

The sediments of the Wealden Basin were buried under hundreds of metres of further sediment over the next 100 million years and were then uplifted gradually by platetonic movement and then eroded to expose Wealden rocks. Horsham Stone would have been visible to early settlers after the Ice Age around 12,000 years ago.  When quarried, Horsham Stone could be extracted in "flat grey slabs of varying thickness".&lt;ref name="Brandon31"/&gt;

==Uses of Horsham Stone==
[[File:Coombes church.jpg|thumb|right|[[Coombes Church]] in West Sussex is roofed with Horsham Stone.&lt;ref name="Pé46"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pé|first=Diana|title=Mid Sussex Church Walks|publisher=PP (Pé Publishing)|year=2006|isbn=0-9543690-2-5|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Horsham Stone has a long history of use. The earliest record is from the [[Bronze Age]]. Archeologists at [[Amberley, West Sussex|Amberley]] found [[quern]] fragments made of Horsham Stone at Amberley Mount.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  It was used extensively by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] including in the construction of [[Stane Street (Chichester)|Stane Street]]. Villas such as [[Bignor Roman Villa|Bignor]] and [[Fishbourne Roman Palace|Fishbourne]] have examples of flooring and roof slates of the material. 

In later centuries, and there are numerous examples in Sussex and the surrounding counties of its use as a roofing material, particularly for mills, [[dovecote]]s, churches, [[manor house]]s and similar buildings.  Completely rainproof and long-lasting, it was ideal for these structures.&lt;ref name="Brandon31"/&gt;  Smaller-scale uses include road surfaces, for which the thickest slabs were typically used;&lt;ref name="Brandon31"/&gt; the footpaths leading to St Mary's Church, [[Shipley, West Sussex|Shipley]], West Sussex and the north wall of St Nicholas' Church, [[Itchingfield]], West Sussex; and for gravestones, fonts and tombs (of which there are several examples at [[St Mary the Virgin's Church, Horsham]]).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Once exposed it hardens quickly and will last for hundreds of years. The characteristic ripple marks are retained.  There are numerous old quarry workings throughout Sussex but just one working quarry in 2018.  Large quarries at [[Nuthurst]] and Stammerham (near [[Christ's Hospital]]) school are no longer extant, but others survive in isolated Wealden settings.&lt;ref name="Brandon31"/&gt;

==Commercial use in the early 21st century==
[[File:Cottage in Nuthurst village, West Sussex England 2.jpg|thumb|Cottage with Horsham stone roof in Nuthurst]]
Large-scale commercial extraction of Horsham stone had stopped by the 1880s,&lt;ref name="Brandon32"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brandon|first=Peter|title=The Kent &amp; Sussex Weald|publisher=Phillimore &amp; Co. Ltd|location=Chichester|year=2003|isbn=1-86077-241-2|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; and regular quarrying ceased completely in the 1930s with the closure of a small quarry at Nowhurst, Strood Green near Horsham.  [[Purbeck Stone]] was regarded as a good substitute for Horsham Stone and repairs to stonework tended to substitute it for the more expensive and scarcer Horsham Stone.  The Nowhurst quarry was reopened in 2004 by the Historic Horsham Stone Company. It has started producing roofing slates for the area's historic houses.

'''Hydrogen isocyanide''' is a chemical with the molecular formula HNC. It is a minor [[tautomer]] of [[hydrogen cyanide]] (HCN). Its importance in the field of [[astrochemistry]] is linked to its ubiquity in the [[interstellar medium]].

== Nomenclature ==

Both ''hydrogen isocyanide'' and ''azanylidyniummethanide'' are correct [[IUPAC name]]s for HNC. There is no [[preferred IUPAC name]]. The second one is according to the ''[[substitutive nomenclature]] rules'', derived from the ''[[parent hydride]]'' [[azane]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and the anion [[methanide]] (C&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;The suffix ''ylidyne'' refers to the loss of three hydrogen atoms from the nitrogen atom in [[azanium]] ({{chem|NH|4|+}}) See the [http://www.iupac.org/publications/books/rbook/Red_Book_2005.pdf ''IUPAC Red Book'' 2005] Table III, "Suffixes and endings", p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Molecular properties==

Hydrogen isocyanide (HNC) is a linear triatomic molecule with C&lt;sub&gt;∞v&lt;/sub&gt; [[Molecular symmetry|point group symmetry]]. It is a [[zwitterion]] and an [[isomer]] of [[hydrogen cyanide]] (HCN).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pau|first=Chin Fong|last2=Hehre|first2=Warren J.|date=1982-02-01|title=Heat of formation of hydrogen isocyanide by ion cyclotron double resonance spectroscopy|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/j100392a006|journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry|volume=86|issue=3|pages=321–322|doi=10.1021/j100392a006|issn=0022-3654}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both HNC and HCN have large, similar [[Molecular dipole moment|dipole moment]]s, with ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;HNC&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3.05 [[Debye]] and ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;HCN&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2.98 Debye respectively.&lt;ref name="Tennekes2006"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tennekes, P.

=== HNC−HCN tautomerism ===
As HNC is higher in energy than HCN by 3920&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (46.9&amp;nbsp; kJ/mol), one might assume that the two would have an equilibrium ratio&lt;math display="inline"&gt;\left ( \frac{[HNC]}{[HCN]} \right )_{eq}&lt;/math&gt; at temperatures below 100 Kelvin of 10&lt;sup&gt;−25&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hirota, T.|first=|display-authors=etal|date=|year=1998|title=Abundances of HCN and HNC in Dark Cloud Cores|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/306032/fulltext/|journal=Astrophysical Journal|volume=503|issue=2|pages=717–728|bibcode=1998ApJ...503..717H|doi=10.1086/306032|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, observations show a very different conclusion; &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\left ( \frac{[HNC]}{[HCN]} \right )_{observed}&lt;/math&gt; is much higher than 10&lt;sup&gt;−25&lt;/sup&gt;, and is in fact on the order of unity in cold environments. This is because of the potential energy path of the tautomerization reaction; there is an activation barrier on the order of roughly 12,000&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; for the tautomerization to occur, which corresponds to a temperature at which HNC would already have been destroyed by neutral-neutral reactions.&lt;ref name="Bentley1993"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bentley, J.

==Spectral properties==

In practice, HNC is almost exclusively observed astronomically using the ''J''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1→0 transition. This transition occurs at ~90.66&amp;nbsp;GHz, which is a point of good visibility in the [[Radio window|atmospheric window]], thus making astronomical observations of HNC particularly simple. Many other related species (including HCN) are observed in roughly the same window.&lt;ref name=Schilke1992&gt;{{cite journal|author=Schilke, P.|first=|display-authors=etal|date=|year=1992|title=A study of HCN, HNC and their isotopomers in OMC-1.

==Significance in the interstellar medium==

HNC is intricately linked to the formation and destruction of numerous other molecules of importance in the interstellar medium—aside from the obvious partners HCN, [[HCNH+|protonated hydrogen cyanide (HCNH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)]], and [[Cyanide|cyanide (CN)]], HNC is linked to the abundances of many other compounds, either directly or through a few degrees of separation. As such, an understanding of the chemistry of HNC leads to an understanding of countless other species—HNC is an integral piece in the complex puzzle representing interstellar chemistry.

Furthermore, HNC (alongside HCN) is a commonly used tracer of dense gas in molecular clouds. Aside from the potential to use HNC to investigate [[gravitational collapse]] as the means of star formation, HNC abundance (relative to the abundance of other nitrogenous molecules) can be used to determine the evolutionary stage of protostellar cores.&lt;ref name="Tennekes2006" /&gt;

The HCO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/HNC line ratio is used to good effect as a measure of density of gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Loenen, A. F.|display-authors=etal|year=2007|title=Molecular properties of (U)LIRGs: CO, HCN, HNC and HCO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;|journal=Proceedings IAU Symposium|volume=242|issue=|pages=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This information provides great insight into the mechanisms of the formation of (Ultra-)Luminous Infrared Galaxies ((U)LIRGs), as it provides data on the nuclear environment, [[star formation]], and even [[black hole]] fueling. Furthermore, the HNC/HCN line ratio is used to distinguish between [[Photodissociation region|photodissociation regions]] and X-ray-dissociation regions on the basis that [HNC]/[HCN] is roughly unity in the former, but greater than unity in the latter.

The study of HNC is a relatively simple pursuit, and this is one of the greatest motivations for its study.  Aside from having its ''J''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1→0 transition in a clear portion of the atmospheric window, as well as having numerous isotopomers also available for easy study, and in addition to having a large dipole moment that makes observations particularly simple, HNC is, in its molecular nature, a quite simple molecule. This makes the study of the reaction pathways that lead to its formation and destruction a good means of obtaining insight to the workings of these reactions in space. Furthermore, the study of the tautomerization of HNC to HCN (and vice versa), which has been studied extensively, has been suggested as a model by which more complicated isomerization reactions can be studied.&lt;ref name="Bentley1993" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Skurski, P.|display-authors=etal|year=2001|title=''Ab initio'' electronic structure of HCN&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; and HNC&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; dipole-bound anions and a description of electron loss upon tautomerization|journal=J.

==Chemistry in the interstellar medium==

Its abundance is closely linked to the abundances of other nitrogen-containing compounds.&lt;ref name="Turner1997"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Turner, B.

These four reactions are merely the four most dominant, and thus the most significant in the formation of the HNC abundances in dense molecular clouds; there are dozens more reactions for the formation and destruction of HNC. Though these reactions primarily lead to various protonated species, HNC is linked closely to the abundances of many other nitrogen containing molecules, for example, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and CN.&lt;ref name="Turner1997" /&gt; The abundance HNC is also inexorably linked to the abundance of HCN, and the two tend to exist in a specific ratio based on the environment.&lt;ref name="Hiraoka2006" /&gt; This is because the reactions that form HNC can often also form HCN, and vice versa, depending on the conditions in which the reaction occurs, and also that there exist isomerization reactions for the two species.

==Astronomical detections==

HCN (not HNC) was first detected in June 1970 by L. E. Snyder and D. Buhl using the 36-foot radio telescope of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Snyder, L. E.|author2=Buhl, D.|year=1971|title=Observations of Radio Emission from Interstellar Hydrogen Cyanide|journal=Astrophysical Journal|volume=163|issue=|pages=L47–L52|bibcode=1971ApJ...163L..47S|doi=10.1086/180664}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main molecular isotope, H&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N, was observed via its ''J''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1→0 transition at 88.6&amp;nbsp;GHz in six different sources: W3 (OH), Orion&amp;nbsp;A, Sgr&amp;nbsp;A(NH3A), W49, W51, DR&amp;nbsp;21(OH). A secondary molecular isotope, H&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N, was observed via its ''J''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1→0 transition at 86.3&amp;nbsp;GHz in only two of these sources: Orion A and Sgr A(NH3A). HCN was then later detected extragalactically in 1988 using the [[IRAM 30-m]] telescope at the [[Veleta (Sierra Nevada)|Pico de Veleta]] in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Henkel, C.|display-authors=etal|year=1988|title=Molecules in external galaxies: the detection of CN, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H, and HNC, and the tentative detection of HC&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N|journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=201|issue=|pages=L23–L26|bibcode=1988A&amp;A...201L..23H}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was observed via its ''J''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1→0 transition at 90.7&amp;nbsp;GHz toward IC&amp;nbsp;342.

A number of detections have been made towards the end of confirming the temperature dependence of the abundance ratio of [HNC]/[HCN]. A strong fit between temperature and the abundance ratio would allow observers to [[Spectroscopy|spectroscopically]] detect the ratio and then extrapolate the temperature of the environment, thus gaining great insight into the environment of the species. The abundance ratio of rare isotopes of HNC and HCN along the OMC-1 varies by more than an order of magnitude in warm regions versus cold regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Goldsmith, P. F.|display-authors=etal|year=1986|title=Variations in the HCN/HNC Abundance Ratio in the Orion Molecular Cloud|journal=Astrophysical Journal|volume=310|issue=|pages=383–391|bibcode=1986ApJ...310..383G|doi=10.1086/164692}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the abundances of HNC, HCN, and deuterated analogs along the OMC-1 ridge and core were measured and the temperature dependence of the abundance ratio was confirmed.&lt;ref name=Schilke1992 /&gt; A survey of the W&amp;nbsp;3 Giant Molecular Cloud in 1997 showed over 24 different molecular isotopes, comprising over 14 distinct chemical species, including HNC, HN&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C, and H&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;NC. This survey further confirmed the temperature dependence of the abundance ratio, [HNC]/[HCN], this time ever confirming the dependence of the isotopomers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Helmich, F. P.|author2=van Dishoeck, E. F.|year=1997|title=Physical and chemical variations within the W3 star-forming region|journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=124|issue=|pages=205–253|bibcode=1997A&amp;AS..124..205H|doi=10.1051/aas:1997357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These are not the only detections of importance of HNC in the interstellar medium. In 1997, HNC was observed along the TMC-1 ridge and its abundance relative to HCO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; was found to be constant along the ridge—this led credence to the reaction pathway that posits that HNC is derived initially from HCO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Pratap1997" /&gt; One significant astronomical detection that demonstrated the practical use of observing HNC occurred in 2006, when abundances of various nitrogenous compounds (including HN&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C and H&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;NC) were used to determine the stage of evolution of the protostellar core Cha-MMS1 based on the relative magnitudes of the abundances.&lt;ref name="Tennekes2006" /&gt;

On 11 August 2014, astronomers released studies, using the [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array|Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA)]] for the first time, that detailed the distribution of [[Hydrogen cyanide|HCN]], HNC, [[Formaldehyde|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO]], and [[dust]] inside the [[Coma (cometary)|comae]] of [[comet]]s [[C/2012 F6 (Lemmon)]] and [[Comet ISON|C/2012 S1 (ISON)]].&lt;ref name="NASA-20140811"&gt;{{cite web |last=Zubritsky |first=Elizabeth |last2=Neal-Jones |first2=Nancy |title=RELEASE 14-038 - NASA’s 3-D Study of Comets Reveals Chemical Factory at Work |url=http://www.nasa.gov/press/2014/august/goddard/nasa-s-3-d-study-of-comets-reveals-chemical-factory-at-work |date=11 August 2014 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=12 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AJL-20140811"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cordiner, M.A.|title=Mapping the Release of Volatiles in the Inner Comae of Comets C/2012 F6 (Lemmon) and C/2012 S1 (ISON) Using the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array |url=http://iopscience.iop.org/2041-8205/792/1/L2/article |date=11 August 2014 |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]] |volume=792 |number=1  |doi=10.1088/2041-8205/792/1/L2 |accessdate=12 August 2014 |display-authors=etal|arxiv=1408.2458|bibcode=2014ApJ...792L...2C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''hydrogen maser''', also known as hydrogen [[frequency standard]], is a specific type of [[maser]] that uses the intrinsic properties of the [[hydrogen]] atom to serve as a precision frequency reference.

Both the proton and electron of a hydrogen atom have spins.  The atom has a higher energy if both are spinning in the same direction, and a lower energy if they spin in opposite directions. The amount of energy needed to reverse the spin of the electron is equivalent to a photon at the frequency of {{nowrap|{{formatnum:1420405751.786}} [[hertz]] (Hz)}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.nist.gov/pml/div688/grp40/enc-h.cfm |title= Time and Frequency from A to Z: H |work= Physics Laboratory |publisher= [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]] |at= Hydrogen Maser |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate= 2010-04-06 |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which corresponds to the [[Hydrogen line|21&amp;nbsp;cm line]] in hydrogen spectrum.

Hydrogen masers are very complex devices and sell for as much as {{nowrap|US${{formatnum:235000}}}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.symmttm.com/document-portal/doc_view/133261-mhm-2010|title=MHM 2010 Active Hydrogen Maser Data Sheet|format=PDF|publisher=[[Symmetricom]]|year=2014|accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are made in two types: active and passive.

In both types, a small storage bottle of [[molecular hydrogen]], H{{sub|2}}, leaks a controlled amount of gas into a discharge bulb. The molecules are dissociated in the discharge bulb into individual hydrogen atoms by an arc. This [[atomic hydrogen]] passes through a [[collimator]] and a magnetic state selector. The atoms are thereby selected for the desired state and passed on to a storage bulb. The storage bulb is roughly 20&amp;nbsp;cm high and 10&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter and made of [[quartz]].  Its inside is coated with [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|Teflon]], allowing many collisions of the atoms with the wall without perturbation of the atomic state, and slowing the recombination of the hydrogen atoms into hydrogen molecules. A durable Teflon &amp; bulb coating technology allows for over 20-year lifetime.&lt;ref name="iMaser3000"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.t4science.com/products.php |title= iMaser 3000 |work= |publisher= |location= |at= |format= |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate= 2010-04-08 |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The storage bulb is in turn inside a [[microwave cavity]] made from a precisely machined copper or silver-plated ceramic cylinder. This cavity is tuned to the {{formatnum:1.420}}&amp;nbsp;GHz resonance frequency of the atoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/maser.html|title=USNO, Hydrogen Masers|publisher=[[United States Naval Observatory]]|accessdate=31 January 2016|quote=The storage bulb is a quartz bulb about 20 cm tall which is coated inside with Teflon to control the recombination rate of atoms into molecules. The quartz bulb is located in a precisely machined pure copper cylinder which acts as a microwave resonant cavity for the 1.420 GHz frequency of the 21 cm hydrogen line. Once the atoms enter the resonance cavity, they find other atoms radiating and they fall in step. They "start to talk to each other" and echo what they hear. This produces a highly coherent oscillation. This is the signal to which the crystal oscillator is phase-locked. All of that is packaged in cabinets with power supplies, temperature control, and magnetic shielding.}}&lt;!-- if page cannot be accessed directly go to: http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/frontpage.html &gt; USNO Master Clock &gt; Precise Time &amp; the USNO Master Clock &gt; hydrogen maser clocks. There are some issues with uptime for this website. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A weak static magnetic field is applied parallel to the cavity axis by a solenoid to lift the [[Degenerate energy levels|degeneracy]] of the magnetic [[Zeeman effect|Zeeman]] sublevels.&lt;ref&gt;{{US Patent|5838206}}Active Hydrogen Maser Atomic Frequency Standard&lt;/ref&gt; To decrease the influence of changing external magnetic fields on the transition line frequency and be compliant to electromagnetic interferences, the cavity is surrounded by several nested layers of shields.&lt;ref name="iMaser3000"/&gt;

In the active hydrogen maser, the cavity oscillates by itself. This requires a higher hydrogen atom density and a higher [[Q factor|quality factor]] for the cavity. However, with advanced microwave cavities made out of silver-plated ceramic, the gain factor can be much higher, thereby requiring less hydrogen atom density.&lt;ref name="iMaser3000"/&gt; The active maser is more complex and more expensive but has better short-term and long-term frequency stabilities.

In the passive hydrogen maser, the cavity is fed from an external {{formatnum:1.420}}&amp;nbsp;GHz frequency. The external frequency is tuned to produce a maximum output in the cavity. This allows the use of lower hydrogen atom density and lower cavity quality factor, which reduces the cost.

The '''KCHT Power Station''' is a [[municipal solid waste]]-fired [[thermal power station]] currently under construction at [[Muthurajawela]] in [[Sri Lanka]]. It is being constructed together with the [[Aitken Spence Power Station]], after it won the bid by the [[Ministry of Urban Development (Sri Lanka)|Urban Development Authority]] from a pool of 121 bidders, 19 of which were foreign. Construction of the facility began on {{Nowrap|10 August 2017}} and will cost approximately {{Nowrap|[[United States dollar|US$]]95 million}}, with an estimated completion slated for mid-2019.&lt;ref name="DailyFT"&gt;{{cite news|title=Two waste-to-energy plants to get off the ground today|url=http://www.ft.lk/article/634380/Two-waste-to-energy-plants-to-get-off-the-ground-today|accessdate=8 October 2017|publisher=[[Daily FT]]|date=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LBO"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sri Lanka to kick off solid waste plants with USD193 mln investment|url=http://www.lankabusinessonline.com/sri-lanka-to-kick-off-solid-waste-plants-with-usd193-mln-investment/|accessdate=8 October 2017|work=[[Lanka Business Online]]|date=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{Nowrap|10 [[megawatt]]}} power station will be operated by {{Nowrap|KCHT Lanka Jang (Private) Limited}}, a subsidiary of the [[South Korea|South Korean]] company {{Nowrap|KCHT Holding}}. It will use {{Convert|630|MT|lb|lk=on}} of waste from the [[Colombo]] and [[Gampaha]] suburbs. The generated power will be sold to the state-owned [[Ceylon Electricity Board]] at a rate of {{Nowrap|[[Sri Lankan rupee|Rs]]. 37.10 per [[KWh]]}} generated. The remaining [[bottom ash]] resulting from the process would be used for [[road construction]] and other purposes, while the unusable [[fly ash]] residue (amounting to 2%) being disposed at locations already identified.&lt;ref name="DailyFT" /&gt;

=== Crew ===
The flight was under the command of 42-year-old Captain Park Yong-chul ([[Hangul|Korean]]: 박용철, [[Hanja]]: 朴鏞喆, [[Revised Romanization of Korean|RR]]: ''Bak Yong-cheol''. [[McCune-Reischauer|M-R]]: ''Pak Yongch'ŏl'')&lt;ref&gt;"[http://starbulletin.com/98/03/25/news/story1.html Two Systems Down in KAL 801 Crash]," ''[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The captain had close to 9,000 hours of flight time and had recently received a Flight Safety Award for negotiating a 747 engine failure at low altitude.&lt;ref name="Mayday"/&gt; Park had originally been scheduled to fly to [[Dubai]], [[United Arab Emirates]]; since he did not have enough rest for the Dubai trip, he was reassigned to Flight 801.&lt;ref name="Pg3"/&gt;  The first officer was 40-year-old Song Kyung-ho ([[Hangul|Korean]]: 송경호, [[Hanja]]: 宋慶昊, RR: ''Song Gyeong-ho'', M-R: ''Song Kyŏngho''), who had more than 4,000 hours' flying experience, and the flight engineer was 57-year-old Nam Suk-hoon ([[Hangul|Korean]]: 남석훈, [[Hanja]]: 南錫薰, RR: ''Nam Seok-hun'', M-R: ''Nam Sŏkhun''),&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ntsb.gov/events/kal801/Exhibits/Ex_2F.pdf DOCKET NO.: SA-517 EXHIBIT NO. 2F]."

Flight 801 departed from Seoul-Kimpo International Airport (now [[Gimpo Airport]]) at 8:53&amp;nbsp;p.m. (9:53&amp;nbsp;p.m. Guam time) on August 5 on its way to Guam. It carried three flight crew members (the two pilots and the flight engineer),  14 flight attendants, and 237 passengers,&lt;ref&gt;NTSB Report, pp. 11, 23&lt;/ref&gt; a total of 254 people. Of the passengers, three were children between the ages of 2 and 12 and three were 24 months old or younger.&lt;ref name="Pg45" /&gt; Six of the passengers were Korean Air flight attendants, who were [[deadheading (employee)|deadheading]].&lt;ref name="Pg3"&gt;NTSB Report, pp.3, 15&lt;/ref&gt;

The flight experienced some turbulence but was uneventful until shortly after 1:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. on August 6, as the jet was preparing to land. There was heavy rain at Guam so visibility was significantly reduced and the crew attempted an instrument landing. The [[glideslope]] Instrument Landing System (ILS) for runway 6L was out of service; captain Park believed it was in service, however, and at 1:35 am managed to pick up a signal that was later identified to be from an irrelevant electronic device on the ground.  The crew noticed that the aircraft was descending very steeply, and noted several times that the airport "is not in sight." Despite protests from flight engineer Nam that the detected signal was not the glide-slope indicator, Park pressed on. The crew lowered the landing gear and continued to prepare the aircraft for landing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/09/us/in-asiana-crash-investigation-early-focus-is-on-the-crews-actions.html In Asiana Crash Investigation, Early Focus Is on the Crew’s Actions] ''[[The New York Times]]'' July 8, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; 12 seconds before impact, the Ground Proximity Warning system activated, warning the crew about their actual altitude. First officer Song declared a missed approach, and captain Park declared a go-around, but it was too late. At 1:42 am, the aircraft's main landing gear struck a fuel pipeline, and crashed into Nimitz Hill. The crash site was about {{convert|3|nmi|mi km}} short of the runway, at an altitude of {{convert|660|ft}}.

Of the 254 people on board, 228 died as a result of the crash. One survivor, 36-year-old Hyun Seong Hong&lt;!--Hong is an American, so put in Western order--&gt; (홍현성, also spelled ''Hong Hyun Sung'') of the United States, occupied Seat 3B in first class, and said that the crash occurred so quickly that the passengers "had no time to scream"&lt;ref name="PilotErrorNYT"/&gt; and likened the crash to "a scene from a film."&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19970808/ai_n14123263 Anger and tears as Guam crash families beg to see dead] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216075715/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19970808/ai_n14123263 |date=December 16, 2008 }}, ''[[The Independent]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rescue ==
[[Image:Korean Air Flight 801 wreckage.jpg|thumb|Wreckage of HL7468 burns at the Sasa Valley crash site.]]
The rescue effort was hampered by the weather, terrain, and other problems. Emergency vehicles could not approach due to the fuel pipeline destroyed by the crash and blocking the narrow road. [[United States Navy]] Seabees of NMCB133 were some of the first on the scene as they utilized their earth moving equipment to clear roadways and timber from the crash site approach. The Seabees used backhoes to crack open the still-burning plane to rescue survivors and erected mortuary tents for first responders. There was confusion over the administration of the effort; the crash occurred on land owned by the [[United States Navy]] but civil authorities initially claimed authority. The hull had disintegrated, and [[jet fuel]] in the wing tanks had sparked a fire that was still burning eight hours after impact.

===Rika Matsuda===

Governor [[Carl T.C. Gutierrez]] found 11-year-old Rika Matsuda, a [[South Korea]]n citizen from [[Japan]] who boarded the flight with her mother, 44-year-old Cho Sung-yeo (also known as Shigeko&lt;ref name="Honeymoon"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-61001878.html Jet hell Rika's scars will last forever.]," ''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]''&lt;/ref&gt;). They were heading to Guam on vacation. Rika Matsuda described what happened to her and her mother to interpreters.&lt;ref name="PilotErrorNYT"/&gt; Cho could not free herself from the aircraft and told Rika to run away. Luggage piled on the girl and her mother as the crash occurred; Rika Matsuda said her mother, unable to free herself, asked her to leave.&lt;ref name="PilotErrorNYT"/&gt; Cho died in the fire. After escaping from the aircraft, Rika discovered a surviving [[flight attendant]], Lee Yong Ho (이용호). They stayed together until Gutierrez discovered them.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://ns.gov.gu/guam/miracle/ Korean Air Survivor – Rika's Miracle] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071126062957/http://ns.gov.gu/guam/miracle/ |date=2007-11-26 }}," ''Government of Guam''&lt;/ref&gt; Rika Matsuda, treated at Guam Memorial Hospital in [[Tamuning, Guam|Tamuning]], was released on August 7, 1997, and was reunited with her father, Tatsuo Matsuda. The two were then escorted to the Governor House where they were the guests of Gutierrez and the [[First Lady of Guam]], Geri Gutierrez, for several days; afterwards Rika and Tatsuo Matsuda flew to Japan.&lt;ref name="GuamHome"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://ns.gov.gu/guam/miracle/ Korean Air Survivor – Rika's Miracle] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071126062957/http://ns.gov.gu/guam/miracle/ |date=2007-11-26 }}." ''Government of Guam''. Retrieved on February 13, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation and probable cause==

A special weather observation made at 01:47 five minutes after the impact reported:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Wind variable at 4 knots; visibility—5 miles; present weather—light rain shower; sky condition—few 1,500 feet, scattered 2,500 feet, overcast 4,000 feet; temperature 26° C; dew point 24° C; altimeter 29.85 inches Hg. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The U.S. [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) investigation report stated that a contributing factor was that the ATC [[Minimum Safe Altitude Warning]] (MSAW) system at Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport had been deliberately modified so as to limit spurious alarms and could not detect an approaching aircraft that was below minimum safe altitude.&lt;ref name=ntsb_prob_cause&gt;NTSB final report, section 3.2 "Probable cause," page 175&lt;/ref&gt;  The probable cause of the accident was the captain's poor execution of the [[Instrument approach|non-precision approach]],&lt;ref name=ntsb_prob_cause /&gt; the captain's fatigue, poor communication between the flight crew, and Korean Air's lack of flight crew training.&lt;ref name=ntsb_prob_cause /&gt; The crew had been using an outdated flight map that was missing a 724 foot obstruction symbol depicted at the NIMITZ VOR and that map stated the Minimum Safe Altitude while crossing the NIMITZ VOR for a landing aircraft was {{convert|1300|ft}} as opposed to the updated altitude of {{convert|1440|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;NTSB final report, Table 2, page 36&lt;/ref&gt; Flight 801 crashed near the NIMITZ VOR, which is situated on Nimitz Hill at a height of {{convert|680|ft}} at 1:42 am, when it descended below the minimum safe altitude of {{convert|1440|ft}} during its landing approach. The report also identified that the captain may have mistakenly believed that the airplane was closer to the airport
than it was and that there may have been confusion about the location of the [[Distance Measuring Equipment]] (DME) in relation to the airport, with the crew anticipating the VOR/DME to be located at the airport. The DME was sited at the NIMITZ VOR some 3.3&amp;nbsp;nm from the airport and such a configuration had not been part of Korean Air's simulator training, the crew's training for such non-precision approaches having been carried out in scenarios where the DME was located at the airport. Nevertheless the correct DME distances were shown on the approach chart.&lt;ref&gt;NTSB final report, section 2.4.1.3.2 "Confusion About Location of DME" page 144&lt;/ref&gt;

The NTSB presented its findings on March 24, 25 and 26, 1998 in the [[Hawaii Convention Center]] in [[Honolulu]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20040805050223/http://www.ntsb.gov/events/KAL801/trans_980324.htm PUBLIC HEARING IN CONNECTION WITH THE  INVESTIGATION OF AIRCRAFT ACCIDENT  KOREAN AIR  FLIGHT 801, B-747-300  AGANA, GUAM AUGUST 6, 1997]."

[[National Transportation Safety Board]]. Retrieved on June 29, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The section of the report entitled "Probable Cause" concluded:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CONTROLLED FLIGHT INTO TERRAIN KOREAN AIR FLIGHT 801 BOEING 747-300, HL7468 NIMITZ HILL, GUAM AUGUST 6, 1997|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/AAR0001.pdf|publisher=National Transportation Safety Board, Washington D.C.|accessdate=October 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the captain’s failure to adequately brief and execute the non-precision approach and the first officer’s and flight engineer’s failure to effectively monitor and cross-check the captain’s execution of the approach.  Contributing to these failures were the captain’s fatigue and Korean Air’s inadequate flight crew training.

Contributing to the accident was the Federal Aviation Administration’s intentional inhibition of the [[MSAW|minimum safe altitude warning system]] at Guam and the agency’s failure to adequately manage the system.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following the Korean Air 801 crash, it was brought to the [[NTSB]]'s attention that foreign carriers flying in and out of the US were not covered by the Aviation Disaster Family Assistance Act of 1996 and Korean Air did not have a plan to deal with the situation they encountered. As a result, [[US Congress]] passed the Foreign Air Carrier Family Support Act of 1997 to require those carriers to file family assistance plans and fulfill the same family support requirements as domestic airlines. Not only does the Act ensure that all victims and family members will be treated equitably, regardless of the carrier they use, it also impels many carriers that may not have thought about family assistance issues to give them due consideration in their emergency response plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/news/speeches/JimHall/Pages/Remarks_before_the_International_Symposium_on_Family_Victim_Assistance_for_Transportation_Disasters_Arlington_Virginia.aspx |title=Remarks before the International Symposium on Family &amp; Victim Assistance for Transportation Disasters, Arlington, Virginia |publisher=Ntsb.gov |date=September 28, 1998 |accessdate=February 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 10, 1991, a [[L'Express Airlines]] [[Beechcraft C99]], flying as Flight 508 originating in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], and in transit from [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] to [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], crashed while attempting to make an ILS approach to Runway 5 (since renumbered to Runway 6) at Birmingham Municipal Airport (now [[Birmingham–Shuttlesworth International Airport]]) in Birmingham, Alabama. The plane crashed in the Fairview area near Five Points West in the [[Ensley, Birmingham, Alabama|Ensley]] neighborhood and subsequently injured four persons on the ground, as well as destroying two homes. Of the 15 occupants on board, there were 13 fatalities. The cause of the crash was attributed to the captain's decision to attempt an instrument approach into severe thunderstorms resulting in a loss of control of the airplane.&lt;ref name="NTSB"&gt;[http://www.airdisaster.com/reports/ntsb/AAR92-01.pdf NTSB/AAR-92/01 NTSB Aircraft Accident Report, L'Express Airlines, Inc. Flight 508] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060613223857/http://www.airdisaster.com/reports/ntsb/AAR92-01.pdf |date=2006-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To date it is the deadliest commercial aviation accident in Alabama history.

==Flight==
L'Express Flight 508 was operated with a Beech C99 twin-engine turboprop aircraft. Seating on the plane was five rows of two seats, one on each side of a central aisle. A single seat was located across from the left passenger loading door and a double seat at the rear of the aircraft. Passengers boarded through the rear passenger door. The flight left New Orleans, LA with one passenger, at 4:05 pm CDT, landing in Mobile, AL, at 4:50 pm CDT. After changing crews and boarding 12 passengers, the flight departed for [[Birmingham–Shuttlesworth International Airport|Birmingham Municipal Airport]] at 5:05 pm CDT. As the flight approached Birmingham, strong thunderstorms developed in the vicinity of the airport. Around the same time four other aircraft either diverted to other airports or delayed their approach and entered a holding pattern until the weather improved. The crew of Flight 508 was aware of the thunderstorm activity but elected to continue the approach. Francis Fernandes, the L'Express captain at the controls of Flight 508, later said the plane experienced a "significant roll to the left" on landing approach. Fernandes told investigators that while he and the first officer tried to level the aircraft, it experienced an "extreme updraft" that pushed the plane's nose into the air.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1074400.html] Pilots Struggled to Control Plane in Storm Before Crash; The Washington Post, July 12, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; After entering a severe thunderstorm cell southwest of the airport, the crew lost directional control and was unable to recover the aircraft prior to impacting two houses in the Ensley neighborhood of Birmingham at 6:11:27 pm CDT.&lt;ref name="NTSB"/&gt; The airplane struck one home, crossed a tree lined residential street, and slammed into a second home, immediately erupting into flames. The lone surviving passenger was encountered in the home by the residents before all fled the burning home. The captain was taken to [[UAB Hospital]], passenger Mabry Rogers to [[Carraway Methodist Medical Center]], and three residents to [[Baptist Princeton]]. Twelve passengers and the first officer perished in the crash; the captain, one passenger, and four residents were injured.&lt;ref name="nyt712"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/12/us/weather-is-linked-to-crash-of-plane.html] Smothers, Ronald "Weather is Linked to Crash of Plane", New York Times, July 12, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media coverage==
The accident occurred during the 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. local evening news broadcasts. Local media reports began around 6:45 pm CDT with local ABC television affiliate [[WBRC]] broadcasting live by 6:45 pm CDT. Radio and television coverage continued through the night. Notably, WBRC was recording weather radar images around the time of the crash, these images would later be used in the official NTSB&lt;ref name="NTSB"/&gt; investigation and other crash-related litigation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamesspann.com/bmachine/post/wxtalk/5124/More-Thoughts-On-The-1991-LExpress-Crash ABC33/40 Weather Blog; More Thoughts On The 1991 L'Express Crash]&lt;/ref&gt; Coverage of the crash was carried on the front page of newspapers nationwide in the days following the accident.&lt;ref name="nyt712"/&gt;

==NTSB investigation==
The National Transportation Safety Board dispatched a team to investigate the accident. The focus of the investigation was immediately centered on the weather at the time of the accident. Investigators were surprised by the presence of a [[cockpit voice recorder]] in the airplane as such recorders were not required for the involved airplane at the time.&lt;ref name="nyt712"/&gt; Following a detailed  investigation, the NTSB issued its final report on March 3, 1992; AAR-92/01. The formal probable cause of the accident was "the decision of the captain to initiate and continue an instrument approach into clearly identified thunderstorm activity, resulting in a loss of control of the airplane from which the flightcrew was unable to recover and subsequent collision with obstacles and the terrain."&lt;ref name="NTSB"/&gt;

==Survivors==
The only survivors of the crash were the captain, Francis Fernandez of [[Niceville, Florida]], and Mabry Rogers of [[Birmingham, Alabama]].&lt;ref name="nyt712"/&gt;

'''Liquid hydrogen''' (LH2 or LH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is the [[liquid state]] of the element [[hydrogen]]. Hydrogen is found naturally in the [[molecule|molecular]] H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; form.

To exist as a liquid, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; must be cooled below hydrogen's [[critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]] of 33&amp;nbsp;K. However, for hydrogen to be in a fully liquid state without boiling at atmospheric pressure, it needs to be cooled to 20.28&amp;nbsp;K&lt;ref name="IPTS-1968"&gt;[http://media.iupac.org/publications/pac/1970/pdf/2203x0555.pdf IPTS-1968], iupac.org, accessed 2009-06-12&lt;/ref&gt; (−423.17&amp;nbsp;°F; −252.87&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref&gt;[[Chemical elements data references]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roymech.co.uk/Useful_Tables/Matter/Prop_Gas.htm Properties Of Gases]. Roymech.co.uk. Retrieved on 2011-08-28.&lt;/ref&gt; One common method of obtaining liquid hydrogen involves a compressor resembling a jet engine in both appearance and principle. Liquid hydrogen is typically used as a concentrated form of [[hydrogen storage]]. As in any gas, storing it as liquid takes less space than storing it as a gas at normal temperature and pressure. However, the liquid density is very low compared to other common fuels. Once liquefied, it can be maintained as a liquid in pressurized and thermally insulated containers.

There are two [[spin isomers of hydrogen]]; liquid hydrogen consists of 99.79% parahydrogen and 0.21% orthohydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astronautix.com/props/liqirlh2.htm Liquid Air/LH2]. Astronautix.com. Retrieved on 2011-08-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{further|Timeline of low-temperature technology}}
In 1885, [[Zygmunt Florenty Wróblewski]] published hydrogen's critical temperature as 33{{nbsp}}K; critical pressure, 13.3 atmospheres; and boiling point, 23{{nbsp}}K.

[[Hydrogen]] was liquefied by [[James Dewar]] in 1898 by using [[regenerative cooling]] and his invention, the [[vacuum flask]]. The first synthesis of the stable isomer form of liquid hydrogen, parahydrogen, was achieved by [[Paul Harteck]] and [[Karl Friedrich Bonhoeffer]] in 1929.

==Spin isomers of hydrogen==
{{main|Spin isomers of hydrogen}}
The two nuclei in a dihydrogen molecule can have two different [[spin (physics)|spin]] states.
Parahydrogen, in which the two [[nuclear spin]]s are antiparallel, is more stable than orthohydrogen, in which the two are parallel. At room temperature, gaseous hydrogen is mostly in the ortho isomeric form due to thermal energy, but an ortho-enriched mixture is only [[metastability|metastable]] when liquified at low temperature. It slowly undergoes an [[exothermic reaction]] to become the para isomer, with enough energy released as heat to cause some of the liquid to boil.&lt;ref name="UFLnotes"/&gt; To prevent loss of the liquid during long-term storage, it is therefore intentionally converted to the para isomer as part of the production process, typically using a [[catalyst]] such as [[iron(III) oxide]], [[activated carbon]], platinized asbestos, rare earth metals, uranium compounds, [[chromium(III) oxide]], or some nickel compounds.&lt;ref name="UFLnotes"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.phys.ufl.edu/courses/phy4550-6555c/spring11/liquefaction-2011.pdf |title= Liquefaction of "Permanent" Gases |date= 2011 |accessdate= 2017-10-16 |format= PDF of lecture notes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Liquid hydrogen is a common [[liquid fuel|liquid]] [[rocket propellant|rocket fuel]] for [[spacecraft propulsion|rocketry]] applications&amp;nbsp;— both [[NASA]] and the [[United States Air Force]] operate a large number of liquid hydrogen tanks with an individual capacity up to 3.8 million liters (1 million U.S. gallons).&lt;ref name="Flynn2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Flynn, Thomas |title=Cryogenic Engineering, Second Edition, Revised and Expanded|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-XfMBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA401|date=2004|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-203-02699-1|page=401}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most [[rocket engine]]s fueled by liquid hydrogen, it first [[regenerative cooling (rocket)|cools]] the nozzle and other parts before being mixed with the oxidizer&amp;nbsp;— usually [[liquid oxygen]] (LOX)&amp;nbsp;— and burned to produce water with traces of [[ozone]] and [[hydrogen peroxide]]. Practical H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; rocket engines run fuel-rich so that the exhaust contains some unburned hydrogen. This reduces combustion chamber and nozzle erosion. It also reduces the molecular weight of the exhaust, which can actually increase [[specific impulse]], despite the incomplete combustion.

Liquid hydrogen can be used as the fuel for an [[internal combustion engine]] or [[fuel cell]]. Various submarines ([[Type 212 submarine]], [[Type 214 submarine]]) and concept [[hydrogen vehicle]]s have been built using this form of hydrogen (see [[DeepC]], [[BMW H2R]]). Due to its similarity, builders can sometimes modify and share equipment with systems designed for [[liquefied natural gas]] (LNG).  However, because of the lower [[Energy density#Energy density in energy storage and in fuel|volumetric energy]], the hydrogen volumes needed for combustion are large. Unless [[fuel injection#Direct injection|direct injection]] is used, a severe gas-displacement effect also hampers maximum breathing and increases pumping losses.

Liquid hydrogen is also used to cool neutrons to be used in neutron scattering. Since neutrons and hydrogen nuclei have similar masses, kinetic energy exchange per interaction is maximum ([[elastic collision]]). Finally, superheated liquid hydrogen was used in many [[bubble chamber]] experiments.

The first [[Thermonuclear weapon|thermonuclear bomb]], [[Ivy Mike]], used liquid [[deuterium]] (hydrogen-2), for nuclear fusion.

==Properties==
[[File:Hydrogen Tank - GPN-2000-001458.jpg|thumb|150px|left|A large hydrogen tank in a vacuum chamber at Lewis Research Center in 1967]]
The product of its combustion with oxygen alone is water vapor (although if its combustion is with oxygen and nitrogen it can form toxic chemicals), which can be cooled with some of the liquid hydrogen. Since water is harmless to the environment, an engine burning it can be considered "zero emissions." Liquid hydrogen also has a much higher [[specific energy]] than gasoline, natural gas, or diesel.&lt;ref name="almc.army.mil"&gt;[http://www.almc.army.mil/alog/issues/MayJun00/MS492.htm Hydrogen As an Alternative Fuel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080808053811/http://www.almc.army.mil/alog/issues/MayJun00/MS492.htm |date=2008-08-08 }}. Almc.army.mil. Retrieved on 2011-08-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The density of liquid hydrogen is only 70.99&amp;nbsp;g/L (at 20&amp;nbsp;[[kelvin|K]]), a [[relative density]] of just 0.07. Although the specific energy is more than twice that of other fuels, this gives it a remarkably low volumetric [[energy density]], many fold lower.

Liquid hydrogen requires [[cryogenic]] storage technology such as special thermally insulated containers and requires special handling common to all [[cryogenic fuel]]s. This is similar to, but more severe than [[liquid oxygen]].  Even with thermally insulated containers it is difficult to keep such a low temperature, and the hydrogen will gradually leak away (typically at a rate of 1% per day&lt;ref name="almc.army.mil"/&gt;). It also shares many of the same [[hydrogen safety|safety issues]] as other forms of hydrogen, as well as being cold enough to liquefy, or even solidify atmospheric oxygen, which can be an explosion hazard.

The [[triple point]] of hydrogen is at 13.81&amp;nbsp;K&lt;ref name="IPTS-1968"/&gt; 7.042&amp;nbsp;kPa.&lt;ref&gt;Cengel, Yunus A. and Turner, Robert H. (2004). ''Fundamentals of thermal-fluid sciences'', McGraw-Hill, p. 78, {{ISBN|0-07-297675-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety==
Due to its cold temperatures, liquid hydrogen is a hazard for cold burns. Apart from that, elemental hydrogen as a liquid is biologically inert and its only human health hazard as a vapor is displacement of oxygen, resulting in asphyxiation. Because of its flammability, liquid hydrogen should be kept away from heat or flame unless ignition is intended.

'''Louisburg Square''' is a private square located in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] that is maintained by the Louisburg Square Proprietors. While the Proprietors pay taxes to the City of Boston, the city does not own the square or its garden. It was named for the 1745 [[Siege of Louisbourg (1745)|Battle of Louisbourg]], in which Massachusetts militiamen led by [[William Pepperrell]], who was made the first American baronet for his role, sacked the French [[Fortress of Louisbourg]].

The square itself is a small grassy oval surrounded by a wrought-iron fence; access is generally not available. There is a statue of [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] at the north end and of [[Aristides the Just]] at the south end.&lt;ref name=fodors&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fodors.com/world/north-america/usa/massachusetts/boston/review-96346.html |title=Louisburg Square Review |department=Boston Sights |publisher=Fodor's Travel |accessdate=January 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Greek Revival]] houses around the square reflect the rarefied privilege enjoyed by the 19th century upper class in Beacon Hill. One of the last private residences built on Louisburg Square was 2 Louisburg Square, built in 1847 for wealthy merchant and philanthropist Thomas Handasyd Perkins Jr., known as "Short-Arm Tom", who lived at 1 Joy Street. Among the famous people who lived there in the 19th Century were ''[[The Atlantic Monthly|Atlantic Monthly]]'' editor [[William Dean Howells]], architect [[Charles Bulfinch]], painter [[John Singleton Copley]], and teacher [[A.

'''Memetic engineering''' is a term developed by Leveious Rolando, John Sokol, and Gibron Burchett based on [[Richard Dawkins]]' theory of [[memes]].

*The process of developing memes, through meme-splicing and memetic synthesis, with the intent of altering the behavior of others in society or humanity.
*The process of creating and developing theories or [[ideologies]] based on an analytical study of [[societies]], [[cultures]], their ways of thinking and the evolution of their minds.
*The process of modifying human beliefs, thought patterns, etc.

In contrast, '''gutation''' is a term developed by Erik Buitenhuis and is:

*The process of altering the behaviour of oneself, with the intent of developing new memes

==Definition==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2013}}
According to the theory of Memes coined by Richard  Dawkins, evolution depends not on the particular chemical basis of genetics, but only on the existence of a self-replicating unit of transmission—in the case of biological evolution, the gene. For Dawkins, the meme exemplified another self-replicating unit with potential significance in explaining human behavior and cultural evolution: the effect a meme has on society is based on the application of the meme after understanding the qualities essential to the meme.  According to the theory, memetic engineering is, simply put, the analysis of an individual or individuals' behavior, the selection of specific memes and the distribution or propagation of those memes with the intent of altering the behavior of others. A memetic engineer doesn't particularly have to consciously make the decision to alter another individuals behavior. It can happen unconsciously when specific behavior is observed, transmitted and then replicated within the observer. Memes themselves are neither good nor bad. For example, "racism" is an ideology that is made up of several memes. When a meme is introduced, those concepts begin to take on their own process of evolution based on the person who adopts the ideology, internalizes it, and reintroduces it into society causing it to spread like a [[virus]].

According to the above theory, typical memetic engineers include [[science|scientists]], [[engineering|engineers]], [[industrial design]]ers, [[advertising|ad-men]], [[art]]ists, [[publicity|publicist]]s, [[politics|political activists]], and religious [[missionary|missionaries]].

Dawkins agrees that much of [[theology]] and other theoretical aspects of [[religion]] can be viewed as the careful, even worshipful, handling of extremely powerful [[memeplexes]] with very odd or difficult traits.

==Origins of memetic engineering==
{{one source|date=January 2013}}
Memetic Engineering developed from diverse influences, including cutting-edge [[physics of consciousness]] and memetics research, [[chaos theory]], [[semiotics]], [[culture jamming]], military [[information warfare]], and the viral texts of [[iconoclasm|iconoclasts]] [[William S. Burroughs]], [[J.G. Ballard]], and [[Genesis P-Orridge]]. It draws upon Third Culture sciences and conceptual worldviews for Social Engineering, Values Systems Alignment, and Culture Jamming purposes. An important example of [[macro-historical]] memetic engineering analysis explaining how [[wikt:domination|domination]], [[patriarchy]], [[war]] and [[violence]] are culturally programmed is [[Riane Eisler]]'s ''[[The Chalice and the Blade]]'' (San Francisco: Harper SanFrancisco, 1988), which outlines her Dominator and Partnership Culture thesis. The savvy memetic engineer is able to isolate, study, and subtly manipulate the underlying values systems, symbolic balance and primal [[atavism]]s that unconsciously influence the individual [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] and [[collective identity]]. A highly educated but susceptible [[intelligentsia]], worldwide travel, and information vectors like the [[Internet]], [[cable television]], and [[tabloid journalism|tabloid]] media, means that hysterical epidemics and disinformation campaigns may become more common. This warfare will be conducted using [[aesthetics]], [[symbols]], and [[doctrines]] as [[camouflage]] that will ultimately influence our cultural meme pool. These contemporary life conditions (Historic Times; Geographic Place; Existential Problems; and Societal Circumstances) are explored in books like [[Carl Sagan]]'s ''[[The Demon Haunted World]]: Science As a Candle in the Dark'' (New York: Ballantine Books, 1996), [[John Brockman (literary agent)|John Brockman]]'s ''[[The Third Culture]]: Beyond the Scientific Revolution'' (New York: Touchstone Books, 1996), and [[Michael Shermer]]'s ''[[Why People Believe Weird Things]]: Pseudo-science, Superstition, and Other Confusions of Our Time'' (New York: W.H. Freeman &amp; Co, 1996). Fictional descriptions of memetic engineering include [[Isaac Asimov]]'s seminal [[Foundation Trilogy|''Foundation'' Trilogy]] (New York: Bantam Books, 1991), [[George Gurdjieff]]'s artificial mythology ''[[Beelzebub's Tales to His Grandson]]'' (New York: Penguin USA, 1999); [[Neil Stephenson]]'s novels ''[[Snow Crash]]'' (New York: Bantam Spectra, 1993) and ''[[The Diamond Age]]'' (New York: Bantam Spectra, 1996); and [[Robert W. Chambers]]' unearthly ''[[The King in Yellow]]'' (Buccaneer Books, 1996) tome, which influenced seminal horror author [[H. P. Lovecraft]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alexburns.net Alex Burns]: [http://www.disinfo.com/archive/pages/dossier/id133/pg1/ Memetic Engineering] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060527003717/http://www.disinfo.com/archive/pages/dossier/id133/pg1/ |date=2006-05-27 }} (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applied memetic engineering==
Memetic engineering as a social science lends examples of itself in multiple areas and disciplines. It is currently being examined and researched by the [[US military]] as a means to [[counter insurgency]] and combat [[terrorism]] as explained below in "From the Clash to the Confluence of Civilizations" by [[Thomas P.M. Barnett]], an American military [[geostrategist]], and  [http://www.latrobe.edu.au/gsm/academic_staff/richard_pech.html Richard J. Pech's] "Inhibiting Imitative Terrorism Through Memetic Engineering".

Other examples of applied memetic engineering are present but not exclusive to the [[marketing]] and [[advertising]] industries. The question is whether these individuals can be truly considered memetic engineers. Marketing and [[advertising professional]]s create memes on an ongoing basis; however, this alone doesn't necessarily qualify them as being memetic engineers. Few if any actually fall into this category. This is possibly due to a lack of understanding of the various memes that have taken root in their target audience minds. According to the definition, industrial designers, musicians, artists, [[Sportsperson|athletes]], and other entertainers would more likely better serve this definition. This is because of their ability to create products, phrases and ideas that disseminate the population triggering a response within the brain causing a cultural phenomena.

[[Game theory]] provides an [[empirical]] means of advancing the science of memetics. [[Memetic game theory]], attempts to mathematically capture behavior in strategic situations; where an individual's success in making choices depends on the choices of others, based on past experiences, emotional behavior and learned behavior. It also offers a scientific approach to analyzing social interactions.

===Examples===
An example of an engineered meme is [[Godwin's law]], a meme which propagates on mail-lists, and which its author professes to have initiated to reduce spam on those lists; one version is "When someone posts a metaphor about [[Nazis]] the thread is no longer useful."&lt;ref name="Godwin94"&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Mike Godwin|Godwin, Mike]]|title=Meme, Counter-meme|date=October 1994|work=[[Wired magazine|Wired]] |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.10/godwin.if_pr.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Pech]] discusses the concept of memetic engineering within the context of countering mind contagions associated with [[terrorism]]. [[School shootings]], for example, may be explained as an attempt to demonstrate the ultimate form of [[rebellion]] against a system in which the perpetrators feel ostracised or isolated. Acts of violence might appeal to their [[egos]] and the means for achieving this is replicated via the shooting meme. To re-engineer such a meme and its ability to infest susceptible minds, all information concerning such violence must be portrayed in an unappealing manner. For example, no one wants to be associated with acts of [[cowardice]]. By strongly suggesting that such violence is cowardly and the work of disturbed minds, it has less appeal for replication. In this manner the shooting meme has been re-engineered by removing its attraction, and therefore removing its ability to replicate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pech |first1=R. J. |title=Inhibiting Imitative Terrorism through Memetic Engineering |doi=10.1111/1468-5973.1102002 |journal=Journal of Contingencies and Crisis Management |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=61 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name is a word largely of [[British English]] usage.

==Origins and building==
[[File:Pantechnicon, Motcomb St, London.jpg|thumb|The Pantechnicon, [[Motcomb Street]], 2017]]
The word "Pantechnicon" is an invented one, formed from the Greek ''pan'' ("all") and ''techne'' ("art"). It was originally the name of a large establishment in [[Motcomb Street]], [[Belgravia]], London, opened around 1830. It combined a picture gallery, a furniture shop, and the sale of carriages, while its southern half was a sizable warehouse for storing furniture and other items. [[Seth Smith (property developer)]], whose family were originally from [[Wiltshire]], was a builder in the early 19th century, and constructed much of the new housing in Belgravia&lt;ref&gt;A Guide the Architecture of London {{ISBN|0-297-83114-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;, then a country area.  Their clients required storage facilities and this was built on an awkward left-over triangular site with a Greek style [[Doric column]] façade, and called Pantechnicon, pseudo-Greek for "pertaining to all the arts or crafts".

Subsequently, special wagons were designed with sloping ramps to more easily load furniture, with the building name on the side. The very large, distinctive, and noticeable horse-drawn vans that were used to collect and deliver the customers' furniture came to be known as "Pantechnicon vans." From around 1900, the name was shortened to simply Pantechnicon. The Pantechnicon Ltd, a furniture storage and removal company, continued to trade until the 1970s.

The building was largely destroyed by fire in 1874, but the facade still exists and the usefulness of the vans was by then well established and they had been adopted by other firms. As of 2015 the façade and the building behind it has been leased by its owner, Grosvenor Estates, to Cubitt House, a company specializing in pubs and restaurants in the Belgravia area, and is to be redeveloped into a "food and retail emporium" over six floors, including a basement and a roof-terrace.&lt;ref&gt;Evening Standard, 7 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
[[File:1947 Bedford MLZ (HNF 716) pantechnicon van, 2012 HCVS Tyne-Tees Run.jpg|thumb|200px|A 1947 Bedford MLZ pantechnicon]]
Though small by modern standards, the vans were impressively large by those of their own time. They came in lengths of between 12 and 18 feet, and were up to 7 feet broad. The roof was a segment of a cylinder 8 inches higher in the middle than at the edges to ensure ready drainage but it had boards round the edges to allow stowage of extra items. Below the roof-line the body was a cuboid box except that behind the space required by the front wheels when turning tightly, the floor was lowered to permit greater internal headroom. This was achieved by cranking the back axle downwards as in a [[Float (horse-drawn)|float]]. The lowered floor also saved some of the lifting which was a feature of using normal horse-drawn lorries and vans, which needed a deck high enough to fit the steering mechanism below it. Access was obtained through hinged doors at the rear. Outside these, the tailboard was hinged upwards from the level of the well.

==Use==
Some pantechnicons were drawn by two horses in [[tandem]]. This seems to have been so as to allow entry to relatively narrow town lanes and such places as the warehouse doorways. To give the driver a clear view of obstructions and to enable him to control the lead horse, he was usually seated on the front of the roof.

From the early 1900s onward lift-off container bodies were introduced which could be lifted off the chassis and transferred to a rail wagon or to the hold of a ship.

The value of these vans seems to have been quite quickly appreciated so that removal firms other than The Pantechnicon operated them, sometimes over long distances between towns, a business which was eventually superseded by the spread of the railways.

==Popular Culture==
An adventure with a pantechnicon is one of the episodes in the [[Arnold Bennett]] novel, ''[[The Card]]'' (1911).

==Modern usage==
A pantech [[truck]] or van is a word derivation of "pantechnicon" commonly currently used in Australia.  A pantech is a truck or van with a freight hull made of (or converted to) hard panels. Such vehicles can be used for chilled freight, or as [[removal van]]s.

'''Paraffin wax''' is a soft colourless solid, derived from [[petroleum]], [[coal]] or [[oil shale]], that consists of a mixture of [[hydrocarbon]] molecules containing between twenty and forty carbon atoms. It is solid at room temperature and [[melting point|begins to melt]] above approximately {{convert|37|°C|°F}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Freund |first1=Mihály |last2=Mózes |first2=Gyula |translator=Jakab, E. |title=Paraffin products: properties, technologies, applications |year=1982 |publisher=Elsevier |location=Amsterdam, Netherlands |isbn=0-444-99712-1 |ref=harv |page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; its boiling point is &gt;{{convert|370|°C|°F}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Paraffin Wax |work=Chemical book |url=http://www.chemicalbook.com/ProductMSDSDetailCB2854418_EN.htm |accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common applications for paraffin wax include [[lubrication]], [[electrical insulation]], and [[candles]];

Un-dyed, unscented paraffin candles are odorless and bluish-white.  Paraffin wax was first created in 1830 in Germany, and marked a major advancement in candlemaking technology, as it burned more cleanly and reliably than [[tallow]] candles and was cheaper to produce.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Candles|url=http://candles.org/history/|website=National Candle Association|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In chemistry, ''paraffin'' is used synonymously with ''[[alkane]]'', indicating hydrocarbons with the general formula C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2''n''+2&lt;/sub&gt;. The name is derived from [[Latin]] ''parum'' ("barely") + ''affinis'', meaning "lacking [[electron affinity|affinity]]" or "lacking [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]]", referring to paraffin's unreactive nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford, England |date=March 2009 |chapter=Paraffin, n}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Paraffin wax was first created in 1830 by the German chemist [[Carl Reichenbach|Karl von Reichenbach]] when he tried to develop the means to efficiently separate and refine the waxy substances naturally occurring in petroleum. Paraffin represented a major advance in the candlemaking industry, because it burned more cleanly and reliably, and was cheaper to manufacture than any other candle fuel. Paraffin wax initially suffered from a low melting point; however, this shortcoming was later remedied by the addition of harder [[stearic acid]]. The production of paraffin wax enjoyed a boom in the early 20th century as a result of the growth of the meatpacking and oil industries, which created paraffin and stearic acid as byproducts.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Manufacturing ==
The feedstock for paraffin is [[Petroleum product#Specialty and products|slack wax]], which is a mixture of oil and wax, a byproduct from the refining of lubricating oil.

The first step in making paraffin wax is to remove the oil (de-oiling or de-waxing) from the slack wax. The oil is separated by crystallization. Most commonly, the slack wax is heated, mixed with one or more [[solvent]]s such as a [[ketone]] and then cooled. As it cools, wax crystallizes out of the solution, leaving only oil. This mixture is filtered into two streams: solid (wax plus some solvent) and liquid (oil and solvent). After the solvent is recovered by distillation, the resulting products are called "product wax" (or "press wax") and "foots oil". The lower the percentage of oil in the wax, the more refined it is considered (semi-refined versus fully refined).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Paraffin Wax (Fully Refined) |url=http://www.barasatwax.com/fullyrefined.php |publisher=Barasat Wax Refiner |accessdate=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The product wax may be further processed to remove colors and odors. The wax may finally be blended together to give certain desired properties such as melt point and penetration. Paraffin wax is sold in either liquid or solid form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wax Refining |url=http://igiwax.com/reference/wax-refining.html |publisher=The International Group, Inc. |accessdate=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Paraffin wax |url=http://bitumenengineering.com/materials/paraffin-wax |publisher=Bitumen Engineering |accessdate=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Manufacturing Process |url=http://www.barasatwax.com/mp.php |publisher=Barasat Wax Refiner |accessdate=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
In industrial applications, it is often useful to modify the crystal properties of the paraffin wax, typically by adding [[Branching (polymer chemistry)|branching]] to the existing carbon backbone chain. The modification is usually done with additives, such as [[Ethylene-vinyl acetate|EVA copolymers]], [[microcrystalline wax]], or forms of [[polyethylene]]. The branched properties result in a modified paraffin with a higher viscosity, smaller crystalline structure, and modified functional properties. Pure paraffin wax is rarely used for carving original models for [[Casting (metalworking)|casting]] metal and other materials in the [[lost wax process]], as it is relatively brittle at room temperature and presents the risks of chipping and breakage when worked. Soft and pliable waxes, like [[beeswax]], may be preferred for such sculpture, but "[[investment casting]] waxes," often paraffin-based, are expressly formulated for the purpose.

In a pathology laboratory, paraffin wax is used to impregnate tissue prior to sectioning thin samples of tissue. Water is removed from the tissue through ascending strengths of alcohol (75% to absolute) and the tissue is cleared in an organic solvent such as xylene. The tissue is then placed in paraffin wax for a number of hours and then set in a mold with wax to cool and solidify; sections are then cut on a microtome.

[[Water and Power Development Authority]] (WAPDA) was created in 1958 through WAPDA Act, 1958. Prior to this, the electricity supply service in [[Pakistan]] was undertaken by different agencies, both in public and private sectors, in different areas.The local areas electricity distribution service was being performed by various Regions of WAPDA. Then the Area Electricity Board (AEB) Peshawar, on the eight AEBs in Pakistan, was established under the scheme of Area Electricity Boards in 1982, in order to provide more autonomy and representation to [[State government|provincial government]], [[Representative democracy|elected representatives]], [[Industrialisation|industrialists]], [[Agricultural science|agriculturalists]], and other interest groups in functions of the AEBs. Peshawar Area Electricity Board was reorganized into one such corporatized entity under the name of Peshawar Electric Supply Company (PESCO) with effect from 22-03-1998, with the aim of commercialization and eventually privatization.
* [[Peshawar]] Electric Supply Company (PESCO), located in Peshawar provides service of power distribution to over 2.6 million consumers of all civil districts of Khyber Pukhtunkhwa, Pakistan. At PESCO networks, we own and maintain Khyber Pukhtunkhwa’s electricity distribution system via 132, 66, 33&amp;nbsp;kV sub-transmission lines, sub-stations and 11&amp;nbsp;kV &amp; 440&amp;nbsp;V low tension lines with distribution transformers that deliver electricity to your home or business.

'''Photovoltaic mounting systems''' (also called solar module racking) are used to fix [[solar panel]]s on surfaces like roofs, building facades, or the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solattach.com/photovoltaic-racking-mounting-system/|title=Photovoltaic Racking Systems|publisher=solattach.com|accessdate=2016-05-16|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These mounting systems generally enable retrofitting of solar panels on roofs or as part of the structure of the building (called [[BIPV]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epia.org/solar-pv/faq.html|title=What difference is there between thermal solar energy and Photovoltaic solar energy?|publisher=epia.org|accessdate=2011-07-26|work=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712002651/http://www.epia.org/solar-pv/faq.html|archivedate=2011-07-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Roof mounting ==

{{main|Rooftop photovoltaic power station}}

[[File:Berlin pv-system block-103 20050309 p1010367.jpg|thumb|PV panels mounted on roof]]

The solar array of a [[PV system]] can be mounted on [[rooftop]]s, generally with a few inches gap and parallel to the surface of the roof. If the rooftop is horizontal, the array is mounted with each panel aligned at an angle. If the panels are planned to be mounted before the construction of the roof, the roof can be designed accordingly by installing support brackets for the panels before the materials for the roof are installed. The installation of the solar panels can be undertaken by the crew responsible for installing the roof. If the roof is already constructed, it is relatively easy to retrofit panels directly on top of existing roofing structures. For a small minority of roofs (often not built to code) that are designed so that it is capable of bearing only the weight of the roof, installing solar panels demands that the roof structure must be strengthened before-hand. In all cases of retrofits particular consideration to weather sealing is necessary There are many low-weight designs for PV systems that can be used on either sloped or flat roofs (e.g. plastic wedges or the [[PV-pod]]), most however, rely on a type of extruded aluminum rails (e.g. [[Unirac]]). Recently, tension-based PV racking solutions have been tested successfully that reduce weight and cost.&lt;ref&gt;B.T. Wittbrodt &amp; J.M. Pearce. Total U.S. cost evaluation of low-weight tension-based photovoltaic flat-roof-mounted racking.''Solar Energy'' '''117''' (2015), 89–98.[https://www.academia.edu/12442737/Total_U.S._cost_evaluation_of_low-weight_tension-based_photovoltaic_flat-roof_mounted_racking open access]&lt;/ref&gt;  In some cases, converting to composition shingles, the weight of the removed roof materials can compensate the additional weight of the panels structure. The general practice for installation of roof-mounted solar panels include having a support bracket per hundred watts of panels.&lt;ref name=eco&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecodiy.org/california%20PV/californian%20photovoltaic%20best.htm|title=A GUIDE TO PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV) SYSTEM DESIGN AND INSTALLATION|publisher=ecodiy.org|accessdate=2011-07-26|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bii&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebii.org/pv_2_background.pdf|title=PROCEDURES FOR SOLAR ELECTRIC (PHOTOVOLTAIC abbreviated as PV) SYSTEM DESIGN AND INSTALLATIO|publisher=thebii.org|accessdate=2011-07-26|work=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070508223602/http://www.thebii.org/pv_2_background.pdf|archivedate=2007-05-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ground-mounted ==

Ground-mounted [[PV system]]s are usually large, utility-scale [[photovoltaic power stations]]. The PV array consist of [[solar modules]] held in place by racks or frames that are attached to ground-based mounting supports.&lt;ref&gt;SolarProfessional.com [http://solarprofessional.com/articles/products-equipment/racking/ground-mount-pv-racking-systems Ground-Mount PV Racking Systems] March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources  [http://www.mass.gov/eea/docs/doer/renewables/solar/solar-pv-guide.pdf Ground-Mounted Solar Photovoltaic Systems], December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Ground-based mounting supports include:
* '''Pole mounts''', which are driven directly into the ground or embedded in concrete.
* '''Foundation mounts''', such as concrete slabs or poured footings
* '''Ballasted footing mounts''', such as concrete or steel bases that use weight to secure the solar module system in position and do not require ground penetration. This type of mounting system is well suited for sites where excavation is not possible such as capped landfills and simplifies decommissioning or relocation of solar module systems.

== Mounting as a shade structure ==

[[File:PV external shading device in zero energy building of Singapore.jpg|thumb|PV panels as external shading device in zero-energy building, Singapore]]

Solar panels can also be mounted as shade structures where the solar panels can provide shade instead of patio covers. The cost of such shading systems are generally different from standard patio covers, especially in cases where the entire shade required is provided by the panels. The support structure for the shading systems can be normal systems as the weight of a standard PV array is between 3 and 5 pounds/ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. If the panels are mounted at an angle steeper than normal patio covers, the support structures may require additional strengthening. Other issues that are considered include:

* Simplified array access for maintenance.
* Module wiring may be concealed to maintain the aesthetics of the shading structure.
* Growing vines around the structure must be avoided as they may come in contact with the wiring.&lt;ref name=eco/&gt;&lt;ref name=bii/&gt;

== Building-integrated photovoltaics ==

{{Main|Building-integrated photovoltaics}}

[[Image:CIS Tower.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|The [[CIS Tower]] in [[Manchester]], [[England]] was clad in PV panels at a cost of £5.5 million.  It started feeding electricity to the [[National Grid (UK)|National Grid]] in November 2005]]

Building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) are [[photovoltaic]] materials that are used to replace conventional building materials in parts of the [[building envelope]] such as the roof (tiles), skylights, or facades. They are increasingly being incorporated into the construction of new buildings as a principal or ancillary source of electrical power, although existing buildings may be retrofitted with BIPV modules as well. The advantage of integrated photovoltaics over more common non-integrated systems is that the initial cost can be offset by reducing the amount spent on building materials and labor that would normally be used to construct the part of the building that the BIPV modules replace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbdg.org/resources/bipv.php|title=Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV)|publisher=wbdg.org|accessdate=2011-07-26|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Building-adapted photovoltaics (BAPV) uses solar modules to create solar PV windows and this way, also to retrofit existing building.

== Orientation and inclination ==

A solar cell performs the best when its surface is perpendicular to the sun's rays, which change continuously over the course of the day and season. It is a common practice to tilt a fixed PV module (without [[solar tracker]]) at the same angle as the latitude of array's location to maximize the annual energy yield of module. For example, rooftop PV module at the tropics provides highest annual energy yield when inclination of panel surface is close to horizontal direction. A study in the tropics showed that the orientation of low-slope rooftop PV has negligible impact on annual energy yield, but in the case of PV external sunshade applications, east façade and panel slope of 30–40° are the most suitable location and inclination.&lt;ref name=Saber2014PV&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Saber|first1=Esmail M.|last2=Lee|first2=Siew Eang|last3=Manthapuri|first3=Sumanth|last4=Yi|first4=Wang|last5=Deb|first5=Chirag|title=PV (photovoltaics) performance evaluation and simulation-based energy yield prediction for tropical buildings|journal=Energy|date=July 2014|volume=71|pages=588–595|doi=10.1016/j.energy.2014.04.115|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544214005477}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:TricycleCarriage.jpg|thumb|A cycle rickshaw at rest, [[New York City]], New York]]
'''Rickshaws''' are used in numerous cities in the United States, primarily for their novelty value as an entertaining form of transportation for tourists and locals.  However, they also have environmental benefits and may be quicker than other forms of transport if traffic congestion is high.  Various laws regulate their use in different areas.

==Overview==
The first known commercial use of pedicabs in North America occurred in 1962 at the Seattle [[World's Fair]]. [[San Diego]] and [[New York City]] each host hundreds of pedicabs; dozens of other United States cities also have pedicab services.

In New York, human powered transport is available as an environmentally friendly means of transit. Local residents in New York City, however, view pedicabs primarily as tourist vehicles due to their high fares and their drivers' aggressive sales pitches to pedestrians. At a rate of $5 plus $1 per block ''per person,'' a 20-block (one mile) pedicab ride for two people will cost $50.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.concierge.com/ideas/hotspots/tours/500723?page=1 "Ten Things Not to Do in New York City"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amny.com/urbanite-1.812039/pedicab-driving-no-easy-ride-1.1293582 "Pedicab driving no easy ride"]&lt;/ref&gt; In a taxicab, the same ride would cost under $10.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/passenger/taxicab_rate.shtml "Taxicab Rate of Fare," NYC Taxi &amp; Limousine Commission]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Peter Meitzler of New York's Manhattan Rickshaw Company, a passenger has an entirely different urban experience when one rides in a rickshaw. He says that he uses the word "rickshaw" in his company name because it is internationally known.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smithsonianmagazine.com/issues/2007/march/rickshaw.php "Rickshaws Reinvented – The ancient transportation takes a modern turn"], Dina Modianot-Fox, Smithsonian Magazine, March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''''Shock and Awe: The Story of Electricity''''' is a British [[television]] series outlining aspects of the [[history of electricity]]. The series was a co-production between the [[Open University]] and the [[BBC]] and aired from 6 to 20 October 2011 on [[BBC Four]]. The programs were presented by [[Jim Al-Khalili]].

== Episodes ==
* '''Spark:''' How pioneers unlocked electricity's mysteries and built strange instruments to create it.
* '''The Age of Invention:''' How harnessing the link between magnetism and electricity transformed the world.
* '''Revelations and Revolutions:''' After centuries of experimentation, how we finally came to understand electromagnetism.

=== Spark ===
In the first episode Al-Khalili introduces the history of our understanding of electricity and the harnessing of its power.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Gerard. ''Pick of the day'' [[The Independent]] 1 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He covers the achievements of these "natural philosophers" - &lt;ref&gt;Hardy, Alex. ''Digital choice'' [[The Times]] 1 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francis Hauksbee]], [[Stephen Gray (scientist)|Stephen Gray]], [[Pieter van Musschenbroek|Musschenbroek]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Henry Cavendish]], [[Galvani]], [[Alessandro Volta|Volta]] and [[Humphry Davy]].

The programme starts with Hauksbee's invention of a [[static-electricity generator]] and its subsequent demonstration to the high-minded.&lt;ref name=Sut7/&gt; It covers Franklin and the resulting experiments to capture and tame lightning.&lt;ref&gt;Mueller, Andrew, ''G2: Television''. [[The Guardian]] 6 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The narrative continues with Cavendish's investigations of the electric shock received from the [[torpedo fish]].&lt;ref&gt;[[The Daily Telegraph]], ''Digital choice'' 1 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Khalili expands on the development of the [[electric battery]] following Volta's discovery that simultaneously licking a copper coin and a silver spoon  would generate a tingle of electricity.&lt;ref name=Sut7/&gt; The programme finishes with the first breakthrough in finding a commercial use for electricity:&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Gerard. ''Critic's Choice'' The Independent, 6 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Humphry Davy demonstrating the first [[carbon-arc light]] before members of the [[Royal Institution]].&lt;ref name=Sut7&gt;Sutcliffe, Tom. ''Secrets and lies are worth investigating'' The Independent 7 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Age of Invention ===
In the second episode Al-Khalili covers the scientists who discovered the links between electricity and magnetism leading to a way to generate electric power- &lt;ref&gt;The Daily Telegraph ''Digital choice'' 8 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hans Christian Ørsted|Hans Christian Oersted]], [[Michael Faraday]], [[William Sturgeon]] and [[Joseph Henry]].

The development of commercial applications started with [[Samuel Morse]] and Al-Khalili then tells the story of the [[1866 transatlantic cable]]. He revisits the [[War of Currents]] rivalry between [[Direct current]] and [[Alternating current]].&lt;ref&gt;Dugdale, John; Kinnes, Sally. ''Choice'' [[Sunday Times]] 9 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Revelations and Revolutions ===
In the final episode Al-Khalili brings the story up to date covering the achievements of [[James Clerk Maxwell]]; [[Heinrich Hertz]]; [[Oliver Lodge]]; [[Jagadish Bose]]; [[William Crookes]]; [[Herbert Mataré|Mataré]] &amp; [[Heinrich Welker|Welker]]; and [[William Shockley]].

[[File:Uphill Sleigh Ride.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[Fjord horse]] drawing a sleigh]]
[[File:Horse-drawn sleighs 2012 G1.jpg|thumb|250px|Horse-drawn sleigh, [[Ukraine]], 2012]]
A '''sled''', '''sledge''', or '''sleigh''' is a land vehicle with smooth underside or possessing a separate body supported by two or more smooth, relatively narrow, longitudinal runners that travels by sliding across a surface. Most commonly sleds are used on snow or [[ice]], but in certain cases they may be used on any surfaces, especially on ones with relatively low [[friction]], such as sand or wet grass. Snow sleds are usally used in ice because it reduces thew amount of friction which helps to carry heavy loads.  They may be used to transport passengers, cargo, or both.  Shades of meaning differentiating the three terms often reflect regional variations depending on historical uses and prevailing climate.

In [[British English|Britain]] ''sledge'' is the general term, and more common than ''sled''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/sledge|title=Collins 2012 digital edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Toboggan]]'' is sometimes used synonymously with ''sledge'' but more often to refer to a particular type of sledge without runners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/toboggan|title=Collins 2012 digital edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Sleigh'' refers to a moderate to large-sized, usually open-topped vehicle to carry passengers or goods, and typically drawn by horses, dogs, or reindeer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/sleigh|title=Collins 2012 digital edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In [[American English|American]] usage ''sled'' remains the general term but often implies a smaller device, often for recreational use. ''Sledge'' implies a heavier sled used for moving freight or massive objects (''syn.'' "stone boat").  ''Sleigh'' refers more specifically than in Britain to a vehicle which is essentially a cold-season alternative to a [[carriage]] or [[wagon]] and has seating for passengers; what can be called a dog-sleigh in Britain is known only as a dog-sled in North America.

In [[Australian English|Australia]], where there is  limited snow, ''sleigh'' and ''sledge'' are given equal preference in local parlance.&lt;ref name="Mac"&gt;{{cite book |title= The [[Macquarie Dictionary]], 2nd ed.,|last= |year=1991|publisher= Macquarie Library |location=North Ryde }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[File:Decorative Sled.jpg|thumb|Decorative sled]]

[[File:NMA.0035032.jpg|thumb|Sled on [[Brunnsviken]], [[Stockholm]]. Original av [[Martin Rudolf Heland]] (1765–1814).]]
The people of [[Ancient Egypt]] are thought to have used sledges extensively in the construction of their public works, in particular for the transportation of heavy [[obelisk]]s.

Sleds and sledges were found in the [[Oseberg Ship|Oseberg "Viking" ship]] excavation. Sledges were useful not only in winter but can be drawn over wet fields, muddy roads, and even hard ground, if one helps them along by greasing the blades with oil or alternatively wetting them with water; in cold weather the water will freeze to ice and they glide along more smoothly with less effort to pull them. The sledge was also highly prized, because – unlike wheeled vehicles – it was exempt from tolls.

Until the late 19th century, a closed winter sled, or [[vozok]], provided a high-speed means of transport through the snow-covered plains of European [[Russia]] and [[Siberia]]. It was a means of transport preferred by royals, bishops, and boyars of [[Tsardom of Russia|Muscovy]]. Several royal vozoks of historical importance have been preserved in the [[Kremlin Armoury]].

Man-hauled sledges were the traditional means of transport on British exploring expeditions to the [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]] regions in the 19th and early 20th centuries.  [[Dog sled]]s were used by most others, such as [[Roald Amundsen]]. Today some people use [[kite flying|kites]] to tow exploration sleds in such climes.

[[File:Cargo sled, McMurdo Station (cropped).JPEG|700px|center|thumb|An enormous cargo sled being maneuvered by a 10K-AT "All Terrain" [[Forklift truck|forklift]] at [[McMurdo Station]] in [[Antarctica]]]]

===Etymology===
[[File:HorseandSleighRide.jpg|thumb|250px|Horse-drawn sleigh ride, Pakenham, Ontario, Canada]]
The word ''sled'' comes from [[Middle English]] ''sledde'', which itself has the origins in [[Middle Dutch]] word ''[[wikt:slede#Middle_Dutch|slēde]]'', meaning "sliding" or "slider". The same word shares common ancestry with both ''sleigh'' and ''sledge''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/sledge|title=thefreedictionary entrance on "sled"|publisher=Farlex}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word sleigh, on the other hand, is an anglicized form of the modern Dutch word "slee" and was introduced to the English language by Dutch immigrants to North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/sleigh|title=thefreedictionary entrance on "sleigh"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern sleds==
===Sleds for recreational sledding===
[[File:Sanki.JPG|thumb|250px|A child's sledge (19th century), [[Radomysl Castle]]&lt;ref&gt;Bogomolets O. Radomysl castle-Museum on the Royal Road Via Regia. — Kyiv, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Casa Ostra4.jpg|thumb|250px|Old horse-drawn sled at a museum]]

There are several types of widely used recreational sleds designed for sliding down snowy hills ([[sledding]]):&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pariconsleds.com/ Parigon Sleds]&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Toboggan]], an elongated sled without runners, usually made from wood or plastic, but sometimes made from [[sheet metal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hörnerschlitten|url=http://www.schlitten-bob.de/Hoernerschlitten_idQQ1ZZmodeQQartlistZZcatQQ8|publisher=www.schlitten-bob.de|accessdate=19 May 2013|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Saucer, a round sled curved like a [[contact lens]], also without runners and usually made out of plastic or metal
* Steel runner sled or [[Flexible Flyer]], a steerable wooden sled with thin metal runners&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Snow Racer von Stiga finden Sie in der Rubrik Stiga Schlitten!|url=http://www.schlitten-bob.de/Snowracer_idQQ1ZZmodeQQartlistZZcatQQ13|publisher=www.schlitten-bob.de|accessdate=19 May 2013|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Kicksled]] or spark, a human-powered sled
* Inflatable sled or [[Tubing (recreation)#Snow|tube]], a plastic membrane filled with air to make a very lightweight sled
* [[Foam]] slider, a flat piece of durable foam with handles and a smooth underside
* Backcountry sled, a deep, steerable plastic sled to kneel on with pads and a seat belt

===Sleds for competitive sledding===
A few types of sleds are used only for a specific sport:

* [[Bobsled]] (British bobsleigh), an aerodynamic composite bodied vehicle on lightweight runners
* [[Luge]] and the [[Skeleton (sport)|skeleton]], tiny one or two-person sleds with runners&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Herzlich Willkommen !|url=http://www.schlittendiscount.de/schlitten-holzschlitten/willkommen/|publisher=www.schlittendiscount.de|accessdate=19 May 2013|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hörnerschlitten|url=http://www.hoernerrodel.de/shop/hornerschlitten-110-cm-modell-lattensitz/|publisher=www.hoernerrodel.de|accessdate=19 May 2013|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various types of sleds are pulled by animals such as [[reindeer]], horses, [[mule]]s, [[oxen]], or dogs.

'''Spontaneous symmetry breaking''' is a [[spontaneous process]] of [[symmetry breaking]], by which a physical system in a [[Symmetry (physics)|symmetric]] state ends up in an asymmetric state.&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir A. Miransky, ''Dynamical Symmetry Breaking in Quantum Field Theories''. Pg [https://books.google.com/books?id=UOpY9kmL3YQC&amp;pg=PA15 15].  {{ISBN|9810215584}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patterns of Symmetry Breaking. Edited by Henryk Arodz, Jacek Dziarmaga, Wojciech Hubert Zurek. Pg  [https://books.google.com/books?id=uF1P7cFFsNMC&amp;pg=PA141 141].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bubbles, Voids and Bumps in Time: The New Cosmology. Edited by James Cornell. Pg [https://books.google.com/books?id=vRIs8mY1yZcC&amp;pg=PA125 125].&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, it can describe systems where the [[equations of motion]] or the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] obey symmetries, but the lowest-energy [[vacuum solution]]s do not exhibit that same [[Symmetry (physics)|symmetry]]. When the system goes to one of those vacuum solutions, the symmetry is broken for perturbations around that vacuum even though the entire Lagrangian retains that symmetry.

==Overview==

In [[explicit symmetry breaking]], if we consider two outcomes, the probability of a pair of outcomes can be different.  By definition, spontaneous symmetry breaking requires the existence of a symmetric probability distribution—any pair of outcomes has the same probability.  In other words, the underlying laws{{clarify|date=December 2016}} are [[Invariant (physics)|invariant]] under a [[Symmetry (physics)|symmetry]] transformation.

The system, as a whole{{clarify|date=December 2016}}, changes under such transformations.

Phases of matter, such as crystals, magnets, and conventional superconductors, as well as simple phase transitions can be described by spontaneous symmetry breaking. Notable exceptions include topological phases of matter like the [[fractional quantum Hall effect]].

==Examples==

===Mexican hat potential===
[[Image:Mexican hat potential polar.svg|270px|thumb|Graph of Goldstone's "Mexican hat" potential function &lt;math&gt;V(\phi)&lt;/math&gt;.]]

Consider a symmetric upward dome with a trough circling the bottom. If a ball is put at the very peak of the dome, the system is symmetric with respect to a rotation around the center axis.  But the ball may ''spontaneously break'' this symmetry by rolling down the dome into the trough, a point of lowest energy. Afterward, the ball has come to a rest at some fixed point on the perimeter.  The dome and the ball retain their individual symmetry, but the system does not.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald M. Edelman, Bright Air, Brilliant Fire: On the Matter of the Mind (New York: BasicBooks, 1992) [https://books.google.com/books?id=NGIIGZmarOAC&amp;pg=PA203 203].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the simplest idealized relativistic model, the spontaneously broken symmetry is summarized through an illustrative [[scalar field theory]]. The relevant [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] of a scalar field &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, which essentially dictates how a system behaves, can be split up into kinetic and potential terms,
:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} = \partial^\mu \phi \partial_\mu \phi - V(\phi).&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

It is in this potential term &lt;math&gt;V(\phi)&lt;/math&gt; that the symmetry breaking is triggered. An example of a potential, due to [[Jeffrey Goldstone]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Goldstone | first1 = J. | doi = 10.1007/BF02812722 | title = Field theories with " Superconductor " solutions | journal = Il Nuovo Cimento | volume = 19 | pages = 154–164 | year = 1961 | pmid =  | pmc = | bibcode = 1961NCim...19..154G }}&lt;/ref&gt; is illustrated in the graph at the right.
:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;V(\phi) = -10|\phi|^2 + |\phi|^4 \,&lt;/math&gt;.|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

This potential has an infinite number of possible [[minimum|minima]] (vacuum states) given by
:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\phi = \sqrt{5} e^{i\theta} &lt;/math&gt;.|{{EquationRef|3}}}}
for any real ''θ'' between 0 and 2''π''. The system also has an unstable vacuum state corresponding to {{nowrap|1=''Φ'' = 0}}. This state has a [[Unitary group|U(1)]] symmetry. However, once the system falls into a specific stable vacuum state (amounting to a choice of ''θ''), this symmetry will appear to be lost, or "spontaneously broken".

In fact, any other choice of ''θ'' would have exactly the same energy, implying the existence of a massless [[Goldstone boson|Nambu–Goldstone boson]], the mode running around the circle at the minimum of this potential, and indicating there is some memory of the original symmetry in the Lagrangian.

===Other examples===
* For [[ferromagnet]]ic materials, the underlying laws are invariant under spatial rotations. Here, the order parameter is the [[magnetization]], which measures the magnetic dipole density. Above the [[Curie temperature]], the order parameter is zero, which is spatially invariant, and there is no symmetry breaking. Below the Curie temperature, however, the magnetization acquires a constant nonvanishing value, which points in a certain direction (in the idealized situation where we have full equilibrium; otherwise, translational symmetry gets broken as well). The residual rotational symmetries which leave the orientation of this vector invariant remain unbroken, unlike the other rotations which do not and are thus spontaneously broken.
* The laws describing a solid are invariant under the full [[Euclidean group]], but the solid itself spontaneously breaks this group down to a [[space group]]. The displacement and the orientation are the order parameters.
* General relativity has a Lorentz symmetry, but in [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|FRW cosmological models]], the mean 4-velocity field defined by averaging over the velocities of the galaxies (the galaxies act like gas particles at cosmological scales) acts as an order parameter breaking this symmetry. Similar comments can be made about the cosmic microwave background.
* For the [[electroweak]] model, as explained earlier, a component of the Higgs field provides the order parameter breaking the electroweak gauge symmetry to the electromagnetic gauge symmetry. Like the ferromagnetic example, there is a phase transition at the electroweak temperature. The same comment about us not tending to notice broken symmetries suggests why it took so long for us to discover electroweak unification.
* In superconductors, there is a condensed-matter collective field ψ, which acts as the order parameter breaking the electromagnetic gauge symmetry.
* Take a thin cylindrical plastic rod and push both ends together. Before buckling, the system is symmetric under rotation, and so visibly cylindrically symmetric. But after buckling, it looks different, and asymmetric. Nevertheless, features of the cylindrical symmetry are still there: ignoring friction, it would take no force to freely spin the rod around, displacing the ground state in time, and amounting to an oscillation of vanishing frequency, unlike the radial oscillations in the direction of the buckle. This spinning mode is effectively the requisite [[Goldstone boson|Nambu–Goldstone boson]].
* Consider a uniform layer of [[fluid]] over an infinite horizontal plane. This system has all the symmetries of the Euclidean plane. But now heat the bottom surface uniformly so that it becomes much hotter than the upper surface. When the temperature gradient becomes large enough, [[convection cell]]s will form, breaking the Euclidean symmetry.
* Consider a bead on a circular hoop that is rotated about a vertical [[diameter]]. As the [[rotational velocity]] is increased gradually from rest, the bead will initially stay at its initial [[equilibrium point]] at the bottom of the hoop (intuitively stable, lowest [[gravitational potential]]). At a certain critical rotational velocity, this point will become unstable and the bead will jump to one of two other newly created equilibria, [[equidistant]] from the center. Initially, the system is symmetric with respect to the diameter, yet after passing the critical velocity, the bead ends up in one of the two new equilibrium points, thus breaking the symmetry.

==Spontaneous symmetry breaking in physics==
[[File:Spontaneous symmetry breaking (explanatory diagram).png|thumb|right|250px|''Spontaneous symmetry breaking illustrated'': At high energy levels (''left'') the ball settles in the center, and the result is symmetric. At lower energy levels (''right''), the overall "rules" remain symmetric, but the symmetric  "[[sombrero|Mexican hat]]" enforces an asymmetric outcome, since eventually the ball must rest at some random spot on the bottom, "spontaneously", and not all others.]]

===Particle physics===
In [[particle physics]] the [[force carrier]] particles are normally specified by field equations with [[gauge symmetry]]; their equations predict that certain measurements will be the same at any point in the field. For instance, field equations might predict that the mass of two quarks is constant. Solving the equations to find the mass of each quark might give two solutions. In one solution, quark A is heavier than quark B. In the second solution, quark B is heavier than quark A ''by the same amount''. The symmetry of the equations is not reflected by the individual solutions, but it is reflected by the range of solutions.

An actual measurement reflects only one solution, representing a breakdown in the symmetry of the underlying theory. "Hidden" is a better term than "broken", because the symmetry is always there in these equations. This phenomenon is called [[Spontaneous magnetization|''spontaneous'']] symmetry breaking (SSB) because ''nothing'' (that we know of) breaks the symmetry in the equations.&lt;ref name="Weinberg2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Weinberg|title=Dreams of a Final Theory: The Scientist's Search for the Ultimate Laws of Nature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rsg3PE_9_ccC|date=20 April 2011|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-78786-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|194–195}}

====Chiral symmetry====
{{Main article|Chiral symmetry breaking}}
Chiral symmetry breaking is an example of spontaneous symmetry breaking affecting the [[chiral symmetry]] of the [[strong interactions]] in particle physics. It is a property of [[quantum chromodynamics]], the [[quantum field theory]] describing these interactions, and is responsible for the bulk of the mass (over 99%) of the [[nucleons]], and thus of all common matter, as it converts very light bound [[quarks]] into 100 times heavier constituents of [[baryons]]. The approximate [[Nambu–Goldstone boson]]s in this spontaneous symmetry breaking process are the [[pions]], whose mass is an order of magnitude lighter than the mass of the nucleons. It served as the prototype and significant ingredient of the Higgs mechanism underlying the electroweak symmetry breaking.

====Higgs mechanism====
{{Main article|Higgs mechanism|Yukawa interaction}}

The strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces can all be understood as arising from [[gauge symmetry|gauge symmetries]]. The [[Higgs mechanism]], the spontaneous symmetry breaking of gauge symmetries, is an important component in understanding the [[superconductivity]] of metals and the origin of particle masses in the standard model of particle physics. One important consequence of the distinction between true symmetries and ''gauge symmetries'', is that the spontaneous breaking of a gauge symmetry does not give rise to characteristic massless Nambu–Goldstone physical modes, but only massive modes, like the plasma mode in a superconductor, or the Higgs mode observed in particle physics.

In the standard model of particle physics, spontaneous symmetry breaking of the {{nowrap|SU(2) × U(1)}} gauge symmetry associated with the electro-weak force generates masses for several particles, and separates the electromagnetic and weak forces. The [[W and Z bosons]] are the elementary particles that mediate the [[weak interaction]], while the [[photon]] mediates the [[electromagnetic interaction]]. At energies much greater than 100 GeV all these particles behave in a similar manner. The [[Unified field theory#Modern progress|Weinberg–Salam theory]] predicts that, at lower energies, this symmetry is broken so that the photon and the massive W and Z bosons emerge.&lt;ref&gt;A Brief History of Time, Stephen Hawking, Bantam; 10th anniversary edition (September 1, 1998). pp. 73–74.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, fermions develop mass consistently.

Without spontaneous symmetry breaking, the [[Standard Model]] of elementary particle interactions requires the existence of a number of particles. However, some particles (the [[W and Z bosons]]) would then be predicted to be massless, when, in reality, they are observed to have mass. To overcome this, spontaneous symmetry breaking is augmented by the [[Higgs mechanism]] to give these particles mass. It also suggests the presence of a new particle, the [[Higgs boson]], detected in 2012.

[[Superconductivity]] of metals is a condensed-matter analog of the Higgs phenomena, in which a condensate of Cooper pairs of electrons spontaneously breaks the U(1) gauge symmetry associated with light and electromagnetism.

===Condensed matter physics===
Most phases of matter can be understood through the lens of spontaneous symmetry breaking. For example, crystals are periodic arrays of atoms that are not invariant under all translations (only under a small subset of translations by a lattice vector). Magnets have north and south poles that are oriented in a specific direction, breaking [[rotational symmetry]]. In addition to these examples, there are a whole host of other symmetry-breaking phases of matter including nematic phases of liquid crystals, charge- and spin-density waves, superfluids and many others.

There are several known examples of matter that cannot be described by spontaneous symmetry breaking, including: topologically ordered phases of matter like [[Fractional quantum Hall effect|fractional quantum Hall liquids]], and [[Quantum spin liquid|spin-liquids]]. These states do not break any symmetry, but are distinct phases of matter. Unlike the case of spontaneous symmetry breaking, there is not a general framework for describing such states.&lt;ref name=chen&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chen | first1 = Xie | authorlink3 = Xiao-Gang Wen | last2 = Gu | first2 = Zheng-Cheng | last3 = Wen | first3 = Xiao-Gang | year = 2010 | title = Local unitary transformation, long-range quantum entanglement, wave function renormalization, and topological order | journal = Phys.

====Continuous symmetry====
The ferromagnet is the canonical system which spontaneously breaks the continuous symmetry of the spins below the [[Curie temperature]] and at {{nowrap|1=''h'' = 0}}, where ''h'' is the external magnetic field. Below the [[Curie temperature]] the energy of the system is invariant under inversion of the magnetization ''m''('''x''') such that {{nowrap|1=''m''('''x''') = −''m''(−'''x''')}}. The symmetry is spontaneously broken as {{nowrap|''h'' → 0}} when the Hamiltonian becomes invariant under the inversion transformation, but the expectation value is not invariant.

Spontaneously-symmetry-broken phases of matter are characterized by an order parameter that describes the quantity which breaks the symmetry under consideration. For example, in a magnet, the order parameter is the local magnetization.

Spontaneously breaking of a continuous symmetry is inevitably accompanied by gapless (meaning that these modes do not cost any energy to excite) Nambu–Goldstone modes associated with slow long-wavelength fluctuations of the order parameter. For example, vibrational modes in a crystal, known as phonons, are associated with slow density fluctuations of the crystal's atoms. The associated Goldstone mode for magnets are oscillating waves of spin known as spin-waves. For symmetry-breaking  states, whose order parameter is not a conserved quantity, Nambu–Goldstone modes are typically massless and propagate at a constant velocity.

An important theorem, due to Mermin and Wagner, states that, at finite temperature, thermally activated fluctuations of Nambu–Goldstone modes destroy the long-range order, and prevent spontaneous symmetry breaking in one- and two-dimensional systems. Similarly, quantum fluctuations of the order parameter prevent most types of continuous symmetry breaking in one-dimensional systems even at zero temperature (an important exception is ferromagnets, whose order parameter, magnetization, is an exactly conserved quantity and does not have any quantum fluctuations).

Other long-range interacting systems such as cylindrical curved surfaces interacting via the [[Coulomb potential]] or [[Yukawa potential]] has been shown to break translational and rotational symmetries.&lt;ref&gt;

===Dynamical symmetry breaking===
Dynamical symmetry breaking (DSB) is a special form of spontaneous symmetry breaking where the ground state of the system has reduced symmetry properties compared to its theoretical description ([[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]]).

Dynamical breaking of a global symmetry is a spontaneous symmetry breaking, that happens not at the (classical) tree level (i.e. at the level of the bare action), but due to quantum corrections (i.e. at the level of the [[effective action]]).

Dynamical breaking of a gauge symmetry {{ref|note1}} is subtler. In the conventional spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking, there exists  an unstable [[Higgs particle]] in the theory, which drives the vacuum to a symmetry-broken phase (see e.g. [[Electroweak interaction]]). In dynamical gauge symmetry breaking, however, no unstable Higgs particle operates  in the theory, but the bound states of the system itself provide the unstable fields that render the phase transition. For example, Bardeen, Hill, and Lindner published a paper which attempts to replace the conventional [[Higgs mechanism]] in the [[standard model]], by a DSB that is driven by a bound state of top-antitop quarks (such models, where a composite particle plays the role of the Higgs boson, are often referred to as "Composite Higgs models").&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dynamical breaking of gauge symmetries is often due to creation of a [[fermionic condensate]]; for example the [[quark condensate]], which is connected to the [[Chiral symmetry breaking|dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry]] in [[quantum chromodynamics]]. Conventional [[superconductivity]] is the paradigmatic example from the condensed matter side, where phonon-mediated attractions lead electrons to become bound in pairs and then condense, thereby breaking the electromagnetic gauge symmetry.

==Generalisation and technical usage==
For spontaneous symmetry breaking to occur, there must be a system in which there are several equally likely outcomes. The system as a whole is therefore [[Symmetry (physics)|symmetric]] with respect to these outcomes. However, if the system is sampled (i.e. if the system is actually used or interacted with in any way), a specific outcome must occur. Though the system as a whole is symmetric, it is never encountered with this symmetry, but only in one specific asymmetric state. Hence, the symmetry is said to be spontaneously broken in that theory. Nevertheless, the fact that each outcome is equally likely is a reflection of the underlying symmetry, which is thus often dubbed "hidden symmetry", and has crucial formal consequences. (See the article on the [[Nambu–Goldstone boson|Goldstone boson]].)

When a theory is symmetric with respect to a [[symmetry group]], but requires that one element of the group be distinct, then spontaneous symmetry breaking has occurred. The theory must not dictate ''which'' member is distinct, only that ''one is''. From this point on, the theory can be treated as if this element actually is distinct, with the proviso that any results found in this way must be resymmetrized, by taking the average of each of the elements of the group being the distinct one.

The crucial concept in physics theories is the [[order parameter]]. If there is a field (often a background field) which acquires an expectation value (not necessarily a [[vacuum expectation value|''vacuum'' expectation value]]) which is not invariant under the symmetry in question, we say that the system is in the [[ordered phase]], and the symmetry is spontaneously broken. This is because other subsystems interact with the order parameter, which specifies a "frame of reference" to be measured against. In that case, the [[vacuum state]] does not obey the initial symmetry (which would keep it invariant, in the linearly realized  '''Wigner mode''' in which it would be a singlet), and, instead changes under the (hidden) symmetry, now implemented in the (nonlinear) '''Nambu–Goldstone mode'''. Normally, in the absence of the Higgs mechanism, massless [[Goldstone boson]]s arise.

The symmetry group can be discrete, such as the [[space group]] of a crystal, or continuous (e.g., a [[Lie group]]), such as the rotational symmetry of space. However, if the system contains only a single spatial dimension, then only discrete symmetries may be broken in a [[vacuum state]] of the full [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]], although a classical solution may break a continuous symmetry.

==Nobel Prize==
On October 7, 2008, the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] awarded the 2008 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] to three scientists for their work in subatomic physics symmetry breaking. [[Yoichiro Nambu]], of the [[University of Chicago]], won half of the prize for the discovery of the mechanism of spontaneous broken symmetry in the context of the strong interactions, specifically [[chiral symmetry breaking]]. Physicists [[Makoto Kobayashi (physicist)|Makoto Kobayashi]] and [[Toshihide Maskawa]], of [[Kyoto University]], shared the other half of the prize for discovering the origin of the [[Explicit symmetry breaking|explicit breaking]] of CP symmetry in the weak interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Nobel Foundation|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 2008|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2008/index.html|work=nobelprize.org|accessdate=January 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This origin is ultimately reliant on the Higgs mechanism, but, so far understood as a "just so" feature of Higgs couplings, not a spontaneously broken symmetry phenomenon.

The '''Stele of Meli-Šipak''' is an ancient [[Mesopotamian]] fragment of the bottom part of a large rectangular stone edifice engraved with reliefs and the remains of [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] and [[Elamite language|Elamite]] inscriptions. It was taken as spoil of war by [[Elam]]ite king [[Shutruk-Nakhunte|Šutruk-Naḫḫunte I]] during his invasion of [[Babylonia]] which deposed [[Kassites|Kassite]] king [[Zababa-shuma-iddin|Zababa-šuma-iddina]]. It was one of the objects found at [[Susa]] between 1900 and 1904 by the French excavation team under [[Jacques de Morgan]] that seems to have formed part of an ancient Museum of trophies, or ''ex-voto'' offerings to the deity [[Inshushinak|Inšušinak]], in a courtyard adjacent to the main temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | title = Classification, Historiography and Monumental Authority: the Babylonian Entitlement Narûs (Kudurrus) | author = Kathryn E. Slanski | journal = JCS | volume = 52 | year = 2000 | page = 96 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The stele==

The limestone stele is engraved with towers, crowning battlements and separating a crenelated wall fortification below, where there is an archway in the lower of perhaps three [[register (sculpture)|register]]s. At least one row of divine symbols appears in an upper register. A human figure dressed in an ornate fringed robe and a high crown of feathers, faces a ship. A standing nude figure has been intentionally chiseled away.&lt;ref name=seidl&gt;{{ cite book | title = Die Babylonischen Kudurru-Reliefs: Symbole Mesopotamischer Gottheiten | author = Ursula Seidl | publisher = Academic Press Fribourg | year = 1989 | pages = 31–32 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The object was first published by [[Jean-Vincent Scheil]] in 1902&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = Mémoires de la Délégation en Perse, Tome IV: Textes Élamites - Sémitiques | author = V. Scheil | location = Paris | year = 1902 | pages = 163–165 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is currently kept in the [[Musée du Louvre]] in Paris, with excavation reference Sb 14 and Museum reference AS 6049. It is the [[colophon (publishing)|colophon]] added by Šutruk-Naḫḫunte (one of several, but which is very similar to that inscribed on the [[Naram-Sin of Akkad#Victory_stele|Victory stele of Narām-Sîn]]&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = Die einheimischen Quellen zur Geschichte Elams, Volume 1 | author = Georg Hüsing | publisher = J.C. Hinrichs | year = 1916 | pages = 52–53 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), written perpendicular to the Middle Babylonian cuneiform and up one of the carved towers, which identifies it as an artifact of [[Meli-Shipak II|Meli-Šipak]], as the remnants of the original inscription do not provide any historical information:

{{quote|I (am) Šutruk-Naḫ[ḫunte, the son] of [Ḫalluduš-Inšušin]ak, the beloved servant [of (the god) Inšušinak], the king of Anzan [(and) Susa, the enlarge]er of [my realm, the caretaker of Elam, [the prince of Elam].As Inšušinak, [my god, instr]uct[ed me, I smote] (the land) Karintaš.

Slanski | publisher = ASOR | year = 2003 | pages = 194–196 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The royal name preserved is given by Brinkman as &lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;˹''Me-''x˺ [   ] which he described as providing “little support for such an interpretation”&lt;ref name=brinkman&gt;{{ cite book | title = Materials and Studies for Kassite History, Vol. I (MSKH I) | chapter = * Meli-Šipak | author = J. A. Brinkman | publisher = Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago | year = 1976 | page = 258 }} S.5.1.&lt;/ref&gt; while Slanski observed that the faint traces following ˹''Me''˺ conform rather well to the sign ''–li-''. Little more of the text other than the tail end of the curse formula is preserved:

{{quote|[Gula, mistress of] the gods, may she afflict him with her oozing (sores), a persistent carbuncle, so that he may bathe in blood and pus like water!&lt;ref name=slanski/&gt;}}

This is reminiscent of the curses which appear on column seven of the [[Melišipak kudurru-Land grant to Marduk-apal-iddina I|Land grant to Marduk-apal-iddina I kudurru]], and provides the main reason for identifying this object within the genre of kudurrus, the Babylonian entitlement ''narûs''.&lt;ref name=seidl/&gt;

'''TANS Perú Flight 204''' refers to a domestic scheduled [[Lima]]–[[Pucallpa]]–[[Iquitos]] passenger service, operated with a [[Boeing 737-200 Advanced]], that crashed on 23 August 2005 on approach to [[Pucallpa Airport]], {{convert|4|mi}} off the airfield, following an [[emergency landing]] attempt because of bad weather, killing 40 of the 98 passengers and crew aboard.

==Aircraft==
The aircraft involved was a 1981-built [[Boeing 737-200 Advanced|Boeing 737-244 Advanced]], [[Aircraft registration|registered]] OB-1809, which had been [[Aircraft lease|lease]]d to TANS Perú from the South African lessor company [[Safair]] two months prior to the accident.&lt;ref name="TANS confirms 57 survivors in 737-200 crash" /&gt; With [[manufacturer's serial number]] 22580 and powered with two [[Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D|Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D-17A]] engines, the airframe had its maiden flight on 4 August 1981, and was originally delivered to [[South African Airways]].&lt;ref name="ASN"&gt;{{ASN accident|id= 20050823-0|accessdate= 16 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= TANS OB-1809-P aircraft history|url= http://www.airfleets.net/ficheapp/plane-b737-22580.htm|publisher= Airfleets.net|accessdate= 24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the accident the aircraft had accumulated 49,865 flight hours and 45,262 cycles,&lt;ref name="Final report"/&gt; and was {{Age|1981|8|4|2005|8|23}} years old.

==Description of the accident==
There was an unusual developing [[cold front]] in the vicinity of Pucallpa, minutes before the event took place, with [[cloud top]]s estimated to be {{convert|45000|ft}} high.&lt;ref name="Final report"/&gt; Instead of diverting to another airport, the crew initiated the approach to Pucallpa Airport with torrential rain, hail and strong winds.&lt;ref name="58 walk away from Peruvian plane crash"/&gt; Some {{cardinal to word|10}} minutes before the scheduled time for landing the aircraft started rocking.&lt;ref name="58 walk away from Peruvian plane crash"/&gt; Realising that the airport could not be safely reached amid the worsening weather conditions, the pilot attempted an emergency landing. The aircraft was flying through a [[hail]]storm for the last 32 seconds of its ill-fated flight when it was seemingly taken down by a wind shear, hit tree tops, impacted terrain in a [[swamp]] located {{convert|3.8|nmi}} ahead of the [[runway]] threshold, broke up as it [[Emergency landing|crash landed]] and burst into flames, leaving a path of debris and flaming fuel {{convert|100|ft}} wide and {{convert|0.8|nmi}} long.&lt;ref name="Final report"/&gt;&lt;ref name="58 walk away from Peruvian plane crash"/&gt; The wreckage of the airplane was engulfed by the fire.&lt;ref name="Final report"/&gt;

There were 91 passengers and seven [[Aircrew|crew member]]s on board; {{cardinal|35}} passengers and {{cardinal to word|5}} crew lost their lives in the accident.&lt;ref name="Final report" /&gt;{{rp|7}} Non-[[Peru]]vian occupants of the aircraft included 11 [[Americans]], one Australian, one Colombian, and one [[Spain|Spaniard]]; Italians were also aboard, but the actual figures for them depend upon the source.&lt;ref name="58 walk away from Peruvian plane crash" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Plane crashes in Peruvian jungle"&gt;{{cite news|title=Plane crashes in Peruvian jungle |work=[[BBC News]] |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4178868.stm |date=24 August 2005 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67aNlpfwj?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4178868.stm |archivedate=11 May 2012 |accessdate=11 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the fatalities were recorded for passengers travelling in the front of the aircraft.&lt;ref name="Final report" /&gt; Fifty-eight people survived the accident, many of them suffering serious injuries, mostly burns and broken limbs.&lt;ref name="Final report"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Plane crashes in Peruvian jungle"/&gt;

==Investigation==
Investigation of the crash site was hindered by looters, who descended upon the crash and stole various elements to be sold for scrap.&lt;ref name="Escape from flight 204" /&gt; A {{US$|500|2005|link=yes}} reward did succeed in securing the return of the [[flight data recorder]].&lt;ref name="Data recorder from Peru plane crash found" /&gt; After 312 days of investigations, there were no reports of any technical malfunction.&lt;ref name="Final report"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ASN"/&gt; The official cause of the accident was determined to be [[pilot error]] for not following standard procedures under adverse weather conditions.&lt;ref name="Final report"/&gt; The pilot took control of the plane, but the co-pilot did not immediately monitor the instruments; as a result, the crew did not notice the rapid descent in the few crucial seconds they had where they could have avoided danger.  According to [[Aviation Safety Network]], the accident ranks among the deadliest ones that took place in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Accident record for 2005|work= Aviation Safety Network|accessdate= 11 May 2012|url= http://aviation-safety.net/database/dblist.php?Year=2005&amp;lang=&amp;page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the second major crash involving a TANS Perú airplane in slightly over two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Accident record for TANS Perú|work= Aviation Safety Network|url= http://aviation-safety.net/database/operator/airline.php?var=4736|accessdate= 16 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/24/world/americas/24iht-web.0824peru.html|title= At least 41 dead in Peruvian plane crash|location= [[Lima]]|work= [[The New York Times]]|date= 24 August 2005|archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/67aUXB0iB?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/24/world/americas/24iht-web.0824peru.html?_r=1|archivedate= 11 May 2012|accessdate= 11 May 2012|quote= In January 2003, a TANS twin engine Fokker 28 turbojet, plowed into a 11,550-foot (3,465-meter) high mountain in Peru's northern jungle, killing all 42 passengers – including eight children – and four crew members aboard.|deadurl= yes|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{other uses|Tron (disambiguation)}}
A '''tron''' was a weighing beam in medieval [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], usually located in the marketplaces of [[burgh]]s. There are various roads and buildings  in several Scottish towns that are named after the tron. For example, [[Trongate]] in Glasgow and [[Tron Kirk]] in Edinburgh. Etymologically the word is derived from the [[Old French]] ''tronel'' or ''troneau'', meaning "balance".&lt;ref name=scan/&gt;

==Measurement of weight in medieval Scotland==

From the 12th century the city fathers of Scottish burghs needed to standardise weights and measurements, partly to collect the correct taxation on goods, and partly to stop unscrupulous merchants shortchanging citizens. Trons were set up in marketplaces throughout Scotland, with each burgh with its own set of, sometimes differing, weights.&lt;ref name=scan&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scan.org.uk/measures/background.asp |title=Scottish Weights and Measures: Background |work=SCAN Weights and Measures Guide |publisher=Scottish Archive Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some burghs had more than one tron; in [[Edinburgh]] a butter tron was located at the head of the West Bow, while a salt tron was located further down the [[Royal Mile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.capitalcollections.org.uk/index.php?a=indexes&amp;s=item&amp;key=IYToxOntpOjA7czoxMjoiV2VpZ2ggSG91c2VzIjt9&amp;pg=1 |title=Weigh House or Butter Tron |work=Capital Collections |publisher=City of Edinburgh Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/52464/details/edinburgh+high+street+tron/ |title=Edinburgh, High Street, Tron |work=[[CANMORE]] |publisher=[[Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Truss uplift''' or '''truss lift''' is when the wood in wooden trusses shrinks, or cures, and the bottom most piece bows upwards, most notably near the middle. Truss lift is an issue in wood frame construction where non-load bearing drywall walls meet drywall ceilings, as the truss lifts it pulls the ceiling drywall up. This in turn pulls the angle tape out of the corner and can damage the spray texture. One solution is to not fasten the ceiling drywall within two feet of a non load bearing wall, and rather use the drywall on the wall as support. This technique will allow the ceiling board to bow down and stay tight to the angle over time as the truss lifts.

'''Tungsten carbide''' ([[chemical formula]]: '''WC''') is a [[chemical compound]] (specifically, a [[carbide]]) containing equal parts of [[tungsten]] and [[carbon]] atoms. In its most basic form, tungsten carbide is a fine gray powder, but it can be pressed and formed into shapes through a process called [[sintering]] for use in [[industrial machinery]], [[cutting tool]]s, [[abrasive]]s, [[armor-piercing round]]s, other tools and instruments, and [[jewelry]].

Tungsten carbide is approximately twice as stiff as  [[steel]], with a [[Young's modulus]] of approximately 530–700 GPa (77,000 to 102,000 ksi),&lt;ref name=Blau2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kurlov3/&gt;&lt;ref name=Groover2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cardarelli2008/&gt; and is double the density of [[steel]]—nearly midway between that of [[lead]] and [[gold]]. It is comparable with [[corundum]] (α-{{chem|link=aluminium oxide|Al|2|O|3}}) in [[hardness]] and can only be polished and finished with abrasives of superior hardness such as [[cubic boron nitride]] and diamond powder, wheels, and compounds.

==Naming==
Historically referred to as Wolfram, ''Wolf Rahm'', wolframite ore discovered by Peter Woulfe was then later carburized and cemented with a binder creating a composite now called "cemented tungsten carbide".&lt;ref&gt;Helmenstine, Anne Marie. [http://chemistry.about.com/od/elementfacts/a/tungstenwolfram.htm Tungsten or Wolfram Facts]. chemistry.about.com&lt;/ref&gt; Tungsten is Swedish for "heavy stone".

Colloquially among workers in various industries (such as [[machining]] and [[carpentry]]), tungsten carbide is often simply called ''carbide'', despite the imprecision of the usage. Among the lay public, the growing popularity of tungsten carbide rings has also led to consumers calling the material ''tungsten''.

==Synthesis==
Tungsten carbide is prepared by reaction of [[tungsten]] metal and carbon at 1400–2000&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=Pierson&gt;{{cite book |first=Hugh O.|last=Pierson|year=1992|title=Handbook of Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD): Principles, Technology, and Applications|publisher=William Andrew Inc.|isbn=0-8155-1300-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other methods include a patented lower temperature fluid bed process that reacts either tungsten metal or blue {{chem|link=tungsten(VI) oxide|WO|3}} with CO/{{CO2}} mixture and {{chem|H|2}} between 900 and 1200&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;Lackner, A. and Filzwieser A.

WC can also be produced by heating {{chem|link=tungsten(VI) oxide|WO|3}} with graphite: directly at 900&amp;nbsp;°C or in hydrogen at 670&amp;nbsp;°C following by carburization in argon at 1000&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zhong|first=Y. |journal=Journal of Materials Science|year=2011|volume=46|pages=6323–6331|doi= 10.1007/s10853-010-4937-y|title=A study on the synthesis of nanostructured WC–10 wt% Co particles from {{chem|WO|3}}, {{chem|Co|3|O|4}}, and graphite|issue=19|last2=Shaw |first2=L. |bibcode=2011JMatS..46.6323Z}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chemical vapor deposition]] methods that have been investigated include:&lt;ref name=Pierson/&gt;

==Applications==

===Cutting tools for machining===
{{See also|Cemented carbide}}
[[File:Tungsten carbide.jpg|220px|thumbnail|left|Cemented carbide drill and end mills]]
[[Sintering|Sintered]] tungsten carbide - cobalt [[cutting tool (machining)|cutting tools]] are very abrasion resistant and can also withstand higher temperatures than standard [[high-speed steel|high-speed steel (HSS)]] tools. Carbide cutting surfaces are often used for [[machining]] through materials such as [[carbon steel]] or [[stainless steel]], and in applications where steel tools would wear quickly, such as high-quantity and high-precision production. Because carbide tools maintain a sharp cutting edge better than steel tools, they generally produce a better finish on parts, and their temperature resistance allows faster machining. The material is usually called [[cemented carbide]], solid carbide, hardmetal or tungsten-carbide cobalt. It is a [[metal matrix composite]], where tungsten carbide particles are the aggregate, and metallic [[cobalt]] serves as the matrix.&lt;ref name=Rao&gt;{{cite book |author=Rao|title=Manufacturing Technology Vol.II 2E|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3sS5a4jqzS8C&amp;pg=PA30|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=978-0-07-008769-9|page=30|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Davis, Joseph R., ASM International Handbook Committee|title=Tool materials|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kws7x68r_aUC&amp;pg=PA289|year=1995|publisher=ASM International|isbn=978-0-87170-545-7|page=289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ammunition===
Tungsten carbide is often used in [[armour-piercing bullet|armor-piercing ammunition]], especially where [[depleted uranium]] is not available or is politically unacceptable. However, it is also common to use powder metallurgic [[tungsten==Armaments==|tungsten alloys]] (in which metallic tungsten powder has been cemented with a metallic binder). {{chem|W|2|C}} projectiles were first used by German [[Luftwaffe]] [[anti-tank warfare|tank-hunter]] squadrons in [[World War II]]. Owing to the limited German reserves of tungsten, {{chem|W|2|C}} material was reserved for making machine tools and small numbers of [[armour-piercing, core rigid|projectiles]].  It is an effective penetrator due to its combination of great hardness and very high density.&lt;ref name=Ford2000&gt;{{cite book |author=Ford, Roger |title=Germany's Secret Weapons in World War II|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lU8xBhe9ntsC&amp;pg=PA125|year=2000|publisher=Zenith Imprint|isbn=978-0-7603-0847-9|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zaloga2005&gt;{{cite book |author=Zaloga, Steven J. |title=US Tank and Tank Destroyer Battalions in the ETO 1944–45|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sCdlGIbmHjoC&amp;pg=PA37|year=2005|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-1-84176-798-7|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tungsten carbide in its monolithic sintered form, or much more often in tungsten carbide cobalt composite (in which fine ceramic tungsten carbide particles are embedded in metallic cobalt binder forming a metal matrix composite or MMC) can be of the [[sabot]] type. SLAP, or saboted light armour penetrator where a plastic sabot discards at the barrel muzzle is one of the primary types of saboted small arms ammunition. Non-discarding jackets, regardless of the jacket material, are not perceived as sabots but bullets. Both of the designs are, however, common in designated light armor-piercing small arms ammunition.

Discarding sabots like used with M1A1 Abrams main gun are more commonplace in precision high-velocity gun amunition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Green, Michael |author2=Stewart, Greg |lastauthoramp=yes |title=M1 Abrams at War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M1P6jT8_yrgC&amp;pg=PA66|year=2005|publisher=Zenith Imprint|isbn=978-0-7603-2153-9|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tucker2004&gt;{{cite book |author=Tucker, Spencer |title=Tanks: an illustrated history of their impact|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N481TmqiSiUC&amp;pg=PA348|year= 2004|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-995-9|page=348}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mining===
[[File:Drill bit 2-italy.JPG|thumb|A Tricone roller cone assembly from a raiseboring reamer, showing the protruding tungsten carbide buttons inset into the rollers]]
Tungsten carbide is used extensively in mining in top hammer rock drill bits, [[down-the-hole drill|downhole hammers]], [[roller cone bit|roller-cutters]], [[longwall mining|long wall plough]] chisels, [[longwall mining|long wall shearer]] picks, [[raise borer|raiseboring]] reamers, and [[tunnel boring machines]]. It is generally utilised as a button insert, mounted in a surrounding matrix of steel that forms the substance of the bit. As the tungsten carbide button is worn away the softer steel matrix containing it is also worn away, exposing yet more button insert.

===Nuclear===
Tungsten carbide is also an effective [[neutron reflector]] and as such was used during early investigations into nuclear chain reactions, particularly for weapons. A [[criticality accident]] occurred at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] on 21 August 1945 when [[Harry Daghlian]] accidentally dropped a tungsten carbide brick onto a [[plutonium]] sphere, known as the [[demon core]], causing the [[critical mass|subcritical mass]] to go supercritical with the reflected [[neutron]]s.

===Sports usage===
[[File:Nokian Gazza Extreme 294 29er.jpg|thumb|A [[Nokian Tyres|Nokian]] bicycle tire with tungsten carbide spikes. The spikes are surrounded by aluminum.]]
[[Trekking pole]]s, used by many [[hiking|hikers]] for balance and to reduce pressure on leg joints, generally use carbide tips in order to gain traction when placed on hard surfaces (like rock); carbide tips last much longer than other types of tip.&lt;ref name=Connally2004&gt;{{cite book |author=Connally, Craig |title=The mountaineering handbook: modern tools and techniques that will take you to the top|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c0MUESWJo2oC&amp;pg=PA14|year=2004|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|isbn=978-0-07-143010-4|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[ski pole]] tips are generally not made of carbide, since they do not need to be especially hard even to break through layers of ice, rollerski tips usually are. [[Roller skiing]] emulates [[cross country skiing]] and is used by many skiers to train during warm weather months.

Sharpened carbide tipped spikes (known as studs) can be inserted into the drive tracks of [[snowmobile]]s. These studs enhance traction on icy surfaces. Longer v-shaped segments fit into grooved rods called wear rods under each snowmobile ski. The relatively sharp carbide edges enhance steering on harder icy surfaces. The carbide tips and segments reduce wear encountered when the snowmobile must cross roads and other abrasive surfaces.&lt;ref name=Hermance2006&gt;{{cite book |author=Hermance, Richard |title=Snowmobile and ATV accident investigation and reconstruction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-msCn1jK8z8C&amp;pg=PA13|year= 2006|publisher=Lawyers &amp; Judges Publishing Company|isbn=978-0-913875-02-5|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Car, motorcycle and bicycle [[tire]]s with tungsten carbide studs provide better traction on ice. The tungsten carbide insert protruding from inside of a zinc or aluminium seating is commonly called a "soul" in the tire manufacturing business. These are generally preferred to steel studs because of their superior resistance to wear.&lt;ref name=HampGorr2011&gt;{{cite book |author1=Hamp, Ron |author2=Gorr, Eric |author3=Cameron, Kevin |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Four-Stroke Motocross and Off-Road Performance Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=24kHuJV2LcAC&amp;pg=PA69|year=2011|publisher=MotorBooks International|isbn=978-0-7603-4000-4|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tungsten carbide may be used in [[farrier]]y, the shoeing of [[horse]]s, to improve traction on slippery surfaces such as roads or ice. Carbide-tipped hoof nails may be used to attach the [[horseshoe|shoe]]s,&lt;ref name=mustad&gt;{{cite web |title=Road nail |url=http://www.mustadhoofnails.com/subcat/40/product/1369/page/0/road_nail/ |publisher=Mustad Hoof Nails |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326173505/http://www.mustadhoofnails.com/subcat/40/product/1369/page/0/road_nail/ |archivedate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; or alternatively [[Borium]], a trademark for tungsten carbide in a matrix of softer metal, may be welded to small areas of the underside of the shoe before fitting.&lt;ref name=wiw&gt;{{cite web |last= Breningstall|first= F.

===Surgical instruments===
Tungsten carbide is also used for making surgical instruments meant for open surgery (scissors, forceps, hemostats, blade-handles, etc.) and [[laparoscopic surgery]] (graspers, scissors/cutter, needle holder, cautery, etc.). They are much costlier than their stainless-steel counterparts and require delicate handling, but give better performance.&lt;ref name=ReichertYoung1997&gt;{{cite book |author1=Reichert, Marimargaret |author2=Young, Jack H. |title= Sterilization technology for the health care facility|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=HDzcboqJR9kC&amp;pg=PA30|year= 1997|publisher= Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|isbn= 978-0-8342-0838-4|page= 30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewelry===
[[File:Tungsten Carbide.jpg |thumb|Tungsten carbide ring]]
Tungsten carbide, typically in the form of a [[cemented carbide]] (carbide particles [[brazing|brazed]] together by metal), has become a popular material in the bridal jewelry industry due to its extreme hardness and high resistance to scratching.&lt;ref name=forever/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://trademarks.justia.com/774/86/seranite-77486248.html ''SERANITE – Trademark Details''] Justia Trademark, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Even with high-impact resistance, this extreme hardness also means that it can occasionally be shattered under certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://cherylkremkow.com/designer-jewelry/breaking-tungsten-carbide/|title= Breaking Tungsten Carbide|accessdate= 2009-10-29|publisher= Cheryl Kremkow}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some consider this useful, since an impact would shatter a tungsten ring, quickly removing it, where precious metals would bend flat and require cutting.  Tungsten carbide is roughly 10 times harder than 18k gold.

'''Uranyl formate''' (UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CHO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) is a fine yellow free-flowing powder occasionally used in [[transmission electron microscopy]].

It is occasionally used as a 0.5% or 1% [[Aqueous solution|aqueous]] [[negative stain]] in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) because it shows a finer grain structure than [[uranyl acetate]]. However, uranyl formate does not easily go into [[solution]], and once dissolved, has a rather limited lifetime as a [[Staining|stain]]. It is quite sensitive to light, especially ultraviolet light, and will [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitate]] if exposed.
