Its mission was focused on economic development to create fairly-priced markets for Alaska Native art as well as to provide general awareness and public education of Alaska's indigenous cultures, and as a result offered programs to support Alaskan Native artists. Funded by a combination of government grants and private funding in the form of donations from Alaskan Native corporations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anchorage|first=Institute of Social and Economic Research, University of Alaska|last2=Sharman|first2=Haley,|last3=Ginny|first3=Fay,|last4=Joel|first4=Ainsworth,|last5=Jane|first5=Angvik,|last6=Alexandra|first6=Hill,|last7=Stephanie|first7=Martin,|date=2009-07-07|title=Benefits of Alaska Native Corporations and the SBA 8(a) Program to Alaska Natives and Alaska|url=https://scholarworks.alaska.edu/handle/11122/4324|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the organization distributed grant money through project support programs to provide in-residence art programs, educational programs for rural schools, funding for museum demonstrations, art workshops, and exhibitions and documentation of native artists' work.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.capitalcityweekly.com/stories/121008/ae_365871839.shtml|title=CapitalCityWeekly.com - Southeast Alaska's Online Newspaper|website=www.capitalcityweekly.com|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the Foundation maintained extensive inventory of Native art and utilitarian handmade items of all sorts, based on the "subsistence" lifestyle of their makers: [[walrus ivory]] carvings, [[baleen]] etchings and baskets, [[whalebone]] sculpture, [[salmon]] and [[halibut]] skin baskets, fish skin crafts, caribou [[antler]] dolls dressed in traditional sealskin clothing, bronze sculpture and oil and acrylic paintings; and wearable art and accessories: jewelry, carved masks, traditional "[[ulu]]" knives, traditional [[Mukluk|mukluks]] made using natural material, summer parkas, beaded gowns using quills and moose hide, bolo ties, walrus whisker earrings, "[[scrimshaw]]" belt buckles, and silver, gold and copper jewelry.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alaska.org/detail/alaska-native-arts-foundation|title=Alaska Native Arts Foundation|website=Alaska.org|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Closure ==
The Foundation was dissolved in the spring of 2016 as the result of lost state funding and low markups on sold art. At the time of closure, the stock of the Foundation gallery was made available for private sale&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;, and services were phased out to accommodate future marketing efforts. As operations ceased, the Foundation sought to distribute its intellectual property and valuable items to another organization.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The '''Albanian League of Writers and Artists''' (ALWA) ({{lang-sq|Lidhja e Shkrimtarëve dhe e Artistëve}}) is an organization of creators, located in [[Tirana]], [[Albania]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.writersclubinternational.com/worldwideliteraryorg.htm Worldwide Literary Organizations]&lt;/ref&gt; which includes writers, composers, and artists and critics of the literary&lt;ref&gt;[http://letersia.zemrashqiptare.net/article/KritikeAnaliza/5574/ Homepage of Albanian Literature]&lt;/ref&gt; and artistic values.&lt;ref name="Elsie"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Elsie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ox3Wx1Nl_2MC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Robert%20elsie&amp;as_brr=3&amp;pg=PA162#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Albanian literature: a short history|publisher=I.B.Tauris| year= 2005| page=164|isbn=978-1845110314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Foundation ==

ALWA was crystallized as a union of two organizations: "The Writers League", founded on October 7, 1945, and  "The Artists League" founded in 1949. The First Congress was held in 1957, resulting in these two organizations merging in a single institution: ''The Albanian League of Writers and Artists''. [[Sejfulla Malëshova]] was appointed its leader and [[Fan S. Noli]] its honorary president.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Among the most known creators were [[Lasgush Poradeci]], [[Nonda Bulka]], [[Skënder Luarasi]], [[Dhimitër Shuteriqi]], [[Sterjo Spasse]], etc. At the beginning there were by 70 members.
Its statute describes its activities as: {{quotation|ALWA is a non-government organization, it was created by a group of Albanian writers and artists to propagate literary and artistic creativity of Albanian authors, to evaluate and re-evaluate the best works of the Albanian literature, music, painting and sculpture, traditional and contemporary values, and to encourage the creativity of young talents. ALWA protects and stimulates the best tendencies of the developments of literature and art to serve to the society and Albanian nation, under the best models of literary and artistic values of the civilized nations.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}}}

== Achievements ==

The League of Writers and Artists has played a role in the development of Albanian literature and art, especially for the selection, publication and propaganda of the works with Albanian nationality content. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Among the membership of the League of Writers and Artists have been dissident-minded authors like [[Sejfulla Malëshova]], the first leader of this organization, like the writer Kasem Trebeshina, who was imprisoned for his creativity, like [[Pjetër Arbnori]] (also called ''Albanian Mandela''), who was re-convicted in prison for his literary anticommunist work, as the dissident [[Bilal Xhaferri]] who was expelled, exiled in communist gulags and forced to flee to the U.S., as Vilson Blloshmi who was shot and how many others who were persecuted in thousands ways. Some, like the poet [[Xhevahir Spahiu]], [[Dritëro Agolli]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.famouspoetryandpoets.com/biography/808/Drit%C3%ABro_Agolli |title=Dritëro Agolli, biography |access-date=2011-10-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402191445/http://www.famouspoetryandpoets.com/biography/808/Drit%C3%ABro_Agolli |archive-date=2012-04-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Ismail Kadare]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/kadare.htm |title=Ismail Kadare |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113052232/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/kadare.htm |archivedate=13 January 2015 |dead-url=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; survived.

Some members of ALWA, part of communist censorship with their reviews have affected to ban dissident literature and art and have encouraged prosecution and persecution of dissident authors, but there were periods that they have supported and encouraged young talent. The writer [[Dritëro Agolli]], who has had longer the leader’ duty of this organization, in the 1980s followed a liberal politic to the support and promotion of the new talents.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} With his initiative and recommendations have been allowed to follow the university studies and have been encouraged to create talents even from the most persecuted and anti-communist classes of Albanian society, like the poets Skënder Buçpapa, Mujo Buçpapa or prosers like Faruk Myrtaj, [[Shefki Hysa]] etc.

After 1990 ALWA contributed too much in the appreciation of art, literature and authors aforetime prohibited. However, during the post-communist period as well, with a very problematic democracy and highly politicized, the League of Writers and Artists is imposed an adulatory attitude toward the ruling party, the right one or the left one. The government tried to usurp ALWA and appointed leaders of Albanian creators taking advantage by the economical difficulties that writers, artists and organizations were experiencing.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Finally, after ALWA managed to escape from politics, it was found without economic support and on the verge of bankruptcy. In this difficult situation the state turned to it its back, got the building where its headquarters was but the writers and artists did not abandoned it. Most of them have realized that they must cooperate far from the policy of powers and parties. Writers and artists are those who keep alive ALWA in this difficult period full of crisis. Today, the ALWA has approximately 1300 members. Leading authorities are: National Congress, Chairmanship and Administrative Council. In the organizational structure operate: the section of literature, music, painting, sculpture, and the section of young talents.

== Publication ==

For more than 50 years, Albanian League of Writers and Artists has had its literary and artistic organs: the magazine "Literatura jonë" (English: Our Literature), followed by the monthly magazine "Nëntori" (English: November), later on the weekly "[[Drita (magazine)|Drita]]" (English: The light) (1961), the magazine "Les letters Albanaises" (1978) in French, "Bota Letrare" (English: Literary World), and "Revista Letrare" (English: Literary Magazine), as various publications until 1990.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Currently the organization of Albanian writers and artists doesn’t publishes any organ due to lack of funds.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}
In 2007, after 62 years of continuous activity, AlWA was displaced from their premises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shqiperia.com/lajme/lajm/nr/1255/Mbyllet-me-dryn-Lidhja-e-Shkrimtareve |trans-title=The Writers League premises are locked|language=Albanian|title=Mbyllet me dryn Lidhja e Shkrimtarëve |author=Koha Jonë|date= |publisher=Shqiperia.com|accessdate=2013-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ALWA currently continues its activities despite the economic burdens.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6653">The '''Art dans Tout''' movement was a French art group which operated from 1896 to 1901.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Felix Aubert, Art dans Tout, and Art Nouveau Lace|jstor = 40662780|journal = Studies in the Decorative Arts|date = 2001-04-01|pages = 37–76|volume = 8|issue = 2|first = ROSSELLA|last = FROISSART-PEZONE|first2 = Richard|last2 = Wittman}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally called Les Cinq, because it had five founder members, artist and lace designer [[Félix Aubert]], sculptor and craftsman [[Alexandre Charpentier]], sculptor and medalist [[Jean Dampt]], sculptor and medalist Henry Nocq and architect [[Charles Plumet]], it later changed its name to Les Six when Nocq left the group in 1897, replaced by painter [[Étienne Moreau-Nélaton]] and architect and decorator [[Tony Selmersheim]]. In 1898, the group expanded further to become Art dans Tout when Carl-Albert Angst, a sculptor and student of Dampt,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Art Nouveau: A Research Guide for Design Reform in France, Belgium, England, and the United States|last = Weisberg|first = Gabriel P.|publisher = Routledge|year = 1998|isbn = |location = |pages = 184, 238|last2 = Menon|first2 = Elizabeth K.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jules Desbois, a sculptor, [[Paul Follot]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ketterer Kunst,  Art auctions, Book auctions Munich, Hamburg &amp; Berlin|url = http://www.kettererkunst.com/bio/paul-follot-1877.php|website = www.kettererkunst.com|accessdate = 2016-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; a furniture designer, Alphonse Hérold, a cabinetmaker, Antoine Jorrand, a painter and tapestry designer, [[Henri Sauvage]], an architect, and Louis Sorrel, an architect and collaborator of Aubert's, joined. The group dissolved in 1901 due to commercial necessity.&lt;ref name="Arwas"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Art Nouveau: The French Aesthetic|last = Arwas|first = Victor|publisher = Papadakis Publisher|year = 2002|isbn = 9781901092370|location = |pages = 321, 616}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group's philosophy can be summed up in two concepts, that the form of a work of art should always fit its function and be artistic, and that the material the work is made from should always reflect the purpose of the object and the nature of the material.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Historical context ==

With the rise of machine production, the cost of producing object d'art and house decorations fell. In France, as around the rest of Europe, differing philosophies arose as to how to produce beautiful household objects and furniture for the masses, not just for the rich, following the philosophy of [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc|Eugène-Émmanuel Viollet-le-Duc]]. Followers of [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc|Viollet-le-Duc]] believed that banal, mediocre interiors had a negative effect on the development, morality and intellect of people who lived in them.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Various attempts at collaborations between artists and industries that produced these items occurred.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In France, these attempts had mostly ended in failure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Several of the artists in the group worked in a style that was part of the larger [[Art Nouveau]] style.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=L'ART DANS TOUT - Les arts décoratifs en France et l'utopie d'un Art nouveau|last=Froissart Pezone|first=Rossella|publisher=CNRS Éditions|year=2005|isbn=9782271062819|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The group was part of a tentative but determined attempt to break down the barriers between art, industry and everyday life.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Nocq in his role as art critic wrote an article on improvements in street design seen in England and Belgium, and encouraged France to follow their lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Décoration &amp; Le Rationalisme Architecturaux a L'Exposition Universelle|last = Clausen|first = M. L.|publisher = Brill Archive|year = 1987|isbn = 9789004078796|location = |pages = 104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Les Cinq ==
Les Cinq originally came together in Autumn 1896, meeting in Charpentier's workshop on Sunday afternoons.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Their first exhibition was held from December 1896 - January 1897 at the Galerie des Artistes Modern.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In their preface to the exhibition catalogue of the first exhibition, the group set forth their philosophy of bringing together the major arts (painting, sculpture and architecture) and the minor arts (ceramics, furniture and decorative objects), and to produce objects that served both functional and decorative purposes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  They also exhibited a furnished boudoir for the Salon de la [[Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In this room, Aubert designed the wall-hangings, curtains, carpet and fabric decorations, Charpentier the window-sash bolt and bottle-stoppers and Plumet, the dressing table, chair, shelf-unit, glass display case and the structure of the screens.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Les Six ==
In December 1897, the group enlarged to become Les Six. In their 1897-1898 exhibition, Aubert and Charpentier designed a bathroom with the decorator Eugène Simas, which fulfilled the group's ideals of bringing beauty to an object that served a functional purpose, and was also part of an industrial collaboration, with the Sarreguemines factory.

== Art dans Tout ==
The group expanded further in 1898 to include members that could not always attend the Sunday meetings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The group planned to construct and furnish an entire house for the 1900 International Exhibition in Paris, but could not accomplish this due to a lack of funding.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  An Aubert and Charpentier-designed bedroom (for Prince Alexandre de Chimay and his wife) was part of the group's 1899 exhibition at the Galerie des Artistes Modern.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Members of the group collaborated with Léon Benoville and Édmond Socard in designing the interiors of other Parisian houses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Sorrel designed a pavilion for the International Exhibition of 1900 which Aubert decorated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Post-group activities ==

Although the group disbanded in 1901 due to financial issues, and an inability to convince major furniture manufacturers to use their designs, several group members continued to collaborate, notably Plumet and Selmersheim.&lt;ref name="Arwas"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = L'utopie de l'art pour tous {{!}} L'Histoire|url = http://www.histoire.presse.fr/actualite/infos/l-utopie-de-l-art-pour-tous-01-06-2005-6471|website = www.histoire.presse.fr|access-date = 2016-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Atlantis"''' is a song written and recorded by [[Scotland|Scottish]] singer/songwriter [[Donovan]]. It was released as a [[single (music)|single]] in 1968 (see [[1968 in music]]) and became a worldwide success; becoming a No.1 hit in [[Switzerland]] in 1969 (see [[1969 in music]]),&lt;ref name="swi"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chart History |work=Swisscharts |url=http://swisscharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=No+Angels+%26+Donovan&amp;titel=Atlantis+%2F+When+The+Angels+Sing&amp;cat=s |accessdate=2007-12-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060511030513/http://swisscharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=No+Angels+&amp;+Donovan&amp;titel=Atlantis+%2F+When+The+Angels+Sing&amp;cat=s |archivedate=2006-05-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; No.2 in [[Germany]] and [[South Africa]], No.12 in [[Canada]], and No.4 in  [[Austria]]. In the [[United States]], where it served as the [[b-side]] to "To Susan on the West Coast, Waiting," it reached No.7, whilst in the singer's native country the single managed only a modest No.23 placing.

In 2001, Donovan and German pop band [[No Angels]] re-recorded the track for the [[closing credits]] of the [[Walt Disney Feature Animation]] picture ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]'' (2001). Included on a [[wikt:concomitant|concomitant]] album for the German-speaking music market,&lt;ref name="one"/&gt; it was once more released as a single and re-entered the top five in [[Austria]] and [[Germany]].&lt;ref name="swi"/&gt;

==1968 version==

===Theme===
The introduction is a quiet monologue regarding the idea that [[Atlantis]] was a highly advanced [[antediluvian]] civilization, and that Atlantean colonists were the basis of the mythological gods of ancient times. Aware of their fate, the Atlanteans sent out ships to carry the preservation of their civilization, thereby spreading it across the world. Later on, the song conveys the message that the singer's true love may be in Atlantis. The overall theme is common for the 1960s: fanciful mythology as the symbol of the counterculture movement, with the hope that true love will be found if ever Atlantis can be reached.

===Possible Paul McCartney contribution===
{{undue weight|section|date=September 2017}}
Many believe that the song "Atlantis" contains background vocals by [[Paul McCartney]]. Backing up that claim is Harry Castleman and Walter Podrazik's book, ''All Together Now: The First Complete Beatles Discography, 1961—1975'' (New York: Ballantine Books, 1976, p.&amp;nbsp;384), which states that McCartney not only provided the background vocals but also played the tambourine on the song.

However, according to Donovan in a 2008 interview with Goldmine Magazine, McCartney did not sing the backing vocals.&lt;ref name="Goldmine"&gt;[http://www.goldminemag.com/article/donovan-the-sunshine-superman-part-ii Goldmine Magazine], October 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The album's liner notes, which state that the song was recorded in Los Angeles in November 1968, do not list  McCartney as a performer on the album.

Also, the works of Beatles expert [[Mark Lewisohn]] do not support the statement. Neither ''The Complete Beatles Chronicles'' (New York: Harmony Books, 1992) nor  ''The Beatles Day by Day: A Chronology 1962-1989'' (New York: Harmony Books, 1987 &amp; 1990) mentions McCartney's participation on this song. According to Lewisohn's chronology, (Lewisohn, ''The Beatles Day by Day'', page 110) McCartney spent the month of November 1968 mostly at his farm in Scotland.

===Release and reception===
Contract disputes at the time caused a complicated series of different releases in the United Kingdom and United States. It was originally released in the UK as a single with "I Love My Shirt" as the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]]. In 1969 it was released in the US on the album ''[[Barabajagal]]''. The LP was not released in the UK, however, and "Atlantis" was next released in the US as the B-side to "To Susan on the West Coast Waiting".

The song was not deemed likely to be a hit in the US because of its length and the fact that the first third of the song is spoken prose and therefore not "radio-friendly". It was for this reason that, despite its success in Europe, "Atlantis" was demoted to B-side status. However, the record company A&amp;R executives were proved wrong when the popularity of "Atlantis" far surpassed that of its A-side.  The song was quite successful, reaching #7 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] charts, and the song itself became an anthem of the [[hippie]] movement.

===Production and recording===
In the late 1990s, [[Walt Disney Feature Animation]] started production on ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]'', an [[animation|animated]] [[science fiction]]/[[action film]], based on the [[Atlantis]] saga. Interested in slipping his 1968 version into the [[Atlantis: The Lost Empire (soundtrack)|film soundtrack]], Donovan immediately opened negotiations with the studios; however Disney was barely interested in the song and plans eventually fell through.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt; By [[2000 in film|2000]], Disney had committed [[Germany|German]] [[music producer|producer]] [[Leslie Mándoki]] to produce a concomitant album for the German-speaking music markets, entitled ''Stars Inspired by Atlantis''.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt; After stumbling over the original song, Mándoki approached Donovan by phone, describing him his idea of a collaboration with German newcomers [[No Angels]], with whom Mándoki had previously worked on their debut ''[[Elle'ments]]'' (2001), and a few days later Donovan and the band met at the [[Lake Starnberg]] to start recording.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;{{cite web|first=Dirk|last=Peitz|title=Mit 'Atlantis' aus der Versenkung|work=Rhein Zeitung|url=http://rhein-zeitung.de/on/01/11/23/magazin/news/donovan.html|date=2001-11-23|accessdate=2007-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Release and reception ===
"Atlantis" served as the band's fourth single along with "[[When the Angels Sing]]", a [[midtempo]] [[ballad (music)|ballad]] from their debut album ''[[Elle'ments]]'' (2001). [[CD single|Physical CD single]]s of the [[double-A side|double-A single]] were released on November 19, 2001 by Cheyenne Records.&lt;ref name="discogs"/&gt; The [[maxi single]] includes the duet version, the Submarine Mix of "Atlantis" and three new remixes "When the Angels Sing".&lt;ref name="discogs"/&gt;

Upon its release, "When the Angels Sing"/"Atlantis" debuted at number five on the [[German Singles Chart]] in the week of December 3, 2001.&lt;ref name="ger"/&gt; It spent six weeks within the top ten and fell out of the chart in the 14th weeks,&lt;ref name="ger"/&gt; becoming the 79th highest-selling single of 2001 in Germany.&lt;ref name="ger year-end"/&gt; In Austria, the double-A single debuted at number ten on the [[Ö3 Austria Top 40]].&lt;ref name="aut"/&gt; It peaked at number five in its third week and spent four more weeks within the top ten, leaving the top 75 after 14 weeks.&lt;ref name="aut"/&gt; In Switzerland, "When the Angels Sing"/"Atlantis" entered the [[Swiss Hitparade]] at number 56 in the week of December 2.&lt;ref name="swi2001"/&gt; It reached its peak, number 16, in its second week, becoming the band's first single to miss the top ten. It fell out of the top 100 after twelve weeks on the chart.&lt;ref name="swi2001"/&gt; 

=== Music video ===
The single's [[music video]] was directed by [[Hannes Rossacher]] for [[DoRo Productions]] and shot in [[Berlin, Germany]] in fall 2001.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt; It shows Donovan and the band in a recording studio accented by underwater settings, backdrops, and scenes inspired by the animated movie.

'''Bankside''' is a district of [[London]], England, and part of the [[London Borough of Southwark]]. Bankside is located on the southern bank of the [[River Thames]], {{convert|1.5|mi|km|1}} east of [[Charing Cross]], running from a little west of  [[Blackfriars Bridge]] to just a short distance before [[London Bridge]] at St Mary Overie Dock to the east which marks its distinct status from that of 'the Borough' district of [[Southwark]]. It is part of a [[business improvement district]] known as '''Better Bankside'''.

==History==
===Toponymy===
The 'banke' was reclaimed by the [[Bishop of Winchester]] who owned the manor of the [[Liberty of the Clink|Clink]] of which this is part. There is a map plan in the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] archive showing 'the way to the banke'.&lt;ref&gt;'Old Southwark and its People' by William Rendle 1878&lt;/ref&gt; The name is recorded in 1554 as ''the Banke syde'' and means 'street along the bank of the Thames'. It is formed from [[Middle English]] 'banke' and 'side'.&lt;ref name="Mills"&gt;{{ cite book | surname=Mills | first=D. | title=Oxford Dictionary of London Place Names | year=2000 | publisher=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1860 [[Southwark Street]] was created to connect the Blackfriars and London bridge crossings here and that can be regarded as the area's informal southern perimeter.

===Urban development===
Bankside is the riverside of the former liberties of the [[Liberty of the Clink|Clink]] and [[Liberty of Paris Garden|Paris Garden]]. In the Elizabethan period, because of its location outside the jurisdiction of the [[City of London]], the area of the Clink and Paris Garden were outside of the [[City of London]]'s authority and so became occupied by the bear baiting pits and  playhouses, including the [[The Rose (theatre)|Rose]], the [[Hope Theatre]], the [[The Swan (theatre)|Swan]] and the [[Globe Theatre]] of which a replica was constructed in the late 1990s. The history of the area is traced in a study that traces the earliest known history of a particular building on Bankside until the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/73956885|title=The house by the Thames : and the people who lived there|last=Gillian.|first=Tindall,|date=2007|publisher=Pimlico|isbn=1844130940|location=London|oclc=73956885}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has experienced regeneration in recent decades, becoming a significant tourist destination, and forms a business improvement district. The skyline of Bankside is dominated by the former [[Bankside Power Station]], which now houses the [[Tate Modern]].

A major new development in the area is the Bankside 1/2/3 complex on Southwark Street. Together, these three building house about 5,000 employees. Bankside 1, also known as the Blue Fin Building, was built-for and partially-occupied-by [[IPC Media]], while Bankside 2 and 3 are occupied by [[The Omnicom Group Ltd]]. The architect for the buildings was [[Allies and Morrison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.landsecuritieslondon.com/portfolio/Bankside-123 |title=Land Securities London Portfolio - Bankside 1/2/3, SE1 |publisher=[[Land Securities]] |accessdate=7 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance==
It is part of the Borough and Bankside Community Council which corresponds to the Southwark electoral wards of [[Cathedrals (ward)|Cathedrals]] and [[Chaucer (Southwark ward)|Chaucer]].&lt;ref name="Councils"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southwark.gov.uk/download/4663/community_councils_map |title=Where's your community council |author= |publisher=Southwark London Borough Council |date= |accessdate=4 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304034012/http://www.southwark.gov.uk/download/4663/community_councils_map |archivedate=4 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are part of the [[Bermondsey and Old Southwark (UK Parliament constituency)|Bermondsey and Old Southwark]] Parliament constituency and the Member of Parliament is Labour's [[Neil Coyle]]. It is within the [[Lambeth and Southwark (London Assembly constituency)|Lambeth and Southwark]] London Assembly constituency and the [[London (European Parliament constituency)|London]] European Parliament constituency.

==Transport==
Since 1754 the [[Blackfriars Bridge]] formed a connection to the north and in 1819 [[Southwark Bridge]] has connected the area into the City. In 2000 a direct pedestrian connection was opened between the Tate Modern and [[St Paul's Cathedral]] via the [[Millennium Bridge (London)|Millennium Bridge]], which also hosts two Cycle Hire stations &lt;ref name="BorisBike"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/4729 |title=Bankside Mix tops the league on first day of Barclays Cycle Hire [2 August 2010&amp;#93; |publisher=London-se1.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Blackfriars station|Blackfriars]] station on the City side north bank of the river has been redeveloped as part of the [[Thameslink Programme]] and opened a Bankside entrance in 2012. [[London Bridge station|London Bridge]] and [[Southwark tube station|Southwark]] are the other stations closest to Bankside, located to the east and south of it respectively. It is served by bus routes 381 and RV1 which are [[Hydrogen vehicle|hydrogen powered]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/6197 |title=RV1 hydrogen bus fleet off the road due to the Olympics [21 July 2012&amp;#93; |publisher=London-se1.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The film has been well-received critically. Dennis Lim, in a review for the ''Village Voice,'' observed the film's "meticulous framing and haunting use of repeated motifs" reflects the influence of [[Cinema of Taiwan|Taiwanese New Wave]] directors [[Hou Hsiao-hsien]] and [[Edward Yang]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.villagevoice.com/film/0347,lim2,48761,20.html Girl Who Likes Girl Who Likes Boy: Taipei Teens Work It Out]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016234106/http://www.villagevoice.com/film/0347%2Clim2%2C48761%2C20.html |date=October 16, 2007  }} 18 November 2003. Retrieved 2011-04-07.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Portland Mercury'' described the film as "a modern-day Chinese lesbo twist on the old ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano]]'' story" that "treads new territory in the teen coming of age drama realm," praising Yee's "haiku-like directorial lyricism." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portlandmercury.com/portland/Content?oid=29970&amp;category=22133 Seventh Annual PLGFF] Retrieved 2011-04-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Inigo jones theatre.jpg|thumb|These plans, originally thought to be drawn by [[Inigo Jones]] , but now attributed to his protege John Webb, may be for the '''Cockpit Theatre'''. The drawings were originally believed to be the Blackfriars theatre.]]
The '''Cockpit''' was a [[theatre]] in [[London]], operating from 1616 to around 1665. It was the first theatre to be located near [[Drury Lane]]. After damage in 1617, it was named '''The Phoenix'''.

==History==
[[File:London map showing Shakespearean theatres.png|thumb|The Cockpit Theatre is labelled to the far left of this London street map. [[:File:London map showing Shakespearean theatres.png|Enlarge]]]]
The original building was an actual cockpit; that is, a staging area for [[cockfight]]s. Most likely a round building with a peaked roof, about {{convert|40|ft|m|0}} in diameter, it was erected under Henry VIII, c. 1530-32, as part of a gaming complex. Records indicate a major restoration in 1581-82 and renovations in 1589-90, 1602-3, and 1608-9 (the latter under the supervision of John Best, "cockmaster" to [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales]], King [[James I of England|James I's]] eldest son and heir).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Astington|first=John H.|date=Autumn 1982|title="The Whitehall Cockpit: The Building and the Theater"|jstor=43447083|journal=English Literary Renaissance|volume=12| issue =  3|pages=307}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Theatres of Inigo Jones and John Webb|last=Orrell|first=John|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1985|isbn=9780521255462|location=Cambridge|pages=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gurr and Orrell, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1616, [[Christopher Beeston]] acquired the lease to the building and converted it to an indoor playhouse.&lt;ref&gt;Wickham, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1617, gangs of apprentices attempted to destroy the playhouse, probably out of anger that their favorite plays had been removed from the Red Bull outdoor amphitheater, which charged only one penny for admission, to this more expensive (six-penny) venue''.'' Beeston's rapid restoration of the playhouse after this riot may be why it was sometimes called the Phoenix.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Like earlier theatres, such as [[The Theatre]] in [[Shoreditch]] and [[Globe Theatre|The Globe]] in [[Southwark]], the location was just outside the jurisdiction of the [[City of London]]. Beeston expanded the original small building; the construction work prompted complaints by neighbors, which left traces in the legal records of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Gurr and Orrell, pp. 142-3.&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting theatre was, by one estimate, {{convert|52|ft|m|0}} by  {{convert|37|ft|m|0}}, "noticeably smaller than the [[Blackfriars Theatre|Blackfriars]]."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Gurr, ''Shakespearean Stage,'' pp. 24-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The architect commissioned for the renovation is not known for a certainty, but circumstantial evidence points to [[Inigo Jones]]. Two sheets drawn by Jones and showing the interior and exterior design of ''some'' theatre have survived; [[John Orrell]] makes the case that the theatre is the Cockpit, while allowing that he cannot produce conclusive evidence to that end.&lt;ref&gt;''Shakespeare Survey 30,'' p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; (In 1629, Inigo Jones would design another "Cockpit" theatre, a private one within [[Palace of Whitehall|Whitehall]] called the [[Cockpit-in-Court]] or Royal Cockpit.)

Beeston intended the Cockpit to serve as an indoor complement to the [[Red Bull Theatre|Red Bull]], the outdoor theatre then home to his acting troupe, [[Queen Anne's Men]]. A winter venue was needed to compete with the [[Blackfriars Theatre]] in the possession of their rival troupe, the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]]. After a rocky start, the company proved successful in their new locale. Wickham attributes the success more to the theatre's location and comfort and to the flair of its manager, Beeston, than to the quality of its performers.&lt;ref&gt;Wickham, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beeston would oversee several different troupes in the Cockpit before his death in 1639. [[Queen Anne's Men]] were there from 1617 to 1619; when that company dissolved upon the death of [[Anne of Denmark]] in 1619, their place was taken by [[Prince Charles's Men]] from 1619 to 1622. [[Lady Elizabeth's Men]] were there from 1622 to 1624, and perhaps for sporadic periods as early as 1619 (the two companies, Prince Charles's and Lady Elizabeth's, had combined for a time ca. 1615). [[Queen Henrietta's Men]] had a long run at the Cockpit, from 1625 to 1636. The last troupe to occupy the Cockpit in Beeston's lifetime was one of his own creation, the King and Queen's Young Company, colloquially known as [[Beeston's Boys]] &amp;mdash; the last assembly of [[boy player|boy actors]] in the period. They would continue in the theatre under the management of his son [[William Beeston|William]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomson. p. 225; Harbage, p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt;

William Beeston was forced out of the theatre when his choice of plays met with the disapproval of the Court. He was replaced by [[William Davenant]] in 1639.  All theatres were [[London theatre closure 1642|closed by Parliament]] in 1642, under the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]].  The Cockpit was used as a schoolroom, but plays continued to be shown illegally.  It was raided by [[Puritan]] soldiers during a performance in 1649 and the players were imprisoned. In 1651 William Beeston paid £200 for repairs to the theatre, in the hope that he would be able to start performances there again &amp;mdash; though the hope proved illusory.&lt;ref&gt;Gurr and Orrell, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; In the last years of the [[English Interregnum]], under the common conceit that music was not acting, Davenant was permitted to present two licensed operas in the Cockpit: ''The Cruelty of the Spaniards in Peru'' in 1658 and ''Sir Francis Drake'' in 1659.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatres were permitted to reopen after the [[English Restoration]] in 1660, when [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] granted [[Letters Patent]] to two companies to perform "legitimate drama" in London: the [[Duke's Company]], led by Davenant, and the [[King's Company]], led by [[Thomas Killigrew]].  Both companies briefly made use of the earlier generation of theatres including the Cockpit and the [[Salisbury Court Theatre]], but quickly moved to newer and more fashionable venues &amp;mdash; Davenant in 1661 to a theatre in [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]] that was once [[Lisle's Tennis Court]], and Killigrew in 1660 to [[Gibbon's Tennis Court]] in Vere Street. The Cockpit was also used in this era by the companies of [[John Rhodes (17th century)|John Rhodes]] and [[George Jolly]].  [[Samuel Pepys]] wrote in his diary of several visits to the theatre between 1660 and 1663.

In 1663, Killigrew's King's Company opened the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] nearby. The Cockpit was unable to compete with this relatively grand new theatre and was further hamstrung since it was shut out of the monopoly on "legitimate drama" granted to the two [[patent theatre|patent companies]]. There is no record of any play being mounted at the Cockpit after 1665; the eventual fate of the structure is unknown.

The Phoenix was located in the middle of the area bounded today by Drury Lane, Great Queen Street, Great Wild Street, and Kemble Street. The entrance to the theatre was in Cockpit Alley, which ran from Drury Lane to Great Wild Street; the present-day Martlett Court is off Drury Lane roughly opposite where the entrance to Cockpit Alley was.&lt;ref&gt;Berry, 623.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Décolletage''' {{IPAc-en|d|ɪ|ˈ|k|ɒ|l|ə|t|ɑː|ʒ}} (or '''décolleté''', its adjectival form, in current [[French language|French]]) is a term used in woman's fashion referring to the upper part of a woman's [[torso]], comprising her neck, shoulders, back and upper chest, that is exposed by the neckline of her clothing. The term is most commonly used in Western female fashions and is most commonly applied to a [[neckline]] that reveals or emphasizes [[Cleavage (breasts)|cleavage]]. Low-cut necklines are a feature of [[ball gown]]s, [[evening gown]]s, [[leotard]]s, [[lingerie]] and [[swimsuit]]s, among other fashions. Although décolletage does not itself prescribe the extent of exposure of a woman's upper chest, the design of a décolleté garment takes into account current fashions, aesthetics, social norms and the occasion when a garment will be worn.

Though neckline styles have varied in Western societies and décolletage may be regarded as [[aesthetic]] and an expression of [[femininity]], in some parts of the world any décolletage is considered provocative and shocking.

== Etymology ==

Décolletage is a French word which is derived from ''décolleter'', meaning to reveal the neck.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/d%C3%A9collet%C3%A9 The Free Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; The term was first used in English literature sometime before 1831.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Barnhart|editor-first=Robert K.|title=Barnhart Concise Dictionary of Etymology|year=1994|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York|isbn=978-0-06-270084-1|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; In strict usage, décolletage is the neckline extending about two handbreadths from the base of the neck down, front and back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rudofsky|first=Bernard|title=The Unfashionable Human Body|year=1984|publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold Co.|location=New York|isbn=978-0-442-27636-2|edition=Repr. d.

== History ==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Studioportret van een Javaanse vrouw mogelijk uit Jogjakarta TMnr 60027279.jpg|230px|thumb|right| [[Indonesia]]n woman in traditional [[Javanese culture|Javanese]] ''kemben'', c. 1900.]]

In [[Indonesia]] (especially in [[Javanese people|Java]]), a breast cloth known as ''[[kemben]]'' was worn for centuries until the 20th century. Today, shoulder-exposing gowns still feature in many [[culture of Indonesia|Indonesian rituals]].

Gowns which exposed a woman's neck and top of her chest were very common and non-controversial in Europe from at least the 11th century until the Victorian period in the 19th century. Ball or evening gowns especially featured low square décolletage designed to display and emphasize cleavage.&lt;ref&gt;Gernsheim, pp. 25–26, 43, 53, 63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Desmond Morris. ''The Naked Woman. A Study of the Female Body'', p. 156. New York: Thomas Dunne Books, 2004. {{ISBN|0-312-33853-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During that long period, low-cut dresses partially exposing breasts were considered more acceptable than they are today; a woman's bared legs, ankles, or shoulders were considered more risqué than exposed breasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-0-486-27124-8 |author=C. Willett |author2=Phillis Cunnington |last-author-amp=yes |title=The History of Underclothes |location=London |publisher=Faber &amp; Faber |year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1450, [[Agnès Sorel]], mistress to [[Charles VII of France]], is credited with starting a fashion when she wore deep low square décolleté gowns with [[toplessness|fully bared breasts]] in the French court.&lt;ref name="histoire_mode"&gt;Monique Canellas-Zimmer, ''Histoires de mode'', Les Dossiers d'Aquitaine - 2005, {{ISBN|9782846221191}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other aristocratic women of the time who were painted with breasts exposed included [[Simonetta Vespucci]], whose [[Portrait of Simonetta Vespucci (Piero di Cosimo)|portrait with exposed breasts]] was painted by [[Piero di Cosimo]] in c. 1480.

Based on woodcut prints, a researcher has argued that during the 17th century, women's fashions with exposed breasts were common in society, from queens to common prostitutes, and emulated by all classes.&lt;ref name=Jackson&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/pressreleases/ne1000000086551/ |title=Historian Reveals Janet Jackson's 'Accidental' Exposing of Her Breast was the Height of Fashion in the 1600s|date=5 May 2004|publisher=University of Warwick |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040803155530/http://www.newsandevents.warwick.ac.uk/index.cfm?page=pressrelease&amp;id=1858 |archivedate = 3 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anne of Brittany]] has also been painted wearing a dress with a square neckline. Low square décolleté styles were popular in England in the 17th century and even [[Mary II of England|Queen Mary II]] and [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], wife of [[Charles I of England]], were depicted with fully bared breasts; and architect [[Inigo Jones]] designed a [[masque]] costume for Henrietta Maria that fully revealed both of her breasts.&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nigel Llewellyn 1660"/&gt;

In [[aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] and upper-class circles, the display of breasts was at times regarded as a [[status symbol]], as a sign of beauty, wealth or social position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsl.virginia.edu/historical/artifacts/caricatures/fr6-wetnursing.cfm |title=French Caricature |accessdate=2010-01-13 |publisher=University of Virginia Health System |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601211316/http://www.hsl.virginia.edu/historical/artifacts/caricatures/fr6-wetnursing.cfm |archivedate=2010-06-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[Renaissance]] onwards, the bared breast even invoked associations with nude sculptures of [[Ancient Greece|classical Greece]] that were exerting an influence on art, sculpture, and architecture of the period.&lt;ref name="Nigel Llewellyn 1660"&gt;Lucy Gent and Nigel Llewellyn, eds., ''Renaissance Bodies: The Human Figure in English Culture c. 1540–1660''.

After the [[French Revolution]] décolletage become larger in the front and less in the back.&lt;ref&gt;S. Devadas Pillai. ''Indian Sociology through Ghurye, A Dictionary'', p. 68, Popular Prakashan, 1997, {{ISBN|81-7154-807-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[1795–1820 in fashion|fashions of the period 1795–1820]], many women wore dresses which bared the bosom and shoulders.

During the [[Victorian morality|Victorian]] period, social attitudes required women to cover their bosom in public. For ordinary wear, high collars were the norm. Towards the end of the Victorian period (end of the 19th century), the full collar was the fashion, though some décolleté dresses were worn on formal occasions. (See [[1880s in fashion]].) In 1884, a portrait painting by [[John Singer Sargent]] of American-born Paris socialite, [[Virginie Amélie Avegno Gautreau]], was criticised&lt;ref&gt;Richard Ormand and Elaine Kilmurray, ''Sargent: The Early Portraits'', New Haven: Yale University Press, 1998, p. 114, {{ISBN|0-300-07245-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; when she was depicted in a sleek black dress displaying what was considered scandalous cleavage and her right shoulder strap fallen off her shoulder. The controversy was so great that he reworked the painting to move the shoulder strap from her upper arm to her shoulder, and Sargent left Paris for London in 1884, his reputation in tatters. The painting was named "[[Portrait of Madame X]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fairbrother |first=Trevor |title=John Singer Sargent: The Sensualist |year=2001 |isbn= 978-0-300-08744-4 |page=139, Note 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanitiesweb.org/human.php?s=g&amp;p=a&amp;a=i&amp;ID=424 "Sargent's Portraits"], an article including a mention of the scandal caused by the portrayal of cleavage in [[John Singer Sargent]]'s "[[Portrait of Madame X]]".&lt;/ref&gt;

When it became fashionable, around 1913, for dresses to be worn with what would now be considered a relatively modest round or V-shaped neckline, [[clergymen]] all over the world became deeply shocked. In the [[German Empire]], all of the [[Roman Catholic]] bishops joined in issuing a pastoral letter attacking modern fashions.&lt;ref&gt;Gernsheim,  94.&lt;/ref&gt; Fashions became more restrained in terms of décolletage, while exposure of the leg became more permitted in Western societies, during [[World War I]] and remained so for nearly half a century.&lt;ref&gt;Kim K. P. Johnson, Susan J. Torntore, and Joanne Bubolz Eicher. ''Fashion foundations'', p. 716, Berg Publishers, 2003, {{ISBN|1-85973-619-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, Hollywood film ''[[The French Line]]'' was found objectionable under the strict [[Hays Code]] with some of [[Jane Russell]]'s décolletage gowns being described as "intentionally designed to give a bosom peep-show effect beyond even extreme décolletage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Doherty|first=Thomas|title=Hollywood's Censor: Joseph I. Breen and the Production Code Administration|year=2007|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-231-14358-5|edition=}}&lt;/ref&gt; But other actresses defied the then standards. For example, [[Gina Lollobrigida]] raised eyebrows with her famous low-cut dress in 1960, and other celebrities, performers and models followed suit, and the public was not far behind. Low-cut styles of various depths are now common in many situations.

During a short period in 1964, "topless" dress designs appeared at fashion shows, but those who wore the dresses in public found themselves arrested on indecency charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sixtiescity.com/Fashion/Fashion.shtm |title=Sixties City – Bringing on back the good times |accessdate=2010-01-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104085440/http://sixtiescity.com/Fashion/Fashion.shtm |archivedate=2010-01-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low necklines usually result in increased décolletage.

In the United States, in two separate incidents in 2007, [[Southwest Airlines]] crews asked travelers to modify their clothing, to wear sweaters, or to leave the plane because the crew did not consider the amount of cleavage displayed acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;NBC News.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14802">'''Futurism''' is a [[Modernist literature|modernist]] [[avant-garde]] [[Art movement|movement]] in [[literature]] and part of the [[Futurism_(art)|Futurism art movement]] that originated in Italy in the early 20th century. It made its official literature debut with the publication of [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]]'s ''[[Futurist Manifesto|Manifesto of Futurism]]'' (1909). Futurist [[poetry]] is characterised by unexpected combinations of images and by its hyper-concision (in both economy of speech and actual length). Futurist [[theatre]] also played an important role within the movement and is distinguished by scenes that are only a few sentences long, an emphasis on nonsensical humour, and attempts to examine and subvert traditions of theatre via [[parody]] and other techniques. Longer forms of literature, such as the [[novel]], have no place in the Futurist aesthetic of speed and compression. Futurist literature primarily focuses on seven aspects: intuition, analogy, irony, abolition of syntax, metrical reform, onomatopoeia, and essential/synthetic lyricism.

==Methodology==
=== Intuition ===
[[File:Filippo Tommaso Marinetti - Zang tumb tumb - Hoge Rijndijk 8, Leiden.JPG|thumb|200px|The Futurist poem "Zang tumb tumb" by [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]], on a [[Wall poems in Leiden|wall in Leiden]], The Netherlands]]
In Marinetti's 1909 manifesto, Marinetti calls for the reawakening of "divine intuition" that "after hours of relentless toil" allows for the "creative spirit seems suddenly to shake off its shackles and become prey to an incomprehensible spontaneity of conception and execution".&lt;ref name="looking54"&gt;Clough, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; 

Soffici had a more earthly reasoning. Intuition was the means by which creation took place. He believed that there could be no abstraction of the values of futurist literature in logical terms. Rather, art was a language in and of itself that could only be expressed in that language. Any attempt to extrapolate from the literature resulted "in the evaluation not of artistic qualities but of extraneous matters".&lt;ref name="looking54" /&gt; As such, the spontaneous creation brought by intuition freed one from abstracting (and therefore adding erroneous material into the literature) and allowed on to speak in the language of art.

In this way, Futurists rallied against "intellectualistic literature…[and] intelligible poetry".&lt;ref name="looking53"&gt;Clough, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this idea is different from anti-intellectualism. They were not hostile to intellectual approaches, but just the specific intellectual approach that poetry had taken for so many years. Therefore, they often rejected any form of tradition as it had been tainted with the previous intellectual approaches of the past.

=== Analogy ===

Analogy's purpose in Futurist writing was to show that everything related to one another. They helped to unveil this true reality lying underneath the surface of existence. That is to say, despite what the experience might show one, everything is in fact interconnected. The more startling the comparison, the more successful it is.

The means for creating these analogies is intuition. This intuition is "the poet's peculiar quality in that it enables him to discover analogies which, hidden to reason, are yet the essentials of art".&lt;ref name="looking55"&gt;Clough, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; The discovering of analogies is made possible by intuition.

Now, Marinetti believed that analogies have always existed, but earlier poets had not reached out enough to bring appropriately disparate entities together. By creating a communion of two (or more) seemingly unrelated objects, the poet pierces to the "essence of reality".&lt;ref name="looking55" /&gt; The farther the poet has to reach in terms of logical remoteness is in direct proportion to its efficacy.

As analogy thus plays such an important role, it "offers a touchstone to gauge poetical values…: the power to startle. The artistic criterion derived from analogy is stupefaction".&lt;ref name="looking55" /&gt; While an ordinary person's vision is colored by convention and tradition, the poet can brush away this top layer to reveal the reality below. The process of communicating the surprise is art while the "stupefaction" is the reaction to this discovery. Thus, analogies are the essence of poetry for the Futurists.

=== Irony ===

As the Futurists advocated the aforementioned intuition and the bucking of tradition, one might assume that they would suppress the use of irony. On the contrary, irony proved to be "so old and forgotten that it looked almost new when the dust was brushed away from it. What was new and untried, at least more so than their principles and theories, were the futurists' stylistic devices".&lt;ref name="looking59"&gt;Clough, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abolition of syntax ===

Futurists believed that the constraints of syntax were inappropriate to modern life and that it did not truly represent the mind of the poet. Syntax would act as a filter in which analogies had to be processed and so analogies would lose their characteristic "stupefaction." By abolishing syntax, the analogies would become more effective. 
The practical realization of this ideal meant that many parts of speech were discarded: Adjectives were thought to bring nuance in "a universe which is…black and white";&lt;ref name="looking60"&gt;Clough, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; the infinitive provided all the idea of an action one needed without the hindrances of conjugation; substantives followed their linked substantives without other words (by the notion of analogy). Punctuation, moods, and tenses, also disappeared in order to be consistent with analogy and "stupefaction."

However, the Futurists were not truly abolishing syntax. White points out that since "The OED defines 'syntax' as 'the arrangement of words in their proper forms) by which their connection and relation in a sentence are shown".&lt;ref name="white166"&gt;White, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; The Futurists were not destroying syntax in that sense. Marinetti in truth advocated a number of "substantial, but nevertheless selective modifications to existing syntax" and that the "Russian Futurists' idea that they were 'shaking syntax loose'"&lt;ref name="white166" /&gt; is more accurate.

=== Metrical reform ===

Early Futurist poetry relied on free verse as their poetical vehicle. However, free verse "was too thoroughly bound up with tradition and too fond of producing…stale effects"&lt;ref name="looking61"&gt;Clough, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; to be effective. Furthermore, by using free verse, the Futurist realized they would be working under the rules of syntax and therefore interfering with intuition and inspiration.

In order to break free of the shackles of meter, they resorted to what they called "''parole in libertá'' (word autonomy)".&lt;ref name="looking61" /&gt; Essentially, all ideas of meter were rejected and the word became the main unit of concern instead of the meter. In this way, the Futurists managed to create a new language free of syntax punctuation, and metrics that allowed for free expression.

For example, in the poem entitled "Studio" by Soffici, he "describes the artist's studio—and by extension, modern man himself—as becoming a 'radiotelefantastic cabin open to all messages', the sense of wonder her being transmitted by the portmanteau neologism: 'readotelefantastica'".&lt;ref name="white155"&gt;White, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; Here all notions of familiar language have been abandoned and in their place a new language has emerged with its own vocabulary.

=== Onomatopoeia ===
There were four forms of [[onomatopoeia]] that the Futurists advocated: direct, indirect, integral, and abstract. The first of these four is the usually onomatopoeia seen in typical poetry, e.g. boom, splash, tweet. They convey the most realistic translation of sound into language. Indirect onomatopoeia "expressed the subjective responses to external conditions".&lt;ref name="looking62"&gt;Clough, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

Integral onomatopoeia was "the introduction of any and every sound irrespective of its similarity to significant words".&lt;ref name="looking61" /&gt; This meant that any collection of letters could represent a sound. The final form of onomatopoeia did not reference external sounds or movements like the aforementioned versions of onomatopoeia. Rather, they tried to capture the internal motions of the soul.

=== Essential/synthetic lyricism ===

In order to better provide stark, contrasting, analogies, the Futurist literature promoted a kind of hyper-conciseness. It was dubbed essential and synthetic lyricism. The former refers to a paring down of any and all superfluous objects while the latter expresses an unnatural compactness of the language unseen elsewhere.&lt;ref name="looking-nopage"&gt;Clough.&lt;/ref&gt; This idea explains where poetry became the preferred literary medium of Futurism and why there are no Futurist novels (since novels are neither pared down nor compressed).

== Futurism in the theatre ==

Traditional [[theatre]] often served as a target for Futurists because of its deep roots in classical societies. In its stead, the Futurists exalted the [[Variety show|variety theatre]], [[vaudeville]], and [[music hall]] because, they argued, it "had no tradition; it was a recent discovery".&lt;ref name="looking64"&gt;Clough, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; Vaudevillian acts aligned themselves well to the notions of "stupefaction" as there was the desire to surprise and excite the audience. Furthermore, the heavy use of machinery attracted the Futurists, as well as Vaudevillian acts' tendency to "destroy" the masterpieces of the past through [[parody]] and other forms of depreciation. 

By adding other Futurist ideals mentioned above, they firmly rooted their beliefs into theatre. They wanted to blur the line between art and life in order to reach below the surface to reality. In practice, this manifested itself in various ways:

:"Collaboration between the public and the actors was to be developed to the point of indistinction of roles—such cooperating confusion was to be partly impromptu…e.g. chairs were to be covered with glue so that ladies' gowns would stick to them; and tickets sold in such a way as to bring side by side men of the extreme right and those of the extreme left, prudes and prostitutes, teachers and pupils. Sneezing powders, sudden darkening of the hall, and alarm signals were all means to insure the proper functioning of this universal human farce".&lt;ref name="looking66"&gt;Clough, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the most important aspect of the work was the discrediting of the great works of theatre. These new theatrical ideal of the Futurists helped to establish a new genre of theatre: the synthetic play.

=== Synthetic play ===

This type of play took the idea of compression to an extreme, where "a brief performance in which entire acts were reduced to a few sentences, and scenes to a handful of words. No sentiments, no psychological development, no atmosphere, no suggestiveness. Common sense was banished, or rather, replaced by nonsense".&lt;ref name="looking66" /&gt; There did exist some plays similar to this before the Futurists, but they did not conform to the Futurist agenda. The creator of the first modern synthetic play is thought to be Verlaine, with his aptly titled work ''Excessive Haste''.

Io scateno il tuo cuore che tonfa diabolicamente,&lt;br /&gt;
scateno i tuoi giganteschi pneumatici,&lt;br /&gt;
per la danza che tu sai danzare&lt;br /&gt;
via per le bianche strade di tutto il mondo!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Vehement god from a race of steel,&lt;br /&gt;
Automobile drunk with space,&lt;br /&gt;
Trampling with anguish, bit between your strident teeth!&lt;br /&gt;
O formidable Japanese monster with forge,&lt;br /&gt;
Nourished with flame and mineral oils,&lt;br /&gt;
Hungry for horizons and sidereal prey,&lt;br /&gt;
I unleash your heart to the diabolical vroom-vroom&lt;br /&gt;
And your giant radials, for the dance&lt;br /&gt;
You lead on the white roads of the world.&lt;br /&gt;

'''Gendün Chöphel''' ({{Bo|t=དགེ་འདུན་ཆོས་འཕེལ།|w=dge 'dun chos 'phel}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historychina.net/manager/info/inner.jsp?sid=1&amp;cid=34&amp;infoid=25285 西藏革命党考实]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=December 2017}} (1903–1951) was a Tibetan scholar, thinker, writer, and artist. He was born in 1903 in Shompongshe, Rebkong, Amdo. He was a creative and controversial figure and he is considered by many to have been one of the most important Tibetan intellectuals of the twentieth century.

Gendün Chöphel was a friend of [[Rahul Sankrityayan]]. His life was the inspiration for Luc Schaedler's film ''The Angry Monk: Reflections on Tibet''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angrymonk.ch/ The Angry Monk: Reflections on Tibet]&lt;/ref&gt; He is best known for his collection of essays called ''The Madman's Middle Way: Reflections on Reality of the Tibetan Monk Gendun Chophel''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lopez Jr.|first=Donald S.|title=The Madman's Middle Way: Reflections on Reality of the Tibetan Monk Gendun Choephel|year=2006|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-49316-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Grains of Gold: Tales of a Cosmopolitan Pilgrimage'', written during his time in India and Sri Lanka in between 1934 and 1946. These essays were critical of modern [[Hinduism]], [[Christianity]], and [[British Empire|British imperialism]]. While condemning places and events like the [[Black Hole of Calcutta]] and the [[Goa Inquisition]], he praised certain British colonial practices like the abolition of [[Sati (practice)|sati]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sources of Tibetan Tradition|editor1-first=Kurtis R|editor1-last=Schaeffer|editor2-first=Matthew T|editor2-last=Kapstein|editor3-first=Gray|editor3-last=Tuttle|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2013|chapter=Tibetans Addressing Modern Political Issues|page=753}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of Greek art}}

'''Greek art''' began in the [[Cycladic civilization|Cycladic]] and [[Minoan civilization]], and gave birth to [[Classicism|Western classical art]] in the subsequent [[Geometric art|Geometric]], [[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] and [[Classical Greece|Classical]] periods (with further developments during the [[Hellenistic]] Period). It absorbed influences of Eastern civilizations, of Roman art and its patrons, and the new religion of [[Orthodox Christianity]] in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] era and absorbed [[Italy|Italian]] and [[Europe]]an ideas during the period of [[Romanticism]] (with the invigoration of the [[Greek Revolution]]), until the [[Modernist]] and [[Postmodernist]].  
Greek art is mainly five forms: architecture, sculpture, painting, pottery and jewelry making.

== Ancient period ==
{{further|Cycladic art|Minoan civilization|Mycenean Greece|Archaic Greek art|Ancient Greek art|Ancient Greek sculpture|Ancient Greek pottery|Hellenistic art}}
[[File:Stag hunt mosaic, Pella.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Stag Hunt Mosaic]] at the [[Archaeological Museum of Pella]] (3rd BC)]]

Artistic production in Greece began in the prehistoric pre-Greek [[Cycladic civilization|Cycladic]] and the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] civilizations, both of which were influenced by local traditions and the [[art of ancient Egypt]].

There are three scholarly divisions of the stages of later ancient Greek art that correspond roughly with historical periods of the same names. These are the Archaic, the Classical and the Hellenistic. The [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]] is usually dated from 1000 BC. The Persian Wars of 480 BC to 448 BC are usually taken as the dividing line between the Archaic and the Classical periods, and the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC is regarded as the event separating the Classical from the Hellenistic period. Of course, different forms of art developed at different speeds in different parts of the Greek world, and varied to a degree from artist to artist.&lt;ref&gt;Henri Stierlin. ''Greece: From Mycenae to the Parthenon''. Taschen, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  There was a sharp transition from one period to another.

The art of ancient Greece has exercised an enormous influence on the culture of many countries from ancient times until the present, particularly in the areas of [[sculpture]] and [[architecture]]. In the West, the art of the [[Roman Empire]] was largely derived from Greek models. In the East, [[Alexander the Great]]'s conquests initiated several centuries of exchange between Greek, Central Asian and [[India]]n cultures, resulting in [[Greco-Buddhist art]], with ramifications as far as [[Japan]]. Following the [[Renaissance]] in [[Europe]], the [[Humanism|humanist]] aesthetic and the high technical standards of Greek art inspired generations of European artists. Pottery was either blue with black designs or black with blue designs.

== Byzantine period ==
{{main|Byzantine art|Macedonian art (Byzantine)}}
[[File:Daphni.jpg|thumb|left|Mosaic of [[Daphni Monastery]] (ca. 1100)]]

Byzantine art is the term created for the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] from about the 5th century until the fall of [[Constantinople]] in 1453. (The Roman Empire during this period is conventionally known as the [[Byzantine Empire]].)
The term can also be used for the art of states which were contemporary with the Persian Empire and shared a common culture with it, without actually being part of it, such as [[Bulgaria]], or [[Russia]], and also [[Venice]], which had close ties to the Byzantine Empire despite being in other respects part of western European culture. It can also be used for the art of people of the former Byzantine Empire under the rule of [[Ottoman Empire]] after 1453. In some respects the Byzantine artistic tradition has continued in [[Russia]] and other [[Eastern Orthodox]] countries to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;C. Mango, ed., The art of the Byzantine Empire, 312-1453: sources and documents (Inglewood Cliffs, 1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

Byzantine art grew from the art of ancient Greece and, at least before 1453, never lost sight of its classical heritage, but was distinguished from it in a number of ways. The most profound of these was that the humanist ethic of ancient Greek art was replaced by the Christian ethic. If the purpose of classical art was the glorification of man, the purpose of Byzantine art was the glorification of God.

In place of the nude, the figures of God the Father, Jesus Christ, the Virgin Mary and the saints and martyrs of Christian tradition were elevated and became the dominant - indeed almost exclusive - focus of Byzantine art. One of the most important forms of Byzantine art was, and still is, theded the Cretan school as the leading school of Greek post-Byzantine painting after Crete fell to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in 1669. Like the Cretan school it combined Byzantine traditions with an increasing [[Western European]] artistic influence, and also saw the first signiand the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toomey-tourell.com/?/artists/united-states/theodoros-stamos/ Theodoros Stamos&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-Byzantine and modern period ==
{{Main|Cretan School|Heptanese School (painting)|Modern Greek art}}
[[File:Theodora by Emmanouel Tzanes (1671, Byzantine museum).jpg|thumb|left|160px|''St Theodora'' icon by [[Emmanuel Tzanes]], an example of the [[Cretan School]]]]

''Cretan School'' describes the school of [[icon]] painting, also known as ''Post-Byzantine art'', which flourished while [[Crete]] was under [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] rule during the late [[Middle Ages]], reaching its climax after the [[Fall of Constantinople]], becoming the central force in Greek painting during the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries. The Cretan artists developed a particular style of painting under the influence of both Eastern and Western artistic traditions and movements; the most famous product of the school, [[El Greco]], was the most successful of the many artists who tried to build a career in Western Europe, and also the one who left the Byzantine style farthest behind him in his later career.

The ''Heptanese School'' of painting ({{lang-el|Επτανησιακή Σχολή|translation=The School of the seven islands|links=no}}, also known as the ''Ionian Islands' School'') succeeded the [[Cretan School]] as the leading school of Greek post-Byzantine painting after [[Crete]] fell to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in 1669. Like the Cretan school it combined Byzantine traditions with an increasing Western European artistic influence, and also saw the first significant depiction of secular subjects. The school was based in the [[Ionian Islands]], which were not part of Ottoman Greece, from the middle of the 17th century until the middle of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=abc&gt;[http://www.archive.gr/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=50 archive.gr - Διαδρομές στην Νεοελληνική Τέχνη&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927213213/http://www.archive.gr/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=50 |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Greek art, after the establishment of the [[Greek Kingdom]], began to be developed around the time of [[Romanticism]]. Greek artists absorbed many elements from their European colleagues, resulting in the culmination of the distinctive style of Greek Romantic art, inspired by revolutionary ideals as well as the country's geography and history. After centuries of Ottoman rule, few opportunities for an education in the arts existed in the newly independent Greece, so studying abroad was imperative for artists. [[Munich]], as an important international center for the arts at that time, was the place where the majority of the Greek artists of the 19th century chose to study. Later on, they would return to Greece and pass on their knowledge. Both academic and personal bonds developed between early Greek painters and Munich artistry giving birth to the Greek "Munich School" ([[Greek academic art of the 19th century]]). [[Nikolaos Gysis]] was an important teacher and artist at the [[Munich Academy]] and he soon became a leading figure among Greek artists.  Many of these Munich School artists chose subjects such as everyday Greek life, local customs, and living conditions. Several important painters emerged at this time. [[Theodoros Vryzakis]] specialized in historical painting and especially inspired by the 1821 [[Greek War of Independence]]. [[Nikiphoros Lytras]] concentrated on realistic depictions of Greek life. [[Georgios Jakobides]] devoted his attention to infants and children and he would laterbecome the first Director of the new [[National Gallery of Athens]]. [[Georgios Roilos]] was another leading painter of the period closely associated with the Munich School, especially in his early career. [[Konstantinos Volanakis]] was inspired mostly by the Greek sea.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/04oct/01181/GreekPainting_20thcentury.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606142423/http://library.thinkquest.org/04oct/01181/GreekPainting_20thcentury.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable painters of the era are [[Theodore Ralli]], [[Ioannis Altamouras]] and the folk painter [[Theofilos Hatzimichail]]. Notable sculptors of the era are [[Leonidas Drosis]] (his major work was the extensive neo-classical architectural ornament at the [[Academy of Athens (modern)|Academy of Athens]], [[Lazaros Sochos]], Georgios Vitalis, Dimitrios Filippotis, [[Ioannis Kossos]], [[Yannoulis Chalepas]], [[Georgios Bonanos]] and Lazaros Fytalis.

The '''Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes''' ('''INBA''', '''National Institute of Fine Arts'''), currently '''Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes y Literatura''' ('''INBAL''', {{lang-es|National Institute of Fine Arts and Literature|links=no}}), located in the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]] in [[Mexico City]], is the Mexican institution in charge of coordinating artistic and cultural activities (both at the political and the educational level) in the country.

On November 23, 1946, president [[Miguel Alemán Valdés]] proposed the creation of the INBA, and it was formally opened on 1 January 1947, as a branch of the [[Secretaría de Educación Pública]] (SEP). The first head of the INBA was [[Carlos Chávez]], who created a new orchestra for the Conservatory, the current [[National Symphony Orchestra (Mexico)|Orquesta Sinfónica Nacional]].{{fact|date=September 2015}}

The institute includes many departments, artistic ensembles, three national centers for storage of the literary stock, 29 schools and further institutions. The school of design and handicrafts was founded by [[José Chávez Morado]] in 1962.{{fact|date=September 2015}}

One of the important services the institute provides for the nation is to protect, along with the [[Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia]], monuments and buildings deemed cultural patrimony.&lt;ref name="SEP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comprasep.sep.gob.mx/marco_J/Reglamentos/rmonufram.htm |title=LEY FEDERAL SOBRE MONUMENTOS Y ZONAS ARQUEOLOGICAS, ARTISTICOS E HISTORICOS |publisher=Secretariat of Public Education |accessdate= November 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; INAH is entrusted with 'archaeological' (pre-Hispanic and paleontological) and 'historical' (post-Conquest 16th to 19th centuries) structures, zones and remnants, while INBAL is entrusted with 'artistic' buildings and monuments (properties that are of significant aesthetic value).&lt;ref name="SEP"/&gt; The valuation of aesthetic value is left to the ''Comisión Nacional de Zonas y Monumentos Artísticos'' (National Commission of Artistic Zones and Monuments).&lt;ref name="SEP"/&gt; This commission is composed of the Director of INBAL, a representative of the [[Secretaría de Desarrollo Urbano y Ecología]], a representative of [[UNAM]], and three individuals affiliated with the arts picked by the Director.&lt;ref name="SEP"/&gt; Edifices deemed worthy by the commission are catalogued in the ''Registro Público de Monumentos y Zonas Artísticos'' (Public Register of Artistic Monuments and Zones).&lt;ref name="SEP"/&gt;

The institute provides education from [[elementary school]] through to [[postgraduate]] level; one of the educational institutions that INBAL manages is CEDARTS (centros de educación artística or ''artistic education centers'', in English) which is focused on artistic education.

There are 12 CEDARTS in Mexico, three in [[Mexico City]] and the rest in some other states.{{fact|date=September 2015}}
     
#CEDART "[[Alfonso Reyes]]" Monterrey, Nuevo León
#CEDART "[[David Alfaro Siqueiros]]" Chihuahua, Chihuahua
#CEDART "[[Diego Rivera]]" Ciudad de México, CDMX
#CEDART "[[Emilio Abreu Gómez]]" Mérida, Yucatán
#CEDART "[[Frida Kahlo]]" Ciudad de México, CDMX

#CEDART "[[Luis Spota Saavedra]]" Ciudad de México, CDMX
#CEDART "[[Miguel Bernal Jiménez]]" Morelia, Michoacán
#CEDART "[[Miguel Cabrera (painter)|Miguel Cabrera]]" Oaxaca, Oaxaca

Alongside to the educational offerings, there are some museums, galleries and buildings under the INBAL management, that the institute often use to present different types of artistic entertainment to general public, such as "[[tempestad]]"{{what|date=September 2015}} or a season of [[flamenco dance]].{{fact|date=September 2015}}

[[File:Jong meisje in klederdracht, door Johannes Evert Akkeringa.jpg|thumb|''Young Girl in regional costume'']]

'''Johannes Evert Hendrik Akkeringa''' (17 January 1861 – 12 April 1942) was part of the second generation of the [[Hague School]] painters. Akkeringa is primarily known for his paintings and [[watercolor painting|watercolours]] of women and playing children at the beach, women mending nets and intimate tea-time conversations.

== Youth ==
Akkeringa was born in [[Belinyu|Blinjoe]] in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. He was the second child of Johannes Evert Akkeringa (1829–1863), an engineer in the tin mines of the Billiton-Company at [[Bangka Island|Bangka]], and later at [[Buitenzorg]]. His mother, Sariedje (born in 1842), was of mixed [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and [[Javanese people|Javanese]] ethnic origin. Following the death of his father in 1864 from [[typhus]], Akkeringa moved with his brother and sister to [[The Hague]], where they grew up in the household of his aunt.

== Academy ==
In the spring of 1878, at the age of seventeen, Akkeringa enrolled at the [[Royal Academy of Art (The Hague)|Royal Academy of Art]] in The Hague. He quickly befriended fellow student [[Willem de Zwart]] (1862–1931) and other artists studying at the Academy, including [[Floris Verster]] (1861–1927) and [[Marius Bauer]] (1867–1932). It is likely that during this period Akkeringa met and became close to the artist [[Isaac Israëls]] (1865–1934). At the Academy the courses Akkeringa took focussed on anatomical drawing, drawing from models, as well as studying the arts of perspective and composition. After class Akkeringa, like many of his fellow students, left the city to explore and practice the art of drawing nature, discovering that he was most inspired by the landscape around The Hague. In the spring of 1883 Akkeringa received his degree, though he continued to take classes at the Academy until 1885.

From August 1886 until the end of 1887 Akkeringa took a course at the [[Willem de Kooning Academy|Rotterdam Academy]]. In the same year he participated for the first time in the ‘Living Masters Exhibition’ at the Royal Academy of Art in The Hague.

== Art societies ==
Late in 1887, Akkeringa moved to The Hague. Several months later, he moved again to [[Loosduinen]] to focus entirely on his painting. During this period, the so-called ‘Loosduinse painters colony’, or ‘The Hague [[Barbizon]]’, began. Artists involved in this movement besides Akkeringa included [[Willem de Zwart]] (1862–1931), who was a great influence on Akkringas style, [[George Hendrik Breitner]] (1857–1923), [[Jan Toorop]] (1858–1928), [[Theo van Hoytema]] (1863–1917), [[Hendrik Otto van Thol]] (1859–1902), [[Marius Bauer]] (1867–1932) and several others. The artists of the Hague School were attracted to Loosduinen and the surrounding dunes, because the area was viewed as one of the last remaining authentic natural landscapes in the region.

In October 1889, Akkeringa became a member of The Hague art society, [[Pulchri Studio]]. Among others, Akkeringa and [[Théophile de Brock]] established a board for [[The Hague Art Circle]]. Unlike the Pulchri Studio, The Hague Art Circle included art forms other than painting. On 26 June 1892, [[Johannes Hendrik Haverman]] proposed Akkeringa as a friend of the art society '[[Arti et Amicitiae]]'. On 25 February 1897 Akkeringa along with his friend [[Floris Arntzenius]] (1864–1925), was adopted as a member of the '[[Hollandsche Teekenmaatschappij]]', of which he was a board member from 1912 to 1917.

In February 1892, Akkeringa, Jan Toorop, Marius Bauer and Willem de Zwart were commissioned to illustrate a collection of [[fairy tale]]s published by the Amsterdam publishing house [[Elsevier]]. The book, by [[Louse Ahn-De Jongh]], was titled ''A Book of Imagination, Fairy Tales and Stories'' and was published in 1893. From November 1892 to October 1896 Akkeringa continued to work as an [[illustrator]] for Elsevier's '[[Geïllustreerd Maandschrift]]' (the 'Illustrated Monthly'), to earn extra money.

== Family life ==
On 15 September 1892 Akkeringa married his niece Willemina Suzanna (Mien) Reedijk (1866–1909), and the young couple moved to a house on the outskirts of The Hague. Shortly afterwards two sons were born, Leonard Johannes (Leo) (1893–1959) and Johannes Evert (Jan) (1894–1983). During their marriage the couple regularly moved around the growing city of The Hague and the nearby village of [[Scheveningen]]. Akkeringa preferred to live in homes on the outskirts of the city; not only did the landscapes of where he lived inspire him, but often his sons and their friends became the subjects of his paintings. In April 1903 the family, including his mother-in-law, moved to the village of [[Heeze]] in the province of [[North Brabant]]. Their home was known as 'Villa Erica'. The landscape of Heeze is the subject of many of Akkeringa’s paintings. In 1905 the family went to live in Scheveningen, where Akkeringa’s wife Mien died on 12 December 1909.

On 20 April 1917, when Akkeringa was sixty-five, he married the thirty-two-year-old Elsje Wilhelmine Enter (1895–1969). On 27 August 1921 his third son, Evert Hendrik Jan Akkeringa, was born. In 1932 Akkeringa visited his oldest son Leo, who lived in [[Paris]]; it would be the only foreign trip Akkeringa would ever make.

Akkeringa died at the age of eighty-one. He was buried on 15 April 1942 at Rusthof cemetery in [[Amersfoort]]. In May that year an exhibition was held by members of the Pulchri Studio to commemorate his life and work. On 23 March 1943 the contents of Akkeringa’s studio were auctioned off by the Amsterdam auction house Frederik Muller &amp; Cie.

== Works and exhibitions ==
In 1903, Akkringa was offered a contract by the Amsterdam-based [[art dealer]] E.J. van Wisselingh. His work was not only exhibited in [[Amsterdam]], but also at the [[London]] branch of the company. He participated in several international exhibitions in [[Hamburg]] (1902), [[Budapest]] (1908), [[Berlin]] (1908), [[Pittsburgh]] (1904, 1907 and 1909), [[Buenos Aires]] (1910), [[Brussels]] (1910) and the Canadian city of [[Winnipeg]] (1913). From 1903 to 1914 Van Wisselingh organized a yearly exhibition at the Pulchri Studio where the work of Akkeringa was regularly shown with, in April 1904, a joint exhibition of the works of Akkeringa and fellow Dutch [[Indo people|Indo]] [[Jan Toorop]]. In mid-1909 Akkeringa built a studio in the [[dune]]s at Meijendel, between The Hague and [[Wassenaar]]. The studio was financed by Van Wisselingh and served as a classroom in which Akkeringa taught his students.

In 1914 Akkeringa participated in the [[Venice Biennale]], and the exposition ‘Tentoonstelling van werk van Nederlandsche, in Indië geboren schilders’ at the Dutch art-circle at [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]]. In 1918, Akkringa passed his secondary vocational-course at the Royal Academy of Art in The Hague, and he was appointed teacher for hand-drawing. In December 1921 Akkeringa had his first retrospective exhibition in the rooms of the Pulchri Studio. The exhibition was organized by the art dealer Van Wisselingh. In early 1924 Akkeringa’s contract with Van Wisseling, which included a monthly allowance, ended.

A jubilee exhibition was organized at Pulchri Studio in January 1932 on Akkeringa’s seventy-first birthday. On 17 January 1932 an anniversary celebration was organized at Pulchri Studio, at which Akkeringa received a portfolio by his friends and admirers.

In May 1942 the last retrospective exhibition of Akkeringa's work opened in commemoration of the painter. After this exhibition Akkeringa, and mostly his work, was largely forgotten by the public. In mid-2005, the painter and his work were brought to the attention of the public again by an exhibition, organized by auction house [[Christie's]] Amsterdam, called: 'J.E.H. Akkeringa; schilders van tuin en duin'. His work is regularly sold at auction today.

== Prizes ==
* A first official token of recognition came on 28 February 1887, when Akkeringa won the Royal subsidy for the year 1887, by the commission of the Royal Subsidies of [[Arti et Amicitiae]].
* In January 1890, Akkeringa won the Willink van Collen-competition with his watercolour ''Een Wandeling in het duin''. In February 1894, he won the prize for a second time.
* In 1900 Akkeringa won a gold medal at the [[World's Fair]] in Paris.
* In 1905 Akkeringa received a silver medal from Queen Mother Emmaeen, for his work at the exhibition Gemeentelijkse Tentoonstellingen van Kunstwerken van Levende Meesters in Arnhem (derde Vierjaarlijksche).
* In 1909 Akkeringa again received a gold medal on the exhibition in [[Arnhem]], and received a second Gold Medal in June on the exhibition X-Internationale Kunst Ausstellung in [[Munich]].
* In May 1910 Akkeringa won a bronze medal with a beach view at the [[Exposición Internacional del Centenario (1910)|Exposición Internacional del Centenario]] in [[Buenos Aires]].

'''''La haine''''' ({{IPA-fr|la ʔɛn}}, ''Hate'') is a 1995 French [[black-and-white]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] written, co-edited, and directed by [[Mathieu Kassovitz]]. It is commonly released under its French title in the [[English-speaking world]], although its U.S. VHS release was titled '''''Hate'''''. It is about three young friends and their struggle to live in the ''[[banlieue]]s'' of Paris. The title derives from a line spoken by one of them, Hubert, ''"La haine attire la haine!"'', "hatred breeds hatred."

==Plot==
The film depicts approximately 20 consecutive hours in the lives of three friends in their early twenties from immigrant families living in an impoverished multi-ethnic French [[housing project]] (a ZUP{{snd}}''{{lang|fr|zone d'urbanisation prioritaire}}'') in the suburbs of Paris, in the aftermath of a riot. [[Jew]]ish Vinz ([[Vincent Cassel]]) is filled with rage. He sees himself as a gangster ready to win respect by killing a police officer, manically practising the role of Travis Bickle from the film ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' in the mirror secretly. His attitude towards police is a simplified, stylized blanket condemnation, also to individual police officers who make an effort to steer the trio clear of troublesome situations. Hubert ([[Hubert Koundé]]) is an [[Afro-French]] boxer and small-time drug dealer, the most mature of the three, whose gymnasium was burned in the riots. The quietest, most thoughtful and wisest of the three, he sadly contemplates the ghetto and the hate around him. He expresses the wish to leave his world of violence and hate behind, but does not know how since he lacks the means to do so. Saïd{{snd}}Sayid in some English subtitles{{snd}}([[Saïd Taghmaoui]]) is an [[Arab]] [[Maghrebis|Maghrebi]] who inhabits the middle ground between his two friends' responses to their place in life.

A friend of theirs, Abdel Ichaha, has been brutalized by the police shortly before the riot and lies in a coma. Vinz finds a police officer's [[.44 Magnum]] revolver, lost in the riot. He vows that if their friend dies from his injuries, he will use it to kill a cop, and when he hears of Abdel's death he fantasizes carrying out his vengeance.

The three go through an aimless daily routine and struggle to entertain themselves, frequently finding themselves under police scrutiny. After Vinz nearly shoots a riot police officer and the group narrowly escapes, they take a train to Paris but encounter many of the same frustrations, and their responses to interactions with both benign and malicious Parisians cause several situations to degenerate to dangerous hostility. A run-in with sadistic [[Undercover operation#Plainclothes law enforcement|plainclothes]] police, during which Saïd and Hubert are humiliated and racially as well as physically abused, results in their missing the last train home and spending the night on the streets. They sleep in a shopping mall and wake to a news broadcast informing them that Abdel is dead. They travel to a roof-top from which they insult skinheads and policemen, before encountering the same group of racist anti-immigrant skinheads who begin to beat Saïd and Hubert savagely, now that the balance of power has shifted. Vinz arrives, and his gun allows him to break up the fight; all the skinheads flee except one (portrayed by Kassovitz himself) whom Vinz is about to execute in cold blood. His dream of revenge is thwarted by his reluctance to go through with the deed, and, cleverly goaded by Hubert, he is forced to confront the fact that his true nature is not the heartless gangster he poses as, and he lets the skinhead flee.

Early in the morning, the trio returns to the [[banlieue]] and split up to their separate homes, and Vinz turns the gun over to Hubert. However, Vinz and Saïd encounter a plainclothes police officer, whom Vinz had insulted earlier in the day whilst with his friends on a local rooftop. He grabs and threatens Vinz, making reference to the earlier incident on the roof. Hubert rushes to their aid, but as the police officer holding Vinz taunts him with a loaded gun held to Vinz's head, the gun accidentally goes off, killing Vinz instantly. Hubert and the police officer slowly and deliberately point their guns at each other, and as the film cuts to Saïd closing his eyes and cuts to black, a shot is heard on the soundtrack, with no indication of who fired or who may have been hit. This stand-off is underlined by a voice-over of Hubert's slightly modified opening lines ("It's about a society in free fall..."), underlining the fact that, as the lines say, ''jusqu'ici tout va bien'' ("so far so good"); all seems to be going relatively well until Vinz is killed, and from there no one knows what will happen, a microcosm of French society's descent through hostility into pointless violence.

==Production==
Kassovitz has said that the idea came to him when a young [[Zaire|Zairian]], Makome M’Bowole, was shot in 1993. He was killed at point blank range while in police custody and handcuffed to a radiator. The officer was reported to have been angered by Makome's words, and had been threatening him when the gun went off accidentally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Kevin|last=Elstob|title=Hate (La Haine) review|journal=[[Film Quarterly]]|volume=51|issue=2 (Winter, 1997-1998)|pages=44–49|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|location=Berkeley, California|issn=0015-1386|jstor=3697140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kassovitz began writing the script on April 6, 1993, the day M'Bowole was shot. He was also inspired by the case of [[Malik Oussekine]], a 22-year-old student protester who died after being badly beaten by the riot police after a mass demonstration in 1986, in which he did not take part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/30/international/europe/30smashers.html?_r=0|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|first=Elaine|last=Sciolino|title=Violent Youths Threaten to Hijack Demonstrations in Paris|date=30 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oussekine's death is also referred to in the opening montage of the film.&lt;ref name="criterion.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/642-la-haine-and-after-arts-politics-and-the-banlieue|title=La haine and after: Arts, Politics, and the Banlieue|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mathieu Kassovitz included his own experiences; he took part in riots, he acts in a number of scenes and includes his father [[Peter Kassovitz|Peter]] in another.

The majority of the filming was done in the Parisian suburb of [[Chanteloup-les-Vignes]]. Unstaged footage was used for this film, taken from 1986–96; riots still took place during the time of filming. To actually film in the projects, Kassovitz, the production team and the actors, moved there for three months prior to the shooting as well as during actual filming.&lt;ref name="dvdbeaver1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdbeaver.com/film/dvdreviews5/hate.htm|title=la HAINE|accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the film's controversial subject matter, seven or eight local French councils refused to allow the film crew to film on their territory.

The film has a documentary feel and includes many situations that were based on real events.&lt;ref name="dvdbeaver1"/&gt;

The music of the film was handled by French hardcore rap group [[Assassin (rap crew)|Assassin]], whose song "Nique La Police" (translated as "Fuck The Police") was featured in one of the scenes of the film. One of the members of Assassin, [[Rockin' Squat|Mathias "Rockin' Squat" Crochon]], is the brother of Vincent Cassel, who plays Vinz in the film.&lt;ref name="criterion.com"/&gt;

The film is dedicated to those who died while it was being made.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

==Reception==
Upon its release, ''La haine'' received widespread critical acclaim and was well received in France and abroad. The film was shown at the [[1995 Cannes Film Festival]] where it enjoyed a standing ovation. Kassovitz was awarded the Best Director prize at the festival.&lt;ref name="criterion.com"/&gt; The film had a total of 2,042,070 admissions in France where it was the 14th highest-grossing film of the year.&lt;ref name="JPBox Office" /&gt; Based on 25 reviews collected by [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an overall approval rating from critics of 100%, with an average score of 8/10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La Haine (1996)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/la_haine/|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango]]|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kevin Thomas of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called the film "raw, vital and captivating".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Compelling, Bleak Look at 'Hate'|first=Kevin|last=Thomas|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-03-08/entertainment/ca-44396_1_mathieu-kassovitz|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=8 March 1996|accessdate=7 July 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zzKlcUKj?url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-03-08/entertainment/ca-44396_1_mathieu-kassovitz|archivedate=7 July 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wendy Ide of ''[[The Times]]'' stated that ''La haine'' is "One of the most blisteringly effective pieces of urban cinema ever made."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=La Haine|first=Wendy|last=Ide|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article471243.ece|newspaper=[[The Times]]|date=19 August 2004|accessdate=7 July 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zzKyBCst?url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article471243.ece|archivedate=7 July 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the film was well received upon its release in France, [[Alain Juppé]], who was Prime Minister of France at the time, commissioned a special screening of the film for the cabinet, which ministers were required to attend. A spokesman for the Prime Minister said that, despite resenting some of the anti-police themes present in the film, Juppé found ''La haine'' to be "a beautiful work of cinematographic art that can make us more aware of certain realities."&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt;

Published in 2008

After years of incessant fighting, the war between humanity and the High Beasts is brought to an end after the humans begin using [[firearms]], forcing the comparatively primitive High Beasts to declare a truce. It is decided that an interspecific marriage be formed between Aube, the daughter of the human nobleman Arcan, and Loup-de-Feu, the son of the Beast Lord Loup-de-Traille. Aube is not pleased with the arrangement, believing that the product of such a union would be a [[blasphemy]]. When the time comes to consummate the marriage, Aube's brother Saliat assassinates Loup-de-Feu, and escapes with his sister while the High Beasts declare the truce null. After the High Beasts indulge in a slaughter, Arcan is approached by Griffe-Tout, a lynx who offers to give him information on his daughter on the condition that he sacrifice a pound of his own flesh to him. He reveals that Saliat has been killed by the High Beasts, while Aube escaped to the Wood of Virgins, an area from only [[virgin]]s can come out alive.
[[Image:Les Betes Haute.jpg|thumb|The High-Beasts advance against human forces]]
Years later, the war between the two races has reached a [[stalemate]], with neither side gaining advantage over the other. Though the humans are technologically superior, the High Beasts are physically stronger, more numerous, and have faster growth rates, thus allowing troops to be replenished quicker. In order to break the stalemate, the humans send an envoy, Hugo, to find the banished Lord Clam, who is a famed wolf killer. Under similar orders from his own superior officer, Loup-de-Traille reluctantly accepts to find his eldest and most skilled son, Loup-Gris whom he previously disowned for having married a fox. Loup-de-Traille discovers that his son now has two hybrid children, and refuses to involve himself in the war. Suspecting that his son's wife Lady Goupil has softened him, Loup-de-Traille leaves heavy hearted. Along the way, he finds a band of human bandits attacking a group of foxes. Loup-de-Traille intervenes, but is decapitated by the bandit leader. His body is found by Griffe-Tout and his band of lynxes, and is taken to his son, who decides to form an alliance of High and Low Beasts in order to defeat the human forces. Meanwhile, Hugo discovers a delirious human soldier covered in plant-like growths. Hugo takes him to a monastery, where it is discovered that he found Aube in the Wood of Virgins. The abbot of the monastery reveals himself to be the disgraced Arcan, who offers to aide in the war effort on condition that his daughter be found and returned to him. Hugo crosses a cursed swamp filled inhabited by tree spirits, and finds Clam in a Church, taking a sacrament. The two depart to the Wood of Virgins.

[[File:Dietrich und Hildebrand kaempfen gegen Drachen.jpg|thumb|Scene from the poem ''Virginal'': Dietrich von Bern and Hildebrand fight against dragons. Note that Dietrich is breathing fire. UBH Cod.Pal.germ. 324 fol. 43r]]

In '''legends about [[Theoderic the Great]]''' that spread after his death, the [[Goths|Gothic]] king Theoderic became known as '''Dietrich von Bern''', a king ruling from [[Verona]] (Bern) who was forced into exile with the [[Huns]]. The differences between the known life of Theoderic and the picture of Dietrich in the surviving legends are usually attributed to a long-standing [[oral tradition]] that continued into the sixteenth century. The majority of legendary material about Dietrich/Theoderic comes from high and late medieval [[Holy Roman Empire|Germany]] and is composed in [[Middle High German]] or [[Early New High German]]. Another important source for legends about Dietrich is the [[Old Norse]] ''[[Thidrekssaga]]'', which was written using German sources. In addition to the legends detailing events that may reflect the historical Theoderic's life in some fashion, many of the legends tell of Dietrich's battles against [[Dwarf (mythology)|dwarfs]], [[dragon]]s, [[giant]]s, and other mythical beings, as well as other [[hero]]es such as [[Sigurd|Siegfried]]. Dietrich also appears as a supporting character in other heroic poems such as the ''[[Nibelungenlied]]'', and is frequently referenced and alluded to throughout [[medieval German literature]].

Poems about Dietrich were extremely popular among the medieval German nobility and, later, the late medieval and early modern bourgeoisie, but were frequently targets of criticism by persons writing on behalf of the church. Though some continued to be printed in the seventeenth century, most of the legends were slowly forgotten after 1600. They became objects of academic study by the end of the sixteenth century, and were revived somewhat in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, resulting in some stories about Dietrich being popular in [[South Tyrol]], where many of the legends take place.

== Development of an oral tradition about Theoderic the Great ==
[[File:Theoderich odoaker bav cpl 927.jpg|thumb|Theoderic's fight against Odoacer imagined as a joust, 1181 from Verona. Vatican Library Cpl 927]]
Although the lives of Dietrich von Bern and Theoderic the Great have many important differences, it was never questioned throughout the entire Middle Ages that the two were the same figure.{{sfn|Lienert|2008|p=3}} Modern scholarship therefore generally accepts this identification and has focused on ways to explain the main differences between Theoderic and Dietrich.

The most striking difference is that, whereas Theoderic the Great conquerred Italy as an invader, Dietrich von Bern is portrayed as exiled from his rightful kingdom in Italy.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|pp=4-5}} Victor Millet suggests that this difference in particular shows that heroic tradition has a fundamental discontinuity with the historical events that inspire it.{{sfn|Millet|2008|p=33}} In effect, Theoderic's conquest has been transformed according to a literary scheme consisting of exile, then return, a story which has a relatively consistent set of recurring motifs throughout world literature.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|p=6}} The story told in the heroic tradition is nevertheless meant to convey a particular understanding of the historical event, namely: that Dietrich/Theoderic was in the right when he conquered Italy.{{sfn|Millet|2008|pp=33-34}} To some extent, the development of the "exile-saga" of Theoderic can be traced in early medieval chronicles, where Theoderic is said to "reconquer" Italy and other information known from the later saga and not history is reported.{{sfn|Kragl|2007|pp=70-71}} Dietrich's exile and repeated failed attempts to reconquer his rightful kingdom, as reported in the later historical poems, may also be a reflection of the destruction of the Theoderic's Gothic kingdom by the [[Byzantine Empire]] under [[Justinian I]]. This is particularly true for the figure of [[Witege]] and his betrayal at Ravenna, as told in ''[[Die Rabenschlacht]]''.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|p=6}} Millet notes, furthermore, that Dietrich is portrayed as without any heirs and that his closest relatives and supporters die in every attempt to reclaim Italy: this too could be a way to explain the short duration of Ostrogothic rule in Italy.{{sfn|Millet|2008|p=36-37}}

A particularly noticeable difference between Theoderic and Dietrich is that, in the stories about Dietrich recorded from the [[High Middle Ages]], Dietrich/Theoderic (454-526) is a contemporary of Etzel ([[Attila the Hun]], died 453) and his uncle is semi-legendary Gothic king Ermenrich ([[Ermanaric]], died 370s). Their co-existence in the world of heroic legend is a process known as synchronization (''Synchronisierung'') that is common in many [[oral traditions]].{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|p=5}} In the case of Dietrich, its development can even be traced, to some extent: Dietrich is already associated with an exile among the Huns in the [[Old High German]] ''Hildebrandslied'' (before 900), and possibly with Etzel/Attila, depending on how one interprets the mentioned ''huneo druhtin'' (Hunnish lord),{{sfn|Haubrichs|2004|p=525}}. It nevertheless still retains Theoderic's historical opponent [[Odoacer]], seemingly showing that Odoacer was the original opponent. It is also possible that the author of the ''Hildebrandslied'' altered the report in the oral saga by replacing the unhistorical Emenrich with the historical Odoacer.{{sfn|Millet|2008|pp=34-35}} In the ''[[Annals of Quedlinburg]]'' (1008), Odoacer and Dietrich have both become relatives of Ermenrich;{{sfn|Haubrichs|2004|p=521}} at roughly the same time, Dietrich appears together with [[Witege]], a hero originally associated with Ermanaric, in the [[Old English]] ''[[Waldere]]'' fragment.{{sfn|Haubrichs|2004|p=517}} It is possible that Ermenrich/Ermanaric was drawn into the story due to his historical enmity with the Huns, who destroyed his kingdom. He was famous for killing his relatives, moreover, and so his attempts to kill his kinsman Dietrich make sense in the logic of the oral tradition.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|p=5}} By the 1000s, almost all figures of Germanic legend had been connected together in a [[Germanic heroic age|heroic age]], uniting the sagas of Etzel/Attila, Dietrich/Theoderic/Ermenrich/Ermanaric, [[Wayland the Smith]], and the [[Nibelungen]].{{sfn|Haubrichs|2004|pp=521-526}}

Additionally, Dietrich has a number of features that have been "mythologized" from Theoderic. In the early eleventh-century ''Waldere'' he is an enemy of [[giant]]s,{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|p=17}} and in later Middle High German texts he also fights against [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarfs]], and [[wild men]].{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|p=33}} Even more notable is the fact that multiple texts record Dietrich breathing fire. It is possible that this tradition comes from ecclesiastical criticism of the [[Arian]] Theoderic, whose soul, [[Gregory the Great]] reports, was dropped into [[Mount Etna]] as punishment for his persecution of orthodox Christians. Another notable tradition, first reported in the world chronicle of [[Otto of Freising]] (1143-1146), is that Theoderic rode to hell on an infernal horse while still alive.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|p=8}} He is attested as a ghostly rider appearing near the [[Moselle]] in the ''Chronica regia Coloniensia'' from before 1202,{{sfn|Lienert|2008|pp=89-90}} and as a spectral hunter of "nymphs" in the forest at night by the Veronese chronicler [[Giovanni Mansionario]] around 1320.{{sfn|Lienert|2008|pp=151-152}} [[Lusatia|Lusatian]] folklore in the nineteenth century may have identified Dietrich as the leader of the [[Wild Hunt]].{{sfn|Grimm|1867|p=41}} Other traditions record that Theoderic was the son of the devil. It is unclear whether these negative traditions are the invention of the Church or whether they are a demonization of an earlier [[apotheosis]] of the heretical Theoderic. None of the surviving heroic material demonizes Dietrich in this way, however, and presents a generally positive view of the hero.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|p=9}} Many of the texts show a tendency to minimize or explain away traits such as Dietrich's fiery breath.{{sfn|Kragl|2007|pp=84-88}}

Another minor difference between Theoderic and Dietrich is that Theoderic's capital was at [[Ravenna]], whereas Dietrich's is at Bern ([[Verona]]). This may suggest [[Lombards|Longobardic]] influence, as Verona was the Longobardic capital for a time, while Ravenna was under the control of the Byzantines.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|p=5}} The figure of Dietrich's tutor and mentor [[Hildebrand]] is also often thought to derive from Longobardic influence.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Norman, "Hildebrand and Hadubrand", in ''Three Essays on the 'Hildebrandslied' '', London 1973, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Heinzle suggests that the exile-saga may have been first told among the Longobards, giving the end of the sixth century as the latest date at which the story may have formed, with the Longobardic conquest of Italy.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|p=5}} Dietrich has been identified as "Dietrich ''von Bern''" (Middle High German for Verona) or ''Theodericus Veronensis'' since at least the composition of the ''Annals of Quedlinburg''.{{sfn|Lienert|2008|p=3}}

The non-academic researcher Heinz Ritter-Schaumburg has proposed an alternative explanation to the differences between Dietrich and Theoderic: according to Ritter-Schaumburg, Dietrich von Bern was an otherwise unattested historical Frankish king who ruled in Bonn, which sometimes is Latinized as Verona. In doing so, Ritter-Schaumburg relies on the Old Swedish version of the Thidrekssaga, believing that it is a translation of a lost German chronicle, rather than a translation of the Old Norwegian Thidrekssaga as is generally held by scholars. The Old Swedish Thidrekssaga, which Ritter-Schaumburg calls the ''Svava'', would be the only historical attestation of a series of persons who later became figures in Germanic heroic poetry; Dietrich would then later have been confused with Theoderic the Great.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ritter-Schaumburg |last2=Heinz |title=Die Nibelungen zogen nordwärts |date=1981 |publisher=Herbig |location=Munich|isbn=3442113474 |ref=harv}}  {{cite book |last1=Ritter-Schaumburg |last2=Heinz |title=Dietrich von Bern.

== Appearance in Early Germanic Literature==
===In Scandinavia===
[[File:Rökstenen2.JPG|thumb|The Rök stone, one of the earliest mentions of Theoderic in Germanic legend]]
One of the earliest (quasi-)literary sources about the legend of Theoderic is the [[Rök Stone]], carved in Sweden in the 9th century.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|p=15}} There he is mentioned in a stanza in Eddic meter:

&lt;poem style="margin-left: 2em;"&gt;Þjóðríkr the bold,
chief of sea-warriors,
ruled over the shores of the Hreiðsea.
Now he sits armed
on his Goth(ic horse),
his shield strapped,
the prince of the Mærings.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}&lt;/poem&gt;

The mention of Theoderic (among other heroes and gods of Norse mythology) may have been inspired by a no longer extant statue of an unknown emperor assumed to be Theoderic sitting on his horse in [[Ravenna]], which was moved in 801 A.D. to [[Aachen]] by [[Charlemagne]].  This statue was very famous and portrayed Theoderic with his shield hanging across his left shoulder, and his lance extended in his right hand: the German clerical poet [[Walahfrid]] wrote a poem (De imagine Tetrici) lampooning the statue, as Theoderic was not favorably regarded by the church.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|pp=12-13}} Alternatively, Otto Höfler has proposed that Theoderic on the horse may be connected in some way to traditions of Theoderic as the [[Wild Hunt]]sman (see the [[#Wunderer|Wunderer]] below); {{ill|Joachim Heinzle|de}} rejects this interpretation.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|p=16}}

===In Germany===
{{main|Hildebrandslied}}
Dietrich's earliest mention in Germany is the [[Hildebrandslied]], recorded around 820. In this, Hadubrand recounts the story of his father Hildebrand's flight eastwards in the company of Dietrich, to escape the enmity of [[Odoacer]] (this character would later become his uncle Ermanaric). Hildebrand reveals that he has lived in exile for 30 years. Hildebrand has an arm ring given to him by the (unnamed) King of the [[Huns]], and is taken to be an "old Hun" by Hadubrand. The obliqueness of the references to the Dietrich legend, which is just the background to Hildebrand's story, indicates an audience thoroughly familiar with the material. In this work Dietrich's enemy is the historically correct Odoacer (though in fact Theoderic the Great was never exiled by Odoacer), indicating that the figure of Ermanaric belongs to a later development of the legend.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|pp=11-12}}

===In Anglo-Saxon England===
Dietrich furthermore is mentioned in the Old English poems ''[[Waldere]]'', ''[[Deor]]'' and ''[[Widsith]]''. ''Deor'' marks the first mention to Dietrich's "thirty years" (probably his exile) and refers to him, like the Rök stone, as a Mæring. The ''Waldere'' makes mention of Dietrich's liberation from the captivity of giants by [[Witige]] (Widia), for which Dietrich rewarded Witige with a sword. This liberation forms the plot of the later fantastical poem ''Virginal'' and is mentioned in the historical poem ''Alpharts Tod''. ''Widsith'' mentions him among a number of other Gothic heroes, including Witige, Heime, the Harlungen and Ermanaric, and in connection with a battle with Attila's Huns. However, the exact relationship between the figures is not explained.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|p=17}}

== Middle High German Dietrich Poems ==
[[File:Dietrich im Kampf mit dem Wilden Mann, Stuttgart um 1470.jpg|thumb|Dietrich fights the [[wild man]] before encountering Sigenot]]
Dietrich von Bern first appears in Middle High German heroic poetry in the [[Nibelungenlied]]. There he appears in the exile situation at [[Attila the Hun|Etzel]]'s court that forms the basis for the historical Dietrich poems (see below).{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|pp=24-25}} Dietrich also appears in the ''[[Nibelungenklage]]'', a work closely related to the ''Nibelungenlied'' that describes the aftermath of that poem. In the ''Klage'', Dietrich returns from exile to his kingdom of Italy; the poem also alludes to the events described in the later [[Rabenschlacht]].{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|pp=25-26}} Poems with Dietrich as the main character begin to enter writing afterwards, with the earliest attested being the fantastical poem the [[Eckenlied]] (c. 1230).&lt;ref&gt;Heinzle 1999, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; The oral tradition continued alongside this written tradition, with influences from the oral tradition visible in the written texts, and with the oral tradition itself most likely altered in response to the written poems.{{sfn|Millet|2008|pp=352-354}}

The Middle High German Dietrich poems are usually divided into two categories: historical poems and fantastical (or "fairy tale") poems.  The former concern the story of Dietrich's fights against Ermenrich and exile at Etzel's court, whereas in the latter he battles against various mythological creatures. This latter group is often called "aventiurehaft" in German, referring to its similarity to [[courtly romance]].{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|p=33}} While Edward Haymes and Susan Samples believe that the distinctions between the two types are not strict,{{sfn|Haymes|Samples|1996|p=67}} Joachim Heinzle notes that the two groups are never transmitted together in the same manuscripts.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|p=34}} The two types are joined together in the Old Norse [[Thidrekssaga]], based on German sources, and to a lesser extent in the [[Heldenbuch]]prosa.{{sfn|Haymes|Samples|1996|p=67}} Despite connections  made between different Dietrich poems and to other heroic cycles such as the [[Nibelungenlied]], [[Wolfdietrich]], and [[Ortnit]], the Dietrich poems never form a closed poetic cycle, with the relationships between the different poems being rather loose: there is no attempt to establish a concrete biography of Dietrich.{{sfn|Millet|2008|pp=352-354}}{{sfn|Millet|2008|pp=334-335}}{{sfn|Millet|2008|p=401}} Rather, the heroic tales and their characters seem to form a sort of "matter," similar to the [[Matter of Britain]], [[Matter of France]], and [[Matter of Rome]], in which ever more new episodes can be invented using both new and existing characters in the situations characteristic of the tales and poems that already exist.{{sfn|Millet|2008|pp=328-329}}

The historical Dietrich poems in Middle High German consist of [[Dietrichs Flucht]], [[Die Rabenschlacht]], and ''Alpharts Tod'', with the fragmentary poem [[Dietrich und Wenezlan]] as a possible fourth.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|pp=32-33}} All involve Dietrich's exile at Etzel's court except ''Alpharts Tod'', which takes place before Dietrich's expulsion, and all involve his battles against Ermenrich, except for ''Dietrich und Wenezlan'', in which he fights against Wenezlan of Poland. All four postdate Dietrich's appearance in the [[Nibelungenlied]].{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|pp=23-27}} They are called historical because they concern war rather than adventure, and are seen as containing a warped version of Theoderic's life.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|p=58}} Given the combination of elements also found in these texts with historical events in some chronicles, and the vehement denunciation of the saga by learned chroniclers, it is possible that these texts-or the oral tradition behind them-were themselves considered historical.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|pp=27-28}}{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|pp=61-63}}

[[File:Dietrich and Siegfried.png|thumb|Dietrich and Siegfried from a 15th-century manuscript of the ''Rosengarten zu Worms'']]
The majority of preserved narratives about Dietrich are fantastical in nature, involving battles against mythical beings and other heroes. They are generally regarded as containing newer material than the historical poems, though, as the Old English Waldere's references show, Dietrich was already associated with monsters at an early date.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|pp=33-34}} Many of the poems show a close connect to the [[History of Tyrol|Tyrol]], and connections between them and [[alpine folklore|Tyrolean folklore]] are often speculated upon, even in cases where the text itself clearly originated in a different [[German speaking area]].&lt;ref&gt;See Paulus Bernardus Wessels, "Dietrichepik und Südtiroler Erzählsubstrat," in ''Zeitschrift für deutsche Philologie'' 85 (1966), 345-369&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the poems seem to take place prior to Dietrich's exile, with Witige and Heime still members of Dietrich's entourage, though not all: the ''Eckenlied'' prominently features references to the events of ''Die Rabenschlacht'' as already having taken place.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|p=34}}

Different exemplars of the fantastical poems often show a huge degree of variation from each other (Germ. ''Fassungsdivergenz''), a trait not found in the historical poems. Most fantastical poems have at least two versions containing substantial differences in the narrative, including inserting or removing entire episodes or altering the motivation of characters, etc.{{sfn|Millet|2008|pp=333-334}} The scholar Harald Haferland has proposed that the differences may come from a practice of reciting entire poems from memory, using set formula to fill in lines and occasionally adding or deleting episodes. Haferland nevertheless believes thattThe poems were likely composed as written texts, and thus periodically new versions were written down.{{sfn|Haferland|2004}} Haferland relates this latter process to the psychological term [[confabulation]], the invention of false memories to fill in stories.&lt;ref&gt;Harald Haferland, "'Poesie' des Synchronismus. Historizität, Konfabulation und Mythisierung in der Heldendichtung," in ''9. Pöchlarner Heldenliedgespräch : Heldenzeiten - Heldenräume : wann und wo spielen Heldendichtung und Heldensage?,'' ed. Johannes Keller and Florian Kragl (Vienna, Fassbaender, 2007), 9-26&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of the fantastical poems can be said to follow two basic narrative schemes, in some cases combining them: the liberation of a woman from a threatening legendary being, and the challenging of Dietrich to combat by some antagonist.{{sfn|Millet|2008|pp=357-358}} The combinations of these schemes can at times lead to narrative breaks and inconsistencies in character motivation.{{sfn|Millet|2008|p=358}}

===Metrical Forms===
Almost all the poems about Dietrich are written in stanzas. Melodies for some of the stanzaic forms have survived, and they were probably meant to be sung.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|p=64}} Several poems are written in [[rhyming couplets]], however, a form more common for courtly romance or chronicles. These poems are ''[[Dietrichs Flucht]]'', ''[[Dietrich und Wenezlan]]'', most versions of ''[[Laurin]]'', and some versions of the ''[[Wunderer]]''.{{sfn|Hoffmann|1974|p=17}}

Much of the poem ''Alphart's Tod'' is written in the same stanza as the ''Nibelungenlied'': it consists of four so-called "Langzeilen." The first three "Langzeilen" consist of three metrical feet, a [[caesura]], and an additional three metrical feet. The last line adds a fourth foot after the caesura.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|pp=84-85}} Several of the poems are written using a variant of this stanza, known as the "Hildebrandston" for its use in the ''[[Jüngeres Hildebrandslied]]''. Unlike the ''Nibelungenlied-''stanza, all four lines in the "Hildebrandston" are of the same length: three metrical feet, followed by a caesura, then three additional metrical feet. Both types of stanza rhyme in couplets.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|p=85}} Some poems use a variant of the "Hildebrandston" known as the "Heunenweise" or "Hunnenweise" (the Hunnish melody), in which the words before caesuras also rhyme across lines, creating a rhyme scheme '''ababcdcd'''.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|p=173}} The ''Rabenschlacht'' uses a unique stanza consisting of three "Langzeilen" with rhymes at the caesuras: in this form, the first line is equivalent to a line of the Hildebrandston, the second adds an additional foot after the caesura, and the third adds two or even three additional feet.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|pp=65-66}} In most editions, the caesuras are reinterpreted as line-endings, so that the stanza appears as six short lines.{{sfn|Millet|2008|p=405}}

Four of the fantastical poems, the ''[[Eckenlied]]'', [[Virginal (poem)|''Virginal'']], the ''[[Sigenot]]'', and ''[[Goldemar]]'' are written in a complex rhyming stanza known as the "Berner Ton." Originally, the stanza mixed "Langzeilen" with shorter lines of four feet known from [[Minnesang]] stanzas, but over time it came to be interpreted as 13 short lines.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|pp=101-102}} Victor Millet sees the "Berner Ton" as a way for these poems to distance themselves from tradition: the stanza is extremely complex and artistic rather than simple or archaic.{{sfn|Millet|2008|p=333}}Nevertheless, early modern melodies for the "Berner Ton" have survived, so that it was probably sung in the traditional manner of German heroic poetry.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|pp=102-103}} As the ''Goldemar'' alone among all the Dietrich poems names an author thought to be genuine, Albrecht von Kemenaten, earlier scholarship believed him to be the author of all four poems; this is no longer thought to be the case.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|p=103}}

Further information on the metrical forms of the stanzaic poems, including examples, can be found on the pages for the individual poems.

=== Historical Dietrich poems ===
'''Dietrichs Flucht'''
{{main|Dietrichs Flucht}} 
In ''Dietrichs Flucht'' (Dietrich's flight), also called ''Das Buch von Bern'' (the book of Verona), Dietrich is forced into exile by his wicked uncle Ermenrich. Dietrich goes into exile at Etzel's court. There he receives Etzel's support for three further campaigns. In each one, he defeats Ermenrich, yet is nevertheless unable to retake his kingdom.

''' Die Rabenschlacht '''
{{main|Die Rabenschlacht}}
In ''Die Rabenschlacht'' (the battle of Ravenna), Dietrich begins a new campaign to reconquer Italy, bringing his young brother Diether and the young sons of Etzel with him. Dietrich conquers Verona, where he leaves Etzel's sons and his brother, who nonetheless sneak out of the city. Dietrich's forces fight a massive battle at Ravenna, defeating Ermenrich, who escapes. At the same time, however, the young warriors encounter the [[Witege]]. They fight him and are slain. Dietrich, after the battle, chases Witege, who rather than fighting Dietrich rides into the sea, where he is saved by a sea-spirit named Wachilt. Dietrich is forced to leave Italy once again for exile.

''' Alpharts Tod '''
{{main|Alpharts Tod}}
In ''Alpharts Tod'' (the death of Alphart), Alphart, a young hero in Dietrich's army fighting the Battle of Ravenna, goes out to fight alone against Witege and [[Heime]], who had deserted to Ermenrich, and he falls, not in fair battle, but by the treachery of Witege, whose life he had spared.

''' Dietrich und Wenezlan '''
{{main|Dietrich und Wenezlan}}
In ''Dietrich und Wenezlan'' (Dietrich and Wenezlan), Dietrich is challenged to combat while at Etzel's court by Wenezlan, King of Poland, to single combat between two armies. The poem is a fragment and ends without a conclusion.

=== Fantastical poems ===
''' Eckenlied '''
{{main|Das Eckenlied}} 
The ''Eckenlied'' (the song of Ecke) tells the story of the giant Ecke, who sets off to find and fight Dietrich to test his mettle. Dietrich is forced to kill Ecke after they fight, and then must deal with Ecke's giant family, particularly Ecke's brother Fasolt, as they seek revenge.

''' Goldemar '''
{{main|Goldemar}}
''Goldemar'' tells the story of how Dietrich saved a princess from the dwarf king Goldemar. The poem is a fragment. It is the only Dietrich poem with an author accepted as genuine, Albrecht von Kemenaten, and is seen as an anti-heroic epic.

''' Laurin '''
{{main|Laurin (poem)}}
The ''Laurin'', also called ''der kleine Rosengarten'' (the small rose garden) was one of the most popular poems about Dietrich and is attested in numerous manuscripts and printed versions. The poem tells the story of Dietrich's encounter with the dwarf Laurin and the dwarf's magical rose garden, followed by a treacherous invitation to the dwarf's mountain and the subsequent defeat of Laurin.

''' Der Rosengarten zu Worms '''
{{main|Rosengarten zu Worms}}
''Der Rosengarten zu Worms'', also called ''der große Rosengarten'' to differentiate it from ''Laurin'', tells the story of a challenge, given to Dietrich by Kriemhilt, to fight her fiancé [[Sigurd|Siegfried]] in a rose garden. The poem was very popular, and is notable for its [[metaliterature|metaliterary]] aspects commenting German [[heroic poetry]] and the [[Nibelungenlied]] in particular.

''' Sigenot '''
{{main|Sigenot}}
The ''Sigenot'' was one of the most popular stories about Dietrich. It tells the story of a young Dietrich's fight with and capture by the giant Sigenot. He is freed by Hildebrand, who kills the giant with the help of the dwarf Eggerich.

''' Virginal '''
{{main|Virginal (poem)}}
The ''Virginal'', also called ''Dietrichs erste Ausfahrt'' (Dietrich's first quest) or ''Dietrich und seine Gesellen'' (Dietrich and his companions) tells the story of how a young Dietrich saved the dwarf queen Virginal from the invading heathen canibal Orkise. Some versions also include his capture by giants and an episode in which he saves a man who is being swallowed by a dragon.

''' Der Wunderer '''
{{main|Wunderer}}
The ''Wunderer'' (Middle High German for monster), also called ''Etzels Hofhaltung'' (the courtly feast of Etzel) tells the story of a young Dietrich's encounter with the titular Wunderer, a monstrous man who is hunting a woman, while staying at Etzel's court.

====Ortnit and Wolfdietrich====
{{main|Ortnit}}{{main|Wolfdietrich}}
[[File:Heldenbuch.1590.fol.064v.jpg|thumb|Beginning of an early modern printed version of Wolfdietrich.]]
The two heroic epics ''Ortnit'' and ''Wolfdietrich'', preserved in several widely varying versions, do not feature Dietrich von Bern directly but are strongly associated with the Dietrich cycle, and most versions share the strophic form of the Hildebrandston.  These two poems, along with ''Laurin'' and ''Rosengarten'', form the core of the Strassburg Heldenbuch and the later printed Heldenbücher,{{sfn|Miklautsch|2005|pp=63, 69–70}} and are the first of the ten Dietrich poems in the Dresden Heldenbuch.{{sfn|Miklautsch|2005|p=42}} In the [[Ambraser Heldenbuch]] they close the collection of heroic epics, which starts with ''[[Dietrichs Flucht]]'' and the ''[[Rabenschlacht]]''.{{sfn|Miklautsch|2005|p=40}}

The basis for the association is the identification of Wolfdietrich as the grandfather of Dietrich. This connection is attested as early as 1230 in the closing strophe of ''Ortnit A'',{{sfn|Miklautsch|2005|p=89}}, is perpetuated by the inclusion of truncated versions of ''Ortnit'' and ''Wolfdietrich'' in ''Dietrichs Flucht'' among the stories of Dietrich's ancestors,{{sfn|Millet|2008|p=401}} and is repeated in the Heldenbuch-Prose of the 15th and 16th centuries, where Ortnit and Wolfdietrich are placed at the beginning of the Dietrich cycle.{{sfn|Heinzle|199|p=46}} Scholars have sometimes supposed that ''Wolfdietrich'' tells the story of legends about Dietrich that somehow became disassociated from him.{{sfn|Hoffmann|1974|pp=144-145}} In the Old Norse ''Thidreksaga'', Thidrek (Dietrich) plays Wolfdietrich's role as the avenger of Hertnid (Ortnit), which may suggest that the two heroes were once identical.{{sfn|Millet|2008|pp=394-395}}

A further link is Dietrich's golden suit of impenetrable armour. This was originally received by Ortnit from his natural father, the dwarf Alberich. Ortnit is killed by a dragon who, being unable to kill him through his armour, sucks him out of it. When Wolfdietrich later avenges Ortnit by killing the dragon, he takes possession of the abandoned armour, and after his death it remains in the monastery to which he retired. In the ''Eckenlied'' we are told that the monastery later sold it to Queen Seburg for 50,000 marks, and she in turn gives it to Ecke. When Dietrich later defeats the giant, the armour finally passes into Dietrich's possession.{{sfn|Haferland|2004||p=374}}

==== Biterolf und Dietleib ====
{{main|Biterolf und Dietleib}}
''Biterolf and Dietleib'' is a heroic epic transmitted in the [[Ambraser Heldenbuch]]. It is closely related to the ''Rosengarten zu Worms''. It tells the story of the heroes King Biterolf of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] and his son Dietleib, relatives of [[Walter of Aquitaine]]. The two heroes live at Etzel's court and receive [[Styria]] as a reward for their successful defense of Etzel's kingdom. In the second half of the work, there is a battle against the Burdundian heroes Gunther, Gernot, and Hagen at Worms, in which Dietleib avenges an earlier attempt by Hagen to prevent him from crossing the Rhine. Like the ''Rosengarten'', Dietrich is featured fighting Siegfried, but he plays no larger role in the epic.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|pp=180-181}}

==== Jüngeres Hildebrandslied====
{{main|Jüngeres Hildebrandslied}}
The ''Jüngeres Hildebrandslied'' ("Younger Lay of Hildebrand") is a fifteenth-century heroic [[ballad]], much like ''Ermenrichs Tod''. Dietrich plays only a small role in this poem; it is an independent version of the same story found in the Old High German ''Hildebrandslied'', but with a happy ending.

==== Ermenrichs Tod====
{{Main|Ermenrichs Tod}}

''Ermenrichs Tod'' ("The Death of Ermenrich") is a garbled [[Middle Low German]] heroic ballad that relates a version of the death of Ermenrich that is similar in some ways to that portrayed in the story of [[Jonakr's sons]] and [[Svanhild]], but at the hands of Dietrich and his men.

== Heldenbücher==
[[File:Heldenbuch.1590.Titel.jpg|thumb|Title page of the 1590 edition of the ''Heldenbuch''. The text describes the ''Rosengarten zu Worms'']]
{{main|Heldenbuch}}
The Heldenbücher ("Books of Heroes", singular ''Heldenbuch'') are collections of mainly heroic poems, in which those of the Dietrich cycle form a major constituent. In particular, the printed Heldenbücher, dating from the late 15th to the late 16th centuries, demonstrate the continuing appeal of the Dietrich tales, particularly the fantastical poems.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|pp=44-45}} Generally, the printed Heldenbücher show a tendency to reduce the texts of the poems they collect in length: none of the longest Dietrich poems (''Dietrichs Flucht'', ''Die Rabenschlacht'', ''Virginal'' V&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;) made the transition into print.{{sfn|Hoffmann|1974|p=203}} Other longer Dietrich poems, such as the ''Sigenot'' and the ''Eckenlied'', were printed independently, and remained popular even longer than the ''Heldenbuch''—the last printing of ''Sigenot'' was in 1661!{{sfn|Millet|2008|p=420}}

Although not a ''Heldenbuch'' in the sense described above—the term originally included any collection of older literature—the Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] was responsible for the creation of one of the most expensive and historically important manuscripts containing heroic poetry, the [[Ambraser Heldenbuch]].{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|pp=45}}

=== Heldenbuch-Prosa  ===
According to the Heldenbuch-Prosa, a prose preface to the manuscript Heldenbuch of Diebolt von Hanowe from 1480 and found in most printed versions, Dietrich is the grandson of [[Wolfdietrich]] and son of Dietmar. During her pregnancy, Dietrich's mother was visited by the [[demon]] Machmet (i.e. [[Mohammed]] imagined as a [[Muslim]] god), who prophecies that Dietrich will be the strongest spirit who ever lived and will breathe fire when angry. The devil (Machmet?) then builds Verona/Bern in three days.&lt;ref&gt;Heinzle, ''Einführung'', 46-47&lt;/ref&gt; Ermenrich, here imagined as Dietrich's brother, rapes his [[marshal]] Sibiche's wife, whereupon Sibiche decides to advise Ermenrich to his own destruction. Thus he advises Ermenrich to hang his own nephews. Their ward, Eckehart of [[Breisach]], informs Dietrich, and Dietrich declares war on Ermenrich. Ermenrich, however, captures Dietrich's best men, and to ransom them, Dietrich goes into exile. He ends up at Etzel's court, who gives Dietrich a large army that reconquers Verona. However, once Dietrich had fought at the rose garden against [[Sigurd|Siegfried]], slaying him. This causes [[Kriemhild]], who after Etzel's wife Herche's death, marries the Hun, to invite all the heroes of the world to a feast where she causes them to kill each other. Dietrich kills Kriemhild in revenge. Later there is a massive battle at Verona, in which all the remaining heroes except Dietrich are killed.&lt;ref&gt;Heinzle, ''Einführung'', 47&lt;/ref&gt; At this a dwarf appears to Dietrich and, telling him that "his kingdom is no longer of this world," causes him to disappear. And no one knows what has happened to him.&lt;ref name="Heinzle, Einführung, 48"&gt;Heinzle, ''Einführung'', 48&lt;/ref&gt;

The attempts to connect the heroic age with divine order and to remove Dietrich's demonic qualities are probably meant to deflect ecclesiastical criticism of heroic poetry. For instance, the author clearly attempts to hide negative characteristics of Dietrich, as with the Machmet-prophesy, which probably rests on the idea of Dietrich as the son of the devil (as claimed by some in the church) and changing Dietrich's ride to hell into a positive event – the dwarf quotes John 18,36 when he takes Dietrich away.&lt;ref name="Heinzle, Einführung, 48"/&gt;

==Scandinavian works ==
===The Poetic Edda===
Dietrich, as Thiodrek (Þjódrekr), appears as an exile at the court of Atli (the Norse equivalent of Etzel) in two songs recorded in the so-called [[Poetic Edda]]. The most notable of these is [[Guðrúnarkviða III]], in which [[Gudrun]]—the [[Old Norse]] equivalent of the German Krimehilt—is accused of adultery with Thiodrek by one of Atli's concubines, Herkja. Gudrun must  perform an [[Trial by ordeal|ordeal]] of hot water, in which she clears her name. After this, Herkja is killed. In [[Guðrúnarkviða II]], Thiodrek and Gudrun recount the misfortunes that have befallen them.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|p=35-36}}  Thiodrek's presence in both songs is usually interpreted as coming from the influence of German traditions about Dietrich.{{sfn|Millet|2008|p=305}} Herkja's name is an exact linguistic equivalent of the name of Etzel's first wife in the German Dietrich and Nibelungen cycle, Helche.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|p=37}} The poems also include the figure of Gudrun's mother, Grimhild, whose name is the linguistic equivalent of the German Kriemhilt and who takes on the latter's more villainous role.{{sfn|Millet|2008|pp=305-306}} Most likely these two poems only date to the thirteenth century.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|p=37}}

=== Thidrekssaga ===
[[File:Didriks Saga.jpg|thumb|Thidrekssaga, Holm perg 4 fol, bl. 11v.]]
{{main|Þiðreks saga}}
The Scandinavian ''Þiðreks saga'' (also ''Þiðrekssaga'', ''Thidreksaga'', ''Thidrekssaga'', ''Niflunga saga'' or ''Vilkina saga'') is a thirteenth-century [[Old Norse]] [[chivalric saga]] about Dietrich von Bern&lt;ref name="nationalencyklopedin"&gt;The article ''Didrik av Bern'' in ''[[Nationalencyklopedin]]'' (1990).&lt;/ref&gt;. The earliest manuscript dates from the late 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;Helgi Þorláksson, 'The Fantastic Fourteenth Century', in ''The Fantastic in Old Norse/Icelandic Literature; Sagas and the British Isles: Preprint Papers of the Thirteenth International Saga Conference, Durham and York, 6th–12th August, 2006'', ed. by John McKinnell, David Ashurst and Donata Kick (Durham: Centre for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, Durham University, 2006), http://www.dur.ac.uk/medieval.www/sagaconf/sagapps.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; It contains many narratives found in the known poems about Dietrich, but also supplements them with other narratives and provides many additional details. The text is either a translation of a lost [[Low German]] prose narrative of Dietrich's life, or a compilation by a Norwegian author of German material. It is not clear how much of the source material might have been orally transmitted and how much the author may have had access to written poems. The preface of the text itself says that it was written according to "tales of German men" and "old German [[poetry]]", possibly transmitted by [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] merchants in [[Bergen]].&lt;ref name="nationalencyklopedin"/&gt;

At the center of the Thidrekssaga is a complete life of Dietrich. In addition to the life of Dietrich, various other heroes' lives are recounted as well in various parts of the story, including [[Attila the Hun|Attila]], [[Wayland the Smith]], [[Sigurd]], the [[Nibelungen]], and [[Walter of Aquitaine]]. The section recounting Dietrich's avenging of Hertnit seems to have resulted from a confusion between Dietrich and the similarly named [[Wolfdietrich]].

Most of the action of the saga has been relocated to [[Northern Germany]], with Attila's capital at Susat ([[Soest, Germany|Soest]] in [[Westphalia]]) and the battle described in ''Die Rabenschlacht'' taking place at the [[river mouth|mouth]] of the [[Rhine]].

=== Ballads ===
[[File:Dietrich fängt den Zwerg Alfrich by Johannes Gehrts.jpg|thumb|''Dietrich Catches the Dwarf Alfrich'' (1883), by [[Johannes Gehrts]]]]
Numerous ballads about Dietrich are attested in [[Scandinavia]], primarily in [[Denmark]], but also in [[Sweden]] and the [[Faroes]].&lt;ref name="Grundtvig"&gt;Svend Grundtvig, Danmarks Gamle Folkeviser, vol. 1, 1853&lt;/ref&gt; These texts seem to derive primarily from the Thidrekssaga, but there are signs of the use of German texts, such as the Laurin,&lt;ref&gt;Heinzle, ''Einführung'', 56&lt;/ref&gt; which was translated into Danish, probably in the 1400s.&lt;ref&gt;http://middelaldertekster.dk/dvaergekongen-laurin/about#K47&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most notable of the Danish ballads is ''Kong Diderik og hans Kæmper'' (King Dietrich and his Warriors, [[Danmarks gamle Folkeviser|DgF]] 7) which is attested from the 16th century onwards, and is one of the most common ballads to be recorded in Danish songbooks.&lt;ref name="top18"&gt;http://duds.nordisk.ku.dk/tekstresurser/aeldste_danske_viseoverlevering/visernes_top-18/&lt;/ref&gt; This is actually most often found in both Danish and Swedish sources as two separate ballads with different refrains; the two ballads tell stories that closely, but not exactly, mirror episodes in the Didrik Saga where Didrik and his warriors travel to Bertanea / Birtingsland to fight against a King Ysung / Isingen.&lt;ref name="Grundtvig" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. I. Arwidsson, ''[[Svenska Fornsånger]]'', 1834-1842&lt;/ref&gt; The first ballad, known in Swedish as ''Widrik Werlandssons Kamp med Högben Rese'' (Widrik Werlandsson's Fight with the Long-legged Troll, [[Sveriges Medeltida Ballader|SMB]] 211, [[The Types of the Scandinavian Medieval Ballad|TSB]] E&amp;nbsp;119), tells of the journey to Birtingsland, and a fight with a troll in a forest on the way. The second, known in Swedish as ''Tolv Starka Kämpar'' (Twelve Strong Warriors, SMB 198, TSB E&amp;nbsp;10) tells of a series of duels between the youngest of Didrik's warriors and the formidable Sivard (Sigurd).

The Danish ballad ''Kong Diderik og Løven'' (King Didrik and the Lion, DgF 9, TSB E&amp;nbsp;158) for most of its narrative closely follows an episode from near the end of the Didrik Saga, telling how Didrik intervenes in a fight between a lion and a dragon.&lt;ref name="Grundtvig" /&gt; This was also one of the most common ballads to be recorded in Danish songbooks; it is not preserved in Swedish sources.&lt;ref name="top18" /&gt;

Another Danish ballad, ''Kong Diderik i Birtingsland'' (King Dietrich in Birtingsland, DgF 8, TSB E&amp;nbsp;7), is related to ''Kong Diderik og hans Kæmper'', but it follows the Didrik Saga less closely.&lt;ref name="Grundtvig" /&gt;

== Reception ==
===Medieval and early modern reception===
[[File:Runkelstein Castle 22.jpg|thumb|Fresco of Dietrich, Siegfried, and Dietleib. Runkelstein Castle, near Bozen, South Tyrol, c. 1400.]]
The popularity of stories about Dietrich in Germany is already attested in the ''Annals of Quedlinburg'', which closes its account of Theoderic's life by saying that this is ''Thideric de Berne, de quo cantabant rustici olim'' (Dietrich von Bern, of whom the peasants once sung).{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|p=19}} Despite the statement here and in later reports about the popularity of the heroic tradition that it was peasants that sang of Dietrich, it is clear that the nobility was also deeply involved in the transmission of Dietrich's legend.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|p=20}} This can be shown as early as 1064, when Meinhard of Bamberg wrote a letter complaining, perhaps in jest, that bishop Gunther of Bamberg preferred to study the deeds of the [[Amali dynasty|Amelung]] (that is, Dietrich) and Attila rather than Saint Augustine or Gregory the Great.{{sfn|Lienert|2008|p=67}} The chronicler Dietrich von Deutz, writing around 1163, instead reports that Dietrich, Etzel, and Ermenrich are the kings of the Goths whose deeds ''orbe toto declamantur'' (are sung of by the whole world).{{sfn|Lienert|2008|pp=82-83}} High medieval courtly literature includes frequent allusions to Dietrich and the stories surrounding him by authors such as [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]], [[Heinrich von Veldeke]], and [[Eilhart von Oberg]].{{sfn|Lienert|2008|pp=85, 86, 96}} By the end of the thirteenth century, vernacular chronicles, romances, and topical poems of praise often make comparisons of the ferocity of noble warriors with Dietrich and his men.{{sfn|Lienert|2008|pp=138, 140 148-151, 162-163}} The quality of the surviving late medieval manuscripts and the choice to decorate castle rooms with scenes from the poems all point to a noble audience, even though there are also reports of the poems being read or sung at town fairs and in taverns.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|p=31}} [[Froben Christoph von Zimmern]] reports in the [[Zimmern Chronicle]] (c. 1552) that his uncle [[Gottfried Werner von Zimmern]], who decorated his castle [[Wildenstein Castle (Leibertingen)|Wildenstein]] with frescoes from the poem ''[[Sigenot]]'', actually composed poems about Dietrich himself: "under der zech macht er reimen von dem Berner und den risen" (while drinking he made rhymes about the Berner (Dietrich) and the giants).{{sfn|Lienert|2008|pp=236-237}} The Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]]'s interest in heroic poetry about Dietrich is well documented. Not only was he responsible for the Ambraser Heldenbuch, he also decorated his planned grave monument with a large statue of Dietrich/Theoderic, next to other figures such as King Arthur.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|p=31}}

[[Image:Theoderich (Vischer).JPG|thumb|right|150px|Bronze statue of Theoderic the Great ([[Peter Vischer]], 1512–13), from the monument of Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] in the [[Hofkirche, Innsbruck|Court Church at Innsbruck]].]]
Although the nobility maintained its interest in heroic poetry into the sixteenth century, it is also clear that the growing urban bourgeoisie of the late middle ages formed a growing part of the audience for the Dietrich poems, likely in imitation of the nobility.{{sfn|Millet|2008|p=415}}{{sfn|Millet|2008|p=422}} Heroic ballads such as ''Ermenrichs Tod'', meanwhile, lost much of their noble associations and were popular in all societal classes.{{sfn|Millet|2008|p=472}} Beginning in the fourteenth century, many of the Dietrich poems were also used as sources for carnival plays with an obviously bourgeois audience.{{sfn|Millet|2008|pp=477-478}} In the sixteenth century, the public for the poems seems to have become primarily bourgeois, and printed ''Heldenbücher'' rather than the oral tradition become the primary point of reference for the poems.{{sfn|Millet|2008|pp=483-484}} The poems that had not been printed were no longer read and were forgotten.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|p=195}} Among the inhabitants of Tyrol, we know from an inventory held of all books in 1569 to weed out heretical material that printings of ''Sigenot'', the ''Eckenlied'', and ''Laurin'', but not of the more expensive ''Heldenbuch'', were relatively common among the burgeois of that area, in some cases being the only book a person owned.{{sfn|Flood|1987}} The ''Sigenot'' continued to be printed in the seventeenth century, the ''Jüngeres Hildebrandslied'' into the eighteenth, however, most of the printings of materials about Dietrich had ceased by 1600. Nineteenth- and twentieth-century folklorists were unable to find any living oral songs about Dietrich or other heroes in Germany as they could in some other countries, meaning that the oral tradition must have died before this point.{{sfn|Millet|2008|p=492}}

Despite, or because of, its popularity among many sectors of society, including members of the church, the Dietrich poems were frequent targets of  criticism, something already visible in Meinhard's letter mentioned above.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|p=20}} Beginning with [[Frutolf of Michelsberg]]'s ''Würzburg Chronicle'' (eleventh century), writers of chronicles began to notice and object to the chronology of Dietrich/Theoderic being a contemporary of Ermanaric and Attila.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|p=21}} The anonymous author of the German ''[[Kaiserchronik]]'' (c.1150) vehemently attacks this chronological impossibility as a lie. His insistence is perhaps a reflection of the popularity of these stories among his target audience.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|pp=22}} Eventually, even the fantastical poems would come under attack: the Alsatian chronicler [[Jakob Twinger von Königshofen]] in his ''Strasbourg Chronicle'' (c. 1400) would refer to the events of these poems as lies as well, without mentioning the historical poems. He also attacks the laity's positive opinion about the heretical Theoderic.{{sfn|Lienert|2008|pp=168-169}} Preachers and the didactically inclined also frequently attack the laity's attachment to Dietrich: [[Bertold of Regensburg]], in a sermon from around 1250, attacks heretics for being illiterate and able only to memorize in the manner that one memorizes a ''rumorem de Ditrico'' (unverified story about Dietrich){{sfn|Lienert|2008|p=122}}. [[Hugo von Trimberg]], meanwhile, in his didactic poem ''Der Renner'' (c. 1300) accuses some women of crying more for Dietrich and Ecke than for Christ's wounds, while a fifteenth-century work complains that the laypeople think more about Dietrich von Bern than their own salvation.{{sfn|Jones|1952|p=1096}} In the sixteenth century, despite continued criticism, there is evidence that preachers, including [[Martin Luther]], frequently used stories about Dietrich von Bern as a way to catch their audience's interest, a not uncontroversial practice.{{sfn|Flood|1967}} Writers from [[Heinrich Wittenwiler]] to the German translator of [[Friedrich Dedekind]]'s ''Grobianus'' associated the poems with uncouth peasants, whether or not they actually formed part of the poems' audiences.{{sfn|Jones|1952}}

=== Modern reception ===
Scholarly reception of the Dietrich poems, in the form of the ''Heldenbuch'' began as early as the sixteenth century. The [[Baroque]] poets and scholars [[Martin Opitz]] and [[Melchior Goldast]] made use of the ''Heldenbuch'' as a convenient source of Middle High German expressions and vocabulary in their editions of medieval texts.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|p=195}} Another notable example is the Lutheran theologian and historian Cyriacus von Spangenberg. In his ''Mansfeldische Chronik'' (1572), he explained that songs had about Dietrich/Theoderic had been composed for real historical occasions, so that they might not be forgotten, but clothed in allegory. He based this opinion on the report of [[Tacitus]] in [[Germania (book)|''Germania'']] that the ancient Germans only recorded their history in songs. In Spangenberg's interpretation, dwarf king Laurin's [[cloak of invisibility]], for instance, becomes a symbol for Laurin's secrecy and sneakiness.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|pp=196-197}} In his ''Adels Spiegel'' (printed 1591-1594), Cyriacus interprets the stories about Dietrich as examples for ideal noble behavior, and continues his allegorical interpretations, stating that the dragons and giants represent tyrants, robbers, etc., while the dwarfs represent the peasantry and bourgeoisie, etc.{{sfn|Millet|2008|pp=491-492}} This tradition of interpretation would continue into the eighteenth century, when [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] interprets the poems of the ''Heldenbuch'' in a very similar fashion, and as late as 1795 Johann Friedrich Schütze argued that the poems were allegories for medieval historical events.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|p=197}}

[[File:Bozen Laurin.jpg|thumb|Fountain in [[Bolzano]] depicting Dietrich fighting Laurin]]
The medieval poems about Dietrich never attained the same status as the ''Nibelungenlied'' among nineteenth-century enthusiasts for the German past, despite repeated attempts to reanimate the material through reworkings and retellings. The most ambitious of these was by [[Karl Simrock]], the translator of the ''Nibelungenlied'', who sought to write a new German epic, composed in the "Nibelungenstanza", based on the ''Thidrekssaga'' and select poems of the Dietrich cyclce. He called his project the ''Amelungenlied'' (song of the Amelungs). Despite a warm reception among connoisseurs, the poem was never popular. The poem remains unpopular and unknown today, at least partially due to its strong nationalistic tone.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|pp=198-199}}

Of all the Dietrich poems, the ''Laurin'' was most frequently rewritten and reimagined during the nineteenth-century, and it is the poem with the greatest currency today. The reworkings, which included longer poems and pieces for the theater, frequently connected ''Laurin'' to elements of other Dietrich poems, especially the ''Virginal''.{{sfn|Altaner|1912|pp=68-78}} This led to the ''Laurin'', together with the reimagined ''Virginal'', attaining something of the status of folktales in Tyrol and South Tyrol. Writing in the preface to their 1963 retelling of several stories about Dietrich, Ruth Sawyer and Emmy Mollès claim:
:"Today the stories of Dietrich and King Laurin are the favorites of the boys and girls of the Austrian Tirol; and the grandmothers like best to tell them. Many a shepherd or farmer on the foothills will tell you they have seen King Laurin on a summer day, gamboling with their sheep or goats; or a farmer will say he has come to help him gather in his grain at harvest time. Many say they have seen Dietrich, mounted on his black, clad in full armor, his shield bearing the famous device of a Red Lion. Sometimes a radiant figure on a white stallion rides at his side. So Dietrich still lives among the mountain people."{{sfn|Sawyer|Mollès|1963|p=8}}

Much of the credit for the continued interest in Dietrich and Laurin in Tyrol can be given to the journalist and saga-researcher [[Karl Felix Wolff]].{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|p=163}} In 1907, the city of [[Bozen]] (Bolzano) in South Tyrol erected a Laurin fountain, depicting Dietrich wrestling Laurin to the ground. It can be seen there to this day.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|pp=162}} A heavily altered version of the story of Laurin and Dietrich even found its way onto film in 2016, with the release of the children's film ''König Laurin''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4635004/?ref_=ttrel_rel_tt|title=König Laurin (2016)|website=IMDb|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Leonardo®''''' is a [[peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] published by the [[MIT Press]] covering the application of contemporary science and technology to the arts and music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mitpressjournals.org/page/about/leon About ''Leonardo'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Leonardo journal was established in 1968 by artist and scientist [[Frank Malina]] in [[Paris]], [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leonardo.info/isast/leostory.html History of ''Leonardo'']&lt;/ref&gt; ''Leonardo'' has published writings by artists who work with science- and technology-based art media for 50 years. Journal operations were moved to the [[San Francisco Bay]] Area by Frank's son [[Roger Malina]], an astronomer and space scientist, who took over operations of the journal upon Frank Malina's death in 1981. In 1982, the International Society for the Arts Sciences and Technology ([[Leonardo, The International Society of the Arts, Sciences and Technology|Leonardo/ISAST]]) was founded to further the aims of ''Leonardo'' by providing avenues of communication for artists working in contemporary media. The society also publishes ''[[Leonardo Music Journal]]'', the ''[[Leonardo Electronic Almanac]]'', ''[[Leonardo Reviews]]'', and the ''[[Leonardo Book Series]]''. All publications are produced in collaboration with the [[MIT Press]].

Other activities of the organization include an awards program and participation in annual conferences and symposiums such as the Space and the Arts Workshop and the annual College Art Association conference. Leonardo has a sister organization in France, the Association Leonardo, that publishes the ''Observatoire Leonardo'' website. While encouraging the innovative presentation of technology-based arts, the society also functions as an international meeting place for artists, educators, students, scientists and others interested in the use of new media in contemporary artistic expression.

The aims of the organization include the documentation of personal and innovative technologies developed by artists, similar to the way in which findings of scientists are documented in journal publications.&lt;ref&gt;Leonardo de Cardoso: ''Visual Music: An Ethnography of an Experimental Art in Los Angeles'', Master's Thesis, University of Texas at Austin, May 2010, [http://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/ETD-UT-2010-05-1228/CARDOSO-MASTERS-REPORT.pdf#page=47 p. 39]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frank Weston Benson]] made '''Waterscapes''' in oil, watercolor, ink, pencil and created etchings. He also made portraits, landscapes, wildlife, interiors and other works of art.

''Salem Harbor'' was Benson's first [[etching]], made while he was at the [[School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]&lt;ref name=PEMTimeline&gt;[[#PEMTimeline|Peabody Essex Museum, Interactive Presentation, Benson Timeline.]]&lt;/ref&gt; and published in the school's magazine "Students in the School of Drawing". Benson was one of the editors of the magazine. Thirty years later, in 1912, Benson began etching again, a practice that thereafter became a major body of his work.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Paff17|Benson, Paff (1917)]], 28&lt;/ref&gt; Two plates were made of ''The Anchorage'' that depicted a fisherman bringing a dory to shore. The first resulted in 48 proofs on shogun paper, 43 of which were signed. The second plate was more spacious than the first and resulted in 25 signed proofs printed on shogun paper. The work was exhibited in 1915 and 1916 four times.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Paff19|Benson, Paff (1919)]], 89.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Casting for Salmon'' is one of Benson's 359 etchings, most of which were made of [[waterfowl]]. In the simple composition of a fisherman reflected influence by Japanese artists and demonstrated his skill as an etcher.&lt;ref name=PEMTimeline/&gt;

Benson declared ''Calm Morning'' of his three oldest children his "best out of door work." In this case Benson was deliberate in his approach, he made three oil studies before making the final painting; Generally he started and finished he outdoor paintings on one canvas. From left to right, Eleanor, Elisabeth and George fished over the side of a boat off in the waters of their summer home in [[Maine]]. Benson was masterful in capturing the reflection of the boat on the water and the deeper color of its shadow. The vivid, luminous colors give depict the sun shining upon the children.&lt;ref&gt;[[#BMA|''Calm Morning'', Boston Museum of Art.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Over Benson's career he painted more than 600 [[Watercolor painting|watercolors]], like ''Camp'' (or ''Salmon Fishing'') that he made during a salmon fishing trip in [[Canada]] with his son, George.&lt;ref name=PEMTimeline/&gt;

Dating to c. 1420–1435, it is currently housed in the [[Castelvecchio Museum]] in [[Verona]], northern Italy.

==Description==
The [[tempera]] on panel painting shows the traditional theme of the [[Madonna (art)|Madonna with Child]] within an enclosure of roses, a ''[[hortus conclusus]]'', symbol of her virginity, in the presence of [[St. Catherine of Alexandria]]. The latter, as a princess, is crowned, and is accompanied by her martyrdom attribute of the [[breaking wheel|torture wheel]]. There are also numerous slender angels. They are performing a series of activities: reading (a hint to the [[religious text]]s), collecting petals of rose, playing near a Gothic [[Baptismal font|font]] (symbolizing the definition of Mary as ''Fons gratiae'', "Spring of Grace").

Two peacocks are roaming in the garden: they are a symbol of the immortality of Christ since early Christian times, when their flesh was considered not liable to rot. 

The work has been attributed to both [[Stefano da Verona]] or [[Michelino da Besozzo]], with more recent scholars tending to favor the latter.

[[File:Sign .jpg|thumb|300x300px]]
The '''Millay Colony for the Arts''' is an arts community offering residency-retreats and workshops in [[Austerlitz, New York]], and free arts programs in local public schools. Housed on the former property of [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning feminist/activist poet and playwright [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]], the Colony's campus offers artists, students, and art lovers residencies, retreats, and classes.


==History==
[[File:MillayColonyBarn.jpg|thumb]] In 1925, Edna St. Vincent Millay bought ''[[Steepletop]]'', a house with a blueberry farm in Austerlitz, NY, named after a pink, conical [[wildflower]] that grows there.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'', May 16, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; With her husband, Millay built a barn from a [[Sears|Sears Roebuck]] kit, and then a writing cabin, and a tennis court.  

After the poet's death in 1950, her sister [[Norma Millay Ellis]] moved to Steepletop. In 1973, she founded The Millay Colony, which was established as a nonprofit organization.&lt;ref&gt;"Millay Farm Becoming an Arts Colony," The New York Times, February 20, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; Norma Millay Ellis donated the barn and surrounding acreage to The Millay Colony. The barn was subsequently renovated to provide accommodations and studio space for four resident artists. 

In the mid-1990s, The Millay Colony commissioned architectural firm [http://www.michaelsinger.com/project/millay-colony-for-the-arts/ Michael Singer Studio], in consultation with an advisory committee of six artists with disabilities, to design an additional building for the Colony using the principles of universal access and environmentally friendly design.&lt;ref&gt;"An Artists' Retreat Is Extending Its Welcome," New York Times, October 3, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;  

This 3,550 square foot building currently houses The Millay Colony's offices and public rooms, and provides accommodations and studio space for three additional artists, for a total capacity of seven. 

The Colony is adjacent to [[Steepletop]], Edna St. Vincent Millay's former home and gardens, which today are maintained by the [http://www.millay.org/ Millay Society] (established as a nonprofit in 1972). The Millay Society also holds rights to the poet's intellectual property and operates as a separate organization from The Millay Colony. The house and gardens are a [[National Historic Landmark]].

==Arts Education==
The Millay Colony offers Workshop Retreats, formulated and taught by artists with a commitment to teaching. These affordable, multi-day classes, held on The Millay Colony's campus, invite artists at all stages of their career to develop new work while engaging with other artists.

Concurrently, the Colony offers a multiform program of arts education to more than 500 public school children in four local school districts each year, as well as professional development/teacher training on using the arts across disciplines for local teachers.

==Residencies==
The Millay Colony offers residencies to emerging and established visual artists, writers, and composers—individually and in collaborating groups – from April to November. These artists and groups receive private bedrooms and private studios as well as all meals and access to the Colony's libraries, darkroom, music room and the natural resources on the campus adjacent Harvey Mountain State Forest.

October 1 is the date to apply for residencies in April to July of the following year.  

March 1 is the date to apply for residencies in August to November of the same year. 

All residencies are reviewed anonymously by juries of artists, critics and curators.  The Colony hosts over 60 residents per year.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2904">'''Monochromatic colors''' are all the colors (tones, [[tints and shades]] ) of a single [[hue]]. [[File:CPT-Websites-monochrome.svg|frame|Example of a monochromatic color scheme]]
Monochromatic color schemes are derived from a single base hue and extended using its shades, tones and tints. Tints are achieved by adding white and shades and tones are achieved by adding a darker color, grey or black.

Monochromatic color schemes provide opportunities in art and visual communications design as they allow for a greater range of contrasting tones that can be used to attract attention, create focus and support legibility.

The use of a monochromatic color provides a strong sense of visual cohesion and can help support communication objectives through the use of connotative color. The relative absence of hue contrast can be offset by variations in tone and the addition of texture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Connor|first1=Z.|title=Colour Combination Techniques|date=2014|publisher=Design Research Associates|location=Sydney AUS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monochromatic in science means consisting of a single wavelength of light or other radiation (lasers, for example, usually produce monochromatic light), or having or appearing to have only one color (in comparison to polychromatic). That means according to science the true monochromatic images can be strictly created only of shades of one color fading to black.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = the definition of monochromatic|url = http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/monochromatic|website = Dictionary.com|access-date = 2016-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, monochromatic also has another meaning similar to “boring” or “colorless” which sometimes leads to creating a design composed from true monochromatic color shades (one hue fading to black), and the colors created from the one hue but faded to all wavelengths (to white). This is not monochromatic in the strictly scientific meaning of the word.

== Recommends for CUD  ==
It is also be recommended to use monochromatic color for [[Color Universal Design]] (CUD).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Web |url=http://jfly.iam.u-tokyo.ac.jp/color/ |title=Color Universal Design (CUD) - How to make figures and presentations that are friendly to Colorblind people - |access-date=2018-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; An image with enough [[contrast ratio]] monochromatic color also compatible with [[color blindness]] people.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3297">'''Monroe Curtis Beardsley''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɪər|d|z|l|i}}; December 10, 1915&amp;nbsp;– September 18, 1985) was an [[American philosopher]] of art.

==Biography==
Beardsley was born and raised in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]], and educated at [[Yale University]] (B.A. 1936, Ph.D. 1939), where he received the [[John Addison Porter]] Prize. He taught at a number of colleges and universities, including [[Mount Holyoke College]] and Yale University, but most of his career was spent at [[Swarthmore College]] (22 years) and [[Temple University]] (16 years). His wife and occasional coauthor, Elizabeth Lane Beardsley, was also a philosopher at Temple.

His work in [[aesthetics]] is best known for its championing of the [[instrumentalism|instrumentalist]] theory of art and the concept of aesthetic experience. Beardsley was elected president of the American Society for Aesthetics in 1956. He also wrote an introductory text on aesthetics and edited a well-regarded survey anthology of philosophy.

Among [[Literary criticism|literary critics]], Beardsley is known for two essays written with [[William Kurtz Wimsatt, Jr.|W.K. Wimsatt]], "The [[Intentional Fallacy]]" and "The Affective Fallacy," both key texts of [[New Criticism]].  His works also include: ''Practical Logic'' (1950), ''Aesthetics'' (1958), and ''Aesthetics: A Short History'' (1966). He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1976.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=May 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He and his wife were over-all series editors for Prentice-Hall's "Foundations of Philosophy," a series of textbooks on different fields within philosophy, written in most cases by leading scholars in those fields.

The '''National Theater''' ({{lang-de|'''Nationaltheater'''}}) on [[Max-Joseph-Platz]] in [[Munich]], Germany, is a historic opera house, home of the [[Bavarian State Opera]], [[Bavarian State Orchestra]] and the [[Bayerisches Staatsballett|Bavarian State Ballet]]. 

== Building ==

===First theatre – 1818 to 1823===
The first theatre was commissioned in 1810 by King [[Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria|Maximilian I]] of Bavaria because the nearby [[Cuvilliés Theatre]] had too little space. It was designed by [[Karl von Fischer]], with the 1782 [[Odéon]] in [[Paris]] as architectural precedent.&lt;ref name=focus /&gt; Construction began on 26 October 1811 but was interrupted in 1813 by financing problems.&lt;ref name=history /&gt; In 1817 a fire occurred in the unfinished building.

The new theatre finally opened on 12 October 1818 with a performance of ''Die Weihe'' by [[Ferdinand Fränzl]], but was soon destroyed by another fire on 14 January 1823;&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web |last= |first= |date= |title=History of the Bayerische Staatsoper |url=https://www.staatsoper.de/en/staatsoper/history/bayerische-staatsoper.html |work= |location= |access-date=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the stage décor caught fire during a performance of ''Die beyden Füchse'' by [[Étienne Méhul]] and the fire could not be put out because the water supply was frozen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |date=1823 |title=Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung, Band 25 |url= |location=Leipzig |publisher=Breitkopf und Härtel |page=79 |isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Görl |first=Wolfgang  |date=1 April 2016 |title=Auch Bier kann den Brand löschen |url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/muenchen/sz-serie-feuer-flamme-teil-auch-bier-kann-den-brand-loeschen-1.2930404 |work=[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]] |location=Munich |language=German |access-date=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coincidentally the Paris Odéon itself burned down in 1818.

===Second theatre – 1825 to 1943===
Designed by [[Leo von Klenze]], the second theater incorporated [[Neo-Grec]] features in its portico and triangular pediment and an entrance supported by [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] columns. In 1925 it was modified to create an enlarged stage area with updated equipment. The building was gutted in an air raid on the night of 3 October 1943.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

===Third theatre – 1963 to present===
The third and present theatre (1963) recreates Karl von Fischer's original neo-classical design, though on a slightly larger, 2,100-seat scale.&lt;ref name=focus&gt;{{cite news |last=Schönbauer |first=Sina |date=15 June 2016 |title=Die Bayerische Staatsoper ist die drittgrößte Bühne Europas |url=http://www.focus.de/regional/muenchen/das-nationaltheater-in-muenchen-bayerische-staatsoper-die-drittgroesste-buehne-europas_id_3791523.html |work=[[Focus (German magazine)|Focus]] |location= |language=German |access-date=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magnificent royal [[box (theatre)|box]] is the center of the interior rondel, decorated with two large [[caryatid]]s. The new stage covers {{convert|2500|m2|sqyd}}, and is thus the world's third largest, after the [[Opéra Bastille]] in Paris and the [[Grand Theatre, Warsaw]].&lt;ref name=focus /&gt;

Through the consistent use of wood as a building material, the auditorium has excellent acoustics. Architect [[Gerhard Moritz Graubner]] closely preserved the original look of the foyer and main staircase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Abendroth |first=Walter |date=23 February 1956 |title=Wie soll das neue Nationaltheater aussehen? |url=http://www.zeit.de/1956/08/wie-soll-das-neue-nationaltheater-aussehen |work=[[Die Zeit]] |location=Hamburg |language=German |access-date=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It opened on 21 November 1963 with an invitation-only performance of ''[[Die Frau ohne Schatten]]'' under the baton of [[Joseph Keilberth]].&lt;ref name=zeit&gt;{{cite news |last=Abendroth |first=Walter |date=29 November 1963 |title=272 Scheinwerfer im Nationaltheater |url=http://www.zeit.de/1963/48/272-scheinwerfer-im-nationaltheater |work=[[Die Zeit]] |location=Hamburg |language=German |access-date=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two nights later came the first public performance, of ''[[Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg]]'', again under Keilberth.&lt;ref name=zeit /&gt;

== Music ==
During its early years, the National Theatre saw the premières of a significant number of operas, including many by German composers.  These included Wagner’s ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'' (1865), ''Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg'' (1868), ''[[Das Rheingold]]'' (1869) and ''[[Die Walküre]]'' (1870), after which Wagner chose to build the [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus|Festspielhaus]] in [[Bayreuth]] and held further premières of his works there.

During the latter part of the 19th century, it was [[Richard Strauss]] who would make his mark on the theatre in the city in which he was born in 1864.  After accepting the position of conductor for a short time, Strauss returned to the theatre to become principal conductor from 1894 to 1898.  In the pre-War period, his ''[[Friedenstag]]'' (1938) and ''[[Capriccio (opera)|Capriccio]]'' were premièred in Munich. In the post-War period, the house has seen significant productions and many world premieres.

'''Nencatacoa''' or '''Nem-catacoa''' was the [[deity|god]] and protector of the mantle makers, artists and festivities in the [[Muisca religion and mythology|religion of the Muisca]].&lt;ref name=p57/&gt; The [[Muisca people|Muisca]] and their [[Muisca Confederation|confederation]] were one of the four advanced civilizations of the Americas; as much as the [[Aztec]], [[Maya civilization|Mayas]] and [[Inca Empire|Incas]] but other than the other three, they did not construct grand architecture. Their gold working however was well-known and respected which made Nencatacoa an important deity and protector.&lt;ref name=p57/&gt;

== Description ==
[[File:BOG 04 2012 Museo de Oro 1177.JPG|thumb|260px|left|Golden mask in the [[Gold Museum, Bogotá|Museo del Oro]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;Ritual gold mask&lt;/small&gt;]]
Nencatacoa was represented in the form of a forest animal, made of gold and covered with a mantle. Nencatacoa looked most like a fox or a bear,&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://pueblosoriginarios.com/sur/caribe/muisca/nencatacoa.html Description Nencatacoa] – Pueblos Originarios&lt;/ref&gt; because as [[Pedro Simón]] noted, "an animal in that shape would appear multiple times".&lt;ref name=p57/&gt;

He was the protector god of the weavers, an industry that was very important among the [[Muisca people|Muisca]], who used a great variety of materials but mostly cotton and [[fique]].&lt;ref name=p57/&gt;
[[File:Totuma con chicha.png|thumb|right|260px|''[[Chicha]]''; alcoholic drink from fermented maize, main ingredient of the festivities around '''Nencatacoa''']]
Nencatacoa was also the protector of artists and painters who realized their beautiful creations on the cloths, the [[Muisca economy#Ceramics|ceramics]], [[Muisca economy#Gold|gold metallurgy]], [[sculptures]] and [[petroglyph]]s with different [[anthropomorphic]], [[zoomorphic]] and [[ideogram]]atic figures.&lt;ref name=p58&gt;Ocampo López, 2013, Ch. 9, p.58&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, Nencatacoa was the god of festivities, drunkenness and dance. Traditions tell us that he partied with the people without caring about anything else. The Muisca drank ''[[Chicha#Colombia|chicha]]'', a type of alcoholic drink based on the fermentation and cooking of maize. When the indigenous peoples were constructing their houses he helped them with lifting the heavy poles. Even during the construction of their houses (''bohíos'') and temples, the Muisca drank a lot of chicha.&lt;ref name=p58/&gt;

Also to celebrate the completion of temples, houses or roads and with the arrival of new ''[[cacique]]s'' the Muisca drank a lot of ''chicha''. At times of sowing and harvest, they celebrated with dancing, singing, music (with drums and flutes) and honoured the gods, in particular Nencatacoa.&lt;ref name=p60&gt;Ocampo López, 2013, Ch. 9, p.60&lt;/ref&gt;

Nencatacoa thus appeared to be similar in style and association to the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] god [[Dionysus]] and the [[Roman empire|Roman]] [[Bacchus]]. [[List of Muisca scholars|Chronicler]] Pedro Simón described about the Muisca that when they were partying and dancing around the fire and the wind blew that was a sign that Nencatacoa was participating.&lt;ref name=p60/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15610">The '''non-canonical books referenced in the Bible''' includes [[pseudepigrapha]], writings from [[Hellenistic]] and other non-Biblical cultures, and lost works of known or unknown status. By the "Bible" is meant those books recognised by most Christians and Jews as being part of [[Old Testament]] (or [[Tanakh]]) as well as those recognised by Christians alone as being part of the [[Biblical apocrypha]] or of the [[Deuterocanonical books|Deuterocanon]]. 

It may also include books of the Anagignoskomena ({{section link|Deuterocanonical books|Eastern Orthodoxy}}) that are accepted only by [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox Christians]]. For the purposes of this article, "referenced" can mean direct quotations, paraphrases, or allusions, which in some cases are known only because they have been identified as such by ancient writers, or the citation of a work or author.

== Hebrew Bible ==
{{cleanup|reason=Dead links; please re-link the following external links to currently active, stable pages|date=April 2016}}

The following are mentioned in the [[Hebrew Bible]]:
* The [[Book of Jasher (biblical references)|Book of Jasher]] is mentioned in {{bibleref|Joshua|10:13}} and {{bibleref|2 Samuel|1:18}} and also referenced in {{bibleref|2 Timothy|3:8}}.&lt;ref name="oble lase"&gt;{{Citation|last=oble lase|title=Ancient Book of Jasher/Audio Version|date=2014-12-01|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKxHiZAYUAk|accessdate=2016-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the context in the Book of Samuel, it is implied that it was a collection of poetry. [[Sefer haYashar (disambiguation)|Several books]] have claimed to be this lost text, some of which are discounted as [[pseudepigrapha]]. Certain members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] secured the copyright to a particular English translation of [[Sefer haYashar (midrash)|one of these]] and republished it in 1887 in Salt Lake City.
* The [[Book of the Wars of the Lord]].&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes called ''The Book of the Wars of Yahweh''. One source says "The quotation is in lyrical form, so it is possibly a book of poetry or a hymnal...Moses quoted it, so the date of its composition must have been prior to the completion of the Pentateuch, perhaps during the wanderings in the wilderness. Nothing else is known about it, and it survives only in Moses’ quotation."[http://www.apologeticspress.org/articles/42]&lt;/ref&gt; Referenced at {{bibleref|Numbers|21:14}} with possible association with [[War of the Sons of Light Against the Sons of Darkness]]. The Book of the Wars of the Lord is also cited in the medieval Book of Jasher (trans. Moses Samuel c. 1840, ed. J. H. Parry 1887) Chapter 90:48 as being a collaborative record written by Moses, Joshua and the children of Israel.
* The [[Chronicles of the Kings of Israel]] and [[Chronicles of the Kings of Judah]] are mentioned in the [[Books of Kings]] ({{bibleref|1 Kings|14:19,29}}). They are said to tell of events during the reigns of Kings [[Jeroboam]] of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] and [[Rehoboam]] of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], respectively. The Chronicles of the Kings of Israel is again mentioned in {{bibleref|1 Kings|16:20}} regarding King [[Zimri (king)|Zimri]], and many other times throughout 1 and 2 Kings.
* The "[[Book of Shemaiah the Prophet|Book of Shemaiah]], and of [[Iddo (prophet)|Iddo the Seer]]" (also called [[Story of the Prophet Iddo]] or ''The Annals of the Prophet Iddo'') is mentioned in the [[Books of Chronicles|2nd Book of Chronicles]]. ({{bibleref|2 Chronicles|9:29}}, {{bibleref|2 Chronicles|12:15}}, {{bibleref|2 Chronicles|13:22}}). Iddo was a seer who lived during the reigns of Solomon, Rehoboam, and Abijah. His deeds were recorded in this book, which has been completely lost to history, save for its title. The prophet Zechariah was "the son of Iddo", but this was likely not the same [[Iddo (prophet)|Iddo]]. ({{bibleref|Ezra|5:1}}, {{bibleref|Zechariah|1:1}})
* The Manner of the Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Also called ''The Book of Statutes'' or ''3 Samuel''.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;''Referenced at {{bibleref|1 Samuel|10:25}}''.
* The [[Acts of Solomon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icwseminary.org/lostbooks.htm Also called ''The Book of the Acts of Solomon''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623175757/http://icwseminary.org/lostbooks.htm |date=2006-06-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;''Referenced at {{bibleref|1 Kings|11:41}}''.
* The [[Annals of King David]].&lt;ref&gt;Also called ''The Book of the Annals of King David'' or ''The Chronicles of King David'', which could be a reference to the rest of 1 Chronicles.[http://www.apologeticspress.org/articles/42]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;''Referenced at {{bibleref|1 Chronicles|27:24}}''.
* The [[Book of Samuel the Seer]]. Also called ''Samuel the Seer'' or ''The Acts of Samuel the Seer'', which could be the same as [[Books of Samuel|1 &amp; 2 Samuel]].&lt;ref name="apologeticspress.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apologeticspress.org/apcontent.aspx?category=13&amp;article=66|title=Are There Lost Books of the Bible?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;''Referenced at {{bibleref|1 Chronicles|29:29}}''.
* The [[Book of Nathan the Prophet]]. Also called ''Nathan the Prophet'' or ''The Acts of Nathan the Prophet'' or [[History of Nathan the Prophet]].&lt;ref name="apologeticspress.org"/&gt; &lt;br /&gt;''Referenced at {{bibleref|1 Chronicles|29:29}}, and also {{bibleref|2 Chronicles|9:29}}''.
* The [[Book of Gad the Seer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apologeticspress.org/articles/42 Also called ''Gad the Seer'' or ''The Acts of Gad the Seer'']&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;''Referenced at {{bibleref|1 Chronicles|29:29}}''.
* The [[Prophecy of Ahijah]],&lt;ref&gt;Also called ''The Prophesy of Ahijah the Shilonite'' [http://www.apologeticspress.org/articles/42].&lt;/ref&gt; might be a reference to 1 Kings 14:2–18. &lt;br /&gt;''Referenced at {{bibleref|2 Chronicles|9:29}}''.

It has been speculated that Paul is simply paraphrasing Genesis 2:7, but there is no clear indication that this is not a complete quote.
*An unknown text quoted by Paul in 1 Corinthians 2:9, suggested by Origen to be a lost apocryphal book &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/commentaries/1_corinthians/2-9.htm|title=1 Corinthians 2:9 Commentaries: but just as it is written, "THINGS WHICH EYE HAS NOT SEEN AND EAR HAS NOT HEARD, AND which HAVE NOT ENTERED THE HEART OF MAN, ALL THAT GOD HAS PREPARED FOR THOSE WHO LOVE HIM."|author=|date=|website=biblehub.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;: "But as it is written, 'No eye has seen, no ear has heard, and no mind has imagined the things that God has prepared for those who love him." This may also be an allusion to the similar Isaiah 64:4, "For from days of old they have not heard or perceived by ear, nor has the eye seen a God besides You, Who acts in behalf of the one who waits for Him.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-4.htm|title=Isaiah 64:4 Since ancient times no one has heard, no ear has perceived, no eye has seen any God besides you, who acts on behalf of those who wait for him.|author=|date=|website=biblehub.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

*An unknown messianic prophecy, possibly from a non-canonical source, quoted in Mark 9:12, speculated to be a vague allusion to Isaiah 53: "and how it is written of the Son of man, that he must suffer many things, and be set at nought."

'''Openness''' is an overarching concept or philosophy that is characterized by an emphasis on [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]] and free, unrestricted access to knowledge and [[freedom of information|information]], as well as collaborative or cooperative management and [[decentralized decision-making|decision-making]] rather than a central [[authority]].&lt;ref name=Peters&gt;{{cite web|last=Peters|first=Michael|title=The Idea of Openness: Open Education and Education for Openness|url=http://eepat.net/doku.php?id=open_education_and_education_for_openness|work=The Encyclopaedia of Educational Philosophy and Theory|accessdate=1 May 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.fo/20140501132743/http://eepat.net/doku.php?id=open_education_and_education_for_openness|archivedate=1 May 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Openness can be said to be the opposite of [[secrecy]].&lt;ref name=Peters /&gt;

== In government ==
{{Main article|Open government}}
'''Open government''' is the governing [[doctrine]] which holds that citizens have the right to access the documents and proceedings of the government to allow for effective public [[Regulation|oversight]].&lt;ref name="ruma"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Daniel |editor1-last=Lathrop |editor2-first=Laurel |editor2-last=Ruma |title= Open Government: Transparency, Collaboration and Participation in Practice |publisher= O'Reilly Media |date=February 2010  |url = https://openlibrary.org/books/OL24435672M/Open_Government |isbn= 978-0-596-80435-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Openness in government applies the idea of [[freedom of information]] to information held by authorities and holds that citizens should have the right to see the operations and activities of government at work.&lt;ref name = "Birkinshaw"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Birkinshaw|first=Patrick|title=FREEDOM OF INFORMATION AND OPENNESS: FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS?|journal=Administrative Law Review|volume=58|issue=1|pages=177–218|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?sid=ac4899af-cdac-4b67-8b67-d0f7951e70b3%40sessionmgr115&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=124&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=bth&amp;AN=20477744&amp;anchor=AN0020477744-10|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since reliable information is requisite for accountability, freedom of access to information about the government supports government accountability and helps protect other necessary rights.&lt;ref name = "Birkinshaw"/&gt;

== In education ==
{{Main article|Open education}}
Open education refers to institutional practices and programmatic initiatives that broaden access to the learning and training traditionally offered through formal education systems.  By eliminating [[barriers to entry]], [[open education]] aids freedom of information by increasing accessibility.

Open Education advocates state people from all social classes worldwide have open access to high-quality education and resources. They help eliminate obstacles like high costs, outmoded materials, and legal instruments. These barriers impede collaboration among stakeholders. Cooperation is crucial to open education&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-education|title=What is open education?|work=Opensource.com|access-date=2018-07-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The Open Education Consortium claims “Sharing is a fundamental attribute of education. Education means the sharing of knowledge, insights, and information with everybody. It is the foundation of new wisdom, ideas, talents, and understanding&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oeconsortium.org/|title=The Open Education Consortium {{!}} The Global Network for Open Education|website=www.oeconsortium.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;.”Open Educational Resources refer to learning materials that educators can improve and modify with permission from their publishers or authors. Creators of OERs are allowed to include a variety of items such as lesson plans, presentation slides, lecture videos, podcasts, worksheets, maps, and images&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/access-to-knowledge/open-educational-resources/what-are-open-educational-resources-oers/|title=What are Open Educational Resources (OERs)? {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Open access]] refers to the practice of allowing peer-reviewed research articles to be available online free of charge and free of most copyright and licensing restrictions.&lt;ref name=Suber&gt;{{cite web|last=Suber|first=Peter|title=Open Access Overview|url=http://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/overview.htm|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Benefits of this approach include: accelerated discovery and progress as researchers are free to use and build on the findings of others,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Case for Open Access|url=http://www.plos.org/open-access/|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; giving back to the public as much research is paid for with public funds,&lt;ref name=Suber2&gt;{{cite web|last=Suber|first=Peter|title=The taxpayer argument for open access|url=http://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/newsletter/09-04-03.htm#taxpayer|work=SPARC Open Access Newsletter, issue #65|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and greater impact for one's work due to [[open access]] articles being accessible to a bigger audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harnad|first=Steven|author2=Tim Brody|title=Comparing the Impact of Open Access (OA) vs. Non-OA Articles in the Same Journals|journal=D-Lib Magazine|volume=10|url=http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/260207/1/06harnad.html|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In information technology ==
{{Main article|Code of Openness}}
Openness is a capability provided by an IT system, and it is characterized by interoperability, portability and extensibility. These capabilities are implemented using IT interfaces, standards and the [[Information technology architecture|IT architecture]]. All these are technical aspects of openness. Openness is also based on non-technical aspects, which are related to the partnership between the involved partners (IT customers, IT vendors and/or IT service providers).&lt;ref name="CPO"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Steven|first1=Vettermann|title=Code of Openness|url=http://www.prostep.org/en/cpo.html|website=CPO|publisher=ProSTEP iViP|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[science]] and [[philosophy]], a '''paradigm''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ær|ə|d|aɪ|m}}) is a distinct set of concepts or thought patterns, including theories, research methods, postulates, and standards for what constitutes legitimate contributions to a field.

==Etymology==
{{See also|Paradeigma}}

''Paradigm'' comes from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] παράδειγμα (''paradeigma''), "pattern, example, sample"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpara%2Fdeigma παράδειγμα],
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; from the verb παραδείκνυμι (''paradeiknumi''), "exhibit, represent, expose"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dparadei%2Fknumi παραδείκνυμι], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; and that from παρά (''para''), "beside, beyond"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpara%2F παρά], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; and δείκνυμι (''deiknumi''), "to show, to point out".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Ddei%2Fknumi δείκνυμι], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[rhetoric]], ''paradeigma'' is known as a type of proof. The purpose of ''paradeigma'' is to provide an audience with an illustration of similar occurrences. This illustration is not meant to take the audience to a conclusion, however it is used to help guide them there. One analogy of how a ''paradeigma'' is meant to guide an audience would be a personal accountant. It is not the job of a personal accountant to tell their client exactly what (and what not) to spend their money on, but to aid in guiding their client as to how money should be spent based on their financial goals. [[Anaximenes of Lampsacus|Anaximenes]] defined ''paradeigma'' as "actions that have occurred previously and are similar to, or the opposite of, those which we are now discussing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sampley|first=J. Paul|title=Paul in the Greco-Roman World: A Handbook|year=2003|publisher=Trinity Press International|isbn=9781563382666|pages=228–229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original Greek term ''παράδειγμα'' (''paradeigma'') was used in Greek texts such as [[Plato]]'s [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]] (28A) as the model or the pattern that the Demiurgos used to create the cosmos.{{cn|date=June 2018}}&lt;!--- also see: [https://books.google.com/books?ei=zlP_TPbjEoi4sAO-4I2wCw&amp;ct=result&amp;id=pCbPAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=paradigm+wittgenstein&amp;q=paradigm#search_anchor Here's] its usage in 1931 in philosophy--&gt; The term had a technical meaning in the field of [[grammar]]: the 1900 ''[[Merriam-Webster]]'' dictionary defines its technical use only in the context of grammar or, in [[rhetoric]], as a term for an illustrative [[parable]] or [[fable]]. In [[linguistics]], [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] used ''paradigm'' to refer to a class of elements with similarities.

The Merriam-Webster Online dictionary defines this usage as "a philosophical and theoretical framework of a scientific school or discipline within which theories, laws, and generalizations and the experiments performed in support of them are formulated; ''broadly: a philosophical or theoretical framework of any kind''."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/paradigm paradigm - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy]]'' attributes the following description of the term to [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;Kuhn suggests that certain scientific works, such as [[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Newton's Principia]] or John Dalton's New System of Chemical Philosophy (1808), provide an open-ended resource: a framework of concepts, results, and procedures within which subsequent work is structured. Normal science proceeds within such a framework or paradigm. A paradigm does not impose a rigid or mechanical approach, but can be taken more or less creatively and flexibly.&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, Simon, 1994, 2005, 2008, rev. 2nd ed.

==Scientific paradigm==

{{Main article|Paradigm shift|Sociology of knowledge|Systemics|Commensurability (philosophy of science)|Confirmation holism}}
{{See also|Paradigm (experimental)||Scientific consensus}}

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines a ''paradigm'' as "a typical example or pattern of something; a pattern or model".&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/paradigm?q=paradigm Paradigm definition from Oxford English Dictionary Online]&lt;/ref&gt; The historian of science [[Thomas Kuhn]] gave it its contemporary meaning when he adopted the word to refer to the set of concepts and practices that define a scientific discipline at any particular period of [[time]]. In his book, ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (first published in 1962), Kuhn defines a scientific paradigm as: "universally recognized scientific achievements that, for a time, provide model problems and solutions for a community of practitioners,&lt;ref&gt;"The Structure of Scientific Revolution, Kuhn, Thomas S. The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, 3rd edition. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1996. page 10&lt;/ref&gt; i.e.,
*''what'' is to be observed and scrutinized
*the kind of ''questions'' that are supposed to be asked and probed for answers in relation to this subject
*''how'' these questions are to be structured
*''what'' predictions made by the primary theory within the discipline 
*''how'' the results of scientific investigations should be interpreted
*''how'' an experiment is to be conducted, and ''what'' equipment is available to conduct the experiment.

In ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'', Kuhn saw the sciences as going through alternating periods of ''normal science'', when an existing model of reality dominates a protracted period of puzzle-solving, and ''revolution'', when the model of reality itself undergoes sudden drastic change. Paradigms have two aspects. Firstly, within normal science, the term refers to the set of exemplary experiments that are likely to be copied or emulated. Secondly, underpinning this set of exemplars are shared preconceptions, made prior to – and conditioning – the collection of evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, T S (1970) ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'' (2nd Edition) University of Chicago Press. Section V, pages 43-51. {{ISBN|0-226-45804-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- APA Reference format; 'Author Last Name, Initials. (Year of publication). Title of the work. Publication city: Publishing Company.//--&gt; These preconceptions embody both hidden assumptions and elements that he describes as quasi-metaphysical;&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, T S (1970) ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions.'' (2nd Edition) University of Chicago Press. Pages 88 and 41, respectively.&lt;/ref&gt; the interpretations of the paradigm may vary among individual scientists.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, T S (1970) ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions.'' (2nd Edition) University of Chicago Press. Page 44.&lt;/ref&gt;
 	
Kuhn was at pains to point out that the rationale for the choice of exemplars is a specific way of viewing reality: that view and the status of "exemplar" are mutually reinforcing. For well-integrated members of a particular discipline, its paradigm is so convincing that it normally renders even the possibility of alternatives unconvincing and counter-intuitive. Such a paradigm is ''opaque'', appearing to be a direct view of the bedrock of reality itself, and obscuring the possibility that there might be other, alternative imageries hidden behind it. The conviction that the current paradigm ''is'' reality tends to disqualify evidence that might undermine the paradigm itself; this in turn leads to a build-up of unreconciled anomalies. It is the latter that is responsible for the eventual revolutionary overthrow of the incumbent paradigm, and its replacement by a new one. Kuhn used the expression ''paradigm shift'' (see below) for this process, and likened it to the perceptual change that occurs when our interpretation of an ambiguous image "flips over" from one state to another.&lt;ref name="Kuhn, T S 1970 Page 85"&gt;Kuhn, T S (1970) ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions.'' (2nd Edition) University of Chicago Press. Page 85.&lt;/ref&gt; (The [[Rabbit–duck illusion|rabbit-duck illusion]] is an example: it is not possible to see both the rabbit and the duck simultaneously.) This is significant in relation to the issue of ''incommensurability'' (see below).

An example of a currently accepted paradigm would be the [[standard model]] of physics. The [[scientific method]] allows for orthodox scientific investigations into phenomena that might contradict or disprove the standard model; however grant funding would be proportionately more difficult to obtain for such experiments, depending on the degree of deviation from the accepted standard model theory the experiment would test for. To illustrate the point, an experiment to test for the mass of neutrinos or the decay of protons (small departures from the model) is more likely to receive money than experiments that look for the violation of the conservation of momentum, or ways to engineer reverse time travel.

Mechanisms similar to the original Kuhnian paradigm have been invoked in various disciplines other than the philosophy of science. These include: the idea of major cultural themes,&lt;ref&gt;Benedict, R (1971) ''Patterns of Culture''. Routledge and Kegan Paul.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spradley, J (1979)''The Ethnographic Interview''. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich.&lt;/ref&gt; [[World view|worldviews]] (and see below), [[Ideology|ideologies]], and [[mindset]]s. They have somewhat similar meanings that apply to smaller and larger scale examples of disciplined thought.  In addition, [[Michel Foucault]] used the terms [[episteme]] and [[discourse]], [[Mathesis (philosophy)|mathesis]] and [[taxinomia]], for aspects of a "paradigm" in Kuhn's original sense.

==Paradigm shifts==
{{Main article|Paradigm shift}}
In ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'', Kuhn wrote that "the successive transition from one paradigm to another via revolution is the usual developmental pattern of mature science" (p.&amp;nbsp;12).

Paradigm shifts tend to appear in response to the accumulation of critical anomalies as well as the proposal of a new theory with the power to encompass both older relevant data and explain relevant anomalies. New paradigms tend to be most dramatic in sciences that appear to be stable and mature, as in [[physics]] at the end of the 19th century. At that time, a statement generally attributed to physicist [[Lord Kelvin]] famously claimed, "There is nothing new to be discovered in physics now. All that remains is more and more precise measurement."&lt;ref&gt;The attribution of this statement to Lord Kelvin is given in a number of sources, but without citation. It is reputed to be Kelvin's remark made in an address to the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1900. See the article on [[Lord Kelvin]] for additional details and references.&lt;/ref&gt; Five years later, [[Albert Einstein]] published his paper on [[special relativity]], which challenged the set of rules laid down by [[Classical mechanics|Newtonian mechanics]], which had been used to describe force and motion for over two hundred years. In this case, the new paradigm reduces the old to a special case in the sense that Newtonian mechanics is still a good model for approximation for speeds that are slow compared to the [[speed of light]]. Many philosophers and historians of science, including Kuhn himself, ultimately accepted a modified version of Kuhn's model, which synthesizes his original view with the gradualist model that preceded it. Kuhn's original model is now generally seen as too limited {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}.

Some examples of contemporary paradigm shifts include:
* In medicine, the transition from "clinical judgment" to [[evidence-based medicine]]
* In social psychology, the transition from [[p-hacking]] to replication&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Resnick|first1=Brian|title=What psychology’s crisis means for the future of science|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/3/14/11219446/psychology-replication-crisis|website=Vox}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In software engineering, the transition from the Rational Paradigm to the Empirical Paradigm &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ralph|first1=Paul|title=The two paradigms of software development research|journal=Science of Computer Programming|date=January 2018|volume=156|doi=10.1016/j.scico.2018.01.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kuhn's idea was, itself, revolutionary in its time. It caused a major change in the way that academics talk about science; and, so, it may be that it caused (or was part of) a "paradigm shift" in the history and sociology of science. However, Kuhn would not recognize such a paradigm shift. Being in the social sciences, people can still use earlier ideas to discuss the history of science.

===Paradigm paralysis{{anchor|Paradigm Paralysis}}===
Perhaps the greatest barrier to a paradigm shift, in some cases, is the reality of paradigm paralysis: the inability or refusal to see beyond the current models of thinking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mnsu.edu/comdis/kuster/Infostuttering/Paradigmparalysis.html Do you suffer from paradigm paralysis?]&lt;/ref&gt; This is similar to what psychologists term [[confirmation bias]]. Examples include rejection of [[Aristarchus of Samos|Aristarchus of Samos']], [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]]', and [[Galileo]]'s theory of a [[heliocentric]] solar system, the discovery of [[electrostatic]] [[photography]], [[xerography]] and the [[quartz clock]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Incommensurability==

Kuhn pointed out that it could be difficult to assess whether a particular paradigm shift had actually led to progress, in the sense of explaining more facts, explaining more important facts, or providing better explanations, because the understanding of "more important", "better", etc. changed with the paradigm. The two versions of reality are thus ''incommensurable''. Kuhn's version of [[commensurability (philosophy of science)|incommensurability]] has an important psychological dimension; this is apparent from his analogy between a paradigm shift and the flip-over involved in some optical illusions.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, T S (1970) ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'' (2nd Edition) University of Chicago Press. Page 85.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he subsequently diluted his commitment to incommensurability considerably, partly in the light of other studies of scientific development that did not involve revolutionary change.&lt;ref&gt;Haack, S (2003) ''Defending Science – within reason: between scientism and cynicism.'' Prometheus Books. {{ISBN|978-1-59102-458-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the examples of incommensurability that Kuhn used was the change in the style of chemical investigations that followed the work of [[Lavoisier]] on atomic theory in the late 18th Century.&lt;ref name="Kuhn, T S 1970 Page 85" /&gt; In this change, the focus had shifted from the bulk properties of matter (such as hardness, colour, reactivity, etc.) to studies of atomic weights and quantitative studies of reactions. He suggested that it was impossible to make the comparison needed to judge which body of knowledge was better or more advanced. However, this change in research style (and paradigm) eventually (after more than a century) led to a theory of atomic structure that accounts well for the bulk properties of matter; see, for example, Brady's ''General Chemistry''.&lt;ref&gt;Brady, J E (1990). ''General Chemistry: Principles and Structure.'' (5th Edition.) John Wiley and Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; According to P J Smith, this ability of science to back off, move sideways, and then advance is characteristic of the natural sciences,&lt;ref&gt;Smith, P J (2011) ''The Reform of Economics''. Taw Books. {{ISBN|978-0-9570697-0-1}}. Page 129.&lt;/ref&gt; but contrasts with the position in some social sciences, notably economics.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, P J (2011) ''The Reform of Economics.'' Taw Books. Chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

This apparent ability does not guarantee that the account is veridical at any one time, of course, and most modern philosophers of science are [[Fallibilism|fallibilists]]. However, members of other disciplines do see the issue of incommensurability as a much greater obstacle to evaluations of "progress"; see, for example, Martin Slattery's ''Key Ideas in Sociology''.&lt;ref name=incommensurable&gt;{{Cite book

==Subsequent developments==
Opaque Kuhnian paradigms and paradigm shifts do exist. A few years after the discovery of the mirror-neurons that provide a hard-wired basis for the human capacity for empathy, the scientists involved were unable to identify the incidents that had directed their attention to the issue. Over the course of the investigation, their language and metaphors had changed so that they themselves could no longer interpret all of their own earlier laboratory notes and records.&lt;ref&gt;Iacoboni, M. (2008), ''Mirroring People: The New Science of How We Connect with Others.'' Farrar, Straus and Giroux. Page 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imre Lakatos and research programmes===
However, many instances exist in which change in a discipline's core model of reality has happened in a more evolutionary manner, with individual scientists exploring the usefulness of alternatives in a way that would not be possible if they were constrained by a paradigm. [[Imre Lakatos]] suggested (as an alternative to Kuhn's formulation) that scientists actually work within [[Imre Lakatos#Research programmes|research programmes]].&lt;ref&gt;[16] Lakatos, I. (1970), ''"Falsification and the Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes," '' in Lakatos, I. and Musgrave, A. (eds.) (1990), ''Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge.'' Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt; In Lakatos' sense, a research programme is a sequence of problems, placed in order of priority. This set of priorities, and the associated set of preferred techniques, is the '''positive heuristic''' of a programme. Each programme also has a '''negative heuristic'''; this consists of a set of fundamental assumptions that – temporarily, at least – takes priority over observational evidence when the two appear to conflict.

This latter aspect of research programmes is inherited from Kuhn's work on paradigms,{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} and represents an important departure from the elementary account of [[Scientific method|how science works]]. According to this, science proceeds through repeated cycles of observation, induction, hypothesis-testing, etc., with the test of consistency with [[empirical evidence]] being imposed at each stage. Paradigms and research programmes allow anomalies to be set aside, where there is reason to believe that they arise from incomplete knowledge (about either the substantive topic, or some aspect of the theories implicitly used in making observations.

===Larry Laudan: Dormant anomalies, fading credibility, and research traditions===
[[Larry Laudan]]&lt;ref&gt;Laudan, L. (1977), ''Progress and Its Problems: Towards a Theory of Scientific Growth.'' University of California Press, Berkeley.&lt;/ref&gt; has also made two important contributions to the debate. Laudan believed that something akin to paradigms exist in the social sciences (Kuhn had contested this, see below); he referred to these as '''research traditions'''. Laudan noted that some anomalies become "dormant", if they survive a long period during which no competing alternative has shown itself capable of resolving the anomaly. He also presented cases in which a dominant paradigm had withered away because its lost credibility when viewed against changes in the wider intellectual milieu.

==In social sciences==
Kuhn himself did not consider the concept of paradigm as appropriate for the social sciences. He explains in his preface to ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'' that he developed the concept of paradigm precisely to distinguish the social from the natural sciences. While visiting the [[Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences]] in 1958 and 1959, surrounded by social scientists, he observed that they were never in agreement about the nature of legitimate scientific problems and methods. He explains that he wrote this book precisely to show that there can never be any paradigms in the social sciences. [[Mattei Dogan]], a French sociologist, in his article "Paradigms in the Social Sciences," develops Kuhn's original thesis that there are no paradigms at all in the social sciences since the concepts are [[polysemy|polysemic]], involving the deliberate mutual ignorance between scholars and the proliferation of schools in these disciplines. Dogan provides many examples of the non-existence of paradigms in the social sciences in his essay, particularly in sociology, political science and political anthropology.

However, both Kuhn's original work and Dogan's commentary are directed at disciplines that are defined by conventional labels (such as "sociology"). While it is true that such broad groupings in the social sciences are usually not based on a Kuhnian paradigm, each of the competing sub-disciplines may still be underpinned by a paradigm, research programme, research tradition, and/ or professional imagery. These structures will be motivating research, providing it with an agenda, defining what is and is not anomalous evidence, and inhibiting debate with other groups that fall under the same broad disciplinary label. (A good example is provided by the contrast between [[B. F. Skinner|Skinnerian]] [[radical behaviourism]] and [[personal construct theory]] (PCT) within psychology. The most significant of the many ways these two sub-disciplines of psychology differ concerns meanings and intentions. In PCT, they are seen as the central concern of psychology; in radical behaviourism, they are not scientific evidence at all, as they cannot be directly observed.)

Such considerations explain the conflict between the Kuhn/ Dogan view, and the views of others (including Larry Laudan, see above), who do apply these concepts to social sciences.

Handa,&lt;ref&gt;Handa, M. L. (1986) ''"Peace Paradigm: Transcending Liberal and Marxian Paradigms".'' Paper presented in "International Symposium on Science, Technology and Development, New Delhi, India, March 20–25, 1987, Mimeographed at O.I.S.E., University of Toronto, Canada (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; M.L. (1986) introduced the idea of "social paradigm" in the context of social sciences. He identified the basic components of a social paradigm. Like Kuhn, Handa addressed the issue of changing paradigm; the process popularly known as "[[paradigm shift]]". In this respect, he focused on social circumstances that precipitate such a shift and the effects of the shift on social institutions, including the institution of education. This broad shift in the social arena, in turn, changes the way the individual perceives reality.

Another use of the word ''paradigm'' is in the sense of "[[worldview]]". For example, in social science, the term is used to describe the set of experiences, beliefs and values that affect the way an individual perceives reality and responds to that perception. Social scientists have adopted the Kuhnian phrase "paradigm shift" to denote a change in how a given society goes about organizing and understanding reality. A "dominant paradigm" refers to the values, or system of thought, in a society that are most standard and widely held at a given time. Dominant paradigms are shaped both by the community's cultural background and by the context of the historical moment. Hutchin &lt;ref&gt;Hutchin, Ted (2013) ''The Right Choice : Using Theory of Constraints for Effective Leadership'', Taylor and Francis, Hoboken, p. 124 {{ISBN|978-1-4398-8625-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; outlines some conditions that facilitate a system of thought to become an accepted dominant paradigm:

* Professional organizations that give legitimacy to the paradigm
* Dynamic leaders who introduce and purport the paradigm
* Journals and editors who write about the system of thought. They both disseminate the information essential to the paradigm and give the paradigm legitimacy
* Government agencies who give credence to the paradigm
* Educators who propagate the paradigm's ideas by teaching it to students
* Conferences conducted that are devoted to discussing ideas central to the paradigm
* Media coverage
* Lay groups, or groups based around the concerns of lay persons, that embrace the beliefs central to the paradigm
* Sources of funding to further research on the paradigm

==Other uses==
The word ''paradigm'' is also still used to indicate a pattern or model or an outstandingly clear or typical example or [[archetype]].  The term is frequently used in this sense in the design professions.  Design Paradigms or [[archetype]]s comprise functional precedents for design solutions.  The best known references on design paradigms are ''Design Paradigms: A Sourcebook for Creative Visualization'', by Wake, and ''Design Paradigms'' by Petroski.

This term is also used in [[cybernetics]]. Here it means (in a very wide sense) a (conceptual) protoprogram for reducing the chaotic mass to some form of order.  Note the similarities to the concept of entropy in chemistry and physics.  A paradigm there would be a sort of prohibition to proceed with any action that would increase the total [[entropy]] of the system. To create a paradigm requires a [[closed system]] that accepts changes.  Thus a paradigm can only apply to a system that is not in its final stage.

Beyond its use in the physical and social sciences, Kuhn's paradigm concept has been analysed in relation to its applicability in identifying 'paradigms' with respect to worldviews at specific points in history. One example is Matthew Edward Harris' book ''The Notion of Papal Monarchy in the Thirteenth Century: The Idea of Paradigm in Church History''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harris|first=Matthew|title=The notion of papal monarchy in the thirteenth century : the idea of paradigm in church history|year=2010|publisher=[[Edwin Mellen Press]]|location=Lewiston, N.Y.|isbn=978-0-7734-1441-9|pages=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris stresses the primarily sociological importance of paradigms, pointing towards Kuhn's second edition of ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions''. Although obedience to popes such as [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]] and [[Boniface VIII]] was widespread, even written testimony from the time showing loyalty to the pope does not demonstrate that the writer had the same worldview as the Church, and therefore pope, at the centre. The difference between paradigms in the physical sciences and in historical organisations such as the Church is that the former, unlike the latter, requires technical expertise rather than repeating statements. In other words, after scientific training through what Kuhn calls '[[exemplars (Kuhn)|exemplars]]', one could not genuinely believe that, to take a trivial example, [[the earth is flat]], whereas thinkers such as [[Giles of Rome]] in the thirteenth century wrote in favour of the pope, then could easily write similarly glowing things about the king. A writer such as Giles would have wanted a good job from the pope; he was a papal publicist. However, Harris writes that 'scientific group membership is not concerned with desire, emotions, gain, loss and any idealistic notions concerning the nature and destiny of humankind...but simply to do with aptitude, explanation, [and] cold description of the facts of the world and the universe from within a paradigm'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harris|first=Matthew|title=The notion of papal monarchy in the thirteenth century : the idea of paradigm in church history|year=2010|publisher=Edwin Mellen Press|location=Lewiston, N.Y.|isbn=978-0-7734-1441-9|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:People's Architect of the USSR.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''People's Architect of the USSR'' medal]]
'''People's Architect of the USSR''' ({{lang-ru|Народный архитектор СССР}}), also sometimes translated as '''National Architect of the USSR''', was an honorary title granted to [[architect]]s of the [[Soviet Union]]; it was established on August 12, 1967 by [[Leonid Brezhnev]].
It was bestowed by the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]] of the USSR owing proposals addressed by the ''State Construction Committee'' or by the ''Soviet Architects' Union''.  The [[Supreme Soviet]] could possibly refuse these designations.

A diploma of the [[Supreme Soviet]]'s presidency was given to those who were appointed ''People's Architect of the USSR''  jointly with the medal and its concerning certificate.
The title was bestowed to architects who had achieved stunning results in Soviet [[architecture]]'s development either applying their expertise and creativity to the [[urban planning]] or to the design of important building compounds for civil, industrial or rural use.

Following the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union]] (1990), by a decree of the [[Russian presidency]], it was created the new title of ''[[Honorary titles of the Russian Federation|Meritorious Architect of the Russian Federation]]''.

== Design ==
The medal was made of [[tombac]] and its shape was quadrangular (22,5 x 23,5&amp;nbsp;mm) with twisted corners. 
The central part was occupied by the inscription "Народный архитектор СССР" (''People's Architect of the USSR'') and, below, the [[hammer and sickle]] symbol. 
Symbol and inscription and were embossed, with convex letters. The medal was suspended to a single red silk fringe (18&amp;nbsp;mm × 21&amp;nbsp;mm) to whom it was attached by a metallic buckle decorated with [[bay laurel]] leaves.

The '''Phyle Cave''' is a small cave on [[Parnitha|Mount Parnes]] near [[Fyli]] (Phyle), a suburb of [[Athens]] in [[Attica (region)|Attica]], [[Greece]]. In [[ancient Greece]] it was the site of a sanctuary to [[Pan (god)|Pan]] and the [[nymph]]s. It is also known as '''Lychnospilia''' for the large number of oil lamps found in the cave. It has been identified as the cave which occurs in the ''[[Dyskolos]]'' of [[Menander]].&lt;ref name=lars /&gt; The cave was excavated in 1901.&lt;ref name=fowl /&gt; Three votive [[relief]]s found in the cave are now on display in the [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens|National Archaeological Museum]] of Athens.

Because of its use for the veneration of Pan the cave is also called the '''Cave of Pan'''. It was one of the five caves of Pan in the vicinity of ancient [[Athens]].

==Description==
In Attica most cave shrines dedicated to Pan and the nymphs featured a common type of votive relief. These show three females led by [[Hermes]], often accompanied by Pan and [[Achelous]] (for his association with water), within a rocky framework simulating a cave entrance. The female figures are often identified as nymphs or sometimes more specifically the [[Charites]].&lt;ref name=ridg /&gt; These reliefs were also found in the Phyle Cave and are now exhibited in the National Archaeological Museum of Athens as inventory numbers 1448, 1859 and 1879.

Number 1879 is particularly complex and interesting. The relief shows a mountain god, Pan, a [[satyr]] playing the [[pan flute|syrinx]] and Achelous with a [[cornucopia]]. They surround the familiar group of three females near a basin fed by a lion-head waterspout. The waterspout is pierced so that it could supply the water for the actual basin in the cave itself. Various dates have been proposed for the relief ranging from the middle of the fourth century BC to the first century BC, with the later [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] date being more likely.&lt;ref name=ridg /&gt;

The '''Polyforum Cultural Siqueiros''' is a cultural, political and social facility located in [[Mexico City]] as part of the [[World Trade Center Mexico City]].  It was designed and decorated by [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]] in the 1960s and hosts the largest mural work in the world called ''La Marcha de la Humanidad''. The building has a theatre, galleries and more, but the main focus is the Forum Universal, which contains the interior portion of Siqueiros' mural work. Visitors can experience the mural while standing on a rotating stage, listening to Siqueiros narrate.

[[File:PolyforumSiqueiros02.jpg|thumb|View of the outer wall of the facility]]
The Polyforum is a decagon shaped construction with different exhibition spaces that feature David Alfaro Siqueiros’ work.&lt;ref name="museo"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexicocity.gob.mx/detalle.php?id_pat=3736 |title=Description |publisher=Government of Mexico City |accessdate=2 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building is part of a business complex called the World Trade Center Mexico City in the [[Benito Juárez, D.F.|Benito Juárez borough]] of Mexico City.&lt;ref name="alistan"&gt;{{cite news |title= Alistan nueva galería en el Polyforum Siqueiros |author=Notimex |url= http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/789257.html |newspaper=El Universal |location=Mexico City |date=August 28, 2011 |accessdate=September 2, 2011 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Enlist new gallery at the Polyforum Siqueiros }}&lt;/ref&gt; This complex was designed by architects Joaquín Alvarez, Guillermo Rossel de la Lama and Ramón Mikelajáuregui, and built just outside Parque de la Lama, but the Polyforum was designed and decorated by Siqueiros, who nicknamed it “El coronelazo.” The exterior is in the form of a diamond and the inside has eight sides.&lt;ref name="posponen"&gt;{{cite news |title= Posponen remodelación del Polyforum Cultural Siqueiros |url= http://www.informador.com.mx/cultura/2011/296278/6/posponen-remodelacion-del-polyforum-cultural-siqueiros.htm |newspaper=El Informador |location=Guadalajara, Mexico |date=May 30, 2011 |accessdate=September 2, 2011 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Postone remodeling of the Polyforum Cultural Siqueiros }}&lt;/ref&gt; The building with its murals is considered to be an “artistic heritage site” for Mexico, registered by the Centro Nacional de Conservación, [[Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes y Literatura]] and Registro del Patrimonio Artístico Mueble.&lt;ref name="posponen"/&gt; The Polyforum is a multiple event facility dedicated to cultural, political and social events. Its main aspects include a 500-seat theatre, two galleries, offices and the Foro Universal or Universal Forum.

The outside wall was built in 1970 as a way for patron [[Manuel Suárez y Suárez|Manuel Suárez]] to prevent encroachment or destruction of his property. The wall became immediately controversial because although it was built for safety purposes, it obstructed the view of the Polyforum for passersby, thus making it less accessible to the general public. The press allegedly deemed the wall defensive and antisocial, and Siqueiros tried to defend the wall by saying that it was merely an aesthetic extension of the Polyforum itself. Made into a work of art, the inner surface of the wall celebrates the fiftieth anniversary of the Mexican mural movement of which Siqueiros actively participated in with [[Diego Rivera]], [[José Clemente Orozco]], and others. The mural prominently features portraits of Rivera and Orozco, as well as Dr. Atl, a key figure in the start of the mural movement, and graphic artists Guadalupe Posada and [[Leopoldo Mendez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The Polyforum's exterior, a 2,750&amp;nbsp;ft. area, features a twelve-faced sculptural mural painting. Each face depicts a different symbolic concept. The twelve concepts depicted are: Destiny, Ecology, Acrobats, Masses, Decalog, Christ, Indigenous Peoples, Dance, Mythology, Mingling of Races, Music, and Atom. The exterior work is meant to serve as a preview of the interior mural, to entice visitors to enter the building, and to make visitors contemplate the complex meanings of the concepts represented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Polyforum Cultural Siqueiros: Mexico|last = Suárez y Suárez|first = Manuel|publisher = Poliforum Siqueiros|year = 1975|isbn = |location = México|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political climate==
The year 1960 marked the fiftieth year of the [[Mexican Revolution]], and the political situation in Mexico during the 1960s was quite grim. The early 1960s was marked by major control by the Left and attempts to create class equality, but these attempts unfortunately failed. In 1964, the combination of both an economic decline and an announcement that allottable land was near exhaustion led many peasants to revolt. In the late 1960s, the Right gained control, which led to many doctor and student strikes that were received with strong resistance from the government. The most shocking example of the murky political situation in 1960s Mexico happened in the form of the [[Tlatelolco Massacre]] on October 2, 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mexico's 1968 Massacre: What Really Happened?|url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=97546687|accessdate = 2015-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a student demonstration that happened ten days before the Summer Olympics in Mexico City, police and military officers shot into a crowd of unarmed students at Tlatelolco Plaza. The final death toll remains a mystery, but it has been reported that four students died, twenty were wounded, and thousands were beaten, jailed, and disappeared. This event coincided with the intended opening of the Polyforum Cultural Siqueiros during the summer of 1968, and demonstrates how turbulent the political climate was in Mexico during the Polyforum’s construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Folgarait | first =Leonard | title =So Far From Heaven: David Alfaro Siqueiros' The March of Humanity and Mexican Revolutionary Politics | publisher =Cambridge University Press | date =1987 | location =New York | pages =19–25 | isbn =0521330610 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mexico 2000==
The Polyforum was designed as part of a major redevelopment/improvement project for Mexico City entitled Mexico 2000. Because of an increase in Mexico City’s urban population, Mexico 2000 strived to generate income for the city through tourism and services at its decentralized location at Parque de la Lama. In addition to making arts more accessible to people through Siqueiros’ work at the Polyforum, some of the other contributions of Mexico 2000 included underground networks of driveways, closed circuit radio and television broadcasting, a new system of construction called “Tridilosa” that lightened the weight of the building structure as to allow for more rooms to be created, and expedited travel services for tourists coming into the city.
&lt;br&gt;The plaza’s major hotel, “[[El Hotel de Mexico]],” is 730 foot high building that was designed to house a large number of tourists. At the time, the hotel was the tallest reinforced concrete and earthquake-resistant building in the world, and featured 1,512 rooms and suites with a variety of dining options. Equally important to tourism as the Polyforum, “El Hotel de Mexico” was built for both functionality and aesthetic pleasure through its architectural grandeur.&lt;ref name="Suárez y Suárez 1975"&gt;{{cite book

==The commission==
Although the date is rather uncertain, most agree that the initial commission of the Polyforum happened in 1960 before the radical artist Siqueiros was imprisoned for the charges of attacking police, resisting arrest, firing an illegal weapon, and inciting violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last =Folgarait | first =Leonard | title =So Far From Heaven: David Alfaro Siqueiros’ The March of Humanity and Mexican Revolutionary Politics | publisher =Cambridge University Press | date =1987 | location =New York | pages =42 | isbn =0521330610 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Siqueiros officially accepted the commission from art patron and industrialist Manuel Suárez on September 7, 1964. The first request of Suárez was for a large mural to be housed in Cuernavaca. The location of the mural was then moved to Mexico City in 1966, and now is known as ''The March of Humanity''. The location change to Parque de la Lama was part of Suárez’s larger ideas to both draw people away from the urban center and to promote tourism in an effort to boost the suffering Mexican economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Creating the Polyforum was a collective act, and required a large team of workers. Several architects, engineers, painters, sculptors, and acoustics experts from all around the world came to work on the massive project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The undertaking was so large that Siqueiros purchased an additional piece of land next to his home and studio in Cuernavaca for his team to complete the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = Siqueiros, 72, Doing Biggest Mural|last = Schonberg|first = Harold|date = November 21, 1968|work = New York Times|access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the panels for ''The March of Humanity'' were created in Cuernavaca, where Rhode Island School of Design alumni Mark Rogovin worked under Siqueiros. Rogovin attests to the fact that he and a friend were the only U.S. natives to be working on the project, as most of the other members were from Japan, Italy, Argentina, and various other locations around the world. According to Rogovin, Siqueiros was constantly at the studio, putting in long days and making sure that the project was being carried out to his standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Rogovin | first =Mark | title =The March of Humanity: An Expression in Public Art | journal =Rhode Island School of Design Alumni Bulletin| volume =26| pages =19| date =1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was initially to be completed for the 1968 Olympic Games, but due to political and financial complications, the Polyforum was not finished and inaugurated until December 15, 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Forum Universal==

The main feature of the complex at Parque de la Lama is the Forum Universal, which contains Siquieros’ mural called ''La Marcha de la Humanidad'' (''The March of Humanity''). The building, which contains four floors and has an area of 134,000 square feet, also contains a theatre, two joined galleries and other facilities. Siqueiros’ mural covers the dome on the top floor, and up to one thousand spectators can stand on the rotating platform beneath the mural. Accompanying the viewing experience, a light and sound program that was designed by Manuel Suárez y Suárez plays to educate the viewers about the mural. The next floor down features a space for local and international art exhibitions. Below this floor is a theater that features various performances, as well as a small shopping area called the Universal Forum Emerging Art Space (EAE).&lt;ref name="polyforumsiqueiros.com.mx"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Polyforum Siqueiros {{!}} Conocenos {{!}} Nosotros|url = http://polyforumsiqueiros.com.mx/htmls/conocenos/conocenos_01.html|website = polyforumsiqueiros.com.mx|accessdate = 2015-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basement of the Polyforum is an open space that can be used for storage as well as exhibitions.&lt;ref name="Suárez y Suárez 1975"/&gt;

In 2011, for the 40th anniversary of the structure, the Forum's two art  galleries named after [[Dr. Atl]] and [[Mario Orozco Rivera]] were renovated and merged into one gallery, measuring over 300 square meters. The first served as the site museum with a space of 145 meters squared. Its permanent exhibition consisted of photographs and models and sketches related to the painting of the site’s mural. It also contained biographical information in the form of documents and photographs of Manuel Suárez y Suárez, the sponsor of the Polyforum along with that of Siqueiros. The gallery contains a statue of Manuel Suárez y Suárez.&lt;ref name="alistan"/&gt; The second gallery dedicated to Orozco Rivera measured 169 meters squared and is shows mainly temporary exhibits of painting, sculpture and photography. The new gallery's first exhibition of 2011 was called “My Trend Week," and it was designed to display the works of new artistic talent in architecture as well as graphic, industrial and interior design.&lt;ref name="alistan"/&gt; The combined space has been tentatively renamed “Espacio de Arte Emergente” (Emerging Art Space) .&lt;ref name="alistan"/&gt;

==''La Marcha de la Humanidad'' (''The March of Humanity'')==
Inside the Polyforum hosts Siqueiros’ largest mural ever to be created, which is fully titled, ''The March of Humanity on Earth and Toward the Cosmos: Misery and Science''.&lt;ref name="Folgarait"&gt;{{cite book

They are hungry, the oldest, doubled over under a bundle of firewood, walks off in search of a livelihood; groups of women running pell-mell knock each other to get a crumb of bread thrown away by others---an unending struggle to solve the basic problem of existence.”&lt;ref name="Suárez y Suárez 1975"/&gt; The overall theme of the mural is humanity’s endless struggle throughout history and the search for a better society. The mural is divided into four main sections: ''The March of Humanity Towards Bourgeois Democratic Revolution''; ''The March of Humanity to the Revolution of the Future''; ''Peace, Culture, and Harmony''; and ''Science and Technology''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Polyforum Siqueiros {{!}} Foro Universal {{!}} Descripción|url = http://polyforumsiqueiros.com.mx/htmls/foro/foro_01.html|website = polyforumsiqueiros.com.mx|accessdate = 2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Section One: South Wall: ''The March of Humanity Towards Bourgeois Democratic Revolution''===

This section depicts of the mural depicts a revolution before a time of democratic revolution, and is characterized by violence and confusion. There are many figures and forms in different positions, suggesting overall chaos. In the center, demagoguery emerges in the form of a clown who is flanked by militaristic figures. Ninety-some figures are pictured in this scene, and are compositionally stacked rather than overlapped. The upper register tells a story that begins with two dark-skinned, half-naked men shown with their knees bent. Next to them, two mothers and their several children walking through a barren landscape that features one large, tree-like form in the background. The next figure is an old man who is bent down under a pile of sticks. Next to him is a group of women huddling together who are shown covering their children with shawls. This entire group is shown to be moving toward a white-faced, dancing figure with his arms raised. This figure, who appears as a leader of some sort, is flanked by a group of people who are also raising their arms. The lower register features figures that are larger in scale than those in the upper register. The first form is an abstract, humanoid form that is more difficult to recognize than the figures from the upper register. Following him is a brutalized, black male figure who is shown armless and hanged, swinging from a noose. The next figures are two large, monstrous figures with recognizably human anatomy that are followed by a larger group of marchers that are shown in uniform, carrying spears and rifles. This procession of synchronized marchers closes out the frame.&lt;ref name="Folgarait"/&gt;

===Section Two: North Wall: ''The March of Humanity to the Revolution of the Future''===

This section represents another march toward the revolution of the future, with the ceiling above representing the space race between the Americans and the Soviets.This section represents another march toward the revolution of the future, with the ceiling above representing the space race between the Americans and the Soviets.This section depicts the future as a chaotic and confusing time, and begins with a woman being attacked by a ferocious anthropomorphic beast. Next to the woman, a man chops down a poisonous tree, and across from him, two frightened women scurry across the turbulent landscape. Above these figures is a three-dimensional figure that protrudes from the wall and is representative of metamorphosis. The next scene depicts a large grouping of women next to a large [[amate]] tree, which is representative of the new leaders who will aid the development of humanity. Two figures come out of the tree, and seem to be flying into space. In the final scene, a gender ambiguous figure, shown sitting on a rock, points back to the tree to emphasize its importance. The landscape of Section 2 is much more rough and jagged than the landscape in Section 1, suggesting that the future revolution will be a great challenge for humanity to overcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Folgarait | first =Leonard | title =So Far From Heaven: David Alfaro Siqueiros' The March of Humanity and Mexican Revolutionary Politics | publisher =Cambridge University Press | date =1987 | location =New York | pages =60–72 | isbn =0521330610 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sections Three and Four: East and West Sides: ''Peace, Culture, and Harmony''===

This section shows a man offering industrialization to the west, and on the east side, a woman offering culture to humanize society. Converging lines that come out from the wall behind the figures unify the hands of the man and woman. The man in this scene is the leader who emerged from the [[amate]] tree in Section 2, and his return with the female suggests that he has successfully mated and created a new race. These two figures have brought the tools necessary to save humanity through starting a new march towards a better future. .&lt;ref name="Folgarait"/&gt;

==Siqueiros Foundation of the Arts==
The Polyforum is a private institution which is supported through its activities and through private donations to the Siqueiros Foundation. The Siqueiros Foundation is run by Siqueiros' niece Anna Siqueiros, based in Los Angeles, and its mission is "Bringing Color into a Concrete World." As a memorial to the deceased David Alfaro Siqueiros, the Siqueiros Foundation strives to empower underprivileged children by providing them with materials and locations to artistically express themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is SFA {{!}} Siqueiros Foundation of the Arts|url = http://siqueirosfoundation.org/sample-page/|website = siqueirosfoundation.org|accessdate = 2015-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Siqueiros Foundation preserves a collection of periodicals, audio, video and photography related to the artist, whose digitalization was begun in 2010.  This collection consists of 102,908 documents and images with elements such as correspondence with contemporary intellectuals, writers and politicians, including that from the Siquieros was incarcerated in [[Palacio de Lecumberri|Lecumberri]] from 1960 to 1964. It also includes 7,000 postcards from Germany alone, and 10,000 photographs of family and 80,000 texts written about the artist.&lt;ref name="elporvenir"&gt;{{cite news |title = Continuará en 2011 digitalización del Fondo Siqueiros|newspaper = Azteca 21|location = Mexico City|date = January 23, 2011|language = Spanish|trans-title=The digitalization of the Siqueiros collection will continue into 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Over its first forty years, the building suffered significant deterioration to its structure and its murals.&lt;ref name="posponen"/&gt; The deterioration of the mural work is due to environmental factors and the materials Siquieros used to create the piece.(restaurant)  In 2011, remodeling work was begun on the facility to mark its fortieth anniversary.&lt;ref name="alistan"/&gt; Some restoration work had been performed in 2011, but lack of funds has prevented completion.&lt;ref name="posponen"/&gt;

The contract was for ResultSource "to conduct a bestseller campaign for your book, 'Real Marriage' on the week of January 2, 2012. The bestseller campaign is intended to place 'Real Marriage' on the New York Times bestseller list for the Advice How-to list." To achieve this, the contract stated that "RSI will be purchasing at least 11,000 total orders in one week." This took place and as a result, the book was successfully ranked #1 on the hardcover advice bestseller list on January 22, 2014.&lt;ref name=kellogg2014/&gt; Driscoll later published an apology letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mark Driscoll Posts an Open Letter of Apology|url=http://www.relevantmagazine.com/god/church/mark-driscoll-posts-open-letter-apology|website=Relevant Magazine|accessdate=9 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''show choir''' (originally known as a "'''swing choir'''") is a group of people who combine choral singing with dance, sometimes within the context of a specific idea or story. It is most prevalent in the [[Midwestern United States]], and was popularized by the American television show [[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]. Unlike sports, no official national or state sanctioning bodies exist to regulate the performances or standings.
==Location==

Show choir is primarily performed as a school activity in the USA. It is usually done as a co-curricular (as part of a class, as well as outside of the school day) or an extracurricular (completely outside of the school day) activity. In addition, some show choirs are formed in organizations outside of school. Though usually a high school activity, the art form has grown and expanded to all levels of school from elementary through the college/university level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.enmu.edu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;Itemid=1249&amp;id=633&amp;lang=en-us&amp;view=article|title=Vocal Music - Eastern New Mexico University|website=www.enmu.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of the [[United States]], show choirs can be found in other countries, including [[Canada]], [[Mexico]], and [[Argentina]].

[[File:ShowChoirs In the USA.jpeg|thumb|Relative positions of every past and present registered high school with at least one show choir in the United States (excluding Hawaii) as of November, 2015 (courtesy showchoir.com).]]

==Overview==
While there is no standard requirement for the number of performers, show choirs typically contain between 30 and 60 singer/dancers, but it depends on the size of the school and the discretion of the director. Larger schools with a more advanced program may have more than one show choir.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/a/depere.k12.wi.us/de-pere-high-school-chorus/choirs|title=Choirs - De Pere High School Chorus|website=sites.google.com|access-date=2017-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unisex show choirs usually compete in a separate division,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.showchoiramerica.com/results|title=show-choir-america|website=show-choir-america|access-date=2017-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the exception of an "open" division, during which unisex and mixed groups compete against each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cloverhillshowchoir.com/talent/iridescence/iridescence-results/|title=Iri Results|date=2011-10-11|newspaper=CLOVER HILL SHOW CHOIR|access-date=2017-02-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Show choirs traditionally wear a costume, though the definition of what is considered a costume in show choir is very broad and ranges from jeans and a T-shirt to extravagant period costumes or flashy dance-wear. It can be very conservative (such as tuxedos and ball gowns) or very edgy (such as modern or revealing clothing). Additionally, many larger show choirs include two or more costumes in their show. Participants typically wear stage makeup and shoes conducive to dancing (often "character shoes"). In the Midwest and on the East Coast, woman participants will generally do their hair to look identical. Californian show choirs do not generally have identical hair. Otherwise, from the costumes to the stage makeup, show choir members often look uniform during most shows.

The choir usually has a backup band ("jazz" or "combo" if it includes a Horn Section) providing instrumental music to complement the voices. The instrumentation varies from song to song and choir to choir, but a common show choir band consists of guitar, bass, drums, trumpets, trombone, alto sax, tenor sax, piano, and synthesizer. Some bands include violins or even cellos. Many larger show choirs typically have a larger combo to accompany them. The band is usually out of sight, however the occasional show will have part of the band on stage at certain points.

A "Tech Crew" (or "Stage Crew") is standard with most show choirs, as they assist with and handle the lighting, sound, and stage setup. Show choir crew also help in the creation and management of costumes. During the show, the crew can do several things from helping performers change costumes, manage props, hand out microphones and other duties set out in the choreography and design of the show.

One problem that arises with show choir is a lack of male members. Due to the stigma that the performing arts is a more feminine activity, many teenage boys are discouraged from participating in show choir. Males also tend to not be drawn to show choir because the activity seems less successful than other high school activities, such as sports. A lack of males can cause choirs to lack in vocal performance because they do not have enough pitch variety. In order to achieve rich melodies, choirs need males of all voice ranges from tenor to bass. After a study done by the Choral Journal &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Doran|last2=Thomas|first2=Ken|date=2007-01-01|title=Show Choirs: Show Choir Competition and the Impact on Male Recruitment|jstor=23557314|journal=The Choral Journal|volume=47|issue=10|pages=50–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; another alarming factor that has caused there to be a lack of male vocalists in show choir is choir director's lack of investment in the issue. Many choir directors have accepted the fact that they will always have less males in their choir, therefore very few make an attempt to reach out to males in the school. By not making an effort to change this issue, directors unintentionally support this issue. By reaching out to males and creating more of a supportive community for high school boy, more males will likely participate in show choir.

Some participants believe that show choir is a sport due to the dancing aspect;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thecaptainslog.org/2017/sports/why-show-choir-is-considered-a-varsity-sport/|title=Why Show Choir is considered a varsity sport|access-date=2018-01-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wsaz.com/content/news/New-proposal-could-make-dance-or-show-choir-accepted-for-PE-credit-463993433.html|title=New proposal could make dance or show choir accepted for PE credit|last=Arick|first=Bradford|access-date=2018-01-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[West Virginia]] and [[Illinois]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/mundelein/news/ct-mun-mhs-show-choir-pe-waiver-tl-1123-story.html|title=Mundelein H.S. delays vote on changes to show choir, art classes|last=Kambic|first=Rick|work=chicagotribune.com|access-date=2018-01-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is currently pending as a [[physical education]] credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wvea.org/content/state-board-wvbe-policies|title=State Board (WVBE) Policies {{!}} WVEA|website=www.wvea.org|language=en|access-date=2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some physical education teacher groups have come out against the move, saying that P.

==Competitions==
[[File:Totino-Grace Spectacular.jpg|alt=The cover of a program from 2010.|thumb|The cover of a program from [[Totino-Grace High School]] in 2010.]]
Many show choirs participate in competitions, sometimes called "invitationals" (though most are not invitation-only events) or "festivals".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalshowchoirrankings.com/|title=National Show Choir Rank System|website=National Show Choir Rank System|access-date=2017-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; These competitions are often held at the high school where the "host group" attends and sometimes performs as an exhibition, though some events are held at auditoriums or other facilities that can accommodate larger crowds and provide better acoustic performance.

Competitions can be as small as a showcase of a few groups from the immediate geographic area or they can feature many groups from multiple states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.news8000.com/news/local-news/15-schools-participate-in-gathering-of-the-stars-show-choir-competition_20161118083437967/169413502|title=15 schools participate in 'Gathering of the Stars' show choir competition|last=LAKANA|date=2015-03-08|newspaper=WKBT|access-date=2017-02-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of the vast difference in sizes of the competitions, they can last a single afternoon or span an entire weekend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.showchoir.com/events/event.php?id=2181|title=SCC: Sullivan Show Choir Invitational (Day Two) 2016|website=www.showchoir.com|access-date=2017-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Competitions may separate competing choirs into different divisions. These divisions are often determined by age, skill level, size of the school or choir, and/or gender of the participants.  The different divisions may take place at a different time, day, or at a different location or venue, though usually within the same school or close geographic area.  There are three main divisions: Varsity (or Open), Unisex, and Prep (or Class A)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.showchoir.com/events/event.php?id=2658|title=SCC: New London Center Stage Invitational 2017|website=www.showchoir.com|access-date=2017-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Large Group, Small Group, and Unisex. Within each division, there may be different subsections based on the size of the group, the size of the choir, or how successful the choir has been. Largely, the decision of where to place a choir is made by the director of the competing choir.

Show choir sets can be presented in a multitude of ways from the more traditional approach to ultra theatrical performances that tell full length stories. These performances done by choirs, or "sets," are created by the choir's school director and possibly outside performing arts professionals. As this art form has grown, more schools have attempted to create quality performances that can be compared to professional shows.

Many competitions include a preliminary round and a finals found.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.showchoir.com/events/event.php?id=2147|title=SCC: Homestead Classic Showcase 2016|website=www.showchoir.com|access-date=2017-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The finals round commences after the preliminary awards are complete, where the top groups perform again in order to compete for the title of Grand Champion of the contest. The number of performing groups in the finals round is up to the hosting school, but typically 5-6 choirs participate. Those groups are sometimes given the opportunity to take suggestions, either from scoring judges or separate experts called in to give suggestions made during the preliminary round, and make adjustments to their finals performance in order to earn a better score. Hosting schools do not compete in the competition for ethical purposes.

The adjudicators, usually called judges, at almost any competition are experts in the show choir field. Often they are directors from other choirs, choreographers, arrangers or performers from Broadway-style musicals. The judging is subjective and is based on the scoring style selected by the hosts with some competitions placing more emphasis on strictly choral aspects, while others incorporate more emphasis on the entire show including the choreography, band, and show design. Depending on the competition, the judges may only judge in their area of expertise (a choir director judging vocals, while a choreographer judging dance), or they may judge everything. Additionally, a separate judge may be added to the panel to judge the bands, and/or to select outstanding performers for separate awards.

During competitions there are also individual, or solo, competitions. They take place during the competition, and they take place in a different area than the main competition. Winners are announced, and they may perform at the start of the nighttime finals performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wxow.com/story/37208199/2018/01/Saturday/show-choir-students-shine-at-14th-annual-viterbo-101-competition|title=Show choir students shine at 14th annual Viterbo 101 competition|last=Walker|first=Allante|access-date=2018-05-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.onalaska.k12.wi.us/schools/high/activities/Classic%20Flow%20of%20Show%202018%20for%20PUBLIC.pdf|title=Onalaska Show Choir Classic 2018|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

==Characteristics of a performance==
[[File:Show choir.jpg|alt=A show choir competing on stage in 2017.|thumb|[[Abraham Lincoln High School (Des Moines, Iowa)|Des Moines Lincoln High School]] performing in 2017.]]
Most show choir "shows" or "sets" consist of a variety of songs, often including several choreographed, fast-paced pieces and one slower piece performed with limited or no choreography.  This slower number—usually a ballad—exists primarily to showcase the ensemble's singing ability.  In California, it is a requirement that at least one minute of any one set be sung [[a cappella]] (it is usually one full song in the set), though this is not a standard in the rest of the country.  More often than not, the a cappella selection is also the ballad, as it is much easier to sing unaccompanied while holding relatively still. In the Midwest, it is becoming popular to set one song aside as a "novelty" piece, designed to make the audience laugh.  "Concept" or "story" shows that unify all of the songs together in a common theme are becoming more popular across the country, especially in California.

Within a song, vocal lines typically alternate between unison or octave singing, and two-or-more-part [[polyphonic]] harmony.  Songs are chosen, adapted, and arranged from a variety of sources including popular music, jazz standards, and Broadway musicals, but rarely make use of [[classical music]].  Original music has also been performed by a small number of groups.  Additionally, there is often at least one [[Solo (music)|solo]] in each performance by a standout singer in the group.

Competitive performance sets range in length, but are usually timed to total between fifteen and twenty-five minutes. Shows generally consist of, but are not limited to, approximately five songs.

==Popularity==

Show choirs have seen a rise in popularity since the American television series, "[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]" was released. The television show is based around the workings of a fictional show choir.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Glee (TV Series 2009–2015)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1327801/plotsummary|accessdate=2017-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The television show does not accurately represent the environment of a real show choir.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://journaltimes.com/news/local/burlington-high-show-choir-members-say-it-s-not-quite/article_e222f58c-5d37-11e2-a526-0019bb2963f4.html|title=Burlington High show choir members say it's not quite like 'Glee'|last=Fox|first=Tessa|date=2013-01-12|work=Journal Times|access-date=2018-01-08|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional [[baseball]] player [[Kyle Schwarber]] participated in show choir when he was at [[Middletown High School (Ohio)|Middletown (Ohio) High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.si.com/mlb/photo/2016/10/25/chicago-cubs-world-series-fun-facts-mlb-playoffs#20|title=25 fun facts about the Chicago Cubs in the World Series|work=SI.com|access-date=2018-01-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commitment==
For many high school students, show choir is a large commitment that takes over a large part of a school year.  For some, show choir is part of the school curriculum and is a class taught during the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmcsweb.com/fine-arts/high-school/high-school-show-choir.asp|title=Show Choir|website=www.cmcsweb.com|access-date=2017-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For others, it is an extracurricular activity that requires practice to take place before or after school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lake.k12.fl.us/Page/10651|title=Extracurricular Activities / Show Choir|website=www.lake.k12.fl.us|language=en|access-date=2017-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Practices may begin as early as the summer for some, while other choirs don’t start until much later. The competitive season takes place from January until March or April, with competitions held across the country every weekend during that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.showchoir.com/events/|title=SCC: Events|website=www.showchoir.com|access-date=2017-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1708">'''Smoking concerts''' were live [[performance]]s, usually of [[music]], before an [[audience]] of men only, popular during the [[Victorian era]].  These social occasions were instrumental in introducing new musical forms to the public.  At these functions men would smoke and speak of politics while listening to live music.  These popular gatherings were sometimes held at hotels. The crews of HMS Curlew and HMS Hawkins attended a Smoker aboard USS Huron in Wei-hai-wei harbour, China, on 19 August 1921.

Although the concerts are now obsolete, the term continued and is used for student-organised variety performances, especially at [[Oxford University|Oxford]] and [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]]. Annual Smoking Concerts were held at [[Imperial College London]] into the 1980s and continue at [[Glasgow University Union]].

The saying "Booking for smoking concerts now" came into use at this time meaning that a person had recovered and was in the prime of health.  This saying is used in the works of writer [[P.G. Wodehouse]].{{cn|date=January 2018}}

The [[Liverpool Medical Students Society]] at the [[University of Liverpool School of Medicine]] still hold an annual smoking concert, a tradition going back 130 years. Each of the five year groups present a play annually.[http://www.lmssonline.co.uk/]

The '''Star Carr Pendant''' is a unique engraved shale pendant from the [[Mesolithic]] site of [[Star Carr]] in [[North Yorkshire]]. It has been described as the oldest Mesolithic art in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.york.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/2016/research/mesolithic-shale-pendant/ |title=11,000 year old pendant is earliest known Mesolithic art in Britain |date=25 February 2016 |publisher=University of York |accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
The pendant was found in 2015 by a team from the [[University of York]] during excavations led by [[Nicky Milner]].&lt;ref name='IA'&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Nicky Milner |author2=Michael Bamforth |author3=Gareth Beale |author4=Julian C.

==Description==
The pendant is sub-triangular in shape and measures 31&amp;nbsp;mm x 35&amp;nbsp;mm x 3&amp;nbsp;mm. ED-XRF (energy-dispersive [[X-ray fluorescence]]) was used to prove that it is made from shale. The front face is engraved with a series of parallel, incised lines which often cross each other. It has a perforation, made by drilling through from the engraved side at one of the lobes.&lt;ref name='IA' /&gt; 

On the reverse side to the engraving there is a nick caused by a missing flake of shale in the central region. This may have happened accidentally or intentionally, presumably by something hard striking this surface before it was deposited in the lake.&lt;ref name='IA' /&gt;

==Significance==
The pendant is unique and is the earliest example of [[Mesolithic]] art in Britain. Whilst it is very similar to a number of other pendants from northern European sites, this pendant is unique as it is made from shale, whereas the other examples tend to be crafted from amber. It is also one of the few decorated pendants that have been found within an archaeological context and not as a stray find. Analysis by the research team suggest that there are two phases of markings on the pendant, and that it is possible that more than one person added to it over time. Different interpretations from those who have seen the engravings have suggested that it may represent a tree, a map, a leaf, tally marks, even a representation of the wooden platforms which have been found at Star Carr.&lt;ref name='IA' /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/archaeology/stone-age-britons-may-have-had-prehistoric-secret-code-a6896596.html |title=Stone Age Britons may have had prehistoric secret code |author1=David Keys |date=26 February 2016 |newspaper=The Independent |accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Inspiration of Saint Matthew''''' (1602) is a painting by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Baroque]] master [[Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio|Caravaggio]]. Commissioned by the French Cardinal Matteo Contarelli, the canvas hangs in Contarelli chapel altar in the church of the French congregation [[San Luigi dei Francesi]] in [[Rome, Italy]]. It is one of three Caravaggio canvases in the chapel: hanging between the larger earlier canvases of ''[[The Martyrdom of Saint Matthew (Caravaggio)|The Martyrdom of Saint Matthew]]'', and ''[[The Calling of St Matthew (Caravaggio)|The Calling of Saint Matthew]]''. This was not an easy commission for Caravaggio, and at least two of the three paintings had to be either replaced or repainted to satisfy his patron, the [[Francesco Maria Del Monte|Cardinal Del Monte]]. 

It is instructive to compare the two versions of the latter painting to see how provocative and controversial Caravaggio was in his time. Unfortunately, the first, rejected, version of this theme was destroyed in [[World War II]], and we only have black and white and enhanced color reproductions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wga.hu/cgi-bin/highlight.cgi?file=html/c/caravagg/04/25conta.html&amp;find=matthew Web Gallery of Art]&lt;/ref&gt; In the first version, ''[[Saint Matthew and the Angel]]'', the angel stands close to [[Matthew the Evangelist]] personal space and engages in what appears more direct intervention than divine inspiration. The angel intertwines with the old man, apparently whispering inspiration into his ear. The rejected painting can be compared to the earlier Caravaggio canvas of the ''[[Rest on the Flight into Egypt (Caravaggio)|Rest on the Flight into Egypt]]''.

In the work featured on the altar, the angel belongs to an aerial and sublime dimension, enveloped in an encircling rippled sheet. The restless Matthew leans to work, as the angel enumerates for him the work to come. All is darkness but for the two large figures. Matthew appears to have rushed to his desk, his stool teetering into our space. His expression is sober.

It is thought the contemporary styles of Caravaggio and [[Annibale Carracci|Carracci]] were at odds with each other, and non overlapping. In this light it is instructive to compare and contrast a similar canvas, by Carracci's pupil, [[Giovanni Lanfranco]] presently in [[Piacenza]] as well as a painting on a similar theme by [[Rembrandt]].

'''''The Librarian''''' is an [[Oil painting|oil on canvas]] painting by [[Giuseppe Arcimboldo]] in the collection of [[Skokloster Castle]] in [[Sweden]].  It is thought to be a portrait of [[Wolfgang Lazius]], a humanist and historian who served [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s of the [[House of Habsburg]].&lt;ref name="KCE"/&gt;

Arcimboldo became official portraitist to Emperor [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] in 1562 and later to [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]] and [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]].&lt;ref name="TNC"&gt;{{cite book | chapter=Arcimboldo 1527&amp;ndash;1593: Nature &amp; Fantasy | chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ihmUGf5qOIIC&amp;pg=PA50 | title=[[The New Criterion]] | date=December 2010 | last=Greggs | first=Jeffrey | pages=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Librarian'' is one of a series of paintings by Arcimboldo of members of Maximilian's entourage.&lt;ref name="SC"/&gt;  Skokloster Castle dates the painting to 1562,&lt;ref name="SC"/&gt; though the painting is more often dated circa 1566.&lt;ref name="KCE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TNC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kriegeskorte2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaufmann2009"/&gt;

Arcimboldo created a number of portraits of people by painting an assemblage of objects such as fruits and vegetables, flowers, or in this case, books; the objects typically had some connection to the person's life or depiction. Benno Geiger called it a "triumph of [[abstract art]] in the 16th century".&lt;ref name="Kriegeskorte2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Werner Kriegeskorte|title=Arcimboldo. Ediz. Inglese|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JRdQzBJckdYC|year=2000|publisher=Taschen|isbn=978-3-8228-5993-3|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1957, art historian Sven Alfons was the first to conclude that this was specifically a portrait of Lazius.&lt;ref name="KCE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaufmann2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas DaCosta Kaufmann|title=Arcimboldo: Visual Jokes, Natural History, and Still-Life Painting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sRuI5laxCZIC&amp;pg=PA259|year=2009|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-42686-0|page=259}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The work has been interpreted as both a celebration and a satirical mocking of librarians and scholarship.  K. C. Elhard suggests that it may be specifically a parody of "materialistic book collectors more interested in acquiring books than in reading them."&lt;ref name="KCE"/&gt;

Elhard notes that ''The Librarian'' has become "a fixture in the visual history of the library profession".&lt;ref name="KCE"/&gt;  However, the original title, if any, is unknown, and its current title first appears (in Swedish as "Bibliotekarien") in an early 20th-century inventory.&lt;ref name="KCE"&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=25541905 | title=Reopening the Book on Arcimboldo's "Librarian" | author=Elhard, K.C. | journal=Libraries &amp; Culture |date=Spring 2005 | volume=40 | issue=2 | pages=115–127 | doi=10.1353/lac.2005.0027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Librarian'' is one of two works by Arcimbolodo in the collection of Skokloster Castle. The painting was brought to Sweden following the looting of [[Prague Castle]] by the Swedish army during the 1648 [[Battle of Prague (1648)|Battle of Prague]] and was owned by General [[Hans Christoff von Königsmarck]].&lt;ref name="SC"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://emuseumplus.lsh.se/eMuseumPlus?service=ExternalInterface&amp;module=collection&amp;objectId=32632&amp;viewType=detailView | title=Livrustkammaren och skoklosters slott med stiftelsen hallwylska museet: En myndighet tre museer | accessdate=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three other extant versions of the painting whose attributions are uncertain.&lt;ref name="KCE"/&gt;  A scientific study published in 2011 concluded that ''The Librarian'' was a later copy of Arcimbolodo's original painting, whose whereabouts are unknown.&lt;ref name="MakesBrunskog2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Frantisek Makes|author2=Maria Brunskog|title=Enzymatic Restoration and Authentication of Giuseppe Arcimboldo's "Vertumnus"|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QmJhtwAACAAJ|year=2011|publisher=Gotland University|isbn=978-91-86343-08-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trademark distinctiveness''' is an important concept in the law governing [[trademark]]s and [[service mark]]s. A trademark may be eligible for registration, or '''registrable''', if it performs the essential trademark function, and has '''distinctive character'''. Registrability can be understood as a continuum, with "inherently distinctive" marks at one end, "generic" and "descriptive" marks with no distinctive character at the other end, and "suggestive" and "arbitrary" marks lying between these two points. "Descriptive" marks must acquire distinctiveness through secondary meaning - consumers have come to recognize the mark as a source indicator - to be protectable. "Generic" terms are used to refer to the product or service itself and cannot be used as trademarks.

==The spectrum of distinctiveness==

In [[United States trademark law]], [[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. v. Hunting World]] 537 F.2d 4 (2nd Cir. 1976) established the [[spectrum]] of trademark distinctiveness in the US, breaking trademarks into classes which are accorded differing degrees of protection. Courts often speak of marks falling along the following "'''spectrum of distinctiveness'''," also known within the US as the "[[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch|Abercrombie]] classification" or "[[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch|Abercrombie]] factors":&lt;ref&gt;''[[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. v. Hunting World]]'' 537 F.2d 4 (2nd Cir. 1976)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inta.org/TrademarkBasics/FactSheets/Pages/TrademarksvsGenericTermsFactSheet.aspx |publisher=[[International Trademark Association]] |title=Trademarks vs. Generic Terms |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/a/abercrombie-classification |title=Abercrombie Classification Law &amp; Legal Definition |publisher=US Legal, Inc. |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fanciful marks===
A '''fanciful''' / '''inherently distinctive''' trademark is [[prima facie]] registrable, and comprises an entirely invented or "fanciful" sign. For example, "[[Kodak]]" had no meaning before it was adopted and used as a trademark in relation to goods, whether photographic goods or otherwise. Invented marks are [[neologism]]s which will not previously have been found in any [[dictionary]].

===Arbitrary marks===
An '''arbitrary''' trademark is usually a common word which is used in a meaningless context (e.g. "[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]" for computers). Such marks consist of words or images which have some dictionary meaning before being adopted as trademarks, but which are used in connection with products or services unrelated to that dictionary meaning. Arbitrary marks are also immediately eligible for registration. ''Salty'' would be an arbitrary mark if it used in connection with e.g. telephones such as in ''Salty Telephones'', as the term "[[salt]]" has no particular connection with such products.

===Suggestive marks===
A '''suggestive''' trademark tends to indicate the nature, quality, or a characteristic of the products or services in relation to which it is used, but does not describe this characteristic, and requires imagination on the part of the consumer to identify the characteristic. Suggestive marks invoke the consumer’s perceptive imagination. An example of a suggestive mark is [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]], a new technology of high-capacity data storage that utilizes a "blue" (actually [[Violet (color)|violet]]) [[laser]].

===Descriptive marks===
A '''descriptive''' mark is a term with a dictionary meaning which is used in connection with products or services directly related to that meaning. An example might be ''Salty'' used in connection with saltine crackers or anchovies. Such terms are not registrable unless it can be shown that distinctive character has been established in the term through extensive use in the [[marketplace]] (see further below). [[Lektronic]] was famously refused protection by the USPTO on the grounds of being descriptive for electronic goods.

===Generic terms===
{{Redirect|Generic term}}
A '''generic term''' is the common name for the products or services in connection with which it is used, such as "salt" when used in connection with sodium chloride. A generic term is not capable of serving the essential trademark function of distinguishing the products or services of a business from the products or services of other businesses, and therefore cannot be afforded any legal protection. This is because there has to be some term which may generally be used by anyone—including other manufacturers—to refer to a product without using some organization's proprietary trademark. Marks which become generic after losing distinctive character are known as [[genericized trademark]]s. Marks which are a misspelling of a generic term (e.g., the elimination of a space) do not change the generic significance of the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/com/sol/foia/ttab/other/2005/76219917.pdf|title= In re NetEnterprise, Inc., Serial No. 76219917|work=USPTO|language=en|date=2005-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thettablog.blogspot.com/2005/05/netenterprise-generic-for-internet.html|title='NETENTERPRISE' Generic For An Internet Business, Says TTAB|work=TTABlog|language=en|date=2005-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessing distinctiveness==
In trademark litigation, courts are most frequently asked to distinguish between ''suggestive'' and ''descriptive'' marks on the one hand, and between ''descriptive'' and ''generic'' marks on the other. This is because suggestive marks, like fanciful and arbitrary marks, are presumed to be entitled to trademark protection, while descriptive marks are entitled to protection if they have become known as representing the producer of the goods, and generic marks can never receive protection. It can be seen from the examples above that the distinctive character of a term is closely related to the products or services in relation to which the term is used.

A general method for assessing the distinctive character of a mark is to consider a consumer's reaction to a mark. The mark may only be inherently registrable if the consumer has never encountered the mark before. On the other hand, the mark is unlikely to be inherently registrable if it informs him about any characteristic of the relevant products or services (e.g. whether they are delicious, large, spicy, black, or sweet, in the case of fruit). In any other case the mark may not be registrable.

Another example of a descriptive mark would be a geographical word or phrase that merely indicates the origin of the product or service. For example, [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] based [[ice cream]] might find that the name "Houston ice cream" is denied trademark protection on the grounds that the word Houston is merely descriptive. However, they might have better luck with the name "North Pole ice cream". In the latter case, although North Pole is a geographical location, the ice cream is not actually made at the [[North Pole]], and no reasonable person would assume that the phrase North Pole is literally descriptive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.findlaw.com/12international/countries/nz/articles/482.html| publisher= Findlaw|title=Trading on a good name| first=Baldwin Shelston| last= Waters|author2=Angela Sutton |date=July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore marks that identify or describe a product or service, or that are in common use, or that are used as [[geographical indication]]s, generally cannot be registered as trademarks, and remain in the [[public domain]] for use by anyone. For example, a generic term such as "apple", or descriptive terms such as "red" or "juicy" could not be registered in relation to apples.

Primary consideration in the selection and use of trademarks should be given to marks which are inherently distinctive, as they possess the strongest distinctive character and do not require evidence of use to establish acquired distinctiveness. A fanciful, arbitrary, or suggestive term can be inherently distinctive and registrable without proof of acquired distinctiveness.
Although these categories are most easily applied in relation to trademarks comprising words, the same general principles are applied in relation to all kinds of trademarks. For example, a pine tree shape is descriptive when used on pine-scented products.

===Acquired distinctiveness===
A trademark with no distinctive character (i.e. a mark which is not inherently distinctive) is [[prima facie]] unregistrable. However, most jurisdictions may still allow such marks to be registered if the trademark owner can demonstrate, typically by reference to '''evidence of use''', that consumers in the marketplace exclusively associate the mark, as used on the identified goods or in connection with the identified services, with a particular commercial origin or source (i.e. the trademark owner). "Use" may include authorized use by a licensee or other party. If the trade marks office is satisfied that the evidence demonstrates that a mark has "acquired" distinctive character ''as a [[de facto|matter of fact]]'', then the mark may be accepted for registration on the basis of '''acquired distinctiveness'''.

The nature and extent of acceptable evidence of use varies between jurisdictions, although the most useful evidence usually includes sales figures, details of advertising and promotional expenditure, and examples of promotional material. Consumer surveys may also help establish that consumers chiefly associate an otherwise non-distinctive mark with the trademark owner and its products or services. Generally, evidence of use may only be acceptable or relevant if it covers a certain period of time (e.g. three years prior to the filing date of the trademark application) and originates from within the jurisdiction where registration is sought.

The terminology of acquired distinctiveness is accepted in the [[European Union]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] jurisdictions such as [[Australia]], [[Hong Kong]] and the [[United Kingdom]], and the common law jurisdiction of the [[United States]] (which also uses the term '''secondary meaning'''). In the U.S., if a trademark has been used for a continuous period of at least five years after the date of registration, the right to use the mark and the registration may become "incontestable" (e.g. invulnerable to cancellation for non-use, but not for becoming [[Genericized trademark|generic]]). In such cases the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|USPTO]] checks and confirms whether the request for incontestability meets formality requirements, but whether a registration is incontestable at law can only be determined during legal proceedings involving the registration.

The essential function of a trademark is to exclusively identify the commercial source or origin of products or services, such that a trademark, properly called, indicates source or serves as a badge of origin. The use of a trademark in this way is known as trademark use. Certain exclusive rights attach to a registered mark, which can be enforced by way of an action for trademark infringement, while unregistered trademark rights may be enforced pursuant to the common law tort of passing off.

It should be noted that trademark rights generally arise out of the use and/or registration (see below) of a mark in connection only with a specific type or range of products or services. Although it may sometimes be possible to take legal action to prevent the use of a mark in relation to products or services outside this range (e.g. for passing off), this does not mean that trademark law prevents the use of that mark by the general public. A common word, phrase, or other sign can only be removed from the public domain to the extent that a trademark owner is able to maintain exclusive rights over that sign in relation to certain products or services, assuming there are no other trademark objections. For a case study in both concepts, see Apple Corps and its disputes with Apple, Inc.

===Maintaining distinctiveness===
If a court rules that a trademark has become "[[genericized trademark|generic]]" through common use (such that the mark no longer performs the essential trademark function and the average consumer no longer considers that exclusive rights attach to it), the corresponding registration may also be ruled invalid.

For example, the [[Bayer]] company's trademark "[[Aspirin]]" has been ruled generic in the United States, so other companies may use that name for [[acetylsalicylic acid]] as well (although it is still a trademark in [[Canada]]). [[Xerox]] for photocopiers and [[Band-Aid]] for adhesive bandages are both trademarks which are at risk of succumbing to death by becoming declared generic in certain countries, something that the respective trademark owners actively seek to prevent. In order to prevent marks becoming generic, trademark owners often contact those who appear to be using the trademark incorrectly, from web page authors to dictionary editors, and request that they cease the improper usage.

The proper use of a trademark means using the mark as an [[adjective]], not as a [[noun]] or a [[verb]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.inta.org/index.php?option=com_simplefaq&amp;task=display&amp;Itemid=60&amp;catid=284&amp;page=1&amp;getcontent=1#FAQ75| publisher=[[International Trademark Association]]| title= How Do I Use a Trademark Properly?| work=Information and Publishing FAQ| accessdate=2006-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.3com.com/corpinfo/en_US/legal/trademark/prop_usage_tmb.html#1| title=Always Use a Trademark as an Adjective, Followed by the Appropriate Noun Descriptor(s)| publisher=3Com Legal| work=Trademarks and Brands| accessdate=2006-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.adobe.com/misc/trade.html| title=Permissions and trademark guidelines| publisher=Adobe| accessdate=2006-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000943.html | title=A Guide to Proper Trademark Use | author=Pullum, Geoffrey K.  | accessdate=2006-12-05 | work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; though for certain trademarks, use as nouns and, less commonly, verbs is common. For example, [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]] sent e-mails to many web authors using the term "[[photoshopped]]" telling them that they should only use the term "modified by Adobe® Photoshop® software."  Xerox has also purchased print advertisements declaring that "you cannot 'xerox' a document, but you can copy it on a Xerox Brand copying on machine." Another popular example is the use of the word "[[frappuccino]]" by [[Starbucks]] customers to mean any blended coffee beverage, though employees are instructed to only say "frappuccino blended coffee" or "frappuccino blended cream" when referring to such drinks. This rule is not hard-and-fast, however; for example, Lexis-Nexis has a U.S. trademark registration for "Shepardize," [http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&amp;entry=74120780 Reg. No. 1743711], and defines "Shepardizing on a [http://www.lexisnexis.com/infopro/zimmerman/disp.aspx?z=1930 web page] as "the process of looking up citations" in "a series of books called Shepard's Citations."  Such efforts may or may not be successful in preventing genericism in the long run, which depends less on the mark owner's efforts and more on how the public actually perceives and uses the mark. In fact, legally it is more important that the trademark holder visibly and actively seems to attempt to prevent its trademark from becoming generic, regardless of real success.{{cn|date=January 2016}}

'''''Trouble''''' is a free independent monthly magazine for the promotion of visual and performing arts and culture. ''Trouble Magazine'', a company that is co-directed by artists Steve and Melissa Proposch, publishes and distributes the title in the [[AppStore]] and online at [http://www.troublemag.com/ troublemag.com].

==History and profile==
''Trouble'' was started in [[Newstead, Victoria|Newstead, Australia]], in 2004. The first issue featured a cover image of ''The Young Family'' (2002-3) by [[Patricia Piccinini]], which had been recently acquired by the [[Bendigo Art Gallery]]. The first magazine consisted of 16 black and white pages, and the 1,000 copies that were printed soon disappeared from around 50 chosen outlets around Bendigo and Castlemaine in central Victoria. In 2011 a CAB audit&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.auditbureau.org.au/about_cab.php Audit Bureaux of Australia – Circulations Audit Board]{{Failed verification|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the magazine’s circulation confirmed a figure of 20,000 free copies of ''Trouble'' being distributed nationally in Australia each month. ''Trouble'' magazine is edited and designed by Steve Proposch, and continues to publish contemporary material of particular interest to artists, performers and arts consumers.

In August 2013 ''Trouble'' developed an IOS app.&lt;ref&gt;[https://itunes.apple.com/app/id668359617?mt=8 Trouble magazine app]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Uchronia: The Alternate History List''' is an [[Online general-interest book databases|online general-interest book database]] containing a bibliography of [[alternate history]] novels, stories, essays and other printed material.  It is owned and operated by Robert B. Schmunk.  Uchronia was twice selected as the [[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci Fi Channel]]'s "Sci Fi Site of the Week."&lt;ref name=sf1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue62/site.html |title=Sci-Fi Site of the Week: Uchronia: The Alternate History List |accessdate=20 November 2008 |last=Berkwits |first=Jeff |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=SciFi.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513082304/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue62/site.html |archivedate=May 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sf2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue179/site.html |title=Sci-Fi Site of the Week: Uchronia: The Alternate History List |accessdate=20 November 2008 |last=McGowan |first=Matthew |coauthors= |date=2000-09-25 |work= |publisher=SciFi.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517173846/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue179/site.html |archivedate=May 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Uchronia catalogues and chronicles over 3300 published alternate history novels, short stories, anthologies, collections, series, as well as including reference material and works published in other languages. Entries indicate the original publication date, the [[point of divergence]] and a brief synopsis of the plot. A search mechanism that can identify works by author, keyword or language of publication/translation is also included.

Uchronia features a couple of real-world timelines: one devoted to alternate histories published before the [[Golden Age of Science Fiction]], and another offering a complex chronological outline of point of divergences of the entries.&lt;ref name=sf1 /&gt;

Uchronia contains large cover art gallery and links to [[Amazon.com]] in order to obtain the listed alternate history books.&lt;ref name=sf2 /&gt;

Uchronia also hosts the main website for the [[Sidewise Award for Alternate History]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uchronia.net/sidewise/ |title=The Sidewise Awards for Alternate History |accessdate=4 October 2018 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=Uchronia.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Vladimir Nazor Award''' ({{lang-hr|Nagrada Vladimir Nazor}}) is an annual award given by the [[Ministry of Culture (Croatia)|Croatian Ministry of Culture]] to Croatian artists for highest achievements in various artistic fields. It was established in 1959 and is named for poet [[Vladimir Nazor]]. {{As of|2016}}, the award is given in the following six categories:

*[[Architecture]] and [[urbanism]]
*[[Film]]
*[[Literature]]
*[[Music]]
*[[Theatre]]
*[[Visual arts]] and [[applied arts]]

Two awards are given in each category every year - a life achievement award (for overall contributions to their respective field) and an annual award (for notable works in the field in the past twelve months). The winners for the preceding year are announced every year on 19 June, the anniversary of Nazor's death.
