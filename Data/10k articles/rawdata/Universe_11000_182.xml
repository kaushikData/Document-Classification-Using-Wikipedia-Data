There exist two main hypothesis that explain the mechanism by which ultrasound induces [[vaporization]].&lt;ref name="UMBRSUG" /&gt;  One poses that the ultrasonic field interacts with the dispersed medium so as to cause vaporization in the bubble core.  The other suggests that shockwaves from [[Cavitation#Intertial cavitation|inertial cavitation]], occurring near or within the droplet, cause the dispersed medium to vaporize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kripfgans|first=Oliver D.|date=July 2004|title=On the acoustic vaporization of micrometer-sized droplets|journal=[[Journal of the Acoustical Society of America]]|volume=116|issue=1|pages=272–281|url=http://scitation.aip.org/journals/doc/JASMAN-ft/vol_116/iss_1/272_1.html|bibcode = 2004ASAJ..116..272K |doi = 10.1121/1.1755236 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="815">'''Aeromechanics''' is the science about mechanics that deals with the motion of air and other gases, involving [[aerodynamics]], [[thermophysics]] and [[aerostatics]]. It is the branch of mechanics that deals with the motion of gases (especially air) and their effects on bodies in the flow. The fluid flow and structure are interactive systems and their interaction is dynamic. The fluid force causes the structure to deform which changes its orientation to the flow and hence the resulting fluid force.

Areas that comprise this are within the [[technology]] of [[aircraft]] and [[helicopter]]s since these use [[Propeller (aircraft)|propellers]] and [[Helicopter rotor|rotors]].

==Education, early life and career==
Ubbelohde was born in [[Antwerp]], [[Belgium]], in 1907. He was educated at [[St Paul's School, London|St Paul's School]], 1920-1926 and at [[Christ Church, Oxford]], 1926-1930. He was senior scholar of Christ Church from 1931-1933. He then became a senior researcher in the Department of Thermodynamics at Oxford, 1933-1935. This was followed by excursions as a Dewar Fellow of the Royal Institution, London, 1936-1940 as Principal Experimental Officer at the Ministry of Supply, 1940-1945 and as Professor of Chemistry at [[Queen's University, Belfast]], 1945-1954. He was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1951.

In 1954, Ubbelohde became a professor of thermodynamics at [[Imperial College London]], a position he held until 1975. In 1961 he was awarded [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]]; from 1961 to 1975 he was the head of the Chemical Engineering Department at Imperial College; following this he was a senior research fellow at Imperial College from 1975-1988;

==Research==
Ubbelohde's research interests included chemical thermodynamics, combustion, explosions and detonations, ionic melts, graphite and intercalation compounds. His group was the first to synthesise [[Highly Oriented Pyrolytic Graphite|highly oriented pyrolytic graphite]] (HOPG). Over the course of his career, Ubbelohde wrote six books and some 400 publications. Ubbelohde was the chair of the [[Solvay Conference]]s on Chemistry (London), from 1959 to 1980. The Ubbelohde effect, which is the observation that dueteration increases hydrogen bond length, is named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ubbelohde|first=A. R.|author2=Gallagher, K.

'''''Bananas Unpeeled''''' is a 26 minute film shot in [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]], investigating the social and environmental issues faced by [[plantation]] workers and small farmers in the Caribbean.
It examines [[fair trade]] policies and labeling as a positive alternative for workers on plantations where harsh working conditions and environmental damage are the norm.

The film was made by independent film-maker [[Nick Shaw]] and introduced by the political activist and comedian [[Mark Thomas]].

This educational resource (the film and corresponding teacher action booklet) was quickly taken up by leading British [[NGO]]'s ([[OXFAM]], [[People &amp; Planet]]). Used extensively by schools, universities, [[trade union]] organisations, etc., it helped with the introduction of the "[[fair trade banana]]" into Great Britain.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} The [[The Co-operative Group|Co-Op UK supermarket chain]] was the first to introduce Fair trade Bananas into their stores. To date, several other supermarket chains have followed this example (e.g. [[Waitrose]], [[Sainsbury's]]).

The story behind the making of the film is mentioned in the 2008 book ''Fighting the Banana Wars and other Fairtrade Battles'' by Harriet Lamb, [[Order of the British Empire|C.B.E.]], director of the [[Fairtrade Foundation]] (UK).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lamb | first = Harriet | title = Fighting the Banana Wars and Other Fairtrade Battles | publisher = Rider &amp; Co | location = London | year = 2008 | isbn = 1-84604-083-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Calamander''' or '''coromandel''' is a valuable wood from [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. It is a hazel-brown color, with black stripes (or the other way about), very heavy and hard. It is also known as '''Macassar ebony''' or '''variegated ebony''' and is closely related to genuine [[ebony]], but is obtained from different species in the same genus; one of these is ''Diospyros quaesita'' [[George Henry Kendrick Thwaites|Thwaites]], from Sri Lanka. The name "calamander" comes from the local [[Sinhala language|Sinhalese]] name, ''kalu-medhiriya'', which means dark chamber, referring to the characteristic ebony black wood. It is used in [[furniture]], [[luthiery]] and for sculpture. 

Calamander has been logged to extinction over the last two to three hundred years and is no longer available for new work in any quantity. Furniture in calamander is so expensive and so well looked after that even recycling it is an unlikely source.{{cn|date=January 2018}} A substitute, Macassar ebony, has similar characteristics and to the untrained eye is nearly the same but it lacks the depth of colour seen in genuine calamander.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

'''Chayote'''&lt;ref name=GRIN/&gt; (''Sechium edule'') also known as '''mirliton squash''' is an edible [[plant]] belonging to the [[gourd]] family [[Cucurbitaceae]]. Chayote was one of the several foods introduced to the [[Old World]] during the [[Columbian Exchange]]. Also during this period, the plant spread from Mexico to other parts of the Americas, ultimately causing it to be integrated into the cuisine of many other Latin American nations.

The chayote fruit is mostly used cooked. When cooked, chayote is usually handled like summer squash; it is generally lightly cooked to retain the crispy consistency. Though rare and often regarded as especially unpalatable and tough in texture, raw chayote may be added to [[salad]]s or [[salsa (sauce)|salsa]]s, most often marinated with [[lemon]] or [[lime juice]]. Whether raw or cooked, chayote is a good source of [[vitamin C]].

Although most people are familiar only with the fruit as being edible, the root, stem, seeds and leaves are edible as well. The [[tubers]] of the plant are eaten like potatoes and other root vegetables, while the shoots and leaves are often consumed in salads and stir fries, especially in Asia.

== Etymology ==
The common English name is from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''chayote'', a derivative of the [[Nahuatl]] word ''chayohtli'' ({{IPA-nah|t͡ʃaˈjoʔt͡ɬi|pron}}).

== Cultivation ==
Like other members of the gourd family, chayote has a sprawling habit, and it should only be planted if there is plenty of room in the garden. The roots are also highly susceptible to rot, especially in containers, and the plant in general is finicky to grow. However, in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], it is an easily grown yard or garden plant, set on a [[chicken wire]] support or strung against a [[fence]].

== Taxonomy ==
The plant was first recorded by modern botanists in [[Patrick Browne|P. Browne]]'s 1756 work, the ''Civil and Natural History of Jamaica''.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Citation |last= Browne |first= Patrick |year= 1756 |title= Civil and Natural History of Jamaica |url= http://www.brunias.com/bookinfo.html#ref341 |accessdate= 2007-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Olof Swartz|Swartz]] included it in 1800 in its current genus ''[[Sechium]]''.

== Description ==
[[File:CutChayote.jpg|right|thumb|Cut chayote showing seed]]
In the most common variety, the fruit is roughly [[pear]]-shaped, somewhat flattened and with coarse wrinkles, ranging from 10 to 20&amp;nbsp;cm in length. It looks like a green pear, and it has a thin, green skin fused with the green to white flesh, and a single, large, flattened [[Endocarp|pit]]. Some varieties have spiny fruits. The flesh has a fairly bland taste, and a texture is described as a cross between a [[potato]] and a [[cucumber]]. 

The chayote vine can be grown on the ground, but as a climbing plant, it will grow onto anything, and can easily rise as high as 12 meters when support is provided. It has heart-shaped [[leaf|leaves]], 10–25&amp;nbsp;cm wide and tendrils on the stem. The plant bears male flowers in clusters and solitary female flowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Grubben, G.J.H.|year=2004|title=Plant resources of tropical Africa: Vegetables|publisher=Backhuys|isbn=978-90-5782-147-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6jrlyOPfr24C}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plant’s [[fruit]] is light green and elongated with deep ridges lengthwise.

== Culinary and medicinal uses ==

[[File:2013 Phat sayongte.jpg|thumb|upright|''Phat yot sayongte'': [[Thai language|Thai]] for stir-fried chayote shoots]]

The fruit does not need to be peeled to be cooked or fried in slices. It has a very mild flavor. It is commonly served with seasonings (e.g. salt, butter and pepper in Australia) or in a dish with other vegetables and/or flavorings. It can also be boiled, stuffed, mashed, baked, fried, or pickled in [[escabeche]] sauce. Both fruit and seed are rich in [[amino acid]]s and [[vitamin C]].&lt;ref name=Saade_p29&gt;Rafael Lira Saade. 1996 p.29&lt;/ref&gt; Fresh green fruit are firm and without brown spots or signs of sprouting; smaller fruit are usually more tender. Chayote can be sliced lengthwise and eaten using salad dressing dip. The seed is edible and tasty to some when served cold when dipped in dressing.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

The [[tuberous]] part of the [[root]] is starchy and eaten like a yam (can be fried). It can be used as pig or cattle fodder.

The leaves and fruit have [[diuretic]], [[cardiovascular]] and [[anti-inflammatory]] properties, and a tea made from the leaves has been used in the treatment of [[arteriosclerosis]] and [[hypertension]], and to dissolve [[kidney stones]].&lt;ref name=Saade_p29/&gt;

=== Americas ===
In [[Louisiana Creole cuisine|Louisiana Creole]] and [[Cajun]] cuisine, the fruit, known as ''mirliton'' (pronounced {{IPA-all|ˈmɜːlɪtɒn}})&lt;ref name="mirliton"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Collins English Dictionary - Complete &amp; Unabridged |title=mirliton |url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/mirliton |accessdate=31 August 2012 |edition=11th.}}&lt;/ref&gt; also spelled ''mirletons'' or ''merletons'' (plural—the ''r'' is often silent, e.g. Cajun ''me-lay-taw'' or urban Creole ''miʁl-uh-tɔ̃ns'')&lt;ref name="Louisiana"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mirlitons|publisher=Cooking Louisiana|url=http://www.cookinglouisiana.com/Articles/Mirletons.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a popular seasonal dish for the holidays, especially around Thanksgiving, in a variety of recipes.

Chayote is an important part of traditional diets across Mesoamerica, and can be found in a variety of dishes.

In [[Brazil]] (locally called chuchu) and other Latin American countries, it is breaded and fried, or used cooked in salads, soups and soufflés.

=== Asia ===
[[File:Chayotejf2122.JPG|thumb|Side dish with chayote tops ([[Philippines]])]]

In [[the Philippines]], the plant is known as ''sayote'' and is grown mostly in mountainous part of the country such as [[Benguet]] and parts of [[Cordillera Administrative Region]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stuart|first=Dr. Godofredo|title=Sayote|url=http://stuartxchange.com/Sayote.html|work=Philippines medicinal plants|publisher=Stuart Exchange|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chayote is used in many kinds of dishes such as soup (often as a substitute for [[Calabash|upo squash]]), stir-fried vegetables and [[chop suey]]. It was among the numerous vegetables, grains, and fruits introduced into the country via the [[Manila galleon trade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carillo|first1=Lovely A.|title=Mexican-Philippine link traced to cacao trading|url=http://mindanaodailymirror.com/mexican-philippine-link-traced-cacao-trading-36152/|website=Mindanao Daily|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Indonesia]], chayotes are called labu siam and widely planted for their [[shoot]]s and fruit. It's generally used in Sundanese food as "[[lalap]]" and one of ingredients for Sundanese cuisine called "[[sayur asem]]".

In [[Tamil Nadu]], South India, chayote is known as Maerakkai (மேரக்காய்)/chow-chow (சௌ சௌ) in Tamil and widely used in everyday cooking for recipes like "sambar", "kootu", "poriyal", "thuvayal", "chutney" and "mor-kulambu". Chow-Chow is the common name used in the markets.

In [[Burma/Myanmar]], the chayote is known as "Gurkha Thee or Gurkha fruit" ဂေါ်ရခါးသီး and is very cheap and popular.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

In [[China]], the chayote is known as the "Buddha's Hand Melon" ({{zh|c=佛手瓜|p=fó shǒu guā}}) or alternatively in Cantonese choko (cau1 kau4) 秋球 [lit. autumn ball], and is generally stir-fried. The common Australian and New Zealand word, choko, comes from the 19th century Cantonese market gardeners who introduced many vegetables into those countries.

In [[Taiwan]], and southern mainland China, chayotes are widely planted for their [[shoot]]s, known as ''lóng xü cài'' ([[Simplified Chinese]]: 龙须菜; [[Traditional Chinese]] 龍鬚菜), literally "dragon-whisker vegetable"). Along with the young [[leaves]], the shoot is a commonly consumed vegetable in the region.

In [[Thai cuisine]], the plant is known as ''sayongte'' ({{lang-th|ซายองเต้}}) or ''fak maeo'' ({{lang-th|ฟักแม้ว}}, literally meaning "[[Miao people|Miao]] melon"). It grows mainly in the mountains of northern Thailand. The young shoots and greens are often eaten stir-fried or in certain soups.

In [[Darjeeling]], [[India]] and [[Nepal]], the plant and fruit is called ''ishkus'' (इस्कुस in [[Nepali language|Nepali]]), probably derived from the word squash. Its shoots, fruit and roots are widely used for different varieties of curries.

In the Indian state of [[West Bengal]], it is generally known as ''Squash'' (স্কোয়াশ). The whole vegetable is used to make curries, or it is sauteed. It is also cooked with fish, eggs or mutton. It is largely eaten during the [[Climate of West Bengal#Summer|summer]] and [[Climate of West Bengal#Rainy|rainy season]]  as it contains lots of water and is a good source of vitamin C. The young branches are also considered for making items as ''saag'' or can be added into preparing the Shukto. There are two varieties available; dark green and light green. The dark green variety is much more tender than the lighter one, which develops a fibrous texture around its seed if harvested or consumed lately.

In [[Karnataka]], South India, Chayote is popularly referred to as "seeme badanekaayi" (ಸೀಮೆ ಬದನೇಕಾಯಿ) in [[Kannada]] or "Bangalore brinjal (Bengaluru vankayya)"; "brinjal/eggplant/aubergine of the plateau".&lt;ref&gt;Yadav et al, [http://gbpihedenvis.nic.in/html/vol13_2/DIVERSITY.pdf DIVERSITY OF CUCURBITACEOUS CROPS IN NORTH EASTERN REGION] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821015751/http://gbpihedenvis.nic.in/html/vol13_2/DIVERSITY.pdf |date=August 21, 2014 }} ENVIS Bulletin Vol 13(2) : Himalayan Ecology&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in vegetable stews like "sambar" and "palya".

In [[Réunion]], the French overseas territory in the [[Indian Ocean]] near [[Mauritius]], chou chou, as it is known, is served in many dishes especially in the highlands. A popular starter of Chou chou au Gratin (baked with a cheese sauce), as a side with a meal and even as a dessert.

In [[Mauritius]], it is called sousou and is cultivated in the high plateau of the island. Mixed with beef, pork or chicken chou chou is widely used to make delicious steamed Chinese dumplings called niouk yen (boulette chou chou) or chow mai. These dumplings are very appreciated and can be found in restaurants and snacks all over the island. Stems and leaves are consumes in bouillon to accompany rice and other dishes. The chou chou is also consumed as pickle, salad, gratin, curry and sauté with beef, egg or chicken.

== Folklore ==
;"Apple pie"
In [[Australia]], where it is called ''choko'', a persistent [[urban legend]] is that [[McDonald's]] [[apple pie]]s were made of chayotes, not [[apple]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Are there chokos in McDonald's Apple Pies? |first=John |last=Rolfe |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/archive/money/are-there-chokos-in-mcdonalds-apple-pies/story-fn300aev-1225807413552 |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]] |date=December 6, 2009 |accessdate=August 21, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6RzBsBzaX?url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/archive/money/are-there-chokos-in-mcdonalds-apple-pies/story-fn300aev-1225807413552?nk=48b2ea27158c788f8875456d1884411f |archivedate=August 21, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This eventually led McDonald's to emphasise the fact that real apples are used in their pies. This legend was based on an earlier belief that tinned pears were often disguised chayotes. A possible explanation for the rumor is that there are a number of recipes in Australia that advise chayotes can be used in part replacement of canned apples to make the fruit go farther in making apple pies. This likely arose because of the economies of "mock" food substitutes during the [[Great Depression in Australia|Depression Era]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mindfood.com/at-secret-ingredient-the-outcast.seo|title=Food From the Source: "Secret Ingredient: the Outcast" article by Laura Venuto, Nov 19, 2010|work=MiNDFOOD|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121054552/http://www.mindfood.com/at-secret-ingredient-the-outcast.seo|archivedate=2010-11-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; shortages of canned fruit in the years following [[World War II]], and the fact apples do not grow in many tropical and subtropical parts of Australia, making them scarce. Chayotes, on the other hand, grow extensively in Australia, with many suburban backyards featuring chayote vines growing along their fence lines and outhouses.

;Mummies
Due to its purported cell-regenerative properties, it is believed as a contemporary legend that this fruit caused the mummification of people from the Colombian town of [[San Bernardo, Cundinamarca|San Bernardo]] who extensively consumed it. The very well preserved skin and flesh can be seen in the mummies today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-this-small-colombian-town-people-love-their-mummies-1443664421|title=In this small Colombian town people love their mummies|accessdate=September 3, 2018|website=wsj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Daniel McFarlan Moore''' (February 27, 1869 &amp;ndash; June 15, 1936) was a [[United States of America|U.S.]] electrical engineer and inventor. He developed a novel light source, the "Moore lamp", and a business that produced them in the early 1900s. The Moore lamp was the first commercially viable light-source based on gas discharges instead of incandescence; it was the predecessor to contemporary [[neon lighting]] and [[fluorescent lighting]].&lt;ref name=etheric&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Mr. Moore's Etheric Light.

== Early life ==
He was born in [[Northumberland, Pennsylvania]] on February 27, 1869. Moore was the son of the [[Reverend]] Alexander Davis and Maria Louisa Douglas Moore. He graduated from [[Lehigh University]] in 1889.&lt;ref name=Cyclopedia&gt;{{cite book |title=The National Cyclopedia of American Biography: Volume 13 |year=1906 |publisher=J. T.

He was Daniel McFarlan Moore, 58, known well wherever electrical technicians congregate, but little elsewhere. Graduated from Lehigh University in 1889 he at once found work with Thomas Alva Edison's Edison Co. Later he organized his own light and electric companies and, after 18 years, sold them to General Electric. Four years ago he invented vacuum bulbs used in telephotography (sending still pictures by electricity or radio); three years ago he improved the bulb so that it would transmit moving pictures. His present researches seek to make lamps that will give light without heat. Towards that goal he has made some progress. On his inventions the Government has granted 100 patents. His home is at East Orange, N. J., not far from that of Mr. Edison.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore married Mary Alice Elliott, of New York City, on June 5, 1895. They had three children: Dorothy Mae Moore, (born 1900); Elliott McFarlan Moore (1902–1933); and Beatrice Jean Moore, (born 1912).

==Career==
He began his career in 1890 working in the engineering department of the United Edison Manufacturing Company.&lt;ref name=Cyclopedia /&gt; At some point he started experimenting with producing light from [[glow discharge]]s, which [[Heinrich Geissler]] had first developed in the 1850s.  "What’s wrong with my light?" [[Thomas Edison]] is said to have asked when he learned that Moore had started to tinker with light-producing tubes of gas as a potential replacement for the incandescent bulb. Moore is reported to have replied undiplomatically, "It’s too small, too hot and too red."&lt;ref name=SI&gt;{{cite web |title=Lamp Inventors 1880-1940: Moore Lamp |publisher=The Smithsonian Institution |url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/lighting/bios/moore.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore left in 1894 to form his own companies, the Moore Electric Company and the Moore Light Company.&lt;ref name=Bright&gt;{{cite book |title=The Electric-Lamp Industry |year=1949 |last=Bright, Jr. |first=Arthur A. |publisher=MacMillan |pages=221–223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Moore lamp===
[[Image:MooreTubes Newark1904.jpg|thumb|right |1904 photograph illustrating interior lighting by the first installation of Moore tubes in a hardware store in Newark, New Jersey. |alt=Photograph of a long narrow room taken from one end of the room. Open cabinets are hung on the walls for merchandise; there is a long counter that runs the length of the room. The room is illuminated by a long, glowing glass tube that rings the room and hangs a few feet down from the ceiling.]]
Moore had devised his glow discharge lighting system by 1896.&lt;ref name=etheric/&gt; The Moore Lamp was an extension of the well-known [[Geissler tube]], which used glass tubes from which the air had been removed and a different gas inserted. The low-pressure gas glows when a current is passed through it. As described in 1915, "In the Moore system of lighting the essential feature is the introduction of a special valve which automatically admits gas into the tube as the supply becomes exhausted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Modern illuminants and illuminating engineering |last1=Gaster |first1=Leon |last2=Dow |first2=John Stewart |year=1915 |publisher=Whittaker &amp; Co. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jVVDAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA107 |pages=107–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Moore lamps utilized nitrogen or carbon dioxide as the luminous gas; Moore's innovation compensated for the gradual loss of gas in the lamp to the electrodes and the glass. Carbon dioxide gave a good quality white light. The first commercial installation was done in 1904 in a hardware store in Newark, New Jersey.&lt;ref name=Bright /&gt; The lamp yielded about 10 lumens per watt, which was about triple the output of incandescent lights based on carbon filaments.&lt;ref name=SI /&gt; Arthur Bright has written, "Despite the fact that the tube was expensive to install, complicated, and required very high voltages, its operating advantages were great enough for it to find restricted use in stores, offices, and similar general lighting uses as well as in photography and some advertising and decorative applications."&lt;ref&gt;D. F. Moore, Vacuum-Tube Lighting, [https://books.google.com/books?id=poHOAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA445 Cassier's Magazine], Vol. XXVI, No. 5 (Sept. 1904); pages 445-454; includes several photos.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bright /&gt;

The modest success of the Moore tubes was among the drivers for developing better filaments for standard incandescent light bulbs. Tungsten filament bulbs were a sufficient improvement over carbon filaments that the Moore tubes "gradually disappeared from the market, leaving only short carbon-dioxide tubes in use for color matching, in which they excelled because of their daylight color. The General Electric Company absorbed the two Moore companies and Moore's patents in 1912. Moore himself rejoined General Electric's laboratory force."&lt;ref name=Bright /&gt;

===Miniature neon lamp===

Inside the left capsule, the right electrode is glowing orange. In the middle capsule, the left electrode is glowing. In the right capsule, both electrodes are glowing.]]
Moore's inventions at General Electric included a miniature [[neon lamp]] that remained a fixture in electronic displays throughout the twentieth century, and was a forerunner of [[plasma displays]]. Both the lamp and his further inventions were also important to the early development of television. In particular, around 1917 Moore developed a "negative glow" neon lamp.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref patent| country=US |number=1316967 |status=patent |title=Gaseous Conduction Lamp |pubdate= |gdate=1919-09-23 |fdate=1917-11-30 |pridate= |invent1=Daniel McFarlan Moore |assign1=General Electric Company }}&lt;/ref&gt; These were miniature lamps with a very different design than the much larger neon tubes used for [[neon lighting]]; a Smithsonian Institution website notes, "These small, low power devices use a physical principle called "coronal discharge." Moore mounted two electrodes close together in a bulb and added neon or argon gas. The electrodes would glow brightly in red or blue, depending on the gas, and the lamps lasted for years. Since the electrodes could take almost any shape imaginable, a popular application has been fanciful decorative lamps. Glow lamps found practical use as indicators in instrument panels and in many home appliances until the acceptance of [[light-emitting diode]]s (LEDs) in the 1970s."&lt;ref name=SI /&gt; In 1924 he invented the vacuum bulbs used in telephotography, and in 1925 improved it for use in television.&lt;ref name=Time /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Fielding |editor1-first=Raymond |title=A technological history of motion pictures and television: an anthology from the pages of the Journal of the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers |publisher=University of California Press |year=1979 |page=233 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=86JXA-G2ovsC&amp;pg=PA233 |chapter=Historical Sketch of Televisions Progress |last=Lankes |first=L.

Moore was awarded the John Scott Medal of [[The Franklin Institute]] in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Franklin Laureate Database |url=http://www.fi.edu/winners/detail.faw?winner_id=3543 |accessdate=2010-11-20 |quote=D.

==Death==
On June 15, 1936, at the age of 67, Moore was shot to death on the lawn of his home in [[East Orange, New Jersey]], by an unemployed inventor who became enraged after finding that an invention he filed for was already the subject of a patent granted to Moore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Inventor Is Slain Near Jersey Home. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1936/06/16/archives/inventor-is-slain-near-jersey-home-footprint-a-clue-dm-moore.html |quote= Footprint A Clue.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2410">A '''depauperate ecosystem''' is one which is lacking in numbers or variety of species, often because it lacks enough stored chemical elements required for life. Thus, depauperate [[ecosystem]]s often cannot support rapid growth of flora and fauna, high [[biomass]] density, and high [[biological diversity]].&lt;ref&gt;"Environmental Science: Earth as a Living Planet", Daniel B. Botkin, Edward A. Keller, Fifth Edition, p. 186, {{ISBN|978-0-470-91781-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[urchin barren]] is an example of a depauperate ecosystem.

An ecosystem is a biological community of interaction organisms and their actual physical environment. In Ecology, depauerate is an area that is so poor in species quantities and diversity. It lacks in numbers or a variety of species. Basically, a plant or animal is imperfectly developed. The reasons why there are depauperate areas are because the species do not have many competitors to fight with. Also, they have fewer resources causing the species not to survive without any protein or nutrients. Because these species lack the basic life necessities that they need, it’s hard for them to continue to carry on with life. ( The ecology of Adaptive Radiation). Therefore they aren’t reproducing the way that they are supposed to. In some cases, the species will actually start inbreeding. And because of that there are the same species everywhere. Therefore, competing with themselves, which can cause them to die. So, the area ends up falling short of the natural developmental size.

An example of a depauerate ecosystem is the growth of flora. This ecosystem cannot support the rapid growth of flora because it's in a severely diminished area. On top of that, the flora cannot grow because of the young geological age of the island. ( Primate Behavioral Ecology). Since the species aren’t alive anymore, they have turned into fossils. Apparently, you will find a lot of fossils in a depauperate area. You will find multiple fossils because there was a lack of stored chemical elements that were required for the life of the species.

[[File:Metra Locomotive EMD F40PHM-2.jpg|thumb|This [[Metra]] [[EMD F40PHM-2]] [[locomotive]] uses a diesel–electric transmission designed by [[Electro-Motive Diesel]]]]
A '''diesel–electric transmission''', or '''diesel–electric powertrain''', is used by a number of vehicle and ship types for providing [[Motion (physics)|locomotion]].

A diesel–electric transmission system includes a [[diesel engine]] connected to an [[electrical generator]], creating [[electricity]] that powers [[electric motor|electric]] [[traction motor]]s. No [[clutch]] is required. Before diesel engines came into widespread use, a similar system, using a [[petrol engine|petrol (gasoline) engine]] and called [[petrol–electric]] or gas–electric, was sometimes used. 

Diesel–electric transmission is used on railways by [[diesel electric locomotive]]s and [[DEMU|diesel electric multiple units]], as electric motors are able to supply full [[torque]] at 0 RPM. Diesel–electric systems are also used in submarines and surface ships and some land vehicles.

In some high-efficiency applications, electrical energy may be stored in [[rechargeable batteries]], in which case these vehicles can be considered as a class of [[hybrid electric vehicle]].

==Ships==

[[File:Siemens Schottel Propulsor.jpg|right|thumb|[[Siemens AG|Siemens]] [[Schottel Gmbh|Schottel]] [[azimuth thruster]]s]]
[[File:USCGC Healy (WAGB-20) north of Alaska.jpg|thumb|[[USCGC Healy (WAGB-20)|USCGC Healy]] uses a diesel–electric propulsion system designed by [[GEC Alsthom]]]]
The first diesel [[motorship]] was also the first diesel–electric ship, the Russian tanker ''[[Vandal (tanker)|Vandal]]'' from [[Branobel]], which was launched in 1903. [[Turbo-electric transmission|Steam turbine–electric]] propulsion has been in use since the 1920s ({{sclass-|Tennessee|battleship}}s), using diesel–electric powerplants in surface ships has increased lately. The [[Finland|Finnish]] [[coastal defence ship]]s ''[[Finnish coastal defence ship Ilmarinen|Ilmarinen]]'' and ''[[Finnish coastal defence ship Väinämöinen|Väinämöinen]]'' laid down in 1928–1929, were among the first surface ships to use diesel–electric transmission. Later, the technology was used in diesel powered [[icebreaker]]s.

In World War II the United States built diesel–electric surface warships. Due to machinery shortages [[destroyer escort]]s of the {{sclass-|Evarts|destroyer escort|5}} and {{sclass-|Cannon|destroyer escort|4}}es were diesel–electric, with half their designed horsepower (The {{sclass-|Buckley|destroyer escort|5}} and {{sclass-|Rudderow|destroyer escort|4}}es were full-power steam turbine–electric).&lt;ref name="Silverstone"&gt;{{cite book |last=Silverstone |first=Paul H |year=1966 |title=U.S. Warships of World War II |publisher=Doubleday and Company |pages=153–167 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{sclass-|Wind|icebreaker}}s, on the other hand, were designed for diesel–electric propulsion because of its flexibility and resistance to damage.&lt;ref&gt;Silverstone(66), page378&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USCG Icebreakers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscg.mil/history/webcutters/Icebreakers.asp|title=USCG Icebreakers|work=U.S. Coast Guard Cutter History|publisher=United States Coast Guard|accessdate=2012-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some modern diesel–electric ships, including [[cruise ships]] and icebreakers, use electric motors in pods called [[azimuth thruster]]s underneath to allow for 360° rotation, making the ships far more maneuverable. An example of this is [[MS Harmony of the Seas|''Harmony of the Seas'']], the largest passenger ship as of 2016.

[[Gas turbine]]s are also used for electrical power generation and some ships use a combination: ''[[Queen Mary 2]]'' has a set of diesel engines in the bottom of the ship plus two gas turbines mounted near the main funnel; all are used for generating electrical power, including those used to drive the propellers. This provides a relatively simple way to use the high-speed, low-torque output of a turbine to drive a low-speed propeller, without the need for excessive reduction gearing.

===Submarines===
{{See also|Submarine#Propulsion{{!}}Submarine propulsion}}
Early [[submarine]]s used a direct mechanical connection between the engine and propeller, switching between [[diesel engine]]s for surface running, and [[electric motor]]s for submerged propulsion. This was effectively a "parallel" type of hybrid, since the motor and engine were coupled to the same shaft. On the surface, the motor (driven by the engine) was used as a generator to recharge the batteries and supply other electric loads. The engine would be disconnected for submerged operation, with [[battery (electrical)|batteries]] powering the electric motor and supplying all other power as well.

True diesel–electric transmissions for submarines were first proposed by the United States Navy's [[Bureau of Steam Engineering|Bureau of Engineering]] in 1928; instead of driving the propeller directly while running on the surface, the submarine's diesel would instead drive a generator that could either charge the submarine's batteries or drive the electric motor. This meant that motor speed was independent of the diesel engine's speed, and the diesel could run at an optimum and non-critical speed, while one or more of the diesel engines could be shut down for maintenance while the submarine continued to run using battery power. The concept was pioneered in 1929 in the [[United States S class submarine|S-class submarines]] {{USS|S-3|SS-107|2}}, {{USS|S-6|SS-111|2}}, and {{USS|S-7|SS-112|2}} to test the concept. The first production submarines with this system were the [[United States Porpoise-class submarine|''Porpoise''-class]], and it was used on most subsequent US diesel submarines through the 1960s. The only other navy to adopt the system before 1945 was the British Royal Navy in the [[British U class submarine|U-class submarines]], although some submarines of the Imperial Japanese Navy used separate diesel generators for low-speed running.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Friedman | first = Norman | title = U.S. submarines through 1945: an illustrated design history | publisher = [[Naval Institute Press]] | year = 1995 | pages = 259–260 | url = | isbn = 1557502633 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a diesel–electric transmission arrangement, as used on 1930s and later [[US Navy]], German, Russian and other nations' diesel submarines, the propellers are driven directly or through [[gear|reduction gears]] by an [[electric motor]], while two or more [[diesel generator]]s provide electric energy for charging the batteries and driving the electric motors. This mechanically isolates the noisy engine compartment from the outer pressure hull and reduces the [[acoustic signature]] of the submarine when surfaced. Some [[nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear]] [[Nuclear submarine|submarines]] also use a similar [[turbo-electric]] propulsion system, with propulsion [[turbo generator]]s driven by reactor plant steam.

==Railway locomotives==
{{Main|Diesel–electric locomotive|Diesel electric multiple unit}}

During [[World War I]], there was a strategic need for rail engines without plumes of smoke above them. Diesel technology was not yet sufficiently developed but a few precursor attempts were made, especially for [[petrol–electric transmission]]s by the French (Crochat-Collardeau, patent dated 1912 also used for tanks and trucks) and British ([[Dick, Kerr &amp; Co.]] and [[British Westinghouse]]). About 300 of these locomotives, only 96 being standard gauge, were in use at various points in the conflict. Even before the war, the [[GE 57-ton gas-electric boxcab]] had been produced in the USA.

In the 1920s, diesel–electric technology first saw limited use in [[switcher]]s (or ''shunters''), locomotives used for moving trains around in railroad yards and assembling and disassembling them. An early company offering "Oil-Electric" locomotives was the [[American Locomotive Company]] (ALCO). The [[ALCO HH series]] of diesel–electric switcher entered series production in 1931. In the 1930s, the system was adapted for [[streamliner]]s, the fastest trains of their day. Diesel–electric powerplants became popular because they greatly simplified the way motive power [[Traction motor|was transmitted to the wheels]] and because they were both more [[fuel efficiency|efficient]] and had greatly reduced maintenance requirements. Direct-drive [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]]s can become very complex, considering that a typical locomotive has four or more [[axle]]s. Additionally, a direct-drive diesel locomotive would require an impractical number of gears to keep the engine within its powerband; coupling the diesel to a generator eliminates this problem. An alternative is to use a [[torque converter]] or [[fluid coupling]] in a direct drive system to replace the gearbox. Hydraulic transmissions are claimed to be somewhat more efficient than diesel–electric technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irimee.ac.in/dsl/know/alco_mech/transmission.doc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306044933/http://www.irimee.ac.in/dsl/know/alco_mech/transmission.doc |archivedate=2009-03-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diesel electric based buses have also been produced, including hybrid systems able to run on and store electrical power in batteries. The two main providers of hybrid systems for diesel–electric transit buses include [[Allison Transmission]] and [[BAE Systems]]. [[New Flyer Industries]], [[Gillig Corporation]], and [[North American Bus Industries]] are major customers for the Allison EP hybrid systems, while [[Orion Bus Industries]] is a major customer for the BAE HybriDrive system.

===Military vehicles===
Diesel–electric propulsion has been tried on some [[military vehicle]]s, such as [[tank]]s. The prototype [[TOG1]] and [[TOG2]] super heavy tanks of the Second World War used twin generators driven by V12 diesel engines.  More recent prototypes include the [[Splitterskyddad EnhetsPlattform|SEP modular armoured vehicle]] and [[T-95|T95e]]. Future tanks may use diesel–electric drives to improve fuel efficiency while reducing the size, weight and noise of the power plant.&lt;ref&gt;"Electric/Hybrid Electric Drive Vehicles for Military Applications", Military Technology (Moench Verlagsgesellschaft mbH) (9/2007): 132–144, September 2007, pp. 132–144&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts with diesel–electric drives on wheeled military vehicles include the unsuccessful [[ACEC Cobra]], [[Future Combat Systems Manned Ground Vehicles|MGV]], and [[XM1219 Armed Robotic Vehicle]].

The '''electron neutrino''' ({{SubatomicParticle|Electron neutrino}}) is a [[subatomic particle|subatomic]] [[lepton]] [[elementary particle]] which has no net [[electric charge]]. Together with the [[electron]] it forms the first [[generation (physics)|generation]] of leptons, hence the name electron [[neutrino]]. It was first hypothesized by [[Wolfgang Pauli]] in 1930, to account for [[conservation of momentum|missing momentum]] and [[conservation of energy|missing energy]] in [[beta decay]], and was discovered in 1956 by a team led by [[Clyde Cowan]] and [[Frederick Reines]] (see [[Cowan–Reines neutrino experiment]]).&lt;ref name=LAS&gt;

==Proposal==
In the early 1900s, theories predicted that the electrons resulting from [[beta decay]] should have been emitted at a specific energy. However, in 1914, [[James Chadwick]] showed that electrons were instead emitted in a continuous spectrum.&lt;ref name=LAS/&gt;

:&lt;small&gt;The early understanding of beta decay&lt;/small&gt;

In 1930, [[Wolfgang Pauli]] theorized that an undetected particle was carrying away the observed difference between the [[conservation of energy|energy]], [[conservation of momentum|momentum]], and [[conservation of angular momentum|angular momentum]] of the initial and final particles.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;[[Niels Bohr]] was notably opposed to this interpretation of beta decay and was ready to accept that energy, momentum and angular momentum were not conserved quantities.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

:&lt;small&gt;Pauli's version of beta decay&lt;/small&gt;

===Pauli's letter===
On 4 December 1930, Pauli wrote a letter to the Physical Institute of the [[Federal Institute of Technology]], [[Zürich]], in which he proposed the electron neutron as a potential solution to solve the problem of the continuous beta decay spectrum. An excerpt of the letter reads:&lt;ref name=LAS/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Dear radioactive ladies and gentlemen,

As the bearer of these lines [...] will explain more exactly, considering the 'false' statistics of [[Nitrogen-14|N-14]] and [[Lithium-6|Li-6]] nuclei, as well as the continuous ''&amp;beta;''-spectrum, I have hit upon a desperate remedy to save the "exchange theorem" of statistics and the energy theorem. Namely [there is] the possibility that there could exist in the nuclei electrically neutral particles that I wish to call neutrons,&lt;ref group=nb&gt;See ''[[Electron neutrino#Name|Name]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; which have spin 1/2 and obey the [[Pauli exclusion principle|exclusion principle]], and additionally differ from [[photon|light quanta]] in that they do not travel with the velocity of light: The mass of the neutron must be of the same order of magnitude as the electron mass and, in any case, not larger than 0.01 proton mass. The continuous ''&amp;beta;''-spectrum would then become understandable by the assumption that in ''&amp;beta;'' decay a neutron is emitted together with the electron, in such a way that the sum of the energies of neutron and electron is constant.

[...]

But I don't feel secure enough to publish anything about this idea, so I first turn confidently to you, dear radioactives, with a question as to the situation concerning experimental proof of such a neutron, if it has something like about 10 times the penetrating capacity of a [[gamma ray|''&amp;gamma;'' ray]].

I admit that my remedy may appear to have a small ''a priori'' probability because neutron, if they exist, would probably have long ago been seen. However, only those who wager can win, and the seriousness of the situation of the continuous ''&amp;beta;''-spectrum can be made clear by the saying of my honored predecessor in office, [[Peter Debye|Mr. Debye]], [...] "One does best not to think about that at all, like the new taxes." [...] So, dear radioactives, put it to test and set it right. [...]

With many greetings to you, also to [[Ernst Emil Alexander Back|Mr. Back]], your devoted servant,

:W. Pauli&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A translated reprint of the full letter can be found in the September 1978 issue of ''[[Physics Today]]''.&lt;ref&gt;

==Discovery==
{{Main|Cowan–Reines neutrino experiment}}

The electron neutrino was discovered by [[Clyde Cowan]] and [[Frederick Reines]] in 1956.&lt;ref name=LAS/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

==Name==
Pauli originally named his proposed light particle a ''neutron''. When [[James Chadwick]] discovered a much more massive nuclear particle in 1932 and also named it a [[neutron]], this left the two particles with the same name. [[Enrico Fermi]], who developed the theory of [[beta decay]], introduced the term ''[[neutrino]]'' in 1934 (it was jokingly coined by [[Edoardo Amaldi]] during a conversation with Fermi at the Institute of physics of via Panisperna in Rome, in order to distinguish this light neutral particle from Chadwick's neutron) to resolve the confusion. It was a [[pun]] on [[wikt:neutrone|neutrone]], the [[Italian language|Italian]] equivalent of ''neutron'': the ''-one'' ending can be an [[augmentative#Italian|augmentative]] in Italian, so ''neutrone'' could be read as the "large neutral thing"; ''-ino'' replaces the augmentative suffix with a [[diminutive#Italian|diminutive]] one.

Upon the prediction and discovery of a second neutrino, it became important to distinguish between different types of neutrinos. Pauli's neutrino is now identified as the ''electron neutrino'', while the second neutrino is identified as the ''[[muon neutrino]]''.

==Electron antineutrino==
The electron neutrino has a corresponding [[antiparticle]], the electron [[antineutrino]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Electron antineutrino}}),  which differs only in that some of its properties have [[additive inverse|equal magnitude but opposite sign]]. One open question of particle physics is whether or not neutrinos and anti-neutrinos are the same particle in which case it would be a [[Majorana fermion]] or whether they are different particles in which case they would be [[Dirac fermion]]s. They are produced in [[beta decay]] and other types of [[weak interaction]]s.

[[File:Inside of the electrostatic precipitator.jpg|thumb|Electrodes inside electrostatic precipitator]]
[[File:Collection electrode of electrostatic precipitator in waste incineration plant in Gdansk.jpg|thumb|Collection electrode of an electrostatic precipitator in a waste incineration plant]]
An '''electrostatic precipitator''' ('''ESP''') is a filtration device that removes fine particles, like dust and smoke, from a flowing gas using the force of an induced [[electrostatic charge]] minimally impeding the flow of gases through the unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=electrostatic precipitator|file=E02028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to [[wet scrubber]]s which apply energy directly to the flowing fluid medium, an ESP applies energy only to the particulate matter being collected and therefore is very efficient in its consumption of energy (in the form of electricity).{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

== Invention of the electrostatic precipitator ==
The first use of [[corona discharge]] to remove particles from an aerosol was by Hohlfeld in 1824.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ali |last=Farnoud |title=Electrostatic Removal of Diesel Particulate Matter |publisher=ProQuest |year=2008
|isbn=0549508163 |page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was not commercialized until almost a century later.

In 1907 [[Frederick Gardner Cottrell]], a professor of chemistry at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], applied for a patent on a device for charging particles and then collecting them through [[electrostatic]] attraction—the first electrostatic precipitator. Cottrell first applied the device to the collection of [[sulfuric acid|sulphuric acid]] mist and [[lead oxide]] fumes emitted from various acid-making and [[smelting]] activities.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick G. Cottrell, Art of separating suspended particles from gaseous bodies, {{US patent|895729}}, granted Aug. 11, 1908&lt;/ref&gt; Wine-producing [[vineyards]] in northern California were being adversely affected by the lead emissions.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

At the time of Cottrell's invention, the theoretical basis for operation was not understood. The operational theory was developed later in Germany, with the work of Walter Deutsch and the formation of the Lurgi company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.geabischoff.com/bis/cmsdoc.nsf/WebDoc/webb84kc3 | title=Chronicle | publisher=GEA Bischoff | accessdate=25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cottrell used proceeds from his invention to fund scientific research through the creation of a foundation called [[Research Corporation]] in 1912, to which he assigned the patents. The intent of the organization was to bring inventions made by educators (such as Cottrell) into the commercial world for the benefit of society at large. The operation of Research Corporation is funded by royalties paid by commercial firms after commercialization occurs. Research Corporation has provided vital funding to many scientific projects: [[Robert H. Goddard|Goddard]]'s rocketry experiments, [[Ernest Lawrence|Lawrence]]'s [[cyclotron]], production methods for [[vitamin A|vitamins A]] and [[vitamin B1|B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]], among many others.

By a decision of the [[US Supreme Court]],{{when|date=May 2013}} the Corporation had to be split into several entities.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} The Research Corporation was separated from two commercial firms making the hardware: Research-Cottrell Inc. (operating east of the Mississippi River) and Western Precipitation (operating in the western states). The Research Corporation continues to be active to this day, and the two companies formed to commercialize the invention for industrial and utility applications are still in business as well.

[[Electrophoresis]] is the term used for migration of gas-suspended charged particles in a direct-current [[electrostatic field]]. Traditional [[cathode ray tube|CRT]] television sets tend to accumulate dust on the screen because of this phenomenon (a CRT is a direct-current machine operating at about 15 kilovolts).

== Plate precipitator ==
[[File:Electrostatic precipitator.svg|right|thumb|Conceptual diagram of an electrostatic precipitator]]
The most basic precipitator contains a row of thin vertical wires, and followed by a stack of large flat metal plates oriented vertically, with the plates typically spaced about 1&amp;nbsp;cm to 18&amp;nbsp;cm apart, depending on the application. The air stream flows horizontally through the spaces between the wires, and then passes through the stack of plates.

A negative voltage of several thousand [[volt]]s is applied between wire and plate. If the applied voltage is high enough, an electric [[corona discharge]] ionizes the air around the electrodes, which then ionizes the particles in the air stream.

The ionized particles, due to the [[electrostatic force]], are diverted towards the grounded plates. Particles build up on the collection plates and are removed from the air stream.

A two-stage design (separate charging section ahead of collecting section) has the benefit of minimizing ozone production,{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} which would adversely affect health of personnel working in enclosed spaces. For shipboard [[engine room]]s where [[gearbox]]es generate an [[oil mist]], two-stage ESP's are used to clean the air, improving the operating environment and preventing buildup of flammable oil fog accumulations. Collected oil is returned to the gear lubricating system.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

== Collection efficiency (''R'') ==

Precipitator performance is very sensitive to two particulate properties: 1) Electrical resistivity; and 2) [[Particle size distribution]]. These properties can be measured economically and accurately in the laboratory, using standard tests. Resistivity can be determined as a function of temperature in accordance with IEEE Standard 548. This test is conducted in an air environment containing a specified moisture concentration. The test is run as a function of ascending or descending temperature, or both. Data is acquired using an average ash layer[further explanation needed] electric field of 4 kV/cm. Since relatively low applied voltage is used and no sulfuric acid vapor is present in the test environment, the values obtained indicate the maximum ash resistivity.

In an ESP, where particle charging and discharging are key functions, resistivity is an important factor that significantly affects collection efficiency. While resistivity is an important phenomenon in the inter-electrode region where most particle charging takes place, it has a particularly important effect on the dust layer at the collection electrode where discharging occurs. Particles that exhibit high resistivity are difficult to charge. But once charged, they do not readily give up their acquired charge on arrival at the collection electrode. On the other hand, particles with low resistivity easily become charged and readily release their charge to the grounded collection plate. Both extremes in resistivity impede the efficient functioning of ESPs. ESPs work best under normal resistivity conditions.

Resistivity, which is a characteristic of particles in an electric field, is a measure of a particle's resistance to transferring charge (both accepting and giving up charges). Resistivity is a function of a particle's chemical composition as well as flue gas operating conditions such as temperature and moisture. Particles can have high, moderate (normal), or low resistivity.

Bulk resistivity is defined using a more general version of Ohm’s Law, as given in Equation ({{EquationNote|1}}) below:

  {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\vec E = {\rho}\, \vec j &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

  Where:
  ''E'' is the Electric field strength (V/cm);
  ''j'' is the Current density (A/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;); and
  ''ρ'' is the Resistivity (Ohm-cm)

A better way of displaying this would be to solve for resistivity as a function of applied voltage and current, as given in Equation ({{EquationNote|2}}) below:

  {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; \rho = \frac {AV} {Il} &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

  Where:

Resistivity is the electrical resistance of a dust sample 1.0&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in cross-sectional area, 1.0&amp;nbsp;cm thick, and is recorded in units of ohm-cm. A method for measuring resistivity will be described in this article. The table below, gives value ranges for low, normal, and high resistivity.

=== Dust layer resistance ===
Resistance affects electrical conditions in the dust layer by a potential electric field (voltage drop) being formed across the layer as negatively charged particles arrive at its surface and leak their electrical charges to the collection plate. At the metal surface of the electrically grounded collection plate, the voltage is zero, whereas at the outer surface of the dust layer, where new particles and ions are arriving, the electrostatic voltage caused by the gas ions can be quite high. The strength of this electric field depends on the resistance and thickness of the dust layer.

In high-resistance dust layers, the dust is not sufficiently conductive, so electrical charges have difficulty moving through the dust layer. Consequently, electrical charges accumulate on and beneath the dust layer surface, creating a strong electric field.

Voltages can be greater than 10,000 volts. Dust particles with high resistance are held too strongly to the plate, making them difficult to remove and causing rapping problems.

In low resistance dust layers, the corona current is readily passed to the grounded collection electrode. Therefore, a relatively weak electric field, of several thousand volts, is maintained across the dust layer. Collected dust particles with low resistance do not adhere strongly enough to the collection plate. They are easily dislodged and become retained in the gas stream.

The electrical conductivity of a bulk layer of particles depends on both surface and volume factors.  Volume conduction, or the motions of electrical charges through the interiors of particles, depends mainly on the composition and temperature of the particles.  In the higher temperature regions, above {{convert|500|°F|°C|-1|abbr=on}}, volume conduction controls the conduction mechanism.  Volume conduction also involves ancillary factors, such as compression of the particle layer, particle size and shape, and surface properties.

Volume conduction is represented in the figures as a straight-line at temperatures above {{convert|500|°F|°C|-1|abbr=on}}.  At temperatures below about {{convert|450|°F|°C|-1|abbr=on}}, electrical charges begin to flow across surface moisture and chemical films adsorbed onto the particles.  Surface conduction begins to lower the resistivity values and bend the curve downward at temperatures below {{convert|500|°F|°C|-1|abbr=on}}.

These films usually differ both physically and chemically from the interiors of the particles owing to adsorption phenomena.  Theoretical calculations indicate that moisture films only a few molecules thick are adequate to provide the desired surface conductivity.  Surface conduction on particles is closely related to surface-leakage currents occurring on electrical insulators, which have been extensively studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Johnson |first=F. W. |title=Adsorbed Moisture Film on the Surface of Glazed Porcelain |journal=Phil. Mag. |volume=24 |issue=163 |pages=797–807 |year=1937 |doi=10.1080/14786443708561958}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An interesting practical application of surface-leakage is the determination of [[dew point]] by measurement of the current between adjacent electrodes mounted on a glass surface.  A sharp rise in current signals the formation of a moisture film on the glass.  This method has been used effectively for determining the marked rise in dew point, which occurs when small amounts of sulfuric acid vapor are added to an atmosphere (commercial Dewpoint Meters are available on the market).

The following discussion of normal, high, and low resistance applies to ESPs operated in a dry state; resistance is not a problem in the operation of wet ESPs because of the moisture concentration in the ESP. The relationship between moisture content and resistance is explained later in this work.

=== Normal resistivity ===
As stated above, ESPs work best under normal resistivity conditions. Particles with normal resistivity do not rapidly lose their charge on arrival at the collection electrode. These particles slowly leak their charge to grounded plates and are retained on the collection plates by intermolecular adhesive and cohesive forces. This allows a particulate layer to be built up and then dislodged from the plates by rapping. Within the range of normal dust resistivity (between 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; and 2 x 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; ohm-cm), fly ash is collected more easily than dust having either low or high resistivity.

=== High resistivity ===
If the voltage drop across the dust layer becomes too high, several adverse effects can occur. First, the high voltage drop reduces the voltage difference between the discharge electrode and collection electrode, and thereby reduces the electrostatic field strength used to drive the gas ion-charged particles over to the collected dust layer.  As the dust layer builds up, and the electrical charges accumulate on the surface of the dust layer, the voltage difference between the discharge and collection electrodes decreases. The migration velocities of small particles are especially affected by the reduced electric field strength.

Another problem that occurs with high resistivity dust layers is called back corona.  This occurs when the potential drop across the dust layer is so great that corona discharges begin to appear in the gas that is trapped within the dust layer. The dust layer breaks down electrically, producing small holes or craters from which back corona discharges occur. Positive gas ions are generated within the dust layer and are accelerated toward the "negatively charged" discharge electrode. The positive ions reduce some of the negative charges on the dust layer and neutralize some of the negative ions on the "charged particles" heading toward the collection electrode. Disruptions of the normal corona process greatly reduce the ESP's collection efficiency, which in severe cases, may fall below 50% .  When back corona is present, the dust particles build up on the electrodes forming a layer of insulation.  Often this can not be repaired without bringing the unit offline.

The third, and generally most common problem with high resistivity dust is increased electrical sparking. When the sparking rate exceeds the "set spark rate limit," the automatic controllers limit the operating voltage of the field. This causes reduced particle charging and reduced migration velocities toward the collection electrode. High resistivity can generally be reduced by doing the following:

* Adjusting the temperature;
* Increasing moisture content;
* Adding conditioning agents to the gas stream;
* Increasing the collection surface area; and
* Using hot-side precipitators (occasionally and with foreknowledge of sodium depletion).

Thin dust layers and high-resistivity dust especially favor the formation of back corona craters.  Severe back corona has been observed with dust layers as thin as 0.1&amp;nbsp;mm, but a dust layer just over one particle thick can reduce the sparking voltage by 50%.  The most marked effects of back corona on the current-voltage characteristics are:

# Reduction of the spark over voltage by as much as 50% or more;
# Current jumps or discontinuities caused by the formation of stable back-corona craters; and
# Large increase in maximum corona current, which just below spark over corona gap may be several times the normal current.

The Figure below and to the left shows the variation in resistivity with changing gas temperature for six different industrial dusts along with three coal-fired fly ashes.  The Figure on the right illustrates resistivity values measured for various chemical compounds that were prepared in the laboratory.

[[File:Resistivity Values of Representative Dusts and Fumes From Industrial Plants.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Resistivity Values of Representative Dusts and Fumes From Industrial Plants]]
[[File:Resistivity Values of Chemically Prepared Powders.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Resistivity Values of Various Chemicals and Reagents as a Function of Temperature]]

Results for Fly Ash A (in the figure to the left) were acquired in the ascending temperature mode.  These data are typical for a moderate to high combustibles content ash.  Data for Fly Ash B are from the same sample, acquired during the descending temperature mode.

The differences between the ascending and descending temperature modes are due to the presence of unburned combustibles in the sample. Between the two test modes, the samples are equilibrated in dry air for 14 hours (overnight) at {{convert|850|°F|°C|-1|abbr=on}}.  This overnight annealing process typically removes between 60% and 90% of any unburned combustibles present in the samples. Exactly how carbon works as a charge carrier is not fully understood, but it is known to significantly reduce the resistivity of a dust.

[[File:Resistivity As A Function Of Moisture.jpg|thumbnail|300px|right|Resistivity Measured as a Function of Temperature in Varying Moisture Concentrations (Humidity)]]

Carbon can act, at first, like a high resistivity dust in the precipitator.  Higher voltages can be required in order for corona generation to begin.  These higher voltages can be problematic for the TR-Set controls.  The problem lies in onset of corona causing large amounts of current to surge through the (low resistivity) dust layer.  The controls sense this surge as a spark.  As precipitators are operated in spark-limiting mode, power is terminated and the corona generation cycle re-initiates.  Thus, lower power (current) readings are noted with relatively high voltage readings.

The same thing is believed to occur in laboratory measurements.  Parallel plate geometry is used in laboratory measurements without corona generation.  A stainless steel cup holds the sample.  Another stainless steel electrode weight sits on top of the sample (direct contact with the dust layer).  As voltage is increased from small amounts (e.g. 20 V), no current is measured.  Then, a threshold voltage level is reached.  At this level, current surges through the sample... so much so that the voltage supply unit can trip off.  After removal of the unburned combustibles during the above-mentioned annealing procedure, the descending temperature mode curve shows the typical inverted “V” shape one might expect.

=== Low resistivity ===
Particles that have low resistivity are difficult to collect because they are easily charged (very conductive) and rapidly lose their charge on arrival at the collection electrode. The particles take on the charge of the collection electrode, bounce off the plates, and become re-entrained in the gas stream. Thus, attractive and repulsive electrical forces that are normally at work at normal and higher resistivities are lacking, and the binding forces to the plate are considerably lessened. Examples of low-resistivity dusts are unburned carbon in fly ash and carbon black.

If these conductive particles are coarse, they can be removed upstream of the precipitator by using a device such as a cyclone [[Cyclonic separation|mechanical collector]].

The addition of liquid ammonia ({{chem|NH|3}}) into the gas stream as a conditioning agent has found wide use in recent years. It is theorized that ammonia reacts with {{chem|H|2|SO|4}} contained in the flue gas to form an ammonium sulfate compound that increases the cohesivity of the dust.  This additional cohesivity makes up for the loss of electrical attraction forces.

The table below summarizes the characteristics associated with low, normal and high resistivity dusts.

The moisture content of the flue gas stream also affects particle resistivity. Increasing the moisture content of the gas stream by spraying water or injecting steam into the duct work preceding the ESP lowers the resistivity. In both temperature adjustment and moisture conditioning, one must maintain gas conditions above the dew point to prevent corrosion problems in the ESP or downstream equipment.  The figure to the right shows the effect of temperature and moisture on the resistivity of a cement dust. As the percentage of moisture in the gas stream increases from 6 to 20%, the resistivity of the dust dramatically decreases. Also, raising or lowering the temperature can decrease cement dust resistivity for all the moisture percentages represented.

The presence of {{chem|SO|3}} in the gas stream has been shown to favor the electrostatic precipitation process when problems with high resistivity occur. Most of the sulfur content in the coal burned for combustion sources converts to {{chem|SO|2}}. However, approximately 1% of the sulfur converts to {{chem|SO|3}}. The amount of {{chem|SO|3}} in the flue gas normally increases with increasing sulfur content of the coal. The resistivity of the particles decreases as the sulfur content of the coal increases.

Other conditioning agents, such as sulfuric acid, ammonia, sodium chloride, and soda ash (sometimes as raw trona), have also been used to reduce particle resistivity.  Therefore, the chemical composition of the flue gas stream is important with regard to the resistivity of the particles to be collected in the ESP.  The table below lists various conditioning agents and their mechanisms of operation.

{| class="wikitable"

# NaCl - natural conditioner when mixed with coal.
|}
If injection of ammonium sulfate occurs at a temperature greater than about {{convert|600|°F|°C|-1|abbr=on}}, dissociation into ammonia and sulfur trioxide results.  Depending on the ash, {{chem|SO|2}} may preferentially interact with fly ash as {{chem|SO|3}} conditioning.  The remainder recombines with ammonia to add to the space charge as well as increase cohesiveness of the ash.

More recently, it has been recognized that a major reason for loss of efficiency of the electrostatic precipitator is due to particle buildup on the charging wires in addition to the collection plates (Davidson and McKinney, 1998).  This is easily remedied by making sure that the wires themselves are cleaned at the same time that the collecting plates are cleaned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Davidson |first=J. H. |last2=McKinney |first2=P. J. |year=1998 |title=Chemical vapor deposition in the corona discharge of electrostatic air cleaners |journal=Aerosol Science and Technology |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=102–110 |doi=10.1080/02786829808965555 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sulfuric acid vapor ({{chem|SO|3}}) enhances the effects of water vapor on surface conduction.  It is physically adsorbed within the layer of moisture on the particle  surfaces.  The effects of relatively small amounts of acid vapor can be seen in the figure below and to the right.

The inherent resistivity of the sample at {{convert|300|°F|°C|-1|abbr=on}} is 5×10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; ohm-cm.  An equilibrium concentration of just 1.9 ppm sulfuric acid vapor lowers that value to about 7 x 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; ohm-cm.

== Modern industrial electrostatic precipitators ==
[[File:Hazelwood Power Station ESP.jpg|thumb|A smokestack at coal-fired [[Hazelwood Power Station]] in [[Victoria, Australia]] emits brown smoke when its ESP is shut down]]
ESPs continue to be excellent devices for control of many industrial particulate emissions, including smoke from electricity-generating utilities (coal and oil fired), salt cake collection from [[black liquor]] boilers in pulp mills, and catalyst collection from fluidized bed catalytic cracker units in oil refineries to name a few. These devices treat gas volumes from several hundred thousand [[Actual cubic feet per minute|ACFM]] to 2.5 million ACFM (1,180 m³/s) in the largest coal-fired boiler applications. For a coal-fired boiler the collection is usually performed downstream of the air preheater at about {{convert|160|°C|°F}} which provides optimal resistivity of the coal-ash particles. For some difficult applications with low-sulfur fuel hot-end units have been built operating above {{convert|370|°C|°F}}.

The original parallel plate–weighted wire design{{elucidate|date=May 2013}} has evolved as more efficient (and robust) discharge electrode designs were developed, today focusing on rigid (pipe-frame) discharge electrodes to which many sharpened spikes are attached (barbed wire), maximizing [[Corona discharge|corona]] production. Transformer-rectifier systems apply voltages of {{nowrap|50–100 [[volt|kV]]}} at relatively high current densities. Modern controls, such as an [[automatic voltage control]], minimize [[electric spark]]ing and prevent arcing (sparks are quenched within 1/2 cycle of the [[Rectiformer|TR set]]), avoiding damage to the components. Automatic plate-rapping systems and hopper-evacuation systems remove the collected particulate matter while on line, theoretically allowing ESPs to stay in continuous operation for years at a time.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

== Electrostatic sampling for bioaerosols ==
Electrostatic precipitators can be used to sample biological airborne particles or aerosol for analysis. Sampling for bioaerosols requires precipitator designs optimised with a liquid counter electrode, which can be used to sample biological particles, e.g. viruses, directly into a small liquid volume to reduce unnecessary sample dilution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Gaspard |last=Pardon |first2=Laila |last2=Ladhani |first3=Niklas |last3=Sandstrom |first4=Wouter |last4=van der Wijngaart |title=Aerosol sampling using an electrostatic precipitator integrated with a microfluidic interface |journal=Sensors and actuators.

== Wet electrostatic precipitator ==
A wet electrostatic precipitator (WESP or wet ESP) operates with [[water vapor]] saturated air streams (100% relative humidity). WESPs are commonly used to remove liquid droplets such as sulfuric acid mist from industrial process gas streams. The WESP is also commonly used where the gases are high in moisture content, contain combustible particulate, or have particles that are sticky in nature.

The preferred and most modern type of WESP is a downflow tubular design. This design allows the collected moisture and particulate to form a moving [[slurry]] that helps to keep the collection surfaces clean. Plate style and upflow design WESPs are very unreliable and should not be used in applications where particulate is sticky in nature.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

== Consumer-oriented electrostatic air cleaners ==
[[File:Air purifier.JPG|thumb|left|upright|A portable electrostatic air cleaner marketed to consumers]]
[[File:Sharp FU-888SV internal 20061020.jpg|thumb|upright|Portable electrostatic air cleaner with cover removed, showing collector plates]]
Plate precipitators are commonly marketed to the public as [[air purifier]] devices or as a permanent replacement for furnace filters, but all have the undesirable attribute of being somewhat messy to clean.  A negative side-effect of electrostatic precipitation devices is the potential production of toxic [[ozone]] and {{chem|link=NOx|NO|x}}{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}.  However, electrostatic precipitators offer benefits over other air purifications technologies, such as [[HEPA]] filtration, which require expensive filters and can become "production sinks" for many harmful forms of bacteria.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

With electrostatic precipitators, if the collection plates are allowed to accumulate large amounts of particulate matter, the particles can sometimes bond so tightly to the metal plates that vigorous washing and scrubbing may be required to completely clean the collection plates. The close spacing of the plates can make thorough cleaning difficult, and the stack of plates often cannot be easily disassembled for cleaning. One solution, suggested by several manufacturers, is to wash the collector plates in a [[dishwasher]].

Some consumer precipitation filters are sold with special soak-off cleaners, where the entire plate array is removed from the precipitator and soaked in a large container overnight, to help loosen the tightly bonded [[particulates]].

A study by the [[Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation]] testing a variety of [[forced-air]] furnace filters found that ESP filters provided the best, and most cost-effective means of cleaning air using a forced-air system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/co/maho/gemare/gemare_008.cfm |title=Your Furnace Filter:  What A Furnace Filter Can Do For You |accessdate=2008-09-01 |publisher=[[Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514164731/http://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/co/maho/gemare/gemare_008.cfm |archivedate=2008-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|energy crises in general||Oil crisis (disambiguation){{!}}Oil crisis}}

An '''energy crisis''' is any significant [[Bottleneck (production)|bottleneck]] in the supply of [[energy]] resources to an [[economy]]. In literature, it often refers to one of the energy sources used at a certain time and place, in particular those that supply [[national electricity grid]]s or those used as fuel in vehicles.

Industrial development and population growth have led to a surge in the global [[energy demand|demand for energy]] in recent years. In the 2000s, this new demand — together with [[Middle East]] tension, the falling value of the U.S. dollar, dwindling oil reserves, concerns over [[peak oil]], and [[Oil speculation|oil price speculation]] — triggered the [[2000s energy crisis]], which saw the price of oil reach an all-time high of $147.30 a barrel in 2008.

== Causes ==
[[File:Door paard getrokken taxi.jpg|thumb|The gasoline shortages of [[World War II]] brought about the resurgence of horse-and-wagon delivery.]]
Most energy crisis have been caused by localized shortages, wars and market manipulation. Some have argued that government actions like tax hikes, nationalisation of energy companies, and regulation of the energy sector, shift supply and demand of energy away from its economic equilibrium. However, the recent historical energy crisis listed below were not caused by such factors. [[Market failure]] is possible when [[Government monopoly|monopoly]] manipulation of markets occurs. A crisis can develop due to industrial actions like [[Trade union|union]] organized [[Strike action|strikes]] and government embargoes. The cause may be [[over-consumption]], aging [[infrastructure]], [[choke point]] disruption or bottlenecks at [[oil refinery|oil refineries]] and port facilities that restrict fuel supply. An emergency may emerge during very cold winters due to increased consumption of energy.

Large fluctuations and manipulations in future [[Energy derivative|derivatives]] can have a substantial impact on price. Large investment banks control 80% of oil derivatives as of May 2012, compared to 30% only a decade ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Behind Oil Price Rise: Peak Oil or Wall Street Speculation?|url=http://axisoflogic.com/artman/publish/Article_64370.shtml|publisher=Axis of Logic|accessdate=21 March 2012|author=F. William Engdahl|date=Mar 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This increase contributed to an improvement of global energy output from 117 687 TWh in 2000 to 143 851TWh in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Eenergiläget in Sweden 2012 figure 49000 and 53&lt;/ref&gt; Limitations on free trade for derivatives could reverse this trend of growth in energy production. Kuwaiti Oil Minister Hani Hussein stated that "Under the supply and demand theory, oil prices today are not justified," in an interview with Upstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kuwait says high oil price not justified|url=http://www.upstreamonline.com/live/article1236944.ece|publisher=UpStreamOnline|accessdate=21 March 2012|author=Associated Press|date=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pipeline failures and other accidents may cause minor interruptions to energy supplies. A crisis could possibly emerge after infrastructure damage from [[severe weather]]. Attacks by terrorists or [[militia]] on important infrastructure are a possible problem for energy consumers, with a successful strike on a [[Middle East]] facility potentially causing global shortages. Political events, for example, when governments change due to regime change, monarchy collapse, [[military occupation]], and [[Coup d'état|coup]] may disrupt oil and gas production and create shortages. Fuel shortage can also be due to the excess and useless use of the fuels.

==Emerging oil shortage==
{{Main article|Oil depletion|Peak oil}}
“Peak oil” is the period when the maximum rate of global [[petroleum]] [[extraction of petroleum|extraction]] is reached, after which the rate of production enters terminal decline. It relates to a long-term decline in the available supply of petroleum.  This, combined with increasing demand, significantly increases the worldwide prices of petroleum derived products.  Most significant is the availability and price of liquid fuel for transportation.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The US Department of Energy in the [[Hirsch report]] indicates that “The problems associated with world oil production peaking will not be temporary, and past 'energy crisis' experience will provide relatively little guidance.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netl.doe.gov/publications/others/pdf/Oil_Peaking_NETL.pdf DOE Hirsch Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mitigation efforts===
{{Main article|Mitigation of peak oil}}
To avoid the serious [[society|social]] and [[economics|economic]] implications a global decline in oil production could entail, the 2005 Hirsch report emphasized the need to find alternatives, at least ten to twenty years before the peak, and to phase out the use of petroleum over that time. Such [[mitigation of peak oil|mitigation]] could include energy conservation, fuel substitution, and the use of unconventional oil. Because mitigation can reduce the use of traditional petroleum sources, it can also affect the timing of peak oil and the shape of the [[Hubbert curve]].

[[Energy policy]] may be reformed leading to greater [[energy intensity]], for example in [[Iran]] with the [[2007 Gas Rationing Plan in Iran]], [[Canada]] and the [[National Energy Program]] and in the USA with the ''[[Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007]]'' also called the ''[[Clean Energy Act of 2007]]''. Another mitigation measure is the setup of a cache of [[global strategic petroleum reserves|secure fuel reserves]] like the United States [[Strategic Petroleum Reserve (United States)|Strategic Petroleum Reserve]], in case of [[State of emergency|national emergency]]. [[Energy policy of China#Energy conservation|Chinese energy policy]] includes specific targets within their 5-year plans.

[[Andrew McKillop]] has been a proponent of a contract and converge model or capping scheme, to mitigate both emissions of [[greenhouse gas]]es and a peak oil crisis. The imposition of a [[carbon tax]] would have mitigating effects on an oil crisis.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} The Oil Depletion Protocol has been developed by [[Richard Heinberg]] to implement a powerdown during a [[Hubbert Peak Theory|peak oil]] crisis. While many [[sustainable development]] and energy policy organisations have advocated reforms to [[energy development]] from the 1970s, some cater to a specific crisis in energy supply including [[Energy-Quest]] and the [[International Association for Energy Economics]]. The [[Oil Depletion Analysis Centre]] and the [[Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas]] examine the timing and likely effects of peak oil.

Ecologist [[William Rees (academic)|William Rees]] believes that
{{cquote|To avoid a serious energy crisis in coming decades, citizens in the industrial countries should actually be urging their governments to come to international agreement on a persistent, orderly, predictable, and steepening series of oil and natural gas price hikes over the next two decades.}}

Due to a lack of political viability on the issue, government mandated fuel prices hikes are unlikely and the unresolved [[dilemma]] of fossil fuel dependence is becoming a [[wicked problem]]. A global [[soft energy path]] seems improbable, due to the [[Rebound effect (conservation)|rebound effect]]. Conclusions that the world is heading towards an unprecedented large and potentially devastating global energy crisis due to a decline in the availability of cheap oil lead to calls for a decreasing dependency on [[fossil fuel]].

Other ideas concentrate on design and development of improved, energy-efficient urban infrastructure in developing nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |ssrn = 1221622|title = The Urban Component of the Energy Crisis|accessdate = 2008-08-13|author = Vittorio E. Pareto, Marcos P. Pareto|format = |work = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Government funding for alternative energy is more likely to increase during an energy crisis, so too are incentives for [[oil exploration]]. For example, funding for research into [[inertial confinement fusion]] technology increased during the 1970s.

[[Kirk Sorensen]] and others&lt;ref name="Richard Martin"&gt;"Super Fuel: Thorium, The Green Energy Source For The Future", Macmillan, (c) 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that additional nuclear power plants, particularly [[liquid fluoride thorium reactor]]s have the [[energy density]] to mitigate [[global warming]] and replace the energy from [[peak oil]], [[peak coal]] and [[peak gas]].  The reactors produce electricity and heat so much of the transportation infrastructure should move over to electric vehicles.  However, the high process heat of the [[molten salt reactors]] could be used to make [[liquid fuels]] from any carbon source.

==2010s oil glut==
{{Main article|2010s oil glut}}
Rather counterintuitively, the world economy has had to deal with the unforeseen consequences of the [[2016 oil glut|2015-2016 oil glut]] also known as [[2010s oil glut]], a major energy crisis that took many experts by surprise. This [[oversupply]] crisis started with a considerable time-lag, more than six years after the beginning of the [[Great Recession]]: "''the price of oil'' [had] ''stabilized at a relatively high level (around $100 a barrel) unlike all  previous recessionary cycles since 1980 (start of First Persian Gulf War). But nothing guarantee[d] such price levels in perpetuity''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.academia.edu/6702258/A_GCC_House_Divided_Country_Risk_Implications_of_the_Saudi-Qatari_Rift |work=Al-Hayat |location=London |title=A GCC House Divided: Country Risk Implications of the Saudi-Qatari Rift |first=M. Nicolas J. |last=Firzli |date=6 April 2014 |accessdate=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social and economic effects ==
{{Main article|Energy economics|Renewable energy commercialization}}
The [[Energy and the Macroeconomy|macroeconomic]] implications of a [[supply shock]]-induced energy crisis are large, because energy is the resource used to exploit all other resources. When [[energy market]]s fail, an energy shortage develops. Electricity consumers may experience intentionally engineered [[rolling blackout]]s during periods of insufficient supply or unexpected [[power outage]]s, regardless of the cause.

Industrialized nations are dependent on oil, and efforts to restrict the supply of oil would have an adverse effect on the economies of oil producers. For the consumer, the price of [[natural gas prices|natural gas]], [[price of petroleum|gasoline]] (petrol) and [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] for cars and other vehicles rises. An early response from stakeholders is the call for reports, investigations and commissions into the price of fuels. There are also movements towards the development of more [[sustainable urban infrastructure]].

[[Image:New Vehicle Purchase Preference.svg|thumb|right|In 2006, survey respondents in the [[United States]] were willing to pay more for a [[plug-in hybrid]] car]]
[[File:Global-RE-Investment-VC-Eng.png|thumb|Global New Investments in Renewable Energy&lt;ref name="UNEP_GT_2011"&gt;[http://www.unep.org/Renewable_Energy_Investment/ Bloomberg New Energy Finance, UNEP SEFI, Frankfurt School, Global Trends in Renewable Energy Investment 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130113121745/http://www.unep.org/Renewable_Energy_Investment/ |date=2013-01-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In the market, new technology and [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] measures become desirable for consumers seeking to decrease transport costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = High Oil Prices Boost Energy Efficiency - Report|url = http://www.planetark.org/dailynewsstory.cfm/newsid/46675/story.htm|website = www.planetark.org|accessdate = 2015-10-26|date = January 30, 2008|last = Bergin|first = Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt; January 30, 2008 Planet Ark. Examples include:
* In 1980 [[Briggs &amp; Stratton]] developed the first gasoline [[hybrid electric automobile]]; also are appearing [[plug-in hybrid]]s.
* the growth of [[advanced biofuel]]s.
* [[innovation]]s like the [[Dahon]], a folding bicycle
* modernized and electrifying passenger transport
* [[Railway electrification system]]s and new engines such as the [[Ganz-Mavag]] locomotive
* [[variable compression ratio]] for vehicles

Other responses include the development of [[unconventional oil]] sources such as [[synthetic fuel]] from places like the [[Athabasca Oil Sands]], more [[renewable energy commercialization]] and use of [[alternative propulsion]]. There may be a [[Localism (politics)|Relocation]] trend towards [[local food]]s and possibly [[microgeneration]], [[solar thermal collector]]s and other [[green energy]] sources.

[[Tourism]] trends and [[gas-guzzler]] ownership varies with fuel costs. Energy shortages can influence public opinion on subjects from [[nuclear power plants]] to electric blankets. Building [[construction]] techniques—improved [[Building insulation|insulation]], reflective roofs, thermally efficient windows, etc.—change to reduce heating costs.

=== Crisis management ===
An electricity shortage is felt most acutely in heating, [[cooking]], and [[water supply]]. Therefore, a sustained energy crisis may become a [[humanitarian crisis]].

If an energy shortage is prolonged a [[crisis management]] phase is enforced by authorities. [[Energy audit]]s may be conducted to monitor usage. Various curfews with the intention of increasing [[energy conservation]] may be initiated to reduce consumption. For example, to conserve power during the Central Asia energy crisis, authorities in Tajikistan ordered bars and cafes to operate by candlelight.{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18784716 |title=Crisis Looms as Bitter Cold, Blackouts Hit Tajikistan |accessdate=2008-02-10 |format= |work=[[NPR]] }}

In the worst kind of energy crisis [[energy rationing]] and fuel [[rationing]] may be incurred. [[Panic buying]] may beset outlets as awareness of shortages spread. Facilities close down to save on heating oil; and factories cut production and lay off workers. The risk of [[stagflation]] increases.

'''''Ensete''''' is a [[genus]] of [[monocarpic]] [[flowering plant]]s [[native plant|native]] to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is one of the two genera in the [[banana]] family, [[Musaceae]], and includes the false banana or enset (''[[Ensete ventricosum|E. ventricosum]]''), an economically important food crop in Ethiopia.&lt;ref name=RHSAZ&gt;{{cite book|title=RHS A-Z encyclopedia of garden plants|year=2008|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|location=United Kingdom|isbn=1405332964|pages=1136}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aaas&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaas.org/international/africa/enset/uses.shtml|title=Uses of Enset|accessdate=13 August 2007|year=1997|work=The 'Tree Against Hunger': Enset-Based Agricultural Systems in Ethiopia|publisher=[[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819143500/http://www.aaas.org/international/africa/enset/uses.shtml|archivedate=19 August 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Taxonomy ==
The genus ''Ensete'' was first described by [[Paul Fedorowitsch Horaninow]] (1796-1865) in his ''[[Prodromus Monographiae Scitaminarum]]'' of 1862 in which he created a single species, ''Ensete edule''. However, the genus did not receive general recognition until 1947 when it was revived by [[Ernest Entwistle Cheesman|E. E. Cheesman]] in the first of a series of papers in the ''[[Kew Bulletin]]'' on the classification of the bananas, with a total of 25 species.

Taxonomically, the genus ''Ensete'' has shrunk since Cheesman revived the [[taxon]]. Cheesman acknowledged that field study might reveal [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonymy]] and the most recent review of the genus by Simmonds (1960) listed just six. Recently the number has increased to seven as the Flora of [[China]] has, not entirely convincingly, reinstated ''Ensete wilsonii''. There is one species in [[Thailand]], somewhat resembling ''E. superbum'', that has not been formally described, and possibly other Asian species.

It is possible to separate ''Ensete'' into its African and Asian species.

;Africa
:''[[Ensete gilletii]]''
:''[[Ensete homblei]]''
:''[[Ensete perrieri]]'' - endemic to [[Madagascar]] but intriguingly like the Asian ''E. glaucum''
:''[[Ensete ventricosum]]'' - enset or false banana, widely cultivated as a food plant in Ethiopia

;Asia
:''[[Ensete glaucum]]'' - widespread in Asia from India to Papua New Guinea
:''[[Ensete superbum]]'' - Western Ghats of India
:''[[Ensete wilsonii]]'' - [[Yunnan]], China, but doubtfully distinct from ''E. glaucum''
:''Ensete'' sp. "Thailand" - possibly a new species or a disjunct population of ''E. superbum''

[[File:Fuel Price Protest on M6 - geograph.org.uk - 1009073.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Lorries performing a rolling roadblock in a protest on the [[M6 motorway|M6]] in 2007.]]

The '''fuel protests in the United Kingdom''' were a series of campaigns held because of the cost of rising [[petrol]] and [[diesel fuel]] prices for road vehicle use. There have been three notable campaigns amongst many other protests in the 21st century. The first major protest in 2000 was primarily led by independent truck owner-operators. One group of truck owner-operators from the South East of England formed a protest group called "TransAction" that protested at [[oil refineries]] and fuel depots in [[Essex]]. Protests and blockades of oil facilities caused widespread disruption to the supply of petroleum products. The aim of the protests was to secure a reduction in the fuel duty rate on petrol and diesel, which the government refused to enact. After the protest ended, the government did announce a freeze on fuel duties, and promised changes would be made to the way that goods vehicles were taxed, which would include the taxing of foreign vehicles operating on British roads.

Subsequent protests have not had as significant an impact but did result in [[panic buying]] in 2005 and again in 2007. The 2007 fuel protests were put together by several members of the old "TransAction group" from the South of England, reforming as "TransAction 2007". The protests of this period were not widely supported nor did they cause the same disruption as those in previous years. The 2007 protest which took place at the latter end of the year, culminated in 200–300 trucks descending on [[Central London]] with the police closing off the A40 fly-over for use as a truck park for the day. Following this, a rally was held at [[Marble Arch]]. Later in the day, a deputation went to 10 Downing Street to deliver a formal petition calling for the reduction of UK fuel duty. There were those who felt that the 2007 fuel protests were politically motivated, given that many truck owner operators and farmers would have supported the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. The Conservative leader [[David Cameron]] gave them his support and promised a “fair fuel stabiliser”, a proposal to limit the price of petrol that was part of the Conservative manifesto for the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 UK general election]] and was announced to be implemented following the budget of March 2011. The “fair fuel stabiliser” which was meant to lower taxes levied on fuel as the price rose and raise tax as the price fell, in fact tax will still rise as the [[Price of petroleum|oil price]] rises but the tax will be capped at the level of [[inflation]] at that time and will be applied twice a year, but when the oil price is falling then the tax can be greater than inflation. Quote from "Overview of Tax Legislation and Rates" section 3.44: "When oil prices are high, as now, fuel duty will increase by the [[retail prices index]] (RPI). However, if the oil price falls below a set trigger price on a sustained basis, the Government will increase fuel duty by RPI plus 1 penny per litre. The Government believes that a trigger price of $75 per barrel would be appropriate, and will set a final trigger price and mechanism after seeking the views of oil and gas companies and motoring groups".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cdn.hm-treasury.gov.uk/2011budget_taxation_overview.pdf |title=2011 Budget Taxation Overview |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516122556/http://cdn.hm-treasury.gov.uk/2011budget_taxation_overview.pdf |archivedate=16 May 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In the United Kingdom, tax on fuel for road use is made up of two elements—[[Hydrocarbon oil duty|fuel duty]] and [[value added tax]] (VAT).  Fuel duty is applied at a fixed amount per litre by fuel type, and VAT is then added as a [[percentage]] of the combined total of the cost of the fuel and the fuel duty.&lt;ref name="bbc20000921facts"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/world/2000/world_fuel_crisis/933648.stm |title=UK fuel tax: The facts |date=29 July 2000 |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |work=BBC News |accessdate=12 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Historically, fuel duty was increased annually, broadly in line with inflation. In 1993 the [[fuel price escalator]] was introduced by the [[Premiership of John Major|Conservatives]], justified as being designed to encourage less motor vehicle use, and thus combat [[climate change]].&lt;ref name="bbc20041005" /&gt;  The idea was to annually increase fuel duty, initially at 3%,&lt;ref name="bbc20000921facts" /&gt; later rising to 5%,&lt;ref name="bbc20000921facts" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hansard19990309"&gt;{{cite hansard |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199899/cmhansrd/vo990309/debtext/90309-07.htm |house=[[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] |date=9 March 1999 |column=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; above the rate of inflation.&lt;ref name="bbc20041005" /&gt; The [[Premiership of Tony Blair|Blair administration]] then increased the rate at which the escalator exceeded inflation to 6%.&lt;ref name="hansard19990309" /&gt;

==2000==
By 2000, tax accounted for 81.5% of the total cost of unleaded petrol, up from 72.8% in 1993.&lt;ref name="bbc20000921facts" /&gt;  Fuel prices in the UK had risen from being amongst the cheapest in [[Europe]] to being the most expensive in the same time frame.&lt;ref name="bbc20000921facts" /&gt; The protesters said that higher transport costs in the UK were making it difficult for haulage industry to remain competitive.&lt;ref name="guardian20000911looming"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/oil/story/0,,611131,00.html |title=Fuel crisis looms as pickets hit depots |date=11 September 2000 |first=Peter |last=Hetherington |author2=Ward, David |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media |accessdate=13 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The worldwide price of oil had increased from [[US dollar|$]]10 to $30 a barrel,&lt;ref name="bbc20000912privy" /&gt; the highest level in 10 years.&lt;ref name="bbc20000907"&gt;{{cite news |title=Petrol price rise anger |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/913614.stm |date=7 September 2000 |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |work=BBC News |accessdate=12 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Drivers in the UK were now paying an average of 80 pence a litre for unleaded and 80.8p for diesel.&lt;ref name="bbc20000907" /&gt; The government had already abandoned the fuel tax escalator in early 2000.&lt;ref name="bbc2000912blair24hours" /&gt;

===Reaction===
During the protests the oil companies were accused of [[collusion]] with the protesters by members of the government and its advisors.&lt;ref name="guardian20000913collusion"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/oil/story/0,,611170,00.html |title=Oil giants accused of collusion |first=Peter |last=Hetherington |author2=Charlotte Denny |date=13 September 2000 |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media |accessdate=12 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that the police had kept the roads clear yet [[Tank truck|tankers]] were being kept in the depots and not delivering petrol.&lt;ref name="guardian20000913collusion" /&gt; The [[Transport and General Workers Union]] said that there had been incidents of intimidation against drivers of the fuel tankers.&lt;ref name="guardian20000913collusion" /&gt; The possibility of [[court injunction]]s against the protesters was explored by [[TotalFinaElf|TotalElfFina]] who received legal advice that it would be difficult to obtain and enforce one as there was not a named individual on which to serve the injunction.&lt;ref name="guardian20000913collusion" /&gt;  The company also stated that even if roads were clear, delivering fuel might change the mood of the protesters which had been "amicable" and that "Getting fuel to the pumps would only solve the short-term problem and not deal with the original concerns of protesters".&lt;ref name="guardian20000913collusion" /&gt;  The TGWU subsequently called for a [[public inquiry]] into reports of collusion between the demonstrators and the oil companies, saying that they had evidence of protestors being allowed access to the oil companies' sites without security checks and that drivers who had been willing to deliver fuel being told not to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/930719.stm |title=Union wants inquiry into fuel protests |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |work=BBC News |date=18 September 2000 |accessdate=12 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government stated that they would not back down&lt;ref name="bbc2000912blair24hours" /&gt; in the face of protests or introduce an emergency budget.&lt;ref name="bbc20000913tankers"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/922226.stm |title=Tankers back on UK roads |date=13 September 2000 |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |work=BBC News |accessdate=12 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The government argued that the rise in prices was due to increases in the world oil market prices and not the government's fuel duty.&lt;ref name="bbc2000912blair24hours" /&gt;  Whilst agreeing that the government could not make policy in response to the blockades, [[William Hague]], [[Leader of the Opposition]] criticised the government for having increased taxes, whilst the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] argued that the government should have responded to the protest much earlier.&lt;ref name="bbc20000912" /&gt;  The [[Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union]] called for a reduction in fuel duties during the action.&lt;ref name="bbc20000910shortages" /&gt;

A [[BBC]] opinion poll conducted by [[ICM Research|ICM]] of 514 people by telephone showed that the public support on 12 September 2000 for the protesters stood at 78% until the possibility of essential services being affected when it fell to 36%.&lt;ref name="bbc20000913trickle" /&gt; An opinion poll for the [[Daily Mail]] of 502 people showed that over three quarters thought the government had handled the crisis badly.&lt;ref name="bbc20000913"&gt;{{cite news |title=Fuel crisis post mortem begins |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/925616.stm |date=13 September 2000 |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |work=BBC News |accessdate=12 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two opinion polls shortly after the protests had ended showed the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] had overtaken or reached equal standing with the governing [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].&lt;ref name="bbc20000917" /&gt;  By November support for the renewal of protests and the revival of the Conservative's fortunes had both been reduced, with Labour retaking a poll lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Public backs away from fuel tax protests |url=https://www.theguardian.com/oil/story/0,,611037,00.html |first=Kevin |last=Maguire |author2=White, Michael |date=7 November 2000 |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media |accessdate=13 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consequences===
In his [[Pre Budget Report|pre-Budget report]] of 8 November 2000, the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]], [[Gordon Brown]], announced numerous changes which could ease the tax burden for motorists, and which included the taxing of foreign lorries using British roads.  These changes included a cut in duty on ultra-low sulphur petrol, a freeze on fuel duty for other grades of fuel until at least April 2002 (effectively ending the fuel duty escalator), placing more vehicles into the lower [[vehicle excise duty]] (VED) band, an average cut of more than 50% on VED for lorries, and a ''Brit Disc'' [[Vignette (road tax)|vignette]] scheme requiring all lorries, including those from overseas, to pay [[tax]] to use British roads.&lt;ref name="guardian20001109" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Chancellor freezes fuel in cautious pre-Budget |work=The Daily Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph News and Media Limited |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2000/11/08/cnbud08.xml |date=8 November 2000 |accessdate=13 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The fuel duty freeze has been estimated to have cost the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] £2billion pounds annually in a 2004 report by the [[Economic and Social Research Council]].&lt;ref name="bbc20041005"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3716346.stm |title=Fuel protest costs treasury £2bn yearly |first=Roger |last=Harrabin |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |work=BBC News |date=5 October 2004 |accessdate=12 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[BBC]] reported on 7 September 2005 that the group responsible for the blockades in September 2000 was threatening to stage protests at oil refineries from 0600 [[British Summer Time|BST]] on 14 September 2005 unless reductions in fuel duty were made.&lt;ref name="bbc20050907"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4221296.stm |title=Further fuel protests threatened |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |work=BBC News |date=14 September 2005 |accessdate=12 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Newspapers reported that on 10 September 2005, the government had drawn up contingency plans to maintain the supply of fuel, including using 1000 army drivers to operate tankers, introducing fuel rationing&lt;ref name="scotsman20050911"&gt;{{cite news |title=Fuel crisis: drivers face rationing |first=Brian |last=Brady |publisher=Johnston Press plc |work=The Scotsman |date=11 September 2005 |url=http://news.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=1921402005 |accessdate=24 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and confiscating the driving licences of those who broke the law.&lt;ref name="bbc20050914"&gt;{{cite news |title=Relief after few attend protests |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |work=BBC News |date=14 September 2005 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4243950.stm |accessdate=24 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Panic buying was reported on 13 September 2005 as drivers stocked up on fuel with drivers reported to be waiting an hour to fill their vehicles with petrol.&lt;ref name="guardian20050914"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/oil/story/0,,1568678,00.html |title=Panic buying begins as motorists fear petrol blockades |first=Sandra |last=Laville |author2=Vikram Dodd |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media |date=14 September 2005 |accessdate=12 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At its height, around 3,000 petrol stations were emptied of fuel.&lt;ref name="times20050914"&gt;{{cite news |title=Petrol protest fails to ignite |first=Sam |last=Knight |publisher=Times Newspapers |work=Times Online |date=14 September 2005 |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1780144,00.html |accessdate=24 November 2007 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, on 14 September 2005, only a small number of protesters arrived at the refineries with no intention to start blockading the entrances.

In responding to the protests, the government argued that lower than needed supplies by [[OPEC]] and the Katrina hurricane had a more significant impact on the price of fuel than the level of duty.&lt;ref name="guardian20050917" /&gt;

==2007==
Towards the end of 2007, fuel prices exceeded [[Pound sterling|£1]] per litre with a 2 pence rise in fuel tax in October, resulting in the highest diesel prices and the fourth highest for petrol in Europe.&lt;ref name="bbc20071214"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7145006.stm |title=Keep to law, fuel protesters told |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |work=BBC News |date=14 December 2007 |accessdate=12 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; New protests were planned by two unconnected groups, one called Transaction 2007 and the [[Road Haulage Association]] (RHA).&lt;ref name="bbc20071214" /&gt; The [[Scotland|Scottish]] branch of the RHA proposed a rolling roadblock by around 30 vehicles, whereas Transaction 2007 intended to protest outside oil refineries.&lt;ref name="bbc20071214" /&gt;  Whilst the rolling road block attracted 45 vehicles driving at around {{convert|40|mph}} on several motorways,&lt;ref name="bbcscotland20071215"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7145660.stm |title=Drivers protest over fuel costs |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |work=BBC News |accessdate=12 January 2008 |date=15 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; the level of protest at oil refineries was lower than in 2000.&lt;ref name="bbc20071215"&gt;{{cite news |title=Low turnout for fuel price demos |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |work=BBC News |date=15 December 2007 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7145581.stm |accessdate=15 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the campaign aims of the RHA was the introduction of a fuel price regulator who would control duty during periods which was supported by [[Alex Salmond]], [[First Minister of Scotland]].&lt;ref name="bbcscotland20071215" /&gt;

'''Hakavik Power Station''' is a 7&amp;nbsp;MW [[hydroelectric power plant]] at [[Øvre Eiker]] in [[Buskerud]], Norway, located 25&amp;nbsp;metres above sea level.

The power station was inaugurated in 1922. It generates only railway [[traction current]], [[Single-phase electric power|single phase]] 55&amp;nbsp;[[kilovolt|kV]] at 16 2/3&amp;nbsp;[[hertz]]. The station is the starting point of a powerline to [[Sande, Vestfold|Sande]] and another to Sundhaugen Switching Station, where a 55&amp;nbsp;kV-line to [[Asker]] and another one to [[Neslandsvatn]] over [[Nordagutu]] and [[Skollenberg]] departs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.statkraft.com/energy-sources/Power-plants/Norway/Hakavik/ |title=  Hakavik|website = [[Statkraft|statkraft.com]] |accessdate= 2017-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://no.geoview.info/hakavik_power_station,7289966|title= Hakavik Power Station|website = no.geoview.info |accessdate= 2017-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only other power station in Norway to do this is [[Kjofossen Power Station]].

In [[science]] and [[engineering]] the study of '''high pressure''' examines its effects on materials and the design and construction of devices, such as a [[diamond anvil cell]], which can create high [[pressure]]. By ''high pressure'' is usually meant pressures of thousands (kilo[[Bar (unit)|bar]]s) or millions (megabars) of times [[atmospheric pressure]] (about 1 bar or 100,000 Pa).

==History and overview==
[[Percy Williams Bridgman]] received a [[Nobel Prize]] in 1946 for advancing this area of physics by several magnitudes of pressure (400 MPa to 40,000 MPa). The list of founding fathers of this field includes also the names of [[Harry George Drickamer]], [[Tracy Hall]], Francis P. Bundy, Leonid F. Vereschagin, and [[Sergey M. Stishov]].

It was by applying high pressure as well as high [[temperature]] to [[carbon]] that man-made [[synthetic diamond|diamond]]s were first produced as well as many other interesting discoveries. Almost any material when subjected to high pressure will compact itself into a denser form, for example, [[quartz]], also called [[silica]] or [[silicon dioxide]] will first adopt a denser form known as [[coesite]], then upon application of even higher pressure, form [[stishovite]]. These two forms of silica were first discovered by high-pressure experimenters, but then found in nature at the site of a meteor impact.

Chemical bonding is likely to change under high pressure, when the P*V term in the free energy becomes comparable to the energies of typical chemical bonds – i.e. at around 100 GPa. Among the most striking changes are metallization of [[oxygen]] at 96 GPa (rendering oxygen a superconductor), and transition of [[sodium]] from a nearly-free-electron metal to a transparent insulator at ~200 GPa. At ultimately high compression, however, all materials will metallize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.200602485/abstract|title = The Chemical Imagination at Work in Very Tight Places|journal= [[Angewandte Chemie International Edition]] | doi=10.1002/anie.200602485|volume=46|pages=3620–3642}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High-pressure experimentation has led to the discovery of the types of minerals which are believed to exist in the deep mantle of the Earth, such as [[silicate perovskite]], which is thought to make up half of the Earth's bulk, and [[post-perovskite]], which occurs at the core-mantle boundary and explains many anomalies inferred for that region.{{citation needed|date = May 2009}}

Pressure "landmarks": typical pressures reached by large-volume presses are up to 30–40 GPa, pressures that can be generated inside [[diamond anvil cell]]s are ~1000 GPa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/7/e1600341|title = Terapascal static pressure generation with ultrahigh yield strength nanodiamond|publisher= ''[[Science Advances ]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; pressure in the center of the Earth is 364 GPa, and highest pressures ever achieved in shock waves are over 100,000 GPa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/104/22/9172.full|title = Achieving high-density states through shock-wave loading of precompressed samples|journal= [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] | doi=10.1073/pnas.0608170104|volume=104|pages=9172–9177|bibcode=2007PNAS..104.9172J|pmc=1890466}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3173">The '''Keetch–Byram drought index''' ('''KBDI'''), created by John Keetch and George Byram in 1968 for the [[United States Department of Agriculture]]'s [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]], is a measure of [[drought]] conditions. It is commonly used for the purpose of predicting the likelihood and severity of [[wildfire]]. It is calculated based on rainfall, air temperature, and other [[meteorological]] factors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.srs.fs.usda.gov/pubs/viewpub.jsp?index=40 |title=A Drought Index for Forest Fire Control |authors=Keetch, John J.; Byram, George M. |date= |website=srs.fs.usda.gov |publisher=USDA Forest Service Southern Research Station |access-date=August 11, 2016 |quote=(Date: 1968) Res. Paper SE-38. 32 pp. Asheville, NC: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The KBDI is an estimate of the soil moisture deficit, which is the amount of water necessary to bring the [[Soil#Soil_moisture_content|soil moisture]] to its full capacity. A high soil moisture deficit means there is little water available for [[evaporation]] or plant [[transpiration]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Finkele|first1=Klara|last2=Mills|first2=Graham A.|title=National gridded drought factors and comparison of two soil moisture deficit formulations used in prediction of Forest Fire Danger Index in Australia|journal=Australian Meteorological Magazine|date=September 2006|volume=55|issue=3|pages=183–197}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This occurs in conditions of extended [[drought]], and has significant effects on fire behaviour. 

In the United States, it is expressed as a range from 0 to 800, referring to hundredths of an inch of deficit in water availability; in countries that use the [[metric system]], it is expressed from 0 to 200, referring to millimetres&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Weather and Bushfire Behaviour|url=https://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/23537/Bush-Fire-Bulletin-LIFTOUT-WeatherandBushFireBehaviour.pdf|publisher=NSW Rural Fire Service|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The process was developed in the 1980s by the Norwegian engineering firm [[Kværner]], and was first commercially exploited in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.interstatetraveler.us/Reference-Bibliography/Bellona-HydrogenReport.html|title = Bellona Report 6:02, "Hydrogen - Status and possibilities" Hydrogen technologies|publisher = Bellona Foundation|website = Interstate Traveler Company|accessdate = 13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In comparison to other reformation methods such as [[steam reforming]] and [[partial oxidation]] the natural gas is efficiently and completely transformed into pure carbon and hydrogen. Of the available energy of the feed, approximately 48% is contained in the hydrogen, 40% is contained in [[activated carbon]] and 10% in superheated steam.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014|reason = Claims for high efficiency and percentage yields of products unsupported.}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hfpeurope.org/infotools/energyinfos__e/hydrogen/main03.html hfpeurope.org]{{dead link|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Previously tagged as "secure page, not accesible"--&gt;

'''LArIAT''' ('''Liquid [[Argon]] In A Testbeam''') is a [[neutrino]] experiment located at the [[Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory]] (Fermilab), [[Chicago]]. It is capable of both accurately identifying and making precise 3D spatial and calorimetric measurements of particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Paley|first=J.|last2=Gastler|first2=D.|last3=Kearns|first3=E.|last4=Linehan|first4=R.|last5=Patterson|first5=R.|last6=Foremen|first6=W.|last7=Ho|first7=J.|last8=Schmitz|first8=D.|last9=Johnson|first9=R.|date=2014-06-20|title=LArIAT: Liquid Argon In A Testbeam|eprint=1406.5560|class=physics.ins-det}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://phys.org/news/2017-04-lariat-dune.html|title=LArIAT upgrade will test DUNE design|access-date=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, it is in the calibration phase of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.fnal.gov/2016/03/lariat-begins-taking-data-run-ii/|title=LArIAT begins taking data for Run II|date=2016-03-03|work=News|access-date=2017-08-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; At present, the LArIAT collaboration has more than 65 members from 17 institutions worldwide, including [[Yale University]], [[University of Manchester|the University of Manchester]], and [[KEK]].

== The LArIAT detector ==
LArIAT itself is a cylindrical cryostat with convex ends, capable of holding 550L of liquid argon. The cryostat is heavily insulated thermally, in part by a region of vacuum surrounding it. Inside the cryostat is the [[time projection chamber]], in which the argon atoms are ionized by beam particles. An electric field is applied across the chamber perpendicular to the beam direction, causing the ionization electrons to move towards the side,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.quantumdiaries.org/2015/05/05/new-beamline-at-fermilab-test-beam-facility-delivers-beam-to-lariat-a-liquid-argon-detector-for-neutrino-research/|title=Quantum Diaries|website=www.quantumdiaries.org|access-date=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; where they are detected by two wire planes oriented at ±30° to the vertical. These wire planes are made up of 240 parallel wires with a separation of 4mm. A third wire plane of 225 wires, aligned along the vertical axis, is placed in front of the other two planes in order to prevent the electric field from interfering with the instrumentation.

Ionization of liquid argon emits characteristic 128&amp;nbsp;nm light (in the violet/[[ultraviolet]] range), which is detected by a scintillation read-out system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kryczynski|first=P.|date=2016|title=Scintillation light detection system in LArIAT|url=http://stacks.iop.org/1748-0221/11/i=02/a=C02086|journal=Journal of Instrumentation|language=en|volume=11|issue=2|pages=C02086|doi=10.1088/1748-0221/11/02/C02086|issn=1748-0221|bibcode=2016JInst..11C2086K}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system has a high efficiency, having been designed using systems developed for [[dark matter]] liquid argon detectors. This gives LArIAT an advantage over other existing liquid argon detectors which are only able to perform calorimetry using the wire grids.

Before the human eyes can focus in on one frequency, another frequency comes on, causing [[intracranial pressure]], which results in [[headaches]], nausea, vomiting, disorientation, irritability, and visual impairment to the target (opponent).&lt;ref name=DHS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.homelandsecurity.org/snapshots/newsletter/2007-07.htm#sick |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723110013/http://www.homelandsecurity.org/snapshots/newsletter/2007-07.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-07-23 |title=Enough to Make You Sick |accessdate=2007-08-08   |date=July 2007 |work=S&amp;T Snapshots |publisher=Department of Homeland Security: Science and Technology Directorate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fox&gt;{{cite news |title=Flashlight Weapon Makes Targets Throw Up |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,292271,00.html |work=Fox News online |publisher=FOX News Network, LLC |date=August 7, 2007 |accessdate=2007-08-08 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=USA_Today&gt;{{cite news |first=Mimi |last=Hall |author2=Eric Moreno  |title=Is this a real-life 'light saber?' |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-08-07-lightsaber_N.htm |work=USA Today online  |date=8 August 2007 |accessdate=2007-08-08 |quote=The Homeland Security Department is aiming to arm federal agents with a light-saber-type weapon that emits a dazzling strobe capable of subduing criminals, terrorists and even unruly airline passengers.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Breeze&gt;{{cite news|first=Larry |last=Altman |title=Torrance firm sees the nonlethal 'light' |url=http://www.dailybreeze.com/news/articles/9029527.html?page=1&amp;c=y |work=DailyBreeze.com |publisher=Los Angeles Newspaper Group |date=August 8, 2007 |accessdate=2007-08-08 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928105048/http://www.dailybreeze.com/news/articles/9029527.html?page=1&amp;c=y |archivedate=2007-09-28 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;{{cite news|first=Prachi |last=Patel-Predd |title=The Incapacitating Flashlight: DHS Is Developing an LED Flashlight That Makes Culprits Vomit |url=http://www.abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=3450394&amp;page=1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070831001437/http://www.abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=3450394&amp;page=1 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=31 August 2007 |work=ABC News: Technology &amp; Science |publisher=ABCNews Internet Ventures |date=6 August 2007 |accessdate=2007-08-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The non-lethal weapon is intended as a means of protection by law enforcement officials such as police and border patrols. The light emitted is capable of rendering opponents temporarily blind so that they can be subdued more easily.

==Description==
According to the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]], the weapon works:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"By simultaneously overwhelming the subject both physiologically (temporarily blinding him) and psychophysically (disorienting him). A built-in range finder measures the distance to the nearest pair of eyeballs. Then, a “governor” sets the output and pulse train (a series of pulses and rests) to a level, frequency, and duration that are effective, but safe. The colors and pulses continuously change, leaving no time for the brain or eyes to adapt. After a few minutes, the effects wear off."&lt;ref name=DHS/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The manufacturer, Intelligent Optical Systems (IOS), was awarded an $800,000.00 contract by the United States [[Department of Homeland Security]]'s Small Business Innovation Research Office. As of August, 2007, the first phase of the contract, which called for the development of a prototype, has been completed. Later phases involve the testing of the prototype by the Institute of Nonlethal Defense at [[Pennsylvania State University]], and the development of a production version, planned to be more compact and easier to carry.&lt;ref name=DHS/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt;

Bob  Lieberman, president of IOS, said he envisions the device being used in "confrontations at border crossings with suspected illegal aliens or drug runners" among other possibilities.&lt;ref name=DHS/&gt; Projected users include "air marshals, border patrol agents, other officers with the Transportation Security Administration and customs officers" according to Gerald Kirwin of IOS.&lt;ref name=USA_Today/&gt; "In that few seconds, the officer has a tactical advantage and will actually close in to subdue or control the potential adversary," Lieberman said.&lt;ref name=Breeze/&gt; The device can be used from ranges of up to 30 feet, while other non-lethal devices require an officer to approach the target much more closely, according to Lieberman.&lt;ref name=Breeze/&gt;

Glenn Shwaery, a researcher in nonlethal technology at the [[University of New Hampshire]], says "If you disorient or distract somebody and cause them to look away, then they can't focus on their task, which could be aiming a weapon at someone, or looking at a screen with sensitive information, or dialing a phone."&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt; Shwaery says that an LED-based device could be safer than a laser-based device intended to achieve the same effects "Getting an eye-safe wavelength with a laser has been very difficult."&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt; Shwaery says that the presence of a range-finder and circuitry to modify the intensity of the light depending on the range in the LED device increases its safety. "The ideal goal for nonlethal technologies is that they be scalable."&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt; It was intended to be released to police, border patrol agents and National Guardsmen by 2010.

==Deficiencies==
Some test subjects have been completely unaffected by the light, and although the manufacturer makes claims about the product's effectiveness, the CEO of Intelligent Optics, the producer of the device, has commented "I don’t think we've had anyone actually be sick." There is debate over how well the devices work and what their effects are.&lt;ref name=wired&gt;
{{cite news|first=David |last=Hambling |title=Can Strobe Weapons Really Make You Puke? |url=http://blog.wired.com/defense/2008/05/strobe-weapons.html |work=wired.com |date=May 14, 2008 |accessdate=2009-11-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421032307/http://blog.wired.com/defense/2008/05/strobe-weapons.html |archivedate=April 21, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Some critics have questioned the desirability of developing and deploying such a device for border security use. Deborah Notkin, president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association said: "It gives me pause, particularly in regards to Mexico. Mexico is a very important economic partner of ours. I would imagine that Mexico wouldn't be particularly happy with us using a device that would be more appropriate for criminals, not just for people trying to get across the border who are looking for better opportunities.  "&lt;ref name=USA_Today/&gt;

In regards to the statement above it must also be noted that people entering the United States illegally are criminals.

Peter Herby, head of the legal division  of the "mines-arms unit" at the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]], suggests that such a device may raise many of the same issues as have arisen with laser-based blinding weapons, known as "[[Dazzler (weapon)|dazzler]]s" because of the intense light with which they temporarily or permanently blind people. He also raises the issue of a possible black market in such weapons. "Once they're in the hands of bad guys are the police going to have to wear protective gear to prevent them[selves] from being dazzled?" Herby states that he is not familiar with this specific device.&lt;ref name=USA_Today/&gt;

However Lieberman of IOS says: "We're taking great care to make sure the intensities we're using fall within eye-safe limit. We're doing medically supervised tests."&lt;ref name=USA_Today/&gt;

'''Mathematical visualization''' is an aspect of [[geometry]] which allows one to understand and explore mathematical phenomena via [[Visualization (graphic)|visualization]]. Classically this consisted of two-dimensional drawings or building three-dimensional models (particularly plaster models in the 19th and early 20th century), while today it most frequently consists of [[Scientific computing|using computers]] to make static two or three dimensional drawings, animations, or interactive programs. Writing programs to visualize mathematics is an aspect of [[computational geometry]].

==Applications==
Mathematical visualization is used throughout mathematics, particularly in the fields of [[geometry]] and [[analysis]]. Notable examples include [[plane curve]]s, [[space curve]]s, [[polyhedra]], [[ordinary differential equation]]s, [[partial differential equation]]s (particularly numerical solutions, as in [[fluid dynamics]] or [[minimal surface]]s such as [[soap film]]s), [[conformal map]]s, [[fractal]]s, and [[Chaos theory|chaos]].

==Examples==
[[File:Chinese pythagoras.jpg|thumb|A [[proof without words]] of the [[Pythagorean theorem]] in [[Zhoubi Suanjing]].]]
* [[Proofs without words]] have existed since antiquity, as in the Pythagorean theorem proof found in the ''Zhoubi Suanjing'' Chinese text which dates from 1046 BC to 256 BC.
* The [[Clebsch diagonal surface]] demonstrates the [[27 lines on a cubic surface]].
[[File:MorinSurfaceFromTheTop.PNG|thumb|A [[Morin surface]], the half-way stage in [[sphere eversion|turning a sphere inside out]].]]
* [[Sphere eversion]] – that a sphere can be turned inside out in 3 dimension if allowed to pass through itself, but without kinks – was a startling and counter-intuitive result, originally proven via abstract means, later demonstrated graphically, first in drawings, later in computer animation.
The cover of the journal ''The [[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]]'' regularly features a mathematical visualization.

The '''Misicuni Multiplepurpose Project''', better known as the '''Misicuni Dam''', is a [[concrete-face rock-fill dam]] partly constructed on the Misicuni River about {{Convert|35|km|mi|abbr=on}} northwest of the city of [[Cochabamba]], [[Bolivia]]. The dam will divert water from the Misicuni River to the Cochabamba Valley for several purposes to include providing water for [[irrigation]] and [[municipal water]] uses. In addition, the dam will have an associated 80 MW [[hydroelectric]] power station when complete. Construction on the dam began in June 2009 but was halted in November 2013 due to contract disputes. The company finished the construction and is starting the operations by September 2017 .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CFRD project update|url=http://www.erbol.com.bo/noticia/regional/18082017/hidroelectrica_misicuni_arranca_en_septiembre}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bolivia seeks bids to complete interrupted dam work on 80-MW Misicuni hydro project|url=http://www.hydroworld.com/articles/2014/05/bolivia-seeks-bids-to-complete-interrupted-dam-work-on-80-mw-misicuni-hydro-project.html|publisher=Hydro World|accessdate=6 January 2015|date=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics and costs==
The project has three components:
 
* Phase I includes an already completed 20&amp;nbsp;km tunnel with the capacity to provide 2 cubic meters per second of drinking water and 1 cubic meter per second for irrigation to Cochabamba and the surrounding areas. Its cost was US$84 million.
* Phase II includes a 120-meter-high [[concrete-face rock-fill dam]] with a 460-hectare reservoir with a storage capacity of 154 million cubic meters, as well as pipelines, pumping stations, a water treatment plant and an irrigation network to irrigate 4,000 hectares (under construction as of 2013). Its cost was also estimated at US$84 million,
* Phase III includes a hydropower plant with an installed capacity of 80 MW at an estimated cost of US$200 million (under construction since April 2010). Water will be diverted from the reservoir through a {{Convert|3.8|km|mi|abbr=on}} long [[penstock]] to the plant.&lt;ref name=HydroWorld&gt;{{cite web|title=Bolivia signs Italian firm to build Misicuni Dam|url=http://www.hydroworld.com/articles/2009/05/bolivia-signs-italian-firm-to-build-misicuni-dam.html|publisher=HydroWorld|accessdate=9 December 2013|date=28 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Profile&gt;{{cite web|title=Misicuni Dam Profile|url=http://www.dams-info.org/en/dams/view/misicuni/|publisher=dams-info.org|accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WASHNEWS1&gt;{{cite web|title=Bolivia, Cochabamba: work on Misicuni dam and water supply services set to start |url=http://washlac.wordpress.com/2009/01/28/bolivia-cochabamba-work-on-misicuni-dam-and-water-supply-services-set-to-start/ |accessdate=9 December 2013 |date=28 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131218122745/http://washlac.wordpress.com/2009/01/28/bolivia-cochabamba-work-on-misicuni-dam-and-water-supply-services-set-to-start/ |archivedate=18 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dam will be the highest and largest dam in Bolivia.&lt;ref name=Op3Apr12&gt;{{Cite news | last = Fernández | first = Jorge | title = Represa de Misicuni llega a 24 metros de altura y avance de 25 por ciento | work = Opinión | location = Cochabamba | accessdate = 2012-07-26 | date = 2012-04-03 | url = http://www.opinion.com.bo/opinion/articulos/2012/0403/noticias.php?id=50565 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Misicuni project director Ramiro Saniz said in 2009 that the water from the Misicuni river is not sufficient to fill the reservoir and that other sources are needed.&lt;ref name=WASHNEWS1/&gt;

==Background and construction progress==
The public company in charge of developing the project is Proyecto Misicuni, an entity created by law in 1987. The contractor for the US$90 million dam component is the ''Consorcio Hidroelectrico Misicuni'' (CHM). The Misicuni consortium, led with 51 percent ownership by Grandi Lavori Fincosit S.p.A. of Italy, was the sole bidder for the project. Bidding was limited to Italian companies and CHM was the only company to submit a bid.&lt;ref name=HydroWorld/&gt;&lt;ref name=WASHNEWS1/&gt; The consortium also includes Bolivian, Colombian and Venezuelan firms.&lt;ref name=WASHNEWS2&gt;{{cite web|title=Bolivia: Italian government to provide US$93mn for Misicuni project|url=http://washlac.wordpress.com/tag/misicuni-multipurpose-project/|accessdate=9 December 2013|date=6 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dam component was originally expected to be completed in 2014. However, in November 2013 the contract was canceled amid delays because CHM "failed to pay for pension funds, health insurances and other labour benefits and to contract key technical personnel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bolivia's Empresa Misicuni cancels contract for dam construction|url=http://renewables.seenews.com/news/bolivias-empresa-misicuni-cancels-contract-for-dam-comstruction-392246|publisher=SeeNews. Renewables.|accessdate=8 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
The tunnel provides 4.5-7.5 million cubic meters of water per year to Cochabamba since 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Proyecto Misicuni: Volumines entregados a SEMAPA 2005-2013|url=http://www.misicuni.net/|publisher=Empresa Misicuni|accessdate=8 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; depending on whether the flow of the river is low or high and supplying about 10 percent of the city's drinking water. Once the dam will be completed, the amount of drinking water available will increase tenfold to 63 million cubic meters per year.

==Environmental and social impact==
1365 people live in the reservoir area that will be flooded and will be relocated. The [[Tunari National Park]] will also be affected.&lt;ref name=Profile/&gt;

==Financing==
The dam is partially financed by the Italian government through a 25 million Euro loan and the [[CAF - Development Bank of Latin America|Development Bank of Latin America]] (CAF).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Vásquez | first = Katiuska | title = Gobernador no descarta que Misicuni pierda crédito italiano | work = Los Tiempos | accessdate = 2012-07-26 | date = 2012-07-23 | url = http://www.lostiempos.com/diario/actualidad/local/20120723/gobernador-no-descarta-que-misicuni-pierda-credito_179427_379213.html | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120726181302/http://www.lostiempos.com/diario/actualidad/local/20120723/gobernador-no-descarta-que-misicuni-pierda-credito_179427_379213.html | archivedate = 2012-07-26 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Total funding from Italy for Phased II and III is USD 93 million. Bolivia will have to pay back the loan over in 20 years with a 0.10% interest rate.&lt;ref name=WASHNEWS2/&gt;

The construction of the penstock, hydropower plant and power transmission line is funded by a US$101 million loan from the [[Inter-American Development Bank]] approved in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BO-L1043 : Misicuni Renewable Energy Hydroelectric Project|url=http://www.iadb.org/en/projects/project-description-title,1303.html?id=bo-l1043|publisher=IDB|accessdate=8 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These works were expected to be completed by 2015, but were only 30 percent completed as of April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IDB BO-L1043 - Misicuni Renewable Energy Hydroelectric Project: Progress Monitoring Report May 2013|url=http://idbdocs.iadb.org/wsdocs/getdocument.aspx?docnum=37875045|publisher=Inter-American Development Bank|accessdate=8 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2112">The '''OK-150 reactor''' (1st generation) and its successor, the '''OK-900 reactor''' (2nd generation) are [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] marine [[nuclear fission]] [[nuclear reactor|reactor]]s used to power ships at sea. They are [[pressurized water reactor]]s (PWRs) that use [[enriched uranium|enriched]] [[uranium-235]] fuel. They have been used in various [[Russia]]n [[nuclear-powered icebreaker]] ships. The reactor was developed by [[OKBM]].

OK-150 specifications:
*Fuel: 5% enriched uranium in the form of [[ceramic]] [[uranium dioxide]] ({{chem|UO|2}}) fuel elements with a cladding. Different cladding materials were used; initially [[zirconium]], later on, [[stainless steel]] as well as a zirconium-[[niobium]] alloy were tried.
*Fuel load: 75 to 85 kilograms
*Power production: 90 megawatts

Distilled water was used for heat transfer and as a moderator.
The core was 1.6 m high by 1 m diameter. It consisted of 219 fuel assemblies, totalling 7,704 fuel pins. There was a biological shield made of [[concrete]] mixed with metal shavings.

OK-900A specifications:
*Fuel: 90% enriched uranium in the form of [[metal]]lic uranium-zirconium alloy fuel elements
*Fuel load: 150.7&amp;nbsp;kg
*Power production: 171 megawatts

Three OK-150s were used to power the [[Soviet icebreaker Lenin|Soviet icebreaker ''Lenin'']] at the time of its launch in 1957. Later, after damage caused by nuclear accidents in 1965 and 1967, these were removed and replaced with two OK-900s.

The '''Pacific Plate''' is an oceanic [[Plate tectonics|tectonic plate]] that lies beneath the [[Pacific Ocean]]. At {{convert|103|e6km2|sqmi}}, it is the largest tectonic plate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ees1.lanl.gov/Wohletz/SFT-Tectonics.htm|title=SFT and the Earth's Tectonic Plates|publisher=[[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]|accessdate=27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pacific Plate contains an interior [[Hotspot (geology)|hot spot]] forming the [[Hawaiian Islands]].&lt;ref name="fmb"/&gt;

Hillis and Müller are reported to consider the [[Bird's Head Plate]] to be moving in unison with the Pacific Plate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Evolution and Dynamics of the Australian Plate |last=Hillis |first=R.

==Boundaries==
The north-eastern side is a [[divergent boundary]] with the [[Explorer Plate]], the [[Juan de Fuca Plate]] and the [[Gorda Plate]] forming respectively the [[Explorer Ridge]], the [[Juan de Fuca Ridge]] and the [[Gorda Ridge]]. In the middle of the eastern side is a [[transform boundary]] with the [[North American Plate]] along the [[San Andreas Fault]], and a boundary with the [[Cocos Plate]]. The south-eastern side is a [[divergent boundary]] with the [[Nazca Plate]] forming the [[East Pacific Rise]]. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The southern side is a [[divergent boundary]] with the [[Antarctic Plate]] forming the [[Pacific-Antarctic Ridge]]. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The western side, the plate is bounded by the [[Okhotsk Plate]] at the [[Kuril-Kamchatka Trench]] and the [[Japan Trench]], forms a [[convergent boundary]] by subducting under the [[Philippine Sea Plate]] creating the [[Mariana Trench]], has a [[transform boundary]] with the [[Caroline Plate]], and has a collision boundary with the [[North Bismarck Plate]]. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

In the south-west, the Pacific Plate has a complex but generally convergent boundary with the [[Indo-Australian Plate]], subducting under it north of [[New Zealand]] forming the [[Tonga Trench]] and the [[Kermadec Trench]]. The [[Alpine Fault]] marks a [[transform boundary]] between the two plates, and further south the Indo-Australian Plate subducts under the Pacific Plate forming the [[Puysegur trench|Puysegur Trench]]. The southern part of [[Zealandia (continent)|Zealandia]], which is to the east of this boundary, is the plate's largest block of continental crust. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The northern side is a [[convergent boundary]] subducting under the [[North American Plate]] forming the [[Aleutian Trench]] and the corresponding [[Aleutian Islands]].

==Paleo-geology of the Pacific Plate==
The Pacific Plate is almost entirely [[oceanic crust]], but it contains some [[continental crust]] in [[New Zealand]], [[Baja California]], and coastal [[California]].&lt;ref name="fmb"&gt;{{citation|title=Plate Tectonics: Continental Drift and Mountain Building|first1=Wolfgang|last1=Frisch|first2=Martin|last2=Meschede|first3=Ronald C.|last3=Blakey|publisher=Springer|year=2010|isbn=9783540765042|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vx1oiTMOTRcC&amp;pg=PA11|pages=11–12}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pacific Plate has the distinction of showing one of the largest areal sections of the oldest members of seabed geology being entrenched into eastern Asian [[oceanic trench]]es. A [[geologic map]] of the Pacific Ocean seabed shows not only the geologic sequences, and associated [[Pacific Ring of Fire|Ring of Fire]] zones on the ocean's perimeters, but the various ages of the seafloor in a stairstep fashion, youngest to oldest, the oldest being consumed into the Asian oceanic trenches. The oldest member disappearing by way of the [[Plate Tectonics]] cycle is early-[[Cretaceous]] (145 to 137 million years ago).&lt;ref&gt;[http://wserver.crc.losrios.edu/~jacksoh/Images/crustageposter.gif Age of the Ocean Floor]&lt;/ref&gt;

All maps of the Earth's ocean floor geology show ages younger than 145 million years, only about 1/30 of the Earth's 4.55 billion year history. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

* Standard or baseline definitions of essential terminology
* Best practices for developing a data governance strategy
* Education and training around data management standards
* Certification for E&amp;P (exploration and production) data management professionals.

==PPDM and the Need to Organize Petroleum Data==

Historically, petroleum data has been managed and analyzed using many different proprietary systems. These systems are typically built based on local terminology and business needs, and use different practices for identifying, gathering, transferring and interpreting information. A typical operating company may use dozens (or even hundreds) of software applications. Each department is tuned to the needs of different segments of the company; production accounting, field operations,  seismic exploration, reserves management and financial departments all store information about wells in their respective software applications.&lt;ref&gt;First Break Magazine [https://web.archive.org/web/20101115212028/http://www.ppdm.org/resources/resource-index/2010/09/13/standards-based-knowledge-environments-for-the-oil-and-gas-industry], ''First Break'', January, 2005, accessed January 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, one Calgary-based oil company and several of its software suppliers recognized that a non-proprietary data model was preferable to separate and private models. The creation of a comprehensive data model is an expensive and lengthy process. A private data model precludes the purchase of third-party software and other data-dependent services, without expensive customization. Therefore, a group of technical experts began work on a “public” model, and other companies responded to the invitation to participate.

As the model developed, more companies accepted the concept of non-competitive collaboration and recognized that there is little competitive advantage to using an exclusive private data model. In 1991 the cooperative workgroup was incorporated in Alberta as a not-for-profit society, the [[Public Petroleum Data Model Association]].

The initial data modeling efforts were on the requirements for well data in a relational database management system. Throughout the 1990s, the scope expanded to land rights, seismic surveys, well production and reserves, stratigraphy, records management, etc. Version 3.8 of the PPDM Model, released in 2008, covers 53 subject areas and has over 1700 tables.

In 2008, the name was changed to the Professional Petroleum Data Management Association. This acknowledges the expansion of the products and services beyond just the data model, and emphasizes the focus on developing the professional practice of data management for the petroleum industry.

== The Data Model ==
The PPDM Model is suitable for a [[master data management]] system. The specifications [[Data definition language|DDL]] are provided for use in Oracle and SQL Server systems. In addition, the modular design allows selected portions to be used in business-specific databases and applications.

Although it was originally called a public model, it was never freely distributed by the Association. “Public” always meant “non-proprietary” not “free.” The way to get the Model was (and still is) to become a member of the Association. However, many non-members around the world continue to use versions or adaptations of the PPDM model, usually because the model is embedded in a database or application purchased from a software provider. PPDM Lite, a simplified model based on Version 3.7, is available free to any registered user on the PPDM website.

The PPDM Model is a set of specifications for creating a relational database. It is NOT a set of data for the petroleum industry. By analogy, the model is only the blueprint for a huge pigeon loft (birdhouse); it does not have birds already in the pigeon-holes. However, the Model contains a vast amount of knowledge about the industry’s business practices (how the data are acquired and used.) The Association estimates that Version 3.8 represents over $100 million of invested funds and human resources since inception.&lt;ref&gt;PPDM website {{cite web |url=http://www.ppdm.org/ppdm-standards/ppdm-3-8-data-model |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120906085538/http://www.ppdm.org/ppdm-standards/ppdm-3-8-data-model |archivedate=2012-09-06 |df= }}, ''PPDM Version 3.8 Data Model, December, 2011, accessed December 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
.

== Membership ==
The PPDM Association is a member-based society. Membership is open to corporations and individuals from around the world. The membership fee structure is based on the member’s financial size (revenues.) Over half the annual revenue is from companies based in the USA; the balance is from Canada and the rest of the world. Associate membership is available to individuals.

Most of the activities of the Association are financed by the annual membership fees and carried out by people who work for the member companies. Special projects are funded by sponsoring companies who provide additional funds and specialist personnel. The Association’s office in Calgary has a small staff for technical support, communication, and administration.

The members are represented by a board of directors. Each director is elected by the members to a term of two years (renewable.) They are mainly from large oil companies and software or data vendors.

== Product Development Process ==
The real power of the Association, and the quality of its products, is rooted in the cooperative approach to development, “The PPDM Way.” When several members recognize a data management need (e.g. expand the data model to a new subject area, or promote best practices for data governance), a draft charter is prepared. If the charter is approved by the PPDM board of directors, and sufficient resources are committed by the members, a workgroup is formed.

Companies supply the workgroup participants who identify the business requirements in detail, and develop the technical solutions. Workgroup meetings are typically spread out over a year or more because the participants continue to be active in their regular employment.

== Improving Communication ==
Semantic misunderstanding causes data errors and mistakes in analysis of the data. In 2009, the PPDM Association developed a set of baseline definitions for a "Well" and its main components. These definitions are useful for comparison with the specific definitions used by key industry data providers, aggregators, and operating companies. The "What Is A Well?"&lt;ref&gt;PPDM website {{cite web |url=http://www.ppdm.org/work-groups/what-is-a-well |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120909105934/http://www.ppdm.org/work-groups/what-is-a-well |archivedate=2012-09-09 |df= }}, ''What Is A Well? website'', December, 2011, accessed December 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; definitions are a "Rosetta stone" framework for the petroleum industry.

'''Smith's Cloud''' is a [[high-velocity cloud]] of [[hydrogen]] gas located in the constellation [[Aquila (constellation)|Aquila]] at [[Galactic coordinates]] ''l''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;39°, ''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−13°. The cloud was discovered in 1963 by Gail Bieger, ''[[née]]'' Smith, who was an astronomy student at [[Leiden University]] in the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name=newscientist /&gt;&lt;ref name=smith&gt;{{cite journal | bibcode=1963BAN....17..203S | title=Peculiar Feature at l = 40°.5, b = - 15°.0 | year=1963 | author=Smith, G.P. | journal=Bulletin of the Astronomical Institutes of the Netherlands | volume=17 | pages=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cloud is apparently moving towards the disk of the [[Milky Way]] at 73&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;26 [[kilometer]]s per second. Smith's Cloud is expected to merge with the Milky Way in 27&amp;nbsp;million years at a point in the [[Perseus arm]]. Astronomers believe it will strike the Milky Way disk at a 45° angle, and its impact may produce a burst of [[star formation]] or a supershell of neutral hydrogen.&lt;ref name=lockman /&gt;

Projecting the cloud's trajectory backwards through time, it is estimated that it had passed through the disk of the Milky Way some 70 million years ago. To have survived this previous encounter, astronomers have suggested that it is embedded inside a massive [[dark matter halo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Nichols | first1 = M. | last2 = Bland-Hawthorn | first2 = J. | doi = 10.1088/0004-637X/707/2/1642 | title = The Smith Cloud: High-Velocity Accretion and Dark Matter Confinement | journal = The Astrophysical Journal | volume = 707 | issue = 2 | pages = 1642 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | pmc = | bibcode = 2009ApJ...707.1642N| arxiv = 0911.0684}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that it survived this previous encounter means that it is likely to be much more massive than previously thought, and may be a candidate for being a [[dark galaxy]].&lt;ref&gt;New Scientist, [https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20427354.200-dark-galaxy-crashing-into-the-milky-way.html "Dark galaxy crashing into the Milky Way"], 22 November 2009, Issue 2735 (accessed 12-12-2009)&lt;/ref&gt; In this scenario it would be a failed [[dwarf galaxy]], with the ingredients to form a stellar galaxy, but few if any detectable stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/05/140523145137.htm |title= Failed dwarf galaxy survives galactic collision thanks to full dark-matter jacket |date= 23 May 2014 |publisher= ScienceDaily |author= 
National Radio Astronomy Observatory |accessdate= 24 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, chemical abundance measurements from the Hubble Space Telescope argue against this hypothesis; these measurements show that the Smith Cloud has an average metallicity of one half of the solar value, indicating that its gas originates in the Galaxy, not from an extragalactic source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Fox|first = Andrew J.|last2 = Lehner|first2 = Nicolas|last3 = Lockman|first3 = Felix J.|last4 = Wakker|first4 = Bart P.|last5 = Hill|first5 = Alex S.|last6 = Heitsch|first6 = Fabian|last7 = Stark|first7 = David V.|last8 = Barger|first8 = Kathleen A.|last9 = Sembach|first9 = Kenneth R.|title = ON THE METALLICITY AND ORIGIN OF THE SMITH HIGH-VELOCITY CLOUD|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.3847/2041-8205/816/1/L11|journal = The Astrophysical Journal|volume = 816|issue = 1|doi = 10.3847/2041-8205/816/1/l11|arxiv = 1512.04957 |bibcode = 2016ApJ...816L..11F }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cloud's orbit and metallicity are both consistent with an origin in the outer disk of the Milky Way. The mechanism by which this gas was released is not known.

'''Solar dryers''' are devices that use [[solar energy]] to dry substances, especially [[food]]. There are two general types of solar dryers: Direct and indirect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Norton|first=Brian|title=Harnessing Solar Heat|date=2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-94-007-7275-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Direct ==
[[File:Direct Solar dryder.svg|300px|alt=A schematic of a direct solar dryer|A schematic of a direct solar dryer|right]]
Direct solar dryers expose the substance to be dehydrated to direct [[sunlight]]. Historically, food and clothing was dried in the sun by using [[Clothes line|lines]], or laying the items on rocks or on top of tents.&lt;ref name="FAO"&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Heinz, Gunter  |author2=Hautzinger, Peter  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2007 |chapter=Meat drying |title=Meat processing technology for small- to medium-scale producers |series=RAP Publication 2007/20 |location=Bangkok, Thailand |publisher=Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations |isbn=978-974-7946-99-4 |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/ai407e/ai407e18.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100523163235/http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/ai407e/AI407E18.htm |archivedate=23 May 2010 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Mongolia cheese and meat are still traditionally dried using the top of the [[Yurt|ger]] (tent) as a solar dryer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Oyunbayar, N. |title=Mongolian Food: Meat, milk and Mongolia |publisher=Mongoluls.Net |url=http://www.mongoluls.net/ger/meatmilk.shtml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050405194906/http://mongoluls.net/ger/meatmilk.shtml |archivedate=5 April 2005 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these systems the solar drying is assisted by the movement of the air (wind) that removes the more saturated air away from the items being dried.&lt;ref name="FAO" /&gt; More recently, complex drying racks&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |year=1999 |author=Shaffer, Marcella |title=Solar Food Drying |magazine=Backwoods Home Magazine |issue=58 |url=http://www.backwoodshome.com/articles/shaffer58.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000816011755/http://www.backwoodshome.com/articles/shaffer58.html |archivedate=16 August 2000 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and solar tents&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Trim, D.

One modern type of solar dryer has a [[Albedo|black]] [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorbing surface]] which collects the light and converts it to heat; the substance to be dried is placed directly on this surface. These driers may have enclosures, glass covers and/or vents to in order to increase [[efficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|author=Fodor, Eben |year=2006 |title=Build a Solar Food Dehydrator |magazine=Mother Earth News |volume=2006 |issue=August/September |pages=66–70 |url=http://www.solarfooddryer.com/Info/Mother_Earth_News_Article.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6bFmZNTEM |archivedate=2 September 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Indirect ==
[[File:Solar Food Dryer.jpg|thumb|Industrial indirect solar fruit and vegetable dryer]]
In indirect solar dryers, the black surface heats incoming air, rather than directly heating the substance to be dried. This heated air is then passed over the substance to be dried and exits upwards often through a [[chimney]], taking [[moisture]] released from the substance with it.&lt;ref name="FAO" /&gt; They can be very simple, just a tilted cold frame with black cloth&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Robishaw, Sue |year=1999 |title=Drying Food with the Sun |journal=Countryside &amp; Small Stock Journal |volume=1999 |issue=July/August |url=http://www.countrysidemag.com/83-4-sue-robishaw/ |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6bFmmNx9d |archivedate=2 September 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; to an insulated brick building with active [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] and a back-up heating system.&lt;ref name="Weiss"&gt;{{Cite web|author1=Weiss, Werner  |author2=Buchinger, Josef  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2001 |title=Solar Drying |publisher=Austrian Development Cooperation and Institute for Sustainable Technologies (AEE INTEC) |url=http://www.aee-intec.at/0uploads/dateien553.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120526151427/http://www.aee-intec.at/0uploads/dateien553.pdf |archivedate=26 May 2012 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the advantages of the indirect system is that it is easier to protect the food, or other substance, from contamination whether wind-blown or by birds, insects, or animals.&lt;ref name="FAO" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Weiss" /&gt; Also, direct sun can chemically alter some foods making them less appetizing.&lt;ref name="FAO" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Weiss" /&gt;

As of May 2017, the feasibility studies and [[Environmental assessment|environmental and social impact assessment]] (ESIA) had been completed. The final design had been agreed upon. Commitment of funding from potential investors was being sought.&lt;ref name="Four"/&gt;

==Construction==
The [[African Development Bank]] (AfDB) funded the [[Feasibility study|feasibility and design studies]]. The final design report was expected at the end of 2015. Other administrative and funding matters were expected to conclude in 2016. Construction was expected to start after that and conclude in 2022. Each country will be allocated {{convert|90|MW}} from this project.&lt;ref name="One"/&gt;

The total cost of the project is quoted at US$829 million, to  be shared equally by the two countries. The AfDB has expressed willingness to fund this project.&lt;ref name="Four"/&gt;

'''Southwest Airlines Flight 1248''' (WN1248, SWA1248) was a scheduled passenger flight from [[Baltimore, Maryland]], to [[Chicago, Illinois]], to [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], and then to [[Las Vegas, Nevada]]. On December 8, 2005, the airplane slid off a runway at [[Chicago-Midway]] while landing in a snowstorm and crashed into automobile traffic, killing six-year-old Joshua Woods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aviationpros.com/press_release/10432382/southwest-family-of-midway-victim-reach-settlement|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|title=Southwest, Family of Midway Victim Reach Settlement|publisher=AviationPros.Com|date=April 3, 2007|accessdate=February 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-12-10/news/0512100136_1_stearney-jet-indiana-family|last1=Sadovi|first1=Carlos|last2=Casillas|first2=Ofelia|last3=Presecky|first3=William|last4=Heinzmann|first4=David|last5=Doyle|first5=Gerry|title=A father's horror: He saw jet coming|newspaper=The Chicago Tribune|date=December 10, 2005|accessdate=February 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2007/US/10/02/ntsb.chicago.crash/index.html?iref=newssearch|last=Koch|first=Kathleen|title=NTSB: Pilot erred in runway crash that killed boy|publisher=CNN|date=October 2, 2007|accessdate=February 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the first accident involving the airline to result in the death of someone not on the plane itself.

On Thursday, December 8, 2005, [[Southwest Airlines]] Flight 1248 was scheduled to arrive at [[Chicago Midway International Airport]] from [[Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport]], and then continue on to [[Salt Lake City International Airport]], then to [[Las Vegas McCarran International Airport]]. The flight circled over a small area in northwest [[Indiana]] several times before attempting to land in a [[snowstorm]]. The snowstorm had reduced visibility to less than one mile.&lt;ref name="SWA Release"&gt;{{cite web

At around 7:15 PM [[Central Time Zone (North America)|CST]], the pilot attempted a landing with nearly eight inches of snow on the ground in the area. Airport officials stated that the runway was cleared of snow prior to the time of landing. The latest reported weather had the wind from between east and east-southeast (100°) at {{convert|11|kn|km/h|0}}.

A south easterly wind would normally favor landing into the wind on runway 13 Center. The [[runway visual range]] was reported at {{convert|4500|ft|m|sigfig=2}}, below the landing minimums for the [[Instrument Landing System]] approach to runway 13C. The only available runway with lower minimums was the opposite direction on 31C, which the crew selected, with the aircraft's [[groundspeed]] consequentially boosted by the tailwind.&lt;ref name="NTSB Release"&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = October 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Alternately, the crew could have held in the air, waiting for the weather to improve, or they could have diverted to another airport, such as [[O'Hare International Airport|Chicago O'Hare International]], whose substantially longer runways were 10 minutes' flying time away. Each of these options would have entailed considerable additional expense for Southwest, as well as missed connections and significant inconvenience for the flight's passengers.  The [[National Transportation Safety Board]] identified the psychological pressure to complete their assigned task as one of the factors contributing to the crew's decision to land at Midway despite unfavorable conditions. Cockpit voice-recorder transcripts indicate the pilots had been concerned about the weather and, prior to landing, jokingly alluded to the movie ''[[Airplane!]],'' saying, "I picked a bad day to stop [[Intoxicative inhalant|sniffin' glue.]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The NTSB preliminary report determined that the aircraft touched down in the touchdown zone of the runway with {{convert|4500|ft|m|sigfig=2}} of its {{convert|6522|ft|m|0|adj=on|sigfig=4}} length remaining; under the prevailing conditions of weather, wind, speed, and weight, the aircraft needed {{convert|5300|ft|m|sigfig=2}} of runway to stop safely.&lt;ref name="20051216 Trib"&gt;{{cite news

A preliminary [[NTSB]] advisory says: "The flying pilot (Captain) stated that he could not get the [[thrust reverser|reverse thrust]] levers out of the stowed position. The first officer, after several seconds, noticed that the thrust reversers were not deployed, and activated the reversers without a problem.  [[Flight data recorder]] information reveals that the thrust reversers were not deployed until 18 seconds after touchdown, at which point there was only about {{convert|1000|ft|m|sigfig=1}} of usable runway remaining."&lt;ref name="NTSB Release" /&gt;

The 737 skidded during landing; subsequently, witnesses said the [[Landing gear|nosegear]] collapsed and the aircraft crashed into a barrier wall surrounding the airport, coming to rest on Central Avenue just south of the 55th Street intersection at the northwestern corner of the airport. The intersection was full of traffic, and the airplane hit at least three cars, killing a six-year-old boy named Joshua Woods, critically injuring five occupants of one car (two adults and three children), and seriously injuring four occupants of a second car. All were quickly taken to area hospitals. Three passengers from the aircraft were taken to hospitals with minor injuries. All tolled, twelve people were taken to hospitals after the incident. One other car hit was parked and unoccupied.&lt;ref name="20051209 BBC"&gt;{{cite news

==Aftermath==
The aircraft, a [[Boeing]] [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|737-700]] with tail number {{Airreg|N|471WN|,}} was delivered to Southwest in July 2004.  As a "Next Generation" model, the 737 was equipped with the latest anti-skid and braking technology. The report noted that Southwest had only very recently begun actually using the [[autobrake]] systems, and that pilot training on proper use of auto brakes had been inadequate.

The [[National Transportation Safety Board]] was reported to be investigating, and [[Chicago Fire Department]] Commissioner Cortez Trotter said the aircraft would not be removed from the intersection until the NTSB gave clearance to do so following its on-site investigation.  The nose of the aircraft was hoisted onto a flatbed tractor-trailer on Saturday, December 10, and the 737 was towed to a hangar for continued inspection.

It is now recommended practice for any new runway to have a clear area at least {{convert|1000|ft|m|-2}} long at each end, called a 'runway safety area', to allow additional space for an aircraft that overruns the runway to decelerate and stop in relative safety. {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} As Midway was constructed before these rules were put in place, it does not have this safety area. The accident renewed debates on the need for, and feasibility of, an [[engineered materials arrestor system]], or EMAS, at Chicago Midway, given the lack of adequate overrun areas, and the surrounding residential neighborhoods. Additionally, actions taken by the city to acquire land for a buffer zone around the airport (in apparent recognition of the hazard) came to light after the crash.&lt;ref name="20051216 Trib" /&gt; In 2007, installation began on modified, short-length arrestor beds. The first one was completed at the end of Runway 31C by summer 2007. EMAS beds have also been installed at the end of 04R, 13C and 22L.

The accident occurred 33 years to the day after [[United Airlines Flight 553]], also a Boeing 737, crashed while approaching Midway Airport, killing 45.&lt;ref name="UAL553 NTSB"&gt;{{cite web

The accident involving Flight 1248 was the first Southwest Airlines accident in the 35-year history of the company to result in a fatality. The previous major incident was in 2000 when [[Southwest Airlines Flight 1455]] overran a runway at [[Burbank, California]], injuring 43 and narrowly avoiding a catastrophe; the aircraft ended up outside a Chevron gas station. Although the Midway accident killed a person on the ground rather than a passenger or crew member, Southwest followed the tradition of retiring any flight number involved in a fatal crash; current flights from Baltimore to Chicago departing at or around 3:55 PM were designated Flight 1885 until that flight number was moved to a different flight (the nearest departure times on this route now have flight numbers 4279 and 269, operated with a larger [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Boeing 737-800]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flight Finder - KBWI to KMDW - FlightAware|url=http://flightaware.com/live/findflight?origin=KBWI&amp;destination=KMDW|publisher=FlightAware|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Southwest also petitioned the FAA&lt;ref&gt;[http://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/NNumSQL.asp?NNumbertxt=286WN July 2006 petition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071204005759/http://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/NNumSQL.asp?NNumbertxt=286WN |date=December 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in July 2006 to have the tail number of the aircraft changed to N286WN.&lt;ref name="N286WN"&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = December 7, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After a lengthy repair, the aircraft emerged from Southwest's Midway hangar as N286WN in September 2006.

As a direct result of the accident, the U.S. [[Federal Aviation Administration]] created a Takeoff and Landing Performance Assessment Aviation Rule-making Committee. (i.e. TALPA ARC). In 2016, based on the recommendations of TALPA ARC, the FAA implemented new "Runway Condition Code" method for the communication of runway conditions from airport management to flight crew members.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.faa.gov/other_visit/aviation_industry/airline_operators/airline_safety/safo/all_safos/media/2016/SAFO16009.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5161">'''The Megalithic Portal''' is a web resource dedicated to prehistoric [[archaeology]] and closely related subjects. The Megalithic Portal's mission is to document, publicise and protect [[ancient site]]s and help to ensure their preservation for future generations.

==History==
Founded by [[chartered engineer]] Andy Burnham, the site database began in 1997 as Megalithic Mysteries, and the Prehistoric Web Index,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.megalithic.co.uk/mm/database/index.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; from a database he originally compiled. The Megalithic Portal has existed in its current form since February 2001. The information is maintained by a team of voluntary editors and administrators and has become the centre of a keen user group. Contributors have been known to give up their jobs to travel, researching little-known ancient sites to add to the database. In 2002, Archaeology Magazine reviewed the Megalithic Portal, describing it as 'useful, fun, and accurate'.&lt;ref&gt;Review by Colleen P. Popson, Archaeology Magazine, March/April 2002&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 2010 the Megalithic Portal has been constituted as a non profit making membership society&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=2146412614 The Megalithic Portal Society]&lt;/ref&gt;

The information contributed by thousands of visitors from all over the world covers types of prehistoric monument from chambered tombs and standing stones to [[Hill fort|hillfort]]s and settlements, and much in between. There are many tens of thousands of listings, and over the years the site has extended beyond prehistoric [[megaliths]], extending to, for example [[Pictish symbol stone]]s in Scotland. While the site still calls itself the Megalithic Portal, it has also become the biggest online repository of data on related areas of interest such as holy wells and ancient crosses in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070406051449/http://www.britarch.ac.uk/ba/ba85/ontheweb.shtml 'On the Web' (Archived Link), British Archaeology Magazine, Nov/Dec 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; Its listings are often referenced by noted web sites&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Lewis, [https://web.archive.org/web/20091013234519/http://www.culture24.org.uk/history+%26+heritage/archaeology/megaliths+and+prehistoric+archaeology/tra51147 A trail around standing stones and burial chambers in the UK], ''Culture24'', 21 December 2008, retrieved 24 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and in recent books on megaliths&lt;ref&gt;Magic Stones: The Secret World of Ancient Megaliths, Jan Pohribny, Merrell, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and Holy Wells.&lt;ref&gt;Cures and Curses: Ritual and Cult at Holy Wells, Janet Bord, Heart of Albion Press 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent project (April 2010) has involved contributors finding over 1000 ancient sites pictured on [[Google Street View]] in the UK and elsewhere &lt;ref&gt;[http://googlemapsmania.blogspot.com/2010/04/megalithic-structures-in-street-view.html Google Maps Mania]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
Site features include:
*Comprehensive listing of prehistoric and related sites in the UK, Europe and worldwide searchable by name, type, location, [[grid reference]], quality of remains and ease of access. Entries contain descriptions, on-page maps, comments and photographs from visitors, with links to local weather, accommodation, aerial views and further websites (over 20,000). Over 60 site types include stone and timber circles, rows, barrows and tombs of all sorts, surviving and destroyed
*The interactive Megalith Map covers the whole of Europe. Tens of thousands of sites are plotted, arranged as layers that can be turned on and off, zoomed and browsed according to site type and area. The map leads to live database entries containing, where possible, details of what remains today, what has been found in the past, and information on access, photographs, visitors' comments and a list of other nearby sites.
*The egallery contains over 50,000 photographs of ancient sites from around the UK and worldwide. Photographs are divided by location, with specialist galleries such as the Spirit of Place (best pictures of ancient sites) the Art Gallery (visitors’ drawings and paintings) and the History Gallery (places of interest outside the definition of prehistory).
*News stories from the world of prehistory, updated daily, with original articles and book reviews. The Megalithic Portal's news feeds are often referenced from other archaeological web sites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bajr.org/bajrnews/default.htm BAJR News Feeds]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wessexarch.co.uk/news-service Wessex Archaeology News Feeds]&lt;/ref&gt;
*A Forum for the exchange of ideas and thoughts on stones, prehistory, sacred sites and mysteries
*A facility allowing visitors to submit their own articles and photographs.
*Downloads of data suitable for use with [[Google Earth]], [[GeoRSS]] feeds, [[Global positioning system|GPS]] and third-party mapping tools, links to download e-books, articles, audio and other resources.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1415">In [[chemistry]], a '''thioxanthate''' is an [[organosulfur compound]] with the formula RSCS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;X.  When X is an alkali metal, the thioxanthate is a salt.  When X is a transition metal, the thioxanthate is a [[ligand]], and when X is an organic group, the compounds are called thioxanthate esters. They are usually yellow colored compounds that often dissolve in organic solvents.  They are used as precursors to some catalysts, [[froth flotation]] agents,  and additives for lubricants.

==Preparation and reactions==
The alkali metal thioxanthates are produced by treating a thiol with a base in the presence of [[carbon disulfide]], as illustrated by the preparation of sodium ethyl thioxanthate:.&lt;ref&gt;Haiduc, I. "1,1-Dithiolato Ligands" in Comprehensive Coordination Chemistry II  Edited by McCleverty, J. A.; Meyer, T. J 2004, volume 1, pp. 349-376.&lt;/ref&gt;
:EtSH  +  NaOH  +  CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;   →   EtSCS{{su|b=2|p=−}}Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
Sodium ethyl thioxanthate is similar structurally to [[sodium ethyl xanthate]].

[[Alkylation]] of such thioxanthate anions gives thioxanthate esters, as illustrated by the preparation of ethyl methyl thioxanthate:
:EtSCS{{su|b=2|p=−}}Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  +  MeI  →   EtSCS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Me  +  NaI
Thioxanthate esters are also called esters of [[trithiocarbonate]].

'''Thomas Henry Moray''' (August 28, 1892 - May 18, 1974) was an inventor from [[Salt Lake City]], Utah. He received a [http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?CC=US&amp;NR=2460707A&amp;KC=A&amp;FT=D&amp;ND=3&amp;date=19490201&amp;DB=EPODOC&amp;locale=en_EP US patent 2,460,707] in February 1949, after a process of 17 years in discussions with the patent office. The
title of the patent is "Electrotherapeutic Device", and although radiotherapy is mentioned, not details are given.

Moray's invention was not commercially successful because of the high manufacturing cost compared to the amount of power produced and the small market for [[Atomic battery|atomic powered batteries]]. Many unsubstantiated claims have been made in connection with attempts to sell books or ask for money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Moray Web|url=http://www.thmoray.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; One claim was five kilowatts of electricity produced from a device costing sixty thousand dollars to build in 1926. If true, it represents a high cost for [[electricity pricing|electricity]] compared to other sources, except in special situations like space research &lt;ref&gt;D. J. Anderson, "NASA Radioisotope Power Conversion Technology NRA Overview," National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA/TM-2005-213981, November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

A counter culture has developed with claims about alternative energy, citing Moray as a leading example of lost opportunity and of [[Free energy suppression conspiracy theory|free energy suppression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=cheniere.org|url=http://www.cheniere.org/books/excalibur/moray.htm}}  Note that this source appears untrustworthy, which is precisely the point!  [[Free energy suppression conspiracy theory|Free energy suppression]] is a conspiracy theory.&lt;/ref&gt; Since Moray patented his invention with detailed drawings and further described his ideas in [http://www.thmoray.org/ books he wrote], the economics and technical operation can be understood with conventional science and engineering. A substantial reduction of manufacturing cost would be required to make wider use of power supplies based on Moray's invention. [[Vacuum tube]] circuits have been replaced by [[Solid-state electronics|solid state electronics]] in most applications.

The '''Tribelhorn''' was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[electric car]] manufactured from 1899 until 1919 in Zurich.  Production began in earnest in 1902; three- and four-wheelers were offered.  The company also produced [[trolleytruck]]s that were used in [[Gümmenen]] and [[Mühleberg]] Switzerland between 1918 and 1922 during the construction of a dam.  It  produced only light utility [[van]]s after 1919 when it was taken over by EFAG (Electrische Fahrzeuge AG).
[[File:Tribelhorn 1912 4.jpg|thumb|Tribelhorn 1912]]

==History==
The Company ''A. Tribelhorn &amp; Cie. AG'' began in 1902 in [[Feldbach, Switzerland|Feldbach]] with the production of automobiles and trucks. In 1918 the name was changed to'' Electrische Fahrzeuge AG'' and moved to [[Altstetten (Zürich)|Altstetten]]. In 1920 the production was stopped.

==Vehicles==
There were vehicles manufactured exclusively with [[electric motor]]. The focus was on the production of commercial vehicles, while passenger cars were only produced in small quantities. 1902 created the first prototype.

Two vehicles of this brand are in the [[Verkehrshaus|Verkehrshaus der Schweiz]] to be seen in [[Luzern]].

It is also the name of a conference room at [[Tesla Motors]], Inc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40886">The existence of a '''wood economy''', or more broadly, a '''forest economy''' (since in many countries a [[bamboo economy]] predominates), is a prominent matter in many [[developing countries]] as well as in many other nations with temperate climate and especially in those with [[Boreal climate|low temperatures]]. These are generally the countries with greater [[forest]]ed areas. The uses of wood in furniture, buildings, bridges, and as a source of energy are widely known. Additionally, wood from [[tree]]s and [[Shrub|bushes]], can be employed in a wide variety, including those produced from [[wood pulp]], as [[cellulose]] in paper, [[celluloid]] in early [[photographic]] film, [[cellophane]], and [[rayon]] (a substitute for silk).

At the end of their normal usage, wood products can be burnt to obtain [[thermal energy]], or can be used as a [[fertilizer]]. The potential environmental damage that a wood economy could occasion include (problems of reduction the [[biodiversity]] due to [[monoculture]] forestry—the intensive cultivation of very few types of trees); and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. However, forests can aid in reduction of atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] and therefore decrease [[global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forestadaptation2008.net/home/en/|title=Adaptation of Forests and Forest Management to Changing Climate with Emphasis on Forest Health: a Review of Science, Policies, and Practices.

== Introduction ==

=== History of use of wood ===
The wood economy is historically the starting point of the [[civilization]]s worldwide, since eras preceding the [[Paleolithic]] and the [[Neolithic]]. It necessarily preceded [[Bronze Age|ages of metals]] by many millenia, as the melting of metals was possible only through the discovery of techniques to light [[fire]] (usually obtained by the scraping of two very dry wooden rods) and the building of many [[simple machine]]s and rudimentary tools, as canes, club handles, [[Bow (weapon)|bows]], [[arrow]]s, [[lance]]s. One of the most ancient handmade articles ever found is one smoothed pricked of wood (Clacton Spear) 250,000 years old (third interglacial period), that was buried under sediments in England, at [[Clacton-on-Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;Tecnologia Dalle Origini al 2000, pag. 18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Clacton Spear |publisher=[[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] |url=http://piclib.nhm.ac.uk/results.asp?image=001066 |accessdate=2012-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028210420/http://piclib.nhm.ac.uk/results.asp?image=001066 |archivedate=October 28, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Successive civilizations such as the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] and [[Sumer|Sumerians]] built sophisticated [[Furniture|objects of furniture]]. Many types of furniture in [[ivory]] and valuable woods have survived to our time practically intact, because secluded in inviolated secret tombs, they were protected from decay also by the dry environment of desert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geocities.com/gpkillen/history.htm |title=History of Egyptian Furniture |date=27 October 2009 |publisher= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027112058/http://geocities.com/gpkillen/history.htm |archivedate=27 October 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many buildings and parts of these (above all roofs) contained elements in wood (often of [[oak]]) forming structural supports and covering; means of transport such as boats, ships; and later (with the invention of the [[wheel]]) wagons and carriages, winches, flour mills powered by water, etc.

=== Dimensions and geography ===
The main source of the lumber used in the world is [[forest]]s, which can be classified as [[Virgin forest|virgin]], [[Semivirgin forests|semivirgin]] and [[Plantation#Forestry|plantations]]. Much [[timber]] is removed for [[firewood]] by local populations in many countries, especially in the [[third world]], but this amount can only be estimated, with wide margins of uncertainty.

In 1998, the worldwide production of "roundwood" (officially counted wood not used as firewood), was about {{convert|1,500,000,000|m3|cuyd}}, amounting to around 45% of the wood cultivated in the world. Cut logs and branches destined to become elements for building construction accounted for approximately 55% of the world's [[wood industry|industrial]] [[wood production]]. 25% became [[wood pulp]] (including wood powder and truccioli) mainly destined for the production of [[paper]] and [[paperboard]], and approximately 20% became panels in [[plywood]] and valuable wood for furnitures and objects of common use (FAO 1998).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unece.org/trade/timber/mis/energy/output.htm#2007 FAO 1998] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724193223/http://www.unece.org/trade/timber/mis/energy/output.htm#2007 |date=July 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The World's largest producer and consumer of officially accounted wood is the United States, although the country that possesses the greatest area of forest is Russia.

In the 1970s, the countries with the largest forest area were: [[Soviet Union]] (approximately 8,800,000&amp;nbsp;km²), [[Brazil]] (5,150,000&amp;nbsp;km²), Canada (4,400,000&amp;nbsp;km²), United States (3,000,000&amp;nbsp;km²), [[Indonesia]] (1,200,000&amp;nbsp;km²) and [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] (1,000,000&amp;nbsp;km²). Other countries with important production and consumption of wood usually have a low [[density of population]] in relation to their territorial extension, here we can include countries as [[Argentina]], [[Chile]], [[Finland]], [[Poland]], Sweden, [[Ukraine]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

By 2001 the [[rainforest]] areas of Brazil were [[Deforestation in Brazil|reduced by a fifth]] (respect of 1970), to around 4,000,000&amp;nbsp;km²; the ground cleared was mainly destined for cattle [[pasture]]—Brazil is the world's largest exporter of [[beef]] with almost 200,000,000 head of cattle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.mongabay.com/2008/0625-amazon_beef.html|title=Brazil seizes cattle illegally grazing on Amazon forest lands|publisher=|accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The booming Brazilian [[ethanol economy]] based upon [[sugar cane]] cultivation, is likewise reducing forests area. Canadian forest was reduced by almost 30% to 3,101,340&amp;nbsp;km² over the same period.&lt;ref name="Canadian Forests - Quick Facts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadian-forests.com/canadian_forests_quick_facts.htm|title=Canadian Forests - Quick Facts|publisher=|accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Importance in fighting greenhouse effect ===
Regarding the problem of climate change, it is known that burning forests increase CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in atmosphere, while intact virgin forest or plantations act as sinks for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, for these reasons wood economy fights [[greenhouse effect]]. The amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; absorbed depends on the type of trees, lands and the climate of the place where trees naturally grow or are planted. Moreover, by night plants do not [[photosynthesis|photosynthesize]], and produce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, eliminated the successive day. Paradoxically in summer [[oxygen]] created by photosynthesis in forests near to cities and urban parks, interacts with urban [[air pollution]] (from cars, etc.) and is transformed by solar beams in [[ozone]] (molecule of three oxygen atoms), that while in high atmosphere constitutes a filter against [[ultraviolet]] beams, in the low atmosphere is a pollutant, able to provoke respiratory disturbances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eea.europa.eu/maps/ozone/welcome|title=Air quality levels in Europe — European Environment Agency|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourlunghealth.org/healthy_living/pollution/outdoor/effects|title=YourLungHealth.org - The Effects of Ozone Pollution|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[low-carbon economy]], forestry operations will be focused on low-impact practices and regrowth.  Forest managers will make sure that they do not disturb soil based carbon reserves too much. Specialized tree farms will be the main source of material for many products.  Quick maturing tree varieties will be grown on short rotations in order to maximize output.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.woodland-trust.org.uk/campaigns/briefingsmore/carbonmgt.htm Trees and their role in carbon management for land and business] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927190041/http://www.woodland-trust.org.uk/campaigns/briefingsmore/carbonmgt.htm |date=2007-09-27 }}, The Woodland Trust.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Per nation/continental area ==

=== In Australia ===
* [[Eucalyptus]]: these are seven hundred tree species from Australia, that grow very fast in tropical, sub-tropical and semi-arid climates, and are very resistant to forest fires (with their tree cortex) and drought. Its [[essential oil]] is used in pharmacology, its wood for building, and the small branches as firewood and pulpwood.

=== In Brazil ===
[[Brazil]] has a long tradition in the harvesting of several types of trees with specific uses. Since the 1960s, imported species of pine tree and eucalyptus have been grown mostly for the [[plywood]] and [[pulp and paper industry|paper pulp industries]]. Currently high-level research is being conducted, to apply the enzymes of [[sugar cane]] fermentation to cellulose in wood, in order to obtain [[methanol]], but the cost is much higher when compared with ethanol derived from [[maize|corn]] costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brazzilmag.com/content/view/8280/54|title=Brazzil Mag - Trying to understand Brazil since 1989|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Brazilwood]]: has a dense, orange-red heartwood that takes a high red shine (brasa=ember), and it is the premier wood used for making bows for string instruments from the [[violin]] family. These trees soon became the biggest source of [[red]] [[dye]], and they were such a large part of the economy and export of that country, that slowly it was known as Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forestryencyclopedia.jot.com/WikiHome/Harvesting%20Wood%20in%20Brazil|title=Harvesting wood in Brazil|publisher=|accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hevea brasiliensis]]: is the biggest source of the best [[latex]], that is used to manufacture many objects in [[rubber]],  as an example [[gloves]], [[condom]]s, anti-allergic [[mattress]]es and [[tires]] (vulcanized rubber). Latex has the ability to adjust to the exact shape of the body part, an advantage over [[polyurethane]] or [[polyethylene]] gloves.

=== In Canada and the US ===
There is a close relation in the forestry economy between these countries; they have many tree genera in common, and Canada is the main producer of wood and wooden items destined to the US, the biggest consumer of wood and its byproducts in the world. The water systems of the [[Great Lakes]], [[Erie Canal]], [[Hudson River]] and [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]] to the east coast and the [[Mississippi River]] to the central plains and [[Louisiana]] allows transportation of logs at very low costs. On the [[West Coast of the United States|west coast]], the basin of the [[Columbia River]] has plenty of forests with excellent timber.

==== Canada ====
The agency Canada Wood  Council calculates that in the year 2005 in Canada, the forest sector employed 930,000 workers (1 job in every 17), making around $108 billion of value in goods and services. For many years products derived from trees in Canadian forests had been the most important export items of the country. In 2011, exports around the world totaled some $64.3 billion – the single largest contributor to Canadian trade balance.&lt;ref name="Canadian Forests - Quick Facts" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wood-works.org|title=Wood-Works - Program of the Canadian Wood Council|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada is the world leader in [[sustainable forest management]] practices. Only {{convert|120000000|ha|km2 sqmi|-1}} (28% of Canadian forests) are currently managed for timber production while an estimated {{convert|32000000|ha|km2 sqmi|-1}} are protected from harvesting by the current legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadian-forests.com|title=Canadian Forests Website - Home Page|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== US ====

* [[Cherry]]: a [[hardwood]] prized for its high quality in grain, width, color, and rich warm glow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greendesigns.com/index.html?about/cherry_wood|title=Classic American Furniture for the Home and Office from Green Design Furniture|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first trees were carried to the lands surrounding [[Rome]] ([[Latium]]) from [[Armenia]].&lt;ref&gt;A History of the Vegetable Kingdom -  Page 334&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, most cherry trees are grown in [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[West Virginia]], [[California]] and [[Oregon]].&lt;ref name=NASS&gt;[http://www.usda.gov/nass/PUBS/TODAYRPT/cher0608.txt Cherry Production] National Agricultural Statistics Service, USDA, Retrieved on August 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Cedrus|Cedar]]: this genus is a group of [[conifer]]s of the [[Pinaceae]] family, originating from high mountain areas from the [[Carpathians]], [[Lebanon]] and [[Turkey]] to the [[Himalayas]]. Their scented wood make them suitable for chests and closet lining. Cedar oil and wood is known to be a natural repellent to moths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~nodice/new/magazine/cedar/cedar.htm|title=Cedarwood Oils|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actually are planted in western and southern US, mostly for ornamental purposes, but also for the production of [[pencil]]s (specially [[incense-cedar]]).
* [[Douglas fir]]: a native tree of the United States [[West Coast of the United States|west coast]] and [[Mountain States|mountain states]], with records in fast growth and high statures in brief time. The [[Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii|coast Douglas fir]] grows in coastal regions up to altitudes of about 1,800 meters; the [[Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca|Rocky Mountain Douglas fir]] grows farther inland, at altitudes ranging from 800 m to 3,000 m or higher. The wood is used for construction, for [[homebuilt aircraft]], for paper pulp, and also as [[firewood]].
* [[Hybrid poplar]] is being investigated by [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] in [[Tennessee]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bioenergy.ornl.gov/papers/misc/trees.html|title=Biofuels from Trees: Renewable Energy Research Branches Out|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.osti.gov/scitech/biblio/5051|title=A National Assessment of Promising Areas for Switchgrass, Hybrid Poplar, or Willow Energy Crop Production|first1=R.

* [[Walnut]]: a prized furniture and carving hardwood because of its colour, hardness, grain and durability. Walnut wood has been the timber of choice for gun makers for centuries. It remains one of the most popular choices for rifle and shotgun stocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walnutcouncil.org|title=Walnut Council--Growing Walnut and Other Fine Hardwoods|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In the Caribbean and Central America ===
* [[Mahogany]]: has a straight grain, usually free of voids and pockets. The most prized species come from [[Cuba]] and [[Honduras]]. It has a reddish-brown color, which darkens over time, and displays a beautiful reddish sheen when polished. It has excellent workability, is available in big boards, and is very durable. Mahogany is used in the making of many musical instruments, as [[drum]]s, acoustic and electric [[guitar]]s' back and side, and luxury [[headphone]]s.

=== In Europe ===

==== Italy ====
The species that are ideal for the many uses in this type of economy are those employed by [[arboriculture]], that are very well known for their features and the need for certain types of ground and climates.
* [[Fraxinus]]: being a lightweight wood is easy to transport, as firewood burns easily, grows in damp environments like those present in river flooding areas, stands pollution of water and air.
* [[Larix]]: in Italy it grows at high altitudes around mountain tops, its timber stand sudden climatic change, from icy winds to high temperatures in sunny afternoon summers, it is excellent for use in the building of exposed structures as bridges, roofs, etc.
* [[Stone pine]]: "Mediterranean pine" could be the noble emblem of many coastal areas in Italy, originally giant forests of pines extended from the mouth of the [[Tiber]] river until [[Liguria]] and [[Provence]] in France, over soils with high [[salinity]], not very apt for agriculture. Its trees produce a vast amount of dry branches that can be burnt, [[Pine cone|cones]] (used for Christmas decoration) and needle-like foliage that can be burnt, or used as [[mulch]]. Oils and resins can be used in [[scent]]s and [[ointments]]. The [[pinoli]] are useful elements in Italian cooking (along with [[basil]] are tritured to make [[pesto]] sauce). Currently, "progress" has brought to a severe reduction of this magnificent tree extensions, and in many places cheap beach buildings, car-parking and semi-abandoned areas have taken their place.
* [[Populus|Poplar]]: in Italy is the most important species for tree plantations, is used for several purposes as [[plywood]] manufacture, packing boxes, paper, [[match]]es, etc. It needs good quality grounds with good drainage, but can be used to protect the cultivations if disposed in [[windbreak]] lines. More than 70% of Italian poplar cultivations are located in the [[pianura Padana]]. Constantly the extension of the cultivation is being reduced, from 650&amp;nbsp;km² in the 1980s to current 350&amp;nbsp;km². The yield of poplars is about 1,500 t/km² of wood every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federlegno.it/tool/home.php?s=0,1,29,37,417,1042,1043|title=Federlegno - Italian federation of wood producers and industry|publisher=|accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production from poplars is around 45–50% of the total Italian wood production.&lt;ref&gt;Fonte:http://www.federlegno.it/tool/home.php?s=0,1,29,37,417,1042&lt;/ref&gt;
** In the [[history of art]] poplar was the wood of choice for painting surfaces as panels, as in [[Renaissance]] (The [[Mona Lisa]] by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]). Because of this reason, many of the products with the highest [[added value]], extremely expensive, are made with wood from the humble but durable poplar.
** Because of the presence of [[tannic acid]], poplar cortex was often used in Europe for the [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]] of [[leather]].

==== Portugal ====
* [[Cork oak|Oak]] for [[Cork (material)|cork]]: are trees with a slow growth, but long life, are cultivated in warm hill areas (min. temp. &gt; -5°Celsius) in all the west area of [[Mediterranean]] shores. Cork is popular as a material for [[bulletin board]]s. Even if the production as [[Stopper (plug)|stopper]]s for wine bottles is diminishing in favor of [[nylon]] stoppers, in the sake of energy saving granules of cork can be mixed into [[concrete]]. These composites have low thermal conductivity, low density and good energy absorption (earthquake resistant). Some of the property ranges of the composites are density (400–1500&amp;nbsp;kg/m³), compressive strength (1–26 MPa) and flexural strength (0.5–4.0&amp;nbsp;MPa).&lt;ref&gt;Karade SR. 2003. An Investigation of Cork Cement Composites. PhD Thesis. BCUC. Brunel University, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this cork can be used as [[Thermal conductivity|thermal isolation]] in buildings (as well in its natural form and as a mixture), useful also as [[sound insulation]]. In the [[shoe]] industry cork is used for [[Shoe#Sole|sole]]s and [[insole]]s. In the world there are 20,000&amp;nbsp;km² of cork oak plantations, and every year are extracted around 300,000 tons of cork, 50% in [[Portugal]], 15,000 in Italy (12,000 in the island of [[Sardinia]]). The advantage of this natural industry is that the extraction of cork from layers outer to the [[cortex (botany)|cortex]] does not kill the tree.

=== In Scandinavia and Russia ===
In Sweden, Finland and to an extent Norway, much of the land area is forested, the pulp and paper industry is one of the most significant industrial sectors. Chemical pulping produces an excess of energy, since the organic matter in [[black liquor]], mostly [[lignin]] and [[hemicellulose]] breakdown products, is burned in the [[recovery boiler]]. Thus, these countries have high proportions of renewable energy use (25% in Finland, for instance). Considerable effort is directed towards increasing the value and usage of forest products by companies and by government projects.

* [[Scots pine]] and [[Norway spruce]]: These species comprise most of boreal forest, and together as a softwood mixture they are converted chemical pulp for paper.
* [[Birch]]: is a genus with many species of trees from [[Scandinavia]] and Russia, excellent for acid grounds. They act as [[pioneer species]] in the frozen border between [[taiga]] and [[tundra]], are very resistant to periods of [[drought]] and [[icy condition]]s. The species [[Betula nana]] has been identified as the ideal tree for the acid grounds of the sides of sloped mountains, also in southern Europe, with soils poor in nutrients, where these trees can be used to restrain [[landslide]]s. [[Dissolving pulp]] is produced from birch. [[Xylitol]] can be produced by hydrogenation of [[xylose]], which is a byproduct of chemical pulping of birch.

&lt;!--
Nessuna di queste specie sottrae terreni pregiati o particolarmente fertili all'agricoltura, ma, al contrario, contribuiscono a proteggere i suoli coltivati dall'erosione e dai venti. Nonostante questa caratteristica positiva in Italia, da secoli si assiste alla progressiva riduzione della presenza degli alberi nei terreni circostanti le colture con la conseguenza che l'eccesso di acqua meteorica non viene adeguatemente trattenuto e si possano verificare, quando succedono piogge abbondanti, catastrofiche [[alluvioni]].

== Uses of wood ==
{{Further information|Wood#Uses}}

== Combustion ==
{{main article|Wood fuel}}
The [[combustion|burning]] of wood is currently the largest use of [[energy]] derived from a [[solid fuel]] [[biomass]]. Wood fuel may be available as [[firewood]] (e.g. logs, bolts, blocks), [[charcoal]], chips, sheets, [[wood pellets|pellets]] and [[sawdust]]. Wood fuel can be used for [[cooking]] and [[heating]] through [[stove]]s and [[fireplace]]s, and occasionally for fueling [[steam engine]]s and steam [[turbines]] that [[electricity generation|generate electricity]]. For many centuries many types of traditional [[oven]]s were used in order to benefit from the heat generated by wood combustion. Now, more efficient and clean solutions have been developed: advanced [[fireplace]]s (with [[heat exchanger]]s), [[wood-fired oven]]s,  [[wood-burning stove]]s and [[pellet stove]]s, that are able to filter and separate pollutants (centrifuging [[wood ash|ash]]es with rotative filters), thus eliminating many emissions, also allowing to recover a higher quantity of heat that escaped with the [[chimney]] fumes.

Mean [[energy density]] of [[Wood]], was calculated at around 6–17 [[Megajoule]]/[[Kilogram]], depending on species and moisture content.

Combustion of wood is, however, linked to the production of micro-environmental pollutants, as [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[carbon monoxide]] (CO) (an invisible gas able to provoke irreversible saturation of [[blood]]'s [[hemoglobine]]), as well as [[nanoparticles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Olivares G, Ström J, Johansson C, Gidhagen L |title=Estimates of black carbon and size-resolved particle number emission factors from residential wood burning based on ambient monitoring and model simulations |journal=J Air Waste Manag Assoc |volume=58 |issue=6 |pages=838–48 |date=June 2008 |pmid=18581814 |doi=10.3155/1047-3289.58.6.838 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Italy [[Populus|poplar]] has been proposed as a tree cultivated to be transformed into [[biofuel]]s, because of the excellent ratio of energy extracted from its wood because of poplar's fast growing and capture of atmospheric carbon dioxide to the small amount of energy needed to cultivate, cut and transport the trees. ''Populus x canadensis'' 'I-214', grows so fast that is able to reach {{convert|14|in|cm}} in diameter and heights of {{convert|100|ft|m}} in ten years.

=== Charcoal ===
{{main article|Charcoal}}
Charcoal is the dark grey residue consisting of impure [[carbon]] obtained by removing water and other volatile constituents from [[animal]] and [[vegetation]] substances.  Charcoal is usually produced by slow [[pyrolysis]], the heating of [[wood]] or other substances in the absence of [[oxygen]]. Charcoal can then be used as a fuel with a higher combustion temperature.

=== Wood gasogen ===
[[Wood gas generator]] (gasogen): is a bulky and heavy device (but technically simple) that transforms burning wood in a mix of molecular [[hydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[carbon monoxide]] (CO), [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), molecular [[nitrogen]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and water vapor (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O). This gas mixture, known as "[[wood gas]]", "poor gas" or "[[syngas]]" is obtained after the [[combustion]] of dry wood in a [[redox|reductive environment]] (low in [[oxygen]]) with a limited amount of atmospheric air, at temperatures of 900° Celsius, and can fuel an [[internal combustion engine]].&lt;ref&gt;UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE [https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/dspace/bitstream/1957/1569/1/FPL_1463ocr.pdf Gasogens Report] (Original report dated 1944): now in the possession of the University of Wisconsin&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Gasogenog.jpg|thumb|300px|A car built in the 1940s by [[Ilario Bandini]], with a wood gas generator device.]]

In the time between World War I and [[World War II]] included, because of the lack of [[oil]], in many countries, like Italy, France, [[Great Britain]] and Sweden, several [[gasoline]]-powered cars were modified, with the addition of a [[wood gas generator]] (a "''gasogen''"), a device powered by wood, coal, or burnable waste, able to produce (and purify) gas that immediately, in the same vehicle, could power a slightly modified [[Internal combustion engine|ICE]] [[engine]] of a standard car (low-compression engine). [[Carburetor]] had to be changed with an air-gas [[Mixer (engine)|mixer]]). There were several setbacks, as the great reduction of maximum speed and the need to drive using low [[gear]]s and wisely dosing the amount of air. In modern cars, modified with a wood gas generator, gas emissions (CO, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NOx) are lower to those of the same vehicle running with gasoline (keeping the same [[catalytic converter]]).

===Methanol===
{{Main article|Methanol economy}}
[[Methanol]] (the simplest [[alcohol]]) behaves as a liquid at 25&amp;nbsp;°C, is toxic and  corrosive, and in [[organic chemistry]] basic books is often called "the spirit of wood", since it can be obtained from wood [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]]. Rarely, when unwise [[wine]]-makers mix small chunks of wood and leaves with grapes, methanol can be found as a pollutant of the blend of water, [[ethanol]] and other substances derived from [[grape]]'s fermentation.

The best way to obtain methanol from wood is through [[syngas]] (CO, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) produced by the [[anhydrous]] [[pyrolysis]] of wood, a method discovered by [[ancient Egypt]]ians.

Methanol can be used as an oxygen-rich additive for [[gasoline]]. However, it is usually much cheaper to produce methanol from [[methane]] or from syngas.  Methanol is the most important base material for industrial chemistry, where it is often used to make more complex molecules through reactions of [[halogenation]] and chemical [[addition reaction]].

===Gas turbine===

====Tanks====
The American [[M1 Abrams]] [[main battle tank]] is powered by a [[gas turbine]] of {{convert|1500|hp|abbr=on}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www51.honeywell.com/aero/common/documents/myaerospacecatalog-documents/SurfaceSystems/AGT1500_Turbine_Technology.pdf |title=AGT1500 Turbine Technology on Honeywell.com |publisher= |accessdate=13 May 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160909103204/http://www51.honeywell.com/aero/common/documents/myaerospacecatalog-documents/SurfaceSystems/AGT1500_Turbine_Technology.pdf |archivedate=9 September 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that it is able to function also with a mix at 50% of wood powder and [[biodiesel]], [[diesel fuel]] or [[kerosene]]. Its advantages over [[Turbocharger|turbo]]-[[diesel engine]], are the small size and light weight, the lack of a [[radiator]] (which gives an advantage against the effect of gun and cannon shots and missile strikes suffered in battle). A setback is the high fuel consumption, since the turbine engine has not the ability to work at a low revolutions per minute rate, much lower than ideal, and during the march this engine consumes twice as much fuel as a modern turbo-diesel engine with [[intercooler]] and [[Fuel injection|direct injection]].

==Construction==
{{main article|Lumber}}
Wood is relatively light in weight, because its [[specific weight]] is less than 500&amp;nbsp;kg/m³, this is an advantage,  when compared against 2,000-2,500&amp;nbsp;kg/m³ for [[armed concrete]] or 7,800&amp;nbsp;kg/m³ for [[steel]].

Wood is strong, because the efficiency of wood for structural purposes has qualities that are similar to steel.

===Bridges, levees, microhydro, piers===
Wood is used to build bridges (as the [[Magere Brug|Magere bridge]] in [[Amsterdam]]), as well as water and air mills, and [[microhydro]] generators for electricity.

===Housing===
[[Hardwood]] is used as a material in [[lumber|wooden]] [[house]]s, and other structures with a broad range of dimensions. In traditional homes wood is preferred for [[ceiling]]s, [[door]]s, [[flooring]]s and [[window]]s. Wooden [[Framing (construction)|frame]]s were traditionally used for home ceilings, but they risk collapse during fires.

The development of [[Efficient energy use|energy efficient]] houses including the "[[passive house]]" has revamped the importance of wood in construction, because wood provides acoustic and thermal [[Building insulation|insulation]], with much better results than concrete.

====Earthquake resistant buildings====
In Japan, ancient buildings, of relatively high elevation, like [[pagoda]]s, historically had shown to be able to resist [[earthquake]]s of high [[Seismic scale|intensity]], thanks to the traditional building techniques, employing elastic [[Kinematic pair|joint]]s, and to the excellent ability of wooden frames to elastically deform and absorb severe [[peak ground acceleration|acceleration]]s and [[compression (physical)|compressive]] shocks.

In 2006, Italian scientists from [[Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche|CNR]] patented&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.girodivite.it/Terremoti-dal-Cnr-arriva-il.html|title=Girodivite: Terremoti: dal Cnr arriva il palazzo antisismico|first=|last=Girodivite.it|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a building system that they called "[[SOFIE]]",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.progettosofie.it PROGETTOSOFIE: Edificio Antisismico in Legno]&lt;/ref&gt; a seven-[[storey]] wooden building, 24 meters high, built by the "Istituto per la valorizzazione del legno e delle specie arboree" (Ivalsa) of [[San Michele all'Adige]]. In 2007 it was tested with the hardest Japanese [[Earthquake engineering|antiseismic]] test for civil structures: the simulation of [[Great Hanshin earthquake|Kobe's earthquake]] (7.2 [[Richter scale]]), with the building placed over an enormous oscillating platform belonging to the NIED-Institute, located in [[Tsukuba]] science park, near the city of [[Miki, Hyogo|Miki]] in Japan. This Italian project, employed very thin and flexible panels in [[glued laminated timber]], and according to CNR researchers could brought to the construction of much more safe houses in seismic areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/SoleOnLine4/Italia/2009/04/cnr-progetto-casa-legno-anti-sisma.shtml?uuid=222999a2-241a-11de-bdf4-e9c9b14e9445&amp;DocRulesView=Libero|title=Dalla ricerca italiana la casa &amp;nbsp;di legno che resiste al terremoto - Il Sole 24 ORE|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shipbuilding ===
One of the most enduring materials is the lumber from [[virginia]]n [[Quercus virginiana|southern live oak]] and [[white oak]], specially live oak is 60% stronger than white oak and more resistant to moisture. As an example, the main component in the structure of battle ship [[USS Constitution]], the world's oldest commissioned naval vessel afloat (launched in 1797) is white oak.&lt;ref name="Victory"&gt;{{cite web

== History of crisis in wood economies ==

===Classical Greece===
One of the most famous [[crisis]] of a wood-based economy is what happened in [[Classical Greece]], where trees began to disappear specially in the areas of [[Attica]], [[Boeotia]] and [[Peloponnesus]] where indiscriminate cutting of trees for several uses, associated to drought and [[wildfire]]s led to a severe lack of timber in order to build lances, shields, ships, etc. and to a slow but progressive weakening in military and naval power of the peninsular kingdoms in Greece, that were overwhelmed by [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]] and by the [[Kingdom of Macedon]], much more fertile lands because of their rainy winters. This process arrived to the apex with the conquest of Greece by [[Phillip II of Macedon]].

The secret weapon of the [[Sarissaphoros]] soldiers (supported by [[peltast]] javelineers), commanded by Philipp II in the [[Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC)]] and in those that followed fought by [[Alexander the Great]] (which brought to the conquest of [[Lesser Asia]], [[Babylon]], [[Persia]] and [[Egypt]]), was the [[sarissa]], a type of [[Pike (weapon)|pike]], longer and stronger (5–7 m.) than the other Greek [[lance]]s, obtained from the heavy and strong [[European Cornel|cornel wood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ardeavalpometto.org/parco_boschi.html|title=Parco Naturale Valpometto - I boschi di casa nostra|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rapa Nui===
{{Dispute|date=July 2017}}
[[History of Easter Island#Pre-European society|Rapa Nui]], best known as "Easter Island", is a typical example of [[malthusianism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/27864/1/WP117.pdf|title=Why Easter Island Collapsed: An Answer for an Enduring Question|publisher=|accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically how the [[exponential growth]] of a populace leads to the end of a [[renewable resource]]. At a certain point, the compelling societal need forces exploitation of the resource above and beyond the resource's natural rate of renewal.

It has been calculated &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archaeology.about.com/od/eterms/qt/easter_island.htm|title=What Has Science Learned about the People Who Settled Easter Island?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that after the year 1000, around 10 million [[palmtree]]s were cut in Rapa Nui, resulting in the [[erosion]] of the fertile land, and eventually to a [[desertification]] around the 15th century. (This deforestation may have also been aggravated and/or caused by a rat [[infestation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/discoveries/2005-12-05-easter-island_x.htm|title=USATODAY.com - Did Easter Island get 'ratted' out?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). This provoked a population reduction from 15,000 to 2,500 individuals. Without palmtree wood, no boats, or lances could be constructed. Without palm fibers, construction of ropes and fishing nets halted.  This led to a decrease in the local fish harvest, which in turn led to a decrease in the quantity of dietary protein available to the island's inhabitants.  At the end, the society became an easy prey for [[hunger]] and [[civil war]].  From 1600 to 1700, the people became superstitious in a fanatical way. In the last moments, there was a disintegration of [[society]] and total chaos. The destruction of the traditional symbols followed, leading to the eventual extinction of the [[Moai]]s [[civilization]] and [[culture]], even if there was not any external human enemy.

{{Refimprove|date=March 2017}}

'''Ylem''' is a term that was used by [[George Gamow]], his student [[Ralph Alpher]], and their associates in the late 1940s for a hypothetical original substance or condensed state of matter, which became [[subatomic particles]] and [[chemical element|element]]s as we understand them today. The term ''ylem'' was actually resuscitated (it appears in [[Webster's Second]] "the first substance from which the elements were supposed to have been formed") by Ralph Alpher.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cosmos''--''Voyage Through the Universe'' series, New York:1988 Time-Life Books Page 75&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern understanding, the "ylem" described as by Gamow was the primordial [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], formed in [[baryogenesis]], which underwent [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]] and was opaque to radiation. [[Recombination (cosmology)|Recombination]] of the charged plasma into neutral [[atom]]s made the Universe transparent at the age of 380,000 years, and the radiation released is still observable as [[cosmic microwave background radiation]].

==History==
It comes from an obsolete [[Middle English]] philosophical word that Alpher said he found in Webster's dictionary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED |term=ylem |id=/231917 |date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word means something along the lines of "primordial substance from which all matter is formed" (that in ancient [[mythology]] of many different cultures was called the [[cosmic egg]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bernstein |first=Jeremy |title=Out of My Mind: The Birth of Modern Cosmology |journal=The American Scholar |volume=55 |issue=1 |year=1986 |pages=7–18 |jstor=41211280}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and ultimately derives from the Greek ''ὕλη'' (''hūlē, hȳlē''), "matter", probably through an accusative singular form in Latin ''hylen, hylem''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED |term=hyle |id=90173 |date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an oral history interview in 1968 Gamow talked about ylem as an old Hebrew word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Gamow |first=George |url=https://www.aip.org/history-programs/niels-bohr-library/oral-histories/4325 |title=Oral Histories - George Gamow |interviewer=Charles Weiner |publisher=[[American Institute of Physics]] |date=25 April 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ylem is what Gamow and colleagues presumed to exist immediately after the Big Bang. Within the ylem, there were assumed to be a large number of high-energy [[photon]]s present. Alpher and [[Robert Herman]] made a [[scientific prediction]] in 1948 that we should still be able to observe these [[red-shift]]ed photons today as an ambient [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] (CMBR) pervading all space with a temperature of about 5 [[kelvin]]s&lt;ref&gt;''The Cosmos'' – ''Voyage Through the Universe'' series, New York: 1988 Time-Life Books, Page 80.&lt;/ref&gt; (when the CMBR was actually first detected in 1965, its temperature was found to be 3 kelvins). It is now recognized that the CMBR originated at the transition from predominantly ionized hydrogen to non-ionized hydrogen at around 400,000 years after the Big Bang.

==In popular culture ==
After the term ''ylem'' was resuscitated by Alpher, it was used in the 1952 [[science fiction]] novel ''Jack of Eagles'' by [[James Blish]]. It was also used by [[John Brunner (novelist)|John Brunner]] in his 1959 short story "Round Trip", reprinted in the collection ''[[Not Before Time]]''. [[Keith Laumer]] in the novel ''Dinosaur Beach'' introduces the ylem field 1969.  The term is also used by British author [[Richard Calder (writer)|Richard Calder]] in the 1990s to describe the [[quantum mechanical]] state of the "quantum magic" in the girls/robots in his "Dead" trilogy (''[[Dead Girls]]'', ''[[Dead Boys (novel)|Dead Boys]]'', ''Dead Things''). [[John C. Wright (author)|John C. Wright]] used the term in his debut novel ''[[The Golden Age (John C. Wright novel)#Book 1: The Golden Age|The Golden Age]]'' to describe a "pseudo-matter" that forms "temporary virtual particles". A German black metal band "Dark Fortress" also released an album titled "Ylem". A the trance classic by The Thrillseekers - Synaesthesia has a "Ylem" remix. The video game series [[Ultima (series)|Ultima]] uses "Ylem" as a Word of Power in its incantation and runic based spell casting system, its meaning being "matter".

In 1981, Trudy Myrrh Reagan formed an organization, "Ylem: Artists Using Science and Technology" (later written YLEM), in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ylem.org/Membership/history_detailed.html|title=YLEM Detailed history|website=www.ylem.org|access-date=2018-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also a usable word in the Official Scrabble Players Dictionary, Fifth edition.
