      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4539">'''Aerial yoga''' is a type of [[yoga]] combining traditional yoga poses, [[pilates]], and dance with the use of a [[hammock]]. It originated in California.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.columbusunderground.com/lit-life-yoga-in-italian-village-opens-today-na1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vancouversun.com/health/Aerial+yoga+goes+head+over+heels+Vancouver+with+video/9597717/story.html "Aerial yoga goes head-over-heels in Vancouver (with video)"]. Erin Ellis, ''Vancouver Sun'', March 9, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hammock==

Anti-gravity yoga requires a special kind of hammock used a prop which can support up to 300 kilos of weight.
The rig consists of support chains, a webbing strap, a silk hammock and [[carabiner]]s.

Two support chains hang down from the ceiling to less than one meter from the floor, and the hammock is connected at the height preferred by the user.&lt;ref&gt;Macmaillan. A, (2014). “Quick Tips: What is Antigravity Yoga?”, howstuffwork. http://health.howstuffworks.com/wellness/diet-fitness/yoga/quick-tips-what-is-antigravity-yoga-.htm (Accessed:6/08/2014)&lt;/ref&gt; 

The hammock acts like a swing or soft trapeze, supporting the hips for forward bends and back bends. Yoga postures which some find difficult to do on the ground, such as the reverse post, may be easier in mid-air using the hammock, and the hammock moves add variety to a workout.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newindianexpress.com/magazine/New-Yoga-Sutras/2015/02/21/article2676601.ece "New Yoga Sutras"]. ''New Indian Express'', by Ayesha Singh, 21 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health benefits claimed==

There is a lack of well-designed clinical trials to support the effectiveness of yoga in improving general health, and anti-gravity yoga is too new to have been studied in this way.  However, anecdotal evidence indicates that by facilitating bending and stretching of the whole body during exercise, muscles and joints will be strengthened&lt;ref&gt;[http://yourhealth.asiaone.com/content/aerial-yoga-new-way-refresh-busy-people "Aerial yoga new way to refresh busy people"]. ''AsiaOne: Your Health''.&lt;/ref&gt; and rehabilitated, and the spine decompressed&lt;ref&gt;Alicia, M McAuley (2014). The benefits of Anti-gravity Yoga.

As with other forms of active exercise, the circulatory, respiratory and digestive systems are improved through increased blood circulation.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}  Yoga in general, and anti-gravity yoga in particular is promoted as benefiting emotional, psychological and spiritual health.&lt;ref name="W2014"&gt;Anna, W. (2014). 5 Interesting Benefits of Aerial Yoga. http://yourdailyworkout.com/body-workout/5-interesting-benefits-of-aerial-yoga/  (Accessed: 31/7/2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Popular poses ==
There are an ever-increasing number of poses to try out during a session of anti-gravity yoga, with the most popular including:

=== Cross position ===
With the hammock supporting you just above your waist and hands holding the material, straighten your legs and lean back. Slowly let your arms fall wide behind you to complete the cross shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Curtis |first=Carmen |date=23 July 2015 |title=8 Essential Aerial Yoga Poses You Have to Try |url=http://wanderlust.com/journal/8-essential-aerial-yoga-poses-you-have-to-try/ |publisher=Wanderlust |language=en-US |access-date=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Star inversion ===
This is one of the first inversions learned during an anti-gravity yoga class. With the hammock resting on the tailbone of your spine and hands gripping the sides, sit and let your body slowly fall backwards whilst opening your legs to rest against the material. Slide your hands down slowly to the floor and stabilize.&lt;ref name=poses&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Dortignac |first=Michelle |date=17 June 2015 |url=http://www.yogajournal.com/slideshow/the-aerial-yoga-sequence-9-poses-to-defy-gravity/ |title=The Aerial Yoga Sequence: 9 Poses to Defy Gravity |magazine=Yoga Journal |language=en-US |access-date=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== One-legged king pigeon pose ===
From the star inversion, bend your right knee and hook your foot across the front of the hammock.&lt;ref name=poses/&gt;

==== Bound ====
From the one-legged king pigeon pose, reach back with one of your hands and grab your left foot or ankle. Then again with your second. Sink into the position and relax.&lt;ref name=poses/&gt;

'''Alathur Kilar''', originally pronounced ''Ālathur Kiḻhār'' ([[Tamil language|Tamil]]: ஆலத்தூர் கிழார்), was a [[Tamil language|Tamil]] poet of [[Sangam period]]. He has authored seven poetries in the [[Sangam literature]], including five in [[Purananuru]] and two in [[Kurunthogai]].

==Contribution to the Sangam literature==
Alathur Kilar has written seven Sangam verses in all. This includes verses 34, 36, 69, 225, and 324 in Purananuru&lt;ref name="SangaIlakkiyam_3"&gt;{{cite book

{{distinguish|E (programming language)|E (verification language)}}
'''Amiga E''', or very often simply '''E''', is a [[programming language]] created by Wouter van Oortmerssen on the [[Amiga]]. He has since moved on to develop the [[SHEEP programming language]] for the new [[AmigaDE platform]] and the CryScript language (also known as DOG) used during the development of the [[video game]] [[Far Cry]].


== Description ==
Amiga E is a combination of many features from a number of languages, but follows the original [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] most closely in terms of basic concepts. Amiga E's main benefits are fast compilation (allowing it to be used in place of a scripting language), very readable [[source code]], flexible type system, powerful module system, exception handling (not C++ variant) and [[Object-oriented programming|Object oriented programming]].

A [[hello world program|"hello world" program]] in Amiga E looks like:
&lt;code&gt;
   PROC main()
      WriteF('Hello, World!')
   ENDPROC
&lt;/code&gt;
Amiga E was used to create the core of the popular Amiga graphics software [[Photogenics]].

==History==

1993: The first public release of Amiga E.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=McCreary|first=Charles R.|date=October 1993|title=Amiga E: Public Domain Programming Gem|language=|magazine=Amazing Computing For The Commodore Amiga|publisher=PiM Publications|issn=1053-4547|volume=8|number=10|pages=20-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Amsterdam Declaration 2002''' is a statement of the fundamental principles of modern [[Humanism]] passed unanimously by the General Assembly of the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]] (IHEU) at the 50th anniversary World Humanist Congress in 2002. According to the IHEU, the declaration "is the official statement of World Humanism."

It is officially supported by all member organisations of the IHEU including:

*Humanistic Association Netherlands (Humanistisch Verbond)
*[[American Humanist Association]]
*[[British Humanist Association]]
*[[Humanist Canada]]
*[[Human-Etisk Forbund]], the Norwegian Humanist Association
*[[Humanistischer Verband Deutschlands]], the Humanist Association of Germany
*[[Council of Australian Humanist Societies]]
*[[Council for Secular Humanism]]
*[[Gay and Lesbian Humanist Association]]
*[[Humanist Association of Ireland]]
*[[Indian Humanist Union]]
*[[Philippine Atheists and Agnostics Society (PATAS)]]

A complete list of signatories can be found on the [[IHEU]] page (see references).

This declaration makes exclusive use of capitalized ''Humanist'' and ''Humanism'', which is consistent with IHEU's general practice and recommendations for promoting a unified Humanist identity. {{ref|Webbs}} To further promote Humanist identity, these words are also free of any adjectives, as recommended by prominent members of IHEU. {{ref|Blackham}} Such usage is not universal among IHEU member organizations, though most of them do observe these conventions.

==Humanist principles==
''(see References for complete text)''

The official defining statement of World Humanism is:

*Humanism is [[ethical]]. It affirms the worth, dignity and autonomy of the individual and the right of every human being to the greatest possible freedom compatible with the rights of others. Humanists have a duty of care to all humanity including future generations. Humanists believe that morality is an intrinsic part of human nature based on understanding and a concern for others, needing no external sanction. 
*Humanism is [[Rationality|rational]]. It seeks to use science creatively, not destructively. Humanists believe that the solutions to the world’s problems lie in human thought and action rather than divine intervention. Humanism advocates the application of the methods of science and free inquiry to the problems of human welfare. But Humanists also believe that the application of science and technology must be tempered by human values. Science gives us the means but human values must propose the ends.
*Humanism supports [[democracy]] and [[human rights]]. Humanism aims at the fullest possible development of every human being. It holds that democracy and human development are matters of right. The principles of democracy and human rights can be applied to many human relationships and are not restricted to methods of government.
*Humanism insists that [[personal liberty]] must be combined with [[social responsibility]]. Humanism ventures to build a world on the idea of the free person responsible to society, and recognizes our dependence and responsibility for the natural world. Humanism is undogmatic, imposing no creed upon its adherents. It is thus committed to education free from indoctrination. 
*Humanism is a response to the widespread demand for an alternative to [[dogma]]tic [[religion]]. The world’s major religions claim to be based on revelations fixed for all time, and many seek to impose their world-view on all of humanity. Humanism recognizes that reliable knowledge of the world and ourselves arises through a continuing process of observation, evaluation and revision.
*Humanism values artistic [[creativity]] and [[imagination]] and recognises the transforming power of [[art]]. Humanism affirms the importance of literature, music, and the visual and performing arts for personal development and fulfilment.
*Humanism is a [[lifestance]] aiming at the maximum possible fulfilment through the cultivation of ethical and creative living and offers an ethical and rational means of addressing the challenges of our time. Humanism can be a way of life for everyone everywhere.

The Amsterdam Declaration explicitly states that Humanism rejects [[dogma]], and imposes no creed upon its adherents.

==History==

At the first [[World Humanist Congress]] in the Netherlands in 1952, the IHEU general assembly agreed a statement of the fundamental principles of modern Humanism - '''The Amsterdam Declaration'''. 

At the 50th anniversary World Humanist Congress in 2002, the IHEU general assembly unanimously passed a [[Resolution (law)|resolution]] updating that declaration - "The Amsterdam Declaration 2002".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4461">'''Archibald Campbell''' (1691 in [[Edinburgh]] – 1756 in [[St Andrews]]) was a [[Church of Scotland]] minister and moral philosopher.{{sfn|Haakonssen|2006|page={{page needed|date=October 2014}} }}

==Biography==
Archibald Campbell's father was a merchant, and of the Succoth family. Archibald was educated at [[Edinburgh University|Edinburgh]] and [[Glasgow University|Glasgow]]. He was licensed to preach in 1717, and in 1718 ordained minister of the united parishes of Larbert and Dunipace, Stirlingshire.{{sfn|Stephen|1886|p=340}}

In 1726 Campbell published an anonymous treatise on the duty of praying for the civil magistrate. The same year he travelled to London with a manuscript treatise on "Moral Virtue",{{sfn|Stephen|1886|p=340}} that based morals on [[self-love]] but which was critical of both [[Bernard Mandeville|Mandeville]] and [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]].{{sfn|Haakonssen|2006|page={{page needed|date=October 2014}} }}

Campbell trusted his book to his friend Alexander Innes, who had been an accomplice of the well-known Psalmanazar. Innes published this as his own in 1728, as ''Ἀρετηλογία''("An Enquiry into the Original of Mldral Virtue"). Innes not only won reputation by the work, but a good living in Essex. In August 1730 Campbell went to London, saw Innes, and says that he "made him tremble in his shoes".{{sfn|Stephen|1886|p=340}} Campbell consented, however, to an advertisement claiming his own book, but only saying that "for some certain reasons" it had a peered under the name of Innes. Even this was delayed for a time that Innes might not lose a post which he was expecting. Stuart, physician to the queen, was a cousin of Innes, and interceded for him. Campbell was appointed professor of church history in St. Andrews in 1730.{{sfn|Stephen|1886|p=340}}

In 1730 Campbell published a ''Discourse proving that the Apostles were no Enthusiasts''. In 1733 he republished his former treatise under his own name as an ''Enquiry into the Original of Moral Virtue''. In the same year he published an ''Oratio de Vanitate Luminis Naturæ'',{{sfn|Stephen|1886|p=340}} theological works against [[Matthew Tindal]].{{sfn|Haakonssen|2006|page={{page needed|date=October 2014}} }}

In 1735 Campbell was charged with [[Pelagianism]], on account of ''Oratio de Vanitate Luminis Naturæ'' and other works, before the [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]], but was acquitted in March 1735-6, with a warning for the future. ''Remarks upon some passages in books by Professor Campbell, with his Explications'', was issued in 1735 by the committee of the general assembly "for purity of doctrine".{{sfn|Stephen|1886|p=341}} In 1736 Campbell issued ''Further Explications with respect to Articles ... wherein the Committee ... have declar’d {{sic|themseves}} not satisfy’d''. In 1739 he published ''The Necessity of Revelation'', in answer to Tindal. He died at his estate of Boarhill, near St. Andrews, on 24 April 1756. A book entitled ''The Authenticity of the Gospel History justified'' was published posthumously in 1759.{{sfn|Stephen|1886|p=341}}

==Family==
In 1723 Campbell married Christina Watson, daughter of an Edinburgh merchant. Twelve children survived him.  His eldest son, [[Archibald Campbell (satirist)|Archibald]] (fl. 1767), was author of "Lexiphanes".{{sfn|Stephen|1886|pp=340–341}}

Born in [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]], he entered the [[Universidad Nacional de Cuyo]], and graduated in 1949 with a degree in Education Sciences (''Profesor de Enseñanza Secundaria, Normal y Especial en Filosofía''). Roig continued his studies at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]].

He returned to Argentina, and in 1955 he began teaching philosophy at the Universidad Nacional de Cuyo, with a special interest in local philosophers. This interest subsequently expanded to national and [[Latin America]]n philosophers. Roig also studied German philosopher [[Karl Christian Friedrich Krause]], and authored his first book on the [[pantheist]] thinker's influence in Argentina.

He is famous for being one of the best developed examples of Latin American Philosophy, and for his vast amount of [[scientific]] works, for which he has received widespread recognition and [[award]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5259">'''Bernard Quiriny''' (born 27 June 1978) is a [[Belgium|Belgian]] writer and literary critic. He is also a professor of [[public law]] at the [[University of Burgundy]], having published numerous scholarly articles in the legal field since receiving his doctoral dissertation in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bernard Quiriny (faculty profile)| publisher=Law Department of University of Burgundy|url=http://credespo.u-bourgogne.fr/equipe/droit-public/102-quiriny-bernard.html| accessdate=7 Dec 2013| language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he works a staff writer and head of the literature column for the cultural magazine ''Chronic'art''.&lt;ref name=chronicart&gt;{{cite web | language=French| title = Chronic'art: C'est quoi ?| publisher = Chronic'art| year = 2013| url=http://www.chronicart.com/#!Accueil/APropos.sls| accessdate = 7 Dec 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary works==
Quiriny is best known for his collections of fantastic short stories (''L'Angoisse de la première phrase'', ''Contes carnivores'', ''Une collection très particulière''). All three feature a recurrent character, Pierre Gould, described as "eccentric", a "poet, dandy, book-lover, just a bit of a misanthrope".&lt;ref name=figaro2012&gt;{{cite web | last = Clermont| first = Thierry| title = Bernard Quiriny: Une collection très particulière| publisher = Le Figaro| date = 5 April 2012| url = http://www.lefigaro.fr/livres/2012/04/04/03005-20120404ARTFIG00742-bernard-quiriny-une-collection-tres-particuliere.php| accessdate = 7 Dec 2013| language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; These stories have often led to comparisons with other writers such as [[Jorge Luis Borges]], especially because of their inclusion of twists and fantastic or horrific elements.&lt;ref name=figaro2012 /&gt;

In 2010, Quiriny published his first novel, ''Les assoiffées'', which depicts modern Belgium as a closed, totalitarian government run by [[Radical Feminism|radical feminists]], similar [[North Korea]] in that little is known about what happens in Belgium in the outside world. The story follows Pierre Gould who, accompanied by a group of hand-picked journalists, is the first man to be receive permission to visit Belgium since the violent 1970 revolution.&lt;ref name=assoiffes-seuil&gt;{{cite web | language=French| title = Publisher's Description: Les assoiffés| publisher = Seuil.com| year = 2010| url = http://www.seuil.com/livre-9782020993661.htm| accessdate = 7 Dec 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His latest work, ''Monsieur Spleen'', is a [[biography]] of the [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolist]] poet [[Henri de Régnier]], an author today largely unknown in modern literary circles. Although biographical, the tone of the work is situated between that of a novel and a historical account, characterised by the use of irony and humour.&lt;ref name=critique-spleen&gt;{{cite web| language = French| title = Crtique : Monsieur Spleen| publisher = Le Magazine Littéraire| date = 30 Apr 2013| url = http://www.magazine-litteraire.com/mensuel/531/monsieur-spleen-01-05-2013-63511| accessdate = 11 Dec 2013| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130611085658/http://www.magazine-litteraire.com/mensuel/531/monsieur-spleen-01-05-2013-63511| archivedate = 2013-06-11| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==

Bernard Quiriny's second collection of short stories, ''Contes carnivores'', received the Prix du Style&lt;ref name=prixdustyle&gt;{{cite web | title=Palmares 2008| publisher=Le Prix du Style| year=2013| url=http://www.prixdustyle.com/palmares.php| accessdate=7 Dec 2013| language=French }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Prix Victor Rossel.&lt;ref name=prixrossel&gt;{{cite web | title=Portfolios, Littérature : Prix Victor Rossel| publisher=LeSoir.be| year=2013| url=http://portfolio.lesoir.be/v/culture/livres/prix_rossel/| accessdate=7 Dec 2013| language=French }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, his book ''Une collection très particulière'' was awarded the [[Grand Prix de l'Imaginaire]] for best French-language short stories.&lt;ref name=priximaginaire&gt;{{cite web| title=Palmares 2013| publisher=Grand Prix de l'Imaginaire| year=2013| url=http://www.noosfere.org/gpi/2013.php| accessdate=7 Dec 2013| language=French| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216155141/http://www.noosfere.org/gpi/2013.php| archivedate=2013-12-16| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3852">'''Carita Parahyangan''' ({{lang-en|Tale of Parahyangan}}) is a text contained in a single manuscript written around the late 16th century, registered as Kropak 406 from the former collection of the Bataviaasch Genootschap voor Kunsten en Wetenschappen (Batavian Society of Arts and Sciences), now in the ''Perpustakaan National'' (National Library) in [[Jakarta]]. It was identified as early as 1882 by Holle as the "Carita Parahyangan", the name derived from [[Parahyangan]] highlands in [[West Java]], originated from [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]] words which means "the abode of [[hyang]]s (gods)". Since that time the manuscript has received much scholarly attention.

The Carita Parahyangan tells the history of [[Sunda Kingdom]], from the early Galuh period in the early 8th century, during the era of Wretikandayun and [[Sri Sanjaya|King Sanjaya]], until the fall of Pakuan Pajajaran in the 16th century, the capital of Sunda kingdom under invasion by the [[Banten Sultanate]] assisted by the [[Sultanate of Cirebon|Cirebon]] and [[Demak Sultanate|Demak]] Sultanates.

The manuscript consists of 47 leaves of [[lontar palm]] leaf manuscript measuring {{convert|21|by|3|cm|in|abbr=on}}; each leaf contains four lines, written in [[Sundanese script]] in archaic [[Sundanese language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  | last =Noorduyn
  | first =J.
  | publisher= KITLV Press
  | title = Three Old Sundanese poems
  | date =
  | year =2006
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content and translations==
This manuscript consists of two parts. The larger part, the Carita Parahyangan proper, is a text on [[Sunda Kingdom|Sundanese]] kings and kingdoms from the pre-Islamic period. After earlier publication by Holle (1882a) and Pleyte (1914a) it was Poerbatjaraka /91919-21) who gave a complete transliteration of the manuscript. In 1962 Noorduyn (1962a, 1962b) devoted two important papers to the texts; in the first he managed to restore the order of the folio of the manuscript which was in disarray; in the second he gave an annotated transliteration and translation of the first part of the text. In a third paper Noorduyn (1966) published a number of additions and corrections to the earlier text edition, which were based on a careful rereading of the original manuscript.

Based on Noorduyn’s restoration of the order of the leaves in the major part of the manuscript, a new transliteration, with a translation in Indonesian and notes, was published by Atja and Danasasmita (1981c). In 1995 Darsa and Ekadjati presented a new edition and translation of the manuscript. In this work the other part of the manuscript, called by the editors Fragmen&lt;!--note spelling without T: this is correct--&gt; Carita Parahyangan, was published for the first time. This is a text found on 13 leaves (lempir) or 25 “pages”; graphically the two texts are different insofar as the Fragmen has an irregular number of lines (3-6) per page, unlike the Carita Parahyangan proper which consistently has four lines writing per page. Moreover, there are minor scriptural differences between the two parts of the manuscript. The Fragmen contains “three main stories of rulers of [[Sunda kingdom]] with capital city of [[Pakuan Pajajaran]]”. Its second, larger part is quite interesting from the viewpoint of social and economic history (Darsa and Ekadjati 1995:6). In a more recent paper Darsa (1999) has discussed in more detail the relation between the two texts in Kropak 406; it is clear that at an early stage the two texts must have been brought together in a single manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A '''concentrated animal feeding operation''' ('''CAFO'''), as defined by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) is an [[animal feeding operation]] (AFO)—a farm in which animals are raised in confinement—that has over 1000 "animal units" confined for over 45 days a year. An animal unit is an animal equivalent of 1000 pounds live weight. A thousand animal units equates to 1000 head of beef cattle, 700 dairy cows, 2500 swine weighing more than 55 lbs, 125 thousand broiler chickens, or 82 thousand laying hens or pullets.&lt;ref name=USDAdef/&gt;

A CAFO is also an animal feeding operation of any size that discharges its waste into a waterway. For the most part, there are regulations that restrict how much can be distributed and for what the quality of the materials has to be.&lt;ref name=USDAdef&gt;[https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/main/national/plantsanimals/livestock/afo/ "Animal Feeding Operations"], United States Department of Agriculture.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2016 there were around 212,000 AFOs in the United States,&lt;ref name="EPA CAFO Manual"/&gt;{{rp|1.2}} 19,496 of which were CAFOS.&lt;ref name="EPA 2016 summary"/&gt;{{efn|"Today, there are slightly more than one million farms with livestock in the United States. EPA estimates that about 212,000 of those farms are likely to be AFOs—operations where animals are kept and raised in confinement. Although the number of AFOs has declined since 2003, the total number of animals housed at AFOs has continued to grow because of expansion and consolidation in the industry. As Figure 1-1 shows, EPA’s NPDES CAFO program tracking indicates that 20,000 of those AFOs are CAFOs—AFOs that meet certain numeric thresholds or other criteria&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name="EPA CAFO Manual"/&gt;{{rp|1.2}}}}

Livestock production has become increasingly dominated by CAFOs in the United States and other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Imhoff, Douglas Tompkins, Roberto Carra.

==Definition==
There are roughly 212,000 AFOs in the United States,&lt;ref name="EPA CAFO Manual"&gt;{{cite report |date=February 2012 |title=NPDES Permit Writers' Manual for Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations |url=https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-10/documents/cafo_permitmanual_entire.pdf|publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C. |id=EPA 833-F-12-001}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1.2}} of which 19,496 met the more narrow criteria for CAFOs in 2016.&lt;ref name="EPA 2016 summary"&gt;{{cite report |date=2016-12-31 |title=NPDES CAFO Permitting Status Report—National Summary |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/npdes-cafo-regulations-implementation-status-reports |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has delineated '''three categories of CAFOs''', ordered in terms of capacity: large, medium and small.&lt;ref name=autogenerated17&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/sector_table.pdf R:\Public\...\sector_table.wp [PFP#1221434595&amp;#93;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The relevant [[animal unit]] for each category varies depending on species and capacity. For instance, large CAFOs house 1,000 or more [[cattle]], medium CAFOs can have 300–999 cattle, and small CAFOs harbor no more than 300 cattle.&lt;ref name=autogenerated17 /&gt;
[[File:Chicken Farm 034.jpg|thumb|291x291px|Chicken farms are considered CAFOs and have their own capacity thresholds.]]
The table below provides some examples of the size thresholds for CAFOs:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Animal Sector !! Large CAFOs !! Medium CAFOs !! Small CAFOs
|-
| cattle or cow/calf pairs || 1,000 or more || 300–999 || less than 300
|-
| mature dairy cattle || 700 or more || 200–699 || less than 200
|-
| turkeys || 55,000 or more || 16,500–54,999 || less than 16,500
|-
| laying hens or broilers (liquid manure handling systems) || 30,000 or more || 9,000–29,999 || less than 9,000
|-
| chickens other than laying hens (other than a liquid manure handling systems) || 125,000 or more || 37,500–124,999 || less than 37,500
|-
| laying hens (other than a liquid manure handling systems) || 82,000 or more || 25,000–81,999 || less than 25,000
|}

The categorization of CAFOs affects whether a facility is subject to regulation under the [[Clean Water Act]] (CWA). According to the 2008 rule adopted by the EPA, "large CAFOs are automatically subject to EPA regulation; medium CAFOs must also meet one of two 'method of discharge' criteria to be defined as a CAFO (or may be designated as such); and small CAFOs can only be made subject to EPA regulations on a case-by-case basis."&lt;ref name=autogenerated17 /&gt; A small CAFO will also be designated a CAFO for purposes of the CWA if it discharges pollutants into waterways of the United States through a man-made conveyance such as a road, [[ditch]] or [[Pipe (material)|pipe]]. Alternatively, a small CAFO may be designated an ordinary [[animal feeding operation]] (AFO) once its animal [[waste management]] system is certified at the site.
 
Since it first coined the term, the EPA has changed the definition (and applicable regulations) for CAFOs on several occasions. Private groups and individuals use the term CAFO colloquially to mean many types of both regulated and unregulated facilities, both inside and outside the United States. The definition used in everyday speech may thus vary considerably from the statutory definition in the CWA. CAFOs are commonly characterized as having large numbers of animals crowded into a confined space, a situation that results in the concentration of manure in a small area.

== Key issues ==
=== Environmental impact ===
{{see|manure lagoon|environmental impact of agriculture}}
The EPA has focused on regulating CAFOs because they generate millions of tons of manure every year. When improperly managed, the manure can pose substantial risks to the environment and [[public health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Waterkeeper Alliance, Inc. et al, v. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency |vol=399 |reporter=F. 3d |opinion=486 |pinpoint= |court=2d Cir. |date=2005-02-28 (amended 2005-03-16; 2005-04-18) |url=http://www.cals.ncsu.edu/course/are309/cases/waterkeeper.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to manage their waste, CAFO operators have developed [[agricultural wastewater treatment]] plans. The most common type of facility used in these plans, the [[anaerobic lagoon]], has significantly contributed to environmental and health problems attributed to the CAFO.&lt;ref name="nrdc pollution"&gt;{{cite web |title=Pollution from Giant Livestock Farms Threatens Public Health |url=http://www.nrdc.org/water/pollution/nspills.asp |website=Issue Areas: Water |publisher=Natural Resources Defense Council |location=New York, NY |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011093402/http://www.nrdc.org/water/pollution/nspills.asp |archive-date=2012-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Water quality====
The large amounts of animal waste from CAFOs present a risk to water quality and aquatic ecosystems.&lt;ref name=autogenerated20&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=1817674 |pmid=17384784 |doi=10.1289/ehp.8839 |volume=115 |issue=2 |title=Impacts of waste from concentrated animal feeding operations on water quality |year=2007 |journal=Environ.

According to the EPA, pollutants associated with CAFO waste principally include: 
# nutrients such as [[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]];
# organic matter;
# solids, including the manure itself and other elements mixed with it such as spilled feed, bedding and litter materials, hair, feathers and animal corpses;
# [[pathogens]] (disease-causing organisms such as bacteria and viruses);
# salts;
# trace elements such as [[arsenic]];
# odorous/volatile compounds such as [[carbon dioxide]], [[methane]], [[hydrogen sulfide]], and [[ammonia]];
# [[antibiotics]];
# [[pesticides]] and [[hormones]].&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). "National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permit Regulation and Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations." ''Federal Register,'' {{usfr|66|2960, 2976-79}} (proposed Jan. 12, 2001). See also: Preamble to the Final Rule at 7181&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NALBOH/&gt;

The two main contributors to water pollution caused by CAFOs are soluble nitrogen compounds and phosphorus. The [[eutrophication]] of water bodies from such waste is harmful to wildlife and water quality in aquatic system like streams, lakes, and oceans.&lt;ref&gt;Doug Gurian-Sherman. April 2008. [http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/food_and_agriculture/cafos-uncovered.pdf CAFOs Uncovered: The Untold Costs of Confined Animal Feeding Operations], Union of Concerned Scientists, Cambridge, MA.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because [[groundwater]] and surface water are closely linked, water pollution from CAFOs can affect both sources if one or the other is contaminated.&lt;ref name=NALBOH/&gt; Surface water may be polluted by CAFO waste through the runoff of nutrients, organics, and pathogens from fields and storage. Waste can be transmitted to groundwater through the [[leaching (agriculture)|leaching]] of pollutants.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, J.M. and McBride, W.D. (2009). [http://www.ers.usda.gov/Publications/EIB43/EIB43.pdf The transformation of U.S. livestock agriculture: Scale, efficiency, and risks]. United States Department of Agriculture.&lt;/ref&gt; Some facility designs, such as lagoons, can reduce the risk of groundwater contamination, but the microbial pathogens from animal waste may still pollute surface and groundwater, causing adverse effects on wildlife and human health.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., Burkholder et al. 1997; Mallin 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

A CAFO is responsible for one of the biggest environmental spills in U.S. history. In 1995, a {{convert|120,000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} lagoon ruptured in [[North Carolina]], releasing {{convert|25.8|e6USgal|m3}} of effluvium into the [[New River (North Carolina)|New River]].&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Science, Technology and Public Policy, Maharishi University of Management, Assessment of Impacts on Health, Local Economies, and the Environment with Suggested Alternatives&lt;/ref&gt; The spill resulted in the killing of 10 million fish in local water bodies. The spill also contributed to an outbreak of ''[[Pfiesteria piscicida]],'' which caused health problems for humans in the area including skin irritations and short term cognitive problems.&lt;ref&gt;Natural Resource Defense Council (2011). [http://www.nrdc.org/water/pollution/ffarms.asp "Facts about Pollution from Livestock Farms"].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Air quality====
CAFOs contribute to the reduction of ambient [[air pollution|air quality]]. CAFOs release several types of gas emissions—ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, [[methane emissions|methane]], and [[particulate matter]]—all of which bear varying human health risks. The amount of gas emissions depends largely on the size of the CAFO. The primary cause of gas emissions from CAFOs is the decomposition of animal manure being stored in large quantities.&lt;ref name=NALBOH/&gt; Additionally, CAFOs emit strains of antibiotic resistant bacteria into the surrounding air, particularly downwind from the facility. Levels of antibiotics measured downwind from swine CAFOs were three times higher than those measured upwind.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gibbs|first=Shawn G.|last2=Green|first2=Christopher F.|last3=Tarwater|first3=Patrick M.|last4=Mota|first4=Linda C.|last5=Mena|first5=Kristina D.|last6=Scarpino|first6=Pasquale V.|date=2006|title=Isolation of Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria from the Air Plume Downwind of a Swine Confined or Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=114|issue=7|pages=1032–1037|doi=10.1289/ehp.8910|issn=0091-6765|pmc=1513331|pmid=16835055|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is not widely known what is the source of these emissions, the animal feed is suspected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ferguson|first=Dwight D.|last2=Smith|first2=Tara C.|last3=Hanson|first3=Blake M.|last4=Wardyn|first4=Shylo E.|last5=Donham|first5=Kelley J.|date=2016|title=Detection of Airborne Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Inside and Downwind of a swine Building, and in Animal Feed: Potential Occupational, Animal Health, and Environmental Implications|journal=Journal of Agromedicine|volume=21|issue=2|pages=149–153|doi=10.1080/1059924X.2016.1142917|issn=1059-924X|pmc=4927327|pmid=26808288}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Hog confinement barn interior.jpg|thumb|Swine CAFO.]]Globally, [[ruminant]] livestock are responsible for about 115 Tg/a of the 330 Tg/a (35%) of [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] [[greenhouse gas]] emissions released per year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/134.htm#4211 "Trace Gases: Current Observations, Trends, and Budgets"], Climate Change 2001, IPCC Third Assessment Report.

=== Economic impact ===

====Increased role in the market====
The economic role of CAFOs has expanded significantly in the U.S. in the past few decades, and there is clear evidence that CAFOs have come to dominate [[animal production]] industries. The rise in large-scale animal agriculture began in the 1930s with the modern mechanization of swine slaughterhouse operations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncifap.org/bin/e/j/PCIFAPFin.pdf Putting Meat on the table: Industrial Farm Animal Production, Report of Pew Commission on Industrial Farm Animal Production]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Steak 03 bg 040306.jpg|thumb|Commonly consumed animal products like beef, milk, and eggs can be efficiently produced with proper CAFO management.]]
The growth of corporate contracting has also contributed to a transition from a system of many small-scale farms to one of relatively few large industrial-scale [[farms]]. This has dramatically changed the animal agricultural sector in the United States. According to the National Agricultural Statistics Service, "In the 1930s, there were close to 7 million farms in the United States and as of the 2002 census, just over 2 million farms remain."&lt;ref&gt;United States. National Agricultural Statistics Service. Farms and Land in Farms. February 2002&lt;/ref&gt; From 1969 to 2002, the number of family farms dropped by 39%,&lt;ref&gt;Oksana Nagayet. “Small Farms: Current Status and Key Trends.” Wye College. 26 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt; yet the percentage of family farms has remained high.  As of 2004, 98% of all U.S. farms were family-owned and -operated.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Hoppe, Penni Korb, Erik J. O’Donoghue, and David E. Banker, Structure and Finances of U.S. Farms, Family Farm Report, 2007 Edition, http://www.ers.usda.gov/media/201419/eib24_reportsummary_1_.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Most meat and dairy products are now produced on large farms with single-species buildings or open-air pens.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, J.M. and McBride, W.D. (2009). The transformation of U.S. livestock agriculture: Scale, efficiency, and risks. United States Department of Agriculture. http://www.ers.usda.gov/Publications/EIB43/EIB43.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

CAFOs can be very beneficial when properly located, managed and monitored. Due to their increased efficiency, CAFOs provide a source of low cost [[animal product]]s: meat, milk and eggs.  CAFOs may also stimulate local economies through increased employment and use of local materials in their production.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/ehs/docs/understanding_cafos_nalboh.pdf|title = Understanding Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations and Their Impact on Communities|date = 2010|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Hribar|first = Carrie}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of modern animal agriculture has increased the efficiency of raising meat and dairy products. Improvements in [[animal breeding]], mechanical innovations, and the introduction of specially formulated feeds (as well as [[List of veterinary drugs|animal pharmaceuticals]]) have contributed to the decrease in cost of animal products to consumers.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/ehs/Docs/Understanding_CAFOs_NALBOH.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The development of new technologies has also helped CAFO owners reduce production cost and increase business profits with less resources consumption. The growth of CAFOs has corresponded with an increase in the consumption of animal products in the United States. According to author Christopher L. Delgado, "milk production has doubled, meat production has tripled, and egg production has increased fourfold since 1960" in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Delgado | first1 = CL | year = 2003 | title = Rising rates of the consumption of meat and milk in developing countries has created a new food revolution | url = | journal = Journal of Nutrition | volume = 133 | issue = | pages = 3907S–3910S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the noted benefits, there are also criticisms regarding CAFOs' impact on the economy. Many farmers in the United States find that it is difficult to earn a high income due to the low market prices of animal products.&lt;ref&gt;Steven C. Blank (April 1999). [http://www.soc.iastate.edu/soc130/Readings/Unit%20I/End%20of%20the%20American%20Farm.pdf The end of american farm].&lt;/ref&gt;  Such market factors often lead to low profit margins for production methods and a competitive disadvantage against CAFOs. Alternative animal production methods, like "free range" or "family farming" operations&lt;ref&gt;Daryll E. Ray and the Agricultural Policy Analysis Center, [http://mfu.org/node/253 TN. CAFO critics promote alternative approaches to production], University of Tennessee, Knoxville.&lt;/ref&gt; are losing their ability to compete, though they present few of the environmental and health risks associated with CAFOs.

====Negative production externalities====
[[File:Cattlemanure.jpg|thumb|Some argue that CAFOs have unfair advantages due to their ability to shift the costs of animal waste externally like this cattle manure.]]
Critics have long argued that the "retail prices of industrial meat, dairy, and egg products omit immense impacts on human health, the environment, and other shared public assets."&lt;ref name=autogenerated22&gt;[http://www.cafothebook.org/thebook_myths.htm "CAFO, The Tragedy of Industrial Animal Factories"]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[externality|negative production externalities]] of CAFOs have been described as including "massive waste amounts with the potential to heat up the atmosphere, foul fisheries, pollute drinking water, spread disease, contaminate soils, and damage recreational areas"&lt;ref name=autogenerated22 /&gt; that are not reflected in the price of the meat product. Environmentalists contend that "citizens ultimately foot the bill with hundreds of billions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies, medical expenses, insurance premiums, declining property values, and mounting [[Environmental remediation|cleanup costs]]."&lt;ref name=autogenerated22 /&gt; Some economists agree that CAFOs "operate on an inefficient scale."&lt;ref name=autogenerated9&gt;William J. Weida (Jan. 5, 2000). [http://sraproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/economicimplicationsofcafos.pdf "Economic Implications of Confined Animal Feeding Operations"].&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued, for instance, that "diminishing returns to scale quickly lead to costs of animal confinement that overwhelm any benefits of CAFOs."&lt;ref name=autogenerated9 /&gt; These economists claim that CAFOs are at an unfair competitive advantage because they shift the costs of animal waste from CAFOs to the surrounding region (an unaccounted for "externality").

The evidence shows that CAFOs may be contributing to the drop in nearby property values. There are many reasons for the decrease in property values, such as loss of amenities, potential risk of water contamination, odors, air pollution, and other health related issues. One study shows that property values on average decrease by 6.6% within a {{convert|3|mi|km|adj=on}} radius of a CAFO and by 88% within 1/10 of a mile from a CAFO.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/ehs/Docs/Understanding_CAFOs_NALBOH.pdf Understanding Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations and Their Impact on Communities].&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of CAFOs, including those in farm industry, respond by arguing that the negative externalities of CAFOs are limited. One executive in the pork industry, for instance, claims that any odor or noise from CAFOs is limited to an area within a quarter-mile of the facility.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Wales (Sept.–Oct. 2007). [www.bizvoicemagazine.com/archives/07sepoct/Agriculture.pdf "Agricultural Values on the Rise"] BuzVoice.&lt;/ref&gt;  Proponents also point to the positive effect they believe CAFOs have on the local economy and tax base. CAFOs buy feed from and provide fertilizer to local farmers.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Wales (Sept.–Oct. 2007). [www.bizvoicemagazine.com/archives/07sepoct/Agriculture.pdf "Agricultural Values on the Rise"]. BuzVoice&lt;/ref&gt; And the same executive claims that farmers near CAFOs can save $20 per acre by using waste from CAFOs as a fertilizer.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Wales (Sept.–Oct. 2007). [www.bizvoicemagazine.com/archives/07sepoct/Agriculture.pdf "Agricultural Values on the Rise"]. BuzVoice.&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmentalists contend that "[[Sustainable agriculture|sustainable]] livestock operations" present a "less costly alternative."&lt;ref name=autogenerated23&gt;[http://www.cafothebook.org/thebook_myths.htm "CAFO, The Tragedy of Industrial Animal Factories"].&lt;/ref&gt; These operations, it is argued, "address potential health and environmental impacts through their production methods." And though "sustainably produced foods may cost a bit more, many of their potential beneficial environmental and social impacts are already included in the price."&lt;ref name=autogenerated23 /&gt; In other words, it is argued that if CAFO operators were required to internalize the [[full cost accounting|full costs]] of production, then some CAFOs might be less efficient than the smaller farms they replace.&lt;ref&gt;John Ikerd.

University of Missouri, Columbia.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other economic criticisms====
Critics of CAFOs also maintain that CAFOs benefit from the availability of industrial and agricultural tax breaks/subsidies and the "vertical integration of giant agribusiness firms."&lt;ref name=autogenerated9 /&gt;  The [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] (USDA), for instance, spent an average of $16 billion annually between FY 1996 to FY 2002 on commodity based subsidies.&lt;ref&gt;Becker, Geoffrey S. Farm Commodity Programs: A Short Primer. Congressional Research Service. 20 June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some allege that the lax enforcement of anti-competitive practices may be contributing to the formulation of market monopoly.

The direct discharge of manure from CAFOs and the accompanying pollutants (including nutrients, [[antibiotics]], [[pathogen]]s, and [[arsenic]]) is a serious [[public health risk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walker|first=Polly|last2=Rhubart-Berg|first2=Pamela|last3=McKenzie|first3=Shawn|last4=Kelling|first4=Kristin|last5=Lawrence|first5=Robert S.|date=2005|title=Public health implications of meat production and consumption|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/public-health-nutrition/article/public-health-implications-of-meat-production-and-consumption/B22CB5C2097A13C6745A94B6D6B81284|journal=Public Health Nutrition|language=en|volume=8|issue=4|pages=348–356|doi=10.1079/PHN2005727|issn=1475-2727|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[groundwater contamination|contamination of groundwater]] with pathogenic organisms from CAFOs can threaten drinking water resources, and the transfer of pathogens through drinking water contamination can lead to widespread outbreaks of illness. The EPA estimates that about 53% of people in the United States rely on groundwater resources for drinking water.&lt;ref&gt;(EPA 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

There are numerous effects on human health due to water contaminated by CAFOs.  Accidental ingestion of contaminated water can result in diarrhea or other gastrointestinal illnesses and dermal exposure can result in irritation and infection of the skin, eyes or ear.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Impacts of Waste from Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations on Water Quality|journal = Environmental Health Perspectives|pmc = 1817674|pmid = 17384784|pages = 308–312|volume = 115|issue = 2|doi = 10.1289/ehp.8839|first = JoAnn|last = Burkholder|first2 = Bob|last2 = Libra|first3 = Peter|last3 = Weyer|first4 = Susan|last4 = Heathcote|first5 = Dana|last5 = Kolpin|first6 = Peter S.|last6 = Thorne|first7 = Michael|last7 = Wichman|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  High levels of nitrate also pose a threat to high-risk populations such as young children, pregnant women or the elderly.  Several studies have shown that high levels of nitrate in drinking water are associated with increased risk of hyperthyroidism,  insulin dependent diabetes and central nervous system malformations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The exposure to chemical contaminates, such as antibiotics, in drinking water also creates problems for public health.&lt;ref name="autogenerated20" /&gt; In order to maximize animal production, CAFOs have used an increasing number of antibiotics, which in turn, increases [[bacterial resistance]]. This resistance threatens the efficiency of medical treatment for humans fighting bacterial infections.  Contaminated surface and groundwater is especially concerning, due to its role as a pathway for the dissemination of antibiotic resistant bacteria.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Scourge of Antibiotic Resistance: The Important Role of the Environment|url = http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/57/5/704|journal = Clinical Infectious Diseases|date = 2013-09-01|issn = 1058-4838|pmid = 23723195|pages = 704–710|volume = 57|issue = 5|doi = 10.1093/cid/cit355|first = Rita L.|last = Finley|first2 = Peter|last2 = Collignon|first3 = D.

Antibiotics are used heavily in CAFOs to both treat and prevent illness in individual animals as well as groups. The close quarters inside CAFOs promote the sharing of pathogens between animals and thus, the rapid spread of disease. Even if their stock are not sick, CAFOs will incorporate low doses of antibiotics into feed “to reduce the chance for infection and to eliminate the need for animals to expend energy fighting off bacteria, with the assumption that saved energy will be translated into growth”.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This practice is an example of a non-therapeutic use of antibiotics. Such antibiotic use is thought to allow animals to grow faster and bigger, consequently maximizing production for that CAFO. Regardless, the World Health Organization has recommended that the non-therapeutic use of antibiotics in [[animal husbandry]] be reevaluated, as it contributes to the overuse of antibiotics and thus the emergence of resistant bacteria that can spread to humans.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization(WHO).

=== Animal health and welfare concerns ===
CAFO practices have raised concerns over [[animal welfare]] from an ethics standpoint. Some view such conditions as neglectful to basic animal welfare. Many people believe that the harm to animals before their slaughter should be addressed through public policy.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Clive, The Welfare Of Animals: The Silent Majority, Springer, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Laws regarding animal welfare in CAFOs have already been passed in the United States. For instance, in 2002, the state of Florida passed an amendment to the state's constitution banning the confinement of pregnant pigs in [[gestation crate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Sun-Sentinel/Associated Press (November 6, 2002). [https://archive.is/20130203210910/http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/local/southflorida/sfl-1105pigs.story Tallahassee]&lt;/ref&gt;  As a source for comparison, the use of [[battery cage]]s for egg-laying hens and battery cage breeding methods have been completely outlawed in the European Union since 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/264607.stm “EU bans battery hen cages”], BBC NEWS, January 28, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas some people are concerned with animal welfare as an end in itself, others are concerned about animal welfare because of the effect of living conditions on [[consumer safety]]. Animals in CAFOs have lives that do not resemble those of animals found in the wild.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Imhoff. [http://www.cafothebook.org/thebook_authors.htm “Honoring The Food Animals On Your Plate”].&lt;/ref&gt; Although CAFOs help secure a reliable supply of animal products, the quality of the goods produced is debated, with many arguing that the food produced is unnatural. For instance, confining animals into small areas requires the use of large quantities of antibiotics to prevent the spread of disease. There are debates over whether the use of antibiotics in meat production is harmful to humans.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.extension.purdue.edu/extmedia/ID/cafo/ID-349.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regulation under the Clean Water Act ==
=== Basic structure of CAFO regulations under the CWA ===
The command-and-control permitting structure of the [[Clean Water Act]] (CWA) provides the basis for nearly all regulation of CAFOs in the United States. Generally speaking, the CWA prohibits the discharge of pollution to the "waters of the United States" from any "[[Point source water pollution|point source]]", unless the discharge is authorized by a [[National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System]] (NPDES) permit issued by the EPA (or a state delegated by the EPA). CAFOs are explicitly listed as a point source in the CWA.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/33/1362- 33 U.S.C. 1362].&lt;/ref&gt; Unauthorized discharges made from CAFOs (and other point sources) violate the CWA, even if the discharges are "unplanned or accidental."&lt;ref name=autogenerated18&gt;Claudia Copeland, ''Animal Waste and Water Quality: EPA's Response to the'' Waterkeeper Alliance ''Court Decision on Regulation of CAFOs'', ''in'' WATER POLLUTION ISSUES AND DEVELOPMENTS 77 (Sarah V. Thomas, ed., 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; CAFOs that do not apply for NPDES permits "operate at their own risk because any discharge from an unpermitted CAFO (other than agricultural [[stormwater]]) is a violation of the CWA subject to enforcement action, including third party citizen suits."&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, "Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations Final Rulemaking - Q&amp;A (Dec. 3, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

The benefit of an NPDES permit is that it provides some level of certainty to CAFO owners and operators. "Compliance with the permit is deemed compliance with the CWA... and thus acts as a shield against EPA or State CWA enforcement or against citizen suits under... the CWA."&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; In addition, the "upset and bypass" provisions of the permit can give ''permitted'' CAFO owners a legal defense when "emergencies or [[natural disaster]]s cause discharges beyond their reasonable control."&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

Under the CWA, the EPA specifies the maximum allowable amounts of pollution that can be discharged by facilities within an industrial category (like CAFOs). These general "[[Effluent guidelines|effluent limitations guidelines]]" (ELG) then dictate the terms of the specific effluent limitations found in individual NPDES permits. The limits are based on the performance of specific technologies, but the EPA does not generally require the industry to use these technologies. Rather, the industry may use "any effective alternatives to meet the pollutant limits."&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Claudia Copeland, ''Animal Waste and Water Quality: EPA's Response to the'' Waterkeeper Alliance "Court Decision on Regulation of CAFOs", in ''Water Pollution Issues and Developments'' 82 (Sarah V. Thomas, ed., 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Discharge pipe.jpg|thumb|The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] sets discharge limits for CAFOs.]]
The EPA places minimum ELG requirements into each permit issued for CAFOs. The requirements can include both ''numeric discharge limits'' (the amount of a pollutant that can be released into waters of the United States) and ''other requirements related to ELGs'' (such as management practices, including technology standards).&lt;ref&gt;Frank R. Spellmen &amp; Nancy E. Whiting, ''Environmental Management of Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs)'' 29 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of regulations===
The major CAFO regulatory developments occurred in the 1970s and in the 2000s. The EPA first promulgated ELGs for CAFOs in 1976.&lt;ref name=autogenerated18 /&gt; The 2003 rule issued by the EPA updated and modified the applicable ELGs for CAFOs, among other things. In 2005, the court decision in ''Waterkeeper Alliance v. EPA'' (see below) struck down parts of the 2003 rule. The EPA responded by issuing a revised rule in 2008.

A complete history of EPA’s CAFO rulemaking activities is provided on the CAFO Rule History page.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/afo/aforule.cfm EPA – CAFO Rule History&lt;!-- Bot-generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122112200/http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/afo/aforule.cfm|date=November 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Background laws====
The ''Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1948'' was one of the first major efforts of the U.S. federal government to establish a comprehensive program for mitigating pollution in public water ways. The writers of the act aimed to improve water quality for the circulation of aquatic life, industry use, and recreation. Since 1948, the Act has been amended many times to expand programming, procedures, and standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fws.gov/laws/lawsdigest/fwatrpo.html "Federal Water Pollution Control Act (Clean Water Act)." ''Digest of Federal Resource Laws of Interest to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Richard Nixon]]’s executive order, ''[[Reorganization Plan No. 3]],'' created the EPA in 1970. The creation of the EPA was an effort to create a more comprehensive approach to pollution management. As noted in the order, a single polluter may simultaneously degrade a local environment’s air, water, and land. President Nixon noted that a single government entity should be monitoring and mitigating pollution and considering all effects. As relevant to CAFO regulation, the EPA became the main federal authority on CAFO pollution monitoring and mitigation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/history/org/origins/reorg.htm Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1970 | EPA History | US EPA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714022222/http://www.epa.gov/history/org/origins/reorg.htm |date=2007-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Congress of the United States|Congress]] passed the CWA in 1972 when it reworked the ''Federal Water Pollution Control Amendments.''&lt;ref&gt;United States. Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972. [http://www.epw.senate.gov/water.pdf Pub.L. 92-500], October 18, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; It specifically defines CAFOs as point source polluters and required operations managers and/or owners to obtain NPDES permits in order to legally discharge wastewater from its facilities.&lt;ref name=autogenerated25&gt;
EPA (December 1995). [http://www.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/owm0266.pdf "Guide Manual On NPDES Regulations For Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations."] EPA 833-B-95-001.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Initial regulations (1970s)====
The EPA began regulating water pollution from CAFOs starting in the 1970s. The EPA first created [[Effluent guidelines|effluent limitation guidelines]] (ELGs) for [[feedlot]] operations in 1974, placing emphasis on [[best available technology]] in the industry at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/manurematters/34/ U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 39 ''Federal Register'' 5704].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, under the ELGs, the EPA began requiring all CAFOs to be first defined as AFOs. From that point, if the specific AFO met the appropriate criteria, it would then be classified as a CAFO and subject to appropriate regulation. That same year, EPA defined livestock and poultry CAFO facilities and established a specialized permitting program.&lt;ref name=autogenerated11&gt;U.S. Government Accountability Office, Washington, D.C. [http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d08944.pdf "Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations: EPA Needs More Information and a Clearly Defined Strategy to Protect Air and Water Quality from Pollutants of Concern."] Report GAO-08-944.&lt;/ref&gt; NPDES permits specifications for CAFOs were also promulgated by the EPA in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 41 ''Federal Register'' 11,458&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to 1976, size had been the main defining criteria of CAFOs. However, after the 1976 regulations came into effect, the EPA stipulated some exceptions. Operations that were identified as particularly harmful to federal waterways could be classified as CAFOs, even if the facilities’ sizes fall under AFOs standards. Additionally, some CAFOs were not required to apply for wastewater discharge permits if they met the two major operational-based exemptions. The first exception applied to operations that discharge wastewater only during a 25-year, 24-hour storm event. (The operation only discharges during a 24-hour rainfall period that occurs once every 25 years or more on average.) The second exception was when operations apply animal waste onto agricultural land.&lt;ref name=autogenerated11 /&gt;

====Developments in the 1990s====
In 1989, the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] and [[Public Citizen Litigation Group|Public Citizen]] filed a lawsuit against the EPA (and Administrator of the EPA, [[William Reilly]]). The plaintiffs claimed the EPA had not complied with the CWA with respect to CAFOs.&lt;ref name=autogenerated11 /&gt; The lawsuit, ''Natural Resources Defense Council v. Reilly'' (D.D.C. 1991), resulted in a court order mandating the EPA update its regulations. They did so in what would become the 2003 Final Rule.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/afo/cafofinalrule.cfm EPA – Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations – Final Rule&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, the EPA released a "Guide Manual on NPDES Regulations for Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations" to provide more clarity to the public on NPDES regulation after the EPA’s report "Feedlots Case Studies of Selected States" revealed there was uncertainty in the public regarding CAFO regulatory terminology and criteria.&lt;ref name=autogenerated25 /&gt; Although the document is not a rule, it did offer insight and furthered public understanding of previous rules.

In his 1998 Clean Water Action Plan, President [[Bill Clinton]] directed the USDA and the EPA to join forces to develop a framework for future actions to improve national water quality standards for public health. The two federal agencies’ specific responsibility was to improve the management of animal waste runoff from agricultural activities. In 1998, the USDA and the EPA hosted eleven public meetings across the country to discuss animal feeding operations (AFOs).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/afomeet.htm Office of Wastewater Management - Small Communities&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 9, 1999 the agencies released the framework titled the ''Unified National Strategy for Animal Feeding Operations''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/afo/ustrategy.cfm EPA - AFO Unified Strategy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In the framework, the agencies recommended six major activities to be included in operations’ Comprehensive Nutrient Management Plans (CNMPs):
#feed management
#manure handling and storage
#land application of manure
#land management
#record keeping
#activities that utilize manure.&lt;ref name=autogenerated12&gt;USDA and EPA (2012). [http://www.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/exexsum.pdf "Unified National AFO Strategy Executive Summary."]&lt;/ref&gt;
The framework also outlined two types of related programs. First, “voluntary programs” were designed to assist AFO operators with addressing public health and water quality problems.&lt;ref name=autogenerated12 /&gt; The framework outlines three types of voluntary programs available: “locally led conservation,” “environmental education,” and “financial and technical assistance.”&lt;ref name=autogenerated12 /&gt; The framework explained that those that participate in voluntary programs are not required to have a comprehensive nutrient management plan (CNMP). The second type of program outlined by the framework was ''regulatory'', which includes [[Command and control (management)|command-and-control]] regulation with NPDES permitting.&lt;ref name=autogenerated12 /&gt;

=== EPA final rule (2003) ===
According to the EPA, the purpose of the 2003 rule was to update decades-old policies to reflect new technology advancements and increase the expected pollution mitigation from CAFOs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/cafo_themes.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The EPA was also responding to a 1991 court order based on the district court's decision in ''Natural Resources Defense Council v. Reilly''.&lt;ref name=autogenerated11 /&gt; The final rule took effect on April 14, 2003 and responded to public comments received following the issuance of the proposed rule in 2000.&lt;ref name=autogenerated26&gt;[http://www.bae.ncsu.edu/programs/extension/manure/awm/program/epa-rule-feeding.htm Animal Feeding Operations CAFO Rule Animal Waste Program - Department of Biological And Agricultural Engineering at NC State University&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The EPA allowed authorized NPDES states until February 2005 to update their programs and develop technical standards.&lt;ref name=autogenerated26 /&gt;

''Federal Register,'' February 12, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; established [[Best management practice for water pollution|"non-numerical best management practices"]] (BMPs) for CAFOs that apply both to the "production areas" (e.g. the animal confinement area and the manure storage area) and, for the first time ever, to the "land application area" (land to which manure and other animal waste is applied as fertilizer).&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Claudia Copeland, ''Animal Waste and Water Quality: EPA's Response to the'' Waterkeeper Alliance "Court Decision on Regulation of CAFOs," in ''Water Pollution Issues and Developments'' 78 (Sarah V.

*''Production Area'': Discharges from a production area must meet a performance standard that requires CAFOs to "maintain waste containment structures that generally prohibit discharges except in the event of overflows or runoff resulting from a 25-year, 24-hour rainfall event."&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; New sources are required to meet a standard of "no discharge" except in the event of a 100-year, 24-hour rainfall event.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;
*''Land Application Area'': The BMPs for land application areas include different requirements, such as vegetative [[buffer strip]]s and setback limits from water bodies.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

The 2003 rule also requires CAFOs to submit an annual performance report to the EPA and to develop and implement a comprehensive [[nutrient management plan]] (NMP) for handling animal waste.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; Lastly, in an attempt to broaden the scope of regulated facilities, the 2003 rule expanded the number of CAFOs required to apply for NPDES permits by making it mandatory for ''all'' CAFOs (not just those who actually discharge pollutants into waters of the United States).&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; Many of the provisions of the rule were affected by the Second Circuit's decision issued in ''Waterkeeper Alliance v. EPA.''

==== ''Waterkeeper Alliance v. EPA'' (2nd Cir. 2005) ====
Environmental and farm industry groups challenged the 2003 final rule in court, and the [[Second Circuit Court of Appeals]] issued a decision in the consolidated case [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14215052175672315090&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr ''Waterkeeper Alliance, Inc. v. EPA'', 399 F.3d 486 (2nd Cir. 2005)]. The Second Circuit's decision reflected a "partial victory" for both environmentalists and industry, as all parties were "unsatisfied to at least some extent" with the court's decision.&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Copeland, ''Animal Waste and Water Quality: EPA's Response to the'' Waterkeeper Alliance ''Court Decision on Regulation of CAFOs'', ''in'' WATER POLLUTION ISSUES AND DEVELOPMENTS 77–78 (Sarah V. Thomas, ed., 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; The court's decision addressed four main issues with the 2003 final rule promulgated by the EPA:
* '''Agricultural Stormwater Discharges''': The EPA's authority to regulate CAFO waste that results in agricultural stormwater discharge was one of the "most controversial" aspects of the 2003 rule.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8&gt;Claudia Copeland, ''Animal Waste and Water Quality: EPA's Response to the'' Waterkeeper Alliance ''Court Decision on Regulation of CAFOs'', ''in'' WATER POLLUTION ISSUES AND DEVELOPMENTS 79 (Sarah V. Thomas, ed., 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; The issue centered on the scope of the [[Clean Water Act]] (CWA), which provides for the regulation only of "point sources." The term was defined by the CWA to expressly ''include'' CAFOs but ''exclude'' "agricultural stormwater."&lt;ref&gt;Clean Water Act, Section 502(14).&lt;/ref&gt; The EPA was thus forced to interpret the statutory definition to "identify the conditions under which discharges from the land application area of [waste from] a CAFO are point source discharges that are subject to NPDES permitting requirements, and those which are agricultural stormwater discharges and thus are not point source discharges."&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt; In the face of widely divergent views of environmentalists and industry groups, the EPA in the 2003 rule determined that any runoff resulting from manure applied ''in accordance with agronomic rates'' would be exempt from the CWA permitting requirements (as "agricultural stormwater"). However, when such agronomic rates are not used, the EPA concluded that the resulting runoff from a land application is ''not'' "agricultural stormwater" and is therefore subject to the CWA (as a discharge from a point source, i.e. the CAFO). The Second Circuit upheld the EPA's definition as a "reasonable" interpretation of the statutory language in the CWA.
* '''Duty to Apply for an NPDES Permit''': The 2003 rule adopted by the EPA imposed a duty on ''all'' CAFOs to apply for an NPDES permit (or demonstrate that they had no potential to discharge).&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, "National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permit Regulation and Effluent Limitation Guidelines and Standards for Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations CAFO; Final Rule," 68 ''Federal Register'' 7175–7274 (Feb. 12, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale for this requirement was the EPA's "presumption that most CAFOs have a potential to discharge pollutants into waters of the United States" and therefore must affirmatively comply with the requirements of the Clean Water Act.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, "Revised Compliance Dates for National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permit Regulation and Effluent Limitation Guidelines for Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations in Response to Waterkeeper Decision; Proposed Rule," 71 ''Federal Register'' 37,744–87 (June 30, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; The Second Circuit sided with the farm industry plaintiffs on this point and ruled that this portion of the 2003 rule exceeded the EPA's authority. The court held that the EPA can require NPDES permits only where there is an ''actual'' discharge by a CAFO, not just a potential to discharge. The EPA later estimated that 25 percent fewer CAFOs would seek permits as a result of the Second Circuit's decision on this issue.&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Copeland, ''Animal Waste and Water Quality: EPA's Response to the'' Waterkeeper Alliance ''Court Decision on Regulation of CAFOs'', ''in'' WATER POLLUTION ISSUES AND DEVELOPMENTS 80 (Sarah V. Thomas, ed., 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Nutrient Management Plans (NMPs)''': The fight in court over the portion of the 2003 rule on NMPs was a proxy for a larger battle over public participation by environmental groups in the implementation of the CWA. The 2003 rule required all permitted CAFOs that "land apply" animal waste to develop an NMP that satisfied certain minimum requirements (e.g. ensuring proper storage of manure and process wastewater). A copy of the NMP was to be kept on-site at the facility, available for viewing by the EPA or other permitting authority. The environmental plaintiffs argued that this portion of the rule violated the CWA and the [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act]] by failing to make the NMP part of the NPDES permit itself (which would make the NMP subject to both public comments and enforcement in court by private citizens). The court sided with the environmental plaintiffs and vacated this portion of the rule.&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Copeland, ''Animal Waste and Water Quality: EPA's Response to the'' Waterkeeper Alliance ''Court Decision on Regulation of CAFOs'', ''in'' WATER POLLUTION ISSUES AND DEVELOPMENTS 80-81 (Sarah V. Thomas, ed., 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Effluent Limitation Guidelines (ELGs) for CAFOs''': The 2003 rule issued [[New Source Performance Standard#Clean Water Act|New Source Performance Standards]] (NSPS) for new sources of swine, poultry, and veal operations. The CWA requires that NSPS be based on what is called the "best available demonstrated control technology."&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Clean Water Act, section 306(a), {{USCSub|33|1316|a}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The EPA's 2003 rule required that these new sources meet a "no discharge" standard, except in the case of a 100-year, 24-hour rainfall event (or a less restrictive measure for new CAFOs that voluntarily use new technologies and management practices). The Second Circuit ruled that the EPA did not provide an adequate basis (either in the statute or in evidence) for this portion of the rule.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; The Second Circuit also required the EPA to go back and provide additional justification for the requirements in the 2003 rule dealing with the "best control technology for conventional pollutants" (BCT) standards for reducing fecal coliform pathogen. Lastly, the court ordered the EPA to provide additional analysis on whether the more stringent "water quality-based effluent permit limitations" (WQBELs) should be required in certain instances for CAFO discharges from land application areas, a policy that the EPA had rejected in the 2003 rule.

=== EPA final rule (2008) ===
The EPA published revised regulations that address the Second Circuit court’s decision in ''Waterkeeper Alliance, Inc. v. EPA'' on November 20, 2008 (effective December 22, 2008).&lt;ref&gt;[http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/afo/cafofinalrule.cfm U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2008 Final Rule].&lt;/ref&gt; The 2008 final rule revised and amended the 2003 final rule.

The 2008 rule addresses each point of the court's decision in ''Waterkeeper Alliance v. EPA.'' Specifically, the EPA adopted the following measures:
*[[File:CAFO hogs.jpg|thumb|196x196px|Pork lobbyists challenged EPA discharge permit requirements in 2011.]]The EPA replaced the "duty to apply" standard with one that requires NPDES permit coverage for any CAFO that "discharges or proposes to discharge." The 2008 rule specifies that "a CAFO proposes to discharge if it is designed, constructed, operated, or maintained such that a discharge will occur."&lt;ref&gt;EPA (2008-10-20). "Revised National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permit Regulation and Effluent Limitations Guidelines for Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations in Response to the Waterkeeper Decision; Final Rule."  ''Federal Register,'' {{usfr|73|70418}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 28, 2010, the EPA issued guidance "designed to assist permitting authorities in implementing the [CAFO regulations] by specifying the kinds of operations and factual circumstances that EPA anticipates may trigger the duty to apply for permits.”&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. [http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/afo/info.cfm "Implementation Guidance on CAFO Regulations--CAFOs that Discharge or Are Proposing to Discharge"].&lt;/ref&gt; On March 15, 2011, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in '''''National Pork Producers Council v. EPA''''' again struck down the EPA's rule on this issue, holding that the "propose to discharge" standard exceeds the EPA's authority under the CWA. After the Fifth Circuit's ruling, a CAFO cannot be required to apply for an NPDES permit unless it ''actually'' discharges into a water of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;''National Pork Producers Council v. EPA'', 2011 WL 871736 (5th Cir. Mar. 15, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The EPA modified the requirements related to the nutrient management plans (NMP). In keeping with the court's decision in ''Waterkeeper Alliance v. EPA'', the EPA instituted a requirement that the permitting authority (either the EPA or the State) incorporate the enforceable "terms of the NMP" into the actual permit. The "terms of the NMP" include the "information, protocols, best management practices (BMPs) and other conditions in the NMP necessary to meet the NMP requirements of the 2003 rule."&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; The EPA must make the NMPs in the applications filed by CAFOs publicly available.
* The EPA reiterated that in order to take advantage of the "agricultural stormwater" exception (upheld by the court in ''Waterkeeper Alliance v. EPA'') an unpermitted CAFO must still implement "site-specific nutrient management practices that ensure appropriate agricultural utilization of the nutrients as specified previously under the 2003 rule."&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; The unpermitted facility must keep documentation of such practices and make it available to the permitting authority in the case of a precipitation-related discharge.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;
* The EPA addressed the Second Circuit's ruling on the [[Effluent guidelines|effluent limitation guidelines]] (ELGs) for CAFOs. The agency deleted the provision allowing new sources of CAFOs to meet a 100-year, 24-hour precipitation-event standard, replacing it with a "no discharge" standard through the establishment of [[Best management practice for water pollution|best management practices]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; The EPA also clarified and defended its previous positions on (1) the availability of water quality-based effluent limitations (WQBELs) and (2) the appropriateness of the best control technology (BCT) standards for fecal coliform. First, the 2008 rule "explicitly recognizes" that the permitting authority may impose WQBELs on all production area discharges and all land application discharges (other than those that meet the "agricultural stormwater" exemption) if the technology-based effluent limitations are deemed insufficient to meet the water quality standards of a particular body of water. In particular, the EPA noted that a case-by-case review should be adopted in cases where CAFOs discharge to the waters of the United States through a direct hydrologic connection to groundwater.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; Second, the EPA announced that it would not be promulgating more stringent standards for fecal coliform than in the 2003 rule because it reached the conclusion there is "no available, achievable, and cost reasonable technology on which to base such limitations."&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;
The 2008 final rule also specifies two approaches that a CAFO may use to identify the "annual maximum rates of application of manure, litter, and process wastewater by field and crop for each year of permit coverage." The '''linear approach''' expresses the rate in terms of the "amount of nitrogen and phosphorus from manure, litter, and process wastewater allowed to be applied." The '''narrative rate approach''' expresses the amount in terms of a "narrative rate prescribing how to calculate the amount of manure, litter, and process wastewater allowed to be applied.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; The EPA believes that the narrative approach gives CAFO operators the most flexibility. Normally, CAFO operators are subject to the terms of their permit for a period of 5 years. Under the narrative approach, CAFO operators can use "real time" data to determine the rates of application. As a result, CAFO operators can more easily "change their crop rotation, form and source of manure, litter, and process wastewater, as well as the timing and method of application" without having to seek a revision to the terms of their NPDES permits.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

=== Government assistance for compliance ===
The EPA points to several tools available to assist CAFO operators in meeting their obligations under the CWA. First, the EPA awards federal grants to provide technical assistance to livestock operators for preventing discharges of water pollution (and reducing air pollution). The EPA claims that CAFOs can obtain an NMP for free under these grants.&lt;ref&gt;EPA (2008-12-03). "Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations Final Rulemaking – Q&amp;A.&lt;br /&gt;For more information on the program, the EPA directs interested persons to http://livestock.rti.org/ or http://www.erc-env.org/CLEANMP.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, the annual amount of the grant totaled $8 million.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; Second, a Manure Management Planner (MMP) software program has been developed by [[Purdue University]] in conjunction with funding by a federal grant. The MMP is tailored to each state's technical standards (including Phosphorus Indexes and other assessment tools).&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; The MMP program provides free assistance to both permitting authorities and CAFO operators and can be found at the Purdue University website.&lt;ref&gt;Purdue University. http://www.agry.purdue.edu/mmp/&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, the EPA notes that the USDA offers a "range of support services," including a long-term program that aims to assist CAFOs with NMPs.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

===Debate over EPA policy===
Environmentalists argue that the standards under the CWA are not strong enough. Researchers have identified regions in the country that have weak enforcement of regulations and, therefore, are popular locations for CAFO developers looking to reduce cost and expand operations without strict government oversight.&lt;ref&gt;Weida, William J. (2002-01-21).[http://sraproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/theevidenceforpropertydevaluation.pdf "The Evidence for Property Devaluation Due To the Proximity to CAFOs."] Department of Economics, The Colorado College, Colorado Springs, CO.&lt;/ref&gt; Even when laws are enforced, there is the risk of environmental accidents. The massive 1995 manure spill in North Carolina highlights the reality that contamination can happen even when it is not done maliciously.&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Science, Technology and Public Policy (2007). [http://www.istpp.org/pdf/istpp_cafo.pdf “Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations: Assessment of Impacts on Health, Local Economics, and the Environment”]. Maharishi University of Management, Fairfeld, IA.&lt;/ref&gt; The question of whether such a spill could have been avoided is a contributing factor in the debate for policy reform.
[[File:Feedlot-1.jpg|thumb|301x301px|CAFO developers are drawn to states that poorly enforce EPA regulations.]]
Environmental groups have criticized the EPA's regulation of CAFOs on several specific grounds, including the following.&lt;ref name=autogenerated13&gt;Claudia Copeland, ''Animal Waste and Water Quality: EPA Regulation of Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations CAFO'', ''in'' WATER POLLUTION ISSUES AND DEVELOPMENTS 69 (Sarah V. Thomas, ed., 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Size threshold for "CAFO"'': Environmentalists favor reducing the size limits required to qualify as a CAFO; this would broaden the scope of the EPA's regulations on CAFOs to include more industry farming operations (currently classified as AFOs).
* ''Duty to apply'': Environmentalists strongly criticized the portion of the Court's ruling in ''Waterkeeper Alliance'' that deleted the EPA's 2003 rule that all CAFOs must apply for an NPDES permit. The EPA's revised permitted policy is now overly reactive, environmentalists maintain, because it "allow[s] CAFO operators to decide whether their situation poses enough risk of getting caught having a discharge to warrant the investment of time and resources in obtaining a permit."&lt;ref&gt;Natural Resources Defense Council, Sierra Club &amp; Waterkeeper Alliance, "Comments on the Revised CAFO Regulation" (Aug. 29, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that CAFOs have very little incentive to seek an NPDES permit under the new rule.&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Copeland, "Animal Waste and Water Quality: EPA's Response to the Waterkeeper Alliance Court Decision on Regulation of CAFOs," ''in'' WATER POLLUTION ISSUES AND DEVELOPMENTS 84 (Sarah V. Thomas, ed., 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Requirement for co-permitting entities that exercise "substantial operational control" over CAFOs'': Environmental groups unsuccessfully petitioned the EPA to require "co-permitting of both the farmer who raises the livestock and the large companies that actually own the animals and contract with farmers."&lt;ref name=autogenerated13 /&gt; This modification to EPA regulations would have made the corporations legally responsible for the waste produced on the farms with which they contract.
* ''Zero discharge requirement to groundwater when a direct hydrologic connection exists to surface water'': The EPA omitted a provision in its 2003 rule that would have held CAFOs to a zero discharge limit from the CAFO's production area to "ground water that has a direct hydrologic connection to surface water."&lt;ref name=autogenerated14&gt;Claudia Copeland, ''Animal Waste and Water Quality: EPA Regulation of Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations CAFO'', ''in'' WATER POLLUTION ISSUES AND DEVELOPMENTS 66 (Sarah V. Thomas, ed., 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Environmentalists criticized the EPA's decision to omit this provision on the basis that ground water is often a drinking source in rural areas, where most all CAFOs are located.
* ''Specific performance standards'': Environmentalists urged the EPA to phase out the use of lagoons (holding animal waste in pond-like structures) and sprayfields (spraying waste onto crops). Environmentalists argued that these techniques for dealing with animal waste were outmoded and present an "unacceptable risk to public health and the environment" due to their ability to pollute both surface and groundwater following "weather events, human error, and system failures."&lt;ref name=autogenerated14 /&gt; Environmentalists suggested that whenever manure is land applied that it should be injected into the soil (and not sprayed).
* ''Lack of regulation of air pollution'': The revisions to the EPA's rules under the CWA did not address air pollutants. Environmentalists maintain that the air pollutants from CAFOs—which include [[ammonia]], [[hydrogen sulfide]], [[methane]], [[volatile organic compounds]], and [[particulate matter]]—should be subject to EPA regulation.&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Copeland, ''Animal Waste and Water Quality: EPA Regulation of Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations CAFO'', ''in'' WATER POLLUTION ISSUES AND DEVELOPMENTS 67 (Sarah V. Thomas, ed., 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, industry groups criticize the EPA's rules as overly stringent. Industry groups vocally opposed the requirement in the 2008 rule (since struck down by the Fifth Circuit) that required CAFOs to seek a permit if they "propose to discharge" into waters of the United States.&lt;ref name=autogenerated19&gt;Claudia Copeland, "Animal Waste and Water Quality: EPA's Response to the Waterkeeper Alliance Court Decision on Regulation of CAFOs," ''in'' WATER POLLUTION ISSUES AND DEVELOPMENTS 84-85 (Sarah V. Thomas, ed., 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Generally speaking, the farm industry disputes the presumption that CAFOs do discharge pollutants and it therefore objects to the pressure that the EPA places on CAFOs to voluntarily seek an NPDES permit.&lt;ref name=autogenerated19 /&gt; As a starting point, farm industry groups "emphasize that most farmers are diligent stewards of the environment, since they depend on natural resources of the land, water, and air for their livelihoods and they, too, directly experience adverse impacts on water and air quality."&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Copeland, ''Animal Waste and Water Quality: EPA Regulation of Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations CAFO'', ''in'' WATER POLLUTION ISSUES AND DEVELOPMENTS 68 (Sarah V. Thomas, ed., 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the agricultural industry groups continue to maintain that the EPA should have no authority to regulate any of the runoff from land application areas because they believe this constitutes a nonpoint source that is outside the scope of the CWA.&lt;ref name=autogenerated13 /&gt; According to this viewpoint, voluntary programs adequately address any problems with excess manure.&lt;ref name=autogenerated13 /&gt;

== States' role and authority ==
The role of the federal government in environmental issues is generally to set national guidelines and the state governments’ role is to address specific issues. The framework of federal goals is as such that the responsibility to prevent, reduce, and eliminate pollution are the responsibility of the states.&lt;ref name=autogenerated15&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Centner | first1 = Terence | year = 2001| title = Evolving Policies to Regulate Pollution from Animal Feeding Operations | url = | journal = Environmental Management | volume = 28 | issue = 5| pages = 599–609 | doi=10.1007/s002670010246| pmid = 11568841 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The management of water and air standards follows this authoritative structure. States that have been authorized by the EPA to directly issue permits under NPDES (also known as "NPDES states"&lt;ref name="NPDES-state"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/npdes/npdes-state-program-information |title=NPDES State Program Information |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2018-08-20 |website=National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;) have received jurisdiction over CAFOs. As a result of this delegation of authority from the EPA, CAFO permitting procedures and standards may vary from state to state.

Specifically for water pollution, the federal government establishes federal standards for wastewater discharge and authorized states develop their own wastewater policies to fall in compliance. More specifically, what a state allows an individual CAFO to discharge must be as strict or stricter than the federal government's standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://dnr.mo.gov/pubs/pub2351.htm |title=Animal Feeding Operations and Permits in Missouri |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=June 2014 |series=Water Protection Program fact sheet |website=Division of Environmental Quality |publisher=Missouri Department of Natural Resources |location=Jefferson City, MO |id=Pub2351}}&lt;/ref&gt; This protection includes all waterways, whether or not the water body can safely sustain aquatic life or house public recreational activities. Higher standards are upheld in some cases of pristine publicly owned waterways, such as parks. They keep higher standards in order to maintain the pristine nature of the environment for preservation and recreation. Exceptions are in place for lower water quality standards in certain waterways if it is deemed economically significant.&lt;ref name=autogenerated15 /&gt; These policy patterns are significant when considering the role of state governments’ in CAFO permitting.

===State versus federal permit issuance===
Federal law requires CAFOs to obtain NPDES permits before wastewater may be discharged from the facility. The state agency responsible for approving permits for CAFOs in a given state is dependent on the authorization of that state. The permitting process is divided into two main methods based on a state’s authorization status. As of 2018, EPA has authorized 47 states to issue NPDES permits. Although they have their own state-specific permitting standards, permitting requirements in authorized states must be at least as stringent as the federal standards.&lt;ref name=autogenerated25/&gt;{{rp|13}} In the remaining states and territories, an EPA regional office issues NPDES permits.&lt;ref name="NPDES-state"/&gt;

===Permitting process===
A state’s authority and the state’s environmental regulatory framework will determine the permit process and the state offices involved. Below are two examples of states’ permitting organization.

====Authorized state case study: Arizona====
[[File:Blank Map of Arizona.svg|thumb|210x210px|The state of Arizona requires CAFOs to obtain two permits.]]
[[Arizona]] issues permits through a general permitting process. CAFOs must obtain both a general Arizona Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (AZPDES) Permit and a general Aquifer Protection Permit.&lt;ref name=autogenerated16&gt;[http://www.azdeq.gov/environ/water/permits/cafo.html ADEQ: Water Quality Division: Permits: Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation Program (CAFO)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Arizona state agency tasked with managing permitting is the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ).

For the Aquifer Protection Permit, CAFOs are automatically permitted if they comply with the state’s BMP outlined in the relevant state rule, listed on the ADEQ’s website. Their compliance is evaluated through agency CAFO Inspection Program’s onsite inspections. If a facility is found to be unlawfully discharging, then the agency may issue warnings and, if necessary, file suit against the facility. For the AZPDES permit, CAFOs are required to submit a Notice of Intent to the ADEQ. In addition, they must complete and submit a Nutrient Management Plan (NMP) for the state’s annual report.&lt;ref name=autogenerated16 /&gt;

Even in an authorized state, the EPA maintains oversight of state permitting programs. This would be most likely to happen in the event that a complaint is filed with the EPA by a third party. For instance, in 2008, Illinois Citizens for Clean Air &amp; Water filed a complaint with the EPA arguing that the state was not properly implementing its CAFO permitting program. The EPA responded with an "informal" investigation. In a [https://web.archive.org/web/20110206033144/http://www.epa.gov/region5/illinoiscafo/iepa_cafo-report.pdf report] released in 2010, the agency sided with the environmental organization and provided a list of recommendations and required action for the state to meet.

====Unauthorized state case study: Massachusetts====
In unauthorized states, the EPA has the authority for issuing NPDES permits. In these states, such as Massachusetts, CAFOs communicate and file required documentation through an EPA regional office. In Massachusetts, the EPA issues a general permit for the entire state. The state’s Department of Agricultural Resources (MDAR) has an agreement with the EPA for the implementation of CAFO rules. MDAR’s major responsibility is educational. The agency assists operators in determining if their facility qualifies as a CAFO. Specifically they do onsite evaluations of facilities, provide advice on best practices, and provide information and technical assistance.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;[http://www.nmenv.state.nm.us/swqb/CAFO/#Q3 Environment Department&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

If a state has additional state specific rules for water quality standards, the state government maintains the authority for permitting. For instance, New Mexico, also unauthorized, requires CAFOs and AFOs to obtain a Groundwater Permit if the facilities discharge waste in a manner that might affect local groundwater. The EPA is not involved in the issuing of this state permit.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; Massachusetts, however, does not have additional state permit requirements.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;

==Zoning ordinances==
State planning laws and local [[zoning ordinances]] represent the main policy tools for regulating land use. Many states have adopted legislation that specifically exempt CAFOs (and other agricultural entities) from zoning regulations.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10&gt;Frank R. Spellmen &amp; Nancy E. Whiting, ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT OF CONCENTRATED ANIMAL FEEDING OPERATIONS (CAFOS) 47 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; The promulgation of so-called [[Right-to-farm laws|"right to farm" statutes]] have provided, in some instances, a shield from liability for CAFOs (and other potential nuisances in agricultural).&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt; More specifically, the right-to-farm statutes seek to "limit the circumstances under which agricultural operations can be deemed [[nuisance]]s."
[[File:Concentrated animal feeding operation, Missouri (2).JPG|thumb|Some states have zoning laws that regulate where CAFOs are located.]]
The history of these agricultural exemptions dates back to the 1950s. Right-to-farm statutes expanded in the 1970s when state legislatures became increasingly sensitive to the loss of rural farmland to urban expansion.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;Frank R. Spellmen &amp; Nancy E. Whiting, ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT OF CONCENTRATED ANIMAL FEEDING OPERATIONS (CAFOS) 48 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; The statutes were enacted at a time when CAFOs and "modern confinement operations did not factor into legislator's perceptions of the beneficiaries of [the] generosity" of such statutes.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt; Forty-three (43) states now have some sort of statutory protection for farmers from nuisance. Some of these states (such as Iowa, Oklahoma, Wyoming, Tennessee, and Kansas) also provide specific protection to animal feeding operations (AFOs) and CAFOs.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt; Right-to-farm statutes vary in form. Some states, for instance, require agricultural operation be located "within an acknowledged and approved agricultural district" in order to receive protection; other states do not.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;

Opponents of CAFOs have challenged right-to-farm statutes in court, and the [[constitutionality]] of such statutes is not entirely clear. The [[Iowa Supreme Court]], for instance, struck down a right-to-farm statute as a "[[taking]]" (in violation of the 5th and 14th Amendments of the U.S. Constitution) because the statute stripped neighboring landowners of property rights without compensation.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g., Bormann v.

==Regulation under the Clean Air Act==
CAFOs are potentially subject to regulation under the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] (CAA), but the emissions from CAFOs generally do not exceed established statutory thresholds.&lt;ref name=autogenerated24&gt;Dustin Till, Marten Law. [http://www.martenlaw.com/newsletter/20110427-afo-air-emissions-regulations "Environmental Groups Press for Federal Regulation of Air Emissions from Animal Feeding Operations"].&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the EPA's regulations do not provide a clear methodology for measuring emissions from CAFOs, which has "vexed both regulators and the industry."&lt;ref&gt;Dustin Till, Marten Law. [http://www.martenlaw.com/newsletter/20110427-afo-air-emissions-regulations "Environmental Groups Press for Federal Regulation of Air Emissions from Animal Feeding Operations".]&lt;/ref&gt; Negotiations between the EPA and the agricultural industry did, however, result in an Air Compliance Agreement in January 2005.&lt;ref name=autogenerated24 /&gt; According to the agreement, certain animal feeding operations (AFOs) received a covenant not to sue from the EPA in exchange for payment of a civil penalty for past violations of the CAA and an agreement to allow their facilities to be monitored for a study on air pollution emissions in the agricultural sector.&lt;ref name=autogenerated24 /&gt; Results and analysis of the EPA's study are scheduled to be released later in 2011.&lt;ref name=autogenerated24 /&gt;

Environmental groups have formally proposed to tighten EPA regulation of air pollution from CAFOs. A coalition of environmental groups petitioned the EPA on April 6, 2011 to designate ammonia as a "[[criteria pollutant]]" and establish National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ammonia from CAFOs.&lt;ref name=autogenerated24 /&gt; The petition alleges that "CAFOs are leading contributors to the nation’s ammonia inventory; by one EPA estimate livestock account for approximately 80 percent of total emissions. CAFOs also emit a disproportionately large share of the ammonia in certain states and communities.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environmentalintegrity.org/04_06_2011.php ''Environmental Integrity Project, et. al. v. Jackson'', Petition for the Regulation of Ammonia as a Criteria Pollutant Under Clean Air Act Sections 108 and 109]&lt;/ref&gt; If the EPA adopts the petition, CAFOs and other sources of ammonia would be subject to the permitting requirements of the CAA.

{{Evolutionary biology}}

'''Convergent evolution''' is the independent [[evolution]] of similar features in species of different lineages. Convergent evolution creates '''analogous structures''' that have similar form or function but were not present in the last common ancestor of those groups. The [[cladistic]] term for the same phenomenon is [[Cladogram#Measuring homoplasy|homoplasy]]. The [[recurrent evolution]] of flight is a classic example, as flying [[insect]]s, [[bird]]s, [[pterosaurs]], and [[bat]]s have independently evolved the useful capacity of flight. Functionally similar features that have arisen through convergent evolution are ''analogous'', whereas ''[[homology (biology)|homologous]]'' structures or traits have a common origin but can have dissimilar functions.  Bird, bat, and pterosaur [[wings]] are analogous structures, but their forelimbs are homologous, sharing an ancestral state despite serving different functions.

The opposite of convergence is [[divergent evolution]], where related species evolve different traits. Convergent evolution is similar to [[parallel evolution]], which occurs when two independent species evolve in the same direction and thus independently acquire similar characteristics; for instance, [[flying frog|gliding frog]]s have evolved in parallel from multiple types of [[tree frog]].

Many instances of convergent evolution are known in [[plant]]s, including the repeated development of [[C4 photosynthesis|C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; photosynthesis]], [[seed dispersal]] by fleshy [[fruit]]s adapted to be eaten by animals, and [[carnivorous plant|carnivory]].

==Overview==
[[File:Analogous &amp; Homologous Structures.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|[[Homology (biology)|Homology]] and analogy in mammals and insects: on the horizontal axis, the structures are homologous in morphology, but different in function due to differences in habitat. On the vertical axis, the structures are analogous in function due to similar lifestyles but anatomically different with different [[phylogeny]].{{efn|However, [[evolutionary developmental biology]] has identified [[deep homology]] between insect and mammal body plans, to the surprise of many biologists.}}]]
{{further|List of examples of convergent evolution}}

In morphology, analogous traits arise when different species live in similar ways and/or a similar environment, and so face the same environmental factors. When occupying similar [[ecological niche]]s (that is, a distinctive way of life) similar problems can lead to similar solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kirk|first=John Thomas Osmond|title=Science &amp; Certainty|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kTr5BTxMpFYC&amp;pg=PA79|year=2007|publisher=Csiro Publishing|isbn=978-0-643-09391-1|page=79 |quote=evolutionary convergence, which, quoting ..

In biochemistry, physical and chemical constraints on [[enzyme mechanism|mechanisms]] have caused some [[active site]] arrangements such as the [[catalytic triad]] to evolve independently in separate [[enzyme superfamilies]].&lt;ref name="Buller&amp;Townsend_2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Buller |first=A.

In his 1989 book ''[[Wonderful Life (book)|Wonderful Life]]'', [[Stephen Jay Gould]] argued that if one could "rewind the tape of life [and] the same conditions were encountered again, evolution could take a very different course".&lt;ref name="wonderfullife"&gt;{{cite book| title=[[Wonderful Life (book)|Wonderful Life]]: The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History| author=Gould, S.J.| authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould| year=1989| publisher=W.W. Norton |pages=282–285 |isbn=978-0-09-174271-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Simon Conway Morris]] disputes this conclusion, arguing that convergence is a dominant force in evolution, and given that the same environmental and physical constraints are at work, life will inevitably evolve toward an "optimum" body plan, and at some point, evolution is bound to stumble upon intelligence, a trait presently identified with at least [[primates]], [[corvids]], and [[cetaceans]].&lt;ref name=SCM2005/&gt;

== Distinctions ==

===Cladistics===
In [[cladistics]], a homoplasy is a trait shared by two or more [[Taxon|taxa]] for any reason other than that they share a common ancestry. Taxa which do share ancestry are part of the same [[clade]]; cladistics seeks to arrange them according to their degree of relatedness to describe their [[phylogeny]]. Homoplastic traits caused by convergence are therefore, from the point of view of cladistics, confounding factors which could lead to an incorrect analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Chirat | first1=R. | last2=Moulton | first2=D.

===Atavism===
{{main|Atavism}}

In some cases, it is difficult to tell whether a trait has been lost and then re-evolved convergently, or whether a gene has simply been switched off and then re-enabled later. Such a re-emerged trait is called an [[atavism]]. From a mathematical standpoint, an unused gene ([[genetic drift|selectively neutral]]) has a steadily decreasing [[probability]] of retaining potential functionality over time. The time scale of this process varies greatly in different phylogenies; in mammals and birds, there is a reasonable probability of remaining in the genome in a potentially functional state for around 6 million years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1=Collin | first1=R.| last2=Cipriani | first2=R.| year=2003| title=Dollo's law and the re-evolution of shell coiling| journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B| volume=270 | issue=1533 | pages=2551–2555| doi=10.1098/rspb.2003.2517| pmc=1691546| pmid=14728776}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parallel vs. convergent evolution===

[[File:Evolutionary trends.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Evolution at an [[amino acid]] position. In each case, the left-hand species changes from having alanine (A) at a specific position in a protein in a hypothetical ancestor, and now has serine (S) there. The right-hand species may undergo [[divergent evolution|divergent]], parallel, or convergent evolution at this amino acid position relative to the first species.]]

When two species are similar in a particular character, evolution is defined as parallel if the ancestors were also similar, and convergent if they were not.{{efn|However, all organisms share a common ancestor more or less recently, so the question of how far back to look in evolutionary time and how similar the ancestors need to be for one to consider parallel evolution to have taken place is not entirely resolved within evolutionary biology.}} Some scientists have argued that there is a continuum between parallel and convergent evolution, while others maintain that despite some overlap, there are still important distinctions between the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arendt |first=J |author2=Reznick, D |title=Convergence and parallelism reconsidered: what have we learned about the genetics of adaptation?|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|date=January 2008|volume=23|issue=1 |pages=26–32 |doi=10.1016/j.tree.2007.09.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pearce |first=T. |title=Convergence and Parallelism in Evolution: A Neo-Gouldian Account |journal=The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science |date=10 November 2011 |volume=63 |issue=2 |pages=429–448 |doi=10.1093/bjps/axr046}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zhang"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Zhang | first1=J. | last2=Kumar | first2=S. | year=1997 | title=Detection of convergent and parallel evolution at the amino acid sequence level | journal=Mol. Biol. Evol. | volume=14 | issue=5| pages=527–36 | doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a025789| pmid=9159930 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the ancestral forms are unspecified or unknown, or the range of traits considered is not clearly specified, the distinction between parallel and convergent evolution becomes more subjective.  For instance, the striking example of similar placental and marsupial forms is described by [[Richard Dawkins]] in ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'' as a case of convergent evolution, because mammals on each continent had a long evolutionary history prior to the extinction of the dinosaurs under which to accumulate relevant differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Dawkins| first=Richard| authorlink=Richard Dawkins| year= 1986| title=[[The Blind Watchmaker]]| publisher=W. W. Norton | isbn=0-393-31570-3| pages=100–106|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==At molecular level==
[[File:Triad convergence ser cys.svg|thumb|400px|Evolutionary convergence of [[serine protease|serine]] and [[cysteine protease]] towards the same catalytic triads organisation of acid-base-nucleophile in different [[protein superfamily|protease superfamilies]]. Shown are the triads of [[subtilisin]], [[prolyl oligopeptidase]], [[TEV protease]], and [[papain]].]]

===Protease active sites===
{{main| catalytic triad}}
The [[enzymology]] of [[proteases]] provides some of the clearest examples of convergent evolution. These examples reflect the intrinsic chemical constraints on enzymes, leading evolution to converge on equivalent solutions independently and repeatedly.&lt;ref name="Buller&amp;Townsend_2013"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dodson |first=G. |author2=Wlodawer, A. |title=Catalytic triads and their relatives |journal=Trends in Biochemical Sciences |date=September 1998 |volume=23 |issue=9 |pages=347–52 |pmid=9787641 |doi=10.1016/S0968-0004(98)01254-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Serine and cysteine proteases use different amino acid functional groups (alcohol or thiol) as a [[nucleophile]]. In order to activate that nucleophile, they orient an acidic and a basic residue in a [[catalytic triad]]. The chemical and physical constraints on [[enzyme catalysis]] have caused identical triad arrangements to evolve independently more than 20 times in different [[enzyme superfamilies]].&lt;ref name="Buller&amp;Townsend_2013"/&gt;

[[Threonine protease]]s use the amino acid threonine as their catalytic [[nucleophile]]. Unlike cysteine and serine, threonine is a [[secondary alcohol]] (i.e. has a methyl group). The methyl group of threonine greatly restricts the possible orientations of triad and substrate, as the methyl clashes with either the enzyme backbone or the histidine base. Consequently, most threonine proteases use an N-terminal threonine in order to avoid such [[steric clash]]es.
Several evolutionarily independent [[enzyme superfamilies]] with different [[protein fold]]s use the N-terminal residue as a nucleophile. This commonality of [[active site]] but difference of protein fold indicates that the active site evolved convergently in those families.&lt;ref name="Buller&amp;Townsend_2013"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ekici|first=O.

One of the best-known examples of convergent evolution is the camera eye of [[Cephalopod eye|cephalopods]] (such as squid and octopus), [[vertebrate]]s (including mammals) and [[cnidaria]] (such as jellyfish).&lt;ref name="Kozmik2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kozmik|first=Z |author2=Ruzickova, J |author3=Jonasova, K |author4=Matsumoto, Y. |author5=Vopalensky, P. |author6=Kozmikova, I. |author7=Strnad, H. |author8=Kawamura, S. |author9=Piatigorsky, J. |author10=Paces, V. |author11=Vlcek, C. |title=From the Cover: Assembly of the cnidarian camera-type eye from vertebrate-like components|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |date=1 July 2008 |volume=105|issue=26 |pages=8989–8993|doi=10.1073/pnas.0800388105|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/105/26/8989.full |accessdate=2013-05-03 |pmid=18577593 |pmc=2449352 |bibcode=2008PNAS..105.8989K }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their last common ancestor had at most a simple photoreceptive spot, but a range of processes led to the [[evolution of the eye|progressive refinement of camera eyes]] — with one sharp difference: the cephalopod eye is "wired" in the opposite direction, with blood and nerve vessels entering from the back of the retina, rather than the front as in vertebrates. As a result, cephalopods lack a [[Blind spot (vision)|blind spot]].&lt;ref name=SCM2005/&gt;

===Flight===
[[File:Homology.jpg|thumb|upright|Vertebrate wings are partly [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] (from forelimbs), but analogous as organs of flight in (1) [[pterosaurs]], (2) [[bat]]s, (3) [[birds]], evolved separately.]]
{{further|Flying and gliding animals#Evolution and ecology of aerial locomotion}}

[[Birds]] and [[bat]]s have [[homology (biology)|homologous]] limbs because they are both ultimately derived from terrestrial [[tetrapod]]s, but their flight mechanisms are only analogous, so their wings are examples of functional convergence. The two groups have powered flight, evolved independently.  Their wings differ substantially in construction. The bat wing is a membrane stretched across four extremely elongated fingers and the legs. The airfoil of the bird wing is made of [[feather]]s, strongly attached to the forearm (the ulna) and the highly fused bones of the wrist and hand (the [[carpometacarpus]]), with only tiny remnants of two fingers remaining, each anchoring a single feather. So, while the wings of bats and birds are functionally convergent, they are not anatomically convergent.&lt;ref name=BerkeleyHomologyAnalogy&gt;{{cite web |title=Homologies and analogies |url=http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evo_09 |publisher=University of California Berkeley |accessdate=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Plant and Animal Evolution |url=http://sci.waikato.ac.nz/evolution/Homology.shtml |publisher=University of Waikato |accessdate=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Birds and bats also share a high concentration of [[cerebroside]]s in the skin of their wings. This improves skin flexibility, a trait useful for flying animals; other mammals have a far lower concentration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ben-Hamo |first=Miriam|last2=Muñoz-Garcia |first2=Agustí |last3=Larrain |first3=Paloma |last4=Pinshow |first4=Berry |last5=Korine |first5=Carmi |last6=Williams |first6=Joseph B.|date=June 2016 |title=The cutaneous lipid composition of bat wing and tail membranes: a case of convergent evolution with birds |url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/283/1833/20160636 |journal=Proc.

[[Flying squirrel]]s and [[sugar glider]]s are much alike in their body plans, with gliding wings stretched between their limbs, but flying squirrels are placental mammals while sugar gliders are marsupials, widely separated within the mammal lineage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Analogy: Squirrels and Sugar Gliders |url=http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/analogy_02 |publisher=University of California Berkeley |accessdate=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insect mouthparts===
Insect mouthparts show many examples of convergent evolution. The mouthparts of different insect groups consist of a set of [[homology (biology)|homologous]] organs, specialised for the dietary intake of that insect group. Convergent evolution of many groups of insects led from original biting-chewing mouthparts to different, more specialised, derived function types. These include, for example, the [[proboscis]] of flower-visiting insects such as [[bee]]s and [[flower beetle]]s,&lt;ref name="Krenn-2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Krenn |first1=Harald W. |last2=Plant |first2=John D. |last3=Szucsich |first3=Nikolaus U. |year=2005 |title=Mouthparts of flower-visiting insects |journal=Arthropod Structure &amp; Development |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=1–40 |doi=10.1016/j.asd.2004.10.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Krenn-2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bauder |first1=Julia A.S. |last2=Lieskonig |first2=Nora R. |last3=Krenn |first3=Harald W. |year=2011 |title=The extremely long-tongued Neotropical butterfly Eurybia lycisca (Riodinidae): Proboscis morphology and flower handling |journal=Arthropod Structure &amp; Development |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=122–7 |doi=10.1016/j.asd.2010.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Krenn-2012-1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wilhelmi |first1=Andreas P. |last2=Krenn |first2=Harald W. |year=2012 |title=Elongated mouthparts of nectar-feeding Meloidae (Coleoptera) |journal=Zoomorphology |volume=131 |issue=4 |pages=325–37 |doi=10.1007/s00435-012-0162-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the biting-sucking mouthparts of blood-sucking insects such as [[flea]]s and [[mosquito]]s.

===Opposable thumbs===
[[Opposable thumb]]s allowing the grasping of objects are most often associated with [[primates]], like humans, monkeys, apes, and lemurs. Opposable thumbs also evolved in [[giant pandas]], but these are completely different in structure, having six fingers including the thumb, which develops from a wrist bone entirely separately from other fingers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=When is a thumb a thumb?|url=http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/analogy_06|website=Understanding Evolution|accessdate=2015-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Convergent evolution in humans includes blue eye colour and light skin colour. When humans migrated [[Out of Africa hypothesis|out of Africa]], they moved to more northern latitudes with less intense sunlight. It was beneficial to them to reduce their [[human skin color|skin pigmentation]]. It appears certain that there was some lightening of skin colour ''before'' European and East Asian lineages diverged, as there are some skin-lightening genetic differences that are common to both groups. However, after the lineages diverged and became genetically isolated, the skin of both groups lightened more, and that additional lightening was due to ''different'' genetic changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Edwards |first1=M.| display-authors=etal |title=Association of the OCA2 Polymorphism His615Arg with Melanin Content in East Asian Populations: Further Evidence of Convergent Evolution of Skin Pigmentation |journal=PLOS Genetics |date=2010 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000867 |volume=6 |issue=3|pages=e1000867 |pmid=20221248 |pmc=2832666}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

[[Lemurs]] and [[humans]] are both primates. Ancestral primates had brown eyes, as most primates do today. The genetic basis of blue eyes in humans has been studied in detail and much is known about it. It is not the case that one gene locus is responsible, say with brown dominant to blue [[eye colour]]. However, a single locus is responsible for about 80% of the variation. In lemurs, the differences between blue and brown eyes are not completely known, but the same gene locus is not involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Meyer |first1=W.

===Carbon fixation===

While convergent evolution is often illustrated with animal examples, it has often occurred in [[plant]] evolution. For instance, [[C4 photosynthesis|C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; photosynthesis]], one of the three major carbon-fixing biochemical processes, has [[Evolutionary history of plants#Evolution of photosynthetic pathways|arisen independently up to 40 times]].&lt;ref name="williamsjohnston"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Williams, B.

===Fruits===

A good example of convergence in plants is the evolution of edible [[fruit]]s such as [[apple]]s. These [[pome]]s incorporate (five) [[carpel]]s and their accessory tissues forming the apple's core, surrounded by structures from outside the botanical fruit, the [[receptacle (botany)|receptacle]] or [[hypanthium]]. Other edible fruits include other plant tissues;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ireland |first1=Hilary, S. | display-authors=etal |title=Apple SEPALLATA1/2 -like genes control fruit flesh development and ripening|journal=The Plant Journal |date=2013 |volume=73 |issue=6 |pages=1044–1056 |doi=10.1111/tpj.12094 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tpj.12094/pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, the fleshy part of a [[tomato]] is the walls of the [[pericarp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Heuvelink |first=Ep |title=Tomatoes |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qwMnnepN3uIC&amp;pg=PA72 |year=2005 |publisher=CABI |isbn=978-1-84593-149-0 |page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; This implies convergent evolution under selective pressure, in this case the competition for seed dispersal by animals through consumption of fleshy fruits.&lt;ref name="evolution_seed"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lorts, C.; Briggeman, T.; Sang, T. |title=Evolution of fruit types and seed dispersal: A phylogenetic and ecological snapshot &lt;!--http://www.sciencemeta.com/index.php/JSE/article/view/1580606--&gt; |journal=Journal of Systematics and Evolution |volume=46 |issue=3 |pages=396–404 |year=2008 |url=http://www.plantsystematics.com/qikan/manage/wenzhang/jse08039.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130718025713/http://www.plantsystematics.com/qikan/manage/wenzhang/jse08039.pdf |archivedate=2013-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seed dispersal by ants ([[myrmecochory]]) has evolved independently more than 100 times, and is present in more than 11,000 plant species. It is one of the most dramatic examples of convergent evolution in biology.&lt;ref name="myrmecochory"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lengyel, S. |author2=Gove, A. D. |author3=Latimer, A.

=== Carnivory ===
[[File:Chitinase4TC.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5&lt;!--fmt for low image--&gt;|Molecular convergence in [[carnivorous plant]]s]]

[[Carnivory]] has evolved multiple times independently in plants in widely separated groups. In three species studied, ''[[Cephalotus|Cephalotus follicularis]]'', ''[[Nepenthes alata]]'' and ''[[Sarracenia purpurea]]'', there has been convergence at the molecular level. Carnivorous plants secrete [[enzymes]] into the digestive fluid they produce. By studying [[Purple acid phosphatases|phosphatase]], [[Glycoside hydrolase family 19|glycoside hydrolase]], [[glucanase]],  [[RNASET2|RNAse]] and [[chitinase]] [[enzyme]]s as well as a [[pathogenesis-related protein]] and a [[thaumatin]]-related protein,  the authors found many convergent [[amino acid]] substitutions. These changes were not at the enzymes' catalytic sites, but rather on the exposed surfaces of the proteins, where they might interact with other components of the cell or the digestive fluid. The authors also found that [[homologous gene]]s in the non-carnivorous plant ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' tend to have their expression increased when the plant is stressed, leading the authors to suggest that stress-responsive proteins have often been co-opted{{efn|The prior existence of suitable structures has been called [[pre-adaptation]] or [[exaptation]].}} in the repeated evolution of carnivory.&lt;ref name=Fukushima2017&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fukushima |first1=K |last2=Fang |first2=X |display-authors=etal |title=Genome of the pitcher plant Cephalotus reveals genetic changes associated with carnivory |journal=Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution |date=2017 |volume=1 |issue=3 |doi=10.1038/s41559-016-0059 |doi-access=free |page=0059}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of inference==

Phylogenetic reconstruction and [[Ancestral reconstruction|ancestral state reconstruction]] proceed by assuming that evolution has occurred without convergence. Convergent patterns may, however, appear at higher levels in a phylogenetic reconstruction, and are sometimes explicitly sought by investigators. The methods applied to infer convergent evolution depend on whether pattern-based or process-based convergence is expected. Pattern-based convergence is the broader term, for when two or more lineages independently evolve patterns of similar traits. Process-based convergence is when the convergence is due to similar forces of [[natural selection]].&lt;ref name="Stayton2"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Stayton |first=C. Tristan |date=2015 |title=The definition, recognition, and interpretation of convergent evolution, and two new measures for quantifying and assessing the significance of convergence |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/evo.12729/abstract |journal=Evolution |volume=69 |issue=8 |pages=2140–2153 |doi=10.1111/evo.12729}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pattern-based measures ===
Earlier methods for measuring convergence incorporate ratios of phenotypic and [[phylogenetic]] distance by simulating evolution with a [[Brownian motion]] model of trait evolution along a phylogeny.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stayton |first=C. Tristan|title=Is convergence surprising?

Stasis occurs when there is little evolutionary change among taxa.&lt;ref name="Stayton2" /&gt;

Distance-based measures assess the degree of similarity between lineages over time. Frequency-based measures assess the number of lineages that have evolved in a particular trait space.&lt;ref name="Stayton2" /&gt;

=== Process-based measures ===

Methods to infer process-based convergence fit models of selection to a phylogeny and continuous trait data to determine whether the same selective forces have acted upon lineages. This uses the [[Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process|Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process]] to test different scenarios of selection. Other methods rely on an ''[[A priori knowledge|a priori]]'' specification of where shifts in selection have occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ingram |first=Travis |last2=Mahler |first2=D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4014">'''Cuneiform law''' refers to any of the [[legal code]]s written in [[cuneiform script]], that were developed and used throughout the ancient [[Middle East]] among the [[Sumer]]ians, [[Babylonia]]ns, [[Assyria]]ns, [[Elam]]ites, [[Hurrians]], [[Kassites]], and [[Hittites]].&lt;ref name="Cuneiform law - Encyclopedia.com"&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1B1-362024.html Cuneiform law - Encyclopedia.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Code of Hammurabi]] is the most well-known of the cuneiform laws, but there were a number of precursor laws.&lt;ref name="Cuneiform law - Encyclopedia.com"/&gt;

==Features==
Although they were written in several different cities and [[Monarchy|kingdom]]s, these early [[law]]s have a number of formulae in common. Most contain both an epilogue and a prologue, which usually explain the purpose of composing the laws, invoke divine authority, and command the reader to abide by them. They are always imposed or 'enacted' in the name of a ruler, be it a prince or king, and show no sign of being the result of legislative bodies.

While many of these [[code]]s are only partially known, they nevertheless paint a fairly clear picture that enables us to learn what issues pertaining to rules were considered significant by the societies they governed in the 3rd, 2nd, and 1st [[millennia]] [[Before Christ|BC]].

Unlike modern codes, Cuneiform law provides no universal [[formula]] for general areas of law. Rather, laws typically consist of specific "if... then..." cases that are meant to act as an example or precedent. [[Punishment]]s for crimes vary from code to code, but not all prescribe vengeance. Some call only for fines in certain instances, such as in the [[Code of Ur-Nammu]], where one line reads: "If a man knocks out the eye of another man, he shall weigh out one-half a mina of [[silver]]."  These cases are sometimes arranged in a seemingly random order, though this may be the result of an inability to properly interpret them today as they would have been at the time they were in force.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9028210 Cuneiform law - Britannica Online Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuneiform law is generally classified separately from later [[Middle East]]ern law,&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt; but has been viewed as a predecessor of Biblical and [[Jewish law]]. The communities of the Middle East that made use of cuneiform law were generally all in contact with one another, and developed similar cultures. [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], a cuneiform language, was used throughout the entire area, and even as far as Egypt, for diplomatic communications during the [[Amarna Period]].

==Timeline==
* c. 2350 BC - Reforms of [[Urukagina]] of [[Lagash]] - not extant, but referenced in other sources.
* c. 2060 BC - [[Code of Ur-Nammu]] (or Shulgi?) of [[Ur]] - [[Neo-Sumerian]] (Ur-III). Earliest code of which fragments have been discovered. The code speaks of witchcraft and the flight of slaves.
* c. 1934-1924 BC - Code of [[Lipit-Ishtar]] of [[Isin]] - With a typical epilogue and prologue, the law deals with penalties, the rights of ordinary people, right of kings, marriages, and more.
* c. 1800 BC - [[Laws of Eshnunna|Laws of the city of Eshnunna]] (sometimes ascribed to king Bilalama)
* c. 1758 BC - [[Code of Hammurabi]] - The most famous, and also the most preserved of the ancient laws. Discovered in December 1901, it contains over 282 paragraphs of text, not including the prologue and epilogue.
* c. 1500-1300 BC - [[Assyrian law]]
* c. 1500-1400 BC - [[Hittite laws]]&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt;

[[File:PAX6 Phenotypes Washington etal PLoSBiol e1000247.png|right|400px|thumb|''[[pax6]]'' alterations result in similar phenotypic alterations of eye morphology and function across a wide range of species.]]

In [[evolutionary developmental biology]],  the concept of '''deep homology''' is used to describe cases where [[Cell growth|growth]] and [[Cellular differentiation|differentiation]] processes are governed by genetic mechanisms that are [[Homology (biology)#Homology of sequences in genetics|homologous]] and deeply [[Conserved sequence|conserved]] across a wide range of [[species]].

==History==
{{further|Evolutionary developmental biology}}

In 1822, the French zoologist [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] dissected a [[crayfish]], discovering that its body is organised like a vertebrate's, but [[Inversion (evolutionary biology)|inverted belly to back (dorsoventrally)]]:&lt;ref name=Held2&gt;{{cite book |last1=Held |first1=Lewis I. |authorlink=Lewis Held |title=Deep Homology?: Uncanny Similarities of Humans and Flies Uncovered by Evo-Devo |date=February 2017 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1316601211 |pages=2–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I just found that all the soft organs, that is to say, the principal organs of life are found in crustaceans, and so in insects, in the same order, in the same relationships and with the same arrangement as their analogues in the high vertebrate animals ... What was my surprise, and I may add, my admiration, seeing [such] a rule ...&lt;ref name=Held2/&gt;}}

[[File:Genes hox.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Homology (biology)|Homologous]] [[hox gene|''hox'' genes]] in such different animals as [[insect]]s and [[vertebrate]]s control [[embryogenesis|embryonic development]] and hence the [[Morphology (biology)|form]] of adult bodies. These genes have been [[conserved sequence|highly conserved]] through hundreds of millions of years of [[evolution]].]]

Geoffroy's homology theory was denounced by the leading French zoologist of his day, [[Georges Cuvier]], but in 1994, Geoffroy was shown to be correct.&lt;ref name=Held2/&gt; In 1915, [[Santiago Ramon y Cajal]] mapped the neural connections of the optic lobes of a fly, finding that these resembled those of vertebrates.&lt;ref name=Held2/&gt; In 1978, [[Edward B. Lewis]] helped to found [[evolutionary developmental biology]], discovering that [[homeosis|homeotic genes]] regulated embryonic development in fruit flies.&lt;ref name=Held2/&gt;

In 1997, the term deep homology first appeared in a paper by [[Neil Shubin]], Cliff Tabin, and [[Sean B. Carroll]], describing the apparent relatedness in genetic regulatory apparatuses which indicated evolutionary similarities in disparate animal features.&lt;ref name="Shubin Tabin Carroll 1997"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Shubin | first=Neil | last2=Tabin | first2=Cliff | last3=Carroll | first3=Sean | title=Fossils, genes and the evolution of animal limbs | journal=Nature | publisher=Springer Nature | volume=388 | issue=6643 | year=1997 | doi=10.1038/41710 | pages=639–648 | url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e9fd/04bdfae57145375564321602c405bb0cbaa4.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==A different kind of homology==

Whereas ordinary [[homology (biology)|homology]] is seen in the pattern of structures such as limb bones of mammals that are evidently related, deep homology can apply to groups of animals that have quite dissimilar anatomy: vertebrates (with [[endoskeleton]]s made of [[bone]] and [[cartilage]]) and arthropods (with [[exoskeleton]]s made of [[chitin]]) nevertheless have limbs that are constructed using similar recipes or "algorithms".&lt;ref name="Shubin Tabin Carroll 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Carroll66&gt;{{cite book |last=Carroll |first=Sean B. |authorlink=Sean B. Carroll |title=Endless Forms Most Beautiful |titlelink=Endless Forms Most Beautiful (book) |date=2006 |publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson |isbn=0-297-85094-6 |pages=28, 66–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Homologous Pathways of Development |chapterurl=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bookshelf/br.fcgi?book=dbio&amp;part=A5439 |author=Gilbert, Scott F. |authorlink=Scott F. Gilbert |title=Developmental biology |publisher=Sinauer Associates |location=Sunderland, Mass |year=2000 |pages= |isbn=0-87893-243-7 |edition=6th |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bookshelf/br.fcgi?book=dbio}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Held |first1=Lewis I. |authorlink=Lewis Held |title=Deep Homology?: Uncanny Similarities of Humans and Flies Uncovered by Evo-Devo |date=February 2017 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1316601211 |pages=viii and throughout}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the [[metazoa]], [[homeotic gene]]s control differentiation along major [[body axis|body axes]], and [[pax genes]] (especially [[PAX6]]) help to control the development of the [[eye]] and other [[sensory organ]]s. The deep homology applies across widely separated groups, such as in the eyes of [[mammals]] and the structurally quite different [[compound eye]]s of [[insects]].&lt;ref name=Carroll66/&gt;

Similarly, [[hox gene]]s help to form an animal's segmentation pattern. HoxA and HoxD, that regulate finger and toe formation in mice, control the development of [[Actinopterygii|ray fins]] in [[zebrafish]]; these structures had until then been considered non-homologous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/18/science/from-fins-into-hands-scientists-discover-a-deep-evolutionary-link.html |title=From Fins Into Hands: Scientists Discover a Deep Evolutionary Link |last=Zimmer |first=Carl |authorlink=Carl Zimmer|date=2016-08-17 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a possible deep homology among animals that use acoustic communication, such as songbirds and humans, which may share unmutated versions of the [[FOXP2]] gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |title=Evo-Devo, Deep Homology and FoxP2: Implications for the Evolution of Speech and Language |author1=Scharff, Petri |author2=Constance, Jane |journal=Philos.

==Algorithm==

In 2010, a team led by [[Edward Marcotte]] developed an [[algorithm]] that identifies deeply homologous genetic modules in unicellular organisms, plants, and animals based on [[phenotype]]s (such as traits and developmental defects). The technique aligns phenotypes across organisms based on [[Homology (biology)#Orthology|orthology]] (a type of homology) of genes involved in the phenotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Zimmer, Carl |authorlink=Carl Zimmer |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/27/science/27gene.html?hp=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=The Search for Genes Leads to Unexpected Places |work=The New York Times |date=April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McGary2010"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=McGary, K.

'''Democrates''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ɪ|ˈ|m|ɒ|k|r|ə|ˌ|t|iː|z}}; {{lang-grc|Δημοκράτης}}) was a [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] philosopher about whom little is known. [[Apollonius of Tyana]] wrote at least one letter to a Democrates, ''Epistle 88''.

A collection of moral [[Maxim (philosophy)|maxims]], called the ''Golden Sentences'' ({{lang|grc|γνῶμαι χρυσαῖ}}) has come down to us under his name. However, many scholars argue that these maxims all originate from an original collection of sayings of [[Democritus]],&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge History of Greek and Roman Political Thought
edited by Christopher Rowe, Malcolm Schofield, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=kN0cTYSVD1kC&amp;pg=PT283&amp;lpg=PT283&amp;dq=democritus+democrates&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5OKyM2qGXk&amp;sig=YzXj9lDRF93fMHUp5FoW7Dzt4vY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjF2vXH4tTWAhVk9YMKHdqAC14Q6AEInAEwGg#v=onepage&amp;q=democritus%20democrates&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; though others believe that there was a different little-known Democrates whose name became confused with the much better-known Democritus.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, C., ''The Atomists, Leucippus and Democritus: Fragments: a Text and Translation''. Page 224–225. University of Toronto Press. (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

The maxims are written in the [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]] dialect, from which some scholars have inferred, that they were written at a very early period. Others think it more probable that they are the production of the age of Julius Caesar. But nothing can be said with certainty, for want of both external and internal evidence. Some of these sentences are quoted by [[Stobaeus]], and are found in some manuscripts under the name of Democritus.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11930">'''Dickinson Sargeant Miller''' (October 7, 1868 &amp;ndash; November 13, 1963) worked with many world-renowned philosophers, including [[William James]], [[George Santayana]], [[John Dewey]], [[Edmund Husserl]], and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]].&lt;ref&gt;Loyd Easton, ''Dickinson Miller: Philosophical Analysis and Human Welfare", Reidel, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Miller received the A.B. degree in 1889 under George Fullerton at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. He studied psychology under [[G. Stanley Hall]] at [[Clark University]] for a year, and then went to [[Harvard]] where he was a graduate student under [[William James]], G. H. Palmer, [[Josiah Royce]], and Santayana. He received the A.M. from Harvard in 1892.&lt;ref&gt;Loyd Easton, ''Dickinson Miller: Philosophical Analysis and Human Welfare", p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

He then spent a year in Germany studying at Berlin and Halle under [[Max Dessoir]], [[Hermann Ebbinghaus]], and [[Friedrich Paulsen]], earning his Ph.D. with a dissertation on ''Das Wesen der Erkenntnis und des Irrthums'', which was published as "The Meaning of Truth and Error" in ''The Philosophical Review'' in 1893.&lt;ref&gt;Easton, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

This article led James to abandon Royce's solution of the knowledge problem in terms of an absolute mind. James recommended Miller to a post at [[Bryn Mawr College]] in 1893, where he was a close friend of [[Woodrow Wilson]].&lt;ref&gt;Easton, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1899, Miller became a strong critic of James's famous arguments in ''The Will to Believe'' that the beneficial effects of a belief somehow increased its "truth."  His critical article was "The Will to Believe and the Duty to Doubt."&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Barton Perry, ''The Thought and Character of William James'', vol. 2, p.240&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller left Bryn Mawr that year to become an instructor of philosophy at Harvard, where he had a strong and productive collaboration with James.&lt;ref&gt;Easton, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; James referred to Miller as "my most penetrating critic and intimate enemy." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationphilosopher.com/solutions/philosophers/hobart/ "R. E. Hobart" on Information Philosopher]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1904, Miller left Harvard to be a lecturer in philosophy at Columbia and professor in 1911. There he worked with [[Arthur O. Lovejoy]] and John Dewey.&lt;ref&gt;Easton, p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller retired from academic work after two years at Smith College (1926-26) and went into a "European retirement." &lt;ref&gt;Easton, p.21&lt;/ref&gt; He visited Rome at first and then alternated between Florence and Vienna, where he made contact with the "Vienna Circle" of philosophers, including [[Moritz Schlick]], [[Otto Neurath]], [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Herbert Feigl]], and others.

Miller challenged a basic principle of the Circle that "no sentence can be admitted to philosophical thought as having a meaning unless it is verifiable in experience." Such a principle, he argued "cuts the ground from under its own feet" because a sentence has to already have meaning before you can apply the test.&lt;ref&gt;Easton, p.22&lt;/ref&gt;

In Vienna he met with [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] who was then loosely associated with the Vienna Circle.

==Free will as involving determination==
In 1934, as Miller left to return for America, he published a landmark article in ''Mind'' under the pseudonym [[R. E. Hobart]],.&lt;ref&gt;R. E. Hobart, Free Will as Involving Determination and Inconceivable Without It" ''Mind'', Vol XLIII, No. 169, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

He analyzed the relationship between "could" and "can" in the sense of choosing to do otherwise in the same circumstances and he claimed that the controversy of free will ''versus'' determinism was a waste of energy over a false antithesis. At least some determinism is not a problem for free will but a feature.&lt;ref&gt;Easton, p.23&lt;/ref&gt;

The article was titled "Free Will as Involving Determination and Inconceivable Without It," but it is widely misquoted as "Involving [[Determinism]]." His biographer, Loyd Easton, correctly describes it as "an acute example of 'soft determinism' or 'reconciliationism'."&lt;ref&gt;Easton, p.23&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem of "determinism" ''versus'' free will that [[William James]] was concerned about was the strict causal determines that is better called [[predeterminism]] where every event is determined in a causal chain back to the beginning of time, and there is "but one possible future," as James put it.&lt;ref&gt;James, William. 1884. The Dilemma of Determinism, Unitarian Review, vol.XXII, p.193. Reprinted in The Will to Believe, Dover Publications, 1956, p.145&lt;/ref&gt;

Far from "reconciling" free will with this kind of determinism, as [[David Hume]] said that he had done in his "reconciling project,",&lt;ref&gt;David Hume, ''An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding'', VIII, 1, §72&lt;/ref&gt; James proposed the first two-stage model of free will that denies [[predeterminism]] and accepts absolute [[Chance (philosophy)|chance]] as necessary for the generation of [[Alternative Possibilities|alternative possibilities]], which are the source of "ambiguous futures" selected by the determination, but not predetermination, of the will.&lt;ref&gt;Bob Doyle, "Jamesian Free Will: The Two-Stage Model of William James," ''William James Studies'', April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller/Hobart dissents from James's new idea about free will, constructing a distinctive  reconciling compatibilism that dispenses with any requirement for chance in the analysis of what persons' abilities to perform alternate acts.  Rather than analyzing causality as Hume did, Hobart focuses on moral evaluation of acts and character.

==The ''Mind'' article&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://philpapers.org/archive/HOBFWA.pdf|title = Free Will as Involving Determination and Inconceivable Without It|date = 24 March 2015|accessdate = 24 March 2015 |website = Free Will as Involving Determination and Inconceivable Without It|publisher = |last = Hobart|first = R.E.|type = PDF|orig-year = 1934|publication-date = January 1934}}&lt;/ref&gt;==
Writing about six years after the discovery of [[quantum indeterminacy]], Hobart explicitly does not endorse strict logical or physical [[determinism]], and he explicitly does endorse the existence of [[Alternative Possibilities|alternative possibilities]], i.e., that we can do otherwise in the same circumstances.  Hobart does not, however, attribute those possibilities to absolute chance.

He says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    I am not maintaining that determinism is true; only that it is true in so far as we have free will.  ... it is not here affirmed that there are no small exceptions, no slight undetermined swervings, no ingredient of absolute chance. All that is here said is that such absence of determination, if and so far as it exists, is no gain to freedom, but sheer loss of it&lt;ref&gt;''Mind'', Vol XLIII, No. 169, January, 1934, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    "We say," I can will this or I can will that, whichever I choose ". Two courses of action present themselves to my mind. I think of their consequences, I look on this picture and on that, one of them commends itself more than the other, and I will an act that brings it about. I knew that I could choose either. That means that I had the power to choose either.&lt;ref&gt;''Mind'', p.8&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
We can contrast Hobart with William James's claim that there are ambiguous futures. The  second paragraph is not inconsistent with the two-stage model of free will - first "free" courses of action present themselves, then an adequately determined "will" chooses between them, in a temporal sequence.  However, the first paragraph denies that any randomness in the decision process, including the presentation of options, adds to freedom.

Hobart refers to [[G. E. Moore]]'s idea that one could have done otherwise - "if" one had chosen otherwise. But Hobart views the "if" as redundant, and therefore licenses the claim that we could have done otherwise, full stop.
&lt;blockquote&gt;

    Thus it is true, after the act of will, that I could have willed otherwise. It is most natural to add, "if I had wanted to"; but the addition is not required. The point is the meaning of "could". I could have willed whichever way I pleased. I had the power to will otherwise, there was nothing to prevent my doing so, and I should have done so if I had wanted.&lt;ref&gt;''Mind'', p.9&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hobart finds fault with the indeterminist's position, but he gives the typical overstatement by a determinist critic, that any chance will be the direct cause of our actions, which of course would clearly be a loss of freedom and responsibility

&lt;blockquote&gt;
    Indeterminism maintains that we need not be impelled to action by our wishes, that our active will need not be determined by them. Motives "incline without necessitating". We choose amongst the ideas of action before us, but need not choose solely according to the attraction of desire, in however wide a sense that word is used. Our inmost self may rise up in its autonomy and moral dignity, independently of motives, and register its sovereign decree.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

    Now, in so far as this "interposition of the self" is undetermined, the act is not its act, it does not issue from any concrete continuing self; it is born at the moment, of nothing, hence it expresses no quality; it bursts into being from no source. (p.6)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    In proportion as an act of volition starts of itself without cause it is exactly, so far as the freedom of the individual is concerned, as if it had been thrown into his mind from without — "suggested" to him — by a freakish demon. It is exactly like it in this respect, that in neither case does the volition arise from what the man is, cares for or feels allegiance to; it does not come out of him. In proportion as it is undetermined, it is just as if his legs should suddenly spring up and carry him off where he did not prefer to go. Far from constituting freedom, that would mean, in the exact measure in which it took place, the loss of freedom.&lt;ref&gt;''Mind'', p.7&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Possibly Hobart has William James in mind as "the indeterminist." However, the only inderminist philosopher named in the article is Eddington. James would not have denied that our will is an act of determination, consistent with, and in some sense "caused by" our character and values, our habits, and our current feelings and desires. He simply wanted chance to provide alternative possibilities for actions and a break in the causal chain of [[strict determinism (philosophy)|strict determinism]].

Hobart sees no need for such chance, and no addition to freedom to be had by it. The freedom we take ourselves to have is fully consistent with thorough-going determinism regarding human action.
&lt;blockquote&gt;

    In daily life we are all determinists, just as we are all libertarians. We are constantly attributing behaviour to the character, the temperament, the peculiarities of the person and expecting him to behave in certain fashions. The very words of our daily converse, as we have so amply observed, are full of determinism. And we see nothing inconsistent in being aware at the same time that he is free in choosing his course, as we know ourselves to be.&lt;ref&gt;''Mind'', p.21&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Ebenezer Cooke''' (1837-1913) was an art master and pioneer in [[art education]].

An apprenticed [[lithographic]] [[draughtsman]], he was introduced by his brother to the lectures of [[Frederick Denison Maurice]] at the Hall of Association, 34 Castle Street East, London, in 1853 and the summer of 1854. When the [[Working Men's College|Working Men’s College]] was formed in 1854, he attended [[John Ruskin]]’s first drawing classes.  After an unsuccessful partnership with John Fotheringham, also a student at the college, he gave up his trade and then took to teaching though the influence of Ruskin. He succeeded Ruskin as a Drawing Master at the College, and taught at other London establishments.&lt;ref name=Harrison&gt;[[J. F. C. Harrison]] ,''A History of the Working Men's College (1854-1954)'', Routledge Kegan Paul, 1954&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1850s and 1860s Cooke was influenced by [[Herbert Spencer]], and became a student of [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi|Pestalozzi]], developing an enthusiasm for the Pestalozzian and [[Friedrich Fröbel|Froebellian]] methods in which he became an influential interpreter. With Thomas Ablett, [[Alexander Bain]], and psychologist [[James Sully]], he furthered art education thinking; Sully and Cooke were a particular influence on each other.

He served on the Council of the Education Society (founded 1875) which later became Society for the Development of the Science of Education. In 1885 Cooke published an analysis of children’s drawings that became a great influence on teachers and researchers, and in 1894 published an English edition of Pestalozzi's ''How Gertrude Teaches Her Children''. In 1904 he sat on the Committee of the Third International Congress for the Development of Drawing and Art Teaching.

[[Vanessa Bell]] began her art education under the tutelage of Cooke.

'''Edward F. Mooney''' (born 1941) is a noted [[Kierkegaard]] scholar and was Professor of Religion and Philosophy through 2013 at [[Syracuse University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/41349-excursions-with-kierkegaard-others-goods-death-and-final-faith/ A review of Excursions with Kierkegaard: Others, Goods, Death, and Final Faith]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/234235.Edward_F_Mooney About Mooney]&lt;/ref&gt;
He received his B.A. in philosophy from [[Oberlin College]] (1962) and his M.A. and Ph.D. from [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] (1968). His dissertation, written under Herbert Fingarette, linked studies of philosophical themes in literature [ Dostoevsky, The Book of Job] with the turn toward persons in the work of Austin, P. F. Strawson and Iris Murdoch. Mooney was a Professor of Philosophy at Sonoma State University from 1975 until 2002. While there he published books on Kierkegaard and several smaller studies. He then migrated to Syracuse University where his writing expanded to include studies of American Philosophy (Cavell, Bugbee, Wilshire, Thoreau, and others). He was President of the North American Kierkegaard Society for several years, in which capacity he lectured in Vilnia, Frankfurt, Reykjavik, Jerusalem, Ber-Shiva, Tel Aviv, Dartmouth, Johns Hopkins, Auburn, and elsewhere. He became Professor Emeritus at Syracuse in 2013 and during 2013-2015 was a visiting professor at Tel-Aviv and at Hebrew University, Jerusalem, teaching seminars in American Studies on Thoreau. 
Mooney presently resides and teaches in Portland, Maine. He was a regular contributor to the interdisciplinary on-line journal Zeteo. His writing exemplifies the intersections among philosophy, religion, and poetry. One finds the clarity of Anglophone ordinary language philosophy joined to issues native to existential philosophy and religion. In recent years he has turned to Melville as exemplifying an informal and episodic conversationally developed philosophy well-suited to literary exposition and wisdom, embodying what Cavell calls "passionate speech." His work has appeared in Japanese, Portuguese, French, Hebrew, and Spanish translation.

{{More footnotes|date=August 2009}} 
The '''essential facilities doctrine''' (sometimes also referred to as the '''essential facility doctrine''') is a [[legal doctrine]] which describes a particular type of claim of [[monopolization]] made under [[competition law]]s.  In general, it refers to a type of [[anti-competitive behavior]] in which a firm with [[market power]] uses a "[[Bottleneck (logistics)|bottleneck]]" in a market to deny competitors entry into the market.  It is closely related to a claim for [[refusal to deal]].

The doctrine has its origins in [[United States law]], but it has been adopted (often with some modification) into the legal systems of [[Law of the United Kingdom|the United Kingdom]], [[Law of Australia|Australia]], [[Law of South Africa|South Africa]], and the [[Law of the European Union|European Union]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

==Overview==
Under the essential facilities doctrine, a [[monopoly|monopolist]] found to own "a facility essential to other competitors" is required to provide reasonable use of that facility, unless some aspect of it precludes shared access.&lt;ref&gt;Abbott B. Lipsky, Jr. &amp; J. Gregory Sidak, [https://www.criterioneconomics.com/docs/essential_facilities1.pdf ''Essential Facilities''], 51 {{smallcaps|Stan. L. Rev.}} 1187, 1190–91 (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; The basic elements of a [[Claim (legal)|legal claim]] under this doctrine under [[United States antitrust law]], which a [[plaintiff]] is required to show to establish liability, are:

#control of the essential facility by a monopolist
#a competitor’s inability to practically or reasonably duplicate the essential facility
#the denial of the use of the facility to a competitor; and
#the feasibility of providing the facility to competitors

The [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]]'s ruling in ''[[Verizon Communications v. Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko, LLP|Verizon v. Trinko]]'', 540 U.S. 398 (2004), in effect added a fifth element:  absence of regulatory oversight from an agency (the [[Federal Communications Commission]], in that case) with power to compel access.

These elements are difficult for potential plaintiffs to establish for several reasons.  It is quite difficult for a plaintiff to demonstrate that a particular facility is "essential" to entry into and/or competition within the [[relevant market]].  The plaintiff must demonstrate that the "facility" must be something so indispensable to entry or competition that it would be impossible for smaller firms to compete with the market leader.  Likewise, the plaintiff must show that compelling the [[Dominance (economics)|dominant firm]] to permit others to use the facility would not interfere with the ability of the dominant firm to serve its own customers.

==Development==
The first notable case to address the anti-competitive implications of an essential facility was the Supreme Court's judgment in ''[[United States v. Terminal Railroad Association]]'', 224 U.S. 383 (1912).&lt;ref&gt;Abbott B. Lipsky, Jr. &amp; J. Gregory Sidak, [https://www.criterioneconomics.com/docs/essential_facilities1.pdf ''Essential Facilities''], 51 Stan. L. Rev.]] 1187, 1189–91 (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;  A group of railroads controlling all railway bridges and switching yards into and out of [[St. Louis]] prevented competing railway companies from offering transportation to and through that destination. The court held it to be an illegal restraint of trade.&lt;ref&gt;224 U.S. 383 (1912), at 409-10&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar decisions include,
* ''[[Associated Press v. United States]]'', 326 U.S. 1 (1945), in which the Supreme Court found that the [[Associated Press]] bylaws which limited membership and therefore access to copyrighted news services violated the Sherman Act.
* In ''[[Lorain Journal Co. v. United States]]'', 342 U.S. 143, 146-49 (1951), ''[[The Lorain Journal]]'' was the only local business doing news and advertisements in town. The case was that refusing to place an ad for the customers of a small radio station was a Sherman Act violation. In the end, the court accepted an offer to simply accept the advertisements.
* ''[[Otter Tail Power Co. v. United States]]'', 410 U.S. 366, 377-79 (1973), in which the Supreme Court found that [[Otter Tail Corporation|Otter Tail]], an electrical utility which sold electricity at both directly to consumers and to municipalities who resold to consumers, violated the Sherman Act by refusing to supply electricity at wholesale, instead serving customers directly itself.
* ''[[Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp.]]'', 427 U.S. 585 (1985), upholding the  ''Lorain Journal'' decision in holding that Aspen Skiing violated § 2 of the [[Sherman Act]] by refusing to honor vouchers and [[ski lift]] tickets after it had previously done so.
* ''[[Otter Tail Power Co. v. United States#Hecht case|Hecht v. Pro Football]]'' where potential American Football League franchise did not show they needed Washington's [[RFK Stadium]], the essential facilities doctrine was not met.

==Application of the doctrine==
There is controversy about what exactly constitutes an "essential facility".  While the doctrine has most frequently been applied to [[Natural monopoly|natural monopolies]] such as [[Public utility|utilities]] and owners of transportation facilities, it has also been applied{{Specify|date=May 2012}} in situations involving [[intellectual property]].  For example, it is possible for a court to apply the doctrine in a case where one competitor refuses to sell materials protected by [[copyright]] or [[patent]] to potential competitors.

[[Leigh Van Valen]] was an evolutionary biologist that was notable for writing a multitude of scientific papers – roughly 300 over the course of his lifetime. Some of his most important theories included the [[Red Queen hypothesis]] which had been rejected by many respectable journals of the time. Van Valen began and published the [[peer reviewed journal]] : ''Evolutionary theory'' with its first issue in July 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Easton|first1=John|title=Leigh Van Valen, evolutionary theorist and paleobiology pioneer, 1935-2010|url=https://news.uchicago.edu/article/2010/10/19/leigh-van-valen-evolutionary-theorist-and-paleobiology-pioneer-1935-2010|website=UChicago News|publisher=University of Chicago|language=en|date=20 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==About ''Evolutionary Theory''==

The very first article in ''Evolutionary Theory'' was written by Van Valen and titled “A New Evolutionary Law” – notably his most famous paper where he states his Red Queen Hypothesis. He also introduced what would become known as Van Valen’s law in this very same paper. The original name – law of constant extinction – states that “the probability of extinction for species and larger evolutionary groups bears no relation to how long it may have already existed”. He also contended that “The [[fossil record]] shows that lineages become neither more extinction-resistant nor more vulnerable over time”. 
One of the journals that originally rejected Van Valen’s article, [[Nature (journal) ]], recognized the importance of his work by confirming his work with several follow-up studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Easton|first1=John|title=Leigh Van Valen, evolutionary theorist and paleobiology pioneer, 1935-2010|url=https://news.uchicago.edu/article/2010/10/19/leigh-van-valen-evolutionary-theorist-and-paleobiology-pioneer-1935-2010|website=UChicago News|publisher=University of Chicago|language=en|date=20 October 2010}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
''Evolutionary Theory'' is copyrighted by the [[University of Chicago]] where Van Valen managed the journal.

Over the course of the journal 325 publications were made with 64 of those belonging to Van Valen.

==Philosophy ==

''Evolutionary theory'' aimed for low cost and fast publication, compared to most journals where from start to finish publishing could be a very lengthy process. The journal branded itself as an “international journal of fact and interpretation”. The title cover also states that it is dedicated to the primacy of content over display, which also had a part in the low cost and rapid publication.&lt;ref name="Evolutionary Theory"&gt;{{cite web|title=Evolutionary Theory|url=http://leighvanvalen.com/evolutionary-theory/|publisher=Leigh Van Valen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal itself in some ways was atypical as it allowed purely description papers, but reserved the right to reject more routine theoretical work. While there is no page minimum or maximum, ''Evolutionary Theory'' shied away from excessive wordiness, and in general was very welcoming to unconventional papers. Van Valen aimed to move away from discriminatory restrictions on page lengths, along with the fact that many journals had mandatory page charges, thus one of many reasons for long publication times during that era. ''Evolutionary Theory'' did not have a mandatory charge but maintained that a voluntary charge of $12.00 per page would be of assistance. The journal even went to state that the charge “cannot be expected of those without institutional or grant funds “, however partial charges were accepted. Each volume contained roughly 300 to 400 pages in total.
''Evolutionary theory'' is “not a substitute for others”. Thus, further solidifying that it was one of the more unconventional journals of its time. Van Valen even went so far as to state that the more “acceptable" a work is the less original it is- most certainly a quip at other major journals of the time.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Topics Covered==

''Evolutionary theory'' covered a wide variety of topics within [[evolution]] and [[biology]].

"The evolutionary half of biology: that part of biology where the center of interest is on organisms and populations, i.e., on the phenotype and its various interrelations rather than on molecules and cells for their own sake. This includes, but is not restricted to, [[ecology]], [[paleontology]], [[population genetics]], plant and animal systematics, [[molecular evolution]], comparative physiology and behavior, [[anatomy]], biological philosophy and history (at the professional level, not meanderings), comparative cytology, [[anthropology]], developmental patterns, and [[biogeography]]".&lt;ref name="Evolutionary Theory"/&gt;

In addition to traditional publications, speculations and critical discussion of book, papers or ideas were strongly welcomed. Papers that disagree with the editor’s view were also more likely to be published than those that agreed. Another item that promoted the rapid spread of ideas was that the journal would also publish abstracts of unpublished papers that had not yet been rejected.

All articles were published in English, however for articles that were not originally in English, a copy of the abstract in the native language could remain.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Van Valen|first1=Leigh|title=Evolutionary Theory|journal=Evolutionary Theory|date=1973|volume=1|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key dates==

First volume published: July 1973-December 1976

Final volume published: October 1999- to October 2003 
Most volumes spanned roughly three years, however after volume nine the length varied from as little as one year-up until five.

==Personnel==

Editors:

-Leigh Van Valen, Department of Ecology &amp; Evolution, University of Chicago

-Melissa Stoller, Department of Ecology &amp; Evolution, University of Chicago

Managing Editors:

-Virginia C. Maiorana, Department of Ecology &amp; Evolution, University of Chicago

In addition to the founding and creating of the journal, Van Valen also served as its editor up until its final publication in 2003.
 
The editorial board consisted of several notable individuals as well as several major institutions from all over the world, the number of individuals/ institutions listed varied from as much as 66 to 78 members over the course of the journal.

==Cost==

''Evolutionary Theory'' stressed low cost publication which can be reflected in its pricing. In 1973 – on the first issue the price for the individual journal was $4.00. Subscriptions were also offered and varied in price depending on several factors. The price for institutions in Latin America, Asia, Eastern Europe and Africa were priced at $6.00, everywhere else was listed as $15.00. Individual subscriptions were offered at a rate of $10.00, or $6.00 if the individual had an income of less than $10,000.

Prices in the final issue of the journal were as followed: per year for institutions in Latin America, Asia, Eastern Europe and Africa were priced at $9.00, where everywhere else was $29.00. Individual subscriptions were $26.00, and those with an income under $15000 could have a subscription for a rate of $16.00 per year.

The journal also was non-profit which caused small fluctuations in the price.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

''Evolutionary Theory'' was previously available online, however as of March 2017 is no longer on Van Valen's website.

[[File:Hüon und Amande by Sophie Seyler.png|thumb|Original cover of ''[[Hüon und Amande]]'' by Friederike Sophie Seyler (1789)]]

'''Friederike Sophie Seyler''' or '''F.S. Seyler''', formerly '''Friederike Sophie Hensel''' (1737 or 1738, [[Dresden]] – 22 November 1789, [[Schleswig]], née Sparmann; also referred to as ''Sophie Friederike''), was a German [[actress]], [[playwright]] and [[librettist]]. Alongside [[Friederike Caroline Neuber]], she was widely considered Germany's greatest actress of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Susanne Kord (1993). "Tugend im Rampenlicht: Friederike Sophie Hensel als Schauspielerin und Dramatikerin" [Virtue in the Limelight: Friederike Sophie Hensel as actress and playwright]. ''[[The German Quarterly]]'', 66(1):1–19.&lt;/ref&gt; Her libretto for the Singspiel ''[[Oberon (Seyler)|Oberon]]'' (originally titled ''Huon and Amanda'') was a major inspiration for [[Emanuel Schikaneder]]'s libretto for the opera ''[[The Magic Flute]]''. She was briefly married to the actor Johann Gottlieb Hensel and then married the famous theatre director [[Abel Seyler]]. As an actress, she was known for portraying passionate and tragic characters. She was a member of [[Konrad Ernst Ackermann]]'s troupe and performed at the Vienna [[Burgtheater]], before joining the [[Hamburgische Entreprise]] and the travelling [[Seyler Theatre Company]]. [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] lauded her as one of Europe's finest actresses in his influential work ''[[Hamburg Dramaturgy]]''.

==Work==
She wrote several plays, including ''Die Entführung oder die zärtliche Mutter'', which was much acted in the 1770s. She also wrote a libretto for a ''[[Singspiel]]'' based on the poem ''[[Oberon (poem)|Oberon]]'', titled ''[[Hüon und Amande]]'', that became a great success in Hamburg. Her libretto was since re-adapted by [[Karl Ludwig Giesecke]] to provide a libretto for [[Paul Wranitzky]], but without crediting her. Wranitzky's version became the first opera performed by [[Emanuel Schikaneder]]'s troupe at their new theater, that established a tradition within the company of fairy tale operas that was to culminate later in Mozart's and Schikaneder's opera ''[[The Magic Flute]]''. ''Oberon'' as written by Sophie Seyler and built upon by Giesecke is similar to ''The Magic Flute'' in its plot and characters, and a number of the singers who participated in Giesecke/Wranitzky's Oberon took similar roles in the later opera. According to [[Peter Branscombe]], "it has long been recognized that Giesecke, the named author of Wranitzky's libretto, deserves little credit for what is largely a plagiarism," concluding that "Giesecke's "''Oberon, König der Elfen'' is hardly more than a mild revision of Seyler's book." After the theatrical success of Giesecke's plagiarized version (and also after Seyler's death), Seyler's original was renamed ''Oberon'' and performed under this title.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Branscombe]], ''W. A. Mozart: Die Zauberflöte'', Cambridge University Press, 1991, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

While she was regarded as Germany's most prominent living actress, she also had a reputation for being unusually conceited and difficult to work with.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jan Philipp Reemtsma]], ''Lessing in Hamburg: 1766-1770'', C.H.Beck, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Richard E. Schade describes her as "a beautiful, if rather solidly built and domineering leading lady."&lt;ref&gt;Lessing Yearbook XII, 1980 p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Phyllis Hartnoll]], "even Lessing, who detested her, had to admit she was a fine actress. In private life she was malicious and intriguing, her character contributing to the downfall of the Hamburg enterprise."&lt;ref&gt;[[Phyllis Hartnoll]], ''The Oxford companion to the theatre'', p. 386, [[Oxford University Press]], 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{Main|Seyler family}}

[[File:Abel Seyler silhouette - Basel.svg|thumb|[[Abel Seyler]], Sophie Seyler's second husband]]
She was born in Dresden as the only child of the doctor Johann Wilhelm Sparmann, and was the granddaughter of court architect [[Matthäus Daniel Pöppelmann]], who built [[Zwinger (Dresden)|Zwinger]]. Yet, she came from a broken home and fled from an arranged marriage. She joined the theatre in 1754.&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Kosch, "Seyler, Friederike Sophie", in ''[[Dictionary of German Biography]]'', eds. Walther Killy and Rudolf Vierhaus, Vol. 9, Walter de Gruyter, 2005, {{ISBN|3110966298}}, p. 308&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1754, she married actor Johann Gottlieb Hensel, but they divorced already in 1759. In 1772, she married her great love and admirer, the Swiss-born theatre director [[Abel Seyler]], after a long-standing romance. He had been the main backer of the [[Hamburgische Entreprise]] and was the founder of the [[Seyler theatrical company]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Schlenther: [http://de.wikisource.org/wiki/ADB:Seyler,_Abel Abel Seyler]. In: ''[[Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie]]'' (ADB). Band 34, Duncker &amp; Humblot, Leipzig 1892, S. 778–782.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her step son was the banker [[Ludwig Erdwin Seyler]], the head of [[Berenberg Bank]] who married into the [[Berenberg-Gossler-Seyler banking dynasty|Berenberg/Gossler banking dynasty]]. Her step daughter Sophie (Marie Katharina) Seyler (1762–1833) was married to the prominent [[Sturm und Drang]] poet [[Johann Anton Leisewitz]].

==Early life==
Botting was born in Oakley House near [[Royal Air Force]] Station Abingdon ([[RAF Abingdon]]) at [[Frilford]] Heath near [[Oxford]], [[England]] on 19 July 1943. He was christened in the Church of England Parish Church of St. James the Great in [[Radley]], Berkshire. His father, [[Pilot Officer]] Norman Arthur Botting [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|DFC]], a [[Operation Chastise|Dam Buster]] with [[617 Squadron]], was killed in action over Germany on 15 September 1943 when Gary was less than two months old—on his older sister Mavis' second birthday. Following the war, their mother Joan, a teacher, took up residence with Group Captain [[Leonard Cheshire]] [[Victoria Cross|VC]], the father of their younger sister, Elizabeth, at Gumley Hall near Bedford Gardens, [[Market Harborough]], [[Leicestershire]]&lt;ref&gt;''The Face of Victory'' (London: Hutchinson, 1961) p. 69; Richard Morris, ''Cheshire: The Biography of Leonard Cheshire, VC, OM'' (London: Viking, 2000), pp. 237–240&lt;/ref&gt; and later she and the children moved with Cheshire to LeCourt, the name of the mansion he had acquired from his aunt in [[Hampshire]].&lt;ref&gt;Morris (2000), pp. 242–260&lt;/ref&gt; After witnessing the bombing of [[Nagasaki]] at the end of World War II, Cheshire, who had been raised high Anglican, began to examine various religions.&lt;ref&gt;''The Face of Victory'', pp. 104–110&lt;/ref&gt; Joan and he agreed about the nature of God as a person.&lt;ref&gt;''The Face of Victory,'' pp. 47, 55–56; Russell Braddon ''Cheshire V.C.'' (London: Evans, 1954) p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; Joan was baptized as a Jehovah's Witness in September 1948 and expected Cheshire to follow; when he converted to Roman Catholicism later that year instead, she moved with the children back to Radley.&lt;ref&gt;''The Face of Victory'', pp. 57–58, 95–98, 148–151&lt;/ref&gt;

Botting attended the Church of England Primary School in Radley. One day when pedaling back from school he found a large [[sphinx moth]], "a rare and portentous Death's-Head Hawk (''[[Acherontia atropos]]'')" at the side of the road.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Botting, "Preface", Heather and Gary Botting, ''The Orwellian World of Jehovah's Witnesses'' (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1984), p. xii&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in [[Cambridge]], he began collecting moths in earnest.&lt;ref&gt;"Gary's Open Window Way to Science Prize", ''[[Toronto Telegram]]'', 2 May 1960, page 1&lt;/ref&gt; On Elizabeth's eighth birthday, 8 January 1954, the Botting family arrived in Fort Erie, Ontario as immigrants to Canada.&lt;ref name="ABCBookworld"/&gt;

==Entomology==
In his early teens Botting began to experiment at home with the hybridization of moths, developing his own technique entailing surgical transplantation of female pheromonal scent sacs.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Botting, "Preface" to ''The Orwellian World'', p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt; Exhibits of his hybrid moths won top honours at the Ontario (Canada) and United States National Science Fairs two years in a row—in 1960 for "Interesting Variations of the Cynthia Silk Moth", and in 1961 for "Intergeneric Hybridization Among Giant Silk Moths".&lt;ref&gt;"City Student Earns Praise for Work in Studying, Breeding Silk Moths", ''Peterborough Examiner'', 2 May 1960; "Gary's Open Window Way to Science Prize", ''Toronto Telegram'', 2 May 1960, page 1; "Ontario Boy Wins Top Spot in Science Fair", ''Toronto Telegram'', 13 May 1960; "Science Fair Winners", ''Science Newsletter'', 28 May 1960; "Bright Youth Brighter Today", ''Weekend Magazine'', Vol. 10, No. 40, 1960&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, he cross-bred the North American [[Polyphemus moth]] (then called ''Telea polyphemus'') with Japanese and Indian giant silk moths of the genus ''[[Antheraea]]'', pointing out that the Polyphemus moth really belonged to that genus.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Botting, "Intergeneric hybridization among giant silk moths", Exhibit, U.S. National Science Fair—International, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; The Polyphemus moth was subsequently renamed ''[[Antheraea polyphemus]]'' to accord with his observations.

In the summer of 1960 he was sponsored by the [[American Institute of Biological Sciences]] on a lecture tour of the US to explicate his experiments.&lt;ref&gt;"Moths Wing Lad to Oklahoma", ''Toronto Telegram'', 16 June 1960; "Student to be Guest of U.S. Institute", ''Globe and Mail'', 16 June 1960; "PCVS student receives fresh recognition", ''Peterborough Examiner'', 2 September 1960&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year the US [[National Academy of Sciences]] sponsored him on a lecture tour of India.&lt;ref&gt;"Young Expert on Moths Invited to India Talks", ''Toronto Telegram'', 29 December 1960; "Boy Collector: Moths Win Gary World Trip", ''Evening News'', 29 December 1960; "Young City Moth Expert Flies to India", ''Peterborough Examiner'', 30 December 1960; "Noted U.S. Scientists Address Roorkee Meeting", ''[[American Reporter]]'', 11 January 1961; "Biology Students in India", ''The American Biology Teacher,'' Vol. 23 No. 6 (October 1961) p. 364; {{jstor|4439623}} {{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jSo_AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=YFAMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2774,1043733|title=Moths Going to India|work=The Windsor Star|date=1960-10-22|accessdate=2013-01-12}}; "Moth Expert, 17, invited to India", ''[[Winnipeg Free Press]]'' (Tuesday 25 October 1960)&lt;/ref&gt; While in India in January 1961, Botting was befriended by [[J. B. S. Haldane]], who decades earlier had applied statistical research to the natural selection of moths.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/classictexts/haldane2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, Haldane's wife, [[Helen Spurway]], was also researching the genetics of giant silk moths of the genus ''Antheraea''. Helen Spurway, J.B.S. and Krishna Dronamraju were present at the Oberoi Grand Hotel in Kolkata when 1960 US National Science Fair winner in botany Susan Brown reminded the Haldanes that she and Botting had a previously scheduled event that would prevent them from accepting an invitation to a banquet proposed by J.B.S. and Helen in their honour and scheduled for that evening. After the two students had left the hotel, Haldane went on his much-publicized hunger strike to protest what he regarded as a "U.S. insult".&lt;ref&gt;"Haldane on Fast: Insult by USIS Alleged", ''[[The Times of India]]'', 19 January 1961; "Protest Fast by Haldane: USIS' 'Anti-Indian Activities'", ''The Times of India'', 18 January 1961; "Situation was Misunderstood, Scholars Explain", ''The Times of India'', 20 January 1961; "USIS Explanation does not satisfy Haldane: Protest fast continues", ''The Times of India'', 18 January 1961; "USIS Claim Rejected by Haldane: Protest Fast to Continue", ''The Times of India'', 18 January 1961; "Haldane Not Satisfied with USIS Apology: Fast to Continue", ''[[The Free Press Journal]]'', 18 January 1961; "Haldane Goes on Fast In Protest Against U.S. Attitude", ''The Times of India'', 18 January 1961; "Haldane to continue fast: USIS explanation unsatisfactory", ''The Times of India'', 19 January 1961; "Local boy in hunger strike row", ''[[Toronto Star]]'', 20 January 1961; "Haldane, Still on Fast, Loses Weight: U.S.I.S.

B1; Gagnon, "Introduction," p. xxiii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
Botting was raised as a [[Jehovah's Witnesses|Jehovah's Witness]]. At age five, with his sister Mavis (then seven), Botting began going from house to house distributing ''[[The Watchtower]]'' and ''[[Awake!]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''The Orwellian World of Jehovah's Witnesses'' (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1984, p. ix)&lt;/ref&gt; and the following year gave his first sermon about "[[Noah's Ark|Noah and the Ark]]" at the [[Cambridgeshire]] Labour Hall in Cambridge, England.&lt;ref&gt;''The Orwellian World'' p. x&lt;/ref&gt; Mavis and Gary attended the semi-official Theodena Kingdom Boarding School in Suffolk, run by Rhoda Ford, the sister of Percy Ford, at that time the head of Jehovah's Witnesses in Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;"The Orwellian World", pp. 38, 152&lt;/ref&gt; Botting later documented the harsh discipline by caning meted out to him at the hands of Ms. Ford, who had set up the school in defiance of Thorpeness bylaws; he ran away from school, and contracted double pneumonia. As a result of his mother's intervention, the school was shut down, Ms. Ford was disfellowshipped from Jehovah's Witnesses, and her brother demoted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jehovahs-witness.com/topic/131351/orwellian-world-sister-spry?page=1|title=The "Orwellian World" of Sister Spry|first=|last=belbab|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953, Gary's maternal grandmother Lysbeth Turner, unimpressed by her daughter's choice of religion, attempted to expand Gary's religious horizons by introducing him to [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], the principal advocate of "the old religion" of [[Wicca]] to which she adhered.

Botting's lay preaching continued after his arrival in Canada at age ten. He entered the "industrial arts" (rather than "academic") stream in high school, majoring in drafting and machine shop.&lt;ref&gt;T. Gagnon, "Introduction", ''Streaking! The Collected Poems of Gary Botting'' (Houston: Strategic, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1955, Botting was baptized as a "dedicated" Jehovah's Witness at a convention in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;"Preface," ''The Orwellian World of Jehovah's Witnesses'', pp. xi–xii&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1961, Watch Tower vice-president F.W. Franz assigned Botting the task of smuggling ''Watchtowers'' and anti-[[Francisco Franco]] tracts into Spain, where Jehovah's Witnesses were banned.&lt;ref&gt;''The Orwellian World'', p. xi–xii&lt;/ref&gt; From 1961 to 1963, Botting volunteered in Hong Kong as a "pioneer" missionary, supporting himself by working as a journalist for the ''[[South China Morning Post]]''.&lt;ref&gt;David Spurgeon, "Gary Botting, 17, Boy Biologist, Decides on Life as Missionary", ''Globe and Mail'', Friday 7 April 1961; ''Weekend Magazine'', Vol. 10 No. 40, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; Once he returned from Hong Kong, he attended [[Trent University]] to study literature and philosophy. In 1965, the ''[[Peterborough Examiner]]'' published a full-page editorial on Botting's personal dilemma, "Evolution and the Bible: Faith in Science or Faith in God a Choice for Man."&lt;ref&gt;''Peterborough Examiner'', 17 June 1965, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Botting later admitted that his discussions with Haldane in India in 1961 had had a profound effect on his way of looking at the world, although the process of shaking the social imperatives imposed by his religion took decades.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Botting, "Preface", ''The Orwellian World'', pp. xiv–xix; Stanley Oziewicz, "'It's rather like trying to flee Soviet' to get out of Witnesses, author says", ''Globe and Mail'', 21 June 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, Botting's grandmother visited Canada and once again encouraged him to expand his religious horizons to include "the old religion". This time, she focused her attention on Botting's fiancé, Heather Harden, nominally also a Jehovah's Witness, who was receptive to the idea of establishing a Wiccan coven in Canada. In 1969-70, Gary and [[Heather Botting]] established [[Coven Celeste]] in Peterborough, Ontario, having by that time become "inactive" Jehovah's Witnesses.

Disenchanted with organized Christian religion in general and Jehovah's Witnesses in particular, in 1975 Gary and [[Heather Botting]] came out of the "broom closet", publicly declaring their conversion to Wicca and opening the circle of [[Coven Celeste]] to any who were interested. That year, Botting wrote the semi-autobiographical poem sequence ''Monomonster in Hell'',&lt;ref&gt;Red Deer: RDC Press, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; satirizing his experiences as a missionary and the fact that Armageddon had not arrived by October 1975 as Jehovah's Witnesses had predicted.&lt;ref&gt;"Do Jehovah's Witnesses still hold to their 1984 Doomsday deadline?" ''[[Christianity Today]]'', 21 September 1984, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; His play ''Whatever Happened to Saint Joanne?'' (1982) depicted the existential struggle and moral dilemma of leaving a fundamentalist sect.&lt;ref&gt;''Edmonton Journal'', Saturday 1 May 1982, p. D4&lt;/ref&gt; Another of his plays first produced by the Department of Drama at the University of Alberta depicted the forming of a covenstead in which the protagonist priestess rejects her fundamentalist background and protects herself and those she loves with charms, spells and rituals.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Botting, ''The Succubus'', Major Project, Edmonton: University of Alberta Department of Drama, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; In his most recent novel ''Crazy Gran'',&lt;ref&gt;Houston: Strategic, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Botting describes the "Chrislamics", a hybrid sect that emerges from Islamic and Jehovah's Witness fundamentalism to reassert Levitican and [[Sharia Law]] in the name of "Allajah". Their prayers for Armageddon seem to be fulfilled with the advent of [[9/11]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYHhUyzSBKg&amp;feature=youtu.be retrieved 2016-02-21&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, Gary and [[Heather Botting]] co-authored ''The Orwellian World of Jehovah's Witnesses'',&lt;ref&gt;Bob Bettson, "Witnesses risk future with book", ''Calgary Herald'', Wednesday 23 May 1984&lt;/ref&gt; an exposé of the inner workings, shifting doctrines, linguistic quirks and "mental regulating" of members of the group. It graphically compares the religion's closed social paradigms to the "[[Newspeak]]" and thought control depicted in Orwell's novel.&lt;ref&gt;Dwayne Janke, "Book fights JW 'Big Brother ways'", ''Calgary Herald'', 15 May 1984, p. A8; Stephen Weatherbe, "Theocracy girded for the end: An Alberta book says the Jehovah's Witnesses are Orwellian", ''Alberta Report'', 4 June 1984, pp. 34–38&lt;/ref&gt; Critics were generally intrigued by ''The Orwellian World'', Debbie Morgan of the ''[[United Church Observer]]'' calling it "another warning against the way religious doctrine can be created and used to enslave rather than to free."&lt;ref&gt;''The Observer'', January 1985, pp. 62–63&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Lethbridge Herald]]'' called it "jolting and unnerving. Uncanny"; and Carl Rapkins of the ''[[New York Tribune]]'' described it as "excellent and sophisticated—a rare treat."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Q61PAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RAYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5725,5184547|title=Former Members of Jehovah's Witness Say Sect Hard To Quit|work=Ocala Star-Banner|date=1984-05-23|accessdate=2013-01-12}};Norman Sigurdson, "Nothing sinister here despite charges of thought control", ''Winnipeg Free Press'' (Saturday 12 May 1984) pp. 54–55; David E. Reid, "Two new books remove part of mystery around Jehovah's Witnesses movement", ''The Birmingham News'', Friday 22 June 1984, p. 2B&lt;/ref&gt; The book sold out its first edition of 5000 copies within weeks of its release.&lt;ref&gt;"Author meets with Witness president", ''Lethbridge Herald'' (Thursday 14 June 1984) p. C8&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, the Bottings moved to Victoria, British Columbia, and took [[Coven Celeste]] with them. Its existence in Alberta had already inspired the establishment of the [[Aquarian Tabernacle Church]] in British Columbia, and the Bottings were welcomed as third degree elders into both the Canadian and US branches of ATC. Meanwhile, in 1993, Botting published ''Fundamental Freedoms and Jehovah's Witnesses'',&lt;ref&gt;https://www.questia.com/library/102111748/fundamental-freedoms-and-jehovah-s-witnesses; http://www.garybotting.ca/media/online-books/fundamental-freedoms-and-jehovahs-witnesses/front.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; an academic work about Jehovah's Witnesses in Canada and their role in pressing for the development of the ''[[Canadian Bill of Rights]]'' and what eventually became the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://sir.sagepub.com/content/23/4/510.full.pdf+html|first=M.

Despite his advocacy of witchcraft, by 1982 Botting had accepted [[Darwinian evolution]] as indisputable fact.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Isbister, "Jehovah's Witness author unnerved by life in 'false religion'", ''The Advocate'', Saturday 6 October 1984, p. 1C; Tihemme Gagnon, "Introduction", ''Streaking! The Collected Poems of Gary Botting'' (Miami: Strategic, 2013), p. xx–xxii.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, he thoroughly excoriated the "[[Big Bang]]" theory, calling it "an absolute fallacy".&lt;ref&gt;''Campbell's Kids'', Houston: Strategic, 2015, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; Einstein had been derailed by Hubble's notion that the universe was expanding in all directions at once. The universal red shift, Botting stated, could be better explained by Einstein's 1915 theory of the gravitational red shift, expanded in 1922 and empirically "proven" in 1964. Any luminous object in space, whether star or galaxy, is bound to have immense mass, but its light, held back by the gravity of the stellar or gallactic body, is not allowed to escape unaltered. While the speed of light remains constant, its wavelength compensates, shifting towards red. This gives the illusion of an expanding universe, even though in fact the universe is not expanding at all.&lt;ref&gt;''The Box Beyond'', Edmonton: Harden House, 1972; ''Prometheus Rebound'', Edmonton: Harden House, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Botting famously stated to a panel of research scientists that belief in the Big Bang was almost as absurd as belief in God.&lt;ref&gt;''Streaking! The Collected Poems of Gary Botting, Revised Edition'', Houston: Strategic, 2014, "Introduction," pp. xxxii, 40-41,&lt;/ref&gt; He reconciled his atheism with his advocacy of the pagan path by reference to the sacredness of nature itself as the Earth struggles to rectify the damage caused by humankind, a species so dominated by extraneous traditions of the past that it has lost sight of its destiny as destroyer of the planet. Religion was a form of theatre that could coexist with a godless yet unfathomably immense and miraculous universe. The priests and the clergy in any religion were nothing more than actors following a script, indeed ''scripture'', as interpreted by directors and producers at the top of the hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Botting, "Evolution and the Bible: Faith in Science or Faith in God a Choice for Man," ''Peterborough Examiner'', 17 June 1965, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Faith in science and faith in religion have equal significance to the human psyche, but neither should be taken for granted and both should be constantly tested without fear of reprisal. The capacity to appreciate both science and religion simultaneously is a dualistic byproduct of human evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Botting, "Dualism in the Novels of William Golding," Master's Thesis, St. John's: Memorial University of Newfoundland, 1970&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, both science and religion are merely extensions of the human mind calibrated using different dimensions of spacetime, one concrete and the other abstract.&lt;ref&gt;''Prometheus Rebound'', in ''Streaking! The Collected Poems of Gary Botting, Revised Edition'', p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; Where science crosses the boundary into the abstract, as in quantum physics, it becomes more akin to faith-based religion than to empirical science. Both ultimately demand the suspension of disbelief.

Rather than regarding himself as an essentialist like Iris Murdoch or an existentialist like Jean-Paul Sartre, Botting has described himself as an ''extensionist'': all things, including human understanding, can be explained as extensions of mind and body in space and time.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Botting, ''Extensionism'', unpublished ms., 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Like [[Richard Dawkins]], of whose brand of genetic theory—and unabashed atheism—Botting has been a staunch advocate, he was admittedly influenced by the observations and opinions of [[J. B. S. Haldane]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Dawkins, ''The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution'' (New York: Free Press,2009), pp. 31n, 147, 211–12, 217, 248–50, 330–331, 418  Gagnon, p. xxi; ''The Orwellian World'', pp. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt;

==Journalist==
In September 1961, Botting left Canada for Hong Kong initially to become a missionary for Jehovah's Witnesses; but he had to support himself, and soon became first a proofreader and then a full-time reporter for the ''[[South China Morning Post]]''. This led to many adventures which he chronicled in his serialized ''Occupational Hazard: The Adventures of a Journalist''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Advocate'', serialized weekly column commencing 18 May 1977&lt;/ref&gt; Soon journalism became a priority and he became one of the main feature writers for the ''South China Sunday Post-Herald''.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Botting, "The Descent of 20 Battery", ''South China Sunday Post-Herald'', 31 March 1963; Gary Botting, "The Death or Glory Boys in Macau", ''South China Sunday Post-Herald'', 16 June 1963; Gary Botting, "A Corporal at Ten", ''South China Sunday Post-Herald'', 16 June 1983; Gary Botting, "She's a Bit of Portugal Afloat", ''South China Sunday Post-Herald'', 23 June 1963, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Canada and in 1964 began to work for the ''Peterborough Examiner'',&lt;ref&gt;Gary Botting, "Hong Kong: Two Faces of the Orient", ''Peterborough Examiner'', 1 February 1964&lt;/ref&gt; then owned by [[Robertson Davies]], at the same time attending Trent University, where he was editor of the student newspaper, ''Trent Trends'', and literary magazine, ''Tridentine''. He became fast friends with [[Farley Mowat]] and wrote several features about the popular author, describing their shared escapades on ''The Happy Adventure'' ("The Boat that Wouldn't Float"), including speculation as to whether sharks had invaded [[Lake Ontario]] via the newly opened St. Lawrence Seaway.&lt;ref&gt;"Sharks in Lake Ontario—Farley Mowat", ''The Port Hope Evening Guide'', 19 July 1968; "How did I enjoy ''what'' swim?" political cartoon, editorial page, ''Toronto Star'', 20 July 1968; Gary Botting, "You'll find Farley Mowat a totally innocent devil", ''The Advocate'', Tuesday, 24 October 1972, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; As an investigative reporter, in 1966 Botting opted to serve time in jail rather than pay parking fines so that he could write an exposé on security and sanitation problems at the notorious Victoria County Jail in Ontario—eventually forcing the prison to close.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Botting, "Reporter went to jail to get the 'inside' story", ''Peterborough Examiner'', 9 April 1966, p. 5, ''Globe and Mail'', 10 April 1966; Gary Botting, "Newsman found that piece of wire could open cell door in county jail", ''Peterborough Examiner'', 11 April 1966, p. 15; Gary Botting, "Health conditions at Victoria County Jail leave much to be desired", 13 April 1966, p.22&lt;/ref&gt; His later work of [[popular history]], ''Chief Smallboy: In Pursuit of Freedom'', published in 2005 by Fifth House Books, discusses the life of mid-twentieth century [[Cree]] leader Bobtail ("Bob") Smallboy of the [[Ermineskin Cree Nation]]. Laurie Meijer-Drees, writing for ''The Canadian Historical Review'',&lt;ref name="Drees2008"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Laurie Meijer|last=Drees|title=''Chief Smallboy: In Pursuit of Freedom'' (review)|journal=The Canadian Historical Review|volume=89|date=June 2008|doi=10.1353/can.0.0037|issue=2|pages=285–286}}&lt;/ref&gt; praised the book for its use of [[oral history]] and [[family history]] in shedding more light on its subject, but criticized its portrayal of Smallboy as a "lone leader" with few peers and in particular its failure to put Smallboy in context with major First Nations political movements of the time such as the [[Indian Association of Alberta]].&lt;ref name="Drees2008"/&gt;

==Poet==
Commencing in the 1960s, Botting published poetry in various literary magazines including ''Casserole'', ''Hecate's Loom'', ''Issue'', ''Legal Studies Forum'', ''New Thursday'', ''Tridentine''—and ''Umwelt'', a Canadian literary magazine which he later satirized in ''BumweltS: Poems Written in Sexy ’69''.&lt;ref&gt;St. John’s: Memorial University of Newfoundland&lt;/ref&gt; His third collection of poems, ''Streaking!'' (1974)&lt;ref&gt;Red Deer: RDC Press&lt;/ref&gt; helped popularize that fad in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;"Winged Streaker Bears Bum Show," ''Edmonton Journal'', 6 April 1974; "It Had to Happen: RDC sees streak," Red Deer ''Advocate'', 24 May 1974&lt;/ref&gt; ''Monomonster in Hell'' (1975)&lt;ref name="RDC Press"&gt;RDC Press&lt;/ref&gt; —based loosely on Botting's experiences as a missionary in Hong Kong—satirizes the failed prophecy of Jehovah’s Witnesses, who had anticipated that Armageddon would come by October 2, 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Tihemme Gagnon, "Introduction" to ''Streaking! The Collected Poems of Gary Botting'', Houston: Strategic, 2014, p. xxix&lt;/ref&gt; ''Freckled Blue'' (1976),&lt;ref name="RDC Press"/&gt; ''Lady Godiva on a Plaster Horse'' (1977)&lt;ref name="RDC Press"/&gt; and ''Lady of My House'' (1986) &lt;ref&gt;Harden House of Canada&lt;/ref&gt; are collections of love poems which explore different poetic forms from experimental and concrete poetry to more conventional sonnets and ballads.&lt;ref&gt;"Poets Form Tour Circuit", ''Lethbridge Herald'' (Friday 21 January 1977), p. 8; "Newsmakers: Dr. Gary Botting", ''Lethbridge Herald"'' (Wednesday 7 June 1978) p. 9; "Off the Record: an Anthology of Poetry by Lawyers", James R.

The Collected Poems of Gary Botting'' (2014), edited by screenwriter Tihemme Gagnon.&lt;ref&gt;Houston: Strategic, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Playwright==
Beginning as playwright in residence with People &amp; Puppets Incorporated in Edmonton, Alberta in the 1970s, Botting wrote some 30 plays, a dozen of which received awards from the governments of both Canada and Alberta as well as private sponsors such as the ''[[Edmonton Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Drake McHugh, "Journal Literary Award Winners: He will produce own play," ''Edmonton Journal'', 4 July 1971, p. D1&lt;/ref&gt; He first became active in theatre in the 1960s, when he acted in [[Academy Theatre]] and Peterborough Theatre Guild productions in Ontario, Canada. In the late 1960s, he became a theatre and movie critic for the [[Peterborough Examiner]]; his essays on and reviews of contemporary [[Off-Off-Broadway]] productions were collected in his critique ''The Theatre of Protest in America''.&lt;ref&gt;Edmonton: Harden House, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

His first play, written in St. John’s, Newfoundland in 1969, was ''[[The School of Night]]'', later published as the award-winning ''Harriott!'',&lt;ref name="Edmonton: Harden House, 1972"&gt;Edmonton: Harden House, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; about the occult club formed in the 1590s by [[Thomas Harriott]], [[Christopher Marlowe]] and [[Sir Walter Raleigh]]. ''The School of Night'' and ''Who Has Seen the Scroll?'' were first produced in Ontario in 1969–70. ''Prometheus Rebound'',&lt;ref name="Edmonton: Harden House, 1972"/&gt; written for the Open Theatre in St. John's, Newfoundland in 1969, was first produced by People &amp; Puppets Incorporated in Edmonton, Alberta in 1971. A sequel to the dramatic poems of Aeschylus and Shelley, Botting's version of the myth portrays Prometheus' punishment for granting man access to nuclear energy.

Botting studied drama, including dramaturgy, in 1971–72 as a minor for his Ph.D. in English Literature, and a decade later received the Master of Fine Arts in playwriting from University of Alberta. Several of his plays were produced by the drama department, including his thesis production, ''Whatever Happened to Saint Joanne?'', exposing the tendency of fundamental Christian ministers to exploit promising members of their sects. ''Edmonton Journal'' theater critic Keith Ashwell called ''Saint Joanne'' an "incredibly imaginative play": "In dramatizing his experiences he has written a very disquieting piece, that becomes positively uncomfortable at the end."&lt;ref&gt;Keith Ashwell, "Thesis play a bit clever: ''Whatever Happened to Saint Joanne'' by Gary Botting," ''Edmonton Journal'', Saturday May 1, 1982, p. D4&lt;/ref&gt; Botting's most popular award-winning plays were ''Crux'' (1983), about a nude woman who steadfastly refuses to be talked down out of her tree by her materialistic husband;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Lee, "Ingenue bares all in play," ''Advocate'', 17 February 1983, p. 1B; "Morality, Nudity mix in Red Deer," Canadian Press, 17 February 1983; "Nude Woman in Morality Play", ''Lethbridge Herald'' (Friday 18 February 1983) p. B5; "Sell-out crowds enjoy 'stunning' production of top one-act play", ''The Advocate'' (Monday 21 February 1983) p. 2B;&lt;/ref&gt; ''Winston Agonistes'' (1984), a sequel to [[George Orwell]]’s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-four]]'';&lt;ref&gt;Jim Lozeron, "Sequel jolts Orwell view into reality," ''Advocate'', 15 February 1984, p. 1B&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Fathers'', first produced in a federal penitentiary by William Head on Stage in Victoria, British Columbia in 1993. Botting continues to write plays for the stage and screen.

==Novelist==
Botting wrote his first novel, the semi-autobiographical ''Through Freedom's Curtain'', in Hong Kong in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;H.D. Harden, "Afterword" to the 1974 edition of ''Streaking!'', Red Deer, RDC Press, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; There, a Canadian journalist in Hong Kong, having entered Mao's China illegally to get a story on the refugee problem, finds himself imprisoned and facing serious charges. "His eventual escape is a metaphysical flight beyond the conventions of job, security and national pride. He discovers himself, but first must learn to live with the anguish of self-realization."&lt;ref&gt;H.D. Harden, "Afterword", ''Streaking! The Collected Poems of Gary Botting'', Revised Edition. Houston: Strategic, 2016, p. 333&lt;/ref&gt; His recent novels include ''Campbell's Kids'' (2015),&lt;ref&gt;Houston, Strategic, 2015; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwATKIhS2Zc&lt;/ref&gt; set in Alberta, about an amnesiac pyromaniac who has an affair with a cheating journalist;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwATKIhS2Zc|title=Campbell's Kids by Gary Botting|first=|last=SBPRA|date=21 August 2015|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Crazy Gran'' (2016),&lt;ref&gt;Houston, Strategic, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; set in upstate New York, where in the week after 9/11 the protagonist discovers, to her peril, that her Syrian uncle helped plan the attacks on the World Trade Centre.&lt;ref&gt;http://sbpra.com/garybotting/; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYHhUyzSBKg&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professor of English Literature and Creative Writing==
Botting graduated with a B.A. from Trent University with a joint major in philosophy and English literature,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.trentu.ca/english/community/life-after-trent&lt;/ref&gt; then obtained his Master of Arts degree in English from [[Memorial University of Newfoundland]]&lt;ref&gt;"Dualism in the Novels of William Golding" (M.A. thesis, Memorial University of Newfoundland, 1970)&lt;/ref&gt; and his PhD in English literature and Master of Fine Arts in drama (playwriting) from the [[University of Alberta]] in Edmonton. There, he taught English at the University of Alberta and was producer and playwright-in-residence for People &amp; Puppets Incorporated and Edmonton Summer Theatre—precursors to the [[Edmonton Fringe Festival]]. Botting's PhD dissertation was on [[William Golding]],&lt;ref&gt;"Three Grades of Thought in the Novels of William Golding" (doctoral diss., University of Alberta, 1975), published as ''Thinking As a Hobby: the Novels of William Golding'', Red Deer: Red Deer College Press, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; author of ''[[Lord of the Flies]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See Gary Botting, "Leadership in ''Lord of the Flies''", Gary Botting and M.E. Symons, eds. ''Leadership: An Anthology'' (Victoria: Royal Roads University, 1998), pp. 75–89&lt;/ref&gt; From 1972 to 1986 Botting taught English and creative writing at [[Red Deer College]], where he was at various times the college's media relations coordinator, chairman of the English department, editor-in-chief of Red Deer College Press,&lt;ref&gt;http://rdc.ab.ca/about/history/1980s&lt;/ref&gt; and president of the Faculty Association. He was later remembered by college librarian and fellow thespian Paul Boultbee (who had acted in Botting's plays ''Crux'' (1983)&lt;ref&gt;"Nude Woman in Morality Play", ''Lethbridge Herald'', Friday 18 February 1983, p. B5&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Winston Agonistes'' (1984))&lt;ref&gt;"What better year to have a sequel to George Orwell's ''1984''?" ''Alberta Report'', 19 March 1984, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; as being a "creative, ''rebellious'' faculty member."&lt;ref&gt;Paul G. Boultbee, "Vain Dream to Mainstream: the Growth of Red Deer College Press", ''Papers of the Bibliographical Society of Canada,'' 33/1, p. 51 https://jps.library.utoronto.ca/index.php/bsc/article/viewFile/17946/14879&lt;/ref&gt; Be that as it may, Botting was named "Citizen of the Year" by the Central Alberta Allied Arts Council on 5 May 1984.&lt;ref&gt;"Citizen of the Year: Dr. Gary Botting," ''Central Alberta Advisor'', Friday 11 May 1984, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, Botting was vice-president of Central Alberta Theatre, sat on the executive of the Literary Presses Group and the Canadian Publishers Association, and was founding president of the Alberta Publishers Association.&lt;ref&gt;George Melnyk, "Honeymoon with Alta. govt. over", ''Quill &amp; Quire'', January 1976, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; He taught English and creative writing at [[Maskwachees Cultural College]] in Hobbema, establishment of which he had initially proposed in the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Botting, ''Chief Smallboy: In Pursuit of Freedom'', Calgary: Fifth House, 1985, p. x&lt;/ref&gt; While first setting up his law practice in Victoria in the early 1990s he taught creative writing and English literature for various colleges and universities, including [[Lakeland College (Alberta)|Lakeland College]] in Alberta and [[Simon Fraser University]] in British Columbia.

==Lawyer==
[[File:Gary Botting Lawyer.jpg|thumbnail]]
Botting entered the [[University of Calgary Faculty of Law]] on a Brunet scholarship in 1987. Shortly afterwards he joined the staff of the Institute of Natural Resources Law as a legal researcher. He was elected vice-president of Victims of Law Dilemma (VOLD), an independent watchdog group designed to keep lawyers responsible and to pressure Canadian law societies to appoint lay benchers. As a first-year law student he represented [[Joel Slater]], an American man who became stateless after [[list of former United States citizens who relinquished their nationality|renouncing US citizenship]].&lt;ref name="SeattleTimes19921127"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19921127&amp;slug=1526849|first=Kim|last=Boatman|title=A Man Without A Country, Literally|work=The Seattle Times|date=1992-11-27|accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was in second year, the Law Society of Alberta "investigated" Botting for representing Howard Pursley, an alleged white supremacist refugee claimant who was eventually flown directly from Calgary to Texas in a form of disguised extradition later known as [[extraordinary rendition]].&lt;ref&gt;Tom Keyser, "Far-right label proves sticky", ''Calgary Herald'', 2 May 1989; Tom Olsen, "Pursley won't quit refugee fight", ''The Calgary Sun'', Tuesday 25 April 1989, p. 18; "White supremacist renews claim for refugee status", ''Globe and Mail'', Tuesday, 24 April 1989, p. A12&lt;/ref&gt; Botting was cleared of any wrongdoing.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Boras, "Pursley lawyer cleared", ''Calgary Herald'', Thursday 8 June 1989, p. B6&lt;/ref&gt; In his third year, Botting was enlisted by Calgary lawyers Don McLeod and Noel O'Brien to assist them with research in connection with the extradition of [[Charles Ng]]—who faced the death penalty for allegedly murdering as many as 25 men, women and children in California. That year Botting also represented the first dozen Chinese students in Canada to be granted refugee status after they publicly protested China's 1989 clampdown on demonstrators in [[Tiananmen Square]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ucalgary.ca/profiles/shaobo-xie|title=Shaobo Xie - Department of English|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating in 1990, Botting articled in Victoria for [[Doug Christie (lawyer)|Doug Christie]]. Botting pioneered the use of video appearances of witnesses in jury trials before Canadian courtrooms were equipped with video machines, in one instance convincing the judge that she and the jury should move from the courthouse to a nearby hotel in Victoria, B.C. to hear the live evidence of a witness in New Brunswick.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Botting &amp; Hugh Trenchard, "Witness Evidence via Live Video Link in the Canadian Criminal Courtroom", (July 1997) 55 ''The Advocate'' 523, 524.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Victoria Times-Colonist'', 7 November 1996, p. A3&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable clients whom Botting has represented include Dorothy Grey-Vik, who five decades after the fact successfully sued her parents' former hired hand for repeatedly raping her, beginning when she was a prepubescent school girl, making her his "sex slave" for two years and fathering her two children (born when she was twelve and thirteen, respectively)&lt;ref&gt;"Ex-'sex slave' sues: She bore her rapist's kids 5 decades ago", ''The Province'', Friday 31 December 1993, p. 1; Gordon Clark, "Horror after horror", ''The Province'', Friday 31 December 1993, p.

"The other half could sign onto the new UMET in due course, once they met specific minimal standards of justice, including protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.advocatedaily.com/profile/dr--gary-botting-botting-proposes-changes-to-international-extradition-treaties.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hong Daeyong''' ({{Korean|hangul=홍대용|hanja=洪大容}}; 12 May 1731 – 17 November 1783), styled '''Damheon''' ({{Korean|hangul=담헌|hanja=湛軒}}, "Relaxed house") was a philosopher, astronomer and mathematician of the late [[Joseon Kingdom]]. Hong was an early leader of the  ''Profitable Usage and Benefiting the People'' ({{Korean|hangul=이용후생파|hanja=利用厚生派|rr=Iyong Husaeng-pa}}) school of thought.  It worked to promote the industrialization of his country and the development of trade by positively introducing Western technologies to Joseon Korea. Hong was a friend of [[Bak Jiwon (born 1737)|Park Ji-won]], who was another leader of the ''Profitable Usage'' school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Contents/SearchNavi?keyword=%ED%99%8D%EB%8C%80%EC%9A%A9&amp;ridx=0&amp;tot=14|title=Hong Daeyong(洪大容)|last=|first=|date=|website=Encyclopedia of Korean Culture|language=ko|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Hong Daeyong was born in 1731 in [[Cheonan]], [[South Chungcheong Province]]. In his early days, Hong was educated by [[Kim One-hang]] of [[Seock-sil Seowon]]. During this period, traditional [[Neo-Confucianism]] formed the basis of his academic world. In 1765, Hong followed his uncle Hong Eock({{Korean|hangul=홍억|hanja=洪檍}}), who was in [[Joseon missions to Imperial China]]. In China, Hong witnessed a brilliant development of [[Qing Dynasty]] and experienced [[culture shock]]. After returning to Joseon, Hong insisted enhancing the national prosperity.

==Astronomy==

Hong was also interested in [[astronomy]] and [[mathematics]]. He maintained the rotundity of the Earth and [[Earth's rotation]]. Traditional Confucianists regard that the sky is globular and the ground is square so they couldn't understand Hong's idea. Also, He firmly excluded the [[Anthropocentrism]]. Hong thought all things in nature are equal.

After being failed [[Imperial examination]] (a kind of examination for the high civil service) a few times, Hong gave up examination and was absorbed in astronomy research. He wrote ''[[Catechism of Eusan mountain]]''({{Korean|hangul=의산문답|hanja=醫山問答}}), which contains the concepts of Earth's rotation and the equality among species and the infinity of [[outer space]]. In mathematics, Hong wrote ''[[Interpretation and Usage of Mathematics]]''({{Korean|hangul=주해수용|hanja=籌解需用}}). And he wrote ''[[Travel Essay of Yanjing in 1765 and 1766]]''({{Korean|hangul=을병연행록|hanja=乙丙燕行錄}}), a travel journal about his China travel.

==Crown Prince==

In 1774, Hong was recommended for a mentor of Crown Prince, who afterwards would be [[Jeongjo of Joseon|King Jeongjo]]. Hong discussed many topics and themes with crown prince. Although Crown Prince was satisfied with Hong's studies and polymathy, Hong found their difference of views among several topics and the conservatism of Prince. Crown prince demanded Hong to go into government service and be his own staff members, but Hong indicated his refusal in a roundabout way. Hong wrote ''[[Journal as the Mentor of Crown Prince]]''({{Korean|hangul=계방일기|hanja=桂坊日記}}), which contains their debate contents.

After crown prince ascended the throne following the passing of the [[Yeongjo of Joseon|King Yeongjo]], Hong was appointed to local county governor. In there he tried to test his progressive ideas in local society. However, his mother's health condition deteriorated in 1782, so Hong abandoned a service and came back to Seoul. In 1783, mother regained her health, but Hong had a sudden [[stroke]]. He wouldn't make it by morning, and breathed his last breath the next day. It was 23 October 1783([[Lunisolar calendar]]) as 17 November 1783([[Solar calendar]]).

==Works==

Hong's works, including ''Catechism of Ui mountain'', ''Interpretation and Usage of Mathematics'', ''Journal as the Mentor of Crown Prince'' were compiled to collection, ''[[Books of Relaxed House]]'' ({{Korean|hangul=담헌서|hanja=湛軒書}}). His practical Confucian ideas were succeeded by [[Bak Jiwon (born 1737)|Park Ji-won]] and Park's disciples, but his scientific thought and research were succeeded by nobody.

'''Idempotency of entailment''' is a property of [[logical system]]s that states that one may derive the same consequences from many instances of a hypothesis as from just one.   This property can be captured by a [[structural rule]] called '''[[Structural rule#Common structural rules|contraction]]''', and in such systems one may say that [[Logical consequence|entailment]] is [[idempotent]] if and only if contraction is an [[admissible rule]].

Rule of Contraction: from

:A,C,C → B

is derived
  
:A,C → B.

Or in [[sequent calculus]] notation,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Gamma,C,C\vdash B}{\Gamma,C\vdash B}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4099">[[File:Jean-Marc Ferry par Claude Truong-Ngoc avril 2014.jpg|thumb|Jean-Marc Ferry&lt;br /&gt;by Claude Truong-Ngoc, 2014.]]
'''Jean-Marc Ferry''' (born 5 May 1946) is a French philosopher who is best known for his book ''Les puissances de l'expérience'' (1991), described by [[Paul Ricoeur]] as "one of the most important works recently published in the field of social and political philosophy".&lt;ref&gt;French ''Il est grand temps de dire que le livre de Jean-Marc Ferry, Les Puissances de l’expérience, est l’une des œuvres les plus importantes récemment publiées dans le champ de la philosophie sociale et politique...'' [[Libération]], 12 March 1992 [http://users.skynet.be/sky95042/ricoeur.html]&lt;/ref&gt; He has also translated the work of [[Jürgen Habermas]], by whom he was influenced, into French.

==Narration, Interpretation, Argumentation, Reconstruction==
According to Ferry, the forms of discourse through which identity is constructed are narration, interpretation, argumentation, and reconstruction. P. Smith summarizes Ferry as follows,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Historical and discursive progress from narration toward reconstruction is associated with increasing reflexivity about identity and the grounds upon which it is established. Narration, in Ferry’s view, consists of ossified traditional myths which define identities in a more or less prescriptive, taken-forgranted way. Interpretation, on the other hand, involves the assimilation of identity to universal categories like law and justice and is exemplified in early Christian and ancient Greek thought. Argumentation opens up claims of identity to rational dialogue as embodied, for example, in the Enlightenment. Reconstruction, the final step toward reflexivity, involves hermeneutic attempts to understand the historical grounds behind the "good reasons" offered by others in argumentation. This is in part a logical and ethical consequence of the shift from it to you (acknowledging subjectivity) which emerges with argumentation itself.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Smith ([[University of Queensland]]) ''Les puissances de l'expérience'' in, Contemporary Sociology, American Sociological Assoc., May 1994, vol. 23, number 3. [http://users.skynet.be/sky95042/review.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Postnational Identity and Europe==
Ferry also discusses what he considers to be the building of ''postnational identity'' in Europe, a way to think of the [[European Union]] as a medium to separate national identity and political identity. The former and the latter are unified in the classical [[Nation-State]], but separated by the process of the building of a new Europe, whose ultimate political identity is not the Nation-State but a ''Political Community'' which, according to Ferry, is not a [[Federal State]] nor a State in general but an absolutely other form of political construction. This new construction derives from the experience of World Wars I &amp; II, which, Ferry believes, forced the European people to organize their inter-relationship beyond classical models of sovereignty and warfare.

==The Spinelli Group==
On 15 September 2010, Ferry supported the new initiative [[Spinelli Group]] in the [[European Parliament]], which was founded to reinvigorate the strive for federalisation of the European Union (EU). Other prominent supporters of the initiative are [[Jacques Delors]], [[Daniel Cohn-Bendit]], [[Guy Verhofstadt]], [[Andrew Duff]], and [[Elmar Brok]].

'''Johann Jakob Bachofen''' (22 December 1815 &amp;ndash; 25 November 1887) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[antiquarian]], [[jurist]], [[philologist]], and [[anthropologist]], professor for [[Roman law]] at the [[University of Basel]] from 1841&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gentlemen and Amazons: The Myth of Matriarchal Prehistory, 1861–1900|last=Eller|first=Cynthia|year=2011|publisher=University of California Press|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 1845.

Bachofen is most often connected with his theories surrounding prehistoric [[matriarchy]], or ''Das Mutterrecht'', the title of his seminal 1861 book ''Mother Right: an investigation of the religious and juridical character of matriarchy in the Ancient World.'' Bachofen assembled documentation demonstrating that [[motherhood]] is the source of human society, religion, morality, and decorum. He postulated an archaic "mother-right" within the context of a  primeval [[Matriarchal religion]] or ''[[Urreligion]]''.

Bachofen became an important precursor of 20th-century theories of matriarchy, such as the [[Old Europe (archaeology)|Old European culture]] postulated by [[Marija Gimbutas]] from the 1950s, and the field of [[feminist theology]] and "[[Matriarchal Studies]]" in [[second-wave feminism|1970s feminism]].

==Biography==
Born into a wealthy [[Basel]] family active in the silk industry, Bachofen studied in Basel and in Berlin under  August Boeckh, Karl Ferdinand Ranke and Friedrich Carl von Savigny, as well as in Göttingen.
After completing his doctorate in Basel, he studied for another two years in Paris, London and Cambridge.
He was called to the Basel chair for [[Roman law]] in 1841, but he retired early in 1845, and published most of his works as a private scholar.
Bachofen is buried at the ''Wolfgottesacker'' cemetery in Basel.

==''Das Mutterrecht''==
Bachofen's 1861 ''Das Mutterrecht'' proposed four phases of cultural evolution which absorbed each other:

# Hetaerism: a wild nomadic 'tellurian' [= [[chthonic]] or earth-centered] phase, characterised by him as communistic and [[polyamorous]], whose dominant deity he believed to have been an earthy proto [[Aphrodite]].
# Das Mutterecht: a matriarchal 'lunar' phase based on agriculture, characterised by him by the emergence of [[chthonic]] [[mystery cult]]s and law. Its dominant deity was an early [[Demeter]].
# The Dionysian: a transitional phase when earlier traditions were masculinised as patriarchy began to emerge. Its dominant deity was the original [[Dionysos]].
# The Apollonian: the patriarchal 'solar' phase, in which all trace of the Matriarchal and Dionysian past was eradicated and modern civilisation emerged.

===Reception===
{{Main|Matriarchy}}
There was little initial reaction to Bachofen’s theory of cultural evolution, largely because of his impenetrable literary style, but eventually, along with furious criticism, the book inspired several generations of ethnologists, social philosophers, and even writers: [[Lewis Henry Morgan]]; [[Friedrich Engels]], who drew on Bachofen for ''[[The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State]]''; [[Thomas Mann]]; [[Jane Ellen Harrison]], who was inspired by Bachofen to devote her career to [[mythology]]; [[Walter Benjamin]]; [[Erich Fromm]]; [[Robert Graves]]; [[Rainer Maria Rilke]]; [[Joseph Campbell]]; [[Otto Gross]]; [[Erich Neumann (psychologist)|Erich Neumann]] and opponents such as [[Julius Evola]].

Friedrich Engels analysed Bachofen's views as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State]]|year=2010|first=Friedrich|last=Engels|publisher=Penguin UK|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:"(1) That [[Primitive promiscuity|originally man lived in a state of sexual promiscuity]], to describe which Bachofen uses the mistaken term "[[hetaerism]]";
:(2) that such promiscuity excludes any certainty of paternity, and that descent could therefore be reckoned only in the female line, according to mother-right, and that this was originally the case amongst all the peoples of antiquity;
:(3) that since women, as mothers, were the only parents of the younger generation that were known with certainty, they held a position of such high respect and honor that it became the foundation, in Bachofen's conception, of a regular rule of women (gynaecocracy);
:(4) that the transition to monogamy, where the woman belonged to one man exclusively, involved a violation of a primitive religious law (that is, actually a violation of the traditional right of the other men to this woman), and that in order to expiate this violation or to purchase indulgence for it the woman had to surrender herself for a limited period."  (Friedrich Engels, 1891: see link below)

A selection of Bachofen's writings was translated as ''Myth, Religion and Mother Right'' (1967). A fuller edited English edition in several volumes is being published.

As has been noted by [[Joseph Campbell]] in ''Occidental Mythology'' and others, Bachofen's theories stand in radical opposition to the Aryan origin theories of religion, culture and society, and both Campbell and writers such as Evola have suggested that Bachofen's theories only adequately explain the development of religion among the pre-Aryan cultures of the Mediterranean and the Levant, and possibly Southern Asia, but that a separate, patriarchal development existed among the Aryan tribes which conquered Europe and parts of Asia.

{{John}}
'''John 21''' is the twenty-first chapter of the [[Gospel of John]] in the [[New Testament]] of the [[Christian]] [[Bible]]. It contains an account of the [[Post-Resurrection appearances of Jesus|resurrection appearance]] in [[Galilee]], which the text describes as the third time [[Jesus]] had appeared to his disciples. In the course of this chapter, there is a miraculous [[catch of 153 fish]], the [[Restoration of Peter|confirmation of Peter's love for Jesus]], a foretelling of [[Saint Peter|Peter]]'s death in old age, and a comment about the [[Disciple whom Jesus loved|beloved disciple]]'s future. New Testament scholars are largely agreed that it was not part of the original text of the Gospel of John.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg-dJA3SnTA |title=Debate "Is the Original New Testament Lost?"

* The original text is written in [[Koine Greek]].
* [[Chapters and verses of the Bible|This chapter is divided into]] 25 verses.

==Appendage==
In the [[John 20|previous chapter]] of John's Gospel, the text summarizes the many signs which Jesus performed for his followers, ''not all of which could be recorded in the Gospel''. John 21 begins with the [[Johannine transition]], ''After these things...'' ({{lang-el|Μετὰ ταῦτα|translit=meta tauta}}) which is used frequently in the Fourth Gospel,&lt;ref&gt;John 2:12, 3:22, 5:1, 6:1, 6:66, 7:1, 11:7, 19:28, 21:1&lt;/ref&gt; leading some scholars to suggest that John 21 was appended in the same way as [[Mark 16|Mark 16:9–20]]. Peter's ecclesiastical role is emphasized, but this is similar to Peter's commissioning in John 1.&lt;ref&gt;John 1:42&lt;/ref&gt; The Nestle-Aland Novum Testamentum Graece (27th ed.) as well as major translations of the [[New Testament]] (e.g. [[KJV]], [[New American Standard Bible|NASB]], [[NIV]], [[Revised Standard Version|RSV]], [[NRSV]]) retain this chapter in their editions as original, and just one fragmentary manuscript has been discovered that may end at John 20 without John 21.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

One theory is that the author simply decided to add an additional incident at some time after writing the book, but before final publication. [[Brooke Foss Westcott|Westcott]] stated,
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is impossible to suppose that it was the original design of the Evangelist to add the incidents of chapter 21 after the verses which form a solemn close of his record of the great history of the conflict of faith and unbelief in the life of Christ.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But [[Donald Guthrie (theologian)|Donald Guthrie]] writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is unlikely that another author wrote this section since there are several points of contact in it with the style and language of previous chapters...([[Inter-Varsity Press|IVP]] New Bible Commentary)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Church Father]] [[Tertullian]] wrote, "And wherefore does this conclusion of the gospel affirm that these things were written unless it is that you might believe, it says, that Jesus Christ is the son of God?", which describes the end of Chapter 20, not Chapter 21. However, no existing manuscript of the Gospel omits this chapter.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=thXUHM5udTcC&amp;pg=PA192  Helmut Koester, ''Introduction to the New Testament''] (Walter de Gruyter 2000 {{ISBN|978-3-11014970-8}}) vol. 2, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=tr3Y7KrCaoMC&amp;pg=PA258 Chris Keith, ''The Pericope Adulterae, the Gospel of John, and the Literacy of Jesus''] (Brill 2009 {{ISBN|978-9-00417394-1}}), p. 258&lt;/ref&gt;

The description of the "[[beloved disciple]]'s" (normally assumed to be John) fate is presented as an aside to Peter. Jesus says that it is not Peter's concern, even if Jesus should wish that that disciple remain alive until the end of time. The following verse clarifies that Jesus did not say "This disciple will not die", but that it was not for Peter to know.

==Verses 24–25==
The chapter is closed by two verses referring to the author of the gospel (whoever it might be) in the third person ("We know that his testimony is true").

==Manuscript evidence==
In an essay, contributed on behalf of scholars unconvinced of any decisive sense of "originality" to John 21 (published in 2007), Felix Just wrote: "We (unfortunately!) do not possess any ancient manuscript of John that actually ends at 20:31."&lt;ref&gt;
Felix Just, 'Combining Key Methodologies in Johannine Studies', in Tom Thatcher (ed), ''What We Have Heard from the Beginning: The Past, Present, and Future of Johannine Studies'', ([[Baylor University|Baylor University Press]], 2007), p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt;
In other words, ancient manuscripts that contain the end of John 20 also contain text from John 21. So if John 21 is an addition, it was so early (which is not in doubt: part of John 21 appears in [[Papyrus 66|P66]]) and so widespread, that no evidence of the prior form has survived. This should however be balanced against the tendency for the first and last pages of codices to be lost: there are just four papyrus witnesses to John 20–21, only three of which date from the 4th century or earlier.&lt;ref&gt;http://catholic-resources.org/John/Papyri.html&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Novum Testamentum Graece]]'' (NA28) and the [[United Bible Societies]] (UBS5) provide the critical text for John 21.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nestle-aland.com/en/read-na28-online/text/bibeltext/lesen/stelle/53/210001/219999/ Nestle-Aland Novum Testamentum Graece, Jn 21]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 one 4th-century [[Sahidic]] papyrus manuscript (Bodleian MS. Copt.e.150(P)) came to light that may end at 20:31.&lt;ref&gt;Gesa Schenke, 'Das Erscheinen Jesu vor den Jüngern und der ungläubige Thomas: Johannes 20, 19–31' in Louis Painchaud and Paul-Hubert Poirier, eds, Coptica – Gnostica – Manichaica: Mélanges offerts à Wolf-Peter Funk (Les presses de l'Université Laval / Peeters, 2006) pp. 893–904.&lt;/ref&gt; One side of this single-leaf fragment consists of John 20:30–31 with a large space under it, having no subscription.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1485">'''Kagyed''' or '''Kagyad''' is a [[Buddhist festival]] held in parts of northern [[India]], particularly [[Sikkim]]. The Kagyed dance is performed on the 28th and 29th day of the 10th month of the [[Tibetan Calendar]] which usually falls in early December. 

The Kagyed dance symbolizes destruction of the evil forces by burning effigies made of [[wood]], [[flour]], and [[paper]]. Practitioners also pray for peace and prosperity for every Sikimmese home. Annually the festival is performed by the monks at the [[Tsuklakhang Palace]] two days before Sikkimese new year.&lt;ref name="IHR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiahotelreview.com/travel-guide/gangtok/tsuklakhang--royal-chapel-and-monastery---192-716.htm|title=Tsuklakhang ─The Royal Chapel and Monastery|publisher=India Hotel Review|accessdate=November 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;The festival is typically associated with the [[Pang Lhabsol]], practised not only at Tsuklakhang Palace but at  [[Ralang Monastery]] and some other monasteries in Sikkim where earlier celebrations are held in mid September in honor of [[Mount Khangchendzonga]], and then finalized by the Kagyed in early December.

Although the dance is very serious in nature, jesters perform in between to provide [[comic relief]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.festivalsofindia.in/Kagyed-Dance/ Festivals in India]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kenan Malik''' (born 26 January 1960) is an [[India]]n-born British writer, lecturer and broadcaster, trained in [[neurobiology]] and the [[history of science]]. As an academic author, his focus is on the [[philosophy of biology]], and contemporary theories of [[multiculturalism]], [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]] and [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]. These topics are core concerns in ''The Meaning of Race'' (1996), ''Man, Beast and Zombie'' (2000) and ''Strange Fruit: Why Both Sides Are Wrong in the Race Debate'' (2008).

His work contains a forthright defence of the values of the 18th-century [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], which he sees as having been distorted and misunderstood in more recent political and scientific thought. He was shortlisted for the [[Orwell Prize]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://theorwellprize.co.uk/shortlists/kenan-malik/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gale"/&gt;

==Career==
Malik was born in [[Secunderabad]], [[Telangana]], [[India]] and brought up in [[Manchester]], England. He studied neurobiology at the [[University of Sussex]] and History of Science at [[Imperial College]], [[London]]. In between, he was a research psychologist at the Centre for Research into Perception and Cognition (CRPC) at the University of Sussex.&lt;ref name="gale"/&gt;

He has given lectures or seminars at a number of universities, including [[University of Cambridge]] (Department of Biological Anthropology); [[University of Oxford]] ([[St Antony's College, Oxford|St. Antony's College]] and the [[Oxford University Department for Continuing Education|Department for Continuing Education]]); the [[Institute of Historical Research]], London; [[Goldsmiths College, University of London]] (Department of Social Anthropology); [[University of Liverpool]] (Department of Politics); [[Nottingham Trent University]]; [[University of Newcastle upon Tyne|University of Newcastle]] (Department of Social Policy and Sociology); [[University of Oslo]]; and the [[European University Institute]], [[Florence]]. In 2003, he was a visiting fellow at the [[University of Melbourne]]. He is currently Senior Visiting Fellow at the [[University of Surrey]].

As well as being a presenter of ''Analysis'' on [[BBC Radio 4]], he has also presented ''Night Waves'', [[BBC Radio 3|Radio 3]]'s Arts and Ideas magazine. Malik has written and presented a number of TV documentaries, including ''Disunited Kingdom'' (2003), ''Are Muslims Hated?'' (which was shortlisted for the Index on Censorship Freedom of Expression award, in 2005), ''Let 'Em All In'' (2005) and ''Britain's Tribal Tensions'' (2006).

Malik has long campaigned for [[Civil rights|equal rights]], [[freedom of expression]], and a [[secularism|secular society]], and in defence of [[rationalism]] and [[humanism]] in the face of what he has called "a growing culture of irrationalism, [[mysticism]] and [[misanthropy]]".

In the 1980s, he was associated with a number of [[Marxist]] organisations, including the [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party]] (SWP) and the [[Revolutionary Communist Party (UK, 1978)|Revolutionary Communist Party]] (RCP), and [[Big Flame (political group)|Big Flame]]. He stood as the RCP's candidate in [[Birmingham Selly Oak (UK Parliament constituency)|Birmingham Selly Oak]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|general election in 1992]], coming last out of six candidates with 84 votes (0.15%). He was also involved with anti-racist campaigns including the [[Anti-Nazi League]] and East London Workers Against Racism. He helped organise street patrols in East London to protect Asian families against racist attacks and was a leading member of a number of campaigns against deportations and police brutality including the Newham 7 campaign, the [[Afia Begum|Afia Begum Campaign Against Deportations]], and the [[Colin Roach]] Campaign.

==Summary of select works==
{{BLP sources section|date=March 2010}}

===''The Meaning of Race''===

''The Meaning of Race'' examines the historical development, and philosophical and political roots, of the idea of race. It also explores the relationship between the idea of race and contemporary theories of [[multiculturalism]] and pluralism.

Malik argues that racial discourse and theories of racial difference arose in opposition to the universalist ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], and gained their plausibility from "the persistence of differences of rank, class and peoples in a society that had accepted the concept of equality." (page 70) As the nineteenth century unfolded, the politically dominant classes appropriated science (particularly [[evolution|evolutionary theory]]) to support the idea of a natural order underlying social and economic inequalities, though nothing about the dynamic of science itself necessitated racial conclusions. Thus, "the discourse of race did not arise out of the categories of Enlightenment discourse but out of the relationship between Enlightenment thought and the social organisation of capitalism." (page 225)

The idea of race applied initially to class differences within European society, but was later applied to differences between Europeans and others, "and hence became marked by colour differences." (p.&amp;nbsp;8) In the twentieth century, racial theory was largely discredited by its association with [[Nazism]], and the word "racism" entered the political vocabulary as a term of criticism, but the defeat of the Nazis led only to a recasting, not the destruction, of a belief in immutable differences among groups of human beings. This belief has been transferred to contemporary notions of culture.

As depicted by Malik, twentieth-century [[anthropology|anthropological thought]] mistakenly divided humanity into integrated, holistic cultures that must be understood as static; such cultures must not be tampered with, since the nature of their harmonious functioning requires that they must "survive intact." (page 156). Malik sees this tendency in anthropology as another expression, along with the idea of race, of "a particularist, relativist, and anti-humanist philosophy" that has rejected Enlightenment universalism. (page 7) He opposes the "politics of difference" – the identification of competing social groups based on shared history and a sense of identity – believing it sets back the struggle for political and economic equality. The final chapters of ''The Meaning of Race'' contain a critique of [[postmodernism|postmodernist]] and [[poststructuralism|poststructuralist]] theories, including the views of [[Edward Said]]. Here, Malik argues that such theories misinterpret the relationship between the West and other cultures, and are detrimental to the possibility of social equality. In its essence, Malik argues, postmodernism is defeatist – it is prepared to accept a place for marginalised groups within society without demanding true equality.

===''Man, Beast and Zombie''===

''Man, Beast and Zombie'' investigates the historical roots, philosophical assumptions and alleged [[Methodology|methodological]] problems of contemporary theories of human nature, in particular [[evolutionary psychology]] and [[cognitive science]]. He argues that, "The triumph of mechanistic explanations of human nature is as much the consequence of our culture's loss of nerve as it is of scientific advance." (pages 13–14) While rejecting epistemic relativism, with its denial of an objective truth about the world, Malik insists that scientific theories of human nature are, in practice, shaped by cultural influences, as well as being responsive to data. He argues that the scientific study of human nature has been distorted by post-war cultural pessimism. In examining evolutionary psychology and related theories, Malik distinguishes between these theories, which he sees as a form of universal Darwinism (attributing explanatory power to Darwinian theory in a wide range of domains), and the work of "circumspect Darwinists" (who are cautious about its explanatory power) (197).

Though Malik sees human beings as a product of [[evolution]], and that universal Darwinist theories have merit when applied to non-human animals – and perhaps ''some'' merit when applied to [[human behaviour]] – he is sceptical about how far they can be applied to human beings. In particular, theories of a biologically-evolved human nature cannot, alone, account for the transformations of behaviour that arose from our immersion in a [[symbol]]ic world built up out of [[language]] and [[culture|culturally]]-meaningful relationships. Thus, "the scientific tools with which we investigate animal behaviour are inadequate for understanding human behaviour" (p.&amp;nbsp;231).

In discussing cognitive science and philosophy of mind, Malik concludes that each human being possesses "an ''extended'' mind"; a brain becomes a human mind only by its immersion in social relationships together with "other brains linked by language and culture." (p.&amp;nbsp;331) Human meaning derives not from nature but from the language-linked social network of which we are part." (p. 334) If we did succeed in creating a machine capable of participating in a human society like a human being, it would be human (334–35).

In the final chapter of ''Man, Beast and Zombie'', Malik laments what he sees as an increasing reluctance to view individual people as autonomous, rational, and competent agents, and a tendency to view them as damaged, weak, incapable, and possessing limited control over their fates. All this has both encouraged and been reinforced by what Malik sees as mechanistic accounts of human nature. It has been accompanied by a shift of emphasis from negative liberty to positive liberties and paternalistic protections, and by an acceptance of limits to human possibilities and a deference to "nature" – all in marked contrast to the spirit of Enlightenment humanism.

===''Strange Fruit''===
''Strange Fruit: Why Both Sides Are Wrong in the Race Debate'' (Oneworld, 2008) is a book focusing on the anti-enlightenment dichotomy of racial science and anti-racism and critiques both. Malik argues that racial scientists should be allowed to express their views publicly and be critiqued in the public domain, while also criticising censorship from traditional anti-racist organisations. Most of the book focuses on science and race, and whether race can tell us anything about humans&amp;nbsp;– he argues for a third way. He argues that 'race' may be a poor man's clue to many things like genetic disease in populations, but that this does not have anything to do with 'race' in and of itself. He also argues that 'race' may be an obvious indicator of populations of genetics within multi-ethnic countries, but it is not exclusive to 'races' as a whole.{{clarification needed|date=June 2017|reason=the antecedent of 'it' is unclear (grammatically it would seem to be "race" - which makes no sense); phrase "populations of genetics" also puzzling}}

The book also critiques multicultural paradigms about identity and cultural inheritance. Malik concludes that 'race' is not a biological concept and is useless as a way to separate people and he says that it is not just ignorant racial scientists that perpetuate this myth, it is anti-racists too.

===''From Fatwa to Jihad: The Rushdie Affair and Its Legacy''===
''From Fatwa to Jihad'' was released to coincide with the 20th anniversary of the [[Fatwa on Salman Rushdie|Fatwa]] placed on [[Salman Rushdie|Rushdie]]. In his analysis Malik documents the events surrounding the Bradford protests, the fatwa, the riots in India and the government and media response. Malik also explores the life of immigration from the Indian subcontinent to Britain and how that has shaped modern British-Asian identity. He also documents and critiques the rise of state multiculturalism and the long-term effects on cities like Birmingham. Coupled with an analysis of the culture of self-censorship and fear of today's media, the book provides an account of the fatwa's present-day impact.

'''Kent Bach''' (born 1943) is an [[American philosopher]] and Professor of Philosophy at [[San Francisco State University]]. His primary areas of research include the [[philosophy of language]], [[linguistics]] and [[epistemology]]. He is the author of three books: ''Exit-existentialism: A philosophy of self-awareness'', ''Linguistic Communication and Speech Acts'', and ''Thought and Reference'' published by Wadsworth, the MIT Press, and Oxford University Press, respectively.

==Philosophy of language==
{{BLP sources section|date=November 2016}}
Bach's writings in the philosophy of language have tended to focus on the problems and puzzles that arise from so-called [[propositional attitude]] attributions, in particular belief attributions. Such attributions (or ''reports'') take the form ''A believes that p'' where ''A'' is the subject to whom a belief is attributed and ''p'' represents the [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]], [[proposition]] (or, more vaguely still, ''content'')  that is supposed to be believed by ''A''.

In ''A Puzzle About Belief Reports'' and ''Do Belief Reports Report Beliefs?'', Bach argues that there is a false assumption underlying all of the traditional forms of explanation of the nature of belief reports: they all implicitly endorse something that he refers to as the ''Specification Assumption''. This is basically the idea that the "that"- clauses of belief reports ("that William will take the train tomorrow", "that the sun will rise tomorrow morning") specify (i.e. directly refer to) propositions (or sentences) that the believer believes. Bach suggests that "that"-clauses do not specify but merely "describe" or "characterize" what a person believes.

He argues his thesis by first invoking several classic puzzles which have confounded philosophers of language since the time of [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]]. The first type of puzzle is a variation on the classic problem of the substitution of co-referential terms in the context of attitude attributions. A simple illustration is the following pair of sentences:

#''Lois Lane believes that Clark Kent is a wimp''. 
#''Lois Lane believes that Superman is a wimp''.

The simple substitution of one co-referring term for another would seem to transform the [[truth-value]] (and hence the content) of the sentence from true to false. But this should be impossible if we are faithful to a few simple and reasonable assumptions that are commonly accepted among philosophers: [[direct reference]], [[compositionality|semantic compositionality]] and ''semantic innocence''. Direct reference is the principle that singular terms contribute their referents to the propositions expressed by the sentences which contain them. Compositionality is the ideas that the meaning of a composite expression is derived from the parts which make it up. Semantic innocence is the principle that "embedding" a term or name in a "that" clause should not change its semantic value.

Given these basic assumptions how is it possible that the truth value of a sentence in the context of an attribution can change - that is, how is [[semantic opacity]] possible? Bach sketches four historical approaches to the resolving the problem and demonstrates each of their inadequacies. The first approach is that of Frege himself. Frege claimed that the reference of a term in the context of a belief report (or any other attitude attribution) was no longer its "customary" reference but rather its sense (see [[sense and reference]]). While this proposal maintains compositionality, however, it obviously violates the aforementioned principle of semantic innocence. Terms do not have the same reference in attitude attribution contexts that they do in ordinary sentence contexts. Bach illustrates ''why'' this is a problem by providing an example sentence that involves [[Anaphora (linguistics)|anaphora]] and that leads to serious problems for the Fregean view:

:(An)''Lois Lane believes that Clark Kent is a wimp, but he is not''.

Here, the pronoun ''he'' is being used, as linguists say, anaphorically: its meaning is derived from the proper name which it is standing in for (in this case, ''Clark Kent''). It seems clear, then, that the "he" used in this sentence refers (and quite directly) to Clark Kent. Frege's theory would predict that it refers to the ''name'' Clark Kent, the ''sense'' of the term in the terminology of Frege. Consequently, Frege's theory "denies semantic innocence" and this makes it ring somewhat counterintuitive.

Bach next considers what he calls, the ''metalinguistic'' or ''sententialist'' view. On this view, a sentence embedded in a "that"-clause refers to some sort of sentence, whether the sentence itself or a sentence in some [[language of thought]] depends on the specifics of the theory. However that may be, this view also violates the principle of semantic innocence: the referents of terms change from ordinary contexts (where they are objects in the external world) to attitude report contexts (where they are linguistic items. Hence, it has the same problem as Frege's, as well as several others.

The so-called ''hidden indexical'' theory maintains that the difference in truth value (and content) between sentences ''1'' and ''2'' above has nothing to do with what they say about ''what'' Lois Lane believes, but with what they implicitly say about ''how'' she believes it.  The two sentences do not differ in their contents, the singular proposition expressed by the statement that Superman/Clark Kent is a wimp, but by some implicitly referred to way of taking the proposition. In Bach's view this approach violates the principle of compositionality. There is no syntactical place in the sentence ''A believes that G is F'' for some "unarticulated constituent" or "hidden indexical". He also points out that sentences such as "Joe is ready" and "Fred has finished", which are missing an argument, are not necessarily sentences that express propositions with unarticulated constituents. They may simply be semantically incomplete and hence not express propositions at all.

The last position that Bach considers is the so-called ''neo-Russelian'' theory. Neo-Russelians attempt to solve the problem by rejecting the "anti-substitution intuition". They insist that sentences such as ''1'' and ''2'' actually have the same contents and that there is no transformation in truth values at all. Similarly, if ''the Joker realizes that Bruce Wayne is rich'' is true, then it is also true that ''the Joker realizes that Batman is rich''; if ''the Joker doubts that Bruce Wayne is a threat'' is true, then so is the statement that ''the Joker doubts that Batman is a threat'' and so forth. These consequences make the neo-Rusellian theory seem extremely awkward and counterintuitive.

Bach's own, alternative solution is to reject the Specification Assumption discussed at the beginning. 
He further illustrates the problems associated with this assumption by way of another famous philosophical puzzle: [[Saul Kripke|Kripke's]] ''Paderewski'' puzzle, which does not involve substitution.

:(a)''Peter believes that Paderewski had musical talent''.
:(b)''Peter disbelieves that Paderewski had musical talent''.

Kripke's puzzle arises from the fact that Peter takes [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski|Paderewski]] to be two different individuals: one a statesman and the other a pianist. In fact, they are one and the same person. According to Bach's ''descriptivist'' view, sentence ''a'' here ''describes'' Peter as believing something and sentence ''b'' describes him as believing something else. Since the "that"-clauses do not specify what the two things are that Peter believes (they do not refer to one specific object), then they are not necessarily the same thing. The condition for the truth of a belief report is that the believer must believe ''something'' such that the proposition expressed by the "that" clause turns out to be true.

Attempts have been made to resolve the Paderewski puzzle by suggesting that the "that"-clauses involved are not sufficiently specific and that if all contextually relevant information were provided in detail, then we could eventually determine exactly what it is that Peter believes and disbelieves. However, as Bach shows, this leads to an infinite regress. We could add information to the sentences ''a'' and ''b'' which further specifies that ''Peter believes that Paderewski "the pianist" has musical talent'' and ''Peter disbelieves that Paderewski "the statesman" has musical talent''. But let us suppose that Peter hears a recording of Paderewski playing Mozart and is impressed with the performance. Later, he hears a recording of Paderewski playing Keith Jarret and is disgusted by the performance. Given that we have the same individual Paderewski and that Peter still does not know that it is the same individual in the two cases, we would have to say that ''Peter believes that Paderewski the "classical pianist" has musical talent'' and that ''Peter disbelieves that Paderewski the "jazz pianist" has musical talent''. This specification might not suffice either. Suppose that Peter now hears Paderewski play Beethoven and is not impressed. We would have to say ''Peter believes that Paderewki "the classical pianist playing Mozart"...".
As Bach puts it, "[that clauses] are not inherently capable of specifying their contents fully".&lt;ref&gt;Kent Bach, "A Puzzle about Belief Reports" (1997){{cite web|url=http://online.sfsu.edu/kbach/puzzle.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his paper, ''Content Ex Machina'' Bach argues against over-interpreting what he labels the "contextualist platitude" which he defines as: “Generally what a speaker means in uttering a sentence, even if the sentence is devoid of ambiguity, vagueness, or indexicality, goes beyond what the sentence means.” &lt;ref name="Content"&gt;title=Content Ex Machina. Semantic vs. Pragmatics, ed. Zoltan Gendler Szabo.&lt;/ref&gt; Bach asserts that context does not establish meaning but is merely one of several conversational principles. He states that “context does not determine (in the sense of constitute), but merely enables the hearer to determine (in the sense of ascertain) what the speaker means.” &lt;ref name="Content"/&gt;  Context provides constraints on what a speaker can reasonably mean and on what a hearer can reasonably interpret a speaker to mean. “contextualist platitude” does not preclude the “older picture of language and communication” and “a fairly standard semantic-pragmatic distinction.” Pragmatic considerations and context do not contribute to the content of what is said. Bach admits that there is meaning in utterances beyond the semantic content of a sentence, but he maintains that context does not determine speaker meaning but rather constrains how a speaker can expect to be understood and helps the hearer understand what is said. “We need the level of locutionary act and, correlatively, a strict, semantic notion of what is said in order to account for (the content of) what a speaker does in uttering a sentence independently of whatever communicative intention (if any) he has in uttering it and regardless of how the content of that intention may depart from the semantic content of the sentence.” &lt;ref name="Content"/&gt;

==Reliabilism==
In his paper, "A Rationale for Reliabilism," Bach weighs in on the debate between [[Internalism and externalism|internalist and externalist]] theories of justification by introducing a distinction between justified ''belief'' and justified ''believers.''&lt;ref&gt;Kent Bach, "A Rationale for Reliabilism," ''The Monist'' (1985). http://userwww.sfsu.edu/kbach/ratrel.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bach, “a belief can be justified even in the absence of any action on the part of the believer, as in the case of beliefs formed automatically or routinely without any deliberate consideration;” whereas “a person is justified in believing something to the extent that he holds the belief rationally and responsibly.”&lt;ref&gt;Bach, "A Rationale for Reliabilism", 251.&lt;/ref&gt; On this view, the root of the debate over what constitutes justification between internalists and externalists is that internalists are interested in what makes a believer justified and externalists are concerned with what makes a belief justified.

Bach argues that the reasoning method employed by humans is ''default reasoning'', which is to say that when humans reason, many steps in their reasoning are taken by default- i.e. they are “based on some generalization or stereotype which is overridden only if there occurs the thought of an alternative or of a reason to the contrary.”&lt;ref&gt;Bach, "A Rationale for Reliabilism," 254.&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of this would be seeing an apple on the table. Bach would argue that, under normal circumstances, the belief “there is an apple on the table” will be formed without reflection on the process by which that belief was formed since the reasoning process of the agent that sees the apple is working under the assumption that seeing something means it is there. Given this, Bach holds that the internalist is expecting too much for a belief to be justified, since expecting reasoning to be evaluated in every step would mean denying justification to the large majority of beliefs since they are formed via default reasoning. Bach therefore holds that if internalism cannot provide a solid argument against the default reasoning model of human cognition, then they must be satisfied in defining what a justified ''believer'' is, leaving the question of justified ''belief'' to the externalist.

Bach presents his own theory as to what constitutes justified belief which he calls the “taking-for-granted principle.” This principle holds that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;it appearing to one that ''p'' justifies directly inferring that ''p'' provided that (a) it does not occur to one that the situation might be out of the ordinary, and (b) it probably would occur to one that the situation might be out of the ordinary.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bach, "Rationale," 259.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bach versus Fodor==
In his ''Review of Concepts: Where Cognitive Science Went Wrong'', Bach takes [[Jerry Fodor]] to task for his criticisms of [[lexical semantics]] and [[polysemy]]. Fodor claims that there is no lexical structure to such verbs as "keep", "get", "make" and "put". He suggests that, alternatively, "keep" simply expresses the concept KEEP (Fodor capitalizes concepts to distinguish them from properties, names or other such entities). If there is a straightforward one-to-one mapping between individual words and concepts, "keep your clothes on"*, "keep your receipt" and "keep washing your hands" will all share the same concept of KEEP under Fodor's theory. This concept presumably locks on to the unique external property of keeping. But, if this is true, then RETAIN must pick out a different property in RETAIN YOUR RECEIPT, since one can't retain one's clothes or retain washing one's hands. Fodor's theory also has a problem explaining how the concept FAST contributes, ''differently'', to the contents of FAST CAR, FAST DRIVER, FAST TRACK, and FAST TIME. Whether or not the differing interpretations of "fast" in these sentences are specified in the semantics of English, or are the result of [[pragmatics|pragmatic]] inference, is a matter of debate.

What makes Fodor's view of concepts extremely difficult to digest for many critics is simply his insistence that such a large, perhaps implausible, number of them are primitive and undefinable. For example, Fodor considers such concepts as BACHELOR, EFFECT, ISLAND, TRAPEZOID, VIXEN, and WEEK to be all primitive, innate and unanalyzable because they all fall into the category of what he calls "lexical concepts" (those for which our language has a single word). Against this view, Bach argues that the concept VIXEN is almost certainly composed out of the concepts FEMALE and FOX, BACHELOR out of SINGLE and MALE, and so on.

Retrieved 3 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; His teacher, [[Bertrand Russell]], described Wittgenstein as "the most perfect example I have ever known of genius as traditionally conceived; passionate, profound, intense, and dominating".{{sfn|McGuinness|1988|p=118}}

Born in [[Vienna]] into one of Europe's richest families, he inherited a fortune from his father in 1913. He initially made some donations to artists and writers and then, in a period of severe personal depression after the First World War, he gave away his entire fortune to his brothers and sisters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goethe.de/ges/phi/prt/en2341144.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110302195044/http://www.goethe.de/ges/phi/prt/en2341144.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2 March 2011 |quote=When his father died in 1913 and Ludwig inherited a considerable fortune...

Random House of Canada, 2008, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; He described philosophy as "the only work that gives me real satisfaction".&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, (Additional note) p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

His philosophy is often divided into an early period, exemplified by the ''Tractatus'', and a later period, articulated in the ''Philosophical Investigations''. The early Wittgenstein was concerned with the logical relationship between propositions and the world and believed that by providing an account of the logic underlying this relationship, he had solved all philosophical problems. The later Wittgenstein rejected many of the assumptions of the ''Tractatus'', arguing that the meaning of words is best understood as their use within a given [[language-game]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philosophy.uchicago.edu/faculty/files/conant/Ian%20Proops%20The%20New%20Wittgenstein%20A%20Critique.pdf|title=PDF|publisher=|accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey among American university and college teachers ranked the ''Investigations'' as the most important book of 20th-century philosophy, standing out as "the one crossover masterpiece in twentieth-century philosophy, appealing across diverse specializations and philosophical orientations."&lt;ref name="here"&gt;Lackey, Douglas [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/0031-806X.00022/abstract?

He doubted he would be better understood in the future. He once said he felt as though he was writing for people who would think in a different way, breathe a different air of life, from that of present-day men."&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"&gt;Malcolm, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===The Wittgensteins===
{{Further|Karl Wittgenstein}}
[[File:Karl Wittgenstein.jpg|right|thumb|[[Karl Wittgenstein]] was one of the richest men in Europe.&lt;ref name=Bramann/&gt;|235x235px]]
According to a family tree prepared in Jerusalem after World War II, Wittgenstein's paternal great-great-grandfather was Moses Meier,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wittgensteinchronology.com/4.html|title=Wittgenstein Family History - Ludwig Wittgenstein: A Chronology of his Life and Work|last=Preston|first=John|website=www.wittgensteinchronology.com|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Ashkenazi Jews|Jewish]] land agent who lived with his wife, Brendel Simon, in [[Bad Laasphe]] in the [[Siegen-Wittgenstein|Principality of Wittgenstein]], Westphalia.&lt;ref&gt;See [[:de:Schloss Wittgenstein|Schloss Wittgenstein]]. Various sources spell Meier's name Maier and Meyer.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1808, [[Napoleon]] issued a decree that everyone, including Jews, must adopt an inheritable [[Jewish surname|family surname]], and so Meier's son, also Moses, took the name of his employers, the [[Sayn-Wittgenstein]]s, and became Moses Meier Wittgenstein.&lt;ref&gt;Bartley, pp. 199–200.&lt;/ref&gt; His son, Hermann Christian Wittgenstein—who took the middle name "Christian" to distance himself from his Jewish background—married Fanny Figdor, also Jewish, who converted to [[Protestantism]] just before they married, and the couple founded a successful business trading in wool in Leipzig.{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=4-5}} Ludwig's grandmother Fanny was a first cousin of the famous violinist [[Joseph Joachim]].{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=5}}

They had 11 children—among them Wittgenstein's father. Karl Otto Clemens Wittgenstein (1847–1913) became an industrial tycoon, and by the late 1880s was one of the richest men in Europe, with an effective monopoly on Austria's steel cartel.&lt;ref name="Bramann"&gt;Bramann, Jorn K. and Moran, John. [http://faculty.frostburg.edu/phil/forum/KarlWittgenstein.htm "Karl Wittgenstein, Business Tycoon and Art Patron"], Frostburg State University. Retrieved 2 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated63"&gt;Edmonds, Eidinow 2001, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks to Karl, the Wittgensteins became the second wealthiest family in the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], only behind the [[Rothschild family|Rothschilds]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated63"/&gt;  Karl Wittgenstein was viewed as the Austrian equivalent of [[Andrew Carnegie]], with whom he was friends, and was one of the wealthiest men in the world by the 1890s.&lt;ref name="Bramann"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;   As a result of his decision in 1898 to invest substantially in the Netherlands and in Switzerland as well as overseas, particularly in the US, the family was to an extent shielded from the hyperinflation that hit Austria in 1922.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=7}} However, their wealth diminished due to post-1918 hyperinflation and subsequently during the [[Great Depression]], although even as late as 1938 they owned 13 mansions in Vienna alone.&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds, Eidinow 2001, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wittgenstein's mother was Leopoldine Maria Josefa Kalmus, known among friends as Poldi. Her father was a [[Czechs|Bohemian]] [[Jew]] and her mother was [[Austria]]n-[[Slovenes|Slovene]] [[Catholic]]—she was Wittgenstein's only non-Jewish grandparent.&lt;ref&gt;Ranjit Chatterjee, ''Wittgenstein and Judaism: A Triumph of Concealment'', 2005, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/04/06/a-nervous-splendor|title=A Nervous Splendor|first=Anthony|last=Gottlieb|date=30 March 2009|publisher=|accessdate=16 February 2018|via=www.newyorker.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|McGuinness|1988}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mt.ccnmtl.columbia.edu/schenker/profile/person/wittgenstein_leopold.html|title=Wittgenstein, Leopoldine (Schenker Documents Online)|website=mt.ccnmtl.columbia.edu|accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was an aunt of the Nobel Prize laureate [[Friedrich Hayek]] on her maternal side. Wittgenstein was born at 8:30 pm on 26 April 1889 in the so-called "Wittgenstein Palace" at Alleegasse 16, now the Argentinierstrasse, near the [[Karlskirche]].&lt;ref&gt;For his mother's Roman Catholic background, see [http://www.wittgen-cam.ac.uk/cgi-bin/text/biogre1.html "Ludwig Wittgenstein: Background"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218032638/http://www.wittgen-cam.ac.uk/cgi-bin/text/biogre1.html |date=18 December 2008 }}, Wittgenstein archive, University of Cambridge.

* For his time and place of birth, see Edmonds, David and John Eidinow. ''Wittgenstein's Poker''. Faber and Faber, 2001, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Karl and Poldi had nine children in all. There were four girls: Hermine, [[Margaret Stonborough-Wittgenstein|Margaret]] (Gretl), Helene, and a fourth daughter Dora who died as a baby; and five boys: Johannes (Hans), Kurt, Rudolf (Rudi), [[Paul Wittgenstein|Paul]]—who became a concert pianist despite losing an arm in [[World War I]]—and Ludwig, who was the youngest of the family.&lt;ref name=Bartley16&gt;Bartley, William Warren. ''Wittgenstein''. Open Court, 1994, p. 16, first published 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

The children were baptized as Catholics, received formal Catholic instruction, and were raised in an exceptionally intense environment.&lt;ref name=MW&gt;[[Norman Malcolm]], [[Peter Winch]], ''Wittgenstein: A Religious Point of View?'', Cornell University Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; The family was at the center of Vienna's cultural life; [[Bruno Walter]] described the life at the Wittgensteins' palace as an "all-pervading atmosphere of humanity and culture."{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=8}} Karl was a leading patron of the arts, commissioning works by [[Auguste Rodin]] and financing the city's exhibition hall and art gallery, the [[Secession hall (Austria)|Secession Building]].

For Wittgenstein, who highly valued precision and discipline, [[contemporary music]] was never considered acceptable at all. "Music," he said to his friend Drury in 1930, "came to a full stop with [[Brahms]]; and even in Brahms I can begin to hear the noise of machinery."&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Redpath, Ludwig Wittgenstein: A Student's Memoir, London: Duckworth, 1990, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; Ludwig Wittgenstein himself had [[absolute pitch]],&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds, Eidinow 2001, pp=157&lt;/ref&gt; and his devotion to music remained vitally important to him throughout his life: he made frequent use of musical examples and metaphors in his philosophical writings, and was unusually adept at whistling lengthy and detailed musical passages.{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=442-443}} He also learnt to play the [[clarinet]] in his thirties.&lt;ref name=Monk15/&gt; A fragment of music (three bars), composed by Wittgenstein, was discovered in one of his 1931 notebooks, by [[Michael Nedo]], Director of the Wittgenstein Institute in Cambridge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/img/doi/1450-9814/2005/1450-98140505393H.pdf "Three Bars by Wittgenstein"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714153847/http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/img/doi/1450-9814/2005/1450-98140505393H.pdf |date=14 July 2014 }} by Eric Heijerman, ''Muzikologija'', 2005 (5): pp. 393–395.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family temperament and the brothers' suicides===
[[Ray Monk]] writes that Karl's aim was to turn his sons into captains of industry; they were not sent to school lest they acquire bad habits, but were educated at home to prepare them for work in Karl's industrial empire.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=11}} Three of the five brothers would later commit suicide.&lt;ref name="Kenny"&gt;Kenny, Anthony.

* Also see [http://www.wittgen-cam.ac.uk/ "Ludwig Wittgenstein: Background"], Wittgenstein archive, University of Cambridge. Retrieved 7 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychiatrist [[Michael Fitzgerald (psychiatrist)|Michael Fitzgerald]] argues that Karl was a harsh perfectionist who lacked empathy, and that Wittgenstein's mother was anxious and insecure, unable to stand up to her husband.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald"&gt;Fitzgerald, Michael. [http://www.springerlink.com/content/wd1bk8fkp4ru6xvy/ "Did Ludwig Wittgenstein have Asperger's syndrome?"],
''European Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry'', volume 9, number 1, pp. 61–65. {{doi|10.1007/s007870050117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johannes Brahms said of the family, whom he visited regularly: "They seemed to act towards one another as if they were at court."&lt;ref name="autogenerated63"/&gt; The family appeared to have a strong streak of depression running through it. [[Anthony Gottlieb]] tells a story about Paul practicing on one of the pianos in the Wittgensteins' main family mansion, when he suddenly shouted at Ludwig in the next room: "I cannot play when you are in the house, as I feel your scepticism seeping towards me from under the door!"&lt;ref name="Gottlieb"&gt;Gottlieb, Anthony.

The family Palace housed seven grand pianos&lt;ref&gt;Waugh p.38.&lt;/ref&gt; and each of the siblings pursued music "with an enthusiasm that, at times, bordered on the pathological."&lt;ref&gt;Waugh p.10.&lt;/ref&gt; The eldest brother, Hans, was hailed as a musical prodigy. At the age of four, writes [[Alexander Waugh]], Hans could identify the [[Doppler effect]] in a passing siren as a quarter-tone drop in pitch, and at five started crying "Wrong! Wrong!" when two brass bands in a carnival played the same tune in different [[Key signature|keys]]. But he died in mysterious circumstances in May 1902, when he ran away to America and disappeared from a boat in [[Chesapeake Bay]], most likely having committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Waugh, pp. 24–26.
* Also see Monk, p. 11ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years later, aged 22 and studying chemistry at the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Berlin Academy]], the third eldest brother, Rudi, committed suicide in a Berlin bar. He had asked the pianist to play [[Thomas Koschat]]'s "Verlassen, verlassen, verlassen bin ich" ("Forsaken, forsaken, forsaken am I"),&lt;ref&gt;For the Koschat song, see {{YouTube|QLMBkWWavJo|"Verlassen bin ich"}}. Retrieved 11 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; before mixing himself a drink of milk and [[potassium cyanide]]. He had left several suicide notes, one to his parents that said he was grieving over the death of a friend, and another that referred to his "perverted disposition". It was reported at the time that he had sought advice from the [[Scientific-Humanitarian Committee]], an organization that was campaigning against [[Paragraph 175]] of the German Criminal Code, which prohibited homosexual sex. His father forbade the family from ever mentioning his name again.&lt;ref&gt;Waugh, pp. 22–23.

The second eldest brother, Kurt, an officer and company director, shot himself on 27 October 1918 at the end of World War I, when the Austrian troops he was commanding refused to obey his orders and deserted ''en masse''.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=11}} According to Gottlieb, Hermine had said Kurt seemed to carry "...the germ of disgust for life within himself."&lt;ref&gt;Waugh, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; Later Wittgenstein wrote: "I ought to have... become a star in the sky. Instead of which I have remained stuck on earth."{{sfn|McGuinness|1988|p=156}}

==1903–1906: Realschule in Linz==

===Realschule in Linz===
[[File:Realschule in Linz.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''[[Realschule]]'' in Linz]]
Wittgenstein was taught by private tutors at home until he was fourteen years old. Subsequently, for three years, he attended a school. After the deaths of Hans and Rudi, Karl relented, and allowed Paul and Ludwig to be sent to school. Waugh writes that it was too late for Wittgenstein to pass his exams for the more academic [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] in Wiener Neustadt; having had no formal schooling, he failed his entrance exam and only barely managed after extra tutoring to pass the exam for the more technically oriented [[k.u.k.]] [[Realschule]] in [[Linz]], a small state school with 300 pupils.&lt;ref name="Waugh33"&gt;Waugh, p. 33.
* McGuinness, Brian. ''Wittgenstein: a life : young Ludwig 1889–1921''. University of California Press, 1988, p. 51ff.
* K.u.k. stood for "[[Kaiserlich und königlich]]".
* The successor institution to the ''Realschule'' in Linz is [[Bundesrealgymnasium Linz Fadingerstraße]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1903, when he was 14, he began his three years of formal schooling there, lodging nearby in term time with the family of Dr. Josef Strigl, a teacher at the local gymnasium, the family giving him the nickname Luki.{{sfn|McGuinness|1988|p=51}}&lt;ref name="Sandgruber"&gt;Sandgruber, Roman. [http://www.nachrichten.at/oberoesterreich/serien/wir-oberoesterreicher/Das-Geld-der-Wittgenstein;art11547,561859 "Das Geld der Wittgenstein"],"Oberösterreichische Nachrichten". 26 February 2011. Linz 2011. Retrieved 5 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

On starting at the Realschule, Wittgenstein had been moved forward a year.{{sfn|McGuinness|1988|p=51}} Historian [[Brigitte Hamann]] writes that he stood out from the other boys: he spoke an unusually pure form of [[High German]] with a stutter, dressed elegantly, and was sensitive and unsociable.&lt;ref name=Hamann15&gt;Hamann, Brigitte and Thornton, Thomas. ''Hitler's Vienna: A Dictator's Apprenticeship''. Oxford University Press, 2000 (first published 1996 in German), pp. 15–16, 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Monk writes that the other boys made fun of him, singing after him: "''Wittgenstein wandelt wehmütig widriger Winde wegen Wienwärts''"&lt;ref name=Monk15&gt;Monk, pp.14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Monk can only be used as a source for the original German because this is incorrectly translated by Monk as "Wittgenstein wends his woeful windy way Vienna-wards"--&gt; ("Wittgenstein strolls wistfully Vienna-wards due to adverse winds"). In his leaving certificate, he received a top mark (5) in religious studies; a 2 for conduct and English, 3 for French, geography, history, mathematics and physics, and 4 for German, chemistry, geometry and freehand drawing.{{sfn|McGuinness|1988|p=51}} He had particular difficulty with spelling and failed his written German exam because of it. He wrote in 1931: "My bad spelling in youth, up to the age of about 18 or 19, is connected with the whole of the rest of my character (my weakness in study)."{{sfn|McGuinness|1988|p=51}}

===Faith===
Wittgenstein was baptized as an infant by a Catholic priest and received formal instruction in Catholic doctrine as a child, as was common at the time.&lt;ref name=MW/&gt; In an interview, his sister Gretl Stonborough-Wittgenstein says that their grandfather's "strong, severe, partly ascetic Christianity" was a strong influence on all the Wittgenstein children.&lt;ref&gt;Stonborough-Wittgenstein, Gretl. Reviewed in Portraits of Wittgenstein, Flowers &amp; Ground&lt;/ref&gt;  It was while he was at the ''Realschule'' that he decided he had lost his faith in God and became an [[atheist]].&lt;ref name=Monk18&gt;Monk, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; He nevertheless believed in the importance of the idea of [[confession]]. He wrote in his diaries about having made a major confession to his oldest sister, Hermine, while he was at the ''Realschule''; Monk speculates that it may have been about his loss of faith. He also discussed it with Gretl, his other sister, who directed him to [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]''.&lt;ref name=Monk18/&gt; As a teenager, Wittgenstein adopted Schopenhauer's epistemological idealism. However, after his study of the philosophy of mathematics, he abandoned epistemological idealism for [[Gottlob Frege]]'s conceptual realism.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"/&gt; In later years, Wittgenstein was highly dismissive of Schopenhauer, describing him as an ultimately "shallow" thinker: "Schopenhauer has quite a crude mind ... where real depth starts, his comes to an end."&lt;ref&gt;''Culture and Value'', 1933-4, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Wittgenstein's religious faith and his relationship with Christianity and religion, in general (for which he professed a sincere and devoted reverence{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}) would change over time, much like his philosophical ideas. In 1912, Wittgenstein wrote to Russell saying that Mozart and Beethoven were the actual sons of God.{{sfn|McGuinness|2008|p=34}} However, Wittgenstein resisted formal religion, saying it was hard for him to "bend the knee",&lt;ref&gt;Portraits of Wittgenstein, 113&lt;/ref&gt; though his grandfather's beliefs continued to influence Wittgenstein—as he famously said, "I cannot help seeing every problem from a religious point of view".&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein, Ludwig, reviewed in Wittgenstein's Religious Point of View, Tim Labron&lt;/ref&gt; Wittgenstein referred to [[Augustine of Hippo]] in his ''Philosophical Investigations.'' Philosophically, Wittgenstein's thought shows fundamental alignment with religious discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce R. Ashford, "Wittgenstein's Theologians: A Survey of Ludwig Wittgenstein's Impact on Theology"&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Wittgenstein would become one of the century's fiercest critics of [[Scientism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Monk|first1=Ray|title=Wittgenstein's Forgotten Lesson|url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/regulars/ray-monk-wittgenstein|accessdate=24 August 2014|work=Prospect Magazine|issue=July 1999|publisher=Prospect Magazine|date=20 July 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With age, a deepening personal spirituality led to several elucidations and clarifications, as he untangled language problems in religion, attacking, for example, the temptation to think of God's existence as a matter of scientific evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Wittgenstein, "Lectures on Religious Belief"&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, finding it more difficult to work, he wrote, "I have had a letter from an old friend in Austria, a priest. In it he says that he hopes my work will go well, if it should be God's will. Now that is all I want: if it should be God's will."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Rush Rhees, "Ludwig Wittgenstein: Personal Recollections"&lt;/ref&gt; In Wittgenstein's ''Culture and Value'', he writes, "Is what I am doing [my work in philosophy] really worth the effort? Yes, but only if a light shines on it from above." His close friend [[Norman Malcolm]] would write, "Wittgenstein’s mature life was strongly marked by religious thought and feeling. I am inclined to think that he was more deeply religious than are many people who correctly regard themselves as religious believers."&lt;ref&gt;Norman Malcolm, "Wittgenstein: A Religious Point of View"&lt;/ref&gt; At last, Wittgenstein writes, "Bach wrote on the title page of his ''[[Orgelbüchlein]]'', ‘To the glory of the most high God, and that my neighbour may be benefited thereby.’  That is what I would have liked to say about my work."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Influence of Otto Weininger===
[[File:OttoWeiningerspring1903.jpg|thumb|upright|Austrian philosopher [[Otto Weininger]] (1880–1903)]]
While a student at the ''Realschule'', Wittgenstein was influenced by Austrian philosopher [[Otto Weininger]]'s 1903 book ''Geschlecht und Charakter'' (''[[Sex and Character]]'').
Weininger (1880–1903), who was also Jewish, argued that the concepts male and female exist only as [[Platonic realism|Platonic forms]], and that Jews tend to embody the platonic femininity. Whereas men are basically rational, women operate only at the level of their emotions and sexual organs. Jews, Weininger argued, are similar, saturated with femininity, with no sense of right and wrong, and no soul. Weininger argues that man must choose between his masculine and feminine sides, consciousness and unconsciousness, Platonic love and sexuality. Love and sexual desire stand in contradiction, and love between a woman and a man is therefore doomed to misery or immorality. The only life worth living is the spiritual one—to live as a woman or a Jew means one has no right to live at all; the choice is genius or death. Weininger committed suicide, shooting himself in 1903, shortly after publishing the book.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=19-26}} Many years later, as a professor at Cambridge, Wittgenstein distributed copies of Weininger's book to his bemused academic colleagues. He said that Weininger's arguments were wrong, but that it was the way they were wrong that was interesting.&lt;ref&gt;p216, Philosophical Tales, Cohen, M., Blackwell 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter dated 23 August 1931, Wittgenstein wrote the following to [[G. E. Moore]];&lt;blockquote&gt;Dear Moore,&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Thanks for your letter. I can quite imagine that you don’t admire Weininger very much, what with that beastly translation and the fact that W. must feel very foreign to you. It is true that he is fantastic but he is great and fantastic. It isn’t necessary or rather not possible to agree with him but the greatness lies in that with which we disagree. It is his enormous mistake which is great. I.e. roughly speaking if you just add a “∼” to the whole book it says an important truth.{{sfn|McGuinness|2008|p=141}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;In an unusual move, Wittgenstein took out a copy of Weininger's work on 1 June 1931 from the Special Order Books in the university library. He met Moore on 2 June where he probably gave Moore the copy of Weininger's work.{{sfn|McGuinness|2008|p=141}}

===Jewish background and Hitler===
{{Further|History of the Jews in Austria}}
There is much debate about the extent to which Wittgenstein and his siblings, who were of 3/4 Jewish descent, saw themselves as Jews. The issue has arisen in particular regarding Wittgenstein's schooldays, because [[Adolf Hitler]] was, for a while, at the same school at the same time.&lt;ref name=McGuinnessStern&gt;For the view that Wittgenstein saw himself as completely German, not Jewish, see McGuinness, Brian. "Wittgenstein and the Idea of Jewishness", and for an opposing view, see Stern, David.

''Wittgenstein: Biography and Philosophy''. Cambridge University Press, 2001, pp. 231ff and p. 237ff respectively.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Laurence Goldstein]] argues it is "overwhelmingly probable" the boys met each other: that Hitler would have disliked Wittgenstein, a "stammering, precocious, precious, aristocratic upstart ..."&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Lawrence. [https://books.google.com/books?id=EvHPNoKvmf0C&amp;pg=PA167 ''Clear and Queer Thinking: Wittgenstein's Development and his Relevance to Modern Thought'']. Duckworth, 1999, p. 167ff. Also see [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2659846 "Clear and Queering Thinking"], review in ''Mind'', Oxford University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Other commentators have dismissed as irresponsible and uninformed any suggestion that Wittgenstein's wealth and unusual personality may have fed Hitler's antisemitism, in part because there is no indication that Hitler would have seen Wittgenstein as Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;McGinn, Marie. "Hi Ludwig", ''Times Literary Supplement'', 26 May 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wittgenstein and Hitler were born just six days apart, though Hitler had to re-sit his mathematics exam before being allowed into a higher class, while Wittgenstein was moved forward by one, so they ended up two grades apart at the ''Realschule''.&lt;ref&gt;Hitler started at the school on 17 September 1900, repeated the first year in 1901, and left in the autumn of 1905; see Kersaw, Ian.

* Brigitte Hamann argues in ''Hitler's Vienna'' (1996) that Hitler was bound to have laid eyes on Wittgenstein, because the latter was so conspicuous, though she told ''Focus'' magazine they were in different classes, and she agrees with Monk that they would have had nothing to do with one another.

In his own writings&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., MS 154.&lt;/ref&gt; Wittgenstein frequently referred to himself as Jewish, at times as part of an apparent self-flagellation. For example, while berating himself for being a "reproductive" as opposed to "productive" thinker, he attributed this to his own Jewish sense of identity, writing: "The saint is the only Jewish genius. Even the greatest Jewish thinker is no more than talented. (Myself for instance)."&lt;ref&gt;''Culture and Value'', Ludwig Wittgenstein, (Oxford 1998), page 16e (see also, pages 15e–19e).&lt;/ref&gt; While Wittgenstein would later claim that "[m]y thoughts are 100% Hebraic,"&lt;ref&gt;M.O'C. Drury, "Conversations with Wittgenstein", in ''Recollections of Wittgenstein'', ed. R. Rhees, New York: Oxford University Press, revised edition, 1984, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; as [[Hans Sluga]] has argued, if so, "His was a self-doubting Judaism, which had always the possibility of collapsing into a destructive self-hatred (as it did in [[Otto Weininger|Weininger's]] case) but which also held an immense promise of innovation and genius."&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Sluga]], ''The Cambridge companion to Wittgenstein'', (Cambridge 1996), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1906–1913: University==

===Engineering at Berlin and Manchester===
[[File:10. Ludwig Wittgenstein, aged about eighteen.jpg|right|thumb|Ludwig Wittgenstein, aged about eighteen]]
[[File:1895 technische hochschule charlottenburg.jpg|right|thumb|The old [[Berlin Institute of Technology|Technische Hochschule]] in [[Charlottenburg]], Berlin]]
He began his studies in mechanical engineering at the [[Berlin Institute of Technology|Technische Hochschule]] in [[Charlottenburg]], Berlin, on 23 October 1906, lodging with the family of professor Dr. Jolles. He attended for three semesters, and was awarded a [[diploma]] (''Abgangzeugnis'') on 5 May 1908.

During his time at the Institute, Wittgenstein developed an interest in [[aeronautics]].{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=27}} He arrived at the [[Victoria University of Manchester]] in the spring of 1908 to study for a doctorate, full of plans for aeronautical projects, including designing and flying his own plane. He conducted research into the behavior of kites in the upper atmosphere, experimenting at a meteorological observation site near [[Glossop]].{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=29}} Specifically, the [[Royal Meteorological Society]] researched and investigated the ionization of the upper atmosphere, by suspending instruments on balloons or kites. At Glossop Wittgenstein worked under Professor of Physics Sir [[Arthur Schuster]].&lt;ref name="Lemco 39–51"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lemco |first=Ian |date=22 January 2007 |title=Wittgenstein's Aeronautical Investigation |journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London |volume=61 |issue=1 |pages=39–51 |doi=10.1098/rsnr.2006.0163 |jstor=20462605 }}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also worked on the design of a propeller with small jet engines on the end of its blades, something he patented in 1911, and which earned him a research studentship from the university in the autumn of 1908.{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=30-35}} At the time, contemporary propeller designs were not advanced enough to actually put Wittgenstein’s ideas into practice, and it would be years before a blade design that could support Wittgenstein’s innovative design was created. Wittgenstein’s design required air and gas to be forced along the propeller arms to combustion chambers on the end of each blade, where it was then compressed by the centrifugal force exerted by the revolving arms and ignited. Propellers of the time were typically wood, whereas modern blades are made from pressed steel laminates as separate halves, which are then welded together. This gives the blade a hollow interior, and therefore creates an ideal pathway for the air and gas.&lt;ref name="Lemco 39–51" /&gt;

[[File:11. With Eccles at the Kite-Flying Station in Glossop.jpg|right|thumb|Ludwig with Eccles at the Kite-Flying Station in [[Glossop]]]]
Work on the jet-powered propeller proved frustrating for Wittgenstein, who had very little experience working with machinery.&lt;ref name="Mays, p.137"&gt;Mays, p.137&lt;/ref&gt; Jim Bamber, a British engineer who was his friend and classmate at the time, reported that “when things went wrong, which often occurred, he would throw his arms around, stomp about, and swear volubly in German.”&lt;ref&gt;Mays, p.138&lt;/ref&gt; According to William Eccles, another friend from that period, Wittgenstein then turned to more theoretical work, focusing on the design of the propeller — a problem that required relatively sophisticated mathematics.&lt;ref name="Mays, p.137" /&gt;

It was at this time that he became interested in the [[foundations of mathematics]], particularly after reading [[Bertrand Russell]]'s ''[[The Principles of Mathematics]]'' (1903), and [[Gottlob Frege]]'s ''[[The Foundations of Arithmetic]]'', vol. 1 (1893) and vol. 2 (1903).&lt;ref&gt;Beaney, Michael (ed.). ''The Frege Reader''. Blackwell, 1997, pp. 194–223, 258–289.&lt;/ref&gt; Wittgenstein's sister Hermine said he became obsessed with mathematics as a result, and was anyway losing interest in aeronautics.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=30}} He decided instead that he needed to study logic and the foundations of mathematics, describing himself as in a "constant, indescribable, almost pathological state of agitation."{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=30}} In the summer of 1911 he visited Frege at the [[University of Jena]] to show him some philosophy of mathematics and logic he had written, and to ask whether it was worth pursuing.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=36}} He wrote: "I was shown into Frege's study. Frege was a small, neat man with a pointed beard who bounced around the room as he talked. He absolutely wiped the floor with me, and I felt very depressed; but at the end he said 'You must come again', so I cheered up. I had several discussions with him after that. Frege would never talk about anything but logic and mathematics, if I started on some other subject, he would say something polite and then plunge back into logic and mathematics."&lt;ref name="Kanterian36"&gt;Kanterian, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrival at Cambridge===
[[File:Ludwig Wittgenstein 1910.jpg|right|thumb|Wittgenstein, 1910s]]
Wittgenstein wanted to study with Frege, but Frege suggested he attend the University of Cambridge to study under Russell, so on 18 October 1911 Wittgenstein arrived unannounced at Russell's rooms in [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]].&lt;ref name="ConnorRobertson"&gt;O'Connor, J.J. and Robertson, E.F. [http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Wittgenstein.html "Ludwig Josef Johann Wittgenstein"], St Andrews University. Retrieved 2 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Russell was having tea with [[C. K. Ogden]], when, according to Russell, "an unknown German appeared, speaking very little English but refusing to speak German. He turned out to be a man who had learned engineering at Charlottenburg, but during this course had acquired, by himself, a passion for the philosophy of mathematics &amp; has now come to Cambridge on purpose to hear me."{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=36}} He was soon not only attending Russell's lectures, but dominating them. The lectures were poorly attended and Russell often found himself lecturing only to [[C. D. Broad]], [[Eric Harold Neville|E. H. Neville]], and H. T. J. Norton.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=36}} Wittgenstein started following him after lectures back to his rooms to discuss more philosophy, until it was time for the evening meal in [[Formal (university)#Terminology|Hall]]. Russell grew irritated; he wrote to his lover [[Lady Ottoline Morrell]]: "My German friend threatens to be an infliction."{{sfn|McGuinness|1988|pp=88-89}}
Russell soon came to believe that Wittgenstein was a genius, especially after he had examined Wittgenstein's written work. He wrote in November 1911 that he had at first thought Wittgenstein might be a crank, but soon decided he was a genius: "Some of his early views made the decision difficult. He maintained, for example, at one time that all existential propositions are meaningless. This was in a lecture room, and I invited him to consider the proposition: 'There is no hippopotamus in this room at present.' When he refused to believe this, I looked under all the desks without finding one; but he remained unconvinced."{{sfn|McGuinness|1988|p=88}} Three months after Wittgenstein's arrival Russell told Morrell: "I love him &amp; feel he will solve the problems I am too old to solve ... He is ''the'' young man one hopes for."{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=41}} Wittgenstein later told David Pinsent that Russell’s encouragement had proven his salvation, and had ended nine years of loneliness and suffering, during which he had continually thought of suicide. In encouraging him to pursue philosophy and in justifying his inclination to abandon engineering, Russell had, quite literally, saved Wittgenstein’s life.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=41}} The role-reversal between Bertrand Russell and Wittgenstein was soon such that Russell wrote in 1916, after Wittgenstein had criticized Russell's own work: "His [Wittenstein]'s criticism, tho' I don't think you realized it at the time, was an event of first-rate importance in my life, and affected everything I have done since. I saw that he was right, and I saw that I could not hope ever again to do fundamental work in philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Bertrand. ''Autobiography''. Routledge, 1998, p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cambridge Moral Sciences Club and Apostles===
[[File:Russell1907-2.jpg|thumb|234x234px|[[Bertrand Russell]], 1907]]

In 1912 Wittgenstein joined the [[Cambridge University Moral Sciences Club|Cambridge Moral Sciences Club]], an influential discussion group for philosophy dons and students, delivering his first paper there on 29 November that year, a four-minute talk defining philosophy as "all those primitive propositions which are assumed as true without proof by the various sciences."&lt;ref&gt;Pitt, Jack. [http://digitalcommons.mcmaster.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1617&amp;context=russelljournal "Russell and the Cambridge Moral Sciences Club"], ''Russell: the Journal of Bertrand Russell'' Studies: Vol. 1, issue 2, article 3, winter 1982.

Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2003, p. 332, citing Michael Nedo and Michele Ranchetti (eds.). ''Ludwig Wittgenstein: sein Leben in Bildern und Texten''. Suhrkamp, 1983, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; He dominated the society and for a time would stop attending in the early 1930s after complaints that he gave no one else a chance to speak.&lt;ref name=Edmonds22&gt;Edmonds, Eidinow 2001, pp. 22–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The club became infamous within popular philosophy because of a meeting on 25 October 1946 at [[R. B. Braithwaite|Richard Braithwaite]]'s rooms in [[King's College, Cambridge|King's]], where [[Karl Popper]], another Viennese philosopher, had been invited as the guest speaker. Popper's paper was ''Are there philosophical problems?'', in which he struck up a position against Wittgenstein's, contending that problems in philosophy are real, not just linguistic puzzles as Wittgenstein argued. Accounts vary as to what happened next, but Wittgenstein apparently started waving a hot poker, demanding that Popper give him an example of a moral rule. Popper offered one—"Not to threaten visiting speakers with pokers"—at which point Russell told Wittgenstein he had misunderstood and Wittgenstein left. Popper maintained that Wittgenstein 'stormed out', but it had become accepted practice for him to leave early (because of his aforementioned ability to dominate discussion). It was the only time the philosophers, three of the most eminent in the world, were ever in the same room together.&lt;ref&gt;Eidinow, John and Edmonds, David.

Retrieved 7 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Maynard Keynes]] also invited him to join the [[Cambridge Apostles]], an elite secret society formed in 1820, which both Russell and [[G. E. Moore]] had joined as students, but Wittgenstein did not enjoy it and attended infrequently. Russell had been worried that Wittgenstein would not appreciate the group's unseriousness, style of humour, or the fact that the members were in love with one another.{{sfn|McGuinness|1988|p=118}} He was admitted in 1912 but resigned almost immediately because he could not tolerate the level of discussion; they took him back though in the 1920s when he returned to Cambridge. (He also had trouble tolerating the discussions in the Moral Sciences Club.) {{fact|date=June 2018}}

=== Frustrations at Cambridge/Pre-war ===
Wittgenstein was quite vocal about his depression in his years at Cambridge, and before he went to war; on many an occasion, he told Russell of his woes. His mental anguish seemed to stem from two sources: his work, and his personal life. Wittgenstein made numerous remarks to Russell about logic driving him mad.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=76}} Wittgenstein also stated to Russell that he "felt the curse of those who have half a talent".{{sfn|McGuinness|2008|p=39}} He later expresses this same worry, and tells of being in mediocre spirits due to his lack of progress in his logical work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wittgenstein in Cambridge|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monk writes that Wittgenstein lived and breathed logic, and a temporary lack of inspiration plunged him into despair.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=75}} Unless he was lying, Wittgenstein tells of his work in logic affecting his mental status in a very extreme way. However, he also tells Russell another story. Around Christmas, in 1913, he writes: "how can I be a logician before I'm a human being? For the most important thing is coming to terms with myself!"{{sfn|McGuinness|2008|p=63}} He also tells Russell on an occasion in Russell’s rooms that he was worried about logic and his sins; also, once upon arrival to Russell's rooms one night Wittgenstein announced to Russell that he would kill himself once he left.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Portraits of Wittgenstein vol.1|last=1:Flowers, 2:Ground|first=1:F.A, 2: Ian|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of things Wittgenstein personally told Russell, Ludwig’s temperament was also recorded in the diary of David Pinsent. Pinsent writes "I have to be frightfully careful and tolerant when he gets these sulky fits", and "I am afraid he is in an even more sensitive neurotic state just now than usual", when talking about Wittgenstein's emotional fluctuations.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=85}}

===Sexual orientation and relationship with David Pinsent===

[[File:Wittgenstein with friends drinking coffee.jpg|right|thumb|240x240px|Wittgenstein sitting with his friends and family in Vienna. Marguerite Respinger sits at the end of the left and the sculpture he made of her sits behind him on the mantel-place]]
Wittgenstein had romantic relations with both men and women. He is generally believed to have fallen in love with at least three men, and had a relationship with the latter two: [[David Pinsent|David Hume Pinsent]] in 1912, [[Francis Skinner]] in 1930, and Ben Richards in the late 1940s.{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=583-586}} He later revealed that, as a teenager in Vienna, he had had an affair with a woman.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=369}} Additionally, in the 1920s Wittgenstein fell in love with a young Swiss woman, Marguerite Respinger, modelling a sculpture of her and proposing marriage, albeit on condition that they would not have children.{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=238-240, 318}}

Wittgenstein's relationship with David Pinsent (1891–1918) occurred during an intellectually formative period, and is well documented. Bertrand Russell introduced Wittgenstein to Pinsent in the summer of 1912. A mathematics undergraduate and descendant of [[David Hume]], Pinsent soon became Wittgenstein's closest friend.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Laurence. ''Clear and queer thinking: Wittgenstein's development and his relevance to modern thought''. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1999, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; The men worked together on experiments in the psychology laboratory about the role of rhythm in the appreciation of music, and Wittgenstein delivered a paper on the subject to the [[British Psychological Society|British Psychological Association]] in Cambridge in 1912. They also travelled together, including to Iceland in September 1912—the expenses paid by Wittgenstein, including [[first class travel]], the hiring of a private train, and new clothes and spending money for Pinsent. In addition to Iceland, Wittgenstein and Pinsent traveled to Norway in 1913. Upon determining their destination, Wittgenstein and Pinsent visited a tourist office in search for a location that would fulfill the following criteria – small village located on a Fjord, a location away from tourists, and a peaceful destination to allow them to study logic and law.&lt;ref&gt;Portraits of Wittgenstein, Extracts from the Diary of David Pinsent 1912–1914, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; Suggesting [[Øystese]], Wittgenstein and Pinsent arrived in the small village on 4 September 1913. With their vacation lasting almost three weeks, Wittgenstein was able to work vigorously on his studies. The immense progress on logic during their stay led Wittgenstein to express to Pinsent his idea to leave Cambridge and return to Norway to continue his work on logic.&lt;ref&gt;Portraits of Wittgenstein, Extracts from the Diary of David Pinsent 1912–1914, p.230.&lt;/ref&gt; Pinsent's diaries provide valuable insights into Wittgenstein's personality – sensitive, nervous and attuned to the tiniest slight or change in mood from Pinsent.&lt;ref&gt;Monk, p. 58ff. *See Von Wright, G. H. ''A Portrait of Wittgenstein as a Young Man: From the Diary of David Hume Pinsent 1912–1914''. Basil Blackwell, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;  Pinsent also writes of Wittgenstein being "absolutely sulky and snappish" at times, as well.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=85}} In his diaries Pinsent wrote about shopping for furniture with Wittgenstein in Cambridge when the latter was given rooms in Trinity; most of what they found in the stores was not minimalist enough for Wittgenstein's aesthetics: "I went and helped him interview a lot of furniture at various shops ... It was rather amusing: he is terribly fastidious and we led the shopman a frightful dance, Vittgenstein [sic] ejaculating "No—Beastly!" to 90 percent of what he shewed [archaic spelling] us!"&lt;ref name="Kanterian40"&gt;Kanterian, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote in May 1912 that Wittgenstein had just begun to study the history of philosophy: "He expresses the most naive surprise that all the philosophers he once worshipped in ignorance are after all stupid and dishonest and make disgusting mistakes!"&lt;ref name=Kanterian40/&gt; The last time they saw each other was on 8 October 1913 at Lordswood House in Birmingham, then residence of the Pinsent family: "I got up at 6.15 to see Ludwig off. He had to go very early – back to Cambridge – as he has lots to do there. I saw him off from the house in a taxi at 7.0 – to catch a 7.30 am train from New St Station. It was sad parting from him."&lt;ref name=Wright&gt;[[Georg Henrik von Wright|Von Wright, G. H.]] ''A Portrait of Wittgenstein as a Young Man: From the Diary of David Hume Pinsent 1912–1914''. Basil Blackwell, 1990. p.88&lt;/ref&gt; Wittgenstein left to live in Norway.

==1913–1920: World War I and the ''Tractatus''==

===Work on ''Logik''===
[[File:Wittgenstein notes 1914.jpg|thumb|Entries from October 1914 in Wittgenstein's diary, on display at the [[Wren Library]], [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]]]
Karl Wittgenstein died on 20 January 1913, and after receiving his inheritance Wittgenstein became one of the wealthiest men in Europe.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=71}} He donated some of his money, at first anonymously, to Austrian artists and writers, including [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] and [[Georg Trakl]]. Trakl requested to meet his benefactor but in 1914 when Wittgenstein went to visit, Trakl had already killed himself.  Wittgenstein came to feel that he could not get to the heart of his most fundamental questions while surrounded by other academics, and so in 1913 he retreated to the village of [[Skjolden]] in Norway, where he rented the second floor of a house for the winter. He later saw this as one of the most productive periods of his life, writing ''Logik'' (''Notes on Logic''), the predecessor of much of the ''Tractatus''.&lt;ref name=ConnorRobertson/&gt; While in Norway, Wittgenstein learned [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] to converse with the local villagers, and [[Danish language|Danish]] to read the works of the Danish philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jon Stewart (philosopher)|Stewart, Jon.]] (ed.) ''Kierkegaard's Influence on Philosophy: German and Scandinavian Philosophy''. Ashgate Publishing, 2009, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was during this time that Wittgenstein began addressing what he considered to be a central issue in ''Notes on Logic'', a general decision procedure for determining the truth value of logical propositions which would stem from a single primitive proposition. He became convinced during this time that “[a]ll the propositions of logic are generalizations of tautologies and all generalizations of tautologies are generalizations of logic. There are no other logical propositions.”{{sfn|McGuinness|2008|p=58}} Based on this, Wittgenstein argued that propositions of logic express their truth or falsehood in the sign itself, and one need not know anything about the constituent parts of the proposition to determine it true or false. Rather, one simply need identify the statement as a tautology (true), a contradiction (false), or neither.

The problem lay in forming a primitive proposition which encompassed this and would act as the basis for all of logic. As he stated in correspondence with Russell in late 1913, “The big question now is, how must a system of signs be constituted in order to make every tautology recognizable as such IN ONE AND THE SAME WAY? This is the fundamental problem of logic!” {{sfn|McGuinness|2008|p=59}} The importance Wittgenstein placed upon this fundamental problem was so great that he believed if he did not solve it, he had no reason or right to live.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=96}} Despite this apparent life-or-death importance, Wittgenstein had given up on this primitive proposition by the time of the writing of the ''Tractatus''. The ''Tractatus'' does not offer any general process for identifying propositions as tautologies; in a simpler manner, “Every tautology itself shows that it is a tautology.”&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein, Ludwig. ''Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus: Side-By-Side-By-Side Edition''. Kegan Paul, 1922, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; This shift to understanding tautologies through mere identification or recognition occurred in 1914 when Moore was called on by Wittgenstein to assist him in dictating his notes.

At Wittgenstein's insistence, Moore, who was now a Cambridge don, visited him in Norway in 1914, reluctantly because Wittgenstein exhausted him. [[David Edmonds (philosopher)|David Edmonds]] and John Eidinow write that Wittgenstein regarded Moore, an internationally known philosopher, as an example of how far someone could get in life with "absolutely no intelligence whatever."{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=262}} In Norway it was clear that Moore was expected to act as Wittgenstein's secretary, taking down his notes, with Wittgenstein falling into a rage when Moore got something wrong.&lt;ref name=Edmonds45/&gt; When he returned to Cambridge, Moore asked the university to consider accepting ''Logik'' as sufficient for a bachelor's degree, but they refused, saying it wasn't formatted properly: no footnotes, no preface. Wittgenstein was furious, writing to Moore in May 1914: "If I am not worth your making an exception for me ''even in some STUPID details'' then I may as well go to Hell directly; and if I ''am'' worth it and you don't do it then—by God—''you'' might go there."{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=103}} Moore was apparently distraught; he wrote in his diary that he felt sick and could not get the letter out of his head.{{sfn|McGuinness|1988|p=200}} The two did not speak again until 1929.&lt;ref name=Edmonds45&gt;Edmonds, Eidinow 2001, pp. 45–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military service===

On the outbreak of World War I, Wittgenstein immediately volunteered for the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]], despite being eligible for a medical exemption.&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein had a double hernia, according to philosopher [[Iain King]], who recounts Wittgenstein's war record in an April 2014 article [http://www.military-history.org/articles/thinkers-at-war-wittgenstein.htm here (link to Military History Monthly magazine article)], accessed 23 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein's medical exemption is confirmed in [[Philosophy Now]] magazine [http://philosophynow.org/issues/103/WittgensteinTolstoy_and_the_Folly_of_Logical_Positivism here (link to Philosophy Now)], accessed 23 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  He served first on a ship and then in an artillery workshop 'several miles from the action'.&lt;ref&gt;According to philosopher [[Iain King]], who described Wittgenstein's war record and its impact on his thinking [http://www.military-history.org/articles/thinkers-at-war-wittgenstein.htm here (link to Military History Monthly magazine article)], accessed 23 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; He was wounded in an accidental explosion, and hospitalised to [[Kraków]].&lt;ref&gt;From [[Iain King]], writing in April 2014 about Wittgenstein's war record and its impact on his thinking [http://www.military-history.org/articles/thinkers-at-war-wittgenstein.htm here (link to Military History Monthly magazine article)], accessed 23 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  In March 1916, he was posted to a fighting unit on the front line of the Russian front, as part of the [[7th Army (Austria-Hungary)|Austrian 7th Army]], where his unit was involved in some of the heaviest fighting, defending against the [[Brusilov Offensive]].{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=137-142}} Wittgenstein directed the fire of his own artillery from an observation post in no-man's land against Allied troops – one of the most dangerous jobs there was, since he was targeted by enemy fire.&lt;ref&gt;From a July 2014 article in [[Philosophy Now]] magazine [http://philosophynow.org/issues/103/WittgensteinTolstoy_and_the_Folly_of_Logical_Positivism here (link to Philosophy Now)], accessed 23 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  In action against British troops, he was decorated with the [[Military Merit Medal (Austria–Hungary)|Military Merit]] with Swords on the Ribbon, and was commended by the army for "His exceptionally courageous behaviour, calmness, sang-froid, and heroism," that "won the total admiration of the troops."&lt;ref&gt;Waugh, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1917, he was sent as a member of a [[howitzer]] regiment to the Russian front, where he won several more medals for bravery including the [[Medal for Bravery (Austria-Hungary)|Silver Medal for Valour]], First Class.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=137}} In 1918, he was promoted to lieutenant and sent to the [[Italian Campaign (World War I)|Italian front]] as part of an artillery regiment. For his part in the final Austrian offensive of June 1918, he was recommended for the Gold Medal for Valour, one of the highest honours in the Austrian army, but was instead awarded the Band of the Military Service Medal with Swords&amp;nbsp;— it being decided that this particular action, although extraordinarily brave, had been insufficiently consequential to merit the highest honour.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=154}}
[[File:27. Wittgenstein’s military identity card during the First World War.jpg|thumb|228x228px|Wittgenstein’s military identity card during the First World War]]
Throughout the war, he kept notebooks in which he frequently wrote philosophical reflections alongside personal remarks, including his contempt for the character of the other soldiers.&lt;ref name="Klagge2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Klagge|first=James Carl|title=Wittgenstein in exile|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YMzajTUpEp0C&amp;pg=PA68|date=22 December 2010|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-01534-9|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; He discovered [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s 1896 ''[[The Gospel in Brief]]'' at a bookshop in [[Tarnów]], and carried it everywhere, recommending it to anyone in distress, to the point where he became known to his fellow soldiers as "the man with the gospels."{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=44, 116, 382–384}}&lt;ref&gt;* Also see Bill Schardt &amp; David Large, [http://www.the-philosopher.co.uk/witty.htm "Wittgenstein, Tolstoy, and the Gospel in Brief"], ''The Philosopher'', Volume LXXXIX.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Completion of the ''Tractatus''===
[[File:Wittgenstein family Vienna 1917.jpg|thumb|The Wittgenstein family in [[Vienna]], Summer 1917, with Kurt (furthest left) and Wittgenstein (furthest right) in officers' uniforms.]]
In the summer of 1918 Wittgenstein took military leave and went to stay in one of his family's Vienna summer houses, Neuwaldegg. It was there in August 1918 that he completed the ''Tractatus'', which he submitted with the title ''Der Satz'' (German: proposition, sentence, phrase, set, but also "leap") to the publishers Jahoda and Siegel.&lt;ref name=Bartley33&gt;Bartley, pp. 33–39, 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of events around this time left him deeply upset. On 13 August, his uncle Paul died. On 25 October, he learned that Jahoda and Siegel had decided not to publish the ''Tractatus'', and on 27 October, his brother Kurt killed himself, the third of his brothers to commit suicide. It was around this time he received a letter from David Pinsent's mother to say that Pinsent had been killed in a plane crash on 8 May.&lt;ref&gt;Bartley, pp. 33–34. For an original report, see "Death of D.H. Pinsent", ''Birmingham Daily Mail'', 15 May 1918: "Recovery of the Body. The body of Mr. David Hugh Pinsent, a civilian observer, son of Mr and Mrs Hume Pinsent, of Foxcombe Hill, near Oxford and Birmingham, the second victim of last Wednesday's aeroplane accident in West Surrey, was last night found in the Basingstoke Canal, at Frimley." Courtesy of [http://mikeinmono.blogspot.com/2009/08/that-sprawling-ink-blot.html "Wittgenstein in Birmingham"], mikeinmono, 3 August 2009. Retrieved 7 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Wittgenstein was distraught to the point of being suicidal. He was sent back to the Italian front after his leave and, as a result of the defeat of the Austrian army, he was captured by [[Allies of World War I|Allied forces]] on 3 November in [[Trentino]]. He subsequently spent nine months in an Italian prisoner of war camp.

He returned to his family in Vienna on 25 August 1919, by all accounts physically and mentally spent. He apparently talked incessantly about suicide, terrifying his sisters and brother Paul. He decided to do two things: to enroll in teacher training college as an elementary school teacher, and to get rid of his fortune. In 1914, it had been providing him with an income of 300,000 [[Austro-Hungarian krone|Kronen]] a year, but by 1919 was worth a great deal more, with a sizable portfolio of investments in the [[United States]] and the [[Netherlands]]. He divided it among his siblings, except for Margarete, insisting that it not be held in trust for him. His family saw him as ill, and acquiesced.&lt;ref name=Bartley33/&gt;

==1920–1928: Teaching, the ''Tractatus'', Haus Wittgenstein==

===Teacher training in Vienna===
In September 1919 he enrolled in the ''Lehrerbildungsanstalt'' (teacher training college) in the ''Kundmanngasse'' in Vienna. His sister Hermine said that Wittgenstein working as an elementary teacher was like using a precision instrument to open crates, but the family decided not to interfere.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=169}} [[Thomas Bernhard]], more critically, wrote of this period in Wittgenstein's life: "the multi-millionaire as a village schoolmaster is surely a piece of perversity."&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds, Eidinow 2001, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teaching posts in Austria===
In the summer of 1920, Wittgenstein worked as a gardener for a monastery. At first he applied, under a false name, for a teaching post at Reichenau, was awarded the job, but he declined it when his identity was discovered. As a teacher, he wished to no longer be recognized as a member of the famous Wittgenstein family. In response, his brother Paul wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;"It is out of the question, really completely out of the question, that anybody bearing our name and whose elegant and gentle upbringing can be seen a thousand paces off, would not be identified as a member of our family... That one can neither simulate nor dissimulate anything including a refined education I need hardly tell you."&lt;ref&gt;Waugh, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1920, Wittgenstein was given his first job as a primary school teacher in [[Trattenbach]], under his real name, in a remote village of a few hundred people. His first letters describe it as beautiful, but in October 1921, he wrote to Russell: "I am still at Trattenbach, surrounded, as ever, by odiousness and baseness. I know that human beings on the average are not worth much anywhere, but here they are much more good-for-nothing and irresponsible than elsewhere."&lt;ref&gt;Klagge, James Carl. ''Wittgenstein: Biography and Philosophy''. Cambridge University Press, 2001, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; He was soon the object of gossip among the villagers, who found him eccentric at best. He did not get on well with the other teachers; when he found his lodgings too noisy, he made a bed for himself in the school kitchen. He was an enthusiastic teacher, offering late-night extra tuition to several of the students, something that did not endear him to the parents, though some of them came to adore him; his sister Hermine occasionally watched him teach and said the students "literally crawled over each other in their desire to be chosen for answers or demonstrations."&lt;ref&gt;[[Norman Malcolm|Malcolm, Norman]]. [http://www.lrb.co.uk/v03/n21/norman-malcolm/wittgensteins-confessions "Wittgenstein’s Confessions"], ''London Review of Books'', Vol. 3 No. 21, 19 November 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

To the less able, it seems that he became something of a tyrant. The first two hours of each day were devoted to mathematics, hours that Monk writes some of the pupils recalled years later with horror.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=195}} They reported that he caned the boys and boxed their ears, and also that he pulled the girls' hair;&lt;ref name=Bartley107&gt;Bartley, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; This was not unusual at the time for boys, but for the villagers he went too far in doing it to the girls too; girls were not expected to understand algebra, much less have their ears boxed over it. The violence apart, Monk writes that he quickly became a village legend, shouting "''Krautsalat!''" ("coleslaw" – i.e. shredded cabbage) when the headmaster played the piano, and "Nonsense!" when a priest was answering children's questions.{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=196, 198}}

===Publication of the ''Tractatus''===
[[File:Wittgenstein2.jpg|thumb|300x300px|Ludwig Wittgenstein, schoolteacher, c. 1922]]While Wittgenstein was living in isolation in rural Austria, the ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus|Tractatus]]'' was published to considerable interest, first in German in 1921 as ''Logisch-Philosophische Abhandlung'', part of [[Wilhelm Ostwald]]'s journal ''Annalen der Naturphilosophie'', though Wittgenstein was not happy with the result and called it a pirate edition. Russell had agreed to write an introduction to explain why it was important, because it was otherwise unlikely to have been published: it was difficult if not impossible to understand, and Wittgenstein was unknown in philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;For the introduction, see Russell, Bertrand. [http://www.kfs.org/~jonathan/witt/aintro.html Introduction], ''Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus'', May 1922.&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to Russell, Wittgenstein wrote "The main point is the theory of what can be expressed (gesagt) by prop[osition]s—i.e. by language—(and, which comes to the same thing, what can be ''thought'') and what can not be expressed by pro[position]s, but only shown (gezeigt); which, I believe, is the cardinal problem of philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Nieli. ''Wittgenstein: From Mysticism to Ordinary Language''. SUNY Press, 1987, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; But Wittgenstein was not happy with Russell's help. He had lost faith in Russell, finding him glib and his philosophy mechanistic, and felt he had fundamentally misunderstood the ''Tractatus''.&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds, Eidinow 2001, p. 35ff.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{rquote|right|''The whole modern conception of the world is founded on the illusion that the so-called laws of nature are the explanations of natural phenomena.''
''Thus people today stop at the laws of nature, treating them as something inviolable, just as God and Fate were treated in past ages. And in fact both were right and both wrong; though the view of the ancients is clearer insofar as they have an acknowledged terminus, while the modern system tries to make it look as if everything were explained.''|Wittgenstein, [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus|Tractatus]], 6.371-2}}
An English translation was prepared in Cambridge by [[Frank P. Ramsey|Frank Ramsey]], a mathematics undergraduate at King's commissioned by [[C. K. Ogden]]. It was Moore who suggested ''Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus'' for the title, an allusion to [[Baruch Spinoza]]'s ''Tractatus Theologico-Politicus.'' Initially there were difficulties in finding a publisher for the English edition too, because Wittgenstein was insisting it appear without Russell's introduction; Cambridge University Press turned it down for that reason. Finally in 1922 an agreement was reached with Wittgenstein that Kegan Paul would print a bilingual edition with Russell's introduction and the Ramsey-Ogden translation.&lt;ref name="archiveTractatus"/&gt; This is the translation that was approved by Wittgenstein, but it is problematic in a number of ways. Wittgenstein's English was poor at the time, and Ramsey was a teenager who had only recently learned German, so philosophers often prefer to use a 1961 translation by [[David Pears]] and Brian McGuinness.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Ramsey translated "''Sachverhalt''" and "''Sachlage''" as "atomic fact" and "state of affairs" respectively. But Wittgenstein discusses non-existent "''Sachverhalten''", and there cannot be a non-existent fact. Pears and McGuinness made a number of changes, including translating "''Sachverhalt''" as "state of affairs" and "''Sachlage''" as ''situation''. The new translation is often preferred, but some philosophers use the original, in part because Wittgenstein approved it, and because it avoids the idiomatic English of Pears-McGuinness. See:

An aim of the ''Tractatus'' is to reveal the relationship between language and the world: what can be said about it, and what can only be shown. Wittgenstein argues that the logical structure of language provides the limits of meaning. The limits of language, for Wittgenstein, are the limits of philosophy. Much of philosophy involves attempts to say the unsayable: "What we can say at all can be said clearly," he argues. Anything beyond that—religion, ethics, aesthetics, the mystical—cannot be discussed. They are not in themselves nonsensical, but any statement about them must be.&lt;ref name=Grayling16&gt;Grayling, A. C. ''Wittgenstein: A Very Short Introduction''. Oxford University Press, 2001, p. 16ff.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote in the preface: "The book will, therefore, draw a limit to thinking, or rather—not to thinking, but to the expression of thoughts; for, in order to draw a limit to thinking we should have to be able to think both sides of this limit (we should therefore have to be able to think what cannot be thought)."&lt;ref&gt;''Tractatus'' (Ogden translation), preface.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is 75 pages long—"As to the shortness of the book, I am ''awfully sorry for it'' ... If you were to squeeze me like a lemon you would get nothing more out of me," he told Ogden—and presents seven numbered propositions (1–7), with various sub-levels (1, 1.1, 1.11):&lt;ref&gt;For the comment to Ogden, see Monk, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt;

# ''Die Welt ist alles, was der Fall ist''.
#: The world is everything that is the case.&lt;ref&gt;The English is from the original Ogden/Ramsey translation.&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Was der Fall ist, die Tatsache, ist das Bestehen von Sachverhalten''.
#: What is the case, the fact, is the existence of atomic facts.
# ''Das logische Bild der Tatsachen ist der Gedanke''.
#: The logical picture of the facts is the thought.
# ''Der Gedanke ist der sinnvolle Satz''.
#: The thought is the significant proposition.
# ''Der Satz ist eine Wahrheitsfunktion der Elementarsätze''.
#: Propositions are truth-functions of elementary propositions.
# ''Die allgemeine Form der Wahrheitsfunktion ist: &lt;math&gt;[\bar p,\bar\xi, N(\bar\xi)]&lt;/math&gt;. Dies ist die allgemeine Form des Satzes''.
#: The general form of a truth-function is: &lt;math&gt;[\bar p,\bar\xi, N(\bar\xi)]&lt;/math&gt;. This is the general form of proposition.
# ''Wovon man nicht sprechen kann, darüber muß man schweigen''.
#: Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.

===Visit from Frank Ramsey, Puchberg===
[[File:Puchberg am Schneeberg-view.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Frank P. Ramsey]] visited Wittgenstein in [[Puchberg am Schneeberg]] in September 1923.]]
In September 1922 he moved to a secondary school in a nearby village, [[Hassbach (Lower Austria)|Hassbach]], but considered the people there just as bad—"These people are not human ''at all'' but loathsome worms," he wrote to a friend—and he left after a month. In November he began work at another primary school, this time in [[Puchberg am Schneeberg|Puchberg]] in the [[Schneeberg (Alps)|Schneeberg]] mountains. There, he told Russell, the villagers were "one-quarter animal and three-quarters human."

[[Frank P. Ramsey]] visited him on 17 September 1923 to discuss the ''Tractatus''; he had agreed to write a review of it for ''Mind''.{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=212, 214–216, 220–221.}} He reported in a letter home that Wittgenstein was living frugally in one tiny whitewashed room that only had space for a bed, washstand, a small table, and one small hard chair. Ramsey shared an evening meal with him of coarse bread, butter, and cocoa. Wittgenstein's school hours were eight to twelve or one, and he had afternoons free.&lt;ref&gt;Mellor, D.H. [http://www.dspace.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/1810/3484/5/RamseyText.html "Cambridge Philosophers I: F. P. Ramsey"], Philosophy 70, 1995, pp. 243–262.&lt;/ref&gt; After Ramsey returned to Cambridge a long campaign began among Wittgenstein's friends to persuade him to return to Cambridge and away from what they saw as a hostile environment for him. He was accepting no help even from his family.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=212}} Ramsey wrote to [[John Maynard Keynes]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;"[Wittgenstein's family] are very rich and extremely anxious to give him money or do anything for him in any way, and he rejects all their advances; even Christmas presents or presents of invalid's food, when he is ill, he sends back. And this is not because they aren't on good terms but because he won't have any money he hasn't earned ... It is an awful pity."{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=212}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Haidbauer incident, Otterthal===
{{main|Haidbauer incident}}
[[File:31. Wittgenstein, 1925.jpg|thumb|Wittgenstein, 1925]]
He moved schools again in September 1924, this time to [[Otterthal]], near Trattenbach; the socialist headmaster, Josef Putre, was someone Wittgenstein had become friends with while at Trattenbach. While he was there, he wrote a 42-page pronunciation and spelling dictionary for the children, ''Wörterbuch für Volksschulen'', published in Vienna in 1926 by Hölder-Pichler-Tempsky, the only book of his apart from the ''Tractatus'' that was published in his lifetime.&lt;ref name="archiveTractatus"&gt;[http://www.wittgen-cam.ac.uk/biogre6.html "Ludwig Wittgenstein: Tractatus and Teaching"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213064904/http://www.wittgen-cam.ac.uk/biogre6.html |date=13 February 2010 }}, Cambridge Wittgenstein archive. Retrieved 4 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; A first edition sold in 2005 for £75,000.&lt;ref name="Ezard"&gt;Ezard, John. [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/feb/19/books.booksnews2 "Philosopher's rare 'other book' goes on sale"], ''The Guardian'', 19 February 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

An incident occurred in April 1926 and became known as ''Der Vorfall Haidbauer'' (the Haidbauer incident). Josef Haidbauer was an 11-year-old pupil whose father had died and whose mother worked as a local maid. He was a slow learner, and one day Wittgenstein hit him two or three times on the head, causing him to collapse. Wittgenstein carried him to the headmaster's office, then quickly left the school, bumping into a parent, Herr Piribauer, on the way out. Piribauer had been sent for by the children when they saw Haidbauer collapse; Wittgenstein had previously pulled Piribauer's daughter, Hermine, so hard by the ears that her ears had bled.{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=224, 232–233}} Piribauer said that when he met Wittgenstein in the hall that day: "I called him all the names under the sun. I told him he wasn't a teacher, he was an animal-trainer! And that I was going to fetch the police right away!"{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=225}}

Piribauer tried to have Wittgenstein arrested, but the village's police station was empty, and when he tried again the next day he was told Wittgenstein had disappeared. On 28 April 1926, Wittgenstein handed in his resignation to Wilhelm Kundt, a local school inspector, who tried to persuade him to stay; however, Wittgenstein was adamant that his days as a schoolteacher were over.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=225}} Proceedings were initiated in May, and the judge ordered a psychiatric report; in August 1926 a letter to Wittgenstein from a friend, Ludwig Hänsel, indicates that hearings were ongoing, but nothing is known about the case after that. Alexander Waugh writes that Wittgenstein's family and their money may have had a hand in covering things up. Waugh writes that Haidbauer died shortly afterwards of haemophilia; Monk says he died when he was 14 of [[leukaemia]].&lt;ref&gt;Waugh, p. 162. Monk, p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten years later, in 1936, as part of a series of "confessions" he engaged in that year, Wittgenstein appeared without warning at the village saying he wanted to confess personally and ask for pardon from the children he had hit. He visited at least four of the children, including Hermine Piribauer, who apparently replied only with a "Ja, ja," though other former students were more hospitable. Monk writes that the purpose of these confessions was not "to hurt his pride, as a form of punishment; it was to dismantle it—to remove a barrier, as it were, that stood in the way of honest and decent thought." Of the apologies, Wittgenstein wrote, "This brought me into more settled waters... and to greater seriousness."{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=370-371}}

===The Vienna Circle===
{{See also|Vienna Circle}}
The ''Tractatus'' was now the subject of much debate amongst philosophers, and Wittgenstein was a figure of increasing international fame. In particular, a discussion group of philosophers, scientists and mathematicians, known as the [[Vienna Circle]], had built up largely as a result of the inspiration they had been given by reading the ''Tractatus''.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=212}} While it is commonly assumed that Wittgenstein was a part of the Vienna Circle, in reality, this was not actually the case. German philosopher [[Oswald Hanfling]] writes bluntly: "Wittgenstein was never a member of the Circle, though he was in Vienna during much of the time. Yet his influence on the Circle's thought was at least as important as that of any of its members."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Essential Readings in Logical Positivism|last = Hanfling|first = Oswald |author-link=Oswald Hanfling |publisher = Basil Blackwell|year = 1981|isbn = 978-0-631-12566-2|location = Oxford|pages = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1926, with the members of the Vienna Circle, Wittgenstein would take part in many discussions. However, during these discussions, it soon became evident that Wittgenstein held a different attitude towards philosophy than the members of the Circle whom his work had inspired. For example, during meetings of the Vienna Circle, he would express his disagreement with the group's misreading of his work by turning his back to them and reading poetry aloud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/crux/2012/09/07/the-limits-of-science-and-scientists/|title=The Limits of Science—and Scientists - The Crux|date=7 September 2012|publisher=|accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his autobiography, [[Rudolf Carnap]] describes Wittgenstein as the thinker who gave him the greatest inspiration. However, he also wrote that "there was a striking difference between Wittgenstein's attitude toward philosophical problems and that of Schlick and myself. Our attitude toward philosophical problems was not very different from that which scientists have toward their problems." As for Wittgenstein:
{{quote|His point of view and his attitude toward people and problems, even theoretical problems, were much more similar to those of a creative artist than to those of a scientist; one might almost say, similar to those of a religious prophet or a seer... When finally, sometimes after a prolonged arduous effort, his answers came forth, his statement stood before us like a newly created piece of art or a divine revelation ... the impression he made on us was as if insight came to him as through divine inspiration, so that we could not help feeling that any sober rational comment or analysis of it would be a profanation.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Carnap, ''Autobiography'', in P.A. Schlipp (ed) ''The Philosophy of Rudolf Carnap'', The Library of Living Philosophers, Volume 11, La Salle Open Court, 1963, pages 25–27&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Haus Wittgenstein===
{{Main|Haus Wittgenstein}}
[[File:Haus Wittgenstein, Stonborough House, Vienna.jpg|thumb|upright|left|150px|Wittgenstein worked on [[Haus Wittgenstein]] between 1926 and 1929.]]

{{rquote|right|"I am not interested in erecting a building, but in [...] presenting to myself the foundations of all possible buildings."|Wittgenstein&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;Hyde, Lewis. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/06/books/review/Hyde-t.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=&amp;st=nyt "Making It"]. ''The New York Times'', 6 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1926 Wittgenstein was again working as a gardener for a number of months, this time at the monastery of Hütteldorf, where he had also inquired about becoming a monk. His sister, Margaret, invited him to help with the design of her new townhouse in Vienna's ''Kundmanngasse''. Wittgenstein, his friend [[Paul Engelmann]], and a team of architects developed a spare modernist house. In particular, Wittgenstein focused on the windows, doors, and radiators, demanding that every detail be exactly as he specified. When the house was nearly finished Wittgenstein had an entire ceiling raised 30mm so that the room had the exact proportions he wanted. Monk writes that "This is not so marginal as it may at first appear, for it is precisely these details that lend what is otherwise a rather plain, even ugly house its distinctive beauty."&lt;ref name="Jeffries"&gt;Jeffries, Stuart. [http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/politicsphilosophyandsociety/story/0,,627752,00.html "A dwelling for the gods"], ''The Guardian'', 5 January 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

It took him a year to design the door handles and another to design the radiators. Each window was covered by a metal screen that weighed 150&amp;nbsp;kg, moved by a pulley Wittgenstein designed. Bernhard Leitner, author of ''The Architecture of Ludwig Wittgenstein'', said there is barely anything comparable in the history of interior design: "It is as ingenious as it is expensive. A metal curtain that could be lowered into the floor."&lt;ref name=Jeffries/&gt;

The house was finished by December 1928 and the family gathered there at Christmas to celebrate its completion. Wittgenstein's sister Hermine wrote: "Even though I admired the house very much....It seemed indeed to be much more a dwelling for the gods."&lt;ref name="Lewis"/&gt; Wittgenstein said "the house I built for Gretl is the product of a decidedly sensitive ear and ''good'' manners, and expression of great ''understanding''... But ''primordial'' life, wild life striving to erupt into the open – that is lacking."{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=240}} Monk comments that the same might be said of the technically excellent, but austere, terracotta sculpture Wittgenstein had modelled of Marguerite Respinger in 1926, and that, as Russell first noticed, this "wild life striving to be in the open" was precisely the substance of Wittgenstein's philosophical work.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=240}}

==1929–1941: Fellowship at Cambridge==

===PhD and fellowship===
[[File:Ludwig Wittgenstein.jpg|thumb|Ludwig Wittgenstein, 1930]]

According to Feigl (as reported by Monk), upon attending a conference in Vienna by mathematician Brouwer, Wittgenstein remained quite impressed, taking into consideration the possibility of a "return to Philosophy". At the urging of Ramsey and others, Wittgenstein returned to Cambridge in 1929. Keynes wrote in a letter to his wife: "Well, God has arrived. I met him on the 5.15 train."{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=255}} Despite this fame, he could not initially work at Cambridge as he did not have a degree, so he applied as an advanced undergraduate. Russell noted that his previous residency was sufficient to fulfill eligibility requirements for a PhD, and urged him to offer the ''Tractatus'' as his thesis.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} It was examined in 1929 by Russell and Moore; at the end of the thesis defence, Wittgenstein clapped the two examiners on the shoulder and said, "Don't worry, I know you'll never understand it."{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=271}} Moore wrote in the examiner's report: "I myself consider that this is a work of genius; but, even if I am completely mistaken and it is nothing of the sort, it is well above the standard required for the Ph.D. degree."&lt;ref&gt;R.

===Anschluss===

[[File:43. Ludwig Wittgenstein on holiday.jpg|thumb|Wittgenstein on holiday in [[France]] with Gilbert Pattisson, July 1936]]
From 1936 to 1937, Wittgenstein lived again in Norway,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wittgen-cam.ac.uk/cgi-bin/text/biogre8.html Ludwig Wittgenstein: Return to Cambridge] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103154319/http://www.wittgen-cam.ac.uk/cgi-bin/text/biogre8.html |date=3 November 2007 }} from the Cambridge Wittgenstein Archive&lt;/ref&gt; where he worked on the ''Philosophical Investigations''. In the winter of 1936/7, he delivered a series of "confessions" to close friends, most of them about minor infractions like white lies, in an effort to cleanse himself. In 1938, he travelled to Ireland to visit [[Maurice O'Connor Drury]], a friend who became a psychiatrist, and considered such training himself, with the intention of abandoning philosophy for it. The visit to Ireland was at the same time a response to the invitation of the then Irish [[Taoiseach]], [[Éamon de Valera]], himself a former mathematics teacher. De Valera hoped Wittgenstein's presence would contribute to the [[Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies]] which he was soon to set up.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history//Biographies/De_Valera.html MacTutor: Biography of Éamon de Valera] "The most important contribution de Valera made to mathematics both in Ireland and internationally was the foundation of the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies (DIAS) in 1940."&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:21. Photographs showing Wittgenstein’s house in Norway.jpg|left|thumb|213x213px|Photograph showing Wittgenstein’s house in [[Norway]], sent by Wittgenstein to [[G. E. Moore]], October 1936]]While he was in Ireland in March 1938, Germany annexed Austria in the ''Anschluss''; the Viennese Wittgenstein was now a citizen of the enlarged Germany and a Jew under the [[Nuremberg Laws|1935 Nuremberg racial laws]], because three of his grandparents had been born as Jews. The Nuremberg Laws classified people as Jews (''Volljuden'') if they had three or four Jewish grandparents, and as mixed blood (''[[Mischling]]'') if they had one or two. It meant ''inter alia'' that the Wittgensteins were restricted in whom they could marry or have sex with, and where they could work.&lt;ref name=Waugh137&gt;Waugh, pp. 137ff, 204–209.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Anschluss, his brother Paul left almost immediately for England, and later the US. The Nazis discovered his relationship with Hilde Schania, a brewer's daughter with whom he had had two children but whom he had never married, though he did later. Because she was not Jewish, he was served with a summons for ''[[Rassenschande]]'' (racial defilement). He told no one he was leaving the country, except for Hilde who agreed to follow him. He left so suddenly and quietly that for a time people believed he was the fourth Wittgenstein brother to have committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Waugh, pp. 224–226.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wittgenstein began to investigate acquiring British or Irish citizenship with the help of Keynes, and apparently had to confess to his friends in England that he had earlier misrepresented himself to them as having just one Jewish grandparent, when in fact he had three.&lt;ref&gt;For the view that Wittgenstein saw himself as a Jew, see Stern, David.

A few days before the invasion of Poland, Hitler personally granted ''Mischling'' status to the Wittgenstein siblings. In 1939 there were 2,100 applications for this, and Hitler granted only 12.&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds, Eidinow 2001, pp. 98, 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Anthony Gottlieb writes that the pretext was that their paternal grandfather had been the bastard son of a German prince, which allowed the Reichsbank to claim foreign currency, stocks and 1700&amp;nbsp;kg of gold held in Switzerland by a Wittgenstein family trust. Gretl, an American citizen by marriage, started the negotiations over the racial status of their grandfather, and the family's large foreign currency reserves were used as a bargaining tool. Paul had escaped to Switzerland and then the US in July 1938, and disagreed with the negotiations, leading to a permanent split between the siblings. After the war, when Paul was performing in Vienna, he did not visit Hermine who was dying there, and he had no further contact with Ludwig or Gretl.&lt;ref name=Gottlieb/&gt;

===Professor of philosophy===
[[File:46. Ludwig Wittgenstein in the Fellows' Garden.jpg|thumb|Wittgenstein in the Fellows’ Garden at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity]], 1939]]
After G. E. Moore resigned the chair in philosophy in 1939, Wittgenstein was elected, and acquired [[British subject|British citizenship]] soon afterwards. In July 1939 he travelled to Vienna to assist Gretl and his other sisters, visiting Berlin for one day to meet an official of the Reichsbank. After this, he travelled to New York to persuade Paul, whose agreement was required, to back the scheme. The required Befreiung was granted in August 1939. The unknown amount signed over to the Nazis by the Wittgenstein family, a week or so before the outbreak of war, included amongst many other assets, 1,700&amp;nbsp;kg of gold.&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds, Eidinow 2001, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a report Wittgenstein visited Moscow a second time in 1939, travelling from Berlin, and again met the philosopher [[Sofya Yanovskaya|Sophia Janowskaya]].&lt;ref&gt;Moran, John. "Wittgenstein and Russia" ''New Left Review'' 73, May–June 1972, pp. 83–96.&lt;/ref&gt;

Norman Malcolm, at the time a post-graduate research fellow at Cambridge, describes his first impressions of Wittgenstein in 1938: {{quote|"At a meeting of the Moral Science Club, after the paper for the evening was read and the discussion started, someone began to stammer a remark. He had extreme difficulty in expressing himself and his words were unintelligible to me. I whispered to my neighbour, 'Who's that?': he replied, 'Wittgenstein'. I was astonished because I had expected the famous author of the ''Tractatus'' to be an elderly man, whereas this man looked ''young'' – perhaps about 35. (His actual age was 49.) His face was lean and brown, his profile was aquiline and strikingly beautiful, his head was covered with a curly mass of brown hair. I observed the respectful attention that everyone in the room paid to him. After this unsuccessful beginning he did not speak for a time but was obviously struggling with his thoughts. His look was concentrated, he made striking gestures with his hands as if he was discoursing... Whether lecturing or conversing privately, Wittgenstein always spoke emphatically and with a distinctive intonation. He spoke excellent English, with the accent of an educated Englishman, although occasional Germanisms would appear in his constructions. His voice was resonant... His words came out, not fluently, but with great force. Anyone who heard him say anything knew that this was a singular person. His face was remarkably mobile and expressive when he talked. His eyes were deep and often fierce in their expression. His whole personality was commanding, even imperial."&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, pp. 23–4.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Describing Wittgenstein's lecture program, Malcolm continues: {{quote|"It is hardly correct to speak of these meetings as 'lectures', although this is what Wittgenstein called them. For one thing, he was carrying on original research in these meetings... Often the meetings consisted mainly of dialogue. Sometimes, however, when he was trying to draw a thought out of himself, he would prohibit, with a peremptory motion of the hand, any questions or remarks. There were frequent and prolonged periods of silence, with only an occasional mutter from Wittgenstein, and the stillest attention from the others. During these silences, Wittgenstein was extremely tense and active. His gaze was concentrated; his face was alive; his hands made arresting movements; his expression was stern. One knew that one was in the presence of extreme seriousness, absorption, and force of intellect... Wittgenstein was a frightening person at these classes."&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After work, the philosopher would often relax by watching [[Western Movie|Westerns]], where he preferred to sit at the very front of the cinema, or reading detective stories especially the ones written by [[Norbert Davis]].{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=528}}&lt;ref&gt;Hoffmann, Josef. [http://www.mysteryfile.com/NDavis/Wit.html "Hard-boiled Wit: Ludwig Wittgenstein and Norbert Davis"], ''CADS'', no. 44, October 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Norman Malcolm wrote that Wittgenstein would rush to the cinema when class ended.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

By this time, Wittgenstein's view on the [[foundations of mathematics]] had changed considerably. In his early 20s, Wittgenstein had thought logic could provide a solid foundation, and he had even considered updating Russell and [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]]'s ''[[Principia Mathematica]]''. Now he denied there were any mathematical facts to be discovered. He gave a series of lectures on mathematics, discussing this and other topics, documented in a book, with lectures by Wittgenstein and discussions between him and several students, including the young [[Alan Turing]] who described Wittgenstein as "a ''very'' peculiar man". The two had many discussions about the relationship between computational logic and everyday notions of truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Alan Turing: The Enigma |last = Hodges | first = Andrew | authorlink=Andrew Hodges | publisher = [[Vintage Books|Vintage]] |year = 2014|isbn = 978-1-784-70008-9|location = London|page = 194|title-link = Alan Turing: The Enigma }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Cora (ed.).

== 1941–1947: World War II and Guy's Hospital ==
[[File:50. Wittgenstein in Swansea (taken by Ben Richards).jpg|thumb|285x285px|Wittgenstein in [[Swansea]], Summer 1947]]
Monk writes that Wittgenstein found it intolerable that a war was going on and he was teaching philosophy. He grew angry when any of his students wanted to become professional philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;For his desire that his students not pursue philosophy, see Malcolm, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1941, he asked [[John Ryle (professor)|John Ryle]], the brother of the philosopher [[Gilbert Ryle]], if he could get a manual job at [[Guy's Hospital]] in London. John Ryle was professor of medicine at Cambridge and had been involved in helping Guy's prepare for [[the Blitz]]. Wittgenstein told Ryle he would die slowly if left at Cambridge, and he would rather die quickly. He started working at Guy's shortly afterwards as a dispensary porter, delivering drugs from the pharmacy to the wards where he apparently advised the patients not to take them.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=431}}

In the new year of 1942, Ryle took Wittgenstein to his home in Sussex to meet his wife who had been adamant to meet him. Ryle's son recorded the weekend in his diary;&lt;blockquote&gt;Wink is awful strange – not a very good english speaker, keeps on saying ‘I mean’ and ‘its “tolerable”’ meaning intolerable.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=434}} &lt;/blockquote&gt;The hospital staff were not told he was one of the world's most famous philosophers, though some of the medical staff did recognize him—at least one had attended Moral Sciences Club meetings—but they were discreet. "Good God, don't tell anybody who I am!" Wittgenstein begged one of them.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=432}} Some of them nevertheless called him Professor Wittgenstein, and he was allowed to dine with the doctors. He wrote on 1 April 1942: "I no longer feel any hope for the future of my life. It is as though I had before me nothing more than a long stretch of living death. I cannot imagine any future for me other than a ghastly one. Friendless and joyless."{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=431}} It was at this time that Wittgenstein had an operation at Guy's to remove a gall-stone that had troubled him for some years.

He had developed a friendship with Keith Kirk, a working-class teenage friend of [[Francis Skinner]], the mathematics undergraduate he had had a relationship with until Skinner's death in 1941 from [[polio]]. Skinner had given up academia, thanks at least in part to Wittgenstein's influence, and had been working as a mechanic in 1939, with Kirk as his apprentice. Kirk and Wittgenstein struck up a friendship, with Wittgenstein giving him lessons in physics to help him pass a [[City and Guilds]] exam. During his period of loneliness at Guy's he wrote in his diary: "For ten days I've heard nothing more from K, even though I pressed him a week ago for news. I think that he has perhaps broken with me. A ''tragic'' thought!"{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=443}} Kirk had in fact got married, and they never saw one another again.{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=442-423}}

While Wittgenstein was at Guy's he met Basil Reeve, a young doctor with an interest in philosophy, who, with R. T. Grant, was studying the effect of shock on air-raid casualties. When the blitz ended there were fewer casualties to study. In November 1942, Grant and Reeve moved to the [[Royal Victoria Infirmary]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], to study road traffic and industrial casualties. Grant offered Wittgenstein a position as a laboratory assistant at a wage of £4 per week, and he lived in Newcastle (at 28 Brandling Park, [[Jesmond]]&lt;ref name="Schardt"&gt;[http://www.newphilsoc.org.uk/OldWeb1/Wittgenstein/wittgenstein_upon_tyne.htm Wittgenstein Upon Tyne] Bill Schardt, Newcastle Philosophical Society. Retrieved December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;) from 29 April 1943 until February 1944.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=447}}

In the summer of 1946, Wittgenstein thought often of leaving Cambridge and resigning his position as Chair. Wittgenstein grew further dismayed at the state of philosophy, particularly about articles published in the journal [[Mind (journal)|''Mind'']]. It was around this time that Wittgenstein fell in love with Ben Richards writing in his diary, "The only thing that my love for B. has done for me is this: it has driven the other small worries associated with my position and my work into the background." On the 30th of September, Wittgenstein wrote about Cambridge after his return from Swansea, "Everything about the place repels me. The stiffness, the artificiality, the self-satisfaction of the people. The university atmosphere nauseates me."{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=493}}

Wittgenstein had only maintained contact with Fouracre from Guy's hospital who had joined the army in 1943 after his marriage, only returning in 1947. Wittgenstein maintained frequent correspondence with Fouracre during his time away displaying a desire for Fouracre to return home urgently from the war.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=493}}

In May 1947, Wittgenstein addressed a group of Oxford philosophers for the first time at the Jowett Society. The discussion was on the validity of [[René Descartes|Descartes']] [[Cogito ergo sum]] where Wittgenstein ignored the question and applied his own philosophical method. [[Harold Arthur Prichard]] who attended the event was not pleased with Wittgenstein's methods;&lt;blockquote&gt;Wittgenstein: If a man says to me, looking at the sky, ‘I think it will rain, therefore I exist,’ I do not understand him.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Prichard: That’s all very fine; what we want to know is: is the cogito valid or not?{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=496}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wittgenstein resigned the professorship at Cambridge in 1947 to concentrate on his writing, and in 1947 and 1948 travelled to [[Ireland]], staying at Ross's Hotel in [[Dublin]] and at a farmhouse in [[Redcross]], [[County Wicklow]], where he began the manuscript volume MS 137, Band R. Seeking solitude he moved to ''Rosro'', a holiday cottage in [[Connemara]] owned by Maurice O'Connor-Drury.&lt;ref name=archivefinalyears/&gt;

He also accepted an invitation from [[Norman Malcolm]], then professor at Cornell University, to stay with him and his wife for several months at [[Ithaca, New York]]. He made the trip in April 1949, although he told Malcolm he was too unwell to do philosophical work: "I haven't done any work since the beginning of March &amp; I haven't had the strength of even trying to do any." A doctor in Dublin had diagnosed anaemia and prescribed iron and liver pills. The details of Wittgenstein's stay in America are recounted in Norman Malcolm's ''Ludwig Wittgenstein: A Memoir''. During his summer in America, Wittgenstein began his epistemological discussions, in particular his engagement with [[philosophical skepticism]], that would eventually become the final fragments ''[[On Certainty]]''.
[[File:Ludwig Wittgenstein Blue Plaque, 76 Storey's Way, Cambridge, UK.jpg|thumb|The plaque at "Storey's End", 76 [[Storey's Way]], Cambridge, where Wittgenstein died.]]
He returned to London, where he was diagnosed with an inoperable [[prostate cancer]], which had spread to his bone marrow. He spent the next two months in Vienna, where his sister Hermine died on 11 February 1950; he went to see her every day, but she was hardly able to speak or recognize him. "Great loss for me and all of us," he wrote. "Greater than I would have thought." He moved around a lot after Hermine's death staying with various friends: to Cambridge in April 1950, where he stayed with [[Georg Henrik von Wright|G. H. von Wright]]; to London to stay with [[Rush Rhees]]; then to Oxford to see [[Elizabeth Anscombe]], writing to Norman Malcolm that he was hardly doing any philosophy. He went to Norway in August with Ben Richards, then returned to Cambridge, where on 27 November he moved into ''Storey's End'' at 76 [[Storey's Way]], the home of his doctor, [[Edward Vaughan Bevan|Edward Bevan]], and his wife Joan; he had told them he did not want to die in a hospital, so they said he could spend his last days in their home instead. Joan at first was afraid of Wittgenstein, but they soon became good friends.&lt;ref name="archivefinalyears"&gt;[http://www.wittgen-cam.ac.uk/cgi-bin/text/biogre11.html "Ludwig Wittgenstein: Final Years"], Cambridge Wittgenstein archive.

By the beginning of 1951, it was clear that he had little time left. He wrote a new will in Oxford on 29 January, naming Rhees as his executor, and Anscombe and von Wright his literary administrators, and wrote to Norman Malcolm that month to say, "My mind's completely dead. This isn't a complaint, for I don't really suffer from it. I know that life must have an end once and that mental life can cease before the rest does."&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, p. 79ff.&lt;/ref&gt; In February he returned to the Bevans' home to work on MS 175 and MS 176. These and other manuscripts were later published as ''[[Remarks on Colour]]'' and ''[[On Certainty]]''.&lt;ref name="archivefinalyears" /&gt; He wrote to Malcolm on 16 April 13 days before his death: "An extraordinary thing happened to me. About a month ago I suddenly found myself in the right frame of mind for doing philosophy. I had been ''absolutely'' certain that I'd never again be able to do it. It's the first time after more than 2 years that the curtain in my brain has gone up.—Of course, so far I've only worked for about 5 weeks &amp; it may be all over by tomorrow; but it bucks me up a lot now."&lt;ref name="Malcolm80"&gt;Malcolm, pp. 80–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
[[File:Death bed.jpg|thumb|Wittgenstein on his deathbed, 1951]]
Wittgenstein began work on his final manuscript, MS 177, on 25 April 1951. It was his 62nd birthday on 26 April. He went for a walk the next afternoon, and wrote his last entry that day, 27 April. That evening, he became very ill; when his doctor told him he might live only a few days, he reportedly replied, "Good!" Joan stayed with him throughout that night, and just before losing consciousness for the last time on 28 April, he told her: "Tell them I've had a wonderful life." Norman Malcolm describes this as a "...strangely moving utterance."&lt;ref name=Malcolm80/&gt;{{rquote|left|''I won't say 'See you tomorrow' because that would be like predicting the future, and I'm pretty sure I can't do that.''|Wittgenstein, 1949&lt;ref&gt;Drury, ''Recollections'', p. 160; cf. ''The Danger of Words'' (1973) p. ix, xiv&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Four of Wittgenstein's former students arrived at his bedside—Ben Richards, [[Elizabeth Anscombe]], [[Yorick Smythies]], and [[Maurice O'Connor Drury]]. Anscombe and Smythies were Catholics; and, at the latter's request, a Dominican friar, Father [[Conrad Pepler]], also attended. They were at first unsure what Wittgenstein would have wanted, but then remembered he had said he hoped his Catholic friends would pray for him, so they did, and he was pronounced dead shortly afterwards.[[File:Wittgenstein Gravestone.jpg|thumb|Wittgenstein's grave at the [[Ascension Parish Burial Ground, Cambridge|Ascension Parish Burial Ground]] in [[Cambridge]]]]

On his religious views, Wittgenstein was said to be greatly interested in [[Catholicism]] and was sympathetic to it. In his university years, he expressed belief in the [[resurrection of Jesus]].&lt;ref name="res"&gt;{{Citation |quote=What inclines even me to believe in Christ's resurrection? I play as it were with the thought.–If he did not rise from the dead, then he decomposed in the grave like every human being. He is dead &amp; decomposed. In that case he is a teacher, like any other &amp; can no longer help; &amp; we are once more orphaned &amp; alone. And have to make do with wisdom &amp; speculation. It is as though we are in a hell, where we can only dream &amp; are shut out from heaven, roofed in as it were. But if I am to be REALLY redeemed,– I need certainty–not wisdom, dreams, speculation–and this certainty is faith. And faith is faith in what my heart, my soul, needs, not my speculative intellect. For my soul, with its passions, as it were with its flesh and blood, must be redeemed, not my abstract mind. Perhaps one may say: Only love can believe the Resurrection. Or: it is love that believes the Resurrection |p=33 |title=Ludwig Wittgenstein, Culture and Value |first=Peter |last=Finch |location=Chicago |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he did not consider himself to be a Catholic. According to [[Norman Malcolm]], Wittgenstein saw Catholicism as more of a way of life than as a set of beliefs he personally held, considering that he did not accept any religious faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ludwig Wittgenstein: A Memoir|authors=Norman Malcolm; G. H. Von Wright|year=2001|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=9780199247592|pages=59–60|quote=I believe that Wittgenstein was prepared by his own character and experience to comprehend the idea of a judging and redeeming God. But any cosmological conception of a Deity, derived from the notions of cause or of infinity, would be repugnant to him. He was impatient with 'proofs' of the existence of God, and with attempts to give religion a rational foundation. ...I do not wish to give the impression that Wittgenstein accepted any religious faith—he certainly did not—or that he was a religious person. But I think that there was in him, in some sense, the possibility of religion. I believe that he looked on religion as a 'form of life' (to use an expression from the Investigations) in which he did not participate, but with which he was sympathetic and which greatly interested him. Those who did participate he respected — although here as elsewhere he had contempt for insincerity. I suspect that he regarded religious belief as based on qualities of character and will that he himself did not possess. Of Smythies and Anscombe, both of whom had become Roman Catholics, he once said to me: 'I could not possibly bring myself to believe all the things that they believe.' I think that in this remark he was not disparaging their belief. It was rather an observation about his own capacity.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Wittgenstein's Religious Point of View|year=2006|publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group]]|isbn=9780826490278|author=Tim Labron|page=47|quote=Wittgenstein has no goal to either support or reject religion; his only interest is to keep discussions, whether religious or not, clear.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wittgenstein was said by some commentators to be [[agnostic]], in a qualified sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Wittgenstein|year=2011|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9781136731372|author=William Child|page=218|quote="Was Wittgenstein religious?

The idea of a God in the sense of the Bible, the image of God as the creator of the world, hardly ever engaged Wittgenstein's attention..., but the notion of a [[last judgement]] was of profound concern to him." – (Engelmann)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ludwig Wittgenstein|year=2007|publisher=[[Reaktion Books]]|isbn=9781861893208|pages=145–146|author=Edward Kanterian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1953: Publication of the ''Philosophical Investigations''==
{{Main|Philosophical Investigations|Language-game|Private language argument}}
[[File:Kaninchen und Ente.png|thumb|Illustration of a "[[Rabbit–duck illusion|duckrabbit]]", discussed in the ''Philosophical Investigations'', section XI, part II]]
The ''[[Blue and Brown Books|Blue Book]]'', a set of notes dictated to his class at Cambridge in 1933–1934, contains the seeds of Wittgenstein's later thoughts on language and is widely read as a turning-point in his philosophy of language.

''Philosophical Investigations'' was published in two parts in 1953. Most of Part I was ready for printing in 1946, but Wittgenstein withdrew the manuscript from his publisher. The shorter Part II was added by his editors, Elizabeth Anscombe and Rush Rhees. Wittgenstein asks the reader to think of language as a multiplicity of language-games within which parts of language develop and function. He argues the bewitchments of philosophical problems arise from philosophers' misguided attempts to consider the meaning of words independently of their context, usage, and grammar, what he called "language gone on holiday."&lt;ref&gt;''PI'', §38.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Wittgenstein, philosophical problems arise when language is forced from its proper home into a metaphysical environment, where all the familiar and necessary landmarks and contextual clues are removed. He describes this metaphysical environment as like being on frictionless ice: where the conditions are apparently perfect for a philosophically and logically perfect language, all philosophical problems can be solved without the muddying effects of everyday contexts; but where, precisely because of the lack of friction, language can in fact do no work at all.&lt;ref&gt;''PI'', §107.&lt;/ref&gt; Wittgenstein argues that philosophers must leave the frictionless ice and return to the "rough ground" of ordinary language in use. Much of the ''Investigations'' consists of examples of how the first false steps can be avoided, so that philosophical problems are dissolved, rather than solved: "the clarity we are aiming at is indeed ''complete'' clarity. But this simply means that the philosophical problems should ''completely'' disappear."&lt;ref&gt;''PI'', §133.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Wittgenstein left a voluminous archive of unpublished papers, including 83 manuscripts, 46 typescripts and 11 dictations, amounting to an estimated 20,000 pages. Choosing among repeated drafts, revisions, corrections and loose notes editorial work has found nearly one third of the total suitable for print.&lt;ref&gt;Stern D., "The Bergen Electronic Edition of Wittgenstein's Nachlass", ''[[European Journal of Philosophy]]'', Vol 18, Issue 3, September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; An Internet facility hosted by the [[University of Bergen]] allows access to images of almost all the material and to search the available transcriptions.&lt;ref&gt;The Wittgenstein Archives at the University of Bergen [http://wab.uib.no/wab_nachlass.page/ (WAB)]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 two new boxes of Wittgenstein papers were found.&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge University Press release: [http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/unpublished-wittgenstein-archive-explored Unpublished Wittgenstein Archive explored]&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' was the only nearly finished project and the book was published in 1953.

In 1999 a survey among American university and college teachers ranked the ''Investigations'' as the most important book of 20th-century philosophy, standing out as "the one crossover masterpiece in twentieth-century philosophy, appealing across diverse specializations and philosophical orientations."&lt;ref name="here"/&gt; The ''Investigations'' also ranked 54th on a list of most influential twentieth-century works in cognitive science prepared by the University of Minnesota's Center for Cognitive Sciences.&lt;ref name="milproj"/&gt;

[[Peter Hacker]] argues that Wittgenstein's influence on 20th-century analytical philosophy can be attributed to his early influence on the Vienna Circle and later influence on the Oxford "ordinary language" school and Cambridge philosophers.&lt;ref name=hacker&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter Hacker|url=http://philosophynow.org/issues/58/Peter_Hacker|website=Philosophy Now|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wittgenstein's influence has been felt in nearly every field of the humanities and social sciences, yet there are diverging interpretations of his thought. In the words of his friend and colleague [[Georg Henrik von Wright]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;He was of the opinion... that his ideas were generally misunderstood and distorted even by those who professed to be his disciples. He doubted he would be better understood in the future. He once said he felt as though he was writing for people who would think in a different way, breathe a different air of life, from that of present-day men.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Interpreters===
Since Wittgenstein's death, scholarly interpretations of his philosophy have differed. Scholars have differed on the continuity between "early" and "late" Wittgenstein (that is, the difference between his views expressed in the ''Tractatus'' and those in ''Philosophical Investigations''), with some seeing the two as starkly disparate and others stressing the gradual transition between the two works through analysis of Wittgenstein's unpublished papers (the ''[[Nachlass]]'').&lt;ref name="Glock"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Glock|first1=Hans-Johann|editor1-last=Kahane|editor1-first=Guy|editor2-last=Kanterian|editor2-first=Edward|editor3-last=Kuusela|editor3-first=Oskari|title=Wittgenstein and his interpreters: essays in memory of Gordon Baker|date=2007|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=9781405129220|pages=37–65|chapter=Perspectives on Wittgenstein: An Intermittently Opinionated Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One significant debate in Wittgenstein scholarship concerns the work of interpreters who are referred to under the banner of [[The New Wittgenstein]] school such as [[Cora Diamond]], [[Alice Crary]], and [[James F. Conant]].  While the ''Tractatus'', particularly in its conclusion, seems paradoxical and self-undermining, New Wittgenstein scholars advance a "therapeutic" understanding of Wittgenstein's work—"an understanding of Wittgenstein as aspiring, not to advance metaphysical theories, but rather to help us work ourselves out of confusions we become entangled in when philosophizing."{{sfn|Crary|2000|p=1}} To support this goal, the New Wittgenstein scholars propose a reading of the ''Tractatus'' as "plain nonsense"—arguing it does not attempt to convey a substantive philosophical project but instead simply tries to push the reader to abandon philosophical speculation. The therapeutic approach traces its roots to the philosophical work of [[John Wisdom]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=John|last=Wisdom|title=Philosophy and Psycho-Analysis|publisher=Blackwell|date=1953}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the review of ''The Blue Book'' written by [[Oets Kolk Bouwsma]].&lt;ref name="Glock" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bouwsma|first1=O. K.|title=The Blue Book|journal=The Journal of Philosophy|date=16 March 1961|volume=58|issue=6|pages=141–162|doi=10.2307/2023409|jstor=2023409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The therapeutic approach is not without critics: [[Hans-Johann Glock]] argues that the "plain nonsense" reading of the ''Tractatus'' "...is at odds with the external evidence, writings and conversations in which Wittgenstein states that the ''Tractatus'' is committed to the idea of ineffable insight."&lt;ref name="Glock" /&gt;

====Bertrand Russell====
In October 1944, Wittgenstein returned to Cambridge around the same time as Russell who had been living in [[United States|America]] for several years. Russell returned to Cambridge after a backlash in America to his writings on morals and religion. Wittgenstein said of Russell's works to Drury;&lt;blockquote&gt;Russell’s books should be bound in two colours…those dealing with mathematical logic in red – and all students of philosophy should read them; those dealing with ethics and politics in blue – and no one should be allowed to read them.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=471}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;Russell made similar disparaging comments about Wittgenstein's later work;&lt;blockquote&gt;I have not found in Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations anything that seemed to me interesting and I do not understand why a whole school finds important wisdom in its pages. Psychologically this is surprising. The earlier Wittgenstein, whom I knew intimately, was a man addicted to passionately intense thinking, profoundly aware of difficult problems of which I, like him, felt the importance, and possessed (or at least so I thought) of true philosophical genius. The later Wittgenstein, on the contrary, seems to have grown tired of serious thinking and to have invented a doctrine which would make such an activity unnecessary. I do not for one moment believe that the doctrine which has these lazy consequences is true. I realize, however, that I have an overpoweringly strong bias against it, for, if it is true, philosophy is, at best, a slight help to lexicographers, and at worst, an idle tea-table amusement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=My Philosophical Development|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|year=1959|isbn=978-0041920154|location=New York|pages=216–217}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Saul Kripke]]'s 1982 book ''[[Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language]]'' contends that the central argument of [[Wittgenstein]]'s ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' centers on a devastating [[rule-following paradox]] that undermines the possibility of our ever following rules in our use of language.  Kripke writes that this paradox is "the most radical and original skeptical problem that philosophy has seen to date."&lt;ref&gt;Kripke, Saul. ''Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language''. Basil Blackwell Publishing, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kripke's book generated a large secondary literature, divided between those who find his skeptical problem interesting and perceptive, and others, such as [[Gordon Baker]] and [[Peter Hacker]], who argue that his meaning skepticism is a pseudo-problem that stems from a confused, selective reading of Wittgenstein. Kripke's position has, however recently been defended against these and other attacks by the Cambridge philosopher [[Martin Kusch]] (2006), and Wittgenstein scholar [[David G. Stern]] considers the book to be "the most influential and widely discussed" work on Wittgenstein since the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Stern, David G. 2006.  Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations: An Introduction.  Cambridge University Press. p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Pigliucci was born in [[Monrovia, Liberia]] and raised in [[Rome, Italy]].&lt;ref name=cvitae/&gt; He has a doctorate in [[genetics]] from the [[University of Ferrara]], [[Italy]], a PhD in [[biology]] from the [[University of Connecticut]], and a PhD in [[philosophy of science]] from the [[University of Tennessee]].&lt;ref name=ShortBio&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lehman.edu/deanhum/philosophy/platofootnote/PlatoFootnote.org/Plato_files/bio.pdf |title=Massimo Pigliucci — Short Bio }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a fellow of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] and of the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]].&lt;ref name=cvitae/&gt;

Pigliucci was formerly a professor of [[ecology]] and [[evolution]] at [[Stony Brook University]]. He explored [[phenotypic plasticity]], [[genotype]]-environment interactions, [[natural selection]], and the constraints imposed on natural selection by the genetic and developmental makeup of organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lehman.edu/deanhum/philosophy/platofootnote/PlatoFootnote.org/Papers.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120805080631/http://www.lehman.edu/deanhum/philosophy/platofootnote/PlatoFootnote.org/Papers.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-08-05 |title=Massimo Pigliucci — Selected Papers }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, while working at the University of Tennessee, Pigliucci received the [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]] Prize,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.evolutionsociety.org/awards.htm |title=Society for the Study of Evolution — Description of Awards}}&lt;/ref&gt; awarded annually by the [[Society for the Study of Evolution]]&lt;ref name=cvitae/&gt; to recognize the accomplishments and future promise of an outstanding young evolutionary biologist. As a philosopher, Pigliucci is interested in the structure and foundations of [[evolutionary theory]], the [[relationship between science and philosophy]], and the [[relationship between science and religion]].{{r|ShortBio}} He is a proponent of the [[extended evolutionary synthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;Wade, Michael J. (2011). [http://bioscience.oxfordjournals.org/content/61/5/407.full "The Neo-Modern Synthesis: The Confluence of New Data and Explanatory Concepts"] BioScience 61: 407-408.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pigliucci writes regularly for ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'' on topics such as [[climate change denial]], [[intelligent design]], [[pseudoscience]], and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry |url=http://www.csicop.org/author/massimopigliucci/ |title=Massimo Pigliucci}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also written for ''[[Philosophy Now]]'' and maintains a blog called "Rationally Speaking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rationallyspeaking.blogspot.com/ |title=Rationally Speaking — a blog by Pigliucci about skepticism and humanism}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has debated "deniers of evolution" ([[young-earth creationists]] and [[intelligent design]] proponents), including young earth creationists [[Duane Gish]] and [[Kent Hovind]] and intelligent design proponents [[William Dembski]] and [[Jonathan Wells (intelligent design advocate)|Jonathan Wells]], on many occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Pigliucci | first=Massimo | title=Denying evolution: creationism, scientism, and the nature of science | year=2002 | publisher=[[Sinauer Associates]] | location=Sunderland, Mass.  | isbn=0-87893-659-9 | pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://old.richarddawkins.net/audio/606-evolution-debate-pigliucci-vs-hovind | title=Evolution Debate — Pigliucci vs Hovind | publisher=[[Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science]] | date=January 31, 2007 | accessdate=2012-12-16 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611133833/http://old.richarddawkins.net/audio/606-evolution-debate-pigliucci-vs-hovind | archivedate=June 11, 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CV of William Dembski|url=http://designinference.com/dembski-on-intelligent-design/dembski-curriculum-vitae-resume/|accessdate=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.hoover.org/multimedia/uk/2933961.html | title=Evolution and Intelligent Design: Pigliucci vs Wells | publisher=[[Uncommon Knowledge]] | date=January 14, 2005 | accessdate=2008-07-17 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308173157/http://www.hoover.org/multimedia/uk/2933961.html | archivedate=March 8, 2008 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical thinking and scepticism==
{{for |his views on the [[Search for extraterrestrial intelligence]]|Search for extraterrestrial intelligence#Massimo Pigliucci}}
While Pigliucci is an [[Atheism|atheist]] himself,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rationallyspeaking.blogspot.com/2008/08/excommunicated-by-atheists.html |last=Pigliucci |first=Massimo |date=18 August 2008 |title=Excommunicated by the Atheists!}}&lt;/ref&gt; he does not believe that science necessarily demands atheism because of two distinctions: the distinction between [[methodological naturalism]] and [[philosophical naturalism]], and the distinction between [[Fact-value distinction|value judgements and matters of fact]]. He believes that many scientists and science educators fail to appreciate these differences.&lt;ref name=nature/&gt; Pigliucci has criticized [[New Atheism|New Atheist]] writers for embracing what he considers to be [[scientism]] (although he largely excludes philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]] from this charge).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pigliucci, M.  |year=2013 |title=New Atheism and the Scientistic Turn in the Atheism Movement |journal=Midwest Studies In Philosophy |volume=37 |number=1 |pages=142–153 |url=http://philpapers.org/archive/PIGNAA.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a discussion of his book ''Answers for Aristotle: How Science and Philosophy Can Lead Us to a More Meaningful Life'', Pigliucci told  [[Skepticality]] podcast host [[Derek Colanduno]], "Aristotle was the first ancient thinker to really take seriously the idea that you need both empirical facts, you need an evidence-based approach to the world and you need to be able to reflect on the meaning of those facts... If you want answers to moral questions then you don't ask the neurobiologist, you don't ask the evolutionary biologist, you ask the philosopher."&lt;ref name=Skepticality&gt;{{cite web|last=Colanduno|first=Derek|authorlink=Derek Colanduno|title=Should You Answer Aristotle?|url=http://www.skepticality.com/should-you-answer-aristotle/|work=Skepticality Podcast|publisher=Skeptic Magazine|accessdate=14 May 2014|format=Audio|date=13 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pigliucci describes the mission of skeptics, referencing [[Carl Sagan]]'s ''[[The Demon-Haunted World|Demon Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark]]'' saying "What skeptics are about is to keep that candle lit and spread it as much as possible".&lt;ref name=skepticzone&gt;{{cite podcast|url=http://skepticzone.libsyn.com/webpage/2010/09 |title=The Skeptic Zone #101 |host=[[Richard Saunders (skeptic)|Richard Saunders]] |date=24 September 2010 |time=32:50 |accessdate=20 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pigliucci serves on the board of NYC Skeptics and on the advisory board of the [[Secular Coalition for America]].&lt;ref name=coalition/&gt;

In 2001, he debated [[William Lane Craig]] over the [[existence of God]].&lt;ref&gt;Moreland, J.P. (2013). Debating Christian Theism. USA: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0199755431}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Massimo Pigliucci criticised the [[newspaper]] article by [[Pope Francis]] entitled, "An open dialogue with non-believers". Pigliucci viewed the article as a monologue rather than a dialogue and, in a response personally addressed to Pope Francis, wrote that the Pope only offered non-believers "a reaffirmation of entirely unsubstantiated fantasies about God and his Son...followed by a confusion between the concept of love and truth, the whole peppered by a significant amount of historical revisionism and downright denial of the ugliest facets of your Church."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rationallyspeaking.blogspot.co.uk/2013/09/dear-pope.html |title=Dear Pope |last=Pigliucci |first=Massimo |date=20 September 2013 |website=Rationally Speaking}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rationally Speaking===
In August 2000 Massimo started with a monthly internet column called Rationally Speaking. In August 2005, the column became a blog,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rationallyspeaking.blogspot.nl/2005/08/welcome-everyone.html |last=Pigliucci |first=Massimo |date=1 August 2005 |title=Welcome, everyone!}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he wrote posts until March 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rationallyspeaking.blogspot.nl/2014/03/so-long-and-thanks-for-all-fish.html |last=Pigliucci |first=Massimo |date=20 March 2014 |title=So long, and thanks for all the fish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1 February 2010, he co-hosted the bi-weekly ''Rationally Speaking'' podcast together with [[Julia Galef]], whom he first met at the [[Northeast Conference on Science and Skepticism]], held in September 2009.&lt;ref name="THH83"&gt;{{Cite episode |url=http://thehumanist.com/multimedia/the-humanist-hour//2013/05/the-humanist-hour-83-julia-galef/ |title=Julia Galef |last=Stiefel |first=Todd |last2=Metskas |first2=Amanda K. |series=The Humanist Hour |number=083 |format=podcast |publisher=The Humanist |date=22 May 2013 |accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The podcast is produced by the [[New York City Skeptics]]. He left the podcast in 2015 to pursue other interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast | url=http://rationallyspeakingpodcast.org/show/rs128-5th-anniversary-live-show.html | title=RS128 - 5th Anniversary Live Show | website=Rationally Speaking | publisher=New York City Skeptics | host=Pigliucci, Massimo and Galef, Julia | date=27 February 2015 | time= | access-date=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, [[Neil DeGrasse Tyson]] explained on the show his justification for spending large amounts of government money on space programs. He eventually printed the transcript of his performance as a guest on the show in his book ''[[Space Chronicles]]'' as a full chapter covering eight pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Culp |first=Jennifer |date=2014 |title=Neil DeGrasse Tyson |url= |location= |series=Great Science Writers Series |publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group |page=74 |isbn=9781477776926 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another episode in which Tyson explained his position on the label "atheism" received attention on [[NPR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/13.7/2014/12/08/369356881/what-if-atheists-were-defined-by-their-actions |title=What If Atheists Were Defined By Their Actions? |last=Lombrozo |first=Tania |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=8 December 2014 |accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Meeting of the minds''' (also referred to as '''mutual agreement''', '''mutual assent''' or '''''consensus ad idem''''') is a phrase in [[Contract|contract law]] used to describe the intentions of the parties forming the contract. In particular, it refers to the situation where there is a common understanding in the formation of the contract. Formation of a contract is initiated with a proposal or offer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.learningthelaw.in/2016/08/what-is-offer-or-proposal-under.html What is an Offer or proposal under the Contract Law?], available at Learning the Law.&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Covenant (law)|condition]] or element is considered a requirement to the formation of a [[contract]] in some jurisdictions.

Richard Austen-Baker has suggested that the perpetuation of the idea of 'meeting of minds' may come from a misunderstanding of the Latin term ''consensus ad idem'', which actually means 'agreement to the [same] thing'.&lt;ref&gt;R. Austen-Baker, 'Gilmore and the Strange Case of the Failure of Contract to Die After All' (2002) 18 ''Journal of Contract Law'' 1&lt;/ref&gt; There must be [[Evidence (law)|evidence]] that the parties had each, from an [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] perspective, engaged in conduct manifesting their [[wiktionary:assent|assent]], and a contract will be formed when the parties have met such a requirement.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Lord Steyn, 'Contract Law: Fulfilling the Reasonable Expectations of Honest Men' (1997) 113 LQR 433; c.f. § 133 BGB in Germany, where "the actual will of the contracting party, not the literal sense of words, is to be determined"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept in academic work==
{{Contract law}}
German jurist, [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny]] is usually credited with developing the [[will theory of contract]] in his work ''[[System des heutigen Römischen Rechts]]'' (1840).&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Carl von Savigny, ''[http://dlib-pr.mpier.mpg.de/m/kleioc/0010/exec/books/%22199236%22 System des heutigen Römischen Rechts]'', 8 vols. (Berlin: Veit, 1840–9) online, in German&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sir Frederick Pollock, 3rd Baronet|Sir Frederick Pollock]] is one person known for expounding the idea of a contract based on a meeting of minds, at which time it gained much support in the courts.

[[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] wrote in 1897 that a meeting of minds was really a fiction.

{{cquote|In the law of contract the use of moral phraseology led to equal confusion, as I have shown in part already, but only in part. Morals deal with the actual internal state of the individual's mind, what he actually intends. From the time of the Romans down to now, this mode of dealing has affected the language of the law as to contract, and the language used has reacted upon the thought. We talk about a contract as a meeting of the minds of the parties, and thence it is inferred in various cases that there is no contract because their minds have not met; that is, because they have intended different things or because one party has not known of the assent of the other. Yet nothing is more certain than that parties may be bound by a contract to things which neither of them intended, and when one does not know of the other's assent. Suppose a contract is executed in due form and in writing to deliver a lecture, mentioning no time. One of the parties thinks that the promise will be construed to mean at once, within a week. The other thinks that it means when he is ready. The court says that it means within a reasonable time. The parties are bound by the contract as it is interpreted by the court, yet neither of them meant what the court declares that they have said. In my opinion no one will understand the true theory of contract or be able even to discuss some fundamental questions intelligently until he has understood that all contracts are formal, that the making of a contract depends not on the agreement of two minds in one intention, but on the agreement of two sets of external signs — not on the parties' having meant the same thing but on their having said the same thing.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., [http://www.constitution.org/lrev/owh/path_law.htm 'The Path of the Law'] (1897) 10 ''Harvard Law Review'' 457&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The English contracts scholar Richard Austen-Baker has suggested that the perpetuation of the concept into current times is based on a confusion of it with the concept of a ''consensus ad idem'' ("agreement to the same [thing]") which is an undoubted requirement of [[synallagmatic contracting]], and that this confusion may be the result of recent ignorance of Latin.&lt;ref&gt;R. Austen-Baker, 'Gilmore and the Strange Case of the Failure of Contract to Die After All' (2002) 18 ''Journal of Contract Law'' 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in case law==
In ''[[Household Fire and Carriage Accident Insurance Co Ltd v Grant]]'' (1879) 4 Ex D 216, [[Thesiger LJ]] said, in the course of a judgment on the [[postal rule]],

{{cquote|Now, whatever in abstract discussion may be said as to the legal notion of its being necessary, in order to the effecting of a valid and binding contract, that the minds of the parties should be brought together at one and the same moment, that notion is practically the foundation of [[English law]] upon the subject of the formation of contracts. Unless therefore a contract constituted by correspondence is absolutely concluded at the moment that the continuing offer is accepted by the person to whom the offer is addressed, it is difficult to see how the two minds are ever to be brought together at one and the same moment...&lt;ref&gt;Thesiger LJ then refers to ''[[Adams v. Lindsell]]'' as supporting this proposition.&lt;/ref&gt; But on the other hand it is a principle of law, as well established as the legal notion to which I have referred, that the minds of the two parties must be brought together by mutual communication. An acceptance, which only remains in the breast of the acceptor without being actually and by legal implication communicated to the offerer, is no binding acceptance.}}

In ''[[Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company]]'' [1893] 1 QB 256, [[Bowen LJ]] said,

{{cquote|One cannot doubt that, as an ordinary rule of law, an acceptance of an offer made ought to be notified to the person who makes the offer, in order that the two minds may come together. Unless this is done the two minds may be apart, and there is not that consensus which is necessary according to the English law - I say nothing about the laws of other countries - to make a contract.}}

In ''[[Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. Co. v. United States]]'' (1923)&lt;ref&gt;261 U.S. 592, 597, 58 Ct.Cl. 709, 43 S.Ct. 425, 67 L.Ed. 816  (1923).&lt;/ref&gt; the [[US Supreme Court]] said an [[implied in fact contract]] is,

{{cquote|an agreement ...  founded upon a meeting of minds, which, although not embodied in an express  contract, is inferred, as a fact, from conduct of the parties showing, in the light  of the surrounding circumstances, their tacit understanding.}}

The [[reasoning]] is that a party should not be held to a [[contract]] that they were not even aware existed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} A mutual [[promise]] between friends over simple personal matters should not be a situation where [[legal remedy|legal remedies]] are to be used.  Equally, any such agreement where the obligation is primarily a [[moral obligation|moral]] one rather than a legal one should not be enforceable. It is only when all parties involved are aware of the formation of a ''legal obligation'' is there a meeting of the minds.

However, the awareness of a legal obligation is established, not through each party's subjective understanding of the terms, but on "objective indicators," based on what each party said and did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Texas Contract law | url = http://www.gaddywells.com/TEXAS_CONTRACT_LAW.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Ward v. Williams, Court of Appeals of Arkansas | url = http://courts.arkansas.gov/opinions/2002b/20021204/ca011209.html | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110721032945/http://courts.arkansas.gov/opinions/2002b/20021204/ca011209.html | archivedate = 2011-07-21 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the '''formalist theory of contract''', every contract must have six elements: [[Offer and acceptance#Offer|offer]], [[Offer and acceptance#Acceptance|acceptance]], [[consideration]], ''meeting of the minds'', [[Capacity (law)|capacity]] and [[legality]].  Many other contracts, but not all types of contracts, also must be in writing and be signed by the responsible party, in an element called '''form'''.  {{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

==Vices of consent==
Mutual assent is vitiated by actions such as [[fraud]], [[undue influence]], [[duress]] (see [[per minas]]), [[mutual mistake]], or [[misrepresentation]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} This may render a contract [[Void (law)|void]] or [[unenforceable]].

[[File:Philipp Albert Stapfer.jpg|thumb|upright|Philipp Albert Stapfer.]]
'''Philipp Albert Stapfer''' ([[Bern]], 23 September 1766 – [[Paris]], 27 March 1840) was a Swiss politician and philosopher.

He was the plenipotentiary envoi of the [[Helvetic Republic]] to the [[French consulate]] in Paris from 1801 till 1803. ( [[Act of Mediation]] )

He married and settled in France, at the [[Chateau de Talcy]] (Loir-et-Cher) and in Paris where he became the friend of [[Maine de Biran]] -in 1805 at informal gatherings of [[Pierre-Jean-Georges Cabanis|Cabanis]] circle at Auteuil. He was also vice-president of the Paris Protestant society.

He is the recipient of Maine de Biran's essay:
: ''"Réponses aux arguments contre l'aperception immédiate d'une liaison causale entre le vouloir primitif et la motion et contre la dérivation d'un principe universel et nécessaire de causalités de cette source."'' (1818);
an important résumé known as: ''"Réponses à Stapfer"''

==Pestalozzi==

Philipp Albert Stapfer also shared with [[Maine de Biran]] a pronounced interest in the educational experiments of [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]].

As a Minister of Sciences and Arts of the [[Helvetic Republic]] in 1798 he arranged the nomination of Pestalozzi as chief editor of the government paper "Helvetisches Volksblatt" -a post from which Pestalozzi quickly resigned.

In Paris Stapfer pleaded Pestalozzi's case for educational reform with [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], who denigrated the program for its alleged lack of real science.

Maine de Biran however -following the encounters with Stapfer at Auteuil and his own appointement as "sous-préfet" of the [[Dordogne]] in 1806- reformed the education in his department by inviting to Bergerac a teacher formed by Pestalozzi at [[Yverdon]].

==Philosopher==

Apart from being an involved and tolerant Protestant philosopher Stapfer, with [[André-Marie Ampère]], [[Joseph-Marie de Gérando]], [[Pierre Paul Royer-Collard]], [[Georges Cuvier]] and many others was a regular participant in the philosophical debates organised by [[Maine de Biran]], after the latter finally settled in Paris as an administrator in 1812.

Together with Degérando, who introduced Kant studies in France, he was one of Maine de Biran's main sources on the philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]] whose work he followed in its development by one of Kant's pupils: [[Friedrich Bouterwek]] (1766-1828), professor in Philosophy at the Georg August University in [[Göttingen]]. ''Meyers Lexicon'' Mannheim 1990 links Bouterwek with Maine de Biran. Bouterwek was already lecturing on Kant at Göttingen when Stapfer studied there in 1789-1790.

The extent of Stapfer's knowledge of Kant can be judged from the substantial (pagelong) notes he appended to Maine de Biran's: ''"Exposition de la doctrine philosophique de [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]. Composée pour la Biographie Universelle"'' (Paris: Michaud ed 1819). This exposition written at the instigation of Stapfer is one of  only two (authorised) philosophical texts by Maine de Biran published during his lifetime.
(Stapfer's notes were republished by Pierre Tisserand in his Oeuvres de Maine de Biran,1939 -Tome XI pp435–489 )

Stapfer long survived his immediate contemporaries de Biran and Bouterwek. He arranged for his own salon, inviting guests such as [[Victor Cousin]], [[Sainte-Beuve]], [[Guizot]] to whom he became an important material witness of the preceding decades.

It took the untiring persistence of Stapfer to encourage Victor Cousin and Joseph Lainé to classify and publish the works of Maine de Biran.

'''R. Adam Engle''' (born February 17, 1942 in Yonkers, NY, U.S.A.) is an American social entrepreneur who initiated and developed the [[Mind and Life Institute|Mind and Life Dialogues]] between the [[14th Dalai Lama]] of Tibet and panels of prominent scientists in the 1980s. Over the 22 years of his subsequent tenure as chief executive of the [[Mind and Life Institute]], which he co-founded in 1990, his work contributed significantly to the establishment of contemplative science as a new field of research.&lt;ref name=TM1&gt;Begley 2007, pp.19-22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BG122&gt;{{cite web|author1=Vincent Horn|title=The Evolution of the Mind and Life Dialogues|url=http://www.buddhistgeeks.com/2009/05/bg-122-the-evolution-of-the-mind-and-life-dialogues/|publisher=Buddhist Geeks|accessdate=9 May 2015|ref=BD 122|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504061533/http://www.buddhistgeeks.com/2009/05/bg-122-the-evolution-of-the-mind-and-life-dialogues/|archivedate=4 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Plasticmind&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sharon Begley|title=The Plastic Mind|date=2007|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-84529-674-2|pages=318–324|edition=Kindle|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fP6dBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT229&amp;lpg=PT229&amp;dq=r+adam+engle#v=onepage&amp;q=r%20adam%20engle&amp;f=false|chapter=Appendix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Original concept of Buddhism-science dialogues==
In 1983 the Harvard educated lawyer Engle, from [[Boulder, Colorado]], came to know of [[Tenzin Gyatso]], the 14th Dalai Lama's [[14th Dalai Lama#Interest in science.2C and Mind and Life Institute|interest in modern science]]&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite web|author1=Tenzin Gyatso|title=Our Faith in Science|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/12/opinion/12dalai.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;|publisher=New York Times|date=November 12, 2005|quote=Science has always fascinated me}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Melissa Rice|title=Carl Sagan and the Dalai Lama found deep connections in 1991-92 meetings, says Sagan's widow|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/2007/10/meeting-two-minds-carl-sagan-and-dalai-lama|publisher=Cormell University, Cornell Chronicle|date=October 3, 2007|quote=The Dalai Lama, who has had a lifelong interest in science}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, realising from his personal Buddhist studies that the concept of a Buddhism-science interface was potentially an important new scientific field to be researched, he contacted the Dalai Lama's office in India offering to arrange a dialogue for him with selected western scientists.&lt;ref name="Plasticmind"/&gt; The Dalai Lama accepted and authorised Engle to set one up and Engle arranged the first dialogue to take place between him and five scientists in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Begley 2007, pp.19-20&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next 25 years Engle organised dozens of international conferences between meditators and scientists and oversaw the publication of 11 top-selling books in a successful strategy to establish and popularise the new field of the Contemplative Sciences.

==Development of Mind and Life Institute==
The initial meetings in the 1980s were so successful that Engle registered and funded the [[Mind and Life Institute]] in 1990 in the US as a [[501(c)(3) organization|not-for-profit 501(c)(3) organisation]] dedicated to exploring the interface between science and Buddhism. His two other co-founders were [[Tenzin Gyatso]] the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet who would chair the dialogues and [[Francisco Varela]] the late Chilean neuroscientist, who until his untimely death in 2001 would coordinate the teams of scientists with relevant specialisations for each conference according to its theme.&lt;ref name=TM1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=BG122 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Plasticmind /&gt;

On the institute's formal establishment in 1990 Engle, as its creator, became its Chair and CEO, a post he held for 22 years until his retirement in 2012. By then he had guided its development into "a worldwide and influential  organisation bringing together the highest standards of modern science and contemplative practice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Matthieu Ricard|title=Celebrating the Twenty-Fifth Anniversary of the Mind and Life Institute|url=http://www.matthieuricard.org/en/blog/posts/celebrating-the-twenty-fifth-anniversary-of-the-mind-and-life-institute|website=Matthieu Ricard, Buddhist monk, photographer and author|accessdate=28 July 2015|date=January 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Launch of formal scientific research programmes==
In 1998, to optimise the potential for societal benefits, Engle broadened his institute's initial mission to include carrying out formal scientific research.&lt;ref name="BG122" /&gt; At the next dialogue in 2000 Engle proposed that a series of scientific investigations should be carried out under laboratory conditions with the aim of establishing whether Buddhist contemplative practices could be of significant benefit to modern society. This proved to be the case and so Engle's next task was to develop ways of teaching the subject in a secular environment.&lt;ref name="BG122" /&gt;
As an outcome of his organisation's next dialogue, held at [[MIT]] in 2003 and entitled ‘Investigating the Mind’ (the first one to be held as a public event, with an audience of 1,200), Engle took the initial steps to launch the first formal scientific research programme on this subject.&lt;ref&gt;Barinaga M. Buddhism and neuroscience. Studying the well-trained mind. Science. 2003 Oct 3;302(5642):44-6. {{PMID|14526055}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participanting scientists included Nobel Laureate [[Daniel Kahneman]] and [[Eric Lander]], Director of the MIT [[Center for Genome Research]].&lt;ref name=pd/&gt; This conference marked the birth of [[Contemplative neuroscience|Contemplative Neuroscience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Harrington, Zajonc|title=The Dalai Lama at MIT|date=2003|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=USA|isbn=0674023196|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e1ZxmnsIEIQC&amp;pg=PA3|quote=Records of Conference "Investigating the Mind" at MIT}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Claudia Kalb|title=Dalai Lama: Moment For Meditation|url=http://www.newsweek.com/dalai-lama-moment-meditation-136251|accessdate=1 August 2015|publisher=Newsweek|date=September 21, 2003|quote=Adam Engle… hopes that the conference will be a catalyst to attract young scientists to the field and to launch rigorous new research.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Denise Brehm|title=Dalai Lama enlists science in quest for 'a happy mind'|url=http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2003/dalai-lama-enlists-science-quest-happy-mind-1|accessdate=1 August 2015|publisher=MIT News|date=September 17, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Engle announced the launch of the annual Summer Research Institute at the [[Garrison Institute]] offering a new curriculum on [[contemplative neuroscience]] to graduates, post doctorates and members of the science faculty.&lt;ref&gt;Begley, 2007 p.260&lt;/ref&gt; He also launched the annual [[Francisco J. Varela]] Research Awards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mind and Life Summer Research Institute and Francisco J.

==Establishment of Contemplative Sciences==
In 2012 Engle's strategy to establish the new field of Contemplative Sciences was completed when he initiated an International Symposium on Contemplative Studies in Denver Colorado, with 700 representatives from Contemplative Science and Studies research bodies in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Katy Killam|title=International Symposia for Contemplative Studies|url=http://positivepsychologynews.com/news/kasley-killiam/2012050722023|website=Positive Psychology News Daily|accessdate=4 August 2015|date=May 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time Engle retired from Mind and Life Institute in 2012 he had directed the organisation of 27 international dialogues, both private and public, between the Dalai Lama and other meditators and prominent scientists. To document the discussions and outcomes of the first 13 of these events, by 2012 eleven books (listed below) had been published under his oversight and videos or DVDs had been released covering most of the others.&lt;ref name=pd&gt;{{cite web|title=Dialogues with the Dalai Lama - Past Dialogues|url=https://www.mindandlife.org/dialogues-dalai-lama/|website=Mind and Life Institute|publisher=Mind and Life Institute|accessdate=13 August 2015|quote=[list of dialogues with location, subject, participants etc.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Raimund Gaita (later styled as Raimond Gaita) was born in [[Dortmund]], Westphalia, Germany, on 14 May 1946, to a Yugoslav-born, Romanian father, Romulus Gaiţă (28 December 1922{{spaced ndash}}May 1996) and a German mother, Christine ('Christel') Anna Dörr (16 November 1928{{spaced ndash}}1958).&lt;ref name="NAA Romulus"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/SearchNRetrieve/Gallery151/dist/JGalleryViewer.aspx?B=4105197&amp;S=1&amp;N=27#/SearchNRetrieve/NAAMedia/ShowImage.aspx?B=4105197&amp;T=P&amp;S=1 | title = Digital Item Page Gallery: A12025, 724-726: Gaita Romulus born 28 December 1922; Christine born 6 November 1928; Raimund [Raimond] born 14 May 1946 | publisher = [[National Archives of Australia]] | accessdate = 28 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany from 1942 to 1945 Romulus was employed as a smith and metal worker.&lt;ref name="NAA Romulus"/&gt; The Gaita family migrated to Australia in April 1950, just before Raimond turned four.&lt;ref name="NAA Christine"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/SearchNRetrieve/Gallery151/dist/JGalleryViewer.aspx?B=30263624&amp;S=1&amp;N=5#/SearchNRetrieve/NAAMedia/ShowImage.aspx?B=30263624&amp;T=P&amp;S=1 | title = Digital Item Page Gallery: B78, Yugoslavian/Gaita Christine: Gaita Christine – Nationality: Yugoslavian – Arrived Melbourne per General M L Hersey 27 April 1950 | publisher = National Archives of Australia | accessdate = 28 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[St. Patrick's College, Ballarat]] ([[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]), [[Melbourne High School]] (Victoria), the [[University of Melbourne]] (BA Hons, MA) and the [[University of Leeds]] (PhD).

In a later book, ''After Romulus, a collection of essays'', "he reflects on the writing of the ''Romulus, My Father'', the making of the film, his relationship to the desolate beauty of the central Victorian landscape, the philosophies that underpinned his father's relationship to the world and, most movingly, the presence and absence of his mother and his unassuaged longing for her". (from the publisher)

He is married to [[Yael Gaita]], who was born in [[Tel Aviv]] and until 2008 was a teacher at [[King David School, Melbourne]], where she taught [[Hebrew]]. Gaita has two children, Katerina and Eva and two step children, Dahlia and Michelle.

===Political positions and views===
{{Main|Humility|Appeal to tradition}}

His views reflected the [[religious conservatism]] but has strongly voice for the religious sanity and the [[interfaith dialogue]] among the three [[Abrahamic religions]]– [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]].&lt;ref name="vimeo.com" /&gt; In his public speaking at the conservative conventions in the country, Zafar-ul-Haq has strongly stressed and argued for the religious [[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]].&lt;ref name="vimeo.com" /&gt;

In 2005, Zafar-ul-Haq demanded the inquiry commission on [[Kargil war|kargil debacle]] to be investigated by the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan]] to point and recommend the punishment for those involved.{{rp|35}}&lt;ref name="Pakistan Political Perspective"/&gt;

After his removal from the Minister of Religious Affairs in 1999 due to the [[Musharraf coup|military takeover]] in 1999, Zafar-ul-Haq viewed very negatively of the performance of the [[Pervez Musharraf|Musharraf administration]], which he believed was working towards [[Violence in Pakistan 2006–09|weakening the state]] on a deliberate international agenda.&lt;ref name="vimeo.com" /&gt; In an interview in 2012, Zafar-ul-Haq held President Musharraf responsible of promoting [[religious intolerance]] in the country by introducing legislative reforms reflecting against the teachings of [[Islam]] without the consent of the public.&lt;ref name="vimeo.com" /&gt; He also accused Musharraf of starting the [[Kargil war|starting the armed conflict]] to harm the Kashmir cause, and raised his voice for [[Civilian control of the military|civilian control]] of the military.&lt;ref name="vimeo.com" /&gt; Though, he has repeatedly spoke very high of Nawaz Sharif's services done to the country and Islam, he remained unsympathetic to suicide attacks being taken placed on [[Pervez Musharraf]].&lt;ref name="vimeo.com" /&gt;

'''''[http://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/apost_exhortations/documents/hf_jp-ii_exh_15081989_redemptoris-custos.html Redemptoris custos]''''' (''Guardian of the Redeemer'') is the title of an [[apostolic exhortation]] by [[Pope John Paul II]] on [[Saint Joseph]]. It was delivered on August 15, 1989 in [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] in [[Rome]] on the occasion of the centenary of Pope [[Leo XIII]]'s encyclical ''[[Quamquam pluries]]''.

Noted Josephologist Father Tarcisio Giuseppe Stramare of the Congregation of Oblates of Saint Joseph, was a main collaborator in the preparation of ''Redemptoris Custos''. This exhortation is part of the "redemption documents" issued by Pope John Paul II, and refers to the [[RC Mariology|Marian]] encyclical ''[[Redemptoris Mater]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Prasad, Jacob. ''Foundations of the Christian way of life'', 2001, {{ISBN|88-7653-146-7}} page 404&lt;/ref&gt; It discusses the importance of Saint Joseph in the Holy Family, and presents the pope's view of Saint Joseph's role in the plan of redemption. John Paul II positions Saint Joseph as breaking the old vice of paternal familial domination, and suggests him as the model of a loving father.&lt;ref&gt;Saward, John. ''Cradle of redeeming love: the theology of the Christmas mystery'', 2002 {{ISBN|0-89870-886-9}} page 230&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ouellet, Marc. ''Divine likeness: toward a Trinitarian anthropology of the family'', {{ISBN|0-8028-2833-7}} p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

The exhortation has six main parts:
*I. The Gospel Portrait
*II The guardian of the mystery of God
*III. A just man, a husband
*IV. Work as an expression of love
*V. The primacy of the interior life
*VI. Patron of the Church in our day

In this document, John Paul II reemphasized key elements of ''[[Quamquam Pluries]]'' regarding the position of St. Joseph in the Church and his connection to Mary, which he had already acknowledged in his encyclical ''Redemptoris Mater''. He wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Together with Mary, Joseph is the first guardian of this divine mystery. Together with Mary, and in relation to Mary, he shares in this final phase of God's self-revelation in Christ and he does so from the very beginning."&lt;ref&gt;[http://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/apost_exhortations/documents/hf_jp-ii_exh_15081989_redemptoris-custos.html Pope John Paul II, ''Redemptoris custos'', §5, August 15, 1989, Libreria Editrice Vaticana]&lt;/ref&gt; "The Gospels clearly describe the fatherly responsibility of Joseph toward Jesus. For salvation-which comes through the humanity of Jesus-is realized in actions which are an everyday part of family life... All of the so-called "private" or "hidden" life of Jesus is entrusted to Joseph's guardianship. "&lt;ref&gt;''Redemptoris custos'', §8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Pope John Paul II pointed out that as legal guardian of the child Jesus, Joseph fulfilled all the obligations that entailed: in having his son circumcised according to the law, in conferring a name upon him, and in presenting him in the Temple at the proscribed time. 
{{Josephology}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;The growth of Jesus "in wisdom and in stature, and in favor with God and man" (Lk 2:52) took place within the Holy Family under the eyes of Joseph, who had the important task of "raising" Jesus, that is, feeding, clothing and educating him in the Law and in a trade, in keeping with the duties of a father. ...For his part, Jesus "was obedient to them" (Lk 2:51), respectfully returning the affection of his 'parents'. In this way he wished to sanctify the obligations of the family and of work, which he performed at the side of Joseph.&lt;ref&gt;''Redemptoris custos'', §16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

The Church venerates the [[Holy Family]], and proposes it as the model of all families. "In this family, Joseph is the father: his fatherhood is not one that derives from begetting offspring; but neither is it an "apparent" or merely "substitute" fatherhood. Rather, it is one that fully shares in authentic human fatherhood and the mission of a father in the family.&lt;ref&gt;''Redemptoris custos'', §21&lt;/ref&gt; 

"What is crucially important here is the sanctification of daily life, a sanctification which each person must acquire according to his or her own state, and one which can be promoted according to a model accessible to all people." John Paul II then quoted his predecessor, [[Pope Paul VI]]. "St. Joseph is the model of those humble ones that Christianity raises up to great destinies;...he is the proof that in order to be a good and genuine follower of Christ, there is no need of great things-it is enough to have the common, simple and human virtues, but they need to be true and authentic."&lt;ref&gt;''Redemptoris custos'', §24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Recalling ''Quamquam pluries'', Pope John Paul II again stressed that the Church has implored the protection of Saint Joseph on the basis of "that sacred bond of charity which united him to the Immaculate Virgin Mother of God," and that the Church has commended to Joseph all of her cares, including those dangers which threaten the human family. "Besides trusting in Joseph's sure protection, the Church also trusts in his noble example, which transcends all individual states of life and serves as a model for the entire Christian community, whatever the condition and duties of each of its members may be."&lt;ref&gt;''Redemptoris custos'', §30&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph is the model of obedience, the man known for having faithfully carried out God's commands. 

In 1999, the [[Oblates of St. Joseph]] named their new Shrine ''Saint Joseph the Guardian of the Redeemer'' after this apostolic exhortation.

'''Seppo Albert Kivinen''' (born October 19, 1933 in [[Ikaalinen]]) is a Finnish author and doctor of philosophy and docent emeritus of [[University of Helsinki]],&lt;ref&gt;Kuka kukin on 2001, Otava 2000&lt;/ref&gt; known for his occult interests and study of monsters. He is a onetime winner of the [[Atorox Award]] for best Finnish short story, for his Lovecraftian pastiche ''Keskiyön Mato Ikaalisissa''. Kivinen is a well known fixture in Finnish academia and a proponent of the study of the history of the occult with a sceptical bent.

==Personal history==

Kivinen did his dissertation 1977 in the University of Helsinki in theoretical philosophy. He worked as the chairman of the Finland–Mongolia society in the early 1970s and as a member of the board of trustees of the Finnish Parapsychological society 1972–1974 and the Transscendentaaliradieastrian society during 1974–1987. He also served as the chairman of Skepsis society (the Finnish skeptics society).

Besides his writings based on the mythos created by [[H. P. Lovecraft]], he has also recorded politico-philosophic songs even with the co-operation of such notable Finnish artists as [[M. A. Numminen]].

==Philosophy==

Kivinen has in his study of [[ontology]] researched the problem of universality, and has set himself on a stance of realism, and a notion of "ontic communism", which he puts into words in the form of "There are many individuals in the world. These individuals have diverse similar (and distinguishing) characteristics." Also the mind-body problem has interested him. Besides [[Aristotle]], his influences have been the [[Cambridge]] philosophers [[Bertrand Russell]], [[G. E. Moore]] and [[C. D. Broad]]. Of which the last one being his avowed favorite.

[[image:To san Hszuan csien780.2-865.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of [[Deshan Xuanjian]], whose dialogue with an old woman is the subject of much of the essay]]
'''''Shin fukatoku''''' ({{CJKV|j=心不可得}}), also known in English translation as '''''The Mind Cannot Be Grasped''''', is a book of the [[Shōbōgenzō]] by the 13th century [[Sōtō]] [[Zen]] monk [[Eihei Dōgen]]. It was presented to his students in 1241 during the summer [[ango]] at his first monastery, [[Kōshōhōrin-ji]], in [[Kyoto]].&lt;ref name=Gudo&gt;{{Citation| last1 =Nishijima|first1=Gudo|last2=Cross|first2=Chodo|authorlink1=Gudo Nishijima|year = 1994| title = Master Dogen's Shōbōgenzō| volume=1|pages=289, 293|publisher = Dogen Sangha| isbn=1-4196-3820-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The book appears eighth in the 75 fascicle version of the [[Shōbōgenzō]], and it is ordered eighteenth in the later chronological 95 fascicle "''Honzan'' edition". It was also included as the third book of the 28 fascicle "''Eiheiji'' manuscript" Shōbōgenzō, and a variant of it was fourth in that version as well.&lt;ref name=textual&gt;{{citation|last=Heine|first=Steven|title=Dōgen: Textual and Historical Studies|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2012|pages=27, 39|isbn=978-0-19-975447-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title is an exceprt from the line from the [[Diamond Sutra]] "Past mind cannot be grasped, present mind cannot be grasped, and future mind cannot be grasped". [[Gudō Wafu Nishijima|Gudō Nishijima]], a modern Zen priest, contrasts the subject of this book with the line of [[René Descartes]] "I think, therefore I am", which suggests the intellect can grasp the mind. Nishijima states that Buddhism is instead only a "philosophy of the here and now" and that Dōgen is telling us the opposite of Descartes: the mind fundamentally lacks substance, cannot exist independently of the outside world, and therefore cannot be grasped. In order to illustrate this point, Dōgen examines a [[kōan]] story about [[Deshan Xuanjian]], a Buddhist scholar of the Diamond Sutra, who attempts to purchase rice cakes from an old woman to "refresh his mind". The woman asks him what mind he intends to refresh if the mind cannot be grasped, leaving him speechless. Dōgen provides suggestions for how Deshan should have responded, and also for what the woman should have said after Deshan failed to say anything.&lt;ref name=Gudo/&gt;

His philosophical standpoint was one of [[Academic skepticism]]: he did not agree with [[dogma]]tism, but didn't resort to [[Pyrrhonism]], either.

==Life==

He was  born in [[Dijon]], the son of a [[merchant]], and appears to have taken holy orders at a very early age. For some years he held the position of honorary canon at Dijon, but he resigned in order to take up his residence in [[Paris]]. He graduated at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], having studied [[theology]], and spent the remainder of his life in literary work in Paris, where he died.

==Works==
[[File:Simon Foucher – Traité des hygrometres ou machines pour mesurer la, 1686 - BEIC 1503071.jpg|thumb|''Traité des hygrometres'' (1686)]]

In his day Foucher enjoyed considerable reputation as a keen opponent of [[Nicolas Malebranche|Malebranche]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]]. He revived the old arguments of the [[Academy]], and advanced them with much ingenuity against Malebranche's doctrine. Otherwise his skepticism is subordinate to orthodox belief, the fundamental dogmas of the church seeming to him intuitively evident. His object was to reconcile his religious with his philosophical creed, and to remain a Christian without ceasing to be an academician.

In his 1673 publication, ''Dissertation on the Search for Truth'', he brought to light people's psychological predilection for certainties. He wrote about the art of doubting—about positioning oneself between doubting and believing. He wrote, "''One needs to exit doubt in order to produce science—but few people heed the importance of not exiting from it prematurely....It is a fact that one usually exits doubt without realizing it.''" He wrote further, "''We are dogma-prone from our mother's wombs.''"&lt;ref name=The_Black_Swan/&gt;

== Principal works ==

Foucher had the annoying habit of re-using the same titles for his works, making it necessary to cite the whole subtitle in order to specify which work is being referred to.

* 1673: ''Dissertations sur la recherche de la vérité, ou sur la logique des academiciens'' (''Dissertations on the search for truth, or on the logic of the Academics'') (Foucher did not publish this work but distributed it privately. It is now lost and known only from Foucher's own references to it in later writings.)
* 1675:''Critique de la Recherche de la vérité, où l'on examine en méme temps une partie des principes de Mr Descartes'' (''Critique of the "Search for truth", in which some of the principles of Mr Descartes are examined at the same time'') (A critique of Malebranche's work of that title; Foucher believed that because Malebranche chose the same title as Foucher, he was deliberately replying to Foucher's work. Note that only the first volume of Malebranche's book had appeared at this stage, which Foucher took to be the complete work.)
* 1679: ''Nouvelle dissertation sur la recherche de la vérité, contenant la réponse à la Critique de la Critique de la Recherche de la Verité'' (''New dissertation on the search for the truth, containing the response to the Critique of the Critique of the Search for truth'') (Robert Desgabets had replied to Foucher's attack on Malebranche; this was Foucher's reply. Written in 1676, but published in 1679, as publishers were reluctant to take it on.)
* 1687: ''Dissertation sur la recherche de la vérité, contenant l'apologie des academiciens, où l'on fait voir que leur maniere de philosopher est la plus utile pour la religion, et la plus conforme au bon sense, pour servir de réponse à la Critique de la Critique, etc.; avec plusiers remarques sur les erreurs des sens et sur l'origine de la philosophie de Monsieur Descartes'' (''Dissertation on the search for truth, containing the defence of the Academics, in which is shown that their manner of philosophising is the most useful for religion and the closest to good sense, to serve as a response to the Critique of the Critique, etc.; with several remarks on the errors of the senses and on the origins of Mr Descartes' philosophy'')
* 1688: ''Lettre sur la morale de Confucius, philosophe de la Chine'' (''Letter on the morals of Confucius, Chinese philosopher'') (Foucher argues that, despite not being Christian, Chinese morality is admirable.)
* 1693: ''Dissertations sur la recherche de la vérité, contenant l'histoire et les principes de la philosophie des académiciens. Avec plusieurs réflexions sur les sentimens de M. Descartes'' (''Dissertations on the search for truth, containing the history and principles of the philosophy of the Academics; with several reflections on the views of Mr Descartes'') (Intended as a summary of Foucher's views in his previous writings, with some new material.)
* {{Cite book|publisher= chez Estienne Michallet, ruà« saint Jacques à l'image saint Paul prés la fontaine saint Severin|title= Traité des hygrometres ou machines pour mesurer la secheresse et l'humidité de l'air.

In addition to these works, Foucher published two long poems, and a few shorter philosophical pieces. He also conducted an important correspondence with Leibniz and wrote, but never published, a play.

'''Spirit possession''' is a term for the belief that [[animism|animas]], [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]], [[demon]]s, [[Deity|gods]], or [[spirit]]s can take control of a [[human body]]. The concept of spirit possession exists in many religions, including [[Christianity]],&lt;ref name=new1&gt;Mark 5:9, Luke 8:30&lt;/ref&gt; [[Buddhism]], [[Haitian Vodou]], [[Wicca]], [[Hinduism]], [[Islam]] and [[Southeast Asia]]n and [[Africa]]n traditions. In a 1969 study funded by the National Institute of Mental Health, spirit possession beliefs were found to exist in 74 percent of a sample of 488 societies in all parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bourguignon|first1=Erika|last2=Ucko|first2=Lenora|title=Cross-Cultural Study of Dissociational States|date=1969|publisher=The Ohio State University Research Foundation with National Institute of Mental Health grant}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the cultural context in which it is found, possession may be considered voluntary or involuntary and may be considered to have beneficial or detrimental effects on the host. Within possession cults, the belief that one is possessed by spirits is more common among women than men.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;1981 Kehoe, Alice B., and Giletti, Dody H., Women's Preponderance in Possession Cults: The Calcium Deficiency Hypothesis Extended, American Anthropologist, New Series,. 83(3): 549–561&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Lewis, I.M. 1966 Spirit Possession and Deprivation Cults. Man, New Series: 1 (3): 307–329.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ancient Egyptians ==
According to [[Augustin Calmet]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''The Egyptians believed that when the spirit of an animal is separated from its body by violence, it does not go to a distance, but remains near it. It is the same with the soul of a man who has died a violent death; it remains near the body—nothing can make it go away; it is retained there by sympathy; several have been seen sighing near their bodies which were interred. The magicians abuse their power over such in their incantations; they force them to obey, when they are masters of the dead body, or even part of it. Frequent experience taught them that there is a secret virtue in the body, which draws towards it the spirit which has once inhabited it; wherefore those who wish to receive or become the receptacles of the spirits of such animals as know the future, eat the principle parts of them, as the hearts of crows, moles, or hawks. The spirit of these creatures enters into them at the moment they eat this food, and makes them give out oracles like divinities.''.&lt;ref&gt;Calmet (1751), pp. 237–238&lt;/ref&gt; ''Porphyry, when consulted by Anebo, an Egyptian priest, if those who foretell the future and perform prodigies have more powerful souls, or whether they receive power from some strange spirit, replies that, according to appearance, all these things are done by means of certain evil spirits that are naturally knavish, and take all sorts of shapes, and do everything that one sees happen, whether good or evil; but that in the end they never lead men to what is truly good.''&lt;ref&gt;Calmet (1751),  p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; - [[Treatise on the Apparitions of Spirits and on Vampires or Revenants]] &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==African traditions==

===Zār cult===
In [[Sudan]] and certain East African cultures the [[Zār]] cult conducts ethnomedical healing ceremonies involving possession, typically of Muslim women by a Zār spirit.&lt;ref&gt;[[Janice Boddy]], "Wombs and Alien Spirits: Women, Men and the Zar Cult in Northern Sudan (New Directions in Anthropological Writing) University of Wisconsin Press (30 November 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; This is also found in [[North Africa]].

=====Gurage people=====
Among the [[Gurage people]] of Ethiopia, spirit possession is a common belief. Wiliam A. Shack postulated that it is caused by Gurage cultural attitudes about food and hunger, while they have a plentiful food supply, cultural pressures that force the Gurage to either share it to meet social obligations, or hoard it and eat it secretly cause feelings of anxiety. Distinctions are drawn between spirits that strictly possess men, spirits that possess women, and spirits that possess victims of either sex. A ritual illness that only affects men is believed to be caused by a spirit called ''awre''. This affliction presents itself by loss of appetite, nausea, and attacks from severe stomach pains. If it persists the victim may enter a trancelike stupor, in which he sometimes regains consciousness long enough to take food and water. Breathing is often labored. Seizures and trembling overcome the patient, and in extreme cases, partial paralysis of the extremities.&lt;ref name="Hunger, Anxiety 1971 pp. 30-43"&gt;Hunger, Anxiety, and Ritual: Deprivation and Spirit Possession Among the Gurage of Ethiopia Author(s): William A. Shack Source: Man, New Series, Vol. 6, No. 1 (Mar., 1971), pp. 30–43&lt;/ref&gt;

If the victim does not recover naturally, a traditional healer, or ''sagwara'', is summoned. Once the sagwara has determined the spirit's name through the use of divination, he prescribes a routine formula to exorcise the spirit. This is not a permanent cure, however, it is believed to allow the victim to form a relationship with the spirit. Nevertheless, the victim is subject to chronic repossession, which is treated by repeating the formula. This formula involves the preparation and consumption of a dish of [[ensete]], butter, and red pepper. During this ritual, the victim's head is covered with a drape, and he eats the ensete ravenously while other ritual participants participate by chanting. The ritual ends when the possessing spirit announces that it is satisfied. Shack notes that the victims are overwhelmingly poor men, and that women are not as food-deprived as men are due to ritual activities that involve food redistribution and consumption. Shack postulates that the ''awre'' serves to bring the possessed man to the center of social attention, and to relieve his anxieties over his inability to gain prestige from redistributing food, which is the primary way in which Gurage men gain status in their society.&lt;ref name="Hunger, Anxiety 1971 pp. 30-43"/&gt;

=====Sidama people=====
The belief in spirit possession is part of their native culture of the [[Sidama people]] of southwest [[Ethiopia]]. Anthropologists Irene and John Hamer postulated that it is a form of compensation for being deprived within Sidama society, although they do not draw from I.M. Lewis (see Cultural anthropology section under Scientific views). The majority of the possessed are women whose spirits demand luxury goods to alleviate their condition, but men can be possessed as well. Possessed individuals of both sexes can become healers due to their condition. Hamer and Hamer suggest that this is a form of compensation among deprived men in the deeply competitive society of the Sidama, for if a man cannot gain prestige as an orator, warrior, or farmer, he may still gain prestige as a spirit healer. Women are sometimes accused of faking possession, but men never are.&lt;ref&gt;Hamer, John and Irene Hamer 1966  Spirit Possession and Its Socio-Psychological Implications among the Sidamo Of Southwest Ethiopia.  Ethnology 5 (4): 392–408.&lt;/ref&gt;

===East Africa===

====Kenya====

=====Digo people=====
The [[Digo people]] of [[Kenya]] refer to the spirits that supposedly possess them as  ''shaitani''. These ''shaitani'' typically demand luxury items to make the patient well again. Despite the fact that men sometimes accuse women of faking the possessions in order to get luxury items, attention, and sympathy, they do generally regard spirit possession as a genuine condition, and view victims of it as being ill through no fault of their own. However, men sometimes suspect women of actively colluding with spirits in order to be possessed.&lt;ref&gt;Gomm, Roger 1975 Bargaining from Weakness: Spirit Possession on the South Kenya Coast Man, New Series: 10 (4):530–543&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Giriama people=====
The [[Giriama people]] of coastal Kenya believe in spirit possession.&lt;ref&gt;Reluctant Muslims: Embodied Hegemony and Moral Resistance in a Giriama Spirit Possession Janet McIntosh The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, Vol. 10, No. 1 (Mar., 2004), pp. 91–112&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mayotte====
In [[Mayotte]], approximately 25 percent of the adult population, and five times as many women as men, enter trance states in which they are supposedly possessed by certain identifiable spirits who maintain stable and coherent identities from one possession to the next.&lt;ref&gt;Lambek, Michael 1988 Spirit Possession/Spirit Succession: Aspects of Social Continuity among Malagasy Speakers in Mayotte. American Ethnologist: 15 (4): 710–731&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mozambique====
In [[Mozambique]], a new belief in spirit possession appeared after the [[Mozambican Civil War]]. These spirits, called ''gamba'', are said to be identified as dead soldiers, and allegedly overwhelmingly possess women. Prior to the war, spirit possession was limited to certain families and was less common.&lt;ref&gt;Igreja, Victor, Beatrice Dias-Lambranca, and Annemiek Richters 2008. Gamba spirits, gender relations, and healing in post-civil war Gorongosa, Mozambique. Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute 14: 353-371.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Uganda====
In [[Uganda]], a woman named [[Alice Auma]] was reportedly possessed by the spirit of a male Italian soldier named Lakwena, meaning messenger. She had ultimately led a failed insurrection against governmental forces.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Tim 1991 Understanding Alice: Uganda's Holy Spirit Movement in Context.  Africa: Journal of the International African Institute. 61 (3): 370–399&lt;/ref&gt;

===Southern Africa===

====South Africa====
A belief in spirit possession appears among the [[Xesibe]], a [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] speaking people from [[Transkei]], [[South Africa]]. The majority of the supposedly possessed are married women. The condition of spirit possession among them is called ''inwatso''. Those who develop the condition of ''inwatso'' are regarded as having a special calling to divine the future. They are first treated with sympathy, and then with respect as they allegedly develop their abilities to foretell the future.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connell, M.C. 1982 Spirit Possession and Role Stress among the Xesibe of Eastern Transkei  Ethnology, 21 (1):  21–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tanzania====
The [[Sukuma people]] of [[Tanzania]] believe in spirit possession.&lt;ref&gt;Hysteria in Sukuma Medical PracticeR. E. S. Tanner Africa: Journal of the International African Institute, Vol. 25, No. 3 (July 1955), pp. 274–279&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Zanzibar=====
A now extinct spirit possession cult existed among the [[Hadimu]] women of [[Zanzibar]], revering a spirit called ''kitimiri''. This cult described in an 1869 account by a French missionary. The cult faded by the 1920s and was virtually unknown by the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Alpers, Edward A. 1984 "Ordinary Household Chores": Ritual and Power in a 19th-Century Swahili Women's Spirit Possession Cult The International Journal of African Historical Studies, Vol. 17, No. 4 (1984), pp. 677–702&lt;/ref&gt;

===West Africa===
See [[Hausa animism]]

==African diasporic traditions==

===Haitian Vodou===
In [[Haitian Vodou]] and [[Afro-American religion|related African diaspora traditions]], one way that those who participate or practice can have a spiritual experience is by being possessed by the ''[[Loa]]'' (or ''lwa''). When the ''loa'' descends upon a practitioner, the practitioner's body is being used by the spirit, according to the tradition. Some spirits are believed to be able to give prophecies of upcoming events or situations pertaining to the possessed one, also called ''Chwal'' or the "Horse of the Spirit." Practitioners describe this as a beautiful but very tiring experience. Most people who are possessed by the spirit describe the onset as a feeling of blackness or energy flowing through their body as if they were being electrocuted. According to Vodou believers, when this occurs, it is a sign that a possession is about to take place.

According to tradition, the practitioner has no recollection of the possession and in fact when the possessing spirit leaves the body, the possessed one is tired and wonders what has happened during the possession. It is also believed that there are those who feign possessions because they want attention or a feeling of importance, because those who are possessed carry a high importance in ceremony. Often, a ''chwal'' will undergo some form of trial or testing to make sure that the possession is allegedly genuine. As an example, someone possessed by one of the [[Guédé]] spirits may be offered ''piment'', a [[liqueur]] made by steeping twenty-one [[chili pepper]]s in ''kleren'', a potent [[alcoholic beverage]]. If the chwal consumes the piment without showing any evidence of pain or discomfort, the possession is regarded as genuine.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

===Umbanda===
The concept of spirit possession is also found in [[Umbanda]], an Afro-Brazilian folk religion. According to tradition, one such possessing spirit is [[Pomba Gira]], who possesses both women and effeminate males.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, Kelly E. 2008. Wicked Women and Femmes Fatales: Gender, Power, and Pomba Gira in Brazil. History of Religions. 48 (1): 1–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asian traditions==

===Buddhism===
According to the Indian medical literature and [[Vajrayana|Tantric Buddhist]] scriptures, most of the "seizers," or those that threaten the lives of young children, appear in animal form: cow, lion, fox, monkey, horse, dog, pig, cat, crow, pheasant, owl, and snake. But apart from these "nightmare shapes," it is believed the impersonation or incarnation of animals could in some circumstances also be highly beneficial, according to Michel Strickmann.&lt;ref name="Strickmann 2002, p. 251"&gt;Michel Strickmann (2002), ''Chinese Magical Medicine'', edited by Bernard Faure, Stanford University Press, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ch'i Chung-fu, a Chinese gynecologist writing early in the thirteenth century, wrote that in addition to five sorts of falling frenzy classified according to their causative factors, there were also four types of other frenzies distinguished by the sounds and movements given off by the victim during his seizure: cow, horse, pig, and dog frenzies.&lt;ref name="Strickmann 2002, p. 251"/&gt;

===East Asian religions===
{{See also|East Asian religions}}
Certain sects of [[Taoism]], [[Korean shamanism]], [[Shinto]], some Japanese new religious movements, and other East Asian religions feature the idea of spirit possession. Some sects feature shamans who supposedly become possessed, or [[mediumship|mediums]] who allegedly channel beings' supernatural power, or enchanters who it is said imbue or foster spirits within objects, like samurai swords.&lt;ref&gt;Ed. Oxtoby &amp; Amore, "World Religions: Eastern Traditions," 3rd Edition. Oxford University Press, 2010. pp. 9, 256–319.&lt;/ref&gt; The Hong Kong film ''Super Normal II'' (''大迷信'', 1993) shows the famous story of a woman in [[Taiwan]] who possesses a dead body to live her predeterminated remaining life.&lt;ref&gt;[[:zh:朱秀華借屍還魂]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tsasf.myweb.hinet.net/asf_5a.htm 朱秀華借屍回陽記]&lt;/ref&gt; She is still working in the Zhen Tian Temple in [[Yunlin County]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ztg.com.tw 豐原鎮天宮全球資訊網]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rajasthan====
The concept of spirit possession exists in the culture of modern [[Rajasthan]]. Some of the spirits allegedly possessing Rajasthanis are seen as good and beneficial, while others are seen as malevolent. The good spirits are said to include murdered royalty, the underworld god [[Bhaironji]], and [[Muslim]] saints &amp; fakirs. Bad spirits are believed to include perpetual debtors who die in debt, stillborn infants, deceased widows, and foreign tourists. The supposedly possessed individual is referred to as a ''ghorala'', or "mount". Possession, even if by a benign spirit, is regarded as undesirable, as it is seen to entail loss of self-control, and violent emotional outbursts.&lt;ref&gt;Imitation Is Far More than the Sincerest of Flattery: The Mimetic Power of Spirit Possession in Rajasthan, India Jeffrey G.

====Tamil====
[[Tamil people|Tamil]] women in India are said to experience possession by ''peye'' spirits. According to tradition, these spirits overwhelmingly possess new brides, are usually identified as the ghosts of young men who died while romantically or sexually frustrated, and are ritually exorcised.&lt;ref&gt;Nabokov, Isabelle 1997 Expel the Lover, Recover the Wife: Symbolic Analysis of a South Indian Possession. The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute 3 (2): 297–316.’&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indonesian traditions===

====Bali====
The animist traditions of the island of [[Bali]] ([[Indonesia]]) include a practice called ''[[sanghyang]]'', induction of voluntary possession trance states for specific purposes. Roughly similar to voluntary possession in Vaudon (Voodoo), ''sanghyang'' is considered a sacred state in which [[hyang]]s (deities) or helpful spirits temporarily inhabit the bodies of participants. The purpose of sanghyang is believed to be to cleanse people and places of evil influences and restore spiritual balance. Thus, it is often referred to as an exorcism ceremony.

====Sulawesi====
The women of the [[Bonerate people]] of [[Sulawesi]], Indonesia practice a possession-trance ritual in which they smother glowing embers with their bare feet at the climax. The fact that they are not burned in the process is considered proof of the authenticity of the possession.&lt;ref&gt;"Crazy Women are Performing in Sombali": A Possession-Trance Ritual on Bonerate, Indonesia Author(s): Harald Beyer BrochSource: Ethos, Vol. 13, No. 3 (Autumn, 1985), pp. 262–282&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese traditions===

===Malaysian traditions===
Female workers in [[Malaysia]]n factories have allegedly become possessed by spirits, and factory owners generally regard it as [[mass hysteria]] and an intrusion of irrational and archaic beliefs into a modern setting.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Ong, Aihwa 1988 The Production of Possession: Spirits and the Multinational Corporation in Malaysia American Ethnologist 15 (1): 28–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The anthropologist Aihwa Ong noted that spirit possession beliefs in Malaysia were typically held by older, married women, whereas the female factory workers are typically young and unmarried. She connects this to the rapid industrialization and modernization of Malaysia. Ong argued that spirit possession is a traditional way of rebelling against authority without punishment, and suggests that it is a means of protesting the untenable working conditions and sexual harassment that the women were compelled to endure.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

===Sri Lankan traditions===
The [[Coast Veddas]], a social group within the minority group of [[Sri Lankan Tamil people]] in [[Eastern Province, Sri Lanka]], enter trances during religious festivals in which they are regarded as being possessed by a spirit. Although they speak a dialect of [[Sri Lankan Tamil dialect|Tamil]], during trances they will sometimes use a mixed language that contains words from the [[Vedda language]].&lt;ref name=JonDart83&gt;Jon Dart (Samarasinghe, S. W. R. de A[''edit'']), p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oceanic traditions==

===Melanesia===
The [[Urapmin people]] of the [[New Guinea Highlands]] practice a form of group possession known as the "spirit disco" ([[Tok Pisin]]: ''spirit disko'').&lt;ref name="r1998_310-311"&gt;{{cite journal

===Micronesia===
The concept of spirit possession appears in [[Chuuk State]], one of the four states of [[Federated States of Micronesia]]. Although Chuuk is an overwhelmingly Christian society, traditional beliefs in spirit possession by the dead still exist, usually held by women, and "events" are usually brought on by family conflicts. The supposed spirits, speaking through the women, typically admonish family members to treat each other better.&lt;ref&gt;Hezel, Francis X. 1993 Spirit Possession in Chuuk: Socio-Cultural Interpretation. Micronesian Counselor 11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity==
{{Main article|Baptism with the Holy Spirit|Holy laughter|Demonic possession}}
[[Roman Catholic doctrine]] states that [[angel]]s are non-corporeal, spiritual beings&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the [[Catholic Church]], paragraph 328.&lt;/ref&gt; with intelligence and [[Will (philosophy)|will]].&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church, paragraph 330.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fallen angel]]s, or [[demon]]s, are able to "[[demonic possession|demonically possess]]" individuals without the victim's knowledge or consent, leaving them morally blameless.&lt;ref&gt;p. 33, An Exorcist Tells his Story by Gabriele Amorth translated by Nicoletta V. MacKenzie; Ignatius Press, San Francisco, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam==
Spirit possession appears in [[Islamic theology]] and tradition. [[Jinn#Islam|Jinn]] are said to be creatures with [[Predestination in Islam|free will]], made from smokeless fire by [[God in Islam|God]] (Arabic: Allah) with the ability to possess humans. Since they are, unlike the [[shaitan|demons]] (''shayāṭīn''), are morally ambivalent, spirit possession is not necessarily harmful. According to Morrocan belief, a jinn-possessed may acquire supernatural powers. Other jinn may possess humans with no harmfull intents, but because they fell in love with an individual. In this case, it is tried to appease the jinn. At an intented possession, the covenant with the jinn must be renewed.&lt;ref&gt;Muḥammad Maʻrūf ''Jinn Eviction as a Discourse of Power: A Multidisciplinary Approach to Modern Morrocan Magical Beliefs and Practices'' BRILL 2007 {{ISBN|9789004160996}} p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; According to traditional beliefs, the possessed person speaks differently and acts in a strange and sometimes violent manner. One verse in the [[Quran]] describes that on judgment day, the behavior of those who earn high interest on loans "as if they were possessed or controlled by a satan". Exorcism and removal of jinn from possessed people is done by a religious person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Quran-usc|55|14|end=15|style=nosup}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(  سورة البقرة, Al-Baqara, Chapter #2, Verse #275)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(  سورة إبراهيم, Ibrahim, Chapter #14, Verse #11 and Verse #22)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(  سورة الحجر, Al-Hijr, Chapter #15, Verse #42)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(  سورة النحل, An-Nahl, Chapter #16, Verse #99–100)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Search truth|url=http://www.searchtruth.com|accessdate=September 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism==
Although forbidden in the [[Hebrew Bible]], magic was widely practiced in the late [[Second Temple Period]] and well documented in the period following the destruction of the Temple into the 3rd, 4th, and 5th centuries C.E.&lt;ref&gt;Gideon Bohak ''Ancient Jewish magic: a history'' 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clinton Wahlen ''Jesus and the impurity of spirits in the Synoptic Gospels'' 2004 p. 19 "The Jewish magical papyri and incantation bowls may also shed light on our investigation.79 However, the fact that all of these sources are generally dated from the third to fifth centuries and beyond requires us to exercise particular ..."&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Jewish folklore]], a [[dybbuk]] is a disembodied [[spirit]] that wanders restlessly until it inhabits the body of a living person. The [[Baal Shem]] could expel the harmful dybbuk through [[exorcism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| contribution=Dybbuk| contribution-url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/174964/dybbuk| title=Encyclopædia Britannica Online| url=http://www.britannica.com/| accessdate=2009-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Jewish magical papyri]] were inscriptions on [[amulets]], [[ostraca]] and [[incantation bowls]] used in Jewish magical practices against [[shedim]] and other [[unclean spirit]]s.

==Shamanism==
{{Main article|Shamanism}}

==Wicca==
[[Wicca]]ns believe in voluntary possession by the [[Goddess]], connected with the sacred ceremony of [[Drawing Down the Moon (ritual)|Drawing Down the Moon]]. The high priestess solicits the Goddess to possess her and speak through her.&lt;ref&gt;Margo Adler, ''Drawing Down the Moon''. Penguin, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific views==

===Cultural anthropology===
The anthropologist I.M. Lewis noted that women are more likely to be involved in spirit possession cults than men are, and postulated that such cults act as a means of compensation for their exclusion from other spheres within their respective cultures.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

===Physical anthropology===
Anthropologists Alice B. Kehoe and Dody H. Giletti argued that the reason that women are more commonly seen in [[Afro-Eurasia]]n spirit possession cults is because of deficiencies in [[thiamine]], [[tryptophan]]-[[niacin]], [[calcium]], and [[vitamin D]]. They argued that a combination of poverty and food taboos cause this problem, and that it is exacerbated by the strains of pregnancy and lactation. They postulated that the involuntary symptoms of these deficiencies affecting their nervous systems have been institutionalized as spirit possession.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Psychology===
Spirit possession is not recognized as a [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] or medical diagnosis by the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-IV]] or the [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems|ICD-10]]. People alleged to be possessed by spirits sometimes exhibit symptoms similar to those associated with [[mental illness]]es such as [[psychosis]], [[hysteria]], [[mania]], [[Tourette's syndrome]], [[epilepsy]], [[schizophrenia]], or [[dissociative identity disorder]],&lt;ref name="How Exorcism Works"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/exorcism5.htm|title=How Exorcism Works|date=8 September 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholarsbank.uoregon.edu/dspace/handle/1794/1530 J.

==Biography==
Sylvia Wynter was born in [[Cuba]] to actress Lola Maude (Reid) Wynter and tailor Percival Wynter. At the age of two she returned to her home country, Jamaica, with her parents (both born there) and was educated at the St. Andrew High School for Girls. In 1946, she was awarded the Jamaica Centenary Scholarship for Girls, which took her to [[King's College London]], to read for her B.A. in modern languages (Spanish) from 1947 to 1951. She was awarded the M.A. in December 1953 for her thesis, a critical edition of a Spanish [[Comedia (Spanish play)|comedia]], ''Á lo que obliga el honor''.

In 1956, Wynter met the Guyanese novelist [[Jan Carew]], who became her second husband. In 1958, she completed ''Under the Sun'', a full-length stage play, which was bought by the [[Royal Court Theatre]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Putting the Drama in Touch with Contemporary Life|agency=Times Newspapers Limited|publisher=The Times [London]|date=19 Mar 1958|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, Wynter published her only novel, ''The Hills of Hebron''.  

After separating from Carew in the early 1960s, Wynter returned to academia, and in 1963, was appointed assistant lecturer in Hispanic literature at the Mona campus of the [[University of the West Indies]]. She remained there until 1974. During this time the Jamaican government commissioned her to write the play ''1865–A Ballad for a Rebellion,'' about the Morant Bay rebellion, and a biography of Sir [[Alexander Bustamante]], the first prime minister of independent Jamaica.

In 1974, Wynter was invited by the Department of Literature at the [[University of California at San Diego]] to be a professor of Comparative and Spanish Literature and to lead a new program in Third World literature. She left UCSD in 1977 to become chairperson of African and Afro-American Studies, and professor of Spanish in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese at [[Stanford University]]. She is now [[Professor Emeritus|Professor Emerita]] at Stanford University.

In the mid- to late-1960s, Wynter began writing critical essays addressing her interests in Caribbean, Latin American, and [[History of Spain|Spanish history]] and literatures. In 1968 and 1969 she published a two-part essay proposing to transform scholars' very approach to literary criticism, "We Must Learn to Sit Down Together and Talk About a Little Culture: Reflections on West Indian Writing and Criticism." Wynter has since written numerous essays in which she seeks to rethink the fullness of human [[ontologies]], which, she argues, have been curtailed by what she describes as an over-representation of (western bourgeois) Man as if it/he were the only available mode of complete humanness. She suggests how multiple knowledge sources and texts might frame our worldview differently.

In 2010, Sylvia Wynter was awarded the [[Order of Jamaica]] (OJ) for services in the fields of education, history, and culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/Five-get-OJ_7858340 "Five get OJ"], ''Jamaica Observer,'' 6 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://myspot.mona.uwi.edu/cct/sylvia-wynter-awarded-order-jamaica "Sylvia Wynter awarded the Order of Jamaica - Hon Professor Wynter's response to the letter of congratulations on her award sent by Professor Brian Meeks on behalf of the CCT"], Centre for Caribbean Thought, University of the West Indies at Mona, Jamaica.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical work==
Sylvia Wynter’s scholarly work is highly poetic, expository, and complex. Her work attempts to elucidate the development and maintenance of modernity and the modern man. She interweaves science, philosophy, literary theory, and critical race theory to explain how the European man came to be considered the epitome of humanity, “Man 2” or “the figure of man.” In “Unsettling the Coloniality of Being/Power/Truth/Freedom: Towards the Human, After Man, Its Overrepresentation—An Argument,” Wynter explains that the West uses race to attempt to answer the questions of who and what we are—particularly after the enlightenment period that unveils religion as incapable of answering those questions.
