The '''Abraham Path''' is a cultural route connecting the storied places associated with Abraham’s ancient journey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://abrahampath.org/|title=Abraham Path {{!}} a cultural route connecting the storied places associated with Abraham’s ancient journey.|last=|first=|date=|website=abrahampath.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Story, walking and hospitality are the cultural route’s central themes. The path focusses on the diverse communities living in the region that share a common heritage in Abraham/Ibrahim as an ancestor and that may identify his story as an important component of their cultural DNA. The path also demonstrates the power of walking: giving people perspective and remembering their origins; it’s a way to connect with others. The path is also a symbol of hospitality and kindness toward perfect strangers.

== The legend of Abraham ==

Abraham/Ibrahim is believed to have lived in the [[Bronze Age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of Israel|last=Bright|first=John|publisher=|year=1972|isbn=|location=|pages=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; He traveled with family and flocks throughout the [[Fertile Crescent]], the Arabian peninsula, and the Nile Valley. His story has inspired myriad communities including [[Kurdish people|Kurds]], [[Muslim]], [[Jews]], [[Christian]]s, [[Alevi]], [[Bedouin]], [[Fellah]]in, [[Samaritans]], and countless across the world. The Abraham Path Initiative aims to build on this narrative of shared connection with its rich tradition of walking and hospitality to strangers.
[[File:Nabi Musa IMG 1945.JPG|thumb|[[Nabi Musa]]]]

== History ==
The path was started in the first decade of the 21st century by the Abraham Path Initiative, a registered [[501c3]] nonprofit organization based in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], Massachusetts, United States, with a global network of partners. [[William Ury]], negotiator and author of ''[[Getting to YES]]'' helped found the project at Harvard University's [[Program on Negotiation]]. Ury's [[TED (conference)|TED Talk]] speaks about the beginnings of the path and the vision behind the Initiative. Ury says that every culture has an origin-story, and that the origin-story of the Middle East is about how a man and his family walked the Middle East about four thousand years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/william_ury.html|title=William Ury: The walk from "no" to "yes" - TED Talk - TED.com|author=William Ury|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Abraham Path Initiative is endorsed by the United Nations World Tourism Organization, the [[Alliance of Civilizations|United Nations Alliance of Civilizations]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unaoc.org/actions/education/|title=Education|work=United Nations Alliance of Civilizations (UNAOC)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other international partners [https://web.archive.org/web/20131017112123/http://www.abrahampath.org/connect/our-partners/international-partners/]. The initiative is a non-profit, non-religious and non-political organization, whose mission is to support local partners in developing the Abraham Path as:
* a catalyst for socioeconomic development and sustainable tourism.
* a place of meeting and connection between people from the Middle East and people around the world.
* a creative space for stories that highlight the unique culture, heritage and hospitality of the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/travel-in-israel/.premium-1.567502|title=Hiking in Abraham's Footsteps, From Turkey to the Holy Land|work=Haaretz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="951">'''Adriaan van Baarland''' or '''Adrianus Barlandus''' or '''Hadrianus Barlandus''' (1486–1538) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] historian of merit. He was born in the village of [[Baarland]], from which he took his name. He studied at [[Ghent]] and [[Leuven]], at which latter place he was elected professor of eloquence at the [[Collegium Trilingue]] in 1526, after a stay of some years in England. He died in Leuven in 1538, and was succeeded at the Collegium Trilingue by [[Conrad Goclenius]].

Besides some philological works of no great value, Van Baarland wrote a number of historical works, especially about the various provinces in the [[Low Countries]].

The '''Biblioteca William Mulloy''' (Spanish for ''William Mulloy Library''; in [[Rapa Nui language|Rapa Nui]], ''Hare Puka ko Wiliam Mulloy'') is a [[research library]] administered by the [[Father Sebastian Englert Anthropological Museum]] on [[Rapa Nui]] ([[Easter Island]]) in [[Chilean Polynesia]]. Named for the late [[William Mulloy|Dr. William Mulloy]], an [[United States|American]] [[archaeologist]], the library’s collection focuses on [[Rapa Nui]] and [[Cultural studies|Polynesian Studies]], especially the [[prehistory]], [[history]], [[ethnology]], [[archaeology]], [[cultural anthropology]], [[osteology]] and [[geology]] of Easter Island.

==Mission==
[[Image:Mulloy typewriter.jpg|thumb|450px|[[William Mulloy]] typing field notes on board the ''Christian Bjelland'' during the [[Thor Heyerdahl|Norwegian Archaeological Expedition]] to [[Rapa Nui]] in 1955]]
The mission of the Biblioteca William Mulloy is threefold.  Firstly, the Library seeks to support the field work of archaeologists, anthropologists, linguists, ethnologists and other scholars who come to [[Easter Island]] for research purposes. Secondly, the Library promotes the conservation and study of the cultural patrimony of the [[Rapanui|Rapa Nui people]]. Finally, the Library provides broad access within the island community to the best scholarly resources in [[Rapa Nui]] and [[Cultural studies|Polynesian Studies]].

==Mulloy Collection==

The collection of the Biblioteca William Mulloy includes books, journals, articles, archival materials, field notes, maps, photographs and audiovisual materials related to [[Rapa Nui]]. Dr. [[William Mulloy]]’s personal library forms the core of the collection. The [[Father Sebastian Englert Anthropological Museum]], the Chilean Directorate of Libraries, Archives and Museums (DiBAM), the [[Easter Island Foundation]] and the Mulloy family have contributed to the original collection, more than doubling it in a short period of time. The library, located on the campus of the museum in the [[Ahu Tahai|Tahai]] district of the island, has climate-controlled stacks and a seventy-two square-meter lecture hall, which accommodates approximately thirty persons.

==Background==

Shortly before his death in 1978, the renowned archaeologist, [[William Mulloy]], expressed the desire that his personal library, consisting of books, articles, reprints, field notes, maps, photographs and slides, find a permanent home on [[Rapa Nui]] in order to be of service to both specialized researchers coming to the island from abroad and to the general public.&lt;ref name=wmf&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wmf.org/sites/default/files/article/pdfs/Easter%20Island_The%20Heritage%20And%20Its%20Conservation.pdf |title=Easter Island: the Heritage and its Conservation |newspaper=World Monuments Fund |date=August 1994  |author=A. Elena Charola |accessdate=June 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museorapanui.cl/Biblioteca/WilliamMulloy.htm |title=Museo Antropológico P. Sebastián Englert - Isla de Pascua / Rapa Nui |newspaper=Museorapanui.cl |accessdate= June 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his death, his widow, Emily Ross Mulloy, consigned the collection to Mario Correa, [[Cultural Attaché]] of the [[Consulate General]] of [[Chile]] in [[Washington DC]], who with the aid of Marilyn Pugh of [[LanChile]], transferred the library to mainland Chile. At the time, lack of satisfactory facilities on Rapa Nui did not favor the immediate transfer of library or archival materials. Instead, the collection was entrusted to the [[Easter Island Foundation]]. The Foundation maintained the library at the [[Fonck Museum]] in [[Viña del Mar]], hired a [[Rapanui|Rapa Nui]] librarian and placed the collection at the disposal of the public. In addition to its long-term financial support of the library, the [[Easter Island Foundation]] assisted with the relocation of Mulloy Library materials to the island when a suitable space was made ready on Museum premises.

After its transfer from Viña del Mar, the Biblioteca William Mulloy opened on Rapa Nui in 2002 and was dedicated by Dr. Mulloy’s widow, Emily Ross Mulloy, Clara Budnik (Director of the DiBAM), and prominent members of the Rapa Nui community.

'''Botiflers''' ({{IPA-ca|butiˈfle}}) was a name given to [[Philip V of Spain]] supporters during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. They were usually Catalan and Valencian [[aristocracy|aristocrats]] and members of the [[nobility]] who wanted to increase their power from the upcoming regime that would result after [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] victory. In [[Majorca]], the term evolved to "botifarres", which started to be used to refer to all noblemen independently of any national ascription.

'''Botifler''' originally referred to anyone having inflated [[cheek]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pdl.iec.es/entrada/fitxa_DIEC.asp?MOCODI=842&amp;Page=dilc IEC&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, it designated specifically to any Bourbon supporter because the latter were said to have also inflated cheeks. 

Nowadays, the term is used by [[Catalan nationalism|Catalan]] and [[Valencian nationalism|Valencian]] nationalists to refer pejoratively to unionists or whoever acts against Catalonian or Valencian nationalist interests.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4897">'''Dolma Kyab''' (or Zhou Shique, [[Chinese language|Chinese]] : 卓史确 or 卓玛加(音))  (pen-name Lobsang Kelsang Gyatso), born in 1976, is a writer and teacher in his native [[Tibet]]. He was imprisoned at [[Chushur]] (Chinese: “Qushui”) Prison, which is located in a rural area south-west of his native home, [[Lhasa]], Tibet. On March 9, 2005, he was arrested in Lhasa at the middle school where he was employed as a history teacher. On September 16, 2005 he was convicted and sentenced to 10 years in prison by the Lhasa People’s Intermediate Court for the crime of stealing and/or passing on “state secrets.” 
	
Dolma Kyab has received an extensive education having attended his local primary school and then his county middle school. He joined a Teachers Training Center in 1995 and taught at a school in [[Qilian County]] (in [[Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture]]). He later continued his studies at [[Peking University]] where he received a master's degree in 2002. In 2003, he traveled to [[India]] to learn [[English language|English]] and [[Hindi]]. He is fluent in both his Native [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]], as well as [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. As a writer he maintained a commentary manuscript written in Chinese, entitled ''Sao dong de Ximalayshan'' (“'''Himalaya on Stir'''”). It has 57 chapters written on various topics such as: democracy, the sovereignty of Tibet, Tibet under communism, colonialism, and religion and belief. He also began writing another manuscript which focused on his increasing concern for Tibet’s environment and makes mention to sensitive topics like the geographical alterations that China has brought to Tibet as well as the location of various Chinese Military camps in the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] (TAR).

After his arrest on March 9, 2005, he was taken to the TAR Public Security Bureau Detention Center, also known as “Seitru” in Tibetan. He was held and tried for “endangering state security;” (Chinese Criminal Law, Articles 110, 111&lt;ref&gt;[[International Campaign for Tibet]]  {{cite web|url=http://www.savetibet.org/news/newsitem.php?id%3D1013 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071005010029/http://www.savetibet.org/news/newsitem.php?id=1013 |archivedate=2007-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and was convicted and sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. An appeal was made by his family and was rejected on November 30, 2005, upholding the 10-year sentence.

While detained at Seitru he contracted tuberculosis and his subsequent transfer to Chushul Prison was barred until he received medical attention. In March 2006 he was reportedly transferred to Chushul Prison after receiving some medical treatment.

There is no official information about the charges against Dolma Kyab, but in a letter that was reportedly smuggled out of prison Dolma Kyab states that his sentence is linked to his unpublished book. In the letter, he appeals for help from the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]].

A group of well-known Tibetian and Chinese writers have been petitioning for his release. Also, the [[International Campaign for Tibet]] (ICT), the [[International PEN|PEN]] American Center and the Tibetan PEN have been following his case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phayul.com/news/article.aspx?id=19185&amp;article=Tibetan+PEN+calls+for+unconditional+release+of+detained+Tibetan+writers Tibetan PEN calls for unconditional release of detained Tibetan writers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208125550/http://www.phayul.com/news/article.aspx?id=19185&amp;article=Tibetan+PEN+calls+for+unconditional+release+of+detained+Tibetan+writers |date=February 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 October 2015 it was reported that Dolma was released from prison after a decade. After his release from [[Quxu County|Qushui]] jail in [[Lhasa]], Kyab was then taken to his home town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pen.org/press-release/2015/10/08/china-dolma-kyab-released-yet-indicates-chinese-repression-tibetan-free |title=China: Dolma Kyab Released yet Indicates Chinese Repression of Tibetan Free Speech|publisher=[[PEN American Center|PEN AMERICA]]| date=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/world/tibetan-author-jailed-by-china-has-been-released-after-a-decade/story-AJkSRvpMMyKElMpHrqfGbK.html |title=Tibetan author jailed by China released after a decade   |publisher=[[Hindustan Times]]| date=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12063">'''Freculf''' (''Freculphus Lexoviensis''; died 8 October 850 or 852), a [[Franks|Frankish]] ecclesiastic, diplomat and historian, was a pupil of the [[palace school of Aachen]] during the reign of [[Charlemagne]] and [[Bishop of Lisieux]] from about 824 until his death. He is now best remembered for his [[universal chronicle]], the ''Twelve Books of Histories'' (''Historiarum libri XII''), which is a source of information about the conversion of [[Gaul]] and the history of the [[Franks]]. Chronicles such as that of Freculf attempted to show world history from [[Creation narrative in Genesis|Creation]] to the present, but most history writing in the eighth and ninth centuries was considerably more local and specific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Contreni|first=John|title=The Carolingian Renaissance: Education and Literary Culture Volume 2: c.700- c.900|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge UP|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CHOL9780521362924.030}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Freculf’s origins are unknown, but it is known that he became a [[bishop]] in either 823 or 825 until his death on 8 October 850 or 852.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Noble|first=Thomas|title=Middle Ages Series : Images, Iconoclasm, and the Carolingians|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|page=352|url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/ubc/docDetail.action?docID=10576114&amp;p00=freculf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a pupil of [[Louis the Pious]]' chancellor Helisachar and was involved in various issues of the time, including the question of [[iconodule|image veneration]]. He was described as a ‘busy, well-connected man’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Noble|first=Thomas|title=Middle Ages Series : Images, Iconoclasm, and the Carolingians|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|page=352|url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/ubc/docDetail.action?docID=10576114&amp;p00=freculf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some have observed that Freculf was the first medieval writer to see the post-Roman world as something different. He writes that:

{{Quote|The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] had been expelled from Italy and the last great monument to Rome’s state cults had been transformed. It was Roman, however, but Roman ecclesiastical. [[Pope Gregory I|Gregory I]] marked the way and even the Greeks acknowledged that Rome was the head of all churches. It was [[Catholic]]. The future of the West was safely in the hands of Catholic [[Franks]] and [[Lombards]], the [[Visigoths]] had rejected heresy, and the English were on the way to conversion, What is more, the faith itself had been definitively defined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Noble|first=Thomas|title=Middle Ages Series : Images, Iconoclasm, and the Carolingians|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|page=353|url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/ubc/docDetail.action?docID=10576114&amp;p00=freculf}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Envoy to the Pope==
Freculf was sent by Louis to Rome to negotiate with [[Pope Eugene II]] about the veneration of images in 824. This issue was one of the main points of contention in the Church at the time. The [[East Roman Emperor]] at the time, [[Michael II]], was initially tolerant towards those who venerated images (see [[Iconoclasm]]). However, later on in his reign he started persecuting all those who worshiped these images. However, the Franks allowed for veneration, although not adoration, of images. He asked Louis the Pious to persuade Pope Eugene II to ban veneration. Louis complied and one of the envoys he sent was Freculf. However this Frankish embassy failed as Eugene II stated that the second Council of Nicaea had already decided that images can be venerated but should not be adored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Raymond|title=The Lives of the Ninth-century Popes (Liber Pontificalis) 16:37|year=1995|publisher=Liverpool UP|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q7EuWhDYxM4C&amp;pg=PA37&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;dq=image+veneration+freculf&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bVYSFk_-rM&amp;sig=x97Mjd8O0vGQR4Od4aI_bHP6hrA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=44djUo7wOYjTigL7hIHgCA&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=image%20veneration%20freculf&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Twelve Histories==
One of Freculf’s most important works was his ''Twelve Books of Histories'' in two volumes. When he wrote the second part ‘he dedicated it to [[Judith of Bavaria (died 843)|Empress Judith]] as a gift for her son Charles [the Bald]’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Noble|first=Thomas|title=Middle Ages Series : Images, Iconoclasm, and the Carolingians|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|page=352|url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/ubc/docDetail.action?docID=10576114&amp;p00=freculf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He hoped that this book would ‘enable princes to take precautions against disadvantages to themselves and to their subjects’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lozovsky|first=Natalia|title=Roman Geography and Ethnography in the Carolingian Empire 81:359|publisher=Medieval Academy of America|jstor=20463714}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to Empress Judith of Bavaria, Freculf flatters the empress while at the same time claiming that her son Charles was so like [[Charlemagne]] that ‘his grandfather seems not to have died, but rather with the fog of sleep wiped away, to illumine the world anew, indeed his immortal wit, elegance and virtue shine in the grandson together with the name.’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freculf|title=Epistolæ: Letter sent by Freculf, bishop of Lisieux to Empress Judith of Bavaria|first=(Circa 829)|url=http://epistolae.ccnmtl.columbia.edu/letter/987.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Empress Judith encouraged this comparison of Charles to Charlemagne, something that he would be reminded of throughout his reign. However, the influence of Charlemagne was to go way beyond the reign of [[Charles the Bald]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dutton|first=Paul|title=The Politics of Dreaming in the Carolingian Empire|year=1994|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|page=14|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UHQEP3oJDsoC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=freculf&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IINjUv2rBsPMiQKa54DgAg&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=freculf&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Freculf also mentioned in his book that he hoped Charles would be ‘our king of a new age’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McKitterick|first=Rosamund|title=Carolingian Culture: Emulation and Innovation|year=1994|publisher=Cambridge UP|page=213|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ri3xYGoIYWYC&amp;pg=PA213&amp;lpg=PA213&amp;dq=freculf&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=giDR_gy_E8&amp;sig=fMkH7C5MJEfYQSPlgzBR8CPM62U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FIFjUvi8GIrwiwKUjoEQ&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=freculf&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freculf also sent Charles the Bald a copy of the military treatise ''De re militari'' by [[Vegetius]].&lt;ref&gt;[[J. L. Nelson]], ''Charles the Bald'' (Longman, 1992), p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

Freculf’s work, along with [[Ado of Vienne]]’s chronicle, are the only examples of chronicles encompassing world history until the late twelfth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/1789379/Tracing_the_Twelfth-Century_Chronica_of_Richard_of_Cluny_Draft_|last=Saurette|first=Marc|work=Academia.edu|date=2005–2006|title=Tracing the Twelfth-Century Chronica of Richard of Cluny (Draft)|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was only after the 13th century that world chronicles would become more numerous. This work provided an excellent example of how important tradition was for the [[Carolingians]]. Part One of the book narrates the history from the creation of the world to the birth of [[Jesus Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Noble|first=Thomas|title=Middle Ages Series : Images, Iconoclasm, and the Carolingians|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|page=352|url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/ubc/docDetail.action?docID=10576114&amp;p00=freculf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The second part consisted of the history from incarnation of Jesus up until around 600AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Noble|first=Thomas|title=Middle Ages Series : Images, Iconoclasm, and the Carolingians|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|page=352|url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/ubc/docDetail.action?docID=10576114&amp;p00=freculf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His work was centered mainly religious aspects, such as the Visigothic conversion to Catholicism, admiration of [[Pope Gregory I]] as a ‘defender of the faith’, all the martyrs, and all six ecumenical councils up until that point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Noble|first=Thomas|title=Middle Ages Series : Images, Iconoclasm, and the Carolingians|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|page=352|url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/ubc/docDetail.action?docID=10576114&amp;p00=freculf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This text, which is often neglected due to its lack of new factual information of contemporary events...crafts a history meant to address present concerns through the 'mirror' of the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Michael|title=History in the Carolingian renewal: Frechulf of Lisieux (fl. 830), his work and influence|year=1994|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Canada|page=ii|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304181172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Freculf did not use the customary ages-of-the-world or chronological models for organizing his material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Noble|first=Thomas|title=Middle Ages Series : Images, Iconoclasm, and the Carolingians|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|page=353|url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/ubc/docDetail.action?docID=10576114&amp;p00=freculf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead he traced history through the fall and rise of potentates, realms, and cults through pagan, pre-Roman antiquity, and then through Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Noble|first=Thomas|title=Middle Ages Series : Images, Iconoclasm, and the Carolingians|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|page=353|url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/ubc/docDetail.action?docID=10576114&amp;p00=freculf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He only mentioned Rome because it allowed for peace and prosperity, paving the way for the Church to grow.

==Biography==

Katz was born in Vienna, Austria into a [[Judaism|Jewish]] family led by Leo Katz and Bronia Rein that eventually escaped from [[Nazism|Nazi]] persecution.&lt;ref name="inherm" /&gt; After failing to settle in [[France]] and in the [[United States]] due to the [[Communism|Communist]] affiliation of his father and specifically his role as an arms buyer for Republican Spain, his family moved to Mexico, where he arrived at the age of 13 and completed his basic studies.&lt;ref name="inherm" /&gt; He obtained his baccalaureate from the ''[[Liceo Franco Mexicano]]'' in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Haffenstangel, Renata von. ''México, el exilio bien temperado''. [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]], January 1, 1995. {{ISBN|9683644481}}, 9789683644480. p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=PBfA8wE7Yu4C&amp;pg=PA350 350]. "Aquí Friedrich Katz obtuvo su bachillerato en el Liceo Franco-Mexicano en 1945."&lt;/ref&gt; He began his bachelor's degree studies at the [[National School of Anthropology and History]] (ENAH), which he eventually completed at [[Wagner College]], in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="inherm" /&gt; He returned to Austria to complete a doctorate degree at the [[University of Vienna]] in 1954 and moved to [[East Germany]] to attain [[habilitation]] at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]] in 1962.&lt;ref name="uchicago" /&gt; As a university professor, he returned to Mexico to serve as a visiting scholar at the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] (UNAM, 1968–69) and a year later he joined the [[University of Texas at Austin]].&lt;ref name="letraslibres"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.letraslibres.com/index.php?art=12535|title=Friedrich Katz y su patria adoptiva|last=Garciadiego|first=Javier|authorlink=Javier Garciadiego|date=December 2007|publisher=[[Letras Libres]]|language=Spanish|accessdate=27 November 2009|location=Mexico City}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971 he joined to the University of Chicago where, eventually, he was appointed the Morton D. Hull Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus of Latin American History.&lt;ref name="uchicago" /&gt;

On his 80th birthday, two university [[Academic conference|colloquia]] were organized in his honor by the University of Chicago and [[El Colegio de México]].&lt;ref name="letraslibres" /&gt; He died on 16 October 2010 in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name="death_El_Universal"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sierra|first=Sonia|title=Fallece historiador de Pancho Villa|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/716738.html|accessdate=16 October 2010|newspaper=El Universal|date=16 October 2010|location=Mexico City|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harold J. Berman''' (February 13, 1918 – November 13, 2007) was an American [[legal scholar]] who was an expert in [[comparative law|comparative]], [[international law|international]] and [[Soviet law|Soviet]]/[[Russian law]] as well as [[legal history]], [[philosophy of law]] and the intersection of law and [[religion]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.law.harvard.edu/news/bulletin/2008/summer/mem-berman.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;{{cite news|last=Martin|first=Douglas|title=Harold J.

Woodruff Professor]] of Law at Emory. He has been described as "one of the great [[polymath]]s of American legal education."&lt;ref&gt;April L. Bogle, Ginger Pyron, ''When law and religion meet: the point of convergence'', Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2007, p. 12, {{ISBN|0-8028-6294-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8028-6294-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SpIs"&gt;"In Praise of a Legal Polymath: A Special Issue Dedicated to the Memory of Harold J. Berman (1918–2007)," ''Emory Law Journal'', Vol. 57, No. 6 (2008): 1393-1470&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas C. Arthur and John Witte, Jr., "The Foundations of Law: Introduction", 54 Emory Law Journal, 1-375 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==

Born in [[Hartford]], [[Connecticut]], Berman received a bachelor's degree from [[Dartmouth College]] in 1938, and a master's degree and [[Juris Doctor]] from [[Yale University]] in 1942 and 1947, respectively. He served as a [[cryptographer]] in the U.S. Army in the [[European Theatre of Operations]] from 1942 to 1945 and received the [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]]  for his service.

==Career==

In 1948 he joined the faculty of [[Harvard Law School]], where he built a reputation as one of the world's best-known scholars of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] law, and held the Story Professorship of Law and later the Ames Professorship of Law. He was a frequent visitor to [[Russia]] as a guest scholar and lecturer, even during the height of the [[Joseph McCarthy|McCarthy]] era. In 1958, he represented the estate of [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] in Soviet courts, in an unsuccessful attempt to collect copyright royalties from the government of the [[USSR]].

He left HLS in 1985 for the [[Emory University School of Law]], where he was the first person to hold the [[Robert W. Woodruff Professor]]ship of Law — the highest honor Emory can bestow upon a faculty member. Berman was one of the pioneers of the study of law and religion.  He played an integral role in the development of Emory's Law and Religion Program, now the Center for the Study of Law and Religion (CSLR), where he served as Senior Fellow. He is also considered one of the founders' of the [[Journal of Law and Religion]]. "He was my mentor, but far more important than that, he was one of the few legal scholars in the country willing to write about both law and religion," said Professor Frank S. Alexander, CSLR founding director, who persuaded Berman to join the faculty at Emory Law after being one of his students at Harvard in the early 1970s.

After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1989, Berman consulted leading Russian officials on proposed legislation and led seminars for political leaders and academics on the development of legal institutions.

One of the world's most distinguished scholars of Soviet and post-Soviet law, Berman was a Fellow of The [[Carter Center]], with a special focus in U.S.-Russian relations. He visited Russia more than 40 times since 1955 as a guest scholar and lecturer on the topic of American law, and he was the founder and co-director of the American Law Center in Moscow, a joint venture of Emory Law and the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation.   He also took his expertise on Communist and post-Communist law to Eastern Europe and China in recent years, where his writings are well known and widely used.

In recent years, Berman worked to redress global societal inequalities and to establish systems of trust, peace, and justice in developing countries. He co-founded and co-chaired the World Law Institute, an organization that sponsors educational programs in global law. The Institute opened the first Academy of World Law at the [[Central European University]] in Budapest in 2000 and a later comparable program in Moscow.

In 1991, Berman was awarded the degree of [[Doctor of Laws]], ''[[honoris causa]]'', by the [[Catholic University of America]]; in 1995, the degree of [[Doctor of Humane Letters]], honoris causa, by the [[Virginia Theological Seminary]]; and in 2000, the degree of Doctor, honoris causa, by the Russian Academy of Sciences Law University. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1997.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=June 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2005, Berman represented American politician and religious broadcaster [[Pat Robertson|Pat Robertson's]] [[American Center for Law and Justice]] in its [[amicus]] appearance in [[Van Orden v. Perry]], defending the display of a [[Ten Commandments]] memorial on the grounds of the [[Texas]] state capitol.

===Scholarship===
A prolific scholar, Berman wrote 25 books and more than 400 scholarly articles, including ''Law and Revolution: The Formation of the Western Legal Tradition'' and ''The Nature and Functions of Law'', which is in its 6th edition.  The law journal [[Constitutional Commentary]] described ''Law And Revolution'' as "the standard point of departure for work in the field" [of [[Western legal history]]].  On his death, ''[[The New York Times]]'' characterized Berman as "a scholar ... whose forceful scholarship altered thinking about Western law's origins."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2873">'''High-alert nuclear weapon(s)''' commonly refers to a launch-ready [[Ballistic missile| ballistic missile(s)]] armed with a nuclear warhead(s) whose launch can be ordered (through the [[National Command Authority]]) and executed (via a nuclear command and control system) within 15 minutes or less.  This can include any weapon system capable of delivering a nuclear warhead in this time frame.

Virtually all ''high-alert nuclear weapons'' are possessed by the U.S. and Russia. Both nations use automated command and control systems in conjunction with their early warning radar and/or satellites to facilitate the rapid launch of their land-based [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs)]] and some [[Submarine-launched ballistic missile|submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs)]].&lt;ref&gt;Blair, Bruce. "The Logic of Accidental Nuclear War". © The Brookings Institution 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Fear of a "disarming" nuclear first-strike that would destroy their command and control systems and nuclear forces led both nations to develop "launch-on-warning" capability, which requires high-alert nuclear weapons able to launch on a 30-minute (or less) tactical warning, the nominal flight time of ICBMs traveling between the U.S. and Russia.

A definition of "high-alert" requires no specific explosive power of the weapon carried by the missile or weapon system, but in general, most high-alert missiles are armed with strategic nuclear weapons with yields equal to or greater than 100 kilotons.&lt;ref&gt;Starr, Steven. [http://www.wagingpeace.org/articles/2007/11/29_starr_explanation_terminology.php  "An Explanation of Nuclear Weapons Terminology"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308140312/http://www.wagingpeace.org/articles/2007/11/29_starr_explanation_terminology.php |date=2008-03-08 }}. © Nuclear Age Peace Foundation 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Correll, J.

The U.S. and Russia currently have a total of 900 missiles and 2581 strategic nuclear warheads on high-alert, launch-ready status.  The total explosive power of these weapons is about 1185 Mt (megatons, or 1.185 billion tons of TNT equivalent explosive power).&lt;ref&gt;Starr, Steven.

The [[Hyrax Hill]] site was proclaimed a national monument in 1945 and opened to the public in 1965. This was as a result of startling discoveries of relics by Mrs. Selfe and subsequent [[archaeological]] excavations that were carried out by Dr. Mary Leakey in 1938 that revealed substantial findings in different areas of the site and levels of occupations. The late Mrs. Selfe was the owner of the property. The renovation of archaeology exhibit was made possible through the kind sponsorship of Kenya Museum Society and consultation of British Institute in Eastern Africa in collaboration with the [[National Museums of Kenya]].
The hill comprises particular importance due to the fact that it encompasses several phases of occupation; it also has a long history of archaeological investigation, which began in 1937 with Mary Leakey.
[[File:Hyrax3.JPG|thumb|alt=site : ''Neolithic and Iron Age site''|''Neolithic and Iron Age site'' (Hyrax Hill Prehistoric Site and Museum, Nakuru, Kenya)]]

==History==
In 1937 [[Mary Leakey|Dr. Mary Leakey]] excavated Site I, and she discovered evidence of late [[Iron Age]] habitation consisting of a series of rough stone enclosures, and a number of burials. This material according to Sutton belongs to the late Iron Age and is probably around 200 yrs old (Sutton, 1987). During the 1937 excavation, Leakey also discovered a much older occupation layer, dating to the Late Stone Age. Several burials were uncovered; this area is today referred to as the "Neolithic mass grave" on signage at the Museum.

Dr. Mary Leakey&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mary Leakey – Biography|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/mleakey.html|publisher=talkorigins.org|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1938 excavated Site II and erroneously associated the Sirikwa occupation layers with the pre-Iron Age material on Site I and at the Nakuru burial site. &lt;br&gt;
In 1943 the unexcavated portions of the site were recognised as important archaeological resources, and the site was gazetted as a national monument on 26 November 1945.

In 1965 more excavations were carried by Ron Clarke on Site II, and the southern burial Site I. After these excavations, a small museum was established in the farm house which was previously owned by Mrs. A. Selfe.

Dr. Onyango Abunje in 1973–74 excavated the area adjacent to Site I, and he discovered mainly late Iron Age materials, which included two Iron Age pits and burial mounded.

In 1986, Dr. John Sutton re-investigated Site II and during this time, the investigation revealed three Sirikwa houses. Dr. Sutton concluded by proposing that Site II is indeed not related to Site II and is Iron Age dating to middle centuries of the second millennium.

==Governance==
Hyrax Hill is a regional museum under the management of [[National Museums of Kenya]] headed by Dr Mzalendo as its Director General. Hyrax Hill is currently run by 12 members of staff and headed by the curator as the chief accounting officer. Ms. Lilian Amwanda is the Curator Hyrax Hill Museum.

==The Museum Building==
The building was formerly a farm house constructed in about 1900–1910 and ceded to the National Museum of Kenya in 1965 by the owner, the late Mrs. Selfe. The building is rectangular in plan with a veranda along the south façade. It is entered through a 4.8 m wide straight stairway of 5 steps onto a veranda, and then into the main gallery through a protruding porch that forms part of the central space of the building. Inside, this building is divided into three chambers/galleries, the central being the largest. At the back, the building is abutted by two chambers which are used as the Curator's and Education offices respectively.

==Gallery==
The museum has one gallery divided into three chambers; West, East and the central being the largest. The West chamber displays ethnographic materials. The Central chamber displays archaeology of the site; at the center of the gallery there is a model showing the entire site. The East chamber displays natural history objects.

==Hyrax Hill Archaeology==

Hyrax Hill is small but a prominent rocky lava ridge measuring about 500 meters in length and rising to 50 meters above the surrounding plain. The hill owes its name to the numerous hyraxes that used to live in the rock openings.
A number of archaeological features ranging in date from possibly 5000 years ago to only 200 years ago have been found on this hill. The oldest is the area of Neolithic occupation with burials on Site I. There is also recent Iron Age activity on Site I and earlier Iron Age activity on Site II.
Interest in the archaeology of this area began in the 1920s with the discovery by a farmer of ancient burials with stone bowls hidden under rocks on the side of small hill to the north east. Louis Leakey investigated these ancient burials and reported that they belong to an early pastoralist community which he called 'Neolithic '. At the same time he noticed other archaeological features on both sides of hyrax hill, and in 1937 encouraged his wife, Mary, to investigate these.
Hyrax Hill has been central to the development of archaeological research in Kenya for over seventy years. Together with other sites in the region, it has helped our understanding of the transition from a hunting and gathering way of life to greater dependence on food production, especially pastoral activities in these high grasslands.

==Exhibition sites==
Among the 400 objects and works of art exhibited, visitors can admire carved masks, wood statues and other objects made by the Musas between 1970 and 2000. There are other objects collected from the grass-fields, such as traditional musical instruments, hunting gadgets, metal works, bamboo objects and pottery. Temporary exhibitions are also sometimes proposed.

'''Ijebu''' (also known as '''Jebu''' or '''Geebu'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Kingdoms of the Yoruba |publisher= Methuen &amp; Co | author= Robert Smith|year= 1969|page= 75}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] kingdom in pre-colonial [[Nigeria]]. It formed around the fifteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ng/books?id=bNGN2URP_rUC&amp;pg=PA80&amp;dq=Ijebu+Kingdom+century&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAzgoahUKEwjvp4eAhZLHAhXUCNsKHX3xAMI#v=onepage&amp;q=Ijebu%Kingdom%20century&amp;f=false|title=Africans: The History of a Continent|author=John Lliffe|page=80|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to legend, its ruling dynasty was founded by [[Obanta]] of [[Ile-Ife]].

[[File:The National Archives UK - CO 1069-80-51.jpg|left|The King of Ijebu (right)|thumb]]
The kingdom was one of the most developed in the region with a complex and highly organized government. The capital was at [[Ijebu Ode]] where the [[Awujale from the Yoruba words "agbeja ile"]] had his palace. Counterbalancing the Awujale was the [[Ogboni|Osugbo]] (known as the Ogboni in other parts of Nigeria), a council of all free born men that acted as the kingdom's courts. The [[Ogboni|Osugbo]] was divided into six groups based on rank, the highest being the [[iwarefa]], whose head the [[oliwa (nobleman)|Oliwa]] was the second most powerful figure in the nation. Also powerful was the [[olisa (nobleman)|Olisa]] who could be described as the mayor of Ijebu Ode. Like many African societies, Ijebu was also divided into three [[age rank]]s and these groups each had their own leaders. The Kingdom is made up of several towns that stretches to parts of Lagos State and borders Ondo State. These towns includes [[Sagamu]], [[Ijebu-Igbo]], [[Imota]], [[Ikorodu]], [[Epe, Lagos]],Ijebu-Isiwo(Pronounced as Ijebu-Ishiwo),[[Ogun Waterside]], Iwopin, [[Ibeju-Lekki|Lekki]] in [[Lagos State]], Ijebu-Imushin, Ijebu-Ife, Apunren, Erunwon, [[Isonyin]], Ososa, [[Odogbolu]] and [[Ago-Iwoye]].

The state rose in power in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries mainly due to its important position on the trade routes between [[Lagos]] and [[Ibadan]]. The kingdom imposed sharp limits on trade insisting that all trade through the region be conducted by Ijebu merchants. The monopoly brought great wealth to the kingdom, but also annoyed Europeans.

In 1892 the British attacked Ijebu in response to its barriers on trade&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://litcaf.com/ijebu-history/|title=Ijebu History|last=|first=|date=|website=LitCaf Encyclopedia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The British were successful and occupied the capital, burning the meeting hall of the Osugbo. The British army employed [[Maxim gun]]s, according to the soldier-adventurer [[Frederick Lugard]]. In defending himself against charges of excessive death rates in Uganda from his own use of the gun, he stated: "On the West Coast, in the 'Jebu' war, undertaken by Government, I have been told 'several thousands' were mowed down by the Maxim."&lt;ref&gt;Lugard, cited by Cedric Pulford: ''Eating Uganda: From Christianity to Conquest'', 1999, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

For several years the capital was occupied by British troops as the kingdom was annexed to the colony of [[Southern Nigeria Protectorate|Southern Nigeria]]. Today, it constitutes one of the [[List of Nigerian traditional states|traditional states]] of Nigeria.

The Ijebu kingdom was governed by a king and his group of elders, who usually were men of a higher status and of considerable influence. The council governed the region and had representatives of further devolved councils who no longer have any power. Since the invasion of [[Lord Lugard]] these councils have continued to meet and advise the [[Obanta]], their power, however, is largely ceremonial since the establishment of [[British Rule]] in their protectorate. The elders were known to represent their various villages and the will of the people and are now not such a significant part in the ceremonial process.The elders were all given individual titles and the lead elder was given the title prince, although he was never to inherit the kingship, except in special circumstances. The traditional belief was similar to that of the Chinese [[Mandate of Heaven]].
The kind of Yoruba spoken in Ijebu lands is Ijebu

The current king is Oba Sikiru Kayode Adetona, the Awujale

'''Jane MacLaren Walsh''' is an [[anthropologist]] and researcher at the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]]'s [[National Museum of Natural History]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]  She is known for her role in exposing faked [[pre-Columbian]] artifacts. Notable cases she has investigated include [[crystal skull]]s alleged to have been of ancient [[Mesoamerica]]n (usually [[Maya civilization|Maya]]) origins, and a piece held by the [[Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection]] purported to be an authentic pre-Columbian representation of an [[Aztec]] and central Mexican goddess, [[Tlazolteotl]].&lt;ref&gt;Walsh (2008a; 2008b)&lt;/ref&gt;

Walsh's interest in [[crystal skulls]] began with the anonymous delivery of one such object to the Smithsonian in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;See Walsh's retelling of the incident in an article published in ''Archaeology'' magazine (Walsh 2008a).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jordan Fantosme''' (died c. 1185) was an [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] historian, chronicler, and [[trouvère]]. He was a cleric and probably the [[spiritual chancellor]] of the [[Diocese of Winchester]]. His major work is an [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] verse chronicle of [[Revolt of 1173–1174|the war]] between [[Henry II of England]] and his son [[Henry the Young King]] and [[William I of Scotland]] in 1173–1174. As literature, it stands, according to its latest editor, "absolutely first class".

It has been conjectured{{By whom|date=December 2010}} that Fantosme was an Italian (named ''Giordano Fantasma'') who came to England in the train of [[Henry of Blois]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Palgrave|F. Palgrave]], ''The Rise and Progress of the English Commonwealth. Anglo-Saxon Period'', I, London, 1832, p. [https://books.google.be/books?id=mdFPAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA661-IA33 xvi].&lt;/ref&gt; A few lines from his poem suggests that he was [[Scoto-Norman]], but this may have been inserted for the sake of the [[minstrel]]s who would be reciting the piece. On the other hand, Fantosme may have simply identified with his adopted country, he referred to messengers of William, who were also subjects of the Young King, as ''noz'' (ours). Considering his evident knowledge and skill in the Anglo-Norman language, the most likely hypothesis is that he was Anglo-Norman.

Fantosme was in fact a partisan of Henry II, though his work has been noted for its impartiality and admired for its detail and vigour. Nonetheless, it has been criticised frequently in the past, because of its unusual metre, as a deterioration of the continental French style, but more recent analysis by R. C. Johnston has led to the conclusion that in fact Fantosme's chronicle represents a conscious insular style of French verse. This hypothesis rests in part on the assumption that Fantosme integrated some characteristics of [[Occitan literature|Occitan verse]] (perhaps ''[[Cobla (Occitan literary term)|coblas]]'' by the [[troubadour]] [[Jaufre Rudel]]) he encountered during a stay in [[Poitiers]] in the 1140s, where he probably studied under [[Gilbert de la Porrée]].&lt;ref&gt;John Gillingham, "Events and Opinions: Norman and English Views of Aquitaine, c.1152–c.1204" (pp.&amp;nbsp;57–82). ''The World of Eleanor of Aquitaine: Literature and Society in Southern France between the Eleventh and Twelfth Centuries'', Marcus Bull and Catherine Léglu, edd. (Woodbridge: Boydell Press, 2005. {{ISBN|1-84383-114-7}}), p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Fantosme was a contemporary and often claimed to be an eye-witness of the events he describes, but another probable source is [[Richard of Ilchester]], his bishop. His work is in general a reliable historical source.

A [[Goliard]]ic [[Latin language|Latin]] poem defending the [[incarnation]] and [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] of [[Jesus Christ]] and which is preserved in many manuscripts is entitled in one near-contemporary source as ''Rithmus Jordanis Fantasmatis'' and it is likely that the author was Fantosme, or at least believed to be Fantosme. Elsewhere the skillful poem is entitled ''Prædicatio Goliæ'' ("Preaching of Golias").

A legal document of 10 April 1160 refers to a ''Magistrum Jordanum Fantasma'' in [[Fareham]] near [[Portsmouth]]. He is recorded in connexion with the diocese of Winchester between about 1150 and 1180. At about the time of the war he versified he was involved in a suit against John Joichel, who had an unlicensed opened a school in [[Winchester]]; he won the suit.

 [[Image:Lech 111.PNG|thumb|upright|Lech, Czech, Rus and the [[Coat of arms of Poland|White Eagle]], as painted by [[Walery Eljasz-Radzikowski]] (1841–1905)]]

'''Lech, Czech and Rus''' ({{IPA-cs|lɛx tʃɛx rus}}) refers to a [[founding myth]] of three Slavic peoples: the [[Poles]] (or [[Lechites]]), the [[Czechs]], and the [[Rus' people]]. The three legendary brothers appear together in the ''[[Wielkopolska Chronicle]]'', compiled in the early 14th century. The legend states that the brothers, on a hunting trip, followed different prey and thus travelled (and settled) in different directions; Lech in the north, Czech in the west, and Rus in the East. There are multiple versions of the legend, including several regional variants throughout [[West Slavic peoples|West Slavic]], and to lesser extent, other [[Slavic countries]] that mention only one or two brothers. The three also figure into the [[origin myth]] of [[South Slavic peoples]] in some legends.

==Polish version==
 [[Image:Chronica Polonorum Lech &amp; Czech.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The brothers Lech and Czech, founders of [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] lands of [[Lechia]] ([[Poland]]) and [[Bohemia]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]) in "[[Chronica Polonorum (Miechowita)|Chronica Polonorum]]" (1506)]]
In the Polish version of the legend, three brothers went hunting together but each of them followed a different prey and eventually they all traveled in different directions. Rus went to the east, Čech headed to the west to settle on the [[Říp Mountain]] rising up from the Bohemian hilly countryside, while Lech traveled north. There, while hunting, he followed his arrow and suddenly found himself face-to-face with a fierce, white eagle guarding its nest from intruders. Seeing the eagle against the red of the setting sun, Lech took this as a good omen and decided to settle there. He named his [[Gord (Slavic settlement)|settlement]] [[Gniezno]] ([[Polish language|Polish]] ''gniazdo'' - 'nest') in commemoration and adopted the [[Coat of Arms of Poland|White Eagle]] as his [[coat-of-arms]]. The white eagle remains a symbol of Poland to this day, and the colors of the eagle and the setting sun are depicted in Poland's coat of arms, as well as its flag, with a white stripe on top for the eagle, and a red stripe on the bottom for the sunset.

According to ''[[Wielkopolska Chronicle]]'' (13th century), Slavs are descendants of [[Pan (prince)|Pan]], a [[Pannonia]]n prince. He had three sons - Lech (the oldest), Rus, and Čech (the youngest), who decided to settle west, north, and east.&lt;ref&gt;[[Czesław Łuczak]], Kazimierz Tymieniecki, ''Europa, Słowiańszczyzna, Polska.'' 1970. p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brygida Kurbisówna, ''Studia nad Kroniką wielkopolską'', Poznańskie Towarzystwo Przyjaciół Nauk, Poznań 1952.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adam Fałowski, Bogdan Sendero, ''Biesiada słowiańska'', Universitas, Kraków 1992, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Kultura polski średniowiecznej XIV-XV w.'' pod red. B. Geremka, Wydawnictwo Naukowe Semper, Warszawa 1997, p. 651.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Kronika wielkopolska'', wstęp i tłum. K. Abgarowicz, Warszawa 1965; UNIVERSITAS, Poznań 2010, {{ISBN|978-83-242-1275-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.litdok.de/cgi-bin/litdok?lang=pl&amp;t_multi=x&amp;v_0=PER&amp;q_0=dalimil Kronika Dalimila] [in:] LitDok ''Europa Środkowo-Wschodnia'', Herder-Institut, Marburg.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Czech version==
A variant of this legend, involving only two brothers, is also known in the [[Czech Republic]]. The apparently best known version by the 19th century author [[Alois Jirásek]] appeared in his retelling of ''[[Ancient Bohemian Legends|Staré pověsti české]] (Old Bohemian Legends)''. While the older chronicles from 14th century (such as those of [[Chronicle of Dalimil|Dalimil]], [[Wenceslaus Hajek]] and Přibík Pulkava z Radenína) the location of Čech and Lech's homeland ''Charvaty'' is not specified, in the work of Jirásek it is more closely determined; ''Za Tatrami, v rovinách při řece Visle rozkládala se od nepaměti charvátská země, část prvotní veliké vlasti slovanské'' (Behind the [[Tatra Mountains]], in the plains of the river [[Vistula]], stretched from immemorial time Charvátská country (probably [[White Croatia]]), the initial part of the great Slavic homeland), and ''V té charvátské zemi bytovala četná plemena, příbuzná jazykem, mravy, způsobem života'' (In Charvátská existed numerous tribes, related by language, manners, and way of life).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alois Jirásek|title=Staré pověsti české|isbn=9788088061144|url=https://books.google.cz/books?id=AjqMBgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=cs#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=29 August 2015|chapter=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, numerous battles had made the country very unfavorable for the people, who were accustomed to live in peace, cultivate the land and grow grain. 
[[Image:Josef Mathauser - Praotec Čech na hoře Říp.jpg|thumb|Čech on [[Říp Mountain]]]]
According to other versions, the reason was that Čech had been accused of a murder. They gathered their people and set off towards the sunset. As in the Polish version, Čech is identified as the founder of the [[Czechs|Czech nation]] (''Češi'' pl.) and Lech as the founder of the [[Polish nation]].

According to the Chronicle of Dalimil (1314), when Čech and his people climbed [[Říp Mountain]], he looked upon the landscape and told his brothers that they have reached the promised land: a country where there are enough of beasts, birds, fish and bees so that their tables will be always full, and where they could defend themselves against enemies.&lt;ref name="hora"&gt;{{cite web|title=Praotec Čech|url=http://www.hora-rip.cz/praotec-cech.php/#dalimilova-kronika|website=hora-rip.cz|accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He settled in the area with a tribe and, according to the ''Přibík Pulkava'' version (circa 1374), his brother Lech continued his journey to the lowlands over the snowy mountains of the north, where he founded Poland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucl.cas.cz/edicee/data/antologie/zliteratury/VZCL3/99.pdf Přibík Pulkava]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wenceslaus Hajek]]'s version from 1541 adds many (probably fanciful) details not found in other sources. According to Hájek, the brothers were dukes who had already owned castles in their homeland before their arrival in the region and dates their arrival to the year 644.&lt;ref name="hora"/&gt;

==Other variants==
A similar legend (with partly changed names) was also registered in folk tales at two widely separated locations in [[Croatia]]: in the [[Kajkavian dialect]] of Krapina in [[Hrvatsko Zagorje|Zagorje]] (northern Croatia) and in the [[Chakavian dialect]] of Poljica on the [[Adriatic Sea]] (central [[Dalmatia]]). The Croatian variant was described and analysed in detail by S. Sakač in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Krapina-Kijev-Ararat, ''Priča o troje braće i jednoj sestri''. Život 21/3: 129–149, Zagreb&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legend versus reality==
In the Bohemian chronicles, Čech appears on his own or only with Lech. Čech is first mentioned in Latin as ''Bohemus'' in the [[Cosmas of Prague|Cosmas]]' chronicle of 1125.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} The earliest Polish mention of Lech, Čech, and Rus is found in the ''[[Chronicle of Greater Poland]]''&lt;ref&gt;"Fix hiis itaque Pannoniis tres fratres filii Pan principis Pannoniorum nati fuere quorum primogenitus Lech, alter Rus, tercius Czech nomine habuerunt. Et hii tres hec tria regna Lechitarum, Ruthenorum, et Czechorum quit et Bohemi [...] Germo est quaddam instrumentum in quo duo boves simul iuncti trahendo aratrum seu plaustrum incedunt, sic et Theutunici cum slavis regna contigua habentes simul  ..."  Translation: Among the Pannonians, therefore, three brothers were born to Pan, prince of the Pannonians. The first was named Lech, the second Rus and the third Czech. These three held the three kingdoms of the Lechites [Poles], Ruthenians and Czechs (or Bohemians) […] Germo is a type of vehicle in which two oxen are yoked together to draw a plough or pull a cart, and so the Germans and the Slavs, having common borders, pull together; there is no people in the world so familiar and friendly to one another as the Slavs and Germans. [in:] Chronica Poloniae Maioris. Kronika Wielkopolska. ed. and commentary by Brygida Kürbis.  Warszawa 1970&lt;/ref&gt; written at the end of the 13th or the beginning of the 14th century.

[[File:Balto-Slavic lng.png|thumb|Area of Balto-Slavic dialectic continuum (''purple'') with proposed Bronze Age material cultures in ''white''. ''Red'' dots indicate archaic Slavic hydronyms]]
The legend suggests a common ancestry of the [[Poles]], [[Czechs]] and possibly [[Rus people]], and illustrates the fact that as early as the 13th century at least three different Slavic peoples were aware of being ethnically and linguistically interrelated and, indeed, derived from a common root stock. The legends also agree on the location of the homeland of the [[Early Slavs|Early Slavic peoples]] in [[Eastern Europe]]. This area overlapped the region presumed by mainstream scholarship to be the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Proto-Indo-European]] homeland in the general region of the [[Pontic-Caspian steppe]].&lt;ref name="Anthony2007"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Horse, the Wheel, and Language: How Bronze Age Riders from the Eurasian Steppes Shaped the Modern World |last=Anthony |first=David W. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2007 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, NJ |isbn=978-0-691-05887-0 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the framework of the [[Kurgan hypothesis]], "the Indo-Europeans who remained after the migrations became speakers of Balto-Slavic".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kortlandt.nl/publications/art111e.pdf F. Kortlandt, The spread of the Indo-Europeans], p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

The most well-known version of the legend is seen to be somewhat Polocentric, as it mentions a national symbol (the white eagle) only for Lech and the Polish nation, while relegating the two other brothers Czech and Rus to secondary characters. Furthermore, this particular version does not address the origin of the South Slavonic peoples.

The legend also attempts to explain the etymology of the [[ethnonym]]s: [[Lechia]] (another name for Poland including [[Silesia]]), the [[Czech lands]] (including Bohemia, [[Moravia]], and also [[Silesia]]), and [[Rus' (region)|Rus']]. [[Jan Kochanowski]], a prominent [[Polish Renaissance|Renaissance]] Polish [[man of letters]], in his essay on the origin of the [[Slavs]], makes no mention of the third "brother", Rus. Moreover, he dismisses the legend entirely, stating that "no historian who has taken up the subject of the Slavic nation [...] mentions any of those two Slavic leaders, Lech and Czech". He goes on to assume that "Czechy" and "Lechy" are quite probably the original names for the two nations, although he does not dismiss the possibility that there might have been a great leader by the name Lech whose name replaced the original and later forgotten name for the Polish nation.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Kochanowski, ''Proza polska'', Universitas, Kraków 2004, pp. 19-21 (in Polish)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
===Oaks of Rogalin===
 [[Image:RogalinOaks.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Lech, Czech, and Rus oaks in [[Rogalin]], [[Poland]]]]
Three large [[oak]]s in the garden adjacent to the 18th-century palace in [[Rogalin]], [[Greater Poland]], are named after the brothers (''Lech, Czech i Rus''), and are several hundred years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Patrick |last=Taylor |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S1zI1zwIFcUC&amp;pg=PA411 |title=The Oxford Companion to the Garden |page=411 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |isbn=0-198-66255-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; They vary between {{convert|670|and|930|cm|ft|sigfig=2}} in circumference.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3062">'''Levan, son of Bakar''' ({{lang-ka|ლევან ბაქარის ძე}}) or '''Leon Bakarovich Gruzinsky''' ({{lang-ru|Леон Бакарович Грузинский}}) (6 September 1728 &amp;ndash; 23 June 1763) was a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] prince of the [[House of Mukhrani|Mukhrani]] branch of the royal [[Bagrationi dynasty]]. In Russia he bore the surname of [[Gruzinsky]].

== Career ==
Prince Levan was the son of [[Prince Bakar of Kartli]] who had followed his father [[Vakhtang VI of Kartli]], the king of [[Kartli]], into exile to Russia in 1724. Levan was educated at the [[University of Moscow]] and, beyond Georgian and Russian, commanded Latin, French, and German languages. Like many of his family members and relatives, he then pursued military career. He served in the elite [[Izmaylovsky Regiment]], attaining to the rank of Second Major of the Imperial Russian army. Levan was keenly interested in history and authored one of the first Georgian textbooks in world history, outlining the history of about 50 countries and peoples. Prince Levan died on 23 June 1763. He was buried at the [[Donskoy Monastery]] in [[Moscow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Rukhadze|first=T.|encyclopedia=ქართული საბჭოთა ენცილოპედია [Georgian Soviet Encyclopedia]|title=ლევან ბატონიშვილი |trans-title=Levan Batonishvili |year=1983 |volume=6 |location= Tbilisi |language= Georgian |page = 106; 156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family ==
In 1752 Levan married Princess Aleksandra Yakovlevna [[Sibirsky (family)|Sibirsky]] (1728-1793), whose grandmother was sister of the [[Tsaritsa]] of Russia [[Agafya Grushetskaya]]. After the marriage Prince Levan moved to the village of Brynkovo, a dowry of his wife. Prince Levan lived 13 years in marriage and left a widowed 35-year-old wife. The couple had nine children, of whom, Princess Anna married Alexander Dadiani of the Georgian noble [[House of Dadiani]].

The children of Prince Levan with Princess Aleksandra Sibirsky were:

*[[Iakob Gruzinsky]]
*Dimitri Bagration-Gruzinsky
*Leon Bagration-Gruzinsky
*Alexander Bagration-Gruzinsky
*Marta Bagration-Gruzinsky
*Daria Bagration-Gruzinsky
*Maria Bagration-Gruzinsky
*Sofia Bagration-Gruzinsky
*Anastasia Bagration-Gruzinsky

The 19th-century artist [[Pyotr Gruzinsky]] was Levan's descendant through his son, Iakob. He was the last direct male descendant of King [[Vakhtang VI of Kartli]] and the last in the Gruzinsky line.

This is a '''list of [[Hijri years]]''' ({{lang-la|anno Hegirae}} or '''AH''') with the corresponding [[common era]] years where applicable. For Hijri years since 1298 (AD 1880/1881) the  [[Gregorian date]] of 1 [[Muharram]], the [[Islamic New Year|first day of the year]] in the  [[Islamic calendar]], is given.

The first Hijri year (AH 1) was retrospectively considered to have begun on the [[Julian calendar]] date 15 July [[622]] (known as the ‘astronomical’ or ‘Thursday’ epoch, [[Julian day]] 1,948,439) or 16 July 622 (the ‘civil’ or ‘Friday’ epoch, Julian day 1,948,440), denoted as "1 Muharram, AH  1". Years prior to this are reckoned in English as '''BH''' ("Before the Hijra").&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution-url=http://www.sharjah.ae/registration-locations.aspx?Val=111 |url=http://www.sharjah.ae/ |title=''Official site'' |publisher=Government of Sharjah |location= |accessdate=21 January 2017 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In principle, each Islamic month begins with sighting of the new crescent moon (after a [[New Moon]]) at sunset. Because of this, the calendar is dependent on observational conditions and cannot be predicted or reconstructed with certainty, but [[tabular Islamic calendar|tabular calendars]] are in use which determine the dates algorithmically. Because of this, dates may vary by up to two days between traditions or countries.

[[File:Margaret Wertheim speaking at TED in 2009.jpg|thumb|Margaret Wertheim speaking at [[TED (conference)|TED]] in 2009]]
'''Margaret Wertheim''' (born 20 August 1958, [[Brisbane]], [[Australia]]) is a [[science writer]] and the author of books on the [[cultural history]] of [[physics]]. She is one of a pair of twins who reside together in Los Angeles, CA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.laweekly.com/arts/talking-with-the-institute-for-figurings-margaret-and-christine-wertheim-2157781|title=Talking with the Institute for Figuring’s Margaret and Christine Wertheim|last=McKenna|first=Kristine|date=2009-01-07|work=L.A. Weekly|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also creates exhibitions at the intersection of science and art which are shown around the world. She has won the 2016 ''[[Klopsteg Memorial Award]]'' from the [[American Association of Physics Teachers]], and Australia's ''Scientia Medal'' (2017) for her work with public science engagement.

== Education and Research ==
Both a research associate at the American Natural Museum of Natural History located in New York and a fellow at the Los Angeles Institute for the Humanities&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.edge.org/memberbio/margaret_wertheim|title=Margaret  Wertheim {{!}} Edge.org|website=www.edge.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;,Wertheim's education includes two Bachelor's degrees, one of which is a Bachelor of Science in Pure and Applied Physics, and the other a Bachelor of Arts in Pure Mathematics and Computing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/faithandreason/bio/margaret-body.html|title=Biography: Margaret Wertheim|website=www.pbs.org|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Wertheim is the author of six books, including a trilogy that collectively considers the role of theoretical physics in the cultural landscape of modern Western society. The first, ''Pythagoras' Trousers'', is a history of the relationship between physics, religion, and gender relations. The second, ''The Pearly Gates of Cyberspace'', charts the history of scientific thinking about space from Dante to the Internet. The third book in this series, ''Physics on the Fringe'', looks at the idiosyncratic world of "outsider physicists" such as [[Jim Carter (fringe scientist)|Jim Carter]], people with little or no scientific training who develop their own alternative theories of the universe.&lt;ref name="hoffman"&gt;Jascha Hoffman, "Q&amp;A: The outsider insider", ''Nature'' 11/3/2011, Vol. 479 Issue 7371, p40&lt;/ref&gt; 

As a journalist, Wertheim has written for the ''[[New York Times]]'', the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', the ''[[Washington Post]]'' and is a contributing editor to ''[[Cabinet (magazine)|Cabinet]]'' magazine, the international arts and culture quarterly. From 2001 to 2005, she wrote the "Quark Soup" science column for the ''[[LA Weekly]]'', sister paper to the ''[[Village Voice]]'' and is now a regular writer for ''[[Aeon]]''.  In 2006, her writing was awarded the print journalism prize from the [[American Institute of Biological Sciences]] and, in 2004, she was the [[National Science Foundation]] visiting journalist to Antarctica. For ten years in her native Australia she wrote regular columns about science and technology for women's magazines such as ''[[Vogue Australia]]'' and ''Elle Australia'' - she may be the only journalist in the world to have held such a position. Her work has been included in ''Best American Science Writing 2003'', edited by [[Oliver Sacks]]; ''Best Australian Science Writing'' 2015, 2016, 2018 (Newsouth Press); and ''Best Writing on Mathematics 2018'' (Princeton University Press). In 2016 she was granted the [[Klopsteg Memorial Award]] for communicating "the joy of physics," by the American Association of Physics Teachers – the first woman to gain this honor in 10 years; and in 2017 she won Australia's ''Scientia Medal'', awarded by the University of New South Wales.

==Institute For Figuring==
[[File:The Föhr Reef in Tübingen.JPG|thumb|''The Föhr Reef'' exhibited as part of the ''Crochet Coral Reef'' project by Margaret and Christine Wertheim and the Institute For Figuring in [[Tübingen]] (Germany) in 2013]]     
In 2003, Wertheim and her twin sister Christine founded the [[Institute For Figuring]], an organization based in Los Angeles that promotes the poetic and aesthetic dimensions of science and mathematics. Christine Wertheim is a faculty member of the Department of Critical Studies at [[CalArts]]. Through their work with the IFF, the Wertheim twins have created exhibitions on scientific and mathematical themes at art galleries and science museums around the world, including the [[Andy Warhol Museum]] in Pittsburgh, the [[Santa Monica Museum of Art]], [[Art Center College of Design]] in Pasadena, [[Machine Project]] and the [[Museum of Jurassic Technology]] in Los Angeles, the [[Science Gallery]] at Trinity College in Dublin, [[Museum of Arts and Design]] and the [[Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum|Cooper Hewitt]] in New York, and the [[Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History]] in Washington D.C. 

The IFF's ''Crochet Coral Reef'' project is perhaps the largest participatory art and science endeavor in the world. By creating giant installations out of yarn that mimic living coral reefs, the project resides at the intersection of mathematics, science, handicraft, environmentalism and community art practice. The project teaches audiences about non-Euclidean geometry while also engaging them with the subject of climate change and the decimation of reefs due to global warming. As of late 2018, more than 10,000 people from New York and London, to Riga and Abu Dhabi, have actively contributed pieces to ''Crochet Coral Reef'' exhibitions in more than forty cities and countries. More than two million people have seen these shows. In the Forward to ''Crochet Coral Reef'' the book, Donna Haraway calls the project "palpable, polymorphous, powerful and terrifying stitchery."

'''Mark Kurlansky''' (December 7, 1948) is an American journalist and writer of general interest non-fiction. He has written a number of books of fiction and non-fiction. His 1997 book, ''Cod: A Biography of the Fish That Changed the World'' (1997), was an international bestseller and was translated into more than 15 languages. His book ''[[Nonviolence: The History of a Dangerous Idea|Nonviolence: Twenty-five Lessons From the History of a Dangerous Idea]]'' (2006) was the non-fiction winner of the 2007 [[Dayton Literary Peace Prize]].

==Life and work==
Kurlansky was born in [[Hartford, Connecticut]] on December 7, 1948.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/bic1/BiographiesDetailsPage/BiographiesDetailsWindow?failOverType=&amp;query=&amp;prodId=BIC1&amp;windowstate=normal&amp;contentModules=&amp;display-query=&amp;mode=view&amp;displayGroupName=Biographies&amp;limiter=&amp;currPage=&amp;disableHighlighting=false&amp;displayGroups=&amp;sortBy=&amp;search_within_results=&amp;p=BIC1&amp;action=e&amp;catId=&amp;activityType=&amp;scanId=&amp;documentId=GALE%7CH1000125711&amp;source=Bookmark&amp;u=mlin_n_umass&amp;jsid=dec5904bea83289174253ad3fa4f99b0|title = Contemporary Authors Online|date = 2012|access-date = January 13, 2016|website = Biography in Context|publisher = Gale|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Butler University]], where he earned a BA in 1970.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  From 1976 to 1991 he worked as a correspondent in Western Europe for the ''[[Miami Herald]]'', ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', and eventually the [[Paris]]-based ''[[International Herald Tribune]]''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/bic1/BiographiesDetailsPage/BiographiesDetailsWindow?failOverType=&amp;query=&amp;prodId=BIC1&amp;windowstate=normal&amp;contentModules=&amp;display-query=&amp;mode=view&amp;displayGroupName=Biographies&amp;limiter=&amp;currPage=&amp;disableHighlighting=false&amp;displayGroups=&amp;sortBy=&amp;search_within_results=&amp;p=BIC1&amp;action=e&amp;catId=&amp;activityType=&amp;scanId=&amp;documentId=GALE%7CK1649571367&amp;source=Bookmark&amp;u=mlin_n_umass&amp;jsid=763191edd23479d2096202f5f526c8db|title = The Writers Directory|date = 2015|access-date = January 13, 2016|website = Biography in Context|publisher = Gale|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to [[Mexico]] in 1982, where he continued to practice journalism.  In 2007 he was named the [[Baruch College]] Harman writer-in-residence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Kurlansky wrote his first book, ''A Continent of Islands'', in 1992 and went on to write several more throughout the 1990s. His 1997 book ''Cod: A Biography of the Fish That Changed the World'' was an international bestseller and was translated into more than 15 languages. His work and contribution to [[Basques|Basque]] identity and culture was recognized in 2001 when the Society of Basque Studies in America named him to the Basque Hall of Fame.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  That same year, he was awarded an honorary ambassadorship from the Basque government.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As a teenager, Kurlansky called [[Émile Zola]] his "hero", and in 2009 he translated one of Zola's novels, ''[[The Belly of Paris]]'', whose theme is the food markets of Paris.&lt;ref name=bop&gt;[http://paris-expat.com/books/interviews/mark-kurlansky/ "A Conversation with Mark Kurlansky, translator of Zola’s Classic"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120232858/http://paris-expat.com/books/interviews/mark-kurlansky/ |date=January 20, 2015 }}, conversation with Terrance Gelenter&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurlansky's 2009 book ''The Food of a Younger Land'', with the lengthy subtitle "A portrait of American food – before the national highway system, before chain restaurants, and before frozen food, when the nation's food was seasonal, regional, and traditional – from the lost [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] files", details American foodways in the early 20th century.

'''Mathematics and art''' are related in a variety of ways. [[Mathematics]] has itself been described as an [[art]] [[mathematical beauty|motivated by beauty]]. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as [[Music and mathematics|music]], [[dance]], [[painting]], [[Mathematics and architecture|architecture]], [[sculpture]], and [[Mathematics and fiber arts|textiles]]. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.

Mathematics and art have a long historical relationship. [[List of mathematical artists|Artists have used mathematics]] since the 4th century BC when the Greek [[sculpture|sculptor]] [[Polykleitos]] wrote his ''Canon'', prescribing proportions based on the ratio 1:{{radic|2}} for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the [[golden ratio]] in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian [[Renaissance]], [[Luca Pacioli]] wrote the influential treatise ''[[De Divina Proportione]]'' (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, [[Piero della Francesca]], developed [[Euclid]]'s ideas on [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]] in treatises such as ''De Prospectiva Pingendi'', and in his paintings. The engraver [[Albrecht Dürer]] made many references to mathematics in his work ''[[Melencolia I]]''. In modern times, the [[graphic artist]] [[M. C. Escher]] made intensive use of [[tessellation]] and [[hyperbolic geometry]], with the help of the mathematician [[H. S. M. Coxeter]], while the [[De Stijl]] movement led by [[Theo van Doesburg]] and [[Piet Mondrian]] explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as [[quilting]], [[knitting]], [[cross-stitch]], [[crochet]], [[embroidery]], [[weaving]], [[Turkish carpet|Turkish]] and other [[carpet]]-making, as well as [[kilim]]. In [[Islamic art]], symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian [[girih]] and Moroccan [[zellige]] tilework, [[Mughal architecture|Mughal]] [[jali]] pierced stone screens, and widespread [[muqarnas]] vaulting.

Mathematics has directly influenced art with conceptual tools such as [[linear perspective]], the analysis of [[symmetry]], and mathematical objects such as [[polyhedron|polyhedra]] and the [[Möbius strip]]. [[Magnus Wenninger]] creates colourful [[stellation|stellated polyhedra]], originally as models for teaching. Mathematical concepts such as [[recursion]] and logical paradox can be seen in paintings by [[Rene Magritte]] and in engravings by M. C. Escher. [[Computer art]] often makes use of [[fractal]]s including the [[Mandelbrot set]], and sometimes explores other mathematical objects such as [[cellular automata]]. Controversially, the artist [[David Hockney]] has argued that artists from the Renaissance onwards made use of the [[camera lucida]] to draw precise representations of scenes; the architect Philip Steadman similarly argued that [[Vermeer]] used the [[camera obscura]] in his distinctively observed paintings.

Other relationships include the algorithmic analysis of artworks by [[X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy]], the finding that traditional [[batik]]s from different regions of [[Java]] have distinct [[fractal dimension]]s, and stimuli to mathematics research, especially [[Filippo Brunelleschi]]'s theory of perspective, which eventually led to [[Girard Desargues]]'s [[projective geometry]]. A persistent view, based ultimately on the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] notion of harmony in music, holds that everything was arranged by Number, that God is the geometer of the world, and that therefore the world's [[sacred geometry|geometry is sacred]], as seen in artworks such as [[William Blake]]'s ''[[The Ancient of Days]]''.

==Origins: from Ancient Greece to the Renaissance==

{{Anchor|Polykleitos}}

===Polykleitos's ''Canon'' and ''symmetria''===
[[File:Doryphoros MAN Napoli Inv6011-2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|Roman copy in marble of ''[[Doryphoros]]'', originally a bronze by [[Polykleitos]]]]
{{further information|Polykleitos}}

[[Polykleitos]] the elder (c.450–420 BC) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] [[sculptor]] from the school of [[Argos]], and a contemporary of [[Phidias]]. His works and statues consisted mainly of bronze and were of athletes. According to the philosopher and mathematician [[Xenocrates]], Polykleitos is ranked as one of the most important sculptors of [[Classical antiquity]] for his work on the ''[[Doryphorus]]'' and the statue of [[Hera]] in the [[Heraion of Argos]].&lt;ref name=Stewart&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stewart |first1=Andrew |title=Polykleitos of Argos," One Hundred Greek Sculptors: Their Careers and Extant Works |journal=[[Journal of Hellenic Studies]] |date=November 1978 |volume=98 |pages=122–131 |doi=10.2307/630196|jstor=630196}}&lt;/ref&gt; While his sculptures may not be as famous as those of Phidias, they are much admired. In the ''Canon'' of Polykleitos, a treatise he wrote designed to document the "perfect" [[anatomy|anatomical]] proportions of the male nude, Polykleitos gives us a mathematical approach towards sculpturing the human body.&lt;ref name=Stewart/&gt;

Polykleitos uses the [[distal phalanges|distal phalanx]] of the [[little finger]] as the basic module for determining the proportions of the human body.&lt;ref name=Tobin&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tobin, Richard |title=The ''Canon'' of Polykleitos |journal=[[American Journal of Archaeology]] |volume=79 |issue=4 |date=October 1975 |pages=307–321 |doi=10.2307/503064}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polykleitos multiplies the length of the distal phalanx by the [[square root of two]] ({{radic|2}}) to get the distance of the [[intermediate phalanges|second phalanges]] and multiplies the length again by {{radic|2}} to get the length of the [[proximal phalanges|third phalanges]]. Next, he takes the [[finger]] length and multiplies that by {{radic|2}} to get the length of the palm from the base of the finger to the [[ulna]]. This [[geometric series]] of measurements progresses until Polykleitos has formed the arm, chest, body, and so on.&lt;ref name=Lawton&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lawton |first1=Arthur J. |title=Pattern, Tradition and Innovation in Vernacular Architecture |journal=Past |date=2013 |volume=36 |url=http://www.pioneeramerica.org/past2013/past2013artlawton.html |quote=The base figure is a square the length and width of the distal phalange of the little finger. Its diagonals rotated to one side transform the square to a 1 : {{radic|2}} root rectangle. In Figure 5 this rectangular figure marks the width and length of the adjacent medial phalange. Rotating the medial diagonal proportions the proximal phalange and similarly from there to the wrist, from wrist to elbow and from elbow to shoulder top. Each new step advances the diagonal's pivot point.|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of the ''Canon'' of Polykleitos is immense in [[Classical Greek]], [[Ancient Rome|Roman]], and [[Renaissance]] sculpture, many sculptors following Polykleitos's prescription. While none of Polykleitos's original works survive, Roman copies demonstrate his ideal of physical perfection and mathematical precision. Some scholars argue that [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] thought influenced the ''Canon'' of Polykleitos.&lt;ref name=Raven&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Raven |first1=J. E. |title=Polyclitus and Pythagoreanism |journal=[[Classical Quarterly]] |date=1951 |volume=1|issue=3–4 |pages=147– |doi=10.1017/s0009838800004122}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Canon'' applies the basic mathematical concepts of Greek geometry, such as the ratio, proportion, and ''symmetria'' (Greek for "harmonious proportions") and turns it into a system capable of describing the human form through a series of continuous [[geometric series|geometric progressions]].&lt;ref name=Tobin/&gt;

===Perspective and proportion===
{{main article|Perspective (graphical)}}

[[File:Brunelleschi's perspective experiment.jpg|thumb|[[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]]'s experiment with [[linear perspective]]]]

In classical times, rather than making distant figures smaller with [[linear perspective]], painters sized objects and figures according to their thematic importance. In the Middle Ages, some artists used [[reverse perspective]] for special emphasis. The Muslim mathematician [[Alhazen]] (Ibn al-Haytham) described a theory of optics in his ''[[Book of Optics]]'' in 1021, but never applied it to art.&lt;ref name=StAndrews/&gt; The [[Renaissance]] saw a rebirth of [[Classical Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] culture and ideas, among them the study of mathematics to understand [[nature]] and the [[arts]]. Two major motives drove artists in the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance towards mathematics. First, painters needed to figure out how to depict three-dimensional scenes on a two-dimensional canvas. Second, philosophers and artists alike were convinced that mathematics was the true essence of the physical world and that the entire universe, including the arts, could be explained in geometric terms.&lt;ref name=Emmer&gt;{{cite book |editor=Emmer, Michelle |title=The Visual Mind II |publisher=MIT Press |date=2005 |isbn=978-0-262-05048-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rudiments of perspective arrived with [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]] (1266/7 – 1337), who attempted to draw in perspective using an algebraic method to determine the placement of distant lines. In 1415, the Italian [[architect]] [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] and his friend [[Leon Battista Alberti]] demonstrated the geometrical method of applying perspective in Florence, using [[similar triangles]] as formulated by Euclid, to find the apparent height of distant objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Vasari, Giorgio |authorlink=Giorgio Vasari |date=1550 |title=[[Lives of the Artists]] |publisher=Torrentino |page=Chapter on Brunelleschi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Alberti |first1=Leon Battista |last2=Spencer |first2=John R. |title=On Painting |date=1956 |publisher=Yale University Press |origyear=1435|url=http://www.noteaccess.com/Texts/Alberti/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brunelleschi's own perspective paintings are lost, but [[Masaccio]]'s painting of the Holy Trinity shows his principles at work.&lt;ref name=StAndrews/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Field |first1=J.

The painter [[Piero della Francesca]] (c.1415–1492) exemplified this new shift in Italian Renaissance thinking. He was an expert [[mathematician]] and [[geometer]], writing books on [[solid geometry]] and [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], including ''[[De Prospectiva Pingendi]] (On Perspective for Painting)'', ''Trattato d'Abaco (Abacus Treatise)'', and ''De corporibus regularibus (On Regular Solids)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=della Francesca, Piero |title=De Prospectiva Pingendi |editor=G.

Milanesi |date=1878 |page=490}}&lt;/ref&gt; Piero's interest in perspective can be seen in his paintings including the [[Polyptych of Perugia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zuffi |first=Stefano  |title=Piero della Francesca |publisher=L'Unità – Mondadori Arte |year=1991 |page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''San Agostino altarpiece'' and ''[[The Flagellation of Christ]]''. His work on geometry influenced later mathematicians and artists including [[Luca Pacioli]] in his ''De Divina Proportione'' and [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. Piero studied classical mathematics and the works of [[Archimedes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Heath, T.L. |title=The Thirteen Books of Euclid's Elements |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1908 |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was taught commercial arithmetic in "abacus schools"; his writings are formatted like abacus school textbooks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Grendler, P. |title=What Piero Learned in School: Fifteenth-Century Vernacular Education |work=Piero della Francesca and His Legacy |editor=M.A. Lavin |publisher=University Press of New England |year=1995 |pages=161–176}}&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps including Leonardo Pisano ([[Fibonacci]])'s 1202 ''[[Liber Abaci]]''. [[Linear perspective]] was just being introduced into the artistic world. Alberti explained in his 1435 ''[[De pictura]]'': "light rays travel in straight lines from points in the observed scene to the eye, forming a kind of [[pyramid]] with the eye as vertex." A painting constructed with linear perspective is a [[Cross section (geometry)|cross-section]] of that pyramid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Alberti, Leon Battista |title=On Painting |editor= Kemp, Martin |author2=Grayson, Cecil (trans.) |publisher=Penguin Classics |year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''De Prospectiva Pingendi'', Piero transforms his empirical observations of the way aspects of a figure change with point of view into mathematical proofs. His treatise starts in the vein of Euclid: he defines the point as "the tiniest thing that is possible for the eye to comprehend".{{efn|In Piero's Italian: "una cosa tanto picholina quanto e possible ad ochio comprendere".}}&lt;ref name=Emmer/&gt; He uses [[deductive logic]] to lead the reader to the perspective representation of a three-dimensional body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Peterson, Mark |url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/rschwart/mac/Italian/geometry.shtml |title=The Geometry of Piero della Francesca |quote=In Book I, after some elementary constructions to introduce the idea of the apparent size of an object being actually its angle subtended at the eye, and referring to Euclid's Elements Books I and VI, and Euclid's Optics, he turns, in Proposition 13, to the representation of a square lying flat on the ground in front of the viewer. What should the artist actually draw? After this, objects are constructed in the square (tilings, for example, to represent a tiled floor), and corresponding objects are constructed in perspective; in Book II prisms are erected over these planar objects, to represent houses, columns, etc.; but the basis of the method is the original square, from which everything else follows.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The artist [[David Hockney]] [[Hockney-Falco thesis|argued]] in his book ''[[Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters]]'' that artists started using a [[camera lucida]] from the 1420s, resulting in a sudden change in precision and realism, and that this practice was continued by major artists including [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]], [[Jan van Eyck|Van Eyck]], and [[Michelangelo Merisi|Caravaggio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hockney |first=David |title=Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters |year=2006 |publisher=Thames and Hudson |isbn=978-0-500-28638-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics disagree on whether Hockney was correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Van Riper |first1=Frank |title=Hockney's 'Lucid' Bomb At the Art Establishment |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/photo/essays/vanRiper/030220.htm |publisher=The Washington Post |accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Marr |first1=Andrew |title=What the eye didn't see |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2001/oct/07/featuresreview.review1 |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=4 September 2015 |date=7 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the architect Philip Steadman argued controversially&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Janson |first1=Jonathan |title=An Interview with Philip Steadman |url=http://www.essentialvermeer.com/interviews_newsletter/steadman_interview.html#.VeqxKJdUWHg |publisher=Essential Vermeer |accessdate=5 September 2015 |date=25 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; that [[Vermeer]] had used a different device, the [[camera obscura]], to help him create his distinctively observed paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Steadman |first1=Philip |title=Vermeer's Camera: Uncovering the Truth Behind the Masterpieces |date=2002 |publisher=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-280302-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1509, [[Luca Pacioli]] (c. 1447–1517) published ''[[De divina proportione]]'' on [[mathematical]] and [[artistic]] [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportion]], including in the human face. [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452–1519) illustrated the text with woodcuts of regular solids while he studied under Pacioli in the 1490s. Leonardo's drawings are probably the first illustrations of skeletonic solids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/pacioli.html |title=Luca Pacioli's Polyhedra |author=Hart, George |authorlink=George W.

As early as the 15th century, [[curvilinear perspective]] found its way into paintings by artists interested in image distortions. [[Jan van Eyck]]'s 1434 ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'' contains a convex mirror with reflections of the people in the scene,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Criminisi, A. |author2=Kempz, M. |author3=Kang, S.

Three-dimensional space can be represented convincingly in art, as in [[technical drawing]], by means other than perspective. [[Oblique projection]]s, including cavalier perspective (used by French military artists to depict fortifications in the 18th century), were used continuously and ubiquitously by Chinese artists from the first or second centuries until the 18th century. The Chinese acquired the technique from India, which acquired it from Ancient Rome. Oblique projection is seen in Japanese art, such as in the [[Ukiyo-e]] paintings of [[Torii Kiyonaga]] (1752–1815).&lt;ref name=Cucker269&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felix |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |pages=269–278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

an irrational number which is approximately 1.325.

Many traditional rugs, whether pile carpets or flatweave [[kilim]]s, are divided into a central field and a framing border; both can have symmetries, though in handwoven carpets these are often slightly broken by small details, variations of pattern and shifts in colour introduced by the weaver.&lt;ref name=Cucker89&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felix |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |pages=89–102}}&lt;/ref&gt; In kilims from [[Anatolia]], the [[motif (textile arts)|motifs]] used are themselves usually symmetrical. The general layout, too, is usually present, with arrangements such as stripes, stripes alternating with rows of motifs, and packed arrays of roughly hexagonal motifs. The field is commonly laid out as a wallpaper with a [[wallpaper group]] such as pmm, while the border may be laid out as a frieze of [[frieze group]] pm11, pmm2 or pma2. Turkish and Central Asian kilims often have three or more borders in different frieze groups. Weavers certainly had the intention of symmetry, without explicit knowledge of its mathematics.&lt;ref name=Cucker89/&gt;
The mathematician and architectural theorist [[Nikos Salingaros]] suggests that the "powerful presence"&lt;ref name=Salingaros/&gt; (aesthetic effect) of a "great carpet"&lt;ref name=Salingaros/&gt; such as the best Konya two-medallion carpets of the 17th century is created by mathematical techniques related to the theories of the architect [[Christopher Alexander]]. These techniques include making opposites couple; opposing colour values; differentiating areas geometrically, whether by using complementary shapes or balancing the directionality of sharp angles; providing small-scale complexity (from the knot level upwards) and both small- and large-scale symmetry; repeating elements at a hierarchy of different scales (with a ratio of about 2.7 from each level to the next). Salingaros argues that "all successful carpets satisfy at least nine of the above ten rules", and suggests that it might be possible to create a metric from these rules.&lt;ref name=Salingaros&gt;{{cite journal |author=Salingaros, Nikos |title=The 'life' of a carpet: an application of the Alexander rules |url=http://zeta.math.utsa.edu/~yxk833/life.carpet.html |journal=8th International Conference on Oriental Carpets |location=Philadelphia |date=November 1996}} Reprinted in {{cite book |editor1-last=Eiland |editor1-first=M. |editor2-last=Pinner |editor2-first=M. |title=Oriental Carpet and Textile Studies V |date=1998 |publisher=Conference on Oriental Carpets |location=Danville, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Islamic art]] [[Islamic geometric patterns|exploits symmetries]] in many of its artforms, notably in [[girih tiles|girih]] tilings. These are formed using a set of five tile shapes, namely a regular decagon, an elongated hexagon, a bow tie, a rhombus, and a regular pentagon. All the sides of these tiles have the same length; and all their angles are multiples of 36° (π/5 [[radian]]s), offering fivefold and tenfold symmetries. The tiles are decorated with [[strapwork]] lines (girih), generally more visible than the tile boundaries. In 2007, the physicists [[Peter Lu]] and [[Paul Steinhardt]]  argued that girih resembled [[quasicrystalline]] [[Penrose tiling]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lu, Peter J. |author2=Steinhardt, Paul J. |year=2007 |title=Decagonal and Quasi-crystalline Tilings in Medieval Islamic Architecture |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=315 |pages=1106–1110 |doi=10.1126/science.1135491 |pmid=17322056 |issue=5815 |bibcode=2007Sci...315.1106L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elaborate geometric [[zellige]] tilework is a distinctive element in [[Morocco|Moroccan]] architecture.&lt;ref name=Castera&gt;{{cite book |last1=Castera |first1=Jean Marc |last2=Peuriot |first2=Francoise |title=Arabesques.

===Polyhedra===
[[File:Leonardo polyhedra.png|thumb|The first printed illustration of a [[rhombicuboctahedron]], by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], published in ''[[De Divina Proportione]]'', 1509]]

The [[Platonic solid]]s and other [[polyhedron|polyhedra]] are a recurring theme in Western art. They are found, for instance, in a marble mosaic featuring the [[small stellated dodecahedron]], attributed to Paolo Uccello, in the floor of the [[San Marco di Venezia|San Marco Basilica]] in Venice;&lt;ref name="Hart"/&gt; in Leonardo da Vinci's diagrams of regular polyhedra drawn as illustrations for [[Luca Pacioli]]'s 1509 book ''The Divine Proportion'';&lt;ref name="Hart"/&gt; as a glass [[rhombicuboctahedron]] in Jacopo de Barbari's portrait of Pacioli, painted in 1495;&lt;ref name="Hart"/&gt; in the truncated polyhedron (and various other mathematical objects) in [[Albrecht Dürer]]'s engraving [[Melencolia I]];&lt;ref name="Hart"/&gt; and in [[Salvador Dalí]]'s painting ''The Last Supper'' in which Christ and his disciples are pictured inside a giant [[dodecahedron]].

[[Albrecht Dürer]] (1471–1528) was a [[German people|German]] [[Renaissance]] [[printmaker]] who made important contributions to polyhedral literature in his 1525 book, ''Underweysung der Messung (Education on Measurement)'', meant to teach the subjects of [[linear perspective]], [[geometry]] in [[architecture]], [[Platonic solids]], and [[regular polygons]]. Dürer was likely influenced by the works of [[Luca Pacioli]] and [[Piero della Francesca]] during his trips to [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Panofsky, E. |title=The Life and Art of Albrecht Durer |publisher=Princeton |year=1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the examples of perspective in ''Underweysung der Messung'' are underdeveloped and contain inaccuracies, there is a detailed discussion of polyhedra. Dürer is also the first to introduce in text the idea of [[Net (polyhedron)|polyhedral nets]], polyhedra unfolded to lie flat for printing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Hart, George W. |url=http://www.georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/durer.html |title=Dürer's Polyhedra |accessdate=13 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dürer published another influential book on [[human proportions]] called ''Vier Bücher von Menschlicher Proportion (Four Books on Human Proportion)'' in 1528.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dürer |first1=Albrecht |title=Hierinn sind begriffen vier Bucher von menschlicher Proportion|url=https://archive.org/details/hierinnsindbegri00dure |publisher=Archive.org |accessdate=24 June 2015 |location=Nurenberg |date=1528}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fractal dimensions===

[[File:Batik pedalaman - parang klithik.JPG|thumb|[[Batik]]s from [[Surakarta]], Java, like this ''parang klithik'' sword pattern, have a [[fractal dimension]] between 1.2 and 1.5.]]

Traditional Indonesian wax-resist [[batik]] designs on cloth combine [[representation (arts)|representational]] motifs (such as floral and vegetal elements) with abstract and somewhat chaotic elements, including imprecision in applying the wax resist, and random variation introduced by cracking of the wax. Batik designs have a [[fractal dimension]] between 1 and 2, varying in different regional styles. For example, the batik of [[Cirebon]] has a fractal dimension of 1.1; the batiks of [[Yogyakarta]] and [[Surakarta]] (Solo) in Central [[Java]] have a fractal dimension of 1.2 to 1.5; and the batiks of [[Rembang Regency|Lasem]] on the north coast of Java and of [[Tasikmalaya]] in West Java have a fractal dimension between 1.5 and 1.7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lukman |first1=Muhamad |last2=Hariadi |first2=Yun |last3=Destiarmand |first3=Achmad Haldani |title=Batik Fractal : Traditional Art to Modern Complexity |journal=Proceeding Generative Art X, Milan, Italy |date=2007 |url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/36748400/32.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ56TQJRTWSMTNPEA&amp;Expires=1474897246&amp;Signature=kXmu3pdTrpZ1pkw8CLV3GHNR%2FVs%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DBatik_Fractal_Traditional_Art_to_Modern.pdf |accessdate=26 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[drip painting]] works of the modern artist [[Jackson Pollock]] are similarly distinctive in their fractal dimension. His 1948 ''Number 14'' has a coastline-like dimension of 1.45, while his later paintings had successively higher fractal dimensions and accordingly more elaborate patterns. One of his last works, ''Blue Poles'', took six months to create, and has the fractal dimension of 1.72.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ouellette |first1=Jennifer |title=Pollock's Fractals |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2001/nov/featpollock |accessdate=26 September 2016 |agency=Discover Magazine |date=November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==A complex relationship==
The astronomer [[Galileo Galilei]] in his ''[[Il Saggiatore]]'' wrote that "[The universe] is written in [[patterns in nature|the language of mathematics]], and its characters are triangles, circles, and other geometric figures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Galilei, Galileo |authorlink=Galileo Galilei |title=The Assayer |year=1623}}, as translated in {{cite book |author=Drake, Stillman |authorlink=Stillman Drake  |year=1957 |title=Discoveries and Opinions of Galileo |publisher=Doubleday |pages=237–238 |isbn=0-385-09239-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists who strive and seek to study nature must first, in Galileo's view, fully understand mathematics. Mathematicians, conversely, have sought to interpret and analyse art through the lens of geometry and rationality. The mathematician Felipe Cucker suggests that mathematics, and especially geometry, is a source of rules for "rule-driven artistic creation", though not the only one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felix |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |page=381}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the many strands of the resulting complex relationship&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felix |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; are described below.

[[File:Ghhardy@72.jpg|thumb|upright|The mathematician [[G. H. Hardy]] defined a set of criteria for [[mathematical beauty]].]]

===Mathematics as an art===
{{main article|Mathematical beauty}}

The mathematician Jerry P. King describes mathematics as an art, stating that "the keys to mathematics are beauty and elegance and not dullness and technicality", and that beauty is the motivating force for mathematical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=King |first1=Jerry P. |title=The Art of Mathematics |date=1992 |publisher=Fawcett Columbine |isbn=0-449-90835-6 |pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; King cites the mathematician [[G. H. Hardy]]'s 1940 essay ''[[A Mathematician's Apology]]''. In it, Hardy discusses why he finds two theorems of [[classical antiquity|classical times]] as first rate, namely [[Euclid]]'s proof there are infinitely many [[prime number]]s, and the proof that the square root of 2 is [[irrational number|irrational]]. King evaluates this last against Hardy's criteria for [[mathematical beauty|mathematical elegance]]: "''seriousness, depth, generality, unexpectedness, inevitability'', and ''economy''" (King's italics), and describes the proof as "aesthetically pleasing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=King |first1=Jerry P. |title=The Art of Mathematics |date=1992 |publisher=Fawcett Columbine |isbn=0-449-90835-6 |pages=135–139}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hungarian mathematician [[Paul Erdős]] agreed that mathematics possessed beauty but considered the reasons beyond explanation: "Why are numbers beautiful? It's like asking why is [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Ninth Symphony]] beautiful. If you don't see why, someone can't tell you. I ''know'' numbers are beautiful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Devlin |first=Keith |title=The Math Gene: How Mathematical Thinking Evolved And Why Numbers Are Like Gossip |publisher=Basic Books |year=2000 |page=140 |chapter=Do Mathematicians Have Different Brains? |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AJdmfYEaLG4C |isbn=978-0-465-01619-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The artist [[Richard Wright]] argues that mathematical objects that can be constructed can be seen either "as processes to simulate phenomena" or as works of "[[computer art]]". He considers the nature of mathematical thought, observing that [[fractals]] were known to mathematicians for a century before they were recognised as such. Wright concludes by stating that it is appropriate to subject mathematical objects to any methods used to "come to terms with cultural artifacts like art, the tension between objectivity and subjectivity, their metaphorical meanings and the character of representational systems." He gives as instances an image from the [[Mandelbrot set]], an image generated by a [[cellular automaton]] algorithm, and a [[rendering (computer graphics)|computer-rendered]] image, and discusses, with reference to the [[Turing test]], whether [[algorithm]]ic products can be art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wright |first1=Richard |title=Some Issues in the Development of Computer Art as a Mathematical Art Form |journal=[[Leonardo (journal)|Leonardo]] |date=1988 |volume=1 |issue=Electronic Art, supplemental issue |pages=103–110 |doi=10.2307/1557919 |jstor=1557919}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sasho Kalajdzievski's ''Math and Art: An Introduction to Visual Mathematics'' takes a similar approach, looking at suitably visual mathematics topics such as tilings, fractals and hyperbolic geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kalajdzievski |first1=Sasho |title=Math and Art: An Introduction to Visual Mathematics |date=2008 |publisher=Chapman and Hall |isbn=978-1-58488-913-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mathematician and [[theoretical physicist]] [[Henri Poincaré]]'s ''[[Science and Hypothesis]]'' was widely read by the [[Cubism|Cubists]], including [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Jean Metzinger]].&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Miller, Arthur I. |title=Insights of Genius: Imagery and Creativity in Science and Art |publisher=Springer |year=2012 |isbn=1-4612-2388-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poincaré viewed [[Euclidean geometry]] as just one of many possible geometric configurations, rather than as an absolute objective truth. The possible existence of a [[Fourth dimension in art|fourth dimension]] inspired artists to question classical [[Perspective (graphical)#Renaissance&amp;nbsp;: Mathematical basis|Renaissance perspective]]: [[non-Euclidean geometry]] became a valid alternative.&lt;ref name=Henderson&gt;{{cite book |author=Henderson, Linda D. |title=The Fourth Dimension and Non-Euclidean geometry in Modern Art |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://eres.lndproxy.org/edoc/AH317Antliff-09.pdf |author1=Antliff, Mark |author2=Leighten, Patricia Dee |title=Cubism and Culture |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |year=2001 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Everdell |first=William R. |authorlink=William Everdell |title=The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth-Century Thought |year=1997 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-22480-5 |page=312}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept that painting could be expressed mathematically, in colour and form, contributed to Cubism, the art movement that led to [[abstract art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Green, Christopher |title=Cubism and its Enemies, Modern Movements and Reaction in French Art, 1916–1928 |publisher=Yale University Press |year=1987 |pages=13–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metzinger, in 1910, wrote that: "[Picasso] lays out a free, mobile perspective, from which that ingenious mathematician [[Maurice Princet]] has deduced a whole geometry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Metzinger |first=Jean |authorlink=Jean Metzinger |date=October–November 1910 |title=Note sur la peinture |journal=Pan |page=60}} in {{cite book |last=Miller |title=Einstein, Picasso |publisher=Basic Books |page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Metzinger wrote in his memoirs:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Maurice Princet joined us often&amp;nbsp;... it was as an artist that he conceptualized mathematics, as an aesthetician that he invoked ''n''-dimensional continuums. He loved to get the artists interested in the [[Schlegel diagram|new views on space]] that had been opened up by [[Victor Schlegel|Schlegel]] and some others. He succeeded at that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Metzinger |first=Jean |authorlink=Jean Metzinger |title=Le cubisme était né |year=1972 |publisher=Éditions Présence |pages=43–44}} in {{cite book |last=Ferry |first=Luc |authorlink=Luc Ferry |others=Robert De Loaiza, trans. |title=Homo Aestheticus: The Invention of Taste in the Democratic Age |year=1993 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-24459-8 |page=215}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The impulse to make teaching or research models of mathematical forms naturally creates objects that have symmetries and surprising or pleasing shapes. Some of these have inspired artists such as the [[Dadaism|Dadaists]] [[Man Ray]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Man Ray–Human Equations A Journey from Mathematics to Shakespeare.

[[File:Objet mathematique by Man Ray.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Enneper surface]]s as [[Dadaism]]: [[Man Ray]]'s 1934 ''Objet mathematique'']]
Man Ray photographed some of the mathematical models in the [[Institut Henri Poincaré]] in Paris, including ''Objet mathematique'' (Mathematical object). He noted that this represented [[Enneper surface]]s with constant [[negative curvature]], derived from the [[pseudo-sphere]]. This mathematical foundation was important to him, as it allowed him to deny that the object was "abstract", instead claiming that it was as real as the urinal that Duchamp made into a work of art. Man Ray admitted that the object's [Enneper surface] formula "meant nothing to me, but the forms themselves were as varied and authentic as any in nature." He used his photographs of the mathematical models as figures in his series he did on [[Shakespeare]]'s plays, such as his 1934 painting ''Antony and Cleopatra''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tubbs |first1=Robert |title=Mathematics in 20th-Century Literature and Art |date=2014 |publisher=Johns Hopkins |isbn=978-1-4214-1380-8 |pages=8–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The art reporter Jonathan Keats, writing in ''ForbesLife'', argues that Man Ray photographed "the elliptic paraboloids and conic points in the same sensual light as his pictures of [[Kiki de Montparnasse]]", and "ingeniously repurposes the cool calculations of mathematics to reveal the topology of desire".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Keats |first1=Jonathon |title=See How Man Ray Made Elliptic Paraboloids Erotic At This Phillips Collection Photography Exhibit |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathonkeats/2015/02/13/see-how-man-ray-made-elliptic-paraboloids-sexy-at-this-phillips-collection-photography-exhibit/ |publisher=Forbes |accessdate=10 September 2015 |date=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twentieth century sculptors such as [[Henry Moore]], [[Barbara Hepworth]] and [[Naum Gabo]] took inspiration from mathematical models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gamwell |first1=Lynn |title=Mathematics and Art: A Cultural History |date=2015 |publisher=Princeton University Press |pages=311–312 |isbn=978-0-691-16528-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore wrote of his 1938 ''Stringed Mother and Child'': "Undoubtedly the source of my stringed figures was the [[Science Museum, London|Science Museum]]&amp;nbsp;...

The artists [[Theo van Doesburg]] and [[Piet Mondrian]] founded the [[De Stijl]] movement, which they wanted to "establish a visual vocabulary {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} elementary geometrical forms comprehensible by all and adaptable to any discipline".&lt;ref name=tate&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/d/de-stijl |title=De Stijl |accessdate=11 September 2015 |work=Tate Glossary |publisher=The Tate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Curl |first=James Stevens |title=A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture |year=2006 |edition=Second |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-860678-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of their artworks visibly consist of ruled squares and triangles, sometimes also with circles. De Stijl artists worked in painting, furniture, interior design and architecture.&lt;ref name=tate/&gt; After the breakup of De Stijl, Van Doesburg founded the [[Avant-garde]] [[Art Concret]] movement, describing his 1929–1930 ''[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Theo_van_Doesburg_218.jpg Arithmetic Composition]'', a series of four black squares on the diagonal of a squared background, as "a structure that can be controlled, a ''definite'' surface without chance elements or individual caprice", yet "not lacking in spirit, not lacking the universal and not&amp;nbsp;... empty as there is ''everything'' which fits the internal rhythm". The art critic Gladys Fabre observes that two progressions are at work in the painting, namely the growing black squares and the alternating backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Tubbs, Robert |title=Mathematics in Twentieth-Century Literature and Art: Content, Form, Meaning  |year=2014 |publisher=JHU Press |pages=44–47 |isbn=978-1-4214-1402-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mathematics of [[tessellation]], polyhedra, shaping of space, and self-reference provided the graphic artist [[M. C. Escher]] (1898—1972) with a lifetime's worth of materials for his woodcuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nga.gov/collection/gallery/ggescher/ggescher-main1.html |title=Tour: M.C.

Escher used irregular polygons when tiling the plane and often used reflections, [[glide reflection]]s, and [[Translation (geometry)|translations]] to obtain further patterns. Many of his works contain impossible constructions, made using geometrical objects which set up a contradiction between perspective projection and three dimensions, but are pleasant to the human sight. Escher's ''[[Ascending and Descending]]'' is based on the "[[Penrose stairs|impossible staircase]]" created by the medical scientist [[Lionel Penrose]] and his son the mathematician [[Roger Penrose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Penrose |first1=L.S. |last2=Penrose |first2=R. |title=Impossible objects: A special type of visual illusion |journal=[[British Journal of Psychology]] |year=1958 |volume=49 |pages=31–33 |doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1958.tb00634.x |pmid=13536303}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kirousis |first1=Lefteris M. |last2=Papadimitriou |first2=Christos H. |author2-link=Christos Papadimitriou |title=The complexity of recognizing polyhedral scenes |doi=10.1109/sfcs.1985.59 |pages=175–185 |work=[[Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science|26th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science]] (FOCS 1985) |year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cooper |first=Martin |contribution=Tractability of Drawing Interpretation |doi=10.1007/978-1-84800-229-6_9 |isbn=978-1-84800-229-6 |pages=217–230 |publisher=Springer-Verlag |title=Line Drawing Interpretation |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Escher's many tessellation drawings were inspired by conversations with the mathematician [[H. S. M. Coxeter]] on [[hyperbolic geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Roberts, Siobhan |authorlink=Siobhan Roberts|work=King of Infinite Space: Donald Coxeter, the Man Who Saved Geometry |page=Chapter 11 |title='Coxetering' with M.C. Escher |publisher=Walker |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Escher was especially interested in five specific polyhedra, which appear many times in his work. The [[Platonic solids]]—tetrahedrons, cubes, octahedrons, dodecahedrons, and icosahedrons—are especially prominent in ''Order and Chaos'' and ''Four Regular Solids''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Escher, M.C. |title=The World of MC Escher |publisher=Random House |date=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; These stellated figures often reside within another figure which further distorts the viewing angle and conformation of the polyhedrons and provides a multifaceted perspective artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Escher, M.C. |author2=Vermeulen, M.W. |author3=Ford, K. |title=Escher on Escher: Exploring the Infinite |year=1989 |publisher=HN Abrams}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The visual intricacy of mathematical structures such as tessellations and polyhedra have inspired a variety of mathematical artworks. [[Stewart Coffin]] makes polyhedral puzzles in rare and beautiful woods; [[George W. Hart]] works on the theory of [[polyhedra]] and sculpts objects inspired by them; [[Magnus Wenninger]] makes "especially beautiful" models of [[List of Wenninger polyhedron models|complex stellated polyhedra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Malkevitch |first1=Joseph |title=Mathematics and Art. 5.

The distorted perspectives of [[anamorphosis]] have been explored in art since the sixteenth century, when [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] incorporated a severely distorted skull in his 1533 painting ''[[The Ambassadors (Holbein)|The Ambassadors]]''. Many artists since then, including Escher, have make use of anamorphic tricks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Marcolli, Matilde |authorlink=Matilde Marcolli |title=The notion of Space in Mathematics through the lens of Modern Art |publisher=Century Books |date=July 2016 |url=http://www.its.caltech.edu/~matilde/SpaceMathArticle.pdf |pages=23–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mathematics of [[topology]] has inspired several artists in modern times. The sculptor [[John Robinson (sculptor)|John Robinson]] (1935–2007) created works such as ''Gordian Knot'' and ''Bands of Friendship'', displaying [[knot theory]] in polished bronze.&lt;ref name=Emmer/&gt; Other works by Robinson explore the topology of [[torus]]es.

Modelling is far from the only possible way to illustrate mathematical concepts. Giotto's ''[[Stefaneschi Triptych]]'', 1320, illustrates [[recursion]] in the form of ''[[mise en abyme]]''; the central panel of the triptych contains, lower left, the kneeling figure of Cardinal Stefaneschi, holding up the triptych as an offering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Giotto di Bondone and assistants: Stefaneschi triptych |url=http://mv.vatican.va/3_EN/pages/PIN/PIN_Sala02_03.html |publisher=The Vatican |accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Giorgio Chirico]]'s [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] paintings such as his 1917 ''Great Metaphysical Interior'' explore the question of levels of representation in art by depicting paintings within his paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gamwell |first1=Lynn |title=Mathematics and Art: A Cultural History |date=2015 |publisher=Princeton University Press |pages=337–338 |isbn=978-0-691-16528-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art can exemplify logical paradoxes, as in some paintings by the [[surrealist]] [[René Magritte]], which can be read as [[semiotic]] jokes about confusion between levels. In ''[[The Human Condition (painting)|La condition humaine]]'' (1933), Magritte depicts an easel (on the real canvas), seamlessly supporting a view through a window which is framed by "real" curtains in the painting. Similarly, Escher's ''[[Print Gallery (M. C. Escher)|Print Gallery]]'' (1956) is a print which depicts a distorted city which contains a gallery which [[recursive]]ly contains the picture, and so ''[[ad infinitum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cooper |first1=Jonathan |title=Art and Mathematics |url=http://www.doctordada.com/art/art-and-mathematics/ |accessdate=5 September 2015 |date=5 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magritte made use of spheres and cuboids to distort reality in a different way, painting them alongside an assortment of houses in his 1931 ''Mental Arithmetic'' as if they were children's building blocks, but house-sized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hofstadter |first1=Douglas R. |authorlink=Douglas Hofstadter |title=Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid |titlelink=Gödel, Escher, Bach |date=1980 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-14-028920-6 |page=627}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' observed that the "eerie toytown image" prophesied [[Modernism]]'s usurpation of "cosy traditional forms", but also plays with the human tendency to seek [[patterns in nature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hall |first1=James |title=René Magritte: The Pleasure Principle – exhibition |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/jun/10/rene-magritte-pleasure-principle-exhibition |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=5 September 2015 |date=10 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Salvador Dalí's last painting, ''[[The Swallow's Tail]]'' (1983), was part of a series inspired by [[René Thom]]'s [[catastrophe theory]].&lt;ref name="King"&gt;{{cite book |last1=King |first1=Elliott |editor1-last=Ades |editor1-first=Dawn |title=Dali |date=2004 |publisher=Bompiani Arte |location=Milan |pages=418–421}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish painter and sculptor [[Pablo Palazuelo]] (1916–2007) focused on the investigation of form. He developed a style that he described as the geometry of life and the geometry of all nature. Consisting of simple geometric shapes with detailed patterning and coloring, in works such as ''Angular I'' and ''Automnes'', Palazuelo expressed himself in geometric transformations.&lt;ref name=Emmer/&gt;

Artists, however, do not necessarily take geometry literally. As [[Douglas Hofstadter]] writes in his 1980 reflection on human thought, ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'', by way of (among other things) the mathematics of art: "The difference between an Escher drawing and [[non-Euclidean geometry]] is that in the latter, comprehensible interpretations can be found for the undefined terms, resulting in a comprehensible total system, whereas for the former, the end result is not reconcilable with one's conception of the world, no matter how long one stares at the pictures." Hofstadter discusses the seemingly [[paradox]]ical lithograph ''Print Gallery'' by M. C. Escher; it depicts a seaside town containing an art gallery which seems to contain a painting of the seaside town, there being a "strange loop, or tangled hierarchy" to the levels of reality in the image. The artist himself, Hofstadter observes, is not seen; his reality and his relation to the lithograph are not paradoxical.&lt;ref name=GEB&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hofstadter |first1=Douglas R. |authorlink=Douglas Hofstadter |title=Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid |titlelink=Gödel, Escher, Bach |date=1980 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-394-74502-2 |pages=98–99, 690–717}}&lt;/ref&gt; The image's central void has also attracted the interest of mathematicians Bart de Smit and [[Hendrik Lenstra]], who propose that it could contain a [[Droste effect]] copy of itself, rotated and shrunk; this would be a further illustration of recursion beyond that noted by Hofstadter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=de Smit |first=B. |title=The Mathematical Structure of Escher's Print Gallery |year=2003 |journal=[[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]] |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=446–451}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LenstraWebsite&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lenstra |first1=Hendrik |last2=De Smit |first2=Bart |title=Applying mathematics to Escher's Print Gallery |url=http://escherdroste.math.leidenuniv.nl/index.php?menu=intro |publisher=Leiden University |accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analysis of art history===

Algorithmic analysis of images of artworks, for example using [[X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy]], can reveal information about art. Such techniques can uncover images in layers of paint later covered over by an artist; help art historians to visualize an artwork before it cracked or faded; help to tell a copy from an original, or distinguish the brushstroke style of a master from those of his apprentices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stanek |first1=Becca |title=Van Gogh and the Algorithm: How Math Can Save Art |url=http://time.com/2884058/math-art-van-gogh-duke/ |publisher=Time Magazine |accessdate=4 September 2015 |date=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sipics |first1=Michelle |title=The Van Gogh Project: Art Meets Mathematics in Ongoing International Study |url=https://www.siam.org/news/news.php?id=1568 |publisher=Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics |accessdate=4 September 2015 |date=18 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is highly unlikely, therefore, that Pollock consciously understood the fractals he was painting. Nevertheless, his introduction of fractals was deliberate. For example, the colour of the anchor layer was chosen to produce the sharpest contrast against the canvas background and this layer also occupies more canvas space than the other layers, suggesting that Pollock wanted this highly fractal anchor layer to visually dominate the painting. Furthermore, after the paintings were completed, he would dock the canvas to remove regions near the canvas edge where the pattern density was less uniform. |doi=10.1088/2058-7058/12/10/21 |volume=12 |pages=25–28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Max Ernst painted [[Lissajous figures]] directly by swinging a punctured bucket of paint over a canvas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.herts.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0013/12307/WPIAAD_vol2_king.pdf |title=From Max Ernst to Ernst Mach: epistemology in art and science. |last=King |first=M. |date=2002 |accessdate=17 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The computer scientist [[Neil Dodgson]] investigated whether [[Bridget Riley]]'s stripe paintings could be characterised mathematically, concluding that while separation distance could "provide some characterisation" and global [[entropy]] worked on some paintings, [[autocorrelation]] failed as Riley's patterns were irregular. Local entropy worked best, and correlated well with the description given by the art critic Robert Kudielka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dodgson |first1=N. A. |title=Mathematical characterisation of Bridget Riley's stripe paintings |journal=[[Journal of Mathematics and the Arts]] |date=2012 |volume=5 |pages=1–21 |url=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~nad10/pubs/jma12.pdf |quote=over the course [of] the early 1980s, Riley's patterns moved from more regular to more random (as characterised by global entropy), without losing their rhythmic structure (as characterised by local entropy). This reflects Kudielka's description of her artistic development. |doi=10.1080/17513472.2012.679468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American mathematician [[George Birkhoff]]'s 1933 ''Aesthetic Measure'' proposes a quantitative metric of the [[Aesthetics|aesthetic quality]] of an artwork. It does not attempt to measure the connotations of a work, such as what a painting might mean, but is limited to the "elements of order" of a polygonal figure. Birkhoff first combines (as a sum) five such elements: whether there is a vertical axis of symmetry; whether there is optical equilibrium; how many rotational symmetries it has; how wallpaper-like the figure is; and whether there are unsatisfactory features such as having two vertices too close together. This metric, ''O'', takes a value between −3 and 7. The second metric, ''C'', counts elements of the figure, which for a polygon is the number of different straight lines containing at least one of its sides. Birkhoff then defines his aesthetic measure of an object's beauty as ''O/C''. This can be interpreted as a balance between the pleasure looking at the object gives, and the amount of effort needed to take it in. Birkhoff's proposal has been criticized in various ways, not least for trying to put beauty in a formula, but he never claimed to have done that.&lt;ref name=Cucker116&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felix |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |pages=116–120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stimuli to mathematical research===

[[File:Fraser spiral.svg|thumb|upright|The [[Fraser spiral illusion]], named for Sir James Fraser who discovered it in 1908.]]

[[Optical illusion]]s such as the [[Fraser spiral illusion|Fraser spiral]] strikingly demonstrate limitations in human visual perception, creating what the [[art historian]] [[Ernst Gombrich]] called a "baffling trick." The black and white ropes that appear to form [[spiral]]s are in fact [[concentric circle]]s. The mid-twentieth century [[Op art|Op art or optical art]] style of painting and graphics exploited such effects to create the impression of movement and flashing or vibrating patterns seen in the work of artists such as [[Bridget Riley]]&lt;!--slight overlink seems sensible here--&gt;, Spyros Horemis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felix |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |pages=163–166}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Victor Vasarely]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gamwell |first1=Lynn |title=Mathematics and Art: A Cultural History |date=2015 |publisher=Princeton University Press |pages=406–410 |isbn=978-0-691-16528-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sacred geometry===
{{further information|Sacred geometry|Mathematics and music}}

A strand of art from Ancient Greece onwards sees God as the geometer of the world, and the world's geometry therefore as sacred. The belief that God created the universe according to a geometric plan has ancient origins. [[Plutarch]] attributed the belief to [[Plato]], writing that "Plato said God geometrizes continually" (''Convivialium disputationum'', liber 8,2). This image has influenced Western thought ever since. The Platonic concept derived in its turn from a [[Pythagoras|Pythagorean]] notion of harmony in music, where the notes were spaced in perfect proportions, corresponding to the lengths of the lyre's strings; indeed, the Pythagoreans held that everything was arranged by Number. In the same way, in Platonic thought, the [[Platonic solid|regular or Platonic solids]] dictate the proportions found in nature, and in art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ghyka |first1=Matila |title=The Geometry of Art and Life |date=2003 |publisher=Dover |isbn=978-0-486-23542-4 |pages=ix–xi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lawlor |first1=Robert |title=Sacred Geometry: Philosophy and Practice |date=1982 |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |isbn=978-0-500-81030-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Mediaeval manuscript illustration may refer to a verse in the Old Testament: "When he established the heavens I was there: when he set a compass upon the face of the deep" (Proverbs 8:27), showing God drawing out the universe with a pair of compasses.&lt;ref name=Calter&gt;{{cite web |last1=Calter |first1=Paul |title=Celestial Themes in Art &amp; Architecture |url=https://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/math5.geometry/unit10/unit10.html |publisher=Dartmouth College |accessdate=5 September 2015 |date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1596, the mathematical astronomer [[Johannes Kepler]] modelled the universe as a set of nested Platonic solids, determining the relative sizes of the orbits of the planets.&lt;ref name=Calter/&gt; [[William Blake]]'s ''Ancient of Days'' and his painting of the physicist [[Isaac Newton]], naked and drawing with a compass, attempt to depict the contrast between the mathematically perfect spiritual world and the imperfect physical world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Thought of a Thought – Edgar Allan Poe |url=http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath522/kmath522.htm |publisher=MathPages |accessdate=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as in a different way does [[Salvador Dalí]]'s 1954 ''[[Crucifixion (Corpus Hypercubus)]]'', which depicts the cross as a [[hypercube]], representing the divine perspective with four dimensions rather than the usual three.&lt;ref name=CorpusHypercubus /&gt; In Dali's ''[[The Sacrament of the Last Supper]]'' (1955) Christ and his disciples are pictured inside a giant [[dodecahedron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Livio |first1=Mario |authorlink=Mario Livio |title=The golden ratio and aesthetics |url=https://plus.maths.org/content/golden-ratio-and-aesthetics |accessdate=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Matriarchy''' is a [[social system]] in which females (most notably in mammals) hold the primary power positions in roles of political leadership, [[moral authority]], [[social privilege]] and control of property at the specific exclusion of males — at least to a large degree.

While those definitions apply in general English, definitions specific to the disciplines of [[anthropology]] and [[feminism]] differ in some respects. Most anthropologists hold that there are no known anthropological societies ''that are unambiguously matriarchal'', but some authors believe exceptions may exist or may have.

Matriarchies may also be confused with [[matrilineality|matrilineal]], [[matrilocal residence|matrilocal]], and [[matrifocal family|matrifocal]] societies. A few people consider any non-[[patriarchy|patriarchal]] system to be matriarchal, thus including genderally equalitarian systems ([[Peggy Reeves Sanday]] favors redefining and reintroducing the word matriarchy, especially in reference to contemporary matrilineal societies such as the [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]]&lt;ref&gt;Peggy Reeves Sanday, anthropologist, [http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/?GCOI=80140100164210 Women at the Center: Life in a Modern Matriarchy], [[Cornell University Press]], 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;), but most academics exclude them from matriarchies strictly defined.

In 19th-century Western scholarship, the hypothesis of matriarchy representing an early, mainly prehistoric, stage of human development gained popularity. Possibilities of so-called primitive societies were cited and the hypothesis survived into the 20th century, including in the context of [[second-wave feminism]]. This hypothesis was criticized by some authors such as Cynthia Eller in ''[[The Myth of Matriarchal Prehistory]]'' and remains as a largely unsolved question to this day. Some older myths describe matriarchies.

Several modern feminists have advocated for matriarchy now or in the future and it has appeared in [[List of feminist literature|feminist literature]]. In several theologies, matriarchy has been portrayed as negative.

== Definitions, connotations, and etymology ==
According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (''OED''), matriarchy is a "form of social organization in which the mother or oldest female is the head of the family, and descent and relationship are reckoned through the female line; government or rule by a woman or women."&lt;ref name="OED-matriarchy"&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'' (online), entry ''matriarchy'', as accessed November 3, 2013{{Subscription or libraries}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A popular definition, according to James Peoples and Garrick Bailey, is "female dominance".&lt;ref name="HumanityIntroCulturAnthro-9ed-p259col1"&gt;{{harvp|Peoples|Bailey|2012|p=259}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the academic discipline of [[cultural anthropology]], according to the ''OED'', matriarchy is a "culture or community in which such a system prevails"&lt;ref name="OED-matriarchy" /&gt; or a "family, society, organization, etc., dominated by a woman or women."&lt;ref name="OED-matriarchy" /&gt; In general anthropology, according to William A. Haviland, matriarchy is "rule by women".&lt;ref name="Anthro-Haviland-8ed-p579col1"&gt;Haviland, William A., ''Anthropology'' (Ft. Worth: Harcourt Brace College Publishers, 8th ed. 1997 ({{ISBN|0-15-503578-9}})), p.&amp;nbsp;579.&lt;/ref&gt; A matriarchy is a [[society]] in which females, especially mothers, have the central roles of political leadership, [[moral authority]], and control of property, but does not include a society that occasionally is led by a female for nonmatriarchal reasons or an occupation in which females generally predominate without reference to matriarchy, such as [[prostitution]] or [[auxiliary (fraternal orders)|women's auxiliaries]] of organizations run by men.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} According to Lawrence A. Kuzner in 1997, [[Alfred Radcliffe-Brown|A. R. Radcliffe-Brown]] argued in 1924 that the definitions of matriarchy and patriarchy had "logical and empirical failings&amp;nbsp;.... [and] were too vague to be scientifically useful".&lt;ref&gt;Kuznar, Lawrence A., ''Reclaiming a Scientific Anthropology'' (Walnut Creek, Calif.: AltaMira Press (div. of Sage Publications), pbk. 1997 ({{ISBN|0-7619-9114-X}})).&lt;/ref&gt;

Most academics exclude egalitarian nonpatriarchal systems from matriarchies more strictly defined. According to [[Heide Göttner-Abendroth]], a reluctance to accept the existence of matriarchies might be based on a specific culturally biased notion of how to define matriarchy: because in a [[patriarchy]] men rule over women, a matriarchy has frequently been conceptualized as women ruling over men,&lt;ref name="MatriarchalSocDefTheory"&gt;{{cite web | last = Göttner-Abendroth | first = Heide | author-link = Heide Göttner-Abendroth | title = Matriarchal Society: Definition and Theory | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130419055107/http://www.gift-economy.com/athanor/athanor_005.html | archive-date = 19 April 2013 | url = http://www.gift-economy.com/athanor/athanor_005.html }}&lt;br /&gt;

The word matriarchy, for a society politically led by females, especially mothers, who also control property, is often interpreted to mean the genderal opposite of patriarchy, but it is not an opposite.&lt;ref&gt;Compare, in ''Oxford English Dictionary'' (online), entry patriarchy to entry ''matriarchy'', both as accessed November 3, 2013.{{Subscription or libraries|sentence}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Eller|1995|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;161–162 &amp; 184 &amp; n.&amp;nbsp;84}} (p.&amp;nbsp;184 n.&amp;nbsp;84 probably citing Spretnak, Charlene, ed., ''Politics of Women's Spirituality: Essays on the Rise of Spiritual Power Within the Feminist Movement'' (Garden City, New York: Anchor Books, 1982), p.&amp;nbsp;xiii (Spretnak, Charlene, ''Introduction'')).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Goettner-Abendroth|2009a|pp=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Peoples and Bailey, the view of anthropologist Peggy Reeves Sanday is that matriarchies are not a mirror form of patriarchies but rather that a matriarchy "emphasizes maternal meanings where 'maternal symbols are linked to social practices influencing the lives of both sexes and where women play a central role in these practices{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Peoples|Bailey|2012|pp=258-259}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Margot Adler]] wrote, "literally,&amp;nbsp;... ["''matriarchy''"] means government by mothers, or more broadly, government and power in the hands of women."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Adler|2006|p=193}} (italics so in original)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barbara Love]] and Elizabeth Shanklin wrote, "by 'matriarchy,' we mean a non-alienated society: a society in which women, those who produce the next generation, define motherhood, determine the conditions of motherhood, and determine the environment in which the next generation is reared."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Love|Shanklin|1983|p=275}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Cynthia Eller]], "'matriarchy' can be thought of&amp;nbsp;... as a shorthand description for any society in which women's power is equal or superior to men's and in which the culture centers around values and life events described as 'feminine.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Eller|2000|pp=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eller wrote that the idea of matriarchy mainly rests on two pillars, romanticism and modern social criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Eller|2011}} {{Page needed|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of matriarchy was meant to describe something like a utopia placed in the past in order to legitimate contemporary social criticism.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} With respect to a [[#Paleolithic and Neolithic Ages|prehistoric matriarchal Golden Age]], according to Barbara Epstein, "matriarchy&amp;nbsp;... means a social system organized around matriliny and goddess worship in which women have positions of power."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Epstein|1991|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;173 and see p.&amp;nbsp;172}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Adler, in the Marxist tradition, it usually refers to a pre-class society "where women and men share equally in production and power."&lt;ref name="DrawDnMoon-2006-p194"&gt;{{harvp|Adler|2006|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Adler, "a number of feminists note that few definitions of the word [matriarchy], despite its literal meaning, include any concept of power, and they suggest that centuries of oppression have made it impossible for women to conceive of themselves with such power."&lt;ref name="DrawDnMoon-2006-p194" /&gt;

Matriarchy has often been presented as negative, in contrast to patriarchy as natural and inevitable for society, thus that matriarchy is hopeless. Love and Shanklin wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;When we hear the word "matriarchy", we are conditioned to a number of responses: that matriarchy refers to the past and that matriarchies have never existed; that matriarchy is a hopeless fantasy of female domination, of mothers dominating children, of women being cruel to men. Conditioning us negatively to matriarchy is, of course, in the interests of patriarchs. We are made to feel that patriarchy is natural; we are less likely to question it, and less likely to direct our energies to ending it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Love|Shanklin|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Matriarchal Studies school led by Göttner-Abendroth calls for an even more inclusive redefinition of the term: Göttner-Abendroth defines ''Modern Matriarchal Studies'' as the "investigation and presentation of non-patriarchal societies", effectively defining matriarchy as non-patriarchy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.second-congress-matriarchal-studies.com/goettnerabendroth.html ''Introduction'', in ''Second World Congress on Matriarchal Studies''].&lt;/ref&gt; She has also defined matriarchy as characterized by the sharing of power equally between the two genders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://matriarchy.info/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=143&amp;Itemid=83 DeMott, Tom, ''The Investigator'' (review of Bennholdt-Thomsen, Veronika, Cornelia Giebeler, Brigitte Holzer, &amp; Marina Meneses, ''Juchitán, City of Women'' (Mexico: Consejo Editorial, 1994))], as accessed Feb. 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Diane LeBow, "matriarchal societies are often described as&amp;nbsp;... egalitarian&amp;nbsp;...",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|LeBow|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; although anthropologist Ruby Rohrlich has written of "the centrality of women in an egalitarian society."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rohrlich|1977|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn|[[Feminist anthropology]], an approach to anthropology that tries to reduces male bias in the field}}

Matriarchy is also the public formation in which the woman occupies the ruling position in a family.&lt;ref name="OED-matriarchy" /&gt; For this usage, some scholars now prefer the term matrifocal to matriarchal.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} Some, including [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan|Daniel Moynihan]], claimed that there is a matriarchy among Black families in the [[United States]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dol.gov/dol/aboutdol/history/webid-meynihan.htm Office of Policy Planning and Review (Daniel Patrick Moynihan, principal author), ''The Negro Family: The Case For National Action'' (U.S. Department of Labor, 1965)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140428151006/http://www.dol.gov/dol/aboutdol/history/webid-meynihan.htm |date=April 28, 2014 }}, esp.

Etymologically, it is from [[Latin]] ''māter'' (genitive ''mātris''), "mother" and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἄρχειν ''arkhein'', "to rule".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=matriarchy |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=matriarchy |publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of matriarchy was defined by [[Joseph-François Lafitau]] (1681–1746), who first named it ''ginécocratie''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edvard Westermarck]] (1921), [https://archive.org/details/historyofhumanma03westuoft ''The History of Human Marriage'', Vol. 3], London: Macmillan, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]]'', the earliest known attestation of the word matriarchy is in 1885.&lt;ref name="OED-matriarchy" /&gt; By contrast, [[:wikt:gynecocracy|gynæcocracy]], meaning 'rule of women', has been in use since the 17th century, building on the Greek word {{Lang|grc|γυναικοκρατία}} found in [[Aristotle]] and [[Plutarch]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0058%3Aentry%3D%237148 Liddell, Henry George, &amp; Robert Scott, ''An Intermediate Greek–English Lexicon'', for ''γυναικοκρατία''].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2323035 Liddell, Henry George, &amp; Robert Scott, ''A Greek–English Lexicon'', for ''γυ^ναικο-κρα^τέομαι''].&lt;/ref&gt;

A matriarchy is also sometimes called a ''[[matrifocal family|gynarchy]]'', a ''gynocracy'', a ''gynecocracy'', or a ''[[gynocentric]]'' society, although these terms do not definitionally emphasize motherhood.

Some question whether a queen ruling without a king is sufficient to constitute female government, given the amount of participation of other men in most such governments.

=== Intergenerational relationships ===
Some people who sought evidence for the existence of a matriarchy often mixed matriarchy with anthropological terms and concepts describing specific arrangements in the field of family relationships and the organization of family life, such as matrilineality and matrilocality. These terms refer to intergenerational relationships (as matriarchy may), but do not distinguish between males and females insofar as they apply to specific arrangements for sons as well as daughters from the perspective of their relatives on their mother's side. Accordingly, these concepts do not represent matriarchy as 'power of women over men'.&lt;ref&gt;Ferraro, Gary, Wenda Trevathan, &amp; Janet Levy, ''Anthropology: An Applied Perspective'' (Minneapolis: West Publishing Co., 1992), p.&amp;nbsp;360.{{Verify source|type=title or year|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In our society, women are the center of all things. Nature, we believe, has given women the ability to create; therefore it is only natural that women be in positions of power to protect this function....We traced our clans through women; a child born into the world assumed the clan membership of its mother. Our young women were expected to be physically strong....The young women received formal instruction in traditional planting....Since the Iroquois were absolutely dependent upon the crops they grew, whoever controlled this vital activity wielded great power within our communities. It was our belief that since women were the givers of life they naturally regulated the feeding of our people....In all countries, real wealth stems from the control of land and its resources. Our Iroquois philosophers knew this as well as we knew natural law. To us it made sense for women to control the land since they were far more sensitive to the rhythms of the Mother Earth. We did not own the land but were custodians of it. Our women decided any and all issues involving territory, including where a community was to be built and how land was to be used....In our political system, we mandated full equality. Our leaders were selected by a caucus of women before the appointments were subject to popular review....Our traditional governments are composed of an equal number of men and women. The men are chiefs and the women clan-mothers....As leaders, the women closely monitor the actions of the men and retain the right to veto any law they deem inappropriate....Our women not only hold the reigns of political and economic power, they also have the right to determine all issues involving the taking of human life. Declarations of war had to be approved by the women, while treaties of peace were subject to their deliberations.&lt;ref name="IroquoisCultureCommentary-p53-p55" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== By chronology ===

==== Earliest prehistory and undated ====
The controversy surrounding prehistoric or "primal" matriarchy began in reaction to the book by Bachofen, ''Mother Right: An Investigation of the Religious and Juridical Character of Matriarchy in the Ancient World'', in 1861. Several generations of ethnologists were inspired by his pseudo-evolutionary theory of archaic matriarchy. Following him and [[Jane Ellen Harrison]], several generations of scholars, usually arguing from known myths or oral traditions and examination of Neolithic female cult-figures, suggested that many ancient societies might have been matriarchal, or even that there existed a wide-ranging matriarchal society prior to the ancient cultures of which we are aware. According to Uwe Wesel, Bachofen's myth interpretations have proved to be untenable.&lt;ref&gt;Wesel, Uwe, ''Der Mythos vom Matriarchat.

[[Friedrich Engels]], in 1884, claimed that, in the earliest stages of human social development, there was group marriage and that therefore paternity was disputable, whereas maternity was not, so that a family could be traced only through the female line, and claimed that this was connected with the dominance of women over men or a ''Mutterrecht'', which notion Engels took from Bachofen, who claimed, based on his interpretations of myths, that myths reflected a memory of a time when women dominated over men.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Engels|1984}} {{Page needed|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bachofen, Johann Jakob, ''Das Mutterrecht.

Austrian writer Bertha Diener, also known as Helen Diner, wrote ''Mothers and Amazons'' (1930), which was the first work to focus on women's cultural history. Hers is regarded as a classic of feminist matriarchal study.&lt;ref name="Dinner party"&gt;[http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/dinner_party/heritage_floor/helen_diner.php ''Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art: The Dinner Party: Heritage Floor: Helen Diner'' (Brooklyn, N.Y.: Brooklyn Museum, last updated March 27, 2007)], as accessed March, 2008, &amp; November 15, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Her view is that in the past all human societies were matriarchal; then, at some point, most shifted to patriarchal and degenerated. The controversy was reinforced further by the publication of ''[[The White Goddess]]'' by Robert Graves (1948) and his later analysis of classical Greek mythology and the vestiges of earlier myths that had been rewritten after a profound change in the religion of Greek civilization that occurred within its very early historical times. From the 1950s, Marija Gimbutas developed a theory of an ''[[Old European culture]]'' in Neolithic Europe which had matriarchal traits, replaced by the patriarchal system of the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]] with the spread of [[Indo-European languages]] beginning in the [[Bronze Age]]. According to Epstein, anthropologists in the 20th century said that "the goddess worship or matrilocality that evidently existed in many paleolithic societies was not necessarily associated with matriarchy in the sense of women's power over men. Many societies can be found that exhibit those qualities along with female subordination."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Epstein|1991|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1970s, these ideas were taken up by popular writers of second-wave feminism and expanded with the speculations of [[Margaret Murray]] on [[witchcraft]], by the [[Goddess movement]], and in [[feminist Wicca]], as well as in works by Eisler, [[Elizabeth Gould Davis]], and [[Merlin Stone]].

"A Golden Age of matriarchy" was, according to Epstein, prominently presented by [[Charlene Spretnak]] and "encouraged" by Stone and Eisler,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Epstein|1991|pp=172–173}}&lt;/ref&gt; but, at least for the [[Neolithic]] Age, has been denounced as feminist wishful thinking in ''[[The Inevitability of Patriarchy]]'', ''[[Why Men Rule]]'', ''Goddess Unmasked'',&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Philip G., ''Goddess Unmasked'' (N.Y.: Spence Publishing, 1998 ({{ISBN|0-9653208-9-8}})); [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-54600098.html Sheaffer, R., ''Skeptical Inquirer'' (1999) (review)].&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Myth of Matriarchal Prehistory]]'' and is not emphasized in [[third-wave feminism]]. According to Eller, Gimbutas had a large part in constructing a myth of historical matriarchy by examining [[Eastern Europe]]an cultures that she asserts, by and large, never really bore any resemblance in character to the alleged universal matriarchy suggested by Gimbutas and Graves. She asserts that in "actually documented primitive societies" of recent (historical) times, paternity is never ignored and that the sacred status of goddesses does not automatically increase female social status, and believes that this affirms that utopian matriarchy is simply an inversion of [[antifeminism]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

==== Bronze Age ====
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2013}}
According to Rohrlich, "many scholars are convinced that Crete was a matriarchy, ruled by a queen-priestess"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rohrlich|1977|p=36}} and see p.&amp;nbsp;37 ("Minoan matriarchate" (subquoting, at p.&amp;nbsp;37 n.&amp;nbsp;7, Thomson, George, ''The Prehistoric Aegean'' (N.Y.: Citadel Press, 1965), p.&amp;nbsp;450)), Baruch, Elaine Hoffman, ''Introduction'', in Pt. Four (''Visions of Utopia''), in {{harvp|Rohrlich|Baruch|1984|p=207}} ("matriarchal societies, particularly Minoan Crete"), and {{harvp|Rohrlich|1984|p=6}} ("the Minoan matriarchy" &amp; "Minoan Crete").&lt;/ref&gt; and the "Cretan civilization" was "matriarchal" before "1500 B.C.," when it was overrun and colonized.&lt;ref&gt;Three quotations: {{harvp|Rohrlich|1977|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also according to Rohrlich, "in the early Sumerian city-states 'matriarchy seems to have left something more than a trace.{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rohrlich|1977|p=39}}, quoting Thomson, George, ''The Prehistoric Aegean'' (N.Y.: Citadel Press, 1965), p.&amp;nbsp;160.&lt;/ref&gt;

One common misconception among historians of the Bronze Age such as Stone and Eisler is the notion that the [[ancient Semitic-speaking peoples|Semites]] were matriarchal while the Indo-Europeans practiced a patriarchal system. An example of this view is found in Stone's ''[[When God Was a Woman]]'',{{Page needed|date=July 2013}} wherein she makes the case that the worship of [[Yahweh]] was an Indo-European invention superimposed on an ancient matriarchal Semitic nation. Evidence from the [[Amorites]] and [[pre-Islamic Arabia|pre-Islamic Arabs]], however, indicates that the primitive Semitic family was in fact patriarchal and patrilineal.

However, not all scholars agree. Anthropologist and Biblical scholar Raphael Patai writes in  The Hebrew Goddess that the Jewish religion, far from being pure monotheism, contained from earliest times strong polytheistic elements, chief of which was the cult of Asherah, the mother goddess. A story in the Biblical Book of Judges places the worship of Asherah in the 12th century B.C.E.  Originally a Canaanite goddess, her worship was adopted by Hebrews who intermarried with Canaanites. She was worshipped in public and was represented by carved wooden poles. Numerous small nude female figurines of clay were found all over ancient Palestine and a 7th C. Hebrew text invokes her aid for a woman giving birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvp|Patai|1990|pp=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shekinah is the name of the feminine holy spirit who embodies both divine radiance and compassion. She comforts the sick and dejected, accompanies the Jews whenever they are exiled, and intercedes with God to exercise mercy rather than to inflict retribution on sinners. While not a creation of the Hebrew Bible, Shekinah appears in a slightly later Aramaic translation of the Bible in the first or second century C.E., according to Patai. Initially portrayed as the presence of God, she later becomes distinct from God, taking on more physical attributes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvp|Patai|1990|pp=96–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the Indo-Europeans were known to have practiced multiple succession systems, and there is much better evidence of matrilineal customs among the Indo-European [[Celts]] and [[Germans]] than among any ancient Semitic peoples.

Women were running [[Sparta]] while the men were often away fighting. [[Gorgo, Queen of Sparta]], was asked by a woman in [[Attica]] something along the lines of, "why are Spartan women the only women in the world who could rule men?" Gorgo replied, "Because we are the only women who are mothers of men."{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==== Iron Age to Middle Ages ====
Arising in the period ranging from the [[Iron Age]] to the [[Middle Ages]], several early [[northwestern Europe]]an mythologies from the [[Irish mythology|Irish]] (''e.g.'', [[Macha]] and [[Scáthach]]), the [[Brittonic languages|Brittonic]] (''e.g.'', [[Rhiannon]]), and the Germanic (''e.g.'', [[Grendel's mother]] and [[Nerthus]]) contain ambiguous episodes of primal female power which have been interpreted as folk evidence of a real potential for matriarchal attitudes in [[Iron Age|pre-Christian]] European Iron Age societies. Often transcribed from a retrospective, patriarchal, Romanised, and [[Catholic]] perspective, they hint at an earlier, culturally disturbing, era when female power could have predominated. The first-century–attested historic British figure of [[Boudicca]] indicates that Brittonnic society permitted explicit female autocracy or a form of gender equality in a form which contrasted strongly with the patriarchal structure of Mediterranean civilisation.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

== Mythology ==

=== Amazons ===
A legendary matriarchy related by several writers was [[Amazons|Amazon]] society. According to [[Phyllis Chesler]], "in Amazon societies, women were&amp;nbsp;... mothers and their society's only political and religious leaders",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Chesler|2005|pp=335–336}} (italics omitted).&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the only warriors and hunters;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Chesler|2005|pp=335–336}}&lt;/ref&gt; "queens were elected"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Chesler|2005|p=336}}&lt;/ref&gt; and apparently "any woman could aspire to and achieve full human expression."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Chesler|2005|p=336}} (italics omitted)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herodotus]] reported that the Sarmatians were descendants of Amazons and Scythians, and that their females observed their ancient maternal customs, "frequently hunting on horseback with their husbands; in war taking the field; and wearing the very same dress as the men".{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} Moreover, said Herodotus, "no girl shall wed till she has killed a man in battle".{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} Amazons came to play a role in [[Roman historiography]]. [[Julius Caesar]] spoke of the conquest of large parts of Asia by [[Semiramis]] and the Amazons.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} Although Strabo was sceptical about their historicity, the Amazons were taken as historical throughout [[late Antiquity]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], 5.504.&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[Church Fathers]] spoke of the Amazons as a real people.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} Medieval authors continued a tradition of locating the Amazons in the North, [[Adam of Bremen]] placing them at the [[Baltic Sea]] and [[Paulus Diaconus]] in the heart of Germania.&lt;ref&gt;[[F. A. Ukert|Ukert, F. A.]], ''Die Amazonen'' (Abhandlungen der philosophisch-philologischen Classe der Königlich Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, 1849), 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Greece ===
[[Robert Graves]] suggested that a myth displaced earlier myths that had to change when a major cultural change brought patriarchy to replace a matriarchy.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} According to this myth, in [[Greek mythology]], [[Zeus]] is said to have swallowed his pregnant lover, the titan goddess [[Metis (mythology)|Metis]], who was carrying their daughter, [[Athena]]. The mother and child created havoc inside Zeus. Either [[Hermes]] or [[Hephaestus]] split Zeus's head, allowing Athena, in full battle armor, to burst forth from his forehead. Athena was thus described as being "born" from Zeus. The outcome pleased Zeus as it didn't fulfill the prophecy of Themis which (according to Aeschylus) predicted that Zeus will one day bear a son that would overthrow him. {{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

=== Celtic myth and society ===
{{main|Ancient Celtic women#Matriarchy}}

According to Adler, "there ''is'' plenty of evidence of ancient societies where women held greater power than in many societies today. For example, [[Jean Markale]]'s studies of Celtic societies show that the power of women was reflected not only in myth and legend but in legal codes pertaining to marriage, divorce, property ownership, and the right to rule."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Adler|2006|p=196}} (italics so in original; p.&amp;nbsp;196 n.&amp;nbsp;20 citing Markale, Jean, ''Women of the Celts'' (London: Gordon Cremonesi, 1975)).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South America ===
Bamberger (1974) examines several matriarchal myths from South American cultures and concludes that portraying the women from this matriarchal period as immoral often serves to restrain contemporary women in these societies.{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} &lt;ref&gt;Bamberger, Joan, The Myth of Matriarchy: Why Men Rule in Primitive Society, in M.

In [[first-wave feminism|first-wave feminist]] discourse, either [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] or [[Margaret Fuller]] (it is unclear who was first) introduced the concept of matriarchy&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Donovan|2000|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;55 &amp; n.&amp;nbsp;15}}, citing Stanton, Elizabeth Cady, ''Address'' (Washington Woman's Rights Convention, 1869), in ''History of Woman Suffrage'', vol. 2, pp.&amp;nbsp;351–353.&lt;/ref&gt; and the discourse was joined in by [[Matilda Joslyn Gage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Donovan|2000|p=57}}, citing Gage, Matilda Joslyn, ''Woman, Church and State: A Historical Account of the Status of Women through the Christian Ages; with Reminiscences of the Matriarchate'' (Watertown, Mass.: Persephone Press, 1980 (1893)), p.&amp;nbsp;21.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Victoria Woodhull]], in 1871, called for men to open the U.S. government to women or a new constitution and government would be formed in a year;&lt;ref&gt;''A Lecture on Constitutional Equality'', also known as ''The Great Secession Speech'', speech to Woman's Suffrage Convention, New York, May 11, 1871, excerpt quoted in {{harvp|Gabriel|1998|pp=86–87}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and, on a basis of equality, she ran to be elected President in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gabriel|1998|loc=''passim'', esp. pp.&amp;nbsp;54–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Underhill, Lois Beachy, ''The Woman Who Ran for President: The Many Lives of Victoria Woodhull'' (Bridgehampton, N.Y.: Bridge Works, 1st ed. 1995 ({{ISBN|1-882593-10-3}}), ''passim'', esp. ch.&amp;nbsp;8.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]], in 1911 and 1914,&lt;ref&gt;The dates are those of two original editions of the same work, both cited herein.&lt;/ref&gt; argued for "a woman-centered, or better mother-centered, world"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Donovan|2000|p=61}}, citing {{harvp|Gilman|2001|loc=''passim''}}&lt;/ref&gt; and described {{"'}}government by women{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Donovan|2000|p=62}}, citing {{harvp|Gilman|2001|p=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; She argued that a government led by either sex must be assisted by the other,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gilman|2001|p=177}} and see p.&amp;nbsp;153.&lt;/ref&gt; both genders being "useful&amp;nbsp;... and should in our governments be alike used",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gilman|2001|p=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; because men and women have different qualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gilman|2001|pp=153, 177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cultural feminism]] includes "matriarchal worship", according to Prof. James Penner.&lt;ref&gt;Penner, James, ''Pinks, Pansies, and Punks: The Rhetoric of Masculinity in American Literary Culture'' (Bloomington, Ind.: Indiana University Press, 2011 ({{ISBN|978-0-253-22251-0}})), p.&amp;nbsp;235.&lt;/ref&gt;

For radical feminists, the importance of matriarchy is that "veneration for the female principle&amp;nbsp;... somewhat lightens an oppressive system."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Castro|1990|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Feminist utopia]]s are a form of advocacy.

[one] stem[s] from feminists who emphasize the differences between women and men. They tend to formulate their ideal world in terms of a society where women's positions are better than men's. There are various forms of matriarchy, or even a utopia that resembles the Greek myth of the Amazons.... [V]ery few modern utopias have been developed in which women are absolute autocrats."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Willemsen|1997|p=6}}.

* Adler reported, "if feminists have diverse views on the matriarchies of the past, they also are of several minds on the goals for the future.

Some fiction caricatured the current gender hierarchy by describing a matriarchal alternative without advocating for it.

Diversity within a proposed community can, according to Becki L.

Prof. Christine Stansell, a feminist, wrote that, for feminists to achieve state power, women must democratically cooperate with men. "Women must take their place with a new generation of brothers in a struggle for the world's fortunes. Herland, whether of virtuous matrons or daring sisters, is not an option....

* In [[Protestantism|Protestant Christianity]], considered only historically, in 1558, [[John Knox]] ([[Maria Stuart]]'s subject) wrote ''[[The first blast of the trumpet against the monstruous regiment of women|The First Blast of the Trumpet against the Monstrous Regiment of Women]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|de Abreu|2003|p=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Scalingi, the work is "perhaps the best known analysis of gynecocracy"&lt;ref name="ScepterDistaff-Historian-p60" /&gt; and Knox was "the most notorious"&lt;ref name="ScepterDistaff-Historian-p60" /&gt; writer on the subject.&lt;ref name="ScepterDistaff-Historian-p60" /&gt; According to an 1878 edition, Knox's objection to any women reigning and having "empire"{{efn|"I am assured that God hath reueled to some in this our age, that it is more then a monstre in nature, that a woman shall reigne and haue empire aboue man."&lt;ref name="1stBlast-Gutenberg-ebk"&gt;{{harvp|Knox|1878}} (italicization and boldface, if any, removed).&lt;/ref&gt;}} over men was theological&lt;ref name="Knox_1878"&gt;{{harvp|Knox|1878}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was against nature for women to bear rule, superiority, dominion, or empire above any realm, nation, or city.{{efn|"To promote a woman to beare rule, superioritie, dominion or empire aboue any realme, nation, or citie, is repugnant to nature, contumelie to God, a thing most contrarious to his reueled will and approued ordinance, and finallie it is the subuersion of good order, of all equitie and iustice[.]"&lt;ref name="Knox_1878"/&gt;}} Susan M. Felch said that Knox's argument was partly grounded on a statement of the [[Paul the Apostle|apostle Paul]] against women teaching or usurping authority over men.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Felch|1995|p=806}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Maria Zina Gonçalves de Abreu, Knox argued that a woman being a national ruler was unnatural&lt;ref name="Abreu_169"&gt;{{harvp|de Abreu|2003|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that women were unfit and ineligible for the post.&lt;ref name="Abreu_169"/&gt; Kathryn M. Brammall said Knox "considered the rule of female monarchs to be anathema to good government"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Brammall|1996|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that Knox "also attacked those who obeyed or supported female leaders",&lt;ref name="MonstrousMetamorphosis-16CJ-p20"&gt;{{harvp|Brammall|1996|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; including men.&lt;ref name="MonstrousMetamorphosis-16CJ-p20" /&gt; Robert M. Healey said that Knox objected to women's rule even if men accepted it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Healey|1994|p=376}}&lt;/ref&gt; On whether Knox personally endorsed what he wrote, according to Felch, [[Jasper Ridley]], in 1968, argued that even Knox may not have personally believed his stated position but may have merely pandered to popular sentiment,&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, Jasper, ''John Knox'' (N.Y.: Oxford University Press, 1968), p.&amp;nbsp;267, as cited in {{harvp|Felch|1995|p=805}}&lt;/ref&gt; itself a point disputed by [[W. Stanford Reid]].&lt;ref&gt;Reid, W. Stanford, ''Trumpeter of God: A Biography of John Knox'' (N.Y.: Scribner, 1974), p.&amp;nbsp;145, as cited in {{harvp|Felch|1995|p=805}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the popularity of Knox's views, Patricia-Ann Lee said Knox's "fierce attack on the legitimacy of female rule&amp;nbsp;... [was one in which] he said&amp;nbsp;... little that was unacceptable&amp;nbsp;... to most of his contemporaries",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lee|1990|p=242}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Judith M. Richards disagreed on whether the acceptance was quite so widespread.&lt;ref name="PromoteWBeareRule-16CJ-p116-n45n46"&gt;{{harvp|Richards|1997|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to David Laing's ''Preface'' to Knox's work, Knox's views were agreed with by some people at the time, the ''Preface'' saying, "[Knox's] views were in harmony with those of his colleagues&amp;nbsp;... [Goodman, Whittingham, and Gilby]".&lt;ref&gt;Laing, David, ''Preface'' (from extract), in {{harvp|Knox|1878}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in agreement with Knox was [[Christopher Goodman]], who, according to Lee, "considered the woman ruler to be a monster in nature, and used&amp;nbsp;... scriptural argument to prove that females were barred&amp;nbsp;... from any political power",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lee|1990|pp=250, 249}}, citing Goodman, Christopher, ''How Superior Powers Ought to be Obeyd'' (N.Y.: reprint, 1931, originally 1558) (chap. on gynecocracy).&lt;/ref&gt; even if, according to Richards, the woman was "virtuous".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Richards|1997|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some views included conditionality; while [[John Calvin]] said, according to Healey, "that government by a woman was a deviation from the original and proper order of nature, and therefore among the punishments humanity incurred for original sin",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Healey|1994|pp=372, 373}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn|[[Original sin]], in Christianity, a state of sin, or violation of God's will, due to Adam's rebellion in the Garden of Eden}} nonetheless Calvin would not always question a woman's right to inherit rule of a realm or principality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Healey|1994|pp=372–373}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heinrich Bullinger]], according to Healey, "held that rule by a woman was contrary to God's law but cautioned against [always] using that reason to oppose such rule".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Healey|1994|p=373}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Richards, Bullinger said women were normally not to rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Richards|1997|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1560, Calvin, in disagreeing with Knox, argued that the existence of the few women who were exceptions showed that theological ground existed for their exceptionalism.&lt;ref&gt;"There were occasionally women so endowed, that the singular good qualities which shone forth in them made it evident that they were raised up by Divine authority". Calvin, letter to William Cecil (on or after January 29, 1559 (probably 1560)), in {{harvp|Knox|1878}} (citing, at ''Preface'', n.&amp;nbsp;1, for letter, ''Zurich Letters'' (2d ser.), p.&amp;nbsp;35) (Calvin reviser, ''Commentaries on Isaiah'' (sometime in 1551–1559) (approximate title)).&lt;/ref&gt; Knox's view was much debated in Europe at the time,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|de Abreu|2003|pp=168, 170–171}}, ''e.g.'', citing Aylmer (AElmer&lt;!-- "A" &amp; "E" separate letters --&gt;), John, ''An Harborowe for Faithfull and Trewe Subiects agaynst the late blowne Blast, concerninge the Gouernment of Wemen wherin be confuted all such reasons as a straunger of late made in that behalfe, with a briefe exhortation to obedience'' (1559).&lt;/ref&gt; the issue considered complicated by laws such as on inheritance&lt;ref name="PromoteWBeareRule-16CJ-p116-n45n46" /&gt; and since several women were already in office, including as Queens, according to de Abreu.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|de Abreu|2003|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knox's view is not said to be widely held in modern Protestantism among leadership or laity.

=== Inclusionary ===
{{Main|thealogy|Goddess movement}}
Feminist [[thealogy]], according to Eller, conceptualized humanity as beginning with "female-ruled or equalitarian societies",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Eller|1991|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;281 and see pp.&amp;nbsp;282 &amp; 287}}&lt;/ref&gt; until displaced by patriarchies,&lt;ref name="RelativizingPatriarchy-p281"&gt;{{harvp|Eller|1991|p=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that in the millennial future {{"'}}gynocentric,' life-loving values"&lt;ref name="RelativizingPatriarchy-p281" /&gt; will return to prominence.&lt;ref name="RelativizingPatriarchy-p281" /&gt; This, according to Eller, produces "a virtually infinite number of years of female equality or superiority coming both at the beginning and end of historical time".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Eller|1991|p=282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among criticisms is that a future matriarchy, according to Eller, as a reflection of spirituality, is conceived as ahistorical,&lt;ref name="RelativizingPatriarchy-p291n27"/&gt; and thus may be unrealistic, unreachable, or even meaningless as a goal to secular feminists.

== In popular culture ==

=== Ancient theatre ===
* Apparently as criticism, about 2,400 years ago, in 390 BC, [[Aristophanes]] wrote a play, ''[[Assemblywomen|Ecclesiazusae]]'', about women gaining legislative power and governing [[Athens]], Greece, on a limited principle of equality. In the play, according to Mansfield, Praxagora, a character, argues that women should rule because they are superior to men, not equal, and yet she declines to assert publicly her right to rule, although elected and although acting in office.&lt;ref name="Manliness-p73-74-n"&gt;{{harvp|Mansfield|2006|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;73–74 &amp; n.&amp;nbsp;37}}, citing Strauss, Leo, ''Socrates and Aristophanes'' (N.Y.: Basic Books, 1966), ch.&amp;nbsp;9, and Saxonhouse, Arlene W., ''Fear of Diversity'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1992), ch.&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;/ref&gt; The play, Mansfield wrote, also suggests that women would rule by not allowing politics, in order to prevent disappointment, and that affirmative action would be applied to heterosexual relationships.&lt;ref name="Manliness-p73-74-n" /&gt; In the play, as Mansfield described it, written when Athens was a male-only democracy where women could not vote or rule, women were presented as unassertive and unrealistic, and thus not qualified to govern.&lt;ref name="Manliness-p73-74-n" /&gt; The play, according to Sarah Ruden, was a fable on the theme that women should stay home.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ruden|2010|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{genetic genealogy}}
In [[biology]] and [[genealogy]], the '''most recent common ancestor''' ('''MRCA''', also '''''last common ancestor''''' ('''LCA'''), or '''''concestor'''''&lt;ref&gt;MRCA is now more frequently for  common ancestors of subgroups within a species, and LCA for the common ancestor between two species.{{cn|date=October 2016}} The term "concestor" (coined by Nicky Warren) is used by [[Richard Dawkins]] in  ''[[The Ancestor's Tale]]'' (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;) of any set of [[organism]]s is the most recent individual from which all the organisms are directly [[Common descent|descended]]. The term is also used in reference to  the ancestry of groups of [[gene]]s ([[haplotype]]s) rather than organisms.

The MRCA of a set of individuals can sometimes be determined by referring to an established [[pedigree chart|pedigree]]. However, in general, it is impossible to identify the exact MRCA of a large set of individuals, but an estimate of the time at which the MRCA lived can often be given. Such ''time to most recent common ancestor'' (''TMRCA'') estimates can be given based on DNA test results and established [[mutation rate]]s as practiced in [[genetic genealogy]], or by reference to a non-genetic, [[mathematical model]] or computer simulation.  

In organisms using [[sexual reproduction]], the ''matrilinear MRCA'' and ''patrilinear MRCA'' are the MRCAs of a given population considering only [[matrilineal]] and [[patrilineal]] descent, respectively. The MRCA of a population by definition cannot be older than either its matrilinear or its patrilinear MRCA.
In the case of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', the matrilinear  and patrilinear MRCA are also known as "[[Mitochondrial Eve]]" (mt-MRCA)  and "[[Y-chromosomal Adam]]" (Y-MRCA) respectively.

The age of the human MRCA is unknown. It is necessarily younger than the age of both Y-MRCA and mt-MRCA, estimated at around 200,000 years.

The [[Last Universal Common Ancestor]] (LUCA) is the most recent common ancestor of all current life on Earth, estimated to have lived some 3.5 to 3.8 billion years ago (in the [[Paleoarchean]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Doolittle WF |title=Uprooting the tree of life |journal=Scientific American |volume=282 |issue=2 |pages=90–95 |date=February 2000  |pmid=10710791 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0200-90|bibcode=2000SciAm.282b..90D }}.

The composition of the LUCA is not directly accessible as a fossil, but can be studied by [[phylogenetic bracketing|comparing the genomes of its descendents]], organisms living today. By this means, a 2016 study identified a set of 355 [[gene|genes]] inferred to have been present in the LUCA.

==MRCA of different species==
{{see|Chimp-human last common ancestor|Last universal ancestor|Phylogenetic tree|Tree of life (biology)}}
{{PhylomapA|size=300px|caption=[[Phylogenetic tree|Evolutionary tree]] showing the divergence of modern species from the [[last universal ancestor]] in the center.&lt;ref name=Ciccarelli&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ciccarelli FD, Doerks T, von Mering C, Creevey CJ, Snel B, Bork P |title=Toward automatic reconstruction of a highly resolved tree of life |journal=Science |volume=311 |issue=5765 |pages=1283–87 |year=2006 |pmid=16513982 |doi=10.1126/science.1123061 |bibcode=2006Sci...311.1283C|last2=Doerks |last3=von Mering |last4=Creevey |last5=Snel |last6=Bork }}&lt;/ref&gt; The three [[Domain (biology)|domains]] are colored, with [[bacteria]] blue, [[archaea]] green, and [[eukaryote]]s red.}}

The project of a complete description of the phylogeny of biological species is dubbed the "[[Tree of life (biology)|Tree of Life]]". This involves time estimates of all known [[speciation]] events; for example, the MRCA of all [[Carnivora]] (i.e. the MRCA of "[[cat]]s and [[dog]]s") is estimated to have lived of the order of 42 million years ago ([[Miacidae]]).&lt;ref name="Eizirik, E. 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Eizirik | first1 = E. | last2 = Murphy | first2 = W.J. | last3 = Koepfli | first3 = K.P. | last4 = Johnson | first4 = W.E. | last5 = Dragoo | first5 = J.W. | last6 = O'Brien | first6 = S.J. | year = 2010 | title = Pattern and timing of the diversification of the mammalian order Carnivora inferred from multiple nuclear gene sequences | url = | journal = Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution | volume = 56 | issue = | pages = 49–63 | doi = 10.1016/j.ympev.2010.01.033 | pmid=20138220}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The concept of the last common ancestor from the perspective of [[human evolution]] is described for a popular audience in ''[[The Ancestor's Tale]]'' by [[Richard Dawkins]] (2004). Dawkins lists "concestors" of the [[Timeline of human evolution|human lineage]] in order of increasing age, including [[Chimp-human last common ancestor|hominin]] (human-[[chimpanzee]]), [[Homininae|hominine]] (human-[[gorilla]]), [[hominid]] (human-[[orangutan]]), [[Gibbon–human last common ancestor|hominoid]] (human-[[gibbon]]), and so on in 40 stages in total, down to the [[last universal ancestor]] (human-[[bacteria]]).

==MRCA of a population identified by a single genetic marker==
{{Main|Coalescent theory}}
It is also possible to consider the ancestry of individual [[gene]]s (or groups of genes, [[haplotype]]s) instead of an organism as a whole. 
[[Coalescent theory]] describes a stochastic model of how the ancestry of such genetic markers maps to the history of a population.

Unlike organisms, a gene is passed down from a generation of organisms to the next generation either as perfect replicas of itself or as slightly mutated ''descendant genes''. While organisms have ancestry graphs and progeny graphs via [[sexual reproduction]], a gene has a single chain of ancestors and a tree of descendants. An organism produced by sexual cross-fertilization ([[allogamy]]) has at least two ancestors (its immediate parents), but a gene always has one ancestor per generation.

==Patrilineal and matrilineal MRCA==
{{Main|Mitochondrial Eve|Y-chromosomal Adam}}
[[File:MtDNA-MRCA-generations-Evolution.svg|thumb|left|200px|Through [[Genetic drift|random drift]] or selection, lineage will trace back to a single person. In this example over 5 generations, the colors represent extinct matrilineal lines and black the matrilineal line descended from the mt-MRCA.]]

[[Mitochondrial DNA]] (mtDNA) is nearly immune to sexual mixing, unlike the [[nuclear DNA]] whose chromosomes are shuffled and recombined in [[Mendelian inheritance]]. Mitochondrial DNA, therefore, can be used to trace [[matrilineal|matrilineal inheritance]] and to find the [[Mitochondrial Eve]] (also known as the ''African Eve''), the most recent common ancestor of all humans via the mitochondrial DNA pathway.

Likewise, [[Y chromosome]] is present as a single sex chromosome in the male individual and is passed on to male descendants without recombination. It can be used to trace [[Patrilineality|patrilineal]] inheritance and to find the [[Y-chromosomal Adam]], the most recent common ancestor of all humans via the Y-DNA pathway.

Mitochondrial Eve and Y-chromosomal Adam have been established by researchers using [[genealogical DNA test]]s. Mitochondrial Eve is estimated to have lived about 200,000 years ago. A paper published in March 2013 determined that, with [[95% confidence interval|95% confidence]] and that provided there are no [[systematic error]]s in the study's data, Y-chromosomal Adam lived between 237,000 and 581,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

It is more complicated to infer human ancestry via [[autosomal chromosome]]s. Although an autosomal chromosome contains genes that are passed down from parents to children via [[independent assortment]] from only one of the two parents, [[genetic recombination]] ([[chromosomal crossover]]) mixes genes from non-sister [[chromatids]] from both parents during [[meiosis]], thus changing the genetic composition of the chromosome.

== Time to MRCA estimates ==
Different types of MRCAs are estimated to have lived at different times in the past. These ''time to MRCA'' (''TMRCA'') estimates are also computed differently depending on the type of MRCA being considered. Patrilineal and matrilineal MRCAs (Mitochondrial Eve and Y-chromosomal Adam) are traced by single gene markers, thus their TMRCA are computed based on DNA test results and established mutation rates as practiced in genetic genealogy. Time to genealogical MRCA of all living humans is computed based on non-genetic, mathematical models and computer simulations.

Since Mitochondrial Eve and Y-chromosomal Adam are traced by single genes via a single ancestral parent line, the time to these genetic MRCAs will necessarily be greater than that for the genealogical MRCA. This is because single genes will coalesce more slowly than tracing of conventional human genealogy via both parents. The latter considers only individual humans, without taking into account whether any gene from the computed MRCA actually survives in every single person in the current population.&lt;ref name=chang_1999&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1239/aap/1029955256 | last=Chang | first=Joseph T. | title=Recent common ancestors of all present-day individuals | journal=Advances in Applied Probability | volume=31 | issue=4 | pages=1002–26, discussion and author's reply, 1027–38 | year=1999 | url=http://www.stat.yale.edu/~jtc5/papers/Ancestors.pdf | accessdate=2008-01-29 |ref=harv | last2=Donnelly | first2=Peter | last3=Wiuf | first3=Carsten | last4=Hein | first4=Jotun | last5=Slatkin | first5=Montgomery | last6=Ewens | first6=W.

=== TMRCA via genetic markers ===
Mitochondrial DNA can be used to trace the ancestry of a set of populations. In this case, populations are defined by the accumulation of mutations on the mtDNA, and special trees are created for the mutations and the order in which they occurred in each population. The tree is formed through the testing of a large number of individuals all over the world for the presence or lack of a certain set of mutations. Once this is done it is possible to determine how many mutations separate one population from another. The number of mutations, together with estimated mutation rate of the mtDNA in the regions tested, allows scientists to determine the approximate time to MRCA (''TMRCA'') which indicates time passed since the populations last shared the same set of mutations or belonged to the same [[haplogroup]].

In the case of Y-Chromosomal DNA, TMRCA is arrived at in a different way. [[Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup|Y-DNA haplogroups]] are defined by [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]] in various regions of the Y-DNA. The time to MRCA within a haplogroup is defined by the accumulation of mutations in [[Short tandem repeat|STR]] sequences of the Y-Chromosome of that haplogroup only. Y-DNA network analysis of [[Y-STR]] [[haplotypes]] showing a non-star cluster indicates Y-STR variability due to multiple founding individuals. Analysis yielding a star cluster can be regarded as representing a population descended from a single ancestor. In this case the variability of the [[Y-STR]] sequence, also called the [[Microsatellite (genetics)|microsatellite]] variation, can be regarded as a measure of the time passed since the ancestor founded this particular population. The [[Descent from Genghis Khan|descendants of Genghis Khan]] or one of his ancestors represents a famous star cluster that can be dated back to the time of Genghis Khan.&lt;ref&gt;Tatiana Zerjal (2003), The Genetic Legacy of the Mongols, {{cite web |url=http://web.unife.it/progetti/genetica/Giorgio/PDFfiles/ajhg2003.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120710225619/http://web.unife.it/progetti/genetica/Giorgio/PDFfiles/ajhg2003.pdf |archivedate=2012-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

TMRCA calculations are considered critical evidence when attempting to determine migration dates of various populations as they spread around the world. For example, if a mutation is deemed to have occurred 30,000 years ago, then this mutation should be found amongst all populations that diverged after this date. If archeological evidence indicates cultural spread and formation of regionally isolated populations then this must be reflected in the isolation of subsequent genetic mutations in this region. If genetic divergence and regional divergence coincide it can be concluded that the observed divergence is due to migration as evidenced by the archaeological record. However, if the date of genetic divergence occurs at a different time than the archaeological record, then scientists will have to look at alternate archaeological evidence to explain the genetic divergence. The issue is best illustrated in the debate surrounding the [[demic diffusion]] versus [[cultural diffusion]] during the [[Neolithic Europe|European Neolithic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Morelli L, Contu D, Santoni F, Whalen MB, Francalacci P |title=A Comparison of Y-Chromosome Variation in Sardinia and Anatolia Is More Consistent with Cultural Rather than Demic Diffusion of Agriculture |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=5 |pages=e10419 |year=2010 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0010419 |url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0010419 |pmid=20454687 |pmc=2861676|bibcode = 2010PLoSO...510419M |editor1-last=Lalueza-Fox |editor1-first=Carles |issue=4 |last2=Contu |last3=Santoni |last4=Whalen |last5=Francalacci |last6=Cucca |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== TMRCA of all living humans ===
The age of the MRCA of [[world population|all living humans]] is unknown. It is necessarily younger than the age of either the matrilinear or the patrilinear MRCA, both of which have an estimated age of between roughly 100,000 and 200,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Poznik GD, Henn BM, Yee MC, Sliwerska E, Euskirchen GM, Lin AA, Snyder M, Quintana-Murci L, Kidd JM, Underhill PA, Bustamante CD (August 2013). "Sequencing Y chromosomes resolves discrepancy in time to common ancestor of males versus females". Science. 341 (6145): 562–65. {{doi|10.1126/science.1237619}}. {{PMID|23908239}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A mathematical, but non-genealogical study by mathematicians Joseph T. Chang, Douglas Rhode and Steve Olson calculated that the MRCA lived remarkably recently, possibly as recently as 300 BCE. This model took into account that people do not truly mate randomly, but that, particularly in the past, people almost always mated with people who lived nearby, and usually with people who lived in their own town or village. It would have been especially rare to mate with somebody who lived in another country. However, Chang et al found that a rare person who mates with a person far away will in time connect the worldwide family tree, and that no population is truly completely isolated.   &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://steveolson.com/uploads/2009/04/nature-common-ancestors2.pdf|author=Rohde DL, Olson S, Chang JT |title=Modelling the recent common ancestry of all living humans |journal=Nature |volume=431 |issue=7008 |pages=562–66 |date=September 2004 |pmid=15457259 |doi=10.1038/nature02842 |bibcode = 2004Natur.431..562R |last2=Olson |last3=Chang }} calculate an age of 3,000 to 7,000 years based on a non-genetic, mathematical model that assumes [[panmixia|random mating]], although it has taken into account important aspects of human population substructure such as [[assortative mating]] and historical geographical constraints on interbreeding. This range is consistent with the age of 3,100 years calculated for the MRCA of the [[JC virus]], an ubiquitous human polyomavirus usually transmitted from parents to children by L. A. Shackelton et al., "JC Virus Evolution and Its Association with Human Populations" Journal of Virology, Vol. 80, No. 20 (Oct. 2006),   {{doi|10.1128/JVI.00441-06}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The MRCA of all humans almost certainly lived in East Asia, which would have given them key access to extremely isolated populations in Australia and the Americas. Possible locations for the MRCA include places such as the Chuckchi and Kamchatka Peninsulas that are close to Alaska, places such as Indonesia and Malaysia that are close to Australia or a place such as Taiwan or Japan that is more intermediate to Australia and the Americas.  European colonization of the Americas and Australia was found by Chang to be too recent to have had a substantial impact on the age of the MRCA. In fact, if the Americas and Australia had never been discovered, the MRCA would only be about 2.3% further back in the past than it is. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/01/AR2006070100463.html&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://tedlab.mit.edu/~dr/Papers/Rohde-MRCA-two.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that the age of the MRCA of a population does not correspond to a [[population bottleneck]], let alone a "first couple". It rather reflects the presence of a single individual with high reproductive success in the past, whose genetic contribution has become pervasive throughout the population over time. 
It is also incorrect to assume that the MRCA passed all, or indeed any, genetic information to every living person. Through [[sexual reproduction]], an ancestor passes half of his or her genes to each descendant in the next generation; after more than 32 generations the contribution of a single ancestor would be on the order of 2&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt;, a number proportional to less than a single basepair within the [[human genome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Zhaxybayeva, Olga |author2=Lapierre, Pascal |author3=Gogarten, J.

== Identical ancestors point ==
{{Main|Identical ancestors point}}
The MRCA is the most recent ''common'' ancestor shared by all individuals in the population under consideration. This MRCA may well have contemporaries who are also ancestral to some but not all of the extant population. The ''[[identical ancestors point]]'' is a point in the past more remote than the MRCA at which time there are no longer organisms which are ancestral to some but not all of the modern population.

[[File:PHearstMugShot 19 September 1975.jpg|thumb|right|Police mugshot of [[Patty Hearst]] taken at the San Mateo County Jail, September 18, 1975]]

A '''mug shot''' or '''mugshot''' (an informal term for '''police photograph''' or '''booking photograph''') is a [[Portrait photography|photographic portrait]] of a person from the waist up, typically taken after a person is [[arrest]]ed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/mugshot?q=mugshot |title=mugshot |publisher=Dictionary.cambridge.org |date=2013-10-29 |accessdate=2013-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=147|title=Handbook of Illinois Evidence|author=Michael H. Graham|isbn=978-0-7355-4499-4|publisher=[[Aspen Publishers]]|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original purpose of the mug shot was to allow [[law enforcement]] to have a photographic record of an arrested individual to allow for identification purposes by victims, the public and investigators. However, in the [[United States]], entrepreneurs have recently begun to exploit the mug shot for commercial gains via the [[mug shot publishing industry]].

Photographing of criminals began in the 1840s only a few years after the invention of [[photography]], but it was not until 1888 that French police officer [[Alphonse Bertillon]] standardized the process.

==Etymology==
"Mug" is an English slang term for "[[face]]", dating from the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etymonline.com/?term=mug |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mug shot can more loosely mean any small picture of a face used for any reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mug+shot |title=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2013-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Bertillon selfportrait.jpg|thumb|350px|Self-portrait mug shot of [[Alphonse Bertillon]], who developed and standardized this type of photograph, 22 August 1900]]
A typical mug shot is two-part, with one side-view photo, and one front-view. The background is usually stark and simple, to avoid distraction from the facial image (as distinguished from a casual snapshot in a more naturalistic setting). Mug shots may be compiled into a [[mug book]] in order to determine the identity of a criminal. In high-profile cases, mug shots may also be published in the [[mass media]].

The earliest photos of prisoners taken for use by law enforcement may have been taken in Belgium in 1843 and 1844.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news

The [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency]] began using these on [[wanted poster]]s in the United States. By the 1870s the agency had amassed the largest collection of mug shots in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=26|author=Julie K.

The paired arrangement may have been inspired by the 1865 prison portraits taken by [[Alexander Gardner (photographer)|Alexander Gardner]] of accused conspirators in the [[Abraham Lincoln assassination|Lincoln assassination trial]], though Gardner's photographs were full-body portraits with only the heads turned for the profile shots.

After the defeat of the [[Paris Commune]] in 1871, the [[Prefecture of Police of Paris]] hired a photographer, [[Eugène Appert]], to take portraits of convicted prisoners. In 1888, [[Alphonse Bertillon]] invented the modern mug shot featuring full face and profile views, standardizing the lighting and angles.

The arrested person is sometimes required to hold a placard with name, date of birth, booking ID, weight, and other relevant information on it. With digital photography, the digital photograph is linked to a [[database]] record concerning the arrest.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==Use in wanted posters==
[[File:WantedJohnAnglin.jpg|thumb|FBI wanted poster with a mug shot of Alcatraz escapee [[John Anglin (criminal)|John Anglin]]]]
Mug shots have often been incorporated into [[wanted posters]], including those for the [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives]] list.

==Online mug shot publishing==
{{Main article|Mug shot publishing industry}}
In the US in the early 21st century an online industry developed around the publication and removal of mug shots from internet websites.

==Prejudicial nature==
The US legal system has long held that mug shots can have a negative effect on juries. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] held "The double-shot picture, with front and profile shots alongside each other, is so familiar, from 'wanted' posters in the post office, motion pictures and television, that the inference that the person involved has a criminal record, or has at least been in trouble with the police, is natural, perhaps automatic."&lt;ref&gt;''Barnes v. United States'', 124 U.S.App.D.C. 318, 365 F.2d 509, 510--11 (1966)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Handbook of Massachusetts Evidence says "Because of the risk of prejudice to the defendant inherent in the admission of photographs of the 'mug shot' variety, judges and prosecutors are required to 'use reasonable means to avoid calling the jury's attention to the source of such photographs used to identify the defendant.' " (p.&amp;nbsp;617) Elsewhere it cites a ruling in ''Commonwealth v. Martin'' that "admission of a defendant's mug shot is 'laden for characterizing the defendant as a careerist in crime{{' "}}.

Other states have similar rules.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Vjs3QomgEhwC&amp;pg=PA146&amp;lpg=PA146&amp;dq=mugshot+shown+to+jury&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WY6tNfG33d&amp;sig=urmPMN0Z7hYSgjZzpHsbPjJHAOo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=U3-KSoTyEqCvtgfo4tkg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false "Where admitted, to the extent possible, the mug shots should be taped over or cut to delete all reference to booking information and be undated. The photographs should not be referred to as either "mug shots" or "booking photographs.""] ''Handbook of Illinois Evidence,'' Michael H. Graham, §401.8 (citations omitted)&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''mug book''' is a collection of photographs of criminals, typically in [[mug shot]]s taken at the time of an arrest.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1768">A '''mutual recognition agreement''' ('''MRA''') is an international agreement by which two or more countries agree to recognize one another's [[conformity assessment]]s.
A '''mutual recognition arrangement''' is an international arrangement based on such an agreement.

MRAs have become increasingly common since the formation of the [[World Trade Organization]] in 1995.  They have been forged within and among various [[trade bloc]]s, including [[APEC]] and the [[European Union]].

MRAs are most commonly applied to goods, such as various [[quality control]] MRAs.  However, the term is sometimes applied to agreements on the recognition of professional qualifications as well.

Accreditation Bodies, under the [[International Accreditation Forum]] use the term ''Multilateral Recognition Agreements'' in a similar sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=MLA Purpose |url=https://www.iaf.nu/articles/Purpose/15 |website=IAF |accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nanjing Massacre}}
'''Nanking Massacre denial''' is the denial that [[Imperial Japan]]ese forces [[Nanking massacre|murdered hundreds of thousands of Chinese soldiers and civilians]] during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], a highly controversial episode in [[Sino-Japanese relations]]. Some historians accept the findings of the [[Tokyo tribunal]] with respect to the scope and nature of the atrocities committed by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] after the [[Battle of Nanking]], others do not accept. In Japan, however, there has been a debate over the extent and nature of the [[Rape of Nanking|massacre]]. Relations between Japan and China have been complicated as a result, as denial of the massacre is seen in China as part of an overall unwillingness on Japan's part to admit and apologize for its aggression, or a perceived insensitivity regarding the killings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=I'm Sorry?|series=NewsHour with Jim Lehrer|airdate=1998-12-01|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/asia/july-dec98/china_12-1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates of the death toll vary widely, ranging from 40,000 to 200,000.&lt;ref name="Bob Tadashi Wakabayashi 2008 p. 362"&gt;Bob Tadashi Wakabayashi, ed. (2008). The Nanking Atrocity, 1937-38: Complicating the Picture. Berghahn Books. p. 362. {{ISBN|1845451805}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="James Leibold 2008"&gt;James Leibold (November 2008). "Picking at the Wound: Nanjing, 1937-38". Electronic Journal of Contemporary Japanese Studies.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some scholars, notably the revisionists in Japan,  have contended that the actual death toll is far lower, or even that the event was entirely fabricated and never occurred at all.&lt;ref name="Fogel, Joshua A. 2000, page 46-8"&gt;Fogel, Joshua A. ''The Nanjing Massacre in History and Historiography''. 2000, page 46-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dillon, Dana R. 2007, pp. 9"&gt;Dillon, Dana R. ''The China Challenge''. 2007, pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt; These revisionist accounts of the killings have become a staple of [[Japanese nationalist]] discourse.&lt;ref name="Yoshida157-158"&gt;Yoshida, pp. 157–158&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Japanese journalists and social scientists, such as [[Tomio Hora]] and [[Katsuichi Honda]], have played prominent roles in countering such historiography, in the decades since the killings. Nonetheless, denialist accounts, such as those of [[Shūdō Higashinakano]], have often created controversy in the global media, particularly in China and other East Asian nations.&lt;ref name="Yoshida157-158" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gall"&gt;Gallicchio, Marc S. ''The Unpredictability of the Past''. 2007, page 158&lt;/ref&gt; Coverage of the massacre [[Japanese history textbook controversies|in Japanese school textbooks]] also troubles [[Sino-Japanese relations]], as in some textbooks, the massacre is only briefly mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/file/kasahara.pdf |title=Reconciling Narratives of the Nanjing Massacre in Japanese and Chinese Textbooks |publisher=Tsuru Bunka University |first=Tokushi |last=Kasahara}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National identity==
Takashi Yoshida asserts that, "Nanjing has figured in the attempts of all three nations [China, Japan and the United States] to preserve and redefine national and ethnic pride and identity, assuming different kinds of significance based on each country's changing internal and external enemies."&lt;ref name="Yoshida"&gt;Yoshida, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
In Japan, interpretation of the Nanking Massacre is a reflection upon the Japanese national identity and notions of "pride, honor and shame." Takashi Yoshida describes the Japanese debate over the Nanjing Incident as "crystalliz[ing] a much larger conflict over what should constitute the ideal perception of the nation: Japan, as a nation, acknowledges its past and apologizes for its wartime wrongdoings; or... stands firm against foreign pressures and teaches Japanese youth about the benevolent and courageous martyrs who fought a just war to save Asia from Western aggression."&lt;ref&gt;Yoshida&lt;/ref&gt; In some nationalist circles in Japan, speaking of a large-scale massacre at Nanjing is regarded as {{" '}}[[Japan bashing]]' (in the case of foreigners) or 'self-flagellation' (in the case of Japanese)."&lt;ref name="Askew"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Electronic journal of contemporary Japanese studies |date=2002-04-04 |title=The Nanjing Incident – Recent Research and Trends |first=David |last=Askew |accessdate=2009-03-24 |url=http://www.japanesestudies.org.uk/articles/Askew.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
David Askew characterizes the Nanjing Incident as having "emerged as a fundamental keystone in the construction of the modern Chinese national identity." According to Askew, "a refusal to accept the "orthodox" position on Nanjing can be construed as an attempt to deny the Chinese nation a legitimate voice in international society".&lt;ref name=Askew /&gt;

==Issues of definition==

The precise definition of the geographical area, duration of the massacre, as well as the definition of who was a victim to be considered for counting deaths in the massacre forms a major part of both the definition of the massacre and in the arguments of denialists.  Among the most extreme denialists, such as Tanaka Masaaki, revisionist claims of several dozen or several hundred are claimed,&lt;ref&gt;Masaaki Tanaka claims that very few civilians were killed, and that the massacre is in fact a fabrication in his book ''[http://www.ne.jp/asahi/unko/tamezou/nankin/whatreally/ "Nankin gyakusatsu" no kyokÙ] (The "Nanking Massacre" as Fabrication)''.&lt;/ref&gt; while figures within the range of 50,000-300,000 is typically articulated among mainstream historians.&lt;ref name="Bob Tadashi Wakabayashi 2008 p. 362"/&gt;&lt;ref name="James Leibold 2008"/&gt;

The common revisionist viewpoint, made by denialists such as Higashinakano Shudo is that the geographical area of the incident should be limited to the few square kilometers of the city, and they typically estimate the population to be about 200,000-250,000.&lt;ref&gt;Tanaka, Masaaki. What Really Happened in Nanking: The Refutation of a Common Myth. Tokyo: Sekai Shuppan, 2000. Print. p.16-17&lt;/ref&gt; However, this geographic definition is almost universally unheard of outside of revisionist circles. Their use of 200,000-250,000 civilians is also only includes those in the Nanking safety zone, which does not include everyone inside of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20001115084700/http://www.japanecho.co.jp/docs/html/250413.html|title=The Nanking Atrocities: Fact and Fable|last=Hata|first=Ikuhiko|date=1998|website=japanecho.co.jp|archive-url=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most historians include a much larger area around the city, including the Xiaguan district (the [[suburb]]s north of Nanjing city, about 31&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in size) and other areas on the outskirts of the city. Zhang Lianhong estimated the population of greater Nanjing was between 535,000 and 635,000 civilians and soldiers just prior to the Japanese occupation back in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Data Challenges Japanese Theory on Nanjing Population Size |url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/2003/Dec/83437.htm |accessdate=2006-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 he revised his estimate to 468,000-568,000.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20151222192905/http://www.sjhistory.org/site/newxh/yjzt1-3mb_a2008022321792.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians also include six counties around Nanjing, known as the Nanjing Special Municipality.  With the six surrounding counties included, the population of Nanjing is estimated to be more than 1 million.&lt;ref name="TokushiKasahara"&gt;Historian [[Tokushi Kasahara]] states "more than 100,000 and close to 200,000, or maybe more", referring to his own book ''Nankin jiken'' Iwanami shinsho (FUJIWARA Akira (editor) ''Nankin jiken o dou miruka'' 1998 Aoki shoten, {{ISBN|4-250-98016-2}}, p. 18). This estimation includes the surrounding area outside of the city of Nanking, which is objected by a Chinese researcher (the same book, p. 146). Hiroshi Yoshida concludes "more than 200,000" in his book (''Nankin jiken o dou miruka'' p. 123, YOSHIDA Hiroshi ''Tennou no guntai to Nankin jiken'' 1998 Aoki shoten, {{ISBN|4-250-98019-7}}, p. 160). Professor Tomio Hora at Waseda University in Tokyo writes 50,000–100,000 (TANAKA Masaaki [http://www.sdh-fact.com/ ''What Really Happened in Nanking''] 2000 Sekai Shuppan, Inc. {{ISBN|4-916079-07-8}}, p. 5).&lt;/ref&gt;

The duration of the incident is naturally defined by its geography: the earlier the Japanese entered the area, the longer the duration. The [[Battle of Nanjing|Battle of Nanking]] ended on December 13, when the divisions of the Japanese Army entered the walled city of Nanking. The Tokyo War Crime Tribunal defined the period of the massacre to the ensuing six weeks. More conservative estimates say the massacre started on December 14, when the troops entered the Safety Zone, and that it lasted for six weeks.

Most scholars have accepted figures between 50,000-300,000 dead as an approximate total.&lt;ref name="Bob Tadashi Wakabayashi 2008 p. 362"/&gt;&lt;ref name="James Leibold 2008"/&gt; Revisionists in Japan, however have contended at times that the actual death toll is far lower, or even that the event was entirely fabricated and never occurred at all.&lt;ref name="Fogel, Joshua A. 2000, page 46-8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dillon, Dana R. 2007, pp. 9"/&gt;

==History and censorship during the War==

{{See also|Censorship in the Empire of Japan}}

During the war, Japanese media and newspapers typically portrayed a positive view of the war in China.  Reports on the massacre were generally muted, and newspaper reports and photos typically emphasized cooperation between Chinese civilians and Japanese soldiers.  Massacre denialists claim that the news published in the Japanese media and newspapers were "true" and "reliable" stories.  However, most mainstream historians counter that it is well known that the '' Naikaku Jōhōkyoku'' (''Cabinet Information Bureau''), a consortium of military, politicians and professionals created in 1936 as a "committee" and upgraded to a "division" in 1937, applied censorship of all the media of the Shōwa regime and that this office held a policing authoring over the realm of publishing.&lt;ref name=Earhart&gt;David C. Earhart, ''Certain Victory : Images of World War II in the Japanese Media'', M.E. Sharpe, 2007, p.89, 108, 143&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the '' Naikaku Jōhōkyoku'''s activities were proscriptive as well as prescriptive. Besides issuing detailed guidelines to publishers, it made suggestions that were all but commands.&lt;ref name=Earhart /&gt; From 1938, printed medias "would come to realize that their survival depended upon taking cues from the Cabinet Information Bureau and its flagship publication, ''Shashin shūhō'', designers of the "look" of the soldier, and the "look" of the war."&lt;ref&gt;David C. Earhart, ''Certain Victory : Images of World War II in the Japanese Media'', M.E. Sharpe, 2007, p.99&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 12 of the censorship guideline for newspapers issued on September 1937 stated that any news article or photograph "unfavorable" to the Imperial Army was subject to a gag. Article 14 prohibited any "photographs of atrocities" but endorsed reports about the "cruelty of the Chinese" soldiers and civilians.&lt;ref&gt;Shinichi Kusamori, ''Fukyoka Shashi Ron: Hūkoku no Shashi 2'' (An Essay on Disapproved Photographs: Journalistic Photos on Japan 2), Mainichi Shinbun Hizū Fukyoka Shashin 2, Mainichi Shinbun 1999, p.177-178&lt;/ref&gt;

Owing to the censorship, none of the hundred Japanese reporters in Nanking when the city was captured wrote anything unfavorable to their countrymen. In 1956, however, Masatake Imai, correspondent for the ''Tokyo Asahi'' who reported only about the "majestic and soul-stirring ceremony" of the triumphal entry of the Imperial Army, revealed he witnessed a mass execution of 400 to 500 Chinese men near ''Tokyo Asahi''{{'}}s office. "I wish I could write about it", he told his colleague Nakamura. "Someday, we will, but not for the time being. But we sure saw it", Nakamure answered.&lt;ref&gt;Masatake Imai, ''Nankin Shinai no Tairyo Satsujin'' (Mass Murders in the City of Nanking), ''Mokugekisha ga Kataru Showashi 5: Nichi Chu Senso'' (Showa History told by Witnesses), Shin Jinbutsu Orai, 1989, p. 49-58.&lt;/ref&gt;
Shigeharu Matsumoto, the Shanghai bureau Chief of ''Domei'' News Agency, wrote that the Japanese reporters he interviewed all told him they saw between 2,000 and 3,000 corpses around the Xiaguan area and a reporter, Yuji Maeda, saw recruits executing Chinese prisoners-of-war with bayonets.&lt;ref&gt;Shigeharu Matsumoto, ''Shanghai Jidai: Journalist no Kaiso'' (The Shanghai Age: A Journalist's Memoirs), Cho Koron 1975, p.251-252.&lt;/ref&gt;
Jiro Suzuki, a correspondent for the ''Tokyo Nichi Nichi'', wrote, "When I went back to the Zhongshan Gate, I saw for the first time an unearthly, brutal massacre. On the top of the wall, about 25 meters high, the prisoners of war were rounded up in a line. They were being stabbed by bayonets and shoved away off the wall. A number of Japanese soldiers polished their bayonets, shouted to themselves once and thrust their bayonets in the chest or back of POWs."&lt;ref&gt;Yutaka Yoshida, ''Tenno no Guntai to Nankin Jiken'' (The Emperor's Military and the Nankin Incident), Aoki Shoten, 1986, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Tokushi Kasahara notes, "Some deniers argue that Nanjing was much more peaceful than we generally think. They always show some photographs with Nanjing refugees selling some food in the streets or Chinese people smiling in the camps. They are forgetting about Japanese propaganda. The Imperial Army imposed strict censorship. Any photographs with dead bodies couldn't get through. So photographers had to remove all the bodies before taking pictures of streets and buildings in the city (...) Even if the photos were not staged, the refugees had no choice but to fawn on the Japanese soldiers. Acting otherwise meant their deaths..."&lt;ref name="at1"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Nanjing Massacre, Psychological Warfare: I Chinese Propaganda|url=http://thenanjingmassacre.org/2015/07/04/chinese-propaganda/ |work=www.thenanjingmassacre.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revived international interest in the Nanking Massacre===

[[Iris Chang]]'s 1997 book, ''[[The Rape of Nanking (book)|The Rape of Nanking]]'', renewed global interest in the Nanking Massacre. The book sold more than half a million copies when it was first published in the US, and according to ''[[The New York Times]]'', received general critical acclaim.&lt;ref name="NewYorkTimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irischang.net/press_article.cfm?n=1|title=History's Shadow Foils Nanking Chronicle|publisher=The New York Times (article hosted by IrisChang.net)|date=1999-05-20|accessdate=2007-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' wrote that it was the "first comprehensive examination of the destruction of this Chinese imperial city", and that Chang "skillfully excavated from oblivion the terrible events that took place". ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' wrote that it was a "compelling account of a horrendous episode that, until recently, has been largely forgotten."&lt;ref name="MediaPraise"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irischang.net/press_article.cfm?n=14|title=Media Praise For The Rape of Nanking|publisher=IrisChang.net|accessdate=2007-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The text, however, was not without controversy. Chang's account drew on new sources to break new ground in the study of the period. Japanese ultra-nationalists maintained that the Nanking Massacre was a fabrication which sought "to demonize the Japanese race, culture, history, and nation."&lt;ref name="yosh"&gt;Takashi Yoshida. ''The making of the "Rape of Nanking"''. 2006, page 146&lt;/ref&gt;

===Massacre affirmation vs. massacre denial===

Takashi Hoshiyama characterizes opinion in Japan about the Nanking Massacre as "broadly divided into two schools of thought: the massacre affirmation school, which asserts that a large-scale massacre took place, and the massacre denial school, which asserts that, a certain number of isolated aberrations aside, no massacre took place."&lt;ref name=Hoshiyama&gt;{{cite web |last=Hoshiyama |first=Takashi |title=The Split Personality of the Nanking Massacre |url=http://www.iips.org/bp330e.pdf |date=November 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101104617/http://www.iips.org/bp330e.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hijacking of the debate by layperson activists===

David Askew asserts that the debate over the Nanking Massacre has been hijacked by "two large groups of layperson activists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Ritsumeikan International Affairs |volume=2 |pages=63–78 |year=2004 |title=The Contested Past: History and Semantics in the Nanjing Debate |first=David |last=Askew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Chinese" are turned into a single, homogenised voice and portrayed as sinister and manipulative twisters of the truth, while the similarly homogenized "Japanese" are portrayed as uniquely evil, as cruel and blood-thirsty beyond redemption, and as deniers of widely accepted historical truths.

Both positions are victimisation narratives. One depicts the Chinese as helpless victims of brutal Japanese imperialism in the winter of 1937–38, while the other depicts the gullible Japanese, innocent in the ways of the world, as victims of Chinese machinations and propaganda in the post-war era.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Japanese perspectives on the massacre===

Japanese affirmationists not only accept the validity of these tribunals and their findings, but also assert that Japan must stop denying the past and come to terms with Japan's responsibility for the war of aggression against its Asian neighbors. Affirmationists have drawn the attention of the Japanese public to atrocities committed by the Japanese Army during World War II in general and the Nanking Massacre in particular in support of an anti-war agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/hgs/dcn003 |first=Matthew |last=Penney |title=Far from Oblivion: The Nanking Massacre in Japanese Historical Writing for Children and Young Adults |journal=Holocaust and Genocide Studies |year=2008 |volume=22 |pages=25–48 | issue=1 |pmid=20681109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most extreme denialists, by and large, reject the findings of the tribunals as a kind of "[[victor's justice]]" in which only the winning side's version of events are accepted.  Described within Japan as the Illusion School (''maboroshi-ha''), they deny the massacre and argue that only a few POWs and civilians were killed by the Japanese military in Nanjing.  More moderate denialists argue that between several thousand and 38,000–42,000 were massacred.&lt;ref name=Askew /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hata Ikuhiko 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prominent Japanese denialists==

[[File:Chinese to be beheaded in Nanking Massacre.jpg| thumb | left | upright | A Chinese POW about to be beheaded by a Japanese officer with a [[shin gunto]] during the Nanking Massacre.]]

===Shudo Higashinakano===
Massacre denialists such as Higashinakano argue that the "Nanking Massacre" was a fabrication and war-time propaganda spread by the Chinese Nationalists and Communists. He argues that the activities of the Japanese military in Nanking were in accordance with international law and were humane.&lt;ref name=Hev&gt;Higashinakano (2005) pp. 219–223&lt;/ref&gt;  Among other claims, he has denied that there was execution of POWs in uniform,&lt;ref name=Hev/&gt; and cited anecdotes claiming that Chinese POWs were treated humanely by Japanese soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Higashinakano (2003) p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Higashinakano has also claimed at times that the executed POWs were illegitimate combatants, and so their execution was legitimate under international law.  Higashinakano believes some several thousand 'illegitimate combatants' may have been executed in such a fashion.&lt;ref name="Hev"/&gt;

What Higashinakano believed is against the articles of [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907]], which was ratified by Japan and China. Japan violated the spirits and the statements of [[laws of war]].
For examples, according to historian Akira Fujiwara, on August 6, 1937, deputy minister of Military of Japan  notified of Japanese Troops in Shanghai that the army's proposition to remove the constraints of international law on the treatment of Chinese prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;Fujiwara, ''Nitchû Sensô ni Okeru Horyo Gyakusatsu, Kikan Sensô Sekinin Kenkyû'' 9, 1995, p.22&lt;/ref&gt; This directive also advised staff officers to stop using the term "[[prisoner of war]]".  During the massacre, Japanese troops in fact embarked on a determined search for former soldiers, in which thousands of young men were captured, most of whom were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Fujiwara | first = Akira | year = 1995 | title = Nitchû Sensô ni Okeru Horyotoshido Gyakusatsu | journal = Kikan Sensô Sekinin Kenkyû | volume = 9 |issue= | page = 22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In another case, Japanese troops gathered 1,300 Chinese soldiers and civilians at the Taiping Gate and killed them. The victims were blown up with landmines, then doused with petrol before being set on fire.  Those that were left alive afterward were killed with bayonets.&lt;ref name="Taiping"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7140357.stm | title = Nanjing remembers massacre victims | publisher = BBC News | date = 2007-12-13 | accessdate=2007-12-13 | first = Michael | last = Bristow}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[F. Tillman Durdin]] and [[Archibald Steele]], American news correspondents, reported that they had seen bodies of killed Chinese soldiers forming mounds six feet high at the Nanking Yijiang gate in the north. Durdin, who was working for the [[New York Times]], made a tour of Nanking before his departure from the city. He heard waves of machine-gun fire and witnessed the Japanese soldiers gun down some two hundred Chinese within ten minutes. Two days later, in his report to the ''New York Times'', he stated that the alleys and street were filled with civilian bodies, including women and children.

A claim that [[Harold Timperley]], whose report formed the basis of the Tribunal's findings, was reporting only hearsay, and that thus, the figure of 300,000 dead was "unreal" drew a response from Bob Tadashi Wakabayashi, who suggested that Higashinakano's assertions and conclusion were not "sensible":

&lt;blockquote&gt;Higashinakano jumps to this conclusion in all earnestness because he clings to a hypothetical fixation that the Atrocity never happened. This forces him to seize any shred of evidence, whether sound or not, to sustain and systematize that delusion.&lt;ref&gt;Wakabayashi, Bob Tadashi. ''The Nanking atrocity, 1937-38: complicating the picture''. 2007, page 327&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Higashinakano has also at times denied the occurrence of mass rape on the part of Japanese troops, at times ascribing it to Chinese soldiers, and at other times simply denying its occurrence.  The occurrence of rape during the massacre is testified to by John Rabe, elected leader of the Nanjing Safety Zone, who writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Two Japanese soldiers have climbed over the garden wall and are about to break into our house. When I appear they give the excuse that they saw two Chinese soldiers climb over the wall. When I show them my party badge, they return the same way. In one of the houses in the narrow street behind my garden wall, a woman was raped, and then wounded in the neck with a bayonet. I managed to get an ambulance so we can take her to Kulou Hospital. (...) Last night up to 1,000 women and girls are said to have been raped, about 100 girls at Ginling College Girls alone. You hear nothing but rape. If husbands or brothers intervene, they're shot. What you hear and see on all sides is the brutality and bestiality of the Japanese soldiers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John E. |last=Woods |title=The Good man of Nanking, the Diaries of John Rabe |year=1998 |page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Minnie Vautrin]], a professor at Ginling College, wrote in her diary on that day, "Oh God, control the cruel beastliness of the Japanese soldiers in Nanking tonight..," and on the 19th, "In my wrath, I wished I had the power to smite them for their dastardly work. How ashamed women of Japan would be if they knew these tales of horror."&lt;ref&gt;Hua-ling Hu, ''[[American Goddess at the Rape of Nanking: The Courage of Minnie Vautrin]]'', 2000, p.90, 95 96&lt;/ref&gt;

Vautrin also wrote in her diary that she had to go to the Japanese embassy repeatedly from December 18 to January 13 to get proclamations to prohibit Japanese soldiers from committing crimes at Ginling because the soldiers tore the documents up before taking women away.

Xia Shuqin, a woman testifying that she had been a massacre victim sued Higashinakano for defamation, for a claim made in a book written in 1998 that the murder of her family had been performed by Chinese, rather than Japanese soldiers.  On 5 February 2009, the Japanese Supreme Court ordered Higashinakano and the publisher, ''Tendensha'', to pay 4 million yen in damages to Mrs. Xia.  According to the court, Higashinakano failed to prove that she and the girl were different persons, and that she was not a witness of the Nanking massacre, as Higashinakano had claimed in his book.&lt;ref&gt;''Chinese hail Nanjing massacre witness' libel suite victory'', [http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90776/90883/6587967.html], ''Author on Nanjing loses libel appeal'', [http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20090207b2.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Masaaki Tanaka===
In his book "The Fabrication of the 'Nanjing Massacre', Masaaki Tanaka argues that there was no indiscriminate killing at all in Nanjing and that the massacre was a fabrication manufactured by the [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East]] (IMTFE) and the Chinese government for the purpose of propaganda.  He has in addition argued that the Tokyo Tribunal was 'victor's justice' and not a fair trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Nanjing Massacre in History and Historiography |editor=Joshua A.

Tanaka has also argued the claim that many civilians were killed by the Chinese military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= http://www.history.gr.jp/~nanking/rabe.html |author= Tanaka, Masaaki |title= Kodansha-kan "Nankin no Shinjitsu" wa Shinjitsu dehanai ("The Truth of Nanking" is not true) |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150924030505/http://www.history.gr.jp/~nanking/rabe.html |archivedate= 2015-09-24 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These claims have come under heavy fire both within and outside Japan.

'''Nordic Classicism''' was a [[Architectural style|style of architecture]] that briefly blossomed in the [[Nordic countries]] ([[Sweden]], [[Denmark]], [[Norway]] and [[Finland]]) between 1910 and 1930.

Until a resurgence of interest for the period during the 1980s (marked by several scholarly studies and public exhibitions), Nordic Classicism was regarded as a mere interlude between two far more well-known architectural movements, [[National Romantic Style|National Romanticism]], or ''[[Jugendstil]]'' (often seen as equivalent or parallel to [[Art Nouveau]]), and [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalism]] (aka [[Modernist architecture|Modernism]]).

== History ==
[[File:Københavns Politigård under construction.jpg|thumb|[[Copenhagen Police Headquarters]] (1924) by [[Hack Kampmann]].]]
The development of Nordic Classicism was no isolated phenomenon, but took off from [[Classical architecture|classical]] traditions already existing in the Nordic countries, and from new ideas being pursued in German-speaking cultures. Nordic Classicism can thus be characterised as a combination of direct and indirect influences from [[vernacular]] architecture (Nordic, Italian and German) and [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassicism]], but also the early stirrings of Modernism from the [[Deutscher Werkbund]] – especially their exhibition of 1914 - and by the mid-1920s the ''Esprit Nouveau'' emerging from the theories of [[Le Corbusier]].

The modernist influence went beyond mere aesthetics: [[urbanisation]] tied to modern building techniques and the introduction of regulations both in building and [[town planning]], and moreover, to the rise of social forces that resulted in a change in political ideology toward the Left, resulting in the [[Nordic welfare state]], and new programmes for public buildings such as hospitals (e.g. the [[Beckomberga Hospital]] in western [[Stockholm]] (1927-1935) by [[Carl Westman]]) and schools (e.g. the Fridhemsplan school, Stockholm, (1925–27) by Georg A. Nilsson). But while Nordic classicism was employed for a number of important public buildings, it was also applied as a model for low-cost housing (e.g. the [[Käpylä|Puu-Käpylä]] Garden Town, Helsinki (1920–25) by Martti Välikangas) and domestic architecture in general (e.g. an affordable sense of style for the nouveau-riche).

1930 is usually considered the end point of Nordic Classicism because that was the year of the [[Stockholm Exhibition (1930)|Stockholm Exhibition]], designed mostly by [[Gunnar Asplund]] and [[Sigurd Lewerentz]], when a more purist Modernism was unveiled as a model for a modern society. However, key buildings continued to be built in the classical style after that, notably Östberg's Maritime Museum in Stockholm (1931–34).

== Notable architects ==
[[File:Parliament building Finland.jpg|thumb|[[Eduskuntatalo|Parliament of Finland]], Helsinki (1926-1931) by [[Johan Sigfrid Sirén]]]]
[[File:Rathaus Haugesund.jpg|thumb|right|Haugesund City Hall (1922-1931) by [[Gudolf Blakstad]] and [[Herman Munthe-Kaas]]]]

Certain architects had reached the culmination of their careers already when the [[National Romantic style]] came, but their latter works were in the Nordic Classicism style (e.g. [[Carl Westman]]), the career of others culminated with Nordic Classicism (e.g. [[Ivar Tengbom]] and [[Ragnar Östberg]]), while others later went on to achieve far greater significance as Modernist architects (e.g. [[Arne Jacobsen]], [[Alvar Aalto]], and [[Sven Markelius]]). The two figures who achieved greatest significance in both periods, however, were Swedish architects [[Gunnar Asplund]] and [[Sigurd Lewerentz]].

'''[[Architecture of Denmark|Denmark]]''': [[Kay Fisker]], [[Hack Kampmann]], [[Kaj Gottlob]], [[Ivar Bentsen]], [[Povl Baumann]], [[Poul Holsøe]], [[Edvard Thomsen]], [[Thomas Havning]], [[Holger Jacobsen]], [[Kaare Klint]], [[Arne Jacobsen]], [[Carl Petersen (architect)|Carl Petersen]], [[Aage Rafn]], [[Steen Eiler Rasmussen]], [[Sven Risom]], and [[Frits Schlegel]].

'''[[Architecture of Finland|Finland]]''': [[Gunnar Taucher]], [[Uno Ullberg]], [[Martti Välikangas]], [[J.S. Sirén]], [[Alvar Aalto]], [[Pauli E. Blomstedt]], [[Elsi Borg]], [[Erik Bryggman]], [[Hilding Ekelund]], [[Heikki Siikonen]], and [[Oiva Kallio]].

'''[[Architecture of Norway|Norway]]''': [[Lars Backer]], [[Lorentz Ree]], [[Sverre Pedersen]], [[Nicolai Beer]], [[Finn Berner]], [[Harald Hals]], [[Herman Munthe-Kaas]], [[Gudolf Blakstad]], [[Finn Bryn]], [[Jens Dunker]] and [[Johan Ellefsen]].

'''[[Architecture of Sweden|Sweden]]''': [[Ragnar Östberg]], [[Gunnar Asplund]], [[Carl Westman]], [[Sigurd Lewerentz]], [[Carl Bergsten]], [[Sigfrid Ericson]], [[Torben Grut]], [[Ragnar Hjorth]], [[Cyrillus Johansson]], [[Erik Lallerstedt]], [[Gunnar Leche]], [[Sven Markelius]], [[Gunnar Morssing]], [[George Nilsson]], [[Ture Ryberg]], [[Albin Stark]], [[Eskil Sundahl]], [[Lars Israel Wahlman]], [[Sven Wallander]], [[Hakon Ahlberg]] and [[Ivar Tengbom]].

Though these architects are listed by country, during this period there was an intense cultural exchange among the Nordic countries (many architects worked in more than one), but also considerable development in the architect's sphere of activity, from consultant to the bourgeoisie to town planner concerned with infrastructure, dwelling and public services. As Swedish historian Henrik O. Anderson (1982: 23), has put it, this was an architecture of democracy, not radical [[avant-garde|avant-gardism]]. Furthermore, with the exception of Finland, the other Nordic countries had avoided getting involved in the [[World War I|First World War]], allowing for continued cultural development.

== Relationship to other movements ==

Interest in Nordic Classicism, especially in its most classical form, arose in the late 1970s and early 1980s at the height of [[postmodern architecture|postmodernism]] when critics, historians and architecture teachers were looking for historical precedents for the architecture of such architects as [[Michael Graves]], [[Leon Krier]] and [[Robert A. M. Stern|Robert Stern]]. Nordic classicism provided that precedent, especially with such seminal buildings as Gunnar Asplund's Scandia Cinema in Stockholm (1924), Listers District Courthouse (1917–21), Villa Snellman in [[Djursholm]] (1917–18) and [[Stockholm Public Library]] (1920-28), as well as the landscape and buildings of the [[Skogskyrkogården]] Cemetery, Stockholm (1917-1940) by both Asplund and Sigurd Lewerentz.

In regards to architectural style, there were several precedents or reasons which account for the rise of Nordic Classicism. First was the existing classical tradition, borne from the architecture of [[Absolute monarchy|Absolutism]] &amp;ndash; that is, the classical architectural symbols of power of the Swedish and Danish monarchies &amp;ndash; down to the vernacular, for instance in terms of considerations for symmetry, detailing and proportion.

Throughout the 19th century there were a number of factors contributing to a more simplified classicism. The teachings of [[Jean-Nicolas-Louis Durand|J.N.L. Durand]] at the [[École Polytechnique]] of Paris at the beginning of the 19th century had attempted to rationalise the language and building techniques of classicism, while allowing for simple additive compositions. Durand's teachings spread, entering German culture in the form of Romantic Classicism with the work of [[Friedrich Gilly]] and [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]]. Scholars were at the time uncovering the remnants of [[Pompeii]], and discovering the use of bright colour in Roman architecture – an aspect that had more or less been forgotten in the [[Renaissance]], but also rediscovering Greece and Egypt. These aspects were incorporated into Neoclassicism and continued into Nordic Classicism (e.g. The [[Thorvaldsen Museum]], [[Copenhagen]], 1839–48, by M.G. Bindesbøll, incorporates Egyptian motifs as does Asplund's Stockholm Public Library).

There are also 'circles of reaction' to consider. Art Nouveau and National Romanticism had little impact in Denmark, while in Sweden, Norway and Finland there were also strong National Romantic reactions. Neoclassicism had arrived in Finland via [[Saint Petersburg]] as a universal language but by the end of the 19th century came to represent an alien presence – that of [[Russia]]. Thus when stirrings of political independence appeared in Finland and  Norway, a rugged, national romantic architecture – a local variation of Art Nouveau – playing on the nationalistic myths, took hold. Nordic classicism was thus a counter-reaction to that style and eclecticism in general; a movement toward [[Universal (metaphysics)|universal]]ism, internationalism and simplification.

Many of the architects who practiced in the Nordic Classical style made pilgrimages to northern [[Italy]] to study Italian vernacular architecture. With close cultural links at that time between the Nordic countries and Germany, another important source came from German critics of Art Nouveau, in particular [[Hermann Muthesius]] – who had been a promoter of the English [[Arts and Crafts movement]] and founded the [[Deutscher Werkbund]] in 1907 - and Paul Schultze-Naumburg, as well as the latter’s student [[Heinrich Tessenow]], and [[Peter Behrens]].

In turn, the thinking in Nordic Classicism became one of the basis for the development of Modernism in the Nordic Countries. The idea that there would have been a continuity between vernacular and modernism has been seen as counter to received historical opinion about the rise of Modernism, beginning with [[Le Corbusier]] and his [[Le Corbusier#Five points of architecture|5 Points for Architecture]], which are seen as overturning 5 basic principles of Classicism. A demonstration in real time of the move from Nordic Classicism to a pure Functionalism is offered by Alvar Aalto's design for the [[Viipuri Library]] (1927–35), which went through a profound transformation from the original architectural competition proposal in 1927 (owing much to Gunnar Asplund) to the severely functionalist building, completed eight years later in a purist modernist style, influenced by Le Corbusier.

{{for|the property law concept|Numerus clausus (law)}}

'''''Numerus clausus''''' ("closed number" in [[Latin]]) is one of many methods used to limit the number of [[student]]s who may study at a [[university]]. In many cases, the goal of the ''numerus clausus'' is simply to limit the number of students to the maximum feasible in some particularly sought-after areas of studies.  In historical terms however, in some countries, ''numerus clausus'' policies were religious or [[racial quota]]s, both in intent and function.
{{TOC right}}

==Modern use==
{{hatnote|For historical use, see [[Numerus clausus#Historical use|section below]]|selfref=yes}}

The ''numerus clausus'' is used in countries and universities where the number of applicants greatly exceeds the number of available places for students. This is the case in many countries of [[continental Europe]]. Students in much of Europe choose their field of specialization when they begin university study, unlike students in North America, who specialize later. Fields such as medicine, law, biology, dentistry, pharmacology, psychology and business administration are particularly popular and therefore harder to gain admittance to study.

===Selected examples===
====Brazil====
{{main|Vestibular exam#Racial quotas}}
In November 2002 the Brazilian government passed Federal Law 10.558/2002, known as the "Quota Law". The law allowed for the establishment of racial quotas at public universities. In 2012 the [[Supreme Federal Court]] of Brazil unanimously upheld the law.&lt;ref&gt;Brazil's Supreme Court upholds affirmative action in universities, KAREN JUANITA CARRILLO Special to the AmNews | 5/16/2012, 6:04 p.m., Amsterdam News, http://amsterdamnews.com/news/2012/may/16/brazils-supreme-court-upholds-affirmative-action/&lt;/ref&gt;

====Germany====
{{Further information|Education in Germany#Admission}}
The ''numerus clausus'' is used in Germany to address overcrowding at universities. There are local admission restrictions, which are set up for a particular degree program (''{{Lang|de|Studiengang}}'') at the university's discretion, and nationwide admission restrictions in medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine, and pharmacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hochschulkompass.de/en/degree-programmes/application-admission/admissions-procedure/local-admission-restrictions.html|title=Local admission restrictions|last=|first=|date=|website=hochschulkompass.de|publisher=German Rectors' Conference|access-date=2016-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hochschulkompass.de/en/degree-programmes/application-admission/admissions-procedure/national-admission-restrictions.html|title=National admission restrictions|last=|first=|date=|website=hochschulkompass.de|publisher=German Rectors' Conference|access-date=2016-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all degree programs restrict admissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hochschulkompass.de/en/degree-programmes/application-admission/admissions-procedure/no-admission-restrictions.html|title=No admission restrictions|last=|first=|date=|website=hochschulkompass.de|publisher=German Rectors' Conference|access-date=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common admission criterion is the final grade of the university entrance qualification, that is the high school completion certificate formally allowing the applicant to study at a German university. Typically, this is the ''[[Abitur]]''. The final grade takes into account the grades of the final exams as well as the course grades. In colloquial usage, ''numerus clausus'' may also refer to the lowest admitted grade in this process. Other criteria, e.g. interviews, are increasingly common as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wiwo.de/karriere/studenten-in-der-testmuehle-390632/|title=Auswahlverfahren der Universitäten: Studenten in der Testmühle|last=|first=|date=13 March 2009|website=|publisher=Wirtschaftswoche|language=German|access-date=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Finland====
The Finnish system of implementing the ''numerus clausus'' provides a comparison to the German model. In Germany, the main weight of the student selection lies on the ''Abitur'' grades (i.e. high school diploma). In Finland, which has a similar nationwide final exam, the [[Abitur#Finland|matriculation examination]] (Finnish ''ylioppilastutkinto''), the majority of student selections are based on entrance exams. Most degree programs consist of a single major subject and have their own entrance procedures. Nearly all programs have a quota in which the score is calculated solely on the basis of the entrance exam. The written exams usually consist of open-ended questions requiring the applicant to write an essay or solve problems. Multiple choice tests are uncommon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abo.fi/ansok/en/results Numerus Clausus. A system of Numerus Clausus (restricted entry) is in use at all institutions of higher education in Finland.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In fields where the competition for study places is less fierce. This is especially the case with the [[engineering]] and [[natural science]] programs. It is relatively easy to be accepted in these fields—about one-third of the study places in technology are awarded on the basis of the matriculation exam. The rest of the students are admitted on the basis of an entrance exam. After receiving a study place, the student must accept it in writing on the pain of forfeiting the place. In case the students receive more than one study place, they must select one. During the year, one person may accept only a single study place in an institution of higher education. The system is enforced through a national database on student admissions.

In the Finnish system, the ''numerus clausus'' is the most important factor limiting student numbers. After gaining entrance, traditionally a student cannot be expelled, pays no [[tuition]], and enjoys a state [[student benefit]]. The new legislation, introduced in the summer of 2005, limits the study period to seven years, but it is anticipated that it will be relatively easy to receive a permission for a longer study time. No changes to the financial position of the student are currently being considered (as of the summer of 2005).

====France====
In France, admission to the ''[[grande école|grandes écoles]]'' is obtained by competitive exams with a fixed, limited number of positions each year. Also, at the end of the first year of medical studies in universities, there is a competitive exam with a ''numerus clausus'' for determining which students are allowed to proceed to the second year; in later years of medical studies there is a competitive exam (''concours de l'internat'') for choosing medical specialties.&lt;ref&gt;M. Huguier, P. Romestaing (October 2014),  [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303576208_Numerus_clausus_and_medical_demographics_in_France  Numerus clausus and medical demographics in France.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ireland====
''Numerus clausus'' is also used in Ireland. [[University College Dublin]] uses the system in its admission for Medicine and Veterinary Medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://myucd.ucd.ie/admissions/alevel.ezc|title=A Level/GCE Applicant|author=EDge Interactive Publishing, Inc.|publisher=|accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Switzerland====
The introduction of the ''numerus clausus'' in Switzerland has limited the access to the medical studies at the universities. At all universities of the German-speaking part of Switzerland, the students need to have a high score on an aptitude test that comprises logical and spatial thinking and text understanding skills.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lyceum-alpinum.ch/en/academic/college-counselling/switzerland-germany/ Eignungstest für das Medizinstudium (Switzerland).] Numerus Clausus for Medical Studies in Switzerland and Germany.&lt;/ref&gt;

The universities in the western, French-speaking part of Switzerland did not decide to introduce a ''numerus clausus''. Instead, these universities provide unrestricted access to the first-year curriculum in medicine; and the best first-year students are allowed to further their medical studies at the same or at another university. In other popular faculties like psychology or journalism, there are also aptitude tests—but they concern only a single university.

====United States====
Starting in the 1980s, and ongoing {{as of|2017|lc=y}}, there have been allegations of an [[Asian quota]] in college admissions, analogous to the earlier [[Jewish quota]].&lt;ref name=lemann&gt;{{cite journal |title=Jews in Second Place |date=June 25, 1996 |first=Nicholas |last=Lemann |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/briefing/articles/1996/06/jews_in_second_place.html |journal=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |quote=Just at the moment when Harvard, Yale, and Princeton have presidents named Rudenstine, Levin, and Shapiro, those institutions are widely suspected of having informal ceilings on Asian admissions, of the kind that were imposed on Jews two generations ago. |accessdate=2017-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=unz2012&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-myth-of-american-meritocracy/ |title=The Myth of American Meritocracy |journal=[[The American Conservative]] |first=Ron |last=Unz |authorlink=Ron Unz |date=November 28, 2012 |accessdate=2017-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical use==
{{further|Jewish quota}}
Before [[World War II]], the limitations in the number of students of [[Jew]]ish origin in many countries were usually resulting from their disproportionate numbers in the national universities. This limitation took the form of quotas restricting the number of Jewish students so that their share in the student population would correspond with their share in the general population. The limitations in enrolment were introduced in over a dozen countries, allowing access to higher education to a greater proportion of non-Jewish students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.jhi.pl/publikacje/65 |title=Sytuacja prawna Żydów w Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej 1918–1939 - Żydowski Instytut Historyczny |website=www.jhi.pl |access-date=2016-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Countries legislating limitations on the admission of Jewish students, at various times, have included: [[Austria]], [[Canada]], [[Hungary]], [[Imperial Russia]], [[Iraq]], [[Latvia]] (from 1934 under [[Kārlis Ulmanis]] regime), [[Netherlands]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]], [[United States]], [[Vichy France]], and [[Yugoslavia]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;Freidenreich, Harriet Pass (1979) The Jews of Yugoslavia: A Quest for Community. Philadelphia:  Jewish Publication Society of America. "On Oct 5, 1940 the Royal Government in [[Serbia]] issued Two anti-Jewish decrees restricting them from producing or distributing food; and the other a numerous clausus law restricting enrollment in universities and high schools."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selected examples===
====Canada====
Certain Canadian universities had longstanding quotas on the number of Jews admitted to the respective universities. [[McGill University]]'s strict quota was the longest, being officially adopted in 1920 up until the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Tulchinsky, ''Canada's Jews: A People's Journey'', Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2008, pp. 132-133, 319-321, 410.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Germany====
A whole series of ''numerus clausus'' resolutions were adopted in 1929 on the grounds of race and place of origin, not religion.&lt;ref&gt;JTA Bulletin (1931-3-17), [http://pdfs.jta.org/1931/1931-03-17_064.pdf Berlin: The growing ''numerus clausus'' peril in Germany.] Page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 April 1933, the [[Nazi]] government introduced a 1.5 percent quota for new admissions of German non-Aryans, essentially of German Jews enrolling to German high-schools and universities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://alex.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno-plus?apm=0&amp;aid=dra&amp;datum=19330004&amp;zoom=2&amp;seite=00000225&amp;ues=0&amp;x=9&amp;y=13 Gesetz gegen die Überfüllung deutscher Schulen und Hochschulen (RGBl 1933 I, S. 225)] (original German text of the ''Law against the Overcrowding of German Schools and Universities'', introduced in 1933).

====Hungary====
The Hungarian ''numerus clausus'' was introduced in 1920. The law formally placed limits on the number of minority students at university, and legalized corporal punishment. Though the text did not use the term ''Jew'', it was nearly the only group overrepresented in higher education. The policy is often seen as the first Anti-Jewish Act of twentieth century Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Péter Tibor Nagy, [http://mek.oszk.hu/03700/03797/03797.htm#7 The "numerus clausus" policy of antisemitism or policy of higher education], in ''The social and political history of Hungarian education''&lt;/ref&gt;

Its aim was to restrict the number of Jews to 6 percent, which was their proportion in Hungary at that time; the rate of Jewish students was approximately 15% in the 1910s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Miklos Molnar, ''A Concise History of Hungary'', CUP, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928 &amp;ndash; also because of the pressure of liberal capital and League of Nations &amp;ndash; the act was modified and the passage of the ethnicity quota had been eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://regi.sofar.hu/hu/node/13270 |title=A Numerus Clausus módosítása - The modification of the Numerus Clausus law |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website="http://regi.sofar.hu"}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the period of 1938–1945 the anti-Jewish acts were revitalised and eventually much worsened, partly due to [[German Nazi]] pressure, and in hope of revising the [[Treaty of Trianon]] with the help of Germany.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

====Poland====
{{see also|Ghetto benches}}
''Numerus clausus'' in interwar Poland was unofficially introduced in 1937 by some universities. It was a result of highly disproportionate number of Jewish students in key disciplines including 62.9 percent in [[stomatology]], 34 percent in medical sciences, 29.2 percent in philosophy, 24.9 percent in chemistry and 22.1 percent in law (26 percent by 1929). Such numbers were the cause of a backlash at most Polish universities, with notable protest organized by the non-Jewish political parties.&lt;ref name="AJ"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Sytuacja prawna mniejszosci żydowskiej w Drugiej Rzeczypospolitej |trans-title=The legal status of the Jewish minority in the Second Republic |at=pp. 65–66 (20/38 in PDF) |author=Anna Jaskóła, [[University of Wrocław]] |publisher=Wydział Prawa, Administracji i Ekonomii.

During the [[partitions of Poland]] by the neighbouring empires, Poles were denied education, and the severely limited number of schools were poorly funded. Following Poland's return to independence, the advocates of the ''numerus clausus'' policy pointed out that the limit would balance the chance to enter university of all nationalities in Poland (Polish, Lithuanian, Belorussian, Ukrainian, German etc.). The other reason given by the supporters of the idea was that it was an attempt to equal the chance of children from countryside families who had very limited access to education to the chance of the children of Jewish families living in the towns and cities. After World War II similar policies were introduced by the pro-Soviet communists, based on preferential treatment of peasant and working-class children. The students from working-class families were intended to form the new socialist intelligentsia.

====United States====
Between 1918 and the 1950s a number of private universities and medical schools in the United States introduced ''numerus clausus'' policies limiting admissions of students based on their religion or race to certain percentages within the college population. Many minority groups were negatively impacted by these policies; one of the groups affected was [[Jewish]] applicants, whose admission to some New England- and New York City-area [[liberal arts college]]s fell significantly between the late 1910s and the mid-1930s.&lt;ref name=Gladwell&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/10/10/051010crat_atlarge Getting In: the social logic of Ivy League admissions] by [[Malcolm Gladwell]], [[The New Yorker]], 10 October 2005&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the admission to [[Harvard University]] during that period fell from 27.6% to 17.1% and in [[Columbia University]] from 32.7% to 14.6%. Corresponding quotas were introduced in the medical and dental schools resulting during the 1930s in the decline of Jewish students: e.g. in [[Cornell University]] School of Medicine from 40% in 1918–22 to 3.57% in 1940–41, in [[Boston University]] Medical School from 48.4% in 1929–30 to 12.5% in 1934–35. At [[Yale University]], Dean Milton Winternitz's instructions to the admissions office regarding ethnic quotas were very specific: "Never admit more than five Jews, take only two [[Italian-American|Italian]] [[Catholic]]s, and take no [[African-American|blacks]] at all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gerard N. Burrow|title=A History of Yale's School of Medicine: Passing Torches to Others|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XzYX_MduAG8C&amp;pg=PA107|year=2008|publisher=Yale University Press|page=107ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, a notable exception among U. S. medical schools was the medical school of [[Middlesex University (Massachusetts)|Middlesex University]], which had no quotas and many Jewish faculty members and students; school officials believed that antisemitism played a role in the school's failure to secure [[American Medical Association|AMA]] accreditation.&lt;ref name=reisfounding&gt;{{cite web |author = Reis, Arthur H., Jr| title=The Founding | work=Brandeis Review, fiftieth Anniversary Edition | url=http://www.brandeis.edu/publications/review/50threview/founding.pdf | accessdate=2006-05-17}}, pp. 42–3: founder's son C. Ruggles Smith quoted: "From its inception, Middlesex was ruthlessly attacked by the American Medical Association, which at that time was dedicated to restricting the production of physicians, and to maintaining an inflexible policy of discrimination in the admission of medical students. Middlesex, alone among medical schools, selected its students on the basis of merit, and refused to establish any racial quotas"&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common method, employed by 90% of American universities and colleges at the time to identify the "desirable" (native-born, white, Protestant) applicants, was the application form questions about their religious preference, race, and nationality. Other more subtle methods included restrictions on scholarships, rejection of transfer students, and preferences for alumni sons and daughters.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

'''[[Legacy preference]]''' for university admissions was devised in 1925 at [[Yale University]], where the proportional number of Jews in the student body was growing at a rate that became alarming to the school's administrators.&lt;ref name=Gladwell/&gt; Prior to that year, Yale had begun to incorporate such amorphous criteria as 'character' and 'solidity', as well as 'physical characteristics', into its admissions process as an excuse for screening out Jewish students;&lt;ref name=Gladwell/&gt; but nothing was as effective as legacy preference, which allowed the admissions board to summarily pass over Jews in favor of 'Yale sons of good character and reasonably good record', as a 1929 memo phrased it. Other schools, including [[Harvard]], soon began to pursue similar policies for similar reasons, and Jewish students in the [[Ivy League]] schools were maintained at a steady 10% through the 1950s. Such policies were gradually discarded during the early 1960s, with Yale being one of the last of the major schools to eliminate the last vestige with the class of 1970 (entering in 1966).&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.yalealumnimagazine.com/issues/99_12/admissions.html The Birth of a New Institution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314164351/http://www.yalealumnimagazine.com/issues/99_12/admissions.html |date=2010-03-14 }}'' Geoffrey Kabaservice, ''Yale Alumni Magazine'', December 1999&lt;/ref&gt; While legacy admissions as a way of screening out Jewish students may have ceased, the practice of giving preference to legacies has continued to the present day. In the 1998 book ''The Shape of the River: Long-Term Consequences of Considering Race in College and University Admissions'', authors William G. Bowen, former Princeton University president, and [[Derek Bok]], former Harvard University president, found "the overall admission rate for legacies was almost twice that for all other candidates".

The religion preference question was eventually dropped from the admission application forms and noticeable evidence of informal ''numerus clausus'' policies in the American private universities and medical schools decreased by the 1950s.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

==As related to matters other than education==
''Numerus clausus'' is also a rule that regulates the number of practitioners of a public service in many areas. In the U.S., for instance, it can limit the number of liquor stores to be found in a given geographic area.

In France, it limits the distribution of [[civil law notary|public notaries]] geographically and, in effect, limits competition for their services (since their fees are fixed by the state). Notaries handle, for instance, title transactions, which is not allowed to lawyers in France. Similar limitations apply to [[pharmacist]]s, and to licensed premises for the consumption of strong alcoholic beverages.

In India the system of [[Mandal Commission|caste quotas for job placement]] is enforced,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2003-08-16/news/27551045_1_upper-caste-quota-obc-leaders-mandal-commission | title = Fear of OBC backlash may derail upper caste quota plan | website = timesofindia-economictimes | access-date = 2016-02-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and vigorously defended by strikes and riots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/22/india-caste-protesters-accept-offer-to-end-riots-and-water-crisis | title = Delhi faces water crisis after canal sabotaged in deadly protests | last = France-Presse | first = Agence | date = 2016-02-22 | newspaper = The Guardian | language = en-GB | issn = 0261-3077 | access-date = 2016-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, the rule is administered by the corporation or professional body to which the public servant must adhere, but it is also employed by state entities that have the responsibility for assuring the uniformity of a public service across a national geography.

[[Image:GriotsSambala.jpg|thumb|A drawing of Griots.]]
Circa 1230s-1600s, the '''Mali''' '''Empire''' was created in Western Africa along the Niger River. Often associated with being founded by [[Sunjata Keita]], the history of Mali is extremely based on oral history. The story of the founder of Mali, Sunjata Keita, is largely based on oral history. Oral history may be defined as the preservation and interpretation of historical, cultural or personal experiences by way of a speaker. In Mali, such a speaker can be described as a poet, a storyteller, a praise singer or a musician. A large amount of Mali’s history is transferred via oral historians. Such oral historians in Mali are known as '''griots, Jalis, and Jelis'''. The origins of oral history in Mali may be traced back to the story of Sunjata Keita. Modern-day oral history in Mali has transformed from the history based griots to a more contemporary musical and negotiator based griots. The current state of oral history in Mali has travelled to other realms like popular culture and politics.

==What is a griot?==
One cannot become a [[Griot]]; one must be born into a family of griots to hold that position. Sometimes, a key aspect to signify who is a griot can be found in the last name. Jeliyas are similar to griots but are not born into a griot family. Jeliya described as the "art of the griot" refers to a type of "musical and verbal artist".&lt;ref name=Jeliya&gt;[http://djembefola.com/jeliya.php "Jeliya- The Art of Jeli (Griot)".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100920202539/http://djembefola.com/jeliya.php |date=2010-09-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jelis have an "exclusive right to play the kora".&lt;ref name=Jeliya /&gt; Jelis are similar to griots because they also recount history but the jelis role is to "Sing and recount Mande social and political life".&lt;ref name=Jeliya /&gt; In reference to a griot, griots are only supposed to marry other griots. Like jelis, griots in Mali often use instruments and music to recite history which ultimately renders the history a performance and not just a story.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ias.umn.edu/2012/10/11/ryan-skinner/ Ryan Skinner discusses griots (and other matters) in an interview with Peter Shea]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oral history in the Mali Empire==
In the '''Mali Empire''', an evident example of '''oral history''' is the Sunjata Keita or [[Sundiata Keita]] story. The Sunjata Keita story remains a strong representation of oral history. Because there are a plethora of versions of the Sunjata story, this exemplifies how oral history can change slightly depending on the griot reciting the history. Also, oral history can be traced back to Sunjata because in the story Sunjata’s griots play a major part to his success. Bamba Suso in his version of ''Sunjata'' writes:
{{quotation |
		After that had happened they went into the circumcision shed.
		After they had come out of there,
		It was not long before his father died.
		Sunjata announced, ‘As for myself,
		However extensive my father’s property may be, 
		I want no part of it except the griots.’
		They asked him, ‘Do you want the griots?’
		They said, Leave it; 
		A person who has nothing will not have griots for long.’
		The griots said, ‘Since he has let all his inheritance go, 
		And says that it is only us that he wants,
		We will not abandon him.
		If he does not die, we shall not desert him.’
		The griots were at his side.&lt;ref&gt;Suso, Bamba, and Banna Kanute (1974). ''Sunjata.'' London: Penguin Books, pp. 122-135.&lt;/ref&gt; }}
Suso’s story of Sunjata shows how griots often remain within the family lineage. When Sunjata’s father died, like other parts of his father’s estate, Sunjata was able to choose griots from his father’s estate as well. The ''Sunjata'' story shows that in the Mali Empire, noble families needed griots in order to spread family history. Sunjata states, “I want no part of it [father’s property] except the griots”.&lt;ref&gt;Suso, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; Sunjata’s need for a griot emphasizes how noble families and griots were often seen as undividable. In the Mali Empire, griots were associated with noble families because such families needed oral historians to accompany them in order to tell the history of their life. Emperors and great warriors often had griots and with such griots, oral history in Mali spreads. The oral historians who were “assigned” to or rather “chosen” for a family were set to remain loyal to that family for life. Loyalty was an important quality a griot must have. In Suso’s version of the Sunjata story says: “We [griots] will not abandon him”.&lt;ref&gt;Suso, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Mali Empire, the bond between griots and the emperor, warrior-king, or family they served was meant to be a lifelong bond. In ''Sunjata'', Sunjata’s griot, Bala Faaseega Kuyate acted as both the oral historian for Sunjata and his advisor at times. Throughout Suso’s version of ''Sunjata'', '''Bala Faaseega Kuyate''' accompanies Sunjata. Suso writes:
		&lt;poem&gt;"A day will come
		When bush fowls will lay their eggs on the site of your
		deserted town.
		He says here is your gold.’
		When he had done that, Sunjata buried his mother; 
		Then he and Nyakhaleng Juma Suukho,
		And his younger brother,
		And Bala Faaseega Kuyate
		Rose up and went.
		When he and Bala Faaseega Kuyate were on their way,
		They had gone far into the bush,
		And they had been travelling for a long time when Bala said, ‘I
		Am terribly hungry.’
		Sunjata said, ‘Wait here.’
		He went into a clump of thick bush,
		He examined the calf of his leg where there was plenty of flesh
		and he cut some off.
		When he had cut it into thin strips, he cooked it,
		Then he pounded the leaves of a medicinal shrub and then tied up his leg,
		He came back,
		And he said to Bala, ‘Here is some meat’".&lt;ref&gt;Suso, pp. 432-451.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;
The relationship between Sunjata and Bala Faaseega Kuyate describes the relationship between oral historians and emperors or aristocrats in the Mali Empire. Sunjata was very protective of Kuyate, in turn; Kuyate was extremely loyal to Sunjata. It is the job of the griots to be loyal to the family or person they “work” for. Griots did not merely work for the nobility, griots in the Mali Empire also worked for villages. Such griots were used to recite history of births and deaths, battles and marriages in the village.

Not only were griots used to recite history of births and deaths, battles and marriages in the villages, but oral historians and griots are also an important cultural facet in Mali in terms of language. Because oral history, is exactly as the name describes, a means of passing history verbally, language is also passed on by oral historians.

==Skills of oral historians in modern Mali==
In present-day Mali, oral historians / griots are sometimes seen as “intermediaries” between two parties. Oral historians in modern Mali often act as mediators between those from different political parties. [[Jan Jansen (historian)|Jan Jansen]] in ''The Griot’s Craft: An Essay on Oral Tradition and Diplomacy'' discusses the role and skills of oral historians in modern-day Mali:
{{quotation |
		"‘Being sent’ is a strategy that is used often in Mande.
		It is a way to create a space for negotiation. Griots are
		conscious of their role as intermediaries, a role which 
		necessitates contact with both parties for whom they
		act as negotiators. They deliberately keep the parties
		apart so that they do not encounter each other, unless
		at a reconciliation festivity."&lt;ref&gt;[[Jan Jansen (historian)|Jansen, Jan]] (2000). ''The Griot's Craft: An Essay on Oral Tradition and Diplomacy'', New Brunswick: Transaction Publishers, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
He writes about “being sent” as a strategy for modern-day griots. Similarly to griots during the Mali Empire, modern-day griots must also pass messages between different parties. The skill of “being sent” allows for “negotiation” to occur between parties that may not have negotiated without the help of griots. The oral historians understand that their role does not merely rest on capturing and narrating history, but their role goes as far as encompassing negotiator between two different parties with distinct ideals. Oral historians in modern-day Mali provide a source of communication between such parties. Not only do oral historians chronicle history but they also create a means to communicate. Once the “negotiator” / oral historian completes his goal of mediating tensions between the different parties, the parties are able to have a “reconciliation festivity,” the griots position as both a negotiator and historian are exemplified. Throughout Western Africa and Africa as a continent, oral historians act as mediators between conflicting parties. Oral historians are often essential to solve certain problems. Jansen’s work provides a detailed account of other skills that oral historians / griots need in modern-day Mali. Jansen describes a griot’s skills as a means to “master and manipulate the processes of ‘heating’ and ‘cooling down’ social situations”.&lt;ref&gt;Jansen, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the skills that Jansen describes are:
# 	Don’t [initially] let the parties meet
# 	Don’t [initially] allow parties to talk directly to each other
# 	Repetitive talking
# 	Slowing down of negotiations

Because oral historians in modern Mali are often used as negotiators, the above stated skills ease the process of solving problems between the different political parties. Oral historians in modern Mali acting as negotiators do not allow the parties to meet until the problem at hand is solved. The reasoning behind not allowing the parties to initially meet acts as a way to ease the anger members of the conflicting parties may feel toward each other. Jansen writes: “[a member of a conflicting party] must never express his opinions to the person he is in conflict with since this person will die of anger”.&lt;ref&gt;Jansen, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the job of the griot to keep both parties separate to eliminate the chance of this anger occurring. Similarly to the reason why the griot does not allow both parties to meet initially, the griot does not allow both parties to meet as a means to eliminate tensions that can occur if both parties were to meet. The skill of repetitive talking that Jansen lists is used for “serious matters”.&lt;ref name=Jansen44&gt;Jansen, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Jansen writes:
		"Serious matters are not left to only one person to communicate.
		A small group is created in order to communicate the message. 
		The messenger asks a member of the group to transmit a certain
		message to the person to whom the message is directed. The
		message is then transmitted from person to person until it reaches
		its destination."&lt;ref name=Jansen44 /&gt; 

The repetitive talking of oral history transforms the message being passed into a “supra-personal phenomenon” and allows the message to “gain a semblance of authority”.&lt;ref name=Jansen44 /&gt; Likewise, the repetitive nature of oral history transforms messages and creates similar yet slightly different versions of historical events. Jansen describes “slowing down negotiations” as essential to appease both sides of conflicting parties.&lt;ref&gt;Jansen, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Jansen’s presentation of griots in modern Mali as messengers depicts the transformation of oral historians over time. During the Mali Empire, oral historians often were limited to working with a specific family or emperor but in current Mali, oral historians are no longer limited but can act as messengers between various political parties or other groups.

==Modern-day relations between griots and nobles in Mali==
The relationship between griots and nobles may appear to be a difficult one to understand. As seen through the relationship described between Sunjata and Bala Faaseega Kuyate, the noble and griot relationship is sometimes represented as a partnership. Dr. Barbara G. Hoffman, an associate professor of Anthropology at [[Cleveland State University]], discusses in her book ''Griots at War: Conflict, Conciliation, and Caste in Mande'' the relationship between griots and nobles. She writes that “tension is often expressed through nobles’ criticism of griots’ “empty speech” or griots’ disdain for nobles lack of self-knowledge”.&lt;ref name=Hoffman53&gt;Hoffman, Barbara (2000). ''Griots at War: Conflict, Conciliation, and Caste in Mande.'' Bloomington &amp; Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; While griots take pride in understanding themselves and life around them, nobles are often more focused on worldly aspects. Despite the relationship that is suggested in ''Sunjata'', the relationship between nobles and griots can be seen as extremely different from that of loyalty and partnership. Hoffman views the relationship between griots and nobles as showing a sharp distinction between castes. Hoffman writes, “This [the caste system] was a central issue for the griots and nobles present at this Kita celebration. They generated social difference and the reinforcement of social boundaries through a repertoire of strategies for recreating old social structures as well as for creating new ones”.&lt;ref name=Hoffman53 /&gt; In modern Mali, griots are often seen as being a part of a lower caste then nobles despite the help and history they provide to nobles and society. In Hoffman's work addresses the position of oral historians in  castes "Mande-style".&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; Hoffman writes, "Living up to one's caste ideals is a source of pride in Mande; violating them a cause for disgrace." The position of griots in the Mande caste system was that of extremely lower stature then the nobles griots and oral historians have a tendency to work for. Oral historians molded their way into the caste system and although they are of a lower caste then nobles, they are extremely influential in Mali. In ''Status and Identity in West Africa: Nyamakalaw of Mande'', David C. Conrad also discusses the relationship between nobles and griots, writing: "Another revealing aspect of the relationship between nobles and griots is the asymmetry of their mutual accountability. For example, nobles almost never blame individual griots for the general character of the group".&lt;ref name=Conrad29&gt;Conrad, David C. (1995). '' Status and Identity in West Africa: Nyamakalaw of Mande.'' Bloomington &amp; Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Conrad then goes on to describe how griots "openly criticize nobles in public as well as in private".&lt;ref name=Conrad29 /&gt; Although griots are seen as being inferior to nobles, griots have no issue criticizing the faults of the family they work for. Such a willingness to criticize emphasizes the fact that griots do have in Mali despite their position in the caste system. Also included in Conrad's book is Cherif Keita's essay "Jaliya in the Modern World: A Tribute to Banzumana Sissoko and Massa Makan Diabate", in which Cherif Keita presents a "tribute to contemporary bards".&lt;ref name=Conrad16&gt;Conrad, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Keita praises the griots and claims that griots "have contributed positively to toward the building of a modern nation-state".&lt;ref name=Conrad16 /&gt; Contrary to beliefs that griots were seen as a part of a lower class, Keita presents an "aristocratic view of contemporary griots".&lt;ref name=Conrad16 /&gt; Keita's perspective on griots provides a different outlook on the position of griots in modern Mali. Although griots are looked at as being a part of a low caste, griots have added to cultural and historical modern Mali society.

==Popular modern-day griots in Mali==
In modern-day Mali, griots are often singers or musicians. For example, [[Abdoulaye Diabaté]], a singer from Mali, was born into a family of griots in 1956. Diabaté has a plethora of experience in contemporary and popular music. [[Baba Sissoko]] is also considered a Malian griot because he was born into a family of griots. Another griot from Mali, [[Toumani Diabaté]], also has a plethora of experience in other forms of performing. Toumani Diabaté has experience in flamenco, blues and jazz.

The '''Pilate stone''' is a damaged block (82&amp;nbsp;cm x 65&amp;nbsp;cm) of carved [[limestone]] with a partially intact inscription attributed to, and mentioning, [[Pontius Pilate]], a [[Prefect#Ancient Rome|prefect]] of the Roman [[Judaea (Roman province)|province of Judaea]] from AD 26 to 36. It was discovered at the archaeological site of [[Caesarea Maritima]] in 1961. The artifact is particularly significant because it is an archaeological find of an authentic 1st-century Roman inscription mentioning the name "Pontius Pilatus".  It is contemporary to Pilate's lifetime, and accords with what is known of his reported career.&lt;ref&gt;''Archaeology and the Galilean Jesus: a re-examination of the evidence'' by Jonathan L. Reed 2002 {{ISBN|1563383942}} p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ChiltonE465&gt;''Studying the historical Jesus: evaluations of the state of current research'' by Bruce Chilton, Craig A. Evans 1998 {{ISBN|9004111425}} p. 465&lt;/ref&gt;  In effect, the writing constitutes the earliest surviving record and a contemporaneous evidence for the historical existence of this person; otherwise known from the [[Pontius Pilate#Canonical gospels|New Testament]], [[Pontius Pilate#Jewish literature: Philo and Josephus|Jewish literature]] and brief mentions in retrospective Roman histories, which have themselves survived in still-later copies.

It is likely that Pontius Pilate made his base at Caesarea Maritima, a city that had replaced [[Jerusalem]] since AD 6 as the administrative capital and military headquarters of the province,&lt;ref name=BenSasson&gt;''A History of the Jewish People'', H.H. Ben-Sasson editor, 1976, p. 247: "When Judea was converted into a Roman province [in 6 CE, p. 246], the Romans moved the governmental residence and military headquarters from Jerusalem to Caesarea. The centre of government was thus removed from Jerusalem, and the administration became increasingly based on inhabitants of the Hellenistic cities (Sebaste, Caesarea and others).&lt;/ref&gt; and the site where the stone was discovered. Pilate probably travelled to Jerusalem, the central city of the province's Jewish population, only as often as necessary.&lt;ref&gt;''Historical Dictionary of Jesus'' by Daniel J. Harrington 2010 {{ISBN|0810876671}} p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Pilate stone'' is currently located at the [[Israel Museum]] in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Vardaman, ''A New Inscription Which Mentions Pilate as 'Prefect' '',  ''[[Journal of Biblical Literature]]'' Vol. 81,  1962.  pp. 70–71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Craig A. Evans, ''Jesus and the ossuaries'', Volume 44, Baylor University Press, 2003. pp. 45–47&lt;/ref&gt;  Replica castings can be found at the [[Archaeological Museum (Milan)|Archaeological Museum]] in [[Milan, Italy]], and on display in Caesarea Maritima itself.

==Inscription==
On the partially damaged block is a dedication to the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|deified]] [[Augustus]] and [[Livia Drusilla|Livia]] ("the Divine Augusti"), the stepfather and mother of emperor [[Tiberius]], originally placed within a ''Tiberieum'', probably a temple dedicated to Tiberius. It has been deemed authentic because it was  discovered in the coastal town of Caesarea, which was the capital of [[Iudaea Province]]&lt;ref name=BenSasson/&gt; during the time Pontius Pilate was [[Roman governor]].

The partial inscription reads (conjectural letters in brackets):&lt;ref name=ChiltonE465 /&gt;

:[''DIS AUGUSTI'']S TIBERIÉUM
:[''...PONTI'']US PILATUS
:[''...PRAEF'']ECTUS IUDA[''EA'']E
:[''...FECIT D'']E[''DICAVIT'']

The translation from Latin to English for the inscription reads:
:''To the Divine Augusti [this] Tiberieum''
:''...Pontius Pilate''
:''...prefect of Judea''
:''...has dedicated [this]''

==Discovery==
[[File:Pontius Pilate Inscription.JPG|thumb|''Pontius Pilate'' inscription; the original stone, now located in the Israel Museum, Jerusalem]]
The limestone block was discovered in June 1961 by Italian archaeologists led by Dr. Antonio Frova while excavating in the area of an [[Roman theatre (structure)|ancient theatre]] built by decree of [[Herod the Great]] around 22–10 BC, along with the entire city of Caesarea.

The artifact is a fragment of the dedicatory inscription of a later building, probably a temple, that was constructed, possibly in honour of the emperor [[Tiberius]],&lt;ref&gt;[[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 15#44|Tacitus, ''Annals'', 15.44]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://lexundria.com/go?q=J.+AJ+18.89&amp;v=wst |first=Flavius |last=Josephus |author-link=Josephus |work=[[Antiquities of the Jews]] |title=18.89 |section=§63 |translator-first=William |translator-last=Whiston |translator-link=William Whiston |quote=before he could get to Rome Tiberius was dead |access-date=11 April 2017 |publisher=Lexundria.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; dating to 26–36 AD.&lt;ref name="IMJ"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pontius Pilate, Prefect of Judah – Latin dedicatory inscription|url=http://www.english.imjnet.org.il/Popup.aspx?c0=13142|website=The Israel Museum|publisher=The Israel Museum, Jerusalem 1995–2015|access-date=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stone was then reused in the 4th century as a building block for a set of stairs belonging to a structure erected behind the [[scaenae frons|stage house]] of the Herodian theatre, and it was discovered there, still attached to the ancient staircase, by the archaeologists.&lt;ref&gt;A.N. Sherwin-White, review of "A. Frova, L'iscrizione di Ponzio Pilato a Cesarea" in ''The Journal of Roman Studies'', 54 (1964), p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre is located in a town that was called [[Caesarea Maritima]] in the present-day city of [[Caesarea|Caesarea-on-the-Sea]] (also called Maritima).

In the field of [[linguistics]], '''polygenesis''' is the view that human languages evolved as several lineages independent of one another. It is contrasted with [[Proto-Human language|monogenesis]], which is the view that human languages all go back to a single common ancestor. 

Polygenesis is not to be confused with the [[wave model (linguistics)|wave theory]], originally propounded by [[Johannes Schmidt (linguist)|Johannes Schmidt]].

The '''''Preliminary Discourse'' to the ''Encyclopedia'' of ''Diderot''''' (''Discours Préliminaire des Éditeurs'') is the primer to [[Denis Diderot]]'s ''[[Encyclopédie|Encyclopédie ou Dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers, par une Société de Gens de lettres]]'', a collaborative collection of all the known branches of the [[French art#Historic overview|arts]] and [[History of science#Early modern science|sciences]] of the 18th century [[Early Modern France|French]] [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. The ''Preliminary Discourse'' was written by [[Jean Le Rond d'Alembert]] to describe the structure of the articles included in the ''Encyclopédie'' and their philosophy, as well as to give the reader a strong background in the history behind the works of the learned men who contributed to what became the most profound circulation of the knowledge of the time.

==Background==
''The Preliminary Discourse to the Encyclopedia of Diderot'' is arguably one of the best introductions to the [[French Enlightenment]], giving forth the idea that man possesses the capability, through his own intelligence and analysis, to alter the conditions of human life. The ''Encyclopedia'' constituted a demand of the intellectual community for a refinement of all of the branches of [[knowledge]] in reference to past and recent discoveries. Such a compilation of human knowledge would be both [[secular]] and [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]], discrediting [[theology]] as the primary basis. The ''Discourse'', although created by [[d'Alembert]], was actually a result of collaboration with other "[[Intellectual#Man of Letters|men of letters]]" aiming towards the same progressive goals of the Enlightenment.Three of these major contemporary ''[[philosophes]]''  that undoubtedly contributed to the guiding philosophies and beliefs of the "Discourse" include [[Denis Diderot]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], and [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac]], with whom d'Alembert was known to have been in contact. These men shared a passion for the dissemination of scientific knowledge. And, although this time period would seem unfavorable to such an endeavor, with Europe undergoing massive political upheaval and general instability, the time was ripe for their ideals to take hold. A thriving community of professionals, aristocrats, and clergy became increasingly responsive to the exchange of ideas that came to characterize and serve as the foundation for the cooperative compilation of information in this ''Encyclopedia''.

Before the ''Discourse'' was ever created, d'Alembert was actually better known for his scientific and mathematical genius. However, over time, and in part due to his vibrant personality, he befriended [[Madame du Deffand]], whose powerful [[salon (gathering)|salon]] ultimately allowed him to enter the public eye as a philosophe. d'Alembert also became a close ally of [[Diderot]], and eventually, d'Alembert was a man who was held in very high regard among Europe's intellectuals.  Ultimately, d'Alembert's tendency to turn more to history to explain the foundations of science and ethics reflects a general historical trend to seek enlightenment and better understanding of human nature in history. Ultimately, the Discourse defines two ways of approaching ideas, one of which being operations of the "isolated mind" (xli) and the other concerning studies of the origins of truth as a function of the progress of a given society. Although the Discourse derives much of its fundamental principles from men such as [[René Descartes]], [[John Locke]] and Condillac in a purely [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] sense, the effect of historical experience is vital.

It is important to note that while the philosophes began the intellectual transformations that became known as the [[French Enlightenment]], scientists all over Europe began to make their own changes in terms of new discoveries, areas they felt required further study, and how they could go about such studies, i.e. their methodology. Many of these new scientists felt that they were rebelling against old forms of science and scientific knowledge, just as the philosophes felt that they were bringing to the world a new way of thinking about humanity and human knowledge. The philosophes were aware of these changes in the field of science, and as such, they fully supported, and arguably adapted, the scientists's new systems of thinking into their philosophical ideas. One can see this in the ''Discourse'' itself; d'Alembert attempted to create a method of systematizing and organizing all legitimate information and knowledge as well as make easier and more efficient the unearthing of more knowledge.

D'Alembert's motives behind such an enterprise can ultimately be referenced to one of the ideas that he puts forth in the Discourse, for "liberty of action and thought alone is capable of producing great things, and liberty requires only enlightenment to preserve it from excess" (62). Clerical control in the domain of knowledge and intellect was considered detrimental to the progress of human knowledge. Maintaining that the Discourse was ultimately corrosive to [[hierarchical]] authority and privilege paved the way for the evolution of [[egalitarian]] principles in [[Western culture]]. D'Alembert puts forth that all men are equal in their sensations, which is the source of their mind. The ultimate distinction of man is primarily intellectual, which overthrows any preconceived connection between social privilege and knowledge. Therefore, the Encyclopedia as a whole speaks to the general public.

==Summary==

===Part I===
In part one of the book, d'Alembert provides a general introduction to the origin of knowledge, which led to the works found in the ''Encyclopédie''. He asserts that the "existence of our senses" is "indisputable," and that these senses are thus the principle of all knowledge. He links this idea to a chain of thinking and reflection that eventually leads to the need to communicate, which sets another chain of events in effect. One of his arguments for the origin of communication is that it was necessary for people to protect themselves from the evils of the world and to benefit from each other's knowledge. This communication led to the exchange of ideas that enhanced the ability of individuals to further human knowledge. Additionally, d'Alembert introduces the reader to the types of knowledge people store. The two main types that he describes refer to direct and reflexive knowledge. Direct knowledge is obtained by human senses and reflexive knowledge is derived from direct knowledge. These two types of knowledge lead to the three main types of thinking and their corresponding divisions of human knowledge: [[memory]], which corresponds with [[History]]; reflection or [[reason]], which is the basis of [[Philosophy]]; and what d'Alembert refers to as "[[imagination]]," (50) or imitation of Nature, which produces [[Fine Arts]].

From these divisions spring smaller subdivisions such as [[physics]], [[poetry]], music and many others. d'Alembert was also greatly influenced by the Cartesian principle of simplicity. In this first part of the book, he describes how the reduction of the principles of a certain science gives them scope and makes them more "fertile" (22). Only by reducing principles can they be understood and related to each other. Ultimately, from a high "vantage point" (47) the philosopher can then view the vast labyrinth of sciences and the arts. d'Alembert then goes on to describe the tree of knowledge and the separation and simultaneous connections between memory, reason, and imagination. He later explains that the ideal universe would be one gigantic truth if one only knew how to view it as such; the assumption that knowledge has intrinsic unity can be seen as the foundation of the project of making the encyclopedia.

===Part II===
Part two of the book provides the reader with an account of the progress of human knowledge in the sequence of memory, imagination and reason. This sequence is different from the one described in Part I, where the sequence is memory, reason, and imagination. It is the sequence a mind left in isolation or the original generation follows whereas in Part II he describes the progress of human knowledge in the centuries of enlightenment that started from erudition, continued with [[belles-lettres]], and reached to philosophy.

Instead of writing in terms of general ideas, d'Alembert provides the dates, places and people responsible for the progress of literary works since the Renaissance leading up to his date. One key example is [[René Descartes]], who the author lauds as both an excellent philosopher and mathematician. His application of [[algebra]] to [[geometry]], also known as the [[Cartesian coordinate system]], provided an excellent tool for the [[physical sciences]]. He focuses on the importance of ancient knowledge and the ability to understand and build on it. Reference is made that concepts of knowledge could not have advanced as quickly had there not been ancient works to imitate and surpass. He also clarifies that there can be disadvantages to the ability to retrieve information from the past. Noted in the text is the lack of improvement in philosophy in comparison to other advancements due to the ignorant belief that ancient philosophy could not be questioned. d'Alembert claims that it would be ignorant to perceive that everything could be known about a particular subject. Additionally, he makes an attempt to show how individuals could free their minds from the yoke of authority. His use of [[deductive logic]] provides a more philosophical base for the existence of [[God]]. He makes clear that all sciences are restricted as much as can be to facts and that opinion influences science as little as possible. d'Alembert states that philosophy is far more effective at the analysis of our perceptions when the "soul is in a state of tranquility", when it is not caught up in passion and emotion (96). He believes that the philosopher is key in furthering the fields of science.  The philosopher must be able to stand back and observe science and nature with an impartial eye. Furthermore, the importance of science and the advancements of such intellects as [[Francis Bacon]], [[Isaac Newton]], [[Descartes]], [[John Locke]] and others are explained.

===Part III===
Part three of the book concludes by detailing the important attributes of the writing of the ''Encyclopédie'' and by mentioning important contributors. d'Alembert discusses how the ''Encyclopédie'' is open to changes and additions from others since it is a work of many centuries. In addition, he states that an omission in an encyclopedia is harmful to its substance which differs from an omission in a dictionary. d'Alembert also states the three categories of the Encyclopédie, which are the sciences, the [[liberal arts]] and the mechanical arts. He states that it is important that these subcategories remain separate and concludes with the fact that society must judge the Preliminary Discourse to the ''Encyclopedia'' of Diderot.

===System of Human Knowledge===
At the end of the book, d'Alembert includes a detailed explanation of the system of human knowledge. This includes a chart entitled "[[Figurative System of Human Knowledge]]", which divides human understanding into its three constituents: memory, reason, and imagination. The chart then subdivides each of the three major categories into many other categories of human understanding. After his chart d'Alembert goes on to provide a detailed explanation of every division and subdivision apparent in his chart. The chart establishes a complex [[genealogy]] of knowledge and the way man has subdivided knowledge into the specific areas he feels they are applicable.  It is important to remember that no one of these systems of human knowledge plays a more significant role than any of the others. These systems are designed around the idea that each uses the other two to build upon itself and further human knowledge as a whole. In context the chart shows a progression of knowledge through the ages, memory being the past, reason being the present, which examines and tries to either build or create new theories based on memory, and imagination which focuses on making new assumptions or theories about things in our human universe.

==Significance==
The method of the ''Discourse'' and the ''Encyclopedia'' marked a shift from Descartes’ rationalism toward the [[empiricism]] of [[John Locke]] and [[Isaac Newton]]. In the ''Discourse'', d’Alembert rejects a priori, indemonstrable speculations that lead to error and “intellectual despotism” and assumes a method based on hard facts and evidence (xxxv). A main objective of the “Encyclopedia” was not only to organize a collection of known information, but also to establish a cohesive method of gathering facts and principles yet to be discovered. D’Alembert acknowledges that “it is no less difficult to encompass the infinitely varied branches of human knowledge in a truly unified system,” (5), yet despite this seemingly formidable task, D’Alembert succeeds in fulfilling the purpose of the Encyclopedia, which was to gather all the facets of knowledge into one unified text, and to compile knowledge in a way that it could be standardized and compartmentalized into different categories. With this method, d’Alembert believed the ''philosophes'' could create a system of knowledge that would be unified and systematized, but not so rigid and strict as to impose limits on the search for new facts. A classic example of this systematized approach is the aforementioned ''figurative system of human knowledge'', which quantifies knowledge by dividing it into three categories: memory, reason, and imagination. The purpose of this was to place knowledge within general framework that could be added to or expounded upon if necessary. As Richard Schwab, who translated the text, states in the introduction, d’Alembert believed the “Discourse of method” would give mankind the power to independently shape and direct its own destiny. This method provided an answer to the growing demand of the intellectual community of Europe to create a synthesis of information based upon secular and naturalistic principles rather than upon a theological [[teleology]] (xxxi), and to disseminate knowledge throughout the entire population, no longer being restricted to the wealthy, academic elite.

==Quotes==
* "In vain did some philosophers assert, while suppressing their groans in the midst of sufferings, that pain was not an evil at all. In vain did others place supreme happiness in sensuality-of which they nevertheless deprived themselves through fear of its consequences. All of them would have known our nature better if they had been content to limit their definition of the sovereign good of the present life to the exemption from pain, and to agree that, without hoping to arrive at this sovereign good, we are allowed only to approach it more or less, in proportion to our vigilance and the precautions we take."

The '''Rhamu Incident''', on the 29 June 1977, was a brief armed conflict between [[Kenya]] and [[Somalia]], in which the latter invaded the [[Northern Frontier District]] on the eve of the [[Ogaden War]]. A force of 1500 [[Somali people|Somali]] soldiers attacked a [[border post]], and killed 30 [[Kenyan Police|Kenyan police officer]]s and [[Military of Kenya|soldiers]].&lt;ref&gt;Pg 86 - Husein Dualleh - From Barre to Aideed:

[[Rhamu]], situated on the Ethiopian-Kenyan border, lay on the road to the [[Sidamo Province|Sidamo]] region, and was considered a strategic point of entrance. The [[Federal Government of Somalia|Somali government]] denied the invasion, and claimed to have no knowledge of the incident.

The '''Scottish Community Drama Association''' (SCDA) is an association of amateur dramatic clubs throughout [[Scotland]]. It was first founded in 1926. Amateur theatre companies in Scotland have generally presented repertoire in [[English Language|English]], [[Scots Language|Lowland Scots]] and, more occasionally, [[Scottish Gaelic]]. 

The '''SCDA''' was founded during the period of the [[Scottish Renaissance]], a time of increasing calls to revive many of the cultural and political institutions in Scotland which were perceived as moribund at this period, including native theatre. Serious professional theatre in Scotland had more or less lapsed by the 1880s and the first twentieth century attempt to revive it faltered with the demise of [[Alfred Wareing]]'s short-lived [[Glasgow Repertory Theatre]] (founded in 1909) which closed down on the outbreak of [[World War I]]. Its remaining funds were used in the early 1920s to found the amateur [[Scottish National Players]] with the goal to promote native theatre. During the [[interwar years]] all such initiatives had their origins in the [[amateur theatre]] movement, in particular Glasgow's [[Curtain Theatre (Glasgow)|Curtain Theatre]] (1932–39) founded by [[Grace Ballantyne]], [[Scottish People's Theatre]] and [[Glasgow Unity Theatre|Glasgow Unity]]. 

No teaching institutions offered formal provision for training in Scottish styles of performance or [[diction]] until the establishment of the Glasgow College of Dramatic Art in 1950 (as part of the [[Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama|Royal Scottish Academy of Music]]). as a consequence, most of Scotland's ground-breaking mid-twentieth century native actors, such as [[Duncan Macrae (actor)|Duncan Macrae]], [[Roddy McMillan]] or [[Molly Urquhart]], first developed their skills and methods through performance with the more innovative non-professional companies listed above. Similarly, native playwrights who wished to present authentic representations of Scottish life on the stage, such as [[Joe Corrie]], [[Robert McLellan]], [[John Brandane]], [[Ena Lamont Stewart]] and others, first came to attention generally through amateur productions of their plays. 

[[Scots language|Lowland Scots]] playwrights in particular were well served by non-professional theatre at a time when voicing for professional actors in [[Great Britain|Britain]] was dictated by [[received pronunciation]]. Miscasting in professional productions of McLellan's Scots plays was a regular complaint for the playwright, often in contrast to amateur productions of his Scots in which actors without formal training gave sympathetic and authentic delivery of the language. 

After [[James Bridie]]'s establishment of the [[Citizens Theatre]] in 1942, Scotland finally began to develop a native professional theatre. 

After the introduction of [[television]] during the 1950s, the number of amateur companies in Scotland, in common with the situation elsewhere, began to decline from its peak in the 1940s, but it still remains a vigorous part of Scottish cultural life. 

The SCDA has maintained a successful annual one-act drama festival since its inception, with one interregnum of five years (1940–45) during the Second World War.

'''Seder Olam Rabbah''' ({{lang-he-n|סדר עולם רבה}}, "The Great Order of the World") is a 2nd-century CE  [[Hebrew language]] chronology detailing the dates of biblical events from the Creation to [[Alexander the Great]]'s conquest of Persia. It adds no stories beyond what is in the biblical text, and addresses such questions as the age of Isaac at the binding and the number of years that Joshua led the Israelites. Tradition considers it to have been written about 160 CE by [[Yose ben Halafta]], which is not unreasonable, but it was probably also supplemented and edited at a later period {{Harv|Strack|1991}}. In the [[Babylonian Talmud]] this chronicle is several times referred to simply as the "Seder Olam" ([[Shab.]] 88a; [[Yeb.]] 82b; [[Nazir (Talmud)|Nazir]] 5a; [[Meg.]] 11b; [[Ab. Zarah]] 8b; [[Niddah]] 46b), and it is quoted as such by the more ancient Biblical commentators, including [[Rashi]]. But with the 12th century it began to be designated as "Seder Olam Rabbah," to distinguish it from a later, smaller chronicle, ''[[Seder Olam Zuṭa]]''; it was first so designated by [[Abraham ben Nathan]] - also known as Ha-Yarhi (''Ha-Manhig,'' p.&amp;nbsp;2a, Berlin, 1855).

== Structure==
In its present form the ''Seder Olam Rabbah'' consists of 30 chapters, each 10 chapters forming a section, or "gate."

The work is a chronological record, extending from [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]] to the [[revolt of Bar Kokba]] in the reign of [[Hadrian]], the Persian period being compressed into 52 years {{Harv|Strack|1991}}.  The chronicle is complete only up to the time of [[Alexander the Great]]; the period from Alexander to [[Hadrian]] occupies a very small portion of the work—the end of the 30th chapter.

It has been concluded, therefore, that originally the ''Seder Olam'' was more extensive and consisted of two parts, the second of which, dealing with the post-Alexandrian period, has been lost, with the exception of a small fragment that was added by the copyists to the first part.

Many passages quoted in the [[Talmud]] are missing in the edition of the ''Seder Olam'' which has survived.

== Work ==
The author probably designed the work for calendrical purposes, to determine the era of the [[Genesis creation myth|creation]]; his system, adopted as early as the 3rd century, is still followed.  Adhering closely to the Pharisaic interpretations of [[Bible]] texts, he endeavored not only to elucidate many passages, but also to determine certain dates which are not indicated in the Bible, but which may be inferred by calculation.

In many cases, however, he gave the dates according to tradition, and inserted, besides, the sayings and [[halakot]] of preceding rabbis and of his contemporaries.  In discussing Biblical chronology he followed three principles:
# To assume that the intention of the Biblical author was, wherever possible, to give exact dates
# To assign to each of a series of events the shortest possible duration of time, where necessary, in order to secure agreement with the Biblical text
# To adopt the lesser of two possible numbers.

The application of these principles would obviously have had the effect of compressing the Biblical chronology. The following examples will illustrate the manner in which these principles are applied.

== Examples of method ==

The confusion of languages in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] is said to have taken place in the days of [[Peleg]] ({{bibleverse||Genesis|10:25|HE}}). The author concludes that the first year of Peleg's life cannot be meant, as at the time of the confusion Peleg had a younger brother, Joktan, and the latter had several children; nor could it have occurred during the middle years of his life, for Peleg lived 239 years, and the designation "middle years" is not an exact one ({{bibleverse||Genesis|11:18-19|HE}}); had the redactor intended to indicate only a general period, he would have used the phrase "in the days of Peleg and Joktan." The Bible must therefore mean that the confusion of languages took place in the last year of Peleg's life, and by comparing the dates of the previous generations, the author concluded that it occurred 340 years after the [[Biblical flood|Flood]], or 1996 years after the creation of the world.&lt;ref&gt;This is chronologically difficult. Abraham was born at year 1948 after creation, according to Biblical chronology. This means the confusion happened when Abraham was 48 years old. And when Abraham went into Egypt ({{bibleverse||Genesis|12:10|HE}}), he was probably between 80 to 90 years old. This implies that in less than 40 years Egypt was formed with Pharaohs and officials.&lt;/ref&gt;

After dealing in the first 10 chapters with the chronology of the period from the [[Creation according to Genesis|creation]] of the world to the death of [[Moses]], the writer proceeds to determine the dates of the events which occurred after the [[Israelites]], led by [[Joshua]], entered the [[Holy Land]]. Here Biblical chronology presents many difficulties, dates not being clearly given, and in many cases the ''Seder Olam'' was used by the later Biblical commentators as a basis of exegesis. Thus, it is known that from the entry of the Israelites into the Holy Land to the time of [[Jephthah]] a period of 300 years elapsed ({{bibleverse||Judges|11:26|HE}}). By computing the life periods of the [[Biblical judges|Judges]] and assuming that Jephthah sent his message, in which he alluded to the 300 years, in the second year of his rulership, the writer concluded that the reign of Joshua lasted 28 years. It may be added that he placed the making of the image for [[Micah's Idol|Micah]] ({{bibleverse||Judges|27:1|HE}}) and the destruction of nearly the whole [[tribe of Benjamin]] in consequence of the wrong done to the Levite and his concubine in Gibeah ({{bibleverse||Judges|19-21|HE}}) in the time of [[Othniel]].

It is further stated that [[Solomon]] began to build the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] in the fourth year of his reign, 480 years after the [[The Exodus|Exodus]] ({{bibleverse|1|Kings|6:1|HE}}), that is, 440 years after the [[Israelites]] entered the [[Holy Land]]. Thus there was a period of 140 years from the second year of Jephthah to the building of the Temple. The author of the ''Seder 'Olam'' concluded that the forty years during which the Israelites were harassed by the [[Philistines]] ([[Book of Judges|Judges]] 13:1) did not begin after the death of [[Abdon (Judges)|Abdon]], as it would seem, but after that of [[Jephthah]], and terminated with the death of [[Samson]]. Consequently, there was a period of 83 years from the second year of Jephthah to the death of [[Eli (priest)|Eli]], who ruled 40 years ([[I Sam.]] 4:18), the last year of Samson being the first of Eli's judgeship.  At that time the [[Tabernacle (Judaism)|Tabernacle]] was removed from [[Shiloh (Biblical city)|Shiloh]], whither it had been transferred from [[Gilgal]], where it had been for 14 years under [[Joshua]]; consequently it remained at Shiloh for a period of 369 years, standing all that time on a stone foundation. It is also to be concluded that Samuel judged Israel for 11 years, which with the two years of [[Saul]] (ib. 13:2), the 40 of David's reign ([[I Kings]] 2:11), and the four of Solomon's reign, make 57 years, during which the Tabernacle was first at [[Nob, Israel|Nob]], then at [[Gibeon (ancient city)|Gibeon]].

The chronology of the Kings was more difficult, as there were differences to reconcile between the [[Books of Kings|book of Kings]] and [[book of Chronicles]]. Here especially the author applied the principle of "fragments of years" ("shanim meḳuṭṭa'ot"), by which he regarded the remainder of the last year of any king's reign as identical with the first year of his successor's. In the 20th chapter, which closes the second part ("Baba Meẓia"), the author deals with the forty-eight prophets that flourished in the [[land of Israel]]. Beginning with [[Joshua]], the author reviews the whole prophetic period which terminated with [[Haggai]], [[Zechariah (Hebrew prophet)|Zechariah]], and [[Malachi]], elucidating as he proceeds many obscure points. Thus, the prophet mentioned in Judges vi. 8 was, according to the ''Seder 'Olam,'' [[Phinehas]], and the man of God that came to Eli ([[I Sam.]] 2:27) was [[Elkanah (husband of Hannah)|Elkanah]].

The prophecy of [[Obadiah]] occurred in the time of [[Amaziah of Judah|Amaziah]], King of Judah (comp., however, [[Yalḳ.]], Obad.), and those of [[Joel (prophet)|Joel]], [[Nahum]], and [[Habakkuk]] in the reign of [[Manasseh of Judah|Manasseh]]. After devoting the 21st chapter to the prophets that lived before the conquest of the land, to the seven prophetesses, and to the seven prophets of the Gentiles, the author resumes the chronology of the Kings. He continues it to the end of ch. xxvii., where he reaches the destruction of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]], which, according to his computation, occurred after it had existed 410 years, or 3,338 years after the creation of the world. Then follow the 70 years of the Captivity and the 420 years of the [[Second Temple]], which was destroyed, as may be seen, in the year 3828 of the Creation.

The 420 years of the [[Second Temple]] are divided into the following periods: the domination of the [[Persia]]ns at the time when the Temple stood, 34 years; of the [[Greeks]], 180 years; of the [[Maccabees]], 103 years; of the [[Herodian Dynasty|Herods]], 103 years. It can be seen that the allowance, contrary to historical facts, of only 34 years for the Persian domination is necessary if the ''Seder 'Olam'' chronology is to agree with the Pharisaic [[Talmudical]] interpretation (of [[Book of Daniel|Dan.]] 9:24) that the second exile was to take place after 70 Sabbaths of years (= 490 years) from an "issuing forth of a word" to rebuild Jerusalem. If from this period of 490 years the 70 years of the first Captivity is deducted, and the beginning of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]'s domination over the Land of Israel is placed, in accordance with [[Talmudical]] tradition, at 386 years before the destruction of the Second Temple, then there remain only 34 for the Persian rule. Alternatively, what seems to be a historical inaccuracy in ''Seder ‘Olam'' has been explained in a different way. According to [[Rashi|RASHI]],&lt;ref&gt;RASHI’s commentary on the Bablylonian Talmud (Avodah Zarah 9a, s.v. מלכות פרס בפני הבית)&lt;/ref&gt; the 34-year Persian period must be understood in the context of their hegemony over Israel while the Second Temple stood. Meaning, 34 years is the precise timeframe between the building of the Second Temple under Darius (II) in 352 BCE (according to Jewish calculations) and Alexander the Great's rise to power in 318 BCE – collected altogether as 34 years of Persian hegemony over Israel while the Temple stood. This timeframe, therefore, does not signify the end of the dynasties in Persia, but rather of their rule and hegemony over Israel before Alexander the Great rose to power. Likewise, the period of Herodian rule over Israel, namely, 103 years, refers merely to its hegemony over Israel while the Temple was still standing. The beginning of this period is reckoned during Herod the Great's reign in 35 BCE and ends in 68 CE with the destruction of the Second Temple (based on Jewish computations) – although in essence, Herod's dynasty continued long thereafter.

From the destruction of the Second Temple, which, according to the ''Seder 'Olam,'' occurred at the end of the last week of a Sabbatical year, to the suppression of [[Bar Kokba's revolt]] (or the destruction of [[Bethar]]) is given as a period of 52 years. But the text here is very confused and has given rise to various emendations and interpretations, as the historical date for the destruction of the Second Temple is 70 C.E. and that for the conclusion of the [[Bar Kokba revolt]] is 135 C.E. (comp. Salzer in Berliner's ''Magazin,'' 4:141 et seq.).

== Authorship ==
{{Eras of the Halakha}}
Assuming that this "Seder Olam" is the same as the "Seder Olam" mentioned in the [[Talmud]], Jewish authorities generally ascribe its authorship to the well-known Talmudist [[Jose b. Halafta]], on the strength of [[R. Johanan]]'s statement, "The [[tannaim|tanna]] of the 'Seder 'Olam' was R. Jose" ([[Yeb.]] 82b; [[Niddah]] 46b). Johanan's comment is supported by the fact that Jose was known as one who occupied himself with [[Jewish chronology]]; further, many sayings of R. Jose's quoted in the Talmud are paralleled in the ''Seder Olam.'


Objecting, however, that the ''Seder Olam'' often conflicts with opinions of Jose's expressed in the Talmud, that Jose is referred to in it in the third person ("R. Jose said"), and finally that mention is made in it of Talmudists that lived later than Jose, Ratner (''Mabo leha-Seder 'Olam Rabbah,'' Wilna, 1894) concludes that Jose was '''not''' its author; he thinks that Jose was only the principal authority of the ''Seder 'Olam,'' and that Johanan's statement, mentioned above, is similar to another statement made by him—"Any anonymous opinion in the [[Mishnah]] belongs to [[R. Meïr]]" ([[Sanh.]] 86a), although the redactor of the Mishnah was [[Judah I]]. Ratner further supposes that R. Johanan himself compiled the work, following generally the opinion of R. Jose. He endeavors to prove this view by showing that many utterances of R. Johanan are taken from the ''Seder Olam.''

Ratner's objections, however, are answered by other scholars, who think that in the ''Seder 'Olam'' Jose preserved the generally accepted opinions, even when they were contrary to his own, as is clearly indicated in [[Niddah]] (l.c.). Besides, this work, like all the works of the ancient [[Talmudists]], underwent many alternations at the hands of the copyists. Very often, too, finding that the utterance of a later rabbi agreed with the ''Seder 'Olam,'' the copyists inserted the name of that rabbi. A careful examination shows that certain additions are later than the latest midrashim, and it may be that [[Abraham ibn Yarḥi]] (l.c.), [[Isaac Lattes]] (''Sha'are Ẓiyyon,'' p.&amp;nbsp;25), and [[Menahem Meïri]] (introduction to [[Abot]], p.&amp;nbsp;14), who seem to place the redaction of the ''Seder 'Olam'' at the time when the Massektot (tractates) [[Derek Ereẓ Rabbah]], the [[Derek Ereẓ Zuṭa]], the Soferim, and other later treatises were composed, may have referred to the work in its present form.

Besides directly quoting the ''Seder 'Olam,'' the [[Talmud]] often alludes to it under "tanya" (= "we learned") "tana" (= "he learned"), "tanu rabbanan" (= "our teachers learned"), "amar mar" (= "the teacher said"): often the sentences following these phrases are found in the ''Seder 'Olam.'' In addition, many of its passages have been taken into the [[Mishnah]] without any allusion to their source. The ''Seder 'Olam'' is not mentioned in the [[Jerusalem Talmud]], although several passages in the latter are based on it. Finally, many of the sayings of the ''Seder 'Olam'' have been taken into the [[Mekilta]], the [[Sifra]], and the [[Sifre]].

==Editions==
*The ''Seder 'Olam Rabbah'' first appeared at [[Mantua]], in 1514, together with the ''[[Seder 'Olam Zuṭa]],'' the ''[[Megillat Ta'anit]]'', and [[Abraham ibn David]]'s ''Sefer ha-Ḳabbalah.'' It has been reedited several times since then.
*In 1577 the ''Seder 'Olam Rabbah'' and the ''Seder 'Olam Zuṭa'' were published in [[Paris]], with a Latin translation by [[Gilbert Genebrard]]. The former was edited, with a [[Latin language]] translation, notes, and introduction, by John Meyer (Amsterdam, 1699).
*Commentaries on the work were written by [[Jacob Emden]] (with the text, Hamburg, 1757), by [[Elijah Wilna]] (with the text, Shklov, 1801), and by [[Enoch Zundel ben Joseph|Enoch Zundel b. Joseph]] (a double commentary, ''Eẓ Yosef'' and ''Anaf Yosef,'' Wilna, 1845).
*The three latest editions prior to 1906 are those of Ratner (with critical and explanatory notes, Wilna, 1897), A. Marx (who published the first ten chapters, basing the text upon different manuscripts and supplying it with a [[German language]] translation and an introduction; Berlin, 1903), and Jeroham Meïr Leiner (containing the commentaries of Jacob Emden and Elijah Wilna, and the editor's annotations under the title ''Me'r 'Ayin,'' Warsaw, 1904).

==Chronology==
[[Image:Creation of Light Detail 2.png|right|thumb|250px|The Jewish calendar's reference point is traditionally considered to be about one year ''before'' the [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]] of the world.]]

The current [[Hebrew calendar]] year numbering system, which counts years from the [[Dating creation|creation]], has been in use for more than 1000 years.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maimonides]] (Times:Laws of 7th year, chapt 10): For instance this year is ... and which is also counted as 4936 to the creation... is a [[Shemita]] year."&lt;/ref&gt; The year numbering system was adopted sometime before 3925 [[Anno Mundi#Jewish computation|Anno Mundi]] (165 CE), and based on the calculation of Rabbi [[Yose ben Halafta]] during about 160 CE in the book Seder Olam Rabbah.&lt;ref&gt;p.107, Kantor. Note that the book Seder Olam Rabbah has been continuously edited throughout the ages, and probably reached its current version around 806 CE according to the historian [[Leopold Zunz]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The year numbers are based on the computations of dates and periods found in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. In Jewish tradition, "Year 1" is considered to have begun on the 25 of [[Elul]], 6 days before the beginning of "Year 2" on the first of [[Tishrei]], when [[Adam and Eve|Adam]] was created. The new moon of its first month (Tishrei) is designated ''molad tohu'' (meaning new moon of chaos or nothing). By Halafta's calculation [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]] was created during the year [[3761 BCE]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Genesis|2:7|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''Seder Olam Rabbah'' treats the creation of Adam as the beginning of "Year Zero".  This results in a two-year discrepancy between the years given in ''Seder Olam Rabbah'' and the Jewish year used now. For example, ''Seder Olam Rabbah'' gives the year of [[the Exodus]] from Egypt as 2448 [[Anno Mundi|AM]]; but, according to the current system, the year would be 2450 AM.

Despite the computations by Yose ben Halafta, confusion persisted for a long time as to how the calculations should be applied.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leopold Zunz]] On Time and Literature ''Zur Geschichte und Literatur'' opening chapter.&lt;/ref&gt; During 1000, for example, the Muslim chronologist [[al-Biruni]] noted that three different epochs were used by various Jewish communities being one, two, or three years later than the modern epoch.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[The Remaining Signs of Past Centuries]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The epoch seems to have been settled by 1178, when [[Maimonides]], in his work ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'', described all of the modern rules of the Hebrew calendar, including the modern epochal year. His work has been accepted by Jews as definitive, though it does not correspond to the scientific calculations. For example, the Jewish year for the destruction of the [[Solomon's Temple|First Temple]] has traditionally been given as 3338 AM or 421/2 BCE. This differs from the modern scientific year, which is usually expressed using the [[Proleptic Julian calendar]] as 587 BCE. The scientific date takes into account evidence from the ancient Babylonian calendar and its astronomical observations. So, too, according to Jewish computation, the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] occurred in the lunar month of Av in ''anno'' 68 CE, rather than in 70 CE. In this and related cases, a difference between the traditional Jewish year and a scientific date in a Gregorian year or in a [[proleptic Julian calendar]] date results from a disagreement about when the event happened—and not simply a difference between the Jewish and Gregorian calendars (See [[Missing Years (Hebrew calendar)|the "Missing Years" in the Jewish Calendar]] and below, ''Excursus: Jewish Chronology in the Scroll of Antiochus'').

In Jewish thought the counting is usually considered to be to the creation of the world, as has been emphasized in many ancient texts dealing with creation chronology that the six days of creation till man are literal days—including the days before the creation of the sun and earth.&lt;ref&gt;e.g.[[Maimonides]] Guide to the Perplexed (chapt 25): For two reasons, however, we have not done so, and have not accepted the Eternity of the Universe.... [A] mere argument in favour of a certain theory is not sufficient reason for rejecting the literal meaning of a Biblical text, and explaining it figuratively, when the opposite theory [of literalism] can be supported by an equally good argument. [http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp112.htm SacredTexts.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;e.g.[[Nahmanides|Ramban]] on Genesis 1:3, ''And there was light'': ...You should know that the "days" mentioned in the account of Creation, concerning the creating of heaven and earth, were real days, made up of hours and minutes, and there were six of them, like the [regular] six days of the work[week], in accordance with the simple understanding of the verse. (Translator's footnote:) Although there was no sun or moon for the first three days, so "day" cycles as we know them today did not exist then, nevertheless the six days of creation were six periods of twenty-four hours each. ''The Torah: with Ramban's commentary translated, annotated, and elucidated.'' Translated by Rabbi Yaakov Binder in collaboration with Rabbi Yoseph Kamenetsky. Artscroll Mesorah Publications, Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, some understand these days metaphorically.&lt;ref&gt;[[Abraham Isaac Kook|Rabbi A. Kook]] (Orot Hakodesh Book 2 Chapt 537): If these six days were simply six days, why then would they be called "The secrets of creation" and why would it be forbidden to learn them until correctly prepared... The theory of evolution is increasingly conquering the world at this time, and, more so than all other philosophical theories, conforms to the kabbalistic secrets of the world. Evolution, which proceeds on a path of ascendancy, provides an optimistic foundation for the world. How is it possible to despair at a time when we see that everything evolves and ascends? ... [http://www.myjewishlearning.com/ideas_belief/science/Creation/Inflation/Kook.htm My Jewish Learning] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011083858/http://www.myjewishlearning.com/ideas_belief/science/Creation/Inflation/Kook.htm |date=2008-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern epoch year is set at 3761 BCE, taking into account that there is no year zero in the Julian year count.

However Rav Saadiah Gaon (10th Century CE) and Rav Hai Gaon (11th Century CE) note that the years dated to creation cited in the Talmud and in Seder Olam are 1 year off from the modern Hebrew calendar. While the modern Hebrew calendar's Year 1 is from the 25th of Elul in the Year of Chaos (Tohu), the Talmud and Seder Olam's Year 1 is from the 1 Tishrei - the creation of Adam. Thus Year 1 in the Talmud and Seder Olam is actually Year 2 in today's Hebrew Calendar.&lt;ref&gt;Cited by Rabbi [[Abraham bar Hiyya]] in Sefer HaIbbur (Maamar 6, Chapter 7)&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, when calculating to the year of creation from Seder Olam, Taking into account the 1 year mentioned above; as well as the fact that there is no year "0", as the year before 1 CE is 1 BCE, not 0, we arrive at the number 3760 BCE as the Year 1 of the modern Hebrew calendar.

{{hidden begin|border=1px #aaa solid|title={{center|''Excursus'': Jewish Chronology in the Scroll of Antiochus}}}}

According to the Aramaic '''[[Megillat Antiochus|Scroll of Antiochus]]''', from the Second Temple's rebuilding till the 23rd year of the reign of Antiochus Eupator, son of Antiochus Epiphanes who invaded Judaea, there had transpired '''213 years''' in total. Quoting verbatim from that ancient Aramaic record:
 
בִּשׁנַת עַסרִין וּתלָת שְׁנִין לְמִמלְכֵיהּ, בִּשׁנַת מָאתַן וּתלָת עֲסַר שְׁנִין לְבִניַין בֵּית אֱלָהָא דֵיך, שַׁוִּי אַנפּוֹהִי לְמִיסַּק לִירוּשְׁלֵם

Literal translation: ''In the twenty third year of his kingdom, in the two-hundred and thirteenth year of the rebuilding of this, God's house, he (Antiochus Eupator) put his face to go up to Jerusalem.''

This timeframe is taken in conjunction with another date in the [[Seleucid Era]] counting mentioned by [[Josephus]], in his ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' (book 12, chapter 9, section 2). Based on Josephus' record,  Antiochus Eupator began his reign after his father's death (Antiochus Epiphanes) in ''anno'' 149 of the [[Seleucid Era]] (= 162 BCE). Twenty-three years into Antiochus Eupator's reign would have then been ''anno'' 172 of the [[Seleucid Era]], or what was then 139 BCE. Since, according to the Scroll of Antiochus, the Second Temple had already been standing 213 years, this means that the [[Second Temple]] was completed in ''anno'' '''352 BCE''', being what was then the 6th year of the reign of [[Darius I|Darius]] the king (i.e. Darius, the son of Hystaspes), the year in which the king finished its building according to Ezra 6:15. Although this date of the Temple's rebuilding largely disagrees with modern scholarship who base their chronologies upon the [[Babylonian Chronicles]]&lt;ref&gt;Richard A. Parker &amp; Waldo H. Dubberstein, ''Babylonian Chronology 626 BC - AD 75'', Providence 1956&lt;/ref&gt; and its rebuilding in 516 BCE, it is, nonetheless, held by religious Jewish circles as being accurate and reliable, since it is founded upon a tradition passed down generation after generation. The [[Babylonian Chronicles]], however, are known to be lacking in certain regnal years ascribed to some kings, besides disagreeing in other places with the ancient Egyptian records outlining the regnal years of eight successive Persian kings, preserved in the [[Manetho|Third Book of Manetho]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Ancient Fragments'', ed. I. P. Cory, Esq., p. 65, London 1828. Manetho was the high priest and scribe of Egypt who wrote down his history for Ptolemy Philadelphus.&lt;/ref&gt; In Jewish tradition, the Second Temple stood '''420 years''',&lt;ref&gt;Tosefta (''Zevahim'' 13:6); Palestinian Talmud (''Megillah'' 18a), ''et al''.&lt;/ref&gt; meaning, it was destroyed by Titus in the 2nd year of the reign of [[Vespasian]], in 68 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, ''Questions &amp; Responsa'', ''responsum'' # 389; in other editions, ''responsum'' # 234 (Hebrew). Maimonides states explicitly this tradition, putting the destruction of the Second Temple in the lunar month Av, in the year which preceded ''anno'' 380 of the Seleucid era (i.e. 68 CE). See also ''She'harim la'luah ha'ivry'' (Gates to the Hebrew Calendar) by Rahamim Sar-Shalom, 1984 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; For a discussion of subject, see [[Missing years (Jewish calendar)|Missing Years (Jewish Calendar)]] and [[Seder Olam Rabba]].

[[Image:Josip Šišković.jpg|right|170px|thumb|Habsburg army in Siculeni was commanded by general Joseph von Siskovich]]
The '''Massacre at Madéfalva''' took place at '''Csík-Mádéfalva''', [[Principality of Transylvania (1711–1867)|Grand Principality of Transylvania]] (today [[Siculeni]] in [[Romania]]). In [[Latin language|Latin]] ''Siculicidium'' "murder of [[Székely]]s" was a [[mass murder]] committed against Székelys by the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] army in 1764, under [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]].

==History==
In 1763, the Court of [[Vienna]] entrusted general [[Adolf Nikolaus von Buccow]] to set up three Székely and two [[Romanians|Romanian]] regiments to patrol the borders. However, the Székelys were unwilling to give up their hundred-year tradition of soldiering and their [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]]s. Thus, they resisted the forced military draft and organized a revolt against it. Maria Theresa appointed a new general, [[Joseph von Siskovics]], who commanded his soldiers to attack Csík-Madéfalva (present-day [[Siculeni]]), where the Székely leaders were supposed to meet in a council. It was under the darkness of the snowy night of January 7, 1764 that the Habsburg soldiers entered the village and massacred about 400 unsuspecting people, including women and children.

==Consequences==
The following days, the Székely leaders were captured and impeached, while thousands of terrified Székelys started to migrate to [[Moldavia]], where they took refuge in the villages of the [[Csángó]]magyars who had been living there for centuries. In 1774, the Habsburg soldiers took control of an area of Moldavia that would eventually be named [[Bukovina]] and – after the intervention of Count [[András Hadik]] – they pardoned the Székelys there and settled them down. There, the Székelys founded settlements of their own. The five villages of the [[Székelys of Bukovina]] were: Istensegíts ("God help us!", now [[Ţibeni]], 1776), Fogadjisten ("Accept God's will!", now {{ill|Iacobești, Suceava|lt=Iacobești|ro}}), Józseffalva (now [[Vornicenii Mari]], 1785), Hadikfalva (now [[Dornești]]) and Andrásfalva ([[Măneuţi]], 1786).

==Commemorations==
[[Image:Prosecution document Madefalva.gif|right|thumb|Original prosecution document with Roth Joseph signature]]
[[Image:Siculicidium2.JPG|left|thumb|The [[Chronogram]]]]
The events remained vivid in the Székely collective memory: in 1905, an obelisk was erected at [[Madéfalva]], on its top carrying a [[Turul|Turul-bird]] with the wings spread. At the bottom of the stone-pyramid there is a plate with the word ''SICVLICIDIVM'' on it (oddly enough, adding up the values of the letters as [[Roman numerals]], the result is exactly the year of the massacre).

Since the [[Székelys of Bukovina]] came into existence as a consequence of the events of January 7, 1764, they celebrate this day as the community's birthday.

A purpose that is imposed by a human use, such as that of a fork, is called ''[[Intrinsic and extrinsic properties (philosophy)|extrinsic]]''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Natural teleology, common in [[classical philosophy]] but controversial today,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/teleology-biology/ |last=Allen |first=Colin |title=Teleological Notions in Biology |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=2003}}]&lt;/ref&gt; contends that natural entities also have ''intrinsic'' purposes, irrespective of human use or opinion. For instance, Aristotle claimed that an acorn's intrinsic ''[[telos (philosophy)|telos]]'' is to become a fully grown oak tree.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'' 1050a9–17&lt;/ref&gt;

Though ancient [[atomist]]s rejected the notion of natural teleology, teleological accounts of non-personal or non-human nature were explored and often endorsed in ancient and medieval philosophies, but fell into disfavor during the modern era (1600–1900). In the late 18th century, [[Immanuel Kant]] used the concept of telos as a regulative principle in his ''[[Critique of Judgment]]''. Teleology was also fundamental to the speculative philosophy of [[Georg Hegel]].

Contemporary philosophers and scientists are still discussing whether teleological axioms are useful or accurate in proposing modern philosophies and scientific theories. For instance, in 2012, [[Thomas Nagel]] proposed a non-[[Darwinism|Darwinian]] account of [[evolution]] that incorporates impersonal and natural teleological laws to explain the existence of life, [[consciousness]], [[rationality]], and objective value.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Nagel, ''[[Mind and Cosmos]]'', Oxford University Press: 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, the accuracy can also be considered independently from the usefulness: it is a common experience in [[pedagogy]] that a minimum of apparent teleology can be useful in thinking about and explaining Darwinian evolution even if there is no true teleology driving evolution. Thus it is easier to say that evolution "gave" wolves sharp [[canine tooth|canine teeth]] because those teeth "serve the purpose of" [[predation]] regardless of whether there is an underlying nonteleologic reality in which evolution is not an actor with intentions. In other words, because human [[cognition]] and [[learning]] often rely on the narrative structure of stories (with actors, goals, and proximal rather than distal causation), some minimal level of teleology might be recognized as useful or at least tolerable for practical purposes even by people who reject its [[cosmology|cosmologic]] accuracy. 

==Etymology==
The word ''teleology'' builds on the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[wikt:τέλος|τέλος]], ''telos'' (root: τελε-, "end, purpose")&lt;ref&gt;Eric Partridge, [https://books.google.com/books?id=xA9dxrhfa5kC&amp;dq= ''Origins: A Short Etymological Dictionary of Modern English''], Routledge, 1977, p. 4187.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[wikt:-λογία|-λογία]], ''logia'', "a branch of learning". The German philosopher [[Christian von Wolff]] coined the term (in the Latin form "''teleologia''") in 1728 in his work ''Philosophia rationalis, sive logica''.&lt;ref&gt;

==Historical overview==
In western philosophy, the term and concept of teleology originated in the writings of  [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]. Aristotle's [[Four Causes]] give special place to each thing's telos or "final cause." In this, he followed Plato in seeing purpose in both human and sub-human nature.

===Platonic===
In the ''[[Phaedo]]'', [[Plato]] through [[Socrates]] argues that true explanations for any given physical phenomenon must be teleological. He bemoans those who fail to distinguish between a thing's necessary and sufficient causes, which he identifies respectively as [[Four causes#Material cause|material]] and [[Four causes#Final cause|final]] causes (''Phaedo'' 98–99):

{{quote|Imagine not being able to distinguish the real cause, from that without which the cause would not be able to act, as a cause. It is what the majority appear to do, like people groping in the dark; they call it a cause, thus giving it a name that does not belong to it. That is why one man surrounds the earth with a vortex to make the heavens keep it in place, another makes the air support it like a wide lid. As for their capacity of being in the best place they could be at this very time, this they do not look for, nor do they believe it to have any divine force, but they believe that they will some time discover a stronger and more immortal Atlas to hold everything together more, and they do not believe that the truly good and 'binding' binds and holds them together.|Plato, ''Phaedo'' 99}}

Plato here argues that while the materials that compose a body are necessary conditions for its moving or acting in a certain way, they nevertheless cannot be the ''sufficient'' condition for its moving or acting as it does. For example (given in ''Phaedo'' 98), if Socrates is sitting in an Athenian prison, the elasticity of his tendons is what allows him to be sitting, and so a physical description of his tendons can be listed as ''necessary conditions'' or ''auxiliary causes'' of his act of sitting (''[[Phaedo]]'' 99b; ''[[Timaenus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' 46c9–d4, 69e6). However, these are only necessary conditions of Socrates' sitting. To give a physical description of Socrates' body is to say ''that'' Socrates is sitting, but it does not give us any idea why ''it came to be'' that he was sitting in the first place. To say why he was sitting and not ''not'' sitting, we have to explain what it is about his sitting that is ''good'', for all things brought about (i.e., all products of actions) are brought about because the actor saw some good in them. Thus, to give an explanation of something is to determine what about it is good. Its goodness is its ''actual cause''—its purpose, ''[[telos (philosophy)|telos]]'' or "reason for which" (''Timaeus'' 27d8–29a).

===Aristotelian===
[[Aristotle]] argued that [[Democritus]] was wrong to attempt to reduce all things to mere necessity, because doing so neglects the aim, order, and "final cause", which brings about these necessary conditions:

{{quote|[[Democritus]], however, neglecting the final cause, reduces to necessity all the operations of nature. Now, they are necessary, it is true, but yet they are for a final cause and for the sake of what is best in each case. Thus nothing prevents the teeth from being formed and being shed in this way; but it is not on account of these causes but on account of the end....|Aristotle, ''[[Generation of Animals]]'' V.8, 789a8–b15}}

In the ''Physics'' Aristotle rejected Plato's assumption that the universe was created by an intelligent designer using eternal [[Platonic form|forms]] as his model. For Aristotle, natural ends are produced by "natures" (principles of change internal to living things), and natures, Aristotle argued, do not deliberate: 
{{quote|"It is absurd to suppose that ends are not present [in nature] because we do not see an agent deliberating." |Aristotle, ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' 2.8, 199b27-9;&lt;ref name="AristotleOrganon&amp;c2.8"&gt;{{cite book |author=Aristotle |title=The Organon and Other Works| editor=| publisher= Opensource collection.

These Platonic and Aristotelian arguments ran counter to those presented earlier by [[Democritus]] and later by [[Lucretius]], both of whom were supporters of what is now often called [[Accidentalism (philosophy)|accidentalism]]:

{{quote|Nothing in the body is made in order that we may use it. What happens to exist is the cause of its use.|Lucretius, ''[[De rerum natura]]'' (On the Nature of Things), IV, 833; cf. 822–56.}}

==Disfavor==
Since the ''[[Novum Organum]]'' of [[Francis Bacon]], teleological explanations in physical science tend to be deliberately avoided in favor of focus on material and efficient explanations. Final and formal causation came to be viewed as false or too subjective.&lt;ref name="aristotle"&gt;"The received intellectual tradition has it that, in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, revolutionary philosophers began to curtail and reject the teleology of the medieval and scholastic Aristotelians, abandoning final causes in favor of a purely mechanistic model of the Universe." {{Citation|last=Ransom Johnson|first=Monte|title=Aristotle on Teleology|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008}} pp. 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, some disciplines, in particular within evolutionary biology, continue to use language that appears teleological when they describe natural tendencies towards certain end conditions; although some argue that these arguments ought to be, and practicably can be, rephrased in non-teleological forms, others hold that teleological language cannot always be ''easily'' expunged from descriptions in the life sciences, at least within the bounds of practical [[pedagogy]]. This is [[#Biology|discussed further below]].

==Economics==
A teleology of human aims played a crucial role in the work of [[Ludwig von Mises]] especially in the development of his science of [[praxeology]]. More specifically he believed that human action, i.e. purposeful behavior, is teleological based on the presupposition that an individual's action is governed or caused by the existence of their chosen ends. Or in other words an individual selects what they believe to be the most appropriate means to achieve a sought after goal or end. Mises however also stressed that teleology with respect to human action was by no means independent of causality as he states "no action can be devised and ventured upon without definite ideas about the relation of cause and effect, teleology presupposes causality"&lt;ref&gt;https://mises.org/library/ultimate-foundation-economic-science&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern and postmodern philosophy==
Historically, teleology may be identified with the philosophical tradition of [[Aristotelianism]]. The rationale of teleology was explored by [[Immanuel Kant]] in his Critique of Judgement and, again, made central to speculative philosophy by [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] and in the various neo-Hegelian schools{{snd}} proposing a history of our species some consider to be at variance with [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], as well as with the [[dialectical materialism]] of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], and with what is now called [[analytic philosophy]]{{snd}} the point of departure is not so much formal logic and scientific fact but 'identity'. (In [[Hegelianism|Hegel's]] terminology: 'objective spirit'.)

Individual human [[consciousness]], in the process of reaching for autonomy and freedom, has no choice but to deal with an obvious reality: the collective identities (such as the multiplicity of world views, ethnic, cultural and national identities) that divide the human race and set (and always have set) different groups in violent conflict with each other. Hegel conceived of the 'totality' of mutually antagonistic world-views and life-forms in history as being 'goal-driven', that is, oriented towards an end-point in history. The 'objective contradiction' of 'subject' and 'object' would eventually 'sublate' into a form of life that leaves violent conflict behind. This goal-oriented, 'teleological' notion of the 'historical process as a whole' is present in a variety of 20th-century authors, although its prominence declined drastically after the [[Second World War]].

In contrast, teleological based "[[grand narrative]]s" are eschewed by the [[postmodern]] attitude&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean-François Lyotard]], [[The Postmodern Condition|''The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge'']] (1979).&lt;/ref&gt; and teleology may be viewed as reductive, exclusionary and harmful to those whose stories are diminished or overlooked.&lt;ref&gt;Lochhead, Judy (2000). ''Postmodern Music/Postmodern Thought'', p. 6. ({{ISBN|0-8153-3820-1}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Against this postmodern position, [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] has argued that a narrative understanding of oneself, of one's capacity as an independent reasoner, one's dependence on others and on the social practices and traditions in which one participates, all tend towards an ultimate good of liberation. Social practices may themselves be understood as teleologically oriented to internal goods, for example practices of philosophical and scientific inquiry are teleologically ordered to the elaboration of a true understanding of their objects. MacIntyre's book ''[[After Virtue]]'' famously dismissed the naturalistic teleology of Aristotle's 'metaphysical biology', but he has cautiously moved from that book's account of a sociological teleology toward an exploration of what remains valid in a more traditional teleological naturalism.

==Ethics==
Teleology informs the study of [[ethic]]s.

===Business ethics===
{{Main article|Business ethics}}
Business people commonly think in terms of purposeful action as in, for example, [[management by objectives]]. Teleological analysis of business ethics leads to consideration of the full range of [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s in any business decision, including the management, the staff, the customers, the shareholders, the country, humanity and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Business &amp; Professional Ethics for Directors, Executives &amp; Accountants |author=Leonard J. Brooks, Paul Dunn |url=https://books.google.com/?id=9x5Yj3nApN4C&amp;pg=PT169 |page=149 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-0-324-59455-3 |date=2009-03-31 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical ethics===
{{Main article|Medical ethics}}
Teleology provides a moral basis for the professional ethics of medicine, as physicians are generally concerned with outcomes and must therefore know the ''telos'' of a given treatment paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=-5a0nza21ZMC&amp;pg=PA78 |title=Methods in medical ethics |author=Jeremy Sugarman, Daniel P. Sulmasy |page=78 |publisher=Georgetown University Press |isbn=978-0-87840-873-3 |year=2001 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consequentialism===
{{Main article|Consequentialism}}

The broad spectrum of consequentialist ethics, of which [[utilitarianism]] is a well-known example, focuses on the end result or consequences, with such principles as [[utilitarian]] philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]]'s "the greatest good for the greatest number", or the Principle of Utility. Hence, this principle is teleological, but in a broader sense than is elsewhere understood in philosophy. In the classical notion, teleology is grounded in the inherent natures of things themselves, whereas in consequentialism, teleology is imposed on nature from outside by the human will. Consequentialist theories justify inherently what most people would call evil acts by their desirable outcomes, if the good of the outcome outweighs the bad of the act. So, for example, a consequentialist theory would say it was acceptable to kill one person in order to save two or more other people. These theories may be summarized by the maxim "the ends can justify the means."

Consequentialism stands in contrast to the more classical notions of [[deontological ethics]], such as [[Immanuel Kant]]'s [[Categorical Imperative]], and [[Aristotle]]'s [[virtue ethics]] (although formulations of virtue ethics are also often consequentialist in derivation). In deontological ethics, the goodness or badness of individual acts is primary and a desirable larger goal is insufficient to justify bad acts committed on the way to that goal, even if the bad acts are relatively minor and the goal is major (like telling a small lie to prevent a war and save millions of lives). In requiring all constituent acts to be good, deontological ethics is much more rigid than consequentialism, which varies by circumstances.

Practical ethics are usually a mix of the two.  For example, Mill also relies on deontic maxims to guide practical behavior, but they must be justifiable by the principle of utility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/On_Liberty_and_Other_Essays.html?id=m6cQfXCETnIC&amp;redir_esc=y |title=John Stuart Mill On Liberty And Other Essays |author=John Gray, Ed. |page=ix |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-283384-7 |year=1998 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science==
{{See also|Four causes#The four causes in modern science}}

In modern science, explanations that rely on teleology are often, but not always, avoided, either because they are unnecessary or because whether they are true or false is thought to be beyond the ability of human perception and understanding to judge.&lt;ref name="aristotle"/&gt; But using teleology as an explanatory style, in particular within evolutionary biology, is still controversial.&lt;ref name="Hanke2004"&gt;{{Cite book |year=2004 |author=Hanke, David |chapter=Teleology: The explanation that bedevils biology |pages=143–155 |title=Explanations: Styles of explanation in science |editor=John Cornwell |place=Oxford &amp; New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-860778-4 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZWpq14vS7WQC&amp;pg=PA143&amp;dq=%22biology+is+sick+%22&amp;q=%22biology%20is%20sick%20%22 |accessdate=18 July 2010 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biology===
{{Main article|Teleology in biology}}

Apparent teleology is a recurring issue in [[evolutionary biology]],&lt;ref&gt;Ruse, M., &amp; Travis, J. (Eds.) (2009). ''Evolution: The First Four Billion Years''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, p. 364&lt;/ref&gt; much to the consternation of some writers.&lt;ref name="Hanke2004"/&gt;

Statements which imply that nature has goals, for example where a species is said to do something "in order to" achieve survival, appear teleological, and therefore invalid. Usually, it is possible to rewrite such sentences to avoid the apparent teleology. Some biology courses have incorporated exercises requiring students to rephrase such sentences so that they do not read teleologically. Nevertheless, biologists still frequently write in a way which can be read as implying teleology even if that is not the intention. These issues have recently been discussed by John Reiss.&lt;ref&gt;Reiss, John O. (2009) ''Not by Design: Retiring Darwin's Watchmaker''. Berkeley, California: University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed| date=September 2011}} He argues that evolutionary biology can be purged of such teleology by rejecting the analogy of natural selection as a [[watchmaker analogy|watchmaker]]; other arguments against this analogy have also been promoted by writers such as [[Richard Dawkins]].&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, Richard (1987) ''The Blind Watchmaker: Why the Evidence of Evolution Reveals a Universe Without Design''. New York: W W Norton &amp; Company&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors, like [[James G. Lennox|James Lennox]], have argued that Darwin was a teleologist,&lt;ref&gt;[[James G. Lennox|Lennox, James G.]] (1993). "Darwin was a Teleologist" ''Biology and Philosophy'', 8, 409-21.&lt;/ref&gt; while others like Michael Ghiselin described this claim as a myth promoted by misinterpretations of his discussions and emphasized the distinction between using teleological metaphors and being teleological.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF00850377 | last1 = Ghiselin | first1 = Michael T. |  year = 1994 | title = Darwin's language may seem teleological, but his thinking is another matter | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/l1324662n645244w/| journal = Biology and Philosophy | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 489–492}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biologist philosopher [[Francisco J. Ayala|Francisco Ayala]] has argued that all statements about processes can be trivially translated into teleological statements, and vice versa, but that teleological statements are more explanatory and cannot be disposed of.&lt;ref name="Ayala 1998"&gt;[[Francisco J. Ayala|Ayala, Francisco]] (1998). "Teleological explanations in evolutionary biology." ''Nature's purposes: Analyses of Function and Design in Biology''. The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karen Neander]] has argued that the modern concept of biological 'function' is dependent upon selection. So, for example, it is not possible to say that anything that simply winks into existence without going through a process of selection has functions. We decide whether an appendage has a function by analysing the process of selection that led to it. Therefore, any talk of functions must be posterior to natural selection and function cannot be defined in the manner advocated by Reiss and Dawkins.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karen Neander|Neander, Karen]] (1998). "Functions as Selected Effects: The Conceptual Analyst's Defense," in C. Allen, M. Bekoff &amp; G. Lauder (Eds.), ''Nature's Purposes: Analyses of Function and Design in Biology'' (pp. 313–333). Cambridge, MA; London, UK: The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ernst Mayr]] states that "adaptedness... is an ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' result rather than an ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' goal-seeking."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst Mayr|Mayr, Ernst W.]] (1992). "The idea of teleology" ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', 53, 117–135.&lt;/ref&gt; Various commentators view the teleological phrases used in modern evolutionary biology as a type of shorthand. For example, S. H. P. Madrell writes that "the proper but cumbersome way of describing change by evolutionary adaptation [may be] substituted by shorter overtly teleological statements" for the sake of saving space, but that this "should not be taken to imply that evolution proceeds by anything other than from mutations arising by chance, with those that impart an advantage being retained by natural selection."&lt;ref&gt;Madrell SHP (1998) Why are there no insects in the open sea? ''The Journal of Experimental Biology'' '''201''':2461–2464.&lt;/ref&gt; [[J. B. S. Haldane]] said, "Teleology is like a mistress to a biologist: he cannot live without her but he's unwilling to be seen with her in public."&lt;ref&gt;Hull, D., Philosophy of Biological Science, Foundations of Philosophy Series, Prentice&amp;ndash;Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N. J., 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, Ernst (1974) Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science, Volume XIV, pp. 91–117.&lt;/ref&gt;

Selected-effects accounts, like the one Neander suggests, face objections due to their reliance on etiological accounts, which some fields lack the resources to accommodate. Many such sciences, which study the same traits and behaviors regarded by evolutionary biology, still correctly attribute teleological functions without appeal to selection history. [[Gualtiero Piccinini]] and Corey J. Maley are a proponent of one such account which focuses instead on goal-contribution. With the objective goals of organisms being survival and inclusive fitness, Piccinini and Maley define teleological functions to be “a stable contribution by a trait (or component, activity, property) of organisms belonging to a biological population to an objective goal of those organisms.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maley|first=Corey J.|last2=Piccinini|first2=Gualtiero|date=2018-01-18|title=A Unified Mechanistic Account of Teleological Functions for Psychology and Neuroscience|url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780199685509.001.0001/oso-9780199685509-chapter-11|journal=Oxford Scholarship Online|language=en|doi=10.1093/oso/9780199685509.003.0011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Cybernetics===
[[Julian Bigelow]], [[Arturo Rosenblueth]], and [[Norbert Wiener]] have conceived of [[feedback]] mechanisms as lending a teleology to machinery. Wiener, a mathematician, coined the term '[[cybernetics]]' to denote the study of "teleological mechanisms."&lt;ref&gt;Cybernetics, or control and communication in the animal and machine' (1948)&lt;/ref&gt; Cybernetics is the study of the [[communication]] and [[control theory|control]] of regulatory feedback both in living beings and machines, and in combinations of the two. In the cybernetic classification presented in "Behavior, Purpose and Teleology", teleology is feedback controlled purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rosenblueth |first1=Arturo |last2=Wiener |first2=Norbert |last3=Bigelow |first3=Julian |title=Behavior, Purpose and Teleology |journal=Philosophy of Science |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=21 |date=Jan 1943 |language=|jstor=184878 |doi=10.1086/286788}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Conway |first=Patrick |title=Development of volitional competence |publisher=MSS Information Corp |year=1974 |pages=60 |isbn=0-8422-0424-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The classification system underlying cybernetics was criticized by [[Frank Honywill George]], who cited the need for an external observability to the purposeful behavior in order to establish and validate the goal-seeking behavior. In this view, the purpose of observing and observed systems is respectively distinguished by the system's subjective [[autonomy]] and objective control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=George| first=Frank Honywill |authorlink=Frank Honywill George|author2=Johnson, Les |title=Purposive behavior and teleological explanations |publisher=Gordon and Breach |url=https://www.amazon.com/Purposive-Behaviour-Teleological-Explanations-Cybernetics/dp/2881241107/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1320201377&amp;sr=1-1 |pages=xII |year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of when the first publicly announced television broadcasts occurred in the mentioned countries. Non-public field tests and closed circuit demonstrations are not included. This list should not be interpreted to mean the whole of a country had television service by the specified date. For example, the United States, Great Britain, Germany, and the former Soviet Union all had operational television stations and a limited number of viewers by the year 1939. However, in those countries, only very few cities in each country had television service. Television broadcasts were not yet available in most places.

'''Triple A''' (an acronym for '''Alianza Apostólica Anticomunista''', '''Apostolic Anticommunist Alliance''') was a Spanish [[Right-wing terrorism|far-right paramilitary]], [[Spanish nationalism|Spanish nationalist]] group active from 1977 to 1982, primarily in the [[southern Basque Country]] but also in the [[French Basque Country]] and [[Barcelona]]. A June 2010 report by the Office for Victims of Terrorism of the [[Basque Government]] attributed eight murders in the [[Basque Autonomous Community]] to the group and linked it to the [[Spanish police]], [[Centro Superior de Información de la Defensa|SECED]] and the [[Guardia Civil]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://elpais.com/diario/2010/03/21/domingo/1269147158_850215.html Luis R. Aizpeolea, "Las otras víctimas"], El País, 21 de octubre de 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The group attacked the satirical magazine ''[[El Papus]]'' in [[Barcelona]], killing one person and injuring 17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/cultura/2015/01/12/54b38580e2704e6c218b456b.html|title=De 'El Papus' a 'Charlie'|author=JOSÉ A.

=={{anchor|Triple A attacks}}Attacks==
This list may be incomplete, because many attacks were never admitted. The acronyms GAE and others ([[Guerrilleros de Cristo Rey]], [[Anti Terrorismo ETA]] or ATE, [[Primera Línea de Fuerza Nueva]], [[Batallón Vasco Español]], [[Grupos Armados Españoles]] and, later, [[Grupos Antiterroristas de Liberación|GAL]] and [[GANE]]) seem to have been used by the same Spanish nationalist networks.

'''William Hunt and Sons''' or '''WHS''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] brand of [[masonry]] tools &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shef.ac.uk/assem/2/2trowel2.html A history of WHS and their role in archaeology]&lt;/ref&gt; and other types of edge tools. The WHS 4" [[Trowel|pointing trowel]] is well known as a standard [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] implement in British [[archaeology]].  

==History==
The founder of the company, William Hunt, was an edge tool maker at [[Rowley Regis]], near [[Dudley]], [[Worcestershire]], in the late 18th century. In 1782 he purchased the Brades Estate at [[Oldbury, West Midlands|Oldbury]], near [[Birmingham]], and established a new works there known as Brades Forge, or simply as The Brades. By 1805 they were also manufacturing steel on the site, which was now known as the Brades Steel Works. Around 1793, Hunt took W. Cliffe into partnership, and for a short period the firm was known as Hunt and Cliffe: this name appears in the company's first ledger, dated 9 May 1794. This partnership dissolved around 1803, and Hunt continued trading on his own account until 1809, when he took his sons into partnership and the firm became known as William Hunt &amp; Sons. 

In 1828 the company acquired William Edwards and Sons (incorporating the Eagle Edge Tool Company), and later the business of Bache Bros,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hildicksmith.com/page11.htm A history of Churchill Forge and the Bache Family]&lt;/ref&gt; spade makers of Churchill Forge, near [[Stourbridge]]. In the late 19th century George Heaton became a major shareholder in the company.

In 1951 the company amalgamated with Nash Tyzack to form Brades Nash Tyzack Industries, and later took over the business of Skelton. In 1962, together with Harrison, they became part of [[Spear &amp; Jackson]], who in 1967 also acquired Edward Elwell Ltd, all the companies coming together as parts of S&amp;J by 1972. In 1985 S&amp;J became part of the [[Neill Tools]] Group based in  [[Sheffield]], who still own the brand today. 

==Brands==
The company's major UK trade marks were BRADES and WHS, but they had many others, some of which, such as Eagle, Giraffe and Pagoda, were only used on tools made for export.

== Archaeological trowels ==
The WHS pointing trowel is prized amongst archaeologists in the [[United Kingdom]] who find its strength useful in digging heavy deposits. In his 1946 book ''Field Archaeology'', [[Richard J. C. Atkinson]] (best known for excavating [[Stonehenge]]), "unequivocally" recommended the use of a trowel for archaeology; during the postwar era, WHS and a competing brand from Bowden were predominant. By 1960, archaeologist Paul Stamper was told that a WHS trowel was a "prerequisite", and by 1999, he deemed it the "industry standard".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stamper |first=Paul |date=April 1999 |title=Only one way to scratch up the dirt |journal=British Archaeology |issue=43 |publisher=[[Council for British Archaeology]] |issn=1357-4442 |url= http://www.britarch.ac.uk/ba/ba43/ba43int.html |accessdate=23 December 2007 }}{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Current Archaeology]]'' summed up the choices:
{{cquote|There are really only two contenders on the single-forged blade market, WHS (UK) and Marshalltown (US). WHS blades are thicker, but consequently become blunt as they start to wear down. Marshalltown blades are sharp, flexible, and strong enough to deal with most types of soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeology.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=section&amp;id=7&amp;Itemid=83 |title=Digs |author=Mark Anderson |publisher=[[Current Archaeology]] |accessdate=23 December 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209112834/http://www.archaeology.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=section&amp;id=7&amp;Itemid=83 |archivedate=9 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2005, the company introduced a new version of its 4" WHS pointing trowel.&lt;ref name="Digger"&gt;{{cite journal |date=January 2006 | title = WHS Trowel bites the dust? | journal = The Digger | url = http://www.bajr.org/diggermagazine/Digger39/4.html | accessdate = 23 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The thinner and more brittle design was designed for the construction industry, and encountered resistance from archaeologists who found it inferior to its predecessor model.&lt;ref name="Digger"/&gt; [[Oxford Archaeology]] indicated it might switch to the American-made [[Marshalltown trowel]]; and [[British Archaeological Jobs Resource]] received complaints of breakages on site. In response, in the summer of 2006, the firm launched a new trowel, marked "Archaeologists' Trowel" on the blade, the design of which took account of archaeologists' concerns and the results of field trials. It incorporated a thicker, stronger blade, higher lift for extra knuckle clearance, and a flattened tang to prevent handle rotation.

'''Zosimus''' ({{lang-el|Ζώσιμος}} {{IPA-el|ˈzosimos|}}; also known by the [[Latin]] name '''Zosimus Historicus''', i.e. "Zosimus the Historian";  fl. 490s–510s) was a Greek historian who lived in [[Constantinople]] during the reign of the [[Eastern Roman Emperor]] [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius I]] (491–518). According to [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]], he was a ''[[comes]]'', and held the office of "advocate" of the imperial treasury.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Zosimus (historian) |volume=28 |page=1044 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Zosimus was also known for condemning [[Constantine]]’s rejection of the pagan gods.

== ''Historia Nova'' ==
Zosimus' ''Historia Nova'' (Ἱστορία Νέα, "New History") is written in Greek in six books. For the period from 238 to 270, he apparently uses [[Dexippus]]; for the period from 270 to 404, [[Eunapius]]; and after 407, [[Olympiodorus of Thebes|Olympiodorus]]. His dependence upon his sources is made clear by the change in tone and style between the Eunapian and Olympiodoran sections, and by the gap left in between them. In the Eunapian section, for example, he is pessimistic and critical of Stilicho; in the Olympiodoran section, he offers precise figures and transliterations from the Latin, and favors Stilicho.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Ancient_Historians.html?id=-9lH60l2FdsC|title=Ancient Historians: A Student Handbook|last=Sorek|first=Susan|date=|publisher=A&amp;C Black|year=2012|isbn=9781441179913|location=|pages=211|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first book sketches briefly the history of the early [[Roman emperors]] from [[Augustus]] to [[Diocletian]] (305); the second, third and fourth deal more fully with the period from the accession of [[Constantius Chlorus]] and [[Galerius]] to the death of [[Theodosius I]];&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; the fifth and sixth, the most useful for historians, cover the period between 395 and 410, when [[Priscus Attalus]] was deposed; for this period, he is the most important surviving non-ecclesiastical source. The work, which breaks off abruptly in the summer of 410 at the beginning of the sixth book, is believed to have been written in 498–518.

The style is characterized by Photius as concise, clear and pure;&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; other historians{{Who|date=September 2014}} have judged his accounts confused or muddled, and valuable only because he preserves information from lost histories.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} The historian's object was to account for the [[decline of the Roman Empire]] from the polytheistic point of view. Zosimus is the only non-Christian source for much of what he reports.

In contrast to [[Polybius]], who had narrated the rise of the Roman Empire, Zosimus documented the events and causes which led to its decline.&lt;ref&gt;i. 57&lt;/ref&gt; Though the decline of the Roman Empire was Zosimus' primary subject, he also discussed events connected with Persian, and Greek history, perhaps in imitation of Polybius. It is clear that Photius and [[Evagrius Scholasticus|Evagrius]] did not have any more of Zosimus' work than what survives today. Yet it is likely that either a part of the work has been lost or, more likely, that Zosimus did not live to finish it; for it does not cover all the areas that Zosimus himself tells us he intended to discuss.&lt;ref&gt;iv. 59. §4, 5, i. 58. §9, iv. 28. §3&lt;/ref&gt; There does not seem much probability in the conjecture that the monks and other ecclesiastics succeeded in suppressing that portion of the work in which the evil influences of their body were to be more especially touched upon.&lt;ref&gt;v. 23. §8; Harles. ad Fabr. vol. viii. p.&amp;nbsp;65; comp. Voss. de Hist. Gr. p.&amp;nbsp;312{{clarify|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the work was thus left incomplete, that circumstance would account for some carelessness of style which is here and there apparent. There may appear some difficulty at first sight, however, in the statement of Photius, that the work, in the form in which he saw it, appeared to him to be a second edition. But it would seem that Photius was under some misapprehension. It is called in the manuscripts ''Historia Nova'' (in what sense is not quite clear). This may perhaps have misled Photius. He himself remarks that he had not seen the first edition.

Zosimus was a polytheist, and is by no means sparing of the faults and crimes of the Christian emperors. In consequence of this his credibility has been fiercely assailed by several Christian writers, and has been sometimes defended merely because his history tended to the discredit of many leading persons in the Christian party. The question does not, as has sometimes been supposed, turn upon the credibility of the historians whom Zosimus followed, for he did not adhere in all cases to their judgment with respect to events and characters. For instance, although Zosimus followed Eunapius for the period 270–404, he entirely differed from Eunapius in his account of [[Stilicho]] and [[Serena (Roman)|Serena]]. Of modern writers, [[Caesar Baronius|Baronius]], [[Lelio Bisciola]], [[Kaspar von Barth|C. v. Barth]], [[Johann Daniel Ritter|J. D. Ritter]], [[Richard Bentley]], and [[G. E. M. de Ste. Croix]], have taken the derogatory side. Bentley in particular speaks of Zosimus with great contempt.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley, ''Remarks upon a late Discourse of Freethinking'', Part. ii. p.&amp;nbsp;21&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, his historical authority has been maintained by Leunclavius, G. B. von Schirach, J. Matth. Schrockh, and Reitemeier.

== Editions ==
The history of Zosimus was first printed in the Latin translation of [[Leunclavius]], accompanied by a defence of the historian (Basel, 1576, fol.). The first two books, in Greek, with the translation of Leunclavius, were printed by H. Stephanus, in his edition of Herodian (Paris, 1581). The first complete edition of the Greek text of Zosimus was that by F. Sylburg (''Scriptores Hist. Rom. Min.'', vol. iii., Frankfurt, 1590). Later editions are those published at Oxford (1679), at Zeitz and Jena, edited by Cellarius, with annotations of his own and others (1679, 1713, 1729). The next edition is that by Reitemeier, who, though he consulted no fresh manuscripts, made good use of the critical remarks of Heyne and other scholars (Leipzig, 1784). Bekker produced a reliable edition in 1837 at Bonn. There is a German translation by Seybold and Heyler, and also an English and a French translation. (Schöll, Gesch. d. Griech. Lit. vol. iii, p.&amp;nbsp;232 ; Fabric. Bibl. Graec. vol. viii. p.&amp;nbsp;62.)

The single good manuscript, in the Vatican Library (MS Vat. Gr. 156), was unavailable to scholars until the mid-19th century. [[Ludwig Mendelssohn]] (Leipzig 1887) edited the first dependable text. The modern standard edition is F. Paschoud ''Zosime: Histoire Nouvelle'' (Paris 1971) which has a French translation, introduction and commentary.  A later edition in English, "Zosimus: New History" a translation with commentary by Ronald T. Ridley,  was published in 1982 by the Australian Association of Byzantine Studies.

'''Élisabeth de Feydeau''' (born 28 July 1966), is a [[France|French]] historian and writer. She is also an expert in fragrance.

== Biography ==

'''Élisabeth de Feydeau de Saint-Christophe''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |url=https://issuu.com/madame-magazine/docs/21_madame_march2014 |title=Elisabeth de Feydeau, la passion du parfum |last=de Noblet |first=Christel |work=Madame |page=39 |date=March 2014 |access-date=12 October 2017 |via=issuu}}&lt;/ref&gt; born '''Mabille de Poncheville''', is the granddaughter of André Mabille de Poncheville, a French poet and writer, and the great-granddaughter of Georges Vidor, a [[shipowner]]. Of this family legacy, she developed from an early age a taste for writing, history, and French culture.

At sixteen, she discovered the emotional power of fragrance when she first smelt ''L'heure bleue'' by [[Guerlain]], which she instant fell in love with. Ever since, she has felt intensely for the world of fragrances, which for her echoed the world of music, and the piano pieces she had studied when she was a child.

After a [[Doctorate]] in history, she became a member of the Commission responsible for Cultural Affairs at the fashion firms [[Chanel]] and [[Bourjois]]. She established and managed the departments there, acquiring her first basic knowledge of the raw materials for fragrance.

After this experience, she decided, in 1997, to found her own firm, "Arty Fragrance", where she started working as a consultant for olfactory and cultural development. She moved on to work for prestigious names in the world of fragrance-making: among others, [[Jean-Paul Gaultier]], [[Chanel]], Christian Dior Perfume, [[L'Oréal]] Paris, and also [[Guerlain]].

She continued her fundamental research work fragrance and wrote books about it: ''Jean-Louis Fargeon, perfumer of Marie-Antoinette'' (2005), ''L'Herbier de Marie-Antoinette'' (2012), ''Les Parfums, histoire, dictionnaire, anthologie'' (2011), ''Les 101 mots du parfums'' (2013)...

Today a well-known expert on perfume, she has been acknowledged as such by famous, high-profile perfume companies. Since 1998, she has been teaching at the "School of Fragrances", in Versailles.

She has put up several exhibitions, such as "Parfums de Promenade", in the "Galerie des Galeries" (Galeries Lafayette, 2001) and at "La Cour des Senteurs de Versailles" (2013). She has also animated workshops and conferences all around the world, particularly in Francophone countries.

In 2011, she introduced the brand "Arty Fragrance by Elisabeth de Feydeau", where she created and commercialized a more confidential line of perfumes, all inspired by the luxury and sophistication of the French 17th and 18th centuries, such as they could be felt, more than anywhere else, at the [[Château de Versailles]]: she has often wandered around in the Park of [[Versailles]], while doing research work for her books. In 2006, she was chosen by the rose-breeder [[Meilland]] to be [[Godparent|godmother]] to the new rose called "[[Petit Trianon]]", along with another perfume-maker, [[Francis Kurkdjian]], with whom she had just recreated the fragrance of French queen [[Marie-Antoinette]]: ''Le Sillage de la Reine''.

Since 2008, she has been holding a blog where she regularly publishes articles about perfumes, perfume-makers - and, in a more general way, about the world of perfumes.
