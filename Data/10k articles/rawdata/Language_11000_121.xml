"'''Amambanda'''" was the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006]], performed predominantly in an [[constructed language|imaginary language]] but with some words in [[English language|English]] by [[Treble (girl group)|Treble]]. This was the second occasion on which a song had been performed with lyrics in an invented language - [[Belgium]] having entered [[Sanomi]] by [[Urban Trad]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2003|2003 Contest]].

The song is an up-tempo number, with many influences from [[African music|African]] and [[flamenco music]]. The lyrics explain that "There is a way/To understand without a language", in keeping with the musical theme of exuberant joy in spite of an apparently insurmountable language barrier.

The title was the cause of much confusion prior to the Contest, with the official CD of entries titling the track "Amanbanda" (with an "n" instead of an "m"). BBC commentary referred to the song as "Amamdangda" briefly, as well as describing the group as "a mother and her two daughters", which was also incorrect as [[Caroline Hoffman]] was not the mother of the two van Dijk sisters, though this comment [[British humour|was sarcastic]] and not taken as literal by listeners.

As the Netherlands had not finished the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2005|2005 Contest]] in the top 10, the song was performed in the semi-final. Here, it was performed seventeenth, following [[Finland]]'s [[Lordi]] with "[[Hard Rock Hallelujah]]" and preceding [[Lithuania]]'s [[LT United]] with "[[We Are The Winners]]". At the close of voting, it had received 22 points, placing 20th in a field of 23 and thus missing out on the final and requiring the Netherlands to qualify from the semi-final at the next Contest.

Immediately following this result, rumours began to circulate that the Netherlands would opt out of the next Contest. These rumours were, however, proven to be untrue as the country began qualification for the 2007 Contest.

It was succeeded as [[Netherlands in the Eurovision Song Contest|Dutch representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2007|2007 Contest]] by [[Edsilia Rombley]] with "[[On Top of the World (Edsilia Rombley song)|On Top of the World]]".

'''Biphobia''' is aversion toward [[bisexuality]] and toward bisexual people as a [[social group]] or as individuals. It can take the form of denial that bisexuality is a genuine sexual orientation, or of negative stereotypes about people who are bisexual (such as the beliefs that they are promiscuous or dishonest). People of any [[sexual orientation]] can experience or perpetuate biphobia.

== Etymology and usage ==
''Biphobia'' is a [[portmanteau word]] patterned on the term ''[[homophobia]]''. It derives from the English [[English prefixes#Neo-classical|neo-classical prefix]] ''bi-'' (meaning "two") from ''bisexual'' and the root ''-phobia'' (from the {{lang-el|φόβος}}, ''phóbos'', "fear") found in ''homophobia''. Along with ''[[transphobia]]'' and ''homophobia'', it is one of a family of terms used to describe [[Bigotry|intolerance]] and discrimination against [[LGBT]] people. The [[Adjective|adjectival]] form ''biphobic'' describes things or qualities related to biphobia, and the less-common noun ''biphobe'' is a label for people thought to harbor biphobia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Eliason, MJ|title=The prevalence and nature of biphobia in heterosexual undergraduate students|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume=26|issue=3|year=1997|pages=317–26|pmid=9146816|doi=10.1023/A:1024527032040}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Biphobia'' need not be a [[phobia]] as defined in [[clinical psychology]] (i.e., an [[anxiety disorder]]). Its meaning and use typically parallel those of ''[[xenophobia]]''.

== Forms ==
=== Denial and erasure ===
Biphobia can lead people to deny that bisexuality is "real", asserting that people who ''identify'' as bisexual are not ''genuinely'' bisexual, or that the phenomenon is far less common than they claim. One form of this denial is based on the [[heterosexist]] view that heterosexuality is the only true or natural sexual orientation. Thus anything that deviates from that is instead either a psychological pathology or an example of anti-social behavior. In these instances, homophobia and biphobia are largely the same.

Another form of denial stems from [[Binary thinking|binary]] views of sexuality: that people are assumed [[Monosexuality|monosexual]], i.e. exclusively homosexual ([[gay]]/[[lesbian]]) or heterosexual ([[Heterosexuality|straight]]). Throughout the 1980s, modern research on sexuality was dominated by the idea that heterosexuality and homosexuality were the only legitimate orientations, dismissing bisexuality as "secondary homosexuality".&lt;ref name="ProQuest"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Managing Heterosexism and Biphobia: A Revealing Black Bisexual Male Perspective|url = https://books.google.com/books?lr=lang_en&amp;id=5iayOla-7qcC&amp;pg=PR3#v=onepage&amp;q=%2522Managing%2520Heterosexism%2520and%2520Biphobia%253A%2520A%2520Black%2520Bisexual%2520Male%2520Perspective|publisher = ProQuest|date = 2008-01-01|isbn = 9780549622482}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In that model, bisexuals are presumed to be either [[The closet|closeted]] lesbian/gay people wishing to appear heterosexual,&lt;ref&gt;Michael Musto, April 7, 2009.

Some people accept the theoretical existence of bisexuality but define it narrowly, as being only the ''equal'' attraction towards both men and women.&lt;ref name="Dworkin"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dworkin, SH |title=Treating the bisexual client|journal=Journal of Clinical Psychology|volume=57|issue=5|year=2001|pages=671–80 | pmid=11304706 |doi=10.1002/jclp.1036}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the many bisexual individuals with unequal attractions are instead categorized as either homosexual or heterosexual. Others acknowledge the existence of bisexuality in women, but deny that men can be bisexual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/do-bisexual-men-really-exist/|title=Do Bisexual Men Really Exist?|access-date=2017-02-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some denial asserts that bisexual behavior or identity is merely a social trend – as exemplified by "[[bisexual chic]]" or [[gender bending]] – and not an intrinsic personality trait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ka'ahumanu|first1=Lani|last2=Yaeger|first2=Rob|title=Biphobia|url=https://lgbt.ucsd.edu/education/biphobia.html|website=LGBT Resource Center UC San Diego|publisher=UC San Diego|accessdate=September 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Same-gender sexual activity is dismissed as merely a substitute for sex with members of the opposite sex, or as a more accessible source of [[sexual gratification]]. [[Situational homosexuality]] in [[Sex segregation|sex-segregated]] environments is presented as an example of this behavior.

Biphobia is common from the heterosexual community, but is frequently exhibited by gay and lesbian people as well, usually with the notion that bisexuals are able to escape oppression from heterosexuals by conforming to social expectations of opposite-gender sex and romance. This leaves some that identify as bisexual to be perceived as "not enough of either" or "not real."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Compulsory Bisexuality?: The Challenges of Modern Sexual Fluidity|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15299710903316661|journal = Journal of Bisexuality|date = 2009-11-13|issn = 1529-9716|pages = 431–449|volume = 9|issue = 3–4|doi = 10.1080/15299710903316661|first = Breanne|last = Fahs}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Australian study conducted by Roffee and Waling in 2016 established that bisexual people faced microaggressions, bullying, and other anti-social behaviors from people within the lesbian and gay community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roffee|first1=James A.|last2=Waling|first2=Andrea|title=Rethinking microaggressions and anti-social behaviour against LGBTIQ+ youth|journal=Safer Communities|date=2016-10-10|volume=15|issue=4|pages=190–201|doi=10.1108/SC-02-2016-0004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Allegations that bisexual men are homophobic ====
One cause of biphobia in the gay male community is that there is an identity political tradition to assume that acceptance of male homosexuality is linked to the belief that men's sexuality is specialized. This causes many members of the gay male community to assume that the very idea that men can be bisexual is homophobic to gay men. A number of bisexual men feel that such attitudes force them to keep their bisexuality in the closet and that it is even more oppressive than traditional heteronormativity. These men argue that the gay male community have something to learn about respect for the individual from the lesbian community, in which there is not a strong tradition to assume links between notions about the origins of sexual preferences and the acceptance thereof. These views are also supported by some gay men who do not like anal sex (sides, as opposed to both tops and bottoms) and report that they feel bullied by other gay men's assumption that their dislike for anal sex is "homophobic" and want more respect for the individuality in which a gay man who does not hate himself may simply not like anal sex and instead prefer other sex acts such as mutual fellatio and mutual male masturbation.&lt;ref&gt;Bi Men: Coming Out Every Which Way, Ron Jackson Suresha, Pete Chvany - 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Social Work Practice with Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender People, Gerald P. Mallon—2017&lt;/ref&gt;

====Claims of bisexuals adapting to heteronormativity====
Some forms of prejudice against bisexuals are claims that bisexuality is an attempt in persecuted homosexuals to adapt to heteronormative societies by adopting a bisexual identity. Such claims are criticized by bisexuals and researchers studying the situation of bisexuals for falsely assuming that same-sex relationships would somehow escape persecution in heteronormative cultures by simply identifying as bisexual instead of homosexual. These researchers cite that all countries with laws against sex between people of the same sex give the same punishment regardless of what sexual orientation the people found guilty identify as, that any countries where same-sex marriage is illegal never allow marriages between people of the same sex no matter if they identify as bisexual instead of homosexual, and that laws against "gay" male blood donors invariably prohibit any man who had sex with other men from donating blood no matter if he identifies as homosexual or as bisexual. The conclusion made by these researchers is that since there is no societal benefit in identifying as bisexual instead of identifying as homosexual, the claim that bisexuals are homosexuals trying to adapt to a heteronormative society is simply false and biphobic and causes bisexuals to suffer a two-way discrimination from both LGBT society and heteronormative society that is worse than the one-way discrimination from heteronormative society that is faced by homosexuals. It is also argue that such two-way discrimination causes many bisexuals to hide their bisexuality to an even greater extent than homosexuals hide their sexuality, leading to underestimations of the prevalence of bisexuality especially in men for whom such assumptions of "really being completely gay" are the most rampant.&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Klein, Karen Yescavage, Jonathan Alexander (2012) "Bisexuality and Transgenderism: InterSEXions of the Others"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abbie E. Goldberg (2016) "The SAGE Encyclopedia of LGBTQ Studies"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Negative stereotypes ===
Many stereotypes about people who identify as bisexual stem from denial or bisexual erasure. Because their orientation is not recognized as valid, they are stereotyped as confused, indecisive, insecure, experimenting, or "just going through a phase".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bisexualindex.org.uk/index.php/Main/ItsJustAPhase "It's Just A Phase" Is Just A Phrase], The Bisexual Index&lt;/ref&gt;

The association of bisexuality with promiscuity stems from a variety of negative stereotypes targeting bisexuals as mentally or socially unstable people for whom sexual relations only with men, only with women, or only with one person at a time is not enough. These stereotypes may result from cultural assumptions that "men and women are so different that desire for one is an entirely different beast from desire for the other" ("a defining feature of [[heterosexism]]"), and that "verbalizing a sexual desire inevitably leads to attempts to satisfy that desire."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pepperminty.com/writing/bis-and-slut-myth.pdf "Bisexuals and the Slut Myth"], presented at the 9th [[International Conference on Bisexuality]]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, bisexuals bear a [[Stigma (sociological theory)|social stigma]] from accusations of cheating on or betraying their partners, leading a [[double life]], being "on the [[Down-low (sexual slang)|down-low]]", and spreading [[sexually transmitted disease]]s such as [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]]. This presumed behavior is further generalized as dishonesty, secrecy, and deception. Bisexuals can be characterized as being "slutty", "easy", indiscriminate, and [[Hypersexuality|nymphomaniacs]]. Furthermore, they are strongly associated with [[polyamory]], [[Swinging (sexual practice)|swinging]], and [[polygamy]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glaad.org/programs/cim/birepresentations.php GLAAD: Cultural Interest Media] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060419203924/http://www.glaad.org/programs/cim/birepresentations.php |date=April 19, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the last being an established heterosexual tradition sanctioned by some religions and legal in several countries. This is despite the fact that bisexual people are as capable of monogamy or [[serial monogamy]] as homosexuals or heterosexuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/strictly-casual/201409/are-bisexuals-really-less-monogamous-everyone-else|title=Are Bisexuals Really Less Monogamous Than Everyone Else?|website=Psychology Today|language=en|access-date=2017-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects ==
The mental and sexual health effects of biphobia on bisexual people are numerous. Studies show that bisexuals are often trapped in between the binaries of heterosexuality and homosexuality, creating a form of invalidation around their sexual identity. This often leads to recognized indicators of mental health issues such as low self-esteem and self-worth. These indicators and pressures to "choose" a [[sexual identity]] can, in many cases, lead to [[depression (mood)|depression]] as they may feel they live in a culture that does not recognize their existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Individual and Social Factors Related to Mental Health Concerns among Bisexual Men in the Midwestern United States|journal = Journal of Bisexuality|date = 2012-01-01|issn = 1529-9716|pmc = 3383005|pmid = 22745591|pages = 223–245|volume = 12|issue = 2|first = Brian|last = Dodge|first2 = Phillip W.|last2 = Schnarrs|first3 = Michael|last3 = Reece|first4 = Omar|last4 = Martinez|first5 = Gabriel|last5 = Goncalves|first6 = David|last6 = Malebranche|first7 = Barbara|last7 = Van Der Pol|first8 = Ryan|last8 = Nix|first9 = J.

While doing research on women at high-risk of HIV infection, one study, from the ''Journal of Bisexuality,'' concluded that bisexual women in the high-risk cohort studied were more likely to engage in various high risk behaviors and were at a higher risk of contracting HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sexual and drug-use risk factors for HIV and STDs: a comparison of women with and without bisexual experiences.|url = http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.89.12.1841|journal = American Journal of Public Health|pages = 1841–1846|volume = 89|issue = 12|doi = 10.2105/ajph.89.12.1841|first = V|last = Gonzales|first2 = K M|last2 = Washienko|first3 = M R|last3 = Krone|first4 = L I|last4 = Chapman|first5 = E M|last5 = Arredondo|first6 = H J|last6 = Huckeba|first7 = A|last7 = Downer|pmc = 1509027}}&lt;/ref&gt; These behaviors have been attributed to the unlikeliness of bisexuals to discuss their sexuality and proper protection with health professionals for fear of judgement or discrimination, leaving them uneducated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.lgbthealtheducation.org/wp-content/uploads/12-054_LGBTHealtharticle_v3_07-09-12.pdf|title = Improving the Health Care of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender People: Understanding and Eliminating Health Disparities|last = Makadon MD|first = Harvey J|date = 2012-07-09|journal = Fenway Institute|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Ard MD, MPH|first2 = Kevin L|publisher = U.S. Department of Health and Human Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] woman filed a lawsuit against the lesbian feminist magazine ''[[Common Lives/Lesbian Lives]]'', alleging discrimination against bisexuals when her submission was not published.&lt;ref name="sdrc.lib.uiowa.edu"&gt;[http://sdrc.lib.uiowa.edu/iwa/findingaids/html/CommonlIves.html Common Lives/Lesbian Lives Records, Iowa Women's Archives, University of Iowa Libraries, Iowa City, Iowa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150821003341/http://sdrc.lib.uiowa.edu/iwa/findingaids/html/CommonlIves.html |date=2015-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of women who were at one time involved in lesbian-feminist activism have since [[Coming out|come out]] as bisexual after realizing their attractions to men. A widely studied example of lesbian-bisexual conflict within feminism was the Northampton Pride March during the years between 1989 and 1993, where many feminists involved debated over whether bisexuals should be included and whether or not bisexuality was compatible with feminism. Common lesbian-feminist critiques leveled at bisexuality were that bisexuality was [[Antifeminism|anti-feminist]], that bisexuality was a form of [[false consciousness]], and that bisexual women who pursue relationships with men were "deluded and desperate." However, tensions between bisexual feminists and lesbian feminists have eased since the 1990s, as bisexual women have become more accepted within the feminist community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Routledge International Encyclopedia of Queer Culture|last= Gerstner|first= David A.|authorlink= |year= 2006|publisher= [[Routledge]]|location= United Kingdom|isbn= 978-0-415-30651-5|page= |pages= 82–3|accessdate=October 3, 2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XS_SnVPixE8C&amp;pg=PA82&amp;lpg=PA82#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, some lesbian feminists such as [[Julie Bindel]] are still critical of bisexuality. Bindel has described female bisexuality as a "fashionable trend" being promoted due to "sexual hedonism" and broached the question of whether bisexuality even exists.&lt;ref name="Bindel"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/julie-bindel/where-is-the-politics-in-_b_1589435.html |title=Where's the Politics in Sex? |publisher=''[[The Huffington Post]]'' |accessdate=2012-10-03 |first=Julie |last=Bindel |date=June 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also made [[tongue-in-cheek]] comparisons of bisexuals to [[Animal fancy|cat fanciers]] and [[Satanism|devil worshippers]].&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/nov/08/lesbianism |title=It's not me. It's you |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |accessdate=2012-10-03 |location=London |first=Julie |last=Bindel |date=November 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lesbian feminist [[Sheila Jeffreys]] writes in ''The Lesbian Heresy'' (1993) that while many feminists are comfortable working alongside gay men, they are uncomfortable interacting with bisexual men. Jeffreys states that while gay men are unlikely to [[Sexual harassment|sexually harass]] women, bisexual men are just as likely to be bothersome to women as heterosexual men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Lesbian Heresy|last= Jeffreys|first= Sheila|authorlink= |year= 1993|publisher= Spinifex Press Pty Ltf|location= [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] |isbn= 1-875559-17-5|page= 124|pages= |accessdate=October 4, 2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0FFWxDu9gn0C&amp;pg=PA124&amp;lpg=PA124#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Donna Haraway]] was the inspiration and genesis for [[cyberfeminism]] with her 1985 essay "A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century" which was reprinted in ''Simians, Cyborgs and Women: The Reinvention of Nature'' (1991). Haraway's essay states that the cyborg "has no truck with bisexuality, pre-oedipal symbiosis, unalienated labor, or other seductions to organic wholeness through a final appropriation of all powers of the parts into a higher unity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egs.edu/faculty/donna-haraway/articles/donna-haraway-a-cyborg-manifesto/ |title=Donna Haraway - A Cyborg Manifesto |publisher=Egs.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-09-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922114218/http://www.egs.edu/faculty/donna-haraway/articles/donna-haraway-a-cyborg-manifesto/ |archivedate=2013-09-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the book ''Feminist Essays'' (2017) by Nancy Quinn Collins states that in the opinion of its author this "is wrong because bisexuality is a sexual orientation, a harmless attraction some people simply have, not something they try to have or do in order to create organic wholeness through a final appropriation of all powers of the parts into a higher unity. Therefore, I [the author] would say that cyborgs can be bisexual, and cyberfeminism can and should be accepting of bisexuality."&lt;ref name="Collins2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nancy Quinn Collins|title=Feminist Essays|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WxOJDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT14|date=15 February 2017|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-1-365-75994-9|pages=14–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Race ===
While the general bisexual population as a whole faces biphobia, this oppression is also aggravated by other factors such as race. In his examination of the bisexual male perspective, ''Managing Heterosexism and Biphobia: A Revealing Black Bisexual Male Perspective'', Grady L. Garner delves into the oppression that he faces as both a black and bisexual male. He explains that the internalization of negative sociocultural messages, reactions, and attitudes can be incredibly distressing as bisexual black males attempted to translate or transform these negative experiences into positive bisexual identity sustaining ones.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Bisexuality in the United States: A Social Science Reader|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=EwcABAApgR8C|publisher = Columbia University Press|date = 2000-01-01|isbn = 9780231102278|first = Paula C.|last = Rust}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experience of bisexual black males is different from that of bisexual white males. As the demands and tribulations of black bisexual males appear to be comparatively more distressing than those that black and white, homo- and heterosexual individual's encounter, this acknowledgement is important and vital to the understanding of biphobia from an intersectional perspective.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

'''Brand architecture''' is the structure of [[brand]]s within an organizational entity. It is the way in which the brands within a company’s portfolio are related to, and differentiated from, one another. The architecture should define the different leagues of branding within the organization; how the [[corporate branding|corporate brand]] and sub-brands relate to and support each other; and how the sub-brands reflect or reinforce the core purpose of the corporate brand to which they belong. Often, decisions about brand architecture are concerned with how to manage a parent brand, and a family of sub-brands – managing brand architecture to maximize [[shareholder value]] can often include using [[brand valuation]] model techniques.

Brand architecture may be defined as an integrated process of brand building through establishing [[brand relationships]] among branding options in the competitive environment. The brand architecture of an organization at any time is, in large measure, a legacy of past management decisions as well as the competitive realities it faces in the marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rajagopal|author2=Romulo Sanchez|year=2004|title=Conceptual analysis of brand architecture and relationships within product categories|journal=Journal of Brand Management|pages=233–247|url=http://www.palgrave-journals.com/bm/journal/v11/n3/abs/2540169a.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

There are three key levels of branding:

* ''[[Corporate branding|Corporate brand]], [[umbrella brand]],'' and ''[[Family branding|family brand]]'' – Examples include [[Virgin Group]] and [[H. J. Heinz Company|Heinz]]. These are consumer-facing brands used across all the firm's activities, and this name is how they are known to all their stakeholders – consumers, employees, shareholders, partners, suppliers and other parties. These brands may also be used in conjunction with product descriptions or sub-brands: for example Heinz Cream of Tomato Soup, or [[Virgin Trains]].
* ''Endorsed brands,'' and ''sub-brands'' – For example, [[Nestle]] [[KitKat]], [[Cadbury Dairy Milk]], [[Sony]] [[PlayStation]] or Polo by [[Ralph Lauren]]. These brands include a parent brand – which may be a corporate brand, an [[umbrella brand]], or a [[Family branding|family brand]] – as an endorsement to a sub-brand or an individual, product brand. The endorsement should add credibility to the endorsed sub-brand in the eyes of consumers.
* ''[[Individual branding|Individual product brand]]'' – For example, [[Procter &amp; Gamble]]’s [[Pampers]] or [[Unilever]]'s [[Dove (toiletries)|Dove]]. The individual brands are presented to consumers, and the parent company name is given little or no prominence. Other stakeholders, like shareholders or partners, will know the producer by its company name.

Procter &amp; Gamble is quoted by many authors as the antithesis of a corporate brand (Asberg and Uggla, Muzellec and Lambkin, Olins).&lt;ref&gt;Asberg &amp; Uggla (2009) The Brand Relationship Cycle: Incorporating Co-Branding into Brand Architecture&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L.Muzellec, M.Lambkin (2009). Corporate Branding And Brand Architecture: A Conceptual Framework. Marketing Theory&lt;/ref&gt; "However, this situation changed in 2012. After more than 150 years of invisibility of the organization for consumer, the brand developed corporate brand promise during the 2012 Olympic games. Commercials are aired on television around a message thanking all the "moms". In addition, each of their products is associated with the brand "PG" in advertisements for products.

A recent example of brand architecture in action &lt;ref name="GM_Brand_Architecture_Reorganized"&gt;[http://lisamerriam.com/general-motors-a-reorganized-brand-architecture-for-a-reorganized-company// GM Reorganized Brand Architecture&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; is the reorganization of the General Motors brand portfolio to reflect its new strategy. Prior to bankruptcy, the company pursued a corporate-endorsed hybrid brand architecture structure, where GM underpinned every brand. The practice of putting the "GM Mark of Excellence" on every car, no matter what the brand, was discontinued in August, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/driveon/post/2009/08/68497806/1 | work=USA Today | first=Chris | last=Woodyard | title=General Motors to remove its 'Mark of Excellence' logos from new cars | date=26 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the run-up to the IPO, the company adopted a multiple brand corporate invisible brand architecture structure.&lt;ref name="Brand-Architecture-Structure-Choices"&gt;[http://lisamerriam.com/brand-architecture-structure-choices// Brand Architecture Structure Choices&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The company's familiar square blue "badge" has been removed from the Web site and advertising, in favor of a new, subtle all-text logo treatment.&lt;ref name="GM_Brand_Architecture_Reorganized"&gt;[http://lisamerriam.com/general-motors-a-reorganized-brand-architecture-for-a-reorganized-company// GM Reorganized Brand Architecture&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of brands==

'''''Ambassador Brands'''''
Those brands that reflect the image of the company are Ambassador Brands. Success or Failure of these brands affect the favorable or unfavorable opinion respectively, of the company.
E.g.: Colgate toothpaste, the market leader in toothpaste segment in India, can be rightly called Ambassador brand.

'''''Piggyback Brands'''''
The nature of these brands is to live on other brands. They are not profit generators but build their image and gain mileage by riding on the back of these brands.
E.g.: Colgate toothbrush is a piggyback brand which survives on the back of Colgate Toothpaste.

'''''Budget Brands'''''
These brands signify those that are welcomed in every home. They do not lower the status of the upper-middle-class families as well as are affordable by the lower-class homes too.
E.g.: Cibaca toothpaste can be described as budget brand which is mainly targeted in rural areas of India.

==Strategic considerations==
Structuring a company brand portfolio can involve choosing a strategy based upon a number of variables, including the business strategy, market trends, competitive tactics, and sources of growth and profit.&lt;ref name="Brand Architecture Strategic Considerations"&gt;http://lisamerriam.com/brand-architecture-strategic-considerations//&lt;/ref&gt; Often [[marketing mix modeling]] is used to help understand the role of brands in a portfolio, and how they support or cannibalize one another. A strong parent brand can be leveraged across multiple sub-brands to help maximize [[Return on Marketing Investment]]. Managing brand architecture to maximize shareholder value can often include using [[brand valuation]] model techniques.

==Job titles==
In the UK, the term "brand architect" is sometimes used, but it is worth noting that the title [[architect]] is a legally protected title controlled by the [[Architects Registration Board]].

'''Bumang''' ({{zh|布芒语}}) is a tonal [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic language]] of [[Yunnan]], [[China]]. It is spoken by about 200 people in Manzhang 曼仗, Mengla District 勐拉地区, [[Jinping Miao, Yao, and Dai Autonomous County|Jinping County]], [[Honghe Prefecture]], [[Yunnan]], [[China]]. Bumang was only recently discovered by Chinese linguist Dao Jie in the mid-2000s. It is closely related to [[Kháng language|Kháng]] (Edmondson 2010).

==Classification==
[[Jerold A. Edmondson]] (2010) considers Bumang and the closely related [[Kháng language]] to be [[Khmuic languages]] based on lexical evidence, while Dao Jie 刀洁 (2007) proposes that Bumang may be a [[Palaungic languages|Palaungic language]].

Although Bumang and [[Mang language|Mang]] have similar names and are both spoken in [[Honghe Prefecture]] of [[Yunnan]] Province in China, they are not closely related and do not appear to be in the same branch together (Edmondson 2010). Whereas Edmondson considers Bumang to likely be a Khmuic language, Mang is not one, and is more closely related to the [[Bolyu language|Bolyu]] and [[Bugan language|Bugan]] languages of southern China.

==Population==
The Bumang autonym is ''{{IPA|bu˨˦maŋ˨˦}}'' (Dao Jie 2007). In China, the Bumang are classified as part of the [[Dai people|Dai]] nationality. Bumang speakers are surrounded by speakers of White Tai ([[Tai Don language|Tai Don]]), Black Tai ([[Tai Dam language|Tai Dam]]), and Pu'er Dai. Bumang women's clothing is identical to that of the [[Kháng language|Kháng]], [[Ksingmul language|Ksingmul]], White Tai, and Black Tai (Edmondson 2010).

Within Manzhang 曼仗,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynszxc.gov.cn/villagePage/vIndex.aspx?departmentid=188916 |title=金平苗族瑶族傣族自治县勐拉乡田头村委会慢仗村 |publisher=Ynszxc.gov.cn |date= |accessdate=2015-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mengla District 勐拉地区, Bumang is spoken in Shangmanzhang 上曼仗 (with 22 households; known in the Bumang language as ''{{IPA|ban˩˨jau˥˩}}'') and Xiamanzhang 下曼仗 (with 49 households). Shangmanzhang 上曼仗 is located in Tiantou Village 田头村, Mengla Township 勐拉乡, while Xiamanzhang 下曼仗 is situated on a state-run rubber plantation (国营橡胶农场) (Dao Jie 2007).

The Bumang are descended from [[Kháng language|Kháng]] people who had immigrated from Vietnam in the 1800s (Edmondson 2010:139).

==Phonology==
Like [[Kháng language|Kháng]], Bumang is a tonal language.

'''Carrier of Record''' (or '''COR'''), refers to the entity that provides [[Public switched telephone network|PSTN]] service for an [[E.164]] number.  The exact definition of who and what is a '''COR''' is ultimately the responsibility of the relevant [[national regulatory authority]].

[[Cantonese]] '''changed tones''' (also called '''pinjam''';&lt;ref name="Yu2007"&gt;{{Harv|Yu|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{zh|first=t|t={{linktext|變|音}}|s={{linktext|变|音}}|p=biànyīn|j=''bin3jam1''|cy=''binyàm''}}) occur when a word's tone becomes a different tone due to a particular context or meaning. A "changed" tone is the tone of the word when it is read in a particular lexical or grammatical context, while the base (or underlying) tone is usually the tone of the word when read in citation.&lt;ref name="Yip&amp;Matthews2000"&gt;{{Harv|Yip and Matthews|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus distinct from [[tone sandhi]], which are automatic modifications of tone created by their phonetic environment, without regard to meaning. In its most common form, it occurs on the final syllable of either a compound word, a reduplicated word, or certain vocative examples, especially in direct address to people such as family members.&lt;ref name="Yip&amp;Matthews2000" /&gt; There are a limited set of [[semantic domain|semantic domains]] where changed tone occurs, generally associated with small things, familiarity, food and disease.&lt;ref&gt;D Jurafsky "On the semantics of Cantonese changed tone or women, matches, and Chinese broccoli", ''Proceedings of the 14th Annual Meeting of the Berkeley Linguistics Society''. Berkeley: Berkeley Linguistics Society.  [https://journals.linguisticsociety.org/proceedings/index.php/BLS/article/viewFile/3357/3055 Available online, accessed 24 May 2018]
&lt;/ref&gt; 

A changed tone usually takes the form of a non-high level, non-mid rising [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]] (i.e. tones 3, 4, 5, and 6 in Jyutping and Yale; see [[Cantonese phonology#Tones|Cantonese phonology]] for further information on the tones in Cantonese) transforming into a mid-rising tone (tone 2); for some speakers, this changed tone is slightly lower than the citation mid-rising tone. For speakers with the high falling tone, this may also become the high level tone via the same process.&lt;ref name="Yu2007" /&gt;  In many speakers, another form of a changed tone used in specific [[vocative case|vocatives]] that may also result in a high level tone (tone 1), rather than in a mid-level tone.&lt;ref&gt;Alan C. L. Yu (publ. pending) "Tonal Mapping in Cantonese Vocative Reduplication", ''Proceedings of the 35th Annual Meeting of the Berkeley Linguistics Society''. Berkeley: Berkeley Linguistics Society.  [http://home.uchicago.edu/~aclyu/papers/BLS35.pdf Available online, accessed 4 November 2011]
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Taishanese]] also exhibits changed tones. It is realized in some cases as an additional high [[floating tone]] to end of the mid level, low level, mid falling and low falling tones; this results in new contours for Taishanese, namely mid rising, low rising, mid dipping and low dipping respectively. The final pitch of these changed tones may be even higher in pitch than the citation high level tone. Another changed tone occurs where the expected tone is replaced by the low falling tone. These two are combined in certain cases, with the result that the expected tone is replaced by the low dipping tone, such as the change of the verb 刷 /tʃat˧/ "to brush" into the noun 刷 /tʃat˨˩˥/ "a brush". &lt;ref name="Taishan_Cheng"&gt;Teresa M. Cheng "The Phonology of Taishan", Journal of Chinese Linguistics, Vol. 1, No. 2 (May 1973), pp. 256-322.  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/23749797]
&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of a high rising tone in marking changed tone in many [[Yue Chinese|Yue varieties of Chinese]] implies one possible origin in diminutive morphemes, much in the same way that [[erhua]] functions in [[Standard Mandarin]] and in the [[Beijing dialect]]. In Cantonese, several diminutive morphemes have been proposed as the original one, among them 兒 /jiː˥/ "son" (in its high level tone form) and 子 /t͡siː˧˥/ "child". Thus the changed tone is the relic of this contraction of the main syllable with this diminutive.&lt;ref name="Yu2007" /&gt;

'''Coffin lock''' is a slang term for a blind panel connector (also called a '''butt-joint fastener''') often used in [[scenic construction]] to join together stage decks or [[scenery]] in a [[butt joint]]. These are two part connectors (male and female) that draw together and lock. The two most common types are the [[cam]] and acceptor and more traditional hook and pin version. These devices generally use a [[hex key]] to operate the locking mechanism via a small diameter hole either through the face or rear of the panel. When locked, the considerable [[mechanical advantage]] offered by the cam or hook holds the panels tightly together. Coffin locks can be installed directly into a [[mortise lock|mortise]] cut into each panel for total concealment except for the locking hole or mounted to the rear of the panels. Many small theatres use stock platforms with coffin locks built into the frames.&lt;ref name="CoffinLock"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.penn-elcom.com/pdf/Penn%20Elcom%20Panel%20Locks%20-%20Technical%20Data%20Sheet%20web.pdf

In [[logic]], the '''comprehension''' of an object is the totality of [[intension]]s, that is, attributes, characters, marks, properties, or qualities, that the object possesses, or else the totality of intensions that are [[relevance|pertinent]] to the  context of a given discussion.  This is the correct technical term for the whole collection of intensions of an object, but it is common in less technical usage to see 'intension' used for both the composite and the primitive ideas.

'''Contrastive linguistics''' is a practice-oriented [[linguistics|linguistic]] approach that seeks to describe the differences and similarities between a pair of languages (hence it is occasionally called "''differential'' linguistics").

== History ==

While traditional linguistic studies had developed comparative methods ([[comparative linguistics]]), chiefly to demonstrate family relations between cognate languages, or to illustrate the historical developments of one or more languages, modern contrastive linguistics intends to show in what ways the two respective languages differ, in order to help in the solution of practical problems. (Sometimes the terms [[diachronic linguistics]] and [[synchronic linguistics]] are used to refer to these two perspectives.) 

Contrastive linguistics, since its inception by [[Robert Lado]] in the 1950s, has often been linked to aspects of [[applied linguistics]], e.g., to avoid [[Linguistic interference|interference]] errors in foreign-language learning, as advocated by Di Pietro (1971)&lt;ref&gt;Di Pietro, R.J. (1971) ''Language Structures in Contrast'', Newbury House.&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[contrastive analysis]]), to assist interlingual transfer in the process of [[translation|translating]] texts from one language into another, as demonstrated by Vinay &amp; Darbelnet (1958)&lt;ref&gt;Vinay, J.P. &amp; Darbelnet, J. (1958) ''Stylistique Comparée du Français et de l'Anglais'', Didier-Harrap.&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently by Hatim (1997)&lt;ref&gt;Hatim, B. (1997) ''Communication across Cultures. Translation Theory and Contrastive Text Linguistics'', University of Exeter Press.&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[translation]]), and to find lexical equivalents in the process of compiling bilingual dictionaries, as illustrated by Heltai (1988)&lt;ref&gt;Heltai, P. (1988) "Contrastive analysis of terminological systems and bilingual technical dictionaries", ''International Journal of Lexicography'' Vol. 1(1) pp. 32-40.&lt;/ref&gt; and Hartmann (1991)&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann, R.R.K. (1991) "Contrastive linguistics and bilingual lexicography", in ''Woerterbuecher/Dictionaries/Dictionnaires. International Encyclopedia of Lexicography'' ed. by F.J. Hausmann et al. (Vol. III, pp. 2854-2859), De Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[bilingual lexicography]]). 

Contrastive descriptions can occur at every level of linguistic structure: speech sounds ([[phonology]]), written symbols ([[orthography]]), word-formation ([[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]), word meaning ([[lexicology]]), collocation ([[phraseology]]), sentence structure ([[syntax]]) and complete discourse ([[textology]]). Various techniques used in [[corpus linguistics]] have been shown to be relevant in intralingual and interlingual contrastive studies, e.g. by 'parallel-text' analysis (Hartmann 1997).&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann, R.R.K. (1997) "From contrastive textology to parallel text corpora: Theory and applications", in ''Language History and Linguistic Modelling. A Festschrift for Jacek Fisiak'' ed. by R. Hickey &amp; S. Puppel. De Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrastive linguistic studies can also be applied to the differential description of one or more varieties within a language, such as styles ([[contrastive rhetoric]]), dialects, registers or terminologies of technical genres.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2201">In [[psychoanalysis]], '''decathexis''' is the withdrawal of [[cathexis]] from an idea or [[Instinct#In psychology|instinctual]] object.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/decathexis-reference/decathexis Paul Denis, 'Decathexis']&lt;/ref&gt;

Decathexis is the process of dis-investment of mental or emotional energy in a person, object, or idea.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Calvin S. ''A Primer of Freudian Psychology''. New York: Mentor, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Narcissism==

In [[narcissistic neurosis]], cathexis is withdrawn from external instinctual objects (or rather their unconscious representations)&lt;ref&gt;J-M Quinodoz, ''Reading Freud'' (2005) p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; and turned on the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] - a process Freud highlighted in the [[Daniel Paul Schreber|Schreber]] case, and linked to the subject's ensuing [[megalomania]].&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Case Histories II'' (PFL 9) p. 208-11&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar decathexis of energy has been linked to the emergence of symptoms of [[hypochondriasis]],&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 262&lt;/ref&gt; as well as of [[melancholia]].&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) p. 266-7&lt;/ref&gt;

[[André Green (psychoanalyst)|André Green]] saw decathexis as the product of the [[death drive]], blanking out the possibility of thinking by a process of what he called de-objectilizing.&lt;ref&gt;J-M Quinodoz, ''Reading Freud'' (2005) p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grief==
Decathexis of the lost person in grief was seen as a regular part of the mourning process by Freud, although later analysts have argued that such decathexis was rather the result of inhibited or partial mourning, not of successful mourning.&lt;ref&gt;Lora H. Tessman, ''The Analyst's Analyst Within'' (2003) p. 236-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
{{quote|text="Childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) is a neurological childhood (pediatric) speech sound disorder in which the precision and consistency of movements underlying speech are impaired in the absence of neuromuscular deficits (e.g., abnormal reflexes, abnormal tone). CAS may occur as a result of known neurological impairment, in association with complex neurobehavioral disorders of known or unknown origin, or as an idiopathic neurogenic speech sound disorder. The core impairment in planning and/or programming spatiotemporal parameters of movement sequences results in errors in speech sound production and prosody." [[American Speech-Language-Hearing Association|American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA)]] Ad Hoc Committee on Apraxia of Speech in Children (2007)&lt;ref name="ASHA 2007"/&gt;}}

There are three significant features that differentiate DVD/CAS from other childhood speech sound disorders. These features are:
* "Inconsistent errors on [[consonants]] and [[vowels]] in repeated productions of [[syllable]]s and words
* Lengthened [[Coarticulation|coarticulatory]] transitions between sounds and syllables
* Inappropriate [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]], especially in the realization of lexical or phrasal stress"&lt;ref name="ASHA 2007"/&gt;

Even though DVD/CAS is a ''developmental'' disorder, it will not simply disappear when children grow older. Children with this disorder do not follow typical patterns of [[language acquisition]] and will need treatment in order to make progress.&lt;ref name="ASHA 2007"/&gt;

==Causes==
DVD/CAS is a [[motor disorder]],  which means that the problem is located in the [[brain]] and its signals, and not in the mouth.&lt;ref name="ASHA"&gt;{{Cite web | title=Childhood Apraxia of Speech | url=http://www.asha.org/public/speech/disorders/childhoodapraxia.htm | publisher =American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA)| accessdate=7 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, the cause is unknown. Possible causes include genetic syndromes and [[Genetic disorder|disorders]].&lt;ref name="ASHA"/&gt;

Birth/prenatal injuries, as well as stroke, can also be causes of DVD/CAS. Furthermore, DVD/CAS can occur as a secondary characteristic to a variety of other conditions.

==Diagnosis==
Developmental verbal dyspraxia can be diagnosed by a [[speech language pathologist]] (SLP) through specific exams that measure oral mechanisms of speech. The oral mechanisms exam involves tasks such as pursing lips, blowing, licking lips, elevating the tongue, and also involves an examination of the mouth. A complete exam also involves observation of the patient eating and talking. Tests such as the Kaufman Speech Praxis test,&lt;ref name="Newmeyer 2007"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Newmeyer AJ, Grether S, Grasha C, etal |title=Fine motor function and oral-motor imitation skills in preschool-age children with speech-sound disorders |journal=Clin Pediatr (Phila) |volume=46 |issue=7 |pages=604–11 |date=September 2007 |pmid=17522288 |doi=10.1177/0009922807299545 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a more formal examination, are also used in diagnosis.&lt;ref name="Newmeyer 2007"/&gt;
A differential diagnosis of DVD/CAS is often not possible for children under the age of 2 years old. Even when children are between 2–3 years, a clear diagnosis cannot always occur, because at this age, they may still be unable to focus on, or cooperate with, diagnostic testing.&lt;ref name="Grigos 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grigos|first=Maria I.|author2=Kolenda, Nicole|title=The relationship between articulatory control and improved phonemic accuracy in childhood apraxia of speech: A longitudinal case study|journal=Clinical Linguistics &amp; Phonetics|date=January 2010|volume=24|issue=1|pages=17–40 |pmid=20030551 |doi=10.3109/02699200903329793|pmc=2891028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
There is no cure for DVD/CAS, but with appropriate, intensive intervention, people with the disorder can improve significantly.&lt;ref name="ASHA 2007"/&gt;

DVD/CAS requires various forms of therapy which varies with the individual needs of the patient. Typically, treatment involves one-on-one therapy with a [[Speech-language pathology|speech language pathologist (SLP)]].&lt;ref name="ASHA"/&gt; In children with DVD/CAS, consistency is a key element in treatment. Consistency in the form of communication, as well as the development and use of oral communication are extremely important in aiding a child's speech learning process.

Many therapy approaches are not supported by thorough evidence; however, the aspects of treatment that do seem to be agreed upon are the following:
*Treatment needs to be intense and highly individualized, with about 3-5 therapy sessions each week
*A maximum of 30 minutes per session is best for young children
*Principles of [[motor learning]] theory and intense speech-motor practice seem to be the most effective
*Non-speech oral motor therapy is not necessary or sufficient
*A [[multisensory integration|multi-sensory approach]] to therapy may be beneficial:&lt;ref name="Newmeyer 2009"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Newmeyer AJ, Aylward C, Akers R, etal |title=Results of the Sensory Profile in children with suspected childhood apraxia of speech |journal=Phys Occup Ther Pediatr |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=203–18 |year=2009 |pmid=19401932 |doi=10.1080/01942630902805202 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; using [[sign language]], [[Picture Exchange Communication System|pictures]], [[Sensory cue#Haptic Cues|tactile cues]], [[Sensory cue#Visual Cues|visual prompts]], and [[Augmentative and alternative Communication|Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC)]] can be helpful.&lt;ref name="ASHA 2007"/&gt;

Although these aspects of treatment are supported by much clinical documentation, they lack evidence from systematic research studies. In ASHA's position statement on DVD/CAS,&lt;ref name="ASHA 2007"/&gt; ASHA states there is a critical need for collaborative, interdisciplinary, and programmatic research on the neural substrates, behavioral correlates, and treatment options for DVD/CAS.

===Integral stimulation===
One technique that is frequently used to treat DVD/CAS is integral stimulation. Integral stimulation is based on cognitive motor learning, focusing on the cognitive [[motor planning]] needed for the complex motor task of speech. It is often referred to as the "watch me, listen, do as I do" approach and is founded on a multi-step hierarchy of strategies for treatment. This hierarchy of strategies allows the clinician to alter treatment depending upon the needs of the child. It uses various modalities of presentation, emphasizing the auditory and visual modes. Experts suggest that extensive practice and experience with the new material is key, so hundreds of target stimuli should be elicited in a single session. Furthermore, distributed (shorter, but more frequent) and random treatment, which mix target and non-target utterances, produces greater overall learning.

The 6 steps of the hierarchy upon which integral stimulation therapy for children is loosely organized are:"
* The child watches and listens and simultaneously produces the stimulus with the clinician.
* The clinician models, then the child repeats the stimulus while the clinician simultaneously mouths it.
* The clinician models and provides cues and the child repeats.
* The clinician models and the child repeats with no cues provided.
* The clinician elicits the stimulus without modeling, such as by asking a question, with the child responding spontaneously.
* The child produces stimuli in less-directed situations with clinician encouragement, such as in role-play or games".

===Integrated phonological approach===
Another treatment strategy that has been shown to have positive effects is an integrated phonological approach. This approach "incorporates targeted speech production practice into phonological awareness activities and uses letters and phonological cues to prompt speech production".&lt;ref name="McNeill Gillon 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McNeill|first1=B. C.|last2=Gillon|first2=G. T.|last3=Dodd |first3=B.| title=Effectiveness of an integrated phonological awareness approach for children with childhood apraxia of speech (CAS)| journal=Child Language Teaching and Therapy |volume=25| issue=3| year=2009| pages=341–366|doi=10.1177/0265659009339823| url=http://ir.canterbury.ac.nz/bitstream/10092/2375/1/12611373_CLTT2009.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; McNeill, Gillon, &amp; Dodd studied 12 children ages 4–7 with DVD/CAS who were treated with this approach 2x a week for two 6-week blocks of time (separated by a 6-week withdrawal block). They found positive effects for most of the children in the areas of [[speech production]], [[phonological awareness]], word decoding, letter knowledge, and [[spelling]]. These results show that it is clinically productive to target speech production, phonological awareness, letter knowledge, spelling, and reading all at once. This is particularly important since children with DVD/CAS often have continuous problems with reading and spelling, even if their production of speech improves.&lt;ref name="McNeill Gillon 2009"/&gt;

[[File:1916 Linz disinfected POW mail.jpg|thumb|1916 disinfected PoW cover from interned Russian in [[Linz]] handstamped ''Desinfizirt'']]
'''Disinfected mail''' or '''fumigated mail''' is [[mail]] that has had some form of [[disinfection]] or [[fumigation]] applied to it by postal authorities, with the intention of preventing the spread of [[epidemic]]s via letters sent from infected areas.

The usual practice was to puncture the envelope with small holes, often in a grid pattern, or to snip off one or more corners, in order to let the fumigation gases in. In addition, a special [[postal marking]] may note the disinfection process.

The process did not necessarily have a scientific basis; the practice dates from before an understanding of the cause of contagious diseases, and the fumigant was as likely to be based on folklore. For instance, in the [[Middle Ages]] Mediterranean ports such as [[Venice]] would smoke received covers or douse them with [[vinegar]].

The [[cholera]] [[pandemic]]s of the early 19th century led to widespread treatment of mail, although the concern had died down by the 1840s. Mail from the tropics, particularly [[Hawaii]], was treated against [[yellow fever]]. Following the 1898 war in Cuba, the US military government in occupation instigated several policies to reduce the endemic yellow fever problem including disinfection of mail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Espinosa |first=Mariola |title=Epidemic Invasions: Yellow Fever and the Limits of Cuban Independence, 1878-1930 |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |year=2009 |location=Chicago |page=31 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XWYaZrgf-ZcC&amp;pg=PA31 |isbn=0-226-21811-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century some mail was heat-treated to prevent the spread of [[smallpox]].

Most countries have instituted mail fumigation at one point or another, and investigation of the specific incidents is an active  area for [[postal history]]; the Disinfected Mail Study Circle publishes about 300 pages of original research each year in its journal ''Pratique''.

An instance of double disinfection took place in 1900 with the fumigation with [[sulphur dioxide]] of mail from the leper settlement of the [[Molokai|island of Molokai]] and the mail was further fumigated with formaldehyde when it was received in Honolulu. However no instance of infection of post office employee was recorded even though they had handled such non-disinfected leper mail for years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Leper Mail Disinfected |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=1900-11-02 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1900/11/02/archives/leper-mail-disinfected-precaution-in-hawaii-to-guard-against-the.html |format=pdf |accessdate=2013-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Irradiated mail]] is a form of disinfected mail adopted in the [[United States]], in response to the [[2001 anthrax attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mail Delivery to Resume |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214142837/http://www.life.com/image/1142632 |archivedate=2010-12-14 |url=http://www.life.com/image/1142632 |accessdate=2013-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Doris Jean Lamar-McLemore''' (April 16, 1927 – August 30, 2016) was an American teacher who was the last fluent speaker of the [[Wichita language]],&lt;ref name="urlThe Last Living Speaker of Wichita: NPR"&gt;{{cite web

==Early life==
McLemore was born in 1927 in [[Anadarko, Oklahoma]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/localnews/stories/DN-wichita_20met.ART0.State.Edition2.383793f.html "Last fluent speaker of Wichita tribal language preserves what's left."] ''Dallas Morning News.''&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother was Wichita and her father was European-American.&lt;ref name=tulsa&gt;Ruckman, S.

(retrieved 3 Oct 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

McLemore graduated from [[Riverside Indian School]], an [[American Indian boarding school]], in 1947 and worked as a house mother there for 30 years.&lt;ref name=usa/&gt; She married twice and had a son and two daughters.&lt;ref name=usa/&gt; In 1959 McLemore moved back to live near [[Gracemont, Oklahoma]], to live among her relatives. 

==Language preservation work==
In 1962, McLemore met David Rood, a linguist from the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]], and they collaborated to preserve the Wichita language.&lt;ref name=tulsa/&gt;

McLemore taught language classes for the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wichitatribe.com/language_class.htm Wichita Language Class.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702224745/http://www.wichitatribe.com/language_class.htm |date=2010-07-02 }} ''Wichita and Affiliated Tribes.'' 18 Feb 2009 (retrieved 3 Oct 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; and before her death, was collaborating with linguist David Rood to create dictionary and language CDs.&lt;ref name=tulsa/&gt;

"Doris is amazing for being able to retain as much as she does without having anyone to speak it to on a daily basis," said former Wichita tribal chairman, Gary McAdams.&lt;ref name=usa/&gt; She died on August 30, 2016, at the age of 89.&lt;ref name="kswo"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Poolaw|first1=Rhiannon|title=Last Wichita Speaker Passes Away|url=http://www.kswo.com/story/32940602/last-wichita-speaker-passes-away|website=ABC News 7|publisher=KSWO|accessdate=1 September 2016|date=31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dothraki language''' is a [[Constructed language|constructed]] [[fictional language]] in [[George R. R. Martin]]'s fantasy novel series ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' and its television adaptation ''[[Game of Thrones]]'', where it is spoken by the Dothraki, [[nomad]]ic inhabitants of the [[World of A Song of Ice and Fire#Dothraki Sea|Dothraki Sea]]. The language was developed for the TV series by the linguist [[David J. Peterson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Do+you+speak+Dothraki%3F-a0279261433 |title=Do you speak Dothraki? |date=January 30, 2012 |work=[[The New York Times Upfront]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; working off the Dothraki words and phrases in Martin's novels.

{{As of|2011|09}}, the language comprised 3163 words,&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dothraki.com/2011/09/the-header-script/ |title=The Header Script |date=21 September 2011|website=Dothraki.com |accessdate=2011-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; not all of which have been made public. In 2012, 146 newborn girls in the United States were named "Khaleesi", the Dothraki term for the wife of a ''khal'' or ruler, and the title adopted in the series by [[Daenerys Targaryen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wattenberg|first=Laura|title=The Ultimate 'Game of Thrones' Baby Name|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/laura-wattenberg/the-ultimate-game-of-thrones-baby-name_b_3312750.html |accessdate=22 May 2013|newspaper=[[Huffington Post]]|date=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dothraki and [[Valyrian languages|Valyrian]] have been described as "the most convincing fictional tongues since [[Elvish]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The complex linguistic universe of “Game of Thrones”|url=https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21725752-dothraki-and-valyrian-are-most-convincing-fictional-tongues-elvish|accessdate=4 August 2017|work=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
[[File:David J. Peterson by Gage Skidmore.jpg|right|thumb|David J. Peterson, creator of the Dothraki spoken language for ''Game of Thrones'']]

The Dothraki vocabulary was created by [[David J. Peterson]] well in advance of the adaptation. HBO hired the Language Creation Society to create the language, and after an application process involving over thirty [[List of language inventors|conlangers]], David Peterson was chosen to develop the Dothraki language. He delivered over 1700 words to HBO before the initial shooting. Peterson drew inspiration from George R. R. Martin’s description of the language, as well as from such languages as [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Inuktitut]] and [[Swahili language|Swahili]].&lt;ref name=hbo&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dothraki.conlang.org/official-hbo-press-release/ |title=Official HBO Press Release |website=Dothraki.conlang.org|date=April 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David J. Peterson and his development of the Dothraki language were featured on an April 8, 2012 episode of [[CNN]]'s ''[[The Next List]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whatsnext.blogs.cnn.com/2012/04/06/language-creation-for-game-of-thrones/|title='Game of Thrones' linguist: How to create a language from scratch |publisher=CNN What's Next|accessdate=2017-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to create the [[Valyrian languages]] for season 3 of ''Game of Thrones''.  Peterson and his development of Dothraki were also featured on the January 8, 2017 episode of ''[[To Tell the Truth]]''.

===Language constraints===
The Dothraki language was developed under two significant constraints.  First, the language had to match the uses already put down in the books. Secondly, it had to be easily pronounceable or learnable by the actors. These two constraints influenced the grammar and phonology of the language: for instance, as in English, there is no contrast between [[Aspirated consonant|aspirated]] and unaspirated stops.

==Phonology and romanization==
{{See also|Help: IPA for Dothraki}}
David Peterson has said, "You know, most people probably don't really know what Arabic actually sounds like, so to an untrained ear, it might sound like Arabic. To someone who knows Arabic, it doesn't. I tend to think of the sound as a mix between Arabic (minus the distinctive pharyngeals) and Spanish, due to the dental consonants."&lt;ref name=tor&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tor.com/blogs/2010/04/creating-dothraki-an-interview-with-david-j-peterson-and-sai-emrys |title= Creating Dothraki - An Interview with David J Peterson and Sai Emrys|website=Tor.com |date = April 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the orthography, the Dothraki themselves do not have a writing system&amp;mdash;nor do many of the surrounding peoples (e.g. the [[Lhazar]]een). If there were to be any written examples of Dothraki in the ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' universe, it would be in a writing system developed in the [[Free Cities (A Song of Ice and Fire)|Free Cities]] and adapted to Dothraki, or in some place like [[Ghis]] or [[Qarth]], which do have writing systems.&lt;ref name="wes.ru"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://westeros.ru/?p=3779 |title=Westeros.Ru interview|website=Westeros.ru |date=June 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Consonants ===
There are twenty-three [[consonant]] [[phoneme]]s in the Dothraki language. Here the [[romanized]] form is given on the left, and the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] in brackets.

The letters ''c'' and ''x'' never appear in Dothraki, although ''c'' appears in the [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]] ''ch''. 

''b'' and ''p'' seem to appear only in names, as in ''Bharbo'' and ''Pono''. These consonants were used in the past but have since developed into [f] and [v]. They can still be used as variants of [f] and [v].

Voiceless stops may be [[aspirated consonant|aspirated]]. This does not change word meaning.

The geminates of consonants marked with digraphs have a reduced orthography:
* ''kkh'' is pronounced {{IPA|/xː/}} (not {{IPA|/kx/}})
* ''tth'' is pronounced {{IPA|/θː/}} (not {{IPA|/tθ/}})
* ''ssh'' is pronounced {{IPA|/ʃː/}} (not {{IPA|/sʃ/}})
* ''zzh'' is pronounced {{IPA|/ʒː/}} (not {{IPA|/zʒ/}})
* ''cch'' is pronounced {{IPA|/t͡ʃː/}} (not {{IPA|/tt͡ʃ/}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dothraki.com/2011/09/long-or-doubled-consonants/ |title=» Long (or Doubled) Consonants Dothraki |website=Dothraki.com |date= |accessdate=2017-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.dothraki.org/Phonology |title=Phonology - Dothraki |website=Wiki.dothraki.org |date= |accessdate=2017-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vowels ===
Dothraki has a four vowel system shown below:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Vowels
|-
| '''i''' /i/
|-
| '''e''' /e/
|-
| '''o''' /o/
|-
| '''a''' /a/
|}

There are no diphthongs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.dothraki.org/Phonology |title=Phonology - Dothraki |publisher=Wiki.dothraki.org |date= |accessdate=2017-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dothraki.com/2011/10/accents-in-dothraki/ |title=» Accents in Dothraki Dothraki |website=Dothraki.com |date=2011-10-07 |accessdate=2017-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' books, ''u'' never occurs as a vowel, appearing only after ''q'', and only in names, as in ''Jhiqui'' and ''Quaro''.

In sequence of multiple vowels, each such vowel represents a separate syllable.  Examples: ''shierak'' {{IPA|[ʃi.e.ˈɾak]}} - ''star'', ''rhaesh'' {{IPA|[ɾha.ˈeʃ]}} - ''country'', ''khaleesi'' {{IPA|[ˈxa.l̪e.e.si]}} - ''queen''.

The vowels /i, e, o, a/ turn into [e, ɛ, ɔ, ɑ] after /q/. /o/ turns into [ɤ] after dental consonants.&lt;ref name="dothraki2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dothraki.com/2011/11/qute-noises/ |title=» Qute Noises Dothraki |website=Dothraki.com |date= |accessdate=2017-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxMEbF0eY8 |title=The Art of Language Invention, Episode 7: Romanization Systems |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2015-11-17 |accessdate=2017-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; /o/ can be pronounced as [u] after [g], [k] and [x].&lt;ref name="dothraki2"/&gt;

==Grammar==

===Parts of speech===
Though [[preposition]]s are also sometimes employed, the language is foremost [[inflectional language|inflectional]]. [[Prefix]]es, [[suffix]]es and [[circumfix]]es are all used. [[Verb]]s [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugate]] in [[infinitive]], [[past tense|past]], [[present tense|present]], [[future tense|future]], two [[imperative mood|imperative]]s and (archaic) [[participle]]; they also agree with [[person (grammar)|person]], [[number (grammar)|number]] and [[polarity (grammar)|polarity]]. [[Noun]]s divide into two classes, [[inanimate]] and [[Animacy|animate]]. They [[Declension|decline]] in five [[Grammatical case|case]]s, [[nominative case|nominative]], [[accusative case|accusative]], [[genitive case|genitive]], [[allative case|allative]] and [[ablative case|ablative]]. Animate nouns also decline according to number.&lt;ref name="dothraki101"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.makinggameofthrones.com/production-diary/2010/12/15/dothraki-101.html |title=Dothraki 101 post on HBO's Making Game of Throne's blog|website=Makinggameofthrones.com |date=December 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dothraki presentation at LCC4"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://conference.conlang.org/lcc4/speakers/djplcc4.pdf |title= Dothraki presentation at Language Creation Conference 4|website=Conference.conlang.org|date=August 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Word order===
Basic word order is SVO ([[subject–verb–object]]). In a basic sentence, the order of these elements (when all three are present) is as in English: First comes the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] (S), then comes the verb (V), then comes the [[object (grammar)|object]] (O).
:'''Khal ahhas arakh.''' ''The Khal (S) sharpened (V) the arakh (O).''

When only a subject is present, the subject precedes the verb, as it does in English:
:'''Arakh hasa.'''
:''The arakh (S) is sharp (V).''

In [[noun phrase]]s there is a specific order as well. The order is as follows: [[demonstrative]], noun, [[adverb]], adjective, genitive noun, [[prepositional phrase]]. Prepositions always precede their noun [[complement (grammar)|complements]].{{refn|group="note"|Examples of demonstratives include:
* '''rakh haj''' ''strong boy'' ('''rakh''' boy, '''haj''' strong)
* '''alegra ivezh''' ''wild duck'' ('''alegra''' duck, '''ivezh''' wild)
* '''jin arakh''' ''this arakh'' ('''jin''' this, '''arakh''' arakh (type of blade))
* '''rek hrakkares''' ''that lion'' ('''rek''' that, '''hrakkares''' lion)&lt;ref name="Demonstratives"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dothraki.com/2012/02/demonstratives/ |title=Demonstratives |publisher=Dothraki.com  |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} but [[adjective]]s, [[Possession (linguistics)|possessor]] and [[prepositional phrase]]s all follow the noun:&lt;ref name="Demonstratives"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Adjectives"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.dothraki.org/dothraki/Adjectives |title=Adjectives |publisher=Dothraki.org |date=8 October 2012 |accessdate=2013-06-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617174034/http://wiki.dothraki.org/dothraki/Adjectives |archivedate=June 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:'''jin ave sekke verven anni m'orvikoon'''
:this father very violent of.mine with.a.whip
:''this very violent father of mine with a whip''

Adverbs normally are sentence final, but they can also immediately follow the verb. [[Modal particle]]s precede the verb.&lt;ref name="dothraki101"/&gt;

In the episode "[[Andy's Ancestry]]" from the United States television show ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'', [[Dwight Schrute]] created the Dothraki phrase "throat rip" by placing "throat" in front to make it the accusative.&lt;ref name=EW&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rahman |first=Ray |date=31 May – 7 June 2013 |title=My Weird TV Job: The Guy Who Makes Up Languages for ''Game of Thrones'' and ''Defiance'' |journal=Entertainment Weekly |issue=#1261/1262 |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2013/05/24/guy-who-makes-languages-game-thrones-and-defiance |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150408015202/http://www.ew.com/article/2013/05/24/guy-who-makes-languages-game-thrones-and-defiance |archivedate=2015-04-08 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David J. Peterson]] adapted that language technique and called it the "Schrutean compound".&lt;ref name=EW/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dothraki.com/2012/10/dothraki-on-the-office/|title=Dothraki on The Office|website=Dothraki.com|date=5 October 2012|accessdate=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elizabeth Bates''' (July 26, 1947 – December 13, 2003) was a Professor of [[psychology]] and [[cognitive science]] at the [[UCSD|University of California, San Diego]]. She was an internationally renowned expert and leading researcher in child [[language acquisition]], [[psycholinguistics]], and the [[neurolinguistics|neurological bases of language]], and she authored 10 books and over 200 peer-reviewed articles and book chapters on these subjects.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jagoda |first1=Barry |title=Elizabeth Bates Obituary |url=https://crl.ucsd.edu/bates/obituary/ |website=Center Research in Language: UCSD}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bates was well known for her assertion that linguistic knowledge is distributed throughout the brain and is subserved by general cognitive and neurological processes.

==Biography==
Elizabeth Bates earned a B.A. from [[St. Louis University]] in 1968, and an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] and PhD in [[Developmental psychology|human development]] from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1971 and 1974, respectively.

She was employed as a tenure-track professor at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]] from 1974-1981 before joining the faculty of the [[University of California, San Diego]], where she worked until 2003.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;Bates was one of the founders of the Department of Cognitive Science at UCSD, the first department of its kind in the USA. She was also the director of the UCSD Center of Research in Language and the co-director of the [[San Diego State University]]/UCSD Joint Doctoral Program in Language and Communication Disorders. Bates also served as a visiting professor at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1976-1977 and at the National Research Council Institute of Psychology in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://carta.anthropogeny.org/users/elizabeth-bates|title=Elizabeth Bates {{!}} Center for Academic Research and Training in Anthropogeny (CARTA)|website=carta.anthropogeny.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
On December 13, 2003, Elizabeth Bates died, after a year-long struggle with pancreatic cancer. Over the course of more than thirty years, Bates established herself as a world leader in a number of fields – child development, language acquisition, aphasia research, cross-linguistic research, and adult psycho linguistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dick|first=Frederic|last2=Elman|first2=Jeffrey|last3=Stiles|first3=Joan|date=2004|title=Elizabeth Bates: A scientific obituary|url=http://cogsci-online.ucsd.edu/column_archive/CSO2-1-obituary.pdf|journal=Cognitive Science Online|volume=2|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Elizabeth Bates Graduate Research Fund was established at UCSD in her memory to assist graduate students' research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://crl.ucsd.edu/bates/|title=Elizabeth Bates|website=crl.ucsd.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is survived by her husband and daughter, George and Julia Carnevale.

==Research==
Elizabeth Bates was a pioneer and lead linguist studying how the brain processes language. More specifically, Bates made significant contributions towards the fields of child [[language acquisition]], cross-linguistic language processing, and [[aphasia]], investigating the cognitive, neural, and social linguistic factors subserving these processes. With [[Brian MacWhinney]], Bates developed a model of language processing called the [[competition model]], which views language acquisition as an [[emergentism|emergentist]] phenomenon that results from competition between [[lexical items]], [[Phone (phonetics)|phonological forms]], and [[syntax|syntactic patterns]], accounting for language processing on the [[Synchronic analysis|synchronic]], [[ontogenetic]], and [[phylogenetic]] time scales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bates |first1=Elizabeth |last2=MacWhinney |first2=Brian |title=The Crosslinguistic Study of Sentence Processing |date=1989 |publisher=New York: Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-26196-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was a main proponent of the [[Functional theories of grammar|functionalist]] view of grammar, in that communication is the main force that drives language's natural forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=MacWhinney |first1=B |last2=Bates |first2=E |last3=Kliegl |first3=R |title=Cue validity and sentence interpretation in English, German, and Italian |journal=Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior |date=1984 |volume=23 |page=127-150}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view provides support for Bate's widely known perspective: the brain does not use specialized linguistic centers, but instead employs general cognitive abilities in order to solve a communicative conundrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bates |first1=E |title=Bioprograms and the innateness hypothesis |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |date=1984 |volume=7 |page=188-190}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of her research provided evidence towards the core principles of [[empiricism]] and against the [[Psychological nativism| nativist]] school of thought, which made her a major player in the [[East Pole-West Pole divide]] of [[cognitive psychology]] and [[cognitive neuroscience]].
==== Language Acquisition ====
In defense of communication functioning as a main force of language acquisition, she looked to the prelinguistic use of commands by infants that required them to develop and use social skills. She highlighted the reliance on [[pointing|pointing]] by infants in order to fill their need to communicate before they are able to speak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bates |first1=E |last2=Benigni |first2=L |last3=Bretherton |first3=I |last4=Camaioni |first4=L |last5=Volterra |first5=V |title=The emergence of symbols: Cognition and communication in infancy |journal=New York: Academic Press |date=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; The child's ability to incorporate [[Imperative mood|imperatives]] in their gestures in order to make a command or request was found in her research and shows the necessity of communication regardless of language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bates |first1=E |title=Peer relations and the acquisition of language |journal=Friendship and peer relations |date=1975 |page=259-292}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bates also coined the term [[Wikt:protoword|protoword]], a word-like utterance made by prelinguistic children that has meaning (e.g. yumyum), but does not represent the adult-like form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bates |first1=E |title=Language and Context: The acquisition of pragmatics |journal=New York: Academic Press |date=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When discussing the time period where children begin to speak, Bates received a lot of attention for finding an overwhelming amount of nouns within the first 50 words of a native English speaker's vocabulary.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bates |first1=E |last2=Marchman |first2=V |last3=Thal |first3=D |last4=Fenson |first4=L |last5=Dale |first5=P |last6=Reznick |first6=J. S |last7=et al. |title=Developmental and stylistic variation in the composition of early vocabulary |journal=Journal of Child Language |volume=21 |date=1994 |page=85-124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bates helped settle an ongoing debate among linguists who argued that a referential language style, characterized by the child's first 50 words containing mostly object labels, was a better strategy in developing language than a personal and socially expressive language style. She found that regardless of the strategy applied by the child, they learn words at the same rate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She did, however, find strong predictive power in the child’s vocabulary at 13 and 20 months old and their grammatical complexity at 2 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bates |first1=E |last2=Bretherton |first2=I |last3=Snyder |first3=L |title=From first words to grammar: Individual differences and dissociable mechanisms |journal=Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press |date=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bates finds that language learning comes from the neural plasticity in the brain; therefore, children can and are able to learn a language, even with brain trauma.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bates |first1=Elizabeth |title=Modularity, Domain Specificity and the Development of Language |date=1994 |volume=X |page=136 - 148 |url=https://crl.ucsd.edu/bates/papers/pdf/from-meiti/70-Bates%201994.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==== Neural Plasticity ====
Research in her lab also showed that adult aphasic patients' deficits were not specific to linguistic structures theorized to be localized to specific brain areas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dick|first=F|author2=Bates, E |author3=Wulfeck, B |author4=Utman, JA |author5=Dronkers, N |author6=Gernsbacher, MA |title=Language deficits, localization, and grammar: evidence for a distributive model of language breakdown in aphasic patients and neurologically intact individuals|journal=Psychological Review|date=October 2001|volume=108|issue=4|pages=759–88|pmid=11699116|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.108.4.759}}&lt;/ref&gt; nor were they restricted to the linguistic domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saygin|first=AP|author2=Dick, F |author3=Wilson, SM |author4=Dronkers, NF |author5=Bates, E |title=Neural resources for processing language and environmental sounds: evidence from aphasia.|journal=Brain : A Journal of Neurology|date=April 2003|volume=126|issue=Pt 4|pages=928–45|pmid=12615649 |doi=10.1093/brain/awg082}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lesion sites overlap in the role that they affect speech fluency and complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Borovsky|first=A.|last2=Saygin|first2=A.P.|last3=Bates|first3=E.|last4=Dronkers|first4=N.|date=2007|title=Lesion correlates of conversational speech production deficits|url=|journal=Neuropsychologia|volume=45|pages=2525-2533|doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2007.03.023|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Language is dependent upon basic cognitive processes such as [[memory]], [[pattern recognition]], and [[spreading activation]]. This perspective runs counter to the theory of [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Eric Lenneberg]], and [[Steven Pinker]] that language is a special stimulus that is processed by specific [[language module|language modules]] in the mind such as the localization to the [[Broca's area|Broca's]] and [[Wernicke's area|Wernicke's]] areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bates |first1=Elizabeth |title=Modularity, domain specificity and the development of language |journal=Discussions in Neuroscience |date=1994 |volume=10 |page=136-149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through her research, Bates demonstrated that [[neural plasticity]] allows children with damage to the [[right hemisphere brain damage|right hemisphere]] or the [[Lateralization of brain function|left hemisphere]] to learn and apply language within a normal range of use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bates |first1=Elizabeth |last2=Reilly |first2=Judy |last3=Wulfeck |first3=Beverly |last4=Dronker |first4=Nina |last5=Opie |first5=Meiti |last6=Fenson |first6=Judy |last7=Kriz |first7=Sarah |last8=Jeffries |first8=Rita |last9=Miller |first9=Larae |last10=Herbst |first10=Kathryn |title=DIFFERENTIAL EFFECTS OF UNILATERAL LESIONS ON LANGUAGE PRODUCTION IN CHILDREN AND ADULTS |journal=Brain and Language |date=2001 |volume=79 |issue=2 |page=223-265 |url=https://crl.ucsd.edu/bates/papers/pdf/from-meiti/13-Bates%20et%20al.Diff.Eff.01.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when children are matched in age, sex and [[Socioeconomic status|socioeconomic status]], their use is lower than that of children who did not suffer brain damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stiles |first1=J |last2=Bates |first2=E.A. |last3=Thal |first3=D |last4=Trauner |first4=D |last5=Reilly |first5=J |title=Linguistic, cognitive and affective development in children with pre- and perinatal focal brain injury: A ten-year overview from the San Diego longitudinal project |journal=Advances in infancy research |date=1998 |page=131-164}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same study presented evidence that brain damage has permanent consequences on language use when incurred as an adult. In a comparative study on the Origins of Language Disorders, Bates found that the period between 0 to 5 years of age was important to the argument of neural plasticity as this suggests that reorganization in response to an injury occurs during this period. However, there are limits to brain plasticity. Despite the area that is damaged, whether it be right-frontal or left-frontal, it increases the risk for expressive language delay within 19 months to 30 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bates |first1=Elizabeth |title=Developmental Neuropsychology |journal=Origins of Language Disorders: A Comparative Approach |date=January 1997 |volume=13 |issue=3 |page=458 |doi=10.1080/87565649709540686}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the left-frontal area isn't a unique region that encourages normal language development.

{{Refimprove|date=January 2013}}
An '''expletive attributive''' is an [[adjective]] or [[adverb]] (or adjectival or adverbial phrase) that does not contribute to the [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]] of a sentence, but is used to [[intensifier|intensify]] its emotional force. Often such words or phrases are regarded as [[profanity]] or "bad language", though there are also inoffensive expletive attributives. The word is derived from the [[Latin]] [[verb]] ''explere'', meaning "to fill", and it was originally introduced into English in the seventeenth century for various kinds of [[wikt:padding|padding]].

== Etymology ==
''Expletive'' comes from the [[Latin]] verb ''explere'', meaning "to fill", via ''expletivus'', "filling out". It was introduced into English in the seventeenth century for various kinds of padding—the padding out of a book with peripheral material, the addition of syllables to a line of poetry for metrical purposes, and so forth. Use of ''expletive'' for such a meaning is now rare. Rather, ''expletive'' is a linguistics term for a meaningless word filling a [[syntactic expletive|syntactic vacancy]]. Outside linguistics, the word is commonly used to refer to "bad language" or [[profanity]]. Some linguists use it as shorthand for "expletive attributive".

== Usage ==
{{broaden|section|date=January 2017|reason=Focused on English language}}
There are a large number of [[attributive adjective]]s and adverbs in [[English language|English]] that function as expletives, indicating a speaker's anger, irritation, or in some cases strong approval or other emotion, without otherwise modifying the meaning of the phrase in which they occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first1=Rodney |last1=Huddleston |first2=Geoffrey |last2=Pullum|title=[[The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language]] |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2002 |isbn=0-521-43146-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of an expletive attributive is the word ''[[bloody]]'' as used in the following sentences.

:"You'd better pray for a ''bloody'' miracle if you want to avoid bankruptcy."
:"That was a ''bloody'' good meal."
:"You'd better ''bloody well'' make it happen!"

An expletive attributive is an intensifier. Unlike other adjective or adverb usage, ''[[wikt:bloody|bloody]]'' or ''bloody well'' in these sentences do not modify the meaning of ''miracle'', ''good meal'', or ''make it happen''. The expletive attributives here suggest that the speaker feels strongly about the proposition being expressed.

Other [[vulgarity|vulgar words]] may also be used in this way.

:"The ''goddamn'' policeman tailed me all the ''goddamn'' way home."
:"I ''fucking'' hope he ''fucking'' chokes on his ''motherfucking'' peanuts."

''[[wikt:goddamn|Goddamn]]'', ''[[wikt:fucking|fucking]]'', and ''motherfucking'' do not contribute anything to the meaning. Rather, they suggest the strength of feeling of the speaker.

Other words that are never thought of as offensive can be used in similar ways. For example:

:"I forgot to pay the phone bill twice running, so the ''wretched'' line was cut off."

The phone line discussed may (before it was cut off) have been just as good as any other, and therefore would not have been ''[[wikt:wretched|wretched]]'' in the literal senses of "extremely shoddy", "devoid of hope" or similar. Rather, ''wretched'' serves here as a politer equivalent of expletive ''bloody'' and the like.

== Infixation ==
{{Main|expletive infixation}}
In English, an expletive attributive can be [[infix]]ed (inserted within another word, for "un-bloody-believable", etc.)

[[File:Fujisaki model.png|thumb|An F0 contour is obtained by adding the phrase and accent components to the base frequency]]
The '''Fujisaki model''' is a superpositional model for representing F&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; contour of speech. According to the model, F&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; contour is generated as a result of the superposition of the outputs of two second order linear filters with a base frequency value. The second order linear filters are for generating the phrase and accent components of speech. The base frequency is the minimum frequency value of the speaker.In other words, F&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; contour is obtained by adding base frequency, phrase components and accent components. The model was proposed by [[Hiroya Fujisaki]].

&lt;math&gt;
F_0(t) = \ln(F_b) + \sum_{i=1}^I A_{pi} G_p (t-T_{0i}) + \sum_{j=1}^J A_{aj} \{ G_a (t-T_{1j}) - G_a (t-T_{2j}) \} 
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
where
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
G_p(t) = \alpha^2t \, \exp(-\alpha t) \quad \forall t \geq 0
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
G_a(t) = \min[\gamma, \, 1-(1+\beta t) \, \exp(-\beta t)] \quad \forall t \geq 0
&lt;/math&gt;

'''Seathrún Céitinn''' (c. 1569 – c. 1644; known in English as '''Geoffrey Keating''') was a 17th-century historian. He was born in [[County Tipperary]], Ireland, and is buried in [[Tubrid]] Graveyard in the parish of [[Ballylooby]]-Duhill, and became an Irish [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] priest and a poet.

==Biography==
It was generally believed until recently that Keating had been born in Burgess, [[County Tipperary]]; indeed, a monument to Keating was raised beside the bridge at Burgess, in 1990; but Diarmuid Ó Murchadha writes,

{{quote|The presumption that [Keating] attended a bardic school at Burgess, Co. Tipperary, is attributable to Thomas O'Sullevane, a shadowy character from the fringes of literary circles in London. The same unreliable source names Burgess as Keating's place of birth, whereas recent work (Cunningham 2002) indicates that [[Moorstown Castle]] in the parish of [[Inislounaght Abbey|Inishlounaght]] [in Tipperary] was his probable birthplace."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first = Diarmuid | last = Ó Murchadha | year =2005 | url = http://www.nui.ie/eigse/pdf/vol35/eigse35.pdf | title = A review of some placename material from ''Foras Feasa ar Éirinn | journal = Éigse, A Journal of Irish Studies| volume =  35 | page =  81}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In November 1603, he was one of forty students who sailed for [[Bordeaux]] under the charge of the Rev Diarmaid MacCarthy to begin their studies at the Irish College which had just been founded in that city by Cardinal [[François de Sourdis]], Archbishop of Bordeaux. On his arrival in France he wrote ''Farewell to Ireland'', and upon hearing of the [[Flight of the Earls]] wrote ''Lament on the Sad State of Ireland''. After obtaining the degree of Doctor of Divinity at the [[University of Bordeaux]] he returned about 1610 to Ireland and was appointed to the [[cure of souls]] at Uachtar Achaidh in the parish of [[New Inn, County Tipperary|Knockgraffan]], near [[Cahir]], where he put a stop to the then-common practice of delaying Mass until the neighbouring gentry arrived.

His major work, ''[[Foras Feasa ar Éirinn]]'' (''Foundation of Knowledge on Ireland'', more usually translated ''History of Ireland''), was written in [[Early Modern Irish language|Early Modern Irish]] and completed ca. 1634.

The ''Foras Feasa'' traced the history of Ireland from the creation of the world to the invasion of the [[Normans]] in the 12th century, based on the rich native historical and pseudohistorical traditions (including that of the [[Milesians (Irish)|Milesians]]), historical poetry, annals and ecclesiastical records. The ''Foras Feasa'' circulated in [[manuscript]], as Ireland's English administration would not give authority to have it printed because of its pro-Catholic arguments. It was a time of religious repression; in 1634 a political campaign for a general reform of anti-Catholic laws, known as the [[The Graces (Ireland)|Graces]], was denied by the viceroy. 

Having [[Old English (Ireland)|Old English]] ancestry, Keating held the political view that Ireland's nobility and natural leadership derived from the surviving Gaelic clan chiefs and Old English landed families who had remained Catholic. He accepted the [[Stuart dynasty]] as legitimate. This had a continuing influence on the politics of the [[Confederate Ireland|Confederate]] and [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] supporters in Ireland until Papal recognition of the Stuarts ended in 1766. Keating continued to influence Irish genealogical writers such as [[John O'Hart]] into the 1800s.

'''Gurdial Singh Rahi''' (''Gurdi'āl Sigh''; 10 January 1933 – 16 August 2016) was a [[Punjabi language]] writer, novelist and Migration Agent from [[Punjab, India]].&lt;ref name="ti"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2000/20000318/windows/main1.htm | title=Life's own voice | date=18 March 2000 | agency=''[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]]'' | accessdate=8 April 2012 | location=Chandigarh}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started his literary career in 1957 with a short story, "Bhaganwale."&lt;ref name=ti/&gt; He became known as a novelist when he published the novel ''[[Marhi Da Deeva]]'' in 1964.&lt;ref name="mdd"&gt;{{cite book | title=Marhi Da Deeva | publisher=Unistar books Pvt. Ltd. | author=Singh, Gurdial | authorlink=Gurdial Singh | year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel was later adapted into the Punjabi film ''[[Marhi Da Deeva (1989 film)|Marhi Da Deeva]]'' in 1989, directed by Surinder Singh. His novel ''Anhe Ghore Da Daan'' was also made into a [[Anhe Ghore Da Daan|film of the same name]] in 2011 by director [[Gurvinder Singh]].&lt;ref name="HTdeath"/&gt; Singh was honoured with the [[Padma Shri]] in 1998&lt;ref name="Padma Awards"/&gt; and [[Jnanpith Award]] in 1999.&lt;ref name="JP99"/&gt;

==Life and work==
===Early life===
Gurdial Singh was born on 10 January 1933 in the village of Bhaini Fateh near [[Jaitu]]&lt;ref name=mdd/&gt; in [[British Punjab]]. His father, Jagat Singh, was a carpenter, and his mother, Nihal Kaur, took care of the household.&lt;ref name=ti/&gt; The young Singh began working as a carpenter at the age of 12 to support his family's poor financial conditions.&lt;ref name=Bajinder&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://expressindia.indianexpress.com/ie/daily/20000316/ina16001.html |newspaper=[[The Indian Express]] |title=From a carpenter to a writer, Singh has come a long way |author=Bajinder Pal Singh  |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; By his own admission, Singh worked 16 hours a day when he took on various jobs such as making wheels for [[bullock cart]]s and [[Sheet metal#Forming processes|metal sheet forming]] for water tanks. Together, he and his father earned {{INRConvert|20}} a day from hard labour.&lt;ref name="ti"/&gt;

In childhood, Singh was interested in painting but gradually he applied himself to a formal education. After successfully persuading Singh's father that his son was worthy of more schooling, Madan Mohan Sharma, the headmaster of a middle school that Singh attended in Jaito, encouraged the young boy to stick with his studies, even though his father thought it was futile. Singh completed his Matric examination while he worked in various day time jobs. At the age of 14, he married Balwant Kaur. In 1962, he took the job of school teacher in Nandpur Kotra which paid him {{INRConvert|60}} in monthly salary. Meanwhile, Singh continued his own education, went on to receive his B.A. in English and History, and followed that up with a M.A. in 1967.&lt;ref name="ti"/&gt;

===Literary career===
Singh started his literary career in 1957 with a short story, "Bhaganwale", which was published in ''Panj Darya'', a magazine edited by [[Mohan Singh (poet)|Mohan Singh]]. His later stories were published in ''Preetlari'', edited by [[Gurbaksh Singh Preetlari|Gurbaksh Singh]].&lt;ref name=ti/&gt; His major work, ''[[Marhi Da Deeva]]'', established his reputation as a novelist. Singh wrote four different versions of the novel over the course of four years, before he decided to publish the fourth and final one in 1964. The various characters Singh portrayed in the novel were recreations of real-life people woven into a fictitious storyline.&lt;ref name=ti/&gt; It was translated into English by [[Sahitya Akademi]] as ''The Last Flicker''.&lt;ref name="HinduApr00"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thehindu.com/2000/04/16/stories/1316129m.htm | title=In recognition of his characters | work=[[The Hindu]] | date=16 April 2000 | accessdate=17 August 2016 | author=Nayar, Rana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Singh's other notable works included the  novels ''Anhoe'' (1966), ''Addh Chanani Raat'' (1972), ''Anhe Ghore Da Daan'' (1976) and ''Parsa'' (1991); collections of short stories, including ''Saggi Phull'' (1962), ''Kutta Te Aadmi'' (1971), ''Begana Pind'' (1985) and ''Kareer Di Dhingri'' (1991); and autobiographies ''Neean Mattiyan'' (1999) and ''Dojee Dehi'' (2000) published in two parts.&lt;ref name=ti/&gt; The novels ''Addh Chanani Raat'' and ''Parsa'' have been translated into English as ''Night of the Half Moon'' (published by Macmillan) and ''Parsa'' by the [[National Book Trust]], respectively.&lt;ref name="HinduApr00"/&gt;

Singh's favourite works included [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s ''[[Anna Karenina]]'', [[Irving Stone]]'s ''[[Lust for Life (novel)|Lust for Life]]'', [[John Steinbeck]]'s ''[[The Grapes Of Wrath]]'', [[Phanishwar Nath 'Renu'|Phanishwar Nath Renu]]'s ''[[Maila Anchal]]'', [[Prem Chand]]'s ''[[Godaan]]'' and [[Yashpal]]'s ''Divya''.&lt;ref name=ti/&gt;

===Awards and honours===
Singh received various awards over the course of his life, including the [[List of Sahitya Akademi Award winners for Punjabi|Sahitya Akademi Award in Punjabi]] in 1975 for the novel ''Adh Chanani Raat'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sahitya-akademi.gov.in/sahitya-akademi/awards/akademi%20samman_suchi.jsp#PUNJABI | title=Akademi Awards (1955-2015) - Punjabi | work=Sahitya Akademi | accessdate=17 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Soviet Land Nehru Award in 1986, the Bhai Veer Singh Fiction Award in 1992, the Shiromani Sahitkar Award in 1992,&lt;ref name=ti/&gt; the [[Jnanpith Award]] in 1999 and the [[Padma Shri]] in 1998.&lt;ref name="Padma Awards"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/LST-PDAWD-2013.pdf | title=Padma Awards | publisher=Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India | date=2015 | accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ti/&gt; He shared the Jnanpith Award with Hindi language author [[Nirmal Verma]].&lt;ref name="JP99"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/2000/03/11/stories/0211000b.htm|title=Nirmal Verma, Gurdial Singh jointly get Jnanpith Award|newspaper=The Hindu|date=11 March 2000|accessdate=17 August 2016|agency=Press Trust of India|location=New Delhi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
Singh suffered from a [[heart attack]] earlier in 2016 after which he was partially [[Paralysis|paralysed]]. On 13 August 2016 he fell unconscious at his home in Jaitu and was admitted into a private hospital at [[Bathinda]] where he was kept on [[Ventilator|ventilator support]]. He died on 16 August 2016, when he was taken off life support systems, after it was determined that Singh had shown no signs of recovery.&lt;ref name="HTdeath"&gt;{{cite web|title=Much-feted Punjabi writer Gurdial Singh passes away at 83 |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/punjab/eminent-punjabi-writer-gurdial-singh-passes-away/story-zCOiKXiZmvlfMIdaoMzJUI.html | work=Hindustan Times | date=16 August 2016 | accessdate=17 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is survived by his wife, Balwant Kaur, a son and two daughters.&lt;ref name="HTObit"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/punjab/gurdial-singh-1924-2016-man-who-gave-punjabi-fiction-its-first-dalit-hero-from-marhi-da-deeva-to-anhe-ghore-da-daan/story-NJOaQKPol917b0ZKb1yaFK.html | title=Gurdial Singh (1924-2016): Man who gave Punjabi fiction its first Dalit hero | work=Hindustan Times | date=16 August 2016 | accessdate=17 August 2016 | first=Nirupama|last= Dutt| first2= Navrajdeep | last2= Singh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32909">'''Habitat destruction''' is the process by which natural [[habitat]] is rendered incapable of supporting its native species. In this process, the organisms that previously used the site are displaced or destroyed, reducing [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"&gt;{{ cite journal | url=http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/38/12/1079 | author= Sahney, S., Benton, M.J. &amp; Falcon-Lang, H.J. | year=2010 | title= Rainforest collapse triggered Pennsylvanian tetrapod diversification in Euram     eri                 ca | journal=Geology | volume = 38 | pages = 1079–1082 | format=PDF | doi=10.1130/G31182.1 | issue=12 | bibcode=2010Geo....38.1079S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Habitat destruction by human activity is mainly for the purpose of harvesting [[natural resources]] for industrial production and [[urbanization]]. Clearing habitats for [[agriculture]] is the principal cause of habitat destruction. Other important causes of habitat destruction include [[mining]], [[logging]], [[trawling]], and [[urban sprawl]]. Habitat destruction is currently ranked as the primary cause of species [[extinction]] worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Pimm &amp; Raven, 2000, pp. 843-845&lt;/ref&gt; It is a process of natural environmental change that may be caused by [[habitat fragmentation]], geological processes, [[climate change]]&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"/&gt; or by human activities such as the introduction of [[invasive species]], ecosystem nutrient depletion, and other human activities.

The terms '''habitat loss''' and '''habitat reduction''' are also used in a wider sense, including loss of habitat from other factors, such as [[water pollution|water]] and [[noise pollution]].

==Impacts on organisms==
In the simplest term, when a habitat is destroyed, the plants, animals, and other organisms that occupied the habitat have a reduced [[carrying capacity]] so that populations decline and [[extinction]] becomes more likely.&lt;ref&gt;Scholes &amp; Biggs, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the greatest threat to organisms and biodiversity is the process of habitat loss.&lt;ref&gt;Barbault &amp; Sastrapradja, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Temple (1986) found that 82% of [[Endangered species|endangered bird species]] were significantly threatened by habitat loss. Most amphibian species are also threatened by habitat loss,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beebee|first1=Trevor J.C.|last2=Griffiths|first2=Richard A.|title=The amphibian decline crisis: A watershed for conservation biology?|journal=Biological Conservation|date=31 May 2005|volume=125|issue=3|page=271|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2005.04.009|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320705001825}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some species are now only breeding in modified habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Borzée|first1=Amaël|last2=Jang|first2=Yikweon|title=Description of a seminatural habitat of the endangered Suweon treefrog Hyla suweonensis|journal=Animal Cells and Systems|date=28 April 2015|volume=19|issue=3|page=216|doi=10.1080/19768354.2015.1028442|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19768354.2015.1028442}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[endemism|Endemic]] organisms with limited ranges are most affected by habitat destruction, mainly because these organisms are not found anywhere else within the world, and thus have less chance of recovering. Many endemic organisms have very specific requirements for their survival that can only be found within a certain ecosystem, resulting in their extinction. Extinction may also take place very long after the destruction of habitat, a phenomenon known as [[extinction debt]]. Habitat destruction can also decrease the range of certain organism populations. This can result in the reduction of genetic diversity and perhaps the production of [[infertile]] youths, as these organisms would have a higher possibility of mating with related organisms within their population, or different species. One of the most famous examples is the impact upon China's [[giant panda]], once found across the nation. Now it is only found in fragmented and isolated regions in the southwest of the country, as a result of widespread [[deforestation]] in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulitzercenter.org/reporting/china-sichuan-panda-deforestation-habitat-mountain-conservation|title=The Panda's Forest: Biodiversity Loss|date=24 August 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Bolivia-Deforestation-EO.JPG|thumb|right|Satellite photograph of [[deforestation in Bolivia]]. Originally dry tropical forest, the land is being cleared for [[soybean]] cultivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | title = Tierras Bajas Deforestation, Bolivia

}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Biodiversity hotspot]]s are chiefly [[tropical]] regions that feature high concentrations of [[Endemism|endemic]] species and, when all hotspots are combined, may contain over half of the world’s [[Terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] species.&lt;ref name="Cincotta"&gt;Cincotta &amp; Engelman, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; These hotspots are suffering from habitat loss and destruction.
Most of the natural habitat on islands and in areas of high human population density has already been destroyed (WRI, 2003). Islands suffering extreme habitat destruction include [[New Zealand]], [[Madagascar]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Japan]].&lt;ref name="Primack"&gt;Primack, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; South and East Asia — especially [[China]], [[India]], [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], and Japan — and many areas in [[West Africa]] have extremely dense human populations that allow little room for natural habitat. Marine areas close to highly populated [[coast]]al cities also face degradation of their [[coral reef]]s or other marine habitat. These areas include the eastern coasts of Asia and Africa, northern coasts of [[South America]], and the [[Caribbean Sea]] and its associated [[island]]s.&lt;ref name="Primack"/&gt;

Regions of un[[sustainable agriculture]] or unstable governments, which may go hand-in-hand, typically experience high rates of habitat destruction.  [[Central America]], [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], and the [[Amazonian tropical rainforest]] areas of [[South America]] are the main regions with unsustainable agricultural practices and/or government mismanagement.&lt;ref name="Primack"/&gt;

Areas of high agricultural output tend to have the highest extent of habitat destruction.  In the U.S., less than 25% of native vegetation remains in many parts of the [[Eastern United States|East]] and [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]].&lt;ref name="Stein"&gt;Stein et al., 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Only 15% of land area remains unmodified by human activities in all of Europe.&lt;ref name="Primack"/&gt;

==Ecosystems==
[[File:Lacanja burn.JPG|thumb|Jungle burned for agriculture in southern Mexico]]
[[Tropical rainforest]]s have received most of the attention concerning the destruction of habitat. From the approximately 16 million square kilometers of tropical rainforest habitat that originally existed worldwide, less than 9 million square kilometers remain today.&lt;ref name="Primack"/&gt; The current rate of [[deforestation]] is 160,000 square kilometers per year, which equates to a loss of approximately 1% of original forest habitat each year.&lt;ref name="Laurance"&gt;Laurance, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Other forest [[ecosystem]]s have suffered as much or more destruction as tropical [[rainforest]]s.  [[Farming]] and [[logging]] have severely disturbed at least 94% of [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|temperate broadleaf forests]]; many [[old growth forest]] stands have lost more than 98% of their previous area because of human activities.&lt;ref name="Primack"/&gt; [[Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|Tropical deciduous dry forests]] are easier to [[Slash and burn|clear and burn]] and are more suitable for agriculture and [[cattle ranching]] than tropical rainforests; consequently, less than 0.1% of [[Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|dry forests in Central America's Pacific Coast]] and less than 8% in [[Madagascar dry deciduous forests|Madagascar]] remain from their original extents.&lt;ref name="Laurance"/&gt;

[[File:Farmland-batang bungo.jpg|thumb|left|Farmers near newly cleared land within Taman Nasional Kerinci Seblat ([[Kerinci Seblat National Park]]), [[Sumatra]].]]
Plains and [[desert]] areas have been degraded to a lesser extent. Only 10-20% of the world's [[drylands]], which include [[temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands]], [[Scrubland|scrub]], and [[Temperate deciduous forest|deciduous forests]], have been somewhat degraded.&lt;ref&gt;Kauffman &amp; Pyke, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  But included in that 10-20% of land is the approximately 9 million square kilometers of seasonally dry-lands that humans have converted to deserts through the process of desertification.&lt;ref name="Primack"/&gt; The [[tallgrass prairie]]s of North America, on the other hand, have less than 3% of natural habitat remaining that has not been converted to farmland.&lt;ref&gt;White et al., 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wetland]]s and marine areas have endured high levels of habitat destruction. More than 50% of wetlands in the U.S. have been destroyed in just the last 200 years.&lt;ref name="Stein"/&gt; Between 60% and 70% of European wetlands have been completely destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Ravenga et al., 2000&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, there has been an increase in demand for coastal housing and tourism which has caused a decline in marine habitats over the last 60 years. The rising sea levels and temperatures have caused [[soil erosion]], [[coastal flooding]], and loss of quality in the UK [[marine ecosystem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.azocleantech.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=535|title=United Kingdom: Environmental Issues, Policies and Clean Technology|date=2015-06-08|website=AZoCleantech.com|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; About one-fifth (20%) of marine coastal areas have been highly modified by humans.&lt;ref&gt;Burke et al., 2000&lt;/ref&gt; One-fifth of coral reefs have also been destroyed, and another fifth has been severely degraded by [[overfishing]], pollution, and [[invasive species]]; 90% of the Philippines’ coral reefs alone have been destroyed.&lt;ref name="MEA"&gt;MEA, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, over 35% of the [[Coastal ecosystems|mangrove ecosystems]] worldwide have been destroyed.&lt;ref name="MEA"/&gt;

==Natural causes==
Habitat destruction through natural processes such as volcanism, [[fire]], and climate change is well documented in the fossil record.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"/&gt; One study shows that habitat fragmentation of tropical rainforests in Euramerica 300 million years ago led to a great loss of amphibian diversity, but simultaneously the drier climate spurred on a burst of diversity among reptiles.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"/&gt;

==Human causes==
[[File:Amazonie deforestation.jpg|thumb|Deforestation and roads in Amazonia, the [[Amazon Rainforest]].]]

Habitat destruction caused by humans includes [[land conversion]] from forests, etc. to [[arable land]], [[urban sprawl]], [[Public works|infrastructure development]], and other anthropogenic changes to the characteristics of land. Habitat degradation, fragmentation, and [[pollution]] are aspects of habitat destruction caused by humans that do not necessarily involve over destruction of habitat, yet result in habitat collapse. [[Desertification]], [[deforestation]], and [[Coral bleaching|coral reef degradation]] are specific types of habitat destruction for those areas ([[desert]]s, [[forest]]s, [[coral reef]]s).

Geist and Lambin (2002) assessed 152 case studies of net losses of tropical forest cover to determine any patterns in the proximate and underlying causes of tropical deforestation. Their results, yielded as percentages of the case studies in which each parameter was a significant factor, provide a quantitative prioritization of which proximate and underlying causes were the most significant. The proximate causes were clustered into broad categories of [[agricultural expansion]] (96%), [[infrastructure expansion]] (72%), and [[wood extraction]] (67%). Therefore, according to this study, [[forest conversion]] to agriculture is the main land use change responsible for tropical deforestation. The specific categories reveal further insight into the specific causes of tropical deforestation: transport extension (64%), commercial wood extraction (52%), [[permanent cultivation]] (48%), [[cattle ranching]] (46%), shifting ([[slash and burn]]) cultivation (41%), [[subsistence agriculture]] (40%), and [[fuel wood]] extraction for domestic use (28%). One result is that [[shifting cultivation]] is not the primary cause of deforestation in all world regions, while transport extension (including the [[Road construction|construction of new roads]]) is the largest single proximate factor responsible for deforestation.&lt;ref name="Geist"/&gt;

Rising global temperatures, caused by the [[greenhouse effect]], contribute to habitat destruction, endangering various species, such as the [[polar bear]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Predicting 21st-century polar bear habitat distribution from global climate models|url=|journal=Ecological Monographs|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1890/07-2089.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Melting [[ice cap]]s promote rising sea levels and floods which threaten natural habitats and species globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baker|first=Jason D.|last2=Littnan|first2=Charles L.|last3=Johnston|first3=David W.|date=2006-05-24|title=Potential effects of sea level rise on the terrestrial habitats of endangered and endemic megafauna in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands|url=http://www.int-res.com/abstracts/esr/v2/p21-30/|journal=Endangered Species Research|volume=2|pages=21–30|doi=10.3354/esr002021|issn=1863-5407}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galbraith|first=H.|last2=Jones|first2=R.|last3=Park|first3=R.|last4=Clough|first4=J.|last5=Herrod-Julius|first5=S.|last6=Harrington|first6=B.|last7=Page|first7=G.|date=2002-06-01|title=Global Climate Change and Sea Level Rise: Potential Losses of Intertidal Habitat for Shorebirds|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1675/1524-4695%282002%29025%5B0173%3AGCCASL%5D2.0.CO%3B2|journal=Waterbirds|volume=25|issue=2|pages=173–183|doi=10.1675/1524-4695(2002)025[0173:GCCASL]2.0.CO;2|issn=1524-4695}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drivers==
[[File:Crowded Nanjing Road in Shanghai.jpeg|thumb|Nanjing Road in Shanghai]]
While the above-mentioned activities are the proximal or direct causes of habitat destruction in that they actually destroy habitat, this still does not identify why humans destroy habitat.  The forces that cause humans to destroy habitat are known as ''drivers'' of habitat destruction.  [[Demographic]], economic, sociopolitical, scientific and technological, and cultural drivers all contribute to habitat destruction.&lt;ref name="MEA"/&gt;

Demographic drivers include the [[Human overpopulation|expanding human population]]; rate of [[Population growth|population increase]] over time; [[Population density|spatial distribution]] of people in a given area ([[List of urban areas by population|urban]] versus rural), ecosystem type, and country; and the combined effects of poverty, age, family planning, gender, and education status of people in certain areas.&lt;ref name="MEA"/&gt;  Most of the exponential human population growth worldwide is occurring in or close to [[biodiversity hotspots]].&lt;ref name="Cincotta"/&gt;  This may explain why human population density accounts for 87.9% of the variation in numbers of [[threatened species]] across 114 countries, providing indisputable evidence that people play the largest role in decreasing [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;McKee et al., 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  The boom in human population and migration of people into such species-rich regions are making [[conservation biology|conservation efforts]] not only more urgent but also more likely to conflict with local human interests.&lt;ref name="Cincotta"/&gt;  The high local population density in such areas is directly correlated to the poverty status of the local people, most of whom lacking an education and family planning.&lt;ref name="Geist"&gt;Geist &amp; Lambin, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

From the Geist and Lambin (2002) study described in the previous section, the underlying driving forces were prioritized as follows (with the percent of the 152 cases the factor played a significant role in): economic factors (81%), institutional or policy factors (78%), technological factors (70%), cultural or socio-political factors (66%), and demographic factors (61%).  The main economic factors included commercialization and growth of timber markets (68%), which are driven by national and international demands; urban industrial growth (38%); low domestic costs for land, labor, fuel, and timber (32%); and increases in product prices mainly for cash crops (25%).  Institutional and policy factors included formal pro-deforestation policies on land development (40%), economic growth including colonization and infrastructure improvement (34%), and subsidies for land-based activities (26%); property rights and land-tenure insecurity (44%); and policy failures such as corruption, lawlessness, or mismanagement (42%).  The main technological factor was the poor application of technology in the wood industry (45%), which leads to wasteful logging practices.  Within the broad category of cultural and sociopolitical factors are public attitudes and values (63%), individual/household behavior (53%), public unconcern toward forest environments (43%), missing basic values (36%), and unconcern by individuals (32%).  Demographic factors were the in-migration of colonizing settlers into sparsely populated forest areas (38%) and growing population density—a result of the first factor—in those areas (25%).

There are also feedbacks and interactions among the proximate and underlying causes of deforestation that can amplify the process. Road construction has the largest feedback effect, because it interacts with—and leads to—the establishment of new settlements and more people, which causes a growth in wood (logging) and food markets.&lt;ref name="Geist"/&gt;  Growth in these markets, in turn, progresses the commercialization of agriculture and logging industries. When these industries become commercialized, they must become more efficient by utilizing larger or more modern machinery that often has a worse effect on the habitat than traditional farming and logging methods. Either way, more land is cleared more rapidly for commercial markets. This common feedback example manifests just how closely related the proximate and underlying causes are to each other.

==Impact on human population==
[[File:KatrinaNewOrleansFlooded edit2.jpg|thumb|The draining and development of coastal wetlands that previously protected the Gulf Coast contributed to severe flooding in New Orleans, Louisiana in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]].&lt;ref&gt;Tibbetts, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Habitat destruction vastly increases an area's vulnerability to [[natural disaster]]s like [[flood]] and [[drought]], [[crop failure]], [[spread of disease]], and [[water contamination]].&lt;ref name="MEA"/&gt; On the other hand, a healthy ecosystem with good management practices will reduce the chance of these events happening, or will at least mitigate adverse impacts.

Agricultural land can actually suffer from the destruction of the surrounding landscape. Over the past 50 years, the destruction of habitat surrounding agricultural land has degraded approximately 40% of agricultural land worldwide via [[erosion]], [[Soil salinity|salinization]], [[Soil compaction|compaction]], [[Natural resource#Depletion|nutrient depletion]], [[pollution]], and [[urbanization]].&lt;ref name="MEA"/&gt; Humans also lose direct uses of natural habitat when habitat is destroyed. Aesthetic uses such as [[birdwatching]], recreational uses like [[hunting]] and [[fishing]], and [[ecotourism]] usually rely upon virtually undisturbed habitat. Many people value the complexity of the natural world and are disturbed by the loss of natural habitats and animal or plant species worldwide.

Probably the most profound impact that habitat destruction has on people is the loss of many valuable [[ecosystem services]]. Habitat destruction has altered nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and [[carbon cycle]]s, which has increased the frequency and severity of [[acid rain]], [[algal bloom]]s, and [[fish kill]]s in rivers and oceans and contributed tremendously to global [[climate change]].&lt;ref name="MEA"/&gt; One ecosystem service whose significance is becoming better understood is [[Climate|climate regulation]]. On a local scale, trees provide windbreaks and shade; on a regional scale, [[Transpiration|plant transpiration]] recycles rainwater and maintains constant annual rainfall; on a global scale, plants (especially trees from tropical rainforests) from around the world counter the accumulation of [[greenhouse gas]]es in the atmosphere by [[Carbon dioxide sink|sequestering carbon dioxide]] through [[photosynthesis]].&lt;ref name="Primack"/&gt; Other ecosystem services that are diminished or lost altogether as a result of habitat destruction include [[watershed management]], [[nitrogen fixation]], oxygen production, [[pollination]] (see [[pollinator decline]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=8|issue=5|year=2013|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0063421|pmc=3661593|title=Plant Pollinator Networks along a Gradient of Urbanisation|author1=Benoît Geslin|author2=Benoit Gauzens|author3=Elisa Thébault|author4=Isabelle Dajoz|pmid=23717421|page=e63421|bibcode=2013PLoSO...863421G}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[waste treatment]] (i.e., the [[Decomposition|breaking down]] and immobilization of [[toxic]] pollutants), and [[Nutrient cycle|nutrient recycling]] of [[sewage]] or [[agricultural runoff]].&lt;ref name="Primack"/&gt;

The loss of trees from the tropical rainforests alone represents a substantial diminishing of the earth’s ability to produce oxygen and use up carbon dioxide. These services are becoming even more important as increasing [[carbon dioxide]] levels is one of the main contributors to global [[climate change]].

The [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]] may not directly affect humans, but the indirect effects of losing many species as well as the diversity of ecosystems in general are enormous. When biodiversity is lost, the environment loses many species that perform valuable and unique roles in the ecosystem. The environment and all its inhabitants rely on biodiversity to recover from extreme environmental conditions. When too much biodiversity is lost, a catastrophic event such as an earthquake, flood, or volcanic eruption could cause an ecosystem to crash, and humans would obviously suffer from that. Loss of biodiversity also means that humans are losing animals that could have served as biological control agents and plants that could potentially provide higher-yielding crop varieties, pharmaceutical drugs to cure existing or future diseases or cancer, and new resistant crop varieties for agricultural species susceptible to pesticide-resistant insects or virulent strains of [[fungi]], [[virus]]es, and [[bacteria]].&lt;ref name="Primack"/&gt;

The negative effects of habitat destruction usually impact rural populations more directly than urban populations.&lt;ref name="MEA"/&gt; Across the globe, poor people suffer the most when natural habitat is destroyed, because less natural habitat means fewer natural resources per capita, yet wealthier people and countries simply have to pay more to continue to receive more than their per capita share of natural resources.

Another way to view the negative effects of habitat destruction is to look at the opportunity cost of destroying a given habitat. In other words, what are people losing out on by taking away a given habitat? A country may increase its food supply by converting forest land to row-crop agriculture, but the value of the same land may be much larger when it can supply natural resources or services such as clean water, timber, ecotourism, or flood regulation and drought control.&lt;ref name="MEA"/&gt;

==Outlook==
The [[Human overpopulation|rapid expansion of the global human population]] is increasing the world’s food requirement substantially. Simple logic dictates that more people will require more food. In fact, as the world’s population increases dramatically, agricultural output will need to increase by at least 50%, over the next 30 years.&lt;ref name="Tilman"&gt;Tilman et al., 2001&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, continually moving to new land and soils provided a boost in food production to meet the global food demand. That easy fix will no longer be available, however, as more than 98% of all land suitable for agriculture is already in use or degraded beyond repair.&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson et al., 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The impending global [[food crisis]] will be a major source of habitat destruction. Commercial farmers are going to become desperate to produce more food from the same amount of land, so they will use more [[fertilizer]]s and show less concern for the environment to meet the market demand. Others will seek out new land or will convert other land-uses to agriculture. Agricultural intensification will become widespread at the cost of the environment and its inhabitants. Species will be pushed out of their habitat either directly by habitat destruction or indirectly by fragmentation, [[environmental degradation|degradation]], or [[pollution]]. Any efforts to protect the world’s remaining natural habitat and biodiversity will compete directly with humans’ growing demand for natural resources, especially new agricultural lands.&lt;ref name="Tilman"/&gt;

==Solutions==
[[File:Hawaii turtle.JPG|thumb|''[[Chelonia mydas]]'' on a Hawaiian coral reef. Although the endangered species is protected, habitat loss from human development is a major reason for the loss of [[green turtle]] nesting beaches.]]
In most cases of tropical deforestation, three to four underlying causes are driving two to three proximate causes.&lt;ref name="Geist"/&gt; This means that a universal policy for controlling tropical deforestation would not be able to address the unique combination of proximate and underlying causes of deforestation in each country.&lt;ref name="Geist"/&gt; Before any local, national, or international deforestation policies are written and enforced, governmental leaders must acquire a detailed understanding of the complex combination of proximate causes and underlying driving forces of deforestation in a given area or country.&lt;ref name="Geist"/&gt; This concept, along with many other results of tropical deforestation from the Geist and Lambin study, can easily be applied to habitat destruction in general. Governmental leaders need to take action by addressing the underlying driving forces, rather than merely regulating the proximate causes. In a broader sense, governmental bodies at a local, national, and international scale need to emphasize the following:

#Considering the many irreplaceable ecosystem services provided by natural habitats.
#Protecting remaining intact sections of natural habitat.
#Educating the public about the importance of natural habitat and biodiversity.
#Developing [[family planning]] programs in areas of rapid population growth.
#Finding ecological ways to increase agricultural output without increasing the total land in production.
#Preserving habitat corridors to minimize prior damage from fragmented habitats.
#Reducing [[human population]] and expansion. Apart from improving access to contraception globally, furthering gender equality also has a great benefit. When women have the same education (decision-making power), this generally leads to smaller families.

'''Hana Catherine Mullens''' (1826–1861) was a Swiss-German woman in Bengal, unmarried name Lacroix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=15845|first=Katherine|last=Prior|title=Lacroix, Alphonse François}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She is credited by some with having written the first novel in the [[Bengali language]], ''Phulmani O Karunar Bibaran'' (Description of Phulmani and Karuna), in 1852.&lt;ref name = "Bose423"&gt;Sengupta, Subodh Chandra and Bose, Anjali (editors), (1976/1998), ''Sansad Bangali Charitabhidhan'' (Biographical dictionary) Vol I, {{Bn icon}}, p 423, {{ISBN|81-85626-65-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There are other claimants to being earlier novels. ''Nabababubilas'' published by [[Bhabani Charan Bandyopadhyay]] in 1825 is claimed as one by some&lt;ref name = "Novel"&gt;{{cite book |last=Aziz |first=Mahibul |year=2012 |chapter=Novel |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Novel  |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; but others think of it as being merely a story.&lt;ref&gt;Sengupta, Subodh Chandra and Bose, Anjali, pp. 374-375.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar reservation has also been expressed about ''Phulmani O Karunar Bibaran''.&lt;ref&gt;Bandopadhyay, Brajendranath, ''Sahitye Banga Mahila'', in ''Bethune College and School Centenary Volume'', edited by Dr. Kalidas Nag, 1949,  p. 196&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Malence,_Hanah_Kathrin|title=Malence, Hanah Kathrin - Banglapedia|website=en.banglapedia.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Her father [[Alphonse François Lacroix]] was a Swiss citizen who went to [[Hugli-Chuchura|Chinsurah]] in [[India]] in 1821 to preach Christianity on behalf of the [[London Missionary Society]]. Hana learnt Bengali from the servants at home and at the age of 12 started teaching Bengali in a newly established school in Calcutta (now, [[Kolkata]]). In 1845, she was married to Joseph Mullens, who was also engaged in preaching Christianity in India.&lt;ref name = "Bose423"/&gt; It was a period when [[Sanskrit]] was used for literary purposes and Bengali was only a language of conversation.

==Literary achievements==
Her first Bengali book ''Phulmani O Karunar Bibaran'' was written for native Christian women in 1852. The objective was to preach Christianity. This book was published six years before [[Peary Chand Mitra]] published his ''[[Alaler Gharer Dulal]]''.&lt;ref name = "Bose423"/&gt;

The first [[Bengali people|Bengali]] woman to write a novel was [[Swarnakumari Devi]], with her ''Deepnirban'' in 1876.&lt;ref name = "Novel"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Banerjee, Hiranmay, ''Thakurbarir Katha'', {{Bn icon}}, p. 119, Sishu Sahitya Sansad.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mullens wrote another book, ''The Missionary on the Ganges or What is Christianity'', in both English and Bengali. She translated [[Charlotte Maria Tucker]]'s ''Daybreak in Britain'' into Bengali.&lt;ref name = "Bose423"/&gt;

==Zenana work==
It was at the invitation of Mullens’ husband, chairing the Bengal Missionary Conference of 1855, that [[John Fordyce (missionary)|Rev. John Fordyce]] first reported on his female teaching initiative in the [[zenana mission|zenanas]] of [[Calcutta]]. Shortly thereafter, Mrs Mullens persuaded the widow of a Hindu doctor to accommodate zenana teaching in her home, and then negotiated other similar arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Emma Raymond Pitman, ''India Zenana Missions'' (London: John Snow &amp; Co., 1903), pp. 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt; Her work in this respect was interrupted by a return to England in 1858, but by the time of her death in 1861 she had four zenanas under her care and was visiting a further eleven every afternoon.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Bickers and Rosemary Seton, eds, ''Missionary Encounters: Sources and Issues'' (Richmond: Curzon Press, 1996), pp. 51-52.&lt;/ref&gt; Her work in this field earned her the accolade of "Apostle of the Zenanas".&lt;ref&gt;Pitman, ut supra.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''hash buster''' is a [[Computer program|program]] which randomly adds characters to data in order to change the data's [[hash sum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Delio|first=Michelle|title=Random Acts of Spamness|url=https://www.wired.com/techbiz/it/news/2004/01/61886?currentPage=all|work=Wired Tech Biz|publisher=Wired Magazine|accessdate=24 September 2011|date=13 January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This is typically used to add words to [[e-mail spam|spam]] e-mails, to bypass [[hash filter]]s. As the e-mail's hash sum is different from the sum of e-mails previously defined as spam, the e-mail is not considered spam and therefore delivered as if it were a normal message.

Hash busters can also be used to randomly add content to any kind of file until the hash sum becomes a certain sum. In e-mail context, this could be used to bypass a filter which only accepts e-mails with a certain sum.

Initially spams containing "white noise" from hash busters tended to simply exhibit 'paragraphs' of literally random words, but increasingly these are now appearing somewhat grammatical.

The '''Hinuq language''' (autonym: '''гьинузас мец''' ''hinuzas mec'', also known as '''Hinukh''', '''Hinux''', '''Ginukh''', or '''Ginux''') is a [[Northeast Caucasian languages|Northeast Caucasian language]] of the [[Tsezic languages|Tsezic]] subgroup. It is spoken by about 200 to 500 people, the [[Hinukh people|Hinukhs]], in the [[Tsuntinsky District]] of southwestern [[Dagestan]], mainly in the village of [[Genukh]] (Hinukh: ''Hino''). Hinukh is very closely related to [[Tsez language|Tsez]], but they are not entirely mutually intelligible.

Only half of the children of the village speak the Hinukh language. As Hinukh is unwritten, like the other members of the Tsezic family, [[Avar language|Avar]] and [[Russian language|Russian]] are used as literary language. Hinukh is not considered to have dialects, but due to its linguistic proximity to Tsez it was once considered a Tsez dialect.

The Hinukh people were already mentioned in the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] chronicles of the [[Early Middle Ages]]. The language itself was first described in 1916 by [[Russia]]n ethnographer A. Serzhputovsky.

==Phonology==

===Vowels===
Hinukh distinguishes 6 vowel qualities {{IPA|/a, e, i, o, u, y/}}, all of which can be either long or short. Two vowels can occur [[pharyngealization|pharyngealized]]: {{IPA|/aˤ/}} and {{IPA|/eˤ/}}. However, these are only used by the older generation. Today they are usually replaced by {{IPA|/i/}}.{{citation needed|date=December 2009}}

===Consonants===
Like many Caucasian languages, Hinuq has a large number of consonants. In addition to voiced and unvoiced consonants, there are also ejectives.

==Morphology==
It is an agglutinative language which makes mainly use of suffixes.

===Nouns===
Hinukh is an [[ergative-absolutive language]] and, like most Northeast Caucasian languages, shows a rich case system. There are six non-spatial cases (Absolutive, Ergative, First Genitive, Second Genitive, Dative, Instrumental) as well as 35 spatial cases. The spatial case system itself consists of two categories, location {{Smallcaps|{{lc:(CONT, IN, SUB, SPR, AT, ALOC, ILOC)}}}} and orientation, expressed by the use of direction markers (Essive, Lative, First Ablative, Second Ablative, Directional). The plural suffix is almost unvariably ''-be''.

Hinuq distinguishes a direct and [[Oblique case|oblique stem]]. Case suffixes are primarily added to the oblique stem. To form the oblique stem, there are different options, including oblique suffixes, epenthetic vowels, deletion of the base-stem-final consonant, vowel, or semivowel; stress shift or ablaut. The oblique stem suffixes are ''-mo'', ''-a'', ''-la'', ''-i'', ''-ya'', ''-o'', ''-li'', ''-yi'', ''-ra'', ''-ro'', ''-ru'', ''-do'', ''-u'', ''-na'', ''-nu''. Some examples of nominal declension are given below.

There are five genders in Hinuq which play an important role in the language's grammar.

===Verbs===
[[Grammatical tense|Tenses]] are marked synthetically on the verbs by means of affixes. As its sister languages [[Bezhta language|Bezhta]] and Tsez, Hinukh differentiates between "witnessed past" (ending in ''-s'' or ''-š'') and "unwitnessed past" (in ''-no''); the present tense is marked with the suffix ''-ho''. In the future tense, Hinukh distinguishes a "direct future" (''-n''), which is used only in the first person, and an "indirect future" (''-s'') used for all other persons.

===Numerals===
The numeral system is [[vigesimal]], which means that it is a base-20 system, a feature commonly found among the languages of the Caucasus.

'''Homophony''' (from the {{lang-el|ὁμός}}, ''homós'', "same" and {{lang-el|φωνή}}, ''phōnē'', "sound") in a theory of writing systems is one of the forms of phonogram –meaning “different signs for the same value”, i.e. the same sound combinations represented by different signs. 

John Heise in the Chapter 4 of 'Akkadian language', the book on the origin and development of cuneiform gives the following example (see [[cuneiform transliteration]]):

[[Image:Accadian for ni.jpg]]

He comments: “In transliterations the same sounds that are represented by different cuneiform signs are distinguished with an accent or an index. The signs for 
ni, ní (i with [[accent aigu]]), nì (i with [[accent grave]]), ni4, ni5, ...
are all different cuneiform symbols. ní may be called (and pronounced among Assyriologists) ni2 and nì as ni3. These accents thus have nothing to do with word accent.”

The term ‘[[hardliner]]s’ that some western sources use in the Iranian political context, usually refers to the faction,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Masoud Kazemzadeh|title= Intra-Elite Factionalism and the 2004 Majles Elections in Iran|journal=Middle Eastern Studies|year=2008|volume=44|number=2|doi=10.1080/00263200701874867|page=189–214|quote=In Western sources, the term ‘hard-liners’ is used to refer to the faction under the leadership of Supreme Leader Ali Khamanehi. Members of this group prefer to call themselves ‘''Osul-gara''’. The word ‘''osul''’ means ‘fundamentals’, or ‘principles’ or ‘tenets’. And the suffix ‘''gara''’ means ‘those who uphold or promote’. The more radical elements in the hard-line camp prefer to call themselves ‘''Ommat Hezbollah''’. ‘''Ommat''’ is a technical Arabic-Islamic term referring to people who are Muslim. ‘''Hezbollah''’ literally means ‘Party of Allah’. Before the rise of Ahmadinejad to the presidency in 2005, many official sources in the Islamic Republic referred to this group as ‘''mohafezeh-kar''’ (‘conservative’). Between 1997 and 2006, many Iranians inside Iran used the terms ‘''eqtedar-gara''’ (authoritarian) and ‘''tamamiyat-khah''’ (totalitarian) for what many Western observers have termed ‘hard-liners’. Members of the reformist faction of the fundamentalist oligarchy called the hard-liners ‘''eqtedar-gara''’.}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite the fact it includes also more centrist tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Banafsheh Keynoush|title= Iran after Ahmadinejad|journal=Survival: Global Politics and Strategy|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media|place=New York|year=2012|volume=54|number=3|doi=10.1080/00396338.2012.690988|page=127–146|quote=What is important, however, is that the principlist camp now increasingly represents not just hardliners but also more centre-right factions.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The camp rejects the ''[[status quo]]'' internationally,&lt;ref name="CI"/&gt; but tends to preserve it domestically.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Sanctions, Statecraft, and Nuclear Proliferation|editor=Etel Solingen|date=2012|isbn=9781107010444|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Iranian politics, a principlist refers to the conservative supporters of the [[Supreme Leader of Iran]] and advocates for protecting the ideological 'principles' of the Islamic Revolution’s early days.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-06-15/rohani-clinches-iran-presidency-in-surprise-victory|title=Iranians Celebrate Surprise Rohani Win as Reason for Hope|author1=Ladane Nasseri |author2=Kambiz Foroohar |author3=Yeganeh Salehi |date=June 16, 2013|work=|publisher=[[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]]|accessdate=March 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Hossein Mousavian]], "The Principlists constitute the main right-wing/conservative political movement in Iran. They are more religiously oriented and more closely affiliated with the [[Qom]]-based [[Clericalism in Iran|clerical establishment]] than their moderate and [[Iranian reform movement|reformist]] rivals".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Iranian Nuclear Crisis: A Memoir|year=2012|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|author=Seyed Hossein Mousavian|page=486|isbn=9780870033025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A declaration issued by [[The Two Societies]], which serves as the Principlists "manifesto", focuses on loyalty to [[Islam]] and the [[Iranian Revolution]], obedience to the [[Supreme Leader of Iran]], and devotion to the principle of ''[[Guardianship of the Islamic Jurists|Vilayat Faqih]]''.&lt;ref name="Tehran Bureau"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2011/09/irans-conservatives-the-headstrong-new-bloc.html|title=Iran's Conservatives: The Headstrong New Bloc|last1=SHAUL |first1=BAKHASH|date=12 September 2011|work=[[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]] |publisher=[[Tehran Bureau]]|accessdate=March 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a poll conducted by the Iranian Students Polling Agency (ISPA) in April 2017, 15% of Iranians identify as leaning Principlist. In comparison, 28% identify as leaning [[Iranian Reformists|Reformist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.khabaronline.ir/detail/659410/Politics/election|title=Poll Results of Popular Leaning Towards Principlists and Reformists|language=Persian|via=Khabaronline|work=Iranian Students Polling Agency (ISPA)|date=28 April 2017|accessdate=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lars Hans Carl Abraham Forssell''' (January 14, 1928{{spaced ndash}}July 26, 2007) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] writer and member of the [[Swedish Academy]]. Forssell was a versatile writer who worked within many [[genre]]s, including [[poetry]], [[drama]] and [[songwriting]]. He was married from 1951 until his death to Kerstin Hane, and was the father of Jonas and Malte Forssell.

Lars Forssell was born in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]] in 1928. He attended a local elementary school called [[Kungsholms Folkskola]], which, at the beginning of the twentieth century, was the world's largest [[Primary education|elementary school]] - the school had a capacity of 3,800 pupils, but since not all of them attended school every day, they were taught in shifts and according to the [[City Museum of Stockholm]], the total number of enrolled pupils was over 6,000.

He studied in the [[United States]] during the 1940s, returned to Sweden to study for a degree at the [[University of Uppsala]] in 1952 and became a cultural reporter for various Swedish newspapers and journals (''[[Utsikt]], [[Bonniers Litterära Magasin]], [[Poesi]], [[Dagens Nyheter]]'' and ''[[Expressen]]''). At the same time, he became established as a lyricist for [[cabaret]] shows and his own reviews (including ''Två åsnor'' (''A Pair of Donkeys'') which was staged in [[Gothenburg]] in 1957). In 1966 he was a member of the jury at the [[16th Berlin International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="berlinale 1966"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1966/04_jury_1966/04_Jury_1966.html |title=Berlinale 1966: Juries |accessdate=2010-02-22 |work=berlinale.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His collections of poetry won him membership of the Swedish Academy in 1971, while his song lyrics brought him widespread public recognition. During the 1970s he worked tirelessly as a poet and as a song-contest lyricist, including writing for the 1973 Swedish [[Eurovision Song Contest]] entry selection round ([[Melodifestivalen]]) and for performer [[Lill-Babs]] in 1980.

He was awarded the [[Bellman Prize]] in both 1968 and 1981, the [[Pilot Prize]] in 1992, the [[Litteris et Artibus]] award in 1993, the [[Cornelis Vreeswijk]] scholarship in 1997 and the Swedish Academy's Nordic Prize in 1998. His works include anthologies of poetry, books of song lyrics, children's books, plays, operatic [[libretto]]s and translations. Lars Forssell died in Stockholm in 2007.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35982">This article is a non-exhaustive lists of names used by the [[Dacian people]], who were among the inhabitants of [[Eastern Europe]] before and during the [[Roman Empire]]. Many hundreds of [[personal name]]s and [[placename]]s are known from ancient sources, and they throw light on the [[Dacian language]] and the extent to which it differed from [[Thracian language|Thracian]].

== Anthroponyms ==
{{See also|List of Dacian kings}}

Around 1150 Dacian anthroponyms (personal names) and 900 toponyms (placenames) have been preserved in ancient sources.{{sfn | Nandris | 1976 |p=730}}{{sfn | Petrescu-Dîmbovița| 1978 |p=130}} As far as the [[Onomastics|onomastic]] (proper names) of Dacians and Thracians is concerned, opinions are divided. According to Crossland (1982), the evidence of names from the Dacian, Mysian and Thracian area seems to indicate divergence of a 'Thraco-Dacian' language into northern and southern groups of dialects, but not so different as to rank Thracian and Dacian as separate languages, There were also the development of special tendencies in word formation and of certain secondary phonetic features in each group.{{sfn |Crossland|1982|p=839}} Mateescu (1923), Rosetti (1978) sustain that Thracian onomastic include elements that are common to Geto-Dacians and Bessians (a Thracian tribe).{{sfn|Rosetti |1978|p=208}} A part of researchers support that onomastically, Dacians are not different from the other Thracians in Roman Dacia’s inscriptions.{{sfn|Oltean |2009|p=95}} But recently, D. Dana basing himself on new onomastic material recorded in Egyptian [[ostraka]] suggested criteria which would make possible to distinguish between closely related Thracian and Dacian-Moesian names and singled out certain specific elements for the latter.{{sfn| Pogorelets| et. al. |2007|p=258}}

In Georgiev’s opinion (1960; 1977) Dacian placenames and personal names are "completely different" from their Thracian counterparts.{{sfn| Georgiev |1977|p=298}}

Several Dacian names have also been identified with [[ostracon]]s of Dacian cavalry recruited after the Roman conquest and stationed in East Egypt,{{sfn|Dana|2003|p=166}} i.e. Dadas and Dadazi,{{sfn|Dana|2003|p=174}} Zoutoula,{{sfn|Dana|2003|p=185}} Dotos and Dotouzi,{{sfn|Dana|2003|p=177}} Dieri and Diernais,{{sfn|Dana|2003|p=185}} Diengis,{{sfn|Dana|2003|p=185}} Dida(s),{{sfn|Dana|2003|p=185}} Blaikisa,{{sfn|Dana|2003|p=183}} Blegissa,{{sfn|Dana|2003|p=183}} Diourdanos,{{sfn|Dana|2003|p=183}} Thiadicem,{{sfn|Dana|2003|p=183}} Avizina,{{sfn|Dana|2003|p=183}} Dourpokis,{{sfn|Dana|2003|p=183}} Kaigiza,{{sfn|Dana|2003|p=174 and p=183}} Dardiolai,{{sfn|Dana|2003|p=175}} Denzibalos (see also Dacian king name Deki-balos),{{sfn|Dana|2003|p=175}} Denzi-balus (attested in Britain),{{sfn|Dana|2003|p=175}} Pouridour,{{sfn|Dana|2003|p=176}} Thiaper and Tiatitis,{{sfn|Dana|2003|p=179}} Dekinais,{{sfn|Dana|2003|p=175}} *Rolouzis,{{sfn|Dana|2003|p=179}} (See [[Ostraca]] from Krokodilo and Didymoi)

|[[Decebalus]]
|Dacian word ''balas '' /''balos'' is from PIE *bel 'strong, power' cf. Sanskrit ''bala'' "force" {{sfn|Russu|1969|p=163 and 109}} and  Dece from PIE *dek ‘to take, to  honor’{{sfn|Russu|1967|p=101}}
Also, it had been suggested Decebalus "The force of the Dacians" {{sfn|Van Den Gheyn|1885|p=177}}
|King of Dacians ([[Dio Cassius]])
|Originally named ''Diurpaneus'', after his victory against Romans he was called Decebalus ("The brave one")&lt;ref name="Romanis REquote01"&gt;{{cite web

|quote= Battle of Sarmizegetusa (Sarmizegetuza), A.D. 105. During Trajan"s reign one of the most important Roman successes was the victory over the Dacians. The first important confrontation between the Romans and the Dacians took place in the year 87 and was initiated by Domitian. The [[praetorian prefect]] [[Cornelius Fuscus|Cornelius]] led five or six legions across the Danube on a bridge of ships and advanced towards [[Banat]] (in Romania). The Romans were surprised by a Dacian attack at Tapae (near the village of [[Bucova]], in Romania). Legion V Alaude was crushed and Cornelius Fuscus was killed. The victorious general was originally known as [[Diurpaneus]] (see Manea, p.109), but after this victory he was called Decebalus (the brave one).}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many interpretations are possible for the PIE root ''*dek'' that is found also with the name Decaeneus{{sfn|Tomaschek|1883|p=405}}

|[[Napoca (ancient city)|Napoca]] (''Napuca'')

* [[Dacian language|Dacian]] name having the same root "nap" (cf. ancient [[Armenian language|Armenian]] root "nap") with that of the Dacia's river Naparis attested by [[Herodotus]]. It has an augmentative suffix uk/ok i.e. over, great {{sfn|Tomaschek|1883|p=406}}
* Name derived from that of the Dacianized [[Scythian]] tribe known as Napae &lt;ref&gt;Pârvan (1982)  p.165 and p.82&lt;/ref&gt;
* Name probably akin to the indigenous ([[Thracian]]) element in [[Romanian language]], the word năpârcă 'viper' cf. [[Albanian language|Albanian]] nepërkë, nepërtkë &lt;ref&gt;Paliga (2006) 142&lt;/ref&gt;
* Name derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] term ''napos'' ({{lang|grc|νάπος}}) "timbered valley"
* Name derived from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] ''*snā-p-'' ([[Indogermanisches etymologisches Wörterbuch|Pokorny]] 971-2) "to flow, to swim, damp".{{sfn|Lukács|2005|p=14}}
Independent of these hypotheses, scholars agree that the name of the settlement predates the [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|Roman conquest]] (AD 106).{{sfn|Lukács|2005|p=14}}

For each, the common origin is arbitrarily chosen as C. The degrees are arranged in the order or the cycle of fifths; as in each of these tunings except [[just intonation]] all fifths are of the same size, the tunings appear as straight lines, the slope indicating the relative tempering with respect to Pythagorean, which has pure fifths (3:2, 702 cents). The Pythagorean A{{music|flat}} (at the left) is at 792 cents, G{{music|sharp}} (at the right) at 816 cents; the difference is the Pythagorean comma. Equal temperament by definition is such that A{{music|flat}} and G{{music|sharp}} are at the same level. 1/4 comma meantone produces the "just" major third (5:4, 386 cents, a syntonic comma lower than the Pythagorean one of 408 cents). 1/3 comma meantone produces the "just" minor third (6:5, 316 cents, a syntonic comma higher than the Pythagorean one of 294 cents). In both these meantone temperaments, the enharmony, here the difference between A{{music|flat}} and G{{music|sharp}}, is much larger than in Pythagorean, and with the flat degree higher than the sharp one.]]
[[File:Music intervals frequency ratio equal tempered pythagorean comparison.svg|400px|thumb|right|Comparison of two sets of musical intervals. The equal-tempered intervals are black; the Pythagorean intervals are green.]]
Below is a list of [[interval (music)|intervals]] expressible in terms of a prime limit (see [[#Terminology|Terminology]]), completed by a choice of intervals in various equal subdivisions of the octave or of other intervals.

For commonly encountered harmonic or melodic intervals between pairs of [[Musical note|note]]s in contemporary Western [[music theory]], without consideration of the way in which they are tuned, see [[Interval (music)#Main intervals|Interval (music) § Main intervals]].

==Terminology==
*The ''[[Limit (music)|prime limit]]''&lt;ref name="Fox13"&gt;Fox, Christopher (2003). "Microtones and Microtonalities", ''Contemporary Music Review'', v. 22, pt. 1-2. (Abingdon, Oxfordshire, UK: Routledge): p.13.&lt;/ref&gt; henceforth referred to simply as the ''limit'', is the largest [[prime number]] occurring in the [[integer factorization|factorizations]] of the numerator and denominator of the frequency ratio describing a rational interval. For instance, the limit of the [[perfect fourth|just perfect fourth]] {{nowrap|(4 : 3)}} is 3, but the [[just minor tone]] {{nowrap|(10 : 9)}} has a limit of 5, because 10 can be factorized into 2·5 (and 9 in 3·3). There exists another type of limit, the ''[[Limit (music)#Odd limit|odd limit]]'', a concept used by [[Harry Partch]] (bigger of odd numbers obtained after dividing numerator and denominator by highest possible powers of 2), but it is not used here. The term "limit" was devised by Partch.&lt;ref name="Fox13"/&gt;
*By definition, every interval in a given limit can also be part of a limit of higher order. For instance, a 3-limit unit can also be part of a 5-limit tuning and so on. By sorting the limit columns in the table below, all intervals of a given limit can be brought together (sort backwards by clicking the button twice).
*''[[Pythagorean tuning]]'' means 3-limit intonation—a ratio of numbers with [[prime factor]]s no higher than three.
*''Just intonation'' means [[Five-limit tuning|5-limit]] intonation—a ratio of numbers with [[prime factor]]s no higher than five.
*''[[7-limit|Septimal]]'', ''undecimal'', ''tridecimal'', and ''septendecimal'' mean, respectively, 7, 11, 13, and 17-limit intonation.
*''Meantone'' refers to [[meantone temperament]], where the whole tone is the mean of the major third. In general, a meantone is constructed in the same way as Pythagorean tuning, as a stack of fifths: the tone is reached after two fifths, the major third after four, so that as all fifths are the same, the tone is the mean of the third. In a meantone temperament, each fifth is narrowed ("tempered") by the same small amount. The most common of meantone temperaments is the [[quarter-comma meantone]], in which each fifth is tempered by 1/4 of the syntonic comma, so that after four steps the major third (as C-G-D-A-E) is a full syntonic comma lower than the Pythagorean one. The extremes of the meantone systems encountered in historical practice are the Pythagorean tuning, where the whole tone corresponds to 9:8, i.e. (3:2)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/2, the mean of the major third (3:2)&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;/4, and the fifth (3:2) is not tempered; and the 1/3-comma meantone, where the fifth is tempered to the extent that three ascending fifths produce a pure minor third.(See [[Meantone temperament#Meantone temperaments|Meantone temperaments]]). The music program [[Logic Pro]] uses also 1/2-comma meantone temperament.
*''Equal-tempered'' refers to ''X''-tone [[equal temperament]] with intervals corresponding to ''X'' divisions per octave.
*Tempered intervals however cannot be expressed in terms of prime limits and, unless exceptions, are not found in the table below.
*The table can also be sorted by frequency ratio, by cents, or alphabetically.

'''MILF''' is an [[Acronym and initialism|acronym]] that stands for "'''Mother/Mom/Mama I'd Like to Fuck'''".&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/milf|title=MILF, Definition of MILF in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cambridge"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/milf|title=MILF Meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary|website=Cambridge Dictionary|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PDHCFSRmjSMC&amp;pg=PA903&amp;lpg=PA903&amp;dq=milf%20dictionary%20sexually%20attractive%20woman%20who%20is%20a%20mother&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6rANhDh33W&amp;sig=_azCrihpJ79jrsLJse0IRPqRBNc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwirzeHdsIPRAhWE7yYKHTfPDM0Q6AEIQDAH#v=onepage&amp;q=milf%20dictionary%20sexually%20attractive%20woman%20who%20is%20a%20mother&amp;f=false|title=Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary|first=Cambridge University|last=Press|date=10 April 2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase's usage has gone from relatively obscure to [[mainstream]] in the media and entertainment.

== Overview ==
This abbreviation is used in colloquial English—instead of the whole phrase. It connotes a sexually attractive mother.&lt;ref name="oxford" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cambridge" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fdp4CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA423&amp;lpg=PA423&amp;dq=milf%20dictionary%20sexually%20attractive%20woman%20who%20is%20a%20mother&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=V9zwkd7ytT&amp;sig=I8QlpStk8qz5M3bynXwZuWmjNTU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwirzeHdsIPRAhWE7yYKHTfPDM0Q6AEIQzAI#v=onepage&amp;q=milf%20dictionary%20sexually%20attractive%20woman%20who%20is%20a%20mother&amp;f=false|title=Professional Learner'S Dictionary of Spoken English | first=Rajendra Kumar | last=Dash | date=1 December 2015|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt.

The concept of the MILF predates the term, as exemplified by Mrs. Robinson in the movie ''[[The Graduate]]'' (1967). The term was first documented in Internet [[Usenet newsgroup|newsgroups]] during the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://groups.google.com/group/alt.mag.playboy/browse_thread/thread/56546dc2e5578c7/ae98e3c554d34114?lnk=st|Usenet_done=%2Fgroup%2Falt.mag.playboy%2Fbrowse_thread%2Fthread%2F56546dc2e5578c7%2Fae98e3c554d34114%3Flnk%3Dst%257CUsenet An example of 1995 internet usage of 'MILF' predating ''American Pie''.]&lt;/ref&gt; It was popularized by the film ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]'' (1999), where [[John Cho]]'s character (simply credited as 'MILF Guy No. 2') used the term to refer to [[Jennifer Coolidge]]'s character Jeanine Stifler.{{citation needed|date = January 2018}}&lt;!-- especially the "it was popularized by" claim --&gt;

A 2007 article in ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine stated that evidence the term had become mainstream included "25,000-plus MILF-branded mugs and tees on [[CafePress|Café Press]] to a rash of hot-mama books (''The Hot Mom's Handbook'', ''Confessions of a Naughty Mommy'', ''The MILF Anthology''), television shows (''[[Desperate Housewives]]'', ''[[The Real Housewives of Orange County]]'', the forthcoming contest ''[[Hottest Mom in America]]'', and a pilot in development called ''MILF &amp; Cookies''), and, of course, a concomitant porn genre".&lt;ref name=NYMagazine&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nymag.com/news/features/2007/sexandlove/30915/ |title=Of MILF and Men |author=Em &amp; Lo |date=24 October 2007 |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |access-date=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of the article went on to ask, "How exactly did a once-taboo erotic fetish become a widespread, culturally sanctioned ideal, a perverse mix of branding and empowerment?"&lt;ref name=NYMagazine /&gt;

==Similar terms==
The term ''[[yummy mummy]]'' is also used along with MILF. The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines the term as "an attractive and stylish young mother".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/english/yummy-mummy |title=yummy mummy – definition of yummy mummy in English from the Oxford dictionary |website=Oxford Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford University Press |access-date=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not yet as widespread in popular culture at large, the forms '''DILF''' (for "Dad/Daddy I'd Like to Fuck") or '''FILF''' (for "Father I'd Like to Fuck") are used among [[Androphilia and gynephilia|androphiles]] to refer to a [[beefcake|sexually attractive]] older man&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/the-gq-guide-to-dilfs |title=How to Be a DILF |work=[[GQ]] |date=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; who is likely a father.

== In popular culture ==
In 2002, a resident of the U.S. state of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] applied for a [[Vanity plate|vanity license plate]] reading "GOTMILF", a parody of the "[[Got Milk?]]" advertising slogan. This plate was approved, but it was later canceled after complaints were filed against it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=End of Road For GOTMILF License Plate|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/crime/end-road-gotmilf-license-plate|work=the smoking gun|access-date=19 June 2012|date= 21 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2003 music video for the song "[[Stacy's Mom]]" by the group [[Fountains of Wayne]] draws on the theme of a MILF in its storyline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZLfasMPOU4|title=Stacy's Mom|people=Fountains of Wayne|publisher=Virgin Records/EMI Music|time=3:00–3:08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first= Will |last= Layman |date= 15 April 2007 |work= [[PopMatters]] |title= Fountains of Wayne: Too Smart to Be a Rock Band, Too Smart to Be Anything Else |access-date= 9 May 2014 |url= http://www.popmatters.com/feature/fountains-of-wayne-too-smart-to-be-a-rock-band-too-smart-to-be-anything-els/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2007, low-cost carrier [[Spirit Airlines]] ran a controversial advertising campaign, using MILF to promote their tropical destinations, based on a different acronym: "Many Islands, Low Fares".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.anna.aero/2008/08/15/fort-lauderdales-spirit-in-the-sky/| title=Fort Lauderdale's Spirit in the sky| date=15 August 2008| publisher=anna.aero}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2009, Spirit ran the campaign again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Over the Line? |series=The O'Reilly Factor |serieslink=The O'Reilly Factor |network=Fox News Channel |airdate=2007-12-11|transcript=Over the Line?|transcript-url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,316578,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, an apparel company, [[True &amp; Co.]], parodied the phrase in advertising for its line of [[bra]]ssieres, converting it to "Mom I'd Like to ''Fit''". The campaign garnered negative attention for the San Francisco-based company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Moran|first1=Lee|title=Lingerie chain's 'MILF'-themed ad campaign sparks anger Consumers who still remember the film 'American Pie' aren't buying bra retailer True &amp; Co.'s ad pitch to the MILF segment: 'Mom I'd Like to Fit.'|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/company-milf-themed-bra-ads-sparks-anger-article-1.1333056|access-date=2 March 2015|location=New York |work=Daily News|date=2 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 article in ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine by [[Purdue University]] sex educator and researcher Justin Lehmiller referenced the work of [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Alfred Kinsey]] to explain the fascination with the MILF phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lehmiller|first1=Justin|title=Why Do Guys Like MILFs?|journal=Playboy|date=24 August 2014|url=http://www.playboy.com/articles/milfs|access-date=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maenghal the Pilgrim''', [[Irish people|Irish]] [[poet]], fl. 844.

Upon the death of King [[Niall Caille]] in 844, ''Maenghal, the pilgrim, said:''

&lt;poem style="margin-left:2em"&gt;
Take with thee the total destruction of Niall,
who was not a judge without judgment;
To the King of heaven let him make submission,

Niall was drowned,
Niall was good;
Niall in the sea,
Niall in fire,
Niall without death.

The '''Melograph''', similar to the '''Melodiograph''', is a mechanical apparatus for [[Ethnomusicology|ethnomusicological]] [[Transcription (music)|transcription]] usually producing some sort of graph that can be preserved and filed, similar to a [[Sound recording and reproduction|recording]] of music. Beginning with attempts by Milton Metfessel in 1928, assorted devices such as this have been developed or manufactured, the most notable dating back to the 1950s and situated at the [[University of California]] in [[Los Angeles]] ([[Charles Seeger]]), the [[University of Oslo]] ([[Olav Gurvin]] and [[Karl Dahlback]]), and the [[Hebrew University]] in [[Jerusalem]] ([[Dalia Cohen]] and [[Ruth Katz]]).

== Earlier use of the term ==
Melograph ''(aka'' '''pianograph, Eidomusikon, Phantasiermachine, notograph, Extemporising Machine''') was a mechanical device that, when attached to a piano, notated on paper – in readable form – the exact, more or less, music played on the instrument.  There were many attempts to invent, re-invent, and the improve the technology:&lt;ref name="Riemann 1908" /&gt;

* 1745: Reverend J. Creed, an English clergyman ("Demonstration of the Possibility of making a machine that shall write Extempore Voluntaries or other Pieces of Music as fast as any master shall be able to play them upon an Organ, Harpsichord, ''etc.")''&lt;ref name="CreedInvention 1746" /&gt;
* 1752: [[Leonhard Euler]] (1707–1783), the mathematician; constructed in 1752 according to Euler's directions by Hohlfeld of Berlin ("Entwurf einer Maschine, wodurch alles, was auf dem Klavier gespielt wird, sich von selber in Noten setzt")
* 1774: John Frederic Unger of [[Einbeck]] (he had an earlier design in 1752)
* 1775: [[Marie Dominique Joseph Engramelle]] [[:fr:Marie-Dominique-Joseph Engramelle|(fr)]] (1727–1805) 
* 1775: v. Elewyck
* 1816: Careyre
* 1816: [[John C. Clifton|John Charles Clifton]] (1781–1841) ("Eidomusicon" or "Eidomkusikon")'
* 1824: [[Jean-Henri Pape]] (1789–1875) of Paris
* 1835:  François Antoine Edouard Keller (1803–1874), the son of [[Georges-Joseph Keller]] [[:fr:Georges-Joseph Keller|(fr)]]
* 1836: M. Eisenmenger of Paris
* 1844: Quérin
* 1855: Juan Nepomuceno Adorno (1807–1880) of Mexico
* Witzels
* Schmeil, a teacher from [[Magdeburg]] ("Notograph")

* 1898: Carl Wilhelm Nyström, [[Karlstad, Sweden]]

None were particularly successful.

'''New Tai Lue script''', also known as Xishuangbanna Dai&lt;ref name="TUS"/&gt; and Simplified Tai Lue, is an [[alphabet]] used to write the [[Tai Lü language]]. Developed in [[China]] in the 1950s, New Tai Lue is based on the traditional [[Tai Tham alphabet]] developed {{circa}} 1200. The government of China promoted the alphabet for use as a replacement for the older script; teaching the script was not mandatory, however, and as a result many are illiterate in New Tai Lue. In addition, communities in [[Burma]], [[Laos]], [[Thailand]] and [[Vietnam]] still use the Tai Tham alphabet.

==Consonants==
===Initials===
Similar to the [[Thai alphabet|Thai]] and [[Lao alphabet|Lao]] scripts, consonants come in pairs to denote two tonal registers (high and low).&lt;ref name="TUS"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode11.0.0/ch16.pdf#G65706|title=The Unicode Standard, Chapter 16.6: New Tai Lue|publisher=Unicode Consortium|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
|-
! align=left | '''High'''
| {{large|ᦀ}} || {{large|ᦂ}} ||| {{large|ᦃ}} || {{large|ᦄ}} || {{large|ᦈ}} || {{large|ᦉ}} || {{large|ᦊ}} || {{large|ᦎ}} || {{large|ᦏ}} || {{large|ᦐ}} || {{large|ᦔ}} || {{large|ᦕ}} || {{large|ᦖ}} || {{large|ᦚ}} || {{large|ᦛ}} || {{large|ᦜ}} || {{large|ᦡ}} || {{large|ᦢ}} || {{large|ᦠ}} || {{large|ᦦ}} || {{large|ᦧ}} || {{large|ᦪ}}

|-
! align=left | '''[[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]'''

|}

===Finals===
Final consonants do not have an inherent /a/ vowel.&lt;ref name="TUS"/&gt;  They are modified forms of initials with a [[virama]]-like hook:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
! '''Final'''
| {{large|ᧅ}} || {{large|ᧆ}} || {{large|ᧇ}} || {{large|ᧂ}} || {{large|ᧃ}} || {{large|ᧄ}} || {{large|ᧁ}}
|-
! '''IPA'''
| /k/ || /t/ || /p/ || /ŋ/ || /n/ || /m/ || /u̯/
|}

==Vowels==
Consonants have a default vowel of /a/.
In the table below, '◌' represents a consonant and is used to indicate the position of the various vowels:
{| class="wikitable"
|- align="center"
! colspan=2 | {{spaces|6}}[[Vowel length|Short]] vowels{{spaces|6}} !! colspan=2 | {{spaces|6}}[[Vowel length|Long]] vowels{{spaces|6}} !! colspan=2 | [[Diphthong]]s with i
|-

|- align="center"
| {{large|ᦵ◌ᦰ}} || /eʔ/ || {{large|ᦵ◌}} || /e/ ||  || 
|- align="center"
| {{large|ᦶ◌ᦰ}} || /ɛʔ/ || {{large|ᦶ◌}} || /ɛ/ ||  || 
|- align="center"
| {{large|◌ᦳ}} || /uʔ/ || {{large|◌ᦴ}} || /u/ || {{large|◌ᦼ}} || /ui̯/
|- align="center"
| {{large|ᦷ◌ᦰ}} || /oʔ/ || {{large|ᦷ◌}} || /o/ || {{large|◌ᦽ}} || /oi̯/

|- align="center"
| {{large|ᦵ◌ᦲᦰ}} || /əʔ/ || {{large|ᦵ◌ᦲ}} || /ə/ || {{large|ᦵ◌ᧀ}} || /əi̯/
|}

In some words, the symbol {{large|ᦰ}} is just used for distinguishing [[homonyms]] or displaying [[onomatopoeiae]].

In [[closed syllables]], long vowels are usually pronounced short except the vowel {{large|ᦱ}}.

==Tones==
New Tai Lue has two tone marks which are written at the end of a syllable: {{large|ᧈ}} and {{large|ᧉ}}.&lt;ref name="TUS"/&gt;
Because consonants come in pairs to denote two tonal registers, the two tone marks allow for representation of six specific tones:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
! !! colspan=3 | High register !! colspan=3 | Low register
|-
! align=left | '''Mark'''
| || {{large|ᧈ}} || {{large|ᧉ}} || || {{large|ᧈ}} || {{large|ᧉ}}
|-
! align=left | '''Shown with k'''
| {{large|ᦂ}} || {{large|ᦂᧈ}} || {{large|ᦂᧉ}} || {{large|ᦅ}} || {{large|ᦅᧈ}} || {{large|ᦅᧉ}}
|-
! align=left | '''IPA'''
| /ka˥/  || /ka˧˥/ || /ka˩˧/ || /ka˥˩/ || /ka˧/ || /ka˩/
|-
! align-left | '''Transcription'''
| ka¹ || ka² || ka³ || ka⁴ || ka⁵ || ka⁶
|}

==Abbreviations==
Two letters are used only for abbreviations:
* Syllable {{large|ᦶᦟᦰ}} (/lɛʔ˧/) can be abbreviated as the character {{large|᧞}}
* Syllable {{large|ᦶᦟᧁᧉ}} (/lɛu˩/) can be abbreviated as the character {{large|᧟}}

== Digits ==
New Tai Lue has its own set of digits:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
|-
! 0 !! 1 !! 2 !! 3 !! 4 !! 5 !! 6 !! 7 !! 8 !! 9
|-
| {{large|᧐}} || {{large|᧑/᧚}} || {{large|᧒}} || {{large|᧓}} || {{large|᧔}} || {{large|᧕}} || {{large|᧖}} || {{large|᧗}} || {{large|᧘}} || {{large|᧙}}
|}

An alternative glyph for one ({{large|᧚}}) is used when {{large|᧑}} might be confused with the vowel {{large|ᦱ}}.&lt;ref name="TUS"/&gt;

== Unicode ==
{{Main|New Tai Lue (Unicode block)}}

New Tai Lue script was added to the [[Unicode]] Standard in March, 2005 with the release of version 4.1.

In June 2015 New Tai Lue was changed from logical ordering used by most Indic scripts to a visual ordering model as used by the Thai and Lao scripts.&lt;ref name="TUS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2014/14250.htm|title=L2/14-250: UTC #141 Minutes|date=2014-11-10|first=Lisa|last=Moore}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unicode.org/L2/L2014/14090-new-tai-lue.pdf|title=L2/14-090: Proposal to Deprecate and add 4 characters to the New Tai Lue block|date=2014-04-23|first=Martin|last=Hosken}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unicode.org/L2/L2014/14195-newtailue.txt|title=L2/14-195: Data on the usage of left-side spacing marks in New Tai Lue|date=2014-08-05|first=Roozbeh|last=Pournader}}&lt;/ref&gt; This change affected the four vowel letters which appear to the left of the initial consonant.

The Unicode block for New Tai Lue is U+1980&amp;ndash;U+19DF:

'''Ndue Sinishtaj''' (August 24, 1944) is an [[Albania]]n poet, and former [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] priest from [[Montenegro]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.shkshz.ch/?faqe=autor&amp;gr=le&amp;au=nsinishta | title=Shoqata e Krijuesve Shqiptarë në Zvicër | publisher=Shoqata e Krijuesve Shqiptarë në Zvicër | accessdate=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; known for writing poems in [[Gheg Albanian]].

==Early life==
Sinishtaj was born in [[Krševo, Montenegro|Krševo]] ({{lang-sq|Këshevë}}), an Albanian village in the [[Gruda (tribe)|Gruda region]] near [[Podgorica]], at the time part of [[Yugoslavia]], but now part of [[Montenegro]]. He was given his nickname, Nokë, by his family. He hails from the Shytaj brotherhood, a large family which numbered about 60 members, all living together in a big house known as the tower of Shytaj. He is the fourth of thirteen children in the Sinishtaj family. As pastoralism was the family occupation and means of survival, he was a shepherd as a child.

He attended elementary school in [[Tuzi]] taught by teachers who spoke the [[Gheg Albanian|Gheg dialect]]. He continued his education in the city of [[Zadar]] and finished classic high school in Pazinit. He studied [[theology]] at schools in the Balkan cities of [[Zagreb]] and [[Rijeka]] finally moving to [[Florence]], [[Italy]] where he graduated in theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nokesinishtaj.weebly.com/biografia.html | title=Nokë Sinishtaj | publisher=Nokë Sinishtaj | accessdate=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intellectual formation==
For Nokë and his family, it was a great honor to be nominated as a Catholic priest and return to Malësia. For five years, Sinishtaj served as a priest in Gusinje, Tuzi, and Hoti. While serving as a priest, he was known for his oratorical skills preaching in church. However, after five years, he left the priesthood to start a family with whom he lives today in Switzerland.

In 2000, many years after leaving the priesthood, he published a book which was both an autobiographical diary and a confessional to justify his decision. The book was entitled ''Confessions of a Rebellious Priest''. In this book Sinishtaj recounts the problems he encountered as a priest. It was because of these events, including hostile behavior, and injustices inside the clergy, that caused him to finally leave the priesthood but not his faith in God.

However he did not stop studying and in 1975 continued his education in [[Philosophy]] and Italian Literature at the [[University of Fribourg]], graduating in 1981. He is currently working as a translator at the Court of [[Lucerne]]. He is a [[polyglot]], speaking: [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Serbo-Croatian]], [[Latin language|Latin]], [[German language|German]], and [[Italian language|Italian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nokesinishtaj.weebly.com/jeta-dhe-veprimtaria.html | title=Nokë Sinishtaj | publisher=Nokë Sinishtaj | accessdate=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nyungwe''' (''Cinyungwe'' or Nhungue) is a [[Bantu language]] of Mozambique. It is used as a [[trade language]] throughout [[Tete Province]].

==Geographic distribution==
Nyungwe is spoken by more than 439,000 people in [[Mozambique]] along the [[Zambezi River]], principally in [[Tete Province]].

==Official status==
While Portuguese is the only official language of Mozambique, Nyungwe is one of the recognized national languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mozambique.mz/pdf/constituicao.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813061409/http://www.mozambique.mz/pdf/constituicao.pdf |archivedate=2012-08-13 |df= }} The constitution of the Republic of Mozambique (pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sitoe, B. e Ngunga, A.

'''Sikaiana''' is a [[Polynesian language]], spoken by about 730 people on [[Sikaiana]] in the Solomon Islands.

==Introduction==

===History===
According to legend, the island was founded by Tehui Atahu, who killed off all the indigenous people and proclaimed himself chief.  Some say that Atahu was from an island called [[Tokelau]], while others speculate he came from Tonga.  But later, Sikaiana was invaded by Tongans, leaving many people who lived on Sikaiana dead. In the late 1920s ritual houses were burned and missionaries from the Melanesian Mission came to Sikaiana and completely converted almost everyone on the island to Christianity.  They burnt down the ritual houses because they believed that people would still have faith in other religions if it were still there. The people were eager to learn to read and write since it offered educational and employment opportunities off the island, which helped contribute to the success of the missionaries (Donner, 2012).

===Population===
The Sikaiana language is a Polynesian outlier language spoken on Sikaiana in the [[Central Province (Solomon Islands)|Central Solomons]], about ninety miles east of the Malaita Island in Polynesia. There are about 730 speakers of this language left in the world, a very low number for any language.

===Classification===
Sikaiana is an [[Austronesian]] language in the Ellicean family. Its sister languages include [[Kapingamarangi language|Kapingamarangi]], [[Nukumanu language|Nukumanu]], [[Nukuoro language|Nukuoro]], [[Nukuria language|Nukuria]], [[Ontong Java language|Ontong Java]], [[Takuu language|Takuu]], and [[Tuvaluan language|Tuvaluan]].

==Sounds==

===Consonants===
Sikaiana uses nine different consonants which are reflexes of the [[Proto-Polynesian]] language.  The consonants include: /p, t, k, f/h, v, s, m, n, and l/.  In most situations, /h/ and /f/ are free in variation, but in many words, only /h/ can be used (Donner 2012).  There is also a length distinctions for consonants.  This sometimes occurs as a result of a non-pronunciation of a vowel.  For example, ''hahai'' changes to ''hhai'' because the first /a/ is simply omitted. Double consonants can also be used as a form of [[reduplication]], showing agreement in verbs with plural subjects, or to mark repeated actions (Donner 2012).

===Vowels===
There are five vowel phonemes in Sikaiana which include: /a, e, i, o, and u/. The /u/ and /i/ are pronounced with the glides /w/ and /y/, usually when preceding /a/.  Like the consonants, they are all reflexes of the Proto-Polynesian language.  Vowel length distinction in Sikaiana is very important for proper pronunciation.  The length distinction for vowels can completely change the word if not pronounced correctly.  For example, the word for shell tool is ''aha'', and the word for cyclone is ''ahaa''.  Such a slight difference in the pronunciation can make a big difference on the meaning of the word, although some native speakers who were born after [[World War II]] don’t know what the original forms of the words are (Donner 1996).

==Grammar==

===Basic word order===
The basic constituent order for Sikaiana is subject verb object.  Although the order may vary, this pattern is always used for short, simple statements.  Object subject verb and object verb subject are not used in any oceanic language, which means that it will not be used in Sikaiana (Lichtenberk, 2012).  In the Sikaiana grammar system, sentences that start with a noun usually do not lead with a [[preposition]], but for noun phrases that follow a verb phrase, it may or may not lead with a preposition (Donner, 2012).  As for nouns and noun phrases, there must always be a preceding article except if it is a noun of place, names, or free pronouns.  The articles that usually precede a noun is either ''te'' or ''n''  The use of these articles makes nouns easily distinguishable from other parts of speech (Donner, 2012).

===Morphology===
Sikaiana uses extensive [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] to transform words to better express more complex sentences.  Like many other Polynesian languages, Sikaiana has two types of nominal possession markers.  There is an alienable marker which is ''a'', and an inalienable marker, ''o''. Pronominal possessive markers differ slightly.  The alienable marker for a pronoun is 'ana'' and the inalienable possession marker is ''ona'.  Pronouns in Sikaiana include singular, first person inclusive, first person exclusive, second person, and third person.  In order to nominalize verbs in Sikaiana, the suffix ''ana'' is added to a verb to nominalize it.  There are also length distinction morphemes used.  For example, ''taku'' means my, and ''takuu'' means axe.

==Vocabulary==
Sikaiana is very similar to the Proto-Polynesian language, so many words that are present in Polynesian languages are also in the Sikaiana language. For example, ''hale'' in Sikaiana means house, and the same word is also house in [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]].

==Endangerment==

===Vitality===
The people of Sikaiana speak the Sikaiana language or Central Solomon Pidgin English.  After WWII, many people from Sikaiana migrated to [[Honiara]], the capital of the Solomon Islands in search of jobs and education (Donner, 2002).  This means that there was a decrease in the use of the language, since Sikaiana was not the language mainly used in that area.  A decrease in the advantages of using the Sikaiana language increases the endangerment of it.

===Materials===
Although there is a decrease in the number of speakers of the Sikaiana language, there is a dictionary which was put together by [[Arthur Capell]] in 1935 which covers vocabulary, grammar, typology, and brief history of the Sikaiana language.  It may be possible for someone to learn how to speak Sikaiana if they read and studied the whole dictionary.  Some other sources are by William Donner, who visited Sikaiana in the 1970s and 1980s, and wrote many things regarding history, language change, culture, and emigration of the Sikaiana people. Most of Donner’s work was published in the Journal Pacific Studies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31955">'''Theories of second-language acquisition''' are various [[Scientific theory|theories]] and [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] in the field of [[second-language acquisition]] about how people learn a [[second language]]. Research in second-language acquisition is closely related to several disciplines including [[linguistics]], [[sociolinguistics]], [[psychology]], [[neuroscience]], and [[education]], and consequently most theories of second-language acquisition can be identified as having roots in one of them. Each of these theories can be thought of as shedding light on one part of the language learning process; however, no one overarching theory of second-language acquisition has yet been widely accepted by [[List of language acquisition researchers|researchers]].

==History==

As second-language acquisition began as an interdisciplinary field, it is hard to pin down a precise starting date.{{sfn|Gass|Selinker|2008|p=1}} However, there are two publications in particular that are seen as instrumental to the development of the modern study of SLA: (1) [[Pit Corder|Corder]]'s 1967 essay ''The Significance of Learners' Errors'', and (2) [[Larry Selinker|Selinker]]'s 1972 article ''Interlanguage''. Corder's essay rejected a behaviorist account of SLA and suggested that learners made use of intrinsic internal linguistic processes; Selinker's article argued that second-language learners possess their own individual linguistic systems that are independent from both the first and second languages.{{sfn|VanPatten|Benati|2010|pp=2–5}}

In the 1970s the general trend in SLA was for research exploring the ideas of Corder and Selinker, and refuting [[behaviorism|behaviorist]] theories of language acquisition. Examples include research into [[Error analysis (linguistics)|error analysis]], studies in [[transitional stages]] of second-language ability, and the "[[morpheme studies]]" investigating the order in which learners acquired linguistic features. The 70s were dominated by [[naturalistic studies]] of people learning [[English as a second language]].{{sfn|VanPatten|Benati|2010|pp=2–5}}

By the 1980s, the theories of [[Stephen Krashen]] had become the prominent paradigm in SLA. In his theories, often collectively known as the [[Input Hypothesis]], Krashen suggested that language acquisition is driven solely by [[comprehensible input]], language input that learners can understand. Krashen's model was influential in the field of SLA and also had a large influence on language teaching, but it left some important processes in SLA unexplained. Research in the 1980s was characterized by the attempt to fill in these gaps. Some approaches included [[Lydia White|White]]'s descriptions of learner competence, and [[Manfred Pienemann|Pienemann]]'s use of speech processing models and [[lexical functional grammar]] to explain learner output. This period also saw the beginning of approaches based in other disciplines, such as the psychological approach of [[connectionism]].{{sfn|VanPatten|Benati|2010|pp=2–5}}

The 1990s saw a host of new theories introduced to the field, such as [[Michael Long (academic)|Michael Long]]'s [[interaction hypothesis]], [[Merrill Swain]]'s [[output hypothesis]], and [[Richard Schmidt (linguist)|Richard Schmidt]]'s [[noticing hypothesis]]. However, the two main areas of research interest were linguistic theories of SLA based upon [[Noam Chomsky]]'s [[universal grammar]], and psychological approaches such as [[Skill-based theories of second-language acquisition|skill acquisition theory]] and [[connectionism]]. The latter category also saw the new theories of [[processability]] and [[input processing]] in this time period. The 1990s also saw the introduction of [[sociocultural theory]], an approach to explain second-language acquisition in terms of the social environment of the learner.{{sfn|VanPatten|Benati|2010|pp=2–5}}

In the 2000s research was focused on much the same areas as in the 1990s, with research split into two main camps of linguistic and psychological approaches. [[Bill VanPatten|VanPatten]] and Benati do not see this state of affairs as changing in the near future, pointing to the support both areas of research have in the wider fields of [[linguistics]] and [[psychology]], respectively.{{sfn|VanPatten|Benati|2010|pp=2–5}}

== Semantic theory ==
{{unsourced section|date=September 2012}}

For the second-language learner, the acquisition of meaning is arguably the most important task. Meaning it is the heart of a language, not the exotic sounds or elegant sentence structure. There are several types of meanings: lexical, grammatical, semantic, and pragmatic. All the different meanings contribute to the acquisition of meaning resulting in the integrated second language possession.&lt;ref&gt;Roumyana Slabakova. Annual Review of Applied Linguistics. Cambridge: Mar 2010. Vol. 30 pg. 231, 17 pgs&lt;/ref&gt;

Lexical meaning – meaning that is stored in our mental lexicon; 

Grammatical meaning – comes into consideration when calculating the meaning of a sentence; usually encoded in inflectional morphology (ex.  - ed for past simple, -‘s for third person possessive) 

Semantic meaning – word meaning;

Pragmatic meaning – meaning that depends on context, requires knowledge of the world to decipher; for example, when someone asks on the phone, “Is Mike there?” he doesn’t want to know if Mike is physically there; he wants to know if he can talk to Mike.

== Sociocultural theory ==
[[Sociocultural theory]] was originally coined by Wertsch in 1985 and derived from the work of [[Lev Vygotsky]] and the [[Vygotsky Circle]] in Moscow from the 1920s onwards. Sociocultural theory is the notion that human mental function is from participating cultural mediation integrated into social activities.&lt;ref&gt;Lantolf, J. P., &amp; Beckett, T. G. (2009). Sociocultural theory and second language acquisition. Language Teaching, 42(4), 459-475. doi: 10.1017/S0261444809990048&lt;/ref&gt;

== Universal grammar ==
{{main|Universal grammar}}
From the field of [[linguistics]], the most influential theory by far has been [[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky's]] theory of [[Universal Grammar]] (UG). The UG model of principles, basic properties which all languages share, and parameters, properties which can vary between languages, has been the basis for much second-language research. 

From a UG perspective, learning the grammar of a second language is simply a matter of setting the correct parameters. Take the ''pro-drop'' parameter, which dictates whether or not [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentences]] must have a [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] in order to be grammatically correct. This parameter can have two values: ''positive'', in which case sentences do not necessarily need a subject, and ''negative'', in which case subjects must be present. In [[German language|German]] the sentence "''Er spricht''" (he speaks) is grammatical, but the sentence "''Spricht''" (speaks) is ungrammatical. In [[Italian language|Italian]], however, the sentence "''Parla''" (speaks) is perfectly normal and grammatically correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cook|2008|p=35}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A German speaker learning Italian would only need to deduce that subjects are optional from the language he hears, and then set his ''pro-drop'' parameter for Italian accordingly. Once he has set all the parameters in the language correctly, then from a UG perspective he can be said to have learned Italian, i.e. he will always produce perfectly correct Italian sentences.

Universal Grammar also provides a succinct explanation for much of the phenomenon of language transfer. Spanish learners of English who make the mistake "Is raining" instead of "It is raining" have not yet set their ''pro-drop'' parameters correctly and are still using the same setting as in Spanish. 

The main shortcoming of Universal Grammar in describing second-language acquisition is that it does not deal at all with the psychological processes involved with learning a language. UG scholarship is only concerned with whether parameters are set or not, not with ''how'' they are set. [[Jacquelyn Schachter|Schachter]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schachter|first=Jacquelyn|date=|title=Second Language Acquisition and Its Relationship to Universal Grammar.|url=|journal=Applied Linguistics|volume=9|pages=219-235|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1988) is a useful critique of research testing the role of Universal Grammar in second language acquisition.

== Input hypothesis ==
{{main|Comprehensible input}}
Learners' most direct source of [[information]] about the target language is the target language itself. When they come into direct contact with the target language, this is referred to as "input." When learners process that language in a way that can contribute to learning, this is referred to as "intake.By the way, the amount of input learners take in is one of the most important factors affecting their learning. However, it must be at a level that is comprehensible to them. In his [[Monitor Theory]], Krashen advanced the concept that language input should be at the "i+1" level, just beyond what the learner can fully understand; this input is comprehensible, but contains structures that are not yet fully understood. This has been criticized on the basis that there is no clear definition of i+1, and that factors other than structural difficulty (such as interest or presentation) can affect whether input is actually turned into intake. The concept has been quantified, however, in vocabulary acquisition research; Nation reviews various studies which indicate that about 98% of the words in running text should be previously known in order for [[extensive reading]] to be effective.&lt;ref name="nation2001"&gt;{{Harvnb|Nation|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his Input Hypothesis, Krashen proposes that language acquisition takes place only when learners receive input just beyond their current level of L2 competence. He termed this level of input “i+1.” However, in contrast to emergentist and connectionist theories, he follows the innate approach by applying Chomsky's [[Government and binding theory]] and concept of [[Universal grammar]] (UG) to second-language acquisition. He does so by proposing a Language Acquisition Device that uses L2 input to define the parameters of the L2, within the constraints of UG, and to increase the L2 proficiency of the learner. In addition, Krashen (1982)’s Affective Filter Hypothesis holds that the acquisition of a second language is halted if the learner has a high degree of anxiety when receiving input. According to this concept, a part of the mind filters out L2 input and prevents intake by the learner, if the learner feels that the process of SLA is threatening. As mentioned earlier, since input is essential in Krashen’s model, this filtering action prevents acquisition from progressing.

A great deal of research has taken place on [[input enhancement]], the ways in which input may be altered so as to direct learners' attention to linguistically important areas. Input enhancement might include bold-faced vocabulary words or marginal [[gloss (annotation)|gloss]]es in a [[reading (activity)|reading]] text. Research here is closely linked to research on [[#Pedagogical effects|pedagogical effects]], and comparably diverse.

== Monitor model ==
{{main|Monitor hypothesis}}
Other concepts have also been influential in the speculation about the processes of building internal systems of second-language information. Some thinkers hold that language processing handles distinct types of knowledge. For instance, one component of the Monitor Model, propounded by Krashen, posits a distinction between “acquisition” and “learning.”&lt;ref name="krashen1982"&gt;{{Harvnb|Krashen|1982}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Krashen, L2 acquisition is a subconscious process of incidentally “picking up” a language, as children do when becoming proficient in their first languages. Language learning, on the other hand, is studying, consciously and intentionally, the features of a language, as is common in traditional classrooms. Krashen sees these two processes as fundamentally different, with little or no interface between them. In common with connectionism, Krashen sees input as essential to language acquisition.&lt;ref name="krashen1982" /&gt; 

Further, Bialystok and Smith make another distinction in explaining how learners build and use L2 and interlanguage knowledge structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bialystok|Smith|1985}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that the concept of interlanguage should include a distinction between two specific kinds of language processing ability. On one hand is learners’ knowledge of L2 grammatical structure and ability to analyze the target language objectively using that knowledge, which they term “representation,” and, on the other hand is the ability to use their L2 linguistic knowledge, under time constraints, to accurately comprehend input and produce output in the L2, which they call “control.” They point out that often non-native speakers of a language have higher levels of representation than their native-speaking counterparts have, yet have a lower level of control. Finally, Bialystok has framed the acquisition of language in terms of the interaction between what she calls “analysis” and “control.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bialystok|1994}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis is what learners do when they attempt to understand the rules of the target language. Through this process, they acquire these rules and can use them to gain greater control over their own production.

Monitoring is another important concept in some theoretical models of learner use of L2 knowledge. According to Krashen, the Monitor is a component of an L2 learner's language processing device that uses knowledge gained from language learning to observe and regulate the learner's own L2 production, checking for accuracy and adjusting language production when necessary.&lt;ref name="krashen1982" /&gt;

== Interaction hypothesis ==
{{main|Interaction hypothesis}}
Long's [[interaction hypothesis]] proposes that language acquisition is strongly facilitated by the use of the target language in interaction. Similarly to [[Stephen Krashen|Krashen]]'s [[Input Hypothesis]], the Interaction Hypothesis claims that [[comprehensible input]] is important for language learning. In addition, it claims that the effectiveness of comprehensible input is greatly increased when learners have to negotiate for [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]].&lt;ref name="Ellis1997"&gt;{{cite book | last = Ellis | first = Rod | title = Second Language Acquisition | publisher = Oxford University Press| series = Oxford Introductions to Language Study | location = Oxford, New York | year = 1997 | isbn = 978-0-19-437212-1 | pages = 47–48 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Interactions often result in learners receiving negative evidence.&lt;ref name="Ellis1997" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RichardsSchmidt2002"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = Interaction Hypothesis | editor1-last = Richards | editor1-first = Jack | editor2-last = Schmidt | editor2-first = Richard | encyclopedia = Longman dictionary of language teaching and applied linguistics | publisher = Longman | location = London New York | year = 2002 | page = 264 | isbn = 978-0-582-43825-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, if learners say something that their interlocutors do not understand, after negotiation the interlocutors may model the correct language form. In doing this, learners can receive [[feedback]] on their [[Speech production|production]] and on [[grammar]] that they have not yet mastered.&lt;ref name="Ellis1997" /&gt; The process of interaction may also result in learners receiving more input from their interlocutors than they would otherwise.&lt;ref name="RichardsSchmidt2002" /&gt; Furthermore, if learners stop to clarify things that they do not understand, they may have more time to [[Speech perception|process]] the input they receive. This can lead to better understanding and possibly the acquisition of new language forms.&lt;ref name="Ellis1997" /&gt; Finally, interactions may serve as a way of focusing learners' [[attention]] on a difference between their knowledge of the [[second language|target language]] and the reality of what they are hearing; it may also focus their attention on a part of the target language of which they are not yet aware.&lt;ref name="GassSelinker2008"&gt;{{cite book | title = Second Language Acquisition: An Introductory Course | last1 = Gass | first = Susan | last2 = Selinker | first2 = Larry | year = 2008 | page = 350 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-8058-5497-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Output hypothesis ==
{{main|Comprehensible output}}
In the 1980s, Canadian SLA researcher [[Merrill Swain]] advanced the output hypothesis, that meaningful output is as necessary to language learning as meaningful input. However, most studies have shown little if any correlation between learning and quantity of output. Today, most scholars {{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} contend that small amounts of meaningful output are important to language learning, but primarily because the experience of producing language leads to more effective processing of input.

== Competition model ==
{{main|Competition model}}
Some of the major cognitive theories of how learners organize language knowledge are based on analyses of how speakers of various languages analyze sentences for meaning. MacWhinney, Bates, and Kliegl found that speakers of English, German, and Italian showed varying patterns in identifying the subjects of transitive sentences containing more than one noun.&lt;ref name="macwhinney1984"&gt;{{Harvnb|MacWhinney|Bates|Kliegl|1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt; English speakers relied heavily on word order; German speakers used morphological agreement, the animacy status of noun referents, and stress; and speakers of Italian relied on agreement and stress. MacWhinney et al. interpreted these results as supporting the Competition Model, which states that individuals use linguistic cues to get meaning from language, rather than relying on linguistic universals.&lt;ref name="macwhinney1984" /&gt; According to this theory, when acquiring an L2, learners sometimes receive competing cues and must decide which cue(s) is most relevant for determining meaning.

== Connectionism and second-language acquisition ==
{{See also|Connectionism}}
These findings also relate to Connectionism. Connectionism attempts to model the cognitive language processing of the human brain, using computer architectures that make associations between elements of language, based on frequency of co-occurrence in the language input.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Christiansen|Chater|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Frequency has been found to be a factor in various linguistic domains of language learning.&lt;ref name="ellis2002"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ellis|2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Connectionism posits that learners form mental connections between items that co-occur, using exemplars found in language input. From this input, learners extract the rules of the language through cognitive processes common to other areas of cognitive skill acquisition. Since connectionism denies both innate rules and the existence of any innate language-learning module, L2 input is of greater importance than it is in processing models based on innate approaches, since, in connectionism, input is the source of both the units and the rules of language.

== Noticing hypothesis ==
{{main|Noticing hypothesis}}
Attention is another characteristic that some believe to have a role in determining the success or failure of language processing. [[Richard Schmidt (linguist)|Richard Schmidt]] states that although explicit metalinguistic knowledge of a language is not always essential for acquisition, the learner must be aware of L2 input in order to gain from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schmidt|1990}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation broken|date=November 2010}} In his “noticing hypothesis,” Schmidt posits that learners must notice the ways in which their interlanguage structures differ from target norms. This noticing of the gap allows the learner's internal language processing to restructure the learner's internal representation of the rules of the L2 in order to bring the learner's production closer to the target. In this respect, Schmidt's understanding is consistent with the ongoing process of rule formation found in emergentism and connectionism.

== Processability ==
{{main|Processability theory}}
Some theorists and researchers have contributed to the cognitive approach to second-language acquisition by increasing understanding of the ways L2 learners restructure their interlanguage knowledge systems to be in greater conformity to L2 structures. Processability theory states that learners restructure their L2 knowledge systems in an order of which they are capable at their stage of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pienemann|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, In order to acquire the correct morphological and syntactic forms for English questions, learners must transform declarative English sentences. They do so by a series of stages, consistent across learners. Clahsen proposed that certain processing principles determine this order of restructuring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clahsen|1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, he stated that learners first, maintain declarative word order while changing other aspects of the utterances, second, move words to the beginning and end of sentences, and third, move elements within main clauses before subordinate clauses.

== Automaticity ==
Thinkers have produced several theories concerning how learners use their internal L2 knowledge structures to comprehend L2 input and produce L2 output. One idea is that learners acquire proficiency in an L2 in the same way that people acquire other complex cognitive skills. Automaticity is the performance of a skill without conscious control. It results from the gradated process of proceduralization. In the field of cognitive psychology, Anderson expounds a model of skill acquisition, according to which persons use procedures to apply their declarative knowledge about a subject in order to solve problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Anderson|1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On repeated practice, these procedures develop into production rules that the individual can use to solve the problem, without accessing long-term declarative memory. Performance speed and accuracy improve as the learner implements these production rules. DeKeyser tested the application of this model to L2 language automaticity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|DeKeyser|1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He found that subjects developed increasing proficiency in performing tasks related to the morphosyntax of an artificial language, Autopractan, and performed on a learning curve typical of the acquisition of non-language cognitive skills. This evidence conforms to Anderson's general model of cognitive skill acquisition, supports the idea that declarative knowledge can be transformed into procedural knowledge, and tends to undermine the idea of Krashen&lt;ref name="krashen1982" /&gt; that knowledge gained through language “learning” cannot be used to initiate speech production.

== Declarative/procedural model ==
[[Michael T. Ullman]] has used a declarative/procedural model to understand how language information is stored. This model is consistent with a distinction made in general cognitive science between the storage and retrieval of facts, on the one hand, and understanding of how to carry out operations, on the other. It states that declarative knowledge consists of arbitrary linguistic information, such as irregular verb forms, that are stored in the brain's [[declarative memory]]. In contrast, knowledge about the rules of a language, such as grammatical word order is procedural knowledge and is stored in [[procedural memory]]. Ullman reviews several psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic studies that support the declarative/procedural model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ullman|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Memory and second-language acquisition ==
Perhaps certain psychological characteristics constrain language processing. One area of research is the role of memory. Williams conducted a study in which he found some positive correlation between verbatim memory functioning and grammar learning success for his subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that individuals with less short-term memory capacity might have a limitation in performing cognitive processes for organization and use of linguistic knowledge.

== Dynamic systems theory==
{{main article|Dynamic approach to second language development}}
Second language acquisition has been usually investigated by applying traditional [[Cross-sectional study|cross-sectional studies]]. In these designs usually a [[pre-test]] [[post-test]] method is used. However, in the 2000s a novel angle emerged in the field of second language research. These studies mainly adopt [[Dynamical systems theory|Dynamic systems theory]] perspective to analyse longitudinal [[time-series]] data. Scientists such as [[Diane Larsen-Freeman|Larsen-Freeman]], [[Marjolijn Verspoor|Verspoor]], [[Cornelis de Bot|de Bot]], [[Wander Lowie|Lowie]], [[Paul van Geert|van Geert]] claim that second language acquisition can be best capture by applying [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal]] [[Case study research|case study research]] design rather than cross-sectional designs. In these studies variability is seen a key indicator of development, [[self-organization]] from a Dynamic systems parlance. The interconnectedness of the systems is usually analysed by [[Correlations|moving correlations]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1581">'''Toquegua''' may be the name of a group of people, and a language, spoken along the Atlantic coast of [[Guatemala]]  and Honduras from the area around the mouth of the [[Lago de Izabal|Golfo Dulce]] to the Ulua river in Honduras.  It is also an elite indigenous family surname in colonial Honduras, and a place name in the Motagua river valley in 1536.  Feldman (1975), largely based on unpublished notes of Nicholas Helmuth conserved in the American Philosophical Society, concludes that Toquegua is a [[Ch'ol language|Ch'ol]] [[Mayan languages|Mayan]]-related language.  Sheptak (2007) contests that identification and concludes the people referred to as the Toquegua were multi-lingual, speaking Yucatec, Ch'ol, Nahuatl, and Lenca.

The Toquegua were merchants of cacao and feathers (particularly quetzal feathers) in the sixteenth century and hosted Yucatec Maya people in their communities.

'''Urban semiotics''' is the study of meaning in urban form as generated by signs, symbols, and their social connotations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Keller, Suzanne |title=Review |journal=Contemporary Sociology, Vol. 17, No. 3. (May, 1988), pp. 346-348 |jstor=2069642}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most urban semiotic theory is based on [[social semiotics]], which considers social connotations, including meanings related to ideology and power structures, in addition to denotative meanings of signs.  As such, urban semiotics focuses on material objects of the built environment, such as streets, squares, parks, and buildings, but also unbuilt cultural products such as building codes, planning documents, unbuilt designs, real estate advertising, and popular discourse about the city,&lt;ref&gt;Gottdiener, M., and Lagopoulos, Alexandros, eds.  ''The City and the Sign: An Introduction to Urban Semiotics'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1986.  p.5&lt;/ref&gt; such as architectural criticism and real estate blogs.

Theorists who take a social semiotic approach to urban semiotics define their discipline in opposition to the methods of [[behavioral geography]], beginning with the work of [[Kevin A. Lynch|Kevin Lynch]] in ''The Image of the City'', which they criticize for being limited by its exclusive focus on the denotative level of communication (recognition of spatial elements, such as paths, as conceptual objects), ignoring the connotative meanings associated with urban forms; instead, urban semioticians argue that urban structures often become recognizable because they have symbolic meaning beyond their functional meanings.  The social semiotic approach to urban semiotics also grew out of a critique of architectural semiotics, which was perceived to be overly attached to linguistic models of semiosis and thus unable to adequately consider the social connotations of signs.&lt;ref&gt;Gottdiener and Lagopoulos, 1986. p.6-13&lt;/ref&gt;

Some theorists have used semiotic models in empirical studies of the construction of meaning in urban environments.  Raymond Ledrut has used questionnaires and interviews about viewers' responses to sets of photographs in order to examine the role of class in shaping mental models of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Ledrut, Raymond.  “The Images of the City,” in ''The City and the Sign: An Introduction to Urban Semiotics'', Gottdienier, M., and Lagopoulos, Alexandros, eds.  New York: Columbia University Press, 1986.  p.219-240.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Martin Krampen]] conducted studies of photograph recognition in order to discover the level of facade detail required to identify building types, and to examine the role of socioeconomic status in shaping preference for building styles.&lt;ref&gt;Krampen, M.  ''Meaning in the Urban Environment''.  London: Pion, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;
