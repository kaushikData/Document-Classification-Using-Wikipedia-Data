{{refimprove|date=December 2013}}
An '''all-star''' (also stylized as '''All-Star''') team is a group of people all having a high level of performance in their field.  Originating in sports, it has since drifted into [[vernacular]] and been borrowed heavily by the [[entertainment industry]].

==Sports==
{{Main|All-star game}}

"All-star" as a sports term refers to individual players named to an "all-star" roster or team representing the top performers (members of such a team were ''all [[wikt:star|star]]s'' from other teams) during and before the end of a season in a given sport, or to a list of top participants who played in individual sports such as [[golf]] and [[bowling]]. Events limited to such honorees are referred to as "all-star games" or events.

In American team sports the premier all-star [[game]]s are the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game]], [[NBA All-Star Game]], [[Pro Bowl]], [[NHL All-Star Game]], and the [[MLS All-Star Game]]. Many all-star teams, such as collegiate "all-conference" and [[All-America]] squads, are recognitions of performance only, without the connotation of those selected ever being teammates in a game.

In [[gaelic games]], the term "all-stars" refers to the [[GAA GPA All Stars Awards]]. These awards involve picking a fantasy team consisting of the top players in each position in the various sports ([[List of All Stars Awards winners (football)|Gaelic football]], [[Ladies' Gaelic football All Stars Awards|Ladies' Gaelic football]], [[List of All Stars Awards winners (hurling)|hurling]], [[Rounders All Stars Awards|rounders]] and [[Camogie All Stars Awards|camogie]]).

==Entertainment==
===Cinema===
The term '''all-star''' also used in films,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Forest Whitaker and Oprah Winfrey head all-star cast in ‘The Butler’ |publisher= Boston Herald| url = http://bostonherald.com/entertainment/movies/movie_reviews/2013/08/forest_whitaker_and_oprah_winfrey_head_all_star_cast_in |date=August 16, 2013| accessdate = 2013-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; often used as a form of [[publicity]] [[gimmick]] to promote the cast of a movie in which a number of high-profile actors appear, sometimes merely in [[cameo appearance|cameo]] roles. An archetype is the 1956 version of ''[[Around the World in 80 Days (1956 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]]''.

===Television===
In television, there are a number of groups who could be considered all-stars. Many reality competition shows produce All-Stars editions, which feature notable and particularly talented contestants of past regular seasons of the show. For example, the reality game show franchise, ''[[Survivor (TV series)|Survivor]]'', has had several editions where some or all of the cast featured are "All Stars". There have been three All-Stars editions of the American reality game show ''[[The Amazing Race]]''. Other all-stars editions of U.S. shows include ''[[Bad Girls All-Star Battle]]'', ''[[America's Next Top Model (season 17)|America's Next Top Model 17]]'', and ''[[Charm School (TV series)|Charm School]]''. ''[[RuPaul's Drag Race]]'' has also had three seasons of an All Stars [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]]. The [[Dancing on Ice (series 9)|ninth series]] of the British television show ''[[Dancing on Ice]]'' was an All-Stars edition.

Another use for all-star contestants is to appear on other reality competition programs (especially if the shows are on the same network). This is especially prevalent on [[CBS]]'s three reality competition programs, ''[[The Amazing Race (U.S. TV series)|The Amazing Race]]'', ''[[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|Survivor]]'' and ''[[Big Brother (U.S. TV series)|Big Brother]]''.

===Video games===
The term "all-stars" has recently been used to describe/title video games that feature large casts of iconic characters in a crossover-type setting. Notable examples include ''[[PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale]]'' and ''[[Warriors All-Stars]]''.

The '''Angkor Wat Marathons''' are the annual [[Marathon]]s held in [[Angkor]], [[Cambodia]]. There are two marathons from Angkor recognised by the [[Association of International Marathons and Road Races]] namely '''Angkor Wat International Half Marathon''' and '''Angkor Empire Marathon'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aimsworldrunning.org/Calendar.htm |title=AIMS – Calendar of Races |publisher=Aimsworldrunning.org |date= |accessdate=2015-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Angkor Wat International Half marathon is held annually since 1996.

According to its official website, the purpose of the event is to "support a ban on the manufacture and inhumane use of antipersonnel mines".&lt;ref name="Site: angkormarathon.org - home"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angkormarathon.org/index.php |title=Site: angkormarathon.org – home |publisher=angkormarathon.org |date= |accessdate=2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bangkokpost1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/asean/447898/cambodian-wins-angkor-wat-international-half-marathon |title=Cambodian wins Angkor Wat marathon |work=Bangkok Post |accessdate=2015-11-03|date = 2014-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Angkor Wat International Half Marathon==
[[File:Yuko Arimori 20081108.jpg|thumb|170px|Japanese Olympian [[Yuko Arimori]] organized the first Angkor Marathon in 1996.]]
The Angkor Wat International Half Marathon was first organized in 1996 by [[Yuko Arimori]], the first Japanese woman to win a marathon medal in the [[Olympics]].&lt;ref name="bangkokpost1"/&gt; The motto of the marathon is "Building a better future. Aid for the children and disabled in Cambodia". It is organized by [[National Olympic Committee of Cambodia]], Association of Athletics Federations Cambodia and Cambodian Events Organizer Co. Ltd. The marathon is recognized by [[Association of International Marathons and Road Races]] and the Association of Athletics Federations Cambodia (Khmer AAF). It is supported by the government of Cambodia, the Embassy of Japan in Cambodia, the [[United Nations Population Fund]], and several other organizations.&lt;ref name="Site: angkormarathon.org - home"/&gt;

The first edition of the International Half Marathon in 1996 saw just 654 participants from 14 countries. Since then participation in the event has steadily increased. In the most recent half marathon, held in December 2014, nearly 8,000 runners from 78 countries participated. The 2015 edition will be held in December.&lt;ref name="bangkokpost1"/&gt;

"'''April in Quahog'''" is the 16th episode of the [[Family Guy (season 8)|eighth season]] of the [[animated cartoon|animated]] [[television comedy|comedy series]] ''[[Family Guy]]''. It originally aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on April 11, 2010. The episode features the [[Griffin family]] as they attempt to live out their last day on [[Earth]], after hearing an announcement on the local news about a [[black hole]] that is sucking in the entire [[Milky Way galaxy|solar system]]. As the countdown approaches zero, [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] suddenly reveals his secret dislike of being in his children's presence, seconds before the world is expected to end. Then it is revealed that it is all an [[April Fools' Day|April Fools']] joke, and Peter is left to attempt to win back his children's respect.

The episode was written by [[John Viener]] and directed by Joseph Lee. It received mixed reviews from critics for its storyline and many cultural references. According to [[Nielsen ratings]], it was viewed in 6.93 million homes in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by James Burkholder, [[Anne Hathaway]] and [[Jason Mraz]], along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. "April in Quahog" was released on [[DVD]] along with ten other episodes from the season on December 13, 2011.

==Plot==
The local news reports that [[Stephen Hawking]] has discovered a new [[black hole]] at the edge of the [[solar system]], but the [[Griffin family]] pays no attention to the announcement. Peter alerts the family that he has been selected for [[jury duty]], which he believes is an exclusive experience. After [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] informs him that everyone serves jury duty at some point, Peter tries to be kicked out of court by annoying the others, expressing fabricated prejudices, singing [[Surfin' Bird]], and attempting to discuss the trial outside of the courtroom. When Peter returns home that night, the local news announces that the Earth will be destroyed by the newly discovered, and continually expanding, black hole within the next 24 hours. Frantic over the news, everyone in [[Quahog, Rhode Island|Quahog]] attempts to live out the best last day possible. [[Carl (Family Guy)|Herbert]] finally attempts to have sex with [[Chris Griffin|Chris]], [[Glenn Quagmire|Quagmire]] has sex with [[List of Family Guy characters#The Swansons|Bonnie]], and Peter finally manages to steal a lion from the zoo and say the [[nigger|"you-know-what word"]] in a black neighborhood (he is well respected as a result). As the countdown reaches its final seconds, Peter confesses to [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] that while he loves her, he hates spending time with his kids. Immediately afterward, the news anchors reveal the black hole report was an [[April Fools' Day|April Fools']] joke.

Stunned at their father's newly revealed hatred, [[Meg Griffin|Meg]], [[Chris Griffin|Chris]] and [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] avoid Peter. After realizing how angry they are, Peter tries to reconcile with his kids by spending time with each of them. However, he and his kids share no common interests and Peter only makes things worse by using the [[methamphetamine]] he had wanted to share with Chris. After a heartfelt speech does not work, Peter finally buys his kids' love by giving them a new [[Xbox 360]], and they proclaim Peter "the best father ever". At the end of the show, Peter plays ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2]]'', albeit terribly, much to the other players' fury, two of them being Quagmire and Joe who tell Peter he sucks at the game.

==Production and development==
[[File:John Viener by Gage Skidmore.jpg|right|thumb|155px|John Viener wrote the episode.]]
As his first official episode for the series, the episode was directed by Joseph Lee, who had previously served as an assistant director and [[storyboard artist]] for the show.&lt;ref name="josephlee"&gt;{{cite web  |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2835602/ |title=Joseph Lee - IMDB.com |publisher=IMDB |accessdate=2010-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the episode was written by series regular John Viener, his second episode for the season, the first being "[[Jerome is the New Black]]".&lt;ref name="cast"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tv.yahoo.com/episode/234816/castcrew |title=Family Guy – April in Quahog Cast and Crew |publisher=[[Yahoo!]] |accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In promoting the episode, an image of [[Stan Smith (American Dad!)|Stan]] and [[Francine Smith]] meeting and speaking with Lois and Peter, along with an image of Peter, [[Brian Griffin|Brian]], [[Joe Swanson|Joe]] and Quagmire drinking cans of beer in front of the house from ''[[King of the Hill]]'' was released by [[20th Century Fox]]. A press release of a purported [[crossover (fiction)|crossover]] was also made public. Having released the information on April Fools' Day, the crossover was revealed to be an April Fools' joke after the episode aired without a crossover occurring.&lt;ref name="pressrelease"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxflash.com/div.php/main/page?aID=1z4 |title=It's the End of the World as They Know It on an All-New "Family Guy" |publisher=Fox Flash |accessdate=2010-04-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328131804/http://foxflash.com/div.php/main/page?aID=1z4 |archivedate=28 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural references==
In the opening scene of the episode, the Griffin family is seen watching the Channel 5 News, with Tricia Takanawa then beginning an interview with [[Stephen Hawking]]. Hawking, who is paralyzed due to neuro-[[muscular dystrophy]], is seen sitting in his wheelchair. After the camera cuts, Hawking then jumps up from his chair, and admits it is just an act, before deciding to go [[surfing]] at the nearby beach.&lt;ref name="sling"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sling.com/blog/7072/%22Family-Guy%22-Non-Sequiturs-Explained!-Episode-8-16%3A-%22April-in-Quahog%22 |title="Family Guy" Non Sequiturs Explained!

In mentioning that he has been summoned for jury duty, and implying its exclusivity, Peter is confronted by Brian who reveals that the only reason he was selected was because he had voted in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|last election]]. Peter goes on to state that he actually stuffed the ballot box at [[Academy Award|the Oscars]], when the nominees included [[Grover]] from ''[[Sesame Street]]'', [[Bluto]] from ''[[Popeye]]'', and [[Daniel Day-Lewis]], among others. Actress [[Anne Hathaway]] presented the award.&lt;ref name="sling"/&gt; Going on to find out that everyone is asked to do jury duty, Peter soon seeks to be kicked out, just as he was from the rock band [[Coldplay]] once he suggested that they write a song that is "not whiny bullcrap".&lt;ref name="sling"/&gt; Further attempting to be kicked out of jury duty, Peter begins singing the song "[[Surfin' Bird]]" by [[The Trashmen]], a song that was first introduced in the series in the [[Family Guy (season 7)|seventh season]] episode "[[I Dream of Jesus]]".&lt;ref name="sling"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ignreview"/&gt;

Before Peter is preparing to leave for jury duty, the family is seen watching a television sitcom entitled ''How Henry Kissinger Met Your Mother'', a parody of the [[CBS]] sitcom ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'', which features [[Henry Kissinger]], whose heavy accent makes his speech unintelligible.&lt;ref name="sling"/&gt; Once Peter is dressed for court, he explains that even the vending machines at the courthouse are out of order, with Brian then being shown dressed and laughing in a similar manner as the [[Hanna-Barbera]] cartoon character [[Muttley]].&lt;ref name="sling"/&gt;

Having learned of the impending [[doomsday event|doomsday]], [[Adam West (Family Guy)|Mayor Adam West]] angrily writes an angry letter to [[outer space]], expressing his intention of punching the constellation [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]]. West then straps on a jetpack, as well as a fishbowl for his helmet, and flies into space, punching the constellation, causing the stars to form into the [[Orion Pictures]] company logo.&lt;ref name="sling"/&gt; After it is revealed by Channel 5 News that the impending doomsday was actually an April Fools' Day joke, Brian reacts by angrily yelling, "You dicks!", a line uttered by Jeff Spicoli, as portrayed by [[Sean Penn]], in the 1982 comedy film ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]''.&lt;ref name="sling"/&gt; Unable to win over his children's affection, Peter decides to buy them an [[Xbox 360]] to earn the respect once more. Before the end credits, Peter is then shown playing the Xbox 360 game ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2]]'' (Team Deathmatch on Favela), much to his children's chagrin. Peter, gamertag 'pgriffin69x', is killed by [[Infinity Ward]]'s former Creative Strategist [[Robert Bowling]], gamertag FOURZEROTWO.&lt;ref name="sling"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ignreview"/&gt;

==Reception==
In a slight decrease from the previous week, the episode was viewed in 6.93 million homes in its original airing, according to [[Nielsen ratings]]. The episode also acquired a 3.4 rating in the 18–49 demographic, beating ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and ''[[The Cleveland Show]]'', as well as the return episode of ''[[American Dad!]]'', which had been put into a temporary hiatus, in order to accommodate ''[[Sons of Tucson]]''. In addition, the episode significantly edged out all three shows in total viewership.&lt;ref name="ratings"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/04/12/tv-ratings-undercover-boss-still-calling-the-shots-as-cbs-wins/47926 |title=TV Ratings: Undercover Boss Still Calling The Shots As CBS Wins |author=Gorman, Bill |date=2010-04-12 |work=TVbytheNumbers |accessdate=2010-04-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415154048/http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/04/12/tv-ratings-undercover-boss-still-calling-the-shots-as-cbs-wins/47926 |archivedate=15 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Assault Rigs''''' is an action game developed and published by [[Psygnosis]], released in 1996 for [[MS-DOS]] and  [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], and a year later for the [[Sega Saturn]] in Japan. The game takes place in the future, where real sport has been overtaken in favour of virtual sport, the most popular of which is Assault Rigs, a tank simulator set inside a 3D virtual environment.

The goal of the single player game is to collect all of the gems in a level, while destroying or avoiding enemies, ultimately reaching the exit. There are 42 levels featuring jump ramps, elevators, skyways, trenches, movable blocks and push rods. There are 20 weapon power-ups, viruses and [[Dolby Surround]] sound. The game has four themes of tanks/environment: VR, Industrial, Military and War. 

''Assault Rigs'' also has the capability to utilize the [[PlayStation Link Cable]], enabling two players to connect two PlayStations and play head-to-head on two televisions. This setup unlocks 15 additional levels that are only available for play using the cable.

The [[MS-DOS]] version has multi-player which can be played with either a [[serial link]] (two player) or a [[computer network|network]] (up to eight players).

==Gameplay==
Players control their rig to collect all the gems in a level and get to the end goal of each of the game's 42 levels. In the Saturn version all of the levels were the same as the PlayStation and PC versions, but they were given different names. Along the way, they can collect various types of weapons from missiles to land mines. Throughout each level, they must contend with various enemies from [[turret]]s to enemy rigs. Aerial enemies called "viruses" also attack the player's rig, while hazards such as electric gates and enemy mines dot each level. There are also mild puzzle-solving elements such as pushing blocks and building bridges.

==Reception==
Air Hendrix of ''[[GamePro]]'' gave the PlayStation version a mixed review. He criticized the oversensitive controls, lack of [[Split screen (computer graphics)|split screen]] multiplayer, background flicker, and inappropriate music, but praised the diverse gameplay, focus on problem-solving, and futuristic graphics, and concluded that "Noodling through ''Assault Rigs'' will be great fun for those who like a touch of thinking with their shooting."&lt;ref name="GPro91"&gt;{{cite magazine |title=ProReview: Assault Rigs |magazine=[[GamePro]] |issue=91|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]] |date=April 1996 |page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Maximum'' gave the game credit for its "increasingly complex level designs" and the diversion of the arena levels, but asserted that "This game, while sounding quite entertaining in theory, unfortunately has a variety of problems in practice", citing poor camera angles, glitching graphics, and an overly easy and linear progression. They gave it 3 out of 5 stars.&lt;ref name="Max3"&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Maximum Reviews: Assault Rigs|magazine=Maximum: The Video Game Magazine|issue=3 |publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=January 1996|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both ''GamePro'' and ''Maximum'' compared the game favorably to ''[[Cyber Sled]]''.&lt;ref name="GPro91"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Max3"/&gt; ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]''{{'}}s brief review deemed the game unexciting and scored it two out of five stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=|first= |title=Every PlayStation Game Played, Reviewed, and Rated|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=25 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=January 1997|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bea''', real name '''Beatrice''', is a fictional character in the UK [[comic strip]] ''[[Dennis the Menace (UK)|Dennis the Menace and Gnasher]]'', from ''[[The Beano]]''. She is Dennis' baby sister, born in issue 2931, dated 19 September 1998.&lt;ref name="Dennis the Menace"&gt;{{cite web|title=Comicvine|url=http://www.comicvine.com/bea-the-mini-menace/29-15377/|accessdate=10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She gets her own comic strip in issue 3737 dated 7 June 2014.

==Character history==
===Introduction to ''The Beano''===

Bea's introduction to the comic began with the edition of 8 August of ''The Beano'' ensuring readers that they may be in for a big surprise. Subsequently, Dennis' strip inside revealed that his mother was in fact pregnant. Dennis, reacting to the news, fainted out of surprise. The next week the comic went through a revamp and the cover showed Dennis' father announcing that he had just become the father to a daughter. The story inside showed Dennis was worried about the news, feeling having a younger sister would tarnish his reputation as a menace. However, his family portrait revealed that his little sister, named Bea, was just as much of a troublemaker as him. These were the first Dennis strips drawn by the new artist [[David Parkins]], who had taken over from the previous artist, [[David Sutherland (comics artist)|David Sutherland]].

Parkins had always intended that the character would be called "Bea" (short for Beatrice), taken partly from the comic's name and evidenced in the yellow-and-black striped [[romper suit]]/[[Infant bodysuit|onesie]] she was seen wearing in her first appearance. However, the comic staff decided to put the name up for vote. The readers seemed to agree with Parkins, as "Bea" won the vote by a nearly two-thirds majority.
Dennis' Mum regularly shouts; "Bea! No!" whenever she does something naughty, the two words evidently making the word "Beano".

===Nigel Parkinson strips (1998–2008)===

In issue 2935 dated 17 October 1998 Bea gained her own solo strip entitled '''''Beaginnings''''' drawn by [[Nigel Parkinson]]. It was here that Bea uttered her first word,  "Mud". Bea was voted naughtiest baby in [[Beanotown]] when she was only a week old, has [[Gnasher and Gnipper|Gnipper]] as her dog, and loves playing with [[Rasher (comics)|Rasher]]. But for five isolated examples, the strip has always been drawn by [[Nigel Parkinson]], who also frequently drew the main ''Dennis'' strip at that time. Issue 2942 (5 December 1998) was a special issue dedicated to her, where she appeared in every strip in the comic.

===Subsequent appearances===

She shares notable similarities with fellow ''Beano'' character, [[Ivy the Terrible]], who, from August 2008, joined Bea in her strip, renamed ''[[Bea and Ivy]]''. Nigel Parkinson continued as artist, as Ivy had been reprinted before the team up.  Bea's own strip returned for a few issues in 2009, however, this was dropped later that year, mainly due to her older brother's [[Dennis and Gnasher (2009 TV series)|relaunch]]. In 2010 Bea joined up with Gnipper and Harley, Gran's pet pig, in a new strip titled '''''The Bea Team''''', the title being a parody of ''[[The A-Team (film)|The A-Team]]'' film which was released around the time the strip was in ''The Beano''. In 2014, Bea returned to her strip drawn by [[Nigel Parkinson]]

Bea makes appearances in the CBBC series ''[[Dennis the Menace and Gnasher (2009 TV series)|Dennis the Menace and Gnasher]]''.

==Physical appearance==

As a pun on her name, Bea dresses only in a yellow and black one piece with a yellow hair band to match. Her appearance is extremely similar to her elder brother's in that she sports jet-black messy hair and a behind the nose grin. After the 2009 re-launch of ''Dennis and Gnasher'', eyelashes were added to her appearance and she became far more baby-like in not only looks but also personality.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3137">[[Comité consultatif international pour la radio|CCIR]] System '''H''' is an analog broadcast [[television]] system primarily used in Belgium, the Balkans and Malta on the UHF bands.

== Specifications ==

Some of the important specs are listed below.&lt;ref&gt;Reference Data for Radio Engineers, ITT Howard W.Sams Co., New York, 1977, section 30&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Channel spacing for CCIR television System H (UHF Bands).jpg|frame|Channel spacing for CCIR television System H (UHF Bands)&lt;br&gt;The separation between the audio and video carriers is 5.5 MHz.]]
A frame is the total picture. The '''frame rate''' is the number of pictures displayed in one second. But each frame is actually scanned twice '''interleaving''' odd and even lines. Each scan is known as a field (odd and even fields.) So '''field rate''' is twice the frame rate. In each frame there are 625 '''lines''' (or 312.5 lines in a field.) So '''line rate''' (line frequency) is 625 times the frame frequency or 625•25=15625&amp;nbsp;Hz.

The RF parameters of the transmitted signal are almost the same as those for [[CCIR System B|System B]] which is used on the 7.0&amp;nbsp;MHz wide channels of the [[VHF]] bands. The only difference to the RF spectrum of the signal is that the vestigial sideband is 500&amp;nbsp;kHz wider at 1.25&amp;nbsp;MHz. Due to this and the extra width of the channel allocations at UHF, the width of the guard band between the channels is 650&amp;nbsp;kHz (assuming the worst case which is when NICAM sound is in use).

== System G ==

Many countries use a variant of system '''H''' which is known as [[CCIR System G|System G]]. System '''G''' is similar to system '''H''' but the lower (vestigial) side band is 500&amp;nbsp;kHz narrower. This makes poor use of the 8.0&amp;nbsp;MHz channels of the UHF bands by merely increasing the width of the guard-band by 500&amp;nbsp;kHz to 1.15&amp;nbsp;MHz. The advantage(?) is that the RF spectrum of system '''G''' (on UHF) is the same as system '''B''' (on VHF), simplifying the band-switching circuitry in VHF/UHF televisions.

'''Capture the flag ''' ('''CTF''') is a traditional outdoor game where two teams each have a [[flag]] (or other marker) and the objective is to capture the other team's flag, located at the team's "base," and bring it safely back to their own base. Enemy players can be "tagged" by players in their home territory and, depending on the rules, they may be out of the game, become members of the opposite team, sent back to their own territory, frozen in place ("in jail") until freed by a member of their own team.

==Overview==
Capture the Flag requires a playing field of some sort. In both indoor and outdoor versions, the field is divided into two clearly designated halves, known as territories. Players form two teams, one for each territory. Each side has a "flag" which is most often a piece of fabric, but can be any object small enough to be easily carried by a person (night time games might use [[flashlight]]s, [[glowstick]]s or [[lantern]]s as the "flags"). Sometimes teams wear dark colors at night to make it more difficult for their opponents to see them. If one team has the opposing team's flag on their territory they may be tagged because they have the opposing team's flag.

The objective of the game is for players to venture into the opposing team's territory, grab the flag and return with it to their territory without being tagged. The flag is defended mainly by tagging opposing players who attempt to take it. Within their territory players are "safe", meaning that they cannot be tagged by opposing players. Once they cross into the opposing team's territory they are vulnerable.

===Location===
The flag is usually placed in a visibly obvious location at the rear of a team's territory. In a more difficult version, the flag is hidden in a place where it can only be seen from one angle. It also might have some challenge involved. For example, the flag could be hidden in the leaves up in a tall tree, and the players have to see the flag, then knock it out and bring it to their base.

===Jail===
Different versions of Capture the Flag have different rules, both for handling the flag and for what happens to tagged players. A player who is tagged may be eliminated from the game entirely (out of the game), be forced to join the opposing team, sent back to their own territory, or be placed in "jail" with or without a guard (according to the number of people in a team).&lt;ref name="scouts"/&gt; The jail is a predesignated area of the group's territory which exists for holding tagged players and is normally towards the back of the group's territory.

While tagged players may be confined to jail for a limited, predetermined time, the most common form of the game involves the option for a "jailbreak". In this version, players who are tagged remain in jail indefinitely. However, players from their own team may free them from jail by means of a jailbreak.&lt;ref name="scouts"/&gt; Jailbreaks are accomplished by a player running from their own territory into the enemy's jail. Such action may, depending on the rules, free all jailed players&lt;ref name="scouts"/&gt; or simply those who are physically touched by the one performing the jailbreak. But in some variants team mates who got tagged can be jailed only 3 times or they are kicked from the game until the next round. In general freed players are obligated to return directly to their own territory before attempting offensive action (''i.e.,'' attempting to grab the flag).

While they return to their own side, freed players usually acquire "free walk-backs", in which they are safe from tagging until they reach their home territory. The player performing the jail break, on the other hand, is neither safe, nor restricted from performing other actions such as attempting to grab the flag or generally moving about enemy territory. Sometimes, players in jail form chains, so that if a teammate tags one person in the chain, everyone is free. Simply leaving jail without being freed is considered poor sportsmanship and is severely frowned upon, often leading to expulsion from the game. If all players on one team are jailed (meaning no teammate can free them from jail), then the other team will have all the time they want to find the other team's flag.

===Capturing the flag===
[[File:River Ridge 2007.jpg|thumb|upright|An [[ECyD]] member playing a variation of capture the flag, in which the "flag" is a softball, at Camp River Ridge in [[Indiana]]]]
The rules for the handling of the flag also vary from game to game and deal mostly with the disposition of the flag after a failed attempt at capturing it. In one variant, after a player is tagged while carrying the flag, it is returned to its original place. In another variant, the flag is left in the location where the player was tagged. This latter variant makes offensive play easier, as the flag will tend, over the course of the game, to be moved closer to the dividing line between territories. In some games, it is possible for the players to throw the flag to teammates. As long as the flag stays in play without hitting the ground, it is allowed for the players to pass.

When the flag is captured by one player, they're not safe from being tagged, unless they trip. Sometimes, the flag holder may not be safe at all, even in their home territory, until they obtain both flags, thus ending the game. But they have the option to return to their own side or hand it off to a teammate who will then carry it to the other side. In most versions, they may not throw the flag but only hand it off while running. The game is won when a player returns to their own territory with the enemy flag or both teams' flags. Also, as a general rule, the flag carrier may not attempt to free any of their teammates from jail.&lt;ref name="scouts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usscouts.org/games/game_cf.asp |title=USSSP - Games - Capture the Flag |publisher=Usscouts.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Variants===
Alterations may include "one flag" CTF in which there is a defensive team and an offensive team, or games with three or more flags. In the case of the latter, one can only win when all flags are captured, not only one.

Another variation is when the players put bandannas in their pockets with about six inches sticking out. Instead of tagging your opponents, you must pull your opponent's bandanna out of their pocket. No matter where a player is when their bandanna is pulled, they're captured and must, depending on the preferences of the players, go to jail, or return to their base before returning to play. In this version there is no team territory, only a small base where the team's flag is kept. To win, one team must have both of the flags in their base.

In some urban settings, the game is played indoors in an enclosed area with walls, similar to the walls in a hockey rink. There is also a spot sticking out of the back of the opposing ends which is connected to the playing area for the flag to be placed in. In this urban variation, legal checking hockey style and legal checking against the boards is allowed. A player who commits a [[Foul (sports)|foul]] or illegal check is placed in a penalty box for a specified amount of time, depending on the severity of the foul. A player who deliberately injures an opponent is expelled from the rest of the game. Throwing the flag is allowed in this variation, as long as the flag is caught before it hits the ground. If the flag is thrown to a teammate but hits the ground before it can be caught, the flag is placed from the spot of the throw. If a player throws the flag, but is blocked or intercepted by a player from the opposing team, the flag is placed back at the base.

It is not uncommon for airsoft, paintball, Nerf and water warriors to play CTF. Typically there are no territories in these versions. Players who are "hit" must sit out a predetermined amount of time before returning to play (respawning).

====Stealing sticks====
"Stealing sticks" is a similar game played in the British Isles, the United States, and Australia. However, instead of a flag, a number of sticks or other items such as coats or hats are placed in a "goal" on the far end of each side of the playing field or area. As in capture the flag, players are sent to a "prison" if tagged on the opponents' side, and may be freed by teammates. Each player may only take one of their opponents' sticks at a time. The first team to take all of the opponents' sticks to their own side wins.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jessie H. Bancroft]] (1909).

In 1984, Scholastic published ''Bannercatch''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/v3n7/reviews.html |title=8-Bit Product Reviews: Bannercatch, Simulated Computer, Title Bout, MegaFont II, Boulder Dash, Operation Whirlwind, Songwriter, Video Billboard, Relax, The Institute, Montezuma's Revenge, CityWriter |publisher=Atarimagazines.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[Apple II]] and [[Commodore computer]]s. An [[edutainment]] game with recognizable capture-the-flag mechanics, ''Bannercatch'' allows up to two humans (each alternating between two characters in the game world) to play capture the flag against an increasingly difficult team of four AI bots. ''Bannercatch''{{'}}s game world is divided into quadrants: home, enemy, and two "no-mans land" areas which hold the jails. A successful capture requires bringing the enemy flag into one team's "home" quadrant. Players can be captured when in an enemy territory, or in "no-mans land" while holding a flag. Captured players must be "rescued" from their designated jail by one of the other members of the team. Fallen flags remain where they dropped until a time-out period elapses, after which the flag returns to one of several starting locations in home territory. The 2D map also features walls, trees and a moving river, enabling a wide variety of strategies. Special locations in the play area allow humans to query the game state (such as flag status) using binary messages.

In 1992, Richard Carr released an [[MS-DOS]] based game called ''Capture the Flag''. It is a turn-based strategy game with [[Real-time computing|real time]] network / [[modem]] play (or [[Play-by-mail game|play-by-mail]]) based around the traditional outdoor game. The game required players to merely move one of their characters onto the same square as their opponent's flag, as opposed to bringing it back to friendly territory, because of difficulties implementing the [[artificial intelligence]] that the computer player would have needed to bring the enemy flag home and intercept opposing characters carrying the flag. {{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} The 2013 videogame ''[[TagPro]]'' revisited the genre.

[[File:DEF CON 17 CTF competition.jpg|thumb|A team competing in the CTF competition at [[DEF CON]] 17]]
In [[computer security]], Capture the Flag (CTF), a type of [[cryptosport]], is a computer security competition. CTF contests are usually designed to serve as an educational exercise to give participants experience in securing a machine, as well as conducting and reacting to the sort of attacks found in the real world. Reverse-engineering, network sniffing, protocol analysis, system administration, programming, and cryptanalysis are all skills which have been required by prior CTF contests at DEF CON. There are two main styles of capture the flag competitions: attack/defense and [[Jeopardy!]].

In an attack/defense style competition, each team is given a machine (or a small network) to defend on an isolated network. Teams are scored on both their success in defending their assigned machine and on their success in attacking the other team's machines. Depending on the nature of the particular CTF game, teams may either be attempting to take an opponent's flag from their machine or teams may be attempting to plant their own flag on their opponent's machine. Two of the more prominent attack/defense CTF's are held every year at [[DEF CON (convention)|DEF CON]], the largest hacker conference, and the [[New York University|NYU]]-CSAW (Cyber Security Awareness Week), the largest student cyber-security contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infamoussyn.com/2014/09/22/csaw-ctf-qual-2014-csaw2013reversing2-exe-writeup/|title=CSAW CTF Qual 2014 – csaw2013reversing2.exe Writeup|author=|date=22 September 2014|website=infamoussyn.com|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usf.edu/engineering/documents/01132015-csaw-finals.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jeopardy!]]-style competitions usually involve multiple categories of problems, each of which contains a variety of questions of different point values and difficulties. Teams attempt to earn the most points in the competition's time frame (for example 24 hours), but do not directly attack each other. Rather than a race, this style of game play encourages taking time to approach challenges and prioritizes quantity of correct submissions over the timing.

==Urban gaming==
Capture the Flag is among the games that have made a recent comeback among adults as part of the [[urban gaming]] trend (which includes games like [[Pac-Manhattan]], [[Fugitive (game)|Fugitive]] and [[Manhunt (people game)|Manhunt]]). The game is played on city streets and players use cellphones to communicate. News about the games spreads virally through the use of [[blog]]s and [[mailing list]]s. Urban Capture the Flag has been played in cities throughout North America. One long running example occurs on the [[Northrop Auditorium|Northrop Mall]] at the [[University of Minnesota]] on Fridays with typical attendance ranging from 50 to several hundred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mndaily.com/2005/09/19/game-captures-campus-attention?page=2&amp;quicktabs_6=1 | title=Game Captures Campus Attention | publisher=www. mndaily.com | date=2005-09-19 | accessdate=2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ecco the Dolphin''''' is an [[action-adventure game]] originally developed by [[Ed Annunziata]] and [[Novotrade International]] for the [[Sega Genesis]] known as the [[Mega Drive]] in regions outside of North America and published by [[Sega]] in 1992. ''Ecco the Dolphin'' was [[Digital distribution|republished digitally]] via [[Nintendo]]'s [[Virtual Console]] in 2006,&lt;ref name='Wii1'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wii.nintendo.com/vc_gamepage.jsp?title=ecco_the_dolphin |title=Wii.Nintendo.com - Wii Virtual Console games - ''Ecco the Dolphin'' |accessdate=2007-09-25 |year=2007 |work=Nintendo |publisher=Nintendo |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070518211541/http://wii.nintendo.com/vc_gamepage.jsp?title=ecco_the_dolphin |archivedate=2007-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Microsoft]]'s [[Xbox Live Arcade]],&lt;ref name='MS1'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/e/eccothedolphinxboxlivearcade/default.htm |title=''Ecco the Dolphin'' - Game Detail Page |accessdate=2007-09-25 |year=2007 |work=[[Microsoft]] |publisher=Microsoft |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070823233821/http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/e/eccothedolphinxboxlivearcade/default.htm |archivedate = 2007-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steam (software)|Steam]],&lt;ref name="steam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/34274/|title=Ecco the Dolphin™ on Steam|publisher=Store.steampowered.com|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[iOS]], and [[Nintendo 3DS]].

It is the first installment in the [[Ecco the Dolphin (series)|''Ecco the Dolphin'' video game franchise]]. The [[player character]] is a [[bottlenose dolphin]] who travels through time to combat hostile [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]] in Earth's oceans and on an alien [[spacecraft]].

==Gameplay==
[[Image:MD Ecco the Dolphin.png|left|thumb|''Ecco the Dolphin'' for the [[Sega Genesis]]]]

Attacking enemies is accomplished by making Ecco ram into them at high speeds. Swimming can be made progressively faster by tapping a certain button, and the speed can be maintained by holding it down. Players can perform a purely aesthetic spin in the air when jumping out of the water.

Two features of the game play on actual dolphin habits; one button causes Ecco to [[Whale song|sing]], allowing him to speak with other [[cetacea]]ns and interact with certain objects. The same button is used for [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]]; holding it down causes the song to return, generating a map of the area. Several levels contain enormous crystals called ''glyphs'', which respond in different ways if Ecco touches or sings to them. Some block paths, and a "Key-Glyph" must be found in such cases to pass. Others give information, and a few in later levels replenish health/air and give Ecco temporary invulnerability.

Additionally, Ecco, being a [[mammal]], must surface periodically for air, or else find an air vent. If the "air meter" runs out, Ecco loses health rapidly, which represented drowning. His health is measured by a separate meter (above the air meter); it is depleted by enemies or when his air meter runs out, and it is recharged by eating fish, "singing" to [[clam]]s, or, later in the game, singing to special statues or crystals called "glyphs". Ecco's song can be optionally upgraded at two points in the game: one upgrade allows Ecco's song to be used in combination with a charge as a long-range weapon, and the other temporarily disorients sharks and makes minor enemies freeze temporarily. Touching any enemy by any means other than an attack causes Ecco to sustain damage. The enemies range from seahorses to giant octopodes.

The penultimate level of the game is titled "Welcome to the Machine", named after "[[Welcome to the Machine]]", a song on [[Pink Floyd]]'s 1975 studio album ''[[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album)|Wish You Were Here]]''. ''[[Ecco: The Tides of Time]]'' (1994) features a level called "New Machine", named after "[[A New Machine]]", a two-part song on Pink Floyd's 1987 album ''[[A Momentary Lapse of Reason]]''.&lt;ref name='ARKON'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arkonviox.com/pink-floyd.htm |title=Arkonviox.com - Welcome to the Machine and Pink Floyd |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707162302/http://www.arkonviox.com/pink-floyd.htm |archivedate=2011-07-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The game begins with Ecco, a [[bottlenose dolphin]], as he and his pod are [[aquatic locomotion|swimming]] in their home bay. One podmate challenges him to see how high into the air he can jump. When he is in the air, a [[waterspout]] forms and sucks up all marine life in the bay except Ecco, leaving him alone in the bay. Upon leaving the bay to search for his pod, he contacts several [[dolphins]] from other pods, who tell him the entire sea is in chaos, and that all marine creatures had felt the storm. An [[orca]] tells Ecco to travel to the [[Arctic]] to find a [[blue whale]] named the "Big Blue", who is revered among marine mammals for its age and wisdom. Once Ecco finds him, the Big Blue tells him such storms had been occurring every 500 years and directs him to the Asterite, the oldest creature on Earth. He leaves the Arctic and travels to a deep cavern where he finds the Asterite. Although it has the power to aid him, one of its globes is missing, and needs it returned. However, this can only be achieved by [[time travel|traveling back in time]] using a machine built by the ancient [[Atlantis|Atlanteans]].

Ecco travels to the sunken city of Atlantis, where he discovers the time machine and an ancient library. He learns the cause of the storm; it was a harvest of Earth's waters that was conducted every 500 years by an alien species known as the Vortex. The Vortex had lost their ability to make their own food, and so every 500 years, they would harvest from the waters of Earth. Learning this, he activates the time machine and travels 55 million years into Earth's past. While Ecco is in the past he learns an ancient song to communicate is a [[Pteranodon]]. Ecco locates the Asterite in the past but is immediately attacked by it. Forced into battle, he manages to dislodge a globe from it. This opens a time portal and he is sent back into the present. After receiving the globe, the Asterite grants him the power to turn his sonar into a deadly weapon against the Vortex, as well as the abilities to breathe underwater and to slowly regenerate lost health. The Asterite instructs him to use the time machine to travel back in time to the hour of the harvest. This time he manages to be sucked into the waterspout with his pod. Once inside the waterspout, Ecco makes his way towards the Vortex Queen, the leader of the Vortex race. Ecco destroys the Vortex Queen and his pod returns home.

==Development==
The existence of ''Ecco the Dolphin'' had been heavily rumored throughout the industry before it was finally revealed by Sega in 1992 as a Genesis exclusive, then simply known as ''Dolphin''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Genesis Preview:Dolphin |magazine= GamePro |location= |publisher= GamePro Publishing |date= November 1992 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After deciding to create a game based around dolphins, developer [[Ed Annunziata]] carried out research on the subject and was particularly inspired by the book ''Sounding'' by Hank Searls which explained how the creatures use [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]].&lt;ref name="gamingfurever.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamingfurever.com/editorials/727-sef-s-interview-with-ed-annunziata-game-designer-of-ecco-the-dolphin|title=Sef's Interview with Ed Annunziata, Game Designer of Ecco the Dolphin - Gaming Furever|author=|publisher=Gamingfurever.com|accessdate=21 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129053905/http://www.gamingfurever.com/editorials/727-sef-s-interview-with-ed-annunziata-game-designer-of-ecco-the-dolphin|archivedate=29 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Annunziata worked with the music team on the soundtrack, playing them songs by [[Pink Floyd]] to illustrate the feeling he was aiming for.&lt;ref name="gamingfurever.com"/&gt; Annunziata later said, "I was paranoid about game rentals and kids beating the game over the weekend. So.. I.. uh... made it hard."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://twitter.com/edannunziata/status/285469578635640832 285469578635640832]." [[Ed Annunziata]] at [[Twitter]]. Retrieved on January 30, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  His favourite level was Welcome to the Machine, which was "way over the top challenging"&lt;ref name="gamingfurever.com"/&gt;

The name Ecco comes from [[John C. Lilly]], where, during his experiments with psychoactive drugs, he claims to have met a series of cosmic entities dubbed Earth Coincidence Control Office (E.C.C.O.).  In his life, Lilly was involved in extensive research involving dolphins, compiling his work's findings in the book The Mind of the Dolphin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8_zmoQEACAAJ|title=The Mind of the Dolphin: A Nonhuman Intelligence|first=John Cunningham|last=Lilly|date=1 May 2015|publisher=Gateways Books &amp; Tapes|accessdate=6 September 2016|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The game takes much inspiration from Lilly's work with dolphins and his experiments with psychedelic substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/the-ketamine-secrets-of-segas-ecco-the-dolphin-347|title=The Ketamine Secrets of Sega’s ‘Ecco the Dolphin’ - VICE - United Kingdom|date=16 March 2015|publisher=|accessdate=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ed Annunziata himself has stated on his Facebook page: "I did read a lot from John C Lilly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/cavernsofhope/posts/519280751425243%20So|title=Ecco the Dolphin: Caverns of Hope - Timeline - Facebook|publisher=|accessdate=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sega Mega Drive version became a bestseller.&lt;ref&gt;Official Gallup UK Mega Drive sales chart, April 1993, published in ''Mega'' issue 7.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Mega (magazine)|Mega]]'' placed the game at #24 in their Top Mega Drive Games of All Time.&lt;ref&gt;''Mega'' magazine issue 26, page 74, [[Maverick Magazines]], November 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; On release, ''[[Famicom Tsūshin]]'' scored the Mega-CD version of the game a 27 out of 40.&lt;ref&gt;NEW GAMES CROSS REVIEW: エコー・ザ・ドルフィン CD.

A reviewer for ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' called the PC release "little more than a conversion from the yesteryears of the 16-bit Sega Genesis. Except for a few video cut-scenes, there is little attempt to make this game look or play better for the PC." He nonetheless praised the game not only for its novel concept and responsive controls, but also "its smooth graphics".&lt;ref name="NGen15"&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Ecco the Dolphin|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=15 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=March 1996|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

img=Gonggi pebbles.jpg|caption=Plastic gonggi stones.|
hangul=공기 or&lt;br /&gt;공기놀이|rr=gonggi or&lt;br /&gt;gongginori|mr=konggi or kongginori}}
'''Gonggi''' (공기, pronounced gong-gee) is a popular [[Korea]]n children's [[game]] that is traditionally played using 5 or more small grape-sized pebbles. Nowadays, children buy colourful plastic stones instead of finding pebbles. It can be played alone or with friends.  The stones are called ''gonggitdol'' ({{lang|ko-Hang|공깃돌}}), which means "gonggi stones."  Since only a few stones and a flat surface are needed for play, the game can be played by anyone almost anywhere. This same game also exists in Nepal and it is called 'gatti'.

They are called 'Jjagebatgi' in Gyeongsangbuk-do, 'Salgu' in Gyeongsang-nam-do, and 'Datjjakgeoli' in Jeollanam-do.&lt;ref&gt;[http://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Contents/SearchNavi?keyword=%EA%B3%B5%EA%B8%B0%EB%86%80%EC%9D%B4&amp;ridx=0&amp;tot=379 공기놀이:Encyclopedia of korea cultuere]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Game Play==
The game generally begins with each player tossing the stones from the palm of their hand into the air. While airborne, the player switches his hand backside up. The gonggi stones are then caught on the back of the hand. The person with the leading amount plays first.
[[File:Gonggi play.webm|thumb|How to play gonggi]]
* Level 1: The stones are thrown on the playing surface and the player picks a stone to throw up in the air. While airborne, the player picks up one stone on the playing surface. Then, the player catches the stone. These steps are repeated until all the stones have been caught. 
* Level 2: The stones are thrown on the playing surface again. However, at this level, the player picks up the stones two at a time.
* Level 3: The stones are thrown on the playing surface. The stones are picked up once in a cluster of three, and the other in the amount of one.
* Level 4:  The player throws one stone in the air, places the others on the surface, and catches the airborne stone. Then the player tosses the same stone again, but this time, picks up the four clustered stones on the playing surface and catches the airborne stone.
* Level 5:  The player tosses the stones from the palm of their hand into the air. While airborne, the player switches his hand backside up. The stones are then caught on the back of the hand. Then, the player throws the stones in the air and catches them. The number of stones caught amount to the score. There are various tricks in this phase. Some examples are "The Dragon" and "The Clap–Toss". However, such ostentations are not allowed in official game play.

==Various Tricks in Level 5==
* Dragon
While the stones are airborne, the player switches their hand backside up, catches several stones, switches their hand backside down, and catches the stones that are left over.
* Clap Toss
While the stones are airborne, the player claps their hand before catching the stones.

Both “dragon” and “clap-toss” gives the player twice the score; twice the number of stones.

==Crisis==
We call this game crisis because when a player reaches a certain score, the player has to go through crisis. In Korea, the crisis scores are usually the multiples of 5(5, 10, 15, ... ) or numbers that include 3, 6, or 9(3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 19, 23, 26, 29, 30, ….). When a player reaches a crisis score, the rules become different:

* Level 1: The stones are thrown on the playing surface by the player. However, unlike the original game, where the player can choose which stone to throw up first, in crisis, other players choose the first stone for the player. The steps that follow after are the same. While the first stone is airborne, the player picks up another stone on the playing surface. Then, the player catches the stone. These steps are repeated until all the stones get caught.
Since other players don’t want the player to earn more points, they choose the stone that is the hardest for the player to carry on. For example, in the first level, if two stones touch each other, other players make sure not to choose either one of the two stones. As a result, the player has to go through a crisis of needing to grab each stone without touching the other stone.

* Level 2&amp;3: The stones are thrown on the playing surface again, and like level 1, other players choose the first stone to throw for the player. Other steps are the same.
* Level 4: The player covers their hand over the 5 stones and shakes it on the ground. When another player shouts, “stop!”, the player stops shaking. One of the other players picks up one stone carefully and throws it at the other 4 stones. The player picks up the stone that was thrown and continues level 4 by throwing it up in the air, grabbing the other stones, and catching the airborne stone.
Other players try to throw the stone with accuracy and strength in order to make the other 4 stones scatter. The more they scatter, the harder it is for the player to grab at 4 stones at once.

* Level 5: Before the player tosses the stones from the palm of their hand into the air, other players choose between ‘even’ and ‘odd’. The player has to catch that amount of stones on the back of the hand. For example, if other players call out ‘odd,’ the player has to catch either 1 or 3 or 5 stones. If the player fails to do that, the stones go on to the next person, and the player has to do level 5 again in the next turn.

==Snail==
This game is usually introduced to children before they learn how to play gonggi. The main and the only difference between snail and gonggi is how to grab the stone. In snail, the edge of the player’s hand has to be stuck on the ground at every step. Instead of throwing a stone up in the air, the player sweeps his hand across the ground in a large circle and grabs a certain number of stones. The number of stones the player has to grab at once is same as gonggi. Snail is an easy way to make oneself familiar with the number of stones one has to catch at each level.

==Genius Gonggi==
This game is taught to people who are adept in playing gonggi. The difference from gonggi is that the player doesn’t throw one stone in the air but all stones that are in the player’s hand. After throwing multiple stones, the player grabs other stone(s) from the ground and catches all the stones they threw. Like snail, the number of stones the player has to grab is same as gonggi.

==Playing Calls==
There are many playing calls in the Gonggi game. The standard calls have been listed here. The penalty for a "mess–up" requires that the player who has perpetrated it pass the stones  to the next player.

* A "double touch" occurs when a player physically touches the Gonggi stone(s) more than once.  
* A "mushroom" or a "diamond" occurs when a Gonggi stone is balanced on a diagonal position. In some versions, this orientation may be worth either extra points or the instant end of the player's turn.
* An "overhead" occurs when a player throws a Gonggi stone in any distance above their head.
* A "drop" occurs when a player, after catching all 5 Gonggi stones, drops a stone on to the playing surface.
* A "fixation" occurs in level 5 when a player deliberately adjusts the Gonggi stones in their hand.
* An "interception" is when another person distracts the person who is currently playing.
* A "kong" occurs when a player fails catch the stone at once and catches it by bouncing it on their hand several times accidentally.
* A "movement" occurs when a player moves their position to catch or grab another stone. It is forbidden in the official game but is usually allowed in other games.
* A "tree frog" occurs when a player, in level 3, picks up one stone first, and then pick the leftover three. (The player is supposed to pick the cluster of three first, and then the amount of one)

'''''Hi and Lois''''' is an American [[comic strip]] about a [[suburban]] family. Created by [[Mort Walker]] and illustrated by [[Dik Browne]], it debuted on October 18, 1954, distributed by [[King Features Syndicate]]. &lt;ref name="rg"&gt;Ron Goulart. ''The Funnies:100 years of American comic strips''. Holbrook, Mass. : Adams Pub., 1995. {{ISBN|1-55850-539-3}} (p. 110) &lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==
The Flagstons first appeared in Walker's ''[[Beetle Bailey]]''.  They [[Spin-off (media)|spun off]] into their own strip, written by Walker and drawn by Browne. Lois Flagston (née Bailey) is Beetle Bailey's sister, and the two strips make occasional crossovers. One of these occurred on the strip's 40th anniversary in 1994, when Beetle visited his sister Lois and her family. Chip resembles his Uncle Beetle in attitude and appearance, especially the eyes.

[[image:Bestofhiandlois.jpg|thumb|right|280|''The Best of Hi and Lois'' (1986) was reprinted in 2005.]]
The strip made efforts to keep up with the times, such as housewife Lois Flagston taking a career in [[real estate]] in 1980. In previous decades the strip was acclaimed; in 1962 it earned Browne a [[Reuben Award]] from the [[National Cartoonists Society]].

The strip faced some controversy given the changes in content restrictions since its debut in the 1950s.  Once, editors insisted that [[belly button]]s could not appear; in protest, Browne included a box of dimpled [[navel orange]]s.

Now [[zombie strip|produced by the sons]] of the original creative team, the strip is written by Brian and Greg Walker, and drawn by [[Chance Browne|Robert "Chance" Browne]] and Eric Reaves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hiandlois.com/the_creators Hi &amp; Lois - The Creators]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2016, ''Hi and Lois'' appears in 1,000 newspapers around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Dwyer, Ed. [https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/2016/11/the-funny-papers/ "CULTURE: The Funny Papers: Newspapers may be in trouble, but the comic strip is alive and well — and flourishing online,"] ''Saturday Evening Post'' (November 7, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comic books===
The Flagston family was also featured in a series of [[Charlton Comics|Charlton]] [[comic books]].  Eleven issues were produced from November 1969 to July 1971.  Cover price was fifteen cents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicvine.com/hi-and-lois/49-36612/ |title=Hi and Lois (Volume) |publisher=Comicvine.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characters==
*'''Hi and Lois Flagston:''' Hi (short for [[Hiram (name)|Hiram]]{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}) and Lois are typical middle-class American suburbanites. Their names are a pun on the "opposite" terms of "high and low". Hi is a sales manager. Lois is a realtor. Hi and Lois have four children.
*'''Chip:''' a slovenly indolent teenaged high school boy; a [[running gag]] has Chip dating new girlfriends!](eight years old at the time the strip started). 
*'''Dot and Ditto:''' rambunctious twins Dot (girl) &amp; Ditto (boy), four-year-olds when the strip began, now grade school-aged; Dot is the better student.
*'''Trixie:''' the Flagstons' freckled, blonde baby girl, who loves "talking" (through thought balloons) to Sunbeam, a ray of sunlight.
*'''Dawg:''' the Flagstons' large, lazy, shaggy sheepdog.
*'''Thirsty Thurston:''' the Flagstons' fat, lazy, and frequently tipsy next-door neighbor; Hi's co-worker and golf buddy.
*'''Irma Thurston:''' Thirsty's thin, weary, and long-suffering wife.
*'''Abercrombie and Fitch:''' the friendly neighborhood garbage collectors. Their names are a pun on the [[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch|clothing manufacturer of the same name]]. Fitch's employee hat has the "s" in "trash" reversed, like the famous "Toys 'R' Us" logo.
*'''Mr. Foofram:''' Owner and president of Foofram Industries, where Hi and Thirsty work. Diminutive and at times short-tempered, but not a tyrant.
*'''Mr. Wavering:'''An elderly neighbor of Hi and Lois; he served as a Corporal in the [[United States Marine Corps]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://comicskingdom.com/hi-and-lois/2018-11-12 Hi and Lois comic 12 November 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[Ron Goulart]] praised Dik Browne's artwork for the strip, stating "Browne made ''Hi and Lois'' one of the most visually interesting strips on the comics page."&lt;ref name="rg" /&gt; In an article for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' reviewing then-current comic strips, [[Ken Tucker]] gave ''Hi and Lois'' a B+ rating, and added that it had the "gentlest humor" of all the Mort Walker comic strips.&lt;ref&gt;Ken Tucker, [http://ew.com/article/1990/10/05/ken-tucker-rates-daily-comic-strips/ "Ken Tucker Rates the Daily Comic Strips"] ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', October 05, 1990 .

'''''How Did This Get Made?''''' (HDTGM) is a [[podcast]] on the [[Earwolf]] network. It is hosted by [[Paul Scheer]], [[June Diane Raphael]] and [[Jason Mantzoukas]]. Each show, which typically has a different guest, features the deconstruction and mockery of outlandish and [[List of films considered the worst|bad films]].

==Format==
The hosts and guest make jokes about the films as well as attempt to unscramble plots. After discussing the film, Scheer reads "second opinions" in the form of five-star reviews posted online by [[Amazon.com]] users. The hosts also often make recommendations on if the film is worth watching. The show is released every two weeks. During the show's off week a ".5" episode (also known as a "minisode") is uploaded featuring Scheer announcing the next week's movie as well as challenges for the fans. Some full episodes are recorded in front of a live audience and include a question and answer session.&lt;ref name="avc213"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/article/paul-scheer-picks-his-favorite-ihow-did-this-get-m-92111 | title=Paul Scheer picks his favorite How Did This Get Made? episodes | work=A.V.

==History==
The podcast was started when the hosts were talking about how bad ''[[Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps]]'' was over drinks and after seeing ''[[Old Dogs (film)|Old Dogs]]'' in the theater.&lt;ref name="avc213" /&gt;&lt;ref name="earwolf-hdtgm" /&gt;&lt;ref name="recom714" /&gt;

==''Unspooled''==
In May 2018, Paul began a new podcast also devoted to movies, called ''[[Unspooled]]'', but this time those deemed good enough for the AFI Top 100. This is often referenced in ''How Did This Get Made'', often by Jason and June, annoyed at how they hadn't been invited to host this new podcast, instead being subjected to the bad films that HDTGM cover.

==Episode guide==
The show is released every two weeks. During the show's off week, a ".5" episode is uploaded featuring Scheer announcing the next week's movie as well as challenges for the fans.&lt;ref name="avc213" /&gt;&lt;ref name="earwolf-hdtgm" /&gt; In addition to the shows and mini-shows, the ''How Did This Get Made?'' stream hosted the first three episodes of [[Casey Wilson]] and [[Danielle Schneider]]'s ''Bitch Sesh'' podcast in December 2015. It has hosted episodes of its own spin-off podcast ''How Did This Get Made? Origin Stories'' in which Blake Harris interviews people involved with the films covered by the main show. In December 2017, an episode was recorded for the Pee Cast Blast event, and released exclusively on Stitcher Premium.

[[Image:Okuni kabuki byobu-zu cropped and enhanced.jpg|thumb|Okuni, in an early depiction]]
{{nihongo|'''Okuni'''|出雲阿国|Izumo no Okuni|born ca. 1572; died ca. 1613}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Jaroslav Průšek]] and Zbigniew Słupski, eds., Dictionary of Oriental Literatures: East Asia (Charles Tuttle, 1978): 70.&lt;/ref&gt; was the originator of [[kabuki]] theater. She was believed to be a ''[[miko]]'' at the [[Izumo Taisha|Grand Shrine of Izumo]]&lt;ref name="Varley" /&gt; who began performing this new style of dancing, singing, and acting in the dry [[Stream bed|riverbed]]s of [[Kyoto]].

==History==

===Early years===
Okuni grew up in the vicinity of the Izumo shrine, where her father, Nakamura Sanemon, worked as a [[blacksmith]], and where several other family members served. Eventually Okuni joined as a ''miko'',&lt;ref name="Okuniencycshort" /&gt; where she was known for her skill in dancing and acting, as well as her beauty. As it was a custom of the time to send priests, ''miko'' and others to solicit contributions for the shrine, she was sent to Kyoto to perform sacred dances and songs.

It was during her performances in Kyoto that she also became known for her performances of ''nembutsu odori'' (or ''[[nembutsu]]'' dance) in honor of the [[Amitabha|Amida Buddha]]. Though this dance traces its origins to Kūya, a tenth-century evangelist of [[Pure Land Buddhism]], by Okuni's time it had become a largely secular [[folk dance]], and her particular adaptation tended to be known for its sultriness and [[Innuendo|sexual innuendo]].&lt;ref name="Varley"&gt;Paul Varley, ''Japanese Culture,'' 4th Ed.. Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press. pp. 186-187. {{ISBN|978-0-8248-2152-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other popular themes for Okuni's acts included humorous skits about lover's trysts at various public establishments and meetings between men and prostitutes. Between these and other dances and acts, she garnered much attention and began to draw large crowds wherever she performed. Eventually she was summoned to return to the shrine, a call she ignored, though she continued to send money back.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}}

===Founding of kabuki===
Around 1603, Okuni began performing on the dry riverbed of the Shijōgawara (Fourth Street Dry Riverbed) of the [[Kamo River]] and at Kitano Shrine.&lt;ref name="Okuniillustencyc"&gt;"Okuni." ''Japan: An Illustrated Encyclopedia.'' Vol 2. Kodansha. {{ISBN|4-06-206490-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Gathering up the female outcasts and misfits of the region, particularly those involved in prostitution,&lt;ref name="Varley" /&gt; Okuni gave them direction, teaching them acting, dancing and singing skills in order to form her troupe. Several theories exist as to the etymology of the word ''kabuki,'' one being that it is derived from those who, oddly dressed and swaggering on the street, had been dubbed ''[[kabukimono]]'' (from ''kabuku'' "to lean in a certain direction", and ''mono'', "people"). Another possible origin is ''katamuki,'' which means "slanted" or "strongly-inclined."&lt;ref name="Varley" /&gt; In either case, others labeled Okuni's troupe's performances [[kabuki]] due to their eccentricity and social daring. The earliest performances of kabuki were dancing and song with no significant plot, often disdained as gaudy and [[cacophony|cacophonous]], but equally lauded as colorful and beautiful.

As mentioned above, Okuni's troupe was exclusively female. Thus, she required her actresses to play both male and female roles. As her troupe gained fame, she was emulated by many others, particularly [[brothel]]s, which offered such shows to amuse wealthy clients, as well as to gain [[prostitution|prostitutes]] who had marketable acting and singing skills.  This new style of exclusively female troupes became known by the alternative names of ''shibai,&lt;ref name="Okuniencycshort"&gt;"Okuni." ''Japan Encyclopedia.'' Ed. Louis Frédéric. Trans. Käthe Roth. Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; onnakabuki,'' (from ''onna,'' the Japanese word for "woman" or "girl") and ''Okuni kabuki.''&lt;ref name="Okuniillustencyc" /&gt;

===Later years===

Eventually, with the aid of Nagoya Sansaburō, who supported Okuni financially as well as artistically,{{Cn|date = January 2016}} kabuki evolved into a more dramatic style. On a more personal level, Sansaburō was also said to be Okuni's lover, though they never married. After his death she continued without him, continuing to merge the drama with the music and dance. Eventually, her fame and that of her kabuki troupe spread throughout Japan.

Okuni retired around 1610, and after that time she disappeared. In 1629, due to public outcry for moral reform, those under the shōgun [[Tokugawa Iemitsu]] forbade women from performing in kabuki. They were quickly replaced by young men as actors/"actresses," though this was soon banned as well due to some of the same issues of prostitution and corruption of morals, restricting the performances to those by older men, which is a standing practice in the official theatres even today.&lt;ref name="Varley" /&gt;

There are several theories of Okuni's year of death: some say in 1613, others in 1640&lt;ref name="Okuniencycshort" /&gt; or 1658.{{Cn|date = January 2016}}

In November 2002 a statue was erected in her honor and to commemorate 400 years of kabuki.&lt;ref name="sign"&gt;Sign (in English) for Izumo no Okuni's statue in Kyoto&lt;/ref&gt; Diagonally across from the [[Minami-za]], the last remaining kabuki theater in Kyoto, it stands at the east end of a bridge (Shijō Ōhashi) crossing the [[Kamo River]] in Kyoto.&lt;ref name="Lonely Planet Kyoto 2012, page 169"&gt;Lonely Planet Kyoto, 2012, page 169&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural impact==
In addition to her founding of kabuki, Okuni contributed to Japanese theatre in general. She is said to have introduced the forerunner of the ''[[hanamichi]]'' (path of flowers), a runway leading from the rear of the theatre and crossing between the audience to the stage.{{Cn|date = January 2016}} This has been incorporated in several Japanese theatre arts beyond that of kabuki.

After his significant [[weight loss]] attributed to eating Subway sandwiches, Fogle was made a spokesperson for the company's [[advertising campaign]]s from 2000 to 2015.

Fogle's tenure with Subway ended after he was investigated for paying for sex with minors and receiving [[child pornography]] in 2015. On August 19, 2015, he agreed to plead guilty in federal court to possessing child pornography and [[Child sex tourism|traveling to pay for sex with minors]].

==Early life==
Fogle was born in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], to Norman and Adrienne Fogle.&lt;ref name=BirthDatePlace /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Cecil|last=Connelly|title=The Subway Guy, Still on a Roll|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/2003/10/12/the-subway-guy-still-on-a-roll/dc3d1c5b-1ddf-4fea-b28d-b1ef503ca27f/|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=Nash Holdings LLC|location=Washington DC|date=October 19, 2003|accessdate=May 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has a younger brother and sister.

In 1995, Fogle graduated from [[North Central High School (Indianapolis)|North Central High School]] in Indianapolis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Sean|last1=Federico-O'Murchu|first2=Tracy|last2=O'Conner|title=Jared Fogle Out of the Picture After School Yanks Alumni Photo|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/jared-fogle-out-picture-after-school-yanks-alumni-photo-n413211|work=[[NBC News]]|date=August 20, 2015|accessdate=May 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from [[Indiana University]] in 2000 and then worked briefly in the revenue management department at [[ATA Airlines|American Trans Air]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Kim|last=Susana|title=Jared Fogle's Life From Jet Setter to Likely Prison Term|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/jared-fogles-life-jet-setter-prison-term/story?id=33182946|work=[[ABC News]]|date=August 19, 2015|accessdate=August 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subway campaign==
Fogle first came to media attention in April 1999, via an article written by a former dorm-mate about Fogle's weight loss and published in the ''[[Indiana Daily Student]]''.&lt;ref name="chip"&gt;{{cite book|first=Chip|last1=Heath|first2=Dan|last2=Heath|title=[[Made to Stick|Made to Stick: Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die]]|date=December 18, 2006|pages=218–221|publisher=[[Random House]]|location=New York City|ISBN=978-1-4000-6428-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Fogle was featured in a ''[[Men's Health]]'' magazine article, "Stupid Diets&amp;nbsp;... that Work!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Duane|last=Swierczynski|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/2333652/stupid-diets-that-work|title=Stupid Diets&amp;nbsp;... That Work!|magazine=[[Men's Health]]|publisher=[[Rodale, Inc.]]|location=Emmaus, Pennsylvania|volume=14|number=9|pages=94–98|date=November 1999|accessdate=March 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the article, Fogle had become obese through lack of exercise and eating junk food.

Fogle changed his eating habits upon the switch to eating at Subway by eating smaller portions that were free of high-calorie condiments such as mayonnaise. While following this diet, he lost over {{convert|200|lb|kg}}. A [[Chicago]]-area Subway [[Franchising|franchisee]] took Fogle's story to Subway's Chicago-based advertising agency.&lt;ref name="chip" /&gt;

[[Image:Subway Bloom.JPG|thumb|The [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]] Subway restaurant that Fogle habitually visited]]
As a test, the company ran a regional television advertising campaign. The first ad aired on January 1, 2000, introducing Fogle and his story with the following disclaimer: "The Subway diet, combined with a lot of walking, worked for Jared. We're not saying this is for everyone. You should check with your doctor before starting any diet program. But it worked for Jared."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Bill|last=Mardis|url=http://somerset-kentucky.com/local/x681549706/-Subway-Guy-Visits-Somerset|title='Subway Guy' Visits Somerset|newspaper=[[Commonwealth Journal]]|publisher=[[Community Newspaper Holdings]]|location=Somerset, Kentucky|date=September 3, 2008|access-date=September 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the introductory test-ads were a success, Fogle subsequently appeared in more television commercials as well as sponsored in-store appearances throughout the United States. He gave talks on the benefits of fitness and healthy eating.&lt;ref name=CBS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/03/02/48hours/main603484.shtml|title=The Subway Diet: Jared Fogle Becomes A Celebrity By Losing Weight|work=[[48 Hours (TV series)|48 Hours]]|network=[[CBS]]|location=New York City|date=September 3, 2004|accessdate=February 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Fogle was the subject of an episode of ''[[South Park]]'' titled "[[Jared Has Aides]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Kevin|last=Clemons|title=dOc DVD Review: South Park: The Complete Sixth Season (2002)|url=http://www.digitallyobsessed.com/displaylegacy.php?ID=7957|website=digitallyObsessed|date=October 10, 2005|access-date=September 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fogle has stated that while the episode had "typical[ly] tasteless humor," the fact that an entire episode was devoted to him was "very flattering." He added, "you know you've made it when shows like ''South Park'' start parodying you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Bob|last=Levey|title=Q&amp;A With Bob Levey|work=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=[[Nash Holdings LLC]]|location=Washington, DC|date=March 18, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2008, a Subway campaign called "Tour de Pants" celebrated Fogle maintaining his weight loss for a decade.  As part of the campaign, Fogle made an announcement that he would retire his pair of {{convert|62|in|cm|adj=on}} pants to a museum at the end of the advertising tour.&lt;ref name=AdAge&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Emily|last=Bryson York|url=http://adage.com/article?article_id=125142|title=Subway Can't Stop Jonesing for Jared|magazine=[[Advertising Age]]|publisher=[[Crain Communications]]|location=Detroit, Michigan|date=February 18, 2008|accessdate=February 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 2008, Fogle's presence in Subway advertisements decreased due to the company's placing a new emphasis on its "[[Subway $5 footlong promotion|$5 Footlong]]" promotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Matthew|last=Boyle|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/pf_article_108119.html|title=The Accidental Hero|website=[[Yahoo! Finance]]|publisher=[[Oath Communications Inc.]]|location=New York City|date=November 10, 2009|access-date=July 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fogle's role in Subway afforded him some other opportunities, such as appearances in [[WWE]] in 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/05042009/mickiejamesvsmaryse |title=Mickie James vs. Divas Champion Maryse |website=[[WWE.com]] |date= |access-date=November 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/05042009/mickiejamesvsmaryse/ |title=WWE: TV Shows &gt; Raw &gt; Archive &gt; 05/04/2009 &gt; Mickie James vs. Divas Champion Maryse |website=[[WWE.com]]|date=May 20, 2009 |access-date=July 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=James|last=Wortman|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/2011-08-15/results|title=Raw results: California scheming|website=[[WWE.com]]|date=August 15, 2011|accessdate=September 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2013, Fogle had filmed more than 300 commercials and continued to make appearances and speeches for the company.  Subway attributed one third to one half of its growth in sales to Fogle, with revenue having tripled from 1998 to 2011.&lt;ref name=murray20130609&gt;{{cite news|first=Rheana|last=Murray|title=Subway commercial spokesman Jared Fogle marks 15 years of turkey subs and keeping the weight off|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/jared-subway-guy-marks-15-years-turkey-subs-article-1.1365511|newspaper=[[New York Daily News]]|publisher=[[Tronc]]|location=New York City|date=June 9, 2013|accessdate=November 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fogle has also made appearances in the ''[[Sharknado]]'' film series, beginning with ''[[Sharknado 2: The Second One]]''. He also had a cameo appearance in ''[[Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No!]]'', though this was cut from the [[Syfy|Syfy Channel]] broadcast version a week before the premiere when his house was searched by the FBI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Tierney|last=Bricker|title=Jared Fogle Dropped from Sharknado 3 Amidst Scandal|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/674564/jared-fogle-s-cameo-in-sharknado-3-cut-in-wake-of-scandal|website=[[E!

Fogle was not arrested or charged with any crimes, [...]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Jared Foundation ==
In 2004, Fogle established the Jared Foundation, a nonprofit organization focused on raising awareness about [[childhood obesity]] through educational programs and tools provided to parents, schools, and community organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Justin Wm.|last=Moyer|title=Jared Fogle: Another VIP claiming to help children but who allegedly harmed them|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/08/20/jared-fogle-another-vip-claiming-to-help-children-who-allegedly-harmed-them/|work=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=Nash Holdings LLC|location=Washington DC|date=August 20, 2015|accessdate=August 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 29, 2015, Russell Taylor, director of the Jared Foundation, was arrested at his Indianapolis home on charges of child exploitation, possession of child pornography, and [[Voyeurism#Criminology|voyeurism]]. Fogle severed all ties with him immediately following the arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Greg|last1=Margason|first2=Kendall|last2=Downing|title=Executive director of Jared Foundation arrested on child pornography, exploitation charges|url=http://fox59.com/2015/04/29/executive-director-of-jared-foundation-arrested-on-child-pornography-charges/|work=[[WXIN]]|location=Indianapolis, Indiana|date=April 29, 2015|accessdate=July 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor attempted suicide on May 6, 2015, at the [[Marion County, Indiana|Marion County]] Jail and was placed on life support.&lt;ref name=usaraid&gt;{{cite news|first1=Madeline|last1=Buckley|first2=Justin|last2=Mack|title=Police raid home of Subway pitchman Jared Fogle|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/07/07/police-investigation-jared-fogle-subway-pitchman/29808241/|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|location=Mclean, Virginia|date=July 7, 2015|accessdate=July 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fox1"&gt;{{cite news|first=Kyee|last=Wierks|title=Former Jared Foundation Director Russell Taylor attempted to commit suicide at the Marion County Jail|url=http://fox59.com/2015/05/06/former-jared-foundation-director-russell-taylor-attempts-suicide-in-marion-county-jail/|work=[[WXIN]]|location=Indianapolis, Indiana|date=May 6, 2015|accessdate=July 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor pleaded guilty to the charges on September 1, 2015, and on December 10, 2015, was sentenced to 27 years in federal prison.

In August 2015, a ''[[USA Today]]'' article&lt;ref name="USA Today Duplicity"&gt;{{cite news|first1=Thomas|last1=Frank|first2=Marisa|last2=Kwiatkowski|first3=Tony|last3=Cook|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/08/22/jared-subway-charges-children/32155115/|title=From obesity to duplicity: Jared's fall to Earth|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|location=Mclean, Virginia|date=August 23, 2015|accessdate=August 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported that the Jared Foundation had not issued any grants nor had it given funds for its stated purpose. The article further noted that, on average, the foundation spent $73,000 a year, with the majority of that figure paying the salary of the foundation's executive director. More than one-quarter of the funds were unaccounted for per the foundation's tax records. The [[Secretary of State of Indiana]] dissolved the organization in February 2012 because it did not pay the required five-dollar annual reporting fees during the two previous years, despite being requested to do so on multiple occasions.&lt;ref name="fox1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Rick|last=Callahan|title=Future of Subway pitchman's foundation unclear after raid|url=http://www.salon.com/2015/07/09/future_of_subway_pitchmans_foundation_unclear_after_raid/|website=[[Salon.com]]|publisher=[[Salon Media Group]]|location=San Francisco, California|date=July 8, 2015|accessdate=May 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniel Borochoff, president of the non-profit charity watchdog group [[CharityWatch]], was quoted by ''USA Today'' as saying, "If Jared was really interested in helping children through his foundation, he could have gotten more money. As with a lot of celebrities, the charity appears to be more about image-enhancement than charitable deeds."&lt;ref name="USA Today Duplicity" /&gt;

== Legal history ==

=== Child pornography investigation and arrest ===
Fogle first came to the attention of law enforcement in 2007, when reporter Rochelle Herman-Walrond told police in [[Sarasota, Florida]], that he had made salacious comments to her about [[middle school]]-aged girls at a school health event she was covering for a local news station. She made recordings of Fogle's remarks and saved text messages between them, and then went to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), where agents asked her to wear a wiretap during her conversations with him. Herman-Walrond befriended Fogle and, for the next four years, surreptitiously recorded her conversations with him as part of an ongoing federal investigation.&lt;ref name="abcnews"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/woman-helped-subway-spokesman-jared-fogle/story?id=33197355 |work=ABC News|title=The Woman Who Said She Helped Take Down Ex-Subway Spokesman Jared Fogle|last=Perez|first=Alex|date=August 20, 2015|access-date=May 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She recorded him making several remarks about having had sex with underage girls and asking her to install a [[webcam]] in her children's rooms so he could watch them.&lt;ref name="abcnews" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/fbi-informant-shares-lurid-details-of-jared-fogle-secret-recordings/|title=FBI informant shares lurid details of Jared Fogle secret recordings|website=[[CBS]]|publisher=[[CBS Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=October 29, 2015|access-date=May 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, however, the FBI could not pursue a case against Fogle using the recordings, because they needed more substantive evidence against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Max|last=Winitz|url=http://www.mysuncoast.com/news/local/why-did-the-jared-fogle-investigation-take-so-long/article_70e4e29e-4840-11e5-9e56-4bc894c2f0d2.html|work=MySuncoast|title=Why did the Jared Fogle investigation take so long?|date=August 21, 2015|access-date=July 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prosecutors alleged that Fogle offered adult prostitutes a [[finder's fee]] to find him younger sex partners.&lt;ref name="cbs" /&gt;

On November 19, 2015, Fogle formally pleaded guilty before federal judge [[Tanya Walton Pratt]]. In a statement, Fogle apologized for his crimes, saying that he wanted a chance to become a "good, honest person" and "redeem [his] life" after being ensnared in a life of "deception, lies and complete self-centeredness." According to Dr. John Bradford, a [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] who testified for Fogle's defense team, Fogle suffered from a compulsive [[eating disorder]] for several years before losing weight, and replaced food with a sense of "[[hypersexuality]]," which included "mild" or "weak" [[pedophilia]].&lt;ref name=NBC /&gt; That diagnosis was not accepted by experts in the psychiatry field and was criticized by Pratt and on [[social media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jeremy|last=Berke|title=Ex-Subway pitchman Jared Fogle's 'diagnosis' doesn't show up in the bible of psychiatric disorders|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/jared-fogle-was-diagnosed-as-a-weak-pedophile-2015-11|magazine=[[Business Insider]]|publisher=[[Axel Springer SE]]|location=New York City|date=August 19, 2015|accessdate=August 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ryckaertmild&gt;{{cite news|first=Vic|last=Ryckaert|title=Jared Fogle's 'mild pedophilia' diagnosis draws backlash|url=http://www.indystar.com/story/news/crime/2015/11/20/jared-fogles-mild-pedophilia-diagnosis-draws-backlash/76107846/|newspaper=[[The Indianapolis Star]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|location=Indianapolis, Indiana|date=November 21, 2015|accessdate=August 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liberty Behavioral Health Corp. psychologist Adam Deming suggested that Bradford had meant to say that Fogle's primary sexual attraction was to early teenagers, but that he had a lesser attraction to younger children.&lt;ref name=Ryckaertmild /&gt;

Pratt sentenced him to 15 years, 8 months in prison, more than three years more than what prosecutors had sought, and three times what Fogle had requested. "The level of perversion and lawlessness exhibited by Mr. Fogle is extreme," Pratt said. Fogle must serve a minimum of 13 years before becoming eligible for time off with good behavior.

===Potential for other criminal charges===
[[New York (state)|State of New York]] authorities could charge Fogle with committing state crimes related to Victims 13 and 14; since it would be the state government rather than the federal government, doing so would not violate [[double jeopardy]]. Potential state crimes would include statutory rape and/or trafficking persons for sexual reasons. New York defense attorney and former assistant district attorney Matthew R. Smalls stated that New York State is unlikely to bring state charges since it would have to make a new investigation and get testimony from victims. Abby Phillip of the ''[[Washington Post]]'' stated "As a legal matter, Fogle may never be charged with rape — or legally labeled with having committed that crime."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Abby|last=Phillip|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/08/25/jared-fogle-admitted-to-sex-crimes-against-minors-why-wasnt-he-charged-with-rape/|title=Jared Fogle admitted to sex crimes against minors.

== Personal life ==
Fogle married Elizabeth Christie, a pediatric nurse, on October 14, 2001; the couple divorced on October 18, 2007.

On August 19, 2015, following Fogle's appearance in federal court on charges of sex with minors and child pornography, his wife released a statement through her attorney announcing that she was seeking a divorce.

'''John Cort''' (ca. 1861&lt;ref&gt;Flom says 1861; IBDB says ca. 1859&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; November 17, 1929&lt;ref&gt;{{IBDB name|name=John Cort|id=22590}}. Accessed December 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;) was an [[United States|American]] [[impresario]]; his '''Cort Circuit''' was one of the first national theater circuits. Along with [[John Considine (Seattle)|John Considine]] and [[Alexander Pantages]], Cort was one of the [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]]-based entrepreneurs who parlayed their success in the years following the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] into an impact on America's national theater scene. While Considine and Pantages focused mainly on [[vaudeville]], Cort focused on legitimate theater. At one time, he owned more legitimate theaters than anyone else in the United States, and he eventually became part of the New York theatrical establishment. As of 2016, his [[Cort Theatre]] remains a fixture of [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].&lt;ref name=Flom&gt;Eric L. Flom, [http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=3296 Cort, John (1861–1929)], HistoryLink, August 9, 2001. Accessed December 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variety theater years==
The [[New York City]]-born Cort started his career as a stage actor of little distinction&lt;ref name=Flom /&gt; and as part of a comedy duo, Cort and Murphy.&lt;ref name=Reeds&gt;[http://www.reedstickets.net/cort-theater-tickets.html Cort Theater Tickets], Reeds Tickets. Accessed December 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He first became a theater manager in [[Cairo, Illinois|Cairo]], [[Illinois]], then headed west to take over the Standard Theater, a Seattle [[box house]] (a cross between a variety theater, a saloon, and—often—a brothel), which he turned into the city's leading such establishment. A pioneer of theater circuits—booking the same act successively into multiple cities to make it worth their while to tour to his remote part of the country—he was so successful that in 1888 he built a new 800-seat Standard Theater at the southeast corner of Occidental and Washington streets. This was Seattle's first theater with electric lighting, more modern than the gas-lit [[Frye's Opera House]], the city's leading legitimate theater at the time.&lt;ref name=Flom /&gt;

The [[Great Seattle Fire]] (June 6, 1889) burned this new Standard and nearly all of Seattle's other places of entertainment. Cort reopened two weeks later in a tent, and by November he had erected a replacement for the Standard.&lt;ref name=Flom /&gt;

==Going legitimate==
Like John Considine, Cort left Seattle during the depression (and anti-vice reaction) that followed the [[Panic of 1893]], but returned after the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] to build the [[Grand Opera House (Seattle)|Grand Opera House]] (opened 1900) on Cherry Street. Geographically he had crossed north of "[[Pioneer Square, Seattle, Washington|the Deadline]]", Yesler Way, out of the vice-ridden "restricted zone". Artistically, he had crossed from [[variety entertainment]] into legitimate theater.&lt;ref name=Flom /&gt;

With Considine, he played a major role in one of the country's rising [[fraternal organization]]s: just before the turn of the century they founded what became the [[Fraternal Order of Eagles]] (F.O.E.). A third founder, [[H. L. Leavitt]], soon bolted to found the [[Loyal Order of Moose]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Murray Morgan]], ''Skid Road'', Ballantine Books (1960), p. 144–146.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Moore Theatre 1900 program cover graphics.jpg|thumb|Graphics for a program from Cort's [[Moore Theatre (Seattle, Washington)|Moore Theatre]], Seattle, circa 1907]]
By 1903, Cort's Northwestern Theatrical Association&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1910/11/03/archives/syndicate-denies-a-truce-but-opinion-is-that-a-sort-of-agreement.html Syndicate Denies a Truce; But Opinion Is That a Sort of Agreement Has Been Made with Cort], ''The New York Times'', November 3, 1910, p. 9. Accessed online December 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; controlled 37 theaters in the American West, allowing him to compete with some success against the Eastern entertainment establishment. He signed an agreement with [[Marcus Klaw]] and [[Abraham Erlanger]], then the country's leading [[booking agent]]s of dramatic talent, and his theaters became part of the [[Klaw and Erlanger Circuit]]. At this point, he was Seattle's leading theatrical impresario. However, Klaw and Erlanger were more focused on box-office potential than artistic merit, and Cort's position in the market had given him an audience with some critical faculties. If people were being offered badly produced plays, they would skip legitimate theater entirely and go see a vaudeville.&lt;ref name=Flom /&gt;

In 1910, Cort helped organize the Independent National Theatre Owner's Association, a group of circuits that tried to break away from the New York-based syndicates. Allied with the independent [[The Shubert Organization|Shubert Organization]], these added up to 1200 theaters nationally.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1910/05/08/archives/1200-theatres-are-independent-now-managers-of-south-west-and.html 1,200 Theatres Are Independent Now], ''The New York Times'', May 8, 1910, p. 13. Accessed online December 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; They eventually forced Klaw and Erlanger to allow theaters to book both Klaw/Erlanger productions and others. Still, while the fight was on, Klaw and Erlanger had backed construction of Seattle's new [[Metropolitan Theatre]] in the prestigious [[Metropolitan Tract (Seattle)|Metropolitan Tract]]. Cort, in turn, headed for New York, where he became a notable producer and manager, as well as the founder of New York's Cort Theatre.&lt;ref name=Flom /&gt;

'''Ken Carson''' (November 14, 1914 &amp;ndash; April 7, 1994) was an American entertainer primarily known for singing [[Western music (North America)|Western music]]. He was an early member of the [[Sons of the Pioneers]], appearing with that group in 22 of [[Roy Rogers]]' films. His voice was featured on their iconic recordings of [[Tumbling Tumbleweeds]] and [[Cool Water (song)|Cool Water]].&lt;ref name="NYTObit"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/12/obituaries/ken-carson-western-singer-79.html |title=Ken Carson, Western Singer, 79 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=1994-04-12 |accessdate=2015-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Carson was born '''Hubert Paul Flatt''' on November 14, 1914 in [[Centrahoma, Oklahoma]]. When he was a few weeks old, his family moved to the oil boom town of [[Drumright, Oklahoma]], where they lived for a time in a tent. Much of his childhood was spent in [[Wichita, Kansas]], living with his maternal grandparents. It was there at age 12 or 13 that he became an accomplished musician, playing guitar and harmonica, and organizing his own band. Shortly thereafter, he and his grandparents joined his mother in the [[Los Angeles]] area, where he attended [[La Puente High School|La Puente]] and [[Garfield High School (Los Angeles County, California)|Garfield]] high schools.&lt;ref name="BobNolan"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bobnolan-sop.net/Biographies/The%20Story%20of%20SOP/Ken%20Carson/Ken%20Carson.htm |title=Ken Carson |work=Bob Nolan - Poet Laureate of the West |accessdate=2015-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LATimes"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-04-12/news/mn-44927_1_ken-carson |title=Ken Carson; Cowboy Singer With the Sons of the Pioneers |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=1994-04-12 |accessdate=2015-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical career==
Carson's adult career began in 1932, when he was only seventeen and still performing as Hubert Flatt. After a short stint on other local radio programs, he spent nine months as a thrice-weekly performer on [[Stuart Hamblen|Stuart Hamblen's]] popular ''Family Album'' radio program, appearing with such early stars as [[Patsy Montana]]. He spent the next several years with popular groups in Los Angeles and Chicago. Ken, then billed as Shorty Carson, and two others formed a group called The Ranch Boys, which played on shows like [[Don McNeill's Breakfast Club]] and [[Garry Moore]]'s ''[[Club Matinee]]'', and which made several recordings for [[Decca Records]].  In 1934 they appeared in the [[Clark Gable]] film ''[[It Happened One Night]]'', and in 1935 they were regulars on the [[Tom Mix]] radio program, also singing the commercial jingle for Shredded Ralston. In 1938, Carson and The Ranch Boys did a promotion for one of their sponsors, riding 3,975 miles on horseback from Los Angeles to Chicago to New York.&lt;ref name="BobNolan"/&gt;

The Ranch Boys split up in 1941, and Carson, now known as Hugh Carson, hosted a late-night radio program on Chicago's [[WGN (AM)|WGN]]. In 1943, the Sons of the Pioneers asked him to replace one of their members who had been drafted into the army. He accepted the invitation and moved to California, working nights at a military aircraft assembly plant. He remained with the Sons of the Pioneers for four years, which were the peak years of their long run of popularity.&lt;ref name="BobNolan"/&gt;

After his departure, he continued as a virtuoso performer. He appeared on the radio in two episodes of [[The Great Gildersleeve]] and voiced the animated wise old owl in Disney's 1948 live-and-animated film [[So Dear to My Heart]]. He made many singing commercials during these years. In the early 1950s, he was a regular performer on [[The Garry Moore Show]], one of the most popular TV shows of the day.&lt;ref name="AATV"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/shows/garry-moore-show-the |title=Garry Moore Show, The |work=Archive of American Television |publisher=The Television Academy Foundation |accessdate=2015-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Always the consummate musician, Ken Carson mastered at least six instruments, and could write and score music of all sorts. He wrote down many of the songs that [[Bob Nolan]] sang, adding harmony and composition to Nolan's "play by ear" vocals.  Carson was a skillful whistler, showing that talent on many recordings of Western songs, notably the Pioneers' ''Blue Shadows on the Trail''. He was an accomplished songwriter who also co-wrote many songs with his friends. The Sons of the Pioneers maintained that he was a better singer than [[Frank Sinatra]]. His voice was "clear as a bell', which made it difficult for him to blend in with the close harmonies often required with his group.&lt;ref name="BobNolan"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Though he didn't speak Spanish, Carson had a perfect Spanish accent, which he is said to have picked up in high school. He was an excellent horseman, having competed in rodeos as a young man. He was an excellent golfer from his teens onward; at age 22 he won the NBC golf tournament. When he became so good as a natural left-hander, he learned to play golf right-handed. Carson sang at the wedding of [[Tricia Nixon Cox]], which he said was the highlight of his career. In 1979, he and his wife retired to [[Delray Beach, Florida]]. He continued to entertain locally, performing a wide repertoire that included songs of [[George Gershwin]], [[Cole Porter]], [[Billy Joel]], and [[Stevie Wonder]], as well as Western  music.&lt;ref name="BobNolan"/&gt;

{{Dynamic list|date=January 2016}}
This is a list of some of the many [[webcomics]] featuring [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]] and [[transgender]] (LGBT) content.

==Background==
[[LGBT]] themes and characters were historically omitted intentionally from the content of [[comic strips]] and [[comic books]], due to either [[censorship]] or the perception that comics were for children. In recent years, the number of LGBT characters in mainstream comics has increased greatly.

There exist a large amount of openly gay and lesbian comic creators that self-publish their work on the internet. These include amateur works, as well as more "mainstream" works, such as ''[[Kyle's Bed &amp; Breakfast]]''.&lt;ref name=AfterElton&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afterelton.com/print/2006/10/gaycomics.html?page=0,2 |website=[[AfterEllen.com and TheBacklot.com|AfterElton.com]] |title=Gay Comics 101 |page=3 |last=Palmer |first=Joe |date=2006-10-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015095150/http://afterelton.com/print/2006/10/gaycomics.html?page=0%2C2 |archive-date=2007-10-15 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Andrew Wheeler from ''[[Comics Alliance]]'', webcomics "provide a platform to so many queer voices that might otherwise go undiscovered."&lt;ref name=ComicsAlliance /&gt;

The '''Ostern''' (Eastern) or '''Red Western''' (also known as "Borscht Western") was a [[genre film]] created in the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Eastern Bloc]] as a version of the [[Western (genre)|Western]] films that originated in the United States. The term refers to two related genres:

# Proper '''Red Westerns''', set in America's "[[Wild West]]" but involving radically different themes and interpretations than US westerns. Examples include ''[[Lemonade Joe]]'' ([[Czechoslovakia]], 1964), or the East-German ''[[The Sons of Great Bear]]'' (1966) or ''[[The Oil, the Baby and the Transylvanians]]'' ([[Romania]], 1981), or ''[[A Man from the Boulevard des Capucines]]'' (USSR, 1987). These were mostly produced in Eastern European countries like East Germany and Czechoslovakia, rather than USSR.
# '''Easterns''' ('''Osterns'''), set usually on the [[steppe]]s or Asian parts of the USSR, especially during the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] or the following [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]], but presented in a style inspired by American western films. Examples of these include ''[[The Elusive Avengers]]'' (1966) and its two sequels, ''[[White Sun of the Desert]]'' (1969), ''[[Dauria (film)|Dauria]]'' (1971), ''[[At Home among Strangers]]'' (1974), ''[[The Burning Miles]]'' (1957), ''[[The Bodyguard (1979 film)|The Bodyguard]]'' (1979), and ''[[The Sixth]]'' (1981). 

While obviously influenced by Westerns, Easterns form a specific and distinct genre. The word "Ostern" is derived from the German word ''Ost'', meaning "East".

Red Westerns of the first type are often compared to [[Spaghetti Western]]s, in that they use local scenery to imitate the American West. In particular, [[Yugoslavia]], [[Mongolia]] and the Southern USSR were used. Some of the [[East Germany|East German]] films were called Sauerkraut Westerns.

==Red Westerns in an international context==

Easterns provide a counterpoint to familiar mythologies and conventions of the original genre, particularly as the makers were on the other side of a [[propaganda]] war without parallel, the [[Cold War]], and this is partially why many have never been shown in the west, at least not until after the Cold War ended. In a war in which many fabrications were made on both sides, there was often a lingering fascination with the cultural developments in enemy countries.

Westerns have proven particularly transferable in the way that they create a mythology out of relatively recent history, a malleable idea that translates well to different cultures. In [[Soviet Union]], the Ostern uses the generic calling cards of the American Western to dramatise the Civil War in [[Central Asia]] in the 1920s and 1930s, in which the [[Red Army]] fought against [[Islam]]ic [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] '[[Basmachi movement|Basmachi]]' rebels. By substituting, 'red' for 'blue' and 'Turk' for [[Mexico|Mexican]] or [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian]], there are the same opportunities for a sweeping drama played out against a backdrop of wide-open spaces. The [[Ural Mountains]] can be equivalent to [[Monument Valley]], the [[Volga River]] for the [[Rio Grande]]. Add the gun slinging ethos, [[horse riding]], working the land, pioneers of a sort (ideological often in this case), the [[bounty hunter]] traversing difficult terrain with [[outlaw]] in tow, [[Rail transport|railroading]] and taming the wild frontier and you have a generic mirror image of the American genre.
One story could have many incarnations: the British [[Lost Patrol (1929 film)|Lost Patrol]] (1929) was set in Mesopotamia but was remade among others as the 1936 Soviet film ''[[The Thirteen]]'', featuring [[Basmachi]] antagonists, and as the 1953 American Western ''[[Last of the Comanches]]''.

Red Westerns which use the actual American west as a setting include, the Romanian ''[[The Oil, the Baby and the Transylvanians]]'' (1981) which dramatises the struggles of Romanian and Hungarian settlers in a [[American Old West|new land]]. The Czech ''[[Lemonade Joe]]'' and the Soviet ''[[A Man from the Boulevard des Capucines]]'' plump for pastiche or [[satire]], making fun of the hard worn conventions of the American films. The German ''[[The Sons of the Great Bear]]'' (1966) turned the traditional American "Cowboy and Indian" conventions on their head, casting the Native Americans as the ''heroes'' and the American Army as the villains - this was well within the established tradition of [[Karl May]]'s highly successful German Western novels, but had some obvious Cold War overtones. The film started a series of "Indian films" by the East German [[DEFA]] studios which were quite successful.

Many of the non-Soviet examples of the genre were international co-productions akin to the Spaghetti Westerns. ''The Sons of the Great Bear'' for example was a co-production between East Germany and Czechoslovakia, starring a Yugoslav, scripted in German, and shot in a number of different Eastern Bloc countries and used a variety of locations including [[Yugoslavia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Mongolia]] and [[Czechoslovakia]]. ''[[The Oil, the Baby and the Transylvanians]]'' was a Romanian film, but featured emigrant Hungarians heavily in the storyline.

==The Ostern and the Revisionist Western==
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Svoj mikhalkov.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Still from ''At Home among Strangers'', showing the actor/director [[Nikita Mikhalkov]] as the bandit Shurik]] --&gt;

There is some divergence between the true Red Western and the true Eastern in their portrayal of certain subject matter.

Proper Red Westerns share some features in common with the general [[Revisionist Western]], notably, a more sympathetic portrayal of working people, Native Americans, and Mexicans. In the true Red Western more focus was put on the lawlessness of the time period, favoring [[realism (arts)|realism]] over [[romanticism]].

With the true "Ostern" ("Eastern"), some of these tendencies may be reversed, particularly in reference to Soviet history and particularly in the context of the Russian Civil War and [[Basmachi]] rebellion. Sympathy for the working class is obviously paramount, but it is also common to romanticise and stereotype non-Russian characters. Thus, Osterns often cast Russian or Jewish actors in prominent "ethnic" parts. [[Spartak Mishulin]], who plays Sayid in ''[[White Sun of the Desert]]'', and [[Konstantin Raikin]], who plays Kayum in ''[[At Home among Strangers]]'', are just some examples of this (compare [[Eli Wallach]] in ''[[The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly]]''). ''At Home among Strangers'', for example, whilst critically acclaimed, has a very one-sided view of its period, which was partly due to political pressure.

What they both share with the revisionist Western, includes a disdain for the business class (cf ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'' and its critique of the rail builders), organised religion and Christianity and the idea of the "[[American Dream]]" and its related ethic.

There is also some common ground with the Zapata Western genre, which is often related to the [[Mexican Revolution]], notably ''[[A Fistful of Dynamite]]'' which is a serious, non-romanticized look at revolution.

In ''[[Dauria (film)|Dauria]]'' (1971), [[Siberian Cossacks]] are acting like American [[cowboy]]s: horseriding, fighting, shooting, and even robbing a bank.

==Influence==
A number of films from the former Eastern bloc, while not falling neatly into the genre, are partly influenced by it. ''[[Siberiade]]'' by [[Andrei Konchalovsky]], the isolated Siberian frontier town, which becomes irrevocably changed thanks to the discovery of oil, bears a resemblance to Western family epics.

==Gibanica westerns==
"Gibanica western" was a short-lived term for the Yugoslav equivalent of the Ostern, more commonly known as [[partisan film]] and, sometimes, the Partisan western. They were made in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, and were about the partisans in [[World War II]]. At that point, Yugoslavia had broken away from the Soviets.

==Goulash westerns==
The [[Goulash western]]s are the Easterns of [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] director [[György Szomjas]]. He directed two films (''[[The Wind Blows Under Your Feet]]'' and ''[[Wrong-Doers]]'') in the 1970s.

'''Pet insurance''' pays, partly or in total, for veterinary treatment of the insured person's ill or injured [[pet]]. Some policies will pay out when the pet dies, or if the pet is lost or stolen.

As veterinary medicine is increasingly employing expensive medical techniques and drugs, and owners have higher expectations for their pets' health care and standard of living than previously, the market for pet insurance has increased.

== History ==
The first pet insurance policy was written in 1890 by Claes Virgin.  Virgin was the founder of  Länsförsäkrings Alliance, at that time he focused on horses and livestock. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/karstenstrauss/2014/07/18/insurance-for-pets-goes-public/|title=Insurance For Pets Goes Public|date=18 July 2014|work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947 the first pet insurance policy was sold in [[United Kingdom|Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://naphia.org/industry/history/|title=History of Pet Health Insurance|publisher=naphia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2009, Britain had the second-highest level of pet insurance in the world (23%),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Taylor |first=Jerome |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/abandoned-are-britains-pets-the-latest-victims-of-the-credit-crunch-831010.html |title=Abandoned! Are Britain's pets the latest victims of the credit crunch? |work=The Independent |date=20 May 2008 |accessdate=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; behind only [[Sweden]]. According to the latest data available from the U.S. Department of Clinical Veterinary Science and the Pet Food Institute, only 0.7% of pets in the United States are covered by Pet Insurance.&lt;ref&gt;Haider, Zeeshan. 2016, Pet Insurance in the US. IBISWorld Industry Report OD4612. IBISWorld Inc. USA.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, the first pet insurance policy was sold in the United States, and issued to television's Lassie by Veterinary Pet Insurance (VPI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.petinsurance.com/we-invented |title=Nationwide Pet Insurance - Formerly Veterinary Pet Insurance (VPI) |publisher=www.petinsurance.com |date= |accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== How policies work ==
Many pet owners believe pet insurance is a variation of [[health insurance|human health insurance]]; however, pet insurance is actually a form of property insurance.  As such, pet insurance reimburses the owner after the pet has received care and the owner submits a claim to the insurance company.  Pet insurance policies primarily cover dogs, cats and horses though more exotic species of animal can obtain coverage.  

UK policies may pay 100% of vets fees, but this is not always the case. It is common for UK pet insurance companies to discount their policies by offering customers the chance to pay an "excess", just as with motor insurance. Excess fees can range from £40 to £100. 

Policies in the United States and Canada either pay off a benefit schedule or pay a percentage of the vet costs (70-100%), after reaching a [[deductible]]&lt;!-- "the remainder being a [[deductible]]" actually, first they subtract the deductible, then they reimburse you a percentage of the rest --&gt;, depending on the company and the policy. The owner usually pays the amount due to the veterinarian and then sends in the claim form and receives reimbursement, which some companies and policies limit according to their own schedules of necessary and usual charges. For very high bills, some veterinarians allow the owner to put off payment until the insurance claim is processed. Some insurers pay veterinarians directly on behalf of customers. Most American and Canadian policies require the pet owner to submit a request for fees incurred.

Previously, most pet insurance plans did not pay for preventative care (such as vaccinations) or elective procedures (such as neutering). Recently, however, some companies in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States are offering routine-care coverage, sometimes called comprehensive coverage. Dental care, prescription drugs and alternative treatments, such as physiotherapy and acupuncture, are also covered by some providers.

There are two categories of insurance policies for pets: non-lifetime and lifetime. The first covers buyers for most conditions suffered by their pet during the course of a policy year but, on renewal in a following year, a condition that has been claimed for will be excluded. If that condition needs further treatment the pet owner will have to pay for that him/herself. The second category covers a pet for ongoing conditions throughout the pet’s lifetime so that, if a condition is claimed for in the first year, it will not be excluded in subsequent years. However, lifetime policies also have limits: some have limits "per condition", others have limits "per condition, per year", and others have limits "per year", all of which have different implications for a pet owner whose pet needs treatment year after year, so it is wise to be clear which type of lifetime policy you are considering.

In addition, companies often limit coverage for [[pre-existing condition]]s in order to eliminate fraudulent consumers, thus giving owners an incentive to insure even very young animals, who are not expected to incur high veterinary costs while they are still healthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brevitz |first=Betsy |date=2009 |title=The Complete Healthy Dog Handbook |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DA8Nb56R3qsC&amp;pg=PT455 |deadurl= |location=Google |publisher=Workman Publishing |isbn=0761154124 |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is usually a short period after a pet insurance policy is bought when the holder will be unable to claim for sickness, often no more than 14 days from inception. This is to cover illnesses contracted before the pet was covered but whose symptoms appeared only after coverage has begun.

Some insurers offer options not directly related to pet health, including covering boarding costs for animals whose owners are hospitalized, or costs (such as rewards or posters) associated with retrieving lost animals. Some policies also include travel cancellation coverage if owners must remain with pets who need urgent treatment or are dying.

Some British policies for dogs also include [[Liability insurance|third-party liability insurance]]. Thus, for example, if a dog causes a car accident that damages a vehicle, the insurer will pay to rectify the damage for which the owner is responsible under the Animals Act 1971.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/22&lt;/ref&gt;

==The difference between companies==
Pet insurance companies are beginning to offer the pet owner more of an ability to customize their coverage by allowing them to choose their own level of [[deductible]] or co-insurance. This allows the pet owner to control their monthly premium and choose the level of coverage that suits them the best.

Some of the differences in insurance coverage are:
* Which pets are covered (typically dogs and cats, though some insurance companies cover horses or other pets.){{cn|date=May 2016}}
* Whether congenital and hereditary conditions (like hip dysplasia, heart defects, eye cataracts or diabetes) are covered;
* How the reimbursement is calculated (based on the actual vet bill, a benefit schedule or usual and customary rates);
* Whether the [[deductible]] is on a per-incident or an annual basis;
* Whether there are any limits or caps applied (per incident, per year, age or over the pet’s lifetime); and
* Whether there is an annual contract that determines anything diagnosed in the previous year of coverage is considered pre-existing the next year.

Prostitutes are known locally as "shermuta" in Arabic, or "mnzerma" and "me'amn" in Tigrinya.

==History==
There had been [[courtesans]] and [[concubines]] in the [[Habesha]] culture for centuries.&lt;ref name="dic"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Connell|first1=Dan|last2=Killion|first2=Tom|title=Historical dictionary of Eritrea|date=2011|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham|isbn=978-0810859524|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Italian Empire|colonisation by Italy]] in the 1880s, prostitution flourished to take care of the sexual needs of the Italian troops and colonialists in the country.&lt;ref name="dic" /&gt; Prostitution was encouraged by the authorities to discourage mixed marriages between Italians and locals.&lt;ref name="limoncelli"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Limoncelli|first1=Stephanie A.|title=The politics of trafficking : the first international movement to combat the sexual exploitation of women|date=2010|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, Calif.|isbn=978-0804762946}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brothels were opened and local women were recruited, by coercion if necessary, to work in them.&lt;ref name="limoncelli" /&gt; These brothels were subsidised by the authorities.&lt;ref name="blood"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Favali|first1=Lyda|last2=Pateman|first2=Roy|title=Blood, land, and sex : legal and political pluralism in Eritrea|date=2003|publisher=Indiana Univ. Press|location=Bloomington [u.a.]|isbn=978-0253342058|edition=[Online-Ausg.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a surge in the 1930s with the build up of troops prior to the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]]. Women from the rural areas migrated to the towns and cities to service the needs of the single Italian men. In the major towns such as [[Assab]], [[Asmara]] and [[Massawa]], prostitution was common in the bars of the "native quarters".&lt;ref name="dic" /&gt; This situation continued through the [[WW2]], including after the Italians were displaced by the British.&lt;ref name="dic" /&gt;

Following the federation with [[Ethiopia]] in 1950, the Ethiopian troops stationed in Eritrea, and the American troops at [[Kagnew Station]] continued the demand for prostitution.&lt;ref name="dic" /&gt;&lt;ref name="blood" /&gt; Prostitution increased during the 1970s with the build-up of the Ethiopian garrisons in the area. In the 1980s there were many prostitutes in Assab, Asmara and Massawa, many of them [[Tigrayans]]. Many worked in bars owned by successful prostitutes.&lt;ref name="dic" /&gt;

During the [[Eritrean War of Independence]], Eritrean girls in occupied territories we required to sign up to join the army at 16. There is evidence many were used as prostitutes by the soldiers.&lt;ref name="bridge"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Green|first1=Cathy|last2=Baden|first2=Sally|title=Gender profile of the state of Eritrea|url=http://www.bridge.ids.ac.uk/sites/bridge.ids.ac.uk/files/reports/re22c.pdf|website=Bridge - Development - Gender|accessdate=7 January 2018|date=February 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; At time of liberation by the [[Eritrean People's Liberation Front]] and independence, there were 4,000 prostitutes in the country,&lt;ref name="blood" /&gt; and 2,000 Ethiopian women were deported in an attempt to curtail prostitution.&lt;ref name="dic" /&gt;&lt;ref name="blood" /&gt; With the spread of [[HIV]] in the 1990s, prostitution was regulated and sex workers were required to have a monthly health check.&lt;ref name="dic" /&gt;&lt;ref name="blood" /&gt;

Prostitution increased in Asmara following arrival of the [[United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea]] peacekeeping force in 2000.&lt;ref name="irish"&gt;{{cite web|title=Irish get their first taste of Eritrea|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/irish-get-their-first-taste-of-eritrea-1.341730|website=The Irish Times|accessdate=7 January 2018|date=12 December 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forms of prostitution==
* [[Street prostitution|Street walkers]]: These prostitutes work mainly at night seeking clients on the street.&lt;ref name="arshad" /&gt;
* Home based prostitutes: These prostitutes receive clients in their homes.&lt;ref name="arshad" /&gt;
* Bar owners: These practice prostitution as an additional source of income in the bars they own.&lt;ref name="arshad" /&gt;
* Bar ladies: They seek clients in the bars they work in. They may or may not be paid by the bar owners.&lt;ref name="arshad" /&gt;
* Small drinking house prostitutes: They work in local drinking houses or tearooms and use prostitution to supplement their income.&lt;ref name="arshad" /&gt;
* [[Brothel]]s: There are a number of brothels, which are usually also drinking houses.&lt;ref name="arshad" /&gt;
* [[Call girl]]s: In recent time, with the emergence of cell phones, call girls now operate in the country.&lt;ref name="arshad" /&gt;

==HIV==
[[HIV]] is a problem in the country, although it has one of the lowest prevalence rates in Sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref name="undp"&gt;{{cite web|title=ERITREA - keeping HIV/AIDS at bay|url=http://www.er.undp.org/content/eritrea/en/home/presscenter/articles/2014/08/ERITREAkeepingHIVAIDSatbay.html|website=UNDP in Eritrea|accessdate=7 January 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s prostitution was regulated and monthly health checks carried out to try and stop the spread of infections.&lt;ref name="dic" /&gt;&lt;ref name="blood" /&gt; 25 clinics and hospitals gave free testing for prostitutes. Social workers used community elders to try and spread the message of safe sex and [[condom]] use to prostitutes and clients.&lt;ref name="walnet." /&gt;

Campaigns have targeted high risk groups, including sex workers.&lt;ref name="undp" /&gt; As a result, the HIV prevalence amongst sex workers has fallen from 22% in 2002,&lt;ref name="undp" /&gt; to 10.4% in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=HIV prevalence amongst sex workers |url=http://www.aidsinfoonline.org/gam/stock/shared/vc/vcshare.html?id=d9c0ff12-f62c-44e7-8e2c-dbe736bbea30 |website=www.aidsinfoonline.org |publisher=UNAIDS |accessdate=22 July 2018 |date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Condom use by sex workers had risen to 95% in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Condom use among sex workers - Percent, 2016 |url=http://www.aidsinfoonline.org/gam/stock/shared/vc/vcshare.html?id=d78c616e-aabc-4c1e-b4e4-66fce6fab140 |website=www.aidsinfoonline.org |publisher=UNAIDS |accessdate=22 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Child prostitution==
[[Child prostitution]] is a problem in the country.  The law criminalises child prostitution. The minimum age for consensual sex is 18. Penalties for conviction of the [[commercial sexual exploitation of children]] include imprisonment. Crimes were seldom reported, and punishment rarely applied.

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in Eritrea}}
Eritrean adults and children are subjected to [[sex trafficking]] abroad, primarily in [[Sudan]], Ethiopia, and [[Libya]]. Some women and girls are subjected to sex trafficking within the country. Some Eritrean women and girls travel to Gulf States for domestic work but are subsequently subjected to sex trafficking. Smaller numbers of Eritrean women and girls are subjected to sex trafficking in [[South Sudan]], Sudan, and [[Israel]]; reportedly, some Eritrean men are vulnerable to sex trafficking in Israel. Some Eritrean military and police officers are complicit in trafficking crimes along the border with Sudan.&lt;ref name="state17"&gt;{{cite web|title=Eritrea 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2017/271184.htm|website=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=7 January 2018}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Rainbow Brite''''', also known in Japan as {{nihongo|'''''Magical Girl Rainbow Brite'''''|魔法少女レインボーブライト|Mahō Shōjo Reinbō Buraito}}, is a media franchise by [[Hallmark Cards]], introduced in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ibtimes.com/rainbow-brite-2014-reboot-5-things-know-about-original-nov-6-premiere-video-1705633|title='Rainbow Brite' 2014 Reboot: 5 Things To Know About The Original Before The Nov. 6 Premiere [VIDEO]|date=15 October 2014|publisher=|accessdate=24 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/rainbow-brite-returns-comic-series/|title='80s Sensation Rainbow Brite Returns In an All-New Comic Series|date=17 July 2018|publisher=|accessdate=24 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The animated television series of the [[Rainbow Brite (1984 TV series)|same name]] first aired in 1984, the same year Hallmark licensed Rainbow Brite to [[Mattel]] for a range of dolls and other merchandise. A theatrical feature-length film, ''[[Rainbow Brite and the Star Stealer]]'', was released by Warner Bros. in 1985. The franchise was rebooted in 1996, 2003, 2009, and then again in 2014 through Hallmark's online on-demand streaming video service, [[Hallmark Movies Now|Feeln]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/10/15/showbiz/tv/rainbow-brite-returns-feeln/index.html|title=The return of 'Rainbow Brite'|first=Breeanna Hare,|last=CNN|publisher=|accessdate=26 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A line of new merchandise sold only by Hallmark online and in its shops debuted in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/kenyth-mogan/the-colorful-history-of-r_b_10345612.html|title=The Colorful History Of Rainbow Brite™|first=Kenyth|last=Mogan|date=26 June 2016|publisher=|accessdate=24 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newsarama.com/40852-rainbow-brite-lights-up-comic-books-once-again.html|title=RAINBOW BRITE Lights Up Comic Books Once Again|publisher=|accessdate=24 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Creation and development of Rainbow Brite for [[Hallmark Cards]] is credited to both Hallmark's Vice President of
Creative/Licensing, Garry Glissmeyer, a team of artists headed by Cheryl Cozad, and writers under the direction of Hallmark's Editorial Director, Dan Drake. Hallmark's Vice President of Sales and Marketing, Lanny Julian, assembled a team of legal, marketing, and public relations associates for this new licensing division.

Glissmeyer and Julian were tasked with breaking Hallmark into the licensing business with the creation of characters targeted at children. Glissmeyer's group's concept of a young girl with powers over nature evolved into her being responsible for all of the colors of the universe. Once the concept was agreed to, Cozad's and Drake's teams developed the backstory and characters needed to support it. Jim McDowell, a key player from Hallmark's marketing unit, conceptualized a strategy to get the new brand in the public eye.

Julian chose [[Mattel]] as the manufacturer and distributor for the line of dolls and toys to follow. Julian chose [[DIC Entertainment]] of France as the studio to provide the brand with episodic animation for television. Glissmeyer placed Cozad in charge of the in-house creative group, to work with Mattel and other licensees. Glissmeyer and Drake continued with creative input, working with DIC on the animation development.

While Hallmark artist, G.G. Santiago, developed the final "look" of Rainbow Brite, Cozad's team finalized style guide models for Rainbow Brite and her friends. Hallmark writer, Mary Loberg, and freelance television writer, Woody Kling, worked with DIC in creating TV storylines for the series, which provided DIC the framework to produce the animation episodes. Kling only worked on three episodes and did not create the Rainbow Brite character or brand as some people believe.

Rainbow Brite made her animated debut in the syndicated prime-time television special, "Peril in the Pits," which was first aired on June 27, 1984. Later, a pair of two-part specials were produced: "The Mighty Monstromurk Menace" and "The Beginning of Rainbowland." A theatrical feature-length film, ''[[Rainbow Brite and the Star Stealer]]'', was released by [[Warner Bros.]] in 1985. These were followed up with eight more episodes for a total of thirteen, which is one season in American television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2014/digital/news/rainbow-brite-revival-series-remake-feeln-1201330885/|title=‘Rainbow Brite’ Revival Series Set with Emily Osment and Molly Ringwald|first=Laura|last=Prudom|date=15 October 2014|publisher=|accessdate=26 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episodes became part of DIC's weekly syndicated ''[[Kideo TV]]'' block of programming and were rerun in 1987. All were published on [[VHS]] [[videotape]]s in the United States and other countries, along with two live-action programs. One of these was a program intended for use at kids' birthday parties; the other was made on location at the world-famous [[San Diego Zoo]].

Hallmark also created a Rainbow Brite Style Book for companies that wanted to make Rainbow Brite items under license. It gave detailed drawings of all the players and Hallmark's policies on a number of subjects such as the use of its Rainbow Brite logos on the packaging for each product, copyright notices on all products where feasible, fees for creating artwork and the approvals needed before production of new Rainbow Brite merchandise could start.

==Premise==
In Gen 1 continuity, and most of the [[Media franchise|franchise]]'s backstory, a young girl named Wisp is brought to a gray, desolate land with the mission to bring color to this [[Fictional universe|fictional world]] by locating the Sphere of Light. Along the way, she befriends a furry creature (called a sprite) named Twink and a magnificent horse named Starlite and finds a mysterious baby who turns out to be the key to her mission. With the help of her new friends, Wisp locates the legendary Color Belt and rescues the seven Color Kids, who had been trapped by the King of Shadows. Using the Color Belt, Wisp and the Sphere of Light defeat the King of Shadows, liberate the sprites, and bring color and beauty to the land, henceforth called Rainbow Land. Wisp is renamed Rainbow Brite in honor of her new role as leader of the Color Kids, who are together in charge of all the colors in the universe.

The Color Kids spread color across the universe from the Color Console inside the Color Castle. Each Color Kid is in charge of their respective color, has a personal sprite and manages a number of like-colored sprites that mine Color Crystals from the nearby Color Caves. These crystals are processed into Star Sprinkles which are the essential components to brightening and coloring any object or place. Rainbow Brite and the Color Kids' mission is often complicated by the likes of Murky Dismal, his sidekick Lurky, and other [[villain]]s. Brian, a boy from [[Earth]], sometimes assisted Rainbow Brite in her adventures.

In the movie, ''[[Rainbow Brite and the Star Stealer]]'', the setting expands to include the diamond planet, Spectra. All the light in the universe must pass through Spectra before coming to Earth. However, Earth soon falls into a wintry darkness when the diamond-obsessed Dark Princess decides to steal Spectra for her own. Rainbow Brite and her horse, Starlite, must team with Spectra's boy warrior, Krys, and his robotic horse, On-X, to defeat the powers of darkness and save Spectra, Earth, and the universe.

Gen 2 continuity took a radical departure from any other generation's story, focusing as much on [[Multiculturalism|ethnic diversity]] as the colors of the rainbow. Rainbow Brite had an entirely new and smaller group of friends called the Color Crew. Despite distribution and marketing in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Australia, the toy line never reached the success of its predecessor and ended after little more than a year.

Gen 3 was basically a relaunch of Gen 1 in 2003, with the same story, but a smaller range of characters produced. The dolls from Toy Play were similar to but not exact copies of the Gen 1 versions. There was also a sizable amount of Rainbow Brite merchandise from various other manufacturers just as in Gen 1.

Gen 4A celebrated the 25th Anniversary of Rainbow Brite in 2009 with continuity returning the setting again to Rainbow Land, which looked nothing like the original version. This time, Rainbow Brite and her friends' mission was to bring hope and happiness to the far corners of the universe, making hearts lighter and worlds a little more colorful along the way. The story focuses on Rainbow Brite, Tickled Pink, and Moonglow, each representing one of Rainbow Land's Sky Powers, which determine the cycles of the days and seasons. Gen 4 continuity makes Rainbow Brite a girl originally from Earth (Return to Rainbow Land). Rainbow Brite's absence from the world is explained in a story that sees Rainbow return to her home on Earth for a brief visit with her family after many adventures spreading color throughout Rainbow Land and the universe. But when the Dark Princess erases Rainbow Land from Rainbow Brite's memory while on Earth, she never returns to her duties in Rainbow Land. Rainbow Brite eventually returns to Rainbow Land with the help of Starlite and Puppy Brite. Playmates' line of toys was very controversial among fans and consumers largely because of the change in Rainbow Brite's age from about 6 or 7 years old, to 10 or 11. These dolls had a more mature fashion doll-like design, which was totally unlike all of the previous dolls in the series. The three girl dolls were wearing [[training bra]]s and [[panties]] under their clothes. The line suffered a delay, which caused the toys to not be available until after the holiday season that year. It saw scarce distribution as retailers were not impressed with it and was canceled after just seven months and before the first release was completed.

[[Hallmark Movies Now|Feeln]]'s (part of Hallmark) Gen 4B animated reboot retained most Gen 1 story elements and recognizable but not identical character designs. It introduced a few new story elements, one being the Sentinels of Light, which included Rainbow Brite as a guardian of light and color and Krys as the protector of light unseen. Stormy also played a more prominent role. After a falling out with her pal, Rainbow Brite, Stormy joined the forces of darkness and became a formidable [[frenemy]]. As the Dark Princess's manipulations became more transparent, Stormy started questioning where her true loyalties lay and returned to Rainbow Land as Rainbow Brite's friend. Gen 4B consisted solely of web content from Hallmark and only resulted in a minuscule amount of give-away merchandise. None of the items were available for purchase.

Gen 5 began in 2015 with dolls and toys very similar to those of Gens 1 and 3. Hallmark worked on the design, storylines, distribution and sales which have, so far, been limited to Hallmark shops in the United States and Canada, and the Hallmark website. The line began with a limited production of Hallmark's Itty Bittys plush miniatures before expanding to larger Twink &amp; Starlite plushes, a 16" Rainbow Brite doll, a series of hard cover story books, women's clothing, and an expansion of the Itty Bittys line. More Rainbow Brite merchandise was introduced in 2016 and even more is expected in 2017. In the fall of 2016, Hallmark finally gave Rainbow Brite fans what they had been waiting for since the 1980s; a Stormy doll with her own horse. New books were released at the same time but the Gen 5 line is still small when compared to Gen 1.

==Merchandise==

===First Generation: Mattel===
For the first Rainbow Brite generation (1984–1987), [[Mattel]] produced the dolls and many of the toys along with a large line of school supplies only sold in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2623061027|title=Transformers, Rainbow Brite top Christmas toys of 1984|date=31 December 1969|publisher=|accessdate=24 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Rainbow Brite licensed merchandise was produced by various companies. This included many story and activity books by [[Western Publishing]] ([[Little Golden Books]]), a number of puzzles, a line of costume jewelry, banks and suitcases by Kat's Meow, clothes, toys, games, doll and child furniture, radios, child cosmetics, linen, towels, personal care items, lamps, figurines, VHS videocassettes, audio cassettes, records, bicycles, bedding, curtains and much more sold in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. The rest of Europe saw a smaller variety of merchandise, though this varied from country to country.

For example, the entire Mattel line was not sold in all countries. Italy and Spain did not receive the second release of dolls (Lala Orange, Buddy Blue &amp; Shy Violet), the Dress Up line or Kitty Brite. Many Mattel items were made in Europe by local suppliers for the local markets. A French toymaker produced Rainbow Brite, Murky Dismal and Lurky in Mattel packaging in France during 1984 and 1985. An Italian toy company made the European versions of Starlite, the Color Cottage, and the Color Buggy for all of Europe during 1984 and 1985. In both cases, production was switched to Mattel's contract manufacturers in Asia for 1986 and 1987. The entire line of Rainbow Brite for Spain (six dolls, five sprites, Starlite, Lurky and the Color Cottage) was produced in Spain from 1984 until the line ended there in 1986 or 1987. Similarly, this occurred in Mexico with the entire doll line minus the Dress Up dolls. This was the result of high import duties in a number of countries at the time, caused by [[Protectionism|protectionist]] policies.

Books, comic books, sticker albums and audio tapes were the best selling licensed items outside the United Kingdom, but other items did exist in different countries. In Germany alone there were no less than thirty-one story cassettes and forty-six comic books. Germany also had an exclusive version of the Dress Up Rainbow Brite doll that included a story cassette. This cassette was not sold separately but was produced by Europa, producer of the other 30 story cassettes. It is unknown if the cassettes were sent to the Asian factory that made the dolls or were put into the dolls' boxes in Germany. A line of five 3D erasers in the form of various Rainbow Brite characters was sold in Europe with Mattel branding, while the same line was also sold in Australia under the name of Harveston Super Action figures with the addition of an additional character (Lurky) not sold in Europe. A number of Gen 1B (the second release of the first generation) dolls made for the American and Mexican markets ended up being sold in Germany because of strong demand there. These dolls had their English or Spanish names covered by a sticker with the German name or sometimes nothing at all. Two Rainbow Brite dolls plus Twink and Starlite were also produced in Brazil by Estrella. These were not exported anywhere and came in their own unique white packaging with all writing less the Rainbow Brite name in the Brazilian version of Portuguese. Because of Rainbow Brite's extreme popularity soon after she was launched, a number of other companies not related to Mattel produced many unlicensed lookalike (fake or bootleg) items that were sold in North America and Europe.

The Mattel line of toys and dolls was quite large. There were three large dolls, five medium dolls (Emotions) 12 small dolls, nine animals, 50 sprites (including those that came with the small dolls), four large boxed toys, ten boxed wallhangings and doll carriers, and 27 small carded toys for a total of 111 different items and this does not include generational (some dolls were sold in two different boxes over time in some markets) and international packaging variations. These toys were expensive for their time and Mattel responded by producing a lower priced line of toys sold loose with tags called the 'Emotions' line. The Emotions line included five dolls including a 15" Buddy Blue doll, that was sold only in Canada. The extra sprite in the line happened to be Champ. Also included were five Sprites, Starlite the horse and Lurky. Oddly enough, the Emotions dolls were larger than the small dolls in the regular line, but the Emotions horse was smaller than the normal version. As such the Emotions dolls were neither in scale with the Emotions horse or the regular Mattel version. And of course the Emotions dolls were too big to sit on the Emotions horse or the normal one. Not all toys were sold in all markets, and the Emotions line was never sold outside the United States and Canada.

Mattel's Dress Up line of dolls and horses is the most sought after part of the entire Mattel line, particularly Moonglow who was only sold in Germany. Although Stormy's doll was shown in the Mattel catalog and on the backs of the Dress Up doll boxes, she was never produced for retail even though the character did appear in some cartoon episodes and several German comic books. There was also a line of cataloged clothing for the Dress Up dolls, but like Stormy, it was never produced. The two horses, Starlight and Sunriser, were made from hard plastic rather than being stuffed. They were in fact from Mattel's line of 'Barbie' merchandise. The Dress Up line was only made for about one year. That makes the two horses and Moonglow very difficult to find today, especially MIB. The Tickled Pink and Rainbow Brite Dress Up dolls are somewhat difficult to find these days compared to the rest of the Gen 1 line.

Televised commercials for Mattel's Rainbow Brite dolls frequently featured the song, "[[Over the Rainbow]]," from [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]], often with altered lyrics or arrangements. Child actors [[Tracey Gold]], [[Kellie Martin]] and [[Heather O'Rourke]], famous for their roles in 1980s television and film, also appeared.

===Second Generation: Up, Up and Away===
The second Rainbow Brite generation (1996–1997) greatly differed from any generation before or since. It used the Rainbow Brite name but not the same characters or backstory. The master license was held by Up, Up and Away, a company which is no longer in business.

Rainbow Brite no longer had anything do with making colors and was now in charge of diversity. Although this version did have rainbow-colored hair, the characters resembled real-world children more than their previous animated and doll counterparts. In the second generation's story, Rainbow Brite had four friends, called the Color Crew, which included Amber (Latina), Cerise (Asian), Ebony (African) and Indigo (Central Asian, the only character name borrowed from the original Color Kids).

Rainbow Brite was produced as large and small dolls while the Color Crew was represented only in the small doll range. The large Rainbow Brite dolls came with three pots of Color-Glo Paint and a brush, while the small dolls included a single pot of Color-Glo Paint and a brush. The large doll was released in two different boxes, the first lacking a window so buyers could not see the doll inside. As the doll was sold with three different wardrobes, buying one was a gamble regarding which look she would have (unless one read the small code box on the bottom of the package indicating the doll's shoe color). The large doll later came in a window box with a simplified single wardrobe. The small dolls came boxed at first and then blister carded on two different types of cards. They are noted for being the only Rainbow Brite dolls ever produced with Dutch text on the packaging.

The Canadian importer was Irvine, a company which is currently still in business, and their product packaging was printed in both French and English texts. [[Ideal Toy Company]] was the importer for most of [[Western Europe]], though Euro Play imported the line for Germany. The large doll was also distributed in Italy by GiG with only Italian text on the box. There were no other toys or accessories for the second generation dolls other than additional pots of Color-Glo Paint, which were sold in the United States, Canada, Europe and Australia. There was also a version of at least the large doll in a box with Spanish-only text. Another 15" Rainbow Brite doll with a Color Glo Bear and paint set was prototyped, as was a black version, which was produced in very small numbers. But only the black version was ever produced and then in very limited numbers. There was a Gen 2B which had simplified packaging and outfits as an effort to keep the line going by cutting costs. The second generation had nowhere near the success the first generation had at retail and was discontinued after less than two years on the market. 
===Third Generation: Toy Play===
The third Rainbow Brite generation (2003–2005) was also the 20th Anniversary Release. The master toy licensee was Toy Play, a defunct subsidiary of The Betesh Group. The parent company is still in business. [[Nick Jr. (block)|Nick Jr.]] was the [[television network]] that advertised the line. [[Hot Topic]] was the lead merchandiser with a unique Rainbow Brite doll not manufactured by Toy Play and many items of women's clothing, accessories and stationary.

Without being an exact copy of the originals, this generation returned to the look and feel of the Mattel line even if the product line was much narrower than the first generation. Toy Play followed the first generation's character roll out, producing Rainbow Brite, Red Butler, Canary Yellow and Patty O'Green characters but no more Color Kids followed. Starlite, Puppy Brite and the Sprites were also represented in various merchandise.

Characters were produced in different sizes, from three to twenty-eight inches tall across the line which went from PVC plastic figurines to plush dolls. Toy Play produced both retro-style plush dolls with wiring in their limbs to make them poseable along with plastic dolls wearing soft clothing and having articulated arms and legs. Some dolls were sold with a [[DVD region code#Region codes and countries|Region 1 DVD]] in English featuring a single episode of the original cartoon. Some Toy Play products were sold in Canada with English-French packaging. Toy Play's 18 inch talking Rainbow Brite doll notoriously omitted the color green when 'speaking' all of the colors of the rainbow. Toy Play indicated that the missing color would be added for future production runs, but this never happened because the line died out before a corrected version appeared.

Toy Play was the first (and so far only) merchandiser to produce a Color Castle playset, the Light Up Musical Castle, which included small articulated figurines of Rainbow Brite, Red Butler, Twink and Puppy Brite. The playset's box showed pictures of forthcoming product (a Rainbow Brite and Friends Sprites' village playset, an in-scale Starlite with brushable mane, as well as figurine 2-packs to include Rainbow Brite and Twink, Red Butler and Romeo, Patty O'Green and Lucky, Canary Yellow and Spark, and Murky Dismal and Lurky) though these were never produced. There was also a wide range of other merchandise, mostly clothing, that was available during Gen 3. For some unknown reason, the orange-colored tags and logos that started with Gen 3 have been revived for Gen 5.  

===Fourth Generation: Playmates Toys===
The fourth Rainbow Brite generation (2009–2010) was the 25th anniversary release and was accompanied by a series of web-episodes produced by [[Animax Entertainment]] that were available to stream on www.RainbowBrite.com., which no longer exists. The master toy license belonged to [[Playmates Toys]] and their line of Rainbow Brite toys was expected to be in stores in the fall of 2009. Production delays saw the line actually debut in stores on December 24 of that year, which of course missed the 2009 [[Christmas and holiday season#Shopping|holiday shopping season]].

This interpretation of Rainbow Brite was controversial among fans of the original Rainbow Brite as the characters, though still youthful in appearance, appeared significantly older and were styled more like traditional 11" [[fashion doll]]s. The line's initial product release only included three plastic fashion dolls (Rainbow Brite, Tickled Pink, and Moonglow) and three plastic horses with rooted manes (Starlite, Sunriser, and Shimmer). A larger 15" Rainbow Brite doll was also produced. The line initially omitted the Color Kids altogether in favor of a more sky-power oriented storyline. The packaging art hinted at a possible Stormy doll to come, though yet again she never arrived.

The Playmates' line never caught on with its target audience. After missing its holiday season window and facing controversy within the fandom, the Playmates' Rainbow Brite line withered on the vine and died. Most retailers refused to carry the line and those that did saw stock run out by July 2010. If any reorders were placed, they were not in quantities that justified continued production. The line was only on the market for about seven months and was not available in all of the [[Contiguous United States]].

In the Fall of 2010 three Sprite dolls appeared at retail in Mexico. These included Twinkle (a renamed Twink) for Rainbow Brite, Nite Sprite for Moonglow and Twilite for Tickled Pink. These were already in production when US retailers dropped the line. The fourth generation saw a number of licensed products similar to the third generation, some in the original Gen 1 style and some in the new Gen 4 style. This included mostly clothing and stationary, plus a small bicycle. The final products during the fourth generation came from Madame Alexander, and included a traditional Madame Alexander-style Gen 1 Rainbow Brite doll with Twink, as well as Gen 4-style plush dolls of Rainbow Brite and Tickled Pink.  
===Feeln===
A three-part animated [[miniseries]] was launched on November 6, 2014 by Video On Demand site [[Hallmark Movies Now|Feeln]]. The reboot showcased updated character designs for the cast, and starred [[Emily Osment]] as the voice of Rainbow Brite and [[Molly Ringwald]] as the voice of Dark Princess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/emily-osment-molly-ringwald-voice-740667|title=Emily Osment, Molly Ringwald Voice New 'Rainbow Brite' Series|publisher=|accessdate=24 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second episode was shown on November 13, 2014 and the series concluded on November 20, 2014. Feeln's miniseries was well received by many in the Rainbow Brite fandom but it did not produce any merchandise. As such, it has not been given a generation number but is sometimes called Gen 4A because it arrived before the Gen 4 dolls and horses arrived in the shops near the end of the following month and is sometimes called Gen 4B. Although a Starlite Pillow Pal was produced by Pillow Pets during this time, it was actually not part of the Playmates line of toys.

===Fifth Generation: Hallmark Toys===
Hallmark introduced the fifth generation of Rainbow Brite toys, along with clothing and other merchandise in July 2015. A limited edition line of Rainbow Brite Itty Bittys featuring Rainbow Brite, Twink, Champ, O.J., Lucky and I.Q. arrived first, each produced in limited quantities of 500 units. These sold out in five days on hallmark.com, and the demand led to Hallmark reissuing the Itty Bittys with slightly revised designs in much greater numbers along with the first Rainbow Brite Itty Bittys boxed set featuring Red Butler, Romeo, Indigo and Hammy. These items were followed by an 8" Twink plush and 11" Starlite plush in September 2015, as well as a 16" Rainbow Brite doll that November.

In 2016 Hallmark released another Itty Bitty boxed set featuring Patty O'Green, Buddy Blue, Lucky &amp; Champ. A 24" Rainbow Brite Jumbo Itty Bitty arrived in December. A limited edition Shy Violet Itty Bitty was released as a Hallmark online exclusive that Summer. In Fall of 2016 many new Rainbow Brite items were available at Hallmark stores and online, including several new story and activity books, a new range of greeting cards, and a 1,000 piece Rainbow Land puzzle. A Starlite Itty Bitty was released in November, as well as 11" Sunriser and Skydancer plushes, and for the first time ever a 16" Stormy doll. Packaging for the single items consists only of attached tags with the product name, Hallmark logo, copyright notice and barcode, while the boxed sets feature Rainbow Land displayable backgrounds. These toys are currently sold only in the United States and Canada. Additionally, Hallmark Keepsake Rainbow Brite holiday ornaments were sold in 2015 (a reissue of Hallmark's 2013 ornament) and 2016.


==Non-English names==
Rainbow Brite had a number of names in other languages even if the Rainbow Brite name was on all of the packaging for all markets. In Canadian French she was called Azurine, from the azure color of her dress. In European French she was called Blondine au Pays de l'Arc-en-Ciel (The Blonde Girl from the Land of the Rainbow) or just Blondine for short. In German speaking countries and regions, she was called Regina Regenbogen (Regina Rainbow). In Italy she was called Iridella which came from her iridescent dress. In both Spanish and Portuguese speaking markets she was called Arco Iris (also Rainbow). In Spain, she was also called Rubita (a diminutive for Blonde). The other characters in the Rainbow Brite universe also had language-specific names. The French names for everyone in Rainbow Land in Canadian French were different than the names used in European French. In Dutch-speaking areas, the English names were used.

'''Solomon Islands dance''' is part of the culture of the [[Solomon Islands]]. Dances are performed at ceremonies and special occasions, as well as on a regular basis in some hotels and restaurants, which feature local musicians performing traditional songs and dance. The National Museum of Solomon Islands at [[Point Cruz]] also organises live dances and other cultural displays of its provinces.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Dancing is often accompanied by bamboo bands, and [[panpipes]] are a popular accompaniment.&lt;ref name="Crocombe2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Crocombe|first=R.

In 1974, Polynesian Dances of Bellona (Mungiki), which included ''suahongi'' form and which had been forbidden to be performed during the 1940s by the [[Christian missionaries]], was revived and recorded in [[Honiara]]. ''Suahongi'', performed by men, is enacted at the conclusion of the  ''manga'e'' ceremony, a ritual of sharing the surplus harvest of fish and garden crops. The dance is performed to songs which are set in the form of "feature call and response, speech–song" and highly rhythmic; music notes included the short history of the island of Bellona.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.folkways.si.edu/polynesian-dances-of-bellona-mungiki-solomon-islands/world/music/album/Smithsonian|title=Polynesian Dances of Bellona (Mungiki), Solomon Islands|publisher= Smithsonianfolkways.si.edu|accessdate=21 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Rennel]] (''Munggava'') and [[Bellona Island|Bellona]] (''Mungiki''), two islands administered by Solomon Islands, dance and music were banned by the missionaries, but revived during World War II. ''Suahongi'' (meaning a "circle", or to "hover about"), is an important dance form in the Bellonese tradition. It is a ritual dance which lasts for about half an hour, has three parts, and is performed by men. The first part, called the ''buatanga'', is performed in circles while the other two parts are done in lines.&lt;ref name=" McLean 2003"/&gt;

Jane Mink Rossen revived this dance-music form and wrote about it in her book "Songs of Bellona Island (1987)". An LP of the same name, refers to it as "coordinate polyphony" of two songs rendered simultaneously. Other dances described by Rossen include ''Mako hakapaungo'' (a line dance performed by men with "fighting clubs and staffs"); ''Hua patti'', a mixed type of dance;  ''Mako hakasaunoni'', which is performed by men folk accompanied by clapping of hands; ''mako nagangi'', another dance form originating from Tikopia is known as ngongole.&lt;ref name=" McLean 2003"&gt;{{cite book|last= McLean |first= Mervyn |title= Weavers of Song: Polynesian Music and Dance |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GhEpKUITQUIC&amp;pg=PA256&amp;lpg=PA256&amp;dq=Solomon+Islands+dance&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uq4l76-76n&amp;sig=yO76OwFexmr5dekYl0t-bND080Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=U6BcUNGGDsWkiQL3zIDQDA&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Solomon%20Islands%20dance&amp;f=false|accessdate=21 September 2012|date=2003|publisher= Auckland University Press|isbn=9781869402129|pages=239–241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Tikopia]], the most formal festival dances occur during the [[monsoon]] season. Dance variations included ''Te mako e ta'' (the dance is beaten), ''mako po'' (clapped dances), ''mako rima'' (arm/hand dances), ''mako rakau'' (dances with wooden implements), and ''mako lasi'' (big dances). It has been said to Firth that, "The one work of Tikopia is the dance". He describes the 'dancing impulse' as being so strong in Tikopia that it is "almost obsessional behaviour".&lt;ref name="Firth2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Firth|first=Raymond| authorlink =Raymond Firth|title=Tikopia Songs: Poetic and Musical Art of a Polynesian People of the Solomon Islands|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HfJYZdggXZQC&amp;pg=PA66|accessdate=21 September 2012|date=14 December 2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-03205-6|pages=66, 67–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The funeral dance of the Solomon Islands was described by Henry Brougham Guppy in 1887: 
:"With their faces white with lime they formed a large circle, in the centre of which were four posts placed erect in the ground, each about ten feet high, charred on one side and rudely carved in imitation of the human head, two of them painted red and two white. Enclosed in the ring and grouped around the posts were six women bearing in their hands the personal belongings of the deceased, such as her basket and cushion. To the slow and measured time of the beats of a wooden drum, a hollowed log struck by a man outside the circle, the dancers of the ring adapted their move merits, which consisted merely in raising the feet in turns and gently stamping on the ground. The central group of women danced around the posts, partly skipping, partly hopping, each woman holding up before her the article she bore, and regulating her steps to the beats of the drum. Now and then the man at the drum quickened his time, and the movements of the women of the ring became more spirited; whilst the central group of dancers skipped more actively around, the foremost woman sprinkled at each bound handfuls of lime over the dancers of the ring."&lt;ref name="Guppy1887"&gt;{{cite book|last=Guppy|first=Henry Brougham|title=The Solomon Islands and their natives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FcERAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA49|accessdate=21 September 2012|edition=Public domain|year=1887|publisher=S. Sonnenschein, Lowrey &amp; co.|pages=49–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The present rage in dancing style among the youth of the Islands is the "freestyle dancing" which has become integral to the night life and entertainment scene. These dance forms, with no resemblance to the traditional dance forms of Solomon Island, are copied from the films '[[You Got Served]]', '[[Step Up (film)|Step Up 1]] and [[Step Up 2: The Streets|2]]' and '[[Stomp the Yard]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.solomontimes.com/news.aspx?nwID=2382|title=Freestyle Dancing: The 'IN' thing |accessdate=21 September 2012|date= 22 August 2008|publisher=Solomon Times Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''stock model''' is a person being [[photograph]]ed for one or more pictures in different poses, clothing, places, with or without [[Theatrical property|props]]. For various advertisements, and media projects including [[photo manipulation]]s. For a business or project, stock model photos are cheaper and more practical to use than hiring a model and a photographer.

==Description==
A stock model can be of any size, height, gender, or ethnicity, depending upon what the stock photographer is looking to capture. Examples include a woman walking her [[dog]], a man going to work, and a grandmother baking cookies.

Stock modeling photos can be bought and sold through many sites that sells stock photos. In recent years stock modeling is at an all time high due in part of media projects on the [[internet]] for businesses, home, work, school and leisure. Professions such as various types of artist and business advertisements benefit from the use of stock models. A vast number of artist and photographers use their own collection of stock models for their projects.

==Plot==
&lt;!--Per WP:FILMPLOT, this section should be 400-700 words long.--&gt;
Ohio high-schooler [[Cassie Sullivan]], armed with an [[M4 carbine]], emerges from the woods to raid an abandoned [[gas station]]. Upon entering, she hears a male voice calling for help. She finds a wounded man, who points a gun at her, but they each put their weapons down. His other hand is under his jacket and as he takes it out, she sees a glint of metal and kills him. He was holding a [[Christian cross]] and the screen cuts to black to show her [[backstory]].

A city-sized alien spaceship is circling Earth, containing extraterrestrials referred to as "The Others". Ten days later, The Others unleash their 1st Wave, an [[electromagnetic pulse]] that permanently destroys all electrical power. The 2nd Wave has The Others manipulate&lt;!--- the method is not explained in the film, but in the novel --&gt; the planet's geology and fault lines, causing [[earthquakes]] and [[megatsunamis]] that destroy coastal cities and islands. For the 3rd Wave, The Others weaponize a strain of [[Avian influenza|avian flu virus]], with birds carrying the infectant across the planet. Cassie's mother is one of the casualties.

Cassie, her father and her younger brother Sam, find a summer camp in use as a refuge in the woods with roughly 300 survivors. A few days later, an Army unit with working vehicles rolls into the camp. The unit's commander, Colonel Vosch, claims there is an imminent threat of a 4th Wave and they will take the children to safety at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]], intending to bring the buses back to retrieve the adults. Cassie is separated from Sam, and witnesses the Army massacring all the adults, her father included.

Cassie scavenges her way toward the base, but is shot in the leg by an unseen shooter and passes out. About a week later, she wakes up in the farmhouse of a young man named Evan Walker, who saved her. Cassie leaves towards the base with Evan, but learns that he is an Other, sent years ago as a sleeper agent and merged his consciousness into a human host. The sleepers roam their designated zones, killing human survivors. Evan admits his humanity was reactivated when he saw her, disagrees with the invasion and lets her leave. He warns that Colonel Vosch and the military are possessed by the consciousness of individual Others.

At the base, the military have used deception and technology to convince the rescued children that the humans outside the base have been possessed. They provide military training to the children, forming them into squads to go on kill missions outside the base. Sam has been placed into a squad led by Ben, a boy Cassie had a crush on, along with Ringer, a tough teenage girl, Dumbo and Teacup. While out on a kill mission, Ringer removes her military implant, causing her to register as an Other-possessed human on the squad's scopes. The squad deduces the plan to have them kill real unpossessed humans, making them the 5th Wave. Ben sends his squad into the woods and returns to base, claiming his squad was killed, for the purpose of retrieving Sam, who was left behind.

Ben confronts Colonel Vosch about child warriors being the 5th Wave and Cassie kills Sergeant Reznik during her one-on-one indoctrination spiel. Ben and Cassie find each other and leave to find Sam. Evan sets off numerous bombs and advises them to quickly find Sam before the destruction of the entire facility. Colonel Vosch and the surviving military evacuate with the human children by military aircraft. Cassie, Ben and Sam escape, with help from Ringer, just as Evan completes the destruction of the base.  Ben's squad is reunited and Cassie ponders the strength of hope as humanity's driving force for survival.

===Critical response===
On [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 15% based on 131 reviews and an average rating of 4.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "With unimpressive effects and plot points seemingly pieced together from previous dystopian YA sci-fi films, ''The 5th Wave'' ends up feeling like more of a limp, derivative wriggle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_fifth_wave/ |title= The 5th Wave (2016) |website=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=December 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 33 out of 100 based on 30 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".&lt;ref name="MC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-5th-wave |title=The 5th Wave reviews |website=Metacritic |accessdate=February 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "B–" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="CinemaScore"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/01/box-office-dirty-grandpa-the-5th-wave-the-boy-during-storm-jonas-1201688827/ |title=‘The Revenant’ No. 1, ‘Ride Along’ Skids On Ice |work=deadline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeffrey M. Anderson of ''[[The San Francisco Examiner]]'' said of the film, "Every plot turn and every line of dialogue has been borrowed from somewhere else, and everything is utterly, totally predictable", noting how the film "steals material from (but does not stop at) the ''[[Twilight (2008 film)|Twilight]]'', ''[[The Hunger Games (film)|Hunger Games]]'' and ''[[Divergent (film)|Divergent]]'' franchises."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anderson|first1=Jeffrey M.|title=‘5th Wave’ slogs through ridiculous, predictable plot|url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/5th-wave-slogs-through-ridiculous-predictable-plot/|accessdate=26 June 2017|work=The San Francisco Examiner|date=22 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthony Lane]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' faulted the film as a "marketing wheeze dressed up as an art form, and stupendously summarized by the image of Cassie hurrying through the woods carrying both an assault rifle and a [[Teddy bear]]", adding that the film "appears to have been designed by some crazed [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal]] wing of the [[National Rifle Association|N.R.A.]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lane|first1=Anthony|title=The Current Cinema - Tough Girls: "Jane Got A Gun" and "The Fifth Wave"|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/02/01/tough-girls|website=The New Yorker|accessdate=26 June 2017|date=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rob Vaux of the Sci-Fi Movie Page gave the film one star out of five, saying, "The YA adaptation craze hits a low point with this aimless, purposeless alien invasion story that wastes a fine cast."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scifimoviepage.com/the-5th-wave-movie-review/|title=The 5th Wave — Movie Review|work=Sci-Fi Movie Page}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source|date=June 2017}} In the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', [[Mick LaSalle]] wrote, "rarely does a movie that fails so utterly start so well", falling apart ahead of the fifth wave. As to a possible trilogy, "if we’re not really vigilant, and look to the skies, and prepare, they’re going to make at least two more of these things. We’ve got to beat back the invasion now".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=LaSalle|first=Mick|author-link=Mick LaSalle|url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/movies/article/The-5th-Wave-at-least-the-apocalypse-6774520.php|title=''The 5th Wave'': At least the apocalypse starts well|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=January 21, 2016|accessdate=January 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eddie Cockrell of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave the film a mixed review, saying, "''The 5th Wave'' is an effectively decent post-apocalyptic, young adult, world-in-the-balance survival thriller" with an "arrestingly original spin on trendy genre tropes", although he suggested that fans of the book may have "issues with what has been edited".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/reviews/the-5th-wave-review-chloe-grace-moretz-1201679744/|title=‘The 5th Wave’ Review: A Decent Adaptation of Rick Yancey’s Novel - Variety|author=Eddie Cockrell|work=Variety}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brian Truitt of ''[[USA Today]]'' gave the film a positive review, stating that it "is an inviting sci-fi invasion" and "nicely stokes the imagination of a new generation of science-fiction movie nerds". He praised Moretz and Robinson as "equally strong" co-leads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2016/01/21/review-the-5th-wave-movie/79013726/|title=Review: '5th Wave' is an inviting sci-fi invasion|publisher=USA Today|author=Brian Truitt|date=January 21, 2016|accessdate=December 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shannon Harvey of ''[[The West Australian]]'' also gave the film a positive review, writing, "It’s actually got a lot going for it, from acting prodigy Chloe Grace Moretz as the kind of tough but fragile heroine you can cheer for to handsome production values, several plot twists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/entertainment/a/30601034/the-5th-wave-too-familiar-to-be-thrilling/|title=The 5th Wave too familiar to be thrilling. - The West Australian|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Patterson of ''[[Moviepilot]]'' gave the film a positive review, calling it a "thrilling story of survival".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moviepilot.com/reviews/3749541|title=The 5th Wave: A Thrilling Story of  Survival!|author=Michael Patterson|date=January 23, 2016|work=moviepilot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Fairly OddParents''''' is an American [[animated television series]] created by [[Butch Hartman]] that originally aired on [[Nickelodeon]] from March 30, 2001, to July 26, 2017. The series follows the everyday misadventures of [[Timmy Tiberius Turner|Timmy Turner]], a boy who is granted two fairy godparents named Cosmo and Wanda. It was produced by [[Nelvana]] (2001–2004), [[Frederator Studios]], [[Nickelodeon Animation Studio]]s and [[Billionfold Inc.]] (2008–2017).

The series originated from shorts on the animation showcase, ''[[Oh Yeah! Cartoons]]'', airing from 1998 to 2001. It was later picked up as a series due to its popularity. Originally, it ended in 2006 totaling five seasons, but resumed production in 2008. The series was cancelled after the 10th season.

==Overview==
Set in the fictional town of Dimmsdale, California, a 10-year-old boy named Timmy Turner is neglected by his parents and tortured by his babysitter Vicky. One day, he is granted two fairy godparents, Cosmo and Wanda, who grant his every wish to improve his miserable life. However, these wishes are guaranteed to inadvertently cause a series of technical problems that Timmy must fix. In the beginning of the series, Timmy's babysitter Vicky was the main antagonist. As the series progressed, more villains were included; for example, his teacher, Mr. Crocker, firmly believes in fairy godparents and has been searching for them a very long time, correctly suspecting that Timmy has fairy godparents. He is dangerous to Timmy because, according to ''Da Rules'', a large rulebook that defines what children can and cannot wish for and how fairy godparents must behave, no one else can know about his fairy godparents and they will be taken away if this happens (although they don't remember, Cosmo and Wanda once used to be Crocker's fairy godparents, as this rule does not apply to people who currently have their own or once had fairy godparents).

At his school, Timmy is often bullied by Francis, a vicious boy who claims to be the toughest student in school, but reveals to Timmy that he only takes out his anger on him because of his rough home life and abusive parents. Jorgen Von Strangle, the enormous and tough head fairy with an [[Austrian accent]], similar to that of [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], personally dislikes Timmy and his fairies at first, but at times he has to assist them in fixing their problems.

Later in the series, Timmy wished that Cosmo and Wanda would have a baby, whom they named Poof. More recently, Timmy got a pet fairy dog named Sparky. Also introduced is the premise that for every fairy, there is also an anti-fairy. The anti-fairies are similar to the real ones, but with opposite personalities and character traits. For example, Anti-Cosmo is intelligent and speaks with an [[British English|English accent]] while real Cosmo is dim-witted. Similarly, Anti-Wanda is also dim-witted and speaks with a [[Southern United States English|Southern American accent]] while real Wanda is intelligent. When Poof was born, his anti-fairy was created. Anti-Poof's name is Foop (Poof spelled backwards). While Poof is spherical, Foop is shaped like a cube. Foop's goal in life is to cause mayhem and destroy his nemesis Poof.

Even later in the series, Timmy is informed that due to a shortage of available fairies, he must now share Cosmo and Wanda with his new neighbor, Chloe Carmichael, who is essentially his polar opposite. She loves sharing, animals, and everything that is ecologically friendly.

==Setting==
''The Fairly OddParents'' is set in the fictional city of Dimmsdale, California. The city appears to be average-sized, with a downtown containing large buildings and a city hall but also containing uptown areas with residences (including the house where Timmy and his parents and godparents live) and businesses (including Timmy's school; a hospital; stores; a sports complex named the Dimmadome, named after its founder and owner; the local TV channel; and various restaurants and stores) as well as a park in the center of the city. The city also appears to have rural farmland located somewhere outside of the city. The adults in the city are notably moronic and often settle situations with things like angry mobs, but they do still form a structured and complex society capable of working as a city. In the episode "Which Witch is Which", it was revealed that Dimmsdale was founded in the 1630s after Dale Dimm managed to defeat a witch hunter who was secretly a witch named Alden Biterroot (a possible ancestor of Denzel Crocker).

When the show needs to, it switches its location to Fairy World, the magical realm and home of the fairies which is a floating world located within the sky and colored with an abundance of pink. The fairies have a civilization like that of the humans, but with a source of power being magic, which also keeps the world afloat. A large rainbow acts as the bridge between Fairy World and the Earth. Another location sometimes seen is the city of Chincinatti, the home town of Timmy's favorite comic book superhero, the Crimson Chin. Other locations include the dark and twisted Anti-Fairy World, the dark counterpart of Fairy World where the anti-fairies live; the dull and gray metropolis of Pixies Inc., home of the pixies; and Yugopotamia, where an alien, Mark Chang, lives, who is also Timmy's friend.

===Origins (1998–2001)===
{{further|The Fairly OddParents shorts}}
[[File:The Fairly OddParents postcard 1998.jpg|thumb|left|A postcard for ''The Fairly OddParents'' segment on Nickelodeon's ''Oh Yeah! Cartoons'']]

''The Fairly OddParents'' was originally pitched to [[Cartoon Network]]. The pilot was never shown to Cartoon Network, but it was pitched while show creator Butch Hartman was working on Cartoon Network's ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'', ''[[Johnny Bravo]]'', ''[[Cow and Chicken]]'', and ''[[I Am Weasel]]''. The show's pilot was not actually made until the show was pitched to Nick.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.imgrum.net/media/1223543557151819817_1926039129|title=Fairly Odd Parents was originally pitched to Cartoon Network. -- The pilot was never shown to Cartoo - nicktoonsfactss|website=imgrum}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source|date=March 2018}} Creator/Producer Butch Hartman originally created ''The Fairly OddParents'' as a seven-minute [[short film]] entitled ''Fairy Godparents'', one of 39 short cartoons in the first season of [[Fred Seibert]]'s ''[[Oh Yeah! Cartoons]]''. Butch Hartman made six more short films for the show in season 3. Nickelodeon agreed to a seven episode order (consisting of two 11-minute segments) of "The Fairly Oddparents", which began airing on March 30, 2001, in the half-hour after fellow Nicktoon ''[[Invader Zim]]''.

Unlike the half-hour series, the animation in the shorts is not as smooth, and the designs are notably different (including Timmy's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Turner, who are only seen from the neck down with their faces hidden in the [[Television pilot|pilot episode]]s and appear to be more intelligent than they appeared to be in the proceeding series, yet still easily duped by Vicky's abhorrent actions). Other notable differences include the voices like Timmy Turner, who was voiced by [[Mary Kay Bergman]] instead of Tara Strong. Cosmo is significantly more intelligent than he appears to be in the proceeding series. Wanda is shown to be less intelligent and less of a nag. Vicky is much less evil than in the current series. She also calls Timmy by his name as opposed to the more often used "twerp".

Originally, Hartman wanted Timmy to wear a blue hat, but since it would blend in with the walls of the bedroom, he decided to make it pink. Wanda was originally going to be named "Venus", but instead named her Wanda. Her middle name was and still is "Venus."

===Original run (2001–2006)===
[[File:Fairly OddParents Title Card.jpg|thumb|The title card of the show (Season 9)]]

''The Fairly OddParents'' was immediately popular, greatly increasing its lead-in rating from ''Invader Zim''. In fact, no matter what time slot Nickelodeon placed the show in, Nick's ratings soared. The series attracted a wider than anticipated audience, appealing to all ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Keveney|first=Bill|title='OddParents' looks fairly successful|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2003-10-28-oddparents_x.htm|accessdate=November 17, 2012|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=October 28, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later Nickelodeon's highest rated show. Early 2002 and 2003 was the first peak of popularity for ''The Fairly OddParents''. Its ratings skyrocketed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=PETROZZELLO|first=DONNA|title='Oddparents' Casts A Spell|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2002-11-11/entertainment/18212267_1_oddparents-nickelodeon-cartoons|accessdate=11 November 2012|newspaper=[[New York Daily News]]|date=November 11, 2002}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The series appeared in a $50 [[Best Western]] travel card during summer 2006 and again in summer 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PRESS RELEASE: Best Western Celebrates Summer With Top-Rated Kids' Networks, Nickelodeon and YTV, Launching Promotion With ''The Fairly Oddparents''|url=http://finance.boston.com/boston/news/read/2575033/best_western_celebrates_summer_with_top|work=boston.com|publisher=[[Best Western]]|accessdate=October 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A theatrical film based on the series was planned for release by [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[Nickelodeon Movies]], but it was eventually dropped because of [[Viacom_(original)#2005_split|a management change at Paramount]], although the script was written. Hartman stated on his website&lt;ref name=official&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.butchhartman.com|title=Butch Hartman Web site}}&lt;/ref&gt; that he would like to release the film on DVD one day, but there were not definitive plans to do so.&lt;ref name=official/&gt;

On January 24, 2006, Butch Hartman announced on his forum&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://butchhartman.com/forumIII/index.php?showtopic=7072|title=butchhartman.com|work=butchhartman.com|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; that [[Nickelodeon]] had ceased production of the show. "The Jimmy Timmy Power Hour 3: The Jerkinators" was intended to be the fifth-season finale and [[series finale]] in production order, airing on July 21, 2006. However, Nickelodeon broadcast the episode "Timmy the Barbarian/No Substitute for Crazy" after "The Jerkinators" as the fifth-season finale, on November 25 of that year.

===Revival (2007–2011)===
Hartman announced on his forum&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://butchhartman.com/forumIII/index.php?showtopic=12732|title=butchhartman.com|work=butchhartman.com|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; on February 2, 2007, that Nick granted ''Fairly OddParents'' twenty more episode slots, making sure the show resumed production. Later on July 7, "77 Secrets of the Fairly OddParents Revealed" hinted that a new character would join the series.

After a one-year hiatus, [[Nickelodeon]] announced on TV that they would begin the broadcast of a [[television movie]] called ''[[Fairly OddBaby]]'' as the beginning of at least 20 episodes of Season 6, and to carry the show to at least the year 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://frederatorblogs.com/odd/2007/12/20/the-oddparents-are-coming-the-oddparents-are/|title=The OddParents are coming the OddParents are coming}}&lt;/ref&gt; A huge hit, ''Fairly OddBaby'' aired on February 18, 2008, becoming the top entertainment program across broadcast and basic cable TV for the year among kids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bynum|first=Aaron|title=Nick: 'Fairly OddBaby' Ratings|url=http://www.animationinsider.net/article.php?articleID=1634|accessdate=17 November 2012|newspaper=Animation Insider|date=22 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Live-action films and end of the show (2011–2017)===
{{see also|The Fairly OddParents (film series)}}

On March 14, 2012, the series was renewed for [[The Fairly OddParents (season 9)|a ninth season]] with new episodes that were scheduled to broadcast that year.&lt;ref name="upfront2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ir.viacom.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=657348|title=Nickelodeon Unveils Plans at Annual Upfront for More than 650 New Episodes Across Every Genre (NYSE:VIAB)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the second live action film, ''[[A Fairly Odd Christmas]]'', aired in November 2012. The ninth season premiered the same day as the 2013 Kids Choice Awards. The ninth season introduced another character, Timmy's fairy dog, Sparky. Season nine is also the first season to be formatted in [[High-definition video|high definition]] and [[widescreen]]. In 2013, it was announced there would be a third installment called ''[[A Fairly Odd Summer]]'' with Drake Bell and Daniella Monet reprising their respective roles. The movie premiered on August 2, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ubcp.com/wp-content/uploads/Sept-12-2013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; New episodes were confirmed by Fred Seibert on April 11, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fredseibert.frederator.com/post/116119585607/ok-were-incredibly-excited-for-butch-hartman|title=Fred Seibert's Tumblr|work=frederator.com|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 17, 2015, a tenth season was announced, and introduced another character, Chloe Carmichael, Timmy's new neighbor who also has Cosmo and Wanda as her fairy godparents. The tenth season aired from January 15, 2016, to July 26, 2017, on both [[Nickelodeon]] and [[Nicktoons (TV channel)|Nicktoons]].

== Failed spin-off and theatrical/direct to video film==
In 2004, [[Butch Hartman]] revealed his intentions to make a ''Crash Nebula'' spin-off. The pilot episode "Crash Nebula" was aired as part of the [[The Fairly OddParents (season 4)|show's fourth season]]. Despite this, [[Nickelodeon]] decided to not pick up the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manic-expression.com/top-5-rejected-nickelodeon-shows-or-pilots-that-should-never-be-made/|title=Top 5 Rejected Nickelodeon Shows or Pilots That Should Never Be Made|date=20 September 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2006, Hartman stated that he was confident and would try to get the spin-off greenlighted in the future. He also wrote a script entitled ''Crash Nebula: The Movie'' for [[Paramount Pictures]], but the film was cancelled due to its similarities with Disney's ''[[Sky High (2005 film)|Sky High]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/the-fairly-oddparents/crash-nebula-321929/trivia/|title=The Fairly OddParents: Crash Nebula|first=|last=TV.com|website=TV.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 or 2006, Butch Hartman had also considered making a theatrical adaptation of his animated television series ''The Fairly OddParents'' after the show's initial cancellation in 2006, produced by [[Nickelodeon Movies]] and [[Paramount Pictures]]. The film was to be animated much like the series as well as previous Nickelodeon fare such as the [[Rugrats (film series)|''Rugrats'' film series]] and ''[[The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie]]'', but was scrapped due to [[Viacom (original)#2005 split|a management change at Paramount]] although the script was already written. Despite this, Hartman expressed interest in releasing the film [[Direct-to-video|for DVD]] someday, and stated that the script could serve for another [[TV movie]] of the show. However, with the show's cancellation on July 26, 2017 and Butch Hartman's decision to leave Nickelodeon in early 2018&lt;ref name="leave1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hartman|first1=Butch|title=Why I Left Nickelodeon|url=https://soundcloud.com/user-978368492/why-i-left-nickelodeon|via=SoundCloud|accessdate=February 10, 2018|date=February 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="leave2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hartman|first1=Butch|title=Why I Left Nickelodeon|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4faDISwSVo|via=YouTube|accessdate=February 9, 2018|date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, it seemingly ends any chances of that happening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/digital/news/butch-hartman-pocketwatch-hobbykidstv-1202584593/|title=‘Fairly OddParents’ Creator Butch Hartman Developing Three Series With Startup Pocket.watch|last=Spangler|first=Todd|date=17 October 2017|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
During its original 5–season run, the series received immensely positive reviews despite some criticism for focusing solely on child-based humor while other Nickelodeon shows such as ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' included adult-based humor and dark humor.

Despite concerns about if the show would [[jump the shark]], the introduction of the character Poof in "[[Fairly OddBaby]]" was well received. Seasons 6 through 8 received positive reviews even as several possible finales such as the "[[Wishology]]" Trilogy and "Timmy's Secret Wish" airing with the show continuing afterwards.

The introduction of the character Sparky in season 9 was heavily criticized with the character being deemed unnecessary and annoying. His introduction, seen as an attempt to increase ratings, has been compared to the character [[Scrappy-Doo]] in the ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' franchise. As a result, his character was removed for season 10.

'''''The Other Side of the Mountain Part 2''''' is a 1978 film directed by [[Larry Peerce]]. It stars [[Marilyn Hassett]] and [[Timothy Bottoms]]. It is a sequel to ''[[The Other Side of the Mountain]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://allmovie.com/work/the-other-side-of-the-mountain-2-36720&lt;/ref&gt; It follows a recovered [[Jill Kinmont]] who goes to Southern California and meets a man named John, who she falls for. But as they learn later, there is more to deal with than just a new romance.

==Cast==
*[[Marilyn Hassett]] as [[Jill Kinmont]]
*[[Timothy Bottoms]] as John Boothe
*[[Nan Martin]] as June Kinmont
*[[Belinda Montgomery]] as Audra Jo Nicholson
*[[Gretchen Corbett]] as Linda Mae Myers

==Production==
''The Other Side of the Mountain Part 2'' was filmed on location in [[Bishop, California]], and [[Victoria, British Columbia]].

==Reception==
[[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' was not impressed: "The first film, directed by Larry Peerce, who also directed the spinoff, was a slickly prefabricated bathtub of movie sentimentality, at the heart of which was a gallant young woman facing real handicaps. 'Part II' is really a 30-minute postscript to that story, blown up to feature-length by artificial plot problems and so many flashbacks to the first movie that the second becomes a sort of reverse trailer, a coming attraction for something that's already gone. ... Mr. Peerce's direction suggests a certain amount of desperation. You can almost hear him asking, 'What can I do to make things interesting?'"&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Canby, "What Happened After 'The Other Side': In Love With a Trucker" Mar. 28, 1978 https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=990DEFDD1731E632A25757C2A9659C946990D6CF&lt;/ref&gt;

The 3-hour event was video-taped and a 95-minute television special adapted from the show was broadcast the following day, Sunday 5 October 2008, on Britain's [[Channel Four]]. There was also a "cinecast" in which the Royal Albert Hall event was shown live in 35 cinemas in major British cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.protectthehuman.com/articles/secretpolicemancinecasts|title=Home|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also available live in 4 cinemas in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greaterunion.com.au/movies/7048/Secret-Policeman's-Ball-08.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=September 30, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804184840/http://www.greaterunion.com.au/movies/7048/Secret-Policeman's-Ball-08.htm |archivedate=August 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The "cinecast" was available in cinemas in six of [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canada's thirteen provinces and territories]].

'''''The X-Files Mythology – Volume 4''''' collection is the fourth DVD release containing selected episodes from the [[The X-Files (season 8)|eighth]] to the [[The X-Files (season 9)|ninth]] seasons of the American [[science fiction on television|science fiction]] television series ''[[The X-Files]]''. The episodes collected in the release form the end of the series' [[Mythology of The X-Files|mythology]], and are centered on those that involve the alien "[[Colonist (The X-Files)#"Super Soldiers"|Super Soldier]]s" and [[Dana Scully]]'s ([[Gillian Anderson]]) son, [[List of The X-Files characters#Baby William|William]].

The collection contains seven episodes from the eighth season and seven from the ninth. The episodes follow the investigations of paranormal-related cases, or [[X-File]]s, by [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) special agents [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) and [[John Doggett]] ([[Robert Patrick]]), following Scully's former partner [[Fox Mulder]]'s ([[David Duchovny]]) abduction by aliens. The two are assisted by Assistant Director [[Walter Skinner]] ([[Mitch Pileggi]]) and Agent [[Monica Reyes]] ([[Annabeth Gish]]). Events covered in the episodes include: the return, death, and resurrection of Mulder; the birth of Scully's child, William; the discovery of the "Super Soldier" conspiracy; the discovery of the remains of a space ship in Canada; Scully's choice to give William up for adoption; and Mulder's trial, conviction, escape, and discovery of the truth.

The collection contains the final episodes in the series' mythology, or fictional overarching story. The release features the closure of most of the series' long-running arcs. Production for the episodes was drastically affected after co-star Duchovny left the show. Released on  November 22, 2005, the collection received mixed to negative reviews from critics. [[Adam Baldwin]], [[Chris Owens (actor)|Chris Owens]], [[Nicholas Lea]], [[Laurie Holden]], and [[William B. Davis]] all play supporting roles in the collection.

Reluctantly accepting Krycek's assistance, Mulder, Doggett and Skinner learn that an alien virus recently created in secret by members of the [[United States government]] have replaced several humans, including Miles and several high-ranking FBI personnel, with so-called alien "[[Super Soldiers (The X-Files)|Super Soldiers]]". Krycek claims that the soldiers are virtually unstoppable aliens who want to make sure that humans will not survive the colonization of [[Earth]].

Mulder goes into hiding, Scully is again reassigned to the [[FBI Academy]], and Reyes becomes Doggett's new FBI partner at the X-Files office. Doggett, Scully, and Reyes discover a conspiracy to place [[Chloramine]] in the nation's water, causing mutations and creating "Super Soldiers". This leads them to a clandestine laboratory where a secret experiment is taking place on board, with connections to Scully's child, William.

==Production==
[[File:David Duchovny 2011 Shankbone.JPG|The collection features co-star [[David Duchovny]] in only half of the episodes, due to him leaving after the eighth season.|200px|thumb|right]]
After settling his contract dispute with [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], Duchovny quit full-time participation in the show after the [[The X-Files (season 7)|seventh season]].&lt;ref name=bbcnews&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1337685.stm |title=Duchovny quits X-Files |work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]] |date=18 May 2001 |accessdate=5 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to explain Mulder's absence, Duchovny's character was abducted by aliens in the seventh season finale, "[[Requiem (The X-Files)|Requiem]]." After several rounds of contractual discussions, Duchovny agreed to return for a total of 11 eighth season episodes.&lt;ref name=space&gt;{{cite web |author=Elber, Lynn |url=http://www.space.com/sciencefiction/tv/xfiles_duchovny_000518_wg.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040924004848/http://space.com/sciencefiction/tv/xfiles_duchovny_000518_wg.html |archivedate=24 September 2004 |title=Fox Mulder 'Ready to Get Back to Work' |work=''[[Space.com]]'' |publisher=TechMediaNetwork |date=18 May 2000 |accessdate=5 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, "Per Manum" marked the return of Duchovny as Mulder, although he had appeared briefly in flashback appearances and small cameos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McAlister|first=Nancy|title='X-Files' viewers wait for resolution|newspaper=[[The Florida Times-Union]]|publisher=[[Morris Communications]]|date=28 February 2001|pages=C2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Series creator [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] later argued that Mulder's absences from the series did not affect the characterization, noting that "there are characters who can be powerful as absent centers, as Mulder was through the eight and ninth seasons."&lt;ref name="Bigbook"&gt;Hurwitz and Knowles, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt;

After the end of the eighth season, Duchovny announced that he would leave the show for good.&lt;ref name="bigbook2"&gt;Hurwitz and Knowles, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, lead actress Anderson's contract also expired at the end of the eighth season.&lt;ref name="bigbook2"/&gt; Anderson had expressed her growing disinterest in the series ever since the beginning of the eighth season, saying "For a lot of people, if you don't like your job, you can quit your job, I don't necessarily have that option."&lt;ref name="wan"/&gt; Anderson cited the fact that "eight years is a long time" as a contributing factor to her indifference.&lt;ref name="wan"&gt;{{cite news|title='X-Files' Appeal Waning for Co-Star Anderson|url=http://docs.newsbank.com.www2.lib.ku.edu:2048/s/InfoWeb/aggdocs/NewsBank/0EC2C180D9AD0C1F/0F8479522BD09CA1?s_lang=en-US|accessdate=22 March 2012|newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|publisher=[[Block Communications]]|date=12 May 2001|page=B9}} {{subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Carter soon changed his position and announced he would remain on the show and continue only if Anderson agreed to do another season. Eventually, Fox offered Anderson a "generous" incentive to stay, resulting in the retention of Carter and Anderson and a final season of the show.&lt;ref name="bigbook2"/&gt; With the departure of Duchovny and limited use of Anderson, the show garnered much criticism by fans and critics alike, saying the bond between Mulder and Scully was what actually kept the show together for the [[List of The X-Files episodes|first seven seasons]] of the show.&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{cite news | author=KJN | url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/354/354900p1.html | title=X-Files Gets Set to Jump the Shark | publisher=[[News Corporation]]|work=[[IGN]] | date=March 5, 2002 | accessdate=August 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Going into the ninth season, the producers decided to drastically change the show. The style of the opening credits in "Nothing Important Happened Today" were changed from the original credits, which, more or less, had been the same for the previous eight seasons. The credits included new graphics as well as new cards for Gish and Pileggi.&lt;ref name="Characterprofile"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=[[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] |date=2002 |title=The Truth Behind Season 9 |medium= DVD |location =''[[The X-Files (season 9)|The X-Files: The Complete Ninth Season]]''|publisher=[[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]]|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The finale episode of the series, "[[The Truth (The X-Files)|The Truth]]", was written by series creator Carter; he later noted, "It's the end—you don't get another chance. So you'd better put everything you've ever wanted to put in into the episode. There were things to distract us from what was really going on. The band was breaking up."&lt;ref name="Bigbook3"&gt;Hurwritz and Knowles, pp. 209–216&lt;/ref&gt; He expounded on the idea, saying, "Frank [Spotnitz] and I [decided] it was probably time to go […] it was strange to be writing these things knowing it was the last time we'd see Scully doing certain things or hear Mulder saying certain things."&lt;ref name="truthtruth"/&gt; Spotnitz explained, "What was kind of nice that Chris made the announcement in January is that we had times to wrap our minds around the end and plan for it and give all of the characters their due."&lt;ref name="truthtruth"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=[[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] |year=2002 |title=The Truth Behind Season 9: "The Truth" |medium= DVD |location =''[[The X-Files (season 9)|The X-Files: The Complete Ninth Season]]''|publisher=[[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]]|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gish later said, "I have a great respect for the elegant in which they're closing the curtain".&lt;ref name="reflect"/&gt; [[Bruce Harwood]] called the finale the "passing of a generation".&lt;ref name="reflect"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=[[Paul Rabwin]] |year=2002 |title=Reflections on the Truth |location= ''[[The X-Files (season 9)|The X-Files: The Complete Ninth Season]]'' |medium= DVD |publisher=[[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The collection, as well as the episodes themselves, received mixed to negative reviews from critics. Monica Kuebler of ''[[Exclaim!]]'' gave the collection a rather negative review and noted that it closed on a "lacklustre note".&lt;ref name=exclaim/&gt; Furthermore, she wrote that the main issue with the release was that "the hardcore fans [of the series] had come to see ''The X-Files'' as Mulder and Scully and understandably weren't quick to swallow a couple of new characters running the department."&lt;ref name=exclaim/&gt; Ultimately, she concluded that the poor episodes and the lack of bonus features included with the collection were proof that "Fox seems eager to wash their hands of the disappointing demise of the show".&lt;ref name=exclaim&gt;{{cite web|last=Kuebler|first=Monica|title=The X-Files: Super Soldiers|url=http://exclaim.ca/Reviews/Dvd/x-files_super_soldiers-x-files_super|work=[[Exclaim!]]|publisher=Ian Danzig|accessdate=4 August 2012|date=December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sabadino Parker from ''[[PopMatters]]'' wrote negatively about the mythology of the last two seasons, noting that "story itself became even more convoluted" and that "the past two seasons should never have happened."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Parker, Sabadino | url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/x-files4 | title=I Don't Believe It | work=[[PopMatters]] | date=May 15, 2002 | accessdate=August 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' reviewer Ken Tucker speculated that [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] was the only one who seemed to understand the show's complex mytharc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Tucker, Ken | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,184758,00.html | title=The X-Files (1993 – 2002) | work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |publisher=[[Time Inc]]| date=November 16, 2001 | accessdate=August 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joyce Millman from ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the storyline involving Scully's child—which left her "haunted and irritable"—"a sad misuse of the radiant Anderson".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Millman, Joyce | url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/10/10/1034061299444.html | title=The Nearly Ex Files| work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]| date=October 10, 2002 | accessdate=August 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The A.V.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7045">'''Theatre pedagogy''' ({{lang-de|Theaterpädagogik}}) is an independent discipline combining both [[theatre]] and [[pedagogy]]. As a field that arose during the 20th century, theatre pedagogy has developed separately from drama education, the distinction being that the drama teacher typically teaches method, theory and/or practice of performance alone, while theatre pedagogy integrates both art and education to develop language and strengthen social awareness. Theatre pedagogy is rooted in [[drama]] and [[stagecraft]], yet works to educate people outside the realm of theatre itself.

==History==

As a movement, theatre pedagogy has many founders. In Germany, where it is widely recognized and practiced, Hans-Wolfgang Nickel is cited as a pioneer in theatre pedagogy with the founding of the Berlin Stage Teachers in 1959. Nickel later became a professor of theatre games and educational activities at the Berlin [[School of Education]] in 1974.

Another well known German theatre [[pedagogue]] is Hans Martin Ritter who, starting in 1973, ran a series of tests using [[Bertholt Brecht]]'s model of learning through play. Ritter's aim was to develop an interdisciplinary project method for the school using theater as a form of teaching and learning. These tests led Ritter to co-found a nationwide pilot program in merging the fields of theatre and education.

Perhaps theatre pedagogy's most internationally known theorist and practitioner is Brazilian director/facilitator [[Augusto Boal]], who created [[Theatre of the Oppressed]], now practiced by millions of people in more than 70 nations.

==Description==

The primary purpose of theatre pedagogy is to bring about change in understanding the world around us. In achieving this objective, several other skills are taught and learned. These include:

* Developing language, including non-verbal and non-written language.
* Honing drama skills and a theatrical vocabulary.
* Use of collective action to overcome problems in the community.

Theatre pedagogy enhances these forms of communication to facilitate human interaction, helping participants to learn about themselves, their peers, and their surrounding world. Rooted both in traditional education and amateur theater, the field of theatre pedagogy has grown to span many sectors, including:

* Use of drama in the social sphere, such as work in prisons, with people in recovery, as violence prevention, etc.
* Theatrical collaboration between [[Layperson|laypeople]] and [[actor]]s.
* As education, both in ordinary schools and in the theatre.&lt;ref name="CCDC Edu"&gt;{{cite web|title=Theatre of the Oppressed in Education|url=http://www.ccdc.in/theatre-oppressed-in-education|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[medical education]] improving communication between faculty and students and between physicians and patients.&lt;ref name="CCDC UCMS"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ramaswamy|first=Radha|title=UCMS|url=http://www.ccdc.in/theater-oppressed-workshops/feedback/ucms|work=Medical students at University College of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.|publisher=Center for Community Dialogue and Change|accessdate=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In job training, integrating [[kinesthetic]] learning to teach [[public speaking]], [[body language]] awareness, motivational training, etc.
* Developing contact between theatre-makers and their audiences.
* Specific theatrical techniques and dramatic forms, such as [[Forum_theatre|Forum Theatre]] and other methods from the [[Theatre of the Oppressed]].

Practitioners of theatre pedagogy operate with a situation-oriented educational framework, usually using the medium of theatre as a vehicle to achieve an objective. Through this method, theatre pedagogy gives access to participants' own ideas and impulses, expanding the avenues of communication and interaction with the self and one's sociocultural environment. Through the use of gesture, intonation, facial expression, and behavior onstage, participants analyze these performative aspects created by the dramatic tension of everyday life. Through these physical and personality-affected models, real-life situations can more clearly express themselves.

==Training==

Theatre pedagogy is taught at universities and colleges, though training in the field is not regulated by state guidelines. In Germany one can receive  a theatre pedagogy degree both at the undergraduate and graduate level, and many German cities have theatre pedagogy centers that provide less formal and unregulated training. Similar to these are the Centers for Theatre of the Oppressed, such as CTO [[Rio de Janeiro|Rio]] in [[Brazil]] and the Theatre of the Oppressed Laboratory in [[New York City]] where people can receive theatre pedagogy training using Augusto Boal and [[Paulo Freire]]'s methods.

In the United States, three higher education institutions with strong theatre and drama pedagogy programs are CUNY School of Professional Studies MA in Applied Theatre, New York University Steinhardt's Educational Theatre program, and Emerson College's MA in Theatre Education.

In the Hebrew Bible, the '''Witch of [[Endor (village)|Endor]]''' is a woman who summons the [[prophet]] [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]]'s spirit, at the demand of King [[Saul the King|Saul]] of the [[Kingdom of Israel (united kingdom)|Kingdom of Israel]] in the 28th chapter of the [[Books of Samuel|''First Book of Samuel'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse-nb|1|Samuel|28:3–25|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; The witch is absent from the version of that event recounted in the [[Deuterocanonical books|deuterocanonical]] [[Sirach|''Book of Sirach'']] (46:19–20).

==Etymology==
She is called in [[Biblical Hebrew]] אֵ֥שֶׁת בַּֽעֲלַת־אֹ֖וב בְּעֵ֥ין דֹּֽור (''’êšeṯ ba‘ălaṯ-’ōḇ bə-‘Êndōr''), "a woman, possessor of an ''’ōḇ'' at Endor". The word אֹ֖וב ''’ōḇ'' has been suggested by [[Harry A. Hoffner|Harry Hoffner]] to refer to a ritual pit for summoning the dead from the netherworld, based on parallels in other Near Eastern and Mediterranean cultures. The word has cognates in other regional languages (cf. Sumerian ''ab'', Akkadian ''âbu'', Hittite ''a-a-bi'', Ugaritic ''ib'') and the witch of Endor's ritual has parallels in Babylonian and Hittite magical texts as well as the [[Odyssey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hoffner|first=Harry A.|date=1967|title=Second Millenium Antecedents to the Hebrew 'Ôḇ|jstor=3262793|journal=Journal of Biblical Literature|volume=86|issue=4|pages=385–401|doi=10.2307/3262793}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OtOhypZz_pEC&amp;lpg=PA380&amp;ots=k2Lsro9xgx&amp;dq=sumerian%20ritual%20pits&amp;pg=PA380#v=onepage|title=Life in Biblical Israel|last=King|first=Philip J.|last2=Stager|first2=Lawrence E.|date=2001|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=9780664221485|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other suggestions for a definition of ''’ōḇ'' include a familiar spirit, a [[talisman]],&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[[Emil G. Hirsch]] (1911). "[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=366&amp;letter=E Endor, the witch of]". ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bota bag|wineskin]], or a reference to [[ventriloquism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia|page=307|editor=Geoffrey W. Bromiley|author=D. E. Aune|year=1959|quote=... of 'ob (RSV 'medium'). According to one view it is the same word that means a 'bottle made out of skins' ('wineskin,' Job 32:19). The term would then refer to the technique of ventriloquism or, more accurately, 'belly-talking'.|chapter=Medium}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on the Septuagint translation.

The witch also claims to see "[[elohim]] arising" (plural verb) from the ground, using the word typically translated as "god(s)" to refer to the spirits of the dead. This is also paralleled by the use of the Akkadian cognate word ''ilu'' "god" in a similar fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rhb20fH7cZYC&amp;lpg=PA325&amp;ots=EqS7j97tAt&amp;dq=summoning%20the%20dead%20ancient%20near%20east%20samuel&amp;pg=PA325#v=onepage&amp;q=summoning%20the%20dead%20ancient%20near%20east%20samuel&amp;f=false|title=Ancient Near Eastern Thought and the Old Testament: Introducing the Conceptual World of the Hebrew Bible|last=Walton|first=John H.|date=2006-11-01|publisher=Baker Academic|isbn=9781585582914|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Greek [[Septuagint]], she is called ἐγγαστρίμυθος ἐν Αενδωρ ''engastrímythos en Aendōr'', while the [[Vulgate|Latin Vulgate]] as ''pythonem in Aendor'', both terms referencing then-contemporary pagan [[oracle]]s.

==Story==
When Samuel dies, he is buried in [[Ramathaim-Zophim|Ramah]].  Saul, the current King of Israel, seeks wisdom from God in choosing a course of action against the assembled forces of the [[Philistines]]. He receives no answer from [[dream]]s, prophets, or the [[Urim and Thummim]]. Having driven out all [[necromancer]]s and [[Magician (paranormal)|magicians]] from Israel, Saul searches for a witch anonymously and in disguise. His search leads him to a woman of Endor, who claims that she can see the ghost of Samuel rising from the abode of the dead.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geza Vermes]] (2008)'' The Resurrection''. London, Penguin: 25–6&lt;/ref&gt;

The voice of the prophet's ghost at first frightens the witch of Endor, and after complaining of being disturbed, berates Saul for disobeying God, and predicts Saul's downfall. The spirit reiterates a pre-mortem prophecy by Samuel, adding that Saul will perish with his whole army in battle the next day. Saul is terrified.  The next day, his army is defeated as prophesied, and Saul commits suicide.

Although Saul is depicted as an enemy to witches and [[Divination|diviners]], the Witch of Endor comforts Saul when she sees his distress and insists on feeding him before he leaves.

Since this passage never states that the witch was responsible for the appearance of Samuel's spirit, and it states the witch made a loud cry in fear when she saw Samuel's spirit, scholars believe that the witch had actually never acted as a medium between Saul and Samuel and summoned Samuel's spirit to begin with but, rather, this was the work of God in the passage.&lt;ref&gt;Beuken, Willem. "I Samuel 28: The Prophet as "Hammer of Witches"." Journal for the Study of the Old Testament 3.6 (1978): 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keil, Carl Friedrich, and Franz Delitzsch. ''Biblical Commentary on the Books of Samuel''. Eerdmans, 1956, 262.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joyce Baldwin]] writes that "The Incident does not tell us anything about the veracity of claims to consult the dead on the part of mediums, because the Indications are that this was an extraordinary event for her (the woman), and a frightening one because she was not in control."&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, Joyce. ''1 and 2 Samuel: An Introduction and Commentary''. 1989, 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

''&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;''

==Interpretations==

===Judaism===

The ''[[Yalkut Shimoni]]'' (11th century) identifies the anonymous witch as the mother of [[Abner]].&lt;ref&gt;Yalḳ, Sam. 140, from Pirḳe R. El.&lt;/ref&gt; Based upon the witch's claim to have seen something, and Saul having heard a disembodied voice, the ''Yalkut'' suggests that necromancers are able to see the spirits of the dead but are unable to hear their speech, while the person for whom the deceased was summoned hears the voice but fails to see anything.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

[[Antoine Augustin Calmet]] briefly mentioned the witch of Endor in his ''[[Traité sur les apparitions des esprits et sur les vampires ou les revenans de Hongrie, de Moravie, &amp;c.]]'' (1759):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Calmet|first1=Augustin|title=[[Traité sur les apparitions des esprits et sur les vampires ou les revenans de Hongrie, de Moravie, &amp;c.|Treatise on the Apparitions of Spirits and on Vampires or Revenants: of Hungary, Moravia, et al. The Complete Volumes I &amp; II.]] 2016|isbn=978-1-5331-4568-0|page=47;237}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The Israelites went sometimes to consult Beelzebub, god of Ekron, to know if they should recover from their sickness. The history of the evocation of Samuel by the witch of Endor is well known. I am aware that some difficulties are raised concerning this history. I shall deduce nothing from it here, except that this woman passed for a witch, that Saul esteemed her such, and that this prince had exterminated the magicians in his own states, or, at least, that he did not permit them to exercise their art.|Calmet, Chapter 7 on Magic}}

{{quote|The Jews of our days  believe that after the body of a man is interred, his spirit goes and comes, and departs from the spot where it is destined to visit his body, and to know what passes around him; that it is wandering during a whole year after the death of the body, and that it was during that year of delay that the Pythoness of Endor evoked the soul of Samuel, after which time the evocation would have had no power over his spirit.|Calmet, Chapter 40}}

===Christianity===
The [[Church Fathers]] and some modern Christian writers have debated the [[Theology|theological]] issues raised by this text. The story of King Saul and the Witch of Endor would appear at first sight to affirm that it is possible (though forbidden) for humans to summon the spirits of the dead by [[magic (paranormal)|magic]].

In the [[Septuagint]] (2nd century BC) the woman is described as a "[[ventriloquist]]",&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Josef Klauck, Brian McNeil ''Magic and paganism in early Christianity: the world of the Acts of the Apostles'' p66 2003 "A classical example is King Saul's visit to the witch of Endor. The Septuagint says once that the seer engages in 'soothsaying' and three times that she engages in 'ventriloquism' (1 Sam 28:6–9)."&lt;/ref&gt; possibly reflecting the consistent view of the Alexandrian translators concerning "[[demons]]... which exist not".&lt;ref&gt;Milian Lauritz Andreasen '' Isaiah the gospel prophet: a preacher of righteousness''  2001 p345"The Septuagint translates: They "burn incense on bricks to devils which exist not."&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Josephus]] (1st century) appears to find the story completely credible (''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' 6,14).
[[File:Witch of Endor (Nikolay Ge).jpg|right|thumb|''Witch of Endor'' by [[Nikolai Ge]], 1857.]]

[[James VI and I|King James]] wrote in his philosophical treatise [[Daemonologie]] (1597) arguing against the ventriloquist theory, stating that the Devil is permitted at times to put himself in the likeness of the Saints, citing 2 Corinthians 11:14 that ''Satan can transform himself into an Angel of light''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=King James|title=Annotated [[Daemonologie]]. A Critical Edition. In Modern English. 2016|pages=9–10|isbn=1-5329-6891-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; James describes the witch of Endor as ''"Saul's Pythonese"'', likening her to [[Pythia]] from the Greek mythology of Python and the Oracle. It was the belief of James that the witch of Endor was an avid practitioner of necromancy:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=King James|title=Annotated [[Daemonologie]]. A Critical Edition. In Modern English. 2016|page=9|isbn=1-5329-6891-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 {{quote|''"...that how soon that once the unclean spirit was fully risen, she called in upon Saul. For it is said in the text, that Saul knew him to be Samuel, which could not have been, by the hearing tell only of an old man with a mantle...But to prove this my first proposition, that there can be such a thing as witchcraft, &amp; witches, there are many more places in the Scriptures than this (as I said before). As first in the law of God, it is plainly prohibited: (Exod. 22.) But certain it is, that the Law of God speaks nothing in vain, neither does it lay curses, or enjoin punishments upon shadows, condemning that to be ill, which is not in essence or being as we call it."''|Epistemon; [[Daemonologie]], Chapter 1}}

Other medieval [[glosses to the Bible]] also suggested that what the witch summoned was not the ghost of Samuel, but a [[demon]] taking his shape or an illusion crafted by the witch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10735a.htm|encyclopedia=Catholic Encyclopedia|title=Necromancy|accessdate=5 Sep 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Luther]], who believed that the dead were unconscious, read that it was "the Devil's ghost", whereas [[John Calvin]]  read that "it was not the real Samuel, but a spectre."&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Buckley. ''Faith Healing, Christian Science and Kindred Phenomena''. p. 221 2003, "The witch of Endor – The account of the "Witch of Endor is the only instance in the Bible where a description of the processes and ... Luther held that it was "the Devil's ghost"; Calvin that "it was not the real Samuel, but a spectre. "&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spiritualism===
[[Spiritualists]] have taken the story as evidence of spirit [[mediumship]] in ancient times. The story has been cited in debates between Spiritualist apologists and Christian critics. "The woman of Endor was a medium, respectable, honest, law-abiding, and far more Christ-like than" Christian critics of Spiritualism, asserted one Chicago Spiritualist paper in 1875.&lt;ref&gt;"The Religion of Ghosts." ''Spiritualist At Work'', Vol. 1, No. 19. April 24, 1875. (Chicago.) p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The pagans thought much in the same manner upon it. Lucan introduces Pompey, who consults a witch, and commands her to evoke the soul of a dead man to reveal to him what success he would meet with in his war against Cæsar; the poet makes this woman say, "Shade, obey my spells, for I evoke not a soul from gloomy Tartarus, but one which hath gone down thither a little while since, and which is still at the gate of hell.}}

[[File:Tesla Broadcast Tower 1904.jpeg|300px|thumb|right|The [[Wardenclyffe Tower|Wardenclyffe Power Plant]] prototype, intended by Nikola Tesla to be a "World Wireless" telecommunications facility.]]

The '''World Wireless System''' was a turn of the 20th century proposed telecommunications and electrical power delivery system designed by inventor [[Nikola Tesla]] based on his theories of using [[Earth]] and its atmosphere as electrical conductors. He claimed this system would allow for "the transmission of electric energy without wires" on a global scale&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tfcbooks.com/tesla/1904-03-05.htm |title=The Transmission of Electric Energy Without Wires," Electrical World, March 5, 1904 |publisher=21st Century Books |date=5 March 1904 |accessdate=4 June 2009}}."&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Point-to-point (telecommunications)|point-to-point]] wireless telecommunications and [[broadcasting]]. He made public statements citing two related methods to accomplish this from the mid-1890s on. By the end of 1900 he had convinced banker [[J. P. Morgan]] to finance construction of a wireless station (eventually sited at [[Wardenclyffe Tower|Wardenclyffe]]) based on his ideas intended to transmit messages across the Atlantic to [[England]] and to ships at sea. His decision to change the design to include [[Wireless energy transfer|wireless power transmission]] to better compete with [[Guglielmo Marconi]]'s new radio based telegraph system was met with Morgan's refusal to fund the changes. The project was abandoned in 1906, never to become operational.

During this period Tesla filed numerous patents associated with the basic functions of his system, including transformer design, transmission methods, tuning circuits, and methods of signaling. He also described a plan to have some thirty Wardenclyffe-style telecommunications stations positioned around the world to be tied into existing telephone and telegraph systems. He would continue to elaborate to the press and in his writings for the next few decades on the system's capabilities and how it was superior to radio-based systems.

Despite claims of having "carried on practical experiments in wireless transmission",&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Electrocraft. Volume 6. 1910, p. 389&lt;/ref&gt; there is no documentation he ever transmitted power beyond relatively short distances and modern scientific opinion is generally that his wireless power scheme would not have worked.

===Origins===
Tesla's ideas for a World Wireless system grew out of experiments beginning in the early 1890s after learning of Hertz's experiments with electromagnetic waves using induction coil transformers and spark gaps.&lt;ref&gt;James O'Neill, Prodigal Genius: The Life of Nikola Tesla, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marc Seifer, Wizard: The Life and Times of Nikola Tesla. p. 1721&lt;/ref&gt; He duplicated those experiments and then went on to improve Hertz's wireless transmitter, developing various [[alternator|alternator apparatus]] and his own high tension transformer, known as the [[Tesla coil]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Nikola_Tesla Nikola Tesla]". ieeeghn.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|447921}}, Tesla, Nikola, "Alternating Electric Current Generator".&lt;/ref&gt; His primary interest in wireless phenomenon was as a power distribution system, early on pursuing wireless lighting.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=N2rNO6FX8o4C&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=hertz+many+published+results+interested+in+radio&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0KwXUu7aJpfH4APG6IFA&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=hertz%20many%20published%20results%20interested%20in%20radio&amp;f=false Radio: Brian Regal, The Life Story of a Technology, p. 22]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1891 on Tesla was delivering lectures including "''[[s:Experiments with Alternate Currents of High Potential and High Frequency|Experiments with Alternate Currents of High Potential and High Frequency]]''" in 1892 in London and in Paris and went on to demonstrate "wireless lighting"&lt;ref&gt;W. Bernard Carlson, Tesla: Inventor of the Electrical Age, Princeton University Press. 2013, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; in 1893&lt;ref&gt;note: at [[St. Louis, Missouri]], Tesla public demonstration called, "[[s:On Light and Other High Frequency Phenomena|On Light and Other High Frequency Phenomena]]", Journal of the Franklin Institute, Volume 136 By Persifor Frazer, Franklin Institute (Philadelphia, Pa)&lt;/ref&gt; including lighting [[Geissler tube]]s wirelessly.

====One-wire transmission====
The first experiment was the operation of light and [[Motion (physics)|motive]] devices connected by a single wire to one terminal of a high frequency [[induction coil]], performed during the 1891 New York City lecture at [[Columbia College, Columbia University|Columbia College]]. While a single terminal [[incandescent lamp]] connected to one of an induction coil’s secondary terminals does not form a [[Electric circuit|closed circuit]] "in the ordinary acceptance of the term"&lt;ref name="Martin_1893"&gt;Martin, Thomas Commerford, "The Inventions, Researches and Writings of Nikola Tesla", ''The Electrical Engineer,'' New York, 1894; "On Light and Other High Frequency Phenomena," February 24, 1893, before the [[Franklin Institute]], [[Philadelphia]], March 1893, before the [[National Electric Light Association]], [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]].&lt;/ref&gt; the circuit is closed in the sense that a return path is established back to the secondary by [[electrostatic induction|capacitive coupling]] or '[[displacement current]]'. This is due to the lamp’s filament or refractory button [[capacitance]] relative to the coil’s free terminal and environment; the free terminal also has capacitance relative to the lamp and environment.

====Wireless transmission====
The second result demonstrated how energy can be made to go through space without any connecting wires. The wireless energy transmission effect involves the creation of an electric field between two metal plates, each being connected to one terminal of an induction coil’s secondary winding. A [[gas discharge]] tube was used as a means of detecting the presence of the transmitted energy. Some demonstrations involved lighting of two partially evacuated tubes in an alternating electrostatic field while held in the hand of the experimenter.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Thomas Commerford, "The Inventions, Researches and Writings of Nikola Tesla", ''The Electrical Engineer,'' New York, 1894; "Experiments With Alternating Currents of Very High Frequency, and Their Application to Methods of Artificial Illumination," AIEE, Columbia College, N.Y., May 20, 1891.&lt;/ref&gt;

While formulating his theories in the early 1890s Tesla discarded the idea of using radio waves.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[https://earlyradiohistory.us/tesla.htm earlyradiohistory.us, Thomas H. White, Nikola Tesla: The Guy Who DIDN'T "Invent Radio", November 1, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; He did not necessarily believe that radio waves existed as theorized by Maxwell,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Century"&gt;[https://teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla/articles/problem-increasing-human-energy, Nikola Tesla, The Problem of Increasing Human Energy, June 1, 1900]&lt;/ref&gt; and he agreed with what most physicists were saying at the time: that radio waves would travel in a [[rectilinear propagation|straight line]] in the same way that visible light travels, limiting their use for long-range communication.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Regal, Radio: The Life Story of a Technology, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; (Radio waves do travel in a straight line, but this was many years before the discovery that the [[ionosphere]] would reflect certain radio waves making [[skywave]] communication of shortwave frequency bands possible over long distances.)

He believed that transmitting electrical signals beyond a line-of-sight distance would require the use of planet Earth as a conducting medium to overcome this limitation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; By the end of 1895, he made statements to the press about the possibility that "''Earth's electrical charge can be disturbed, and thereby electrical waves can be efficiently transmitted to any distance without the use of cables or wires''", and that the electrical waves can be used to transmit "''intelligible signals''" and "''motive power''."&lt;ref&gt;"Tesla on Electricity Without Wires," ''Electrical Engineer''  N.Y., Jan 8, 1896, p. 52. (Refers to letter by Tesla in the ''New York Herald'', 12/31/1895.)&lt;/ref&gt; On April 11, 1896, he stated that "''messages might be conducted to all parts of the globe simultaneously''" using electric waves "''propagated through the atmosphere and even the ether beyond''."&lt;ref&gt;Mining &amp; Scientific Press, "Electrical Progress" Nikola Tesla Is Credited With Statement", April 11, 1896&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1897 he applied for a patent&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Patents number 645,576 and 649,621&lt;/ref&gt; on a wireless power transmission scheme consisting of transmitting power between two tethered balloons maintained at 30,000 feet, an altitude where he thought a conductive layer should exist.&lt;ref name="Carol Dommermuth-Costa 1994, page 85-86"&gt;Carol Dommermuth-Costa, Nikola Tesla: A Spark of Genius, Twenty-First Century Books, 1994, pp. 85–86&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1895 and 1898, he constructed a large resonance transformer in his [[New York City]] lab called a [[magnifying transmitter]] to test his earth conduction theories.&lt;ref name="My Inventions"&gt;''My Inventions: The Autobiography of Nikola Tesla'', Hart Brothers, 1982, Ch. 5, {{ISBN|0-910077-00-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1899 he carried out large scale experiments at [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]]. Based on his measurements there, he concluded that the Earth was "''literally alive with electrical vibrations.''" He noted that lightning strikes indicate that the Earth is a large conductor with waves of energy traveling around the Earth. He constructed a large magnifying transmitter measuring {{convert|51|ft|m|spell=in}} in diameter which could develop a working potential estimated at 3.5 million to 4 million volts and was capable of producing electrical discharges exceeding {{convert|100|ft|m|spell=in}} in length.&lt;ref&gt;''Nikola Tesla: Guided Weapons &amp; Computer Technology'', Leland I. Anderson, 21st Century Books, 1998, pp. 12–13, {{ISBN|0-9636012-9-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; With it he tested earth conduction and lit incandescent electric lamps adjacent to his lab in demonstrations of wireless power transmission.

Upon returning to [[New York City]] from Colorado Springs in 1900 he sought venture capitalists to fund what he viewed as a revolutionary wireless communication and electric power delivery system using the [[Earth]] as the conductor. By the end of 1900 he had gained the attention of financier [[J. P. Morgan]] who agreed to fund a pilot project (later to become the [[Wardenclyffe Tower|Wardenclyffe project]]) which, based on his theories, would be capable of transmitting messages, [[telephony]], and even [[Fax|facsimile images]] across the Atlantic to [[England]] and to ships at sea. Morgan was to receive a controlling share in the company as well as half of all the patent income. Almost as soon as the contract was signed Tesla decided to scale up the facility to include his ideas of terrestrial [[Wireless energy transfer|wireless power transmission]] to better compete with [[Guglielmo Marconi]]'s radio based telegraph system.&lt;ref name="teslatech.info"&gt;[http://teslatech.info/ttmagazine/v4n1/seifer.htm Marc J. Seifer, Nikola Tesla: The Lost Wizard, from: ExtraOrdinary Technology (Volume 4, Issue 1; Jan/Feb/Mar 2006)]&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan refused to fund the changes and, when no additional investment capital became available, the project at Wardenclyffe was abandoned in 1906, never to become operational.

Construction of the Wardenclyffe "wireless plant" in [[Shoreham, New York|Shoreham]] started towards the end of 1901 and continued for the next three years. The plant included a [[Stanford White]] designed {{convert|94|by|94|ft|m|abbr=on}} brick building, a wood-framed tower {{convert|186|ft|m}} tall with a {{convert|68|ft|m}} in diameter "cupola" on top, and a {{convert|120|ft|m}} shaft sunk into the ground with sixteen iron pipes driven "one length after another" {{convert|300|ft|m}} below the shaft in order for the machine, in Tesla's words, "to have a grip on the earth so the whole of this globe can quiver."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tfcbooks.com/tesla/nt_on_ac.htm ''Nikola Tesla On His Work With Alternating Currents and Their Application to Wireless Telegraphy, Telephony, and Transmission of Power''], {{ISBN|1-893817-01-6}}, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Cheney, Robert Uth, Jim Glenn, Tesla, Master of Lightning, Barnes &amp; Noble Publishing. 1999, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; Funding problems continued to plague Wardenclyffe and by 1905-1906 most of the site's activity had to be shut down.

==Elements==
[[File:US patent 1119732 Nikola Tesla 1907 Apparatus for transmitting electrical energy.png|thumb|240px|left|Tesla's basic patent drawing for the grounded resonance transformer used at Wardenclyffe&lt;br&gt;{{US patent|1119732}}]]

Through the latter part of the 1890s and during the construction of Wardenclyffe, Tesla applied for patents covering the many elements that would make up his wireless system. The system he came up with was based on electrical conduction with an electrical charge being conducted through the ground and as well as through a theorized conducting layer in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="W. Bernard Carlson 2013, page 210"&gt;W. Bernard Carlson, Tesla: Inventor of the Electrical Age, Princeton University Press. 2013, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3W6_h6XG6VAC&amp;pg=PA106 Margaret Cheney, Robert Uth, Jim Glenn, Tesla, Master of Lightning, Barnes &amp; Noble Publishing. 1999, p. 106]&lt;/ref&gt; The design consisted of a grounded [[Tesla coil]] as a resonance transformer transmitter that he thought would be able to create a displacement of Earth's electric charge by alternately charging and discharging the oscillator's elevated terminal. This would work in conjunction with a second Tesla coil used in receive mode at a distant location, also with a grounded helical resonator and an elevated terminal.&lt;ref&gt;Seifer, Marc J., ''Wizard: The Life and Times of Nikola Tesla''. p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="US0645576" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tesla, Nikola, "[[s:The True Wireless|The True Wireless]]". ''[[Electrical Experimenter]]'', May 1919. ([https://www.pbs.org/tesla/res/res_art06.html Available at pbs.org])&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that the placement of a grounded resonance transformer at another point on the Earths surface in the role of a receiver tuned to the same frequency as the transmitter would allow electric current to flow through the Earth between the two. He also believed waves of electric current from the sending tower could be made to reflect back from the far side of the globe, resulting in amplified stationary waves of electric current that could be utilized at any point on the globe, localizing power delivery directly to the receiving station. Another aspect of his system was electricity returned via "an equivalent electric displacement""&lt;ref&gt;Ratzlaff, John T., ''Tesla Said'', Tesla Book Company, 1984; "The Disturbing Influence of Solar Radiation On the Wireless Transmission of Energy," ''Electrical Review and Western Electrician'', July 6, 1912&lt;/ref&gt; in the atmosphere via a charged conductive upper layer that he thought existed,&lt;ref name="Carol Dommermuth-Costa 1994, page 85-86"/&gt;&lt;ref name="W. Bernard Carlson 2013, page 210"/&gt; a theory dating back to an 1872 idea for a proposed wireless transmission-reception system developed by [[Mahlon Loomis]].&lt;ref name="earlyradiohistory.us"&gt;[https://earlyradiohistory.us/tesla.htm Thomas H. White, Nikola Tesla: The Guy Who DIDN'T "Invent Radio",earlyradiohistory.us, November 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; The current could be used at the receiver for telecommunications and to drive electrical devices.&lt;ref name="US0645576"&gt;Ratzlaff, John T., ''Dr. Nikola Tesla&amp;nbsp;Complete Patents''; ''System of Transmission of Electrical Energy'', September 2, 1897, {{US patent|645576}}, March 20, 1900.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tesla told a friend his plans included the building of more than thirty transmission-reception stations constructed near major population centers around the world&lt;ref&gt;Seifer, Marc J., ''Wizard: The Life and Times of Nikola Tesla''. p. 472. (''cf''. "Each tower could act as a sender or a receiver.&amp;nbsp;In a letter to Katherine Johnson, he explains the need for well over thirty such towers".)&lt;/ref&gt; with Wardenclyffe being the first. If plans had moved forward without interruption the Long Island prototype would have been followed by a second plant built in the British Isles, perhaps on the west coast of Scotland near Glasgow. Each of these facilities was to include a large [[magnifying transmitter]] of a design loosely based upon the apparatus assembled at the Colorado Springs experimental station in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;''Nikola Tesla On His Work with Alternating Currents and Their Application to wireless Telegraphy, Telephony, and Transmission of Power'', 21st Century Books, 2002, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Claimed applications==
[[File:Future Tesla wireless power transmitter.jpg|thumb|240px|right|1925 artist's conception of what Tesla's wireless power transmission system might look like in the future, powering aircraft and lighting the city in the background.]]
Tesla's description of his wireless transmission ideas in 1895 include its humanitarian uses in bringing abundant electrical energy to remote underdeveloped parts of the world and fostering closer communications amongst nations.&lt;ref&gt;Nikola Tesla, "Letter: Electricity Without Wires", ''New York Herald'', 01/01/1896&lt;/ref&gt; His June, 1900 [[Century Magazine]] article "''The Problem of Increasing Human Energy''", he elaborated on the properties of the Earth and on the principles of a system, which could use the Earth as the medium for communication and the transmission of power without wires. He wrote that communications at any distance was practicable. He also noted this same process could be used to locate maritime objects such as icebergs or ships at sea and that "electrical movement of such magnitude" could communicate with other planets.&lt;ref name ="Century" /&gt;

In 1909 Tesla stated:

:"''It will soon be possible, for instance, for a business man in New York to dictate instructions and have them appear instantly in type in London or elsewhere. He will be able to call up from his desk and talk with any telephone subscriber in the world. It will only be necessary to carry an inexpensive instrument not bigger than a watch, which will enable its bearer to hear anywhere on sea or land for distances of thousands of miles. One may listen or transmit speech or song to the uttermost parts of the world.''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-rise-and-fall-of-nikola-tesla-and-his-tower-11074324/?no-ist Gilbert King, The Rise and Fall of Nikola Tesla and his Tower, smithsonian.com, February 4, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=nN8DAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA476&amp;vq=tesla&amp;pg=PA476#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Wireless of the Future, Popular Mechanics Oct 1909]&lt;/ref&gt;

He also believed that high potential electric current flowing through the upper atmosphere could make it glow, providing night time lighting for transoceanic shipping lanes.&lt;ref name="earlyradiohistory.us"/&gt;

He elaborated on World Wireless in his 1919 ''Electrical Experimenter'' article titled "''[[s:The True Wireless|The True Wireless]],''" detailing its ability for long range telecommunications and putting forward his view that the prevailing theory of radio wave propagation was inaccurate.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Malanowski, The Race for Wireless, AuthorHouse. 2011, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

:"''The Hertz wave theory of wireless transmission may be kept up for a while, but I do not hesitate to say that in a short time it will be recognized as one of the most remarkable and inexplicable aberrations of the scientific mind which has ever been recorded in history.''"

==Feasibility==
Tesla's demonstrations of wireless power transmission at Colorado Springs consisted of lighting incandescent electric lamps positioned nearby the structure housing his large experimental magnifying transmitter,&lt;ref&gt;, recorded in "The Problem of Increasing Human Energy" article published in Century Magazine, June 1900&lt;/ref&gt; with ranges out to {{convert|1,938|ft|m}} from the transmitter.&lt;ref name="Marinčić_2008" /&gt; There is little direct evidence of his having transmitted power beyond these photographically documented demonstrations.&lt;ref name="Carlson"&gt;{{cite book

There have been varied claims over the years regarding Tesla's accomplishments with his wireless system. His own notes from Colorado Springs are unclear as to whether he was ever successful at long range transmission.&lt;ref name="Cheney-Uth"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cheney|first1=Margaret|last2=Uth|first2=Robert|last3=Glenn|first3=Jim|title=Tesla, Master of Lightning|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble Publishing|date=1999|pages=90–92|language=English|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3W6_h6XG6VAC&amp;pg=PA92#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=0760710058}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla made a claim in a 1916 statement to attorney Drury W.

'''''Wrestling Reality''''' was a documentary television series created by independent filmmaker [[Greg Hemmings]], airing on [[The Fight Network]]. It followed the lives of a group of independent [[professional wrestler]]s in the Maritime provinces of Canada. The series consisted of a half-hour documentary portion, as well as an hour of televised matches and shoot interviews. A sneak peek of the premiere episode aired September 25, 2007, with the full series then airing in early November. The series tackled many behind-the-scenes issues in professional wrestling including drugs, [[steroid]]s, and sex. The colour commentary and play-by-play was provided by [[CIJK-FM|89.3 K-Rock]] announcer/[[Eastlink TV|Eastlink]] host Darrin Harvey. The show also airs in the United Kingdom on [[TWC Fight!]].

|{{sort|Steele Brody|[[Brody Steele]]}}
|
|
|At 6'8" and 325&amp;nbsp;lbs he is the biggest wrestler on the crew. Steele is known as the ring general of the group, with a quick temper but a big heart inside his tough exterior. He is also the most experienced, having traveled all over the world to wrestle.  Brody is not afraid to be hard on the younger wrestlers on the crew.
|-
|{{sort|Canyon Trash|Trash Canyon}}
|
|
|The least experienced of the main 4 guys, but what he lacks in experience and in ring ability he well makes up for with his charisma, hard work, and determination.  Some wrestlers with more experience are a little jealous of Trash, feeling that he has not paid his dues to be in the position he is within the company.  While he might not have a lot of wrestling experience, Trash has an excellent mind for business and without him kicking down doors left and right it is unlikely the project would have ever gotten off the ground.
|-
|{{sort|Williams Gary|[[Gary Williams (wrestler)|"Wildman" Gary Williams]]}}
|
|
|While his in ring persona is "The Wildman" outside of the ring he is pretty much the mother hen of the crew, making sure everyone is taking care of and being the nice guy. It has been said on more than one occasion that Gary is probably the nicest guy in professional wrestling.  On top of that after training with wrestling Legends [[Leo Burke]] and [[Bret Hart]], Gary is known as one of the top wrestlers in Canada.  He also runs his own wrestling school, [[Wildman Academy]] a couple of Gary's top students are also featured on the show.  He also has his own band, [[Dead Reach]] formerly known as Tormented.
|-
|{{sort|Hughes Mike|[[Mike Hughes (wrestler)|"Kowboy" Mike Hughes]]}}
|
|
|"Kowboy" brings a lot to the group including in ring talent, charisma, and controversy.  The show tackles a situation that came up between Mike and Brody Steele a few years back that caused their close friendship to come to an abrupt end.  Mike has gained a reputation as guy that tells some tall tales, and it has somewhat alienated himself from some of his closest friends in the wrestling business over the last few years.

|An up and comer who seems to have everything it takes, except the right attitude.  He claims his role on the series to be "the young guy who does narcotics", but this does not sit well with the higher-ups in the promotion as they feel he is not taking his job seriously.
|-

|
|
|Krysta is about as passionate about the wrestling business as one can get, and finds herself increasingly frustrated at the limitations of her partner due to an old knee injury.  Krysta must also deal with her ex-boyfriend on the tour, a fellow Wildman Academy graduate, [[Tommy Ozbourne]].  At the time of the tour they had been broken up a few months and hadn't spoken at all, which made for some awkward situations.
|-
|{{sort|Ozbourne Tommy|[[Tommy Ozbourne]]}}
|
|
|As if dealing with his ex-girlfriend wasn't hard enough, Ozbourne is struggling with his decision to put wrestling on the backburner in favor of a career in MMA. It becomes obvious that he is not comfortable being put in a high spot on the card when he plans to leave wrestling behind and there are so many guys out there that would kill to have his spot. However because of his natural in-ring ability, no one is quite sure how he'll stand once the tour is over.

[[File:Xocomil2.jpg|right|300px]]
'''Xocomil''' is a [[water park]] in [[Guatemala]]. It is located in the [[Retalhuleu Department]] in the southwest of the country.

It is the largest and most-visited water amusement park in the country. The park covers an area of  77,300 m³ and is thematically designed around a recreation of a [[Mayan pyramid]].

The park contains four different pools and two different wave pools, one for children and one for adults. It also features different kinds of waves and a beach designed resting area as well as the Tumala river tube and the "Rapidos de Xocomil" which features five different options of speed slides in a 148 m ride. Other attractions include the "El Caracol" which takes riders through a dark tunnel that propels them into a big funnel and "Nido de Serpientes" which has 7 different courses of twisting flumes. Along most of the tubes are items such as Mayan masks and items which represent Guatemala's Mayan heritage.
