      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1346">The '''Administrative Court''' is a specialist court within the [[Queen's Bench Division]] of the [[High Court of Justice]] of England and Wales. It deals mainly with administrative law matters and exercises the High Court's supervisory jurisdiction over inferior courts and tribunals and other public bodies (exercised mainly through the procedure known as "[[judicial review in English Law|judicial review]]").

The Administrative Court may sit with a single judge or as a [[Divisional Court]] (i.e. with two or more judges). A Divisional Court of the Administrative Court usually consists of a [[Lord Justice of Appeal]] sitting with a [[High Court judge (England and Wales)|judge of the High Court]]. Although the Administrative Court is within the Queen's Bench Division (reflecting the historical role of the [[Court of Queen's Bench]] in exercising judicial review), judges from the [[Chancery Division]] and the [[Family Division]] of the High Court are also assigned to sit.

'''Assault weapons legislation in the United States''' refers to [[Bill (law)|bill]]s and [[Law of the United States|law]]s (active, expired, proposed or failed) that define and restrict or make illegal the manufacture, transfer, and possession of [[assault weapon]]s. How these firearms are defined and regulated varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.

The Federal Assault Weapons Ban enacted in 1994 expired in 2004. Attempts to renew this ban have failed, as have attempts to pass a new ban, such as the [[Assault Weapons Ban of 2013]] (AWB 2013). Seven U.S. states have assault weapons bans: three were enacted before the 1994 federal ban and four more passed before the federal ban expired.  The majority of states, forty-three, have no assault weapons ban, although two, [[Minnesota]] and [[Virginia]], have training and background check requirements for purchasers of assault weapons that are more stringent than those for ordinary firearms.  While there are no statewide assault weapon bans in [[Colorado]] and [[Illinois]], local bans exist in certain cities or counties in each of these states. In 2018, most Americans supported a ban on assault weapons, according to polls.&lt;ref name=politico20180228&gt;{{cite news |title=Gun control support surges in polls |first=Steven |last=Shepard |date=February 28, 2018 |publisher=[[Politico]] |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/28/gun-control-polling-parkland-430099 |accessdate=March 19, 2018|quote=Seventy percent of voters support a ban on high-capacity magazines, and 68 percent want to ban assault-style weapons.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=npr20180302&gt;{{cite news |title=NPR Poll: After Parkland, Number of Americans Who Want Gun Restrictions Grows |date=March 2, 2018 |first=Asma |last=Khalid |url=https://www.npr.org/2018/03/02/589849342/npr-poll-after-parkland-number-of-americans-who-want-gun-restrictions-grows |accessdate=March 19, 2018 |agency=[[NPR]] |work=[[Morning Edition]] |quote=Eight-in-10 Americans told the pollsters they favor bans on assault weapons, high-capacity ammunition magazines and "bump stocks," an accessory used by the Las Vegas shooter that allows a semi-automatic rifle to fire like an automatic weapon.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=qu20180220&gt;{{cite news |date=February 20, 2018 |title=U.S. Support For Gun Control Tops 2-1, Highest Ever, Quinnipiac University National Poll Finds |url=https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2521 |agency=[[Quinnipiac University Polling Institute]] |accessdate=March 20, 2018 |quote=Support for gun control on other questions is at its highest level since the Quinnipiac University Poll began focusing on this issue in the wake of the Sandy Hook massacre: 67 - 29 percent for a nationwide ban on the sale of assault weapons; 83 - 14 percent for a mandatory waiting period for all gun purchases.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1994 federal and 1989 state ban in California were prompted by the 1989 [[Cleveland Elementary School shooting (Stockton)|Cleveland Elementary School shooting]] in Stockton, California. Existing and proposed weapon bans come under renewed interest in the wake of [[mass shooting]]s, most recently after the December 2012 [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]] in Newtown, Connecticut. In addition to state bans, [[Washington, D.C.]] and some U.S. counties and municipalities have assault weapons laws.

In November 1993 the ban passed the [[United States Senate]]. The author of the ban, [[Dianne Feinstein]] D-CA, and other advocates said that it was a weakened version of the original proposal.&lt;ref name="Bunting 931109"&gt;{{cite news |title=Feinstein Faces Fight for Diluted Gun Bill |first=Glenn F. |last=Bunting |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-11-09/news/mn-54844_1_assault-weapon |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=November 9, 1993 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314032536/http://articles.latimes.com/1993-11-09/news/mn-54844_1_assault-weapon |archivedate=March 14, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1994 [[Josh Sugarmann]], executive director of the [[Violence Policy Center]], said handguns and assault weapons should be banned.&lt;ref name="Sugarmann MotherJones9401"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sugarmann |first=Josh |date=January 1994 |title=Reverse FIRE: The Brady Bill won't break the sick hold guns have on America.

The Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act, commonly called the federal [[Federal Assault Weapons Ban|Assault Weapons Ban]] (AWB and AWB 1994), was enacted in September 1994. The ban, including a ban on [[high-capacity magazine]]s, became defunct (expired) in September 2004 per a 10-year [[sunset provision]].{{cn|date=June 2018}}

The proposed legislation targets various firearm accessories, including the [[barrel shroud]] (a safety covering for the barrel of the firearm to prevent the operator from burning his or her hands as the barrel becomes heated after the firing of multiple rounds), [[pistol grip]], and certain types of firearm [[stocks]] such as telescoping or collapsing stocks.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Also included are lists of various classes and models of firearms, including [[semi-automatic firearm]]s, [[AR-15 style rifle]]s, [[assault weapons]], [[semi-automatic pistols]], [[semi-automatic shotguns]], and others, some of which have already been banned or restricted under existing legislation including [[grenade launcher]]s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The legislation also proscribes [[high-capacity magazine]]s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

*Lawfully possessed the assault weapon prior to October 1, 1993; and
*Is not in violation of Connecticut General Statutes §§ 53-202a to 53-202k (assault weapon regulations), and Connecticut General Statutes § 53-202o (affirmative defense in prosecution for possession of specified assault weapon). It also prohibits any person from distributing, transporting, importing into the state, keeping, offering or exposing for sale, or giving an assault weapon to any person.&lt;ref name="SGLAW-CT"/&gt;

Connecticut defines an "assault weapon" as:
*Any "selective-fire" firearm capable of fully automatic, semi-automatic or "burst fire" at the option of the user;

Connecticut also bans listed makes and models of semiautomatic firearms and copies of those firearms. [[Grandfather clause]]s and other exceptions apply, depending.&lt;ref name="SGLAW-CT"/&gt;

===Hawaii===
{{See also|Gun laws in Hawaii}}
Hawaiian law bans the manufacture, possession, sale or other transfer of what it defines as assault [[pistol]]s. Hawaii defines an "assault pistol" as a semiautomatic handgun that accepts a detachable magazine and that has two or more of: 
*An ammunition [[Magazine (firearms)|magazine]] that attaches to the pistol outside of the pistol grip; 
*A threaded barrel capable of accepting a barrel extender, flash [[suppressor]], forward hand grip, or silencer; 
*A [[Barrel shroud|shroud]] that is attached to or partially or completely encircles the barrel and that permits the shooter to hold the firearm with the second hand without being burned; 
*A manufactured weight of 50 ounces or more when the pistol is unloaded; 
*A [[Centerfire ammunition|centerfire]] pistol with an overall length of 12 inches or more; or 
*A semiautomatic version of an automatic firearm.&lt;ref name="SGLAW-HI"/&gt;
In tandem with the assault pistol ban is a law that bans the manufacture, possession, sale or other transfer of detachable ammunition magazines with capacities greater than 10 rounds that are capable of use with a pistol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://smartgunlaws.org/large-capacity-ammunition-magazines-in-hawaii/ |title=Large Capacity Ammunition Magazines in Hawaii |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=January 2, 2012 |website=smartgunlaws.org |publisher=Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence |accessdate=April 28, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140802165809/http://smartgunlaws.org/large-capacity-ammunition-magazines-in-hawaii/ |archivedate=August 2, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maryland===
{{See also|Gun laws in Maryland}}

Maryland's definition of an "assault long gun" includes a list of 45 specific firearms or their copies, with certain variations. Maryland's definition of an "assault pistol" includes a list of 15 specific firearms or their copies, with certain variations. Maryland also defines an assault weapon "copycat weapon" as:

The United States Supreme Court refused to hear a challenge to the Maryland ban in November 2017. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit in Richmond had upheld the ban, stating that: "[A]ssault weapons and large-capacity magazines are not protected by the Second Amendment." Attorneys general in 21 states and the NRA had asked the Supreme Court to hear the case.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/supreme-court-wont-review-marylands-law-banning-sales-of-assault-weapons/2017/11/27/ad68ce42-d380-11e7-95bf-df7c19270879_story.html Washington Post-Robert Barnes-Supreme Court won’t review Maryland’s law banning sales of ‘assault weapons’-November 27, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Massachusetts===
{{See also|Gun laws in Massachusetts}}
Massachusetts law bans the sale, transfer, or possession of assault weapons not otherwise lawfully possessed on September 13, 1994. Massachusetts defines "assault weapon" by the definition of "semiautomatic assault weapon" in the federal assault weapons ban of 1994. That definition included:
*A list of firearms by name and copies of those firearms; 
*Semi-automatic rifles and pistols capable of accepting a detachable magazine and having at least two specified characteristics; and 
*Semi-automatic shotguns having at least two specified characteristics.&lt;ref name="SGLAW-MA"/&gt;
In tandem with the assault weapons ban is a law that bans the sale, transfer, or possession of a large capacity feeding device unless such device was lawfully possessed on September 13, 1994. The definition of "large capacity feeding device" included: a fixed or detachable magazine, box, drum, feed strip or similar device capable of accepting, or that can be readily converted to accept, more than 10 rounds of ammunition or more than 5 shotgun shells; or a large capacity ammunition feeding device as defined in the federal assault weapons ban of 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://smartgunlaws.org/large-capacity-ammunition-magazines-in-massachusetts/ |title=Large Capacity Ammunition Magazines in Massachusetts |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=January 2, 2012 |website=smartgunlaws.org |publisher=Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence |accessdate=April 28, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140428032811/http://smartgunlaws.org/large-capacity-ammunition-magazines-in-massachusetts/ |archivedate=April 28, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Jersey===
{{See also|Gun laws in New Jersey}}
In May 1990, New Jersey became the second state in the U.S. to pass an assault weapons ban, after California. At the time, it was the toughest assault weapons ban in the nation.&lt;ref name=DePalma900518&gt;{{cite news |last=DePalma |first=Anthony |date=May 18, 1990 |title=New Jersey Votes the Strictest Law In the Nation on Assault Weapons |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/18/nyregion/new-jersey-votes-the-strictest-law-in-the-nation-on-assault-weapons.html |newspaper=New York Times |location= |publisher= |accessdate=April 20, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140423031753/http://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/18/nyregion/new-jersey-votes-the-strictest-law-in-the-nation-on-assault-weapons.html |archivedate=April 23, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[AR-15]] [[semi-automatic rifle]]s are illegal in New Jersey, and owning and publicly carrying other guns require separate licensing processes.&lt;ref name=Record120721&gt;{{cite news |last1=Linhorst |first1=Michael |last2=Connor |first2=Erinn |last3=Fujimori |first3=Sachi |date=July 21, 2012 |title=N.J. law bans assault rifles, restricts other weapons |url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/n-j-law-bans-assault-rifles-restricts-other-weapons-1.391273 |newspaper=The Record |location= |publisher=North Jersey Media Group |accessdate=April 21, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140423045821/http://www.northjersey.com/news/n-j-law-bans-assault-rifles-restricts-other-weapons-1.391273 |archivedate=April 23, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is commonly referred to as an assault weapons ban, New Jersey's law actually uses the term "assault firearm" to define banned and regulated guns. Some New Jersey gun advocates have called its laws "draconian." Attorney Evan Nappen, author of several books on New Jersey gun laws, says the term is "misapplied and carries with it a pejorative meaning."&lt;ref name=Record120721/&gt;

===New York===
{{See also|Gun laws in New York}}
New York law bans the manufacture, transport, disposal or possession of an assault weapon in the state. It defines an "assault weapon" as:
*A semi-automatic rifle or pistol able to accept a detachable magazine and that has at least one from a list of characteristics; 
*A semi-automatic shotgun that has at least one from a list of characteristics; or
*A revolving cylinder shotgun.&lt;ref name="SGLAW-NY"/&gt;
In tandem with the assault weapons ban is a law that bans the manufacture, transport, disposal or possession of a "large capacity ammunition feeding device," defined as: "a magazine, belt, drum, feed strip, or similar device that: 1) has a capacity of, or that can be readily restored or converted to accept, more than ten rounds of ammunition; 2) contains more than seven rounds of ammunition; or 3) is obtained after January 15, 2013 and has a capacity of, or can be readily restored or converted to accept more than seven rounds of ammunition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://smartgunlaws.org/large-capacity-ammunition-magazines-in-new-york/ |title=Large Capacity Ammunition Magazines in New York |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=January 2, 2012 |website=smartgunlaws.org |publisher=Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence |accessdate=April 28, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140309173037/http://smartgunlaws.org/large-capacity-ammunition-magazines-in-new-york/ |archivedate=March 9, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Local assault weapons bans==
Some local governments have laws that ban or restrict the possession of assault weapons.

Laws passed before July 20, 2013 are [[grandfathered]] in, and a number of local governments in the Chicago area have laws that either prohibit or regulate the possession of firearms that they define as assault weapons.&lt;ref&gt;McCoppin, Robert (July 21, 2013).

In March 1989 the Northwest Indiana cities of [[Gary, Indiana|Gary]] and [[East Chicago]] city councils passed ordinances prohibiting both sale and possession of assault weapons. Gary City Councilman [[Vernon G. Smith]] (D-4th) sponsored the ordinance making it a crime to possess or sell assault-type weapons.&lt;ref name=1990PostTrib&gt;{{cite news|last=Staff|title=Assault Weapon Sales Recoil Gary, East Chicago Outlawed Them; None Turned In to Police|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1N1-10852F5F4AD9C3E0.html|accessdate=19 May 2014|newspaper=Post-Tribune (IN) {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|date=January 15, 1990|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924171635/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1N1-10852F5F4AD9C3E0.html|archivedate=24 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both of these ordinances were invalidated under statewide pre-emption legislation enacted by the [[Indiana General Assembly]] and signed into law by Governor [[Mitch Daniels]] in 2011.

==Public opinion==
{{further|Public opinion on gun control in the United States}}

Shortly after the [[2016 Orlando nightclub shooting]], a [[CBS News]] poll found that a majority of Americans (57%) supported a ban on assault weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/orlando-nightclub-massacre-cbs-news-poll-assault-weapons-ban/|title=After Orlando, do Americans support assault weapons ban?|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160708221728/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/orlando-nightclub-massacre-cbs-news-poll-assault-weapons-ban/|archivedate=2016-07-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] noted a similarly high percentage of Americans thought that a ban would be an effective response to terrorism after the [[2015 San Bernardino shooting]] (55%), and in 2013 when the question was put in a referendum format ("Would you vote for or against a law that would reinstate and strengthen the ban on assault weapons that was in place from 1994 to 2004?") (56% support).&lt;ref name="Newport2016"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Newport|first1=Frank|title=American Public Opinion, Terrorism and Guns|url=http://www.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/192695/american-public-opinion-terrorism-guns.aspx|publisher=[[Gallup (company)|Gallup]]|accessdate=6 February 2017|date=13 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206185235/http://www.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/192695/american-public-opinion-terrorism-guns.aspx|archivedate=6 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; But it noted that "Support for stricter gun control laws often rises after high-profile shooting incidents and then often subsides again," and that support for stricter gun controls, although still a majority view, had declined since the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="Newport2016"/&gt; By October 2016, support for an assault weapons ban had fallen to a historical low of 36%.&lt;ref name="Swift2016"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Swift|first1=Art|title=In U.S., Support for Assault Weapons Ban at Record Low|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/196658/support-assault-weapons-ban-record-low.aspx|publisher=[[Gallup (company)|Gallup]]|accessdate=6 February 2017|date=26 October 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205010009/http://www.gallup.com/poll/196658/support-assault-weapons-ban-record-low.aspx|archivedate=5 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Unreferenced|date=May 2018}}
The term ''basic law'' is used in some places as an alternative to "[[constitution]]", implying it is a ''temporary but necessary measure'' without formal enactment of constitution. A basic law is either a [[codified constitution]], or in countries with [[uncodified constitution]]s, a law given to have constitution powers and effect. The name is usually used to imply an interim or transitory nature, or avoid attempting a claim to being "the highest law", often for religious reasons. In [[West Germany]] the term "[[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]]" (''Grundgesetz'') was used to indicate that the Basic Law was provisional until the ultimate [[reunification of Germany]]. But in 1990 no new constitution was adopted and instead the Basic Law was adopted throughout the entire German territory. Basic law is entrenched in that it overrides ordinary 'statute law' passed by the legislature.

The [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|Special Administrative Regions of the People's Republic of China]], namely [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], have basic laws as their constitutional documents. The basic laws are the highest authority, respectively, in the territories, while the rights of amendment and interpretation rest with the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress|Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China]].

== About the Partners ==
Prior to law school, founding partner Alan Brayton graduated from the US Air Force Academy in 1971. In 1972 he received a master's in finance from UCLA, and in 1976 he earned his J.D. from UC Berkeley. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.marinscope.com/archives/al-brayton-to-lead-trial-lawyers-foundation/article_eb8aa8c3-4eef-5f4f-b4f6-70d0abb274be.html|title=Al Brayton to lead trial lawyers' foundation|last=Connell|first=Mary|date=July 27, 2006|work=Marinscope Community Newspapers|access-date=2017-04-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983 founding partner Alan Brayton established the firm. In 1995 senior partner and lead trial counsel Gilbert Purcell joined to name the partnership Brayton Purcell.&lt;ref name="Schuyler 2011 38" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Holley"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northbaybiz.com/General_Articles/General_Articles/35_Years_of_Law.php|title=35 Years of Law|last=Holley|first=Ray|publisher=[[NorthBay biz]]|accessdate=8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2006 Alan Brayton was named president of the Trial Lawyers for Public Justice Foundation. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marinscope.com/archives/al-brayton-to-lead-trial-lawyers-foundation/article_eb8aa8c3-4eef-5f4f-b4f6-70d0abb274be.html|title=Al Brayton to lead trial lawyers' foundation|last=Connell|first=Mary|date=July 27, 2006|website=Marinscope Community Newspapers|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 James Nevin became a member of the American Board of Trial Advocates at the age of 36, making him the youngest ever member.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.plaintiffmagazine.com/images/issues/2015/08-august/reprints/Ellison_Profile_James-Nevin_Plaintiff-magazine.pdf|title=Profile: James Nevin|last=Ellison|first=Stephen|date=August 2005|website=Plaintiff Magazine|access-date=April 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2002 a California jury granted the largest asbestos case award to the plaintiff in a case tried by Brayton Purcell employees. ''Alfred Todak v. Foster Wheeler LLC'' resulted in a $33.7 million verdict for the former Navy electrician and his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.plaintiffmagazine.com/recent-issues/item/profile-alan-brayton|title=Profile: Alan Brayton|last=Ellison|first=Stephen|date=May 2009|website=Plaintiff Magazine|access-date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
In 2007 a judge stated that the law firm "lied to the court, submitted fraudulent asbestos claim forms and broke other rules" in an asbestos-related case.&lt;ref name=Hirsch&gt;{{cite news|last=Hirsch|first=Matthew|title=Judge: Firm Submitted Fraudulent Claim Forms|newspaper=The Legal Intelligencer|date=22 January 2007|url=https://www.law.com/almID/900005472082/|accessdate = 26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, the firm was barred from participating in the rest of the case.&lt;ref name=WSJ&gt;{{cite news|last=Davies|first=Paul|title=Plaintiffs' Team Takes Hit on Asbestos|accessdate=10 October 2013|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=20 January 2007|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB116925263361682103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015 a federal judge in California sanctioned and fined Brayton Purcell partner Gilbert Purcell for lying about witness testimony. Purcell and several other members of his team were fined $250 each. Purcell lied about whether a particular witness would testify about how chemotherapy may have exacerbated his client's kidney problems.&lt;ref name="Koenig"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Koenig|first1=Bryan|title=Atty Sanctioned For Sneaking Evidence In Navy Asbestos Suit|url=https://www.law360.com/articles/660035/atty-sanctioned-for-sneaking-evidence-in-navy-asbestos-suit|accessdate=27 July 2017|publisher=Law360|date=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''constitutional referendum''' was held in [[Burkina Faso]] on 9 June 1991. It followed a military coup in 1980, and would restore multi-party democracy. The new [[Constitution of Burkina Faso|constitution]] retained the [[presidential system]] of government, created a [[bicameralism|bicameral]] parliament, and limited the President to two seven-year terms. It was approved by 92.83% of voters with a 48.8% turnout.&lt;ref name=AED&gt;[http://africanelections.tripod.com/bf.html Elections in Burkina Faso] African Elections Database&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Claude Le Coz''' (1740&amp;ndash;1815) was a French Catholic bishop.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09109c.htm|title=Claude Le Coz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Le Coz was born at [[Plouévez-Parzay]], [[Finistère]].  He was pupil, then professor, and finally principal of the [[Collège de Quimper]]. He took the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy|constitutional oath]] in 1791, was elected [[constitutional bishop]] of [[Ille-et-Vilaine]], and wrote in defence of his election — declared null and void by the pope — "Accord des vrais principes de la morale et de la raison sur la Constitution civile du clergé".

Elected to the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]], he showed courage and ability in defending against the majority Catholic colleges, the ecclesiastical costume, and even Christian marriage. His moderation drew upon him the severity of the Convention, and he spent fourteen months in the prison of [[Mont-Saint-Michel]]. Later, under the Directory, the vigour with which he opposed the substitution of the ''[[decadi]]'' for the Christian Sunday came near causing his deportation.

Under the [[Concordat of 1802]], Le Coz was one of the Constitutional bishops whom the force of circumstances compelled the [[Holy See]] to recognize, and he became [[Archbishop of Besançon]]. [[Bernier]], the ecclesiastical diplomat who negotiated the rehabilitation of the jurors, thought it best, in order to avoid delay, not to make a clear mention of the manner of retractation required by [[Pope Pius VII]]; as a consequence, Le Coz denied ever having retracted, and the awkwardness of the situation was ended only by a personal interview between Le Coz and Pius VII, in which both were seen weeping but of which neither ever spoke.

As schismatic Bishop of Ille-et-Vilaine, Le Coz failed in his endeavour to organize the new province of which he was the metropolitan; otherwise he proved a zealous administrator and a charitable pastor. The strange mixture in Le Coz's life, is partly explained by his intensely [[Gallican]] education, which caused him to adopt and to maintain with obstinacy schismatic views. His Gallicanism, which made him so haughty toward the pope, found him almost cringing before the various political regimes which succeeded one another during his episcopate. Le Coz, even against the all-powerful [[Abbé Grégoire]], defended the cause of religion in the ''Annales de la Religion'', in which he was a collaborator, and in his ''{{lang|fr|Correspondance}}'', part of which has been published. He died at [[Villevieux]], [[Jura (department)|Jura]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17882">'''Coca eradication''' is a strategy promoted by the [[United States]] [[Federal government of the United States|government]] starting in 1961 as part of its "[[War on Drugs]]" to eliminate the cultivation of [[coca]], a plant whose leaves are not only traditionally used by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] cultures but also, in modern society, in the manufacture of [[cocaine]]. The strategy was adopted in place of running educational campaigns against drug usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Webb|first=Gary|year=1999|pp=35|title=[[Dark Alliance]]|publisher=[[Seven Stories Press]]|isbn=978-1-888363-93-7|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[prohibition (drugs)|prohibitionist]] strategy is being pursued in the coca-growing regions of [[Colombia]] ([[Plan Colombia]]), [[Peru]], and formerly [[Bolivia]], where it is highly controversial because of its environmental, health and socioeconomic impact. Furthermore, indigenous cultures living in the ''[[Altiplano]]'', such as the [[Aymara people|Aymara]]s, use the coca leaf (which they dub the "millenary leaf") in many of their cultural traditions, notably for its medicinal qualities in alleviating the feeling of hunger, fatigue and headaches symptomatic of [[altitude sickness]]es. The growers of coca are named ''[[Cocalero]]s'' and part of the coca production for traditional use is legal in Peru, Bolivia and [[Chile]].

==Environmental impact==
Plots denuded of coca plants by mechanical means (burning or cutting) or chemical [[herbicide]]s, such as [[glyphosate]], are abandoned and cause serious problems with [[erosion]] in seasonal rains. Because of the continuous high demand for coca, once a plot is destroyed the planters simply move further into the forest, clearing new lands for coca production. It is this vicious cycle of unsustainable cultivation-eradication that has caused the environment in coca producing zones to suffer substantial decline.

Aerial spraying of glyphosate herbicide, one of the most controversial methods of coca eradication, has taken place in Colombia exclusively because of that government's willingness to cooperate with the United States in the militarized eradication of coca after signing [[Plan Colombia]] in 2000. In many cases the spraying is carried out by American contractors, such as [[DynCorp]], using planes and helicopters to spray glyphosate on coca plantations. Aerial spraying has been repeatedly condemned by human rights and environmental activists because of its effect on human populations and local soil and water systems.  In December 2000, Dutch journalist [[Marjon van Royen]] found that "because the chemical is sprayed in Colombia from planes on inhabited areas, there have been consistent health complaints [in humans]. Burning eyes, dizziness and respiratory problems being most frequently reported." In some areas, 80 percent of the children of the indigenous community fell sick with skin rashes, fever, diarrhoea and eye infections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://marjonvanroyen.nl/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=525&amp;Itemid=46 Driven Mad by Itch], [[NRC Handelsblad]], December 28, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Because the glyphosate is sprayed from the air, there is a much higher chance of human error when spraying suspected illegal coca plantations. In many cases the wrong fields are sprayed, resulting in not only a total loss of the farmer's crop- but the loss of that field altogether as nothing will grow where the herbicide has been sprayed.&lt;ref name="Sue Branford 2005"&gt;Hugh O’Shaughnessy and Sue Branford, Chemical Warfare in Colombia: The Costs of Coca Fumigation (London: Latin America Bureau, 2005.)&lt;/ref&gt; Though official documentation of the health effects of glyphosate spraying in Colombia are virtually non-existent, neighbouring Ecuador has conducted studies to determine the cause of mysterious illnesses amongst people living along the border of Colombia and has since demanded that no aerial sprayings occur within 10&amp;nbsp;km of the border because of the damages caused to the people, animals and environment in that area.&lt;ref name="Sue Branford 2005"/&gt;

In addition, the U.S. has also been involved in the development of the [[fungus]] ''[[Fusarium oxysporum]]'' to wipe out coca.&lt;ref name=vicious&gt;[http://www.tni.org/archives/jelsma/viciouscircle-e.htm Vicious Circle: The Chemical and Biological 'War on Drugs'] report by the Transnational Institute (TNI), March 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dpb7&gt;[http://www.tni.org/detail_page.phtml?page=policybriefings_brief7 The Re-emergence of the Biological War on Drugs], TNI Drug Policy Briefing 7, May 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the [[Congress of the United States]] approved use of ''Fusarium'' as a biological control agent to kill coca crops in Colombia (and another fungus to kill [[opium|opium poppies]] in [[Afghanistan]]), but these plans were canceled by then-President [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]], who was concerned that the unilateral use of a biological agent would be perceived by the rest of the world as [[biological warfare]]. The Andean nations have since banned its use throughout the region. (The use of biological agents to kill crops may be illegal under the [[Biological Weapons Convention]] of 1975.)

On June 25, 2003, the Superior Administrative Court of the Colombian department of [[Cundinamarca Department|Cundinamarca]] ordered a stop to the spraying of [[glyphosate]] herbicides until the government complies with the environmental management plan for the eradication program. It also mandated a series of studies to protect public health and the environment.&lt;ref name=cu&gt;[http://www.colombiaupdate.com/Members/bill/panna/view Colombia Court Nixes Spray Program], Colombia Update&lt;/ref&gt; The Colombian State Council, the country's maximum administrative authority, later overruled the court's decision to stop fumigations.

Recently, [[Boliviana negra]], a glyphosate-resistant type of genetically engineered coca plant has been introduced, which was found to resist glyphosate herbicides as well as have an increased yield.

==Socioeconomic impact==
In the [[wikt:sierra|sierra]] of Peru, Bolivia, and northern [[Argentina]], coca has been consumed (by chewing and brewing in [[infusion]]) for thousands of years as a stimulant and cure for [[altitude sickness]]; it also has symbolic value. The sale and consumption of coca (but not pure cocaine) is legal and legitimate in these countries.

With the growth of the Colombian [[drug cartel]]s in the 1980s, coca leaf became a valuable agricultural commodity, particularly in Peru and Bolivia, where the quality of coca is higher than in Colombia. To supply the foreign markets, the cartels expanded the cultivation to areas where coca was not a traditional crop. Many poor [[Peasant|campesinos]], driven from the central highlands by lack of land or loss of jobs, migrated to the lowlands and valleys of the eastern [[Andes]], where they turned to the cultivation of coca.

To counter this development, the U.S. government, through its foreign aid agency [[USAID]], has promoted a policy of crop substitution, whereby coca cultivation is replaced by [[coffee]], [[banana]], [[pineapple]], [[palm heart]], and other crops suitable for a tropical climate. However; many remote coca-growing areas lack the infrastructure to get such perishable products to market on time. Coca on the other hand stores well and is easily transportable.  The price of coca has remained high and in many cases remains a more attractive crop to farmers than these alternatives.

Despite these obstacles, many farmers have embraced alternative crops. In 2006, Bolivia, as a result of alternative development programs, exported US$28 million of banana, US$1.9 million of pineapple, and US$7.0 million of palm heart.&lt;ref&gt;Bolivian Chamber of Exporters - CAMEX&lt;/ref&gt; These industries now employ more than 20,000 people in the Chapare region.

==Geopolitical issues==
Given the above-mentioned considerations, many critics of coca eradication believe the fundamental goal of the U.S. government is to constrict the flow of income to the Colombian [[Marxist]] rebel movement, [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia|FARC]], which is heavily funded by the illegal drug trade, rather than combating drugs ''per se''. Few if any such critics have anything favorable to say about the illicit drug trade, but they point out that under the current coca eradication policies, poor campesinos bear the brunt of efforts to combat it, while North American and European chemical companies (which supply chemicals needed in the manufacture of cocaine) and banks (which annually [[Money laundering|launder]] hundreds of billions of dollars in illegal revenues) continue to profit from the trade. (Although it should be noted that it is illegal in the United States for banks to hold funds from drug cartels - such as FARC - that have been designated as foreign terrorist organizations.)

[[Wikisource:Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs#Article 26: THE COCA BUSH AND COCA LEAVES|Article 26]] of the [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]], a treaty promulgated with U.S. backing in 1961, states that "The Parties shall so far as possible enforce the uprooting of all coca bushes which grow wild. They shall destroy the coca bushes if illegally cultivated."

The US-based [[Drug Enforcement Administration]], along with local governments, has frequently clashed with ''[[cocaleros]]'' in attempts to eradicate coca across the Andes. This map shows the [[Chapare Province|Chapare]] region in Bolivia, which has historically been heavily targeted for coca eradication. [[Human rights]] [[NGO]]s such as [[Human Rights Watch]] have accused the US of [[human rights abuses]] in the "coca war".&lt;ref name=hrw&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/summaries/s.bolivia957.html Bolivia: Human Rights Violations and the War on Drugs], Human Rights Watch Vol. 7, No. 8 (B), July 1995]&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the US-based [[Stepan Company]] is authorized by the Federal Government to import and process the [[coca]] plant&lt;ref&gt;May, Clifford D. [https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/01/business/how-coca-cola-obtains-its-coca.html "How Coca-Cola Obtains Its Coca"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 1, 1998. Accessed December 4, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; which it obtains mainly from [[Peru]] and, to a lesser extent, [[Bolivia]]. Besides producing the coca flavoring agent for Coca-Cola, [[Stepan Company]] extracts cocaine from the coca leaves, which it sells to [[Mallinckrodt]], a [[St. Louis, Missouri]] [[pharmaceutical]] manufacturer that is the only company in the United States licensed to purify cocaine for medicinal use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Drew |last=Benson |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Coca kick in drinks spurs export fears|url=http://www.mindfully.org/Food/2004/Kdrink-Coca-Drink19apr04.htm |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
At the start of 2003, there were 1,740&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of coca in worldwide cultivation, and Colombia represented more than 60% of that total. Critics of the Colombian eradication program had predicted that it would lead to higher coca production in Peru and Bolivia. However, in November 2003, the US [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]] (ONDCP) claimed the area planted with coca in Peru and Bolivia combined fell by 35&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the year up to June, which would suggest that the crop eradication program in neighboring Colombia had not driven production over the borders. According to ONDCP estimates, the area cultivated with coca in Bolivia rose from 244&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in 2002 to 284.5&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in June 2003, but this increase was more than offset in Peru, where the area fell from 366&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to 311.5&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

The U.S. figures were very different from preliminary estimates in September 2003 by the head of the [[UN Office on Drugs and Crime]] in Colombia, which indicated that output in Peru and Bolivia may have risen by as much 21%, or 150&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; that year. The White House office said its estimate was based on sampling from high resolution satellite imagery. The United Nations used a different technique and had not yet put out any formal estimate for 2003.

A March 2005 report by the [[ONDCP]] indicated that despite record aerial spraying of over 1,300&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of coca in Colombia in 2004, the total area under coca cultivation remained "statistically unchanged" at 1,140&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. In response to the report, the [[Washington Office on Latin America]] (WOLA), an [[non-governmental organization|NGO]] that monitors the impact of US foreign policy in Latin America, observed that the aerial spraying strategy appeared to have hit its limits. According to WOLA, the new ONDCP data suggested a continued "balloon effect" as aggressive spraying in some areas has not deterred new cultivation elsewhere. The WOLA Senior Associate for Drug Policy commented, "The stable cultivation in 2004 throws into doubt US officials’ predictions of a major impact on US drug prices and purity." Regardless, Colombian President [[Álvaro Uribe]] vowed to press ahead with the U.S.-financed fumigation of coca crops.&lt;ref name=wola310303&gt;[http://www.wola.org/drug_policy/press_release_coca_cultivation_2004.htm Aerial Spraying Fails to Reduce Coca Cultivation in Colombia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050406013944/http://www.wola.org/drug_policy/press_release_coca_cultivation_2004.htm |date=2005-04-06 }}, WOLA, March 31, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Official estimates of coca cultivation in Peru for 2005 have yet to be released, but the State Department’s own reporting suggests that cultivation in Peru has increased.

In Bolivia, there has been a decrease in clashes since 2004, when [[Evo Morales]] and former President [[Carlos Mesa]] struck a deal allowing the Chapare region to legally grow a limited amount of coca, in addition to the already legal [[Yungas]] region.

In 2006 the Colombian government destroyed around 730 square kilometres, reaching new records in coca plant destruction. The Colombian government planned to destroy around 500&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of coca plants in 2007, which would leave only around 200&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; left. The Colombian government planned to destroy the remaining coca gradually over the following years.&lt;ref name=sne&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.presidencia.gov.co/prensa_new/sne/2007/enero/03/17032007.htm Erradicán manualment 50 mil hectáreas de coca en 2007], Presidencia de Colombia press release, January 3, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotes==
{{quote|The U.S. has supplied tens of thousands of gallons of Roundup to the Colombian government for use in aerial fumigation of coca crops. We have been using a fleet of crop dusters to dump unprecedented amounts of high-potency glyphosate over hundreds of thousands of acres in one of the most delicate and bio-diverse ecosystems in the world. This futile effort has done little to reduce the availability of cocaine on our streets, but now we are learning that a possible side-effect of this campaign could be the unleashing of a ''Fusarium'' epidemic in the Amazon basin. The drug war has tried in vain to keep cocaine out of people's noses, but could result instead in scorching the lungs of the earth.|[http://www.ips-dc.org/staff/sanho Sanho Tree], the director of the [[Institute for Policy Studies Drug Policy Project]].}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8457">The '''Commission for Truth and Reconciliation in Yugoslavia''' was created in March 2001 through a mandate from President [[Vojislav Koštunica|Vojislav Kostunica]]. The Commission was given a time limit of three years to complete its work and submit a report. Kostunica ordered the Commission to outline its own terms as far as the scope of the mandate.&lt;ref name=":04"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Unspeakable Truths: Transitional Justice and the Challenge of Truth Commissions|last=Hayner|first=Priscilla|publisher=Routledge|year=2011|isbn=978-0-415-87202-7|location=New York City|pages=252–253}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission was eventually tasked with investigating the causes of conflicts in the territories of the [[Serbia and Montenegro|Former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Facing the Past and Transitional Justice in Countries of the Former Yugoslavia|last=Zupan|first=Natascha|work=Peacebuilding and Civil Society in Bosnia-Herzegovina|publisher=Lit-Verlag|year=2006|editor-last=Fischer|editor-first=Martina|location=Munster|pages=327–339}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2002, nearly a year after it was announced, the Commission began its work. During the years specified in the Commission's mandate (2001-2004), former President [[Slobodan Milošević|Slobodan Milosevic]] was standing trial before the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY) on charges of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. The Commission had planned to fully cooperate with the ICTY and briefly entertained the idea of holding regional hearings throughout the former republic to gather evidence. In early 2003, Yugoslavia formally dissolved and became [[Serbia and Montenegro]]. This effectively ended the Commission as it relied on a mandate from the president of Yugoslavia, an office that no longer existed. As far as it is known, the Commission never conducted any interviews, held any hearings, or filed any reports.&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt;

== Background ==
The “Yugoslav idea” developed out of a desire expressed by [[Serbs]] and [[Croats]] to be independent from the former [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] Empires. Following [[World War I]], Yugoslavia was created from the remains of these empires. However, there would be a number of reconstructions of the land until [[World War II]]. In 1945, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was officially established. The population of Yugoslavia was made up of two main ethnic groups. The Narodi included [[Croats|Croatians]], [[Serbs]], [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]], and [[Montenegrins]]. The Narodnosti were [[Albanians]], [[Hungarians]], [[Turkish people|Turks]], and [[Slovenes|Slovenians]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/11636321/Memories_and_reconciliation_in_Former_Yugoslavia|title=Memories and reconciliation in Former Yugoslavia|website=www.academia.edu|access-date=2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, these groups lived relatively harmoniously. It was only in recent decades that major conflicts erupted. There have been four notable ethnically based conflicts in Yugoslavia: Serbs and Croats, Serbs and [[Muslim]]s, Serbs and the multiethnic population of [[Sarajevo]], and Muslims and Croats. Similarly, recent Yugoslavian history is marked by three main conflicts: war in [[Slovenia]] in 1991, war in [[Croatia]] in 1991, and war in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia-Herzegovina]] in 1992.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

During the years of the [[Kosovo War|Kosovo Conflict]] (1998–99), Yugoslavia saw a dramatic increase in anti-Serb propaganda which caused Serbs to react violently towards other ethnic groups, mostly Albanians. Yugoslavian President [[Slobodan Milošević]], a Serb himself, attempted to re-write the historical narrative by countering with his own propaganda to make the Serbs look like victims. It was well-known that the Serbs were the cause of many past conflicts in the region&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Truth and Reconciliation in Serbia|last=Nikolic-Ristanovic|first=Vesna|work=Handbook of Restorative Justice: A Global Perspective|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|isbn=|location=London|pages=369–383}}&lt;/ref&gt; The violence between Serbs and Albanians created what Milošević referred to as the "Kosovo problem". He believed that, although Albanians had the right to self-determination, they did not have a right to independence. The Kosovo region was historically and culturally significant to Serbs and needed to remain a part of Yugoslavia.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

It is estimated that the Kosovo Conflict saw 200,000 deaths and millions more displaced.&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt; It was believed by many that Milošević's actions led to these consequences. On May 24, 1999 [[Trial of Slobodan Milošević|Milošević was indicted]] on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity by the ICTY. However, he would stay in power until October 2000 when he lost the presidential election to Kostunica. On April 1, 2001 Yugoslavian authorities arrested Milošević on charges of corruption and abuse of power. After a lengthy debate in the government, he was extradited to [[The Hague]] in July. Kostunica denounced the extradition, saying that it violated a policy in the Yugoslavian constitution which prohibited the extradition of criminals to other countries. The government maintained that because the UN is not a country, the policy does not apply.

The formation of the Commission was formally announced by Kostunica in March 2001. It began its work in February 2002, nearly a year later. The Commission ended in early 2003, a year short of its mandated time limit. Since the Commission required a mandate from the president of Yugoslavia (a position that did not exist after the disbanding of Yugoslavia), the work could not be continued.&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt;

== Mandate ==
Despite the fact the Kostunica authorized the Commission, he allowed the commissioners to outline their own terms. His only stipulation was that the Commission would have three years to conduct its work and submit a final report.&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt; Eventually the Commission was tasked with investigating the "causes and the course of events of all conflicts in the territory of the former Yugoslavia."&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; The Commission was state funded, but it also accepted private donations, though little funding came from outside the government. Although the funding came from the government, the Commission was in charge of determining how the budget would be spent. There was also a permanent staff that would work for the Commission. However, by August 2001, no funding or staff had been put in place yet.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254596008_The_Yugoslav_Truth_and_Reconciliation_Commission_A_Shaky_Start|title=The Yugoslav Truth and Reconciliation Commission: A Shaky Start|website=ResearchGate|access-date=2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The staff positions were eventually filled with much of the staff being on loan from Kostunica's office. Two staff members resigned from their posts shortly after the Commission's work began in 2002. The Commission stated that it would work in full compliance with the ICTY and raised the idea of holding regional hearings across the former republic.&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt;

== Criticism ==
Due to the premature end of the Commission, a formal report was never submitted. No hearings were ever held nor were any interviews ever conducted.&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt; The Commission faced much criticism from both domestic and international sources. Some Yugoslavian citizens pushed for more diversity in the Commission's staff. They felt that the commissioners were too close to Kostunica and thus their judgement was being influenced. It was clear that neither the Commission nor the government had any inclination to conduct a real investigation.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt; Others worried that the Commission was trying to re-write history rather uncover the truth. International critics felt that the mandate needed to be clarified and streamlined. They also remarked on the fact that three years is an unusually long time for a truth commission to last.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt;

The '''Consumer Review Fairness Act of 2016''', signed into law by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]] on December 14, 2016, is a federal consumer protection statute banning the use of [[gag clause]]s in non-negotiable consumer [[standard form contract|form contracts]].

==History==
On September 16, 2015, [[John Thune|Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.)]], chairman of the [[Senate Commerce Committee]], along with Senators [[Brian Schatz|Schatz]] and [[Jerry Moran]], introduced the Consumer Review Freedom Act of 2015 (S. 2044). The legislation was co-sponsored by [[Bill Nelson|Senator Bill Nelson]] and Senators [[Richard Blumenthal]], [[Claire McCaskill]], [[Steve Daines]], and [[Cory Booker]]. Similar legislation was introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman [[Darrell Issa]] on April 29, 2015 (H.R. 2110).

On November 4, 2015, the [[Senate Commerce Committee]] held a [[congressional hearing|hearing]] exploring the impact of non-disparagement clauses in form contracts. Witnesses testified that non-disparagement clauses have been used in many industries, including [[healthcare industry|health care]], [[retail]], and [[hospitality industry|hospitality]]. The Committee also heard testimony from Jen Palmer, a consumer and plaintiff in the lawsuit [[Palmer v. Kleargear.com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.commerce.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/hearings?ID=1103D910-E8BD-453B-B5B9-BB3ED817C4E9|title=Zero Stars: How Gagging Honest Reviews Harms Consumers and the Economy|publisher=Senate Commerce Committee Press Release|date=November 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In that case, an online retailer demanded that Ms. Palmer remove a negative online review or pay $3,500 in damages because the website's terms of service included a non-disparagement clause. The Senate Commerce Committee received testimony that [[California]] has enacted a law to bar such clauses in non-negotiable form contracts. The Committee also learned that the FTC has brought an enforcement action against one company, alleging, inter alia, that the firm's threats to enforce a gag provision against consumers to stop them from posting negative reviews and testimonials online constitute an unfair trade practice in violation of [[Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914|section 5 of the FTC Act]]. In some cases, judges have refused to enforce non-disparagement clauses in form contracts usually on the grounds of [[unconscionability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-114shrg20128/pdf/CHRG-114shrg20128.pdf|title=Zero Stars: How Gagging Honest Reviews Harms Consumers and the Economy|publisher=Senate Commerce Committee Hearing Transcript|date=November 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the persuasive rational of these judicial opinions, the Commerce Committee nevertheless felt that federal legislation was necessary  to eliminate any ambiguity over the enforceability of non-disparagement clauses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/114/crpt/srpt175/CRPT-114srpt175.pdf|title=Committee Report on the Consumer Review Freedom Act of 2015|publisher=Senate Commerce Committee|date=December 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary of Provisions==
The Consumer Review Fairness Act of 2016 invalidates non-disparagement clauses in form contracts and makes it unlawful for a person to offer or enter into a contract containing a non-negotiable non-disparagement clause.  Violations of this prohibition are enforced by the [[Federal Trade Commission]] and [[state attorneys general]].  The law does not limit the ability of a person or business to file a civil cause of action for defamation, libel, slander, or any similar cause of action under State law.

==Enforcement History==
In August 2018, the [[Federal Trade Commission|FTC]] brought its first case charging violations of the Consumer Review Fairness Act against the marketers behind a purported [[Get-rich-quick scheme|money-making promotion]] called Sellers Playbook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Web|url=https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/business-blog/2018/08/first-consumer-review-fairness-case-takes-promoters-big|title=First Consumer Review Fairness case takes on promoter’s “big bucks on Amazon” claim|publisher=Federal Trade Commission|date= August 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In that case, the FTC alleged that, in addition to misrepresenting earnings claims, the defendants offered form contracts to their customers that contained provisions that bar or restrict their customers' ability to engage in reviews and performance assessments, among other things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/sellers_playbook_complaint.pdf|title=Complaint for Permanent Injunction and Other Equitable Relief|publisher=Federal Trade Commission|date=August 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{#invoke:Portal | portal | Birds | Fishing | Animal rights}}
'''Cormorant culling''' is the intentional killing of [[cormorant]]s by humans for the purposes of wildlife management. It has been practiced for centuries, with supporters of culling generally arising from the [[angling]] community. Culling techniques may involve the killing of birds, the destruction of eggs or both. Historically, culls have occurred to protect the interests of recreational and commercial fishermen who perceive the animals to be competing with them for their intended catch or for the prey of their intended catch.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2181345/Anglers-infuriate-bird-campaigners-cull-cormorants-demolishing-fish-stocks.html|title = Anglers infuriate bird campaigners as they call for cull of cormorants that are demolishing fish stocks|last = Cohen|first = Tamara|date = 2012-07-31|work = |access-date = 2014-12-30|newspaper = Daily Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1960s, the growing [[aquaculture]] industry has undertaken cormorant culls to protect its farmed fish and crustacean stocks. Opponents of cormorant culling include conservation groups such as the [[National Audubon Society]], [[Cormorant Defenders International]]&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/cormorant-debate-which-part-of-the-ecosystem-to-protect-1.859181|title = Cormorant debate: Which part of the ecosystem to protect?|last = Oosthoek|first = Sharon|date = 2009-05-26|work = |access-date = 2014-12-30|publisher = CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sea Shepherd]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Target species ==
The target species are primarily the [[double-crested cormorant]] in North America and the [[great cormorant]] in Europe, Japan and Australia. The [[little black cormorant]] has also been targeted in Australia. In Africa, the [[reed cormorant]] is targeted and shot.

=== Double-crested cormorant ===
[[File:257 Double-crested Cormorant.jpg|thumb|Double-crested cormorant]]
Before Europeans became a major presence, double-crested cormorants lived throughout much of their current North American range, usually in populations far greater than 21st century observations. After birdwatching near [[Natchez, Mississippi]] in December 1820, [[John James Audubon]] reported: &lt;blockquote&gt;“We saw to day probably ''Millions'' of those . . . Cormorants, flying Southwest—they flew in Single Lines for several Hours extremely high.”&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.naturalhistorymag.com/features/19298/to-kill-a-cormorant|title = To kill a cormorant|date = |accessdate = 2014-12-31|website = Natural History|publisher = |last = King|first = Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;No comparable numbers of the birds can be seen today.

After a protracted period of cormorant population reduction due to expanding human settlement, breeding habitat loss and persecution in the forms of shooting and egging, a turning point for the species was reached in 1972. The National Audubon Society listed the double-crested cormorant as a species of special concern. The state of Wisconsin declared cormorants endangered and began building nesting structures to help them return. The use of [[DDT]] was banned, a chemical agent which was proven to thin cormorant eggs and had impacted recruitment since its introduction following [[World War II]]. Congress also signed a revised [[Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918|Migratory Bird Treaty Act]] granted cormorants federal protection. Since that time, the species has been recovering.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Catfish and baitfish aquaculture have grown rapidly since the 1960s, particularly in the south-eastern United States. Open aquaculture ponds provide winter or year-round homes and food for cormorants on the species' long-established migration route. This has also led to conflict and prompted culling at aquaculture facilities. Cormorants’ effect on the aquaculture industry is significant, with a dense flock capable of consuming a harvest. Cormorants are estimated to cost the catfish industry in Mississippi alone between $10 million and $25 million annually.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The double-crested cormorant is the only species appreciably found inland in the United States.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Methods ==

=== Shooting ===
[[Shooting]] is the most commonly employed and immediately effective method of cormorant culling. [[Sharpshooters]] are sometimes hired to undertake the work (Shiga prefecture, Japan) and in some jurisdictions, hunters are issued permits to allow them to kill these otherwise protected birds (South Carolina, United States). Birds can be shot on the water, on the wing, or at their breeding sites.

=== Egg smothering ===
The smothering of eggs with food-grade [[corn oil]] is another method employed by authorized persons. Once applied, the eggs' porous surface, which allows the transport of oxygen, becomes clogged with oil. The parent birds continue to incubate the oiled eggs, which ultimately fail to hatch.

== Culling by region ==
Cormorant culling has occurred in many countries including Australia, the United Kingdom, Germany, Estonia, Japan, the United States and Canada.

=== Australia ===
The culling of cormorants occurred in Australia from the 1900s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article152466447|title = Correspondence. War on cormorants.

In some cases, bounties were offered as incentives to encourage people to hunt the birds.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Primary target species included the [[little black cormorant]] and [[great cormorant]].

==== New South Wales ====
In New South Wales, a bounty was in place for a number of years prior to 1919. It was discontinued as inland cormorant populations continued to be replenished via migration and it was proven to be ineffective in preventing fish losses. During the bounty period approximately 44,000 cormorants were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article31647656|title = The cormorant invasion.

==== Queensland ====
Since the development of the aquaculture industry, cormorants have been responsible for some stock losses including at [[Freshwater prawn farming|commercial prawn farms]]. In Bowen, Queensland, the use of non-lethal methods to deter the animals from settling on farm ponds and feeding on farmed prawns has been adopted in favor of culling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Pacific Reef Fisheries Guthalungra Farm, Draft property management plan - Predator management|last = Anderson|first = Trevor|publisher = Pacific Reef Fisheries|year = 2006|isbn = |location = |pages = |url = http://pacificreef.com.au/EIS/Draft%20PMP%20for%20wildlife.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== South Australia ====
In April 1905, the South Australian government inaugurated a bounty of 1d per head of cormorant or freshwater turtle. Prior May 1908, 25,537 cormorant heads were paid for, and 89,333 turtles. Most of the cormorants came from Kangaroo Island and Franklin Harbor rookeries and the turtles were caught in the Murray River and its lakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5141710|title = Cormorants and turtles|last = |first = |date = 1908-05-21|work = |access-date = 2015-01-07|newspaper = The Advertiser}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year 1909-1910, 3183 cormorants were destroyed in [[South Australia]], with bounties paid for their heads. During the same period, 18,706 turtles were also culled as both animals were considered 'enemies' of fish. The total combined bounty paid was £91 4/.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article103903622|title = South Australia's Fish Supply.|last = |first = |date = 1910-10-07|work = |access-date = 2015-01-07|newspaper = Daily Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of the cull argued that cormorants were responsible for keeping [[toadfish]] and [[Leatherjacket fish|leatherjacket]] numbers in check on Kangaroo Island, and that these fish, feeding on the larvae of other fish, likely had a greater impact on reducing quantities of preferred target species than the cormorants' own fishing practices. They argued that the animals should be protected, not hunted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article164769264|title = Protect the cormorant|last = Anderson|first = A. H.|date = 1912-02-10|work = |access-date = 2015-01-07|newspaper = Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tasmania ====
In [[Tasmania]] in 1954 a bounty on the heads of cormorants was proposed at 5/ per head. The proposal was supported by anglers, who expressed their concern at the animal's impact on trout populations inland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article99514840|title = Cormorant bounty is good news|last = |first = |date = 1954-02-13|work = |access-date = 2015-01-07|newspaper = Examiner|location = Launceston, Tasmania}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bounty was raised from 3/6 to 5/- to encourage people to hunt the birds. Tasmania's Northern Fisheries Association responded by planning a special 'black cormorant day' of hunting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article99522224|title = Cormorant drive planned|last = |first = |date = 1954-02-10|work = |access-date = 2015-01-07|newspaper = Examiner|location = Launceston, Tasmania}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
On Middle Island in Lake Erie, the double-crested cormorant population is managed by the Canadian government. The first three breeding pairs were seen on the island in 1987, and over the following twenty years their population increased to over 5,000 pairs. Pressure on the island and lake's other species via competition, habitat alteration and predation created the case for culling as a management strategy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1998, a group of fishing guides undertook an unauthorized cull, shooting cormorants on [[Little Galloo Island]] in [[Lake Ontario]]. Estimates of the scale of the cull range from 800&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; to 2000 birds. It is a federal offence to kill a protected bird, and eventually the perpetrators were brought to justice.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In New Brunswick, cormorants are classified as a varmints. As such, holders of a varmint hunting license can kill them in unlimited numbers between early March and late September each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hunt &amp; Fish 2017|url=http://www2.gnb.ca/content/dam/gnb/Departments/nr-rn/pdf/en/wildlife/HuntTrap.pdf|publisher=New Brunswick Department of Energy and Resource Development|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Japan ===
[[File:Great cormorant.jpg|alt=Great cormorant|thumb|Great cormorant]]
In 2013, the Japanese population of [[great cormorant]]s, ''[[Phalacrocorax carbo]], ''was estimated to be over 100,000 birds. Conflict between increasing great cormorant populations and the [[ayu]] (or ayu sweetfish ''[[Plecoglossus altivelis]]'') has led the Japanese government to implement cormorant culling. The ayu is one of the most popular species for commercial and recreational fisheries in Japan.

In the Shiga prefecture, great cormorants have been responsible for impacts to forests (through alteration of habitat and [[guano]] deposition) and fisheries (through predation). At the [[Lake Biwa]] rookeries, between 10,000 and 25,000 cormorants were shot annually between the years 2004 and 2012 (with the exception of 2008, during which no birds were shot). Since 2009, sharpshooters have been employed by the government to undertake the culling, replacing hunters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/cormorants/files/Cormorants_in_Japan.pdf|title = Cormorants in Japan: Population development, conflicts and management|date = |accessdate = 2014-12-30|website = European Commission - EU Cormorant Platform|publisher = |last = Kameda|first = Kayoko|last2 = Tsuboi|first2 = Jun-ichi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
In 2010, 2000 cormorants were culled in the United Kingdom under special licences according to the [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The animals have been protected from arbitrary killing in the UK since 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/anglers-urge-cull-of-cormorants-for-eating-too-many-fish-6164691.html|title = Anglers urge cull of cormorants for eating too many fish|last = Woolf|first = Marie|date = 2004-07-28|work = |access-date = 2014-12-30|newspaper = The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cull for environmental protection purposes is underway at [[Haweswater]], United Kingdom where cormorants are killed for the protection of [[schelly]], an endangered [[Freshwater whitefish|whitefish]] species.

=== USA ===
In thirteen states of the United States, aquaculture producers may shoot cormorants which feed on their stock in private ponds. They may also call upon government wildlife managers to shoot birds found roosting nearby. Local managers in twenty-four states are allowed to suffocate cormorant eggs with oil, destroy their nests, or kill cormorants that threaten public resources, such as wild fish, plants, and other birds’ nesting areas.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Individuals and states are permitted to kill a total of 160,000 cormorants each year. An average of about 40,000 cormorants are reported killed each year—perhaps amounting to 2 percent of North America’s population. The kill statistics do not include the tens of thousands of eggs oiled annually.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In 2000, an unauthorized cull was undertaken on [[Little Charity Island]] in [[Saginaw Bay]], Michigan that killed more than 500 cormorants. Despite lacking the required permits to kill the protected species, the perpetrators were not brought to justice.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In the span of one month, commencing in February 2014, hunters culled 11,653 double-crested cormorants during a licensed action in South Carolina. 1,225 permits were issued to hunters to kill cormorants during this period. One hunter alone reported killing 278 birds. Similar hunts occurred in Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Vermont, and Wisconsin in 2013, resulting in a combined total cull of 21,312 cormorants. The culling was unsuccessfully opposed by the [[Audubon Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.outdoorlife.com/blogs/newshound/2014/04/south-carolinas-controversial-cormorant-hunt-culls-11k-birds|title = South Carolina's Controversial Cormorant Hunt Culls 11K Birds|last = Krebs|first = Natalie|date = 2014-04-07|work = |access-date = 2014-12-30|newspaper = Outdoor Life}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A cull of 16,000 [[double-crested cormorants]] along the [[Columbia River]] in Oregon has been proposed to commence in 2015 and is intended to reduce pressure on salmon stocks.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.seashepherd.org/news-and-media/2014/07/07/call-to-action-oppose-the-planned-killing-of-16000-cormorants-along-the-columbia-river-1602|title = CALL TO ACTION: Oppose the Planned Killing of 16,000 Cormorants Along the Columbia River|date = 2014-07-07|accessdate = 2014-12-30|website = Sea Shepherd|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental impacts ==
The long-term ecological effects of cormorant culling are uncertain and disputed. Cormorant numbers are effectively reduced during culls, but the targeted species remain in recovery after centuries of arbitrary killing and habitat loss. A paucity of dietary studies also means that the impact cormorants have on commercially important species (with the exception of pond-based aquaculture) are difficult to estimate. One unintended consequence of cormorant culling is that managers who enter nesting grounds to cull or oil eggs may cause more harm to other bird species in the process than the nesting cormorants do themselves.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Alternatives to culling ==
The primary justification for the culling of cormorants is to reduce pressure on wild or farmed fish populations. It has been suggested that humans have caused the damage to fisheries and aquatic ecosystems through overfishing, introduction of exotic species and pollution. It has been further suggested that money spent trying to manage cormorants could be better used in reducing coastal pollution, securing conservation land and marine preserves, and assisting aquaculture producers and fishermen to develop new bird conservation practices.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In law, a '''coupon settlement''' is a resolution between disputing parties in a [[class action]] lawsuit, reached either before or after court action begins.  In a coupon settlement, class members receive coupons or other promises for products or services instead of a cash award.&lt;ref name="Coupon"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3975/is_200510/ai_n15640312/ |title=Coupon Settlements: The Emperor's Clothes of Class Actions |author=Steven B. Hantler, Robert E. Northon |date=Fall 2005 |work=Georgetown Journal of Legal Ethics |publisher=CBS Interactive |accessdate=December 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coupon settlements are recognised in state and federal courts in the United States.

==Criticisms of coupon settlements==
Coupon settlements have been used as a way for a defendant to forestall major liability by precluding a large number of people from litigating their claims separately, to recover reasonable compensation for the damages. However, existing law requires judicial approval of all coupon settlements, and in most cases class members are given a chance to opt out of class settlement, though class members, despite opt-out notices, may be unaware of their right to opt out because they did not receive the notice, did not read it, or did not understand it. 

The [[Class Action Fairness Act of 2005]] (CAFA) addresses some of these concerns. Coupon Settlements may be audited by an independent expert before judicial approval in order to ensure that the settlement will be of value to the class members (28 U.S.C.A. 1712(d)). 

In the United States, federal courts must hold a hearing and make specific findings that the coupon settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate, and that the class members' interests are represented. The following can be taken into consideration during the hearing:

# The strength of the class member's case.
# The risk, expense, complexity, and duration of further litigation.
# The risk of maintaining class action status.
# The amount offered to each class member in settlement.
# The form of the settlement (coupons, checks, replacement products, or services).
# The amount offered in total in settlement.
# The extent of the discovery that has been completed.
# The experience of counsel.
# The presence of a governmental participant.
# The reaction of class members to the proposed settlement.

Another criticism has been that plaintiffs' lawyers involved in coupon settlements receive cash fees in amounts that generally dwarf the award recovered by individual class members.&lt;ref name="Coupon"/&gt;

The name derives from the case of ''San Diego Navy Federal Credit Union v. Cumis Insurance Society, Inc.'', which the [[California Courts of Appeal|California Court of Appeal]] for the Fourth Appellate District decided on December 3, 1984.&lt;ref name="Cumis"&gt;, [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/CA3/162CA3d358.htm 162 Cal. App. 3d 358, 208 Cal. Rptr. 494] (4th Dist. 1984).&lt;/ref&gt; While ''Cumis'' is the best-known appellate precedent on the issue of the appointment of independent counsel for the [[defense (legal)|defense]] of insureds when their [[insurance]] company has a conflict of interest,&lt;ref name="Pierce"&gt;Jack S. Pierce, Harold Weston, Robert G. Levy, &amp; David J. McMahon, Insurance Practices and Coverage in Liability Defense §&amp;nbsp;9.05[C], pp. 9-25 to 9-26 (Wolters Kluwer Law &amp; Business 2d ed 2014) ({{ISBN|9781454835301}}).&lt;!--|accessdate=October 5, 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; ''Cumis'' was not the first proponent of this principle. The [[Supreme Court of California]] approved the concept of independent counsel in an earlier 1964 case, which in turn was based upon a 1925 Kentucky case that laid the foundation for appointing independent counsel in the insurer-insured relationship.&lt;ref name="Pierce" /&gt;  ''Cumis'' innovated beyond existing precedent as of 1984 by holding that the insurer was required to pay for the insured's independent counsel, and that a merely theoretical conflict of interest could be ripened by the insurer's act of sending a [[reservation of rights]] letter into an actual conflict of interest, which in turn meant that the insured now had a right to independent counsel.&lt;ref name="Pierce" /&gt;

''Cumis'' concluded as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We conclude the Canons of Ethics impose upon lawyers hired by the insurer an obligation to explain to the insured and the insurer the full implications of joint representation in situations where the insurer has reserved its rights to deny coverage. If the insured does not give an informed consent to continued representation, counsel must cease to represent both. Moreover, in the absence of such consent, where there are divergent interests of the insured and the insurer brought about by the insurer's reservation of rights based on possible noncoverage under the insurance policy, the insurer must pay the reasonable cost for hiring independent counsel by the insured. The insurer may not compel the insured to surrender control of the litigation ... Disregarding the common interests of both insured and insurer in finding total nonliability in the third party action, the remaining interests of the two diverge to such an extent as to create an actual, ethical conflict of interest warranting payment for the insureds' independent counsel.&lt;ref&gt;''Cumis'', 162 Cal. App. 3d at p.&amp;nbsp;375.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[California State Legislature]] later{{When|date=August 2016}} enacted a statute governing the right of insured defendants to independent counsel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cacodes/civ/2860.html California Civil Code §&amp;nbsp;2860].&lt;/ref&gt;

A common conflict of interest arises when the insurance company denies or refuses to defend all or part of a claim under a [[liability insurance]] policy, such as when an insurance company pays for the defense of a policyholder under a reservation of rights to dispute coverage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legal-explanations.com/definitions/cumis-counsel.htm Definition at the Legal Explanations Web site].&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=August 2016}}

A law firm can still have a [[conflict of interest]], despite the appointment of a ''Cumis'' counsel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duanemorris.com/articles/static/MHSCumisConundrum.pdf "Cumis Conundrum" from Duane Morris newsletter].&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=August 2016}} However, in some states, the appointment can cure a conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.findlaw.com/1999/Jul/1/126812.html Findlaw.com], citing ''Finley v. The Home Insurance Co.'', 1998 WL 905218 (Haw. 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; The appointment of ''Cumis'' counsel also raises unusual [[attorney–client privilege]] issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://calbar.ca.gov/calbar/pdfs/ethics/96-0012_OPN.pdf See the State Bar of California ethics opinion on the issue of privileged records].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prior and subsequent developments==

After a number of pioneering [[insurance bad faith]] cases in the 1950s and 1960s, it became common for U.S. insurers to reflexively issue reservation of rights letters in response to practically every tender of a third party claim by an insured. Under those earlier cases, it was held that if an insurer withdrew a defense after failing to reserve their rights, they could be (and were actually often held to be) liable for all damages suffered by the insured, including damages in excess of the policy's limits of coverage. Therefore, insurers wanted to always reserve their right to withdraw if facts were later discovered precluding coverage (e.g., evidence that the insured was guilty of an [[intentional tort]], which is uninsurable).

The ''Cumis'' decision changed that practice significantly. Now, in California and several other states, an insurer faced with a new tender has three options: (1) deny the tender completely and either risk an immediate bad faith lawsuit by the insured or having to sue the insured first to obtain a judicial declaration of no coverage (a "race to the courthouse"); (2) accept the tender without a reservation of rights and thereby commit to defending the insured to a final judgment (unless the policy is expressly designed so that defense costs "eat away" at policy limits); or (3) accept the tender but issue a reservation of rights letter, which may cause the insured to promptly exercise his or her right to ''Cumis'' counsel if a potential conflict of interest is already clear enough at that point in time under the known facts or allegations and the insurer's letter expressly reserves the right to withdraw from the insured's defense and deny indemnity for that reason. In turn, the third option jacks up the insurer's costs because the insurer now has to pay for independent counsel and counsel of its own to monitor the case at arm's length (so that privileged information ''never'' reaches the insurer).

The advantage of the second option is that by assuming complete responsibility for the defense of its insured, the insurer has more control over defense costs. Most insurers operate so-called "captive" law firms (carefully designed to avoid the ban on the corporate practice of law)&lt;ref&gt;''Unauthorized Practice of Law Committee v. American Home Assurance Company'', 261 S.W.3d 24 (Tex. 2008).  In this decision, Texas joined the nine other states which as of that year had judicially endorsed this practice.  The Court also noted that Florida promulgated ethical rules allowing it, and three other states have statutes allowing it. Only the supreme courts of Kentucky and North Carolina have endorsed ethics committee opinions that prohibit insurers from defending insureds directly with their own staff counsel and require them to hire local counsel at arm's length.&lt;/ref&gt; and also maintain "panels" of preferred defense law firms who agree to carefully negotiated rate structures. In contrast, because independent counsel is separate from the insurer, their billing rates will be somewhat higher since they merely must bill the "reasonable" rate for their defense services. But if the insurer accepts the defense without a reservation of rights, it must defend ''completely'' and loses the right to recover the cost of defense from the insured even if it later discovers that the entire claim was uninsurable to begin with.

Because of all these issues, reservation of rights letters are issued today by adjusters only after careful consideration and discussion with experienced insurance coverage counsel.

'''Military Prosecution Service''' or '''Judge Advocate General’s Corps''' ({{Lang-da|'''Forsvarets Auditørkorps'''}}, short '''''FAUK''''') is a Danish independent military [[prosecutor]] and the legal branch of the [[Danish military]]. It is a Level.I command and is under the [[Ministry of Defence (Denmark)|Ministry of Defence]]. The Judge Advocate General ({{lang-da|Generalauditør}}) heads the Defence Judge Advocate Corps. It is located at [[Kastellet, Copenhagen|Kastellet]] in [[Copenhagen]].

The Judge advocate General and [[Judge advocate]]s are members of the military system, but outside the military rank system. The [[Chief of Defence (Denmark)|Chief of Defence]], otherwise the commander of all Danish military personal, does not have authority over Judge advocates prosecutors.

In a military criminal case the Defence Judge Advocate Corps conducts investigation and decides whether or not a charge should be brought up.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2014">A '''dummy purchaser''' is an [[Agent (law)|agent]] who buys property on behalf of another, usually to conceal the true purpose of the acquisition. For instance, a shopping mall developer may hire a dummy buyer to purchase the needed vacant lots. Disclosing the principal's identity might prompt the landowners to hold out for a higher price; hence the need for secrecy. It has been hypothesized that dummy buyers could help private sector developers obtain the land needed for highway construction without the need for [[eminent domain]] invocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Street Smart: Competition, Entrepreneurship, and the Future of Roads|chapter=Do Holdout Problems Justify Compulsory Right-of-Way Purchase|pages=48|author=Benson, Bruce L.|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A principal in such a relationship may be a [[partially disclosed principal]] (i.e. the agent informs the seller that he is buying on behalf of someone, but does not reveal that person's identity) or a completely [[undisclosed principal]] (i.e. the agent does not reveal that he is acting on anyone's behalf). A dummy purchaser is also sometimes called a [[Straw man (law)|straw man]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rickseiler.com/SeilerSchoolOfRealEstate/IndependentStudy/Glossary.htm Glossary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dummying==
In [[Australia]], during periods of conversion of Government land to freehold or leasehold, the practice (also called "dummyism") of wealthy [[Squatting (pastoral)|squatters]] employing someone who qualifies as a "[[Squatting (pastoral)#Legislation to allow selection|free selector]]" to acquire land that they themselves would not have access to.&lt;ref&gt;Ramson, W. S. (ed.) ''The Australian National Dictionary'' Oxford University Press, Melbourne 1988 p.225 {{ISBN|0 19 554736 5}} &lt;/ref&gt; This practice was particularly useful in acquiring or denying to others access to watercourses and thoroughfares.

'''ElcomSoft''' Co.Ltd. is a privately owned software company headquartered in Moscow, Russia. Since its establishment in 1990, the company has been working on computer security programs, with the main focus on password and system recovery software.

==The DMCA case==
{{main|US v. ElcomSoft Sklyarov}}

On July 16, 2001, [[Dmitry Sklyarov]], a Russian citizen employed by ElcomSoft who was at the time visiting the United States for [[DEF CON (convention)|DEF CON]], was arrested and jailed for allegedly violating the United States [[DMCA]] law by writing ElcomSoft's Advanced eBook Processor software.  A landmark court case ensued, setting precedents and attracting much public attention and protest.  On December 17, 2002, ElcomSoft was found not guilty of all four charges under the DMCA. [[Bruce Chizen]], CEO of [[Adobe Systems]], had this to say to [[CNET]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Looking back with 20/20, I wish that we could have had better communication with ElcomSoft, Dmitry Sklyarov and the EFF (Electronic Frontier Foundation) before the whole thing went public. I'm sorry that we weren't able to do that, because I think we could have resolved a lot of the issues.''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.planetpdf.com/mainpage.asp?webpageid=3123&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Thunder Tables==
[[Thunder Tables]]® is the company's own technology developed to ensure guaranteed recovery of [[Microsoft Word]] and [[Microsoft Excel]] documents protected with [[40-bit encryption]]. The technology first appeared in 2007 and employs the [[time–memory tradeoff]] method to build pre-computed [[hash table]]s, which open the corresponding files in a matter of seconds instead of days. These tables take around ~ 4GB. So far, the technology is used in two password recovery programs: Advanced Office Password Breaker and Advanced PDF Password Recovery.

== Cracking wi-fi password with GPUs ==
In 2009 ElcomSoft released a tool that takes WPA/WPA2 Hash Codes and uses [[Brute-force attack|brute-force methods]] to guess the password associated with a wireless network.&lt;ref&gt;http://hothardware.com/cs/forums/t/41491.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The brute force attack is carried out by testing passwords with a known SSID of a network of which the WPA/WPA2 Hash Code has been captured. The passwords that are tested are generated from a dictionary using various [[mutation (genetic algorithm)]] methods, including case mutation (password, PASSWORD, PassWOrD, etc.), year mutation (password, password1992, password67, etc.), and many other mutations to try to guess the correct password.

The advantages of using such methods over the traditional ones, such as [[rainbow table]]s,&lt;ref&gt;http://wirelessdefence.org/Contents/coWPAttyMain.htm&lt;/ref&gt; are numerous. Rainbow tables, being very large in size because of the amount of SSID/Password combinations saved, take a long time to traverse, cannot have large numbers of passwords per SSID, and are reliant on the SSID being a common one which the rainbow table has already listed hash codes for (Common ones include linksys, belkin54g, etc.). EWSA, however, uses a relatively small dictionary file (a few megabytes versus dozens of gigabytes for common rainbow tables) and creates the passwords on the fly as needed. Rainbow tables are tested against a captured WPA/WPA2 Hash Code via a computer's processor with relatively low numbers of simultaneous processes possible. EWSA, however, can use a computer's processor(s), with up to 32 logical cores, up to 8 GPUs, all with many CUDA cores(NVIDIA) or Stream Processors(ATI).

== Vulnerability in Canon authentication software ==

On November 30, 2010, Elcomsoft announced that the encryption system used by Canon cameras to ensure that pictures and Exif metadata have not been altered was flawed and cannot be fixed.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pcworld.com/article/211965/analyst_finds_flaws_in_canon_image_verification_system.html&lt;/ref&gt;  
On that same day, [[Dmitry Sklyarov]] gave a presentation at the Confidence 2.0 conference in Prague demonstrating the flaws.&lt;ref&gt;http://201002.confidence.org.pl/prelegenci/dmitry-sklyarov&lt;/ref&gt;  Among others, he showed an image of an astronaut planting a [[flag of the Soviet Union]] on the moon; all the images pass Canon's authenticity verification.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/article/369757/analyst_finds_flaws_canon_image_verification_system/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://boingboing.net/2010/11/30/dmitry-sklyarov-and.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members==
The Commission is made up of seven members. The position of Chairman became vacant in June 2018 when the President, Nana Akufo-Addo sacked [[Charlotte Osei]], the first lady to occupy this position in Ghana. This was apparently on the recommendation of a committee set up by [[Sophia Akuffo]], the [[Chief Justice of Ghana]].&lt;ref name="sacked"/&gt; She was appointed by former [[President]] [[John Dramani Mahama|John Mahama]], in consultation with the [[Council of State of Ghana]] in June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mahama appoints new EC boss|url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Mahama-appoints-new-EC-boss-364615|website=Ghanaweb|publisher=Ghana Home Page|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her two deputies were  Amadu Sulley and [[Georgina Opoku Amankwah]]. Sulley Amadu was appointed by [[John Atta Mills]], the then Ghanaian President following the retirement of David Kangah who had served in that capacity for 19 years.&lt;ref name=EC2012&gt;{{cite web|title=Amadu Sulley sworn in as Deputy Electoral Commissioner|url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/politics/Amadu-Sulley-sworn-in-as-Deputy-Electoral-Commissioner-238299|website=Ghanaweb|publisher=Ghana Home Page|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georgina Opoku Amankwah]] was appointed by President John Mahama to replace Sarfo-Kantanka who had served for about 20 years.

==International support==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2017}}
The acclaim that the commission received for successfully supporting the close [[Ghanaian presidential election, 2008|elections of 2008]], has made it a focus of African and international election reform organizations.&lt;ref name=release&gt;{{cite press release | title = EXPERTS GATHER IN GHANA TO DEVELOP IMPROVED STANDARDS FOR AFRICAN ELECTIONS | url = http://www.ifes.org/publication/cba16b2cb21d0a9782ba54c57b8db64e/Ghana_African_Elections_11092009.pdf | publisher = [[National Democratic Institute]] | date = 9 November 2009 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110616213431/http://www.ifes.org/publication/cba16b2cb21d0a9782ba54c57b8db64e/Ghana_African_Elections_11092009.pdf | archivedate = 16 June 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2009, a conference was held to analyze this election, and try to establish new standards and practices for African election commissions.&lt;ref name =release/&gt; Held in Accra, the conference was titled ''Colloquium on African Elections: Best Practices and Cross-Sectoral Collaboration.''&lt;ref name = release/&gt; The conference was organized by a number of international election reform organizations including the [[National Democratic Institute]], the [[Africa Center for Strategic Studies]], the [[International Foundation for Electoral Systems]], the [[Netherlands Institute for Multiparty Democracy]], the [[Open Society Initiative for West Africa]] and [[UNDP]].&lt;ref name = release/&gt;

==Elections==
The Electoral Commission of Ghana established a biometric system of registration for the electoral register prior to the 2012 [[Ghanaian presidential election, 2012|presidential]] and [[Ghanaian parliamentary election, 2012|parliamentary elections]] to prevent double registration and to eliminate ghost names in the old register.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Compilation of Biometric Register Begins March 24|url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/artikel.ph=227516|work=General news|publisher=Ghana Home Page|accessdate=14 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Preceding Institutions ==
The lives of Electoral Commissions prior to the Fourth Republic of Ghana were interrupted due to military coups. At the time of the UNIGOV referendum in 1976, Justice Isaac K. Abban was appointed by the [[Supreme Military Council (Ghana)|Supreme Military Council]] under [[Ignatius Kutu Acheampong]]. In 1979, Justice Joe Kingsley Nyinah was the Electoral Commissioner during the [[Ghanaian general election, 1979|general election]]. For the [[Ghanaian presidential election, 1992|Ghanaian presidential election]] and [[Ghanaian parliamentary election, 1992|parliamentary election]] in 1992, the Electoral Commissioner was Justice Josiah Ofori Boateng.

In the EU, electronic signatures and related [[trust service]]s are regulated by the Regulation (EU) N°910/2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market ([[eIDAS|eIDAS Regulation]]). This regulation was adopted by the [[Council of the European Union]] on 23 July 2014. It became effective on 1 July and repealed the [[Electronic Signatures Directive]] 1999/93/EC. At the same date, any laws of EU member states that were inconsistent with eIDAS were also automatically repealed, replaced or modified. In contract to the aforementioned directive (which allowed the EU member states to interpret it and transpose it to their own law) the eIDAS Regulation is directly effective in all member states.

This Directive was repealed on 1 July 2016 and superseded by the [[eIDAS]] regulation (see its article 48).

The '''English-Speaking Union Moot''', also known as, by virtue of a sponsorship arrangement with [[Essex Court Chambers]], the '''ESU-Essex Court Chambers National Mooting Competition''', or simply the '''ESU Moot''', is the longest running national mooting competition in the UK, involving teams of law students from Universities across the country. The competition is run by the [[English-Speaking Union]].

==History==

In addition to being the oldest mooting competition, the ESU moot is also the largest of its kind, accepting entries from Universities across the legal jurisdictions of the UK. Originally, the ESU moot was known as the Observer Moot, and has been known by its current name since 2000. [[Legal Week]] currently acts as the competition's media partner.

==Format==

The competition takes a knockout format, with 6 rounds, the last two of which take place on the same day. While the number of rounds require 64 participants, there is facility for more competitors than this, with special arrangements made to have pre-competition rounds to whittle the competitors down to 64.

Each round must be completed by a particular preset deadline, with one team being designated the host, and is thus responsible for securing a judge and organising facilities for the moot. All finalists and semi-finalists are presented with monetary prizes. In addition, the winners are awarded the Silver Mace, and the runner's up the Scarman Shield.

'''''Faretta v. California''''', 422 U.S. 806 (1975),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Faretta v. California|volume=422|page=806|pin=|year=1975}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was a case in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held that criminal [[defendant]]s have a constitutional right to refuse counsel and [[Pro se legal representation in the United States|represent themselves]] in state criminal proceedings.

==Facts of the case==
The defendant Anthony Faretta was accused of [[grand theft]] in [[Los Angeles County, California]]. Well before the [[trial]] began, the defendant requested permission to represent himself. Questioning by the judge revealed that he had once represented himself in a criminal case and that he believed that the public defender's office was under a heavy case load. The judge warned him that he was making a mistake and emphasized that he would receive no special treatment. The judge entered a preliminary ruling allowing Faretta to represent himself, however stating that he might reverse his decision if it seemed that he was unable to adequately represent himself.

Several weeks later, but still before the trial, the judge initiated a hearing to inquire into Faretta's ability to defend himself. After questioning him on numerous topics, including hearsay and juries, the judge ruled that his answers were inadequate and he had not made an intelligent decision to waive counsel. In addition he ruled that Faretta had no constitutional right to his own defense. Therefore he rescinded his previous decision. During the trial the judge denied Faretta's motions to be co-counsel and other motions he attempted to make on his behalf. Subsequently he was convicted by a jury and sentenced to life in prison.

The California Court of Appeal, which relied on a recent California Supreme Court decision that had expressly decided the issue, ruled that Faretta had no federal or state right to represent himself. Appeal to the Supreme Court of California was denied.

==Opinion of the court==
In the [[opinion of the court]] by Justice Stewart, the Court held that a defendant in a state criminal trial has the constitutional right to refuse appointed counsel and conduct the trial when he or she voluntarily and intelligently elects to do so. However, such a defendant may not later complain that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. The court brought analogies to the [[Star Chamber]], saying "the Star Chamber has, for centuries, symbolized disregard of basic individual rights. The Star Chamber not merely allowed, but required, defendants to have counsel. The defendant's answer to an indictment was not accepted unless it was signed by counsel. When counsel refused to sign the answer, for whatever reason, the defendant was considered to have confessed."&lt;ref&gt;422 U.S. at 821-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dissents==
Justice Blackmun wrote a [[Dissenting opinion|dissent]] where he questioned the additional procedural problems that would inevitably arise by the decision, arguing that such procedural problems would far outweigh whatever tactical advantage the defendant may feel he has gained by electing to represent himself. Blackmun concludes with the following: "If there is any truth to the old proverb 'one who is his own lawyer has a fool for a client,' the Court by its opinion today now bestows a ''constitutional'' right on one to make a fool of himself."

{{Politics of Malaysia}}

The '''Human Rights Party Malaysia''' is a [[Malaysia]]n [[human rights]]-based [[political party]] founded on 19 July 2009, led by human rights activist [[P. Uthayakumar|P.Uthayakumar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanrightspartymalaysia.com/2009/07/17/announcement-of-human-rights-party-hrp-malaysia/|title=ANNOUNCEMENT OF HUMAN RIGHTS PARTY (HRP), MALAYSIA.|publisher=Human Rights Party Malaysia|date=2009-07-17|accessdate=2009-07-22|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100511213120/http://www.humanrightspartymalaysia.com/2009/07/17/announcement-of-human-rights-party-hrp-malaysia/|archivedate=2010-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently Uthayakumar is the Secretary General (pro tem) of HRP with the support of Uthayakumar's brother and Leader of [[HINDRAF]] [[Waytha Moorthy Ponnusamy|P.Waythamoorthy]].

Human Rights Party Malaysia was formed as a multiracial party which promises that it would carry on with the [[HINDRAF|Hindraf Makkal Sakthi’s]] initial 18-point demands dated August 2007 to the government of Malaysia and in particular Article 8 (Equality before the law) Article 12 (1) (b) (no discrimination) and Article 153(1) (legitimate interests of other communities) of the Federal Constitution. The main thrust of this party is to be the focus group in putting the Malaysian Indians back onto the national mainstream development of Malaysia after 52 years of having been left out.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} The party also focus on all other communities that are suffering from the worst forms of violations of human rights in Malaysia, in particular the Malaysian Indians who instead get the least attention not only from the ruling [[UMNO]] regime but also from the opposition parties [[People's Justice Party, Malaysia|PKR]], [[Democratic Action Party|DAP]], [[Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party|PAS]], NGOs, civil society and the print and electronic media generally, albeit to a lesser extent. {{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

The main struggle of HRP is against all forms of racism and racial discrimination by the current ruling government in Malaysia, namely UMNO.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

{{About|a step in the removal of a public official|challenging a witness in a legal proceeding|Witness impeachment}}
{{Use mdy dates|date=March 2017}}
[[File:Presidente da Coreia do Sul, Park Geun-hye, visita o Brasil.jpg|thumb|250px|Brazilian President [[Dilma Rousseff]] and South Korean President [[Park Geun-hye]] were both impeached.]]
'''Impeachment''' is the process by which a [[legislative body]] levels [[Indictment|charges]] against a government official. It does not mean removal from office; it is only a statement of charges, akin to an [[indictment]] in [[criminal law]]. Once an individual is impeached, he or she must then face the possibility of conviction by a legislative vote, which judgment entails removal from office.

Because impeachment and conviction of officials involve an overturning of the normal constitutional procedures by which individuals achieve high office (election, ratification, or appointment) and because it generally requires a [[supermajority]], they are usually reserved for those deemed to have committed serious abuses of their office. In the [[United States]], for example, impeachment at the federal level is limited to those who may have committed "[[high crimes and misdemeanors]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Erskine|first=Daniel H.|date=2008|title=The Trial of Queen Caroline and the Impeachment of President Clinton: Law As a Weapon for Political Reform|url=http://openscholarship.wustl.edu/law_globalstudies/vol7/iss1/2/|journal=Washington University Global Studies Law Review|language=en|volume=7|issue=1|pages=|issn=1546-6981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Impeachment exists under constitutional law in many countries around the world, including [[Brazil]], the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[India]], the [[Philippines]], [[Russia]], [[South Korea]], and the [[United States]].

==Etymology and history==
The word "impeachment" derives from Old French ''empeechier'' from Latin ''impedicare'' expressing the idea of becoming caught or entrapped, and has analogues in the modern [[French Language|French]] verb ''empêcher'' (to prevent) and the modern [[English Language|English]] ''impede''. Medieval popular etymology also associated it (wrongly) with derivations from the Latin ''impetere'' (to attack). (In its more frequent and more technical usage, [[Witness impeachment|impeachment]] of a [[witness]] means challenging the honesty or credibility of that person.)

Impeachment was first used in the British political system.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} Specifically, the process was first used by the English "[[Good Parliament]]" against [[William Latimer, 4th Baron Latimer|Baron Latimer]] in the second half of the 14th century. Following the British example, the constitutions of Virginia (1776), Massachusetts (1780) and other states thereafter adopted the impeachment mechanism, but they restricted the punishment to removal of the official from office. As well, in private organizations, a [[motion to impeach]] can be used to prefer charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite parl|title=DEM|pages=265|edition=1969|year=1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In various jurisdictions==

===Austria===
The [[President of Austria|Austrian Federal President]] can be impeached by the [[Federal Assembly of Austria|Federal Assembly]] (''Bundesversammlung'') before the Constitutional Court. The constitution also provides for the recall of the president by a [[referendum]]. Neither of these courses has ever been taken. This is likely because while the President is vested with considerable powers on paper, they act as a largely ceremonial figurehead in practice, and are thus hardly in a position to abuse their powers.

===Brazil===
{{See also|Impeachment of Dilma Rousseff|Impeachment proposals against Michel Temer}}
The [[President of the Federative Republic of Brazil]], state governors and municipal mayors may be impeached by the [[Chamber of Deputies (Brazil)|Chamber of Deputies]] and tried and removed by the [[Federal Senate]]. Upon conviction, the officeholder has his political rights revoked for eight years—which has the effect of barring him from running for any office.

[[Fernando Collor de Mello]], the 32nd President of Brazil, resigned in 1992 amidst impeachment proceedings. Despite his resignation, the Senate nonetheless voted to convict him and bar him from holding any office for eight years, due to evidence of [[bribery]] and misappropriation.

In 2016, the [[Chamber of Deputies (Brazil)|Chamber of Deputies]] initiated [[Impeachment process against Dilma Rousseff|an impeachment case]] against President [[Dilma Rousseff]] on allegations of budgetary mismanagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Andrew Jacobs |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/18/world/americas/brazil-dilma-rousseff-impeachment-vote.html |title=Brazil's Lower House of Congress Votes for Impeachment of Dilma Rousseff |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 17, 2016 |accessdate=November 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following her conviction, she was replaced by Vice President [[Michel Temer]], who had served as [[Acting (law)|acting]] president while Rousseff's case was pending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-36273916 |title=Brazil's Dilma Rousseff to face impeachment trial |date=May 12, 2016 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bulgaria===
The [[President of Bulgaria]] can be removed only for [[high treason]] or violation of the constitution. The process is started by a two-thirds majority vote of the [[Parliament of Bulgaria|Parliament]] to impeach the President, whereupon the Constitutional Court decides whether the President is guilty of the crime of which he is charged. If he is found guilty, he is removed from power. No Bulgarian President has ever been impeached. The same procedure can be used to remove the [[Vice President of Bulgaria]], which has also never happened.

===Croatia===
The process of impeaching the [[President of Croatia]] can be initiated by a two-thirds majority vote in favor in the [[Sabor]] and is thereafter referred to the [[Constitutional Court of the Republic of Croatia|Constitutional Court]], which must accept such a proposal with a two-thirds majority vote in favor in order for the president to be removed from office. This has, however, never occurred in the history of the Republic of [[Croatia]]. However, in case of a successful impeachment motion a president's constitutional term of five years would be terminated and an election called within 60 days of the vacancy occurring. During the period of vacancy the presidential powers and duties would be carried out by the [[Speaker of the Croatian Parliament]] in his/her capacity as Acting President of the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sabor.hr/fgs.axd?id=17074|title=Constitution of Croatia|at=§ 105|format=PDF|accessdate=March 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Czech Republic===
Prior to 2013 the [[President of the Czech Republic]] could be impeached only for an act of high [[treason]] (which is not defined in the [[Constitution of the Czech Republic]] itself). The process has to start in the [[Senate of the Czech Republic]] which only has the right to impeach the president, this passes the case to the [[Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic]] which has to decide whether the President is guilty or not. If the Court decides that the President is guilty then the President loses his office and the ability to be elected President of the Czech Republic ever again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psp.cz/docs/laws/constitution.html Ústava České republiky]. Psp.cz. Retrieved 2013-07-12.&lt;/ref&gt; No Czech president has ever been impeached, though, members of the Senate [[Impeachment of Václav Klaus|sought to impeach President Vaclav Klaus in 2013]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Czech President Vaclav Klaus faces treason charge |date=March 4, 2013 |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-21660234 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=October 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This case was dismissed by the court reasoning that his mandate has expired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Constitutional Court throws out treason charges against ex-president Klaus |author=Rob Cameron |date=March 28, 2013 |url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/curraffrs/constitutional-court-throws-out-treason-charges-against-ex-president-klaus |publisher=[[Radio Praha]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the constitution changed; now the process can be started by at least three-fifths of present senators and must be approved by at least 
three-fifths of all members of Parliament. Also, the President can be impeached not only for high treason (newly defined in the [[Constitution of the Czech Republic|Constitution]]) but also for a serious infringement of the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psp.cz/docs/laws/constitution.html Ústava České republiky]. Psp.cz. Retrieved on 2016-10-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
The [[President of Germany|Federal President of Germany]] can be impeached both by the [[Bundestag]] and by the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]] for willfully violating Federal law. Once the Bundestag or the Bundesrat impeaches the president, the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Federal Constitutional Court]] decides whether the President is guilty as charged and, if this is the case, whether to remove him or her from office. The Federal Constitutional Court also has the power to remove federal judges from office for willfully violating core principles of the [[Grundgesetz|federal constitution]] or a [[states of Germany|state]] constitution. The impeachment procedure is regulated in Article 61 of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]].

===Hong Kong===
The [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong]] can be impeached by the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]]. A motion for investigation, initiated jointly by at least one-fourth of all the legislators charging the Chief Executive with "serious breach of law or dereliction of duty" and refusing to resign, shall first be passed by the Council. An independent investigation committee, chaired by the [[Chief Justice of the Court of Final Appeal]], will then carry out the investigation and report back to the Council. If the Council find the evidence sufficient to substantiate the charges, it may pass a motion of impeachment by a two-thirds majority.&lt;ref name=HKSAR&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/en/basiclawtext/chapter_4.html |title=Basic Law of Hong Kong |website=basiclaw.gov.hk |publisher=Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government |date= |accessdate=November 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Article 73(9)}}

However, the Legislative Council does not have the power actually to remove the Chief Executive from office, as the Chief Executive is appointed by the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|Central People's Government]]. The Council can only report the result to the Central People's Government for its decision.&lt;ref name=HKSAR/&gt;{{rp|Article 45}}

===India===
The [[President of India|president]], judges including chief justice of [[Supreme Court of India|supreme court]] and high courts can be impeached by the [[Parliament of India|parliament]] before the expiry of the term for violation of the Constitution. Other than impeachment, no other penalty can be given to a president in position for the violation of the Constitution under [[s:Constitution of India/Part XIX|Article 361]] of the constitution. However a president after his term/removal can be punished for his already proven unlawful activity under [[Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971|disrespecting constitution]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Prevention of Insults to National Honour (Amendment) Act of 1971|url=http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/pdf/Prevention_Insults_National_Honour_Act1971.pdf|accessdate=2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; No president has faced impeachment proceedings. Hence, the provisions for impeachment have never been tested. The president in position cannot be charged and needs to step down in order for that to happen.

===Iran===
The [[Assembly of Experts]] can impeach the [[Supreme Leader of Iran]] and appoint a new one, although the Supreme Leader elects half the Assembly.

The [[President of Iran]] can be impeached jointly by the members of the [[Islamic Consultative Assembly of Iran|Assembly (Majlis)]] and the [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Supreme Leader]]. A new presidential election is then triggered. [[Abolhassan Banisadr]], Iran's first president, was impeached in June 1981 and removed from the office. [[Mohammad-Ali Rajai]] was elected as the new president.

Cabinet ministers can be impeached by the members of the [[Islamic Consultative Assembly of Iran|Assembly]]. Presidential appointment of a new minister is subject to a parliamentary [[vote of confidence]]. Impeachment of ministers has been a fairly commonly used tactic in the power struggle between the president and the assembly during the last several governments.

===Ireland===
{{anchor|Ireland}}{{anchor|Republic of Ireland}}In the [[Republic of Ireland]] formal impeachment only applies to the [[President of Ireland|Irish president]]. Article 12 of the [[Constitution of Ireland|Irish Constitution]] provides that, unless judged to be "permanently incapacitated" by the [[Irish Supreme Court|Supreme Court]], the president can only be removed from office by the houses of the [[Oireachtas]] (parliament) and only for the commission of "stated misbehaviour". Either house of the Oireachtas may impeach the president, but only by a resolution approved by a majority of at least two-thirds of its total number of members; and a house may not consider a proposal for impeachment unless requested to do so by at least thirty of its number.

Where one house impeaches the president, the remaining house either investigates the charge or commissions another body or committee to do so. The investigating house can remove the president if it decides, by at least a two-thirds majority of its members, both that the president is guilty of the charge, and that the charge is sufficiently serious as to warrant the president's removal. To date no impeachment of an Irish president has ever taken place. The president holds a largely ceremonial office, the dignity of which is considered important, so it is likely that a president would resign from office long before undergoing formal conviction or impeachment.

The Republic's Constitution and law also provide that only a joint resolution of both houses of the Oireachtas may remove a judge. Although often referred to as the "impeachment" of a judge, this procedure does not technically involve impeachment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1004843561|title=LOCK HIM UP : impeachments in the united states.|last=DON.|first=RILEY,|date=2017|publisher=LULU COM|isbn=9781365960857|location=[S.l.]|oclc=1004843561}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
In Italy, according to Article 90 of the Constitution, the President of the Republic can be impeached through a majority vote of the Parliament in joint session for high treason and for attempting to overthrow the Constitution. If impeached, the President of the Republic is then tried by the Constitutional Court integrated with sixteen citizens older than forty chosen by lot from a list compiled by the Parliament every nine years.

Italian press and political forces made use of the term "impeachment" for the attempt by some members of parliamentary opposition to initiate the procedure provided for in Article 90 against Presidents [[Francesco Cossiga]] (1991),&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/13/world/president-of-italy-is-making-political-waves.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Giorgio Napolitano]] (2014)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-politics/italy-parliament-rejects-bid-to-impeach-president-napolitano-idUSBREA1A0VH20140211&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sergio Mattarella]] (2018)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/28/world/europe/italy-sergio-mattarella-carlo-cottarelli.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liechtenstein===
Members of the Liechtenstein Government can be impeached before the State Court for breaches of the Constitution or of other laws.&lt;ref name=liechtensteinConstitution&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/research/liechtenstein-constitution.pdf |title=Constitution of the Principality of Liechtenstein |publisher=Legal Service of the Government of the Principality of Liechtenstein |website=hrlibrary.umn.edu |date=2003 |accessdate=November 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Article 62}} As a [[hereditary monarchy]] the [[Monarchy of Liechtenstein|Sovereign Prince]] can not be impeached as he "is not subject to the jurisdiction of the courts and does not have legal responsibility".&lt;ref name=liechtensteinConstitution/&gt;{{rp|Article 7}} The same is true of any member of the [[House of Liechtenstein|Princely House]] who exercises the function of head of state should the Prince be temporarily prevented or in preparation for the Succession.&lt;ref name=liechtensteinConstitution/&gt;{{rp|Article 7}}

===Lithuania===
In the [[Republic of Lithuania]], the President may be impeached by a three-fifths majority in the [[Seimas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Constitution of the Republic of Lithuania|url=http://www3.lrs.lt/home/Konstitucija/Constitution.htm|accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Rolandas Paksas]] was removed from office by impeachment on April 6, 2004 after the [[Constitutional Court of Lithuania]] found him guilty of having violated his oath and the constitution. He was the first European [[head of state]] to have been impeached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lithuanian Parliament Removes Country's President After Casting Votes on Three Charges|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/07/world/lithuanian-parliament-removes-country-s-president-after-casting-votes-three.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 7, 2004|accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of government, representatives of the national assembly (Stortinget) and Supreme Court judges can be impeached for criminal offenses tied to their duties and committed in office, according to the Constitution of 1814, §§ 86 and 87. The procedural rules were modeled after the US rules and are quite similar to them. Impeachment has been used eight times since 1814, last in 1927. Many argue that impeachment has fallen into [[desuetude]]. In cases of impeachment, an appointed court (Riksrett) takes effect.

===Pakistan===
The country's ruling coalition said on August 7, 2008, that it would seek the impeachment of [[President of Pakistan|President]] [[Pervez Musharraf]], alleging the U.S.-backed former general had "eroded the trust of the nation" and increasing pressure on him to resign. He resigned on August 18, 2008. Another kind of impeachment in Pakistan is known as the vote of less-confidence or vote of mis-understanding and has been practiced by provincial assemblies to weaken the national assembly.

Impeaching a president requires a two-thirds majority support of lawmakers in a joint session of both houses of Parliament.

===Philippines===
{{main|Impeachment in the Philippines}}
Impeachment in the Philippines follows procedures similar to the [[United States]]. Under Sections 2 and 3, Article XI, [[Constitution of the Philippines]], the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines]] has the exclusive power to initiate all cases of impeachment against the [[President of the Philippines|President]], [[Vice President of the Philippines|Vice President]], members of the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]], members of the Constitutional Commissions ([[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]], [[Civil Service Commission (Philippines)|Civil Service Commission]] and the [[Commission on Audit (Philippines)|Commission on Audit]]), and the [[Philippine Ombudsman|Ombudsman]]. When a third of its membership has endorsed the impeachment articles, it is then transmitted to the [[Senate of the Philippines]] which tries and decide, as impeachment tribunal, the impeachment case.&lt;ref name="Article XI"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.chanrobles.com/article11.htm|title= The 1987 Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines - Article XI|accessdate= 2008-07-25|author= Chan-Robles Virtual Law Library|date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A main difference from US proceedings however is that only one third of House members are required to approve the motion to impeach the President (as opposed to a simple majority of those present and voting in their US counterpart). In the Senate, selected members of the House of Representatives act as the prosecutors and the Senators act as judges with the Senate President presiding over the proceedings (the Chief Justice jointly presides with the Senate President if the President is on trial). Like the United States, to convict the official in question requires that a minimum of two thirds (i.e. 16 of 24 members) of all the Members of the Senate vote in favor of conviction. If an impeachment attempt is unsuccessful or the official is acquitted, no new cases can be filed against that impeachable official for at least one full year.

====Impeachable offenses and officials====
The 1987 Philippine Constitution says the grounds for impeachment include culpable violation of the Constitution, bribery, [[Graft (politics)|graft]] and corruption, and betrayal of public trust. These offenses are considered "high crimes and misdemeanors" under the Philippine Constitution.

The President, Vice President, Supreme Court justices, and members of the Constitutional Commission and Ombudsman are all considered impeachable officials under the Constitution.

====Impeachment proceedings and attempts====
President [[Joseph Estrada]] was the first official [[Trial of Joseph Estrada|impeached]] by the House in 2000, but the trial ended prematurely due to outrage over a vote to open an envelope where that motion was narrowly defeated by his allies. Estrada was deposed days later during the [[2001 EDSA Revolution]].

In 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008, impeachment complaints were filed against President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]], but none of the cases reached the required endorsement of 1/3 of the members for transmittal to, and trial by, the Senate.

In March 2011, the House of Representatives [[Impeachment of Merceditas Gutierrez|impeached]] [[Ombudsman of the Philippines|Ombudsman]] [[Merceditas Gutierrez]], becoming the second person to be impeached. In April, Gutierrez resigned prior to the Senate's convening as an impeachment court.

In December 2011, in what was described as "blitzkrieg fashion", 188 of the 285 members of the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]] [[Impeachment of Renato Corona|voted]] to transmit the 56-page [[Articles of Impeachment against Chief Justice Renato Corona|Articles of Impeachment]] against [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] [[Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines|Chief Justice]] [[Renato Corona]].

To date, three officials had been successfully impeached by the House of Representatives, and two were not convicted. The latter, [[Renato Corona|Chief Justice Renato C. Corona]], on May 29, 2012 has been convicted by the Senate guilty under Article II of the Articles of Impeachment (of betraying public trust), with 20-3 votes from the Senator Judges.

===Peru===

{{See also|First impeachment process against Pedro Pablo Kuczynski}}

===Poland===
In Polish law there is no impeachment procedure defined, as it is present in the other countries. Infringements of the law can be investigated only by special Parliament's Committee or (if accusations involve people holding the highest offices of state) by the [[State Tribunal (Poland)|State Tribunal]]. The State Tribunal is empowered to rule for the removal of individuals from public office but it is not a common practice.

===Romania===
The [[President of Romania|President]] can be impeached by [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]] and is then suspended. A referendum then follows to determine whether the suspended President should be removed from office. President [[Traian Băsescu]] was impeached twice by the Parliament: in 2007 and more recently in July 2012. [[Romanian presidential impeachment referendum, 2007|A referendum was held]] on May 19, 2007 and a large majority of the electorate voted against removing the president from office. For the most recent suspension [[Romanian presidential impeachment referendum, 2012|a referendum was held]] on July 29, 2012, but was invalidated due to low turnout, however the results were heavily against the president (&lt;ref&gt;[[:ro:Referendumul pentru demiterea președintelui României, 2012]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=October 2017}})

===Russia===
The [[President of Russia]] can be impeached if both the [[State Duma]] (which initiates the impeachment process through the formation of a special investigation committee) and the [[Federation Council of Russia]] vote by a two-thirds majority in favor of impeachment and, additionally, the [[Supreme Court of the Russian Federation|Supreme Court]] finds the President guilty of [[treason]] or a similarly heavy crime against the nation and the [[Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation|Constitutional Court]] confirms that the constitutional procedure of the impeachment process was correctly observed. In 1995&amp;ndash;1999, the Duma made several attempts to impeach then-President [[Boris Yeltsin]], but they never had a sufficient number of votes for the process to reach the Federation Council.

===South Korea (Republic of Korea)===
{{See also|Impeachment of Park Geun-hye}}
According to the Article 65 Clause 1 of [[Constitution of South Korea]], if President, Prime Minister, or other state council members including Supreme Court and Constitutional court members, violate the Constitution or other laws of official duty, the National Assembly can impeach them. Clause 2 states the impeachment bill may be proposed by one third or more of the total members of the National Assembly, and shall require majority voting and approved by two thirds or more of the total members of the National Assembly. This article also states that any person against whom a motion for impeachment has been passed shall be suspended from exercising his power until the impeachment has been adjudicated and shall not extend further than removal from public office. Provided, That it shall not exempt the person impeached from civil or criminal liability.

Two presidents have been impeached since the foundation of the Sixth Republic of Korea and adoption of the new [[Constitution of South Korea]] in 1987. [[Roh Moo-hyun]] in 2004 was impeached by the National Assembly but was overturned by the Constitutional Court. [[Park Geun-hye]] in 2016 was impeached by the National Assembly, and the impeachment was confirmed by the Constitutional Court on March 10, 2017.

===Taiwan===
In [[Taiwan]], according to the [[Additional Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China]], impeachment of the president or the vice president by the [[Legislative Yuan]] shall be initiated upon the proposal of more than one-half of the total members of the Legislative Yuan and passed by more than two-thirds of the total members of the Legislative Yuan, whereupon it shall be presented to the grand justices of the [[Judicial Yuan]] for adjudication.

===Ukraine===
During the crisis which started in November 2013, the increasing political stress of the face-down between the protestors occupying Independence Square in Kiev and the State Security forces under the control of [[President Yanukovych]] led to deadly armed force being used on the protestors. Following the negotiated return of Kiev's City Hall on February 16, 2014, occupied by the protesters since November 2013, the security forces thought they could also retake "Maidan", Independence Square. The ensuing fighting from 17 through 21 February 2014 resulted in a considerable number of deaths and a more generalised alienation of the population, and the withdrawal of President Yanukovych to his support area in the East of Ukraine.
 
In the wake of the President's departure, Parliament convened on February 22; it reinstated the 2004 Constitution, which reduced Presidential authority, and voted impeachment of President Yanukovych as ''[[de facto]]'' recognition of his departure from office as President of an integrated Ukraine. The President riposted that Parliament's acts were illegal as they could pass into law only by Presidential signature.

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom]] anybody may be prosecuted and tried by the two Houses of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] for any crime.&lt;ref name=UK0001 &gt;{{cite web|url=http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN02666|title=Standard Note SN/PC/2666: Impeachment|format=PDF|last=Gay|first=Oonagh|date=November 30, 2004|publisher=[[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] Library|accessdate=2009-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first recorded impeachment is that of [[William Latimer, 4th Baron Latimer]] during the [[Good Parliament]] of 1376. The last was that of [[Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville]] in 1806.&lt;ref name=UK0001 /&gt;

====Procedure====
The [[House of Commons]] holds the power to impeach. Any member may make an accusation of any crime. The member must support the charge with evidence and [[motion (parliamentary procedure)|move]] for impeachment. If the Commons carries the motion, the mover receives orders to go to the bar at the [[House of Lords]] and to impeach the accused "in the name of the House of Commons, and all the commons of the United Kingdom."

The mover must tell the Lords that the House of Commons will, in due time, exhibit particular articles against the accused, and make good the same. The Commons then usually selects a committee to draw up the charges and create an "Article of Impeachment" for each. (In the case of [[Warren Hastings]], however, the drawing up of the articles preceded the formal impeachment.) Once the committee has delivered the articles to the Lords, replies go between the accused and the Commons via the Lords. If the Commons have impeached a peer, the Lords take custody of the accused; otherwise, custody goes to [[Black Rod#Black Rod in the United Kingdom|Black Rod]]. The accused remains in custody unless the Lords allow bail. The Lords set a date for the trial while the Commons appoints managers, who act as prosecutors in the trial. The accused may defend by counsel.

The House of Lords hears the case. The procedure used to be that the [[Lord Chancellor]] presided (or the [[Lord High Steward]] if the defendant was a [[peerage|peer]]); but this was when the Lord Chancellor was both the Lords' presiding officer and head of the judiciary of England and Wales. Since both these roles were removed from that office by the [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]], which created the [[Lord Speaker]] to preside over the Lords and made the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]] head of the judiciary, it is not certain who would preside over an impeachment trial today. If Parliament is not in session, then the trial is conducted by a "Court of the Lord High Steward" instead of the House of Lords (even if the defendant is not a peer). The differences between this court and the House of Lords are that in the House all of the peers are judges of both law and fact, whereas in the Court the Lord High Steward is the sole judge of law and the peers decide the facts only; and the bishops are not entitled to sit and vote in the Court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lonang.com/exlibris/blackstone/bla-419.htm ''Commentaries on the Laws of England,] [[William Blackstone]], vol. 4 chapter 19 (1769)&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, peers would wear their parliamentary robes during the hearings.

The hearing resembles an ordinary trial: both sides may call witnesses and present evidence. At the end of the hearing the lords vote on the verdict, which is decided by a simple majority, one charge at a time. Upon being called, a peer must rise and declare "guilty, upon my honour" or "not guilty, upon my honour". After voting on all of the articles has taken place, and if the Lords find the defendant guilty, the Commons may move for judgment; the Lords may not declare the punishment until the Commons have so moved. The Lords may then decide whatever punishment they find fit, within the law. A royal [[pardon]] cannot excuse the defendant from trial, but a pardon may reprieve a convicted defendant. However, a pardon cannot override a decision to remove the defendant from the public office they hold.

====History====

Parliament has held the power of impeachment since medieval times. Originally, the House of Lords held that impeachment could apply only to members of the [[peerage]], as the nobility (the Lords) would try their own peers, while commoners ought to try their peers (other commoners) in a [[jury]]. However, in 1681, the Commons declared that they had the right to impeach anyone, and the Lords have respected this resolution. Offices held "during good behaviour" are terminable by the writ of either ''[[quo warranto]]''&lt;ref&gt;eg. [[R v Richardson]]&lt;/ref&gt; or ''[[scire facias]]'', which has even been employed by and against well-placed judges.&lt;ref&gt;Raoul Berger, ''Impeachment: The Constitutional Problems'' p. 132 (1974, Harvard University Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

After the reign of [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]], impeachment fell into disuse, the [[bill of attainder]] becoming the preferred form of dealing with undesirable subjects of the Crown. However, during the reign of [[James I of England|James I]] and thereafter, impeachments became more popular, as they did not require the assent of the Crown, while bills of attainder did, thus allowing Parliament to resist royal attempts to dominate Parliament. The most recent cases of impeachment dealt with [[Warren Hastings]], [[Governor-General of India]] between 1773 and 1786 ([[Impeachment of Warren Hastings|impeached in 1788]]; the Lords found him not guilty in 1795), and [[Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville]], [[First Lord of the Admiralty]], in 1806 (acquitted). The last attempted impeachment occurred in 1848, when [[David Urquhart]] accused [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]] of having signed a secret treaty with [[Imperial Russia]] and of receiving monies from the [[Nicholas I of Russia|Tsar]]. Palmerston survived the vote in the Commons; the Lords did not hear the case.

=====Queen Caroline=====
{{main|Pains and Penalties Bill 1820}}
[[Caroline of Brunswick|Queen Caroline]], consort of [[George IV of Great Britain|King George IV]], was tried by the House of Commons and acquitted. The process began as impeachment proceedings, but then became a different procedure as a [[bill of attainder|bill of pains and penalties]].

====Modern politics====
The procedure has, over time, become rarely used and some legal authorities (such as [[Halsbury's Laws of England]]) consider it to be probably obsolete. The principles of "responsible government" require that the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] and other executive officers answer to Parliament, rather than to the Sovereign. Thus the Commons can remove such an officer through a [[motion of no confidence]] without a long, drawn-out impeachment. However, it is argued by some that the remedy of impeachment remains as part of British constitutional law, and that legislation would be required to abolish it. Furthermore, impeachment as a means of punishment for wrongdoing, as distinct from being a means of removing a minister, remains a valid reason for accepting that it continues to be available, at least in theory.

The Select Committee on Parliamentary Privilege in 1967 recommended "that the right to impeach, which has long been in disuse, be now formally abandoned".&lt;ref&gt;"Report from the Select Committee on Parliamentary Privilege", HC 34 1967-68 para 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Their recommendation not having been implemented in the meantime, the Select Committee on Privileges in 1977 declared it "to be of continuing validity" and again urged that it be adopted.&lt;ref&gt;"Third report from the Committee of Privileges: Recommendations of the Select Committee on Parliamentary Privilege", HC 417 1976-77 para 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before this report was issued, in April 1977 the [[National League of Young Liberals|Young Liberals]]' annual conference unanimously passed a motion calling on [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] leader [[David Steel]] to move for the impeachment of [[Ronald King Murray, Lord Murray|Ronald King Murray]] QC, the [[Lord Advocate]], over his handling of the [[Patrick Meehan]] miscarriage of justice affair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Liberals confident of victory on petrol duty |newspaper=[[The Times]] |date=April 11, 1977 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steel did not move any such motion but Murray (now Lord Murray, a former [[List of Senators of the College of Justice|Senator of the College of Justice]] of Scotland) agreed that the power still existed.

The Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege in 1999 noted the previous recommendations to formally abandon the power impeachment, and stated that "The circumstances in which impeachment has taken place are now so remote from the present that the procedure may be considered obsolete".&lt;ref&gt;"Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege report", HC 214 1998-99, para 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Notwithstanding, on August 25, 2004, [[Plaid Cymru]] MP [[Adam Price]] announced his [[Impeach Blair campaign|intention to move for the impeachment]] of [[Tony Blair]] for his role in involving Britain in the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. He asked the [[Leader of the House of Commons]] [[Peter Hain]] whether he would confirm that the power to impeach was still available, reminding Hain that as President of the Young Liberals he had supported the attempted impeachment of Murray. Hain responded by quoting the 1999 Joint Committee's report, and the advice of the Clerk of the House of Commons that impeachment "effectively died with the advent of full responsible Parliamentary government".&lt;ref&gt;''[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo040909/debtext/40909-08.htm#40909-08_spnew15 Hansard]'' HC 6ser vol 424 col 871.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[election court]] has some of the powers associated with impeachment cases in other countries, and can remove elected officials from office in the case of [[electoral fraud]]. [[Lutfur Rahman (politician)|Lutfur Rahman]] was the [[directly elected mayor of Tower Hamlets]], in London until he was removed from office for breaching electoral rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tower Hamlets election fraud mayor Lutfur Rahman removed from office|publisher=[[BBC News]]|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-32428648|date=April 23, 2015|accessdate=April 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{Main|Impeachment in the United States}}

[[File:Senate in session.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The impeachment trial of President [[Bill Clinton]] in 1999, Chief Justice [[William H. Rehnquist]] presiding. The House managers are seated beside the quarter-circular tables on the left and the president's personal counsel on the right, much in the fashion of [[Impeachment of Andrew Johnson|President Andrew Johnson's trial]].]]
Similar to the British system, [[Article One of the United States Constitution]] gives the House of Representatives the sole power of impeachment and the Senate the sole power to try impeachments of [[Officer of the United States|officers of the U.S. federal government]]. (Various [[U.S. state|state]] constitutions include similar measures, allowing the state legislature to impeach the governor or other officials of the state government.) In contrast to the British system, in the United States impeachment is only the first of two stages, and conviction during the second stage requires "the concurrence of two thirds of the members present."&lt;ref name="https"&gt;{{cite book|title=U.S. Constitution. Article I, § 3, clause 6|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei#section3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Impeachment does not necessarily result in removal from office; it is only a legal statement of charges, parallel to an [[indictment]] in [[criminal law]]. An official who is impeached faces a second legislative vote (whether by the same body or another), which determines conviction, or failure to convict, on the charges embodied by the impeachment. Most constitutions require a [[supermajority]] to convict. Although the subject of the charge is criminal action, it does not constitute a criminal trial; the only question under consideration is the removal of the individual from office, and the possibility of a subsequent vote preventing the removed official from ever again holding political office in the jurisdiction where he or she was removed. Impeachment with respect to political office should not be confused with [[witness impeachment]].

====Impeachable offenses====
The Constitution defines impeachment at the federal level and limits impeachment to "The President, Vice President, and all civil officers of the United States" who may be impeached and removed only for "treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors".&lt;ref name="law.cornell.edu"&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.articleii.html#section4 U.S. Constitution, Article II, Section 4]&lt;/ref&gt; Several commentators have suggested that [[United States Congress|Congress]] alone may decide for itself what constitutes a "high crime or misdemeanor", especially since ''[[Nixon v. United States]]'' stated that the Supreme Court did not have the authority to determine whether the Senate properly "tried" a defendant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1970, then-[[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|House Minority Leader]] [[Gerald R. Ford]] defined the criterion as he saw it: "An impeachable offense is whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers it to be at a given moment in history."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ford.utexas.edu/LIBRARY/speeches/700415f.htm Gerald Ford's Remarks on the Impeachment of Supreme Court Justice William Douglas, April 15, 1970] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713115859/http://www.ford.utexas.edu/library/speeches/700415f.htm |date=July 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Officials subject to impeachment====
The central question regarding the Constitutional dispute about the impeachment of members of the legislature is whether members of Congress are officers of the United States. The Constitution grants the House the power to impeach "The President, the Vice President, and all civil Officers of the United States."&lt;ref name="law.cornell.edu"/&gt; It has been suggested that members of Congress are not officers of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=YvtLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA486&amp;lpg=PA486&amp;dq=%22members+of+Congress+are+not+officers+of+the+United+States%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22members%20of%20Congress%20are%20not%20officers%20of%20the%20United%20States%22|title=Principles of the Constitutional Law of the United States|last=Willoughby|first=Westel Woodbury|date=1917|publisher=Baker, Voorhis &amp; Company|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, however, believe that members are civil officers and are subject to impeachment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=04naCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA3196&amp;dq=%22members+of+Congress+are+officers+of+the+United+States%22+and+subject+to+impeachment#v=onepage&amp;q=%22members%20of%20Congress%20are%20officers%20of%20the%20United%20States%22%20and%20subject%20to%20impeachment|title=American International Law Cases: Fourth series|last=Oceana|date=2007|publisher=Oceana|isbn=9780195372892|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The House of Representatives impeached Senator [[William Blount]] in 1798,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Senate_Impeachment_Role.htm#4 Senate List of Impeachment trials] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5uplUoEZt?url=http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Senate_Impeachment_Role.htm |date=December 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in his expulsion. However, after initially hearing his impeachment, charges were dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=wxx-6rwQCe8C&amp;dq=%22the+first+impeachment%22&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPP1,M1 |title=The First Impeachment |author=Buckner F. Milton |year=1998 |publisher=Mercer University Press |isbn=9780865545977}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}} Left unsettled was the question whether members of Congress were civil officers of the United States. The House has not impeached a Member of Congress since Blount. As each House has the authority to expel its own members without involving the other chamber, expulsion has been the method used for removing Members of Congress.

[[Jefferson's Manual]], which is integral to the Rules of the House of Representatives,&lt;ref&gt;House Rules {{cite web|url=http://www.rules.house.gov/house_rules_precedents.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 31, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101212085230/http://www.rules.house.gov/house_rules_precedents.htm |archivedate=December 12, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; states that impeachment is set in motion by charges made on the floor, charges proferred by a memorial, a member's resolution referred to a committee, a message from the president, or from facts developed and reported by an investigating committee of the House. It further states that a proposition to impeach is a question of high privilege in the House and at once supersedes business otherwise in order under the rules governing the order of business.

====Process====
At the federal level, the impeachment process is a two-step procedure. The [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] must first pass, by a simple majority of those present and voting, articles of impeachment, which constitute the formal allegation or allegations. Upon passage, the defendant has been "impeached". Next, the [[United States Senate|Senate]] tries the accused. In the case of the impeachment of a president, the [[Chief Justice of the United States]] presides over the proceedings. For the impeachment of any other official, the Constitution is silent on who shall preside, suggesting that this role falls to the Senate's usual presiding officer, the President of the Senate who is also the [[Vice President of the United States]].

In theory at least, as President of the Senate, the [[Vice President of the United States]] could preside over their own impeachment, although legal theories suggest that allowing a defendant to be the judge in their own case would be a blatant [[conflict of interest]]. If the Vice President did not preside over an impeachment (of anyone besides the President), the duties would fall to the [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|President pro tempore of the Senate]].

To convict an accused, "the concurrence of two thirds of the members present" is required.&lt;ref name="https"/&gt; Conviction removes the defendant from office. Following conviction, the Senate may vote to further punish the individual by barring him or her from holding future federal office, elected or appointed. Conviction by the Senate does not bar criminal prosecution. Even after an accused has left office, it is possible to disqualify the person from future office or from certain emoluments of his prior office (such as a pension). If there is no charge for which a [[two-thirds majority]] of the senators present vote "guilty", the defendant is acquitted and no punishment is imposed.

====History of federal impeachment proceedings in the United States====
Congress regards impeachment as a power to be used only in extreme cases; the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] has initiated impeachment proceedings only 64 times since 1789 (most recently the 2010 impeachment, then removal from office, of Judge [[Thomas Porteous]] of the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana]]) with only the following 19 of these proceedings actually resulting in the House's passing Articles of Impeachment:

* Two presidents:
** [[Andrew Johnson]], Democrat/National Union, was [[Impeachment of Andrew Johnson|impeached]] on  February 24, 1868, by the House of Representatives after violating the newly created [[Tenure of Office Act (1867)|Tenure of Office Act]] by a  126 to 47 vote. President Johnson was acquitted by the Senate, which voted 35–19 in favor of conviction, falling one vote short of the necessary two-thirds needed to remove him from office. The Tenure of Office Act would later be found unconstitutional by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in [[obiter dictum|dicta]].
** [[Bill Clinton]], Democrat, was [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|impeached]] on December 19, 1998, by the House of Representatives on articles charging [[perjury]] (specifically, lying to a federal [[grand jury]]) by a 228–206 vote and [[obstruction of justice]] by a 221–212 vote. The House rejected other articles: one was a count of [[perjury]] in a civil deposition in [[Paula Jones]]' [[sexual harassment]] lawsuit against Clinton (by a 205–229 vote), the second accused Clinton of [[abuse of power]] (by a 148–285 vote). President Clinton was acquitted by the Senate. The votes to remove him from office fell short of the necessary two-thirds: 45–55 on obstruction of justice and 50–50 on perjury.
* [[Impeachment process against Richard Nixon|Impeachment proceedings]] against [[Richard Nixon]] were referred to the full House of Representatives for consideration and ended with his resignation.

The Senate did not bar Hastings from holding future office, and Hastings won election to the House of Representatives in Florida. Hastings' name was mentioned as a possible Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence but was passed over by House Speaker-designate [[Nancy Pelosi]], presumably because of his previous impeachment and removal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Senate_Impeachment_Role.htm |title=U.S. Senate: 1 Briefing on Impeachment |publisher=Senate.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uplUoEZt?url=http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Senate_Impeachment_Role.htm |archivedate=December 8, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''It Hits the Fan'''" is the [[South Park (season 5)|fifth season]] premiere of the American animated television series ''[[South Park]]'', and the 66th episode of the series overall. It first aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the [[United States]] on June 20, 2001. In the episode, the word "[[shit]]" is said [[Censorship|uncensored]] on television on the crime show ''Cop Drama''. After this, everyone starts saying "shit" over and over, which eventually brings on a mysterious [[plague (disease)|plague]] that unleashes the ancient Knights of [[Standards and Practices]], and only [[Chef (South Park)|Chef]] and the boys can save the world. 

The episode was written by series co-creator [[Trey Parker]] and is rated [[TV-MA]] in the United States. Throughout the episode, the profanity "shit" or "shitty" are exclaimed uncensored a total of ''162'' separate times; in syndicated or re-aired versions of this episode, a counter in the bottom left corner of the screen counts the number of times the word has been uttered. The written occurrences are not counted, but "shit" is written 38 times, which puts the "shit"s up to an even 200. On a statistical average, the word "shit" is uttered roughly once for every eight seconds of showtime; one such count includes the episode's theme song in the calculation.&lt;ref&gt;Rutenberg, Jim (June 25, 2001). " ‘South Park’ Takes Gross to New Frontier." ''The New York Times'', Section C; Column 5; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
[[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] has tickets to go to ''[[The Lion King (musical)| The Lion King on Stage]]'', but [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] tells him that the HBC crime show ''[[NYPD Blue|Cop Drama]]'' is going to use the word "[[shit]]" [[Censorship|uncensored]]. The broadcast of the show leads to widespread acceptance of the word, even in schools, causing people to use it constantly, in casual and often out of context during conversations. Furthermore, [[Ms. Choksondik]] is forced to clarify the acceptable context of the word — as a noun or adjective meaning bad, or as an exclamation of disappointment, the word is acceptable, but as a noun or adjective referring to [[feces]], it is apparently unacceptable—thoroughly confusing the children (this is a reference to the real-life [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] standards of indecency). A strange illness that causes people to spew up their [[intestine]]s and die suddenly rises in South Park, so action is taken.

Meanwhile, [[Mr. Garrison]] teaches the kindergartners not only about the word "shit," but also about the word "fag," which he is allowed to say uncensored because he is homosexual.  Later, in the local bar, he demonstrates this when he says the word uncensored, but any heterosexual who attempts to say the word is bleeped out.  Finally, Jimbo also says the word, but is not bleeped.

The boys ask [[Chef (South Park)|Chef]] to take them into the HBC Head Office to sort it out. Research proves that the word is actually a literal "curse word," and its constant utterance has caused a resurgence of the [[Black Death]]. A special live event, "[[Must See TV|Must Shit TV]]", in which episodes of existing shows are taped live with almost every word of dialogue replaced with the word "shit," goes ahead anyway until the Knights of [[Standards and Practices]] enter the studio and begin killing the actors (Drew and Mimi from ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]''). In a fit of anger for the Knights trying to stop his TV special, the head of HBC repeats the word "shit" repeatedly, causing Geldan, a demonic dragon, to awaken. After the dragon murders several on the set, Kyle destroys it with an ancient magical rune stone belonging to a knight in the mystical Order of [[Standards and Practices]]. The moral of the story is not that saying "shit" in itself is wrong but saying it in excess leads to boredom with the word. Cartman tells everyone to watch their language, which Kyle and [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] agree on. The episode ends with [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] accidentally saying "shit", spewing up his intestines and dying; Stan almost says "Holy shit!" once more but replaces it with "poop".

==Production==

Executives at [[Comedy Central]] felt the profanity was justified by context and decided to allow the uncensored episode to be broadcast, which surprised even the show's developers.&lt;ref&gt;South Park Studios FAQ, June 22, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Despite broadcasting a record-setting amount of profanity, little controversy was stirred by the transmission. Co-creator [[Matt Stone]] explained the passive reception by citing changing cultural standards, "No one cares anymore... The standards are almost gone. No one gives a shit or a bullshit." According to DVD commentary, they were only going to say it a few times, which Comedy Central would not allow. However, when Parker and Stone came up with the idea that they would "say it like 200 times, they (Comedy Central) were fine with it."

This episode was selected as #8 on Comedy Central's 2006 marathon of "10 South Parks That Changed the World".

==Reception==
In 2005, the episode was listed at #93 as part of [[TV Land]]'s "Top 100 Most Unexpected Moments in TV History".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=''TV Guide'' December 5-12, 2005 pg. 21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Home release==
"It Hits the Fan", along with the fourteen other episodes from ''South Park'''s fifth season, were released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on February 22, 2005. The sets included brief audio commentaries by Parker and Stone for each episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=South Park: The Complete Fifth Season DVD Review |publisher=Bullz-Eye |date=February 26, 2009 |last=Codding |first=Jamey  |url=http://www.bullz-eye.com/television_reviews/2001/south_park_5.htm |accessdate=April 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4441">'''Jeffrey Mark Deskovic''' (born October 27, 1973)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/jeffrey.deskovic/about]&lt;/ref&gt; was [[wrongly convicted]] in 1990 at the age of seventeen of raping, beating, and strangling Angela Correa, a 15-year-old high school classmate at [[Peekskill High School]].

==Biography==
The crime occurred on November 15, 1989 in [[Peekskill, New York]].  Correa had gone out with a portable cassette player and a camera for her photography class.  Her body was found two days later.  Although Correa and Deskovic were not close friends and Deskovic was not popular in school, Correa had been one of the few students that had been nice to him, even helping him with algebra.  Deskovic has explained that this was the reason he had cried so much during Correa's funeral.  The police, however, thought Deskovic was showing suspicious behavior. After his release from prison Deskovic explained he fabricated a story based on crime scene information police officers had fed to him during the course of the interrogation.

Deskovic also stated: ''"By the police officer's own testimony, by the end of the interrogation I was on the floor crying uncontrollably in what they described as a fetal position".''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/news/2013/aug/15/an-innocent-man-speaks-pln-interviews-jeff-deskovic]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
On December 7, 1990 a jury convicted Deskovic based on testimony from  Peekskill police detective Daniel Stephens that Deskovic had confessed to the crime. Deskovic proclaimed his innocence on numerous occasions after his conviction, but was repeatedly denied a reopening of the case by then [[district attorney]] [[Jeanine Pirro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Santos|first=Fernanda|title=DNA Evidence Frees a Man Imprisoned For Half His Life|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/21/nyregion/21dna.html?_r=0|accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since at least 2000 Deskovic also appealed to D.A. Pirro to run DNA testing to help prove his innocence. Pirro declined to run any DNA tests that could help release Deskovic from prison.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nypost.com/2006/10/15/innocent-mans-dna-plea-nixed-by-da-pirro]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the new district attorney, [[Janet DiFiore]], authorized a DNA test which led to Deskovic's exoneration. The DNA from the crime scene was matched to that of Steven Cunningham, another prison inmate who was serving a life term for another murder and later confessed to the Correa murder.  Deskovic's conviction was overturned and he was released.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news |title=DNA Evidence Frees a Man Imprisoned for Half His Life  |author=Fernanda Santos |newspaper=The New York Times |date=21 September 2006 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/21/nyregion/21dna.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeffrey Deskovic is now an advocate for reform of the criminal justice system and works to educate the public through his public speaking, published articles, and The Jeffrey Deskovic Foundation for Justice. He is a [[Mercy College (New York)|Mercy College]] alumnus.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.deskovic.org/articles/exonerated-mercy-alum-helping-others-gain-freedom/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/25/us/25jeffrey.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://theimpactnews.com/impact-now/2015/11/02/life-after-being-wrongfully-convicted-mercy-alum-jeffery-deskovics-story/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuit==

In October 2014 Deskovic won a $41.6 million lawsuit for his sixteen years of wrongful imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2014/10/jeffrey_deskovic_41_millio_wrongful_conviction_suit.php]&lt;/ref&gt;

McKeithen]], her fellow [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]].

==Biography==

After two terms in the state House, Walker was narrowly unseated in the [[general election]] held on February 1, 1972, by the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Clark Gaudin]], also of Baton Rouge. Gaudin polled 6,949 votes (51 percent) to Walker’s 6,645 (49 percent).&lt;ref&gt;State of Louisiana, Secretary of State, Election returns for state representative, February 1, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; Only the fourth Republican in the Louisiana legislature since [[Reconstruction era in the United States|Reconstruction]], Gaudin had served a partial term from 1967 to 1968, having won a [[special election]] created by the resignation of [[Luther F. Cole]],&lt;ref name=listing/&gt; who became a [[judge]] of the 19th Judicial District Court.

For most of her legislative tenure, Walker was the only woman among the 105 House members. She was the first woman legislator in Louisiana who did not succeed a husband in the office.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; In 1969, she was joined by Helen L. Laperouse of [[New Iberia, Louisiana|New Iberia]], who followed her late husband, Lionel Laperouse, Jr. And in 1971, [[Dorothy Mae Taylor]] of New Orleans  became the first [[African American]] female representative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://llwc.louisiana.gov/llwc_AboutUs.htm |title=Louisiana Legislative Women’s Caucus |publisher=llwc.louisiana.gov |accessdate=December 22, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126111748/http://llwc.louisiana.gov/llwc_AboutUs.htm |archivedate=January 26, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in her tenure, Walker persuaded Governor McKeithen to establish the Louisiana Commission on the Status of Women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wowull.com/louisiana.pdf |title=Janet Allured, "Timeline of women's movement in Louisiana" |publisher=wowull.com |accessdate=December 29, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718115338/http://www.wowull.com/louisiana.pdf |archivedate=July 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 2, 1982, more than a decade after her state House service ended, Walker was elected to the [[Louisiana Board of Elementary and Secondary Education]]. For that position, she defeated, 56-44 percent, the long-term Democratic Party chairman, [[Jesse Bankston]], also of Baton Rouge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://staticresults.sos.la.gov/11021982/11021982_17.html|title=Louisiana general election returns, November 2, 1982|publisher=staticresults.sos.la.gov|accessdate=July 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A native of [[Meridian, Mississippi|Meridian]] in [[Lauderdale County, Mississippi|Lauderdale County]] in eastern [[Mississippi]], Walker had the maiden name of "Walker" too. Her parents were Rudolph Blanche Walker and the former Maggie Elizabeth George.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; She was an alternate delegate from Louisiana to the [[1960 Democratic National Convention]], which met in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] to nominate the [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] [[Ticket (politics)|ticket]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://politicalgraveyard.com/bio/walker6.html|title=Index to Politicians, Walker, K-N|publisher=politicalgraveyard.com|accessdate=December 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; which scored an easy victory in Louisiana over the Republican [[Richard M.

In 1996, Walker was inducted into the [[Louisiana Center for Women and Government Hall of Fame]] at [[Nicholls State University]] in [[Thibodaux, Louisiana|Thibodaux]], along with the posthumous recognition of another Baton Rouge political figure, [[Betty Heitman]], co-chairwoman from 1983 to 1987 of the [[Republican National Committee]].  In 2002, she was inducted into the [[Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame]] based in the [[Chamber of Commerce]] office in [[Winnfield, Louisiana|Winnfield]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofwinnfield.com/museum.html |title=Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame |publisher=cityofwinnfield.com |accessdate=December 23, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703054258/http://cityofwinnfield.com/museum.html |archivedate=July  3, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until his death, Walker was married for fifty-six years to Edward E. Walker (1921–1998). She operated an [[Insurance|insurance agency]] in Baton Rouge. Edward Walker had to quit his job to buy the agency, as women were not then allowed to own a business of this kind in Louisiana. The Walkers' daughter, Betti Helen, formerly Betti Herlitz (born June 2, 1952), is married to Malcolm E. "Mac" Buhler (born July 1935). When the Walkers' mentally handicapped son, Edward Theodore "Eddie" Walker (born 1945), was denied entry into the public schools, Mrs. Walker entered the political arena to work for the betterment of the [[Intellectual disability|mentally retarded]] and [[Physical disability|physically handicapped]]. Her work led to the creation of the Association for Mentally Retarded Citizens. She pushed for handicapped accessibility in the [[Louisiana State Capitol]] and other public buildings. Representative Walker sponsored legislation that created a Women's Division within the Louisiana Department of Labor to foster encouragement of women in the workforce. An advocate for [[Louisiana State University]], she was made an honorary member of the LSU Alumni Association. For her work with [[special education]], Walker received the first honorary state membership in [[Delta Kappa Gamma]], an organization for women educators.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

Walker was a charter member in 1956 of the Broadmoor [[Presbyterian Church of the United States of America|Presbyterian Church]] at 9340 Florida Boulevard in Baton Rouge; she was the captain of its first building fund in 1957. She died at her home in Baton Rouge at the age of ninety-three. She is entombed at Greenoaks Mausoleum in Baton Rouge.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2491">This is a list of [[armistice]]s signed by the [[German Empire]] (1871–1918) or [[Nazi Germany]] (1933–1945). An armistice is a temporary agreement to cease hostilities. The period of an armistice may be used to negotiate a peace treaty.

*'''[[Armistice of Versailles]]''' (28 January 1871, came into effect fully by 31 January)
:Signed with the [[Third French Republic]], ended the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. A final peace, the [[Treaty of Frankfurt (1871)|Treaty of Frankfurt]], was signed on 10 May 1871.
*'''[[Armistice of Focșani]]''' (9 December 1917)
:Signed by Germany and its allies—[[Austria-Hungary]], [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]—with [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] during [[World War I]]. A final peace, the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1918)|Treaty of Bucharest]], was signed on 7 May 1918.
*'''[[Armistice between Russia and the Central Powers]]''' (15 December 1917)
:Signed by Germany and its allies—Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire—with [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] during World War I. The armistice came to an end on 18 February 1918, but the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] ending the state of war was signed on 3 March 1918.
*'''[[Armistice of 11 November 1918|Armistice of Compiègne]]''' (11 November 1918)
:Also called the Armistice of Rethondes. Signed between the [[German Revolution|German republic]] and the [[Allies of World War I|Allied and Associated Powers]], ended World War I. A final peace, the [[Treaty of Versailles]], was signed on 28 June 1919.
*'''[[Armistice of 22 June 1940|Armistice of Compiègne]]''' (22 June 1940, came into effect 25 June)
:Also called the Armistice of Rethondes. Signed, at the same location as the previous, with [[Third French Republic|France]] during [[World War II]]. No peace treaty was signed before the unconditional surrender of Germany and the establishment of the [[French Fourth Republic]]
* '''[[Invasion of Yugoslavia#Armistice and surrender|Armistice of Belgrade]]''' (17 April 1941, came into effect 18 April)
:Signed with [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] during World War II and worded as an [[unconditional surrender]]. On account of its doubtful legality, no peace treaty was signed.

Williams-Thomas was a constable and [[family liaison officer]] with [[Surrey Police]] from 1989 to 2000.&lt;ref name=Halliday/&gt;

On the 27th November 1995, school girl [[Disappearance of Ruth Wilson|Ruth Wilson]] aged 16 years went missing from her home in from [[Betchworth]], near [[Dorking]] Surrey, England. Williams-Thomas was the family liaison officer for Wilson's case, stated that extensive searches across Box Hill had yielded no evidence to suggest she was killed or committed suicide. He also stated that he was sure Wilson was not abducted by a stranger. Williams-Thomas also stated that "From the experience I have had, I would suggest one of two things occurred. She either went up there to meet someone and has subsequently gone away, or she went there and died in some way."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scepticpeg.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/img_5094.jpg|title=Fresh Appeal to Find Missing Ruth - Surrey Advertiser|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2055">The '''Military Training Act 1939''' was an [[Act of Parliament]] passed by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] on 26 May 1939, in a period of international tension that led to [[World War II]]. The Act applied to males aged 20 and 21 years old who were to be called up for six months full-time military training, and then transferred to the Reserve. There was provision for [[conscientious objector]]s. It was the UK's first act of peacetime [[conscription]] and was intended to be temporary in nature, continuing for three years unless an [[Order in Council]] declared it was no longer necessary.

On 27 April 1939, [[Leslie Hore-Belisha]], [[Secretary of State for War]], persuaded the cabinet of [[Neville Chamberlain]] to introduce a limited form of conscription as a result of the deteriorating international situation and the rise of Nazi Germany.

Men called up were to be known as 'militiamen' to distinguish them from the regular army. To emphasise this distinction, each man was issued with a [[suit (clothing)|suit]] in addition to a uniform. The intention was for the first intake to undergo six months of basic training before being discharged into an active reserve. They would then be recalled for short training periods and attend annual camps.

There was one registration under the Act, of the first cohort of liable males, on Saturday 3 June 1939, and call-up for these men followed. However, the Act was superseded on the outbreak of war in September 1939 by the [[National Service (Armed Forces) Act 1939]].

{{Professional responsibility}}
The '''Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination''' (MPRE) is a 120-minute, 60-question, multiple-choice examination designed to measure the knowledge and understanding of established standards related to a lawyer's professional conduct. It is developed by the [[National Conference of Bar Examiners]] and was first administered in 1980.

&lt;!-- {{Contradict-inline}} applies to parapraph above? --&gt;It is a prerequisite or corequisite to the [[bar examination]] for admission as an [[Attorney at law (United States)|attorney at law]] in 48 of the 50 [[U.S. state|states]] of the [[United States]], as well as the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], [[Guam]], the [[Northern Mariana Islands]], the [[United States Virgin Islands|U.S. Virgin Islands]], and the [[Palau|Republic of Palau]]. Of the 56 jurisdictions within the United States, only [[Maryland]], [[Puerto Rico]], and [[Wisconsin]] do not use the MPRE examination. However, these jurisdictions still incorporate local ethics rules in their respective bar examinations. [[Connecticut]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=State of Connecticut Judicial Branch | title=Connecticut Bar Examining Committee  | url=http://www.jud.ct.gov/cbec/faq3.htm| access-date=March 18, 2016 | quote=In lieu of the MPRE, the requirement may be satisfied with a grade of C or better in a course in professional responsibility at a law school approved by the Committee.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[New Jersey]] waive the MPRE requirement for bar candidates who have earned a grade of "C" or better in a law school course in professional ethics.

==Structure==
As of the October 2012 administration, the test consists of 60 substantive questions. Only 50 are scored; the other 10 (randomly scattered throughout the exam) are used for experimental purposes. An additional 10 survey questions at the end of the exam are used to evaluate the conditions of the testing center. The raw score is converted to a "scaled score" based on the measured difficulty of the version of the test taken; the scaled score is used to determine passing scores. Scaled scores range between 50 and 150, with a median very close to 100.

The questions are based on the [http://www.abanet.org/cpr/mrpc/mrpc_home.html ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct] and the [http://www.abanet.org/cpr/mcjc/mcjc_home.html ABA Model Code of Judicial Conduct], as well as controlling constitutional decisions and generally accepted principles established in leading federal and state cases and in procedural and evidentiary rules (courtesy American Bar Association website and National Conference of Bar Examiners MPRE website). State rules and laws which may or may not differ from the ABA rules are not tested. [[California]] uses the MPRE even though it is the only jurisdiction that has not adopted either of the two sets of professional responsibility rules proposed by the [[American Bar Association]] – and California rules differ from the ABA rules in many ways.

The MPRE differs from the remainder of the bar examination in two ways:

* Virtually all states allow bar exam candidates to take the MPRE prior to graduation from law school, as opposed to the bar examination itself which, in the great majority of states, may only be taken after receipt of a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] or [[Master of Laws|L.L.M.]] from an [[American Bar Association|ABA-accredited law school]]. 
* A bar exam candidate's MPRE score is accepted in every jurisdiction that requires it, unlike the other components of the bar examination.  

==Passing score==
The passing score varies between jurisdictions. The lowest score accepted by any jurisdiction is 75 (several). The highest required by any state is 86 ([[Utah]] and [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://admissions.calbar.ca.gov/Examinations/MultistateProfessionalResponsibilityExamination.aspx California State Bar: Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination] score of 86 effective January 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethics Exam / MPRE|url=http://barreciprocity.com/ethics-exam-mpre/|work=Database of Bar Admission and Reciprocity Rules|publisher=BarReciprocity.com|accessdate=8 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

All states have a window either preceding or surrounding the bar exam outside of which MPRE scores are not recognized.

The '''National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign''' is a current domestic government [[propaganda in the United States|propaganda]] campaign in the [[United States]] conducted by the [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]] (ONDCP) within the [[Executive Office of the President of the United States]] with the goal to "influence the attitudes of the public and the news media with respect to drug abuse" and of "reducing and preventing drug abuse among young people in the United States".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title= B-303495, Office of National Drug Control Policy — Video News Release | publisher= [[Government Accountability Office]] | date= January 4, 2005 | last= Gamboa | first= Anthony H. | pages= 9–10 | url= http://www.gao.gov/decisions/appro/303495.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Drug-Free Media Campaign Act of 1998]] of the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1999, {{USStatute|105|277|112|268|1998|10|21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]] (ONDCP) was originally established by the [[National Narcotics Leadership Act of 1988]],&lt;ref&gt;[[National Narcotics Leadership Act of 1988]] of the Anti–Drug Abuse Act of 1988, {{USStatute|100|690|102|4181|1988|11|18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title= B-303495, Office of National Drug Control Policy — Video News Release | publisher= [[Government Accountability Office]] | date= January 4, 2005 | last= Gamboa | first= Anthony H. | at= footnote 6, page 3 | url= http://www.gao.gov/decisions/appro/303495.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; which mandated a national anti-drug propaganda campaign for youth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act of 1998]], {{USPL|105|61}}, {{USStat|111|1272}}, at {{USStat|111|1294}}&lt;/ref&gt; These activities subsequently funded by the [[Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act of 1998]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act of 1998]], {{USPL|105|61}}, {{USStat|111|1272}}&lt;/ref&gt; formally creating the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title= GAO-06-818, ONDCP Media Campaign: Contractor’s National Evaluation Did Not Find That the Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign Was Effective in Reducing Youth Drug Use | publisher= [[Government Accountability Office]] | date= August 2006 | page= 1 | url= http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d06818.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Drug-Free Media Campaign Act of 1998]] codified the propaganda campaign at {{USC|21|1708}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[Drug-Free Media Campaign Act of 1998]] (Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1999), {{USStatute|105|277|112|268|1998|10|21}}, at {{USStat|112|2681}}-2752&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
In August 2001, the office told a Congressional committee that its National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign "has been the most visible symbol of the federal government's commitment to drug prevention," and that the office was "investing $7 million a year in performance measurement to determine the effectiveness" of the campaign. The statement said "We believe there is a strong body of evidence that indicates the campaign is working, as planned, to change drug attitudes, intentions and use."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/NEWS/testimony01/080101/content.html "National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign: How to Ensure the Program Operates Efficiently and Effectively"], Testimony to Congress, August 1, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, according to a multi-year study by the research firm hired by the office, teenagers exposed to federal anti-drug ads were no less likely to use drugs for having viewed them, and some young girls said they were even more likely to give drugs a try. Walters blamed poor ads that weren't resonating with teenagers. Walters promised in Senate testimony in 2002 that he would show results within a year or admit failure, and Congress agreed to extend the campaign through 2003 while cutting funding for the ads from $170 million in 2002 to $150 million in 2003. An entirely new advertising campaign was created.&lt;ref&gt;Shawn Zeller, [http://www.govexec.com/features/0903/0903s3.htm "Ads, Drugs &amp; Money"], ''Government Executive'' magazine, September 19, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2005, a research company hired by the office and the [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]] reported that the government's ad campaign aimed at dissuading teens from using marijuana, a campaign that cost $1.4 billion between 1998 and 2006, did not work: "greater exposure to the campaign was associated with weaker anti-drug norms and increases in the perceptions that others use marijuana." The research company was paid $42.7 million for the five-year study. After the February 2005 report was received, the office continued the ad campaign, spending $220 million on the anti-marijuana ads in fiscal years 2005 and 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ryan Grim]], ''[http://www.slate.com/id/2148999/ A White House Drug Deal Gone Bad: Sitting on the Negative Results of a Study of Anti-Marijuana Ads]'', ''Slate'' magazine, September 7, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

President Bush's goal in this campaign was to reduce youth drug use by 10% over two years, and 25% over 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=108_house_hearings&amp;docid=f:87450.pdf|title=ONDCP Reauthorization: The National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign|publisher=US Government Printing Office|accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Survey of Parent and Youth (NSPY) was instituted and funded by congress to monitor and assess the NYADMC's effects on youth.&lt;ref name = journal&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scheier|first=Lawrence M.|author2=Grenard, Jerry L.|title=Influence of a National Social Marketing Campaign on Adolescent Youth|journal=Journal of Health and Comminucation|date=1 April 2010|volume=15|pages=240–271|doi=10.1080/10810731003686580|url=http://web.ebscohost.com.silk.library.umass.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=da7d4ce1-a2db-43e8-a5f4-4e1728906b8f%40sessionmgr11&amp;vid=6&amp;hid=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the advertisements themselves were only as specific as to address use of marijuana, the NSPY measurements reported alcohol consumption, binge drinking, cigarette use, and use of marijuana/hashish. The assessment consisted of multiple rounds of strategic questioning between years 2000 and 2004 to determine youths exposure to the advertisements, and behavioral patterns in relation to marijuana use. 
94% of youth (ages 12.5-18) reported exposure to at least 1 anti-drug message per month. Those sampled didn't change marijuana usage over the time period measured. Youths claiming to have used marijuana within the past year in 2000 accounted for 17.1% in 2000, and dropped as little as .4% to 16.7% in 2004.  However, there was a .4% increase in those claiming to have used marijuana within the past 30 days, rising from 7.8% to 8.2% between 2000 and 2004. There are also evidence of pro-marijuana lagged association effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hornik|first=Robert|author2=Lela Jacobson |author3=Robert Orwin |author4=Andrea Piesse |author5=Graham Kalton |title=Effects of the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign on Youths|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=December 2008|volume=98|series=12|pages=2229–2236|url=http://ajph.aphapublications.org/cgi/reprint/98/12/2229|doi=10.2105/ajph.2007.125849|pmc=2636541}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of acceleration in use was quicker at among 14- to 18-year-olds than at earlier stages of teenage years.&lt;ref name = journal/&gt;

Not only do data indicate the ineffectiveness of much anti-drug advertising, results also point to behavioral reactions in the opposite direction, or a boomerang effect,  where greater exposure to the campaign, resulted to increased use of marijuana. Of those unexposed to ads on a given month, 81%  did not intend to use marijuana, That percentage decreased for youth exposed to 1-3 ads per month, to 79% and dropped to 78% among those exposed to more than 4 advertisements per month. Also measured, were attitudes such as 'anti-marijuana attitudes/beliefs' and 'anti-marijuana social norms'. Both of these index's portray declining percentages with increased exposure to ads.  Anti-marijuana publicity, may have stimulated the notion that “‘everyone’s doing it,’” therefore heightenening the appeal of using marijuana, as a popular practice.
The ads had an unintended positive impact on perceptions towards marijuana use as they portrayed benefits within the context of using marijuana. This association was strengthened with repeat exposure. Images that lead to such impressions included focusing on the "good-times" people were having while on drugs, happily socializing. These impressions heightened the appeal of marijuana, thus making people more likely to initiate use, or increase use.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Jacobsohn | first = Lela | title = The Role of Positive Outcome Expectancies in Boomerang Effects of the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign | date = January 1, 2007 | accessdate = 2011-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Youth's beliefs and behaviors were also affected by those of their older siblings. Since older brothers and sisters were more interested in using marijuana after seeing the ads, the campaign had an indirect effect on younger siblings as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last = Hornik | first = Robert | title = Personal Influence and the Effects of the National Youth Antidrug Media Campaign | date = January 1, 2006 | accessdate = 2011-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NYADMC achieved some of its favorable effects with regard to reaching their message to the parents of youth. Parent's behavior and beliefs indicate greater likeliness to engage children in fun activities, talk about drugs, and responsiveness to the idea of monitoring their children's behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Orwin | first = Robert | title = Evaluation of the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign 2004 Report of Findings, Executive Summary | date = June 2006 | url = https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/abstractdb/AbstractDBDetails.aspx?id=236869}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), the institution that administered the campaign, the campaign was overall successful. The ONDCP's independent studies indicate that "youth exposed to Above the Influence are more likely to initiate drug use." exposure to the ads.&lt;ref name=Thing&gt;{{cite web|title=Campaign Effectiveness|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/Campaign-Effectiveness-and-Rigor|publisher=The White House|accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another similar media initiative, called "Be Under Your Own Influence" ran from 2005 to 2009, which results indicate that it was effective, to a lesser extent than the Above the Influence campaign, which was running concurrently. The plausible explanation for this is that they already had been influenced by the ATI, such that the Be Under Your Own Influence campaign was repeating a message that had already been established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Slater|first=Michael D.|author2=Kathleen J.

The campaign launched a result-tracking initiative to comprise the Annual Analysis Report to Congress, as required by the Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 2006.

'''Partible inheritance''' is a system of [[inheritance]] in which property is apportioned among [[heir]]s. It contrasts in particular with [[primogeniture]] (common in [[feudal]] society), which requires that the whole or most of the inheritance passes to the eldest son, and with [[agnatic seniority]] where the succession passes to next senior male.

Partible inheritance systems are therefore common ones to be found, in both [[Common Law]] and [[Napoleonic Code]]-based systems; in the latter case, there may be further requirement implying division according to a scheme, such as equal shares for legitimate children.

Partible inheritance has been common in ancient [[Celts|Celtic]] and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribal societies; an example of this pattern is so-called [[Salic patrimony]].
Historically speaking, non-partible inheritance has been associated with [[monarchies]], and the wish that landed [[Estate (house)|estate]]s be kept together as units. In the [[Middle Ages]], the partible inheritance systems of (for example) the [[Carolingian Empire]] and [[Kievan Rus]] had the effect of dividing ''kingdoms'' into ''princely'' states and are often thought responsible for their decline of power.

Partible inheritance was the generally accepted form of inheritance adopted by New Englanders in the 18th century. The southern colonies adopted a system of [[male primogeniture]] in cases of [[intestacy]], while the northern colonies adopted a system of partible inheritance in cases of intestacy, with the eldest son receiving a double portion of the estate. In practice, a strong [[bequest]] motive in the colonies adopting multigeniture reduced the variability in demographic experiences across colonies with different inheritance systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alston|first=Lee J.|last2=Schapiro|first2=Morton Owen|date=June 1984|title=Inheritance Laws Across Colonies: Laws and Consequences|url=http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/Econ_Articles/Estates/Alston_Schapiro.pdf|journal=The Journal of Economic History|volume=44|issue=2|pages=277-287|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1814 [[Miles MacDonell|Governor Miles MacDonell]], appointed by [[Thomas Douglas, 5th Earl of Selkirk]] issued to the inhabitants of the [[Red River of the North|Red River]] area a proclamation which became known as the '''Pemmican Proclamation'''.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;!-- this ref was in the wrong place earlier but i can't access the article to know where it should go; making a best guess --&gt; The proclamation was issued in attempt to stop the Métis people from exporting pemmican out of the Red River district. [[Cuthbert Grant]], leader of the [[Métis]], disregarded MacDonell's proclamation and continued the exportation of pemmican to the [[North West Company]].&lt;ref name="Red River Settlement 2007"&gt;"The Metis and the Red River Settlement."

==Synopsis==
The Proclamation defined the borders of the lands ceded to Lord Selkirk by the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] over which Miles MacDonell had been appointed Governor.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

The proclamation next outlined the reasons and the means by which the governor would control the flow of food, mostly [[pemmican]] from the area.

==Sources==
The Proclamation was submitted as evidence during the '''Pemmican War Trials''' held in Montreal in 1818.&lt;ref name="pemmican war trials"/&gt; and published in the: Report of trials in the courts of Canada, relative to the destruction of the Earl of Selkirk's settlement on the Red River With observations (p.&amp;nbsp;61-62) by [[Andrew Amos (lawyer)|Amos Andrew]] in 1820.

==The Proclamation==

{{quote|"Whereas the Governor and Company of Hudson's Bay, have ceded to the Right Honourable Thomas Earl of Selkirk, his heirs and successors, for ever, all that tract of land or territory, bounded by a line running as follows, viz:--Beginning on the western shore of the Lake Winnipic, at a point in fifty-two degrees and thirty minutes north latitude; and thence running due west to the Lake Winipigashish, otherwise called Little Winnipic; then in a southerly direction through the said lake, so as to strike its western shore in latitude fifty-two degrees; then due west to the place where the parallel of fifty-two degrees north latitude, intersects the western branch of Red River, otherwise called Ossiniboine River; then due south from that point of intersection to the height of land which separates the waters running into Hudson's Bay from those of the Mississouri and Mississippi Rivers; then in an easterly direction along the height of land to the source of the River Winnipic, (meaning by such last named river the principal branch of the waters which unite in the Lake Ságinagas,) thence along the main stream of those waters and the middle of the several lakes through which they pass, to the mouth of the Winnipic River; and thence in a northerly direction through the middle of the Lake Winnipic, to the place of beginning. Which territory is called Ossiniboia, and of which I, the undersigned, have been duly appointed Governor.

And whereas, the welfare of the families, at present forming Settlements on the Red River, within the said Territory, with those on the way to it, passing the winter at York and Churchill Forts in Hudson's Bay; as also those who are expected to arrive next autumn; renders it a nece-sary and indispensable part of my duty to provide for their support; in the yet uncultivated state of the country, the ordinary resources derived from the buffalo and other wild animals hunted within the Territory, are not deemed more than adequate for the requisite supply. Wherefore, it is hereby ordered, that no persons trading in furs or provisions within the Territory, for the Honourable Hudson’s Bay Company, or the North-West Company, or any individual, or unconnected traders or persons whatever, shall take out any provisions, either of flesh, fish, grain, or vegetable, procured or raised within the Territory, by water or land carriage, for one twelvemonth from the date hereof; save and except what may be judged necessary for the trading parties at this present time within the Territory, to carry them to their respective destinations; and who may, on due application to me, obtain a license for the same. The provisions procured and raised as above shall be taken for the use of the colony; and that no loss may accrue to the parties concerned, they will be paid for by British bills at the customary rates. And be it hereby further made known, that whosoever shall be detected in attempting to convey out, or shall aid and assist in carrying out, or attempting to carry out, any provisions prohibited as above, either by water or land,  shall be taken into custody, and prosecuted as the laws in such cases direct; and the provisions so taken, as well as any goods and chattels, of what nature soever, which may be taken along with them, and also the craft, carriages and cattle instrumental in conveying away the same to any part, but to the Settlement on Red River, shall be forfeited.

Given under my hand at Fort Daer, (Pembina,) the 8th day of January, 1814.

== Background ==
“In order to expand their food supply, fur companies traded large quantities of dried bison meat and fat in fall and early winter to produce at their posts blocks of pemmican (pronounced “pimigan” in the Cree), a word meaning “he makes grease.” An energy-rich, cheap food source, pemmican consisted of pounded dried meat, soft fat (unsaturated fats derived from bone marrow) and hard fat (saturated fats taken from body fat and converted into tallow), bosses (fatty hump meat), and/or dépouille (strips of fat that lay along the spine of the animal). Although Indians produced some pemmican and traded it directly to European posts, more commonly, British commerce came to depend on pemmican mass-produced by Europeans at their own posts.”&lt;ref name="colpitts179"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Colpitts|first=George|date=2012|title=Provisioning the HBC:: Market Economies in the British Buffalo Commons in the Early Nineteenth Century|jstor=westhistquar.43.2.0179|journal=Western Historical Quarterly|volume=43|issue=2|pages=179–203|doi=10.2307/westhistquar.43.2.0179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pemmican became the main source of food throughout the Bison trade nearing the end of the eighteenth century. The Hudson’s Bay Company relied on the food to provide a source of energy for their fur-traders who had relocated to areas that had a scarce food supply but plenty of fur.&lt;ref name="colpitts179"/&gt; By the mid-1790s the first systems of small wintering posts had become massive food depots, with Montreal companies organizing depots in the Red River Valley.&lt;ref name="colpitts179"/&gt; The Hudson’s Bay Company grew concerned during the turn of the century because their rival, the North West Company, was providing trappers in the north with enough Pemmican to allow them to specialize their hunting patterns to cater to the English trading posts rather than the HBC.&lt;ref name="morton157"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morton|first=W. L.|date=1966|title=The North West Company: Pedlars Extraordinary|jstor=20177856|journal=Minnesota History|volume=40|issue=4|pages=157–165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“ The impact of the European factory system on traditional pemmican production has yet to be fully studied, especially at carryover places and between watersheds where large communities of indigenous people gathered. Indeed, it became so commonplace for woodland hunters to visit and even inhabit trade routes and major transshipment points where they might gain access to the plains-trade pemmican stockpiled there that the HBC eventually outlawed its crews from making such exchanges and sternly rebuked traders who made it available around their posts.”&lt;ref name="colpitts179"/&gt;

The early nineteenth century saw competition increase between food trading companies in and around the Red River settlement. This led to a steep increase in Pemmican prices, which would become a problem in 1811 when winter conditions became extremely harsh. By 1813, companies instructed their traders to offer Native hunters “extraordinary payment” for hunting beyond their specific provisions.&lt;ref name="colpitts179"/&gt;

“Competition over the trade, poor winters, and hunters burning the plains escalated prices and, in the end, contributed to one of Rupert’s Land’s more chaotic turns in 1814 with the advent of the “Pemmican Wars”—where the Selkirk settlers, under the Pemmican Proclamation, attempted to regulate and control pemmican production by rival companies.21 This very issue sparked the bloody Battle of Seven Oaks in 1816: Métis clashed with settlers who had earlier seized and now competed for the high-priced food supplies of the NWC coming from the Assiniboine River.”&lt;ref name="colpitts179"/&gt;

A major contributor to the controversy surrounding the Red River Settlement was the purchasing of Hudson’s Bay Company shares by Thomas Douglas, the 5th Lord of Selkirk. Douglas, in an attempt to provide new opportunities for Scottish settlers, purchased enough shares from the HBC to be granted a large land settlement in the Red River. Conflict arose from the situation because not only was Douglas granted a massive chunk of the Red River Settlement but he did not want trade to profit the rival North West Company, which led to the Lord of Selkirk cutting off the Metis inhabiting &amp;nbsp;the Red River colony and interfering with NWC trade routes. The harsh living conditions and scarcity of food would eventually lead to Douglas’ reliance on the Metis and the introduction of the Pemmican Proclamation, considering the ties he had severed with those he now depended on in the area.&lt;ref name="carter60"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carter|first=George E.|date=1968|title=Lord Selkirk and the Red River Colony|jstor=4517222|journal=Montana: The Magazine of Western History|volume=18|issue=1|pages=60–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Proclamation was submitted as evidence during the '''Pemmican War Trials''' held in Montreal in 1818.[[Pemmican Proclamation#cite note-pemmican war trials-6|&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] and published in the: Report of trials in the courts of Canada, relative to the destruction of the Earl of Selkirk's settlement on the Red River With observations (p.&amp;nbsp;61-62) by [[Andrew Amos (lawyer)|Amos Andrew]] in 1820.

== Pemmican Trade ==
For the settlers living near the Red River on the edge of the prairie, the Pemmican Trade was an important source of trade for the Red River Valley, almost comparable to what the beaver-pelt trade did for the Natives farther north. This trade was a major factor in the emergence of a distinct Métis society. &amp;nbsp;[[Métis buffalo hunt#Pemmican trade|Pemmican]] was made of dried buffalo meat pounded into a powder and mixed with melted buffalo fat in leather bags. Packs of pemmican would be shipped north and stored at the major fur posts. Ultimately, as the Pemmican trade began to establish its position within the Red River and other parts of the prairies, the Hudson’s Bay Company (HBC) and North West Company (NWC).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rich|first=E.|date=1960|title=rade Habits and Economic Motivation Among Indians of North America|url=|journal=Journal of Economic and Political Science|volume=2635-53|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To procure pemmican in sufficient quantities, the HBC and NWC traded for it at several outposts in the Red River District and shipped it to their [[Bas de la Rivière]] depot on Lake Winnipeg where it was distributed to brigades of north canoes passing between [[Fort William, Ontario|Fort William]] and [[Athabasca Country|Athabasca]] or transported to Fort William where it was issued to brigades going to the company’s eastern and southern districts. The majority of the NWC’s pemmican was purchased from the local Métis and to a lesser degree from the local First Nations people and freemen.The pemmican, which forms the staple article of produce from the summer hunt, is a species of food peculiar to [[Rupert's Land]]. It is composed of buffalo meat, dried and pounded fine, and mixed with an amount of [[tallow]] or buffalo fat equal to itself in bulk.The tallow having been boiled, is poured hot from the caldron into an oblongbag, manufactured from the buffalo hide, into which the pounded meat has previously been placed. The contents are then stirred together until they havebeen thoroughly well mixed. When full, the bag is sewed up and laid in store.Each bag when full weighs one hundred pounds. It is calculated that, on anaverage, the carcass of each buffalo will yield enough pemmican to fill one bag&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Red River|last=Hargrave|first=Joseph|publisher=Harvard Library|year=1871|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, the pemmican trade was a major factor for the expanding provisions that were being streamlined and developed within the Red River Area, as well as Winnipeg and other parts of the Prairies located between Manitoba and Saskatchewan. The two Major trading companies which were the Hudson’s Bay Company and North-West Company began establishing various territories and boundaries where they could exercise the Pemmican trade. Both the HBC and the NWC needed to establish their trade routes in the area to secure the economic benefits of Pemmican. Therefore, the need to establish a trade route led to conflict between the Hudson’s Bay Company and the North West Company that erupted in 1812.

"In 1812, the Hudson’s Bay Company established the Selkirk agricultural colony on the banks of the Red River. This posed a strategic threat to the North West Company since the colony lay astride its provision supply line in that quarter. The seriousness of the danger was manifest in the winter of 1814. The colony was seriously short of provisions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raty|first=Arthur J.|date=2008|title=The Northern Great Plains: Pantry of the Northwestern Fur Trade, 1774–1885|url=|journal=University of Regina|volume=61|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The need for the North West Company and Hudson’s Bay Company to establish a suitable route of transportation for the Pemmican trade would be vital in securing economic prosperity. The Red River was beginning to see an increase in settlements and trading posts erecting in the area, as the Red River served as a vital mode of transportation. The NWC had previously built a strong relationship with the Metis, and ultimately the NWC positioned themselves as defenders of the Natives and Métis, and thus became opponents of the HBC colonization scheme that would illegally dispossess the native peoples. Furthermore, it was vital for these companies to secure an alliance when trading Pemmican because the native expertise in buffalo hunting would serve as the most productive way obtaining Pemmican ingredients.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Also, since there had been a food shortage in these areas since 1776, Pemmican became a prominent source of food in the Red River settlements. Pemmican would be an important food source during the winter months and would serve as an offset or back-up to inconsistent crop-growth within settlements. With the food shortage however came an increase in the price and trade of Pemmican.

"In such circumstances, Indian suppliers drove up prices on provisions offered to Europeans. While volumes increased to meet European demands by the turn of the century, so did the traded value, or price, of these commodities, especially in areas hard hit by changing game conditions. In 1801 intense local competition between traders raised prices overall. Lower Red River outfits, by then supplying massive amounts of food to the trading companies, priced depot pemmican at an astronomical shilling per pound—in better circumstances, Europeans could get it for a quarter or less than that".&lt;ref name="colpitts179"/&gt;

The increased price of Pemmican, combined with the food shortage and tensions between the settlement of HBC and NWC territories ultimately developed into conflict. Tensions erupted in the end, which contributed to one of Rupert’s Land more chaotic turns in 1814 with “The Pemmican Proclamation,” which attempted to regulate and control pemmican production by rival companies. This very issue sparked the bloody Battle of Seven Oaks in 1816, which saw the Métis clash with settlers who had earlier seized and now competed for the high-priced food supplies of the NWC coming from the Assiniboine River.

== Impact of the Pemmican Proclamation (The Pemmican War) ==
The Pemmican Proclamation was a key factor in the onslaught of the [[Pemmican War]] that took place from 1812-1821. During the [[Pemmican War]], the [[Métis in Canada|Métis]] suffered immensely and had a tough time legally hunting for food. Carolyn Podruchny, author of the book ''Contours of People: Metis Family, Mobility and History'' notes the Metis struggled to during the [[Pemmican War]] to survive stating “ the Winter of 1814-15 was a difficult one as the Metis buffalo hunters were increasingly hostile to the colony”.&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=GjGHIOxOCBMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_atb&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Contours of a People: Metis Family, Mobility, and History|last=MacDougall|first=Brenda|last2=St-Onge|first2=Nichole|last3=Podruchny|first3=Carolyn|date=2012-12-04|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=9780806188171|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;sub&gt;One of the many issues which arose during the Pemmican Proclamation was the [[Battle of Seven Oaks]]. The [[Pemmican War]] worsened the relationship of white European settlers in Canada and the Metis. Lyle Dick, author of the article “The Seven Oaks Incident and the Construction of a Historical &amp;nbsp;Tradition, 1860-1970”, notes the [[Battle of Seven Oaks|Seven Oaks Incident]] of 1816 was a direct result of the [[Pemmican War]]. Dick further suggest the Pemmican War played a minor role in motivating the Red River Rebellion of 1870.&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;sub&gt;The [[Battle of Seven Oaks|Seven Oaks Incident]] occurred on June 1816, as a violent clash took place between a group of [[Hudson's Bay Company|Hudson Bay Company]] Officers and Selkirk Settlers vs. a party of Metis traders from the [[Red River of the North|Red River]] and the Upper Assiniboine.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dick|first=Lyle|date=1991|title=The Seven Oaks Incident and the Construction of a Historical Tradition, 1816 to 1970|url=https://www.erudit.org/fr/revues/jcha/1991-v2-n1-jcha998/031029ar.pdf|journal=|volume= 2|pages=91–113|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;sub&gt;Currently in Canada, there is a large debate to as who instigated the [[Battle of Seven Oaks|Seven Oaks Incident.]] Lyle Dick notes that reportedly, the first shot was fired by the Metis, however Contemporary Commissioner [[William Coltman]] was sent by lower Canada (which is Now Quebec) to investigate the dispute between HBC/Selkirk settlers and the Metis, and came to a different conclusion. Commissioner Coltman stated the first shot was fired by the HBC/ Selkirk Settlers, and the Metis most likely reacted in self defense.&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;sub&gt;The aftermath of the confrontation between the two groups left The HBC/ Selkirk Settlers with 21 deaths and one survivor, whereas the Metis only had one man killed. [[Robert Semple (Canada)|Robert Semple]], Governor of Assiniboia was killed in the gunfire.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; &lt;sub&gt;Which group fired the first shot is still a debated subject among scholars, however Lyle Dick notes it has been dubbed “The Seven Oaks Massacre” by scholar of the time period George Bryce in 1870.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; &lt;sub&gt;The notion the [[Battle of Seven Oaks]] was a massacre was a new “master narrative” of Western progress in 1870, which depicts Metis as savage villains, and white European settlers as the unanimous hero or victim.&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;sub&gt;The Pemmican Proclamation&lt;nowiki/&gt;was a main reason the [[Battle of Seven Oaks]] to take place and is one of many confrontations between the Metis and white settler Europeans. The Pemmican Proclamation also led to European’s control of the pemmican market in the 1820’s. The price of pemmican during the [[Pemmican War]] was kept low until small amounts of buffalo or meat could be found, when pemmican prices would grow causing many issues for Metis. George Coltpitts, author of the article “ Market Economies in the British Buffalo Commons in the Early Nineteenth Century”, notes these changes stating “In the earlier provisions trade, local Indian hunters clearly controlled the hunt and the price of provisions on the market. Indians demanded ever-higher prices from British traders for their products, including dried meats, fats, and pemmican. But with the amalgamation of British fur trade companies in 1821, almost all plains hunters inhabiting the large territories of the Blackfoot Nations (Kainai, Siksika, and Piikani), the Atsina (Gros Ventre), the Assiniboine-Nakota, and the Plains Cree lost bargaining power to a consolidated and systematic provisions buyer. By the 1830s, pemmican cost the equivalent of 2 pence per pound (d/lb), a price at least four times lower than it had been three decades earlier. Prices remained remarkably low across vast stretches of the British North American territories and stayed that way until the depleted herds could no longer feed the thousands of indigenous people and newcomers dependent upon them. Occasionally, regional game depletion or bad hunting weather limited the supply of raw materials needed to make pemmican; short supply tipped the market advantage to the Indians, who raised prices to meet increasing demand for their products. But by the late 1820s, HBC managers developed a standing order system and a region-wide buying strategy that stabilized the market and significantly undermined Indian bargaining power. The HBC in turn enjoyed an enviable advantage as a consumer of pemmican; it progressively enlarged its purchases and use of this cheapened energy source”.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name="colpitts179"/&gt; &lt;sub&gt;The Pemmican Proclamation caused many issues for the Metis and aboriginal population of Canada for many years after its legislation was passed.



During the late 1790s and heading into the turn of the century, pemmican became a leading source of food throughout the fur trading monopolies. This transition to pemmican began because it was a source of energy that could be stored and preserved for long periods of time, which allowed fur traders to venture beyond designated areas to find game because of this new unspoiled food.&lt;ref name="colpitts179"/&gt; From first establishing small food systems to organizing massive food depots, companies began to realize that they could heavily profit from an entirely European run production of pemmican.&lt;ref name="morton157"/&gt; A major step towards this transition to a European system was the involvement of Thomas Douglas, 5th Lord of Selkirk. Douglas had a strong desire to relocate poor Scottish immigrants to profitable land settlements. The Red River and the pemmican industry would have been perfect for the Lord of Selkirk and his colonizers because Douglas had used his fortune to purchase enough HBC shares to be granted land in the Red River Settlement. This meant the Lord of Selkirk’s men (he promised 200 annually to the HBC) could take over the pemmican production, stop the Metis from supplying the NWC, and interrupt fur trades routes of rival company trappers.&lt;ref name="carter60"/&gt; He did not plan for the extreme weather conditions and scarcity of food because of said conditions that would come in the years of 1811-1813. This would lead to the settlers’ dependence on the Metis for survival and the Pemmican Proclamation that would ban the export of pemmican from the Red River Settlement to avoid starvation. This would be the beginnings of the Pemmican War that would ensue shortly after.{{citationneeded|date=July 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1909">In [[law|legal disputes]] regarding [[product liability]], a '''risk-utility test''' is used to determine whether a product's design or warning is defective, thereby making the manufacturer [[Legal liability|liable]] for injuries caused by its product.

The manufacturer is held liable under the risk-utility test if the probability of injury times the gravity of injury under the current product design is more than the cost of an alternative reasonable design plus the diminished utility resulting from modifying the design.  More simply, the court considers if the [[economic]] costs (determined from likely [[lawsuit]]s) are higher than the cost of changing the product design (ex: installing a plastic guard) plus the loss of use of the product (ex: the new guard makes it harder to use the product). Generally, the simplest way to think of the risk-utility test is the [[Calculus of negligence|Hand Formula]] applied to products.

The Third Restatement of the Law, Torts: Products Liability §2(b)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Restatement (Third) of Torts, Product Liability|location=§2(b)|edition=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; favors the risk-utility test over the Second Restatement of the Law, Torts §402(a), which favored the [[Consumer expectations test]]. §2(b) states, in part, "A product is defective when, at the time of sale or distribution...is defective in design. A product is defective in design when the foreseeable risks of harm posed by the product could have been reduced or avoided by the adoption of a reasonable alternative design by the seller or other distributor, or a predecessor in the commercial chain of distribution, and the omission of the alternative design renders the product not reasonably safe."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3796">In March 2006, six plainclothes agents of [[Mexico]]'s [[Federal Investigations Agency]] (AFI) '''raided a market in Santiago Mexquititlán''', [[Querétaro]], in search of unauthorized copies of copyrighted works.  The agents later alleged that they were held hostage by vendors during the raid.

== Allegations of kidnapping ==

During the raid, the six AFI agents were cornered by a number of unarmed vendors in protest.  The agents later claimed that the vendors demanded a ransom to let them go.  Local witnesses to the incident denied any ransom demand was made.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Jacinta Francisco Marcial ==

Jacinta Francisco Marcial, an indigenous [[Otomi people|Otomí]] woman, sold ice cream in Santiago Mexquititlán's predominantly indigenous [[tianguis]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The six AFI agents who conducted the raid implicated Francisco Marcial after they were shown a newspaper photograph depicting her walking near a group of protesting vendors.  In August 2006, four months after the raid, she was arrested for the alleged kidnapping.  She was later convicted and sentenced to twenty-one years' imprisonment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Amnesty International]] denounced Francisco Marcial's imprisonment as resulting from a [[wrongful prosecution]].  The group declared her a [[prisoner of conscience]], claiming there was no credible evidence against her, and that she had been prosecuted because of her gender, poverty, race, and inability to speak or understand the Spanish language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/44000/amr410412009eng.pdf|title=Release Jacinta Marcial: Case Sheet|last=|first=|date=June 2009|website=Amnesty International|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Portal|Organized labour}}
A '''side letter''' or '''side agreement''' is a [[collective bargaining]] agreement that is not part of the underlying or primary [[collective bargaining agreement]] (CBA) which the parties to the [[contract]] use to reach agreement on issues the CBA does not cover, to clarify issues in the CBA, or to modify the CBA (permanently or temporarily).  One may distinguish side letters from "side settlements" or "settlement agreements", which settle a dispute arising from the underlying CBA.&lt;ref name="CooperTire"&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data2/circs/6th/054641p.pdf ''United Steelworkers of America v. Cooper Tire &amp; Rubber Company],'' [[case citation|474 F.3d 271]] (6th Cir. 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; In rare cases, bargaining parties may use a side letter to adjust the focus of the contract if the parties are not yet ready or willing to adapt the contract formally.&lt;ref&gt;Kaboolian, Linda, and Sutherland, Paul. ''Win-Win Labor-Management Collaboration in Education: Breakthrough Practices to Benefit Students, Teachers, and Administrators.'' Bethesda, Maryland: Education Week Press, 2005. {{ISBN|0-9674795-4-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the law of contracts, a side letter has the same force as the underlying contract.&lt;ref name="CooperTire" /&gt; However, the courts may invalidate side letters in conflict with the main collective bargaining agreement.&lt;ref&gt;"Eighth Circuit Invalidates Side Letter Agreement Conflicting With Collective Bargaining Agreement". ''Benefits &amp; Compensation Legal &amp; Legislative Reporter.'' October 2004; ''Trustees of the Graphic Communication International Union, Local 1B Health and Welfare Fund "A" v. Tension Envelope Corporation,'' [[case citation|374 F.3d 633]] (8th Cir. 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; The terms of the CBA govern interpretation of side letters.  In the United States, several [[United States courts of appeals|appellate courts]] have held that in disputes where side letters do not contain [[conflict resolution]] procedures, the parties must use the underlying collective bargaining agreement's dispute resolution mechanism (in these cases, [[arbitration]]) to resolve the dispute.&lt;ref name="CooperTire" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/tmp/FH0OGU6E.pdf ''United Steelworkers v. Trimas Corporation]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }},'' No. 07-1688 (7th Cir. July 3, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dube"&gt;Dube, Lawrence E. "Court Orders Arbitration on Neutrality Pact, But Says NLRB May Have to Decide Legality". ''Daily Labor Report.'' September 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The range of issues side letters covers is wide. In some cases, side letters have driven national [[labour law]] policy. For example, in the United States, a side letter guaranteeing employer neutrality during union elections in newly acquired plants, subsidiaries, or divisions led to a federal lawsuit over the legality of the agreement in 2002 and a major decision by the [[National Labor Relations Board]] revising federal labour policy in 2007.&lt;ref name="Dube" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Int'l Union v. Dana Corp.,'' [[case citation|278 F.3d 548]] (6th Cir. 2002); Gross, Jared S. "Recent Developments: International Union v. Dana Corp." ''Ohio State Journal on Dispute Resolution.'' 2003; Moody, Kim. [http://www.labornotes.org/node/1485 "'Card Check' Takes a Hit"]. ''Labor Notes.'' January 2008; Barker, Joseph A. "Keeping Neutrality Agreements Neutral". ''Michigan Bar Journal.''

''U.S. Law Week.'' October 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Australia]], side letters are becoming increasingly common due to the changes in federal labour law the [[WorkChoices]] Act created. WorkChoices limits the collective bargaining agreements that parties can register for eligibility for workplace tribunals enforcement, and also requires CBAs be strictly limited to work-related issues. The inclusion of even minor non-workplace-related clauses (such as dues check-off) can render a CBA unenforceable. In response, many unions and employers are using side letters to reach agreement on non-workplace-related matters, and not registering these side-letters with the federal government—relying on [[common law]] to enforce the side letters.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Andrew and Riley, Joellen.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2357">The '''Slave Compensation Act 1837''' (1 &amp; 2 Vict. c. 3) was an [[Act of Parliament]] in the United Kingdom, signed into law on 23 December 1837.

[[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|After decades of campaigning]], the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|Slavery Abolition Act]] had been passed in 1833. The [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|plantation owners in the Caribbean]], represented by the [[London Society of West India Planters and Merchants]] (now the [[West India Committee]]), had opposed abolition. This Act paid substantial money to the former slave owners, but nothing to the newly liberated people.

The Act empowered the [[Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt]], under the direction of the Treasury, to either pay the compensation that was still owing to slave owners out of the West India Compensation Account, or to transfer a proportionate amount of 3½% government annuities. The various acts of [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]] relating to slave compensation were to be considered, as far as applicable, to apply to this act.

Slave owners were paid approximately £20 million in compensation in over 40,000 awards for enslaved people freed in the colonies of the [[Caribbean]], [[Mauritius]] and the [[Cape of Good Hope]] according to a government census that named all owners as of 1 August 1834.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title =BBC History magazine| publisher=Bristol Magazines Ltd|issn=1469-8552|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[University College London]] has set up a project ''Legacies of British Slave-ownership'' which aims to list the individuals who received compensation. They estimate that somewhere between 10-20% of Britain's wealthy can be identified as having had significant links to slavery.&lt;ref name=UCL&gt;{{cite web|title=Project Context|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/project/context/|publisher=University College London|accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Taxation}}

'''Stamp duty''' is a tax that is levied on documents. Historically, this included the majority of legal documents such as [[cheque]]s, receipts, military commissions, marriage licences and land transactions. A physical stamp (a [[revenue stamp]]) had to be attached to or [[Impressed duty stamp|impressed]] upon the document to denote that stamp duty had been paid before the document was legally effective. More modern versions of the tax no longer require an actual stamp.

The duty is thought to have originated in Venice in 1604, being introduced (or re-invented) in Spain in the 1610s, the Netherlands in the 1620s,&lt;ref name=dagnall&gt;[[Harry Dagnall|Dagnall, H.]] (1994) ''Creating a Good Impression: three hundred years of The Stamp Office and stamp duties.'' London: HMSO, p. 100. {{ISBN|0116414189}}&lt;/ref&gt; France in 1651,&lt;ref name=dagnall/&gt; Denmark in 1657,{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Prussia in 1682{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} and England in 1694.&lt;ref name=dagnall/&gt;

==Australia==
[[File:One shilling stamp duty revenue stamp of Tasmania.JPG|thumbnail|right|A Stamp Duty [[revenue stamp]] of Tasmania from 1892.]]
The [[Government of Australia#Federal Government|Australian Federal Government]] does not levy stamp duty. However, stamp duties are levied by the [[States and territories of Australia|Australian states]] on various instruments (written documents) and transactions. Stamp duty laws can differ significantly between all 8 jurisdictions. The rates of stamp duty also differ between the jurisdictions (typically up to 5.5%) as do the nature of instruments and transactions subject to duty. Some jurisdictions no longer require a physical document to attract what is now often referred to as "'''transaction duty'''".

Major forms of duty include transfer duty on the sale of land (both freehold and leasehold), buildings, fixtures, plant and equipment, intangible business assets (such as [[goodwill (accounting)|goodwill]] and [[intellectual property]]) debts and other types of dutiable property. Another key type of duty is Landholder duty, which is imposed on the acquisition of shares in a company or units in a trust that holds land above a certain value threshold.

==Denmark==
A temporary stamp duty was introduced in 1657 to finance the war with Sweden. It was made permanent in 1660 and remains on the statute book although it has been substantially altered. Most stamp duties were abolished from 1 January 2000 and the present act only provides for stamp duties on insurance policies. Stamp duties on land registration were renamed and transferred to a separate statute but remain essentially the same, i.e. 0.6% on deeds and 1.5% loans secured against real estate.

==European Union==
Stamp duty is approached by the [[European Commission]] regarding [[raising of capital]] ([[capital duty]]). Council Directive 69/335/EEC of 17 July 1969 concerning indirect taxes on the raising of capital stated that transactions subject to capital duty shall only be taxable in the Member State in whose territory the effective centre of management of a capital company is situated at the time when such transactions take place. When the effective centre of management of a capital company is situated in a third country and its registered office is situated in a Member State, transactions subject to capital duty shall be taxable in the Member State where the registered office is situated. When the registered office and the effective centre of management of a capital company are situated in a third country, the supplying of fixed or working capital to a branch situated in a Member State may be taxed in the Member State in whose territory the branch is situated.&lt;ref name=Llorca&gt;"Capital Duty Directive Text, Cases and Materials", by Salvador Trinxet Llorca, {{ISBN|978-0-9567766-6-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spirit of the Council Directive 2008/7/EC of 12 February 2008 concerning indirect taxes on the raising of capital is that capital duty interferes with the free movement of capital. The Proposal for a Council Directive of 28 September 2011 on a common system of financial transaction tax will amend this Directive 2008/7/EC, but it is not published in the Official Journal.&lt;ref name=Llorca/&gt; This Directive 2008/7/EC acknowledges that the best solution would be to abolish the duty, but allows those Member States that charged the duty as at 1 January 2006 may continue to do so under strict conditions. With this [[stamp duty Directive]], Member States may not levy [[indirect tax]] on the raising of capital to capital companies in:

* contributions of capital;
* loans or services provided as part of contributions of capital;
* registration or other formalities required before commencing business because of the company's legal form;
* alteration of the instruments constituting the company, particularly when involving the conversion into a different type of company, the transfer of centre of effective management or registered office from one Member State to another, a change in the company's objects or the extension of its period of existence;
* restructuring operations.

Indirect taxes are also entirely prohibited on the issue of certain securities and debentures.&lt;ref name=Llorca/&gt;

==Hong Kong==
[[File:Hong Kong overembossing die mark on revenue stamp.jpg|thumb|Historic Hong Kong stamp duty revenue stamp and overembossing die (1905). Actual stamps are no longer used]]
According to Schedule 1 of [[Hong Kong Stamp Duty Ordinance Cap.117]] (SDO), Stamp duty applies to some legal binding documents as classified into 4 heads:
* Head 1: All sale or lease transactions in Hong Kong [[immovable property]].
* Head 2: The transfer of Hong Kong Stock.
* Head 3: All Hong Kong bearer instruments.
* Head 4: Any duplicates and counterparts of the above documents.

One example is [[share (finance)|share]]s of companies which are either [[incorporation (business)|incorporated]] in Hong Kong or listed on the [[Hong Kong Stock Exchange]].  Other than the said shares, HK Stock is defined as shares and marketable securities, units in [[unit trust]]s, and rights to subscribe for or to be allotted stock.  Stamp duty on a conveyance on sale of land is charged at progressive rates ranging from 1.5% to 8.5% of the amount of consideration.  The maximum rate of 8.5% applies where the consideration exceeds [[Hong Kong dollar|HK$]]21,739,130.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.elegislation.gov.hk/hk/cap117/sch1|title=Hong Kong e-Legislation|website=www.elegislation.gov.hk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, in response to the overheated property market, the Government has proposed in 2010 and 2012 two further types of stamp duties in respect of conveyances on sale of land:
* Head 1AA / 1B: Special Stamp Duty (which applies to residential properties resold within 3 years after purchase)
* Head 1AAB / 1C: Buyer's Stamp Duty (which applies to residential properties purchased by non-[[Hong Kong residents#Permanent residents|Hong Kong Permanent Residents]] or companies)

The Special Stamp Duty was enacted by the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] on 29 June 2011 and would take effect from 20 November 2010. An enhanced rate of the Special Stamp Duty and the Buyer's Stamp Duty was enacted by the Legislative Council on 27 February 2014 but would take effect retrospectively from 27 October 2012.

The government regularly updates its Stamp Duty laws and in addition to the above, several other amendments have now been published which are also aimed at cooling the property market. Third party [https://www.spacious.hk/en/hong-kong/mortgages/calculator calculators] make it easier to understand the complex set of rules, making it easier to under the latest cost of buying or selling.

==Ireland==
In the [[Republic of Ireland]] stamp duties are levied on various items including (but not limited to) credit cards, [[debit card]]s, [[ATM card]]s, [[cheque]]s, property transfers, and certain [[court]] documents. Stamp duty was formerly a graduated  [[progressive tax]] with more expensive the house bought the greater the stamp duty rate. The top rate slowly increased from 0.5% in 1882 to 3% in 1947, 5% in 1973, 6% in 1975, reaching its peak at 9% in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Former Rates of Stamp Duty|url=http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/stamp-duty/former-rates-stamp-duty.html|website=Irish Tax and Customs|accessdate=22 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The budget of 2008 inaugurated a series of rate reductions. After 2011 the stamp duty tax is set at 1% for residential properties up to €1 million and 2% on the remaining amount. Non-residential real property, building, insurance policies, the intangible business property goodwill are taxed at 2%. A lease for property of any type is taxed according to the lease duration, 1% of the average annual rent, or the market rate whichever is greater, if 35 years or less, 6% up to 100 years, and 12% for a lease of more than 100 years duration. Counterparts (duplicate copies) of documents are taxed the lesser of €12.50 or the duty on the original document. The value of property for stamp duty excludes VAT. Gifts are taxed at market value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Property other than stocks and marketable securities and policies of (life and non-life) insurance|url=http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/stamp-duty/property.html|website=Irish Tax and Customs|accessdate=22 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several exemptions including those for gifts between close relatives and first time home buyers expired in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exemptions and Reliefs from the charge to Stamp Duty|url=http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/stamp-duty/reliefs-exemptions.html|website=Irish Tax and Customs}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transfer of stocks and marketable securities is taxed at 1% if over €1,000 or if a gift. Stock warrants in bearer form are taxed at 3% of the value of the shares, and the issue of (new) bearer warrants was prohibited effective 1 June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shares, Stocks and Marketable Securities|url=http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/stamp-duty/stocks-marketable-securities.html|website=Irish Tax and Customs|accessdate=23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Singapore==
From 1998, stamp duty in Singapore only applies to documents relating to immovable property, stocks and shares. Purchases of Singapore property or shares traded on the [[Singapore Exchange]], are subject to stamp duty. The [[Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore]] (IRAS) mandates stamp duty payment within 14 days from signing of the document if done in Singapore and 30 days if the document is signed overseas. Failure in payment within the fixed time entails heavy penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stamp duty payment duration and related penalty in case of failure|url=https://www.3ecpa.com.sg/services/taxation/e-stamping/|accessdate=27 February 2015| work=3ecpa_Singapore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Applicable rates and more information can be obtained from [[Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore]]. Legislation covering Singapore Stamp Duties are found in the Stamp Duties Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation | cap = 312 | title = Stamp Duties Act}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sweden==
Swedish law applies a stamp duty on property deeds, at 1.5% of the purchase value. In addition, a stamp duty of 2.0% is levied on new mortgage securities ("pantbrev") for properties.

==United Kingdom==

Retrieved 26 June 2013. [https://www.webcitation.org/6HeSH5PS9 Archived here].&lt;/ref&gt;]]
"Stamp Duty Reserve Tax" (SDRT) was introduced on agreements to transfer certain shares and other securities in 1986, albeit with a relief for intermediaries such as market makers and large banks that are members of a qualifying exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/so/manual.pdf |title=HMRC Stamp Taxes Manual |page=8,11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Stamp Duty Land Tax" (SDLT), a new [[transfer tax]] derived from stamp duty, was introduced for land and property transactions from 1 December 2003.  SDLT is not a stamp duty, but a form of self-assessed [[transfer tax]] charged on "land transactions".

On 24 March 2010, [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]] [[Alistair Darling]] introduced two significant changes to UK Stamp Duty Land Tax. For first-time buyers purchasing a property under £250,000, Stamp Duty Land Tax was abolished for the next two years. This measure was offset by a rise from 4% to 5% in Stamp Duty Land Tax on residential properties costing more than £1 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jones, Rupert|url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2010/mar/24/stampduty-firsttimebuyers|title=Budget 2010: stamp duty boost for first-time buyers|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=24 March 2010|accessdate=25 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further reforms were announced in December 2014, so that rates are now paid only on the part of the property price within each tax band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/stamp-duty-land-tax/residential-property-rates|title=Stamp Duty Land Tax|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2015 [[Autumn Statement]] the Chancellor announced that buyers of second homes (whether [[Buy to let]] or holiday homes) would pay an additional 3% with effect from April 2016.

The Budget 2017 abolished Stamp Duty for first-time home buyers in England and Wales purchasing homes up to £300,000, saving first-time buyers up to £5,000. Additionally first-time buyers spending up to £500,000 will only pay Stamp Duty @ 5% on the amount in excess of £300,000. Those spending over £500,000 will pay full Stamp Duty.&lt;ref&gt; ww.gov.uk/government/publications/stamp-duty-land-tax-relief-for-first-time-buyers/stamp-duty-land-tax-relief-for-first-time-buyers&lt;/ref&gt;

Government defines first-time buyers as '. . . an individual or individuals who have never owned an interest in a residential property in the United Kingdom or anywhere else in the world and who intends to occupy the property as their main residence.'

==United States==
Although the federal government formerly imposed various documentary stamp taxes on deeds, notes, insurance premiums&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Insurance stamp tax |url=https://archive.org/stream/independen79v80newy#page/426/mode/1up |newspaper=The Independent |date=14 December 1914 |accessdate=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other transactional documents, in modern times such taxes are only imposed by states. Typically when real estate is transferred or sold, a real estate [[transfer tax]] will be collected at the time of registration of the deed in the public records. In addition, many states impose a tax on [[mortgage law|mortgages]] or other instruments securing loans against real property. This tax, known variously as a ''mortgage tax'', ''intangibles tax'', or ''documentary stamp tax'', is also usually collected at the time of registration of the mortgage or deed of trust with the recording authority.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5902">'''“The Nature of the Firm”''' (1937), is an article by [[Ronald Coase]]. It offered an economic explanation of why individuals choose to form partnerships, companies and other business entities rather than trading bilaterally through [[contract]]s on a market.  The paper won a Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences in 1991.

==Summary==
Given that production could be carried on without any organization, Coase asks, "Why and under what conditions should we expect firms to emerge?" Since modern firms can only emerge when an [[entrepreneur]] of some sort begins to hire people, Coase's analysis proceeds by considering the conditions under which it makes sense for an entrepreneur to seek hired help instead of contracting out for some particular task.

The traditional economic theory of the time suggested that, because the market is "efficient" (that is, those who are best at providing each good or service most cheaply are already doing so), it should always be cheaper to contract out than to hire.

Coase noted, however, that there are a number of [[transaction cost]]s to using the market; the cost of obtaining a good or service via the market is actually more than just the price of the good.  Other costs, including search and information costs, bargaining costs, keeping [[trade secret]]s, and policing and enforcement costs, can all potentially add to the cost of procuring something via the market. This suggests that firms will arise when they can arrange to produce what they need internally and somehow avoid these costs.

There is a natural limit to what can be produced internally, however. Coase notices "decreasing returns to the entrepreneur function", including increasing overhead costs and increasing propensity for an overwhelmed manager to make mistakes in resource allocation.  This is a countervailing cost to the use of the firm.

Coase argues that the size of a firm (as measured by how many contractual relations are "internal" to the firm and how many "external") is a result of finding an optimal balance between the competing tendencies of the costs outlined above.  In general, making the firm larger will initially be advantageous, but the decreasing returns indicated above will eventually kick in, preventing the firm from growing indefinitely.

Other things being equal, a firm will tend to be larger:

* the less the costs of organizing and the slower these costs rise with an increase in the transactions organized.
* the less likely the entrepreneur is to make mistakes and the smaller the increase in mistakes with an increase in the transactions organized.
* the greater the lowering (or the less the rise) in the supply price of factors of production to firms of larger size.

The first two costs will increase with the spatial distribution of the transactions organized and the dissimilarity of the transactions. This explains why firms tend to either be in different geographic locations or to perform different functions. Additionally, technology changes that mitigate the cost of organizing transactions across space will cause firms to be larger—the advent of the telephone and cheap air travel, for example, would be expected to increase the size of firms. On a related note the use of the [[internet]] and related modern [[Information and Communication technology|information and communication technologies]] seem to lead to the existence of so-called [[virtual organization]]s.

Coase does not consider non-contractual relationships, as between friends or family.

== Reactions ==
In 1991, Coase was awarded the Sveriges Riksbank (Bank of Sweden) Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel.  His paper provided a breakthrough on the significance of transaction costs and property rights for the institutional structure and functioning of the economy.&lt;ref name="nome"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1991/press.html |title=Nobel Prizes and Laureates |date=15 October 1991 |work=Press Release |publisher=Nobel Media |accessdate=2 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This article was famously referred by [[Yochai Benkler]] in his article "Coase's Penguin, or, Linux and The Nature of the Firm",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Benkler|first=Yochai|date=2002|title=Coase's Penguin, or, Linux and "The Nature of the Firm"|jstor=1562247|journal=The Yale Law Journal|volume=112|issue=3|pages=369–446|doi=10.2307/1562247|arxiv=cs/0109077}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he links Coase's essay to the emergence of [[commons-based peer production]] communities using the Internet.

The [[World Bank]]'s 2019 [[World Development Report]] on ''The Changing Nature of Work''&lt;ref&gt;[http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/816281518818814423/pdf/2019-WDR-Report.pdf World Bank World Development Report 2019: The Changing Nature of Work.]&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that firms and production processes become less vertically integrated as technology makes it cheaper to resort to the open market to complete portions of the production process.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3351">A '''trade mark coexistence agreement''' is an [[Contract|agreement]] made by two parties to use a similar [[trademark]] for marketing purposes without interfering in each other's enterprises.  Agreements of this nature are often made as parties only require regional use of their trademarks, and therefore other enterprises use of a trademark will not harm their business.  Coexistence agreements can potentially also involve designs, copyrights and even patents.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

==Purpose==

The purpose of a trade mark coexistence agreement is that often marks are used by multiple enterprises in "good faith".  The absence of a formal agreement does not undermine any enterprise using the mark as they are in different global regions.  However, as the enterprises grow, overlaps can develop, and both parties can have substantial rights for using the trade mark.  In certain cases, companies who are expanding and using the same or a similar trade mark usually enter in a coexistence agreement for the purpose of avoiding usage of the trademark in a way which is undesirable or infringing.  Coexistence agreements can offer practical solutions to companies who are concerned about being sued for trade mark infringement, as proactive agreements can avoid the large cost of [[litigation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Coexistence agreements|url=http://www.ipo.gov.uk/tmcoexistenceagreement.pdf |work=ipo.gov.uk|publisher=United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office|accessdate=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formal agreement==

A formal trade mark coexistence agreement recognises the rights of both parties to use the trademarks contained in the agreement for marketing purposes.  The agreement can contain a division of regions in which enterprises party to the agreement may use the trade mark, methods in which the trademark may be used, or classes of goods and services that the trade mark may be used for (in conjunction with the [[Madrid System for the International Registration of Marks]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IP and Business: Trademark Coexistence|url=http://www.wipo.int/wipo_magazine/en/2006/06/article_0007.html|publisher=WIPO Magazine|accessdate=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
{{howto|section|date=November 2012}}
A trade mark coexistence agreement should clearly contain: any parties to the agreement, the specified trade marks or logos which is to coexist, an understanding as to which domain names each party is using, a list of areas and geographical areas that the trade marks or logos where coexistence is allowed and not allowed, and any relevant plans for the expansion of the enterprise.  Additionally, the coexistence agreement should contain the start and end date of the agreement, a clause establishing the jurisdiction of the agreement and a dispute resolution clause.

==Public interest and antitrust regulations==

Public interest must be considered when entering into a trade mark coexistence agreement.  This often applies in situations such as if two medical companies bore the same trade mark for unique products, as this could lead to confusion and have serious impacts on consumers.  Companies must also consider anti trust regulations.  Courts may find that similar trademarks may affect competition in the marketplace.

'''Veterans Way/College Ave''', also known as the '''Tempe Transportation Center''', is a regional transportation center on [[Valley Metro Rail]] in [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]], [[Arizona]], United States. As part of the regional transportation system, it is also the location of stops on multiple bus routes. A [[bike station]] is located here.

This station has three names: Valley Metro calls the train platforms of this station '''Veterans Way/College Ave''' and the [[Valley Metro Bus|local bus]] bays the '''Tempe Transportation Center'''. Both are part of the same facility and immediately adjacent to '''[[Sun Devil Stadium]]''' which serves as the station's third name, as shown on the train platform signs.  Bus schedules, train maps, and local signage all refer variously to only one of the names.

The Tempe Transportation Center facilities are a combination of a light rail station, [[Valley Metro Bus|bus]] transfer stations and a mixed use building all in the shadow of A Mountain.  The main building is composed of three stories with retail space, a transit information center and Arizona's first Bike Station all located on the first floor.  The second floor is home to the offices for the City of Tempe Transportation Department Offices and the signature element of the project, the Don Cassano Community Room which is open on the ground level to provide shading for pedestrians passing by.  On the third floor of the building are leaseable office space and the City of Tempe's Transit Operations Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tempe.gov/greenprograms/transitcenter.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 12, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127132237/http://www.tempe.gov/greenprograms/transitcenter.htm |archivedate=January 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The center was designed by the Tempe-based firm Architekton with Portland, OR based OTAK Inc. and is currently under review for [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] v2.2 Platinum Certification.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.azcentral.com/community/tempe/articles/2008/04/21/20080421greenrail0421.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The majority of the outdoor area on the site is covered with water permeable pavers for natural drainage.  On the roof are [[solar panels]] and a [[green roof]] designed to reduce the heat island effect with local plants to help insulate the building.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/news/articles/2008/11/04/20081104tempegreenbuilding1103.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:US Patent 72x Eli Whitney cotton gin.png|thumb|X-Patent number 72, [[Eli Whitney]]'s [[cotton gin]]. ]]

The '''X-Patents''' are all the patents issued by the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] from July 1790 (when the first U.S. patent was issued), to July 1836. The actual number is unknown, but the best estimate is 9,957. The records were burned in a fire, in December 1836, while in temporary storage. No copies or rosters were maintained by the government at the time, leaving only the inventors' copies to reconstruct the collection.

==The USPTO and its earliest days==

The Patent Commission of the U.S. was created in 1790. Its first three members were Secretary of State [[Thomas Jefferson]], Secretary of War [[Henry Knox]], and [[Attorney General]] [[Edmund Randolph]].
{{wikisource|United States patent number:X1|U.S. Patent X1: making of Pot Ash by a new apparatus &amp; process}}
On July 31, 1790 inventor [[Samuel Hopkins (inventor)|Samuel Hopkins]] of [[Pittsford, Vermont]] became the first person to be issued a patent in the United States. His patented invention was an improvement in the "making of [[potash|Pot Ash]] by a new apparatus &amp; process." The earliest patent law required that a [[patent model|working model]] of each invention be produced in miniature.

The Patent Law was revised for the first time in 1793. It adopted a simple registration system where a patent would be granted for a $30 fee. The Patent Board was replaced by a clerk in the [[Department of State]]. [[James Madison]], Secretary of State, created a separate Patent Office within the State Department and he appointed [[William Thornton|Dr. William Thornton]] as its first superintendent in May 1802.

The Patent Office was the only major government building to survive the British invasion of Washington, D.C. during the War of 1812. This is credited to Dr. William Thornton who was building a musical instrument in the same building.  He persuaded British officers that they would be destroying the shared intellectual record of mankind if the patents were burned.

==The 1836 fire==
{{main|1836 U.S. Patent Office fire}}
The [[1836 U.S. Patent Office fire|Patent Office 1836 fire]] occurred on December 15 when the patents were in temporary storage while a new (more fireproof) facility was being built. A fire station was located next to the temporary storage facility, but the hoses and pumps were frozen, and the firemen were unable to prevent the loss.

==Recovery of the X-Patents==

The [[United States Congress]] immediately passed a law to aid re-issuing of the missing patents after the fire. About 2,800 such patents have been recovered,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Riordan|first=Teresa|title=Lawyers Unearth Early Patents|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/09/technology/09patent.html|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1,989 are online.

Up until five months prior to the fire, U.S. patents had not been numbered, and were identified by titles and dates. The first patent denoted with the serial numbering system still in use today was issued on July 13, 1836, and was given the number 1.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/ido/oeip/taf/issuyear.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The recovered patents are also numbered from 1, but these numbers have an "X" added to them. The X is generally added to the end of the number except for the first patent which has the X in the beginning of the number. Therefore, they are called X-Patents.

When an earlier patent was recovered and re-issued, the USPTO sometimes gave it a fractional number (e.g. 2960½X, issued on June 2, 1818; 8736¾X, issued on March 27, 1835) to preserve the correct sequence. Most, but not all, fractional patents are X-Patents.

The latest X-Patents were recovered in 2004 from the [[Dartmouth College]] archives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/09/technology/09patent.html |title=Lawyers Unearth Early Patents |last=Riordan |first=Teresa |date=August 9, 2004 |work=New York Times |accessdate=2009-07-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509110315/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/09/technology/09patent.html |archivedate=May 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 14 found, 10 were granted to [[Samuel Morey]] including the first known patent for an [[internal combustion engine]].
