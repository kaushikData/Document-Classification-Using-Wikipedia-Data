In [[language]], an '''analogical change''' is the process of inventing a new [[wikt:Special:Search/element|element]] in conformity with some part of the language system that you already know. For instance, child learns pairs like [[dog]]/dogs, [[cat]]/cats and is then able to form other [[plural]]s. The way in which [[analogy]] can lead to a change is seen when the child learns words like [[man]] and [[mouse]], and forms the analogical plurals mans and mouses (instead of men and mice).&lt;ref&gt;Barber, C. (2009) The English language A Historical Introduction second edition, p47&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Aramis, or the Love of Technology''''', was written by French [[sociologist]]/[[anthropologist]] [[Bruno Latour]]. ''Aramis'' was originally published in French in 1993; the English translation by Catherine Porter, copyrighted in 1996, {{ISBN|978-0-674-04323-7}}, is now in its fourth edition (2002). Latour describes his text as "scientifiction," which he describes as "a hybrid genre... for a hybrid task" (p. ix). The genre includes voices of a young engineer discussing his "sociotechnological initiation," his professor's commentary which introduces [[Actor-network theory]] (ANT), field documents - including real-life interviews, and the voice of Aramis—a failed technology (&lt;ref&gt;Latour, Bruno. (1996). Aramis, or the Love of Technology. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; p. x).

The book is a quasi-mystery, which attempts to discover who killed [[Aramis (personal rapid transit)]]. Aramis was supposed to be implemented as a [[Personal Rapid Transit]] (PRT) system in Paris. Simultaneously, while investigating Aramis's demise, Latour delineates the tenets of Actor-network theory. Latour argues that the technology failed not because any particular actor killed it, but because the actors failed to sustain it through negotiation and adaptation to a changing social situation.

These auditors then apply for a service, be it a job, financial advice regarding their stock portfolio,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Market for Financial Advice: An Audit Study |date=March 2012 |author1=Mullainathan, Sendhil |author2=Noeth, Markus |author3=Schoar, Antoinette |work=NBER Working Paper No. 17929 | doi=10.3386/w17929}}&lt;/ref&gt; housing, or a credit card, to test for discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editors=Fix, Michael; Struyk, Raymond J. | url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/feb/natura/00241.html | title=Clear and Convincing Evidence: Measurement of Discrimination in America | publisher=[[Urban Institute Press]] | year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Audit studies have been conducted to test the existence of discrimination in numerous occupations and services and in regards to multiple characteristics. For example, studies have been conducted to measure discrimination against racial minorities by [[real estate agent]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Page|first1=Marianne|title=Racial and Ethnic Discrimination in Urban Housing Markets: Evidence from a Recent Audit Study|journal=[[Journal of Urban Economics]]|date=September 1995|volume=38|issue=2|pages=183–206|doi=10.1006/juec.1995.1028}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as gender discrimination against women applying for restaurant jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neumark|first1=D.|last2=Bank|first2=R.

==Criticism==
Audit studies have been criticized because the auditors may look different to employers, and this may result in the appearance of discrimination when employers were really just making decisions based on appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neumark|first1=David|title=Detecting Discrimination in Audit and Correspondence Studies|journal=[[Journal of Human Resources]]|date=2012|volume=47|issue=4|pages=1128–1157|doi=10.3368/jhr.47.4.1128}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other limitations of these studies, according to their critics, include that they are unable to audit jobs found through interactions with other people directly, only those found through newspapers.&lt;ref name=jep&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=2646964| title=Detecting Discrimination | author=Heckman, James J. | journal=[[The Journal of Economic Perspectives]] | date=Spring 1998 | volume=12 | issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, others have noted the lack of standardization of signals (primarily names) to indicate race through correspondence (e.g. resumes, emails, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gaddis|first1=S. Michael|title=How Black Are Lakisha and Jamal?

'''BRS/Search''' is a full-text database and information retrieval system. BRS/Search uses a [[inverted index|fully inverted]] indexing system to store, locate, and retrieve unstructured data. It was the search engine that in 1977 powered Bibliographic Retrieval Services (BRS) commercial operations with 20 databases (including the first national commercial availability of [[MEDLINE]]); it has changed ownership several times during its development and is currently sold as Livelink ECM Discovery Server by [[Open Text Corporation]].

==Early development==
Development on what was to become BRS began as Biomedical Communications Network (BCN) at the [[State University of New York]], Albany (SUNY). BCN, which went online in 1968, provided on-line access to nine databases, including [[MEDLINE]] and BIOSIS PREVIEWS, to large universities and medical schools primarily in the Northeast of the USA. State funding for the project was withdrawn in 1975, and Bibliographic Retrieval Services (BRS) was formed as a non-profit concern the following year. It was incorporated in May 1976 as a for-profit corporation with Ron Quake as president, Jan Egeland as vice president in charge of marketing and training, and Lloyd Palmer as vice president of systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/ota/Ota_4/DATA/1982/8219.PDF | publisher = Congress, Office of Technology Assessment | year = 1982 | title = MEDLARS and Health Information Policy | ISBN = 1-4289-2424-8 | place = USA | format = [[PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==BRS commercial operations==
In December 1976, the First BRS User Meeting was held in Syracuse, N.Y. and by January 1977 BRS started commercial operations with 20 databases (including the first national commercial availability of [[MEDLINE]]) and 9 million records, using modified [[IBM STAIRS]] (STorage And Information Retrieval System) software, [[Telenet]] for telecommunications, and timesharing mainframe computers of Carrier Corporation. In October 1980 BRS was sold by Egeland and Quake to Indian Head, Inc., a subsidiary of the Dutch company Thyssen-Bornemisza Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Online Before The Internet | chapter = Part 7: Early Pioneers Tell Their Stories: BRS—An Interview with Jan Egeland | url = http://www.infotoday.com/SEARCHER/jul04/ardito_bjorner.shtml | publisher = Info Today | date = July 2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Online Before The Internet | chapter = Part 8: Early Pioneers Tell Their Stories: BRS—An Interview with Jan Egeland | url = http://www.infotoday.com/searcher/nov04/ardito_bjorner.shtml | publisher = Info Today | date = November 2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1989–1993 ==
In 1989 [[Robert Maxwell]] acquired BRS and the BRS/Search software; he announced the planned incorporation of the ORBIT Search Service and BRS Information Technologies and renamed the whole group Maxwell Online, Inc. At that time BRS Information Technologies was serving the medical and academic library marketplace with over 150 databases. Maxwell later bought the publishing company [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] and put Maxwell Online under Macmillan. In the same year BRS/LINK (hypertext connection of databases; first application delivering full text) was announced.

At the time of Robert Maxwell’s death in 1991, [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] brought in Andrew Gregory to represent the company during the 2 years that Maxwell’s affairs were being settled and to prepare Maxwell Online to be able to sell the components. Maxwell Online shortly thereafter underwent yet another name change, this time to InfoPro Technologies.

==Dataware Technologies ownership of BRS/SEARCH==
Early in 1994, InfoPro Technologies, a subsidiary of MHC Inc. (holding company for Macmillan Inc.), the former Maxwell Online service, sold off all its subsidiaries. ORBIT Search Services went to the French-owned Questel, the dial-up BRS Search Services to [[Ovid Technologies|CD Plus Technologies]] (later to become OVID), and BRS Software Products (including BRS/SEARCH) to Dataware Technologies. Almost up to the end of InfoPro Technologies, BRS Software had been the fastest growing segment of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb4328/is_199501/ai_n15084021 | publisher = Searcher | title = "Whatever happened to BRS software?", interview with Kurt Mueller, CEO of Dataware Technologies | date = January 1995}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|date=November 1993 |url=http://articles.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb4328/is_199311/ai_n15085290 |title=Interview with founder of CD Plus Technologies |publisher=Searcher }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 14th BRS North American Users Group Conference in 1999, Dave Schubmehl of Dataware Technologies presented a paper in which he stated "The purpose of this presentation is to update BRS users on upcoming releases of BRS/Search, NetAnswer, and other Dataware products. BRS/Search 7.0 will include features specifically requested by customers, as well as other enhancements. Earlier this year, Dataware acquired Sovereign Hill Software, makers of InQuery. In light of that acquisition, and Dataware's other development projects, we'll look at Dataware's plans for all products, including BRS/Search and NetAnswer."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.usc.edu/users/karl/BRSNAUG/Conferences/1999a/Papers/ | title = 14th BRS North American Users Group Conference: Presentation Abstracts | date = August 25–27, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Open Text acquisition of BRS/Search==
In 2001 BRS/Search was acquired by [[Open Text]] and became LiveLink ECM Discovery Server.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.opentext.com/2/sol-products/sol-pro-knowledge-management/pro-ll-discovery-server.htm |publisher=Open Text |title=Pro 11 Discovery Server |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504100332/http://www.opentext.com/2/sol-products/sol-pro-knowledge-management/pro-ll-discovery-server.htm |archivedate=May 4, 2007 |df=mdy }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | publisher = The Free Library | url = http://www.thefreelibrary.com/LeadingSide,+Inc.+Sells+Search+and+Retrieval+Product+Business+to+Open...-a067265168 | title = LeadingSide, Inc.

Open Text still supports both BRS/Search and NetAnswer. Active BRS/Search and NetAnswer installations include the public Web patent full-text database operated by the United States Patent and Trademark Office at USPTO Web Patent Databases.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.uspto.gov/patft/ | publisher = PTO | place = USA | title = PatFT}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  BRS/Search and NetAnswer are also used in-house for searches performed by patent examiners and public patent searchers at the USPTO.

The core BRS/Search technology in the Open Text portfolio was augmented with other capabilities through various acquisitions.  For example, Dataware's acquisition of Sovereign-Hill brought InQuery, “a probabilistic information retrieval system using an inference network”,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | publisher = University of Massachusetts | place = USA | url = http://www.cs.umass.edu/csinfo/newsletter/images/sigbits_spring97.pdf | title = Sigbits | date = Spring 1997 | format = PDF}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which was developed by the University of Massachusetts Amherst Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval] out of the [http://ciir.cs.umass.edu/ UMass CIIR] and into the marketplace.  A product re-branding table&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.opentext.com/2/sol-products/pro-allproducts/pro-rebranded-products-table.htm |title=Pro rebranded products table |publisher=OpenText |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070429055259/http://www.opentext.com/2/sol-products/pro-allproducts/pro-rebranded-products-table.htm |archivedate=April 29, 2007 |df=mdy }}.&lt;/ref&gt; shows the range of products, their old names and their new names.

InQuery is a concept search engine that uses noun phrases, parts of speech and other co-occurrence relationships in overlapping passages of text rather than single term inverted indexes of single words in documents.

Open Text's portfolio has grown to include Hummingbird Content Management, and has always included BASIS.

== 2003 ==

BRS/Search North America User's Group (BRSNAUG) website with a June 8, 2003 date listed the following features for BRS/Search.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20030423224049/http://www.usc.edu/users/karl/BRSNAUG/brs-software.html#description&lt;/ref&gt;  The BRSNAUG also disincorporated in 2003.

&lt;!-- == 2002 ==

An [http://www.opentext.com/news/pr.html?id=1273 OpenText news article] from 2002-06-04 states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The BRS Product Group of Open Text will introduce the BRS Advanced Information Retrieval Tool Kit. As document collections continue to expand, searchers require tools beyond a typical ranked list of documents in response to a search query. To meet this need, Open Text is providing a set of advanced information retrieval and analysis tools to enhance the capabilities of BRS/Search applications. The tool kit consists of three modules: The Clustering Tool, The Query by Example and The Concept Mining/Enhanced Search Tool. Dave Schubmehl, Open Text Vice President of BRS Products explains, "these tools aide the information professional's expanded role—to analyze and synthesize search results for end-users. In particular, the Concept Mining Tool analyzes the text in retrieved documents, extracts the names of companies, people, and/or the phrases or words, and presents a list of the most significant concepts in each requested category. Each concept is accompanied by a weight that indicates its relative importance in the analyzed text."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Open Text display will also feature Query Server, a powerful solution for unifying access to multiple internal and external information sources including repositories, document management systems, intranets, and the Internet. "Today, it is often necessary to search each of these information sources separately causing employees to waste time in attempts to find information instead of putting it to use," says Mr. Schubmehl. Query Server solves this problem by integrating Web-compatible data sources through the power of the Internet. It broadcasts a user's query to multiple search-enabled information sources, merges and sorts the query results, and returns a single ranked list, providing a valuable first step toward a unified knowledge management system for your organization.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== 1996 ==

In [[audio equipment]] the '''ceiling level''', also known as the ''point of distortion'', is the maximum input [[Signal (electronics)|signal]] [[amplitude]] above which output [[distortion]] exceeds an acceptable level.
The Ceiling Level or Ceiling Value is the maximum permissible concentration of a hazardous material in the working environment. This level should not be exceeded at any time. It is usually (but not invariably) set somewhat above the relevant time-weighted average for the chemical.

The '''chemical shift index''' or '''CSI''' is a widely employed technique in [[protein nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]] that can be used to display and identify the location (i.e. start and end) as well as the type of [[protein secondary structure]] (beta strands, helices and random coil regions) found in proteins using only backbone [[chemical shift]] data &lt;ref name=W1&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wishart DS, Sykes BD, Richards FM |title=The chemical shift index: a fast and simple method for the assignment of protein secondary structure through NMR spectroscopy |journal=Biochemistry |volume=31 |issue=6 |pages=1647–51 |date=February 1992  |pmid=1737021 |doi=10.1021/bi00121a010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=W2&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF00175245 |pmid=8019132 |title=The &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C Chemical-Shift Index: A simple method for the identification of protein secondary structure using &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C chemical-shift data |journal=Journal of Biomolecular NMR |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=171–80 |year=1994 |last1=Wishart |first1=David S. |last2=Sykes |first2=Brian D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique was invented by [http://www.wishartlab.com/ Dr. David Wishart] in 1992 for analyzing &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Hα chemical shifts and then later extended by him in 1994 to incorporate &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C backbone shifts. The original CSI method makes use of the fact that &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Hα chemical shifts of amino acid residues in [[alpha helix|helices]] tends to be shifted upfield (i.e. towards the right side of a NMR spectrum) relative to their random coil values and downfield (i.e. towards the left side of a NMR spectrum) in [[beta strand]]s.  Similar kinds of upfield/downfiled trends are also detectable in backbone &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C chemical shifts.

==Implementation==
The CSI is a graph-based technique that essentially employs an amino acid-specific digital filter to convert every assigned backbone chemical shift value into a simple three-state (-1, 0, +1) index.  This approach generates a more easily understood and much more visually pleasing graph of protein chemical shift values.   In particular, if the upfield &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Hα chemical shift (relative to an amino acid-specific random coil value) of a certain residue is &gt; 0.1 ppm, then that amino acid residue is assigned a value of -1.  Similarly, if the downfield &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Hα chemical shift of a certain amino acid residue is &gt; 0.1 ppm then that residue is assigned a value of +1.  If an amino acid residue’s [[chemical shift]] is not shifted downfield or upfield by a sufficient amount (i.e. &lt;0.1 ppm), it is given a value of 0.  When this 3-state index is plotted as a bar graph over the full length of the protein sequence, simple inspection can allow one to identify beta strands (clusters of +1 values), alpha helices (clusters of -1 values), and random coil segments (clusters of 0 values).  A list of the amino acid-specific random coil chemical shifts for CSI calculations is given in Table 1.  An example of a CSI graph for a small protein is shown in Figure 1 with the arrows located above the black bars indicating locations of the beta strands and the rectangular box indicating the location of a helix.

==Performance==
Using only &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Hα chemical shifts and simple clustering rules (clusters of 3 or more vertical bars for beta strands and clusters of 4 or more vertical bars for alpha helices), the CSI is typically 75-80% accurate in the identification of secondary structures.&lt;ref name="W2"/&gt;&lt;ref name=W3&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wishart DS, Case DA |title=Use of chemical shifts in macromolecular structure determination |journal=Methods in Enzymology |volume=338 |issue= |pages=3–34 |year=2001 |pmid=11460554 |doi=10.1016/s0076-6879(02)38214-4|series=Methods in Enzymology |isbn=9780121822392 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=W4&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mielke SP, Krishnan VV |title=Characterization of protein secondary structure from NMR chemical shifts |journal=Progress in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy |volume=54 |issue=3–4 |pages=141–165 |date=April 2009  |pmid=20160946 |pmc=2766081 |doi=10.1016/j.pnmrs.2008.06.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=W5&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wishart DS |title=Interpreting protein chemical shift data |journal=Progress in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy |volume=58 |issue=1–2 |pages=62–87 |date=February 2011  |pmid=21241884 |doi=10.1016/j.pnmrs.2010.07.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; This performance depends partly on the quality of the NMR data set as well as the technique (manual or programmatic) used to identify the protein secondary structures.  As noted above, a consensus CSI method that filters upfield/downfield chemical shift changes in &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;Cα, &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;Cβ, and &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C' atoms in a similar manner to &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Hα shifts has also been developed.&lt;ref name="W2"/&gt;  The consensus CSI combines the CSI plots from backbone &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H and &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C chemical shifts to generate a single CSI plot. It can be up to 85-90% accurate.&lt;ref name="W5"/&gt;

==History==
The link between protein chemical shifts and protein secondary structure (specifically alpha helices) was first described by John Markley and colleagues in 1967.&lt;ref name=W6&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Markley JL, Meadows DH, Jardetzky O |title=Nuclear magnetic resonance studies of helix-coil transitions in polyamino acids |journal=Journal of Molecular Biology |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=25–40 |date=July 1967  |pmid=6033611 |doi=10.1016/0022-2836(67)90349-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the development of modern 2-dimensional NMR techniques, it became possible to measure more protein chemical shifts. With more peptides and proteins were being assigned in the early 1980s it soon became obvious that amino acid chemical shifts were sensitive not only to helical conformations, but also to β-strand conformations. Specifically, the secondary &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Hα chemical shifts of all amino acids exhibit a clear upfield trend on helix formation and an obvious downfield trend on β-sheet formation.&lt;ref name=W7&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0022-2364(82)90252-9 |title=Peptide group shifts |journal=Journal of Magnetic Resonance |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=383 |year=1982 |last1=Clayden |first1=N.J |last2=Williams |first2=R.J.P |bibcode=1982JMagR..49..383C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=W8&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pardi A, Wagner G, Wüthrich K |title=Protein conformation and proton nuclear-magnetic-resonance chemical shifts |journal=European Journal of Biochemistry |volume=137 |issue=3 |pages=445–54 |date=December 1983  |pmid=6198174 |doi=10.1111/j.1432-1033.1983.tb07848.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 1990s, a sufficient body of  &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C and &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N chemical shift assignments for peptides and proteins had been collected to determine that similar upfield/downfield trends were evident for essentially all backbone &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;Cα, &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;Cβ, &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C', &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;HN and &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N (weakly) chemical shifts.&lt;ref name=W9&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wishart DS, Sykes BD, Richards FM |title=Relationship between nuclear magnetic resonance chemical shift and protein secondary structure |journal=Journal of Molecular Biology |volume=222 |issue=2 |pages=311–33 |date=November 1991  |pmid=1960729 |doi=10.1016/0022-2836(91)90214-Q}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=W10&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/ja00014a071 |id={{INIST|5389018}} |title=Empirical correlation between protein backbone conformation and Cα and Cβ &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C nuclear magnetic resonance chemical shifts |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |volume=113 |issue=14 |pages=5490–2 |year=1991 |last1=Spera |first1=Silvia |last2=Bax |first2=Ad}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was these rather striking chemical shift trends that were exploited in the development of the chemical shift index.

==Limitations==
The CSI method is not without some shortcomings.  In particular, its performance drops if chemical shift assignments are [[Protein Chemical Shift Re-Referencing|mis-referenced]] or incomplete.  It is also quite sensitive to the choice of random coil shifts used to calculate the secondary shifts&lt;ref name="W5"/&gt; and it generally identifies alpha helices (&gt;85% accuracy) better than beta strands (&lt;75% accuracy) regardless of the choice of random coil shifts.&lt;ref name="W5"/&gt;  Furthermore, the CSI method does not identify other kinds of secondary structures, such as β-turns.  Because of these shortcomings, a number of alternative CSI-like approaches have been proposed. These include: 1) a prediction method that employs statistically derived chemical shift/structure potentials (PECAN);&lt;ref name=W11&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Eghbalnia HR, Wang L, Bahrami A, Assadi A, Markley JL |title=Protein energetic conformational analysis from NMR chemical shifts (PECAN) and its use in determining secondary structural elements |journal=Journal of Biomolecular NMR |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=71–81 |date=May 2005  |pmid=16041485 |doi=10.1007/s10858-005-5705-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2) a probabilistic approach to secondary structure identification (PSSI);&lt;ref name=W12&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wang Y, Jardetzky O |title=Probability-based protein secondary structure identification using combined NMR chemical-shift data |journal=Protein Science |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=852–61 |date=April 2002  |pmid=11910028 |pmc=2373532 |doi=10.1110/ps.3180102}}&lt;/ref&gt; 3) a method that combines secondary structure predictions from sequence data and chemical shift data (PsiCSI),&lt;ref name=W13&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hung LH, Samudrala R |title=Accurate and automated classification of protein secondary structure with PsiCSI |journal=Protein Science |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=288–95 |date=February 2003  |pmid=12538892 |pmc=2312422 |doi=10.1110/ps.0222303}}&lt;/ref&gt; 4) a secondary structure identification approach that uses pre-specified chemical shift patterns (PLATON)&lt;ref name=W14&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Labudde D, Leitner D, Krüger M, Oschkinat H |title=Prediction algorithm for amino acid types with their secondary structure in proteins (PLATON) using chemical shifts |journal=Journal of Biomolecular NMR |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=41–53 |date=January 2003  |pmid=12566998 |doi=10.1023/A:1021952400388 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 5) a two-dimensional [[cluster analysis]] method known as 2DCSi.&lt;ref name=W15&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wang CC, Chen JH, Lai WC, Chuang WJ |title=2DCSi: identification of protein secondary structure and redox state using 2D cluster analysis of NMR chemical shifts |journal=Journal of Biomolecular NMR |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=57–63 |date=May 2007  |pmid=17333485 |doi=10.1007/s10858-007-9146-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The performance of these newer methods is generally slightly better (2-4%) than the original CSI method.

==Utility==
Since its original description in 1992, the CSI method has been used to characterize the secondary structure of thousands of peptides and proteins.  Its popularity is largely due to the fact that it is easy to understand and can be implemented without the need for specialized computer programs.  Even though the CSI method can be easily performed manually, a number of commonly used NMR data processing programs such as NMRView,&lt;ref name=W16&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Johnson BA, Blevins RA |title=NMR View: A computer program for the visualization and analysis of NMR data |journal=Journal of Biomolecular NMR |volume=4 |issue=5 |pages=603–14 |date=September 1994  |pmid=22911360 |doi=10.1007/BF00404272}}&lt;/ref&gt; NMR structure generation web servers such as [http://www.cs23d.ca/ CS23D]&lt;ref name=W17&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wishart DS, Arndt D, Berjanskii M, Tang P, Zhou J, Lin G |title=CS23D: a web server for rapid protein structure generation using NMR chemical shifts and sequence data |journal=Nucleic Acids Research |volume=36 |issue=Web Server issue |pages=W496–502 |date=July 2008  |pmid=18515350 |pmc=2447725 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkn305}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as various NMR data analysis web servers such as [http://randomcoilindex.com RCI],&lt;ref name=W18&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Berjanskii MV, Wishart DS |title=The RCI server: rapid and accurate calculation of protein flexibility using chemical shifts |journal=Nucleic Acids Research |volume=35 |issue=Web Server issue |pages=W531–7 |date=July 2007  |pmid=17485469 |pmc=1933179 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkm328}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.preditor.ca/ Preditor]&lt;ref name=W19&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Berjanskii MV, Neal S, Wishart DS |title=PREDITOR: a web server for predicting protein torsion angle restraints |journal=Nucleic Acids Research |volume=34 |issue=Web Server issue |pages=W63–9 |date=July 2006  |pmid=16845087 |pmc=1538894 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkl341}}&lt;/ref&gt; and PANAV &lt;ref name=W20&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wang B, Wang Y, Wishart DS |title=A probabilistic approach for validating protein NMR chemical shift assignments |journal=Journal of Biomolecular NMR |volume=47 |issue=2 |pages=85–99 |date=June 2010  |pmid=20446018 |doi=10.1007/s10858-010-9407-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; have incorporated the CSI method into their software.

'''Civionics''' is the combination of '''civi'''l engineering with electr'''onics''' engineering, in a manner similar to [[avionics]] ('''avi'''ation and electr'''onics''') and [[mechatronics]] ('''mecha'''nical engineering and elec'''tronics'''). An emerging discipline, the main application area of civionics is currently the use of electronics for [[structural health monitoring]] (SHM) of civil structures, particularly [[photonics]] (Fiber Optic Bragg Grating).

In SHM, Civionics will provide engineers with feedback necessary to aid in optimizing design techniques and understanding infrastructure performance, behaviour and state of condition. The successful integration of intelligent sensing of innovative structures will allow civil structural engineers to expand the design envelope by taking risks to introduce new design concepts, materials and innovation in civil engineering.

Civionic engineering applications include integrating science and technology from both new and traditional disciplines, including [[Civil engineering|civil]], [[Structural engineering|structural]], and [[electronics engineering]]; [[structural health monitoring]], [[deformation monitoring]], [[data acquisition]], [[signal processing]], [[metrology]], [[telemetry]], [[remote sensing]], and other applications.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2697">[[File:Polychlorinated biphenyl structure.svg|thumb|Example of a congener: the number and locations of Cl groups can vary]]
In [[chemistry]], '''congeners''' are related chemical substances "related to each other by origin, structure, or function".&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=congener|file=CT06819}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common origin and structure==
Any significant quantity of a [[polyhalogenated compound]] is by default a blend of multiple molecule types because each molecule forms independently, and chlorine and bromine do not strongly select which site(s) they bond to.

*[[Polychlorinated biphenyl]]s (PCBs) are a family of 209 congeners. [[Polybrominated biphenyl]]s and [[polychlorinated diphenyl ethers]] are also families of 209 congeners. Similarly [[polychlorinated dibenzodioxins]], [[polychlorinated dibenzofurans]], [[polychlorinated terphenyl]]s, [[polychlorinated naphthalene]], [[polychloro phenoxy phenol]], and [[polybrominated diphenyl ethers]] (PBDEs) ([[pentabromodiphenyl ether]], [[octabromodiphenyl ether]], [[decabromodiphenyl ether]]), etc..

==Common origin==
*[[Congener (alcohol)]], substances other than alcohol (desirable or undesirable) also produced during fermentation.
*Congeners of [[oleic acid]]s can modify [[cell membrane]] behavior, protecting against tumors or having effects on blood pressure.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.desy.de/~sergio/Funari-JLR-2003.pdf Effects of oleic acid and its congeners, elaidic and stearic acids, on the structural properties of phosphatidylethanolamine membranes&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common structure==
{{Main|Structural analog}}
*Congeners can refer to similar compounds that substitute other elements with similar valences, yielding molecules having similar [[chemical structure|structures]]. Examples: [[potassium chloride]] and [[sodium chloride]] may be considered congeners; also potassium chloride and [[potassium fluoride]]. Example: [[hydrogen peroxide]] (HOOH), [[hydrogen thioperoxide]] (HSOH), and [[hydrogen disulfide]] (HSSH). Structural analogs are often [[isoelectronicity|isoelectronic]].

==Other==
*Congeners refer to the various oxidation states of a given element in a compound. For example, [[titanium(II) chloride]] (titanium dichloride), [[titanium(III) chloride]] (titanium trichloride), and titanium(IV) chloride ([[titanium tetrachloride]]) may be considered congeners.
*Congeners can refer to other elements in the same group in the [[periodic table]]. For example, congeners of the Group 11 element [[copper]] are [[silver]] and [[gold]], sometimes found together in the same [[ore]]s ([[porphyry copper deposit]]) due to their chemical similarity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1577">The '''Dahrendorf hypothesis''' is the name given to a [[hypothesis]] by the [[Germany|German]]-[[United Kingdom|British]] [[political science|political scientist]] [[Ralf Dahrendorf]], which states that diversity is desirable in economic policies across time and space according to local needs.

Dahrendorf argues that [[society|societies]] are quite considerably different from each other, and that any one set of economic policies will not be equally well adapted to all societies (e.g. the same policies will not work as well in poor, subsistence economies as they will in advanced industrial economies). The Dahrendorf hypothesis was developed in opposition to many traditional perspectives and [[theory|theories]] in [[economics]], most notably [[neoclassical economics]], which implicitly or explicitly hold that one set of economic policies should be implemented globally and universally.

In accordance with this belief, Dahrendorf said that, far from uniting Europe, the introduction of the Euro would ultimately divide it.

'''Duvenhage virus''' ('''DUVV''') is a member of the genus ''[[Lyssavirus]]'', which also contains the [[rabies virus]]. The [[virus]] was discovered in 1970, when a [[South Africa]]n farmer (after whom the virus is named) died of a rabies-like [[encephalitis|encephalitic illness]], after being bitten by a [[bat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |author1=Tignor G.

A 34-year-old woman who died in Amsterdam on December 8, 2007 was the third recorded fatality. She had been scratched on the nose by a small bat while travelling through Kenya in October 2007, and was admitted to hospital four weeks later with rabies-like symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | author = van Thiel, P.

[[Microbat]]s are believed to be the natural reservoir of Duvenhage virus. It has been isolated twice from insectivorous bats, in 1981 from ''[[Miniopterus schreibersi]]'', and in 1986 from ''[[Nycteris thebaica]]'',&lt;ref name=Paweska/&gt; and the virus is closely related to another bat-associated lyssavirus endemic to [[Africa]], [[Lagos bat virus]].

{{Unreferenced stub|auto=yes|date=December 2009}}
The '''entropy of vaporization''' is the increase in [[entropy]] upon [[vaporization]] of a liquid. This is always positive, since the [[Entropy#Entropy as a measure of disorder|degree of disorder]] increases in the [[phase transition|transition]] from a [[liquid]] in a relatively small volume to a [[vapor]] or [[gas]] occupying a much larger space. At [[standard pressure]] ''P''&lt;sup&gt;&lt;s&gt;o&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 [[Bar (unit)|bar]], the value is denoted as Δ''S''&lt;sup&gt;&lt;s&gt;o&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;vap&lt;/sub&gt; and normally expressed in '''[[Joule|J]] [[mole (unit)|mol]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; [[Kelvin|K]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;'''. 

In a [[phase transition]] such as vaporization, both phases coexist in equilibrium, so the difference in [[Gibbs free energy]] is equal to zero. 

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta G_\text{vap} = \Delta H_\text{vap} - T_\text{vap} \times \Delta S_\text{vap} = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Delta H_\text{vap}&lt;/math&gt; is the heat or [[enthalpy of vaporization]]. Since this is a [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] equation, the symbol ''T'' refers to the absolute [[thermodynamic temperature]], measured in [[kelvin]]s (K). The entropy of vaporization is then equal to the heat of vaporization divided by the boiling point. 

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta S_\text{vap} = \frac{\Delta H_\text{vap}}{T_\text{vap}}.&lt;/math&gt;

According to [[Trouton's rule]], the entropy of vaporization (at standard pressure) of most liquids is about 85 to 88 J mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8958">'''Erik Adigard des Gautries''' (1953) is a [[Graphic designer|communication designer]], multimedia artist and educator based in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. A co-founder of M-A-D, a [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]-based design firm. He is a former design contributor to [[Wired magazine]].

== Biography ==
Adigard was born in [[Republic of the Congo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfmoma.org/artist/Erik_Adigard|title=Erik Adigard|website=SFMOMA|access-date=2016-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; where his father was stationed as a French foreign correspondent. His grandfather is {{ill|Jean Adigard des Gautries|fr}}, a noted historian and a Legion of Honour recipient. When Adigard was ten his family returned to Paris. He began his university studies in English Literature, Semiotics, and Fine Arts in France before coming to the United States to obtain a BFA (1987) in Graphic Design at California College of the Arts (CCA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cca.edu/|title=California College of the Arts|website=cca.edu|access-date=2017-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While a student, Adigard's first designs earned him national awards for their experimental mix of iconography and offset printing techniques. Upon graduation, with [[Patricia McShane]], he established M-A-D—also known as "madxs", a brand and communications design studio. Since creating his first digital images for Macworld magazine in 1989 he has been exploring the limits of the graphic design discipline as it continues to be redefined by shifting relationships with technology and social phenomena. His activities range from branding, print, web, video and multimedia, to consulting and exhibits—always with a concern for conceptual accuracy and creative innovation. {{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

In 1992 he participated in the launch of Wired magazine by conceiving its first visual essay, and then continued to develop a visual vernacular specific to Wired and often labeled "Wired look". In 1996-1998 he served as design director for WiredVentures where he designed new web offerings, including the Hotbot search engine, WiredNews and the ground breaking LiveWired.{{Citation needed|date = April 2016}}

His short documentary, ''Webdreamer'', a portrait of fellow web designers, was featured in international film festivals such as [[RESFest|RESfest]] and the Sundance Film Festival.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1999 he co-authored ''Architecture Must Burn'' with Aaron Betsky.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://www.amazon.com/Architecture-Must-Burn-Manifestoes-Future/dp/1584230304/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1358198560&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=architecture+must+burn|title = Architecture Must Burn Manifestoes for the Future of Architecture|last = Betsky|first = Aaron|last2 = Adigard|first2 = Erik|date = 2001-08-01|publisher = Gingko Press|isbn = 9781584230304|language = English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2000 until 2004 Adigard developed brand strategy for IBM software, creating a graphic system that allowed for five distinct brands; [[IBM DB2|DB2]], Lotus, Tivoli, [[Rational Software|Rational]], and [[IBM WebSphere|Websphere]], to combine into an integrated offering. This brand system included a visual campaign that was in continual use throughout the decade.{{Citation needed|date = April 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5338">The '''European Technology Assessment Group''' (ETAG) is a cooperative network of scientific institutions that carries out studies in the field of [[technology assessment]] on behalf of the [[European Parliament]].

[[Image:ETAG.jpg|thumb|ETAG-Logo]]

==History and Mission==
Since October 2005 a group of European scientific institutes active in the field of [[technology assessment]] - with the [[Institute for Technology Assessment and Systems Analysis (ITAS)]], [[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]] (KIT), Germany, as the leading partner - has been providing scientific services for the [[European Parliament]] on social, environmental and economic aspects of new technological and scientific developments.

Like many other parliaments in Europe&lt;ref&gt;See the members of the [[European Parliamentary Technology Assessment]] (EPTA) network.&lt;/ref&gt; the European Parliament at the end of the 1980s set up an institution for scientific advice regarding complex social, ecological and economic implications of modern technology and scientific research. At the European Parliament the process of consulting is organised by the STOA panel ([[Scientific Technology Options Assessment]]), a parliamentary body consisting of 15 Members of Parliament representing several parliamentary committees. In view of the growing importance of European science and technology policy the European Parliament decided to support STOA’s activities by establishing permanent co-operation with a group of institutions with relevant expertise in the field of technology assessment.

Starting from May 2009 the European Technology Assessment Group (ETAG) for a second period of three years supports STOA by carrying out TA studies. The focus of ETAG’s activities on behalf of the European Parliament will be on studies in the fields of [[transport]], [[Information and communications technologies|ICT]] and [[Information society]], [[Nanotechnology|nanoscale science and technology]], [[Life Sciences|life sciences]] and [[Quality of Life|human well being]] as well as [[agriculture]], [[food]] and [[biotechnology]].

==Partners==
Apart from being leading institutions in the field of [[technology assessment]] in their home countries most members of the group have long-term experience in [[policy consulting]] for parliamentary bodies and most of them are members of the [[European Parliamentary Technology Assessment]] (EPTA) network. ETAG is made up by the following organisations:
* [[Institute for Technology Assessment and Systems Analysis (ITAS)]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.itas.kit.edu/english/ ITAS]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]] (KIT), which operates the [[Office of Technology Assessment at the German Parliament]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tab-beim-bundestag.de/en TAB]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Danish Board of Technology]] (DBT),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tekno.dk DBT]&lt;/ref&gt; which provides consultancy services for the Danish Parliament
* [[Rathenau Instituut]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rathenau.org Rathenau Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; working for the Dutch Parliament
* [[Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research]] (ISI),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isi.fraunhofer.de/isi-en/ ISI]&lt;/ref&gt; supporting ITAS in carrying out TA studies on behalf of the German Parliament
* [[Catalan Foundation for Research and Innovation]] (FCRI),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcri.cat FCRI]&lt;/ref&gt; rendering scientific services for the Parliament of Catalonia
* [[Institute of Technology Assessment]] (ITA)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oeaw.ac.at/ita/en/ ITA]&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]]
* Technology Centre AS CR,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tc.cz TC AS]&lt;/ref&gt; an institute active in TA related research run by the [[Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic]]
* [http://www.rtexpert.com Responsible Technology SAS],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtexpert.com RT]&lt;/ref&gt; a French consultancy devoted to [[Responsible Research and Innovation]] (RRI) and [http://sss.sagepub.com/content/44/2/218 Anticipatory Governance]

==Projects==
The scientific responsibility for each TA study tailored according to the information needs of the [[European Parliament]] lies with one of the partners. ITAS is responsible for administration, communication with the European Parliament and co-ordination of the activities of ETAG as well as of the group’s co-operation with a wider network of TA institutes in Europe. The work programme comprises studies dealing with a broad range of subjects from different sectors of policy making, such as R&amp;D, the environment, health and energy. Topics included: Converging Technologies; Antibiotic Resistance; Galileo Applications; Sustainable Energy Catalogue; Nanotechnology and Chemical Substitution; Options for Road and Air Transports; Cancer Therapy; RFID an identity management; Intellectual Property Rights; Global Human Health; Future Energy Systems in Europe; Future of European Transport; Technology and the Labour Market; Safety of Tunnels; Direct to Consumer Genetic Testing; Animal Welfare; Human Enhancement; ICT and Energy Efficiency; Agricultural Technologies for Developing Countries.

Studies carried out by ETAG on behalf of STOA are available at STOA’s web page.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/stoa/publications/studies/default_en.htm STOA studies]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ganges Chasma''' is a deep [[canyon]] at the eastern end of the vast [[Valles Marineris]] system on [[Mars]], an offshoot of [[Capri Chasma]], and is in the [[Coprates quadrangle]].  It is named after the [[River Ganges]] in South Asia.

[[Image:Geoarchaeologistatwork.png|thumb|geoarchaeologist at work on column sample]]
'''Geoarchaeology''' is a multi-disciplinary approach which uses the techniques and subject matter of [[geography]], [[geology]] and other [[Earth science]]s to examine topics which inform [[archaeology|archaeological]] knowledge and thought. Geoarchaeologists study the natural physical processes that affect [[archaeological site]]s such as [[geomorphology]], the formation of sites through geological processes and the effects on buried sites and [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] post-deposition. Geoarchaeologists' work frequently involves studying [[soil]] and [[sediments]] as well as other geographical concepts to contribute an archaeological study. Geoarchaeologists may also use computer cartography, [[geographic information systems]] (GIS) and  [[digital elevation model]]s (DEM) in combination with disciplines from human and social sciences and earth sciences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sapiens.revues.org/index422.html Ghilardi, M. and Desruelles, S. (2008) “Geoarchaeology: where human, social and earth sciences meet with technology”. ''S.A.P.I.EN.S.'' '''1''' (2) ]&lt;/ref&gt; Geoarchaeology is  important to society because it  informs archaeologists about the geomorphology of the soil, sediments and the rocks on  the buried sites and artifacts they're researching on. By doing this we are able locate ancient cities and artifacts and estimate by the quality of soil how  "prehistoric" they really are.

==Techniques used in geoarchaeology==

===Column sampling===
Column sampling is a technique of collecting samples from a [[archaeological section|section]] for analyzing and detecting the buried processes down the profile of the section. Narrow metal tins are hammered into the section in a series to collect the complete profile for study. If more than one tin is needed they are arranged offset  and overlapping to one side so the complete profile can be rebuilt offsite in laboratory conditions.

===Loss on ignition testing===
Loss on ignition testing for [[soil]] [[Soil organic matter|organic]] content.- a technique of measuring organic content in soil samples. Samples taken from a known place in the profile collected by column sampling are weighed then placed in a fierce oven which burns off the organic content. The resulting cooked sample is weighed again and the resulting loss in weight is an indicator of organic content in the profile at a certain depth. These readings are often used to detect buried soil horizons. A buried soil's [[archaeological horizon|horizons]] may not be visible in [[archaeological section|section]] and this horizon is an indicator of possible occupation levels. Ancient land surfaces especially from the prehistoric era can be difficult to discern so this technique is useful for evaluating an areas potential for [[prehistoric]] surfaces and archaeological evidence. Comparative measurements down the profile are made and a sudden rise in organic content at some point in the profile combined with other indicators is strong evidence for buried surfaces.

[[Image:Columns.002.png|thumb|right|offset column sampling of the soil profile]]

===Magnetic susceptibility analysis===
The magnetic susceptibility of a material is a measure of its ability to become magnetised by an external magnetic field (Dearing, 1999). The magnetic susceptibility of a soil reflects the presence of magnetic iron-oxide minerals such as maghaematite; just because a soil contains a lot of iron does not mean that it will have high magnetic susceptibility. Magnetic forms of iron can be formed by burning and microbial activity such as occurs in top soils and some anaerobic deposits. Magnetic iron compounds can also be found in igneous and metamorphic rocks.

The relationship between iron and burning means that magnetic susceptibility is often used for:
* Site prospection, to identify areas of archaeological potential prior to excavation.
* Identifying hearth areas and the presence of burning residues in deposits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Enhancement of magnetic susceptibility of soils on archaeological sites. |journal= Archaeometry |volume=13  |year=1971 |pages=209–219 |author1=Tite, M.S. |author2=Mullins, C. |doi=10.1111/j.1475-4754.1971.tb00043.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Explaining whether areas of reddening are due to burning or other natural processes such as gleying (waterlogging).

The relationship between soil formation and magnetic susceptibility means that it can also be used to:
* Identify buried soils in depositional sequences.
* Identify redeposited soil materials in peat, lake sediments etc.

===Phosphate and orthophosphate content with spectrophotometry===
Phosphate in man-made soils derives from people, their animals, rubbish and bones. 100 people excrete about 62&amp;nbsp;kg of phosphate annually, with about the same from their rubbish. Their animals excrete even more. A human body contains about 650g of PO4,(500g-80% in the skeleton), which results in elevated levels in burial sites. Most is quickly immobilised on the clay of the soil and ‘fixed’, where it can persist for thousands of years. For a 1 ha site this corresponds to about 150&amp;nbsp;kg PO4 ha-1yr-1 about 0.5% to 10% of that already present in most soils. Therefore, it doesn’t take long for human occupation to make orders of magnitude differences to the phosphate concentration in soil. Phosphorus exist in different ‘pools’ in the soil 1) organic (available), 2) occluded (adsorbed), 3) bound (chemically bound). Each of these pools can be extracted using progressively more aggressive chemicals. Some workers (Eidt especially), think that the ratios between these pools can give information about past land use, and perhaps even dating.
	
Whatever the method of getting the phosphorus from the soil into solution, the method of detecting it is usually the same. This uses the ‘molybdate blue’ reaction, where the depth of the colour is proportional to phosphorus concentration. In the lab, this is measured using a colorimeter, where light shining through a standard cell produces an electric current proportional to the light attenuation. In the field, the same reaction is used on detector sticks, which are compared to a colour chart.

Phosphate concentrations can be plotted on archaeological plans to show former activity areas, and is also used to prospect for sites in the wider landscape.

===Particle size analysis===
The particle size distribution of a soil sample may indicate the conditions under which the [[stratum|strata]] or [[sediment]] were deposited. Particle sizes are generally separated by means of dry or wet sieving (coarse samples such as [[till]], [[gravel]] and [[sand]]s, sometimes coarser [[silt]]s) or by measuring the changes of the density of a dispersed solution (in sodiumpyrophosphate, for example))of the sample (finer silts, [[clay]]s). A rotating clock-glass with a very fine-grained dispersed sample under a heat lamp is useful in separating particles.

The results are plotted on curves which can be analyzed with statistical methods for particle distribution and other parameters.

The fractions received can be further investigated for cultural indicators, macro- and microfossils and other interesting features, so particle size analysis is in fact the first thing to do when handling these samples.

===Trace element geochemistry===
Trace element geochemistry is the study of the abundances of elements in geological materials that do not occur in a large quantity in these materials. Because these trace elements' concentrations are determined by a large number of particular situations under which a certain geological material is formed, they are usually unique between two locations which contain the same type of rock or other geological material.

Geoarchaeologists use this uniqueness in trace element geochemistry to trace ancient patterns of resource-acquisition and trade. For example, researchers can look at the trace element composition of obsidian artifacts in order to "fingerprint" those artifacts. They can then study the trace element composition of obsidian outcrops in order to determine the original source of the raw material used to make the artifact.

===Clay mineralogy analysis===
Geoarchaeologists study the mineralogical characteristics of pots through macroscopic and microscopic analyses. They can use these characteristics to understand the various manufacturing techniques used to make the pots, and through this, to know which production centers likely made these pots. They can also use the mineralogy to trace the raw materials used to make the pots to specific clay deposits.&lt;ref&gt;Druca, I. C. and Q. H. J. Gwynb (1997), From Clay to Pots: A Petrographical Analysis of Ceramic Production in the Callejón de Huaylas, North-Central Andes, Peru, ''Journal of Archaeological Science'', ''25'', 707-718.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ostracod analysis===
Naturally occurring Ostracods in freshwater bodies are impacted by changes in salinity  and pH due to human activities.  Analysis of Ostracod shells in sediment columns show the changes brought about by farming and habitation activities.  This record can be correlated with age dating techniques to help identify changes in human habitation patterns and population migrations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tnesr.com/images/Bayman_et_al._2004.pdf ^ Manuel R.

The '''Gibbons–Hawking effect''' is the statement that a [[temperature]] can be associated to each solution of the [[Einstein field equations]] that contains a [[causal horizon]]. It is named after [[Gary Gibbons]] and [[Stephen William Hawking]].

The term "causal horizon" does not necessarily refer to [[event horizon]]s only, but could also stand for the horizon of the visible universe, for instance.

For example, [[Schwarzschild metric|Schwarzschild spacetime]] contains an event horizon and so can be associated a temperature. In the case of Schwarzschild spacetime this is the temperature &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; of a black hole of mass &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, satisfying &lt;math&gt;T \propto M^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; (see also [[Hawking radiation]]).

A second example is [[de Sitter space]] which contains an [[event horizon]]. In this case the temperature &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is proportional to the [[Hubble constant|Hubble parameter]] &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;T \propto H&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44688">The '''Great Hippocampus Question''' was a 19th-century scientific controversy about the [[anatomy]] of [[ape]]s and human uniqueness. The dispute between [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] and [[Richard Owen]] became central to the scientific debate on [[human evolution]] that followed [[Charles Darwin]]'s publication of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''. The name comes from the title of a satire the Reverend [[Charles Kingsley]] wrote about the arguments, which in modified form appeared as "the great hippopotamus test" in Kingsley's book for children, ''[[The Water-Babies, A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby]]''. Together with other humorous skits on the topic, this helped to spread and popularise Darwin's ideas on evolution.

The key point that Owen asserted was that only humans had part of the brain then known as the [[hippocampus minor]] (now called the [[calcar avis]]), and that this gave us our unique abilities.  But careful dissection showed that apes and monkeys also have a hippocampus minor.

==Background==
In October 1836 [[Charles Darwin]] returned from the [[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|''Beagle'' voyage]] with fossil collections which the anatomist [[Richard Owen]] described, contributing to the [[inception of Darwin's theory]] of [[natural selection]]. Darwin outlined his theory in an Essay of 1844, and discussed transmutation with his friend [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]]. He did not tell Owen, who as the up-and-coming "English [[Georges Cuvier|Cuvier]]" held the conventional belief that every species was uniquely created and perfectly adapted. Owen's brilliance and political skills made him a leading figure in the scientific establishment, developing ideas of divine [[archetype]]s produced by vague secondary laws similar to a form of [[theistic evolution]], while emphasising the differences separating man from ape.&lt;ref name=villain&gt;{{citation |url=http://friendsofdarwin.com/articles/2001/owen/ |title=Sir Richard Owen: the archetypal villain |year=2006 |publisher=The Friends of Charles Darwin |accessdate=2009-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=124–126}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 1844 the anonymous book ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]'' brought wide public interest in [[transmutation of species]] and the idea that humans were descended from apes, and after a slow initial response, strong condemnation from the scientific establishment.&lt;ref name=g403/&gt;

Darwin discussed his interest in transmutation with friends including [[Charles Lyell]], and Hooker eventually read Darwin's ''Essay'' in 1847. When [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] savagely reviewed the latest edition of ''Vestiges'' in 1854, Darwin wrote to him, making friends while cautiously admitting to being "almost as unorthodox about species".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-1587.html |title= Letter 1587 — Darwin, C. R. to Huxley, T. H., 2 Sept (1854)|publisher=Darwin Correspondence Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huxley had become increasingly irritated by Owen's condescension and manipulation, and having gained a teaching position at the school of mining, began openly attacking Owen's work.&lt;ref name=g406&gt;{{harvnb|Gross|1993|pp=406–407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hippocampus minor==
In 1564 a prominent feature on the floor of the [[Lateral ventricles]] of the brain was named the [[hippocampus]] by [[Julius Caesar Aranzi|Aranzi]] as its curved shape on each side supposedly reminded him of a seahorse, the [[Hippocampus (genus)|Hippocampus]] (apart from a time after [[Johann Christoph Andreas Mayer|Mayer]] mistakenly used the term [[hippopotamus]] in 1779, and was followed by others until 1829). At that same time a ridge on the [[posterior horn of lateral ventricle|occipital horn]] was named the [[calcar avis]], but in 1786 this was renamed the hippocampus minor, with the hippocampus being called the hippocampus major.&lt;ref name=g405&gt;{{harvnb|Gross|1993|p=405}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Gray739-emphasizing-hippocampus-minor.png|thumb|left|alt=brain, cut away and labelled to show its internal parts|The [[calcar avis|hippocampus minor]] is a small fold on the [[posterior horn of lateral ventricle|occipital horn]] towards the back of the brain (to the right) to the rear of the [[hippocampus|hippocampus major]] which forms a curved ridge on each side of the lower central area.]]

[[Richard Owen]] presented several papers on the anatomical differences between apes and humans, arguing that they had been created separately and stressing the impossibility of apes being transmuted into men.&lt;ref name=g404&gt;{{harvnb|Gross|1993|p=404}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1857 he went even further, presenting an authoritative paper to the [[Linnean Society of London]] on his anatomical studies of [[primate]] brains and asserting that humans were not merely a distinct [[Order (biology)|biological order]] of primates, as had been accepted by great anatomists such as [[Carl Linnaeus]] and [[Georges Cuvier]], but a separate [[Class (biology)|sub-class]] of [[mammal]]ia, distinct from all the other primates and mammals generally. Owen supported his argument with a figure by himself of a South American monkey, a figure of a negro's brain by [[Friedrich Tiedemann]], and of a chimpanzee's brain by [[Jacobus Schroeder van der Kolk]] and [[Willem Vrolik]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lyell|1863|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&amp;itemID=A282&amp;pageseq=502 480–481]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Owen conceded the "all-pervading similitude of structure—every tooth, every bone, strictly homologous" which made it difficult for anatomists to determine the difference between man and ape, he based his new classification on three characteristics which to him distinguished mankind's "highest form of brain", the most important being his claim that only the [[human brain]] has a hippocampus minor. To Owen in 1857, this feature together with the extent to which the [[occipital lobe|"posterior lobe"]] projected beyond the [[cerebellum]] and the presence of the posterior horn were how man "fulfills his destiny as the supreme master of this earth and of the lower creation."&lt;ref name=g403&gt;{{harvnb|Gross|1993|pp=403–405}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Darwin]] commented, "Owen's is a grand Paper; but I cannot swallow Man making a division as distinct from a Chimpanzee, as an [[Platypus|ornithorhynchus]] from a Horse: I wonder what a Chimpanzee wd. say to this?".&lt;ref name=Letter2117&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-2117.html |title= Letter 2117 — Darwin, C. R. to Hooker, J. D., 5 July (1857) |publisher=Darwin Correspondence Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owen repeated the paper as the [[Rede Lecture]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] on 10 May 1859 when he was the first to be given an honorary degree by the university.&lt;ref name=g403/&gt;&lt;ref name=o26&gt;{{harvnb|Owen|1859|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&amp;itemID=A335&amp;pageseq=34 26]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] the claim about the hippocampus minor appeared to be a significant blunder by Owen, and Huxley began systematically dissecting the brains of monkeys, determined that "before I have done with that mendacious humbug I will nail him out, like a kite to a barn door, an example to all evil doers." He did not discuss this in public at this stage,&lt;ref name=g407&gt;{{harvnb|Gross|1993|pp=407–408}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dm504&gt;{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=504–505}}&lt;/ref&gt; but continued to attack Owen's other ideas, aiming to undermine Owen's status. At his 17 June 1858 [[Royal Institution]] [[Croonian Lecture]] "On the Theory of the Vertebrate Skull", Huxley directly challenged Owen's central idea of archetypes shown by homology, with Owen in the audience. Huxley's aim was to overcome the domination of science by wealthy clergymen led by Owen, in order to create a professional salaried scientific civil service and make science [[secularism|secular]]. Under Darwin's influence he took up transmutation as a way of dividing science from theology, and in January 1859 argued that "it is as respectable to be modified monkey as modified dirt".&lt;ref name=dm472&gt;{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=472–473}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="urlT. H. Huxley: Letters and Diary: 1859"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/letters/59.html |title=T. H. Huxley: Letters and Diary: 1859}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Owen and Huxley debate human and ape brain structure===
[[File:The Lion of the Season.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A servant in Victorian livery stands awkwardly at an open door, his mouth open and hair standing on end, as a gorilla wearing a white tie full dress tailcoat enters.|Following publication of Darwin's theory, ape ancestry became a fashionable talking point: in May 1861, an "alarmed flunkey" stammers in announcing "Mr G-G-G-O-O-O-Rilla.]]
Huxley was among the friends rallying round the publication of Darwin's ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', and was sharpening his "beak and claws" to disembowel "the curs who will bark and yelp".&lt;ref name="Letter=2544"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-2544.html|title= Letter 2544 — Huxley, T. H. to Darwin, C. R., 23 Nov (1859)|publisher= Darwin Correspondence Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1887|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1452.2&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=244 228–232]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Kingsley]] was sent a review copy, and told Darwin that he had "long since, from watching the crossing of domesticated animals and plants, learnt to disbelieve the dogma of the permanence of species."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1887|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1452.2&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=303 287].}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin was delighted that this "celebrated author and divine" had "gradually learnt to see that it is just as noble a conception of the Deity to believe that He created a few original forms capable of self-development into other and needful forms, as to believe that He required a fresh act of creation to supply the voids caused by the action of His laws."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1860|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F376&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=499 481].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While reviews were by custom anonymous, their authors were usually known. Huxley's reviews of ''On the Origin of Species'' irritated Owen, whose own anonymous review in April praised himself and his own ''axiom of the continuous operation of the ordained becoming of living things'', took offence at the way the creationist position had been depicted, and complained that his own pre-eminence had been ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Owen|1860}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owen bitterly attacked Huxley, Hooker and Darwin, but also signalled acceptance of a kind of evolution as a [[teleology|teleological]] plan in a continuous "ordained becoming", with new species appearing by natural birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=490–491, 545–547}}&lt;br&gt;{{harvnb|Secord|2003|p=512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dispute between Huxley and Owen over human uniqueness began in public at the [[1860 Oxford evolution debate]], during a meeting of the [[British Science Association|British Association for the Advancement of Science]] in Oxford on Thursday 28 June 1860. After [[Charles Daubeny]]'s paper "On the Final Causes of the Sexuality of Plants with Particular Reference to Mr. Darwin's Work", the chairman asked Huxley for comments, but he declined as he thought the public venue inappropriate. Owen then spoke of facts which would enable the public to "come to some conclusions&amp;nbsp;... of the truth of Mr. Darwin's theory", reportedly arguing that "the brain of the gorilla was more different from that of man than from that of the lowest primate particularly because only man had a posterior lobe, a posterior horn, and a hippocampus minor." In response, Huxley flatly but politely "denied altogether that the difference between the brain of the gorilla and man was so great" in a "direct and unqualified contradiction" of Owen, citing previous studies as well as promising to provide detailed support for his position.&lt;ref name=g407/&gt;&lt;ref name=thomson&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/2000/5/huxley-wilberforce-and-the-oxford-museum |title=Huxley, Wilberforce and the Oxford Museum |last= Thomson |first=Keith Stewart |date= May–June 2000 |publisher=[[American Scientist]] |accessdate=2009-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=119–122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anguish over the death of his son of [[scarlet fever]] in September 1860 pushed Huxley to the brink, from which Kingsley rescued him by a series of letters. Huxley put his fury over the death into composing a paper which violently assaulted Owen's ideas and professional reputation. It was published in January 1861 in the first issue of Huxley's relaunched ''[[Natural History Review]]'' magazine, and presented citations, quotations and letters from leading anatomists to attack Owen's three claims, aiming to prove him "guilty of wilful and deliberate falsehood" by citing Owen himself, and (with less clear cut justification) the anatomists whose illustrations Owen had used in the 1857 paper. While readily agreeing that the human brain differed from that of apes in size, proportions and complexity of convolutions, Huxley played the significance of these features down, and argued that to a lesser extent these also differed between the "highest" and "lowest" human races.&lt;ref name=g407/&gt;&lt;ref name=b136&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=136–138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin congratulated Huxley on this "smasher" against the "canting humbug" Owen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-3041.html |title= Letter 3041 — Darwin, C. R. to Huxley, T. H., 3 Jan (1861) |publisher=Darwin Correspondence Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; From February to May Huxley delivered a very popular series of [[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|sixpenny]] lectures for working men at the [[Imperial College London|School of Mines]] where he taught, on "The Relation of Man to the Rest of the Animal Kingdom". He told his wife that "My working men stick by me wonderfully, the house being fuller than ever last night. By next Friday evening they will all be convinced that they are monkeys."&lt;ref name=b136/&gt;&lt;ref name=THH61&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/letters/61.html |title=T. H.

[[Gorilla]]s became the topic of the day with the return of the explorer [[Paul Du Chaillu]]. Owen arranged for him to speak and display his collections on stage at a spectacular [[Royal Geographical Society]] meeting on 25 February, and followed this by giving a lecture at the [[Royal Institution]] on 19 March on the brains of ''The Gorilla and the Negro'', asserting that the dispute was one of interpretation rather than fact,&lt;ref name=b156&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=156–159}}&lt;/ref&gt; and hedging his previous claim by stating that humans alone had a hippocampus minor "as defined in human anatomy". This lecture was published in the ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|Athenæum]]'' on 23 March with unlabelled and inaccurate illustrations, and Huxley's response in the next issue a week later, ''Man and the Apes'', ridiculed Owen's use of these illustrations and failure to mention the findings of anatomists that the three structures were present in animals. In the following week's issue Owen's letter blamed "the Artist" for the illustrations, but claimed that the argument was correct and referred the reader to his 1858 paper.&lt;ref name=b156/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/comm/ScPr/owen.html |title=The Gorilla and the Negro (1861) |publisher=The Huxley File}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/UnColl/PMG/PMGetal/Man-Apes.html |title=Man and the Apes (1861) |publisher=The Huxley File}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=g409&gt;{{harvnb|Gross|1993|pp=409–410}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Athenæum'' of 13 April Huxley responded to this repetition of the claim by writing that "Life is too short to occupy oneself with the slaying of the slain more than once."&lt;ref name="Browne 2002 159"&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|2002|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Athenaeum|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=evbfIPxyEW4C&amp;pg=PA498|year=1861|publisher=British Periodicals Limited|page=498}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each Saturday, Darwin read the latest ripostes in the ''Athenæum''. Owen tried to smear Huxley by portraying him as an "advocate of man's origins from a transmuted ape", and one of his contributions was titled "Ape-Origin of Man as Tested by the Brain". This backfired, as Huxley had already delighted Darwin by speculating on "pithecoid man" (ape-like man), and was glad of the invitation to publicly turn the anatomy of brain structure into a question of human ancestry. Darwin egged him on from Down, writing "Oh Lord what a thorn you must be in the poor dear man's side".&lt;ref name=dm504/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url= http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-3107.html|title=Letter 3107 — Darwin, C. R. to Huxley, T. H., 1 Apr (1861)|publisher= Darwin Correspondence Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huxley told Darwin's friend [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]], "Owen occupied an entirely untenable position&amp;nbsp;... The fact is he made a prodigious blunder in commencing the attack, and now his only chance is to be silent and let people forget the exposure. I do not believe that in the whole history of science there is a case of any man of reputation getting himself into such a contemptible position. He will be the laughing-stock of all the continental anatomists."&lt;ref name=THH61/&gt;&lt;ref name=pat/&gt;

===Public interest and satire===
This very public slanging match attracted wide attention, and humorists were quick to take up the opportunity for satire. ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' featured the issue several times that year, notably on 18 May 1861 when a cartoon under the heading ''Monkeyana'' showed a standing gorilla with a sign parodying [[Josiah Wedgwood#"Am I Not a Man And a Brother?"|Josiah Wedgwood's]] anti-slavery slogan "Am I Not A Man And A Brother?". This was accompanied by a satirical poem by "Gorilla" at the zoo asking to be told if he was "A man in ape's shape, An anthropoid ape, Or monkey deprived of his tail?", and noting:&lt;ref name=b157&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=157–158}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=R221/&gt;
[[File:Monkeyana.png|thumb|right|alt=A gorilla standing upright with the aid of a stick, wearing a placard:|Am I A Man And A Brother?]]
{{quote|
:Says Owen, you can see
:The brain of Chimpanzee
:Is always exceedingly small,
:With the hindermost "horn"
:Of extremity shorn,
:And no "Hippocampus" at all.}}
It then recounts Huxley's ripostes, and: 
{{quote|
:Next Huxley replies,
:That Owen he lies,
:And garbles his Latin quotation;
:That his facts are not new,
:His mistakes not a few.
:Detrimental to his reputation.

:"To twice slay the slain,"
:By dint of the Brain,
:(Thus Huxley concludes his review)
:Is but labour in vain,
:Unproductive of gain.
:And so I shall bid you "Adieu!"|Gorilla (Sir Philip Egerton), ''Monkeyana''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gross|1993|p=411}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The poem was actually by the eminent palaeontologist [[Sir Philip Grey Egerton, 10th Baronet|Sir Philip Egerton]] who, as a trustee of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|Royal College of Surgeons]] and the [[British Museum]], acted as Owen's patron. When a delighted Huxley found out who the author of the piece was, he thought it "speaks volumes for Owen's perfect success in damning himself."&lt;ref name=b157/&gt;

In the second issue of Huxley's ''Natural History Review'', an article by [[George Rolleston]] on the [[orangutan]] brain showed the features that Owen claimed apes lacked, and when Owen responded in a letter to the ''[[Journal of Natural History|Annals and Magazine of Natural History]]'' that the issue was a matter of definition rather than fact, Huxley made a public dissection of a [[spider monkey]] that had died at the zoo, to support his case. In the following issue [[John Marshall (anatomist)|John Marshall]] provided detailed measurements making the same point about the [[chimpanzee]], as well as explaining how a chimpanzee's brain could be distorted by not being properly preserved and removed from the skull, so that it would look like the one in Owen's illustration.&lt;ref name=g409/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marshall|first=John|date=1860|title=On the brain of a young Chimpanzee|journal=Natural History Review|pages=296–315|url=https://archive.org/stream/naturalhistoryre1861belf#page/296/mode/2up|accessdate=Apr 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Great Hippocampus Question==
The debate continued in 1862. A detailed paper by [[William Henry Flower]] in the prestigious journal, the ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]'', reviewed the earlier literature and presented his own studies based on having dissected sixteen species of primates, including [[prosimian]]s, monkeys and an [[orangutan]]. Having stated at the outset that he had no opinion on transmutation or the origin of humans, he refuted Owen's three claims, and went further, stating that in relation to the mass of the brain, the hippocampus minor was proportionately largest in the [[marmoset]], and proportionately smallest in mankind. The paper used terms recently coined by Huxley, and Flower was one of his close colleagues. Huxley presented more evidence against Owen in his ''[[Natural History Review]]''. The Dutch anatomists [[Jacobus Schroeder van der Kolk]] and [[Willem Vrolik]] found that Owen had repeatedly used their 1849 illustration of a chimpanzee's brain to support his arguments, and to prevent the public from being misled they dissected the brain of an orangutan that had died in the Amsterdam zoo, reporting at a meeting of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] that the three features Owen claimed were unique to humans were present in this ape. They admitted that their earlier illustration was incorrect due to the way they had removed the brain for inspection, and suggested that Owen had become "lost" and "fell into a trap" in debating against Darwin. Huxley reprinted the report, in French, in his ''Review''. His confrontations with Owen went on.&lt;ref name=g410&gt;{{harvnb|Gross|1993|pp=410–411}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He wears a jacket with very wide lapels, an upright collar and wide tie tucked into his double breasted waistcoat.|[[Lord Dundreary]], as featured in the play ''[[Our American Cousin]]'' noted for its association with the [[Abraham Lincoln assassination]] in 1865.]]
At the 1862 [[British Science Association|British Association]] meeting in Cambridge that year, Owen presented two papers opposing Darwin: one claimed that the adaptations of the [[Aye-aye]] disproved evolution, and the second paper reiterated Owen's claims about human brains being unique, as well as discussing the question of whether apes have toes or thumbs. Huxley said Owen appeared to be "lying &amp; shuffling", and Huxley's allies presented successive attacks on Owen. This was the first British Association annual meeting attended by [[Charles Kingsley]], and during the meeting he produced a privately printed satirical skit on the argument, "a little squib for circulation among his friends" written in the style of the then popular stage character [[Lord Dundreary]], a good natured but brainless aristocrat known for huge bushy sideburns and for mangling proverbs or sayings in "[[Dundrearyism]]s". The skit was titled ''Speech of Lord Dundreary in Section D, on Friday Last, On the Great Hippocampus Question''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|2002|p=160}}&lt;br&gt;{{harvnb|Rupke|2009|p=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|we were very much delighted, and I may say, quite interested, to find that we had all hippopotamuses in our brains. Of course they're right, you know, because seeing's believing.&lt;br&gt;Certainly, I never felt one in mine; but perhaps it's dead, and so didn't stir, and then of course, it don't count, you know.&amp;nbsp;.... every one has brains in his head, unless he's a skeleton; and it curled its tail round things like a monkey, that I know, for I saw it with my own eyes. That was Professor Rolleston's theory, you know. It was Professor Huxley said it was in his tail–not Mr. Huxley's, of course, but the ape's: only apes have no tails, so I don't quite see that. And then the other gentleman who got up last, Mr. Flower, you know, he said that it was all over the ape, everywhere. All over hippocampuses, from head to foot, poor beast, like a dog all over ticks! I wonder why they don't rub bluestone into the back of its neck, as one does to a pointer. Well, then. Where was I? Oh! and Professor Owen said it wasn't in apes at all: but only in the order bimana, that's you and me. Well, he know best. And they all know best too, for they are monstrous clever fellows. So one must be right, and all the rest wrong, or else one of them wrong, and all the rest right–you see that? I wonder why they don't toss up about it.&lt;br&gt;
Professor Huxley says there's a gulf between a man and an ape. I'm sure I'm glad of it, especially if the ape bit; and Professor Owen says there ain't. What? am I wrong, eh? Of course. Yes–beg a thousand pardons, really now. Of course–Professor Owen says there is, and Professor Huxley says there ain't. Well, a fellow can't recollect everything. But I say, if there's a gulf, the ape might get over it and bite one after all.|Charles Kingsley, ''Speech of Lord Dundreary in Section D, on Friday Last, On the Great Hippocampus Question''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/comm/Books/Dundreary.html |title=Lord Dundreary (1861) |publisher=The Huxley File}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The ''[[BMJ|British Medical Journal]]'' asked, "Is it not high time that the annual passage of barbed words between Professor Owen and Professor Huxley, on the cerebral distinction between men and monkeys, should cease?&amp;nbsp;... Continued on its present footing, it becomes a hindrance and an injury to science, a joke for the populace, and a scandal to the scientific world." The London ''[[Quarterly Review]]'' took up the joke, describing the confrontation of Owen with Huxley and his supporters [[George Rolleston|Rolleston]] and Flower dramatically: "Animation increased, 'decorous reticence' was at an end, and all parties enjoyed the scene except the disputants. Surely apes were never before so honoured, as to be the theme of the warmest discussion in one of the two principal university towns in England. Strange sight was this, that three or four most accomplished anatomists were contending against each other like so many gorillas, and either reducing man to a monkey, or elevating the monkey to the man!"&lt;ref name=R221&gt;{{harvnb|Rupke|2009|p=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October the ''[[Medical Times and Gazette]]'' reported Owen's presentation with full detail of the responses by Huxley, Rolleston and Flower, as well as Owen's rebuttal. The dispute continued in the next two issues of the magazine.&lt;ref name=g410/&gt;

===The great hippopotamus test===
[[Image:Water-babies 2.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=The faces and shoulders of two men looking closely at a child sitting inside a cloth stoppered large glass vessel on a high table, who looks back towards them.|Richard Owen and Thomas Henry Huxley inspect a water baby in a large [[carboy]], in [[Linley Sambourne]]'s 1885 illustration]]
At about the same time as he was attending the Cambridge [[British Science Association|British Association]] meeting in 1862, instalments of Charles Kingsley's story for children ''[[The Water-Babies, A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby]]'' were being published in ''[[Macmillan's Magazine]]'' as a serial. Kingsley incorporated material modified from his skit about Dundreary's speech ''On the Great Hippocampus Question'', as well as other references to the protagonists, the British Association, and notable scientists of the day. When the protagonist Tom is turned into a water-baby by the fairies, the question is raised that if there were water-babies, surely someone would have caught one and "put it into spirits, or into the ''Illustrated News'', or perhaps cut it into two halves, poor dear little thing, and sent one to Professor Owen, and one to Professor Huxley, to see what they would each say about it."&lt;ref name=rr221&gt;{{harvnb|Rupke|2009|pp=221–222}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for the suggestion that a water-baby is contrary to nature;
{{quote|You must not say that this cannot be, or that that is contrary to nature. You do not know what Nature is, or what she can do; and nobody knows; not even Sir [[Roderick Murchison]], or Professor Owen, or Professor [[Adam Sedgwick|Sedgwick]], or Professor Huxley, or Mr. Darwin, or Professor [[Michael Faraday|Faraday]], or Mr. [[William Robert Grove|Grove]], or any other of the great men whom good boys are taught to respect. They are very wise men; and you must listen respectfully to all they say: but even if they should say, which I am sure they never would, “That cannot exist. That is contrary to nature,” you must wait a little, and see; for perhaps even they may be wrong.|Charles Kingsley, ''The Water Babies''.&lt;ref name=WB/&gt;}}

Keeping up an even-handed treatment, Kingsley introduced as a character in the story Professor Ptthmllnsprts (Put-them-all-in-spirits) as an amalgam of Owen and Huxley, satirising each in turn. Like the very possessive Owen, the Professor was "very good to all the world as long as it was good to him. Only one fault he had, which cock-robins have likewise, as you may see if you look out of the nursery window—that, when any one else found a curious worm, he would hop round them, and peck them, and set up his tail, and bristle up his feathers, just as a cock-robin would; and declare that he found the worm first; and that it was his worm; and, if not, that then it was not a worm at all." Like Huxley, "the professor had not the least notion of allowing that things were true, merely because people thought them beautiful.&amp;nbsp;... The professor, indeed, went further, and held that no man was forced to believe anything to be true, but what he could see, hear, taste, or handle." A paragraph on "the great hippopotamus test" opens with the Professor, like Huxley, declaring "that apes had hippopotamus majors in their brains just as men have", but then like Owen presenting the argument that "If you have a hippopotamus major in your brain, you are no ape".&lt;ref name=rr221/&gt;

{{quote|He held very strange theories about a good many things. He had even got up once at the British Association, and declared that apes had hippopotamus majors in their brains just as men have. Which was a shocking thing to say; for, if it were so, what would become of the faith, hope, and charity of immortal millions? You may think that there are other more important differences between you and an ape, such as being able to speak, and make machines, and know right from wrong, and say your prayers, and other little matters of that kind; but that is a child’s fancy, my dear. Nothing is to be depended on but the great hippopotamus test. If you have a hippopotamus major in your brain, you are no ape, though you had four hands, no feet, and were more apish than the apes of all aperies. But if a hippopotamus major is ever discovered in one single ape’s brain, nothing will save your great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-greater-greatest-grandmother from having been an ape too. No, my dear little man; always remember that the one true, certain, final, and all-important difference between you and an ape is, that you have a hippopotamus major in your brain, and it has none; and that, therefore, to discover one in its brain will be a very wrong and dangerous thing, at which every one will be very much shocked, as we may suppose they were at the professor.—Though really, after all, it don’t much matter; because—as Lord Dundreary and others would put it—nobody but men have hippopotamuses in their brains; so, if a hippopotamus was discovered in an ape’s brain, why it would not be one, you know, but something else.|Charles Kingsley, ''The Water Babies''.&lt;ref name=WB&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext97/wtrbs10h.htm |title=The Water-Babies |last= Kingsley |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles Kingsley|publisher=[[Project Gutenberg]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Then, presented with the awkward question, "But why are there not water-babies?", the Professor in Huxley's characteristic voice answered quite sharply: "Because there ain’t."&lt;ref name=WB/&gt;

''The Water-Babies'' was published in book form in 1863, and in the same year an even more satirical short play was published anonymously by [[George Pycroft]].&lt;ref name=rr221/&gt; In ''A Report of a Sad Case Recently Tried before the Lord Mayor, Owen versus Huxley... the Great Bone Case'', the vulgarity of the behaviour of Owen and Huxley is parodied as them being taken to court for brawling
in the streets and disturbing the peace. In court, they shout terms such as "posterior cornu" and "hippocampus minor". In giving evidence, Huxley states "Well, as I was saying, Owen and me is in the same trade; and we both cuts up monkeys, and I finds something in the brains of them. Hallo! says I, here's a hippocampus. No, there ain't says Owen. Look here says I. I can't see it he says and he sets to werriting and haggling about it, and goes and tells everybody, as what I finds ain't there, and what he finds is".&lt;ref name=g412&gt;{{harvnb|Gross|1993|p=412}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Man's Place in Nature==

"Photographically reduced from Diagrams of the natural size (except that of the Gibbon, which was twice as large as nature), drawn by Mr. Waterhouse Hawkins from specimens in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons."

Huxley expanded his lectures for working men into a book titled ''[[Man's Place in Nature|Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature]]'', published in 1863. His intention was expressed in a letter to [[Charles Lyell]] which referred to the ''Monkeyana'' poem of 1861: "I do not think you will find room to complain of any want of distinctness in my definition of Owen's position touching the Hippocampus question. I mean to give the whole history of the business in a note, so that the paraphrase of Sir Ph. Egerton's line 'To which Huxley replies that Owen he lies', shall be unmistakable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/letters/62.html |title=T. H. Huxley: Letters and Diary: 1862}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin exclaimed, "Hurrah the monkey book has come".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-3996.html |title= Letter 3996 — Darwin, C. R. to Huxley, T. H., 18 (Feb 1863) |publisher=Darwin Correspondence Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; A central part of the book provides a step by step explanation suitable for newcomers to anatomy of how the brains of apes and humans are fundamentally similar, with particular reference to both having a posterior lobe, a posterior horn, and a hippocampus minor. The chapter concludes that this close similarity between apes and mankind proves that the original definition by [[Linnaeus]] of the [[Order (biology)|biological Order]] of [[Primate]]s was correct to include both, and mentions that an explanation of humans originating from apes is provided by Darwin's theory. The book also includes six pages of small print giving "a succinct History of the Controversy respecting the Cerebral Structure of Man and the Apes" describing how Owen had "suppressed" and denied what Huxley had now shown to be the truth regarding the hippocampus minor, posterior horn, and posterior lobe, describing this as reflecting on Owen's "personal veracity". Reviewers regarded the book as a polemic against Owen, and a majority of them sided with Huxley.&lt;ref name=g412/&gt;

[[Image:Lyell Structure Of Brain.png|thumb|right|alt=side views of two brains|Lyell's book included an illustration showing the distorted image of a chimpanzee brain used by Owen, and a correct view by another anatomist showing the projection of the [[occipital lobe]] at the rear which Owen said was not present in apes.]]
Sir Charles Lyell's authoritative ''[[Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man]]'' was also published in 1863, and included a detailed review of the hippocampus question which gave solid and unambiguous support to Huxley's arguments. In an attempt to refute Lyell's judgement, Owen again defended his classification scheme, introducing a new claim that the hippocampus minor was virtually absent in an "idiot". Then in 1866 Owen's book ''On the Anatomy of Vertebrates'' presented accurate brain illustrations. In a long footnote, Owen cited himself and the earlier literature to admit at last that in apes "all the homologous parts of the human cerebral organ exist". However, he still believed that this did not invalidate his classification of man in a separate subclass. He now claimed that the structures concerned – the posterior lobe, the posterior horn, and the hippocampus minor – were in apes only "under modified form and low grades of development". He accused Huxley and his allies of making "puerile", "ridiculous" and "disgraceful" attacks on his scheme of classification.&lt;ref name=g412b&gt;{{harvnb|Gross|1993|pp=412–413}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The publicity surrounding the affair tarnished Owen's reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url= http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/owen.html |title=Richard Owen (1804–1892) |author=Ben Waggoner |year=2000 |publisher=[[University of California Museum of Paleontology]] |accessdate=2009-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Owen had a laudable aim of finding an objective way of defining the uniqueness of humanity and distinguishing their brain anatomy in a qualitative way, not just a quantitative way, his obstinacy in refusing to admit his errors in trying to find that difference led to his fall from the pinnacle of British science.&lt;ref name=g412b/&gt; Huxley gained influence, and his [[X Club]] of like minded scientists used the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' to promote evolution and naturalism, shaping much of late Victorian science.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Larson|2004|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even many of his supporters, including [[Charles Lyell]] and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], thought that though humans shared a common ancestor with apes, the higher mental faculties could not have evolved through a purely material process. Darwin published his own explanation in 1871 in the ''[[Descent of Man]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=208–211, 214–216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern relevance==
In a talk about biological [[systematics]] (classification) and [[cladistics]] given at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in 1981, the [[paleontology|paleontologist]] [[Colin Patterson (paleontologist)|Colin Patterson]] discussed an argument put in a paper by [[Ernst Mayr]] that humans could be distinguished from apes by the presence of [[Broca's area]] in the brain. Patterson commented that this reminded him of "The Great Hippocampus Question" as recorded in fiction by Kingsley, and as in fact being a controversy between Huxley and Owen that "eventually as usual, Huxley won."&lt;ref name=pat&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.linnean.org/fileadmin/images/Linnean/Linnean_Archive/Linnean_18-2_April_2002.pdf |title=Speech by Dr. Colin Patterson at the American Museum of Natural History, New York City, November 5, 1981 |work=Anniversary Meeting 2002 |publisher=The Linnean 2002 Volume 18 |format=PDF |pages=18–19 |accessdate=2009-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/patterson.html |title=Patterson Misquoted: A Tale of Two 'Cites' |author=Lionel Theunissen |date=June 24, 1997 |publisher=[[TalkOrigins Archive]] |accessdate=2009-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Guided-mode resonance''' or '''waveguide-mode resonance''' is a phenomenon wherein the guided [[normal mode|mode]]s of an [[optical waveguide]] can be excited and simultaneously extracted by the introduction of a phase-matching element, such as a [[diffraction grating]] or [[prism (optics)|prism]]. Such guided modes are also called "[[leaky mode]]s", as they do not remain guided, and have been observed in one and two-dimensional [[photonic crystal]] slabs.

==Grating coupler==
An example of guided-mode resonance is a ''grating coupler'', which is a region on top of or below a waveguide where there is a grating. Off-resonance light incident on the grating behaves almost the same as it would if it was incident in an area where there is no grating. Waveguides are usually made of [[dielectric]] and are transparent. For specific combinations of incident angles and light frequency, there is resonance, allowing the grating to couple light into a guided mode of the waveguide.

Typically, the grating coupler has only a few periods, so light can be coupled into the waveguide, but not back out. In such a case, light will be guided in the waveguide until it reaches the waveguide edge, or an additional coupling element, which will couple the light out. The larger the [[diffraction efficiency]] of the grating, the larger percent of light that would be coupled in. If the grating is used as a coupling-out element, the larger the diffraction efficiency, the fewer periods would be needed to couple the light out.

==Grating waveguide structures==
A [[grating]] coupler that is extended over the whole surface of the grating results in a combined structure sometimes called a ''grating waveguide structure.''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Quaranta|first=Giorgio|last2=Basset|first2=Guillaume|last3=Martin|first3=Olivier J. F.|last4=Gallinet|first4=Benjamin|date=2018-07-30|title=Recent Advances in Resonant Waveguide Gratings|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/lpor.201800017|journal=Laser &amp; Photonics Reviews|language=en|pages=1800017|doi=10.1002/lpor.201800017|issn=1863-8880}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such a structure, light cannot be guided, as any light coupled in is also coupled out. At resonance, a normally transparent structure becomes reflective. If the grating period is sub-wavelength, then the normally-transparent structure becomes a mirror under resonance conditions. These conditions include the angle, frequency ([[wavelength]]), and [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] of the incident light. At resonance, there is also a much higher intensity in the waveguide region. Such intensities are called ''evanescent'' as they decay exponentially outside of the waveguide region.

The guided mode resonance can be used to design filters and sensors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2555">In [[control theory]], '''Hankel singular values''', named after [[Hermann Hankel]], provide a measure of energy for each state in a system. They are the basis for [[balanced model reduction]], in which high energy states are retained while low energy states are discarded. The reduced model retains the important features of the original model.

Hankel singular values are calculated as the square roots, {σ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;''i''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,…,''n''}, of the [[eigenvalue]]s, {λ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;''i''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,…,''n''}, for the product of the [[controllability Gramian]], ''W&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'', and the [[observability Gramian]], ''W&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;''.

'''Homogeneity and heterogeneity''' are concepts often used in the sciences and statistics relating to the uniformity in a substance or organism. A material or image that is '''homogeneous''' is uniform in composition or character (i.e. color, shape, size, weight, height, distribution, texture, language, income, disease, temperature, radioactivity, architectural design, etc.); one that is '''heterogeneous''' is distinctly nonuniform in one of these qualities.&lt;ref name=websters-hetrogeneity&gt;

==Etymology and spelling==
The words '''homogeneous''' and '''heterogeneous''' come from [[Medieval Latin]] ''homogeneus'' and ''heterogeneus'', from [[Ancient Greek]] ὁμογενής (''homogenēs'') and  ἑτερογενής (''heterogenēs''), from ὁμός (''homos'', “same”) and ἕτερος (''heteros'', “other, another, different”) respectively, followed by γένος (''genos'', “kind”); -ous is an adjectival suffix.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/heterogeneous Heterogeneous.]  Definition in the Oxford English Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

The alternate spellings omitting a final ''e'' are commonly, but incorrectly, used: homogenous strictly is a biological/pathological term which has largely been replaced by "[[Homology (biology)|homologous]]".  Use of homogenous to mean "homogeneous" has seen a sufficient rise since 2000 to render it an "established variant".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/homogeneous Homogeneous.] Definitions from the Oxford England Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; "Heterogenous" is a spelling also traditionally reserved to biology and [[pathology]] which refers to the property of an object in the body having its origin outside the body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://grammarist.com/usage/heterogeneous-heterogenous/ Heterogeneous vs. heterogenous] - Grammarist (grammarist.com)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scaling==
The concept is the same to every level of complexity, from [[atom]]s to [[population]]s of [[animal]]s or [[Human|people]], and [[Galaxy|galaxies]]{{Clarify|date=September 2010}}. Hence, an element may be homogeneous on a larger scale, compared to being heterogeneous on a smaller scale. This is known as an [[effective medium approximations|effective medium]] approach, or effective medium approximations.&lt;ref name=Gueguen&gt;

===Chemistry===
{{Main|Homogeneous and heterogeneous mixtures}}
In [[chemistry]], a [[heterogeneous mixture]] consists of either or both of a) multiple states of matter or b) [[hydrophilic]] and [[hydrophobic]] substances in one mixture; an example of the latter would be a mixture of water, [[octane]], and [[silicone grease]]. Heterogeneous solids, liquids, and gases may be made homogeneous by melting, stirring, or by allowing time to pass for [[diffusion]] to distribute the molecules evenly. For example, adding dye to water will create a heterogeneous solution at first, but will become homogeneous over time. [[Entropy]] allows for heterogeneous substances to become homogeneous over time.

A heterogeneous mixture is a [[mixture]] of two or more [[Chemical compound|compounds]]. Examples are: mixtures of sand and water or sand and iron filings, a conglomerate rock, water and oil, a salad, [[trail mix]], and concrete (not cement).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gamow|first=George|title=One Two Three... Infinity|date=April 1967|publisher=Bantam|edition=Bantam Science and Mathematics, 5th printing|authorlink=George Gamow|accessdate=|page=117|type=Mass market paperback|chapter=Chapter VI, "Descending Staircase"|quote=[Clam chowder] represents a nice example of what is known as a heterogeneous material.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A mixture can be determined to be homogeneous when everything is settled and equal, and the liquid, gas, the object is one color or the same form. Various models have been proposed to model the concentrations in different phases. The phenomena to be considered are mass rates and reaction.

====Homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions====
Homogeneous reactions are [[chemical reaction]]s in which the reactants and products are in the same [[phase (matter)|phase]], while heterogeneous reactions have [[reactant]]s in two or more phases. Reactions that take place on the surface of a catalyst of a different phase are also heterogeneous. A reaction between two gases or two miscible liquids is homogeneous. A reaction between a gas and a liquid, a gas and a solid or a liquid and a solid is heterogeneous. {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

===Geology===
Earth is a heterogeneous substance in many aspects. e.g. [[rocks]] (geology) are inherently heterogeneous, usually occurring at the micro-scale and mini-scale.&lt;ref name=Gueguen/&gt;

===Information technology===
With [[information technology]], [[heterogeneous computing]] occurs in a [[network science|network]] comprising different types of computers, potentially with vastly differing [[computer memory|memory]] sizes, processing power and even basic underlying architecture. {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}
{{see also|Heterogeneous network}}

===Mathematics and statistics===
In algebra, [[homogeneous polynomial]]s have the same number of factors of a given kind.

In the study of [[binary relation]]s, a '''homogeneous relation''' is a [[binary relation#Relations over a set|relation on a set X]] (''R'' ⊆ ''X'' × ''X'' ) while a [[heterogeneous relation]] concerns distinct sets (''R'' ⊆ ''X'' × ''Y'', &amp;nbsp;''X'' ≠ ''Y'' ).

In statistical [[meta-analysis]], [[study heterogeneity]] is when multiple studies on an effect are actually measuring somewhat different effects due to differences in subject population, intervention, choice of analysis, experimental design, etc.; this can cause problems in attempts to summarize the meaning of the studies.

===Medicine===
In [[medicine]] and [[genetics]], a [[genetic heterogeneity|genetic]] or [[allelic heterogeneity|allelic]] heterogeneous condition is one where the same disease or condition can be caused, or contributed to, by several factors, or in genetic terms, by varying or different [[gene]]s or [[allele]]s.

In [[cancer research]], cancer cell heterogeneity is thought to be one of the underlying reasons that make treatment of [[cancer]] difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bhatia|first=Sangeeta|author2=John V Frangioni |author3=Robert M Hoffman |author4=A John Iafrate |author5=Kornelia Polyak |title=The challenges posed by cancer heterogeneity|journal=Nature Biotechnology|date=10 July 2012|volume=30|pages=604–610|doi=10.1038/nbt.2294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physics===
In [[physics]], "heterogeneous" is understood to mean "having physical properties that vary within the medium".

===Sociology===
In [[sociology]], "heterogeneous" may refer to a society or group that includes individuals of differing ethnicities, cultural backgrounds, sexes, or ages.  Diverse is the more common synonym in the context.&lt;ref name="LawsonGarrod2012"&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ibzZZxWC_vEC Dictionary of Sociology]''.

'''Leonard Digges''' (c.1515 – c.1559) was a well-known English mathematician and [[surveying|surveyor]], credited with the invention of the [[theodolite]], and a great populariser of science through his writings in English on surveying, cartography, and military engineering. His birth date is variously suggested as c.1515&lt;ref name="Johnston 2004"&gt;{{Harvnb|Johnston|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or c.1520 (but certainly by 1530).&lt;ref name=Galileo/&gt;

Much of his work was expanded on, annotated, and published by his son, [[Thomas Digges]].&lt;ref name=Galileo&gt;{{Cite web |last=Van Helden |first=Al |year=1995 |url=http://galileo.rice.edu/Catalog/NewFiles/digges_leo.html |work=The Galileo Project |title=Digges, Leonard |accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His son followed in his footsteps and was a pivotal player in the popularisation of [[Copernicus]]'s book ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]''. Notes written by Thomas Digges in the publication of the book ''Pantometria'' in 1570 contain descriptions of how Leonard Digges made use of a "''proportional Glass''" to view distant objects and people. Some, such as astronomer and historian [[Colin Ronan]], claim this describes a reflecting or refracting [[telescope]] built between 1540 and 1559, but its vague description and claimed performance makes it dubious.&lt;ref name="chocky.demon.co.uk"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Satterthwaite |first=Gilbert |year=2002 |work=The Digges Telescope |url=http://www.chocky.demon.co.uk/oas/diggeshistory.html |title=Did the reflecting telescope have English origins? |accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ronan 1991"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ronan |first=Colin A. |year=1991 |title=Leonard and Thomas Digges |journal=[[Journal of the British Astronomical Association]] |volume=101 |issue=6 |url=http://www.chocky.demon.co.uk/oas/diggeshistory.html |accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=watson&gt;{{Cite book |last=Watson |first=Fred |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7dD2oE4pvukC&amp;pg=PA294&amp;dq=Leonard+Digges+stargazer&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=uuobTriVL6LZ0QGeud3KBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=digges&amp;f=false |title=Stargazer: The Life and Times of the Telescope |location=London |publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin |pages=38–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Leonard Digges, born about 1515, was the only son of James Digges (born c.1473), esquire, of Digges Court and Broome in [[Barham, Kent]], by his second wife, Philippe Engham, the daughter of John Engham, esquire, of Chart, Kent. James Digges had been [[High Sheriff of Kent]] in 1510–11, and had married as his first wife Mildred Fineux, the daughter of [[John Fineux|Sir John Fineux]], [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Chief Justice of the King's Bench]], and Elizabeth Apuldrefield, by whom he had an only son, John Digges, who married Mildred Scott, the daughter of [[John Scott (died 1533)|Sir John Scott]] (d. 7 October 1533) of [[Scot's Hall]] in [[Smeeth]], Kent. John Digges predeceased his father, leaving two sons by his wife, Mildred Scott, William Digges and Francis Digges. James Digges made his last will on 20 February 1535/6 requesting burial in the north chancel of the church of [[Barham, Kent|Barham]], 'where my mother and my wife do lie', and naming as executors his second wife, Philippe; [[John Sackville (died 1557)|John Sackville]], esquire; his nephew, Robert Brent, gentleman; and his son, Leonard, with Sir William Hawte as [[Overseer (law)|overseer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Glencross|1922|p=363}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The will was proved on 24 November 1540, at which time his second wife, Philippe, was still living.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richardson II|2011|p=81}}; {{Harvnb|Johnston|2004}}; {{Harvnb|Glencross|1922|pp=363–4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leonard Digges was the grandson of John Digges, esquire, of Digges Court and Broome, [[High Sheriff of Kent]] in 1495-6, and his wife Joan Clifton, the daughter and co-heiress of [[Gervase Clifton (died 1471)|Sir Gervase Clifton]] of [[Clifton, Nottinghamshire]], London, and [[Brabourne]], Kent, by his first wife, Isabel Herbert, daughter of Vincent Herbert, esquire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richardson I|2011|pp=512–13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Leonard Digges' aunt, Isabel Digges, the daughter of John Digges and Joan Clifton, married Richard Sackville (d. 28 July 1524), esquire, and was the mother of [[John Sackville (died 1557)|John Sackville]].&lt;ref name="Richardson II 2011 81"&gt;{{Harvnb|Richardson II|2011|p=81}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1542 Digges, in company with three other gentlemen, visited the castle of [[Guînes]], 'where they impressed their host through debate and demonstration of their skills in geometry, navigation, measurement, and artillery'.&lt;ref name="Johnston 2004"/&gt;

In January 1554 Digges took part in an unsuccessful rebellion led by the [[Protestant]] [[Thomas Wyatt the younger|Sir Thomas Wyatt]], who opposed the projected marriage between [[Philip II of Spain]] and England's new Catholic Queen, [[Mary I of England|Mary I]]. Digges was convicted of [[high treason]], [[attainder|attainted]], and condemned to death. His life was pardoned on 1 April 1554, but according to Johnston 'his lands and goods, which had been seized after his attainder, continued to be held subject to payment of recognizances to the crown'. In February 1555 Digges was fined 400 marks. After being paid off in instalments, the fine was discharged on 7 May 1558.&lt;ref name="Harvnb |Johnston|2004"&gt;{{Harvnb |Johnston|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The date of Digges' death is unknown; he is thought to have died about 1559:&lt;ref&gt;Some sources, including the first edition of the ''Dictionary of National Biography'', erroneously state that he died about 1571.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;From Thomas's autobiographical comments in a legal dispute of the 1590s it can be inferred that Leonard died about 1559, shortly after he had resumed possession of his confiscated lands.&lt;ref name="Harvnb |Johnston|2004"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Marriage and issue===
Digges married Bridget Wilford, the daughter of Thomas Wilford, esquire, of Hartridge in [[Cranbrook, Kent]], by his first wife, Elizabeth Culpeper, the daughter of Walter Culpeper, esquire, by whom he had three sons and three daughters:&lt;ref name="Richardson II 2011 81"/&gt;

*[[Thomas Digges]], esquire.
*James Digges.
*Daniel Digges.
*Mary Digges, who married a husband surnamed Barber.
*Anne Digges, who married William Digges.
*Sarah Digges, who married firstly a husband surnamed Martin, and secondly John Weston.

==Works==
The first publication of many by Leonard Digges was ''A General Prognostication'' published in 1553, which became a best-seller as it contained a [[perpetual calendar]], collections of weather lore and a wealth of astronomical material, until then largely only obtainable through books published in Latin or Greek. It was revised in 1555 (the earliest surviving edition) and again in 1556 with the title ''A Prognostication everlasting''. Subsequent editions reprint the text from 1556; editions from 1576 and later include additional material by his son.

===Telescope===
There are claims Leonard Digges independently invented the [[reflecting telescope]], and/or the [[refracting telescope]] as part of his need to see accurately over long distances during his surveying works.&lt;ref name="chocky.demon.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ronan 1991"/&gt; In the preface to the 1591 ''Pantometria,'' (a book on measurement, partially based on his father's notes and observations) Leonard's son Thomas lauded his father's accomplishments. Some of the praise of the son for the father appears to be extravagant exaggeration, while other claims appear more credible. On the fifth page of the preface, Thomas Digges provides a remarkable account of his father's accomplishments:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[H]is divine mind aided with this science of Geometrical mensurations, found out the quantities, distances, courses, and strange intricate miraculous motions of these resplendent heavenly Globes of Sun, Moon, Planets and Stares fixed, leaving the rules and precepts thereof to his posterity. [[Archimedes]] also (as some suppose) with a glass framed by revolution of a section Parabolicall, fired the Roman navy in the sea coming to the siege of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]]. But to leave these celestial causes and things done of antiquity long ago, my father by his continual painful [painstaking] practices, assisted with demonstrations Mathematical, was able, and sundry times hath by proportional Glasses duly situate in convenient angles, not only discovered things far off, read letters, numbered pieces of money with the very coin and superscription thereof, cast by some of his friends of purpose upon downs in open fields, but also seven miles off declared what hath been done at that instant in private places. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The writings left by Digges' colleague [[William Bourne (mathematician)|William Bourne]] contain further detail on the experiments with [[lens (optics)|lens]]es and [[mirror]]s conducted by Leonard Digges and his son. It is these details which led some researchers, most notably [[Colin Ronan]], to claim that Leonard Digges invented a functioning telescope sometime between 1540 and 1559. The description seemed to suggest that Digges created a rudimentary instrument incorporating lenses and a [[concave mirror]], in a manner rather different from a modern reflecting telescope. However, the construction of lenses to the required optical precision would have been very difficult in the 16th century, and the construction of an adequate mirror would have been much harder still.&lt;ref name=watson/&gt; It is doubtful that Digges built a successful instrument, and the optical performance required to see the details of coins lying about in fields, or private activities seven miles away was far beyond the technology of the time.&lt;ref name=watson/&gt;

{{Main article|V-2 rocket}}The '''list of V-2 test launches''' identifies World War II launches of the [[Aggregate series#A4 (V-2 rocket)|A4]] rocket (renamed [[V-2]] in 1944).  Test launches were made at [[Peenemünde]] [[Test Stand VII]], [[Blizna]] and [[Tuchola Forest]] using experimental and production rockets fabricated at [[Peenemünde]] and at the [[Mittelwerk]].  [[Post-war]] launches were conducted at [[Rocket experiments in the area of Cuxhaven|Cuxhaven]], [[White Sands Proving Grounds]], [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 3|Cape Canaveral]], [[Kapustin Yar]], and on the [[Operations Sandy and Pushover|USS ''Midway'' during Operation Sandy]].

==List of test launches at Peenemünde and the Greifswalder Oie==
'''Launch Sites''':
* P-VI = Test Stand VI (Prüfstand VI)
* P-VII = [[Test Stand VII]] (Prüfstand VII)
* P-X = Test Stand X (Prüfstand X)
* P-XII = Test Stand XII (Prüfstand XII)
* Oie = [[Greifswalder Oie]], a small island used for vertical launches
* Karlshagen = area of destroyed settlement Karlshagen after air raid on 17 August 1943
* Rail = Launches from a train

| Too steep due to pitch program error, otherwise success.  Altitude 85 – 90&amp;nbsp;km - approximately the [[Kármán line]] altitude (85 ~ 100km), where aerodynamic lift vanishes. It was described at the time as the first rocket to reach the edge of space,&lt;ref&gt;Walter Dornberger, Peenemunde&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walter Riedel, Rocket Development with Liquid Propellant&lt;/ref&gt; though not according to the modern FAI definition of 100km altitude. However, both the physical Kármán line and jurisdictional FAI definitions were made much later.

'''M32p''' is a hypothesized former [[galaxy]] that was incorporated into the [[Andromeda Galaxy]]. It was a sister galaxy to the [[Milky Way]] and Andromeda galaxies, previously the third largest galaxy in the [[Local Group]], and was [[Galaxy merger|merged]] into the larger Andromeda Galaxy an estimated 2 billion years ago.&lt;ref name=Space-2018-07-23&gt; {{cite news |url= https://www.space.com/41234-milky-way-sibling-galaxy-devoured-by-andromeda.html |title= The Milky Way Had a Big Sibling Long Ago — And Andromeda Ate It |author= Mike Wall |publisher= Space.com |date= 23 July 2018 }} &lt;/ref&gt; The merger is thought to have created the thick disc and contributed the majority of the halo stars of Andromeda and caused its burst of star formation at the time of the merger. The former galaxy may be associated with the Andromeda [[satellite galaxy]] [[Messier 32]] (M32), which may be the remains of its dense core. M32's unusual characteristics of dense compactness and burst of star formation 2 billion years ago would be explained by this theory as a remnant of an earlier large galaxy, given its unlikeness to other similarly sized elliptical galaxies.&lt;ref name=ScienceDaily-2018-07-23&gt; {{cite news |url= https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/07/180723142905.htm |title= The Milky Way's long-lost sibling finally found |date= 23 July 2018 |publisher= Science Daily }} &lt;/ref&gt;

It was described in 2018 by scientists at the [[University of Michigan]]. It is thought to have been 2.5&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; [[solar mass|M&lt;sub&gt;☉&lt;/sub&gt;]] in size.&lt;ref name="10.1038/s41550-018-0533-x"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/s41550-018-0533-x|title=The Andromeda galaxy's most important merger about 2 billion years ago as M32's likely progenitor|journal=Nature Astronomy|year=2018|last1=d'Souza|first1=Richard|last2=Bell|first2=Eric F|arxiv=1807.08819}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael Karas''' (born 1952) is a German physical chemistry scientist and Professor, known for his researches on [[matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization]] (MALDI), a technique in [[mass spectrometry]].

Michael Karas studied Chemistry at the [[University of Bonn]], where he became [[Doctor (title)|Doctor]] in the field of [[physical chemistry]] in 1982. From 1983 to 1986, he was part of Prof. [[Franz Hillenkamp]] group in the Institut für Biophysik at [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main]]. In 1987, he followed Hillenkamp at Münster and both formed a group in the Faculty of Medicine at [[University of Münster]].

Since 1984, Karas is implied in the development of the [[Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization|MALDI]] technique. &lt;!-- 1992 schloss er seine Habilitation in der Physikalischen Chemie ab. 1995 folgte er einem Ruf nach Frankfurt und kehrte an die Johann Wolfgang Goethe Universität zurück. Hier erhielt er eine Anstellung als Professor für Instrumentelle Analytische Chemie. 2001 wechselte er zum Institut für Pharmazeutische Chemie. Noch heute ist er mit der Weiterentwicklung der von ihm begründeten Technik beschäftigt. --&gt;

'''Moss agate''' is a [[semi-precious stone|semi-precious]] [[gemstone]] formed from [[silicon dioxide]].  It is a form of [[chalcedony]] which includes [[mineral]]s of a green colour embedded in the stone, forming filaments and other patterns suggestive of [[moss]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gemdat.org/gem-2791.html|title=Moss Agate|publisher=gemdat.org|accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field is a clear or milky-white [[quartz]], and the included minerals are mainly [[oxide]]s of [[manganese]] or [[iron]]. It is not a true form of [[agate]], as it lacks agate's defining feature of concentric banding. Moss agate is of the white variety with green inclusions that resemble moss.  It occurs in many locations. The colors are formed due to trace amounts of metal present as an impurity, such as chrome or iron. The metals can make different colors depending on their valence (oxidation state).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mindat.org/min-2791.html|title=Moss Agate|date=2005|publisher=mindat.org|accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its name, moss agate does not contain [[organic matter]] and is usually formed from [[weathering|weathered]] [[volcanic rock]]s.

Montana moss agate is found in the alluvial gravels of the [[Yellowstone River]] and its tributaries between [[Sidney, Montana|Sidney]] and [[Billings, Montana]]. It was originally formed in the [[Yellowstone National Park]] area of Wyoming as a result of volcanic activity. In Montana moss agate the red color is the result of iron oxide and the black color is the result of manganese oxide.

The '''Multi-Agent Programming Contest''' is an annual international programming competition with stated goal of stimulating research in the area of [[multi-agent system]] development and [[Agent-oriented programming|programming]].

==History==
In 2005 [[Jürgen Dix]] ([[Clausthal University of Technology]]), [[Mehdi Dastani]] ([[University Utrecht]]) and Peter Novák ([[Czech Technical University in Prague]]) have brought the contest into being and running. The competition originally focused on [[Logic programming]] of [[Multi-agent system]]s. The goals, raised in 2005, have proven to be a solid basis for multi-agent system development and are still valid:
#'''Identification of key problems'''
#'''To collect suitable benchmarks'''.
In 2007, a third goal has been added:
#&lt;li value="3"&gt; '''To gather test cases which require and enforce coordinated action'''.

&lt;!--Die Intention der Organisatoren liegt dabei nicht auf der Lösung des Problems an sich, sondern darauf, dass sich ein System aus [[Software-Agent|autonomen Programmen]] so koordiniert, dass sie gemeinsam die Aufgabe bewältigen, und '''wie''' die Teilnehmer des Wettbewerbs die Lösung erarbeiten.
--&gt;
Although it is necessary to find a solution for the contest quest to win, the organizers pursue the intention that the solution is a system of cooperating [[Software agent|autonomous programs]] that achieve the objectives together. They are also interested in '''how''' the contest participants develop the solution.

==Scenarios==

===Food collectors===
&lt;!--In einer zweidimensionalen Kästchenwelt (Karte) müssen mehrere Agenten Nahrung suchen und zu einem Depot bringen. Die Agenten sehen dabei immer nur einen Ausschnitt der Karte und bewegen sich von Kästchen zu Kästchen. Initial gibt es keine Nahrung auf der Karte. Diese erscheint erst nach und nach, sodass die Agenten die Karte ständig absuchen müssen. Dieses Szenario kam 2005 zu Einsatz.--&gt;
Agents have to look for food and bring it to a depot on a two-dimensional grid world. Each cell can contain an agent, or food. The agents can only see a small part of the map. Initially there is no food available, it appears randomly during the game, so that agents need to search the map constantly in order to win. This scenario was used in 2005.

===Gold miners===
&lt;!--In einer Kästchenwelt (Karte) gibt es Gold, welches von den Agenten des eigenen Teams gefunden und zum Depot transportiert werden muss. Die Schwierigkeit bei diesem Szenario sind Bäume, die im Weg stehen und ein mehr oder weniger kompliziertes Labyrinth bilden. Außerdem sucht auf dieser Karte ein zweites Team ebenfalls nach Gold. Dieses Szenario kam in den Wettkämpfen von 2006 und 2007 zum Einsatz. 2007 wird das Szenario erweitert für höhere Komplexität: mehr Agenten auf der Karte, mehr Gold tragen, Konkurrenten wegschupsen.--&gt;
On a grid based map, teams of agents look for gold and transport it to the depot. As opposed to the food scenario, cells can also contain trees which block the agents and can form more or less complex labyrinths. Also, there are now two opposing teams competing for the gold. This scenario was used in the contests of 2006 and 2007. In 2007, the scenario was extended to allow the agents to carry more than one piece of gold, and to push opposing agents aside.

===Cowboys===
&lt;!--In einer Kästchenwelt gibt es Bäume, Viehgatter und Kühe, die von zwei Gruppen von Agenten (Cowboys) in das jeweils eigene Gatter getrieben werden sollen.  Ziel ist es, so viel Kühe wie möglich in das eigene Gatter zu treiben. Dabei zeigen die Kühe in ihrem Verhalten [[Schwarmintelligenz]]. Außerdem haben sie Angst vor den Cowboys und reißen ständig aus. Dieses Szenario kam in den Wettbewerben 2008, 2009 und 2010 zu Einsatz. 2009 wird das Szenario um Zäune ergänzt, die sich durch die Cowboy-Agenten öffnen lassen.--&gt;
A grid based map contains trees, corrals, cows and agents. Two opposing teams try to drive as many cows as possible in ones corral. Cows behave using [[Swarm intelligence]]. They are also afraid of cowboys and try and run away. This scenario was used in 2008, 2009 and 2010. For the last two years, gates were introduced to make the scenario more challenging.

===Agents on Mars===
&lt;!--2011 beginnt mit dem Szenario ''Agenten auf dem Mars''. Das Ziel ist, ein Team von kooperierenden Agenten mit unterschiedlichen Rollen zu programmieren, um den Planeten Mars zu erobern. Die Herausforderung dieses Szenarios ist die höhere Komplexität, die daraus resultiert, dass es fünf verschiedene Rollen mit unterschiedlichen Eigenschaften und Fähigkeiten sinnvoll zu besetzen gilt, damit das Ziel erreicht wird.--&gt;
The 2011 contest introduces a scenario called agents on mars. Goal is to conquer as much space on mars as possible, using a team of cooperating agents. The challenge here is the higher complexity resulting from the introduction of five roles with different properties and abilities, which have to be used to scout, conquer, and keep the conquered land.
The team HactarV2 from the TU-Delft won the 2011 competition while using the [[GOAL agent programming language|GOAL]] programming language.

'''''NeuroNames''''' is an integrated nomenclature for structures in the [[brain]] and [[spinal cord]] of the four species most studied by neuroscientists: [[human]], [[macaque]], [[rat]] and [[mouse]]. It offers a standard, [[controlled vocabulary]] of common names for structures, which is suitable for unambiguous [[neuroanatomical]] indexing of information in digital databases. Terms in the standard vocabulary have been selected for ease of pronunciation, mnemonic value, and frequency of use in recent neuroscientific publications. Structures and their relations to each other are defined in terms of the standard vocabulary. Currently NeuroNames contains standard names, synonyms and definitions of some 2,500 neuroanatomical entities.
 
The nomenclature is maintained by the [[University of Washington]] and is the core component of a tool called "BrainInfo". BrainInfo helps one identify structures in the brain. One can either search by a structure name or locate the structure in a [[brain atlas]] and get information such as its location in the classical brain hierarchy, images of the structure, what cells it has, its connections and genes expressed there. Information can be accessed by any of some 16,000 synonyms in eight languages.

NeuroNames is a source vocabulary of the Metathesaurus of the [[Unified Medical Language System]]. It is described in depth in the following three [[scientific articles]]:

'''''Nuclear Power and the Environment''''', sometimes simply called the '''Flowers Report''', was released in September 1976 and is the sixth report of the UK [[Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution]], chaired by Sir [[Brian Flowers]].&lt;ref name="Flowers"/&gt; The report was dedicated to "the Queen's most excellent Majesty."&lt;ref name="Flowers"/&gt; "He was appointed "to advise on matters, both national and international, concerning the pollution of the environment; on the adequacy of research in this field; and the future possibilities of danger to the environment."&lt;ref name="Flowers"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Flowers|first1=Sir Brian|title=Nuclear Power and the Environment|date=September 1976|publisher=Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution|location=London|isbn=0 10 166180 0|pages=iii|edition=6th|url=http://www.davidsmythe.org/nuclear/flowers%20commission%201976.pdf|accessdate=October 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the recommendations of the report was that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"There should be no commitment to a large programme of nuclear fission power until it has been demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt that a method exists to ensure the safe containment of longlived, highly [[radioactive waste]] for the indefinite future."&lt;ref name="Flowers"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The "Flowers Report" was prompted by a proposal in 1975 to set up an international nuclear fuel reprocessing plant in Windscale. Windscale is a large nuclear facility on the coast of Cumbria in Northwest England that was built after World War II to produce plutonium for England's nuclear weapons program. The facility suffered a leak in 1973, which put it out of commission until the plans for the international nuclear fuel reprocessing plant were proposed. This proposal was met with strong resistance after it became known to the public and as a result, the plans to build the nuclear reprocessing plant were never acted upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Patterson|first1=Walter|title=The Windscale Report: A Nuclear Apologia|journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|date=June 1978|issue=June 1978|url=http://www.waltpatterson.org/windscalerpt.pdf|accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wynne|first1=Brian|title=Rationality and Reason: Participation and Exclusion in Nuclear Decision Making|date=2011|publisher=Taylor and Francis|location=New York|isbn=978-1-849-71162-3|pages=28–30|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wFQVAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA206&amp;lpg=PA206&amp;dq=flowers+report+1976&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=P6x-YpnbhT&amp;sig=Vqxy_ziaEPBxHZgYy8A3HN4T-1c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nvxSVPviMIOOiwKX74GICg&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwCw#v=onepage&amp;q=flowers%20report%201976&amp;f=false|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Radioactive waste management and disposal strategies have been enacted since the publishing of "The Flowers Report". This put the responsibility of disposing radioactive waste into the hands of those who are producing it. It was not until 1982 that the Department of the Environment, after their previous method proved to be not as effective as they had hoped, decided to enact stronger guidelines and rules regarding radioactive waste. The responsibility of disposal was then passed over to the government. This led to the  Department of the Environment gaining a few new responsibilities: securing the disposal process at an establishment, making sure the method of disposal is safe and well researched, and lastly, keeping the waste secured and away from the public after it has been disposed of.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berkhout|first1=Frans|title=Radioactive Waste: Politics and Technology|date=2003|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis e-Library|isbn=0-203-41175-7|pages=154|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nEe41vgvzP4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=snippet&amp;q=flowers&amp;f=false|accessdate=October 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the United States, as of 2008, uranium ore reserves are primarily kept in Wyoming and New Mexico, totaling an estimated one billion, 227 million pounds. This uranium ore will be turned into fuel that will be used in the operation of nuclear power plants, creating low-levels of radioactive waste. "Spent" uranium fuel becomes radioactive waste as a result of the fission process. This "spent" fuel must be removed and replaced from nuclear power plants every 18 to 24 months; it is then shipped to specifically designed and licensed disposal sites. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the U.S. Department of Transportation carefully control and regulate the management, packing, transport, and disposal of waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Environmental Protection Agency|first1=(EPA)|title=Nuclear Energy | date=October 2013 | url=http://www.epa.gov/cleanenergy/energy-and-you/affect/nuclear.html|website=www.epa.gov|accessdate=October 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Flower's Report==

The Flower's report is composed of eleven chapters in a compilation of over 200 pages. The chapters cover a wide range of subjects and topics related to radioactive activity.

==Chapter One: Introduction==

The Flower's Report introduction chapter consists of six pages. The report introduces the topics of nuclear technology, future projections on commercial reactors, concerns for left over radioactive waste, other uses of nuclear technology (that will not be the focus of the report), and concerns with development of nuclear reactors.
This chapter also gives an arrangement of the entire report's information that acts as an outline for the information presented, including later chapters' topics and main points.&lt;ref name="Flowers"/&gt;

==Chapter Two: Radioactivity and Radiobiology==

The focus of the first half of the chapter is designed to provide basic information about atoms and radiation to aid in later chapters.&lt;ref name="Flowers"/&gt; The first half covers the basics on atoms such as: an atom consists of [[Neutrons]], [[Protons]], and [[Electrons]]; the atomic number of an atom determines the amount of protons in one atom; and that protons are roughly 2000 times heavier than electrons (see [[atom]]). The concept of radiation is introduced through [[ionization]] which is the process of adding one or more electrons to, or removing one or more electrons from, atoms or molecules, thereby creating ions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glossary-Ionization|url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/basic-ref/glossary/ionization.html|website=The United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission|publisher=NCR|accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; From there certain particles can cause ionization. The ionizing particles are [[alpha particle]]s (a type of ionizing radiation ejected by the nuclei of some unstable atoms that are large subatomic fragments consisting of two protons and two neutrons),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Radiation: Alpha Particles|url=http://www.epa.gov/radiation/understand/alpha.html|website=US Environmental Protection Agency|publisher=EPA|accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[beta particle]]s (subatomic particles ejected from the nucleus of some radioactive atoms that are equivalent to electrons),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Radiation: Beta Particles|url=http://www.epa.gov/radiation/understand/beta.html|website=US Environmental Protection Agency|publisher=UEA|accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[gamma particle]]s (electromagnetic energy photon) and energetic [[neutron radiation]] (energy released from an atom in the form of neutral particles called neutrons).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barrens|first1=Richard E.|title=Beta Particles and Ionization|url=http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/phy00/phy00262.htm|website=Newton|publisher=DOE Office of Science|accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second half focuses on knowledge of radiation introduced into the environment and humans. Flower's and his team concluded in 1976 that low levels over a long exposure time can prevent a cell from dividing or further damaging genetic information.
Other topics covered are the effects of [[plutonium]] in the body. For instance, animals being susceptible to radiation causes birth defects among the litter. Chapter two concludes with a concern of radiation affecting an entire species of animals as opposed to a group.&lt;ref name="Flowers"/&gt;

==Chapter Three: Nuclear Power==

Chapter Three focuses on nuclear power. This chapter main concentration is on nuclear reactors and the basic physical principals of which reactor operation is based. An understanding of the different types of reactors that are in use or plan to be used is given. It also accounts for the nuclear fuel cycle and the operations that are involved in the fabrication and treatment of nuclear fuel. It begins with the extraction of uranium from the mine to the fuel fabrication plant and then to reactors. Furthermore, it incorporates the removal of spent fuel and its treatment to extract material suitable for incorporation of fresh fuel along with the treatment and disposal of wastes.
&lt;ref name="Flowers"/&gt;

==Chapter Four: Major Issues Raised by Nuclear Power==

Chapter Four emphasizes on major issues raised by nuclear power. The reason why chapter two and chapter three are so detailed in the effects of radioactivity and the principles of nuclear power along with the nuclear fuel cycle is so that there could be a better understanding on the problems that could cause environmental effects. Concerns about nuclear development, which is considered in detail in other chapters, centers on a few major issues. This chapter focuses on issues as a whole to ensure that they can be seen in the perspective that allows people to understand the underlying social and ethical questions that they raise. It begins with the world energy demand, the problem scale of nuclear development, and nuclear hazards that stem from other technological developments. The advantages must be weighed against the fears and risks attached to nuclear power, which can lead to many people disregarding nuclear power as an acceptable means of energy, also referred to as "the Faustian bargain." Certainly these fears must be taken seriously and can not be disregarded. This chapter concludes with the concerns of the future and the fact that the world is on the threshold of a huge commitment to fission power, which if fully entered into, it may be effectively impossible to reverse for a century or more.
&lt;ref name="Flowers"/&gt;

==Chapter Five: International and National Control Arrangements==

Chapter Five focuses on the internal and national control arrangements. It begins by accepting that the hazards of ionizing radiation are well appreciated by anyone who works in the field and that there is, and has been, an elaborate system at the national and international level to minimize these risks. Although there are many questions to be answered, much has been learned and there has been a stricter management with respect to ionizing radiation and protecting the health of both radiation workers and the general public. It suggests that greater resources should be allocated to a critical group that is most exposed to a particular pollutant in order to determine a safe discharge criteria. This chapter also focuses on the organizational arrangements of responsibility, which may still be unclear. If a rapid expansion in the near future occurs, new problems are likely to rise; thus, creating new changes in the allocation of responsibilities. It focuses on the present arrangements, their efficacy, and recommendations that arise in order to sustain efficacy and effectiveness. It does not discuss discharges of radioactivity to the environment, but rather presents arrangements that are made in order to ensure protection to the general public and the environment.
&lt;ref name="Flowers"/&gt;

==Chapter Six: Reactor Safety and Siting==

Chapter Six stresses on reactor safety and compares the risks of reactor accidents with those arising from other activities or events. It clearly states that absolute safety cannot be ensured and that the advancing scale and complexity of technology tends to increase the possible consequences of serious accidents as well as the problems by which these accidents may be caused. Accordingly, all that can be expected is that the techniques and disciplines used to ensure safety are enough to reduce accidents to acceptable rates. The biggest concern in this chapter is the environmental effects of possible reactor accidents. The focus is on looking into the principles that are applied in seeking reactor safety.
&lt;ref name="Flowers"/&gt;

==Chapter Seven: Security and the Safeguarding of Plutonium==

Chapter Seven focuses on security and the safeguarding of plutonium. Much of the concern that is presented with nuclear power is not strictly on the effects of normal operations, but to those that might be created by illicit activities directed towards nuclear installations or materials. The issues that arise within this chapter are the safeguarding of society, security arrangements, and the viewpoint of the ordinary citizen about the restrictions on their freedom that might result from security measures. One of the risks discussed is the sabotage of nuclear installation which could release harmful substances into the environment along with radioactivity. Another risk is the diversion of plutonium which could be made into a bomb or dispersed deliberately and will only increase along with the reliance of plutonium in fast conductors. Lastly, in regards to whether or not the measures necessary to protect society against these risks are going to interfere with civil liberties.
&lt;ref name="Flowers"/&gt;

==Chapter Eight: Radioactive Waste Management==

Chapter Eight focuses on radioactive waste management which is generated at various stages of the nuclear fuel cycle. This chapter focuses more strictly on radioactive waste, specifically on the waste that presents particularly difficult problems regarding its disposal and management. It also covers the harms that are present in the storage of nuclear waste along with the steps that are being taken to ensure that no harm is caused to the environment. Furthermore, this chapter considers the possibilities that exist for a safe disposal of these wastes and the organization needed to pursue the search and judge its results.
&lt;ref name="Flowers"/&gt;

==Chapter Nine: Energy Strategy and the Environment==

Chapter Nine focuses on energy storage and the environment along with the implications of a large nuclear power program. This chapters seeks and attempts to provide some understanding of those issues that bear on the question of whether great future dependence on nuclear fission power must be regarded as inevitable. It also helps understand if these implications should be accepted and what other alternate strategies might be available along with their economic, social, and environmental consequences. Some examples mentioned as acceptable means of energy are wave power and CHP systems.
&lt;ref name="Flowers"/&gt;

==Chapter Ten: Nuclear Power and Public Policy==

Chapter Ten reflects on nuclear power and public safety. This chapter draws the line on which policy should be adopted towards the development of nuclear power. Due to the popular belief that the spread of technology is responsible for the environment progressively deteriorating, nuclear power is highly opposed in some countries. This chapter mainly focuses on the United States and how the debate between the nuclear industry and the environmental movement has become increasingly controversial. One side of the spectrum sees technology as "blind to the dangers of the world", whereas the other side believes they "are making an essential contribution to the well-being of humanity." Also, this issue brings about the concerns of large scale nuclear power leading to a nuclear war on account of the connection of civil and military uses of nuclear power with the expansion of nuclear development.&lt;ref name="Flowers"/&gt;

==Chapter Eleven==

Chapter Eleven is a summary of principal conclusions and recommendations.&lt;ref name="Flowers"/&gt;

[[File:SAH stopmo 1.webm|thumb|How gameplay helps [[ScienceAtHome]] build a quantum computer]]

'''Quantum Moves''' is an [[online]] [[citizen science]] [[simulation video game]] where players move quantum atoms. The game is part of the [[ScienceAtHome]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scienceathome.org |title=Home |publisher=ScienceAtHome |date= |accessdate=2014-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; umbrella project, developed by AU Ideas Center for Community Driven Research (CODER).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scienceathome.org/about-us/team |title=People |publisher=ScienceatHome |date= |accessdate=2014-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; CODER aims to merge theoretical and experimental quantum research with online community efforts to explore the potential for online [[citizen science]] in this otherwise highly specialized field.

The objective of the game is to complete challenges that are simulations of logical operations in a quantum computer. The team behind the game are building a scalable quantum computer with a processor consisting of 300 atoms. Logical operations are performed by moving the atoms with [[optical tweezers]]. Moving atoms in a controlled way is a difficult task because the atom becomes excited and the atomic [[wave function]] delocalises. Approaching the presumed quantum speed limit is a huge challenge for quantum algorithms and the task that Quantum Moves players are asked to tackle.

In Quantum Moves, the atomic wave function is represented as a sloshy liquid in an energy potential well created by the optical tweezers. Players control the depth and the horizontal location of the well, simulating the path on the optical tweezers. The wave function reacts to changes in the potential function as dictated by the [[Schrödinger equation]] leading to sloshing seen by the players. Players are asked to move the well without sloshing the atomic wave function too much. A path created by a player maps one-to-one to a solution of the Schrödinger equation. Top results of the game play are then used to provide guidance into the algorithm’s search space, resulting in solutions superior to those found by the algorithm alone.

In 2012, the first version of the game was developed in the programming language [[MATLAB]] and tested in several high schools across Denmark. The feedback was positive, but there were many technical issues that made the interaction in the game cumbersome. In the summer of 2012, the game was translated into [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and the first version of Quantum Moves was released. Since then, Quantum Moves has been built in Unity multi-platform development engine and released in the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] and [[Google Play]] for use in touch screen devices.

{{As of|2017|02}}, Quantum Moves had been played over 8 million times by more than 200,000 players worldwide. In April 2016, the journal [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] published an article “Exploring the quantum speed limit with computer games”,&lt;ref&gt;Sørensen, J. J., Pedersen, M. K., Munch, M., Haikka, P., Jensen, J. H., Planke, T., . . . Sherson, J. F. (2016). Exploring the quantum speed limit with computer games. Nature, 532(7598), 210-213. doi:10.1038/nature17620&lt;/ref&gt; detailing the analysis of one of the levels in Quantum Moves called BringHomeWater, and showing that players excel at solving the corresponding atomic transport problem.

{{Use British English|date=May 2011}}
[[File:HMS Beagle by Conrad Martens.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''Beagle'' anchoring at [[Tierra del Fuego]] in 1832; painting by the ship's draughtsman [[Conrad Martens]].]]

The '''second voyage of HMS ''Beagle''''', from 27 December 1831 to 2 October 1836, was the second survey expedition of [[HMS Beagle|HMS ''Beagle'']], under captain [[Robert FitzRoy]] who had taken over command of the ship on its first voyage after the previous captain committed suicide. FitzRoy had already thought of the advantages of having an expert in [[geology]] on board, and sought a gentleman [[natural history|naturalist]] to accompany them as a [[wikt:supernumerary|supernumerary]]. The young graduate [[Charles Darwin]] had hoped to see the tropics before becoming a [[parson]], and accepted the opportunity. He was greatly influenced by reading [[Charles Lyell]]'s ''[[Principles of Geology]]'' during the voyage. By the end of the expedition, Darwin had already made his name as a geologist and [[fossil]] collector, and the publication of his journal which became known as ''[[The Voyage of the Beagle]]'' gave him wide renown as a writer.

''Beagle'' sailed across the [[Atlantic Ocean]], and then carried out detailed [[hydrographic survey]]s around the coasts of the southern part of [[South America]], returning via [[Tahiti]] and [[Australia]] after having circumnavigated the Earth. While the expedition was originally planned to last two years, it lasted almost five.

Darwin spent most of this time exploring on land: three years and three months on land, 18 months at sea.&lt;ref name=intro&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|Neve|1989|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in the voyage he decided that he could write a book about geology, and he showed a gift for theorising. At [[Punta Alta]] he made a major find of gigantic fossils of extinct mammals, then known from only a very few specimens. He ably collected and made detailed observations of plants and animals, with results that shook his belief that species were fixed and provided the basis for ideas which came to him when back in England, and led to his theory of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]].

==Aims of the expedition==
[[File:British Museum Marine Chronometer.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ship's chronometer from HMS Beagle|Ship's chronometer from HMS ''Beagle'']] ]]
The main purpose of the expedition was to conduct a [[hydrographic survey]] of the coasts of the southern part of [[South America]]. This was a continuation and correction of the work of previous surveys, in order to produce accurate [[nautical chart]]s showing navigational and sea depth information for the navy and for commerce.

An [[Admiralty]] memorandum set out the detailed instructions. The first requirement was to resolve disagreements in the earlier surveys about the [[longitude]] of [[Rio de Janeiro]], which was essential as the base point for [[Meridian arc|meridian distances]]. The accurate [[marine chronometer]]s needed to [[Longitude by chronometer|determine longitude]] had only become affordable since 1800; ''Beagle'' carried [[List of chronometers on HMS Beagle|22 chronometers]] to allow corrections. The ship was to stop at specified points for four-day rating of the chronometers and to check them by [[Celestial navigation|astronomical observations]]: it was essential to take observations at [[Praia|Porto Praya]] and [[Fernando de Noronha]] to calibrate against the previous surveys of [[William Fitzwilliam Owen|Owen]] and [[Henry Foster (scientist)|Foster]]. It was important to survey the extent of the [[Abrolhos Archipelago]] reefs, shown incorrectly in [[Albin Roussin|Roussin's]] survey, then proceed to Rio de Janeiro to decide the exact longitude of [[Villegagnon Island]].&lt;ref name="admiralty 1"&gt;{{harvnb|FitzRoy|1839|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F10.2&amp;pageseq=47 24–26]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The real work of the survey was then to commence south of the [[Río de la Plata]], with return trips to [[Montevideo]] for supplies; details were given of priorities, including surveying [[Tierra del Fuego]] and approaches to harbours on the [[Falkland Islands]]. The west coast was then to be surveyed as far north as time and resources permitted. The commander would then determine his own route west: season permitting, he could survey the [[Galápagos Islands]]. Then ''Beagle'' was to proceed to [[1769 Transit of Venus observed from Tahiti|Point Venus,Tahiti]] and on to [[Port Jackson]], [[Australia]] which were known points to verify the chronometers.&lt;ref name="admiralty 2"&gt;{{harvnb|FitzRoy|1839|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F10.2&amp;pageseq=49 26–33]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No time was to be wasted on elaborate drawings; charts and plans should have notes and simple views of the land as seen from the sea showing measured heights of hills. Continued records of tides and [[meteorology|meteorological]] conditions were also required. An additional suggestion was for a geological survey of a circular coral [[atoll]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]] including its profile and of tidal flows, to investigate the [[The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs|formation of such coral reefs]].&lt;ref name="admiralty 3"&gt;{{harvnb|FitzRoy|1839|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F10.2&amp;pageseq=56 33–40]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context and preparations==
The previous survey expedition to [[South America]] involved [[HMS Aid (1809)|HMS ''Adventure'']] and HMS ''Beagle'' under the overall command of the Australian Commander [[Phillip Parker King]]. During the survey ''Beagle'''s captain, [[Pringle Stokes]], committed suicide and command of the ship was given to the young aristocrat [[Robert FitzRoy]], a nephew of [[George FitzRoy, 4th Duke of Grafton]]. When a ship's boat was taken by native [[Fuegians]], FitzRoy took some of them hostage. After their return to [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport dockyard]] on 14 October 1830 Captain King retired.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|Neve|1989|pp=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 26-year-old FitzRoy had hopes of commanding a second expedition to continue the South American survey, but when he heard that the [[Lords of the Admiralty]] no longer supported this, he grew concerned about how to return the Fuegians who had been taught English with the idea that they could become missionaries. He made an agreement with the owner of a small merchant-vessel to take himself and five others back to South America, but a kind uncle heard of this and contacted the [[Admiralty]]. Soon afterwards FitzRoy heard that he was to be appointed commander of [[HMS Chanticleer (1808)|HMS ''Chanticleer'']] to go to [[Tierra del Fuego]], but due to her poor condition ''Beagle'' was substituted. On 27 June 1831 FitzRoy was commissioned as commander of the voyage, and Lieutenants [[John Clements Wickham]] and [[Bartholomew Sulivan|Bartholomew James Sulivan]] were appointed.&lt;ref name=fitz13&gt;{{harvnb|FitzRoy|1839|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F10.2&amp;pageseq=36 13–16]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Captain [[Francis Beaufort]], the Hydrographer of the Admiralty, was invited to decide on the use that could be made of the voyage to continue the survey, and he discussed with FitzRoy plans for a voyage of several years, including a continuation of the trip around the world to establish median distances. ''Beagle'' was [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 4 July 1831 under the command of Captain Robert FitzRoy, who promptly spared no expense in having ''Beagle'' extensively refitted.  ''Beagle'' was immediately taken into dock for extensive rebuilding and refitting. As she required a new deck, FitzRoy had the upper deck raised considerably, by {{convert|8|in|mm}} aft and {{convert|12|in|mm}} forward.&lt;ref name=fitz17/&gt; The [[Cherokee class brig-sloop|''Cherokee''-class brig-sloops]] had the reputation of being "coffin brigs", which handled badly and were prone to sinking.&lt;ref name=PortCities&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.portcities.org.uk/london/server/show/ConFactFile.64/HMS-Beagle.html|title=HMS ''Beagle'' – Port of science and discovery – Port Cities |work= |quote= |accessdate=2009-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; By helping the decks to drain more quickly with less water collecting in the [[Gunwale|gunnel]]s, the raised deck gave ''Beagle'' better handling and made her less liable to become top-heavy and capsize. Additional sheathing to the hull added about seven tons to her [[Builder's Old Measurement|burthen]] and perhaps fifteen to her displacement.&lt;ref name =fitz17/&gt;

The ship was one of the first to test the [[lightning rod|lightning conductor]] invented by [[William Snow Harris]]. FitzRoy obtained five examples of the ''[[Sympiesometer]]'', a kind of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]]-free [[barometer]] patented by [[Alexander Adie]] and favoured by FitzRoy as giving the accurate readings required by the Admiralty.&lt;ref name=fitz17&gt;{{harvnb|FitzRoy|1839|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F10.2&amp;pageseq=40 17–22]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to its officers and crew, ''Beagle'' carried several [[wikt:supernumerary|supernumeraries]], passengers without an official position. FitzRoy employed a mathematical instrument maker to maintain his [[List of chronometers on HMS Beagle|22 marine chronometers kept in his cabin]], as well as engaging the artist/draughtsman [[Augustus Earle]] to go in a private capacity.&lt;ref name=fitz17 /&gt; The three Fuegians taken on the previous voyage were going to be returned to [[Tierra del Fuego]] on ''Beagle'' together with the missionary Richard Matthews.&lt;ref name=fitz13/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|Neve|1989|pp=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Naturalist and geologist===
For [[Francis Beaufort|Beaufort]] and the leading [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] "gentlemen of science" the opportunity for a [[natural history|naturalist]] to join the expedition fitted with their drive to revitalise British government policy on science. This elite disdained research done for money and felt that [[natural philosophy]] was for [[gentleman|gentlemen]], not [[tradesman|tradesmen]]. The officer class of the Army and Navy provided a way to ascend this hierarchy; it was commonly the [[Ship's doctor|Ship's Surgeon]] who collected specimens on voyages, and [[Robert McCormick (explorer)|Robert McCormick]] had secured the official position of surgeon on ''Beagle'' after taking part in earlier expeditions and studying natural history. A sizeable collection had considerable social value, attracting wide public interest, and McCormick aspired to fame as an exploring naturalist.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=150–151, 204–209}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collections made by the Ship's Surgeon and other officers were government property, though the Admiralty was not consistent on this,&lt;ref name="letter: 131"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-131 |title= Letter 131 – Darwin, C. R. to FitzRoy, Robert (19 Sept 1831) |publisher=Darwin Correspondence Project }}&lt;/ref&gt; and went to important London establishments, usually the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|1995|p=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Admiralty instructions for the first voyage had required officers "to use their best diligence in increasing the Collections in each ship: the whole of which must be understood to belong to the Public", but on the second voyage this requirement was omitted, and the officers were free to keep all the specimens for themselves.&lt;ref name="letter: 131" /&gt;

FitzRoy's narrative recalls that, when investigating islands on the first voyage, he had regretted that no-one on board had expertise on [[mineralogy]] or [[geology]] to make use of the opportunity of "ascertaining the nature of the rocks and earths" of the areas surveyed, and resolved that if on a similar expedition, he would "endeavour to carry out a person qualified to examine the land; while the officers, and myself, would attend to [[hydrography]]."&lt;ref name=king&gt;{{harvnb|King|1839|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F10.1&amp;pageseq=477 385]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This clearly indicated a need for a naturalist qualified to examine geology, who would spend considerable periods onshore away from the ship. McCormick lacked expertise in geology, and had to attend to his duties on the ship.{{sfn | van Wyhe | 2013 | p=3}}

FitzRoy knew that commanding a ship could involve stress and loneliness; he was fully aware of the suicide of [[Pringle Stokes|Captain Stokes]], and his own uncle [[Viscount Castlereagh]] had committed suicide under stress of overwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time he would be fully in charge with no commanding officer or second captain to consult, and it has been suggested that he felt the need for a gentleman companion who shared his scientific interests and could dine with him as an equal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=148–149}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no direct evidence to support this. Henslow described the position "more as a companion than a mere collector", but this was an assurance that FitzRoy would treat his guest as a gentleman naturalist. Several other ships at this period carried unpaid civilians as naturalists.{{sfn |van Wyhe | 2013 | pp=5–7}}

Early in August, FitzRoy discussed this position with Beaufort, who had a scientific network of friends at the [[University of Cambridge]].&lt;ref name=intro4&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|Neve|1989|pp=4–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Beaufort's request, mathematics lecturer [[George Peacock]] wrote from London to Professor [[John Stevens Henslow]] about this "rare opportunity for a naturalist", saying that an "offer has been made to me to recommend a proper person to go out as a naturalist with this expedition", and suggesting the Reverend [[Leonard Jenyns]].&lt;ref name="letter: 104"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-104 |title=Darwin Correspondence Project » letter: 104 – Peacock, George to Henslow, J. S., (6 or 13 August 1831) |accessdate=2014-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Jenyns nearly accepted, and even packed his clothes, he had concerns about his obligations as vicar of [[Swaffham Bulbeck]] and his health, so declined. Henslow briefly thought of going, but his wife "looked so miserable" that he quickly dropped the idea.&lt;ref name="letter: 115"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-115 |title=Darwin Correspondence Project » letter: 115 – Darwin, C. R. to Darwin, S.

====Offer of place to Darwin====
Darwin fitted well the expectations of a gentleman natural philosopher, and was well trained as a naturalist.{{sfn |van Wyhe | 2013 | p=6}} When he had studied geology in his second year at Edinburgh he had found it dull, but from Easter to August 1831 he learned a great deal with [[Adam Sedgwick]] and developed a strong interest during their geological field trip.&lt;ref name=fieldnotesGalapagos /&gt; 
On 24 August [[John Stevens Henslow|Henslow]] wrote to Darwin:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
...that I consider you to be the best qualified person I know of who is likely to undertake such a situation— I state this not on the supposition of yr. being a finished Naturalist, but as amply qualified for collecting, observing, &amp; noting any thing worthy to be noted in Natural History. Peacock has the appointment at his disposal &amp; if he can not find a man willing to take the office, the opportunity will probably be lost— Capt. F. wants a man (I understand) more as a companion than a mere collector &amp; would not take any one however good a Naturalist who was not recommended to him likewise as a ''gentleman''. ... there never was a finer chance for a man of zeal &amp; spirit... Don't put on any modest doubts or fears about your disqualifications for I assure you I think you are the very man they are in search of.&lt;ref name="Letter 105"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-105.html |title=Darwin Correspondence Project – Letter 105 — Henslow, J. S. to Darwin, C. R., 24&amp;nbsp;Aug 1831 |accessdate=2008-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The letter went first to [[George Peacock]], who quickly forwarded it to Darwin with further details, confirming that the "ship sails about the end of September". Peacock had discussed the offer with [[Francis Beaufort|Beaufort]], "he entirely approves of it &amp; you may consider the situation as at your absolute disposal".&lt;ref name="letter 106"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-106.html |title=Darwin Correspondence Project – Letter 106 — Peacock, George to Darwin, C.

With Wedgwood's help, Darwin's father was persuaded to relent and fund his son's expedition, and on Thursday 1 September Darwin wrote accepting Peacock's offer.&lt;ref name="letter: 112"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-112 |title=Darwin Correspondence Project » letter: 112 Darwin, C.

America".&lt;ref name="letter: 113"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-113 |title=Darwin Correspondence Project » letter: 113 – Beaufort, Francis to FitzRoy, Robert, 1 Sept (1831) |accessdate=2014-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Friday Darwin left for Cambridge, where he spent Saturday with Henslow getting advice on preparations, and references to experts.&lt;ref name="letter: 115" /&gt;

Alexander Charles Wood (an undergraduate whose tutor was Peacock) wrote from Cambridge to his cousin FitzRoy to recommend Darwin.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=158–159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around midday on Sunday 4 September Wood received FitzRoy's response, "straightforward and gentlemanlike" but strongly against Darwin joining the expedition; both Darwin and Henslow then "gave up the scheme". Darwin went to London anyway, and next morning met FitzRoy who explained that he had promised the place to his friend Mr. Chester, (possibly the novelist Harry Chester) but Chester had turned it down in a letter received not five minutes before Darwin arrived. FitzRoy emphasised the difficulties including cramped conditions and plain food.&lt;ref name="letter: 117"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-117 |title=Darwin Correspondence Project » letter: 117 Darwin, C.

They talked and dined together, and soon found each other agreeable.&lt;ref name="letter: 118" /&gt; The [[Tory]] FitzRoy had been cautious at the prospect of companionship with this unknown young gentleman of [[British Whig Party|Whig]] background, and later admitted that his letter to Wood was "to throw cold water on the scheme" in "a sudden horror of the chances of having somebody he should not like on board". He half-seriously told Darwin later that, as "an ardent disciple of [[Johann Kaspar Lavater|Lavater]]", he had nearly rejected Darwin on the [[Phrenology|phrenological]] basis that the shape (or [[physiognomy]]) of Darwin's nose indicated a lack of determination.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=160–161}}&lt;br&gt;Darwin, C.

====Darwin's preparations====
While he continued to get acquainted with Fitzroy, going shopping together, Darwin rushed around to arrange his supplies and equipment, getting advice from experts on specimen preservation such as [[William Yarrell]] at the [[Zoological Society of London]], [[Robert Brown (botanist, born 1773)|Robert Brown]] at the [[British Museum]], Captain [[Phillip Parker King]] who led the first expedition, and invertebrate anatomist [[Robert Edmond Grant]] who had tutored Darwin at Edinburgh. Yarrell gave invaluable advice, and bargained with shopkeepers so Darwin paid £50 for two pistols and a rifle, while FitzRoy had spent £400 on firearms.&lt;ref name="letter: 122" /&gt;&lt;ref name="letter: 123"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-123 |title=Darwin Correspondence Project » letter: 123 –  Darwin, C.

The geologist [[Charles Lyell]] asked FitzRoy to record observations on geological features such as erratic boulders. Before they left England, FitzRoy gave Darwin a copy of the first volume of Lyell's ''Principles of Geology'' which explained features as the outcome of a gradual process taking place over extremely long periods of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|Neve|1989|pp=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his autobiography Darwin recalled Henslow giving advice at this time to obtain and study the book, "but on no account to accept the views therein advocated".&lt;ref name=k01p27&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=59 27]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin's position as a naturalist on board was as a self-funded guest with no official appointment, and he could leave the voyage at any suitable stage. At the outset [[George Peacock]] had advised that "The Admiralty are not disposed to give a salary, though they will furnish you with an official appointment &amp; every {{sic|accomo|dation}}: if a salary should be required however I am inclined to think that it would be granted". Far from wanting this,&lt;ref name="letter 106"/&gt;&lt;ref name="letter: 199"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-119 |title=Letter 119 – Darwin, C. R. to Darwin, S. E. (6 Sept 1831) |publisher=Darwin Correspondence Project }}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin's concern was to maintain control over his collection. He was even reluctant to be on the Admiralty's books for [[:wikt:victuals|victuals]] until he got assurances from FitzRoy and Beaufort that this would not affect his rights to assign his specimens.&lt;ref name="letter: 132" /&gt; Darwin did not want his collection to go to the British Museum as he had heard that specimens from the first ''Beagle'' voyage were still waiting to be described. Beaufort assured him that he "should have no difficulty" as long as he "presented them to some public body" such as the [[Zoological Society of London|Zoological]] or [[Geological Society of London|Geological]] societies. Darwin himself thought his new finds should go to the "largest &amp; most central collection", not the  [[Cambridge Philosophical Society]] museum that [[John Stevens Henslow|Henslow]] was setting up at Cambridge,&lt;ref name="letter: 123" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=208–209}}&lt;/ref&gt; but after getting Henslow's willing agreement to take delivery of the consignments of specimens, Darwin replied that he hoped to give some to the Cambridge museum.&lt;ref name="Letter 144" /&gt;

====Darwin's work on the expedition====
The captain had to record his survey in painstaking paperwork, and Darwin too kept a daily log as well as detailed notebooks of his finds and speculations, and a diary which became his journal. Darwin's notebooks show a complete professionalism that he had probably learnt at the [[University of Edinburgh]] when making natural history notes while exploring the shores of the [[Firth of Forth]] with his brother Erasmus in 1826 and studying marine invertebrates with [[Robert Edmund Grant]] for a few months in 1827.&lt;ref name=kix&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2000|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1840&amp;pageseq=12 ix–xi].}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin had also collected [[beetle]]s at Cambridge, but he was a novice in all other areas of natural history. During the voyage Darwin investigated small invertebrates, while collecting specimens of other creatures for experts to examine and describe once ''Beagle'' had returned to England.&lt;ref name=fieldnotesGalapagos&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Chancellor_Keynes_Galapagos.html |title=Darwin's field notes on the Galapagos: 'A little world within itself' |author=Gordon Chancellor |author2=[[Randal Keynes]]  |date = October 2006|publisher=[[Darwin Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than half of his carefully organised zoology notes deal with marine invertebrates, and the notes record closely reasoned interpretations of what he found about their complex internal anatomy while dissecting specimens under his microscope, and of little experiments on their response to stimulation. His onshore observations included intense, analytical comments on possible reasons for the behaviour, distribution, and relation to their environment of the creatures he saw. He made good use of the ship's excellent library of books on natural history, but continually questioned their correctness.&lt;ref name=kx&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2000|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1840&amp;pageseq=13 x].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geology was Darwin's "principal pursuit" on the expedition and his notes on that subject were almost four times larger than his zoology notes, although he kept extensive records on both. During the voyage, he wrote to his sister that "there is nothing like geology; the pleasure of the first days partridge shooting or first days hunting cannot be compared to finding a fine group of fossil bones, which tell their story of former times with almost a living tongue". To him, investigating geology brought reasoning into play and gave him opportunities for theorising.&lt;ref name=kix/&gt;
[[File:Voyage of the Beagle-en.svg|thumb|500px|right|The voyage of ''Beagle'']]

==Voyage==
Charles Darwin had been told that ''Beagle'' was expected to sail about the end of September 1831,&lt;ref name="letter 106" /&gt; but fitting out took longer. The [[Admiralty]] Instructions were received on 14 November, and on 23 November she was moved to anchorage, ready to depart. Repeated Westerly gales caused delays, and forced them to turn back after departing on 10 and 21 December. Drunkenness at Christmas lost another day. Finally, on the morning of 27 December, ''Beagle'' left its anchorage in the Barn Pool, under [[Mount Edgcumbe Country Park|Mount Edgecumbe]] on the west side of [[Plymouth Sound]] and set out on its surveying expedition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=36 4–17].}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|FitzRoy|1839|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F10.2&amp;pageseq=65 42].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atlantic islands===
''Beagle'' touched at [[Madeira]] for a confirmed position without stopping. Then on 6 January it reached [[Tenerife]] in the [[Canary Islands]], but was [[quarantined]] there because of [[cholera]] in England. Although tantalisingly near to the town of [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife|Santa Cruz]], to Darwin's intense disappointment, they were denied landing. With improving weather conditions, they sailed on. On 10 January Darwin tried out a [[plankton net]] he had devised to be towed behind the ship – only the second recorded use of such a net (after use by [[John Vaughan Thompson]] in 1816). Next day, he noted the great number of animals collected far from land and wrote "Many of these creatures so low in the scale of nature are most exquisite in their forms &amp; rich colours. — It creates a feeling of wonder that so much beauty should be apparently created for such little purpose."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1925&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=51 19–22]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six days later they made their first landing at [[Praia|Porto Praya]] on the volcanic island of [[Santiago, Cape Verde|St. Jago]] in the [[Cape Verde]] Islands. It is here that Darwin's description in his published ''[[The Voyage of the Beagle|Journal]]'' begins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1839|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F10.3&amp;pageseq=20 1–7].}}&lt;/ref&gt; His initial impression was of a desolate and sterile volcanic island, but after visiting the town he came to a deep valley where he "first saw the glory of tropical vegetation" and had "a glorious day", finding overwhelming novelty in the sights and sounds. FitzRoy set up tents and an observatory on [[Santa Maria Island, Cape Verde|Quail Island]] to determine the exact position of the islands, while Darwin collected numerous sea animals, delighting in vivid tropical corals in tidal pools, and investigating the geology of Quail Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=54 22–26]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;He also collected what would in 1837 be [[Species description|described]] by [[John Gould]] as the [[type specimen]] of ''[[Passer iagoensis]]'', the Cape Verde sparrow or Iago sparrow.&lt;/ref&gt; Though [[Charles Daubeny|Daubeny]]'s book in ''Beagle'''s library described the volcanic geology of the Canary Islands, it said that the structure of the Cape Verde Islands was "too imperfectly known". Darwin saw Quail Island as his key to understanding the structure of St. Jago, and made careful studies of its [[stratigraphy]] in the way he had learnt from [[Adam Sedgwick]]. He collected specimens and described a white layer of hard white rock formed from crushed coral and seashells lying between layers of black volcanic rocks, and noted a similar white layer running horizontally in the black cliffs of St. Jago at {{convert|40|ft|m}} above sea level. The seashells were, as far as he could tell, "the same as those of present day". He speculated that in geologically recent times a lava flow had covered this shell sand on the sea bed, and then the strata had slowly risen to their present level. [[Charles Lyell]]'s ''[[Principles of Geology]]'' presented a thesis of gradual rising and falling of the Earth's crust illustrated by the changing levels of the [[Macellum of Pozzuoli|Temple of Serapis]]. Darwin implicitly supported Lyell by remarking that "Dr. Daubeny when mentioning the present state of the temple of Serapis. doubts the possibility of a surface of country being raised without cracking buildings on it. – I feel sure at St Jago in some places a town might have been raised without injuring a house."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Herbert|1991|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=A342&amp;pageseq=6 164–170].}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to Henslow he wrote that "The geology was preeminently interesting &amp; I believe quite new: there are some facts on a large scale of upraised coast&amp;nbsp;... that would interest Mr. Lyell.&lt;ref name="Letter 171" /&gt; While still on the island, Darwin was inspired to think of writing a book on geology,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=83 81]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later wrote of "seeing a thing never seen by Lyell, one yet saw it partially through his eyes".&lt;ref&gt;[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1548.2&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=146 Letter to L. Horner], Down, 29 August 1844&lt;/ref&gt;

Customarily the ship's surgeon took the position of naturalist, and ''Beagle'''s surgeon [[Robert McCormick (explorer)|Robert McCormick]] sought fame and fortune as an explorer.&lt;ref name=f196&gt;{{harvnb|Freeman|2007|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=A27b&amp;pageseq=203 196]}}&lt;/ref&gt; When they first met at the start of the voyage, Darwin had commented that "My friend [McCormick] is an ass, but we jog on very amicably".&lt;ref name="Letter 144"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-144 |title=Letter 144 — Darwin, C.

Darwin went on subsequent "riding expeditions" with [[Benjamin Bynoe]] and Rowlett to visit [[Cidade Velha|Ribeira Grande]] and [[São Domingos, Cape Verde|St Domingo]]. FitzRoy extended their stay to 23 days, to complete his measurements of [[Magnetic anomaly|magnetism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=60 28–34]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin subsequently wrote to Henslow that his collecting included "several specimens of an Octopus, which possessed a most marvellous power of changing its colours; equalling any chamaelion, &amp; evidently accommodating the changes to the colour of the ground which it passed over.—yellowish green, dark brown &amp; red were the prevailing colours: this fact appears to be new, as far as I can find out."&lt;ref name="Letter 171" /&gt; Henslow replied that "The fact is not new, but any fresh observations will be highly important."&lt;ref name="Letter 196"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Letter 196 &amp;#8212; Henslow, J.

McCormick increasingly resented the favours FitzRoy gave to assist Darwin with collecting. On 16 February, FitzRoy landed a small party including himself and Darwin on [[Saint Peter and Paul Rocks|St. Paul's rocks]], finding the seabirds so tame that they could be killed easily, while an exasperated McCormick was left circling the islets in a second small boat.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=202–204}}&lt;/ref&gt; That evening novices were greeted by a pseudo-[[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]], and in the morning they crossed the [[equator]] with the traditional [[line-crossing ceremony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|FitzRoy|1839|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F10.2&amp;pageseq=83 56–58].}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=68 36–38].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin had a special position as guest and social equal of the captain, so junior officers called him "sir" until the captain dubbed Darwin ''Philos'' for "ship's philosopher", and this became his suitably respectful nickname.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|1995|p=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surveying South America===
In South America,  ''Beagle'' carried out its survey work going to and fro to along the coasts to allow careful measurement and rechecking.
Darwin made long journeys inland with travelling companions from the locality. He spent much of the time away from the ship, returning by prearrangement when ''Beagle'' returned to ports where mail could be received and Darwin's notes, journals, and collections sent back to England. He had ensured that his collections were his own and they were shipped back to [[John Stevens Henslow|Henslow]] in [[Cambridge]] to await his return. Several others on board including FitzRoy and other officers were able amateur naturalists, and they gave Darwin generous assistance as well as making collections for the Crown, which the [[Admiralty]] placed in the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|Neve|1989|pp=11–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tropical paradise and slavery====
Due to heavy surf they only stayed at [[Fernando de Noronha]] for a day to make the required observations, and Fitzroy decided to make for [[Bahia, Brazil|Bahia]], [[Brazil]], to rate the chronometers and take on water.&lt;ref name="admiralty 1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|FitzRoy|1839|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F10.2&amp;pageseq=89 58–60].}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 February they reached the continent, arriving at the magnificent sight of the town now known as [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], with large ships at harbour scattered across the bay. On the next day, Darwin was in "transports of pleasure" walking by himself in the [[Bahia coastal forests|tropical forest]], and in "long naturalizing walks" with others continued to "add raptures to the former raptures".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=73 41–44].}}&lt;/ref&gt; He found the sights of slavery offensive and when FitzRoy defended the practice by describing a visit to a slaveowner whose slaves replied "no" on being asked by their master if they wished to be freed, Darwin suggested that answers in such circumstances were worthless. Enraged that his word had been questioned, FitzRoy lost his temper and banned Darwin from his company. The officers had nicknamed such outbursts "hot coffee," and within hours FitzRoy apologised and asked Darwin to remain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=75 73–74].}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, FitzRoy had to remain silent when Captain Paget visited them and recounted "facts about slavery so revolting" that refuted his claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=77 45]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Surveying of sandbanks around the harbour was completed on 18 March, and the ship made its way down the coast to survey the extent and depths of the [[Abrolhos Archipelago|Abrolhos reefs]], completing and correcting [[Albin Roussin|Roussin's]] survey.&lt;ref name="keynes 48" /&gt;

On 4 April they entered the harbour of [[Rio de Janeiro]], to make observations of [[longitude]] from [[Villegagnon Island]]. Darwin took in the sights of the city then made an expedition into the interior, returning to the ship on 24 April. By then [[Robert McCormick (explorer)|Robert McCormick]] had left the ship, with permission from the admiral in command, and returned to England. Assistant Surgeon [[Benjamin Bynoe]] was made acting surgeon in his place.&lt;ref name="keynes 48"&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=80 48–65].}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCormick felt "very much disappointed in my expectations of carrying out my natural history pursuits, every obstacle having been placed in the way of my getting on shore and making collections" while the gentleman Darwin received all the invitations from dignitaries onshore and was given facilities to pack his collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|1995|p=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On 26 April Darwin moved into a house he had rented at [[Botafogo]], and stayed there with three others when ''Beagle'' left on 10 May to recheck observations at Bahia.&lt;ref name="keynes 48" /&gt; FitzRoy had found a discrepancy of {{convert|4|miles|km}} in the meridian distance of longitude between his measurements and those of [[Albin Roussin]], and decided to go back. A seaman, a [[Cabin boy|ship's boy]] and a young [[midshipman]] had caught a fever after visiting the [[Macacu River]], and died. When the ship returned to Rio on 3 June, FitzRoy confirmed that his measurements of Bahia and of the Abrolhos reefs were correct, and sent these corrections to Roussin. They sailed from Rio on 5 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|FitzRoy|1839|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F10.2&amp;pageseq=109 74–81].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fossil finds====
After storms, ''Beagle'' reached [[Montevideo]] on 26 July 1832, and took observations for the chronometers. An attempt to call at [[Buenos Aires]] for information was thwarted by officials, then FitzRoy agreed a request for ship's crew (and Darwin) to briefly occupy a Montevideo fort to dispel a [[revolution]]. On 22 August, after taking soundings in [[Samborombón Bay]], ''Beagle'' began survey work down the coast from [[Cape San Antonio, Argentina|Cape San Antonio]], Buenos Aires Province, Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|FitzRoy|1839|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F10.2&amp;pageseq=129 94–97].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Bahía Blanca]], in the southern part of present [[Buenos Aires Province]], Darwin rode inland into [[Patagonia]] with [[gaucho]]s: he saw them use [[bolas]] to bring down "ostriches" ([[rhea (bird)|rheas]]), and ate roast [[armadillo]]. With FitzRoy, he went for "a very pleasant cruize about the bay" on 22 September, and about {{convert|10|mi|km|spell=in}} from the ship they stopped for a while at [[Punta Alta]]. In low cliffs near the point Darwin found [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate rocks]] containing numerous shells and fossilised teeth and bones of gigantic extinct [[mammal]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=136 104–109]}}; p. 109, Keynes notes the site is now under [[Puerto Belgrano]] naval base.&lt;/ref&gt; in strata near an earth layer with shells and [[armadillo]] fossils, suggesting to him quiet tidal deposits rather than a catastrophe.&lt;ref name=cpw&gt;[http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Chancellor_fieldNotebooks1.10.html 'Cinnamon and port wine': an introduction to the ''Rio Notebook''], Bahía Blanca, September—October 1832.&lt;/ref&gt; With assistance (possibly from the young sailor [[Syms Covington]] acting as his servant&lt;ref name="Fitz 106" /&gt;&lt;ref name=JSC3&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://austehc.unimelb.edu.au/bsparcs/covingto/chap_3.htm#cite37|title=The Journal of Syms Covington – Chapter Three |author= |authorlink= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060826001731/http://austehc.unimelb.edu.au/bsparcs/covingto/chap_3.htm |archivedate=2006-08-26 |quote= |accessdate=2008-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Darwin collected numerous fossils over several days,&lt;ref name=D46PA&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1846|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F273&amp;pageseq=98 84].}}&lt;/ref&gt; amusing others with "the cargoes of apparent rubbish which he frequently brought on board".&lt;ref name="Fitz 106"&gt;{{harvnb|FitzRoy|1839|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=141&amp;itemID=F10.2&amp;viewtype=text 106–107].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the second day was taken up with excavating a large skull which Darwin found embedded in soft rock, and seemed to him to be allied to the [[rhinoceros]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=139 107].}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 October he returned to the site, and found a jawbone and tooth which he was able to identify using [[Jean Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent|Bory de Saint-Vincent]]'s ''Dictionnaire classique''. He wrote home describing this and the large skull as ''[[Megatherium]]'' fossils, or perhaps ''[[Megalonyx]]'', and excitedly noted that the only specimens in Europe were locked away in the King's collection at [[Madrid]].&lt;ref name=k109&gt;{{Harvnb|Keynes|2001|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=141 109]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Letter188&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-188.html#back-mark-188.f3 |title=Darwin Correspondence Project – Letter 188 — Darwin, C.

His immediate thought was that they came from an enormous armadillo like the small creatures common in the area, but from [[Georges Cuvier|Cuvier]]'s misleading description of the Madrid specimen and a recent newspaper report about a fossil found by [[Woodbine Parish]], Darwin thought that the bony armour identified the fossil as ''Megatherium''.&lt;ref name=Letter192&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-192.html#mark-192.f4 |title=Darwin Correspondence Project – Letter 192 — Darwin, C.

At Montevideo in November the mail from home included a copy of the second volume of [[Charles Lyell]]'s ''[[Principles of Geology]]'',&lt;ref name=k01p27/&gt; a refutation of [[Lamarckism]] in which there was no shared ancestry of different species or overall progress to match the gradual geological change, but a continuing cycle in which species mysteriously appeared, closely adapted to their "centres of creation", then became extinct when the environment changed to their disadvantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tierra del Fuego====
[[File:Fuegian BeagleVoyage.jpg|upright|thumb|Native of the [[Tierra del Fuego]].{{efn|His encounter with the natives of the [[Tierra del Fuego]] on his ''Beagle'' voyage made Darwin believe that [[civilization]] had evolved over time from a more primitive state.}}]]

They reached [[Tierra del Fuego]] on 18 December 1832 and Darwin was taken aback at what he perceived as the crude savagery of the [[Yaghan]] natives, in stark contrast to the "civilised" behaviour of the three [[Fuegians]] they were returning as missionaries (who had been given the names York Minster, Fuegia Basket and [[Jemmy Button]]). He described his first meeting with the native Fuegians as being "without exception the most curious and interesting spectacle I ever beheld: I could not have believed how wide was the difference between savage and civilised man: it is greater than between a wild and domesticated animal, inasmuch as in man there is a greater power of improvement." In contrast, he said of Jemmy that "It seems yet wonderful to me, when I think over all his many good qualities, that he should have been of the same race, and doubtless partaken of the same character, with the miserable, degraded savages whom we first met here." (Four decades later, he recalled these impressions in ''[[The Descent of Man]]'' to support his argument that just as humans had descended from "a lower form", civilised society had arisen by graduations from a more primitive state. He recalled how closely the Fuegians on board ''Beagle'' "resembled us in disposition and in most of our mental faculties."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1871|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F937.1&amp;pageseq=47 34–35], [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F937.1&amp;pageseq=193 180–181]}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

At the island of "Buttons Land" on 23 January 1833 they set up a mission post, with huts, gardens, furniture and crockery, but when they returned nine days later the possessions had been looted and divided up equally by the natives. Matthews gave up, rejoining the ship and leaving the three civilised Fuegians to continue the missionary work. ''Beagle'' went on to the [[Falkland Islands]] arriving just after the [[Re-establishment of British rule on the Falklands (1833)|British return]]. Darwin studied the relationships of species to habitats and found ancient fossils like those he had found in Wales. Fitzroy bought a [[schooner]] to assist with the surveying, and they returned to Patagonia where this was fitted with a new copper bottom and renamed ''Adventure''. Darwin was assisted by [[Syms Covington]] in preserving specimens and his collecting was so successful that with FitzRoy's agreement he took on Covington as a full-time servant for £30 a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|pp=134–138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gauchos, rheas, fossils and geology====
The two ships sailed to the [[Río Negro (Argentina)|Río Negro]] in  [[Argentina]] and on 8 August 1833 Darwin left on another journey inland with the [[gaucho]]s. On 12&amp;nbsp;August he met General [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]] who was then leading a [[punitive expedition]] in [[Desert Campaign (1833–34)|his military campaign]] against [[Indigenous peoples in Argentina|native "Indians"]], and obtained a passport from him. As they crossed the [[pampas]] the gauchos and Indians told Darwin of a rare smaller species of [[Darwin's rhea|rhea]].&lt;ref name=B63-271&gt;{{harvnb|Barlow|1963|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1577&amp;pageseq=73 271–5].}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After three days at [[Bahía Blanca]] he grew tired of waiting for ''Beagle'' and on 21&amp;nbsp;August revisited Punta Alta where he reviewed the geology of the site in light of his new knowledge, wondering if the bones were older than the seashells. He was very successful with searching for bones, and on 1&amp;nbsp;September found a near complete skeleton with its bones still in position.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barlow|1945|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1571&amp;pageseq=213 193–196].}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Letter215&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-215.html |title=Darwin Correspondence Project – Letter 215 — Darwin, C.

He set off again and on 1&amp;nbsp;October searching the cliffs of the [[Carcarañá River]] found "an enormous gnawing tooth" then in a cliff of the [[Paraná River]] saw "two great groups of immense bones" which were too soft to collect but a tooth fragment identified them as [[mastodon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=225 193].}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Letter229&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-229.html |title=Darwin Correspondence Project – Letter 229 — Darwin, C.

The passport helped and with Covington he managed to escape in a boatload of refugees. They rejoined ''Beagle'' at [[Montevideo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=227 195–198].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As surveys were still in progress Darwin set off on another {{convert|400|mi|km|adj=on}} "galloping" trip in [[Uruguay|Banda Oriental]] to see the [[Uruguay River]] and visit the Estancia of Mr Keen near [[Mercedes, Uruguay|Mercedes]] on the [[Río Negro (Uruguay)|Río Negro]]. On 25&amp;nbsp;November he "heard of some giants bones, which as usual turned out to be those of the Megatherium" but could only extract a few broken fragments, then on the next day visited a nearby house and bought for about two [[shilling]]s "a head of a Megatherium which must have been when found quite perfect", though the teeth had since been broken and the lower jaw had been lost. Mr Keen arranged to ship the skull down river to Buenos Aires.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=235 203–204].}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Letter238&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-238.html#back-mark-238.f2|title=Darwin Correspondence Project – Letter 238 — Darwin, C.

[[File:Image-Rhea Darwinii1.jpg|thumb|Illustration of [[Darwin's rhea]], published in 1841 in [[John Gould]]'s description of birds collected on ''Beagle'''s voyage.]]
Back at Montevideo, Darwin was introduced to [[Conrad Martens]], the replacement artist brought on board ''Beagle'' after Augustus Earle had to leave due to health problems. They sailed south, putting in at [[Puerto Deseado|Port Desire]] on 23&amp;nbsp;December, and the following day Darwin shot a [[guanaco]] which provided them with a Christmas meal. Early in the new year, Martens shot a rhea which they enjoyed eating before Darwin realised that this was the elusive smaller rhea, and preserved the remains.&lt;ref name=B63-271/&gt; On 9&amp;nbsp;January&amp;nbsp;1834, {{convert|110|mi|km}} further south, they reached [[Puerto San Julián|Port St Julian]] and exploring the [[Patagonia#Geology|local geology]] in cliffs near the harbour Darwin found fossils of pieces of spine and a hind leg of "some large animal, I fancy a Mastodon".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=240 208–214]}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|Barlow|1967|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1598&amp;pageseq=106 84].}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Letter238/&gt; On 26 January they entered the [[Straits of Magellan]] and at [[St. Gregory's Bay]] they met half-civilised Patagonian "giants" over {{convert|6|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall, described by Darwin as "excellent practical naturalists". One told him that the smaller rheas were the only species this far south, while the larger rheas kept to the north, the species meeting around the Rio Negro.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barlow|1963|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1577&amp;pageseq=74 272].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After further surveying in Tierra del Fuego they returned on 5 March 1834 to visit the missionaries, but found the huts deserted. Then canoes approached and they found that one of the natives was [[Jemmy Button]], who had lost his possessions and had settled into the native ways, taking a wife. Darwin had never seen "so complete &amp; grievous a change". Jemmy came on board and dined using his cutlery properly, speaking English as well as ever, then assured them that he "had not the least wish to return to England" and was "happy and contented", leaving them gifts of otter skins and arrowheads before returning to the canoe to join his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=258 226–227].}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the first visit Darwin had written that "Viewing such men, one can hardly make oneself believe that they are fellow creatures placed in the same world.&amp;nbsp;.... It is a common subject of conjecture; what pleasure in life some of the less gifted animals can enjoy? How much more reasonably it may be asked with respect to these men",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=254 222–223]}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet Jemmy had readily adapted to civilisation and then chosen to return to his primitive ways. This raised awkward questions; it jarred with [[Charles Lyell]]'s sheltered views, expressed in volume 2 of his ''[[Principles of Geology]]'', that [[Race (classification of humans)|human races]] "showed only a slight deviation from a common standard", and that acceptance of transmutation meant renouncing man's "belief in the high genealogy of his species".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|pp=146–147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About this time Darwin wrote ''Reflection on reading my Geological notes'', the first of a series of essays included in his notes.&lt;ref name=introBandaOriental/&gt; He speculated on possible causes of the land repeatedly being raised, and on a history of life in Patagonia as a sequence of named species.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Herbert|1995|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1956&amp;pageseq=1 23].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They returned to the Falkland Islands on 16&amp;nbsp;March just after an incident where gauchos and Indians had butchered senior members of Vernet's settlement, and helped to put the revolt down. Darwin noted the immense number of organisms dependent on the [[kelp forest]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2000|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1840&amp;pageseq=22 xix].}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received word from [[John Stevens Henslow|Henslow]] that his first dispatch of specimens had reached Cambridge, with the South American fossils being prized by the expert [[William Clift]] as showing hitherto unknown species and features of the Megatherium, and displayed by [[William Buckland]] and Clift before the cream of British science, making Darwin's reputation.&lt;ref name=Letter238/&gt;&lt;ref name=Letter213&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-213.html#back-mark-213.f1 |title=Darwin Correspondence Project – Letter 213 — Henslow, J. S. to Darwin, C. R., 31 Aug 1833 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Beagle'' now sailed to southern Patagonia, and on 19 April an expedition including FitzRoy and Darwin set off to take boats as far as possible up the [[Santa Cruz River (Argentina)|Santa Cruz river]], with all involved taking turn in teams dragging the boats upstream. The river cut through a series of rises then plateaux forming wide plains covered with shells and shingle, and Darwin discussed with FitzRoy his interpretation that these terraces had been shores that had gradually raised in accordance with Lyell's theories. Several of the smaller rheas were seen in the distance, but were too elusive to catch.&lt;ref name=B63-271/&gt; The expedition approached the Andes but had to turn back.

Darwin summarised his speculation in his essay on the ''Elevation of Patagonia''. Though tentative, it challenged Lyell's ideas. Darwin drew on measurements by ''Beagle''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s officers as well as his own measurements to propose that the plains had been raised in successive stages by forces acting over a wide area, rather than smaller scale actions in a continuous movement. However, he supported Lyell in finding evidence to dismiss a sudden deluge when normal processes were suddenly speeded. Seashells he had found far inland still showing their colour suggested to him that the process had been relatively recent, and could have affected human history.&lt;ref name=herb16&gt;{{harvnb|Herbert|1991|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=A342&amp;pageseq=16 174–179].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====West coast of South America====
[[File:Cerro La Campana.jpg|thumb|right|The Bell mountain, ''[[Cerro La Campana]]'', which Darwin ascended on 17 August 1834.]]
''Beagle'' and ''Adventure'' now surveyed the [[Straits of Magellan]] before sailing north round up the west coast, reaching the island of [[Chiloé Island|Chiloé]] in the wet and heavily wooded [[Chiloé Archipelago]] on 28 June 1834. They then spent the next six months surveying the coast and islands southwards. On Chiloé, Darwin found fragments of black [[lignite]] and [[petrifaction|petrified]] wood, at least two of which the [[British Geological Survey]] discovered in 2011 locked away in their collection labeled "unregistered fossil plants". Exchanged with [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]] about ten years later, one slide was signed "Chiloe, C. Darwin Esq".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joseph Hooker, botanist to the Survey|url=http://bgs.ac.uk/discoveringGeology/geologyOfBritain/archives/jdhooker/jHooker.html#voyages|publisher=British Geological Survey|accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They arrived at [[Valparaiso]] on 23 July. After several walks in the area, Darwin obtained horses and on 14 August set off up the volcanic [[Andes]] with a companion. Three days later they spent an enjoyable day on the summit of the [[Cerro La Campana|Bell mountain]]. Darwin visited a copper mine and spent five days scrambling in the mountains before going on to [[Santiago, Chile]]. On his way back, he fell ill on 20 September and had to spend a month in bed. It is possible that he contracted [[Chagas' disease]] here, leading to [[Charles Darwin's health|his health problems]] after his return to England, but this diagnosis of his symptoms is disputed. He learnt that the Admiralty had reprimanded FitzRoy for buying  ''Adventure''. FitzRoy had taken it badly, selling the ship and announcing they would go back to recheck his survey, then had resigned his command doubting his sanity, but was persuaded by his officers to withdraw his resignation and proceed. The artist [[Conrad Martens]] left the ship and took passage to Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=281 249–264]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After waiting for Darwin, ''Beagle'' sailed on 11 November to survey the Chonos Archipelago. From here they saw the eruption of the volcano [[Osorno (volcano)|Osorno]] in the Andes. They sailed north, and Darwin wondered about the fossils he had found. The giant ''[[Mastodon]]''s&lt;!-- Mastodon is an obsolete genus name. --&gt; and ''[[Megatherium]]''s were extinct, but he had found no geological signs of a "[[catastrophism|diluvial debacle]]" or of the changed circumstances that, in Lyell's view, led to species no longer being adapted to the position they were created to fit. He agreed with Lyell's idea of "the gradual birth &amp; death of species" but, unlike Lyell, Darwin was willing to believe [[Giovanni Battista Brocchi]]'s idea that extinct species had somehow aged and died out.&lt;ref name=bonesofMastodon&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=CUL-DAR42.97-99&amp;pageseq=1 |title=The position of the bones of Mastodon (?) at Port St Julian is of interest |author=Charles Darwin |authorlink=Charles Darwin |date=February 1835 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HurrahChiloe&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Chancellor_fieldNotebooks1.8.html |title=Darwin Online: 'Hurrah Chiloe': an introduction to the Port Desire Notebook |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Remains of the Cathedral of Conception - 1835.png|thumb|right|Concepción after the earthquake, as drawn by Lieutenant [[John Clements Wickham]] of ''Beagle''.]]
They arrived at the port of [[Valdivia, Chile|Valdivia]] on 8 February 1835, then twelve days later Darwin was on shore when he experienced a [[1835 Concepción earthquake|severe earthquake]] and returned to find the port town badly damaged. They sailed {{convert|200|mi|km|spell=in}} north to [[Concepción, Chile|Concepción]], and arrived on 4 March to find that the same earthquake had devastated the city by repeated shocks and a tsunami, with even the cathedral in ruins. Darwin noted the horrors of death and destruction, and FitzRoy carefully established that [[mussel]] beds were now above high tide, giving clear evidence of the ground rising some {{convert|9|ft|m|abbr=on}} which he confirmed a month later. They had actually experienced the gradual process of the continent emerging from the ocean as Lyell had indicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=324 292–303].}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=158–162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Back in Valparaiso, Darwin set out on another trek up the Andes and on 21 March reached the continental divide at {{convert|13,000|ft|m|abbr=on}}: even here he found fossil seashells in the rocks. He felt the glorious view "was like watching a thunderstorm, or hearing in the full Orchestra a Chorus of the Messiah."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=340 308–309]}}&lt;/ref&gt; After going on to [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]] they were returning by a different pass when they found a petrified forest of fossilised trees, crystallised in a sandstone escarpment showing him that they had been on a Pacific beach when the land sank, burying them in sand which had been compressed into rock, then had gradually been raised with the continent to stand at {{convert|7,000|ft|m|abbr=on}} in the mountains. On returning to Valparaiso with half a mule's load of specimens he wrote to his father that his findings, if accepted, would be crucial to the theory of the formation of the world. After another gruelling expedition in the Andes while ''Beagle'' was refitted he rejoined it and sailed to [[Lima]], but found an armed insurrection in progress and had to stay with the ship. Here he was writing up his notes when he realised that Lyell's idea that coral atolls were on the rims of rising extinct volcanoes made less sense than the volcanoes gradually sinking so that the coral reefs around the island kept building themselves close to sea level and became an atoll as the volcano disappeared below. This was [[The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs|a theory]] he would examine when they reached such islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Herbert|1991|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=A342&amp;pageseq=29 187–190]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Galápagos Islands===
A week out of Lima, ''Beagle'' reached the [[Galápagos Islands]] on 15 September 1835. The next day Captain FitzRoy dropped anchor near the site of the modern town of [[Puerto Baquerizo Moreno]] on [[San Cristóbal Island|Chatham Island]]. At the location that is now known as Frigatebird Hill/Cerro Tijeretas, Darwin spent his first hour on shore in the Galapagos islands.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, K. Thalia and Estes, Gregory B. "Darwin in Galapagos: Footsteps to a New World." 2009. Princeton University Press. [http://darwiningalapagos.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin eagerly looked forward to seeing newly formed volcanic islands, and took every opportunity to go ashore while ''Beagle'' was methodically moved round to chart the coast. He found broken black rocky volcanic lava scorching under the hot sun, and made detailed geological notes of features including [[volcanic cone]]s like chimneys which reminded him of the iron foundries of industrial [[Staffordshire]].&lt;ref name=k354&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=385 353–354].}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was disappointed that he did not see active volcanoes or find strata showing uplift as he had hoped, though one of the officers found broken oyster-shells high above the sea on one of the islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1845|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F272&amp;pageseq=128 114–115].}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abundant giant [[Galápagos tortoise]]s appeared to him almost [[antediluvian]], and large black [[marine iguana]]s seemed "most disgusting, clumsy Lizards" well suited to their habitat – he noted that someone had called them "imps of darkness".&lt;ref name=k354/&gt; Darwin had learnt from [[John Stevens Henslow|Henslow]] about studying the geographical distribution of species, and particularly of linked species on oceanic islands and on nearby continents, so he endeavoured to collect plants in flower. He found widespread "wretched-looking" thin scrub thickets of only ten species, and very few insects. Birds were remarkably unafraid of humans, and in his first field note he recorded that [[San Cristobal mockingbird|a mockingbird]] was similar to those he had seen on the continent.&lt;ref name=fieldnotesGalapagos/&gt;&lt;ref name=gould&gt;{{harvnb|Gould|1839|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F8.11&amp;pageseq=10 62–64]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Galapagos mockingbird -Santa Cruz -Charles Darwin Research Centre.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Mimus|various Galápagos mockingbirds]] Darwin caught resembled the [[Chile]]an [[mockingbird]] [[Chilean mockingbird|''Mimus thenka'']], but differed from island to island.]]
''Beagle'' sailed on to [[Floreana Island|Charles Island]]. By chance they were greeted by the Englishman [[Nicholas Lawson]], acting Governor of Galápagos for the [[Ecuador|Republic of the Equator]], who accompanied them up to the [[penal colony]]. It was said that tortoises differed in the shape of the shells from island to island, and Darwin noted Lawson's statement that on seeing a tortoise he could "pronounce with certainty from which island it has been brought".&lt;ref name=k2k291&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2000|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1840&amp;pageseq=328 291].}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Darwin remembered this later, he did not pay much attention at the time. However, he found [[Floreana mockingbird|a mockingbird]] and "fortunately happened to observe" that it differed from the Chatham Island specimen, so from then on carefully noted where mockingbirds had been caught.&lt;ref name=fieldnotesGalapagos/&gt;&lt;ref name=gould/&gt; He industriously collected all the animals, plants, insects &amp; reptiles, and speculated about finding "from future comparison to what district or 'centre of creation' the organized beings of this archipelago must be attached."&lt;ref name=K2001356&gt;{{Harvnb|Keynes|2001|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=388 356].}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this stage his thoughts reflected Lyell's rejection of [[transmutation of species]].&lt;ref name=K2000xix/&gt;

They went on to [[Isabela Island (Ecuador)|Albemarle Island]], where Darwin saw a small jet of smoke from a recently active volcano. On 1 October he landed near Tagus Cove and explored Beagle Crater.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, K. Thalia and Estes, Gregory B. "Darwin in Galapagos: Footsteps to a New World." 2009 Princeton University Press. [http://darwiningalapagos.com]&lt;/ref&gt; There he saw his first [[Galapagos land iguana]]s. Water pits were disappointingly inadequate for drinking, but attracted swarms of small birds and Darwin made his only note of the [[Darwin's finches|finches]] he was not bothering to label by island.&lt;ref name=K2001357&gt;{{Harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=389 357–360].}}&lt;/ref&gt; He caught a [[Galápagos mockingbird|third species of mockingbird]].&lt;ref name=gould/&gt;

After passing the northern islands of [[Pinta Island|Abingdon]], [[Genovesa Island|Tower]] and [[Marchena Island|Bindloe]], Darwin was put ashore at [[Santiago Island (Galápagos)|James Island]] for nine days together with the surgeon Benjamin Bynoe and their servants, and they busily collected all sorts of specimens while ''Beagle'' went back to Chatham Island for fresh water.&lt;ref name=K2001360&gt;{{Harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=392 360–367].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After further surveying, ''Beagle'' set sail for Tahiti on 20 October 1835. Darwin wrote up his notes, and to his astonishment found that all the mockingbirds caught on Charles, Albemarle, James and Chatham Islands differed from island to island.&lt;ref name=fieldnotesGalapagos/&gt; He wrote "This birds which is so closely allied to the Thenca of Chili (Callandra of B. Ayres) is singular from existing as varieties or distinct species in the different Isds.— I have four specimens from as many Isds.— These will be found to be 2 or 3 varieties.— Each variety is constant in its own Island....".&lt;ref name=k2k298&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2000|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1840&amp;pageseq=335 298].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tahiti to Australia===
They sailed on, dining on Galapagos tortoises, and passed the [[atoll]] of [[Puka-Puka|Honden Island]] on 9 November. They passed through the [[Tuamotus|Low Islands]] archipelago, with Darwin remarking that they had "a very uninteresting appearance; a long brilliantly white beach is capped by a low bright line of green vegetation." Arriving at [[Tahiti]] on 15 November he soon found interest in luxuriant vegetation and the pleasant intelligent natives who showed the benefits of Christianity, refuting allegations he had read about tyrannical missionaries overturning indigenous cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=396 364–378]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 December they reached [[New Zealand]] where Darwin thought the tattooed [[Māori people|Māori]] to be savages with character of a much lower order than the Tahitians, and noted that they and their homes were "filthily dirty and offensive". He saw missionaries bringing improvement in character as well as new farming practices with an exemplary "English farm" employing natives. Richard Matthews was left here with his elder brother Joseph Matthews who was a missionary at [[Kaitaia]]. Darwin and FitzRoy were agreed that missionaries had been unfairly misrepresented in tracts, particularly one written by the artist [[Augustus Earle]] which he had left on the ship. Darwin also noted many English residents of the most worthless character, including runaway convicts from [[New South Wales]]. By 30 December he was glad to leave New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=412 380–395]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first sight of [[Australia]] on 12 January 1836 reminded him of Patagonia, but inland the country improved and he was soon filled with admiration at the bustling city of [[Sydney]]. On a journey into the interior he came across a group of aborigines who looked "good-humoured &amp; pleasant &amp; they appeared far from such utterly degraded beings as usually represented". They gave him a display of spear throwing for a shilling, and he reflected sadly on how their numbers were rapidly decreasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=430 398–399].}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a large sheep farm he joined a hunting party and caught his first marsupial, a "[[Potoridae|potoroo]]" (rat-kangaroo). Reflecting on the strange animals of the country, he thought that an unbeliever "might exclaim 'Surely two distinct Creators must have been [at] work; their object however has been the same &amp; certainly the end in each case is complete'," yet an [[antlion]] he was watching was very similar to its European counterpart. That evening he saw the even stranger [[platypus]] and noticed that its bill was soft, unlike the preserved specimens he had seen. Aboriginal stories that they laid eggs were believed by few Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=434 402–403].}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Coccatoos&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Chancellor_fieldNotebooks1.3.html |title=Darwin Online: 'Coccatoos &amp; Crows': An introduction to the Sydney Notebook }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Beagle'' visited [[Hobart]], [[Tasmania]], where Darwin was impressed by the agreeable high society of the settlers, but noted that the island's "Aboriginal blacks are all removed &amp; kept (in reality as prisoners) in a Promontory, the neck of which is guarded. I believe it was not possible to avoid this cruel step; although without doubt the misconduct of the Whites first led to the Necessity."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=440 408–410].}}&lt;/ref&gt; They then sailed to [[King George Sound|King George's Sound]] in south west Australia, a dismal settlement then being replaced by the [[Swan River Colony]]. Darwin was impressed by the "good disposition of the aboriginal blacks... Although true Savages, it is impossible not to feel an inclination to like such quiet good-natured men." He provided boiled rice for an aboriginal "[[Corroboree|Corrobery]]" dancing party performed by the men of two tribes to the great pleasure of the women and children, a "most rude barbarous scene" in which everyone appeared in high spirits, "all moving in hideous harmony"  and "perfectly at their ease".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=442 410–412].}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Beagle'''s departure in a storm was delayed when she ran aground. She was refloated and got on her way.

===Keeling Island homewards===
FitzRoy's instructions from the [[Admiralty]] required a detailed geological survey of a circular [[coral]] [[atoll]] to investigate how [[coral reef]]s formed, particularly whether they rose from the bottom of the sea or from the summits of extinct volcanoes, and the effects of [[tide]]s measured with specially constructed gauges. He chose the [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands|Keeling Islands]] in the [[Indian Ocean]], and on arrival on 1 April the entire crew set to work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|FitzRoy|1839|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F10.2&amp;pageseq=61 38–39], [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F10.2&amp;pageseq=748 629–637].}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin found a coconut economy, serving both the small settlement and wildlife. There was a limited range of native plants and no land birds, but [[hermit crab]]s everywhere. The lagoons teemed with a rich variety of invertebrates and fish, and he examined the atoll's structure in view of [[The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs|the theory]] he had developed in Lima, of encircling reefs becoming atolls as an island sank.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=445 413–419].}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was supported by the numerous [[Sounding line|soundings]] FitzRoy had taken showing a steep slope outside the reef with no living corals below 20–30 [[fathom]]s (40–60&amp;nbsp;m).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1845|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F14&amp;pageseq=480 467–468].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arriving at [[Mauritius]] on 29 April 1836, Darwin was impressed by the civilised prosperity of the French colony which had come under British rule. He toured the island, examining its volcanic mountains and fringing coral reefs. The Surveyor-general Captain Lloyd took him on the only elephant on the island to see an elevated coral plain.&lt;ref name=Coccatoos/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1845|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F14&amp;pageseq=496 483–486].}}&lt;/ref&gt; By then FitzRoy was writing the official ''Narrative'' of the ''Beagle'' voyages, and after reading Darwin’s diary he proposed incorporating it into the account, a suggestion Darwin discussed with his family.&lt;ref name=Letter301&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-301.html |title=Darwin Correspondence Project – Letter 301 — Darwin, C.

''Beagle'' reached the [[Cape of Good Hope]] on 31 May. In [[Cape Town]] Darwin received a letter dated 29 December from his sister Caroline telling him that his fame was spreading. On 18 November 1835 Sedgwick had read extracts from Darwin's geological notes to the [[Geological Society of London]], and this had been reported in ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|The Athenæum]]'' on 21 November. On 25 December their father received a letter from Henslow which said that Darwin would become one of the premier naturalists of the time, and enclosed some copies of a book of extracts of Darwin's letters on South American geology which had been printed for private distribution. Their father "did not move from his seat till he had read every word of ''your'' book &amp; he was very much gratified – he liked so much the simple clear way you gave your information".&lt;ref name=Letter291&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-291.html |title=Darwin Correspondence Project – Letter 291 — Darwin, C.

The zoologist [[Andrew Smith (zoologist)|Andrew Smith]] showed him formations, and later discussed the large animals living on sparse vegetation, showing that a lack of luxuriant vegetation did not explain the extinction of the giant creatures in South America.&lt;ref name=Rascals/&gt;

Around 15 June Darwin and FitzRoy visited the noted astronomer Sir [[John Herschel]]. In his diary Darwin called this "the most memorable event which, for a long period, I have had the good fortune to enjoy." His zeal for science had been stirred at Cambridge by reading Herschel's book on philosophy of science, which had guided his theorising during the voyage.&lt;ref name=Rascals/&gt; Their discussion is not recorded, but a few months earlier, on 20 February 1836, Herschel had written to Lyell praising his ''[[Principles of Geology]]'' as a work which would bring "a complete revolution in [its] subject, by altering entirely the point of view in which it must thenceforward be contemplated." and opening a way for bold speculation on "that mystery of mysteries, the replacement of extinct species by others." Herschel himself thought [[catastrophism|catastrophic extinction and renewal]] "an inadequate conception of the Creator", and by analogy with other [[Physical law|intermediate causes]] "the origination of fresh species, could it ever come under our cognizance, would be found to be a natural in contradistinction to a miraculous process".&lt;ref name=hersch&gt;{{harvnb|van Wyhe|2007|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=A544&amp;pageseq=21 197]}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|Babbage|1838|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=A25&amp;pageseq=232 225–227]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Cape Town missionaries were being accused of causing racial tension and profiteering, and after ''Beagle'' set to sea on 18 June FitzRoy wrote an open letter to the [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] ''South African Christian Recorder'' on the ''Moral State of Tahiti'' incorporating extracts from both his and Darwin's diaries to defend the reputation of missionaries. This was given to a passing ship which took it to Cape Town to become FitzRoy's (and Darwin's) first published work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=330–331}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1640&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=1 |title=A letter, containing remarks on the moral state of Tahiti, New Zealand, &amp;c. |author=FitzRoy, R |author2=Darwin, C  |date = September 1836|work= |publisher=South African Christian Recorder |pages=221–238 |quote=At Sea, 28th June, 1836}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 July they stopped at [[St. Helena]] for six days. Darwin took lodgings near [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon's]] tomb, and when writing to Henslow asking to be proposed for the [[Geological Society of London|Geological Society]], mentioned his suspicions "that differently from most Volcanic Islds. its structure is rather complicated. It seems strange, that this little centre of a distinct creation should, as is asserted, bear marks of recent elevation."&lt;ref name=Rascals&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Chancellor_fieldNotebooks1.6.html |title=Darwin Online: 'Runaway Rascals': an introduction to the Despoblado Notebook |author= |authorlink= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Letter304&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-304.html |title=Darwin Correspondence Project – Letter 304 — Darwin, C. R. to Henslow, J. S., 9 July 1836 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With a guide he wandered over the island, noting its complex sloping [[stratum|strata]] showing [[Fault (geology)|fault lines]], interlaced with [[Fissure vent|volcanic]] [[Dike (geology)|dykes]]. He examined beds high on the hill which had been taken as seashells showing that St. Helena had risen from the ocean in recent times, but Darwin identified them as extinct species of land-shells. He noted that woodland had been destroyed by goats and hogs which had run wild since being introduced in 1502,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1844|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F272&amp;pageseq=103 89–90].}}&lt;/ref&gt; and native vegetation only predominated on high steep ridges, having been replaced by imported species.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1845|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F14&amp;pageseq=499 486–488].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At this stage Darwin had an acute interest in island [[biogeography]], and his description of St Helena as "a little centre of creation" in his geological diary reflects [[Charles Lyell]]'s speculation in Volume 2 of ''[[Principles of Geology]]'' that the island would have acted as a "focus of creative force".&lt;ref name=Rascals/&gt; He later recalled believing in the permanence of species, but "as far as I can remember, vague doubts occasionally flitted across my mind".&lt;ref name=Poulton&gt;{{harvnb|Poulton|1896|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=A334&amp;pageseq=36 28–29].}}&lt;/ref&gt; When organising his ''Ornithological Notes'' between mid June and August,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Keynes|2000|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1840&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=23 xx].}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin expanded on his initial notes on the Galapagos [[mockingbird]] ''Mimus thenca'':&lt;ref name=fieldnotesGalapagos/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
These birds are closely allied in appearance to the Thenca of Chile or Callandra of la Plata. ... In each Isld. each kind is ''exclusively'' found: habits of all are indistinguishable. When I recollect, the fact that the form of the body, shape of scales &amp; general size, the Spaniards can at once pronounce, from which Island any Tortoise may have been brought. When I see these Islands in sight of each other, &amp; [but del.] possessed of but a scanty stock of animals, tenanted by these birds, but slightly differing in structure &amp; filling the same place in Nature, I must suspect they are only varieties.&lt;br /&gt;The only fact of a similar kind of which I am aware, is the constant asserted difference — between the wolf-like Fox of East &amp; West Falkland Islds.&lt;br /&gt; If there is the slightest foundation for these remarks the zoology of Archipelagoes — will be well worth examining; for such facts [would ''inserted''] undermine the stability of Species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barlow|1963|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1577&amp;pageseq=64 262].}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The term "would" before "undermine" had been added after writing what is now noted as the first expression of his doubts about species being immutable, which led to him becoming convinced about the [[transmutation of species]] and hence [[evolution]].&lt;ref name=K2000xix&gt;{{Harvnb|Keynes|2000|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1840&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=22 xix].}}&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{Harvnb|Eldredge|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In opposing transmutation, Lyell had proposed that varieties arose due to changes in environment, but these varieties lived in similar conditions though each on its own island. Darwin had just reviewed similar inconsistencies with mainland bird genera such as ''[[Pteroptochos]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodge|2009|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=A623&amp;pageseq=4 93–98].}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though his suspicions about the [[Falkland Islands wolf|Falkland Island fox]] may have been unsupported, the differences in [[Galápagos tortoise]]s between islands were remembered, and he later wrote that he had been greatly struck from around March 1836 by the character of South American fossils and of species on the Galapagos Archipelago, noting "These facts origin (especially latter) of all my views".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barlow|1933|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1566&amp;pageseq=14 xiii].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Beagle'' reached [[Ascension Island]] on 19 July 1836, and Darwin was delighted to receive letters from his sisters with news that Sedgwick had written "He is doing admirably in S. America, &amp; has already sent home a Collection above all praise.— It was the best thing in the world for him that he went out on the Voyage of Discovery— There was some risk of his turning out an idle man: but his character will now be fixed, &amp; if God spare his life, he will have a great name among the Naturalists of Europe."&lt;ref name=Letter288&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-288.html |title=Darwin Correspondence Project – Letter 288 — Darwin, S. E. to Darwin, C. R., 22 Nov 1835 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin later recalled how he "clambered over the mountains... with a bounding step and made the volcanic rocks resound under my geological hammer!."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=83 81–82].}}&lt;/ref&gt; He agreed with the saying attributed to the people of St Helena that "We know we live on a rock, but the poor people at Ascension live on a cinder", and noted the care taken to sustain "houses, gardens &amp; fields placed near the summit of the central mountain".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=463 431–432]}}&lt;/ref&gt; (In the 1840s Darwin worked with Hooker, who proposed in 1847 that the Royal Navy import tree species, a project started in 1850 which led to the creation of an artificial cloud forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Falcon |first=Howard |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11137903 |title=Creation of an artificial cloud forest |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=1 September 2010 |accessdate=2010-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

On 23 July they set off again longing to reach home, but FitzRoy wanted to ensure the accuracy of his longitude measurements and so took the ship across the [[Atlantic]] back to [[Bahia]] in [[Brazil]] to take check readings. Darwin was glad to see the beauties of the jungle for a last time, but now compared "the stately Mango trees with the Horse Chesnuts of England."&lt;ref name=Letter306&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-306.html |title=Darwin Correspondence Project – Letter 306 — Darwin, C. R. to Darwin, S. E., 4 Aug (1836)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The return trip was delayed for a further 11 days when weather forced ''Beagle'' to shelter further up the coast at [[Pernambuco]], where Darwin examined rocks for signs of elevation, noted "Mangroves like rank grass" and investigated marine invertebrates at various depths on the sandbar. ''Beagle'' departed for home on 17 August.&lt;ref name=Rascals/&gt; After a stormy passage including a stop for supplies at the [[Azores]], the Beagle finally reached [[Falmouth, Cornwall]], [[England]] on 2 October 1836. A plaque now commemorates his arrival point in [[Falmouth, Cornwall]].

==Return==
[[File:HMSBeagle.jpg|thumb|250px|right|In 1837 [[HMS Beagle|HMS ''Beagle'']] set off on a survey of [[Australia]], shown here in an 1841 watercolour by Owen Stanley.]]
Upon his return, Darwin was quick to take the [[Stagecoach|coach]] home, arriving late at night on 4 October 1836 at [[The Mount, Shrewsbury|The Mount House]], the family home in [[Shrewsbury, Shropshire]]. Darwin reportedly headed straight to bed and greeted his family at breakfast. After ten days of catching up with family he went on to [[Cambridge]] and sought [[John Stevens Henslow|Henslow]]'s advice on organising the description and cataloguing of his collections.

Darwin's father gave him an allowance that enabled him to put aside other careers, and as a scientific celebrity with a reputation established by his fossils and Henslow's publication of his letters on South American geology, he toured [[London]]'s society institutions. By this time he was part of the "scientific [[The Establishment|establishment]]", collaborating with expert naturalists to describe his specimens, and working on ideas he had been developing during the voyage. [[Charles Lyell]] gave him enthusiastic backing. In December 1836, Darwin presented a talk to the [[Cambridge Philosophical Society]]. He wrote a paper proving that Chile, and the South American [[continent]], was slowly rising, which he read to the [[Geological Society of London]] on 4 January 1837.&lt;ref name=geosoc37&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1645&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=1 |title=Observations of proofs of recent elevation on the coast of Chili, made during the survey of His Majesty's Ship Beagle commanded by Capt. FitzRoy R.N. |author=Darwin, C. R. |authorlink=Charles Darwin |date=1837|journal=Proceedings of the Geological Society of London |volume=2 |pages=446–449}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin thought of having his diary published mixed in with FitzRoy's account, but his relatives including [[Emma Darwin|Emma]] and [[Hensleigh Wedgwood]] urged that it be published separately. On 30 December the question was settled by FitzRoy taking the advice of [[William Broderip]] that Darwin's journal should form the third volume of the ''Narrative''. Darwin set to work reorganising and trimming his diary, and incorporating scientific material from his notes. He completed his ''[[the Voyage of the Beagle|Journal and Remarks]]'' (now commonly known as ''The Voyage of the Beagle'') in August 1837, but FitzRoy was slower and the three volumes were published in August 1839.&lt;ref name=K01intro&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=20 xviii–xx].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Syms Covington]] stayed with Darwin as his servant, then on 25 February 1839 (shortly after Darwin's marriage) Covington parted on good terms and migrated to Australia.&lt;ref name=K449&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=481 449].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expert publications on Darwin's collections==
Darwin had shown great ability as a collector and had done the best he could with the reference books he had on ship. It was now the province of recognised expert specialists to establish which specimens were unknown, and make their considered [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] decisions on defining and naming new species.&lt;ref name=H11&gt;{{harvnb|Herbert|1980|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1583e&amp;pageseq=13 11].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fossils===
[[Richard Owen]] had expertise in comparative anatomy and his professional judgements revealed a succession of similar species in the same locality, giving Darwin insights which he would later recall as being central to his new views.&lt;ref name=H11/&gt; Owen met Darwin on 29 October 1836 and quickly took on the task of describing these new fossils. At that time the only fully described fossil mammals from South America were three species of ''[[Mastodon]]'' and the gigantic ''Megatherium''.&lt;ref name=O38p13&gt;{{harvnb|Owen|1840|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F9.1&amp;pageseq=23 13]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 November Darwin wrote to his sister that "Some of them are turning out great treasures." The near complete skeleton from Punta Alta was apparently very closely allied to [[anteater]]s, but of the extraordinary size of a small horse. The [[rhinoceros]] sized head bought for two shillings near [[Mercedes, Uruguay|Mercedes]] was not a megatherium, but "as far as they can guess, must have been a gnawing animal. Conceive a Rat or a Hare of such a size— What famous Cats they ought to have had in those days!"&lt;ref name=Letter321&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-321.html |title=Darwin Correspondence Project – Letter 321 — Darwin, C. R. to Darwin, C. S., (9&amp;nbsp;Nov 1836) |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following years Owen published descriptions of the most important fossils, naming several as new species.

[[File:Scelidotherium leptocephalum side.jpg|thumb|right|A ''[[Scelidotherium]]'' skeleton in Paris.]]
The fossils from [[Punta Alta]] included a nearly perfect head and three fragments of heads of the ''[[Megatherium|Megatherium Cuvierii]]'', the jaw of a related species which Owen named ''[[Mylodon|Mylodon Darwinii]]'', and jaws of ''[[Megalonyx|Megalonyx Jeffersonii]]''. The near complete skeleton was named ''[[Scelidotherium]]'' by Owen, who found it had most of its bones nearly in their proper relative positions.&lt;ref name=D46PA/&gt; At the nearby [[Monte Hermoso]] beds the numerous rodents included species allied to the [[Brazilian tuco-tuco]] and the [[capybara]].&lt;ref name=D46MH/&gt;

Owen decided that the fossils of polygonal plates of bony armour found at several locations were not from the Megatherium as [[Georges Cuvier|Cuvier]]'s description implied, but from a huge armadillo as Darwin had briefly thought. Owen found a description of an earlier unnamed specimen which he named ''[[Glyptodon|Glyptodon clavipes]]'' in 1839.&lt;ref name=O40&gt;{{harvnb|Owen|1840|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F9.1&amp;pageseq=116 106–108]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin's find from Punta Alta, a large surface about {{convert|3|by|2|ft|m|abbr=on}} doubled over with toe bones still inside the folded armour,&lt;ref name=D46PA/&gt; was identified as a slightly smaller ''[[Glyptodontidae|Glyptodont]]'' named ''[[Hoplophorus]]'' by [[Peter Wilhelm Lund|Lund]] in the same year.&lt;ref name=k109/&gt;&lt;ref name=O40/&gt;

The huge skull from near Mercedes was named ''[[Toxodon]]'' by Owen,&lt;ref name=O37&gt;{{harvnb|Owen|1837|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=A235&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=1 541–542]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he showed that the "enormous gnawing tooth" from the cliffs of the [[Carcarañá River]] was a molar from this species.&lt;ref name=O38&gt;{{harvnb|Owen|1840|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F9.1&amp;pageseq=26 16–18]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The finds near Mercedes also included a large fragment of ''Glyptodont'' armour and a head which Owen initially identified as a ''[[Glossotherium]]'', but later decided was a ''Mylodon''.&lt;ref name=D46M&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1846|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F273&amp;pageseq=106 92]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Owen found fragments of the jaw and a tooth of another ''Toxodon'' in the fossils from Punta Alta.&lt;ref name=D46PA/&gt;

The fossils from near [[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fé]] included the horse tooth which had puzzled Darwin as it had been previously thought that horses had only come to the Americas in the 16th century, close to a ''[[Toxodon]]'' tooth and a tooth of ''Mastodon andium'' (now ''[[Cuvieronius]] hyodon''). Owen confirmed that the horse tooth was of an extinct South American species which he named ''[[Equus curvidens]]'', and its age was confirmed by a corroded horse tooth among the Punta Alta fossils.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1846|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F273&amp;pageseq=104 90]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This discovery was later explained as part of the [[evolution of the horse]].

The "soft as cheese" ''[[Mastodon]]'' bones at the [[Paraná River]] were identified as two gigantic skeletons of ''Mastodon andium'', and mastodon teeth were also identified from Santa Fé and the Carcarañá River.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1846|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F273&amp;pageseq=102 88–92].}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pieces of spine and a hind leg from [[Puerto San Julián|Port S. Julian]] which Darwin had thought came from "some large animal, I fancy a Mastodon" gave Owen difficulties, as the creature which he named ''[[Macrauchenia]]'' appeared to be a "gigantic and most extraordinary [[Pachydermata|pachyderm]]", allied to the ''[[Palaeotherium]]'', but with affinities to the [[llama]] and the [[camel]].&lt;ref name=D46PSJ&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1846|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F273&amp;pageseq=109 95]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fossils at Punta Alta included a pachyderm tooth which was thought probably came from ''Macrauchenia''.&lt;ref name=D46PA/&gt;

SensUs &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sensus.org/ SensUs website]&lt;/ref&gt; is the annual international [[student competition]] on molecular [[biosensor]]s for health.&lt;ref group=a&gt;A [[biosensor]] is a compact device that interacts with a biological system to acquire a signal for diagnostic or monitoring purposes. A molecular biosensor is a biosensor with a molecular interaction as a central aspect. It is an analytical device with a molecular recognition element and with a transduction principle that turns the biomolecular interaction into a measurable signal. Molecular biosensors operate on samples taken from the body (in-vitro testing e.g. using a drop of blood) or are worn on or inside the body (for real-time in-vivo sensing).&lt;/ref&gt; Multidisciplinary student teams from universities worldwide design and build biosensing systems, and demonstrate their prototypes and business models during a final public contest event. The competition stimulates education and innovation in the field of biosensing, with a worldwide scope. The long term aim is to improve the quality of life of patients.

[[File:SensUs 2018 teams and organization.jpg|thumb|Photo of SensUs organization and Teams 2018]]

== Approach of the competition ==
Each year, SensUs adresses a different healthcare theme and a corresponding biomarker. The participating teams develop biosensors that can measure the selected biomarker. The teams have the same functional end goal, but develop creative solutions and unique biosensor prototypes. The prototypes are shown, shared and discussed at the annual SensUs contest event. SensUs is an international platform for learning and innovation in the field of molecular biosensors for healthcare applications.

== Next Edition ==
=== SensUs 2019 ===

The theme of SensUs 2019 is Rheumatoid Arthritis and the molecule to be detected is [[Adalimumab]] (brand name Humira).
Adalimumab is a biological drug that binds to TNF-alpha, a pro-inflammatory cytokine. The overexpression of this cytokine plays an important rolein rheumatoid arthritis. Many patients do not respond to treatment with Adalimumab or lose response during treatment. A biosensor for Adalimumab could detect this at an early stage and help save unnecessary costs. Worldwide annual sales of Adalimumab are more than 10 billion US dollars.&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adalimumab Adalimumab]&lt;/ref&gt;


A list of the participating universities in SensUs 2019 can be found below.
The finals of SensUs 2019 will take place on the 6th and 7th of September 2019 in Eindhoven, the Netherlands.

==History==

=== SensUs 2018 ===
[[File:SensUs 2018 Testing Event.jpg|thumb|An impression of the Testing Event of SensUs 2018]]
On the 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of September 2018, the final contest of the third edition of the Sensus Student Competition took place in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. The theme was “Measuring antibiotics for better healthcare”. The teams developed biosensors for the detection of [[vancomycin]], an important last resort antibiotic drug .

Awards were given for Analytical Performance (AP), Creativity (CR),  Translational Potential (TP) and Public Inspiration (PI), conferred by an international multidisciplinary jury and by public votes. The teams tested vancomycin in blood plasma and pitched the business models that they had developed. The public votes were casted on the online platform called SensUs Digital&lt;ref&gt;[https://digital.sensus.org/ SensUs Digital]&lt;/ref&gt;. More than 10.000 users watched SensUs via the digital platform and 3750 people cast their votes. In parallel, a competition was held for teams of High school students.

=== SensUs 2017 ===
SensUs 2017 was the second edition of the competition. The finals took place on the 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of September 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sensus2017.org/news/sensus-2017-visitors-votes-and-winners SensUs 2017 visitors, votes and winners]&lt;/ref&gt; Ten student teams from three continents built a biosensor to detect NT-proBNP in blood plasma, which is an important biomarker for [[Heart failure]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sensus2017.org/aim2017.php SensUs aim 2017, heart failure]&lt;/ref&gt; During the event the teams showed their biosensors to the public, measured NT-proBNP live and presented pitches on technology and on translation to society. 
The teams were judged by an international multidisciplinary jury, who conferred awards for Analytical Performance (AP), Creativity (CR), and Translational Potential (TP). 

About 500 people visited the event at Eindhoven University of Technology. The event was broadcast on the SensUs Digital platform&lt;ref&gt;[https://sensus.icts.tue.nl/ SensUs Digital (2017)]&lt;/ref&gt;, including livestreams, live data, Q&amp;A, photos and videos and voting functionality.

A '''Temporary Housing Area''' ('''THA'''; {{zh|t=臨時房屋區}}) is an area designated for people living in temporary houses made by wood frames and zinc plates in [[Hong Kong]].  The houses are built by the [[Hong Kong Government]] beginning in 1964 to replace wooden huts and squatter areas that began to emerge in the late 1940s and 1950s.  The name was created in the 1980s to replace the original reference of ''Licensed area''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hkmemory.hk/collections/public_housing/temporary_housing/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The building design was likely influenced from military [[barracks]].

Each house is divided into tens of tiny flats, with one flat per household. Most of the THAs were demolished by the 1990s and the last demolished was in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The dynamics of social movement in Hong Kong|first1=Stephen Wing-kai|last1=Chiu, |first2=Dale |last2=Lü, |first3=Tai-Lok|last3= Lui|publisher= Hong Kong University Press|year= 2000|ISBN=962-209-497-X|pages=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The THA is being replaced by [[Interim Housing]], a more resilient temporary home concept since the 1970s.

==Life==
Living in a THA affords little privacy.  Interior walls are only visual barriers.  Cooking and showering can only be done outside the flat.  Toilets were common areas for all residents to use and open sewer channels along the walkways connecting the THAs were often used by residents to brush their teeth or laundry.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hkmemory.hk/collections/public_housing/all_items/9099/9101/index_1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Temporary housing serves displaced people while the city is being planned or if their house is being remodeled or relocation from disasters like fire or typhoons.

'''''The Life of the Cosmos''''' is the debut non-fiction book by American [[theoretical physicist]] [[Lee Smolin]]. The book was initially published on January 1, 1997 by [[Oxford University Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|publisher=Oxford University Press|title = The Life of the Cosmos by Lee Smolin}} {{ISBN|978-0195126648}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/179756.The_Life_of_the_Cosmos?from_search=true&amp;search_version=service_impr|publisher=[[goodreads|goodreads.com]]|title=The Life of the Cosmos by Lee Smolin|accessdate=2015-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
In the book, Smolin details his [[Fecund universes]] which applies the principle of [[natural selection]] to the birth of [[universes]]. Smolin posits that the collapse of [[black holes]] could lead to the creation of a new universe. This daughter universe would have fundamental constants and parameters similar to that of the parent universe though with some changes, providing for both inheritance and mutations as required by natural selection. However, while there is no direct analogue to Darwinian selective pressures, it is theorised that a universe with "unsuccessful" parameters will reach [[Heat death of the Universe|heat death]] before being able to reproduce, meaning that certain universal parameters become more likely than others.

==Review==
{{quote|Is [[cosmological natural selection]] a theory? Yes, because it is testable. The theory predicts that Nature's parameters should be optimized for black hole production. Hence if one changes a coupling constant or a particle mass, the number of black holes should decrease. Theorists can analyze the effects of such a variation through calculations and computer simulations. Unfortunately, it is currently quite difficult to perform such an analysis because a change in a parameter affects the Universe in many disparate ways. Consider varying Newton's gravitational constant, for example. The rate of expansion of the Universe, the collapsing processes that build stars, stellar evolutions and [[supernova]] production would all change. There are about 20 parameters that can be varied. Since each may be increased or decreased, there are about 40 tests of the cosmological natural selection principle. The chances that Smolin's theory can accidentally survive all 40 tests is 1 in 2^40 or about 1 in a trillion. ''The Life of the Cosmos'' is well written in a highly intellectual style. For example, here are some sentences from a typical paragraph: ". . . If we were interested only in feeling better about ourselves, we might be happy to jump from [[vitalism]] to a kind of [[pantheism]] according to which life exists because the universe is itself alive. But our goal should be more than inventing a story that explains what we are doing in the universe. . . . What is needed is a deeper understanding of what both life and the universe are that allows us to comprehend why it is natural to find one inhabited by the other."}}

'''''This Is Your Brain on Music: The Science of a Human Obsession''''' is a [[popular science]] book written by the [[McGill University]] [[neuroscientist]] [[Daniel J. Levitin]], and first published by [[Dutton Penguin]] in the U.S. and Canada in 2006, and updated and released in paperback by Plume/Penguin in 2007.  It has been translated into 18 languages and spent more than a year on ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', and other bestseller lists, and sold more than one million copies.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen Bookscan&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The aim of ''This Is Your Brain on Music'' was to make recent findings in [[cognitive neuroscience of music]] accessible to the educated layperson.&lt;ref&gt;Huron, D. (2006). "[http://www.dana.org/news/cerebrum/detail.aspx?id=116 Exploring How Music Works Its Wonders]". ''Cerebrum''.&lt;/ref&gt; Characteristics and theoretical parameters of music are explained alongside scientific findings about how the brain interprets and processes these characteristics.&lt;ref name="Sullivan"&gt;Sullivan, J. (2006, August 20). "[http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2006/08/20/hes_rocking_the_world_of_neuroscience/ He's rocking the world of neuroscience]". ''[[The Boston Globe]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The neuroanatomy of musical expectation, emotion, listening and performance is discussed.

''This Is Your Brain on Music'' describes the components of music, such as timbre, rhythm, pitch, and harmony&lt;ref name="Bortz"&gt;Bortz, F. (2006, September 3). "The science of music, the purpose of music". ''[[The Seattle Times]]'', p. E&amp;A J9.&lt;/ref&gt; and ties them to neuroanatomy, neurochemistry, cognitive psychology, and evolution,&lt;ref name="Bortz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rothenberg"&gt;Rothenberg, D. (2006, July 29). "Music on your mind". ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', pp. D8-D9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fenton, J. (2006, September 29). "[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/sep/29/featuresreviews.guardianreview9 The food of love]".  ''[[The Guardian]]'', Features &amp; Review p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; while also making these topics accessible to nonexpert readers by avoiding the use of scientific jargon.&lt;ref name="Sullivan"/&gt; One particular focus of the book is on cognitive models of categorization and expectation, and how music exploits these cognitive processes.&lt;ref name="Bortz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rothenberg"/&gt; The book challenges [[Steven Pinker]]'s "auditory cheesecake" assertion that music was an incidental by-product of evolution, arguing instead that music served as an indicator of cognitive, emotional and physical health, and was evolutionarily advantageous as a force that led to social bonding and increased fitness, citing the arguments of [[Charles Darwin]], [[Geoffrey Miller (evolutionary psychologist)|Geoffrey Miller]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;(2006, August 7). ''[[Publishers Weekly]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

''This Is Your Brain on Music'' was a finalist for the [[Los Angeles Times]] Book Award in 2006-2007 for best in the Science and Engineering category, and a [[Quill Award]] for best debut author of 2006-2007.  It was named one of the best  books of the year by ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', ''[[The Independent]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;ref&gt;(2008, September 21). "[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/dec Pick of the paperbacks 2008]".  ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;  A long list of prominent scientists and musicians have praised it, including [[Oliver Sacks]], [[Francis Crick]], [[Brian Greene]], [[David Byrne]], [[George Martin]], [[Yoko Ono]], [[Neil Peart]], [[Victor Wooten]], [[Pete Townshend]] and [[Keith Lockhart]], and it has been adopted for course use in both science and literature classes at dozens of universities including [[MIT]], [[Dartmouth College]], [[UC Berkeley]], [[Stanford]], [[Kenyon College]], the [[University of Wisconsin]]. Two documentary films were based on the book: ''The Musical Brain'' (2009) featuring Levitin as host, along with appearances by [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Michael Bublé]], [[Feist (singer)|Feist]], and former [[Fugees]] leader [[Wyclef Jean]]; and ''The Music Instinct'' (2009) with Levitin and [[Bobby McFerrin]] as co-hosts, with appearances by [[Yo Yo Ma]], [[Jarvis Cocker]], [[Daniel Barenboim]], [[Oliver Sacks]] and others.  In 2009, [[Harvard University]] announced ''This Is Your Brain on Music'' would be required reading in its Freshman Core Program in General Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webdocs.registrar.fas.harvard.edu/faculty_handbook/current/introduction.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20060903004725/http://webdocs.registrar.fas.harvard.edu/faculty_handbook/current/introduction.html |archivedate=2006-09-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--This reference used to, but no longer supports the previous sentence.--&gt;In 2011-2012, the Physics Department at the [[California Institute of Technology]] adopted it as a textbook.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6547">'''Tournament theory''' is the theory in [[personnel economics]] used to describe certain situations where wage differences are based not on [[marginal productivity]] but instead upon relative differences between the individuals.&lt;ref&gt;• Tor Eriksson, 2009. "tournaments,"  ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]] Online'' Edition, [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2009_T000250&amp;edition=current&amp;q=tournament&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=2 Abstract].&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • Edward Lazear, 2008. "personnel economics," ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd Edition, v. 6, pp. 380-84. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_P000327&amp;q=Managerial%20economics&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=2 Abstract].&lt;/ref&gt; This theory was invented by economists [[Edward Lazear]] and [[Sherwin Rosen]].&lt;ref name="LazearRosen"&gt;Edward P. Lazear and Sherwin Rosen, 1981. "Rank-Order Tournaments as Optimum Labor Contracts," ''Journal of Political Economy'', 89(5), pp. [http://faculty.smu.edu/Millimet/classes/eco7321/papers/lazear%20rosen%201981.pdf 841-864].&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory has been applied to professional sports and to the practice of law. Tournament theory also was applied to writing - one writer may be fractionally better at writing than another (and therefore have a better book), but because people allocate small amounts of time to reading, the writer with the marginally better book will sell far more copies.

==Rank-Order Tournaments as Optimum Labour Contracts==
[http://faculty.smu.edu/Millimet/classes/eco7321/papers/lazear%20rosen%201981.pdf This paper], which proposed tournament theory, looks at performance related pay. Under conventional systems workers are paid a piece rate - an amount of money that relates to their output, rather than the time they input. Tournament theory suggests that workers can be rewarded by their rank in an organization, suggesting why large salaries are given to senior executives: to provide a 'prize' to those who put in enough effort to garner one of the top positions.

The paper invites the reader to consider the lifetime output of a worker at a firm. This output is dictated by two things - chance and skill. The worker can control his lifetime output by investing in skills early on in life,like studying hard at school and getting good qualifications, but a part of that output will be determined by chance. Participants in the tournament commit their investment early on in life and are unlikely to know each other previously, within the firm they work in, and may not even know each other within the firm. This prevents collusion or cheating in the tournament.

Looking at the tournament in its simplest form, a two player tournament, where there is a prize for the winner and a smaller consolation for the loser. The incentive to win increases as the difference between the losing and winning prize increases, and therefore the investment of the worker is increased as the difference between the winning and losing prizes is increased. It is in the interest of the firm to increase the spread of prizes. However there is a drawback for the firms. As the workers invest more their costs rise. Competing firms could offer a tournament with a lower spread and attract more workers because they would have to invest less. Therefore, there is an optimal prize spread that firms set, high enough to induce investment but low enough so that the investment is not too expensive for the worker. The prize may take the form of extra cash or a promotion - which means more money, as well as entering a higher level of tournament, where the stakes may be higher.

The idea that the prize may be in the form of a promotion explains why presidents are paid significantly more than vice presidents. In one day a Vice-President may be promoted to President of a company and have his pay tripled. Considering piece rates this seems illogical - his output is unlikely to have tripled in one day. But looking at it using tournament theory it seems logical - he has won the tournament and received his prize - presidency.

Tournament theory is an efficient way of labour compensation when quantifying output is difficult or expensive, but ranking workers is easy. It is also effective as it provides goals for workers and incentivises hard work so that they may one day attain one of the coveted positions at the top. An advantage to workers over a piece rate would be that in the event of a natural disaster they would preserve their wage as their output would go down in absolute terms but stay the same relative to their colleagues. This means that in times of disaster workers could maintain their wage.

&lt;ref name="LazearRosen"/&gt;
Benefits of tournament
(+) Motivates workers 
(+) Offers stability during volatile market conditions (reduce shocks)
(+) Selecting workers (observe)
(+) Reduce variability in pay  (commit &amp; credible)
(+) Encourage Long-run behaviour to stay
