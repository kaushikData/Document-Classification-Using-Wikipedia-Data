__NOTOC__
Year '''492 BC''' was a year of the [[Roman calendar|pre-Julian Roman calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Macerinus and Augurinus''' (or, less frequently, '''year 262 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 492 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

}}The '''adventus''' was a ceremony in [[ancient Rome]], in which an [[Roman emperor|emperor]] was formally welcomed into a city either during a progress or after a military campaign, often (but not always) Rome.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1181">The '''American Kitefliers Association''' ('''AKA''') was created in 1964 by Robert M. Ingraham of [[New Mexico]]. Its purpose is to educate the public in the art, history, technology, and practice of building and flying [[kite]]s and advance the joys and values of kiting in all nations. AKA is the largest association of kiters with over 3,000 members in 25 countries.
There are conventions held annually for all club members each year at different venues around the country.

The American Kitefliers Association also regulates competitions and other showy kite events all over the country. Fliers of precision [[stunt kite]]s, which can make 90-degree turns and do tricks, are judged on how well they conform to prescribed flight patterns with many twists and turns.&lt;ref&gt;CONSIDINE, A.

The '''Aston Martin Asia Cup''' (AMAC) is the world's first ever [[Aston Martin]] one make series. All drivers will compete for the AMAC title in identical [[Aston Martin V8 Vantage (2005)|Aston Martin V8 Vantage]] N24 race cars.

The series started in 2008 and consisted of 10 races throughout the Asia Pacific region including China, Japan, Malaysia and Singapore. Each race features a grid of 15 Aston Martin Vantage N24s, a 4.3 litre race-developed evolution of the V8 Vantage.

The AMAC includes a variety of 30-minute sprint races and longer endurance races, some of which support Formula One events in the region, like the [[Singapore Grand Prix]] and the [[Chinese Grand Prix]].

==Race Car==
The V8 Vantage has a V8 engine producing 410&amp;nbsp;bhp and weighs just 1350&amp;nbsp;kg. The 18 AMAC cars have the automated manual Sportshift transmission, and all the cars are equipped with roll cages, safety fuel tanks, race seats and harnesses, and fire extinguisher systems. The cars will be serviced at the Aston Martin Beijing service facility at the city's Goldenport race circuit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astonmartinracing.com/eng/news?a=02df19a0-f937-459b-837d-12d13e71a501 New Aston Martin race series for Asia in 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michelin]] is the sole tyre supplier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astonmartin-asiacup.com/index.html Aston Martin Asia Cup Introduction] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208031955/http://www.astonmartin-asiacup.com/index.html |date=8 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An estimated 24 million people watched the address live on television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Huddleston, Jr.|first1=Tom|title=Here's How Many People Tuned In to Watch Obama's Farewell Address|url=http://fortune.com/2017/01/11/obama-farewell-address-tv-ratings/|accessdate=21 January 2017|work=Fortune|date=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The speech and its transcript are available on the archived version of the Obama Whitehouse website.&lt;ref name="whitehousefarewell"/&gt;

==Background==
{{main|Presidency of Barack Obama}}
Obama served as the first [[African American]] [[President of the United States]] for two terms, first elected in [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008]] and reelected in [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012]]. During his presidency, his administration addressed the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|2007-2008 global financial crisis]] (including a [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|major stimulus package]]), oversaw the passage and implementation of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], partially extended [[Bush tax cuts]], took [[Immigration reform#Obama's executive actions of November 2014|executive action]] on immigration reform, and took [[Clean Power Plan|steps]] to combat [[climate change]] and [[greenhouse gas|carbon emissions]]. Obama also authorized the [[Death of Osama bin Laden|raid]] that killed Osama bin Laden, signed the [[New START]] treaty with [[Russia]], signed the [[Paris Agreement]], and negotiated rapprochements with [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|Iran]] and [[Cuban Thaw|Cuba]]. Democrats controlled both houses of Congress until Republicans won a majority in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in the [[United States elections, 2010|2010 elections]]. Republicans took control of the [[United States Senate|Senate]] after the [[United States elections, 2014|2014 elections]], and Obama continued to grapple with Congressional Republicans over government spending, [[Deferred Action for Parents of Americans|immigration]], [[Merrick Garland Supreme Court nomination|judicial nominations]], and other issues.

In the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]], Obama was ineligible to seek reelection to a third term due to the restrictions of the [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-second Amendment]]. In June 2016, Obama endorsed his former [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], [[Hillary Clinton]], to succeed him as president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Davis|first1=Julie Hirschfeld|last2=Martin|first2=Jonathan|title=Obama Endorses Hillary Clinton, and Urges Democrats to Unite|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/10/us/politics/obama-hillary-clinton-endorsement.html|accessdate=21 January 2017|work=The New York Times|date=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He addressed the [[2016 Democratic National Convention]] on July 27 in support of Clinton as the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party's]] [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016|nominee]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Liptak|first1=Kevin|title=Barack Obama slams Trump, makes appeal for Hillary Clinton|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/27/politics/president-obama-democratic-convention-speech/|accessdate=21 January 2017|work=CNN|date=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continued to campaign for her throughout the 2016 general election campaign season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Phelps|first1=Jordyn|title=Obama's Final Big Role as President: Campaigner in Chief|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/president-obamas-campaign-blitz-hillary-clinton-historic/story?id=43249593|accessdate=21 January 2017|work=ABC News|date=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hillary Clinton would unexpectedly lose the general election to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee [[Donald Trump]] on November 8, after failing to receive enough votes in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]], despite receiving a plurality of the national popular vote. The Democratic Party would no longer control the presidency once Trump was [[United States presidential inauguration|inaugurated]] on January 20, 2017, and they did not have a majority of seats in either chamber of the [[United States Congress]], and in the state legislatures and governorships. President Obama's approval ratings were nearly at 60 percent at the time of his farewell speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dovere|first1=Edward-Isaac|title=Democrats in the Wilderness|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/01/democrats-trump-administration-wilderness-comeback-revival-214650|accessdate=21 January 2017|work=POLITICO Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Edelman|first1=Adam|title=President Obama's final approval rating is 60%, poll shows|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/president-obama-final-approval-rating-60-poll-shows-article-1.2949260|accessdate=22 January 2017|work=NY Daily News|date=18 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tani|first1=Maxwell|title=Obama's approval rating soars as he exits the White House|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/obamas-approval-rating-final-2017-1|accessdate=22 January 2017|work=Business Insider|date=19 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Venue==
In a break with recent tradition, President Obama did not deliver his farewell address at the [[White House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Flood|first1=Rebecca|title=President Barack Obama breaks tradition to deliver farewell speech in home-town|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/752632/president-Barack-Obama-speech-farewell-Trump-Chicago-tradition|accessdate=21 January 2017|work=Express|date=10 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he gave the speech at the [[McCormick Place]] convention center in his home city of [[Chicago]], less than four miles from [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]], where he delivered his [[Barack Obama election victory speech, 2008|2008 election victory speech]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Korte|first1=Gregory|title=Obama's farewell speech: Here's what to expect|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2017/01/10/what-time-is-obama-farewell-speech/96372452/|accessdate=21 January 2017|work=USA TODAY|date=10 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCormick Place is also the same venue where Obama delivered his [[s:Barack Obama's 2012 election victory speech|2012 reelection victory speech]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lee|first1=Kristen|title=President Obama gives victory speech: 'Never been more hopeful about America'|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/president-obama-victory-speech-hopeful-america-article-1.1197895|accessdate=22 January 2017|work=NY Daily News|date=7 November 2012|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The event was open to the public, with free tickets being distributed on a first-come, first-served basis on January 7.&lt;ref name="whfarewell" /&gt;

==Writing the address==

On January 2, 2017, President Obama released a post on the White House blog publicly announcing that he would deliver his farewell address in his hometown of Chicago, and stated that he was "just beginning" to write his remarks and that he was "thinking about them as a chance to say thank you for this amazing journey, to celebrate the ways you've changed this country for the better these past eight years, and to offer some thoughts on where we all go from here."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Obama|first1=Barack|title=My Farewell Address|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2017/01/02/my-farewell-address|website=whitehouse.gov|accessdate=22 January 2017|language=en|date=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the January 6th press briefing, [[White House Press Secretary]] [[Josh Earnest]] said that "the President is interested in delivering a farewell address that's forward-looking"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Korte|first1=Gregory|title=Obama's farewell address will be 'forward-looking,' optimistic|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/01/07/obamas-farewell-address-forward-looking-optimistic/96272082/|accessdate=22 January 2017|work=USA TODAY|date=7 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on January 9 he stated that "there's still a lot of work that needs to be done on the speech.  So the President will be doing a lot of thinking between now and then, between now and 9:00 p.m. Eastern tomorrow, thinking about what he wants to say and what sort of presentation he wants to make to the American public as he enters the last couple of weeks that he has here at the White House."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Briefing by Press Secretary Josh Earnest, 1/9/17|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/09/press-briefing-press-secretary-josh-earnest-1917|website=whitehouse.gov|accessdate=22 January 2017|language=en|date=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The farewell address was written by President Obama, who dictated passages to [[Cody Keenan]], the White House Director of Speechwriting. The President and Keenan went through at least four drafts of the speech. Former White House speechwriter [[Jon Favreau (speechwriter)|Jon Favreau]] and former [[Senior Advisor to the President of the United States|senior advisor]] [[David Axelrod (political consultant)|David Axelrod]] also contributed to the drafting process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Liptak|first1=Kevin|title=Obama offers optimism -- and warnings -- in farewell address|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/10/politics/obama-farewell-address/|accessdate=22 January 2017|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bobby Joe Long''' (born October 14, 1953), also known as '''Robert Joe Long''' and '''Robert Joseph Long''', is an American [[serial killer]] and [[rapist]].&lt;ref name="fdoc"&gt;{{cite web

He released his last victim, Lisa McVey, after raping her for a period of 26 hours. McVey provided information to the police that enabled them to track him down. 

Long is currently serving a prison sentence consisting of 28 life sentences, 4 sentences of 99 years and the death sentence in the United States.  &lt;ref name="hickey"&gt;{{cite book

==Early life==
Long was born on October 14, 1953 in [[Kenova, West Virginia]] to Joe and Louetta Long. He was born with an [[Klinefelter's syndrome|extra X chromosome]], because of which he [[gynaecomastia|grew breasts during puberty]], for which he was severely teased.&lt;ref name="maamodt.edu"&gt;{{cite web |title=Bobby Joe Long - The Classified Ad Rapist |url=http://maamodt.asp.radford.edu/Long,%20Bobby%20Joe.htm |accessdate=August 12, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821131048/http://maamodt.asp.radford.edu/Long%2C%20Bobby%20Joe.htm |archivedate=August 21, 2008 |publisher=Department of Psychology, [[Radford University]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also suffered multiple head injuries as a child.&lt;ref&gt;Giannangelo, Stephen. [https://books.google.com/books?id=rPLpWHyrM-MC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=Bobby+Joe+Long+head+injuries&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=be2K9_kdMT&amp;sig=9NBFD6RBjXgDlEpjvusbY3oOR2g&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=YE-DSoH6CtXFmQf1o4CjDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10#v=onepage&amp;q=Bobby%20Joe%20Long%20head%20injuries&amp;f=false ''The Psychopathology of Serial Murder: A Theory of Violence''.]&lt;/ref&gt;
He had a [[dysfunctional family|dysfunctional]] relationship with his mother; he slept in her bed until he was a teenager, and resented her multiple short-term boyfriends.&lt;ref name="maamodt.edu" /&gt; He married his high school girlfriend in 1974, with whom he had two children before she filed for [[divorce]] in 1980.&lt;ref name="Crime Watch Daily"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Moore |first1=Melissa |title=Married to a Monster: Ex-wife discusses serial killer who raped, killed 10 women |url=https://crimewatchdaily.com/2016/02/22/ex-wife-offers-look-inside-the-mind-of-notorious-serial-killer/ |website=crimewatch |publisher=Telepictures Productions Inc. |accessdate=8 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the Tampa Bay area murders, Long had committed at least 50 [[rape]]s as the "Classified Ad Rapist" in [[Fort Lauderdale]], [[Ocala]], [[Miami]] and [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Dade County]]. Starting in 1981, Long answered [[classified ad]]s for small appliances, and if he found a woman alone at home, he would rape her. He was tried and convicted for rape in 1981 but requested a new trial, which was granted. The charges were later dropped. Before Long killed in Florida, he lived in [[Long Beach, California]], on the 2500 Block of Eucalyptus Avenue, where he rented a room from a woman named Kathy. He dated a 17-year-old girl across the street from his rented room. Long began contacting women through the ''[[Pennysaver|Penny Saver]]'' and other classified ads and when he found a woman alone, he asked to use the bathroom, took out his "rape kit" and brutally raped and robbed the woman. These crimes were never prosecuted by the local California authorities.&lt;ref name="norris"&gt;{{cite book

==Murders==
Long moved to the Tampa area in 1983. [[Hillsborough County, Florida|Hillsborough County]] had been averaging about 30 to 35 homicides per year in the 1980s. Then, in 1984, the murder rate escalated. During one eight-month period, a killer with a unique method of binding, raping, and killing his victims, then dumping them in unusual positions and poses, was averaging a murder every other week. The first victim was discovered in May 1984, when the [[Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office (Florida)|Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office]] (HCSO) was called to a crime scene where the body of a nude woman had been found.&lt;ref name="cooperation"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This began an intensive investigation into the abduction, rape, and murder of at least 10 women in three counties in the Tampa Bay area (Hillsborough, [[Pasco County, Florida|Pasco]], [[Pinellas County, Florida|Pinellas]]) involving the personnel from the HCSO, the [[FBI]], the Tampa Police Department (TPD), the Pasco County Sheriff's Office (PCSO), and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE). The bodies were found usually long after the murder in a state of decomposition, dumped near a rural roadside and dragged into the woods.&lt;ref name="cooperation" /&gt;

===''Modus operandi''===
In 1984, while on [[probation]] for [[assault]], Long began driving around, trawling for victims in areas known for [[prostitution]] and in bars where women were found alone. He claimed his victims approached him, after which he persuaded them to enter his car and took them to an apartment. There he bound his victims with rope and [[Strangling|ligature collar]]s he fashioned using a variety of rope knots, later confessing that he derived [[Sadomasochism|sadistic]] pleasure from the abduction, rape, and brutal murder of his victims. Some he strangled, others he killed by slitting their throats or bludgeoning. The bodies were placed in unique positions or "displayed," for example with their legs splayed five feet apart at odd angles. Of Long's ten known victims, five were identified as sex workers, two as [[exotic dancers]], one was a factory worker, one was a student, and one was of unknown occupation.&lt;ref name="hickey"/&gt;

==Capture==
At the time of his capture, Long was wanted in three Tampa Bay area jurisdictions where investigators had collected [[forensic evidence]], including clothing and carpet fibers, [[semen]], ligature marks, and rope knots.&lt;ref name="hickey"/&gt;

Long was arrested on November 16, 1984, and charged with the [[sexual battery]] and kidnapping of Lisa McVey. Long signed a formal [[Miranda warning|Miranda]] waiver, and consented to questioning. After the detectives procured a confession for the McVey case, their questioning focused on a series of unsolved sexual battery homicides pending in the area. As the detectives began to question Long about the murders, he replied, "I'd rather not answer that." The detectives continued the interrogation, and handed Long photographs of the various murder victims. At this point, Long stated, "The complexion of things sure have changed since you came back into the room. I think I might need an attorney." No attorney was provided, and Long eventually confessed to eight murders in Hillsborough County, and one murder in Pasco County.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Fiber]] evidence analysis by the FBI linked Long's vehicle to most of his victims.&lt;ref name="hickey"/&gt;

==Trial==

The Hillsborough County State Attorney's Office confronted Long with the evidence. The State Attorney and the Public Defender's Office of Hillsborough County reached a [[plea bargain]] for eight of the homicides and the abduction and rape of Lisa McVey. Long pled guilty on September 24, 1985, to all of these crimes, receiving 26 [[life sentence]]s without the possibility of [[parole]] (24 concurrent and two to run consecutively to the first 24) and seven life sentences with the possibility of parole after 25 years. In addition, the State retained the option to seek the [[death penalty]] for the murder of Michelle Simms. In July 1986, the [[penalty phase]] of the Michelle Simms trial was held in Tampa. It lasted one week and again received extensive media attention. Long was found guilty and was sentenced to die in Florida's [[electric chair]].

Although Long confessed to raping and killing women, his confession was thrown out. His trial proceeded straight to the penalty phase, which was possible in the 1980s. In early 1985, he received the death penalty.

Long was convicted and [[appeal]]ed his first degree murder conviction and death sentence for crimes committed in Hillsborough County.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On appeal from the Circuit Court in and for Pasco County, in which Long's death sentence was vacated, his conviction reversed, and his case remanded to the trial court with directions to enter an order of [[acquittal]] for the murder of Virginia Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On February 24, 1999, Long accused the Capital Collateral Regional Council (the state office defending death row inmates in their appeals) of revealing his private letters to a book author, thus violating [[attorney–client privilege]]. He also accused the agency of running a "death pool," betting on the dates on which inmates would be executed, and asked that the agency be removed from his case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =The Morgue Archives: Jan-Feb 1999 | work =www.mayhem.net | publisher = Mayhem.net | date = | url = http://www.mayhem.net/Crime/morg9902.html | accessdate = 4 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; An investigation concluded that these allegations were unfounded. Long's petition for a [[writ of mandamus]] to require Bob Dillinger, the public defender for the Sixth Judicial Circuit, to relinquish possession and control of his file in ''State v. Long,'' was denied.

According to the [[Florida Department of Corrections]], Long has one five-year sentence, four 99-year sentences, 28 life sentences, and one death sentence.&lt;ref name="fdoc"/&gt;

The '''Chiasso financial smuggling case''' began on June 3, 2009 near [[Chiasso, Switzerland]] (near the Swiss/Italian border), when Sezione Operativa Territoriale di Chiasso in collaboration with officers of Italian customs/financial military police ([[Guardia di Finanza]]) detained two suspects (who appeared to be [[Japanese people|Japanese nationals]] in their 50s)&lt;ref name=ftd.de&gt;{{cite web |title=Italien rätselt über 96-Mrd.-Euro-Schmuggel |url=http://www.ftd.de/politik/europa/:Kennedy-Bonds-Italien-r%E4tselt-%FCber-96-Mrd-Euro-Schmuggel/526520.html |date=June 13, 2009 |work=Financial Times Deutschland |accessdate=July 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had attempted to enter Switzerland with a suitcase in their possession with a false bottom containing what at first appeared to be [[United States Treasury security|U.S. Treasury Bonds]] worth $134.5 billion.&lt;ref name=gdf.it&gt;{{cite web|title=Sequestrati a Chinasso titoli USA per novantasei miliardi di euro |url=http://www.gdf.it/GdF__Informa/Notizie_Stampa/AdnKronos/Adnkronos_2009/Adnkronos_Giugno_2009/info-1518911049.html |date=July 6, 2009 |publisher=Guardia di Finanza |accessdate=July 6, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090613034419/http://www.gdf.it/gdf__informa/notizie_stampa/adnkronos/adnkronos_2009/adnkronos_giugno_2009/info-1518911049.html |archivedate=June 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AsiaNews&gt;{{cite web |title=US government securities seized from Japanese nationals, not clear whether real or fake |url=http://www.asianews.it/index.php?l=en&amp;art=15456&amp;size=A |date=June 8, 2009 |work= |publisher=AsiaNews.it |accessdate=July 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jt"&gt;{{cite web |title=2 Japanese carrying $134 bil worth of U.S. bonds detained in Italy |url=http://www.japantoday.com/category/crime/view/2-japanese-carrying-134-bil-worth-of-us-bonds-detained-in-italy |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090725152601/http://www.japantoday.com/category/crime/view/2-japanese-carrying-134-bil-worth-of-us-bonds-detained-in-italy |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 25, 2009 |date=June 11, 2009 |work=Japan Today |accessdate=July 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two possessed 249 U.S. bonds worth $500 million each (among other securities, they also had 10 "Kennedy bonds" denominated at $1 billion each); and the large denominations of the securities, along with accompanying bank documentation was what attracted the Italian police's attention.&lt;ref name=gdf.it/&gt; Large denominations are not available to the general public; only [[nation-state]]s handle such amounts of money.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==Investigation and determination==
Assessment as to the authenticity of the bonds began immediately ([[counterfeiting]] of these securities was suspected). One source reported that the [[Securities and Exchange Commission|U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] had been requested to verify the authenticity of the bonds.&lt;ref name="jt"/&gt; A spokesman for the [[Bureau of Public Debt]] has commented on the matter.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

On June 18, 2009 the ''[[Financial Times]]'' reported that the Italian police and the [[U.S. Secret Service]] had concluded that "the bills and accompanying bank documents were most probably counterfeit, the latest handiwork of the [[Organized crime in Italy|Italian Mafia]]."&lt;ref name=ft.com&gt;{{cite news |title=Mafia blamed for $134bn fake Treasury bills |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/82091ec2-5c2f-11de-aea3-00144feabdc0.html |date=June 18, 2009 |work=Financial Times |access-date=July 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though this information has not been verified by Italian official sources. Mckayla Braden, senior adviser for public affairs at the Bureau of Public Debt at the [[U.S. Treasury Department]] also said that this type of counterfeit bond scam "has been going on for years." Although these bonds, if fake, appear to have been of very high quality. Col. Rodolfo Mecarelli, the provincial commander of the financial police in Como, said that the bonds "are made of filigree paper of excellent quality."&lt;ref name=ftd.de/&gt;

The ''Financial Times'' also reported that the two suspects "had been released" by Italian authorities.  No additional comment or elaboration from the [[Guardia di Finanza]] (Italian financial/customs military police) headquarters in Rome was available. As well, Ed Donovan, a spokesman for the [[United States Secret Service]], has said that the “U.S. Secret Service, which polices counterfeiting of U.S. currency, is assisting Italian authorities in tracing the source of the fake bonds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=UPDATE 1-U.S. Treasury says bonds seized in Italy are fakes |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/companyNewsAndPR/idUSN1946360420090619 |date=June 19, 2009 |work= |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=July 6, 2009 |first=David |last=Lawder}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, Japanese authorities also remained interested in the matter; Takeshi Akamatsu, a press secretary for the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan)|Japanese foreign ministry]], confirmed that the two suspects were carrying Japanese passports and had been detained and questioned by the Guardia di Finanza, but that Tokyo had not been informed of their names or whereabouts during or after their release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=U.S. says smuggled Treasury bonds were fake |url=http://www.gata.org/node/7514 |date=June 21, 2009 |work= |publisher=Gold Anti-Trust Action Committee |accessdate=July 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The motivation or likelihood of passing counterfeit bonds of these types and size is not known.

==Reactions and speculation==
There has been very little in the way of official statements regarding this case, raising concerns about who made them,&lt;ref name=ft.com/&gt; dumping of U.S. debt&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Employees of Japan Finance Ministry arrested in Italy trying to smuggle $134 Billion in U.S. Treasuries in suitcases |url=http://www.turnerradionetwork.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=59:employees-of-japan-finance-ministry-arrested-in-italy-trying-tosmuggle-134-billion-in-us-treasuries-in-suitcases&amp;catid=1:latest-news&amp;Itemid=50 |date=June 19, 2009 |work= |publisher=Turner Radio Network |accessdate=February 21, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Italian interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=$134.5 BILLION worth of US bonds seized from smugglers at Swiss border |url=http://www.boingboing.net/2009/06/14/1345-billion-worth-o.html |date=June 14, 2009 |work= |publisher=Boing Boing |accessdate=July 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other questions include the identities of the Japanese men detained, the reason for their release, the origin of these high quality fake bonds, the U.S. Secret Service investigation, lack of Italian official acknowledgment of fakes and many other questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Bond Saga: It Gets More Odd |url=http://market-ticker.org/archives/1142-The-Bond-Saga-It-Gets-More-Odd.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20090624133353/http://market-ticker.org/archives/1142-The-Bond-Saga-It-Gets-More-Odd.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 24, 2009 |date=June 21, 2009 |work= |publisher=The Market Ticker |accessdate=February 21, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial reactions to the story contemplated the possibility that the bonds were genuine; if the bonds had proven to be genuine, this case would have been regarded as the largest single act of [[smuggling]] (with respect to financial value) in recorded history.&lt;ref name=AsiaNews/&gt; The total value of the counterfeit bonds was estimated at approximately one percent of total [[U.S. GDP]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Country Comparison: National Product |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2001rank.html |date= |work=The World Factbook |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency |accessdate=July 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair would also have been considered the fourth largest creditor to the U.S., ahead of the [[United Kingdom]] and just behind [[Russia]].&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news |title=Is this the death of the dollar? |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/5586543/Is-this-the-death-of-the-dollar.html |date=June 20, 2009 |work=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=July 6, 2009 | location=London | first=Edmund | last=Conway}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well, according to Italian law failing to declare currency above 10,000 euros can be punished by fines of 40%.

Since the confirmation by American officials that the bonds were counterfeit, some reactions have shifted to taking note of a general loss of confidence in [[International finance|international banking and finance]] (in general) and the [[U.S. dollar]] in particular—as noted by a recent downward trend in the [[U.S. Dollar Index]] (and the dollar reaching a new low for 2009 vs. other world currencies on July 28, 2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brown |first=Matthew |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aTaWdIwzI_mw |title=Dollar Touches 2009 Low as Economic View Reduces Safety Demand |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date=July 28, 2009 |accessdate=November 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' commentator Edmund Conway noted that when U.S. Treasury Secretary [[Timothy Geithner]] traveled to [[China]] (in June 2009) and asserted in Beijing that Chinese financial assets denominated in the U.S. dollar "are very safe," it drew laughter from the audience, even though laughter was not Geitner's intent.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt; 

Conway also speculated that this incident may be a sign that "America is on the brink of losing its economic superpower status."&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt;

==Similar Incidents==
On September 18, 2009, a similar incident was reported&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corriere.it/cronache/09_settembre_20/bond_falsi_delfrate_661f9a3e-a5c6-11de-a2a4-00144f02aabc.shtml |title=Il mistero dei bond falsi Miliardi verso la Svizzera - Corriere della Sera |publisher=Corriere.it |date= |accessdate=November 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  by the Italian financial military police [[Guardia di Finanza]], this time involving two (apparently) [[Philippines|Philippine nationals]] smuggling U.S. Treasury bonds (valued at approximately $180 billion) at [[Malpensa Airport]] (the largest airport in [[Milan, Italy]]).  The two were detained and the assessment of this case is on-going.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rassegnastampa.mef.gov.it/mefeconomica/View.aspx?ID=2009091813722922-2 |title=Libero Quotidiano - Filippini con 180 miliardi nel trolley.

The six are under investigation for receiving stolen goods.

On February 17, 2012, it was reported, Italian police seized $6 trillion in counterfeit U.S. bonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financial-crime/9089268/Italian-police-seize-6-trillion-of-fake-US-bonds-in-Switzerland.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Richard | last=Blackden | title=Italian police seize $6 trillion of fake US bonds in Switzerland | date=February 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cyberian Outpost''' was an online vendor of discount computer hardware and software that operated the website outpost.com. After its IPO in 1998, it reached a peak [[market capitalization]] of $1 billion, but, after the bursting of the [[dot-com bubble]], its stock price fell rapidly and the company was acquired by [[Fry's Electronics]] in 2001 for $21 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/24/business/markets-market-place-cyberian-outpost-plunges-toward-abyss-two-suitors-wait.html | title=As Cyberian Outpost plunges toward the abyss, two suitors wait patiently to pick up the pieces | first=LAURIE J. | last=FLYNN | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=July 24, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company received publicity for its controversial advertisements including one in which gerbils were shot out of a cannon, one where wolves attack a high school marching band, and one where children in daycare are being tattooed with "outpost.com" on their foreheads.

==History==
Cyberian Outpost was founded in 1995 by Darryl Peck.&lt;ref name=8K/&gt;

Cyberian Outpost was one of the earliest successful online-only retailers. Unlike many large retailers of the time, the company marketed directly to expert consumers instead of businesses and specialized in hard-to-find Macintosh products in a market saturated with Microsoft-compatible products. Outpost.com marketed its products around the world and offered its website in 11 languages and sold to customers in 140 countries.&lt;ref name=parry&gt;{{cite journal | ssrn=910080 | title=Cyberian Outpost | first=Mark E. | last=Parry  | date=October 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=S1/&gt;

The company expanded rapidly, taking advantage of the booming Internet. Revenue increased from $1.9 million in the year ended February 29, 1996 to $22.7 million in the year ended February 28, 1998.&lt;ref name=S1/&gt;

In 1997, ''[[Money Magazine]]'' rated the site as "Best Site for Computer Equipment".&lt;ref name=parry/&gt;&lt;ref name=S1&gt;[http://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=706243 CYBERIAN OUTPOST, INC. Form S-1]&lt;/ref&gt; Outpost.com raised $2.7 million in venture capital in 1997, at which point the site had 25,000 visitors per day and 1.3 million customers.&lt;ref name=kentschool/&gt; The company secured another $22 million in financing in 1998,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cyberian-outpost-initiates-ceo-search-to-continue-momentum-seeks-executive-to-lead-next-phase-of-growth-and-corporate-development-74340382.html | title=Cyberian Outpost Initiates CEO Search to Continue Momentum; Seeks Executive to Lead Next Phase of Growth and Corporate Development | publisher=[[PRNewswire]] | date=May 3, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; and raised another $70 million from its [[initial public offering]].&lt;ref name=kentschool/&gt; Outpost.com opened a warehouse in Ohio that could guarantee next-morning domestic delivery and worldwide delivery within 48 hours.&lt;ref name=parry/&gt;

After the [[dot-com bubble]] burst, the company fell on hard times. In 2001, the company entered into a merger agreement with [[PC Connection]] but then terminated that merger agreement and the company was sold to [[Fry's Electronics]] for $21 million including the repayment of $13 million in debt from PC Connection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/frys-electronics-inc-to-acquire-cyberian-outpost-inc-71899852.html | title=Fry's Electronics, Inc. to Acquire Cyberian Outpost, Inc. | publisher=[[PRNewswire]] | date=August 31, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cyberian-outpost-inc-and-pc-connection-inc-terminate-merger-71924337.html | title=Cyberian Outpost, Inc. and PC Connection, Inc.

==Marketing==
Outpost.com forged marketing partnerships with major [[Internet portal]]s, such as [[AOL]], [[CNet]], and [[Lycos]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://corporate.findlaw.com/contracts/operations/agreement-lycos-bertelsmann-gmbh-and-cyberian-outpost-inc.html/ Agreement - Lycos-Bertelsmann GmbH. and Cyberian Outpost Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt; in which Outpost.com was featured on these popular websites.&lt;ref name=S1/&gt;

Outpost.com hired Cliff Freeman to produce TV ads, whose agency had created the "Pizza Pizza" campaign for [[Little Caesars]] and the "Where's the Beef?" campaigns for [[Wendy's International]].&lt;ref name=parry/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://adage.com/article/agency-news/advertising-agency-cliff-freeman-slips-history-books/140123/ | title=Where's the Shop? Cliff Freeman Slips Into History Books | first=Kunur | last=Patel | publisher=[[Ad Age]] | date=November 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outpost.com adopted a zealous and controversial marketing program which included a Super Bowl ad in which fake gerbils were shot out of a cannon at the company logo,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzbMcsrK-tw Gerbils shot out of a cannon]&lt;/ref&gt; followed later by an ad that featured a high school marching band being attacked by a pack of ravenous wolves,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cmT8M_67ow Wolves attack a high school marching band]&lt;/ref&gt; and another ad portraying pre-school toddlers being tattooed with 'Outpost.com' across their foreheads.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SjMjZQGoHw Children in Daycare being tattooed with "outpost.com" on their foreheads]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1848">The '''Duke City Shootout''' is the world's first and longest-running script-to-screen movie-making contest. The Shootout and the 48 Hour Film Project were cited in [[MovieMaker Magazine]] &lt;ref&gt;"Future of Moviemaking 2007" issue, page 70&lt;/ref&gt; as "pioneers of the marathon movie-making competition." The [[competition]] was begun in 2000 in [[Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]], under the name ''Flicks on 66'', and briefly changed to ''DigiFest Southwest'', before settling on the current name.

Each year, the Shootout conducts an international competition for short [[Screenplay|scripts]], 12 minutes or shorter, and selects seven to produce during the competition, held annually in July. Selected competitors are brought to [[Albuquerque]] and have one week to shoot, edit and premiere their finished movie.

The festival provides equipment, crews, cast, locations, editing facilities, mentors and everything necessary for the competitors to complete their movies. The movies are screened before a live audience on the final night of the event.

The Shootout has also incorporated other movie-making contests since its inception. In 2006 and 2007, it partnered with the [[48 Hour Film Project]] and hosted its own [[MiniCini]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.redorbit.com/news/technology/1029927/ 8yearold_girl_becomes_a_model_filmmaker/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; to help aspiring filmmakers create nearly 50 additional shorts during the week.

Although loss of life and property in Myanmar was suspected to be higher than official reports suggest, loss of life was not as high as in neighbouring [[Thailand]] due to various factors, most significantly the numerous islands off the coast of Myanmar which served to dissipate the force of the tsunami, a rocky shoreline, and the position of the coastline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/asiapcf/01/05/tsunami.myanmar/index.html Rocky shoreline helped Myanmar].

January 5, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Also contributing is the fact that it is less developed than neighboring Thailand; international disapproval of the [[State Peace and Development Council|Burmese military regime]] has prevented the country from building a successful [[tourism]] industry.

A [[Yangon]]-based representative from the [[United Nations]] stated, "Conjecture fuelled by the experiences in neighbouring countries created a major and dangerous disconnect with reality".

'''Elmer John Gedeon''' (April 15, 1917 – April 20, 1944) was a professional baseball player, appearing in several games for the [[Washington Senators (1901–60)|Washington Senators]] in {{mlby|1939}}.  Gedeon and [[Harry O'Neill (catcher)|Harry O'Neill]] were the only two [[Major League Baseball]] players killed during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=Weintraub /&gt; Gedeon flew several missions in the [[European Theater of Operations]] as an officer of the [[United States Army Air Forces]] before being shot down over France.

During college at the [[University of Michigan]], Gedeon became an [[All-American]] in [[track and field]], and earned [[varsity letter]]s in both [[American football|football]] and [[baseball]]. He tied a [[world record]] in the high [[Hurdling|hurdles]] in 1938.  After graduating, Gedeon had a stint in Major League Baseball as an [[outfielder]] for the [[Washington Senators (1901–60)|Washington Senators]].  Gedeon spent most of the 1939 and 1940 baseball seasons in the minor leagues, but he was called up to the Senators in September 1939.

Gedeon's baseball career was cut short when he was [[military draft|drafted]] by the [[United States Army]] in early 1941.  He trained as a [[bomber]] pilot, and was decorated for bravery after his plane crashed on a training flight in 1942.  He later served in combat, and was shot down and killed while [[Aviator|piloting]] a [[B-26 Marauder|B-26 bomber]] on a mission over France in April 1944.

== Growing up in Cleveland ==
Born in [[Cleveland]], Gedeon was a star athlete at Cleveland's [[West High School (Cleveland)|West High School]], where he was a member of the class of 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CPDB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0F8035370FB7CEAF&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=Modell Says Browns Will Return To Top|accessdate=2008-12-23|date=1991-11-18|agency=[[Newsbank]]|work=[[The Plain Dealer]]|author=Heaton, Chuck}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CPDB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0F80D09024FE94DD&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=Missing Plaque A Part of History|accessdate=2008-12-23|date=1998-09-24|agency=[[Newsbank]]|work=[[The Plain Dealer]]|author=Dirck, Joe}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a {{height|ft=6|in=4}} athlete who excelled in American football, baseball, and [[track and field]]. While [[ice skating]] in [[Old Brooklyn|Brookside Park]] in Cleveland as a youth, the ice gave way and Gedeon's cousin plunged through up to his neck.  The cousin later recalled:  "Elmer slid across the ice on his belly and pulled me out."&lt;ref name=UMASPSWWII/&gt;  Gedeon's uncle, [[Joe Gedeon]], was a [[Major League Baseball]] player who was implicated in the [[Black Sox Scandal|Chicago Black Sox scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bioproj.sabr.org/bioproj.cfm?a=v&amp;v=l&amp;pid=4991&amp;bid=238|accessdate=2007-12-07|title=Joe Gedeon|author=Swaine, Rick|publisher=The Society for American Baseball Research (SABR) &amp; The Respective Authors}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gedeon's [[surname]] was common in Cleveland, because many people from [[Sudetenland]], where it was common, settled in Cleveland.&lt;ref name=RGeMDBldiW/&gt;  The phonebook listed numerous Gedeons for biographical research.  One finding was that Gedeon's widow, who was named Laura, later moved to Florida.&lt;ref name=RGeMDBldiW/&gt; Another was that his third cousin Charlotte Gedeon said Elmer carried her grandmother's [[casket]] during a funeral.&lt;ref name=RGeMDBldiW/&gt;

In 1937, a feature article on the Michigan team noted that, in addition to his abilities as an end, "Gedeon can pass and punt, and can run faster than any one on the squad."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Stauter, George|title=Vets, Not Sophs, Showing Best Wares Among Wolves|work=[[The Post-Crescent]]|date=1937-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;    In 1938, Gedeon played [[End (American football)|end]] in Coach [[Fritz Crisler]]'s first season as Michigan's football coach.  That was the year that Coach Crisler introduced the "[[winged football helmet]]" at Michigan.  Team [[Captain (sports)|captain]] Fred Janke recalled Gedeon was "a tall, skinny guy", at {{convert|6|ft|4|in|m|2}} and {{convert|196|lb|kg st}}.&lt;ref name=UMASPSWWII/&gt; "A rather serious kid. He could kick quite well. They used to pull him back in serious situations and let him [[Punt (gridiron football)|punt]] the ball, because he could punt it a mile."&lt;ref name=UMASPSWWII/&gt;

Gedeon signed with the [[Washington Senators (1901–60)|Washington Senators]] after graduating in the summer of 1939.&lt;ref name=GBEGSABR/&gt; He chose to sign with the Senators over a possible appearance as a member of the USA's track team in the [[1940 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref name=RGeMDBldiW/&gt; Gedeon was quite a prospect; [[Clark Griffith]], president of the Senators, mentioned Gedeon to ''[[The Sporting News]]'' on June 15, when talking about exciting new players: "We've got ... a youngster from the University of Michigan named Gedeon."&lt;ref name=BIW/&gt; Gedeon was initially assigned to a [[minor league baseball]] team in [[Orlando, Florida]] where he played in 67 games in 1939.&lt;ref name=GBEGSABR/&gt;&lt;ref name=RWWIIA&gt;{{cite news|author=Morris, R.|title=Remembering World War II airmen: Website remembers baseball players killed in World War Two|publisher=Untold Valor|date=2007-06-24|url=http://untoldvalor.blogspot.com/2007/06/website-remembers-baseball-players.html|accessdate=2007-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-September, he was called up to the major leagues where he appeared in five games as an outfielder with three hits, one run and one RBI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Elmer Gedeon Major League Baseball Career Statistics|publisher=BR.com|date=2007-10-28|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/g/gedeoel01.shtml|accessdate=2007-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; His three hits came in a 10–9 win against the [[Cleveland Indians]] on September 19 as the starting [[centerfielder]]. In his five major league games, he played four games in center field and one in [[right field]].&lt;ref name=BIW/&gt;

In 1940, Gedeon attended spring training with the Senators in Orlando, seeking a spot in the outfield or first base. In February 1940, newspapers ran a wire service photograph of Gedeon hurdling over Senators first baseman [[Jimmy Wasdell]], supposedly "by way of warming up".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hurdler To Try Majors|work=The News-Palladium (Benton Harbor, Mich.)|date=1940-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; returned to the minor leagues where he played for the [[Charlotte Hornets (baseball)|Charlotte Hornets]] (in the [[Piedmont League]]) and hit .271 in 131 games.&lt;ref name=GBEGSABR/&gt;&lt;ref name=RWWIIA/&gt;  He was again recalled in September, but he made no appearances in any games.&lt;ref name=BIW/&gt; It appeared 1941 would see Gedeon moving to play more minor league baseball for either Greenville or Springfield. In the interim Gedeon served as an assistant football coach at Michigan.&lt;ref name=BIW/&gt;

== Military service and death in World War II ==
Gedeon was drafted into the military in January 1941, and reported to the Army instead of spring training.&lt;ref name=RWWIIA/&gt;  He was inducted at [[Fort Thomas, Kentucky]] and reported to the Cavalry Replacement Center at [[Fort Riley]] on March 18.  He immediately became an acting [[Corporal#United States|corporal]] of Troop B of the First Squadron for the thirteen-week training program. The Bentley Historical Library at the University of Michigan owns a copy of an April 1941 [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] newsletter with a note from Gedeon. "As you probably know by this time", he wrote to his [[Phi Gamma Delta]] brothers, "Old Ged has been drafted."&lt;ref name=UMASPSWWII/&gt;  On being assigned to the cavalry, Gedeon joked in the letter to his fraternity that "the only horse I ever saw in my life was the one the milkman used."&lt;ref name=UMASPSWWII/&gt;

On October 22, 1941, Gedeon was accepted into pilot training despite his size and transferred to the [[United States Army Air Forces]], earning his [[pilot's wings]] and a commission as a [[second lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]] at [[Williams Air Force Base|Williams Field, Arizona]] in May 1942.&lt;ref name="bedseam"/&gt;  He undertook twin-engined bomber training with the [[21st Operations Group|21st Bomb Group]] at [[MacDill Field]] in [[Tampa, Florida]].&lt;ref name=BIW/&gt; Gedeon's usual duties were to aid in European mission planning from a desk.&lt;ref name=TWDNR&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/26/sports/baseball/remembering-the-major-leaguers-who-died-in-world-war-ii.html|title=Two Who Did Not Return|accessdate=2013-05-26|date=2013-05-26|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Weintraub, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 9, 1942, Gedeon was flying as the [[navigator]] in a [[B-25]] that crashed in the middle of a swamp on take off from the municipal airport at [[Raleigh, North Carolina]].&lt;ref name=UMASPSWWII/&gt;&lt;ref name=Crash&gt;{{cite news|title=Athlete Hurt in Crash of Bomber|work=The News-Palladium (Benton Harbor, Mich.)|date=1942-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gedeon crawled from the burning bomber, and despite burns and three broken ribs, he went back into the wreckage, rescuing a crewmate, Corporal John R.

"I'll be back in baseball after the war", he had said on his last [[Leave (military)|leave]] before going overseas.&lt;ref name=KUPERFT&gt;{{cite news|author=Kuper, Simon |title=Stars saved from ultimate pitched battle |work=[[Financial Times]] |date=2005-05-07 |url=http://hnn.us/readcomment.php?id=60366&amp;bheaders=1 |accessdate=2007-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060527202059/http://hnn.us/readcomment.php?id=60366&amp;bheaders=1 |archivedate=May 27, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gedeon's cousin recalled: "The last time I saw him, he told me, 'I had my accident. It's going to be good flying from now on.' He said he had used up his bad luck."&lt;ref name=UMASPSWWII/&gt; In February 1943, the [[Associated Press]] ran a feature story about Gedeon's war service under the headline: "Gedeon Will Return to Baseball If War Doesn’t Last Too Long."&lt;ref name=GWRtGIWDLTL&gt;{{cite news|title=Gedeon Will Return to Baseball If War Doesn’t Last Too Long|work=The Times Recorder (Zanesville, Ohio)|date=1943-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gedeon was quoted in the article as saying "he hopes to pick up after the war where he left off."  He added that "it's a matter of time."  "If the war ends before I’m past the playing age I’ll return to the game.  If I’m too old, I’ll do something else."&lt;ref name=GWRtGIWDLTL/&gt;

[[File:394bg-boreham-2.jpg|thumb|B-26 Marauder of the 394th Bomb Group at RAF Boreham.]]
In July 1943, Gedeon was among personnel from the 21st BG that became the cadre of the [[586th Flight Test Squadron|586th Bomb Squadron]], [[394th Bombardment Group]] [[United States Army Air Forces]], formed to train with Martin [[B-26 Marauder]]s. At [[Ardmore Air Force Base|Ardmore Army Air Field]], [[Oklahoma]], he participated in group operational training in preparation for combat.&lt;ref name="bedseam"/&gt; In February 1944, the group was sent to [[RAF Boreham]], England, to become part of the [[Ninth Air Force]].  Gedeon was assigned as Squadron Operations Officer and began flying combat missions in Europe.&lt;ref name=BIW&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballinwartime.com/player_biographies/gedeon_elmer.htm|title=Elmer Gedeon|accessdate=2007-12-07|publisher=Gary Bedingfield (Baseball in Wartime)|date=2007-05-19|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080407224822/http://www.garybed.co.uk/player_biographies/gedeon_elmer.htm |archivedate = April 7, 2008|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His first mission was to attack an airfield at [[Beaumont-le-Roger]], France, on March 23, 1944.

On April 20, 1944, Gedeon piloted one of 36 B-26's that left Boreham in the late afternoon to attack a [[V-1 (flying bomb)|V-1 "buzz bomb"]] site being constructed at [[Esquerdes]], a village in the [[Pas-de-Calais]] near [[Saint-Omer]]. Led by Capt. [[Darrell Lindsey]], it was the group's thirteenth mission.&lt;ref name=GBEGSABR/&gt; Attacking after dusk from 12,000 feet, the group encountered intense and accurate anti-aircraft fire, and Gedeon's plane was hit by [[flak]] below the cockpit just after bombing.  Gedeon's co-pilot, his clothes on fire, was able to [[parachute]] from the bomber as it plunged towards the ground, but Gedeon and five other crew members were killed.&lt;ref name=RWWIIA/&gt;&lt;ref name="bedseam"&gt;{{cite web | last =Bedingfield| first =Gary| authorlink = | year =2010 | url= http://www.seamheads.com/2010/07/13/elmer-gedeon-a-true-hero-of-world-war-ii/|title = Elmer Gedeon: A True Hero of World War II| work =  | publisher = seamheads.com| accessdate= 2011-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Gedeon was initially reported as missing in action and it was not until May 1945 that his family received word that his grave had been located in a small British army cemetery at [[Saint-Pol-sur-Ternoise|Saint-Pol]], France.&lt;ref name=RWWIIA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Painting, Harry|title=In This Corner By Harry Painting|work=The Lethbridge Herald|location=England|date=1945-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Gedeon's body was later returned to the United States, and he was buried at [[Arlington National Cemetery]].&lt;ref name=RWWIIA/&gt;

'''Facebook F8''' (pronounced "''eff eight''") is a mostly-annual conference held by [[Facebook]], intended for developers and entrepreneurs who build products and services around the website. It is hosted in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], [[California]], previously in [[San Francisco]] (until 2016) and now in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], in [[Silicon Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/f8?sk=app_110713442293217|title=f8 - In Review: f8 2010|last=|first=|date=|publisher=Facebook|url-access=registration|accessdate=July 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Previous events have started with a keynote speech by Facebook founder [[Mark Zuckerberg]], followed by various breakout sessions concentrating on specific topics. Facebook has often introduced new features, and made new announcements, at the conference.

The "F8" name comes from Facebook's tradition of 8 hour [[hackathon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/2010/04/21/facebook-pushes-to-make-the-web-more-instantly-social/|title=Facebook pushes to make the Web more ‘instantly social’ – The Mercury News|access-date=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scheduling of F8 has been somewhat erratic. No conferences were held in 2009, 2012 or 2013, and the date for the 2011 conference was announced late in the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/04/24/yes-facebook-developers-there-will-be-an-f8-this-year/|first=Alexia|last=Tsotsis|title=

[[File:Msn iloo.jpg|thumb|alt=A 3D diagram of the proposed iLoo showing a blue, cuboid-shaped toilet cubical with a lavatory situated to the right. A computer keyboard and plasma screen are positioned opposite the toilet bowl, and a sink is in the centre. On top of the cubical is a wireless aerial with demonstrative waves emanating from it. Microsoft's MSN branding is in the left-hand corner of the diagram. |The iLoo as depicted by MSN UK and distributed by news providers]]
The '''iLoo''' (short for '''[[Internet]] [[toilet|loo]]''') was a cancelled [[Microsoft]] project to develop a [[Wi-Fi]] [[Internet]]-enabled [[portable toilet]]. The iLoo, which was to debut at British summer festivals, was described as being a [[portable toilet]] with wireless broadband Internet, an adjustable plasma screen, a membrane wireless keyboard, a six-channel speaker system, and toilet paper embossed with popular [[URL|web site addresses]]. The iLoo was also to have an extra screen and keyboard on the outside, and was to be guarded. It was intended as the next in a series of successful initiatives by MSN UK which sought to introduce the internet in unusual locations, including MSN Street, MSN Park Bench and MSN Deckchair.

The project was announced by [[MSN|MSN UK]] on April 30, 2003, and was widely ridiculed before being declared a hoax by Microsoft on May 12. On May 13, another Microsoft press release stated that although the project had not been a hoax, it had been cancelled because it would do little to promote the MSN brand. There has since been speculation as to whether the project was cancelled for fear of being sued by Andrew Cubitt, who had invented the similarly named product "i-Loo". The iLoo was described as a public relations "debacle" by ''Online Journalism Review''.&lt;ref name="ojr"/&gt;

==Description==
The iLoo was designed to be a [[Wi-Fi]] [[Internet]]-enabled [[portable toilet]] that would allow users to surf the internet while using the loo.&lt;ref name="apr30pr"/&gt; Internally, the facility would have a broadband connection via wireless [[802.11b]], a wireless waterproof keyboard, a swivel [[plasma screen]] running [[Windows XP Professional]], a 6-channel surround-sound system beneath the sink, toilet paper embossed with popular URLs, and a suction toilet.&lt;ref name="apr30pr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cnetpotty"&gt;{{cite news |title=Sit and surf: MSN UK tests portable potty|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1041_3-999509.html |first=Joe |last=Wilcox |date=May 2, 2003 |publisher=CNET |accessdate=March 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Externally, the facility would feature an MSN logo and have a "[[Hotmail]] station" with an additional plasma screen and keyboard for waiting consumers.&lt;ref name="cnetpotty"/&gt; A security guard was to be stationed near the unit to ensure that it was being properly used and to prevent the unit from being stolen.&lt;ref name="cnetpotty"/&gt; The iLoo was to debut "at a majority of the summer season festivals".&lt;ref name="apr30pr"/&gt; The iLoo was to be deployed only in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Doing the loo log on |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/334224561.html?FMT=ABS|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=May 8, 2003}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|style="text-align: left;"|The internet's so much a part of  everyday life now that surfing on the loo was the next natural step.

The project was announced on April 30, 2003 in press release by [[MSN]] UK, MSN's British subsidiary, as part of a "series of MSN.co.uk initiatives which look at the changing nature of how we use the web as it constantly evolves".&lt;ref name="apr30pr"&gt;{{cite press release |title=MSN Launches World's First 'Internet Loo':New WWW.C Offers Convenience Surfing Relief to Festival-goers this Summer |url=http://www.microsoft.com/uk/press/content/presscentre/releases/2003/05/PR03050.asp |publisher=Microsoft |date=April 30, 2003 |accessdate=March 1, 2011 |archivedate=May 11, 2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030511170309/http://www.microsoft.com/uk/press/content/presscentre/releases/2003/05/PR03050.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; The press release stated that:

In time for the summer festival season, MSN is in the process of converting a portable loo to create a unique experience for surfers looking for an alternative to the bog-standard festival loo experience. Users will be able to sit down, undock a wireless keyboard and conveniently access the first ever [[water closet|WWW.C.]]&lt;ref name="apr30pr"/&gt;}}

The press release also stated that "MSN is also in talks with toilet paper manufacturers to produce special web paper for those in need of URL inspiration".&lt;ref name="apr30pr"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Who needs an online outhouse?|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/marionstar/access/1822603141.html?FMT=ABS|date=May 13, 2003|work=Marion Star|location=Marion, Ohio|accessdate=2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="the age"/&gt;

|style="text-align: left;"|MSN is really working on building a prototype for the Summer festivals, perhaps Glastonbury ...

On May 13, 2003, Microsoft retracted the denial, stating that the iLoo had been a legitimate demonstration project that was to be released in Britain for summer music festivals, but had been terminated by Microsoft executives in [[Redmond, Washington]] who believed the iLoo was inappropriate&lt;ref name="comeclean"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eweek buzz"&gt;{{cite journal |date=May 19, 2003|title=The Buzz |journal=EWeek |volume=20 |issue=20 |pages=21 |issn=1530-6283 |url=http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Midmarket/The-Buzz-May-19-2003/ |accessdate=February 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the final decision made by MSN senior vice president David Cole.

|style="text-align: left;"|Reading in the loo, or the bog, is a traditional English pastime. We've all seen the magazine racks, loo paper with jokes and cartoons on the walls in toilets up and down the land. You've got to hand it to the creative—and uniquely English—minds at Microsoft.

==i-Loo controversy==
After reading an article about the iLoo, '''Andrew Cubitt''', inventor of the similarly named i-Loo, wrote to ''[[The Inquirer]]'' stating that iLoo "sounds remarkably similar&amp;nbsp;... it now seems that the clever people at Microsoft have cottoned onto the idea and even call it the i-Loo, the same as mine!"&lt;ref name="inq1"/&gt; Cubitt went on to say that "mine did everything that the Microsoft one is meant to do, but additionally printed information on toilet paper and didn't use a keyboard for the interface due to hygiene reasons".&lt;ref name="Inquire2"/&gt; The i-Loo was prototyped by Cubitt as part of his thesis for his 2001 university degree in Product Design and Engineering at [[Brunel University]]. In an interview with ''The Inquirer'', he noted "As it was designed at the university, they own the partial rights to the product so they will be watching the Microsoft 'invention' very closely."&lt;ref name="Inquire2"&gt;{{cite news|title=Did Microsoft "borrow" the iLoo concept?: Strange case of "Microsoft's" i-Loo continues |url=http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1049073/did-microsoft-borrow-the-iloo-concept |first=Adamson |last=Rust |date= May 12, 2003 |work=[[The Inquirer]] |publisher= Incisive Media |accessdate= February 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Computer chip in the old chopping block |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/04/19/1050172799465.html |work=The Sun-Herald |location=Sydney |accessdate= February 28, 2011 |date=April 20, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microsoft never formally commented on Cubitt's allegations and instead initially stated the iLoo was an April's fool joke.&lt;ref name="Inquirefool"&gt;{{cite news |title=Microsoft's iLoo was April Fool's joke |url=http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1041723/microsofts--iloo-was-april-fools--joke |first=Mike |last=Magee|date= May 13, 2003 |work=[[The Inquirer]] |publisher= Incisive Media |accessdate=February 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Cubitt questioned whether this was "a very calculated ploy to destroy competition in its early stages, or is admitting they don't even know what time of the month it is less embarrassing and ridding them of a potentially expensive situation!"&lt;ref name="Inquirefool"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Inquire4"&gt;{{cite news|title=Real iLoo inventor hits out at Microsoft "slur": Letter Inventor's idea down the pan |url=http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1013936/real-iloo-inventor-hits-out-at-microsoft-slur |first=Andrew |last=Cubitt |date= May 13, 2003 |work=[[The Inquirer]] |publisher= Incisive Media |accessdate=February 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cubitt went on to state that "as they have now discredited my idea as a joke, I will never be able to produce the idea" and as such was "consulting my law books now on defamatory statements".&lt;ref name="Inquire4"/&gt; Neither Cubitt, nor [[Brunel University]] have taken public legal action against Microsoft pertaining to the i-Loo.

The i-Loo was described as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The i-Loo internet toilet roll browser is a novel and unique product designed to make best use of the time you spend on the loo!  The product allows you to search the internet whilst sitting on the toilet and print out any web pages you are interested in on your toilet paper. i-Loo brings a whole new meaning to the word downloading. The unit is fixed in front of a toilet on the cubical [''sic''] wall.  The product provides up to date information about new products, daily news and lottery results through an easy to navigate software package.  Normal operation of the toilet and paper dispenser is evident.&lt;ref name="i-loo"&gt;{{Cite web |title=i-loo |url=http://www.nmabathrooms.co.uk/info/iloo.htm |first=Andrew |last=Cubitt |accessdate=February 28, 2011 |publisher=mabathrooms.co.uk |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111116101630/http://www.nmabathrooms.co.uk/info/iloo.htm |archive-date=2011-11-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The i-Loo internet toilet roll browser was featured at the 2003 ''Daily Mail'' Ideal Home Show as part of the Future Concepts exhibition in [[Earls Court]], London, where it was nominated for the MFI Bright Sparks 2003 awards.&lt;ref name="i-loo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Inventor rocked by MSN's iLoo hoax |url=http://www.webuser.co.uk/news/top-stories/379950/inventor-rocked-by-msn-s-iloo-hoax |first=Claire |last=Woffenden |date= May 13, 2003|publisher=[[Webuser]] |accessdate=February 28, 2011}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Web goes down the toilet |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/2917739.stm |date=April 5, 2003 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=February 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The i-Loo, which was sponsored by [[Epson]] Printers, received significant press coverage, and was featured on [[GMTV]] as well as various radio shows.&lt;ref name="i-loo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=City diary |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2003/apr/08/8 |first=Richard |last=Adams |date=April 8, 2003 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=February 28, 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="timeoff"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Susan |first=Maushart|date=May 3, 2003 |title=Time off in loo|journal=Australian Magazine|pages=42|quote=The release (if that's the right word for it) of Cubitt's Internet toilet roll browser - a cubicle-mounted unit providing up-to-the-minute news and information that can be printed off on a standard toilet roll - made a huge media splash.

'''Infest''' (originally stylised as '''InFest''') is an annual three-day music festival held at the [[University of Bradford Union]] in the United Kingdom, featuring [[alternative electronic]] music acts from genres including [[industrial music|industrial]], [[electronic body music|EBM]], [[futurepop]], [[synthpop]] and [[power noise]]. The event usually takes place on the August [[bank holiday]] weekend.

==History==
===Background===
InFest was born in early 1998 through the efforts of three students of the [[University of Bradford]] - Gareth 'Gadge' Harvey, Chris 'Crusty' Molyneux, and Max 'Maxi Slag' - and the [[University of Bradford Union|Students' Union]] Entertainments Manager, Floyd Peltier. The concept of the festival was originally envisioned as a one-day event for local [[Gothic rock|goth]] bands in [[West Yorkshire]], but the crew were able to also onboard much bigger acts, such as [[gothic rock|gothic]]/[[deathrock]] band [[Alien Sex Fiend]]. The student organisers were already fans of the [[Whitby Gothic Weekend]] and took the idea for Infest to the [[Whitby]] festival-goers and traders to gauge how popular the show might be. The response was positive and the first Infest festival was confirmed as 14 and 15 August 1998.

The following year (1999), the festival paid more attention towards the electronic side of the goth and industrial scene by booking [[Apoptygma Berzerk]] for their first UK show.

===Reinvention===
By 2000, the University of Bradford's Students' Union felt that they couldn't carry the costs of the festival any longer. However, an [[independent music|independent]] goth/industrial [[promoter (entertainment)|promoter]] and DJ named Mark 'Gus' Guy (former drummer with the Indie band [[Kerosene (band)|Kerosene]]), who had been advising Molyneux during the show's early years, stepped in to fill the void. As a result of the heavy involvement with Guy and his [[Terminal Productions]] company, Infest took the form it is recognised as today: the festival's theme has moved from goth/industrial [[crossover (music)|crossover]] to alternative electronic, with a greater emphasis on [[power noise]], futurepop, [[synthpop]] and [[electronic body music]]. However, occasionally more [[darkwave]]-style [[Gothic rock|goth]] bands do still appear on the line-up.

The stylisation of the name had changed in 2003 to be "Infest", and from this time has grown significant international recognition. The show continues to provide a market for traders, which helps to bring the music and the lifestyle of the show's fans together. There is also a full festival program where [[nightclubs]], DJs, [[band (music)|bands]] and businesses can make their voices heard. Infest has been supported by a number of electronic [[record label]]s, notably [[Ant-Zen]], Hands Productions, now-defunct [[online]] music store [[Music Non Stop]], Storming the Base (part of the record label [[Artoffact Records]]). Support outside the scene has also come from software publisher [[Ableton]], and drink manufacturers [[Jägermeister]] and [[A.G._Barr|Barr]].

In July 2013, the festival organisers announced that "it is highly unlikely that there will be an Infest in 2014";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Infest 2014, Official Infest Homepage|url=http://www.infestuk.com/infest-2014/|accessdate=29 July 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907025935/http://www.infestuk.com/infest-2014/|archivedate=7 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but following "an avalanche of messages of support" the organisers have decided to "throw caution to the wind and go ahead with Infest in 2014 (The reason for announcing that infest 2014 was highly unlikely was due to AltFest being proposed to occur a couple of weeks before Infest in 2014. In the end Altfest was canceled due to lack of ticket sales and financial insecurity for the viability of a new big festival that had no history on the alternative music scene)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Confirmed: Infest 2014 Will Go Ahead, Official Infest Homepage|url=http://www.infestuk.com/confirmed-infest-2014-will-go-ahead/|accessdate=9 September 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130909184011/http://www.infestuk.com/confirmed-infest-2014-will-go-ahead/|archivedate=9 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Today===
Today, Guy has a small team of people at his side, including Molyneux (the remaining member of the founding team), along with a crew team that includes volunteers.

The festival celebrated their 20th anniversary in 2018, adding an extra day that year for the occasion.

'''International Dance Day''' is a global celebration of dance, created by the Dance Committee of the [[International Theatre Institute]] (ITI), the main partner for the performing arts of [[UNESCO]]. The event takes place every year on 29th April, the anniversary of the birth of [[Jean-Georges Noverre]] (1727-1810), the creator of modern ballet. The day strives to encourage participation and education in dance through events and festivals held on the date all over the world. [[UNESCO]] formally recognize ITI to be the creators and organizers of the event&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.international-dance-day.org/pdfs/ADG_message_idd_2015.pdf|title=Dance Day|archivedate=2015-04-29|}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== About ==
Every year, since its creation in 1982, an outstanding dance personality is selected to write a message for International Dance Day. ITI also create a flagship event in a selected host city, at which there are dance performances, educational workshops, humanitarian projects and speeches made by ambassadors, dignitaries, dance personalities and the selected Message Author for that year &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.international-dance-day.org/internationaldanceday.html|title=Dance Day|archivedate=2018-03-14|}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The day is a celebration day for those who can see the value and importance of the art form [[dance]], and acts as a wake-up-call for governments, politicians and institutions which have not yet recognised its value to the people.

== Event ==
To mark International Dance Day each year, on the 29 April, the International Theatre Institute invites its members along with dancers, choreographers, dance students and enthusiasts to join them in a Gala Celebration.

The Gala Celebration takes place in a chosen host city decided on by the Executive Council of the International Theatre Institute – for instance in 2017 it was held in [[Shanghai]], [[China]], and in 2018 it will be held in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.international-dance-day.org/mainevent.html/|title=Main Event|date=March 13, 2017|website=International Dance Day|publisher=Futura Communications|access-date=March 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The programme of the Gala Event can vary, but usually consists of top-quality dance performances from around the world, student performances, keynote speeches, and a recital of the Message for that year’s event read, in person, by that years selected message author.

In [[Shanghai]] 2017 for instance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website= shine.cn |url= https://www.shine.cn/archive/metro/International-dance-day-to-be-celebrated/shdaily.shtml |title= International Dance Day to be Celebrated in Shanghai |author=  XU Wei |authorlink=XU Wei |date= April 21, 2017 |publisher= Shanghai Daily |access-date= March 13, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, the event became a three-day celebration with greater emphasis on education through dance workshops and presentations led by an international cast of dance experts. The evenings were reserved for performances, the finale of which was the Gala Celebration. The Shanghai event also had a humanitarian aspect, with much of its focus being on celebrating the achievements of disabled dancers and encouraging disabled children to dance &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=IDD Brochure|last=ITI|date=2017|authorlink=International Theatre Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Beyond the Gala itself, ITI Centres across the globe are encouraged to mark the 29th April in their own country through special educational initiatives, humanitarian drives, dance performances and festivals&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.international-dance-day.org/celebratingdanceday.html|title=International Dance Day - International Theatre Institute ITI|website=www.international-dance-day.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Message Authors ==
To help publicise International Dance Day each year the International Theatre Institute selects an outstanding personality from the world of dance to be the Message Author for the event. In the message, it is hoped that the author can underline the relevance and power of dance. Past authors have included [[Trisha Brown]], [[Alicia Alonso]], and [[Merce Cunningham]].

As 2018 marked the 70th Anniversary of ITI, 5 Message Authors were selected for the 2018 event, one from each of the 5 [[UNESCO]] Regions. The 5 authors were; [[Georgette GEBARA]] ([[Lebanon]], [[Arab]] Countries), [[Salia SANOU]] ([[Burkina Faso]], [[Africa]]), [[Marianela BOAN]] ([[Cuba]], The [[Americas]]), [[Willy TSAO]] ([[China]], [[Asia-Pacific]]) and [[Ohad NAHARIN]] ([[Israel]], [[Europe]]).

'''John Warnock Hinckley Jr.''' (born May 29, 1955) is an American man who, on March 30, 1981, attempted to [[Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan|assassinate U.S. President Ronald Reagan]] in Washington, D.C. He wounded Reagan with a bullet that ricocheted and hit him in the chest. He also wounded police officer [[Thomas Delahanty]] and [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent [[Tim McCarthy]], and critically wounded Press Secretary [[James Brady]], who died 33 years later as a result of the attack.

Reported to have been driven by an obsessive fixation on teen actress [[Jodie Foster]], Hinckley was found [[Insanity defense|not guilty by reason of insanity]] and remained under institutional psychiatric care until September 2016. Public outcry over the verdict led to the [[Insanity Defense Reform Act]] of 1984, which altered the rules for consideration of mental illness of defendants in Federal Criminal Court proceedings in the United States. He was released from institutional psychiatric care on September 10, 2016, and lives with his mother.&lt;ref name="foxnews.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=John Hinckley Jr. to begin living full-time in Virginia Sept. 10|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/09/01/john-hinckley-jr-to-begin-living-full-time-in-virginia-sept-10.html|accessdate=1 September 2016|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
John Warnock Hinckley Jr. was born on May 29, 1955, in [[Ardmore, Oklahoma]],&lt;ref name=UMKC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2013/03/20/us/john-hinckley-jr-fast-facts/index.html "John Hinckley Jr Fast Facts"]. [[CNN]]. Retrieved September 19, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and moved with his wealthy family to [[Dallas]], Texas, at the age of 4. His late father was John Warnock Hinckley Sr., president of [[World Vision United States]], and chairman and president of the Vanderbilt Energy Corporation. His mother is Jo Ann Hinckley (née Moore). He has two older siblings: sister Diane and brother Scott. After graduating from [[Vanderbilt University]], Scott Hinckley became vice president of his father's oil business. Their sister, Diane, graduated from [[Southern Methodist University]] in Dallas.&lt;ref name=UMKC/&gt;

Hinckley grew up in [[University Park, Texas]],&lt;ref name=AmericanExperience&gt;{{cite web|author=Wolf, Julie|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/biography/reagan-hinckley/|title=Biography: John Hinckley Jr.|work=[[American Experience|The American Experience]]|publisher=[[PBS]]|accessdate=September 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attended [[Highland Park High School (University Park, Texas)|Highland Park High School]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=John Hinckley Jr. brings infamy to Lubbock|url=http://www.lubbockcentennial.com/Section/1959_1983/hinckley.shtml|year=2008|newspaper=[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]]|accessdate=August 5, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925143644/http://www.lubbockcentennial.com/Section/1959_1983/hinckley.shtml|archive-date=September 25, 2013|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Dallas County, Texas|Dallas County]]. During his grade school years, he played football, basketball, hockey, soccer and baseball, learned to play the piano, and was elected class president twice.

After Hinckley graduated from high school in 1973, his family, owners of the Hinckley oil company, moved to [[Evergreen, Colorado]], where the new company headquarters was located.&lt;ref name=UMKC/&gt; He was an off-and-on student at [[Texas Tech University]] from 1974 to 1980 but eventually dropped out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=University|first=Texas Tech|date=1974|title=La Ventana, vol. 049|language=en|hdl=2346/48660}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975 he went to Los Angeles in the hope of becoming a [[songwriter]]. His efforts were unsuccessful, and he wrote to his parents with tales of misfortune and pleas for money. He also spoke of a girlfriend, Lynn Collins, who turned out to be a fabrication. In September 1976, he returned to his parents' home in Evergreen.&lt;ref&gt;Noe, Denise.

During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Hinckley began purchasing weapons and practicing with them. He was prescribed anti-depressants and tranquilizers to deal with emotional issues.&lt;ref name=UMKC/&gt;

==Obsession with Jodie Foster==
Hinckley became obsessed with the 1976 film ''[[Taxi Driver]]'', in which disturbed protagonist Travis Bickle ([[Robert De Niro]]) plots to assassinate a presidential candidate. The Bickle character was partly based on the diaries of [[Arthur Bremer]], who attempted to assassinate [[George Wallace]].&lt;ref name=AmericanExperience/&gt; Hinckley developed an infatuation with [[Jodie Foster]], who played child prostitute Iris Steensma in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/hinckley/taxidriver.htm|title=Taxi Driver: Its Influence on John Hinckley Jr.|publisher=University of Missouri–Kansas City School of Law|accessdate=February 8, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302175446/http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/hinckley/taxidriver.htm|archivedate=March 2, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Foster entered [[Yale University]], Hinckley moved to [[New Haven, Connecticut]], for a short time to [[stalking|stalk]] her. He enrolled in a Yale writing class,&lt;ref name=UMKC/&gt; began slipping poems and messages under Foster's door, and repeatedly called her.

Failing to develop any meaningful contact with the actress, Hinckley fantasized about conducting an [[aircraft hijacking]] or committing suicide in front of her to get her attention. Eventually, he settled on a scheme to impress her by assassinating the president, thinking that by achieving a place in history, he would appeal to her as an equal. Hinckley trailed President [[Jimmy Carter]] from state to state, and was arrested in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], on a firearms charge. Penniless, he returned home. Despite psychiatric treatment for depression, his mental health did not improve. He began to target the newly elected president [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1981. To this purpose, he collected material on the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]].

Hinckley wrote to Foster just before his attempt on Reagan's life:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/hinckley/jfostercommun.HTM|title=Letter written to Jodie Foster by John Hinckley Jr.|publisher=University of Missouri–Kansas City School of Law|date=March 30, 1981|accessdate=February 8, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108054234/http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/hinckley/jfostercommun.HTM|archivedate=January 8, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although we talked on the phone a couple of times I never had the nerve to simply approach you and introduce myself. ... The reason I'm going ahead with this attempt now is because I cannot wait any longer to impress you. |John Hinckley Jr.}}

==Reagan assassination attempt==

On March 30, 1981, at 2:27&amp;nbsp;p.m. local time,&lt;ref name=UMKC/&gt; Hinckley shot a [[.22 caliber]] [[Röhm Gesellschaft|Röhm RG-14]] revolver six times at Reagan as he left the [[Washington Hilton|Hilton Hotel]] in Washington, D.C., after the president addressed an [[AFL–CIO]] conference.

Hinckley wounded police officer [[Thomas Delahanty]] and [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent [[Tim McCarthy|Timothy McCarthy]], and critically wounded press secretary [[James Brady]]. Hinckley did not hit Reagan directly, but seriously wounded him when a bullet ricocheted off the side of the [[Presidential state car (United States)|presidential limousine]] and hit him in the chest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Reagan| first = Ronald| title = Larry King Live: Remembering the Assassination Attempt on Ronald Reagan| date =March 30, 2001 | url = http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0103/30/lkl.00.html| accessdate =November 13, 2008| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;| work = CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hinckley did not try to flee and was arrested at the scene.

Brady's death was ruled a homicide 33 years after the shooting.

At his trial in 1982, in Washington, D.C., having been charged with 13 offenses, Hinckley was found [[Insanity defense|not guilty by reason of insanity]] on June 21. The defense [[Psychiatry|psychiatric]] reports portrayed him as insane while the prosecution reports characterized him as legally sane.&lt;ref name="trial"&gt;[http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/hinckley/hinckleyaccount.html The Trial of John W.

The verdict resulted in widespread dismay.

Hinckley was confined at [[St. Elizabeths Hospital]] in Washington, DC.&lt;ref name="trial" /&gt; After Hinckley was admitted, tests found that he was an "unpredictably dangerous" man who might harm himself or any third party. In 1983, he told ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'' that on a normal day he would "see a therapist, answer mail, play guitar, listen to music, play pool, watch television, eat lousy food and take delicious medication".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first= Denise| last= Noe| url= http://www.crimelibrary.com/terrorists_spies/assassins/john_hinckley/12.html |title= Life at St. Elizabeths| publisher= CrimeLibrary.com| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070407065043/http://www.crimelibrary.com/terrorists_spies/assassins/john_hinckley/12.html |archivedate=April 7, 2007 |page= 12 | access-date= September 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1987, Hinckley applied for a court order allowing him periodic home visits. As part of the consideration of the request, the judge ordered Hinckley's hospital room searched. Hospital officials found photographs and letters in Hinckley's room that showed a continued obsession with Foster, as well as evidence that Hinckley had exchanged letters with serial killer [[Ted Bundy]] and sought the address of the incarcerated [[Charles Manson]], who had inspired [[Lynette Fromme]] to try to kill president of the United States [[Gerald Ford]]. The court denied Hinckley's request for additional privileges.

In 1999, Hinckley was permitted to leave the hospital for supervised visits with his parents; he was granted longer unsupervised releases in 2000.&lt;ref name=AmericanExperience/&gt;&lt;ref name=more-freedom&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/federal-judge-grants-more-freedom-to-reagans-would-be-assassin/2013/12/20/efdd2c60-68e9-11e3-8b5b-a77187b716a3_story.html |title= Federal judge grants more freedom to John Hinckley Jr., Reagan's would-be assassin| first1= Matt| last1= Zapotosky | first2= Ann E. | last2= Marimow| work= [[The Washington Post]]| date= December 20, 2013| access-date= March 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These privileges were revoked when he was found to have smuggled materials about Foster into the hospital.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Hinckley was allowed supervised visits with his parents again during 2004 and 2005. Court hearings were held in September 2005 on whether he could have expanded privileges to leave the hospital.

On December 30, 2005, a federal judge ruled that Hinckley would be allowed visits, supervised by his parents, to their home in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]]. The judge ruled that Hinckley could have up to three visits of three nights and then four visits of four nights, each depending on the successful completion of the last. All of the experts who testified at Hinckley's 2005 conditional release hearing, including the government experts, agreed that his depression and psychotic disorder were in full remission and that he should have some expanded conditions of release.&lt;ref name=NBC2018&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/judge-rules-would-be-reagan-assassin-john-hinckley-can-move-n937471|title=Judge rules would-be Reagan assassin John Hinckley can move out of his mother's house|work=[[NBCNews.com]]|date=November 16, 2018|access-date=November 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Hinckley requested further freedoms, including two one-week visits with his parents, and a month-long visit. US District Judge [[Paul L. Friedman]] denied that request on June 6, 2007.

On June 17, 2009, a federal judge ruled that Hinckley would be permitted to visit his mother for a dozen visits of 10 days at a time, rather than six, to spend more time outside of the hospital, and to have a driver's license. The court also ordered that Hinckley be required to carry a GPS-enabled cell phone to track him whenever he was outside of his parents' home. He was prohibited from speaking with the news media.&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/CRIME/03/26/hinckley.today/index.html |title=Doctors: Reagan shooter is recovering, not a danger|first= James| last= Polk|date=March 26, 2011|publisher= CNN| accessdate= March 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecutors objected to this ruling, saying that Hinckley was still a danger to others and had unhealthy and inappropriate thoughts about women. Hinckley recorded a song, "Ballad of an Outlaw", which the prosecutors claim is "reflecting suicide and lawlessness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/06/17/john.hinckley/index.html|title=Court gives would-be assassin John Hinckley more freedom| publisher= CNN|date=June 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, it was reported that a forensic psychologist at the hospital testified that "Hinckley has recovered to the point that he poses no imminent risk of danger to himself or others".&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt; On March 29, 2011, the day before the 30th anniversary of the assassination attempt, Hinckley's attorney filed a court petition requesting more freedom for his client, including additional unsupervised visits to the Virginia home of Hinckley's mother, Joanne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last= Carter| first= Rusty | date= March 30, 2011| url= http://articles.dailypress.com/2011-03-30/news/dp-nws-williamsburg-hinckley-visits-020110330_1_attorney-barry-levine-john-hinckley-williamsburg-hinckley | title= Man who attempted to assassinate Reagan wants more visits to Williamsburg| work= [[Daily Press (Virginia)|Daily Press]] |location= Virginia}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 30, 2011, a hearing in Washington was held to consider whether he could live full-time outside the hospital. The Justice Department opposed this, stating that Hinckley still poses a danger to the public. Justice Department counsel argued that Hinckley had been known to deceive his doctors in the past.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Carrie (November 30, 2011).

By December 2013, the court ordered that visits be extended to his mother, who lives near Williamsburg. Hinckley was permitted up to eight 17-day visits, with evaluation after the completion of each one.&lt;ref name=more-freedom/&gt;

On August 4, 2014, [[James Brady]] died.

This is a '''list of notable wide-scale power outages'''. To be included, the [[power outage]] must conform to ''all'' of the following criteria:
# The outage must not be planned by the service provider.
# The outage must affect at least 1,000 people ''and'' last at least one hour.
# There must be at least 1,000,000 person-hours of disruption.
In other words:
* 1,000 people affected for 1,000 hours (42 days) minimum, but if fewer than 1,000 people, event would not be included (regardless of duration).
* One million people affected for a minimum of one hour, but if duration is less than one hour, event would not be included (regardless of number of people).
* For example, 10,000 people affected for 100 hours ''or'' 100,000 for 10 hours would be the minimum to be included.
&lt;!--A reference documenting these conditions must be included.--&gt;

On the evening of November 9, the [[Northeast blackout of 1965]] affected portions of seven northeastern states in the United States and the province of Ontario in Canada.

=== 1969 ===

On August 5, a 50-mile stretch of Florida's gold coast was hit with a general power failure after an explosion at the Cutler Ridge facility. The outage affected more than 2 million people, and created a vast traffic jam. Miami and Ft. Lauderdale downtown areas were offline for almost two hours, with other areas dark for much longer periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1969/08/06/page/1/article/huge-power-failure-darkens-50-miles-of-floridas-gold-coast|title=Huge Power Failure Darkens 50 Miles of Florida's Gold Coast (August 6, 1969)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the evening of February 2, power in parts of the [[New York City]] boroughs of [[Manhattan]], [[The Bronx]] and [[Queens]] was lost following an explosion at [[Consolidated Edison|Con Ed]]'s Waterside power facility on 40th Street and 1st Avenue in Manhattan. New York City television and FM radio stations that transmit from the [[Empire State Building]] were off the air. AM radio stations were largely unaffected, as most of their transmitters were located in either Northern [[New Jersey]] (e.g. WABC-AM) or on [[High Island, New York|High Island]] (e.g. WCBS-AM) in the Bronx, which was not affected by the blackout. However, several Manhattan AM station studios were affected due to insufficient power backups. Several lines of the New York City IND and IRT subway lines were affected, stranding passengers. At [[Grand Central Terminal]] power in the terminal was lost, but power on the tracks was retained because it runs on [[direct current]]. The ''[[New York Daily News]]'' was also affected when the blackout caused their printing facility to halt operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://donswaim.com/wcbssoundpage.html |title=WCBS Newsradio88 Appreciation Site |work=donswaim.com |access-date=March 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 13–14 in [[New York City]], 9 million people were affected by a [[New York City blackout of 1977|power outage]]. It was a result of a transmission failure due to a lightning-strike on power lines. A second lightning-strike caused the loss of two more overhead power lines, and the last power connection between New York City and the Northwest. The power outage resulted in high instances of [[looting]] occurring over 26 hours.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.ucsusa.org/mike-jacobs/2003-northeast-blackout-and-13-of-the-largest-power-outages-in-history-199|title=13 of the Largest Power Outages in History – and What They Tell Us About the 2003 Northeast Blackout – The Equation|website=blog.ucsusa.org|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 20, a power outage covered almost the entire province of [[Quebec]], affecting 6 million people. Power was restored to scattered rural areas within an hour and service was brought back to parts of Montreal and Quebec City within 2 hours; it took several hours to fully restore power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0F16F83D5E167493C3AB1782D85F438785F9 |title=Quebec Blacked Out By a Power Failure |publisher=The New York Times |date=September 21, 1977 |accessdate=February 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1978 ===
On March 18, [[Thailand]] experienced a countrywide blackout as a result of failed generators in the South Pranakhorn Powerplant in [[Samut Prakan]], which then caused many generators across the country to shut down. The failure started at 7:40&amp;nbsp;am (GMT+7). Before the isolation of the power grid, blackouts occurred in the northern provinces of Thailand for one hour, the northwestern provinces for 15 minutes, the southern provinces for half an hour, the central provinces for one hour, and [[Bangkok]] and its neighboring provinces for more than two hours. Within nine hours and 20 minutes, the authorities were able to restore power across the country.

=== 1981 ===
On January 8, prisoners on a work assignment burning trash and debris at the Utah State Prison in [[Draper, Utah]], accidentally caused a major power failure when something they were burning exploded, causing a fireball that shorted out transmission lines above them. 1.5 million people lost power, in almost all of Utah, as well as parts of southeastern Idaho and southwestern Wyoming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/10/us/fire-at-utah-prison-dump-blamed-for-major-blackout.html | work=The New York Times | title=Fire at Utah Prison Dump Blamed For Major Blackout | date=January 10, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 7, a powerful [[Southern Great Lakes Derecho of 1991|wind storm]] affected a large portion of central North America and caused power outages for about one million customers from [[Iowa]] to [[Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/misc/AbtDerechos/casepages/jul7-81991page.htm |title=The Southern Great Lakes Derecho of 1991 |publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA)|access-date=March 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1992 ===
On August 24, [[Hurricane Andrew]] made landfall on Elliot Key. As it passed over the northern [[Florida Keys]] it downed 17 miles of power lines, breaking the wooden poles they were strung on, along a path that was in four feet of water, stretching from the Turkey Point Nuclear Plant southward to the upper Keys. The shallow depth prevented the use of large construction barge cranes for rebuilding the power pylons but the water was too deep for land-based construction vehicles. As a result, the Upper and Middle Keys were largely without power for several months as the Middle Keys Electric Co-op only had generating capacity for 10% of its demand. The power lines heading north to Miami were restored much more quickly, as they were strung along the side of US highway 1 on dry land. Key West power was in the process of decommissioning an end-of-life oil-fired plant and was able to restore 75% generating capacity for the lower keys in one day as there was no storm damage that far south. Key West power was in the process of converting to sourcing 100% of its electricity from the Turkey Point facility.

On July 2–3 in the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and [[Mexico]] there were 2 million people that lost power due to a transmission line overheating in Idaho and a 230-kV line between Montana and Idaho tripping. Some customers were without power for minutes, while others were without for hours.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On August 10, the [[Western Interconnection|Western Intertie]] buckled under the high summer heat of the [[1996 Western North America blackouts]], causing a cascading power failure affecting nine western states of the United States and parts of [[Mexico]]. Four million people were affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nwcouncil.org/history/Blackout.asp |title=Blackout of 1996 |publisher=Nwcouncil.org |date=August 10, 1996 |accessdate=November 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Power was out in some locations for four days.

On November 19, a severe [[ice storm]] affected the region around [[Spokane, Washington]] and [[Coeur d'Alene, Idaho]] causing power outages lasting up to two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Times |url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2009/jan/22/freezing-fog-has-wreaked-havoc-lincoln-county |title=Freezing fog has wreaked havoc in Lincoln County – Spokesman.com – Jan. 22, 2009 |publisher=Spokesman.com |accessdate=November 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From February 20 to March 27, the [[1998 Auckland power crisis]] resulted in the entire [[Auckland CBD|Auckland Central Business District]] in [[Auckland]], New Zealand being without power for several weeks, after a line failure had cause a chain reaction leading to the failure of three other lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.med.govt.nz/templates/Page____12136.aspx |title=Homepage &amp;#124; Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment |website=Med.govt.nz |date= |accessdate=2016-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 31, a powerful [[Late-May 1998 tornado outbreak and derecho|wind storm]] caused a power outage for nearly two million customers across much of central North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/misc/AbtDerechos/casepages/may30-311998page.htm |title=The Southern Great Lakes Derecho of 1998 |publisher=NOAA |access-date=March 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 7, a series of widespread derechos in the Northeast (the [[New York State Labor Day derechos|Labor Day Derechos]]) caused a power outage for hundreds of thousands of customers for several days.

On December 8, affecting [[San Francisco, California]], and its environs, over 350,000 customers (buildings) or 940,000 people were affected by an outage caused when the [[Pacific Gas and Electric Company]] placed a [[San Mateo, California|San Mateo]] sub-station online at 8:17&amp;nbsp;am PST, while the station was still [[Ground (electricity)|grounded]] following maintenance. This drew so much power from the transmission lines on the San Francisco peninsula that 25 other sub-stations in San Francisco automatically and immediately shut down. Power was not fully restored until almost 4:00&amp;nbsp;pm PST the same day. Economic costs were estimated in tens of millions of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfmuseum.org/alm/outage.html |title=San Francisco Power Outage – 1998 |publisher=Sfmuseum.org |date=December 8, 1998 |accessdate=November 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 9, a major power outage left the entire southern half of Portugal, including [[Lisbon]], without power for a few hours. The blackout occurred shortly after 10&amp;nbsp;pm local time. The ''apagão'' (translated as "super outage"), suddenly plunged Lisbon in complete darkness. Stalled commuter trains and traffic light failures wreaked some havoc in the streets. Security was immediately reinforced in the city, but no rise in criminal activity was registered. [[Energias de Portugal]], the main Portuguese electricity operator, later reported that the blackout was due to the electrocution of an unfortunate [[stork]], which landed "on the wrong place at the wrong time". Because of this, the story was reported in the "oddly enough" sections of some European newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvi.iol.pt/informacao/noticia_imprimir.php?id=129742&amp;zona=informacao|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929134735/http://www.tvi.iol.pt/informacao/noticia_imprimir.php?id=129742&amp;zona=informacao|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-09-29|author=TVI|title=The Portuguese blackout after its 3rd anniversary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the night of November 4, in main parts of [[Germany]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Belgium]], [[Spain]], and [[Portugal]], over 15 million households were left without power after a cascading breakdown of the [[2006 European blackout]]. Power grids of several other nations ([[Belgium]], [[Netherlands]], [[Poland]], [[Switzerland]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Greece]] and [[Morocco]]) experienced minor local outages. The root cause was an overload triggered by the German electricity company [[E.ON]] switching off an electricity line over the river [[Ems powerline crossing|Ems]] to allow the cruise ship [[Norwegian Pearl]] to pass through safely. The impact of this disconnection on the security of the network had not been properly assessed, and resulted in the European transmission grid splitting into three independent parts for a period of two hours. The imbalance between generation and demand in each section resulted in the power outages for consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.entsoe.eu/fileadmin/user_upload/_library/publications/ce/otherreports/Final-Report-20070130.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - IC-Final-Report-20070129-v13.doc |website=Entsoe.eu |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2016-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 27–31, hundreds of thousands of homes in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], including Melbourne, suffered various power failures as a result of a record heat wave. It is estimated that over 500,000 residents in Melbourne were without power for the evening of January 30, 2009. The outage affected much of central Melbourne with train and tram services cancelled, the evacuation of Crown Casino, traffic light failures, people being rescued from lifts and patrons of the Victorian Arts Centre evacuated and shows cancelled. The outage occurred only an hour after the National Electricity Market Management Company (NEMMCO) issued a statement saying load shedding was ending and power had been restored. Authorities say there had been a major electricity failure in the city's west, caused by the three-day heatwave. It is believed an explosion at South Morang contributed to the power problems along three transmission lines supplying Victoria's west and Victorian power supplier SP AusNet shed 1,000 megawatts.

On July 20, power was cut to around 100,000 homes in the areas of South East London and North Kent, UK, after vandals deliberately caused a fire near a cable installation,  which caused failure of a 132 kV cable and four circuit boards. Due to the nature of the cable, it was impossible to re-route supplies around other cables without overloading them. As a result, power supplies were cut to about half of the homes for approximately four days, while other homes were given three-hour allocations of power followed by six hours "off". Over 70 mobile generators were brought in from around the country to help restore power in what was the largest deployment in London's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8162511.stm|title=Over 10,000 still without power|date=July 22, 2009|accessdate=July 24, 2009|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The failure was caused by a major thunder storm which affected a key transmission line to southeastern Brazil, causing all 20 turbines at the hydroelectric power plant to shut-down due to the abrupt fall of power demand. Four of Brazil's most densely populated states entirely lost power (including the states of [[São Paulo]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]]) with 14 more states being partly affected. The entire country of Paraguay experienced the power failure. It took about seven hours for the system to fully recover. This is regarded as one of the largest blackouts in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/11/10/brazil-blackout-largest-c_n_353217.html | work=Huffington Post | title=Brazil Blackout: Two Largest Cities Hit By Massive Power Outages | date=November 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/americas/11/10/brazil.blackout/index.html | work=CNN | title=Dam failure triggers huge blackout in Brazil - CNN.com | accessdate=May 8, 2010 | date=November 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/33844757/ns/world_news-americas/ |title=Lights flicker on after blackout in Brazil |work= NBC News |publisher=MSNBC |date=November 12, 2009 |accessdate=November 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Long Day's Journey into Night''''' is a drama [[Play (theatre)|play]] in four acts written by American playwright [[Eugene O'Neill]] in 1941–42 but first published in 1956. The play is widely considered to be his ''[[magnum opus]]'' and one of the finest American plays of the 20th century. It premiered in Sweden in February 1956 and then opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in November 1956, winning the [[Tony Award]] for Best Play.

O'Neill posthumously received the 1957 [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]] for ''Long Day's Journey into Night''. The work concerns the Tyrone family, consisting of parents James and Mary and their sons Edmund and Jamie. Mary is addicted to morphine and Edmund is ill with tuberculosis. The "Long Day" refers to the setting of the play, which takes place during one day. The play is semi-autobiographical.

==Summary==
The play takes place on a single day in August 1912, from around 8:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. to midnight. The setting is the seaside [[Connecticut]] home of the Tyrones' [[Monte Cristo Cottage]]. The four main characters are the semi-autobiographical representations of O'Neill himself, his older brother, and their parents.

This play portrays a family in a ferociously negative light as the parents and two sons express accusations, blame, and resentments—qualities that are often paired with pathetic and self-defeating attempts at affection, encouragement, tenderness, and yearnings for things to be otherwise. The pain of this family is made worse by their depth of self-understanding and self-analysis, combined with a brutal honesty, as they see it, and an ability to boldly express themselves. The story deals with the mother's [[Substance use disorder|addiction]] to morphine, the family's addiction to whiskey, the father's [[miser]]liness, the older brother's licentiousness, and younger brother's illness.

==Synopsis==

===Act I===
:''8:30 am''
James Tyrone is a 65-year-old actor who had long ago bought a "vehicle" play for himself and had established his reputation based on this one role with which he had toured for years. Although that "vehicle" had served him well financially, he is now resentful that his having become so identified with this character has limited his scope and opportunities as a classical actor. He is a wealthy though somewhat miserly man. His money is all tied up in property which he hangs onto in spite of impending financial hardship. His dress and appearance are showing signs of his strained financial circumstances, but he retains many of the mixed affectations of a classical actor in spite of his shabby attire.

His wife Mary has recently returned from treatment for [[morphine]] addiction and has put on weight as a result. She is looking much healthier than the family has been accustomed to, and they remark frequently on her improved appearance. However, she still retains the haggard facial features of a long-time addict. As a recovering addict, she is restless and anxious. She also suffers from [[insomnia]], which is not made any easier by her husband and children's loud snoring. When Edmund, her younger son, hears her moving around at night and entering the spare bedroom, he becomes alarmed, because this is the room where, in the past, she would satisfy her addiction. He questions her about it indirectly. She reassures him that she just went there to get away from her husband's snoring.

In addition to Mary's problems, the family is worried about Edmund's coughing; they fear that he might have [[tuberculosis]], and are anxiously awaiting a doctor's diagnosis. Edmund is more concerned about the effect a positive diagnosis might have on his mother than on himself. The constant possibility that she might [[relapse]] worries him still further. Once again, he indirectly speaks to his mother about her addiction. He asks her to "promise not to worry yourself sick and to take care of yourself." "Of course I promise you," she protests, but then adds ('with a sad bitterness'), "But I suppose you're remembering I've promised before on my word of honor."

===Act II===
:''12:45 pm and 1:15 pm''
Jamie and Edmund taunt each other about stealing their father's alcohol and watering it down so he won't notice. They speak about Mary's conduct. Jamie berates Edmund for leaving their mother unsupervised. Edmund berates Jamie for being suspicious. Both, however, are deeply worried that their mother's addiction may have resurfaced. Jamie points out to Edmund that they had concealed their mother's addiction from him for ten years, explaining that his naiveté about the nature of the disease was understandable but deluded. They discuss the upcoming results of Edmund's tests for tuberculosis, and Jamie tells him to prepare for the worst.

Mary appears. She is distraught about Edmund's coughing, which he tries to suppress so as not to alarm her, fearing anything that might trigger her addiction again. When Edmund accepts his mother's excuse that she had been upstairs so long because she had been "lying down", Jamie looks at them both contemptuously. Mary notices and starts becoming defensive and belligerent, berating Jamie for his cynicism and disrespect for his parents. Jamie is quick to point out that the only reason he has survived as an actor is through his father's influence in the business.

Mary speaks of her frustration with their summer home, its impermanence and shabbiness, and her husband's indifference to his surroundings. With irony, she alludes to her belief that this air of detachment might be the very reason he has tolerated her addiction for so long. This frightens Edmund, who is trying desperately to hang on to his belief in normality while faced with two emotionally horrific problems at once. Finally, unable to tolerate the way Jamie is looking at her, she asks him angrily why he is doing it. "You know!", he shoots back, and tells her to take a look at her glazed eyes in the mirror.

===Act III===
:''6:30 pm''
Mary and Cathleen return home from their drive to the drugstore, where Mary has sent Cathleen in to purchase her morphine prescription. Not wanting to be alone, Mary does not allow Cathleen to go to the kitchen to finish dinner and offers her a drink instead. Mary does most of the talking and discusses her love for fog but her hatred of the foghorn, and her husband's obvious obsession with money. Mary has already taken some of her "prescription". She talks about her past in a Catholic [[convent]] and the promise she once had as a pianist and the fact that it was once thought that she might become a [[nun]]. She also makes it clear that while she fell in love with her husband from the time she met him, she had never taken to the theatre crowd. She shows her [[arthritis|arthritic]] hands to Cathleen and explains that the pain is why she needs her prescription – an explanation which is untrue and transparent to Cathleen.

When Mary dozes off under the influence of the morphine, Cathleen exits to prepare dinner. Mary awakes and begins to have bitter memories about how much she loved her life before she met her husband. She also decides that her prayers as an addict are not being heard by the [[Virgin Mary|Virgin]] and decides to go upstairs to get more drugs, but before she can Edmund and James Sr. return home.

Although both men are drunk, they both realize that Mary is back on morphine, although she attempts to act as if she is not. Jamie has not returned home, but has elected instead to continue drinking and to visit the local whorehouse. After calling Jamie a "hopeless failure" Mary warns that his bad influence will drag his brother down as well. After seeing the condition that his wife is in, James expresses the regret that he bothered to come home, and he attempts to ignore her as she continues her remarks, which include blaming him for Jamie's drinking. Then, as often happens in the play, Mary and James try to get over their animosity and attempt to express their love for one another by remembering happier days. When James goes to the basement to get another bottle of whiskey, Mary continues to talk with Edmund.

When Edmund reveals that he has tuberculosis, Mary refuses to believe it, and attempts to discredit Dr. Hardy, due to her inability to face the reality and  severity of the situation. She accuses Edmund of attempting to get more attention by blowing everything out of proportion. In retaliation, Edmund reminds his mother that her own father died of tuberculosis, and then, before exiting, he adds how difficult it is to have a "dope fiend for a mother." Alone, Mary admits that she needs more morphine and hopes that someday she will "accidentally" [[drug overdose|overdose]], because she knows that if she did so on purpose, the Virgin would never forgive her. When James comes back with more alcohol he notes that there was evidence that Jamie had attempted to pick the locks to the whiskey cabinet in the cellar, as he has done before. Mary ignores this and bursts out that she is afraid that Edmund is going to die. She also confides to James that Edmund does not love her because of her drug problem. When James attempts to console her, Mary again rues having given birth to Edmund, who appears to have been conceived to replace a baby they had lost before Edmund's birth. When Cathleen announces dinner, Mary indicates that she is not hungry and is going to bed. James goes in to dinner all alone, knowing that Mary is really going upstairs to get more drugs.

===Act IV===
:''Midnight''
Edmund returns home to find his father playing [[solitaire]]. While the two argue and drink, they also have an intimate, tender conversation. James explains his stinginess, and also reveals that he ruined his career by staying in an acting job for money. After so many years playing the same part, he lost his talent for versatility. Edmund talks to his father about sailing and of his aspiration to become a great writer one day. They hear Jamie coming home drunk, and James leaves to avoid fighting. Jamie and Edmund converse, and Jamie confesses that although he loves Edmund more than anyone else, he again ambiguously lashes out at his father calling on him to fail. Jamie passes out. When James returns, Jamie wakes up, and they quarrel anew. Mary, lost in her drug-laden dreams of the past, comes downstairs. Holding her wedding gown, she babbles incoherently about her convent days and falling in love with James, while her husband and sons silently watch her.

==Characters==
* James Tyrone, Sr. – 65 years old. He looks ten years younger and is about five feet eight inches tall but appears taller due to his military-like posture and bearing. He is broad-shouldered and deep-chested and remarkably good-looking for his age with light brown eyes. His speech and movement are those of a classical actor with a studied technique, but he is unpretentious and not temperamental at all with "inclinations still close to his humble beginnings and [[Irish people|Irish]] farmer forebears". His attire is somewhat threadbare and shabby. He wears his clothing to the limit of usefulness. He has been a healthy man his entire life and is free of hang ups and anxieties except for fear of "dying in the poorhouse" and obsession with having money. He has "streaks of sentimental melancholy and rare flashes of intuitive sensibility". He smokes cigars and dislikes being referred to as the "Old Man" by his sons.
* Mary Cavan Tyrone – 54 years old, the wife and mother of the family who lapses between self-delusion and the haze of her morphine addiction. She is medium height with a young graceful figure, a trifle plump with distinctly Irish facial features. She was once extremely pretty and is still striking. She wears no make-up and her hair is thick, white and perfectly coiffed. She has large, dark, almost black, eyes. She has a soft and attractive voice with a "touch of Irish lilt when she is merry". Mary has been addicted to morphine since the difficult birth of her youngest son Edmund. The doctor who treated her simply gave her painkillers, which led to a longtime morphine addiction that continues to plague her.
* James "Jamie", Jr. – 33 years old, the older son. He has thinning hair, an aquiline nose and shows signs of premature disintegration. He has a habitual expression of cynicism. He resembles his father. "On the rare occasions when he smiles without sneering, his personality possesses the remnant of a humorous, romantic, irresponsible Irish charm – the beguiling ne'er-do-well, with a strain of the sentimentally poetic". He is attractive to women and popular with men. He is an actor like his father but has difficulty finding work due to a reputation for being an irresponsible, womanizing alcoholic. He and his father argue a great deal about this. Jamie often refers to his father as "Old Gaspard", a character from the opera ''[[Les cloches de Corneville]]'', who is also a miser.
* Edmund – 23 years old, the younger and more intellectually and poetically inclined son. He is thin and wiry. He looks like both his parents but more like his mother. He has her big dark eyes and hypersensitive mouth in a long narrow Irish face with dark brown hair and red highlights from the sun. Like his mother, he is extremely nervous. He is in bad health and his cheeks are sunken. Later he is diagnosed with tuberculosis. He is politically inclined to have socialist leanings. He traveled the world by working in the merchant navy and caught tuberculosis while abroad.
* Cathleen – "The second girl", she is the summer maid. She is a "buxom Irish peasant", in her early twenties with red cheeks, black hair and blue eyes. She is "amiable, ignorant, clumsy with a well-meaning stupidity".

Several characters are referenced in the play but do not appear on stage:

* Eugene Tyrone – A son born before Edmund who died of measles at the age of two. He was infected by Jamie who was seven at the time and had been told not to enter his room but disobeyed. Mary believes that Jamie had the intent of hurting Eugene.
* Bridget – A cook.
* McGuire – A real estate agent who has swindled James Tyrone in the past.
* Shaughnessy – A tenant on a farm owned by the Tyrones.
* Harker – A friend of James Tyrone, "the Standard Oil millionaire", owns a neighboring farm to Shaughnessy with whom he gets into conflicts, often postulated to be based on [[Edward Harkness]], Standard Oil heir, who had a summer home nearby in Waterford, Connecticut.
* Doctor Hardy – The Tyrones' physician, whom the other family members don't think much of.
* Captain Turner – The Tyrones' neighbor.
* Smythe – A garage assistant whom James hired as a chauffeur for Mary. Mary suspects he is intentionally damaging the car to provide work for the garage.
* The mistress – A woman with whom James had had an affair before his marriage, who had later sued him causing Mary to be shunned by her friends as someone with undesirable social connections.
* Mary's father – Died of tuberculosis.
* James's parents and siblings – The family immigrated to the United States when James was 8 years old. Two years later the father abandoned the family and returned to Ireland where he died after ingesting rat poison. It was suspected suicide but James refuses to believe that. He had two older brothers and three sisters.

==History of the play==
O'Neill finished revising the manuscript into its final version in March 1941.&lt;ref name=Gelb&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gelb|first1=Arthur|authorlink1=Arthur Gelb|last2=Gelb|first2=Barbara|authorlink2=Barbara Gelb|title=O'Neill: Life with Monte Cristo|date=2000|publisher=Applause Books|location=New York|isbn=0-399-14609-1|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/g/gelb-oneill.html|accessdate=13 October 2016|ref=Gelb}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not want it ever produced as a play, and did not even want it published during his lifetime, writing to his friend, the critic [[George Jean Nathan]]: "There are good reasons in the play itself... why I'm keeping this one very much to myself, as you will appreciate when you read it."&lt;ref name=Gelb /&gt;

O'Neill did not copyright the play. In 1945 he had a sealed copy of the manuscript placed in the document vault of publisher [[Random House]], instructing that it not be published until 25 years after his death. He sent a second sealed copy to the O'Neill collection at [[Yale University]].&lt;ref name=Gelb /&gt;

Soon after O'Neill's death, his widow [[Carlotta Monterey]] demanded that Random House contravene O'Neill's explicit wishes and publish the play at once. "We refused, of course," wrote publisher [[Bennett Cerf]] in his memoirs, "but then were horrified to learn that legally all the cards were in her hand. … I do not regret that we took the stand we did, because I still think we were right."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cerf |first=Bennett |date=1977 |title=At Random |url= |location=New York |publisher=Random House |page=89 |isbn=0-394-47877-0 |author-link=Bennett Cerf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Monterey had the play published by the [[Yale University Press]] in 1956, with the bulk of the proceeds deeded to Yale's Eugene O'Neill Collection and for scholarships at its drama school.&lt;ref name=Gelb /&gt;

==Autobiographical content==
[[File:Montecristocotage.jpg|thumb|Monte Cristo Cottage, boyhood home of O'Neill and the setting for two of his works, ''Long Day's Journey into Night'', and ''[[Ah, Wilderness!]]'']]
In key aspects, the play closely parallels Eugene O'Neill's own life. The location, a summer home in Connecticut, corresponds to the family home, [[Monte Cristo Cottage]], in [[New London, Connecticut]] (the small town of the play). The actual cottage, today owned and operated by the [[Eugene O'Neill Theater Center]], is made up as it may appear in the play. The family in the script corresponds to the O'Neill family, which was Irish-American, with three name changes: The family name "O'Neill" is changed to "Tyrone," which is the name of the earldom granted to [[Conn O'Neill, 1st Earl of Tyrone|Conn O'Neill]] by Henry VIII. The names of the second and third sons are reversed, "Eugene" with "Edmund". In fact, Eugene, the playwright, was the third and the youngest child, and he corresponds to the character of "Edmund" in the play. O'Neill's mother, [[Ella O'Neill|Mary Ellen "Ella" Quinlan]], corresponds to the character Mary ''Cavan.'' The ages are all the actual ages of the O'Neill family in August 1912.

Eugene O'Neill's father, [[James O'Neill (actor)|James O'Neill]], was a promising young actor in his youth, as was the father in the play. He also shared the stage with [[Edwin Booth]], who is mentioned in the play. James O'Neill achieved commercial success in the title role of [[Alexandre Dumas|Dumas]]' ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'', playing the title role about 6,000 times; he was criticized for "selling out" for commercial success at the expense of artistic merit.&lt;ref&gt;Eaton, Walter Prichard (1910). ''The American Stage of Today''. New York, New York: P.F. Collier &amp; Son.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eugene's mother Mary did attend a Catholic school in the Midwest, [[Saint Mary's College (Indiana)|Saint Mary's College]], of [[Notre Dame, Indiana]]. Subsequent to the date when the play is set (1912), but prior to the play's writing (1941–42), Eugene's older brother Jamie did drink himself to death (c. 1923).

Regarding O'Neill himself, by 1912 he had attended a renowned university (Princeton), spent several years at sea, and suffered from depression and alcoholism, and did contribute to the local newspaper, the ''New London Telegraph,'' writing poetry as well as reporting. He did go to a sanatorium in 1912–13 due to suffering from [[tuberculosis]] (consumption), whereupon he devoted himself to playwriting. The events in the play are thus set immediately prior to O'Neill beginning his career in earnest.

==Productions==

===Premiere productions===
[[File:Long Day's Journey into Night 1956.jpg|thumb|upright|Window card for the 1956 Broadway production of ''Long Day's Journey into Night'' starring [[Fredric March]] and [[Florence Eldridge]]]]
''Long Day's Journey into Night'' was first performed by the [[Royal Dramatic Theatre]] in [[Stockholm]], Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title= ''Long Day's Journey Into Night'' | url=http://www.eoneill.com/artifacts/Long_Days_Journey.htm | publisher=eOneill.com | year=2008 | accessdate=2008-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; During O'Neill's lifetime, the Swedish people had embraced his work to a far greater extent than had any other nation, including his own. Thus, the play had its world premiere in Stockholm on February 2, 1956, in Swedish (as ''Lång dags färd mot natt''), in a production directed by [[Bengt Ekerot]], with the cast of [[Lars Hanson]] (James Tyrone), [[Inga Tidblad]] (Mary Tyrone), [[Ulf Palme]] (James Tyrone, Jr.), [[Jarl Kulle]] (Edmund Tyrone) and [[Catrin Westerlund]] (Cathleen, the serving-maid or "second girl" as O'Neill's script dubs her). The premiere and production were very successful, and the directing and acting critically acclaimed.

The [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut of ''Long Day's Journey into Night'' took place at the [[Helen Hayes Theatre]] on 7 November 1956, shortly after its American premiere at Boston's [[Wilbur Theatre]]. The production was directed by [[José Quintero]], and its cast included [[Fredric March]] (James Tyrone), [[Florence Eldridge]] who was March’s wife in real life (Mary Tyrone), [[Jason Robards|Jason Robards, Jr.]] ("Jamie" Tyrone), [[Bradford Dillman]] (Edmund), and Katherine Ross (Cathleen).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Long Day's Journey Into Night|url=http://www.playbill.com/production/long-days-journey-into-night-helen-hayes-theatre-vault-0000004510|website=Playbill|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production won the [[Tony Award]] for [[Tony Award for Best Play|Best Play]] and [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play|Best Actor in a Play]] (Fredric March), and the [[New York Drama Critics' Circle]] Award for Best Play of the season.

The play's first production in the United Kingdom came in 1958, opening first in [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, and then moving to the [[Gielgud Theatre|Globe Theatre]] in London's [[West End theatre|West End]]. It was directed again by Quintero, and the cast included [[Anthony Quayle]] (James), [[Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies]] (Mary), [[Ian Bannen]] (Jamie), [[Alan Bates]] (Edmund), and [[Etain O'Dell]] (Cathleen).

'''''Løvejagten''''' ([[Danish language|Danish]] for ''"the lion hunt"'', English title: ''The Lion Hunt'') was a controversial [[1907 in film|1907]] silent film by [[Denmark|Danish]] producer [[Ole Olsen (filmmaker)|Ole Olsen]] and director [[Viggo Larsen]]. The short ten-minute movie caused an enormous public protest in [[Denmark]] because it depicted the actual shooting of two captive lions.&lt;ref name="when"/&gt;

==Synopsis==
Two big game hunters are on safari in the jungle with their African guide. They observe zebras, ostrich and a hippopotamus, and catch a small monkey for a pet. During the night they are awakened by a lion which kills a small goat and then the hunters' horse. The hunters shoot the lion as it stands by the water on a beach. They discover another lion and shoot it also. The lions are gutted and skinned. The happy hunters sit and smoke cigarettes afterward.

==Production and controversy==
The ten-minute "jungle" movie (215 meters of 35mm film) was actually filmed [[Filming location|on location]] in Denmark. Scenes of the hunters in the forest were shot in [[Jægersborg Dyrehave]] park near Copenhagen. The animals were filmed at the [[Copenhagen Zoo]] with the camera aimed downward to avoid any view of the enclosures. The controversial shooting of two lions took place on the small island of [[Elleore]] in the [[Roskilde fjord]].&lt;ref&gt;Casper Tyberg, "Teltholdernes verdensteater 1896-1909", ''100 Års Danske Film'', Rosinante, 2001, p.23&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1907, Ole Olsen decorated Elleore with palm fronds and artificial plants to simulate a [[tropical savanna]]. He then bought two elderly lions from the [[Tierpark Hagenbeck|Hagenbeck Zoo]] in [[Hamburg]], Germany for the large sum of 5000 deutschmarks.&lt;ref name="larsen"&gt;Larsen, Lisbeth Richter, ''World Record Nordisk Film Centenary'', Film #50, May 2006, retrieved=2008-06-22&lt;/ref&gt;
When the Danish [[Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] learned about Olsen's plan to shoot the lions for his movie, they protested to the [[Danish Minister of Justice]] [[Peter Adler Alberti]].&lt;ref name="when"&gt;{{cite web

}} &lt;/ref&gt; Alberti banned the filming. Two days later, however, Olsen defiantly shot the scenes as planned, then smuggled the film to Sweden. Olsen's cinematographer, [[Axel Graatkjær]], was arrested and spent a day in jail. At a court hearing, Alberti banned the movie in Denmark and revoked Olsen's license for his Biograf Theater.&lt;ref name="kommentar"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
In 1907, Olsen premiered ''The Lion Hunt'' in Sweden. Because of the publicity from the protests, ''Løvejagten'' was a huge success abroad. The following year, after the charges of animal cruelty were dropped and the Danish ban was rescinded, the film had its homeland premiere on November 11, 1908.&lt;ref name="when"/&gt; [[Nordisk Film|Nordisk Film Kompagni]] eventually sold 259 prints of ''Løvejagten'', which earned the company an enormous profit. It ushered in the "[[Cinema of Denmark|golden age]]" of Danish cinema when Nordisk Film became the most productive film company in Europe.&lt;ref name="kommentar"/&gt;
A sequel to the film, ''Bear Hunting in Russia'', was shot in 1909 and was also a profitable movie, eventually selling 118 prints.&lt;ref name="larsen"/&gt;

==Cast and crew==
[[Viggo Larsen]] directed the filming as well as acted as one of the hunters. Knud Lumbye portrayed the second hunter and William Thomsen played the African guide. [[Axel Graatkjær]], who later became a favorite cinematographer of [[August Blom]] and [[Urban Gad]], shot the film, credited under his actual name of A. Sørensen.

The Mantra-Rock Dance featured some of the most prominent Californian rock groups of the time, such as the [[Grateful Dead]]&lt;ref name= Schinder335&gt;{{Harvnb|Schinder|Schwartz|2008|p=335}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Buckley444&gt;{{Harvnb|Buckley|2003|p=444}}&lt;/ref&gt; and  [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]] with [[Janis Joplin]],&lt;ref name=Buckley91&gt;{{Harvnb|Buckley|2003|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the then relatively unknown [[Moby Grape]].&lt;ref name=Goswami160&gt;{{Harvnb|Goswami|Dasi|2011|p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Siegel8-10&gt;{{Harvnb|Siegel|2004|pp=8–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bands agreed to appear with Prabhupada and to perform for free; the proceeds were donated to the local Hare Krishna temple.&lt;ref name=ChryssidesWilkins213 /&gt; The participation of countercultural leaders considerably boosted the event's popularity; among them were the poet [[Allen Ginsberg]], who led the singing of the [[Hare Krishna (mantra)|Hare Krishna mantra]] onstage along with Prabhupada, and [[LSD]] promoters [[Timothy Leary]] and [[Owsley Stanley|Augustus Owsley Stanley&amp;nbsp;III]].&lt;ref name=ChryssidesWilkins213 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chryssides173&gt;{{Harvnb|Chryssides|2001|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{Main article|International Society for Krishna Consciousness|A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada}}
[[File:Haight-ashbury modern.jpg|alt= A color photo of a building with 'Haight' and 'Ashbury' signs on opposite sides of its corner|thumb|[[Haight-Ashbury]], 2001]]
[[A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada]] (also referred to as "Bhaktivedanta Swami" or "Prabhupada"), a [[Gaudiya Vaishnava]] [[sannyasa|sannyasi]] and teacher, arrived in New York City from his native India in 1965 and "caught the powerful rising tide" of a [[counterculture]] that was fascinated with his homeland and open to new forms of "consciousness-expanding spirituality."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ellwood|1989|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; After establishing his first American temple in New York City at 26&amp;nbsp;Second Avenue, Prabhupada requested his early follower [[Mukunda Goswami|Mukunda Das]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Didion|1990|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;[[Joan Didion]] in her ''[[Slouching Towards Bethlehem|Slouching towards Bethlehem]]'' includes Mukunda's (referred to as Michael Grant) recollection of his initial involvement with Bhaktivedanta Swami's movement: "I've been associated with the Swami since about last July [of 1966]," Michael says. "See, the Swami came here from India and he was at this ashram in upstate New York and he just kept to himself and chanted a lot. For a couple of months. Pretty soon I helped him get his storefront in New York. Now it's an international movement, which we spread by teaching this chant." Michael is fingering his red wooden beads and I notice that I am the only person in the room with shoes on. "It's catching on like wildfire." ({{Harvnb|Didion|1990|p=119}})&lt;/ref&gt; and his wife Janaki Dasi to open a similar ISKCON center on the [[West Coast of the United States]].&lt;ref name=Muster25&gt;{{Harvnb|Muster|1997|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dasa Goswami|1981|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goswami|Dasi|2011|pp=100–1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mukunda and Janaki met up with friends from college, who would later come to be known as Shyamasundar Das, Gurudas, [[Malati Dasi]], and Yamuna Dasi. Teaming up with them, Mukunda rented a storefront in the San Francisco [[Haight-Ashbury]] neighborhood,&lt;ref name=Knott33&gt;{{Harvnb|Knott|1986|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goswami|Dasi|2011|pp=132–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; which at that time was turning into the hub of the [[hippie]] counterculture, and stayed to take care of the developing new center.&lt;ref name=Muster25 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goswami|Dasi|2011|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada|Prabhupada]] at the [[San Francisco Airport]], {{Nowrap|January 17}}, 1967]]To raise funds, gain supporters for the new temple, and to popularize Prabhupada's teachings among the hippie and countercultural audience of the Haight-Ashbury scene, the team decided to hold a charitable rock concert and invited Prabhupada to attend.&lt;ref name=Greene85 /&gt; Despite his position as a [[Vaishnava]] sannyasi and some of his New York followers objecting to what they saw as an inappropriate invitation of their guru to a place full of "amplified guitars, pounding drums, wild light shows, and hundreds of drugged hippies,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dasa Goswami|1981|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prabhupada agreed to travel from New York to San Francisco and take part in the event.&lt;ref name=Chryssides173 /&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;After observing the event's sensual milieu, Prabhupada remarked, "This is no place for a ''[[brahmacharya|brahmachari]]''." ({{Harvnb|Brooks|1992|p=79}})&lt;/ref&gt; Using their acquaintance with [[Rock Scully]], manager of the [[Grateful Dead]], and [[Sam Andrew]], founding member and guitarist of the [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]]&amp;nbsp;– who were among the most prominent rock bands in California at the time&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name= Schinder335 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Buckley444 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Buckley91 /&gt;– Shyamasundar and Gurudas secured their consent to perform for charity at the concert, charging only the "musicians' union minimum" of $250.&lt;ref name=Siegel8-10 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goswami|Dasi|2011|pp=119, 127}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dasa Goswami|1981|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malati Dasi happened to hear [[Moby Grape]], a relatively unknown group at the time, and she convinced the other team members to invite the band to play at the concert as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goswami|Dasi|2011|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;While sources concur on the appearance of the [[Grateful Dead]], [[Janis Joplin]] with [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]], and [[Moby Grape]] at the Mantra-Rock Dance, some of them also list [[Jefferson Airplane]], [[Quicksilver Messenger Service]], and [[Grace Slick]] among the event's performing musicians. ({{Harvnb|Brooks|1992|p=79}}; {{Harvnb|Chryssides|Wilkins|2006|p=213}}; {{Harvnb|Siegel|2004|pp=8–10}}; and {{Harvnb|Dasa Goswami|1981|p=10}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Another leading countercultural figure, the [[beatnik|beatnik poet]] [[Allen Ginsberg]], was a supporter of Prabhupada. He had met the [[swami]] earlier in New York&lt;ref name=Muster25 /&gt; and assisted him in extending his United States visa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goswami|Dasi|2011|pp=76–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Addressing speculation that he was Ginsberg's guru, Prabhupada answered by saying, "I am nobody's guru. I am everybody's servant. Actually I am not even a servant; a servant of God is no ordinary thing." ({{Harvnb|Greene|2007|p=85}}; {{Harvnb|Goswami|Dasi|2011|pp=196–7}})&lt;/ref&gt; Despite disagreeing with many of Prabhupada's [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness#Four regulative principles|required prohibitions]], especially the ones pertaining to drugs and promiscuity, Ginsberg often publicly sang the [[Hare Krishna (mantra)|Hare Krishna mantra]], which he had learned in India. He made the mantra part of his philosophy&lt;ref name=Brooks78-9&gt;{{Harvnb|Brooks|1992|pp=78–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and declared that it "brings a state of ecstasy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Szatmary|1996|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The following quote from Mukunda in [[Joan Didion]]'s ''[[Slouching Towards Bethlehem|Slouching towards Bethlehem]]'' hints at the difference between Ginsberg's and Bhaktivedanta Swami's perceptions of the [[Hare Krishna (mantra)|Hare Krishna]] chanting: "Ginsberg calls the chant ecstasy, but the Swami says that's not exactly it."({{Harvnb|Didion|1990|pp=119–20}})&lt;/ref&gt; He was glad that Prabhupada, an authentic swami from India, was now trying to spread the chanting in America. Along with other countercultural ideologues like [[Timothy Leary]], [[Gary Snyder]], and [[Alan Watts]], Ginsberg hoped to incorporate Prabhupada and the chanting of Hare Krishna into the hippie movement.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;(from the "Houseboat Summit" panel discussion, [[Sausalito, California|Sausalito, Calif.]], {{Nowrap|February 1967}}, {{Harvnb|Cohen|1991|p=182}}):&lt;br /&gt;
'''Ginsberg:''' So what do you think of Swami Bhaktivedanta pleading for the acceptance of Krishna in every direction?&lt;br /&gt;
'''Snyder:''' Why, it's a lovely positive thing to say Krishna. It's a beautiful mythology and it's a beautiful practice.&lt;br /&gt;
'''Leary:''' Should be encouraged.&lt;br /&gt;
'''Ginsberg:''' He feels it's the one uniting thing. He feels a monopolistic unitary thing about it.&lt;br /&gt;
'''Watts:''' I'll tell you why I think he feels it. The mantras, the images of Krishna have in this culture no foul association.&amp;nbsp;... [W]hen somebody comes in from the Orient with a new religion which hasn't got any of these [horrible] associations in our minds, all the words are new, all the rites are new, and yet, somehow it has feeling in it, and we can get with that, you see, and we can dig that!&lt;/ref&gt; Ginsberg agreed to take part in the Mantra-Rock Dance concert and to introduce the swami to the Haight-Ashbury hippie community.&lt;ref name=Brooks78-9 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ginsberg|Morgan|1986|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The New Science article by Mukunda Das in the San Francisco Oracle, january 1967.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt= A scanned newspaper page with a title "The New Science" and a futuristic drawing of a man|"The New Science" article in the ''[[San Francisco Oracle]]'' (part), {{Nowrap|January 1967}}]]As for the choice of venue, the team considered both the [[The Fillmore|Fillmore Auditorium]] and the [[Avalon Ballroom]], finally settling on the latter as its [[impresario]], [[Chet Helms]], appeared to be "more sympathetic to the spirit of the concert"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goswami|Dasi|2011|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; and agreed to let it be used for a charity event. Artist Harvey Cohen, one of the first ISKCON followers, designed a [[Stanley Mouse]]-inspired promotional poster with a picture of Prabhupada, details of the event, and a request to "bring cushions, drums, bells, cymbals."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goswami|Dasi|2011|pp=141–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; To generate interest among members of the countercultural community of Haight-Ashbury, Mukunda published an article entitled "The New Science" in the ''[[San Francisco Oracle]]'', a local underground newspaper specializing in alternative spiritual and psychedelic topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goswami|Dasi|2011|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Haight-Ashbury district is soon to be honored by the presence of His Holiness, A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami, who will conduct daily classes in the Bhagavad Gita, discussions, chanting, playing instruments, and devotional dancing in a small temple in the neighborhood.&amp;nbsp;... Swamiji's use of the Hare Krishna Mantra is already known throughout the United States. Swamiji's chanting and dancing is more effective than Hatha or Raja Yoga or listening to Ali Akbar Khan on acid or going to a mixed media rock dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cohen|1991|pp=92, 96}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ginsberg helped plan and organize a reception for Prabhupada, who was scheduled to arrive from New York on {{Nowrap|January 17}}, 1967. When the swami arrived at the [[San Francisco International Airport|San Francisco Airport]], 50 to 100 hippies chanting "Hare Krishna" greeted him in the airport lounge with flowers.&lt;ref name=Muster25 /&gt; A few days later the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' published an article entitled "Swami in the Hippie Land" in which Prabhupada answered the question, "Do you accept hippies in your temple?" by saying, "Hippies or anyone&amp;nbsp;– I make no distinctions. Everyone is welcome."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Siegel|2004|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mantra-Rock Dance was scheduled on Sunday evening, {{Nowrap|January 29}}, 1967&amp;nbsp;– a day of the week that Chet Helms deemed odd and unlikely to generate substantial attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goswami|Dasi|2011|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Admission was fixed at $2.50&lt;ref name=ChryssidesWilkins213 /&gt; and limited to door sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goswami|Dasi|2011|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the apprehensions of the organizers, by the beginning of the concert at 8&amp;nbsp;PM an audience of nearly 3,000 had gathered at the Avalon Ballroom,&lt;ref name=Brooks79&gt;{{Harvnb|Brooks|1992|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; filling the hall to its capacity.&lt;ref name=Dasa12&gt;{{Harvnb|Dasa Goswami|1981|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Latecomers had to wait outside for vacancies in order to enter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goswami|Dasi|2011|p=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants were treated on ''[[prasad]]'' (sanctified food) consisting of orange slices&lt;ref name=Siegel8-10 /&gt; and, regardless of the prohibition on drugs, many in the crowd were smoking marijuana and taking other intoxicants.&lt;ref name=Brooks79 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Muster26&gt;{{Harvnb|Muster|1997|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the atmosphere in the hall was peaceful.&lt;ref name=Dasa12 /&gt; Strobe lights and a psychedelic [[liquid light show]], along with pictures of [[Krishna]] and the words of the Hare Krishna mantra, were projected onto the walls.&lt;ref name=Goswami152&gt;{{Harvnb|Goswami|Dasi|2011|p=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few [[Hells Angels]] were positioned in the back of the stage as the event's security guards.&lt;ref name=Siegel8-10 /&gt; Prabhupada's biographer [[Satsvarupa Dasa Goswami]] thus describes the Mantra-Rock Dance audience:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Almost everyone who came wore bright or unusual costumes: tribal robes, Mexican ponchos, Indian ''kurtas'', "God's-eyes," feathers, and beads. Some hippies brought their own flutes, lutes, gourds, drums, rattles, horns, and guitars. The Hell's Angels, dirty-haired, wearing jeans, boots, and denim jackets and accompanied by their women, made their entrance, carrying chains, smoking cigarettes, and displaying their regalia of German helmets, emblazoned emblems, and so on&amp;nbsp;– everything but their motorcycles, which they had parked outside.&lt;ref name=Dasa12 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Avalon Ballroom in San Francisco March 2011.jpg|right|thumb|alt=A color photo of a beige four-storied building with arched windows and ornate roof|The [[Avalon Ballroom]] (''pictured'') served as the Mantra-Rock Dance venue. {{nowrap|Photo: March 2011}}]]The evening opened with Prabhupada's followers&amp;nbsp;– men in "Merlin gowns"&lt;ref name=Goswami152 /&gt; and women in [[sari]]s&amp;nbsp;– chanting Hare Krishna to an Indian tune, followed by Moby Grape.&lt;ref name=Goswami152 /&gt; When the swami himself arrived at 10&amp;nbsp;PM, the crowd of hippies rose to their feet to greet him respectfully with applause and cheers.&lt;ref name=Greene85 /&gt; Gurudas, one of the event's organizers, describes the effect that Prabhupada's arrival had on the audience, "Then Swami Bhaktivedanta entered. He looked like a Vedic sage, exalted and otherworldly. As he advanced towards the stage, the crowd parted and made way for him, like the surfer riding a wave. He glided onto the stage, sat down and began playing the kartals."&lt;ref name=Siegel8-10 /&gt;

Ginsberg welcomed Prabhupada onto the stage and spoke of his own experiences chanting the Hare Krishna mantra. He translated the meaning of the [[Sanskrit]] term ''mantra'' as "mind deliverance" and recommended the early-morning [[kirtan]]s at the local [[Radha Krishna Temple|Radha-Krishna temple]] "for those coming down from LSD who want to stabilize their consciousness upon reentry," calling the temple's activity an "important community service." He introduced Prabhupada and thanked him for leaving his peaceful life in India to bring the mantra to New York's [[Lower East Side]], "where it was probably most needed."&lt;ref name=ChryssidesWilkins213 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Greene85 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goswami|Dasi|2011|p=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a short address by Prabhupada, Ginsberg sang "Hare Krishna" to the accompaniment of [[sitar]], [[Tanpura (instrument)|tambura]], and drums, requesting the audience to "[j]ust sink into the sound vibration, and think of peace."&lt;ref name=Siegel8-10 /&gt; Then Prabhupada stood up and led the audience in dancing and singing, as the Grateful Dead, Big Brother and the Holding Company, and Moby Grape joined the chanting and accompanied the mantra with their musical instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Spörke|2003|p=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tuedio|Spector|2010|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Joplin|1992|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; The audience eagerly responded, playing their own instruments and dancing in circles. The group chanting continued for almost two hours, and concluded with the swami's prayers in Sanskrit while the audience bowed down on the floor. After Prabhupada left, Janis Joplin took the stage, backed by Big Brother and the Holding Company, and continued the event with the songs "[[The House of the Rising Sun]]" and "[[Ball 'n' Chain]]" late into the night.&lt;ref name=Siegel8-10 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goswami|Dasi|2011|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada|Prabhupada]]  chanting in [[Golden Gate Park]], San Francisco, with an icon of the deity [[Jagannath]] to his right. {{Nowrap|February 1967}}]]The [[LSD]] pioneer [[Timothy Leary]], who made an appearance at the Mantra-Rock Dance along with [[Owsley Stanley|Augustus Owsley Stanley&amp;nbsp;III]] and even paid the entrance fee,&lt;ref name=ChryssidesWilkins213 /&gt; pronounced the event a "beautiful night".&lt;ref name=Muster26 /&gt; Later Ginsberg called the Mantra-Rock Dance "the height of Haight-Ashbury spiritual enthusiasm, the first time that there had been a music scene in San Francisco where everybody could be part of it and participate,"&lt;ref name=Greene85 /&gt; while historians referred to it as "the ultimate high"&lt;ref name=Greene85 /&gt;&lt;ref name=EllwoodPartin68 /&gt; and "the major spiritual event of the San Francisco hippy era."&lt;ref name=ChryssidesWilkins213 /&gt;

Moby Grape's performance at the Mantra-Rock Dance catapulted the band onto the professional stage. They subsequently had [[Gig (musical performance)|gigs]] with [[The Doors]] at the Avalon Ballroom and at the "First Love Circus" at the [[Winterland Ballroom|Winterland Arena]], and were soon signed to a contract with [[Columbia Records]].&lt;ref name=Goswami160 /&gt;

Prabhupada's appearance at the Mantra-Rock Dance made such a deep impact on the Haight-Ashbury community that he became a cult hero to most of its groups and members, regardless of their attitudes towards his philosophy or the life restrictions that he taught.&lt;ref name=Brooks79-80&gt;{{Harvnb|Brooks|1992|pp=79–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hare Krishna mantra and dancing became adopted in some ways by all levels of the counterculture, including the Hells Angels,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Oakes|1969|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and provided it with a "loose commonality" and reconciliation,&lt;ref name=Brooks79-80 /&gt; as well as with a viable alternative to drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ellwood|1989|pp=106–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Hare Krishna movement's popularity with the Haight-Ashbury community continued to increase, Prabhupada and followers chanting and distributing ''prasad'' became a customary sight at important events in the locale.&lt;ref name=Chryssides173 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Brooks79 /&gt;

At the same time, as the core group of his followers continued to expand and become more serious about the spiritual discipline, Prabhupada conducted new Vaishnava [[diksha|initiations]] and named the San Francisco temple "New [[Puri|Jagannatha Puri]]" after introducing the worship of [[Jagannath]] [[murti|deities]] of Krishna there.&lt;ref name=Knott33 /&gt; Small replicas of these deities immediately became a "psychedelic hit" worn by many hippies on strings around their necks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brooks|1992|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the Mantra-Rock Dance brought the Hare Krishna movement to the wider attention of the American public,&lt;ref name=Chryssides173 /&gt; Prabhupada's increased popularity attracted the interest of the mainstream media. Most notably, he was interviewed on [[American Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]'s ''[[Les Crane#Television|The Les Crane Show]]'' and lectured on the philosophy of Krishna consciousness on a [[KPFK]] radio station program hosted by [[Peter Bergman (comedian)|Peter Bergman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goswami|Dasi|2011|pp=262, 277}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prabhupada's followers also spoke about their activities on the San Francisco radio station [[KFRC (defunct)|KFRC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goswami|Dasi|2011|p=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 18, 2007, a free commemorative event dedicated to the 40th anniversary of the Mantra-Rock Dance was held at the [[People's Park (Berkeley)|People's Park]] in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], California.&lt;ref name=BerkeleyDP /&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and medical uses --&gt;
'''Metamizole''' or '''dipyrone''', is a [[analgesic|painkiller]], [[antispasmodic|spasm reliever]] and [[antipyretic|fever reliever]]. Like [[paracetamol]], it has minimal [[anti-inflammatory]] effects. It is most commonly given by mouth or by injection.&lt;ref name = SPC/&gt;&lt;ref name = deranaes2008&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jage|first1=J|last2=Laufenberg-Feldmann |first2=R |last3=Heid |first3=F|title=Medikamente zur postoperativen Schmerztherapie: Bewährtes und Neues|trans-title=Drugs for postoperative analgesia: routine and new aspects.

&lt;!-- Side effects and mechanism --&gt;
Although it is still available [[over-the-counter]] in some countries, it is prescription or banned in other countries, due to its potential for adverse events, including [[agranulocytosis]].&lt;ref name = deranaes2004/&gt; It is in the [[ampyrone]] [[sulfonate]] family of medicines.

&lt;!-- History and culture --&gt;
It was first used medically in [[Germany]] in 1922 under the brandname "Novalgin" and for many years it was available [[over-the-counter]] in most countries, until its toxicities became apparent.&lt;ref name="UNList"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs]] |title=Consolidated List of Products Whose Consumption and/or Sale Have Been Banned, Withdrawn, Severely Restricted of Not Approved by Governments |edition=12th |pages=171–5 |publisher=United Nations |location=New York |year=2005 |url=https://www.un.org/esa/coordination/CL12.pdf |accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Metamizole is marketed under various trade names.&lt;ref name=drugsInternational/&gt;&lt;ref name = MD&gt;{{cite web|title=Dipyrone|work=Martindale: The Complete Drug Reference|publisher=Pharmaceutical Press|date=13 December 2013|accessdate=19 April 2014|url=http://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/martindale/current/2638-f.htm|editor=Brayfield, A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical uses==
It is primarily used for perioperative pain, acute injury, [[colic]], cancer pain, other acute/chronic forms of pain and high fever unresponsive to other agents.&lt;ref name = SPC/&gt;

===Special populations===
Its use in pregnancy is advised against, although animal studies are reassuring in that they show minimal risk of birth defects; its use in the elderly or those with liver/kidney impairment is advised against, but if these groups of people must be treated a lower dose and caution is usually advised; its use in lactation is advised against as it is excreted in breast milk.&lt;ref name = SPC/&gt;

==Adverse effects==
Metamizole has a potential of blood-related toxicity (blood [[dyscrasia]]s), but causes less [[renal|kidney]], [[cardiovascular]], and GI toxicity than [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]] (NSAIDs).&lt;ref name = deranaes2008/&gt; Like NSAIDs, it can trigger bronchospasm or [[anaphylaxis]], especially in those with [[asthma]].&lt;ref name=deranaes2004&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brack |first1=A |last2=Rittner |first2=HL |last3=Schäfer |first3=M|title=Nichtopioidanalgetika zur perioperativen Schmerztherapie |trans-title=Non-opioid analgesics for perioperative pain therapy. Risks and rational basis for use |journal=Der Anaesthesist |language=German |date=March 2004 |volume=53 |issue=3 |pages=263–80 |doi=10.1007/s00101-003-0641-5 |pmid=15021958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Serious side effects include [[agranulocytosis]], [[aplastic anaemia]], hypersensitivity reactions (like [[anaphylaxis]] and [[bronchospasm]]), [[toxic epidermal necrolysis]] and it may provoke acute attacks of [[porphyria]], as it is chemically related to the [[sulfonamide]]s.&lt;ref name = MD/&gt;&lt;ref name = deranaes2008/&gt;&lt;ref name = deranaes2004/&gt; The relative risk for agranulocytosis appears to greatly vary according to the country of estimates on said rate and opinion on the risk is strongly divided.&lt;ref name = MD/&gt;&lt;ref name=CurrOpAnesth2014rev&gt;Pogatzki-Zahn E, Chandrasena C, Schug SA. Nonopioid analgesics for postoperative pain management. Curr Opin Anesthesiol. 2014 Oct;27(5):513-9. {{PMID|25102238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contraindications===
Previous hypersensitivity (such as [[agranulocytosis]] or [[anaphylaxis]]) to metamizole or any of the [[excipients]] (e.g. [[lactose]]) in the preparation used, acute [[porphyria]], impaired [[haematopoiesis]] (such as due to treatment with [[chemotherapy]] agents), third trimester of pregnancy (potential for adverse effects in the newborn), lactation, children with a body weight below 16&amp;nbsp;kg, history of aspirin-induced asthma and other hypersensitivity reactions to analgesics.&lt;ref name = SPC/&gt;

Oral [[anticoagulants]] (blood thinners), [[lithium (medication)|lithium]], [[captopril]], [[triamterene]] and [[antihypertensive]]s may also interact with metamizole, as other [[pyrazolone]]s are known to interact adversely with these substances.

===Overdose===
It is considered fairly safe on overdose, but in these cases supportive measures are usually advised as well as measures to limit absorption (such as [[activated charcoal]]) and accelerate excretion (such as [[haemodialysis]]).&lt;ref name = SPC&gt;{{cite web|title=Fachinformation (Zusammenfassung der Merkmale des Arzneimittels) Novaminsulfon injekt 1000 mg Lichtenstein Novaminsulfon injekt 2500 mg Lichtenstein|url=https://www.zentiva.de/-/media/files/zentivade/produkte/novaminsulfon-lichtenstein/_de_gif_novaminsulfon_injekt_2500mg.pdf|language=German|date=February 2013|accessdate=19 April 2014|work=Winthrop Arzneimittel GmbH|publisher=Zinteva Pharm GmbH}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physicochemistry==
It is a sulfonic acid and comes in [[calcium]], [[sodium]] and [[magnesium]] salt forms.&lt;ref name = MD/&gt; Its sodium salt [[monohydrate]] form is a white/almost crystalline powder that is unstable in the presence of light, highly soluble in [[water]] and [[ethanol]] but practically insoluble in [[dichloromethane]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Council of Europe |author2=Council of Europe.

==Pharmacology==
Its precise mechanism of action is unknown, although it is believed that inhibiting [[central nervous system|brain and spinal cord]] [[prostaglandin]] (fat-like molecules that are involved in inflammation, pain and fever) synthesis might be involved.&lt;ref name = deranaes2004/&gt; Recently, researchers uncovered another potential mechanism involving metamizole being a [[prodrug]]. In this proposal, not yet verified by other researchers, the metamizole itself breaks down into other chemicals that are the actual active agents. The result is a couple of [[cannabinoid]] and NSAID [[arachidonic acid]] conjugates{{clarify|date=April 2014}}&lt;!--what *are* they if they're not what this word actually means?--&gt; (although not in the strict [[Conjugated system|chemical meaning of the word]]) of metamizole's breakdown products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jasiecka|first1=A|last2=Maślanka |first2=T |last3=Jaroszewski |first3=JJ|title=Pharmacological characteristics of metamizole|journal=Polish Journal of Veterinary Sciences|date=2014|volume=17|issue=1|pages=207–14|pmid=24724493 |doi=10.2478/pjvs-2014-0030}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this studies in animals have found that the [[Cannabinoid receptor type 1|CB1 cannabinoid receptor]] is not involved in the analgesia induced by metamizole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elmas|first1=P|last2=Ulugol |first2=A|title=Involvement of cannabinoid CB1 receptors in the antinociceptive effect of dipyrone|journal=Journal of Neural Transmission|date=November 2013|volume=120|issue=11|pages=1533–8|doi=10.1007/s00702-013-1052-7|pmid=23784345}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it seems to inhibit fevers caused by prostaglandins, especially [[prostaglandin E2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Malvar|first1=DD|last2=Aguiar |first2=FA |last3=Vaz |first3=AD |last4=Assis |first4=DC |last5=de Melo |first5=MC |last6=Jabor |first6=VA |last7=Kalapothakis, |first7=E |last8=Ferreira |first8=SH |last9=Clososki |first9=GC |last10=de Souza |first10=GE|title=The dipyrone metabolite 4-MAA induces hypothermia and inhibits PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-dependent and -independent fever while 4-AA only blocks PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; -dependent fever|journal=British Journal of Pharmacology|date=April 2014|doi=10.1111/bph.12717|pmid=24712707 |volume=171 |issue=15 |pages=3666–79|pmc=4128064}}&lt;/ref&gt; It appears to produce its therapeutic effects by means of its metabolites, especially ''N''-methyl-4-aminoantipyrine (MAA) and 4-aminoantipyrine (AA).&lt;ref name = SPC/&gt;

==History==
[[Ludwig Knorr]] was a student of [[Hermann Emil Fischer|Emil Fischer]] who won the Nobel Prize for his work on purines and sugars, which included the discovery of [[phenylhydrazine]].&lt;ref name=Brune&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S1366-0071(97)80033-2 | title = The early history of non-opioid analgesics | year = 1997 | last1 = Brune | first1 = K | journal = Acute Pain | volume = 1 | pages = 33 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nobel Committee [https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1902/fischer-bio.html Emil Fischer – Biographical]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1880s, Knorr was trying to make [[quinolone]] derivatives from phenylhydrazine, and instead made a [[pyrazole]] derivative, which after a methylation, he made into [[phenazone]], also called antipyrine, which has been called "the 'mother' of all modern antipyretic analgesics."&lt;ref name=Brune/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ravina&gt;Enrique Ravina. The Evolution of Drug Discovery: From Traditional Medicines to Modern Drugs. John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2011 {{ISBN|9783527326693}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|26–27}}  Sales of that drug exploded, and in the 1890s chemists at Teerfarbenfabrik Meister, Lucius &amp; Co. (a precursor of [[Hoechst AG]] which is now [[Sanofi]]), made another derivative called [[pyramidon]] which was three times more active than antipyrine.&lt;ref name=Brune/&gt;

In 1893, a derivative of antipyrine, [[aminopyrine]], was made by [[Friedrich Stolz]] at Hoechst.&lt;ref name=Ravina/&gt;{{rp|26–27}}  Yet later, chemists at Hoechst made a derivative, melubrine (sodium antipyrine aminomethanesulfonate), which was introduced in 1913,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xZw1AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA869#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false New and Nonofficial Remedies: Melubrine]. JAMA 61(11):869. 1913&lt;/ref&gt; and yet later metamizole was synthesized; metamizole is a methyl derivative of melubrine and is also a more soluble prodrug of pyramidon.&lt;ref name=Brune/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ravina/&gt;{{rp|26–27}} Metamizole was first marketed in Germany as "Novalgin" in 1922.&lt;ref name=Brune/&gt;

The '''Mid Atlantic Star Party''' ('''MASP''') was an annual regional gathering of amateur [[astronomer]]s ([[star party]]) held each fall around October near [[Robbins, North Carolina]]. 

==History==
First held in 1995, MASP is located in one of the darkest spots along the eastern U.S. coast and is the largest annual gathering of amateur astronomers between [[Vermont]]'s [[Stellafane]] and [[Florida]]'s [[Winter Star Party]].&lt;ref name="masp"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://masp.us/about.htm |title=About MASP |accessdate=2007-03-23 |work=Mid-Atlantic Star Party }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7078">'''Midgetville''' (also known as "tiny towns") refers to real or legendary communities of "[[midget]]s", people with forms of dwarfism who are normally proportioned, or collections of small "midget-sized" houses. Real or legendary, they are at times given fanciful qualities, see [[Little people (mythology)]]. Some "real" ones may play on mythology for tourism purposes. Hence some descriptions are not meant to imply anything concerning ordinary or real people with [[dwarfism]].

== Fairfax County, Virginia ==
The "Midgetville" in [[Vienna, Virginia]], visible from the [[Washington &amp; Old Dominion Railroad Regional Park|W&amp;OD Trail]], was a collection of six small cottages that were torn down in 2008.  In 1882 the site was a small summertime resort that people visited when they wanted to escape the stressful lifestyle of Washington, D.C. In 1892 the area was purchased by Alexander Wedderburn. In 1901 the hotel burned to the ground, but a normal-sized two-story building was built around the same time at the corner of the property. In 1930, one of Alexander Wedderburn's sons, George, built six small Spanish-style cottages. A courtyard in the middle of the property was sometimes used as a fairground or a farmers' market. The Wedderburns briefly established the Wedderburn Music School on the site. The cottages were rented out but the place eventually became overgrown with ivy and trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bahr | first = Jeff | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Weird Virginia | publisher = Sterlng Publishing | year = 2007 | location = New York, New York | pages = 47–49 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-4027-3942-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 the family signed a deal with contractors to tear the place down and develop the property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Jacqueline L. | last=Salmon | coauthors= | title=Emotional Investment: A Family's Decision to Sell Vienna's 'Midgetville' Ignites Bitter Opposition | date=August 26, 2004 | publisher= | url =https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A31856-2004Aug25.html | work =Washington Post | pages =VA16 | accessdate = 2007-10-21 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the proposal created some controversy, the [[Fairfax County Board of Supervisors]] voted to approve the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Lisa | last= Rein | title=Fairfax Maps Tourist Gems | date=September 27, 2005 | work=Washington Post |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/26/AR2005092601584.html | pages=B04 | accessdate=2008-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The cottages were all destroyed and the trees were removed in early 2008 to make way for "Wedderburn Estates."

The local legend is bolstered by two coincidences. Nearby [[Bailey's Crossroads, Virginia|Bailey's Crossroads]], named for the Bailey family of [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus|Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus]], was used as a place to winter circus animals in the mid-1800s. Also, nearby [[Tysons Corner, Virginia|Tysons Corner]] is the home of one of the Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus headquarters. Those two facts are often used to substantiate the legend that Midgetville was a retirement village for circus midgets. The legend is sometimes told with the midgets being xenophobic and throwing rocks at curious visitors to chase them away.

== Jefferson Township, New Jersey ==
Located near Milton, [[Jefferson Township, New Jersey]] has been the subject of urban legends about a Midgetville community. The houses are located on a secluded dirt road.  There are at least six small houses with small doors, small windows and small furniture inside. Some have very ornate exterior decorations.  There is one average-sized house on the grounds, inhabited by an elderly, average height couple.

Rumor has held that Alfred Ringling, famous for the [[Ringling Brothers Circus]], built a few small-sized houses that had four-foot doors. However, the houses currently all appear to be built within the last 40 years and some are built with vinyl siding which was not available during Ringling's time. Visitors claim the "midget" residents are hostile or xenophobic and will therefore shoot guns at outsiders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdnj.com/stories/_roadside04.asp |title=Weird new Jersey |accessdate=2008-05-26 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404040104/http://www.weirdnj.com/stories/_roadside04.asp |archivedate=2008-04-04 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Long Beach, California ==
[[Image:La Linda North West view.JPG|left|150px|thumb|La Linda Drive looking North West from the entrance.]] An [[urban legend]] holds that with the success of the 1939 [[Cinema of the United States|American]] musical [[fantasy film]] ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]],'' many of the [[Midget|little people]] who had acquired their wealth by playing the roles of the [[Munchkins]] purchased lots in the La Linda development of Long Beach and built homes sized to suit their needs. La Linda affectionately became known as "Midget Town" and the proximity of the La Linda development to the studios allowed them to work many supporting casts in the movies from the 1940s on.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzaga, Samantha.

== Mississauga, Ontario ==

In 1945, the [[Slovak Canadian Cultural Society]] established a secluded community cottage site near [[Streetsville, Ontario]] at Barbertown, now part of [[Mississauga, Ontario]]. The remoteness, small structures, and fencing led some locals to believe it was a Midgetville.

== Kunming, China ==
In China a "[[Kingdom of the Little People]]" with fairytale houses is set to become an attraction. This has caused controversy as being "a [[freak show]]", but has defenders who feel that this might be the best chance some of these people have to be employed and independent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/article-1217380/Dwarf-theme-park-opens-China-tourists.html Daily Mail]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Military Order of the Stars and Bars.png|right|thumb|Logo of Military Order of the Stars and Bars]]
The '''Military Order of the Stars and Bars''' is a [[fraternal organization]] for documented descendants of men who served as [[commissioned officer]]s in the [[armed forces]] of the [[Confederate States of America]] or who are descended from members of the Confederate Congress, or any elected or appointed member of the Executive Branch of the Confederate Government. Membership is open to males  who are direct or collateral descendants of Confederate Officers who served honorably in the Confederate military, elected or appointed civilian officials of the individual Confederate States, officials of the Confederate National government, and officials of the Five Civilized Tribes that allied with the Confederacy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.militaryorderofthestarsandbars.org/join-us/&lt;/ref&gt;  Members may join local chapters as well as state societies or be a national at-large member, with the organization working as a [[lineage society]].

==History==
Founded in 1938 in [[Columbia, South Carolina]], during the [[Great Depression]], it is the only active heritage organization created by Confederate veterans.{{cn|date=January 2013}} The first meeting was convened by 17 former Confederate officers, with 47 male descendants of Confederate officers in attendance. They voted to begin a new CSA veterans society, with a commitment to hold annual meetings, and chose the name of the "Order of the Stars &amp; Bars". The OSB was unique in its understanding that as the original Confederate officers died, their male descendants had to carry on the purposes of the order.

In 1976 the organization changed its name to "The Military Order of the Stars &amp; Bars" at the 39th General Convention held in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. They adopted the [[Flags_of_the_Confederate_States_of_America#Battle_flag|Confederate battle flag]] (the square "Southern Cross" incorporated into the second and third National Flags of the Confederate States of America, not to be confused with the "[[Flags of the Confederate States of America|Stars and Bars]]" adopted as the first national flag) as the official insignia of the order. The leader would be called the commander general of the Military Order of the Stars and Bars.

Today the fraternal Military Order of the Stars and Bars is a non-profit 501(c) 3, non-political educational, historical, patriotic, and heritage group that is dedicated to preserving Southern history. It has added programs to recognize outstanding contributions in the fields of American history, as well as the fine arts that emphasize Southern culture. 

It offers college scholarships and awards for the study and communication of Confederate and American history. It awards literary prizes to authors and publishing houses, and recognizes journalists who practice ethical reporting of local and Southern history. It erects monuments to the memory of the CSA soldiers. The organization emphasizes American patriotism and the honoring of all American military veterans of all wars. The order emphasizes family and tradition, and encourages its membership to preserve their family's Confederate history for posterity.

The '''Ramstein air show disaster''' occurred on Sunday, 28 August 1988 during the ''[[Flugtag]] '88'' airshow at the [[United States]]'s [[Ramstein Air Base]] near [[Kaiserslautern]], [[West Germany]]. 

Three aircraft of the [[Frecce Tricolori|Italian Air Force display team]] collided during their display, crashing to the ground in front of a crowd of about 300,000 people. There were 70 fatalities (67 spectators and 3 pilots); 346 spectators sustained serious injuries in the resulting explosion and fire, and hundreds more had minor injuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stripes.com/news/1988-ramstein-air-crash-stirs-memories-1.82371 1988 Ramstein air crash stirs memories], www.stripes.com&lt;/ref&gt;
At the time it was the deadliest [[List of air show accidents and incidents|air show accident]] in history (until overtaken in 2002 by the [[Sknyliv air show disaster]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/07/28/ukraine.detained/index.html 4 held over worst air show crash], ''CNN World''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Ten [[Aermacchi MB-339]] PAN jets from the [[Aeronautica Militare|Italian Air Force]] display team, [[Frecce Tricolori]], were performing their "pierced heart" (Italian: ''Cardioide'', German: ''Durchstoßenes Herz'') formation. In this formation, two groups of aircraft create a heart shape in front of the audience along the runway. In the completion of the lower tip of the heart, the two groups pass each other parallel to the runway. The heart is then pierced, in the direction of the audience, by a lone aircraft.

== The crash ==
The [[mid-air collision]] took place as the two heart-forming groups passed each other and the heart-piercing aircraft hit them. The piercing aircraft crashed onto the runway and consequently both the fuselage and resulting fireball of [[aviation fuel]] tumbled into the spectator area, hitting the crowd and coming to rest against a refrigerated trailer being used to dispense ice cream to the various vendor booths in the area.

At the same time, one of the damaged aircraft from the heart-forming group crashed into the [[MEDEVAC|emergency medical evacuation]] [[UH-60 Black Hawk]] helicopter, injuring the helicopter's pilot, Captain Kim Strader. He died 20 days later, on Saturday, 17 September 1988, at [[Brooke Army Medical Center]] in [[Texas]] from burns he suffered in the accident.

The pilot of the aircraft that hit the helicopter [[Ejection seat|ejected]], but was killed as he hit the runway before his [[parachute]] opened. The third aircraft disintegrated in the collision and parts of it were strewn along the runway.

After the crash, the remaining aircraft regrouped and landed at [[Sembach Air Base]].

==Emergency response==
===Scope ===
Of the 31 people who died on impact, 28 had been hit by debris in the form of airplane parts, [[concertina wire]], and items on the ground.&lt;ref name=ppis&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ppis.de/ramstein-katastrophe |author=Ramstein survivor support group|title=Ramstein-Katastrophe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sixteen of the fatalities occurred in the days and weeks after the disaster due to [[Burn (injury)|severe burns]]; the last was the burned and injured helicopter pilot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/17433/SL-ARMY-OFFICER-BURNED-IN-AIR-SHOW-CRASH-DIES.html |title=SL Army officer burned in air show crash dies|work=Deseret News}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 500 people had to seek hospital treatment following the event,{{cn|date=May 2016}} and over 600 people reported to the clinic that afternoon to donate blood.{{cn|date=May 2016}}

===Critiques===
The disaster revealed serious shortcomings in the handling of large-scale medical emergencies by German civil and American military authorities. US military personnel did not immediately allow German ambulances onto the base, and the rescue work was generally hampered by a lack of efficiency and coordination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/thisdayintech/2009/08/0828ramstein-air-disaster/ |title=Ramstein Air Show Disaster Kills 70, Injures Hundreds|work=Wired|date=August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rescue coordination center in [[Kaiserslautern]] was unaware of the disaster's scale as much as an hour after it occurred, even though several German [[medevac]] helicopters and ambulances had already arrived on site and left with patients. American helicopters and ambulances provided the quickest and largest means of evacuating burn victims, but lacked sufficient capacities for treating them, or had difficulty finding them. Further confusion was added by the American military's usage of different standards for [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous]] [[catheter]]s from German paramedics. (A single standard was codified in 1995 and updated with a newer version in 2013).&lt;ref name="ISO Standard for Medical Catheters"&gt;[http://www.webstore.ansi.org/RecordDetail.aspx?sku=ISO+10555-1%3a2013 ISO 10555-1:2013 Intravascular catheters – Sterile and single-use catheters – Part 1: General requirements&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Actions===
A crisis counseling center was immediately established at the nearby Southside Base Chapel and remained open throughout the week. Base mental health professionals provided group and individual counseling in the following weeks, and they surveyed the response workers two months following the tragedy and again six months after the disaster to gauge recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&amp;AD=ADA225911|title= Trauma, Disasters and Recovery|authors=Ursano, Robert J., M.D. (Editor) &amp; Fullerton, Carol S.

They told us nobody from them are here no more. Not all the injured people are transported away by helicopter or ambulance. There is total chaos around us and some of the injured are even transported on Pick Up trucks that are not leaving on emergency exit, they are driving beside the drifting visitors.

We don't know yet what had happened, how many injuries and what else. The leading emergency medical did not send any feedback yet. He wants to have a synoptic view first"
|-
| 17:00
| At that time several medics arrive with helicopters. Later they said:&lt;br /&gt; "At the time we arrived shortly after 5:00 there were no injured people no more. We could see that the last badly injured people were loaded into American helicopters. We could see some Pick Up trucks with injured people transporting them away. It was not possible to find an officer in charge, a director of operations or even a contact person [...] so we got to the Johannis hospital in Landstuhl by own initiative. Asking several action forces, paramedics, police officers nobody could name a director of operations. I was asking for a managing paramedic of the operation to coordinate the evacuation. But there was none."
|-
| 18:05
| An ambulance helicopter arrives at the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center. The paramedic said later:&lt;br /&gt; "We found a large number of severely burnt, badly injured people absolutely unaided. [...] When I arrived in Landstuhl, severely burnt people partly lay on wooden planks and no paramedics were there. After I aided an injured person and left her with a hospital nurse that attended us at the flight, I was treating several injured people at the helicopter landing zone at the military hospital and did not see even one American medic there"

| A bus full of injured people arrives in Ludwigshafen (80&amp;nbsp;km away). A paramedic later said:&lt;br /&gt; "5 severely burnt people were inside the bus. There was no paramedic attending this transport. Just a non-German speaking driver unfamiliar with the area, on an odyssey through the town until he was able to find the hospital."

==Investigation==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2011}}
Several different video recordings of the accident were taped. They show that the "piercing" aircraft (Pony 10) came in too low and too fast at the crossing point with the other two groups (five aircraft on the left and four on the right) as they completed the heart-shaped figure. Lead pilot Lieutenant Colonel Ivo Nutarelli, flying Pony 10, was unable to correct his altitude or lower his speed, and collided with the leading airplane (Pony 1, piloted by Lt. Col. Mario Naldini) of the left formation "inside" the figure, destroying the plane's tail section with the front of his aircraft.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Pony 1 then spiralled out of control, hitting the plane on its lower left (Pony 2, piloted by Captain Giorgio Alessio). Lt. Col. Naldini ejected but was killed as he hit the runway before his parachute opened. His plane crashed onto a taxiway near the runway, destroying a medevac helicopter and fatally injuring its pilot, Captain Kim Strader. Pony 2, the third plane involved in the disaster, was severely damaged from the impact with Pony 1, and crashed beside the runway, exploding in a fireball. Its pilot, Captain Alessio, died on impact.

Pony 10, the aircraft that started the crash, continued on a ballistic trajectory across the runway, completely out of control and in flames, its forward section destroyed by the impact with Pony 1. The plane hit the ground ahead of the spectator stands, exploding in a fireball and destroying a police vehicle parked inside the concertina-wire fence that defined the active runway area. The plane continued, cartwheeling for a distance before picking up the three-strand concertina-wire fence, crossing an emergency access road, slamming into the crowd, and hitting a parked ice cream van. The area of the crash, being centered on the flightline and as close to the airshow as civilian spectators could get, had been considered the "best seats in the house", and was densely packed. The entire incident, from the collision of the first two planes to the crash into the crowd, took less than seven seconds, leaving almost no time for spectators to escape. The low altitude of the maneuver (45 meters above the crowd) also contributed to the short time frame.

An examination of photos and footage from the disaster showed that Pony 10's landing gear came down at some point; it has been suggested that this could have been lowered intentionally as a last second effort by Lt. Col. Nutarelli to slow his plane down and avoid the impact, but there is no substantial evidence pointing to this; the undercarriage could have been lowered by a number of factors. In January 1991, Werner Reith, a German journalist from the newspaper ''[[Tageszeitung]]'', suggested in an article that the Ramstein disaster could have been caused by some sudden technical problem—or even sabotage—in Nutarelli's plane. No supporting evidence could be collected. Reith pointed out that Lt. Col. Nutarelli and Lt. Col. Naldini were supposed to know details about another air disaster, the 1980 [[Ustica massacre]], citing Italian press sources. Judge Rosario Priore, who was investigating the case at the time, found that they were performing training flights nearby minutes before the Ustica incident, but he definitely rejected their deaths as sabotage.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2222">The '''Red Stick International Animation Festival''' is an annual event is hosted by the Lab for Creative Arts &amp; Technologies (LCAT), a research group within the [[Louisiana State University]]'s [[Center for Computation and Technology]].  The first festival took place from April 21 until April 23, 2005, and has occurred annually since in the Downtown Arts District in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]].  The 2005 festival drew over 1200 attendees.  In 2006, just over 2000 people attended, and in 2007, over 4000 people attended festival events. {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

==History==

The festival was founded by Stephen David Beck and Stacey Simmons, bringing an idea from the [[Animex | Animex festival]] in England, as a way to demonstrate the linkage between creativity and technology, their focus at LCAT, and to bring awareness to the opportunities in both creative and technical disciplines for jobs, careers and economic development that are available through entertainment technologies.  The name "Red Stick" is the literal English translation of [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]], where the festival is held.

Planning for the first festival began in the fall of 2003, with the event taking place in April 2005.  Since then, the festival has occurred annually in the third week of April.

Speakers and workshop leaders at past festivals have included representatives from Disney, Pixar, DreamWorks, Digital Domain, Sony Imageworks and other companies.  They include Ed Hooks, Stuart Sumida, Mark Walsh, Walt Hyneman, David Bolinsky, Karen deJong, Gary Schwartz, and Rachelle Lewis. {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

The Red Stick Festival takes place at the Louisiana Art &amp; Science Museum, Old State Capitol, and the LSU Museum of Art and Manship Theatre, part of the [[Shaw Center for the Arts]].

[[File:RickRoll.png|thumb|250px|A still frame from the music video of the song "[[Never Gonna Give You Up]]" by [[Rick Astley]] on [[YouTube]], taken in 2008.]]

'''Rickrolling''', alternatively '''rick-rolling''', is a [[prank]] and an [[Internet meme]] involving an unexpected appearance of the [[music video]] for the 1987 [[Rick Astley]] song "[[Never Gonna Give You Up]]". The meme is a type of [[bait and switch]] using a disguised [[hyperlink]] that leads to the music video. The victims, believing that they are accessing some unrelated material, are said to have been ''rickrolled''.&lt;ref name="knowyourmeme"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/rickroll|title = Rickroll|publisher = Cheezburger, Inc.|date = 2015|author = Jamie Dubs|others = Triple Zed|accessdate = 2016-08-03|archiveurl = https://archive.is/20160401063931/http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/rickroll|archivedate = 1 April 2016|deadurl = yes|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trend has extended to disruptive or humorous appearances of the song in other situations, such as a live appearance of Astley himself in the 2008 [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]] in New York.&lt;ref name="telegraph-macys"&gt;{{cite news |date=28 November 2008 |publisher=The Daily Telegraph |last=Moore |first=Matthew |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/3534073/Macys-Thanksgiving-Day-parade-Rick-Astley-performs-his-own-Rickroll.html |title=Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade: Rick Astley performs his own Rickroll |accessdate=2 December 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Astley recorded "Never Gonna Give You Up" on his 1987 album ''[[Whenever You Need Somebody]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r941|pure_url=yes}} |title=''Whenever You Need Somebody'' review |accessdate=18 November 2008 |last=Henderson |first=Alex |work=[[Allmusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song, his solo debut single, was a number-one hit on several international charts, including the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks]] and [[UK Singles Chart]]. As a means of promoting the song, it was also made into Astley's first music video, which features him performing the song while dancing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/internetNews/idUKN0421297720080405 |title='80s singer Rick Astley latest Web phenomenon |accessdate=19 November 2008 |last=Hasty |first=Katie |date=5 April 2008 |work=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rickrolling was reported to have begun as a variant of an earlier prank from the [[imageboard]] [[4chan]] known as ''duckrolling''.  The director of the site, who went by the name "[[Christopher Poole|moot]]", started replacing occurrences of the word "egg" on the site with the word "duck".  When the word "eggroll" was turned into "duckroll", other users started changing innocent looking links going somewhere (such as to a specific picture or news item) to redirect readers to a thread or site containing an [[photo manipulation|edited]] picture of a duck with wheels.  The user at that point is said to have been "duckrolled".&lt;ref name="knowyourmeme"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hoaxonwheels"&gt;{{cite news |work=Fox News Channel |publisher=[[Fox News Channel]] |date=22 April 2008 |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,352010,00.html |title=The Biggest Little Internet Hoax on Wheels Hits Mainstream |accessdate=22 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{listen|filename=Rick Astley - Never Gonna Give You Up.ogg|pos=left|title=Rick Astley – Never Gonna Give You Up}}
The first known instance of a rickroll occurred in May 2007 on /v/, [[4chan]]'s video game board, where a link to the Rick Astley video was claimed to be a mirror of the first trailer for ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'' (which was unavailable due to heavy traffic). The joke was confined to 4chan for a very brief period.&lt;ref name="knowyourmeme"/&gt;

==Effects on Astley and reaction==
In a March 2008 interview, Astley said that he found the rickrolling of Scientology to be "hilarious"; he also said that he will not try to capitalise on the rickroll phenomenon with a new recording or [[remix]] of his own, but that he would be happy to have other artists remix it. Overall, Astley is not troubled by the phenomenon, stating that he finds it "bizarre and funny" and that his only concern is that his "daughter doesn't get embarrassed about it."&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/webscout/2008/03/rick-astley-kin.html |title=Web Scout exclusive!

In November 2008, Rick Astley was nominated for "[[MTV Europe Music Award for Best Act|Best Act Ever]]" at the [[MTV Europe Music Awards 2008|MTV Europe Music Awards]] after the online nomination form was flooded with votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7646807.stm |work=BBC News |date=2 October 2008 |accessdate=20 November 2008 |title= Astley shortlisted for MTV award}}&lt;/ref&gt; The push to make Astley the winner of the award, as well as efforts to encourage MTV to personally invite Astley to the awards ceremony, continued after the announcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bestactever.com/wtf-mtv |title=WTF MTV? |publisher=Bestactever.com |date=10 October 2008 |accessdate=20 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 October, Astley's website confirmed that an invitation to the awards had been received. On 6 November 2008, just hours before the ceremony was due to air, it was reported that MTV Europe did not want to give Astley the award at the ceremony, instead wanting to present it at a later date. Many fans who voted for Astley felt the awards ceremony failed to acknowledge him as a legitimate artist. Astley stated in an interview that he felt the award was "daft", but noted that he thought that "MTV were thoroughly rickrolled", and went on to thank everyone who voted for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/hi/entertainment/newsid_7715000/7715587.stm |title=Rick Brands MTV win 'Ridiculous' |date=7 November 2008 |accessdate=20 November 2008 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Astley wrote about [[4chan]] founder [[Christopher Poole|moot]] for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's annual ''[[Time 100]]'' issue, and thanked moot for the rickrolling phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1894410_1893837_1894180,00.html |title=The 2009 TIME 100: moot|date=30 April 2009 |accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The Register]]'', {{As of|2010|lc = y}}, Astley had only directly received $12 in [[performance royalties]] from YouTube. Although by that time the song had been played 39 million times, Astley did not compose the song and received only a performer's share of the sound recording copyright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/08/31/gema_youtube/|title=German judge chides Google over YouTube freeloading |date=31 August 2010 |work=The Register}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its meme status led to the song’s usage in the post-credits scene for [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]]’s 2018 film ''[[Ralph Breaks the Internet]]'', the sequel to 2012’s ''[[Wreck-It Ralph]]''. The film ''[[Bumblebee (film)|Bumblebee]]'' was also rickrolled on its teaser trailer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/bumblebee-first-movie-trailer-transformers-get-rickrolled/|title=Bumblebee movie trailer: Even Transformers get Rickrolled|date=2018-06-05|work=CNET|access-date=2018-10-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Museum of the Romanian Peasant''' ({{lang-ro|Muzeul Național al Ţăranului Român}}) is a [[museum]] in [[Bucharest]], [[Romania]], with a collection of [[textile]]s (especially [[costume]]s), [[icon]]s, [[ceramics (art)|ceramics]], and other artifacts of Romanian [[peasant]] life. One of [[Europe]]'s leading museums of popular arts and traditions, it was designated "[[European Museum of the Year Award|European Museum of the Year]]" for 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://assembly.coe.int/Museum/ForumEuroMusee/allawards.asp All awards 1977-2003], European Museum Forum. Accessed online 4 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Located on [[Șoseaua Kiseleff]], near [[Piaţa Victoriei]], the museum falls under the patronage of the Romanian Ministry of Culture. Its collection includes over 100,000 objects.

[[Image:MTR 2.jpg|thumb|250 px|Inside the museum]]

First founded in 1906 by and originally managed by [[Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcaş]], the museum was reopened February 5, 1990, a mere six weeks after the downfall and execution of [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]]. During the [[Communist Romania|Communist era]], the building housed a museum representing the country's Communist party; the museum's basement still contains a room devoted to an [[irony|ironic]] display of some artifacts from that earlier museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.roughguides.com/destinations/europe/romania/bucharest/museum-romanian-peasant/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-04-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419235255/http://www.roughguides.com/destinations/europe/romania/bucharest/museum-romanian-peasant/ |archive-date=2016-04-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The building, which uses traditional Romanian architectural features, was built on the former site of the State [[Mint (coin)|Mint]] (''Monetăria Statului'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://muzeulbucurestiului.ro/en/the-dr-nicolae-minovici-villa-restitutio/|title=“THE DR.

The museum was devastated during the June 1990 [[Mineriad]], due to being confused with the headquarters of the [[National Peasants' Party]].

[[Image:MTR Casa 3.jpg|thumb|left|200 px|"The house in the house"]]
One of the museum's most famous exhibits—originally the work of Tzigara-Samurcaș—is "the house in the house". The house, which originally belonged to peasant Antonie Mogos of [[Ceauru]] village in [[Gorj County]]. From the first, the house was displayed in a non-naturalistic way: objects that would normally be in the interior were displayed in various manners outside; outbuildings were suggested by fragments. The [[Communist Romania|Communist regime]] displayed the house much more conventionally, outdoors at the [[Village Museum]]; it returned to the Peasant Museum in 2002. The current display at the Peasant Museum revives the original non-naturalistic approach. For example, from  a platform, museum visitors may peer into the attic, part of whose wall is stripped away; various objects are arranged inside.&lt;ref&gt;"The house in the house", wall text, Museum of the Romanian Peasant.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the museum's exhibit space was greatly expanded as the museum store and offices moved into a new building behind the old one, freeing up a considerable amount of floor space in the museum proper.

The '''Siege of Jacob's Ford''' was a victory of the Muslim sultan [[Saladin]] over the Christian [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|King of Jerusalem]], [[Baldwin IV]]. It occurred in August 1179, when Saladin conquered and destroyed a new border castle built by the [[Knights Templar]] at [[Daughters of Jacob Bridge|Jacob's Ford]] on the upper [[River Jordan]], a historic passage point between the [[Golan Heights]] and northern [[Galilee]]. Jacob's Ford is also known by the Latin name of ''Vadum Iacob'' and in modern Hebrew as ''Ateret''. Many scholars believe that Saladin's reconquest of the Holy Land and Jerusalem in 1187 was heralded by this earlier victory.

== Participants in the 1179 struggle for power and their early beginnings ==
Saladin, one of the most famous Islamic rulers, was Sultan of [[Egypt]] and, by 1174, sultan of Syria after his takeover of [[Damascus]].&lt;ref&gt;Antony Bridge. The Crusades. (New York: Franklin Watts, 1982), 186.&lt;/ref&gt; After seizing power in Syria, Saladin vowed to forge an Islamic empire around Jerusalem. Naturally, the end goal was to recapture the Holy City from the Crusaders, a significant stride towards an end to the Jihad. However, such a plan would take the Holy Land without major military conflict.

Baldwin IV took control over the Kingdom of Jerusalem at the age of thirteen after the death of his father Amalric I in 1174, the same year that Saladin came to power. Baldwin was a staunch believer in [[Christianity]] and, as a result, Saladin's biggest problem to overcome. Although Baldwin was a rich and powerful leader, he was stricken with [[leprosy]] at a very young age.

After approximately three years on the throne at Jerusalem, Baldwin was faced with his very first military challenge. Saladin invaded the Christian kingdom in approximately 1177 to rout the Crusaders. Although Saladin was almost twenty years older and more experienced than Baldwin, the youthful Christian monarch did not flounder in stressful situations. Baldwin and his Crusaders outwitted the Muslims at Mont Gisard on 25 November 1177.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Madden, ed., Crusades: An Illustrated History. (University of Michigan Press, Ann Arbor, 2004), 72.&lt;/ref&gt; As one Crusade scholar wrote with regards to Montgisard, "[t]his was a striking achievement – the only defeat in pitched battle that Saladin suffered before the advent of Richard the Lionheart and the Third Crusade".&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;Thomas Asbridge. "The Crusaders’ Lost Fort: Battle at Jacob’s Ford". Available from
[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/programmes/timewatch/article_crusader_01.shtml bbc.co.uk], accessed 17 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the battle, Saladin was forced to flee back to Egypt after narrowly escaping death. Although the victory resulted in tremendous losses for Baldwin's armies, his image throughout the kingdom gained in strength. In fact, some Christians in the [[Near East]] had even come to believe that 'miracle' of his victory [at Mont Gisard] appear[ed] as a sign of divine mandate".&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk" /&gt;

== Jacob’s Ford and the Castle of Chastellet ==
Jacob's Ford is approximately one hundred miles north of Jerusalem at the [[Jordan River]] and was a key [[Ford (crossing)|river crossing]] on one of the main roads between [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] and [[Damascus]].&lt;ref&gt;Alan V. Murray, ed., "Jacob’s Ford". in The Crusades: An Encyclopedia, 2006 ed., 649.&lt;/ref&gt; Jacob's Ford was also one of the safest crossings of the Jordan and, because of its location and importance, was utilized by Christian Palestine and Muslim Syria as a major intersection between the two civilizations. In the twelfth century, Baldwin and Saladin continually contested over the area on which Jacob's Ford was situated. As a bold strategic move and as a result of his military victory at Mont Gisard, Baldwin decided to march to Jacob's Ford and build a defensive fortress on its territory. The king and his Crusaders theorized that such a fortification could protect Jerusalem from a northern invasion and put pressure on Saladin's stronghold at Damascus.

Between October 1178 and April 1179, Baldwin began the first stages of constructing his new line of defense, a fortification called Chastellet at Jacob's Ford. While construction was in progress, Saladin became fully aware of the task he would have to overcome at Jacob's Ford if he were to protect Syria and conquer Jerusalem. At the time, he was unable to stop the erection of Chastellet by military force because a large portion of his troops were stationed in northern Syria, putting down Muslim rebellions. As one author writes, "Saladin was always at pains to portray himself as the champion of Islam against the European intruders, although in fact he spent much of, if not more, of his career involved in a war against…other Muslims."&lt;ref&gt;Madden, Crusades, 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the sultan turned to bribery and offered Baldwin 60,000 dinars to halt construction. Baldwin declined, but Saladin made a counter-offer of 100,000 [[dinars]].&lt;ref&gt;Asbridge, "The Crusaders.'" Murray, "Jacob’s," 649&lt;/ref&gt; The Christian king refused again and continued to build Chastellet. By the summer of 1179, Baldwin's forces had constructed a stone wall of massive proportions. "The castle now had a formidable ten met[er] high wall – what one Arabic contemporary later described as ‘an impregnable rampart of stone and iron’ – and a single tower, but it was still a work in progress."&lt;ref name="Asbridge, Crusaders.'"&gt;Asbridge, "Crusaders.'"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plans and tactics ==
After Baldwin refused both bribes, Saladin turned his attention away from the uprisings in northern Syria and focused on Jacob’s Ford and the Castle of Chastellet. He was fully aware that any further bargaining or negotiations would only be in vain and that the more time he wasted, the more time Baldwin would have to complete his massive fortification. In 1179, only a few months after construction of Chastellet began, Saladin summoned a large Muslim army to march southeast towards Jacob’s Ford. The plan was simple: lay siege to the castle and its inhabitants before any reinforcements from Jerusalem or any of its neighboring territories could arrive.

Baldwin, on the other hand, was situated at [[Tiberias]], a province situated on the [[Sea of Galilee]], approximately a half day’s march from Jacob’s Ford. If any attack were to befall his project, reinforcements would be able to arrive relatively quickly. Moreover, the fortification at Jacob’s Ford, at least what was completed of it, was relatively strong and was likely able to hold out until relief could arrive in case of siege. As one Crusades author asserts and inquisitively asks, "[t]he siege was effectively a race – could the Muslims crack the stronghold's defenses before the Latin forces arrived?"&lt;ref name="Asbridge, Crusaders.'"/&gt;

== The Siege at Jacob’s Ford and Saladin’s victory ==

[[Image:NEcornerChastellet2009.JPG|thumb|Northeast corner of the Chastellet foundation]]
On 23 August 1179, Saladin arrived at Jacob’s Ford and ordered his troops to shoot arrows at the castle, thus initiating the siege. While the archers distracted the men inside the fortification, miners were digging a tunnel to breach the stone and iron walls at the north-east corner of Chastellet. Once the tunnel was dug, Saladin’s forces placed large amounts of wood inside and set it alight. This process, called [[sapping]], was a method in which the tunnel's supports were burnt away forcing the walls to eventually collapse under their own weight.&lt;ref name="Plum"&gt;David B. Green. "A Plum Conquest Gone Bad." The Jerusalem Report (1998): 40. [database on-line] [http://www.lexisnexis.com/us/lnacademic/results/docview/docview.do?risb=21_T3089215000&amp;format=GNBFI&amp;sort=RELEVANCE&amp;startDocNo=1&amp;resultsUrlKey=29_T3089215003&amp;cisb=22_T3089215002&amp;treeMax  Available from LexisNexis](accessed 17 February 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; The walls didn't collapse, because the tunnel was too narrow. Sapping initially failed for Saladin and his troops, so the troops were forced to put out the fire with buckets of water and were paid one gold piece per bucket to do so.&lt;ref name="Plum" /&gt; After the fire was extinguished, the miners were instructed to broaden the tunnel and eventually relight the fire. At the same time, Baldwin, having learned of this attack, called for reinforcements from Jerusalem. However, communications between Baldwin and Chastellet were slow and, by this time, the siege had been under way for several days.

Baldwin’s forces inside the castle began to reinforce the main gates around the castle. Shortly after, the Muslims relit the fire in the tunnel under the castle, and the walls collapsed. As a result, the Crusaders’ attempts to refortify the castle were in vain and, approximately six days after the siege began, Saladin and his troops entered Chastellet. By 30 August 1179, the Muslim invaders had pillaged the castle at Jacob's Ford and killed most of its residents. On the same day, less than one week after reinforcements were called, Baldwin and his supporting army set out from [[Tiberias]], only to discover smoke permeating the horizon directly above Chastellet. Obviously, they were too late to save the 700 knights, architects, and construction workers who were killed and the other 800 who were taken captive.&lt;ref name="Plum" /&gt; Baldwin and his reinforcements turned back towards Tiberias and Saladin ordered the remains of the fortification to be torn down.

== Aftermath ==
Although Saladin claimed a military victory at Chastellet, his troops fell victim to another enemy. Directly after the siege, the bodies of the 700 Crusaders killed at Jacob's Ford were placed into a pit. The corpses in the pit began to decay in the August heat and, as a result, a plague ensued, killing approximately ten of Saladin's officers.&lt;ref&gt;Green, "A Plum."&lt;/ref&gt; However, this setback did not diminish Saladin's military prowess. In 1180, Saladin and Baldwin signed a truce.&lt;ref&gt;Bridge, The Crusades, 189&lt;/ref&gt; Seven years after this peace treaty between the Muslims and the Crusaders, Saladin captured Jerusalem from the Christians after the [[Battle of Hattin]] in 1187.&lt;ref&gt;John L.

Some scholars suggest that, following Saladin's victory at Jacob's Ford in 1179, Jerusalem was extremely vulnerable to capture because "the entry into the kingdom by way of the Jordan crossing immediately south of Lake Tiberias... used [by] Saladin in 1182, 1184, and 1187 was virtually undefended".&lt;ref&gt;R.C. Smail, "Crusaders’ Castles of the Twelfth Century", Cambridge Historical Journal 10, no. 2 (1951): 138.&lt;/ref&gt; However, that crossing has nothing to do with the more northerly Jacob's Ford, and beside that it was only some ten kilometres south from the fortified and garrisoned Crusader town of [[Tiberias]], capital of the [[Principality of Galilee]], this being one among several Crusader strongholds in the eastern Galilee and Jordan Valley, which leaves space for debate.

After the capture of Jerusalem, Saladin remained militarily and politically successful in the Near East until a military encounter with [[Richard the Lionheart]], after which he was forced to make peace in 1192. He died the next year. Meanwhile, King Baldwin IV, afflicted with leprosy, died in 1185 at age twenty-three.&lt;ref&gt;Bridge, The Crusades, 197.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Archaeological importance ==
Today, most of the information scholars and historians know about the siege at Jacob's Ford derives from archaeological evidence uncovered at the site.

The '''Stavisky Affair''' was a 1934 financial scandal generated by the actions of [[Embezzlement|embezzler]] [[Alexandre Stavisky]]. It had political ramifications for the [[France|French]] [[Radical Socialist Party (France)|Radical Socialist moderate]] government of the day because the Prime Minister had protected Stavisky, who suddenly died in mysterious circumstances. The political right engaged in [[6 February 1934 crisis |large anti-government demonstrations]] on 6 February 1934. Paris police opened fire and killed 15 demonstrators.  A right-wing coup d'état seemed like a possibility, but historians agree that the multiple right-wing forces were uncoordinated and not trying to overthrow the government.&lt;ref&gt;Paul F. Jankowski, ''Stavisky: A Confidence Man in the Republic of Virtue'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stavisky==
[[Serge Alexandre Stavisky]] (1888–1934), who became known as ''le beau Sacha'' ("Handsome [[Sasha (name)|Sasha]]"), was a [[Russia]]n [[Jew]] born in modern-day [[Ukraine]] whose parents had moved to France. He tried various professions, working as a café singer, as a nightclub manager, as a worker in a soup factory, and as the operator of a gambling den. In the 1930s he managed municipal [[pawnshop]]s in [[Bayonne]] but also moved in financial circles. He sold lots of worthless bonds and financed his "hockshop" on the [[surety]] of what he called the [[emerald]]s of the late [[Empress of Germany]] &amp;mdash; which later turned out to be glass.

Stavisky maintained his façade by using his connections to many people in important positions. If some newspaper tried to investigate his affairs, he bought them off, sometimes with large advertisement contracts, sometimes by buying the paper.

In 1927 Stavisky was put on trial for fraud for the first time. However, the trial was postponed again and again and he was granted bail 19 times. He probably continued his scams during this time. One judge who claimed to hold secret documents was later found decapitated.

[[Janet Flanner]] writes: 
:The scheme which finally killed Alexandre Stavisky, his political guests' reputations, and the uninvited public's peace of mind, was his emission of hundreds of millions of francs' worth of false bonds on the city of Bayonne's municipal pawnshop, which were bought up by life-insurance companies, counseled by the Minister of Colonies, who was counseled by the Minister of Commerce, who was counseled by the Mayor of Bayonne, who was counseled by the little manager of the hockshop, who was counseled by Stavisky.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Flanner, ''Paris was Yesterday'' (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

Faced with exposure in December 1933, Stavisky fled. On 8 January 1934, the police found him in a chalet in Chamonix, dying from a gun wound. Officially Stavisky committed suicide but there was a persistent speculation that police killed him. Fourteen Parisian newspapers called it suicide and eight did not. The distance the bullet had traveled led ''[[Le Canard enchaîné]]'' to propose the tongue-in-cheek theory that he had "[[wikt:avoir le bras long|a long arm]]".

==Political crisis of 6 February 1934==
{{main article|6 February 1934 crisis}}
The ''affaire Stavisky'' went public with Stavisky's arrest, escape and death and rumors of murder. Then his long criminal record as an [[embezzler]] and [[confidence trick]]ster went public. The suicide or murder, the losses many of the general public suffered, and his close involvement with so many ministers led to the resignation of premier [[Camille Chautemps]] amidst accusations from the [[right-wing]] opposition that Chautemps and his police had intentionally killed Stavisky to protect influential people.

Chautemps was replaced by [[Édouard Daladier]] from the same [[Radical Party (France)|Radical-Socialist Party]]. One of his first acts was to dismiss the [[Prefecture of Police|prefect of the Paris police]], [[Jean Chiappe]], notorious for his right-wing sympathies and suspected of encouraging previous anti-government demonstrations. Next Daladier dismissed the director of the [[Comédie Française]], who had been staging [[William Shakespeare]]'s anti-democratic ''[[Coriolanus (play)|Coriolanus]]'' and replaced him with the head of the Sûreté-Générale, who was as reliably [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] as the Paris police chief had been of the right. He also appointed a new Interior Minister, [[Eugène Frot]], who announced that demonstrators would be shot.

The dismissal of Chiappe was the immediate cause of the [[6 February 1934 crisis]], which some saw as a possible right-wing [[putsch]]. According to historian Joel Colton, "The consensus among scholars is that there was no concerted or unified design to seize power and that the police lacked the coherence, unity, or leadership to accomplish such an end."&lt;ref&gt;Joel Colton, "Politics and economics in the 1930s" in  ''From the Ancien Regime to the Popular Front,'' ed. Charles K. Warner (1969), p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; The historian of fascism, [[René Rémond]], described it as "barely a riot ... a street demonstration".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Davies, ''The Extreme Right in France, 1789 to the Present: From de Maistre to Le Pen'' (Routledge, 2002), p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the left-wing at the time did fear an overt [[fascism|fascist]] conspiracy. Fomented by several conservative, anti-Semitic, [[Orleanist|monarchist]], or fascist groups, including [[Action Française]], the [[Croix-de-Feu]] and the [[Mouvement Franciste]], the demonstration took place on the night of 6–7 February 1934. The police killed 15 demonstrators. Daladier had to resign. His successor was conservative [[Gaston Doumergue]] who created a coalition cabinet. It was the first time during the Third Republic that a government had to resign owing to oppositional rioters. Other results were the formation of [[anti-fascism]] leagues and the agreement between the [[Section française de l'Internationale ouvrière|SFIO socialist party]] and the [[French Communist Party|communist party]], which in turn led to the 1936 [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]].

==Further consequences==
The scandal engulfed a remarkable range of personalities from politics, high society and the literary-intellectual elite of Paris. [[Mistinguett]] was asked why she had been photographed with Stavisky at a nightclub; [[Georges Simenon]] reported on the unfolding affair and Stavisky's ex-bodyguard threatened him with physical violence; [[Colette]], referring to the inability of any of Stavisky's high-placed friends to remember him, described the dead con-artist as "a man with no face".{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

The trial of 20 people associated with Stavisky began in 1935. Printed charges were 1200 pages long. All of the accused, including Stavisky's widow, two Deputies, and one general, were acquitted the following year. The amount involved was estimated to be equal to eighteen million contemporary dollars plus an additional fifty-four million that came within months{{Clarify|date=November 2008}} of fruition. The location of Stavisky's wealth is still unknown.

The Stavisky Affair left France internally weakened. France remained deeply divided for the rest of the decade, but the political weaknesses it exposed and exacerbated were not confined to France. The Affair was emblematic of a broader erosion of democratic values and institutions in post&amp;ndash;World War I Europe.

==Portraits of the affair==
* French film director [[Alain Resnais]] told the story in the 1974 film ''[[Stavisky|Stavisky...]]'', featuring [[Jean-Paul Belmondo]] in the title role and [[Anny Duperey]] as his wife Arlette.
* ''[[Stolen Holiday]]'', a Hollywood depiction made in 1937 starring [[Claude Rains]] as Stavisky's fictional counterpart, Stefan Orloff, and [[Kay Francis]] as his wife. ''Stolen Holiday'' asserted unequivocally that Orloff was shot by police and his death made to look like a suicide.

'''Super Chicha''' was a fictional character created by designer Guillermo Afonso for the [[Carnival of Santa Cruz de Tenerife]] in 1999,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.santacruzdetenerife.es/actualidad/noticias/noticia/articulo/el-ayuntamiento-de-santa-cruz-se-ve-obligado-a-desmontar-la-estructura-del-super-chicha-en-el/ El Ayuntamiento de Santa Cruz se ve obligado a desmontar la estructura del ‘Super Chicha’ en el mercado del barrio de La Salud]&lt;/ref&gt; when the carnival was devoted to comic books and a patriotic [[superhero]] of [[Tenerife]] ([[Canary Islands]], Spain) was created. It was dubbed ''"Super Chicha"'' i.e. ''"Super Chicharrero"'' ([[Chicharrero]] popular is the adjective of the inhabitants of the city of [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife]]). To create that character inspired [[Captain America]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isladetenerifevivela.com/2015/02/carnaval-de-santa-cruz-ano-ano_12.html#.WW-JzVGQzcs Carnaval de Santa Cruz, año a año]&lt;/ref&gt;

By building the carnival scene in 1999, a giant statue of ''Super Chicha'' located in the center of the stage accompanied a smaller sculpture of [[Lara Croft]] and other superheroes of the comic world was created. He served as a backdrop to the huge picture wall that mimicked the page of a comic book and a ''Super Chicha'' punching and shield in the other hand seemed to be coming out of it.

''Super Chicha'' wears a blue mask with white wings between his temples, and the word ''"Sch"'' on the forehead, chest blue and white gloves, the rest of the suit is blue with white boots. ''Super Chicha'' carrying a circular shield, the shield has the colors and shape of the [[flag of Tenerife]], i.e. blue background with a white cross topped shaped blade.

Today, ''Super Chicha'' remains one of the most beloved characters of the Carnival of Santa Cruz de Tenerife. During Carnival of the year 2017, the disguise that used the members of the murga ''Los Chinchosos'' was precisely of ''Super Chicha''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://santacruzdiario.com/mas-sombras-que-luces-en-la-primera-fase-del-concurso-de-murgas-asdultas/ Más sombras que luces en la Primera Fase del Concurso de Murgas Adultas] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170212184303/http://santacruzdiario.com/mas-sombras-que-luces-en-la-primera-fase-del-concurso-de-murgas-asdultas/ |date=12 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Transformation in economics''' refers to a long-term change in dominant economic activity in terms of prevailing relative engagement or employment of able individuals.

Human economic systems undergo a number of deviations and departures from the "normal" state, trend or development. Among them are Disturbance (short-term disruption, temporary disorder), Perturbation (persistent or repeated divergence, predicament, decline or crisis), Deformation (damage, regime change, loss of self-sustainability, distortion), Transformation (long-term change, restructuring, conversion, new “normal”) and Renewal (rebirth, transmutation, corso-ricorso, renaissance, new beginning).

Transformation is a [[Unidirectional network|unidirectional]] and irreversible change in dominant human economic activity ([[Economic sectors|economic sector]]). Such change is driven by slower or faster continuous improvement in sector productivity growth rate. Productivity growth itself is fueled by advances in technology, inflow of useful innovations, accumulated practical knowledge and experience, levels of education, viability of institutions, quality of decision making and organized human effort. Individual sector transformations are the outcomes of human [[socio-economic]] evolution.

Human economic activity has so far undergone at least four fundamental transformations:

#From nomadic hunting and gathering (H/G) to localized agriculture
#From localized agriculture (A) to internationalized industry
#From international industry (I) to global services
#From global services (S) to public sector (including government, welfare and unemployment, GWU)

This evolution naturally proceeds from securing necessary food, through producing useful things, to providing helpful services, both private and public (See H/G→A→I→S→GWU sequence in Fig. 1).  Accelerating productivity growth rates speed up the transformations, from millennia, through centuries, to decades of the recent era. It is this acceleration which makes transformation relevant economic category of today, more fundamental in its impact than any recession, crisis or depression. The evolution of four forms of capital (Indicated in Fig. 1) accompanies all economic transformations.

Transformation is quite different from accompanying cyclical recessions and crises, despite the similarity of manifested phenomena (unemployment, technology shifts, socio-political discontent, bankruptcies, etc.). However, the tools and interventions used to combat crisis are clearly ineffective for coping with non-cyclical transformations. The problem is whether we face a mere crisis or a fundamental transformation (globalization→relocalization).

== Four key forms of capital ==
[[File:Fig1. Nested hypercycles of the transformations through the parallel evolution of four forms of capital.PNG|thumb|Fig. 1. Nested hypercycles of the transformations through the parallel evolution of four forms of capital|287x287px]]

Fig. 1 refers to the four transformations through the parallel (and overlapping) evolution of four forms of capital: Natural→Built→Human→Social. These evolved forms of capital present a minimal complex of sustainability and self-sustainability of pre-human and human systems.

'''[[Natural capital|Natural capital (N)]]'''. The nature-produced, renewed and reproduced “resources” of land, water, air, raw materials, biomass and organisms. Natural capital is subject to both renewable and non-renewable depletion, degradation, cultivation, recycling and reuse.

'''Built capital (B)'''. The man-made physical assets of infrastructures, technologies, buildings and means of transportation. This is the manufactured “hardware” of nations. This national hardware must be continually maintained, renewed and modernized to assure its continued productivity, efficiency and effectiveness.

'''[[Human capital|Human capital (H)]]'''. The continued investment in people’s skills, knowledge, education, health &amp; nutrition, abilities, motivation and effort. This is the “software” and “brainware” of a nation; most important form of capital for developing nations.

'''[[Social capital|Social capital (S)]]'''. The enabling infrastructure of institutions, civic communities, cultural and national cohesion, collective and family values, trust, traditions, respect and the sense of belonging. This is the voluntary, spontaneous “social order” which cannot be engineered, but its self-production (autopoiesis) can be nurtured, supported and cultivated.

== Parallelism of crises and transformations ==
The triggers that induce the catharsis of a crisis often coincide with and are undistinguishable from the triggers launching qualitative transformations of the economy, business and society at large. While crises are cyclical recessions or slowdowns within the same paradigm, transformation represents a paradigmatic change in the way of doing business: moving towards new standards and quality, in a unique and non-recursive way.  Most developed and mature economies of the world (USA, Japan, Western Europe) are undergoing long-term transformation towards a “new normal” of doing business, state governance and ways of life. Cyclical crisis is a parallel, accompanying phenomenon, subject to different causes, special rules and separate dynamics.

[[Milan Zeleny]] cautions that confounding crisis and transformation as one phenomenon brings forth the confusion, inconsistency and guessing.&lt;ref name="Crisis"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://iospress.metapress.com/content/d54282m4176x844n/ | title=Machine/organism dichotomy and free-market economics: Crisis or transformation? | publisher=IOS Press | author=Zeleny, Milan | journal=Human Systems Management |date=November 2010 | volume=29 | issue=4/2010 | pages=P191–204}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many changes in the market system are cyclical, there are also evolutionary changes which are unidirectional and qualitatively transformational. The transformations of the US economy from agricultural to industrial, or from industrial to services, were not crises, although there were cyclical crises along the way. Transformational “losses” cannot be recovered or regained by definition. Not understanding that is at the core of wasteful spending of rigidly hopeless governmental interventions. Barry Bosworth of the [[Brookings Institution]] confirms:  “The assumption has always been that the U.S. economy will gain back what was lost in a recession. Academics are coming to the realization that this time is different and that those losses appear permanent and cannot be regained.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-03-06/u-dot-s-dot-potential-gdp-revised-downward-as-recession-damage-lingers | title=The GDP in 2017 Is Not Looking Good | publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek | date=March 2014 | author=Brendan Greeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In transformations there are no “losses”, only changes and transitions to a new economic order.

== Underlying pattern of recessions ==
[[File:Percent Job Losses After WWII Recessions.jpg|thumb|Fig. 2. Comparison of major US recessions over past 30 years|452x452px]]

When comparing major US recessions since 1980, as in Fig. 2, it is clear that they have been getting deeper and longer in terms of the recovery of initial employment level. Only the first is classical V shape, there are several W, U and finally L shapes. There clearly is an underlying causal phenomenon which is getting stronger and more persistent over time. Such underlying causation is of interest, as it may signal the prelude and gathering of forces of another emerging transformation.

Looking back, even [[Great Depression in the United States|the Great Depression]] of the 1930s was not just a crisis, but a long-term transformation from the pre-war industrial economy to the post-war service economy in the U.S. However, in the early 1980s, the service sector had started slowing down its employment absorption and growth potential, ultimately leading to the jobless economy of 2011. No such comparisons with the 1930s are useful: one can compare recessions but not transformations. Industrial economy of 1930s and the post-service economy of 2000s are two different “animals” in two different contexts. It is still not clear what kind of transformation is emerging and eventually replaces the service and public sector economy.

The unrecognized confluence of crisis and transformation, and the inability to separate them, lies at the core of old tools ([[Keynesian economics|keynesianism]], [[monetarism]]) not working properly. The tools for adapting successfully to paradigmatic transformation have not been developed.  An example of a paradigmatic transformation would be the shift from geocentric to heliocentric view of our world.  Within both views there can be any number of crises, cyclical failures of old and searches for new theories and practices. But there was only one transformation, from geocentric to heliocentric, and there was nothing cyclical about it. It was resisted with all the might of the mighty: remember Galilei and Bruno. While crises are cyclical corrections and adjustments, transformations are evolutionary shifts or even revolutions (industrial, computer) towards new and different levels of existence.

The most important indicator is the arena of employment, especially in the US, providing clues to transformational qualities of the current global crisis phenomena. Persistent rates of unemployment, combined with falling workforce participation rate indicate that also this crisis is intertwined with underlying transformation and so it displays atypical dynamics and unusual persistence, presenting new challenges to conventional economic thought, business practices and government interventional “toolbox”. Sector evolution and dynamics is the key to explaining these phenomena.

== Sector dynamics ==
[[Economic sectors]] evolve (in terms of employment levels), albeit through fluctuations, in one general direction (along so called S-curve): they emerge, expand, plateau, contract and exit—just like any self-organizing system or living organism. We are naturally interested in the percentage of total workforce employed in a given sector. The dynamics of this percentage provides clues to where and when are the new jobs generated and old ones abandoned.

Sector’s percentage share of employment evolves in dependency on sector’s productivity growth rate.  Agriculture has emerged and virtually disappeared as a source of net employment. Today, only ½ percent or so of total workforce is employed in US agriculture – the most productive sector of the economy. Manufacturing had emerged, peaked and contracted. Services have emerged and started contracting – all due to incessant, unavoidable and desirable productivity growth rates.

The [[Manufacturing in the United States|U.S. absolute manufacturing output]] has more than tripled over the past 60 years. Because of the productivity growth rates, these goods were produced by ever decreasing number of people. While in 1980-2012 total economic output per hour worked increased 85 percent, in manufacturing output per hour skyrocketed by 189 percent. The number of employees in manufacturing was about a third of total workforce in 1953, about a fifth in 1980, and about a tenth (12 million) in 2012. This decline is now accelerating because of the high-tech automation and robotization. This is why President Obama´s policy of “industrial renaissance” and “high-tech manufacturing jobs” is economically flawed and politically without promise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Industrial renaissance in the US: miracle or mirage?|url=http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/13352#.UuhCTBAo6M8|publisher=Spiked Magazine|author=Phil Mullan|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A public sector of employment has been emerging: government, welfare and unemployment, based on tax-financed consumption rather than added value production, sheltered from market forces, producing public services. (Observe that the unemployed are temporary “employees” of the government, as long as they receive payments.) Creating employment in GWU sector is achievable at the expense of productive sectors, i.e. only at the risk of major debt accumulation, in a non-lasting way and with low added value. Sustaining employment growth in such a sector is severely limited by the growing debt financing.

== The Four Basic Sectors ==
The Four Basic Sectors refers to the current stage of [[industrial sector|sector]] evolution, in the sequence of four undergone transformations, namely [[agriculture]], [[industry]], [[Service (business)|services]] and GWU ([[government]], [[welfare]] and [[unemployment]])

The US economy has become one of the most mature (with Japan and Western Europe) in terms of its sector evolution.&lt;ref name="M. Zeleny 1"&gt;{{cite book | title=Human Systems Management: Integrating Knowledge, Management &amp; Systems | publisher=World Scientific | last=Zeleny | first=Milan | year=2005 | pages=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;    It has entered the stage – perhaps as the first economy ever – of declining employment share in both the service and government sectors.

[[Productivity]] growth rates are now{{when|date=February 2018}} accelerating in the US services and its employment creation and absorption potential are declining rapidly. Accelerating productivity growth rates are dictated by global competition and human striving for better [[standards of living]] – they cannot be stopped at will.  In the US there are only three subsectors where net jobs are still being created: [[education in the US|education]], [[health care in the US|health care]], and government. The first two are subject to market forces and will undergo accelerating productivity growth rates and declining employment levels in the near future{{when|date=February 2018}}. The third one, GWU, is sheltered from competition, cannot expand its share substantially because it depends on taxation from other sectors; its [[employment growth]] is [[unsustainable]].{{cn|date=February 2018}}

Slowly, the US economy has shifted towards sectors with lower added value, leading to lower real incomes and increasing indebtness. This is a systemic condition which no amount of regulation and [[Keynesian]]/monetarist stimuli can effectively address.  Even desirable piercing of speculative, employment and debt bubbles has ceased to be politically correct. Even 100% taxation of all incomes would not alleviate US debt.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

So, the US is at the transforming cusp and hundreds of years of sector evolution comes to a halt.  There are only four essential activities humans can do economically: 1. [[food production|Produce food]], 2. Manufacture goods, 3. Provide services (private and public), and 4. Do nothing. This is why the idea of “[[basic income]]”, independent of employment, is being considered e.g. in Switzerland.

US economy has exploited (from employment share viewpoint) all three productive sectors. There is no new sector lurking in the offing: qualitative transformation is taking place. Less developed economies still have time left, some still have to industrialize and some still have the services to expand. But the US economy is now the harbinger of the things to come, the role model for others to follow or reject, but hardly ignore. For the first time in history, this one economy has reached the end of the old model (or paradigm) and is groping to find the new ways of organizing its business, economy and society.&lt;ref name="M. Zeleny 2"&gt;{{cite book | title=Human Systems Management: Integrating Knowledge, Management &amp; Systems | publisher=World Scientific | last=Zeleny | first=Milan | year=2005 | pages=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== New transformation ==

[[File:Fig. 3a. Sector dynamics in the US and unsustainability of GWU.PNG|thumb|Fig. 3a. Sector dynamics in the US and unsustainability of GWU.|354x354px]]
[[File:Fig. 4. Decline in employment in all four sectors opens up a new space..PNG|thumb|Fig. 3b. Decline in employment in all four sectors opens up a new space.|264x264px]]

In search of the better name, the [[Bloomberg Businessweek]] Editor argued as follows:

{{quote|"You’d expect a better name to have emerged by now. It took remarkable ingenuity to unleash the forces that paralyzed markets, overturned governments, and ruined countless lives, not to mention causing an historic decline in global gross domestic product. For creativity to fail in the summing up is just one more insult. Of course, it’s hard to name what you can’t comprehend." |Editor´s Letter|[[Businessweek]] , September 12, 2013}}

Meanwhile, New Transformation has already well advanced.

In Fig. 3a, observe that the US economy has matured in terms of its sector evolution. It has entered the stage – as the first economy ever – of declining employment in the service and GWU sectors.

As Fig. 3a documents, the US economy has exhausted (from employment viewpoint) all three productive sectors and has reached for the 17% in GWU. In Fig. 3b we separate the last workforce bar from Fig. 3a, in order to see the impact of productivity growth today.

All four sectors are subject to accelerated productivity growth rates in the near future. The only expanding space of the workforce is the grey region “?” in Fig. 3b, essentially reflecting the decline in workforce participation rate. This grey area is also the space of the new transformation: that’s where those who left unemployment registers are starting new ventures and enterprises, and participating in regional economies.

This new “transformation” is different from all preceding sector transformations: it does not usher in a new sector but completes the secular cycle of localization→globalization→re-localization. A new economic paradigm is emerging, with a new structure, behavior, institutions and values. A more precise label would be Economic Metamorphosis. [[Metamorphosis]] is the outcome of a series of transformations, not dissimilar to a caterpillar-to-butterfly change of form, through the construction→destruction→reconstruction autopoietic self-production cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Mystery_of_Metamorphosis.html?id=2G7VWWKRMa4C | title=The Mystery of Metamorphosis: A Scientific Detective Story | publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing | date=April 2011 | last=Ryan | first=Frank}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even when the recession ends, the metamorphosis of economic form shall continue, accelerate and expand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shale: the ‘IT bubble’ of the 21st century?|url=http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/13363#.UuhZvxAo6M8|publisher=Spiked Magazine|author=Phil Mullan|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Less and less we shall be able to tell the difference. Pressures for increased productivity growth rates, declining employment and workforce participation, as well as budget cuts shall grow unabated. Due to massive automation, sector GDP can grow even under the conditions of declining employment. More than that: increasing the minimum wage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Minimum Wage, Wage and Hour Division, Department of Labor|url=http://www.dol.gov/whd/minimumwage.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; historically rather neutral with respect to employment, will now be readily replacing low-level jobs with ever cheaper and more abundant automation - along with millions of jobs being lost due to the still uninformed and aimless political process. Obscuring the difference between cyclical crisis and the ongoing transformation (metamorphosis) is not without consequences: when true diagnosis is not attempted, and people do not know what is happening with their economy and why, all forms of contagious social unrest follow worldwide.

== Okun's law ==
[[File:Fig. 4. Labor participation.png|thumb|Fig. 4. Labor participation|228x228px]]
In economics, [[Okun's law]] (named after [[Arthur Melvin Okun]]), is an empirically observed relationship relating unemployment to losses in a country's production. This correlation "law" states that a 2% decline in output (GDP) will be accompanied by a 1% rise in unemployment. It has been dubbed as “[http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-09-26/macroeconomic-mystery-u-dot-s-dot-unemployment-subverts-okuns-law Macroeconomic Mystery]”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Macroeconomic Mystery | journal=Business Week |date=30 September – 6 October 2013 | pages=P24}}&lt;/ref&gt; After holding for the past 40 years, it faltered during current “recovery”. Unemployment shot up faster than predicted, but then it fell more quickly than indicated by slow U.S. growth in 2009-2013. Output grew 2% but unemployment is 7.6% instead of 8.8% expected by this “law”.

The notion of transformation explains this artificial mystery. First, unemployment shot up faster because there are no major sectors absorbing and replacing the loss of jobs. Second, unemployment also falls faster because, due to the long duration of the crisis, the workforce participation rate keeps shrinking (In 2007, 66% were working or seeking job, in 2013 only 63.2%), as can be seen in Fig. 4. In other words, people leaving the workforce are not counted among the unemployed. For example, in summer 2013, on average only 148,000 new jobs per month were created, yet unemployment rate dropped steeply to 7.3%, at the cost of 312,000 people dropping out of the work force. The number of unemployed (i.e. actively seeking jobs) is different from the number of people without work – another sign of fundamental transformation and not just a “crisis”.

The correlation between growth and employment is very tenuous during ongoing transformation. Based on productivity growth rates, GDP could accelerate and yet jobs drop precipitously, due to automation, robotization, digitization and self-service of the transformation era. Also, correlations in economics are always dangerous because they do not prove or establish causal relationships.

== Self-service, disintermediation and customization ==
The new transformational paradigm could be defined by the ongoing self-organization of the market economy itself: its rates of self-service, [[disintermediation]] and [[mass customization]] are increasing and becoming most effective on local and regional levels. Because there is no new productive sector to emerge, the economy seeks to reinstate its new balance through these new modes of doing business. Producers and providers are outsourcing their production and services to customers and to technology. Outsourcing to customers is a natural and necessary self-organizing process, including disintermediation, customer integration and mass customization, all driven by the global productivity at the cusp of transformation.

Due to its productivity growth rates, each sector must emerge, grow, persist, stagnate, decline and dissipate in terms of its employment generating capacity. The high-productivity growth sectors are emerging and dissipating first, the low-productivity growth sectors (like services) are completing their life cycles only now. Different productivity growth rates in different sectors are accompanied by virtually uniform growth rates in wages and salaries across all sectors, as required by free market forces.

As a consequence, the goods of high productivity growth sectors (food, manufactured goods) are getting cheaper and the products of low productivity growth sectors (health care, education, insurance) are getting more expensive. In many developing nations this may still be the other way around (due to the prevailing stage of sector evolution): food and manufactured goods more expensive, while services still relatively cheap, as captured in the Figure 5:
[[File:Fig. 5. Uniform wage growth vs. differential productivity rates.PNG|thumb|Fig. 5. Uniform wage growth vs. differential productivity rates|372x372px]]

Rational economics agents tend towards substituting relatively cheaper and capital intensive manufactured goods for relatively more expensive and labor-intensive services. Consumers will use goods instead of services wherever economical and possible. By observing the emergence of automated teller machines instead of bank tellers, self-service gas stations instead of full-service stations, self-driving instead of chauffeurs, do-it-yourself pregnancy kits rather than hospital testing services, self-handled optical scanners rather than cashiers, and cloud computing instead of central mainframes, mature economies are entering the era of self-service, disintermediation and mass customization.

Modern production is primarily based on the processing of information, not on the hauling of goods, humans and machinery over large distances.  One can more effectively “haul the information,” to produce goods and provide services locally. Information and knowledge travel effortlessly through electronic superhighways, through telecommunications and social networks over the internet.

== Relocalization ==
{{See also|Localism (politics)}}
Because there is no new productive sector to emerge, the market system seeks to reinstate its new balance through new modes of doing business. [[Deglobalization]] is taking place, supply chains are turning into demand chains, large economies are focusing on their internal markets, outsourcing is followed by “backsourcing”, returning activities back to the countries and locations of their origin. The original slogan of “Think globally, act locally,” is being re-interpreted as exploiting global information and knowledge in local action, under local conditions and contexts.

While [[globalization]] refers to a restructuring of the initially distributed and localized world economy into spatially reorganized processes of production and consumption across national economies and political states on a global scale, in deglobalization, people move towards relocalization: the global experience and knowledge becoming embodied in local communities. So, the corso-ricorso of socio-economic transformation is properly captured by a triad Localization → Globalization → Relocalization.

The trend of [[deglobalization]] is turning much more significant during these years. The growth of worldwide GDP is now exceeding the overall growth of trade for the first time; foreign investment (Cross Border Capital Flows) is only 60% of their pre-crisis levels and has plunged to some 40 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Financial globalization: Retreat or reset?|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/global_capital_markets/financial_globalization|publisher=McKinsey Global Institute|date=March 2013|author1=Susan Lund |author2=Toos Daruvala |author3=Richard Dobbs }}&lt;/ref&gt;  World capital flows include loans and deposits, foreign investments, bonds and equities – all down in their cross-border segment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/6754e5da-76e6-11e3-a253-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2rDTwZEyH | title=Rapid fall in capital flows poses growth risk | publisher=The Financial Times |author1=Ralph Atkins |author2=Keith Fray |date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This means that the rate of globalization has reversed its momentum. Globalizers are still worried about 2014 being the year of irreversible decline. Improvement in the internal growth of U.S.A., EU, and Japan does not carry into external trade – these economies are starting to function as zero-sum.

The income inequality and long-term unemployment lead to re-localized experiments with ''[[Guaranteed Minimum Income]]'' (to be traced to [[Thomas Paine]]) for all citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thomas Paine|url=http://www.ssa.gov/history/tpaine3.html|publisher=Social Security Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.academia.edu/2698139/Two_arguments_for_Basic_Income_Thomas_Paine_1737-1809_and_Thomas_Spence_1750-1814_ | title=Two arguments for Basic Income | last=Marangos | first=John | journal=History of Economic Ideas |date=January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Switzerland this guarantee would be $33,000 per year, regardless of working or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Swiss Join the Fight Against Inequality|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-01-16/inequality-fight-swiss-will-vote-on-minimum-income|publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek|author=Stephan Faris|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the name Generation Basic Income it is now subject to [[Swiss referendums, 2013|Swiss referendum]]. Unemployment then frees people to pursue their own creative talents.

With this transformation, an entirely new vocabulary is emerging in economics: in addition to deglobalization and relocalization, we also encounter glocalization (adjustment of products to local culture) and local community restoration (regional self-government and direct democracy). With relocalization, an entire new cycle of societal corso-ricorso is brought forth. Local services, local production and local agriculture, based on distributed energy generation, additive manufacturing and [[vertical farming]], are enhancing individual, community and regional autonomy through self-service, disintermediation and mass customization. Both requisite technologies and appropriate business models necessary for relocalization are already in place, forming a vital part of our daily business and life experience. New transformation is well on its way.

'''Trauma in children''', also known as '''pediatric trauma''', refers to a [[trauma (medicine)|traumatic]] injury that happens to an [[infant]], [[child]] or [[Adolescence|adolescent]]. Because of [[human anatomy|anatomical]] and [[physiology|physiological]] differences between children and [[adult]]s the care and management of this population differs.

==Anatomic and physiologic differences==
There are significant anatomical and physiological differences between children and adults. For example, the [[Human anatomy#Internal organs .28by region.29|internal organs]] are closer in proximity to each other in children than in adults; this places children at higher risk of traumatic injury.&lt;ref name=Dickinson2008&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Dickinson E, Limmer D, O'Keefe MF, Grant HD, Murray R |title=Emergency Care (11th Edition)|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey|year=2008|pages=848–52|isbn=0-13-500524-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children present a unique challenge in trauma care because they are so different from adults - anatomically, developmentally, physiologically and emotionally. A 2006 study concluded that the risk of death for injured children is lower when care is provided in pediatric trauma centers rather than in non-pediatric trauma centers. Yet about 10% of injured children are treated at pediatric trauma centers. The highest mortality rates occur in children who are treated in rural areas without access trauma centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Petrosyan|first=Mikael|author2=Guner, Yigit S.

An important part of managing trauma in children is [[Body weight#Estimation in children|weight estimation]]. A number of methods to estimate weight exist, including the Broselow tape, Leffler formula, and Theron formula.&lt;ref name=So2009&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=So TY, Farrington E, Absher RK |title=Evaluation of the accuracy of different methods used to estimate weights in the pediatric population|journal=Pediatrics|volume=123|issue=6|pages=e1045–51|year=2009|pmid=19482737|doi=10.1542/peds.2008-1968|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/reprint/123/6/e1045|accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these three methods, the Broselow tape is the most accurate for weight estimation in children ≤25&amp;nbsp;kg,&lt;ref name=So2009/&gt; while the Theron formula performs better with patients weighing &gt;40&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref name=So2009/&gt;

Due to basic [[geometry]], a child's weight to surface area ratio is lower than an adult's, children more readily lose their body heat through radiation and have a higher risk of becoming [[hypothermia|hypothermic]].&lt;ref name=Peitzman2008/&gt;&lt;ref name="powerpoint"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oumedicine.com/workfiles/College%20of%20Medicine/AD-Pediatrics/EMSC/Ped%20Trauma-Triage2.ppt|title=Pediatric Trauma And Triage: Overview of the Problem and Necessary Care for Positive Outcomes|work=Jim Morehead|accessdate=2010-11-06|format=powerpoint}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller body size in children often makes them more prone to [[poly trauma]]tic injury.&lt;ref name="rosen"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Ron Walls MD |author2=John J.

==Diagnosis==

===Pediatric Trauma Score===
Several classification systems have been developed that use some combination of subjective and objective data in an effort to quantify the severity of trauma. Examples include the [[Injury Severity Score]]&lt;ref name=Baker1974&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Baker SP, O'Neill B, ((Haddon W Jr)), Long WB |title=The Injury Severity Score: a method for describing patients with multiple injuries and evaluating emergency care|journal=The Journal of Trauma|volume=14|issue=3|pages=187–96|year=1974|pmid=4814394|url=http://journals.lww.com/jtrauma/citation/1974/03000/the_injury_severity_score__a_method_for_describing.1.aspx|accessdate=2010-11-07|doi=10.1097/00005373-197403000-00001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Copes1988&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Copes WS, Champion HR, Sacco WJ, Lawnick MM, Keast SL, Bain LW |title=The Injury Severity Score revisited|journal=The Journal of Trauma|volume=28|issue=1|pages=69–77|year=1988|pmid=3123707|doi=10.1097/00005373-198801000-00010|url=http://journals.lww.com/jtrauma/Citation/1988/01000/The_Injury_Severity_Score_Revisited.10.aspx|accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a modified version of the [[Glasgow Coma Scale]].&lt;ref name=Teasdale1974&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Teasdale G, Jennett B |title=Assessment of coma and impaired consciousness.

Though useful, all of these measures have significant limitations when applied to pediatric patients. For this reason, health care providers often employ classification systems that have been modified or even specifically developed for use in the pediatric population. For example, the [[Paediatric Glasgow Coma Scale|Pediatric Glasgow Coma Scale]] is a modification of the Glasgow Coma Scale that is useful in patients who have not yet developed language skills.&lt;ref name=BTLS /&gt;

Emphasizing the importance of body weight and airway diameter, the Pediatric Trauma Score (PTS) was developed to specifically reflect the vulnerability of children to traumatic injury. The minimal score is -6 and the maximum score is +12. There is a linear relationship between the decrease in PTS and the mortality risk (i.e. the lower the PTS, the higher the mortality risk).&lt;ref name="BTLS"&gt;{{cite book |author=Campbell, John Creighton |title=Basic trauma life support for paramedics and other advanced providers |publisher=Brady/Prentice Hall Health |location=Upper Saddle River, N.J |year=2000 |isbn=0-13-084584-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mortality is estimated at 9% with a PTS &gt; 8, and at 100% with a PTS ≤ 0.

In most cases the severity of a pediatric trauma injury is determined by the pediatric trauma score&lt;ref name=Peitzman2008/&gt; despite the fact that some research has shown there is no benefit between it and the revised trauma scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kaufmann CR, Maier RV, Rivara FP, Carrico CJ |title=Evaluation of the Pediatric Trauma Score |journal=JAMA |volume=263 |issue=1 |pages=69–72 |date=January 1990 |pmid=2293691 |doi= 10.1001/jama.263.1.69|url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/reprint/263/1/69?maxtoshow=&amp;hits=10&amp;RESULTFORMAT=&amp;fulltext=pediatric+trauma&amp;searchid=1&amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;resourcetype=HWCIT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
The management of pediatric trauma depends on a knowledge of the physiological, anatomical, and developmental differences in comparison to an adult patient, this requires expertise in this area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Little|first=Wendalyn K.|title=Golden Hour or Golden Opportunity: Early Management of Pediatric Trauma|journal=Clinical Pediatric Emergency Medicine|date=1 March 2010|volume=11|issue=1|pages=4–9|doi=10.1016/j.cpem.2009.12.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the pre-hospital setting issues may arise with the treatment of pediatric patients due to a lack of knowledge and resources involved in the treatment of these injuries.&lt;ref name="isbn0-309-04888-5"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Lohr, Kathleen N. |author2=Durch, Jane |title=Emergency medical services for children: Committee on Pediatric Emergency Medical Services |publisher=National Academy Press |location=Washington, D.C |year=1993 |isbn=0-309-04888-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |url=http://books.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=2137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the fact there is only a slight variation in outcomes in adult trauma centers, definitive care is best reached at a pediatric trauma center.&lt;ref name="pmid16410115"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Densmore JC, Lim HJ, Oldham KT, Guice KS |title=Outcomes and delivery of care in pediatric injury |journal=[[J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28687">The [[United States]] is widely considered to have the most extensive and sophisticated intelligence network of any nation in the world, with notable suborganizations including the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] and the [[National Security Agency]], amongst others. It has conducted numerous espionage operations against foreign countries, including both allies and rivals. This includes industrial espionage &lt;ref name="Bloomberg"&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-09-08/u-s-government-spied-on-brazil-s-petrobras-globo-tv-reports.html "Snowden Documents Show U.S. Spied on Petrobras, Globo TV Reports "], Bloomberg, September 8, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and cyber espionage.&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/23/world/asia/nsa-breached-chinese-servers-seen-as-spy-peril.html "N.S.A.

Many of these operations have generated public criticism as being unethical; examples include the overthrow of foreign governments, [[CIA transnational human rights actions#Human experimentation|nonconsensual human experiments]], [[extraordinary rendition]], [[Torture and the United States|torture]], [[targeted killing]]s, [[assassination]]s,  and the [[CIA transnational human rights actions#Police training|funding and training]] of militants who would go on to kill civilians and non-combatants.&lt;ref name="Resolution 1507 2006"&gt;[http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=/Documents/AdoptedText/ta06/ERES1507.htm Resolution 1507 (2006).]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612123848/http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=%2FDocuments%2FAdoptedText%2Fta06%2FERES1507.htm |date=June 12, 2010 }} Alleged secret detentions and unlawful inter-state transfers of detainees involving Council of Europe member states&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WaPoJun22"&gt;{{cite news |first=Karen |last=DeYoung |authorlink=Karen DeYoung |author2=Walter Pincus |title=CIA to Air Decades of Its Dirty Laundry|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/21/AR2007062102434_pf.html |publisher=Washington Post |date=2007-06-22 |accessdate= 2007-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;{{Citation|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/01/AR2005110101644.html |publisher=Washington Post |title= CIA Holds Terror Suspects in Secret Prisons |date=2005-11-02 |accessdate=2007-02-19 | first=Dana | last=Priest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These media reports have shed light on the implications of several [[Secret treaty|secret treaties]] signed by members of the [[UKUSA Agreement|UKUSA community]] in their efforts to implement [[global surveillance]].

==Cyber espionage==

Snowden's revelations confirmed that the [[United States]], together with [[Israel]], conducted [[Operation Olympic Games]], a covert and still [[black operation|unacknowledged]] campaign of sabotage by means of cyber disruption, directed at [[Iran]]ian [[Nuclear program of Iran|nuclear facilities]]. As reported, it is one of the first known uses of offensive [[Cyberwarfare|cyber weapons]].&lt;ref name=sanger/&gt;  Started under the [[George W.

==Industrial espionage==

In 1994, United States trade officials were accompanied with CIA agents to various international locations such as [[London]] and [[Geneva]] to spy on Japanese auto executives and government officials during Japan-U.S. negotiations on automotive trade.&lt;ref name="New York Times1"/&gt;

An article in the New York Times&lt;ref name="New York Times1"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/15/world/emerging-role-for-the-cia-economic-spy.html "Emerging Role For the C.I.A.: Economic Spy"], New York Times, October 15, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; wrote:

==Intelligence activity by location==

===Europe===

====France====

In 1993, the CIA's Paris station launched an economic espionage operation to gain an advantage in negotiations over the 1994 [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]]. They attempted to use a female operative posing as a public relations director for a save-the-rain-forest foundation as a [[Honey trapping|honeypot trap]] to ensnare Henri Plagnol, an aide to French prime minister [[Édouard Balladur]]. However, Plagnol was warned by French counterintelligence officers who has seen through the plot and told him to play along. Over the course of two years, the French used Plagnol to turn the tables on the CIA, uncovering multiple CIA operatives and ultimately publicly expelling the CIA Paris station chief along with other key agents from the country.&lt;ref name="New York Times1"/&gt;

====Germany====

The CIA recruited over a dozen spies working in multiple German industries, including a [[double agent]] in German intelligence. These spies were uncovered in raids on the Ministry of Defense by German authorities in 2014. Angela Merkel, whose personal cellphone was tapped by the NSA, ordered the expulsion of CIA's Berlin station chief.&lt;ref name="RT1"&gt;[http://rt.com/news/172460-cia-spies-germany-merkel-bild/ "Over a dozen CIA-recruited spies work in German ministries – report"], RT, July 13, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

====Iran====

{{Main|1953 Iranian coup d'état}}
{{See also|Tudeh Party|Iran hostage crisis}}

In 1953, the CIA worked with the [[United Kingdom]] to overthrow the democratically elected government of [[Iran]] led by [[Prime Minister of Iran|Prime Minister]] [[Mohammad Mossadegh]] who had attempted to [[nationalize]] Iran's petroleum industry, threatening the profits of the [[Anglo-Iranian Oil Company]], now known as [[BP]].&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Review of Books'', [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2012/aug/16/crass-and-consequential-error/ "A Crass and Consequential Error,"] reviewing the book ''Patriot of Persia: Muhammad Mossadegh and a Tragic Anglo-American Coup'' by [[Christopher de Bellaigue]], 16 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Declassified CIA documents show that Britain was fearful of Iran's plans to nationalize its oil industry and pressed the U.S. to mount a joint operation to depose the prime minister and install a [[puppet regime]].&lt;ref name="NYTsr2000"&gt;{{Cite news

The coup was led by CIA operative [[Kermit Roosevelt, Jr.]] (grandson of President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]). With help from [[British intelligence]], the CIA planned, funded and implemented [[Operation Ajax]].&lt;ref&gt;[[National Security Archive]], cited in "[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB126/index.htm National Security Archive] Muhammad Mosaddeq and the 1953 Coup in Iran", edited by Mark J. Gasiorowski and Malcolm Byrne, Syracuse University Press 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In the months before the coup, the UK and U.S. imposed a boycott of the country, exerted other political pressures, and conducted a massive covert propaganda campaign to create the environment necessary for the coup. The CIA hired Iranian [[agents provocateurs]] who posed as communists, harassed religious leaders and staged the bombing of one cleric's home to turn the Islamic religious community against the government. For the U.S. audience, the CIA hoped to plant articles in U.S. newspapers saying that [[Shah]] [[Mohammed Reza Pahlevi]]'s return to govern Iran resulted from a homegrown revolt against what was being represented to the U.S. public as a communist-leaning government. The CIA successfully used its contacts at the [[Associated Press]] to put on the newswire in the U.S. a statement from [[Tehran]] about royal decrees that the CIA itself had written.&lt;ref name=NYTsr2000/&gt;

The coup initially failed and the Shah fled the country. After four days of rioting, Shi'ite-sparked street protests backed by pro-Shah army units defeated Mossadeq's forces and the Shah returned to power.&lt;ref name="Bayandor2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bayandor|first=Darioush|authorlink=Darioush Bayandor|title=Iran and the CIA: The Fall of Mosaddeq Revisited|date=April 2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-230-57927-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CIA subsequently used the apparent success of their Iranian coup project to bolster their image in American government circles. They expanded their reach into other countries, taking a greater portion of American intelligence assets based on their record in Iran.&lt;ref name=Bayandor2010/&gt;

In August 2013 the CIA admitted that it was involved in both the planning and the execution of the coup, including the bribing of Iranian politicians, security and army high-ranking officials, as well as pro-coup propaganda.&lt;ref name="CIA19532013admission_rt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rt.com/usa/iran-coup-cia-operation-647/|title=CIA finally admits it masterminded Iran’s 1953 coup|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/19/cia-admits-role-1953-iranian-coup|title=CIA admits role in 1953 Iranian coup|first1=Saeed Kamali|last1=Dehghan|first2=Richard|last2=Norton-Taylor|date=19 August 2013|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CIA is quoted acknowledging the coup was carried out "under CIA direction" and "as an act of U.S. foreign policy, conceived and approved at the highest levels of government."&lt;ref name="CIA19532013admission_cnn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/19/politics/cia-iran-1953-coup/index.html|title=In declassified document, CIA acknowledges role in 1953 Iran coup - CNNPolitics.com|first=By Dan Merica and Jason Hanna|last=CNN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Security Archive]] said it that while it "applauds the CIA's decision to make these materials available, today's posting shows clearly that these materials could have been safely declassified many years ago without risk of damage to [[national security]]."&lt;ref name="CIA19532013admission_rt"/&gt;

The '''war on drugs''' is a campaign, led by the [[U.S. federal government]], of [[prohibition of drugs|drug prohibition]], [[military aid]], and [[military intervention]], with the stated aim being to reduce the [[illegal drug trade]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/03/27/472023148/legalize-all-drugs-the-risks-are-tremendous-without-defining-the-problem|title=Legalize All Drugs?

The term was popularized by the media shortly after a press conference given on June 18, 1971, by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]]—the day after publication of a special message from President Nixon to the Congress on Drug Abuse Prevention and Control—during which he declared drug abuse "public enemy number one". That message to the Congress included text about devoting more federal resources to the "prevention of new addicts, and the rehabilitation of those who are addicted", but that part did not receive the same public attention as the term "war on drugs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=3048|title=Richard Nixon: Special Message to the Congress on Drug Abuse Prevention and Control|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nixon Calls War on Drugs"&gt;{{cite news|title=Nixon Calls War on Drugs|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-5IjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RLcFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=973,31915&amp;dq=nixon+war+on+drugs&amp;hl=en|accessdate=October 13, 2012|newspaper=The Palm Beach Post|date=June 18, 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dufton|first=Emily|title=The War on Drugs: How President Nixon Tied Addiction to Crime|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/03/the-war-on-drugs-how-president-nixon-tied-addiction-to-crime/254319/|accessdate=October 13, 2012|newspaper=The Atlantic|date=March 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, two years prior to this, Nixon had formally declared a "war on drugs" that would be directed toward eradication, interdiction, and incarceration.&lt;ref&gt;Payan, Tony (2013).

On May 13, 2009, [[Gil Kerlikowske]]—the Director of the [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]] (ONDCP)—signaled that the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]] did not plan to significantly alter drug enforcement policy, but also that the administration would not use the term "War on Drugs", because Kerlikowske considers the term to be "counter-productive".&lt;ref name="WSJCZAR"&gt;{{Cite news|title=White House Czar Calls for End to 'War on Drugs' |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124225891527617397|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=May 14, 2009|accessdate=May 14, 2009 | first=Gary | last=Fields}}&lt;/ref&gt; ONDCP's view is that "drug addiction is a disease that can be successfully prevented and treated... making drugs more available will make it harder to keep our communities healthy and safe".&lt;ref name="dup2"/&gt; One of the alternatives that Kerlikowske has showcased is the [[drug policy of Sweden]], which seeks to balance public health concerns with opposition to [[drug legalization]].

{{Main|History of United States drug prohibition}}
{{See also|Legal history of cannabis in the United States}}

=== 20th century ===
The first U.S. law that restricted the distribution and use of certain drugs was the [[Harrison Narcotics Tax Act]] of 1914. The first local laws came as early as 1860.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/heroin/etc/history.html |title=Opium Throughout History |publisher=PBS Frontline |accessdate=October 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919, the United States passed the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|18th Amendment]], prohibiting the sale, manufacture, and transportation of [[ethanol|alcohol]], with exceptions for religious and medical use. In 1920, the United States passed the [[National Prohibition Act]] (Volstead Act), enacted to carry out the provisions in law of the 18th Amendment.

The [[Federal Bureau of Narcotics]] was established in the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] by an act of June 14, 1930 (46 Stat. 585).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/170.html#170.3 |title=Records of the Drug Enforcement Administration DEA |publisher=Archives.gov |accessdate=March 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, [[Prohibition in the United States|the federal prohibition for alcohol]] was repealed by passage of the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|21st Amendment]]. In 1935, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] publicly supported the adoption of the [[Uniform State Narcotic Drug Act]]. ''[[The New York Times]]'' used the headline "Roosevelt Asks Narcotic War Aid".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.druglibrary.net/schaffer/History/e1930/rooseveltasks.htm |title=ROOSEVELT ASKS NARCOTIC WAR AID, 1935 |publisher=Druglibrary.net |accessdate=March 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=15024 |title=Letter to the World Narcotic Defense Association.

In 1937, the [[Marihuana Tax Act of 1937]] was passed. Several scholars have claimed that the goal was to destroy the hemp industry,&lt;ref name="nafta-neocolonialism-129"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=French|first1=Laurence|first2=Magdaleno|last2=Manzanárez|title=NAFTA &amp; neocolonialism: comparative criminal, human &amp; social justice|publisher=University Press of America|year=2004|page=129|isbn=978-0-7618-2890-7|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4ozF1Yg-c4MC&amp;pg=PA129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Earlywine, 2005: [https://books.google.com/books?id=r9wPbxMAG8cC&amp;pg=PA24 p. 24]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="under-influence-55"&gt;Peet, 2004: [https://books.google.com/?id=uC0_YznYjScC&amp;pg=PA55 p. 55]&lt;/ref&gt; largely as an effort of businessmen [[Andrew Mellon]], [[Randolph Hearst]], and the [[Du Pont family]].&lt;ref name="nafta-neocolonialism-129" /&gt;&lt;ref name="under-influence-55" /&gt; These scholars argue that with the invention of the [[decorticator]], hemp became a very cheap substitute for the [[paper pulp]] that was used in the newspaper industry.&lt;ref name="nafta-neocolonialism-129" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bound in twine: the history and ecology of the henequen-wheat complex for Mexico and the American and Canadian Plains, 1880–1950|author=Sterling Evans|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press|year=2007|isbn=978-1-58544-596-7|page=27|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_wFkZgyuGFAC&amp;pg=PA27}}&lt;/ref&gt; These scholars believe that Hearst felt{{dubious|date=March 2015}} that this was a threat to his extensive timber holdings.

On October 27, 1970, Congress passed the [[Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970]], which, among other things, categorized controlled substances based on their medicinal use and potential for addiction.&lt;ref name="frontline" /&gt; In 1971, two congressmen released an explosive report on the growing heroin epidemic among U.S. servicemen in Vietnam; ten to fifteen percent of the servicemen were addicted to heroin, and President Nixon declared drug abuse to be "public enemy number one".&lt;ref name="frontline" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dupoint"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/drugs/interviews/dupont.html WGBH educational foundation.

In 1973, the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] was created to replace the [[Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs]].&lt;ref name="frontline" /&gt;

The Nixon Administration also repealed the federal 2–10-year [[mandatory sentencing|mandatory minimum sentences]] for  possession of marijuana and started federal demand reduction programs and drug-treatment programs. [[Robert DuPont]], the "Drug czar" in the Nixon Administration, stated it would be more accurate to say that Nixon ended, rather than launched, the "war on drugs". DuPont also argued that it was the proponents of drug legalization that popularized the term "war on drugs".&lt;ref name="dup2"/&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=February 2014}}

=== 21st century ===
The [[Global Commission on Drug Policy]] released a report on June 2, 2011, alleging that "The War On Drugs Has Failed." The commissioned was made up of 22 self-appointed members including a number of prominent international politicians and writers. U.S. Surgeon General [[Regina Benjamin]] also released the first ever National Prevention Strategy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthcare.gov/center/councils/nphpphc/strategy/index.html National Prevention Strategy, June 16, 2011]. Healthcare.gov (June 16, 2011). {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902021349/http://www.healthcare.gov/center/councils/nphpphc/strategy/index.html |date=September 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 21, 2012, the U.S. Government published an updated version of its Drug Policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/policy-and-research/principles-of-modern-drug-policy Principles of Modern Drug Policy]. Whitehouse.gov.&lt;/ref&gt; The director of [[ONDCP]] stated simultaneously that this policy is something different from the "War on Drugs":
* The U.S. Government sees the policy as a "third way" approach to drug control; an approach that is based on the results of a huge investment in research from some of the world's preeminent scholars on disease of substance abuse.
* The policy does not see drug legalization as the "silver bullet" solution to drug control.
* It is not a policy where success is measured by the number of arrests made or prisons built.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/news-releases-remarks/principles-of-modern-drug-policy-directors-remarks-at-the-world-federation-against-drugs Statement of the Government of the United States of America World Federation Against Drugs 3rd World Forum, May 21, 2012, Stockholm, Sweden]. Whitehouse.gov (September 21, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same meeting was a declaration signed by the representatives of Italy, the Russian Federation, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States in line with this:
"Our approach must be a balanced one, combining effective enforcement to restrict the supply of drugs, with efforts to reduce demand and build recovery; supporting people to live a life free of addiction."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wfad.se/images/articles/Final_statement_WFAD.pdf Joint statement For a humane and balanced drug policy, Stockholm 20 May 2012]. (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016 the [[International Narcotics Control Board]] stated that the International Drug Control treaties do not mandate a "war on drugs."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unis.unvienna.org/unis/en/pressrels/2016/unisnar1264.html INCB Report 2015 – Press material] United Nations Information Service 2.3.2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:US incarceration rate timeline.gif|thumb|upright=1.3|Graph demonstrating increases in [[United States incarceration rate]]]]

According to [[Human Rights Watch]], the War on Drugs caused soaring arrest rates that [[Race and the War on Drugs#African American Communities|disproportionately targeted African Americans]] due to various factors.&lt;ref name="HRW"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/2000/usa/Rcedrg00-05.htm |title=The Impact of the War on Drugs on U.S. Incarceration |date=May 2000 |accessdate = June 10, 2007 |publisher=Human Rights Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Ehrlichman]], an aide to Nixon, said that Nixon used the war on drugs to criminalize and disrupt black and hippie communities and their leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/3/22/11278760/war-on-drugs-racism-nixon|title=Nixon official: real reason for the drug war was to criminalize black people and hippies|author=German Lopez|date=March 23, 2016|website=Vox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The present state of incarceration in the U.S. as a result of the war on drugs arrived in several stages. By 1971, different stops on drugs had been implemented for more than 50 years (for e.g. since 1914, 1937 etc.) with only a very small increase of inmates per 100,000 citizens.
During the first 9 years after Nixon coined the expression "War on Drugs", statistics showed only a minor increase in the total number of imprisoned.

After 1980, the situation began to change. In the 1980s, while the number of arrests for all crimes had risen by 28%, the number of arrests for drug offenses rose 126%.&lt;ref&gt;Austin J, McVey AD. The 1989 NCCD prison population forecast: the impact of the war on drugs. San Francisco: National Council on Crime and Delinquency, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; The result of increased demand was the development of privatization and the [[Incarceration in the United States#Privatization|for-profit prison industry]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Private prison#Development 3|Development of private prisons in the United States]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[US Department of Justice]], reporting on the effects of state initiatives, has stated that, from 1990 through 2000, "the increasing number of drug offenses accounted for 27% of the total growth among black inmates, 7% of the total growth among Hispanic inmates, and 15% of the growth among white inmates." In addition to prison or jail, the United States provides for the deportation of many non-citizens convicted of drug offenses.&lt;ref&gt;[Gabriel J. Chin &amp; Todd Collins, ''A War on Drugs or a War on Immigrants?

In 1994, the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' reported that the "War on Drugs" resulted in the incarceration of one million Americans each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=[[Lester Grinspoon]], M.D.&amp; James B.

===Sentencing disparities===
In 1986, the U.S. Congress passed laws that created a 100 to 1 sentencing disparity for the trafficking ''or possession'' of [[crack cocaine|crack]] when compared to penalties for ''trafficking'' of [[cocaine|powder cocaine]],&lt;ref name="wa-post-dispar-2010"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Congress passes bill to reduce disparity in crack, powder cocaine sentencing|author=Jim Abrams|work=Washington Post|date=July 29, 2010|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/28/AR2010072802969.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="celling-america-246-247"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gates-of-injustice" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = United States Sentencing Commission | title = Cocaine and Federal Sentencing Policy | year = 2002 | page = 6 | url = http://www.ussc.gov/r_congress/02crack/2002crackrpt.pdf | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070715212213/http://www.ussc.gov/r_congress/02crack/2002crackrpt.pdf | archivedate = July 15, 2007 | accessdate=August 24, 2010 | quote = As a result of the 1986 Act ... penalties for a first-time cocaine trafficking offense: 5 grams or more of crack cocaine = five-year mandatory minimum penalty}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had been widely criticized as discriminatory against minorities, mostly blacks, who were more likely to use crack than powder cocaine.&lt;ref name=WashPost&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/02/AR2010080204360.html "The Fair Sentencing Act corrects a long-time wrong in cocaine cases"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', August 3, 2010.

According to [[Human Rights Watch]], crime statistics show that—in the United States in 1999—compared to non-minorities, African Americans were far more likely to be arrested for drug crimes, and received much stiffer penalties and sentences.&lt;ref name="hrw-race-summary-recommendations"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/2000/usa/Rcedrg00.htm#P54_1086|title=I.

Statistics from 1998 show that there were [[Race and the War on Drugs|wide racial disparities in arrests, prosecutions, sentencing and deaths]]. African-American drug users made up for 35% of drug arrests, 55% of convictions, and 74% of people sent to prison for drug possession crimes.&lt;ref name="celling-america-246-247"&gt;Burton-Rose (ed.), 1998: pp. 246–247&lt;/ref&gt; Nationwide African-Americans were sent to state prisons for drug offenses 13 times more often than other races,&lt;ref name="hrw-race-key-findings"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/campaigns/drugs/war/key-facts.htm|title=Key Findings at a Glance|website=Racial Disparities in the War on Drugs|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=February 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though they only supposedly comprised 13% of regular drug users.&lt;ref name="celling-america-246-247" /&gt;
[[File:Marion Barry smoking crack.gif|thumb|right|D.C. Mayor [[Marion Barry]] captured on a surveillance camera smoking crack cocaine during a sting operation by the [[FBI]] and [[D.C. Police]].]]
Anti-drug legislation over time has also displayed an apparent racial bias. University of Minnesota Professor and social justice author [[Michael Tonry]] writes, "The War on Drugs foreseeably and unnecessarily blighted the lives of hundreds and thousands of young disadvantaged black Americans and undermined decades of effort to improve the life chances of members of the urban black underclass."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Tonry, Malign Neglect – Race Crime and Punishment in America (London: Oxford University Press, 1995), 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] decided that the government needed to make an effort to curtail the social unrest that blanketed the country at the time. He decided to focus his efforts on illegal drug use, an approach which was in line with expert opinion on the subject at the time. In the 1960s, it was believed that at least half of the crime in the U.S. was drug related, and this number grew as high as 90 percent in the next decade.&lt;ref&gt;James Inciardi, ''The War on Drugs'' IV, ed. 4. (Delaware: Pearson Allyn and Bacon, 2008), 286.&lt;/ref&gt; He created the Reorganization Plan of 1968 which merged the Bureau of Narcotics and the Bureau of Drug Abuse to form the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs within the Department of Justice.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew B. Whitford and Jeffrey Yates, ''Presidential Rhetoric and the Public Agenda'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2009), 40.&lt;/ref&gt; The belief during this time about drug use was summarized by journalist [[Max Lerner]] in his work ''America as a Civilization'' (1957):

&lt;blockquote&gt;As a case in point we may take the known fact of the prevalence of reefer and dope addiction in Negro areas. This is essentially explained in terms of poverty, slum living, and broken families, yet it would be easy to show the lack of drug addiction among other ethnic groups where the same conditions apply.&lt;ref&gt;Inciardi. ''The War on Drugs IV'', 248.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Richard Nixon]] became president in 1969, and did not back away from the anti-drug precedent set by Johnson. Nixon began orchestrating drug raids nationwide to improve his "watchdog" reputation. Lois B. Defleur, a social historian who studied drug arrests during this period in Chicago, stated that, "police administrators indicated they were making the kind of arrests the public wanted". Additionally, some of Nixon's newly created drug enforcement agencies would resort to illegal practices to make arrests as they tried to meet public demand for arrest numbers. From 1972 to 1973, the Office of Drug Abuse and Law Enforcement performed 6,000 drug arrests in 18 months, the majority of the arrested black.&lt;ref&gt;Whitford and Yates. ''Presidential Rhetoric and the Public Agenda'' 47&lt;/ref&gt;

The next two Presidents, [[Gerald Ford]] and [[Jimmy Carter]], responded with programs that were essentially a continuation of their predecessors. Shortly after [[Ronald Reagan]] became President in 1981 he delivered a speech on the topic. Reagan announced, "We're taking down the surrender flag that has flown over so many drug efforts; we're running up a battle flag."&lt;ref&gt;Whitford and Yates. ''Presidential Rhetoric and the Public Agenda'', 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Then, driven by the 1986 cocaine overdose of black basketball star [[Len Bias]],{{dubious|date=February 2014}} Reagan was able to pass the [[Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986|Anti-Drug Abuse Act]] through Congress. This legislation appropriated an additional $1.7 billion to fund the War on Drugs. More importantly, it established 29 new, mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses. In the entire history of the country up until that point, the legal system had only seen 55 minimum sentences in total.&lt;ref&gt;Jesse Ventura. ''American Conspiracies'' (New York: Skyshore Publishing, 2010), 117.&lt;/ref&gt; A major stipulation of the new sentencing rules included different mandatory minimums for powder and crack cocaine. At the time of the bill, there was public debate as to the difference in potency and effect of powder cocaine, generally used by whites, and crack cocaine, generally used by blacks, with many believing that "crack" was substantially more powerful and addictive. Crack and powder cocaine are closely related chemicals, crack being a smokeable, [[Free base|freebase]] form of powdered cocaine hydrochloride which produces a shorter, more intense high while using less of the drug. This method is more cost effective, and therefore more prevalent on the inner-city streets, while powder cocaine remains more popular in white suburbia. The Reagan administration began shoring public opinion against "crack", encouraging DEA official Robert Putnam to play up the harmful effects of the drug. Stories of "crack whores" and "crack babies" became commonplace; by 1986, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' had declared "crack" the issue of the year.&lt;ref&gt;Michelle Alexander. ''[[The New Jim Crow]]: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness''. (New York: The New Press, 2010), 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Riding the wave of public fervor, Reagan established much harsher sentencing for crack cocaine, handing down stiffer felony penalties for much smaller amounts of the drug.&lt;ref&gt;Whitford and Yates. ''Presidential Rhetoric and the Public Agenda'', 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reagan protégé and former Vice-President George H. W. Bush was next to occupy the oval office, and the drug policy under his watch held true to his political background. Bush maintained the hard line drawn by his predecessor and former boss, increasing narcotics regulation when the First National Drug Control Strategy was issued by the Office of National Drug Control in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Tonry. ''Malign Neglect – Race, Crime and Punishment in America'', 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next three presidents – Clinton, Bush and Obama – continued this trend, maintaining the War on Drugs as they inherited it upon taking office.&lt;ref&gt;Whitford and Yates. Presidential Rhetoric and the Public Agenda. 72&lt;/ref&gt; During this time of passivity by the federal government, it was the states that initiated controversial legislation in the War on Drugs. Racial bias manifested itself in the states through such controversial policies as the "stop and frisk" police practices in New York city and the "three strikes" felony laws began in California in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Michelle Alexander. ''The New Jim Crow – Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness'', 92&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2010, President Obama signed the Fair Sentencing Act into law that dramatically reduced the 100-to-1 sentencing disparity between powder and crack cocaine, which disproportionately affected minorities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:SN01789:@@@L&amp;summ2=m&amp; Bill Summary &amp; Status – 111th Congress (2009–2010) – S.1789 – All Information – THOMAS (Library of Congress)]. Thomas.loc.gov.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commonly used illegal drugs==
Commonly used illegal drugs include [[heroin]], [[cocaine]], [[methamphetamine]], and, [[marijuana]].

Heroin is an [[opiate]] that is highly addictive. If caught selling or possessing heroin, a perpetrator can be charged with a [[felony]] and face two–four years in prison and could be fined to a maximum of $20,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Possession of Heroin|url=http://www.criminalattorney.com/heroin/possession/|website=Criminal Attorney}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Crystal meth]] is composed of methamphetamine hydrochloride. It is marketed as either a white powder or in a solid (rock) form. The possession of crystal meth can result in a punishment varying from a fine to a jail sentence. As with other drug crimes, sentencing length may increase depending on the amount of the drug found in the possession of the defendant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Possession of Crystal Meth|url=http://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/criminal-defense/crystal-meth-possession.htm|website=The Criminal Defense Lawyer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cocaine possession is illegal across the U.S., with the cheaper [[crack cocaine]] incurring even greater penalties. Having possession is when the accused knowingly has it on their person, or in a backpack or purse. The possession of cocaine with no prior conviction, for the first offense, the person will be sentenced to a maximum of one year in prison or fined $1,000, or both. If the person has a prior conviction, whether it is a [[narcotic]] or cocaine, they will be sentenced to two years in prison, a $2,500 fine, or both. With two or more convictions of possession prior to this present offense, they can be sentenced to 90 days in prison along with a $5,000 fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cocaine Possession|url=http://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/criminal-defense/crime-penalties/cocaine-possession.htm|website=The Criminal Defense Lawyer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marijuana is the most popular illegal drug worldwide. The punishment for possession of it is less than for the possession of cocaine or heroin. In some U.S. states, the drug is legal. Over 80 million Americans have tried marijuana. The ''Criminal Defense Lawyer'' article claims that, depending on the age of person and how much the person has been caught for possession, they will be fined and could plea bargain into going to a treatment program versus going to prison. In each state the convictions differ along with how much marijuana they have on their person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marijuana Possession|url=http://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/crime-penalties/federal/Marijuana-Possession.htm|website=The Criminal Defense Lawyer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States foreign policy and covert military activities==
Some scholars have claimed that the phrase "War on Drugs" is propaganda cloaking an extension of earlier military or paramilitary operations.&lt;ref name="Bullington 1990 39–55"/&gt; Others have argued that large amounts of "[[war as metaphor|drug war]]" foreign aid money, training, and equipment actually goes to fighting leftist insurgencies and is often provided to groups who themselves are involved in large-scale narco-trafficking, such as corrupt members of the Colombian military.&lt;ref name="whiteout-chapter-14"/&gt;

===War in Vietnam===
From 1963 to the end of the [[Vietnam War]] in 1975, marijuana usage became common among U.S. soldiers in non-combat situations. Some servicemen also used heroin. Many of the servicemen ended the heroin use after returning to the United States but came home addicted. In 1971, the U.S. military conducted a study of drug use among American servicemen and women. It found that daily usage rates for drugs on a worldwide basis were as low as two percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fisher|first=Alan|title=Preliminary Findings from the 1971 DoD Survey of drug Use|url=http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=AD0743852|publisher=Department of Defense}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the spring of 1971, two congressmen released an alarming report alleging that 15% of the servicemen in Vietnam were addicted to heroin. Marijuana use was also common in Vietnam. Soldiers who used drugs had more disciplinary problems. The frequent drug use had become an issue for the commanders in Vietnam; in 1971 it was estimated that 30,000 servicemen were addicted to drugs, most of them to [[heroin]].&lt;ref name="Nixon Calls War on Drugs"/&gt;

From 1971 on, therefore, returning servicemen were required to take a mandatory heroin test.

===Operation Intercept===
One of the first anti-drug efforts in the realm of foreign policy was President [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]]'s [[Operation Intercept]], announced in September 1969, targeted at reducing the amount of cannabis entering the United States from Mexico. The effort began with an intense inspection crackdown that resulted in an almost shutdown of cross-border traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB86/|title=Operation Intercept: The perils of unilateralism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the burden on border crossings was controversial in border states, the effort only lasted twenty days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.druglibrary.org/Schaffer/library/studies/cu/CU59.html |title=Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit Drugs |publisher=Druglibrary.org |accessdate=March 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation Just Cause===
{{Main|Operation Just Cause|Operation Nifty Package}}
[[File:Panama clashes 1989.JPEG|thumb|right|The U.S. military invasion of Panama in 1989]]
On December 20, 1989, the United States invaded Panama as part of [[Operation Just Cause]], which involved 25,000 American troops. Gen. [[Manuel Noriega]], head of the government of Panama, had been giving military assistance to [[Contras|Contra groups]] in Nicaragua at the request of the U.S. which, in exchange, tolerated his drug trafficking activities, which they had known about since the 1960s.&lt;ref name="whiteout-noriega" /&gt;&lt;ref name="panama-buckley"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Buckley|first=Kevin|title=Panama: The Whole Story|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=1991|isbn=978-0-671-72794-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) tried to indict Noriega in 1971, the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] prevented them from doing so.&lt;ref name="whiteout-noriega"&gt;Cockburn and St. Clair, 1998: pp. 287–290&lt;/ref&gt; The CIA, which was then directed by future president [[George H. W. Bush]], provided Noriega with hundreds of thousands of dollars per year as payment for his work in Latin America.&lt;ref name="whiteout-noriega"/&gt; When CIA pilot [[Eugene Hasenfus]] was shot down over Nicaragua by the [[Sandinistas]], documents aboard the plane revealed many of the CIA's activities in Latin America, and the CIA's connections with Noriega became a [[public relations]] "liability" for the U.S. government, which finally allowed the DEA to indict him for drug trafficking, after decades of tolerating his drug operations.&lt;ref name="whiteout-noriega" /&gt; Operation Just Cause, whose purpose was to capture Noriega and overthrow his government; Noriega found temporary asylum in the [[Papal Nuncio]], and surrendered to U.S. soldiers on January 3, 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Baker |first=Russell|title= OBSERVER; Is This Justice Necessary?|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE5DF123FF930A35752C0A966958260|date=January 3, 1990|work=The New York Times Company|accessdate=March 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was sentenced by a court in Miami to 45 years in prison.&lt;ref name="whiteout-noriega" /&gt;

===Plan Colombia===
{{Main|Plan Colombia|Paramilitarism in Colombia}}
{{US involvement in Colombia}}

As part of its [[Plan Colombia]] program, the United States government currently provides hundreds of millions of dollars per year of [[military aid]], training, and equipment to Colombia,&lt;ref name="house-colombia-appropriations"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://Fappropriations.house.gov/pdf/FY10_SFOPS_Conference_Summary.pdf|title=SUMMARY: FY 2010 STATE AND FOREIGN OPERATIONS APPROPRIATIONS|year=2010|website=U.S. House of Representatives|accessdate=February 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; to fight left-wing guerrillas such as the [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia]] (FARC-EP), which has been accused of being involved in drug trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;Weiser, Benjamin.

Private U.S. corporations have signed contracts to carry out anti-drug activities as part of Plan Colombia. [[DynCorp]], the largest private company involved, was among those contracted by the State Department, while others signed contracts with the Defense Department.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.colectivodeabogados.org/article.php3?id_article=1253 Private Security Transnational Enterprises in Colombia]'' [[José Alvear Restrepo Lawyers' Collective]] February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Colombian military personnel have received extensive [[counterinsurgency]] training from U.S. military and law enforcement agencies, including the [[School of Americas]] (SOA). Author Grace Livingstone has stated that more Colombian SOA graduates have been implicated in human rights abuses than currently known SOA graduates from any other country. All of the commanders of the brigades highlighted in a 2001 [[Human Rights Watch]] report on Colombia were graduates of the SOA, including the III brigade in [[Valle del Cauca]], where the 2001 [[Paramilitarism in Colombia#The Alto Naya massacre|Alto Naya Massacre]] occurred. US-trained officers have been accused of being directly or indirectly involved in many atrocities during the 1990s, including the [[Massacre of Trujillo]] and the 1997 [[Mapiripán Massacre]].

In 2000, the Clinton administration initially waived all but one of the human rights conditions attached to Plan Colombia, considering such aid as crucial to national security at the time.&lt;ref name="doug"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Stokes |first=Doug |title=America's Other War: Terrorizing Colombia |url=http://bailey83221.livejournal.com/54324.html |publisher=Zed Books |year=2005 |isbn=978-1-84277-547-9 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109132325/http://bailey83221.livejournal.com/54324.html |archivedate=January 9, 2016 |df=mdy-all }} p.&amp;nbsp;99&lt;/ref&gt;

The efforts of U.S. and Colombian governments have been criticized for focusing on fighting leftist guerrillas in southern regions without applying enough pressure on right-wing paramilitaries and continuing drug smuggling operations in the north of the country.&lt;ref name="soa-gill-180"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gill|first=Leslie|title=The School of the Americas: military training and political violence in the Americas|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2004|isbn=978-0-8223-3392-0|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IqPqwx0SXfMC&amp;pg=PA180}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="under-influence-61"&gt;Peet, 2004: [https://books.google.com/?id=uC0_YznYjScC&amp;pg=PA61 p. 61]&lt;/ref&gt; Human Rights Watch, congressional committees and other entities have documented the existence of connections between members of the Colombian military and the [[United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia|AUC]], which the U.S. government has listed as a terrorist group, and that Colombian military personnel have committed human rights abuses which would make them ineligible for U.S. aid under current laws.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

In 2010, the [[Washington Office on Latin America]] concluded that both Plan Colombia and the Colombian government's security strategy "came at a high cost in lives and resources, only did part of the job, are yielding diminishing returns and have left important institutions weaker."&lt;ref&gt;Washington Office on Latin America [http://www.wola.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=viewp&amp;id=1134&amp;Itemid=2 "Columbia: Don't Call it a Model"], July 13, 2010 Retrieved on May 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 report by the [[RAND Corporation]], which was issued to analyze viable strategies for the Mexican drug war considering successes experienced in Columbia, noted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Between 1999 and 2002, the United States gave Colombia $2.04 billion in aid, 81 percent of which was for military purposes, placing Colombia just below Israel and Egypt among the largest recipients of U.S. military assistance. Colombia increased its defense spending from 3.2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2000 to 4.19 percent in 2005. Overall, the results were extremely positive. Greater spending on infrastructure and social programs helped the Colombian government increase its political legitimacy, while improved security forces were better able to consolidate control over large swaths of the country previously overrun by insurgents and drug cartels.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It also notes that, "Plan Colombia has been widely hailed as a success, and some analysts believe that, by 2010, Colombian security forces had finally gained the upper hand once and for all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mexico Is Not Colombia|url=https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR500/RR548z2/RAND_RR548z2.pdf|website=rand.org|publisher=RAND Corporation National Security Research Division|accessdate=October 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MilitaresMichoacán.jpg|thumb|Mexico is scheduled to receive US$1.6 billion in equipment and strategic support from the United States through the [[Mérida Initiative]]]]

===Mérida Initiative===
The [[Mérida Initiative]] is a security cooperation between the United States and the government of Mexico and the countries of [[Central America]]. It was approved on June 30, 2008, and its stated aim is combating the threats of drug trafficking and transnational crime. The Mérida Initiative appropriated $1.4 billion in a three-year commitment (2008–2010) to the Mexican government for military and law enforcement training and equipment, as well as technical advice and training to strengthen the national justice systems. The Mérida Initiative targeted many very important government officials, but it failed to address the thousands of Central Americans who had to flee their countries due to the danger they faced everyday because of the war on drugs. There is still not any type of plan that addresses these people. No weapons are included in the plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.janes.com/news/defence/business/jdw/jdw071211_1_n.shtml |title=Mexico's 2008 defence budget goes under review |publisher=Janes.com |accessdate=March 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0508/10180.html |title=Bush pushes Mexico money in Iraq bill |publisher=Politico.com |accessdate=March 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aerial herbicide application===
{{Main|Plan Colombia#Fumigation strategy and criticisms}}
The United States regularly sponsors the spraying of large amounts of [[herbicide]]s such as [[glyphosate]] over the jungles of Central and South America as part of its drug eradication programs. Environmental consequences resulting from aerial fumigation have been criticized as detrimental to some of the world's most fragile ecosystems;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rebecca Bowe | title = The drug war on the Amazon | journal = E: The Environmental Magazine | issue = Nov–Dec | year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; the same aerial fumigation practices are further credited with causing health problems in local populations.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite news | author = Larry Rohter | title = To Colombians, Drug War is a Toxic Foe | publisher = The New York Times | date = May 1, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. operations in Honduras===
In 2012, the U.S. sent DEA agents to Honduras to assist security forces in counternarcotics operations. Honduras has been a major stop for drug traffickers, who use small planes and landing strips hidden throughout the country to transport drugs. The U.S. government made agreements with several Latin American countries to share intelligence and resources to counter the drug trade. DEA agents, working with other U.S. agencies such as the State Department, the CBP, and Joint Task Force-Bravo, assisted Honduras troops in conducting raids on traffickers' sites of operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A New Front Line in the U.S. Drug War|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/01/world/americas/honduran-drug-raid-deaths-wont-alter-us-policy.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=October 13, 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=May 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ONDCP Pothead.gif|thumb|An American domestic government propaganda poster circa 2000 concerning [[cannabis in the United States]].]]

The War on Drugs has been a highly contentious issue since its inception. A poll on October 2, 2008, found that three in four Americans believed that the War On Drugs was failing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zogby.com/news/readnews.cfm?ID=1568 |title=Public Views Clash with U.S. Policy on Cuba, Immigration, and Drugs |accessdate=May 10, 2010 |date=October 2, 2008 |publisher=Zogby International |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100211052209/http://www.zogby.com/news/ReadNews.cfm?ID=1568 |archivedate=February 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, a Pew Research Center poll found more than six in ten Americans state that state governments moving away from mandatory prison terms for drug law violations is a good thing. while three out of ten Americans say these policy changes are a bad thing. This a substantial shift from the same poll questions since 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/january_2018/voters_have_little_faith_in_war_on_druSince|title=Voters Have Little Faith in War on Drugs|last=|first=|date=January 10, 2018|website=Rasmussen Reports|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 a Pew Research Center poll found that 67 percent of Americans feel that a movement towards treatment for drugs like cocaine and heroin is better versus the 26 percent who feel that prosecution is the better route.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.people-press.org/2014/04/02/americas-new-drug-policy-landscape/|title=America’s New Drug Policy Landscape {{!}} Pew Research Center|date=2014-04-02|work=Pew Research Center for the People and the Press|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Rasmussen Report poll found that less than 10 percent of Americans think that the War on Drugs is being won and that 75 percent found that Americans believe that America is not winning the War on Drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.drugpolicy.org/press-release/2014/04/new-pew-poll-confirms-americans-ready-end-war-drugs|title=New Pew Poll Confirms Americans Ready to End War on Drugs|website=Drug Policy Alliance|language=en|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mexican citizens, unlike American citizens, support the current measures their government were taking against drug cartels in the War on Drugs. A Pew Research Center poll in 2010 found that 80 percent supported the current use of the army in the War on Drugs to combat drug traffickers with about 55 percent saying that they have been making progress in the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2010/08/12/mexicans-continue-support-for-drug-war/|title=Mexicans Continue Support for Drug War {{!}} Pew Research Center|date=2010-08-12|work=Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Project|access-date=2018-10-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later in 2011 a Pew Research Center poll uncovered that 71 percent of Mexicans find that "illegal drugs are a very big problem in their country". 77 percent of Mexicans also found that drug cartels and the violence associated with them are as well a big challenge for Mexico. The poll also found that the percentages believing that that illegal drugs and violence related to the cartel where Higher in the North with 87 percent for illegal drug use and 94 percent cartel related violence being a problem. This compared to the other locations: South, Mexico City and the greater area of Mexico City, and Central Mexico which are all about 18 percent or lower than the North on Illegal drug use being a problem for the country. These perspective areas are also lower than the North by 19 percent or more on the issue of drug cartel related violence being an issue for the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2011/08/31/crime-and-drug-cartels-top-concerns-in-mexico/|title=Crime and Drug Cartels Top Concerns in Mexico|date=2011-08-31|work=Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Project|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 a Pew Research Center poll found that 74 percent of Mexican citizens would support the training of their police and military, the poll also found that another 55 percent would support the supplying of weapons and financial aid. Though the poll indicates a support of U.S. aid, 59 percent were against troops on the ground by the U.S. military.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/07/16/mexican-public-favors-military-use-u-s-aid-to-fight-drug-cartels/|title=Mexican public favors military use, U.S. aid to fight drug cartels {{!}} Pew Research Center|work=Pew Research Center|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2013 Pew Research Center found in a poll that 56 percent of Mexican citizens believe that the United States and Mexico are both to blame for drug violence in Mexico. In that same poll 20 percent believe that the United States is solely to blame and 17 percent believe that Mexico is solely to blame.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2013/04/29/u-s-image-rebounds-in-mexico/|title=U.S. Image Rebounds in Mexico|date=2013-04-29|work=Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Project|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a meeting in Guatemala in 2012, three former presidents from Guatemala, Mexico and Colombia said that the war on drugs had failed and that they would propose a discussion on alternatives, including decriminalization, at the [[Summit of the Americas]] in April of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.economist.com/node/21551550 |title= Politics this week |date= March 31, 2012 |journal= The Economist |accessdate=April 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guatemalan President [[Otto Pérez Molina]] said that the war on drugs was exacting too high a price on the lives of Central Americans and that it was time to "end the [[taboo]] on discussing decriminalization".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-17502417 BBC News – Guatemala's president urges debate on drug legalisation]. Bbc.co.uk (March 25, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; At the summit, the government of Colombia pushed for the most far-reaching change to drugs policy since the war on narcotics was declared by Nixon four decades prior, citing the catastrophic effects it had had in Colombia.&lt;ref name = "EdVu 15Apr2012"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/15/colombia-global-drugs-taskforce |title= Colombia calls for global drugs taskforce |author= Ed Vulliamy |date= April 15, 2012 |newspaper= The Observer |accessdate=April 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several critics have compared the wholesale incarceration of the dissenting minority of drug users to the wholesale incarceration of other minorities in history. Psychiatrist [[Thomas Szasz]], for example, wrote in 1997 "Over the past thirty years, we have replaced the medical-political persecution of illegal sex users ('perverts' and 'psychopaths') with the even more ferocious medical-political persecution of illegal drug users."&lt;ref&gt;''The Manufacture of Madness: A Comparative Study of the Inquisition and the Mental Health Movement'' (1997), p. xi&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socio-economic effects==

===Creation of a permanent underclass===
[[File:Utah State Prison Wasatch Facility.jpg|thumb|Circa 1 million people are [[United States incarceration rate|incarcerated every year in the United States]] for drug law violations.]]

Penalties for drug crimes among American youth almost always involve permanent or semi-permanent removal from opportunities for education, [[Felony disenfranchisement|strip them of voting rights]], and later involve creation of criminal records which make employment more difficult.&lt;ref name="howto-construct-underclass"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.law.columbia.edu/4cs/files/2008/11/blumenson-and-nilsenlawrev.pdf|title=How to construct an underclass, ''or'' how the War on Drugs became a war on education |last=Blumenson |first=Eric |author2=Eva S. Nilsen  |date=May 16, 2002 |format=PDF |publisher=Drug Policy Forum of Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, some authors maintain that the War on Drugs has resulted in the creation of a permanent underclass of people who have few educational or job opportunities, often as a result of being punished for drug offenses which in turn have resulted from attempts to earn a living in spite of having no education or job opportunities.&lt;ref name="howto-construct-underclass" /&gt;

===Costs to taxpayers===
According to a 2008 study published by [[Harvard]] economist [[Jeffrey A. Miron]], the annual savings on enforcement and incarceration costs from the legalization of drugs would amount to roughly $41.3 billion, with $25.7 billion being saved among the states and over $15.6 billion accrued for the federal government. Miron further estimated at least $46.7 billion in tax revenue based on rates comparable to those on [[tobacco]] and [[alcohol]] ($8.7 billion from [[marijuana]], $32.6 billion from [[cocaine]] and [[heroin]], remainder from other drugs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/DrugProhibitionWP.pdf|title=The Budgetary Impact of Ending Drug Prohibition |publisher=CATO.org |author1=Jeffrey A. Miron  |author2=Katherine Waldock |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low taxation in Central American countries has been credited with weakening the region's response in dealing with drug traffickers. Many cartels, especially [[Los Zetas]] have taken advantage of the limited resources of these nations. 2010 tax revenue in [[El Salvador]], [[Guatemala]], and [[Honduras]], composed just 13.53% of GDP. As a comparison, in [[Chile]] and the U.S., taxes were 18.6% and 26.9% of GDP respectively. However, [[direct taxes]] on income are very hard to enforce and in some cases tax evasion is seen as a national pastime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coha.org/low-taxation-perpetuates-insecurity-in-central-america/|title=Low Taxation Perpetuates Insecurity in Central America|website=COHA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact on growers===
The status of [[coca]] and coca growers has become an intense political issue in several countries, including Colombia and particularly Bolivia, where the president, [[Evo Morales]], a former coca growers' union leader, has promised to legalise the traditional cultivation and use of coca.&lt;ref name="Conflict"&gt;Ledebur, K. and Youngers, C. 2013. From Conflict to Collaboration: An Innovative Approach to Reducing Coca Cultivation in Bolivia. [[Stability: International Journal of Security and Development]] 2(1):9, DOI: http://stabilityjournal.org/article/view/sta.aw&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, legalization efforts have yielded some successes under the Morales administration when combined with aggressive and targeted eradication efforts. The country saw a 12–13% decline in coca cultivation&lt;ref name="Conflict" /&gt; in 2011 under Morales, who has used coca growers' federations to ensure compliance with the law rather than providing a primary role for security forces.&lt;ref name="Conflict" /&gt;

The coca eradication policy has been criticised for its negative impact on the livelihood of coca growers in South America. In many areas of South America the coca leaf has traditionally been chewed and used in tea and for religious, medicinal and nutritional purposes by locals.&lt;ref name="wa-times-bolivian-coca-growers-fight"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/211-development/44365.html|title=Bolivian Coca Growers Fight Eradication|last=Lindsay|first=Reed|date=March 25, 2003 |work=Washington Times|accessdate=February 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason many insist that the illegality of traditional coca cultivation is unjust. In many areas the U.S. government and military has forced the eradication of coca without providing for any meaningful alternative crop for farmers, and has additionally destroyed many of their food or market crops, leaving them starving and destitute.&lt;ref name="wa-times-bolivian-coca-growers-fight" /&gt;

==Allegations of U.S. government assistance in drug trafficking==
{{further|Allegations of CIA drug trafficking}}

The CIA, DEA, State Department, and several other U.S. government agencies have been alleged to have relations with various groups which are involved in drug trafficking.

===CIA and Contra cocaine trafficking===
{{further|CIA and Contras cocaine trafficking in the US}}

[[US Senate|Senator]] [[John Kerry]]'s 1988 [[U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations]] report on Contra drug links concludes that members of the U.S. State Department "who provided support for the Contras are involved in drug trafficking... and elements of the Contras themselves knowingly receive financial and material assistance from drug traffickers."&lt;ref&gt;Cockburn and St. Clair, 1998: {{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report further states that "the Contra drug links include... payments to drug traffickers by the [[U.S. State Department]] of funds authorized by the Congress for humanitarian assistance to the Contras, in some cases after the traffickers had been indicted by federal law enforcement agencies on drug charges, in others while traffickers were under active investigation by these same agencies."

In 1996, journalist [[Gary Webb]] published reports in the ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'', and later in his book ''[[Dark Alliance]]'', detailing how [[Contras]], had been involved in distributing [[crack cocaine]] into Los Angeles whilst receiving money from the CIA.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Contras used money from drug trafficking to buy weapons.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Webb's premise regarding the U.S. Government connection was initially attacked at the time by the media. It is now widely accepted that Webb's main assertion of government "knowledge of drug operations, and collaboration with and protection of known drug traffickers" was correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = National Security Archive Electronic Briefing Book No. 2 – The Contras, Cocaine, and Covert Operations | url = http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB2/nsaebb2.htm |accessdate=August 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=April 2017}} In 1998, CIA [[Inspector General]] [[Frederick Hitz]] published a two-volume report&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Frederick Hitz | title = CIA Inspector General report into allegations of connections between the CIA and the Contras in cocaine trafficking to the United States | publisher = [[CIA]] | year=  1998 | url = https://www.cia.gov/library/reports/general-reports-1/cocaine/report/index.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; that while seemingly refuting Webb's claims of knowledge and collaboration in its conclusions did not deny them in its body.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Hitz went on to [[CIA and Contras cocaine trafficking in the US#Testimony of the CIA Inspector General|admit]] CIA improprieties in the affair in testimony to a House congressional committee.

===Heroin trafficking operations involving the CIA, U.S. Navy and Sicilian Mafia===

According to Rodney Campbell, an editorial assistant to Nelson Rockefeller, during World War II, the United States Navy, concerned that strikes and labor disputes in U.S. eastern shipping ports would disrupt wartime logistics, released the mobster [[Lucky Luciano]] from prison, and collaborated with him to help the mafia take control of those ports. Labor union members were terrorized and murdered by mafia members as a means of preventing labor unrest and ensuring smooth shipping of supplies to Europe.&lt;ref name="luciano-project-campbell"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Campbell|first=Rodney|title=The Luciano Project: The Secret Wartime Collaboration Between the Mafia and the U.S. Navy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V-KEAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Luciano+release#search_anchor|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1977|isbn=978-0-07-009674-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Alexander Cockburn and Jeffrey St. Clair, in order to prevent [[Italian Communist Party|Communist]] party members from being elected in Italy following World War II, the CIA worked closely with the [[Sicilian Mafia]], protecting them and assisting in their worldwide heroin smuggling operations. The mafia was in conflict with leftist groups and was involved in assassinating, torturing, and beating leftist political organizers.&lt;ref name = "whiteout-luckys-break"&gt;Cockburn and St. Clair, 1998: Chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, the US Defense Department funded a two-year study by the [[RAND Corporation]], which found that the use of the armed forces to interdict drugs coming into the United States would have little or no effect on cocaine traffic and might, in fact, raise the profits of cocaine cartels and manufacturers. The 175-page study, "Sealing the Borders: The Effects of Increased Military Participation in Drug Interdiction", was prepared by seven researchers, mathematicians and economists at the National Defense Research Institute, a branch of the RAND, and was released in 1988. The study noted that seven prior studies in the past nine years, including one by the Center for Naval Research and the Office of Technology Assessment, had come to similar conclusions. Interdiction efforts, using current armed forces resources, would have almost no effect on cocaine importation into the United States, the report concluded.&lt;ref&gt;Peter H. Reuter, ''Sealing the borders: the effects of increased military participation in drug interdiction'' (RAND 1988); Robert E. Kessler, "Study: Military Can't Curb Drugs", ''Newsday'', May 23, 1988 at 23; "Military support would have little effect on drug smuggling, study says", United Press International, March 4, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early-to-mid-1990s, the [[Clinton administration]] ordered and funded a major cocaine policy study, again by RAND. The Rand Drug Policy Research Center study concluded that $3 billion should be switched from federal and local law enforcement to treatment. The report said that treatment is the cheapest way to cut drug use, stating that drug treatment is twenty-three times more effective than the supply-side "war on drugs".&lt;ref&gt;C. Peter Rydell, ''Controlling Cocaine: Supply Versus Demand Programs'' (Rand Drug Policy Research Center 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] Committee on Data and Research for Policy on Illegal Drugs published its findings in 2001 on the efficacy of the drug war. The NRC Committee found that existing studies on efforts to address drug usage and smuggling, from U.S. military operations to eradicate coca fields in Colombia, to domestic drug treatment centers, have all been inconclusive, if the programs have been evaluated at all: "The existing drug-use monitoring systems are strikingly inadequate to support the full range of policy decisions that the nation must make.... It is unconscionable for this country to continue to carry out a public policy of this magnitude and cost without any way of knowing whether and to what extent it is having the desired effect."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081205024427/http://www.dpeg.org/dpeg_2001_spg.pdf Drug Policy News], Drug Policy Education Group, Vol. 2 No.1, Spring/Summer 2001, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The study, though not ignored by the press, was ignored by top-level policymakers, leading Committee Chair [[Charles Manski]] to conclude, as one observer notes, that "the drug war has no interest in its own results".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drugsense.org/dsw/2001/ds01.n215.html "Weekly News in Review"], ''DrugSense Weekly'', August 31, 2001 #215&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-1995, the US government tried to reduce the supply of [[methamphetamine]] precursors to disrupt the market of this drug. According to a 2009 study, this effort was successful, but its effects were largely temporary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dobkin|first1=Carlos|last2=Nicosia|first2=Nancy|title=The War on Drugs: Methamphetamine, Public Health, and Crime|journal=American Economic Review|date=February 2009|volume=99|issue=1|pages=324–349|doi=10.1257/aer.99.1.324|pmid=20543969|pmc=2883188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[Prohibition in the United States|alcohol prohibition]], the period from 1920 to 1933, alcohol use initially fell but began to increase as early as 1922. It has been extrapolated that even if prohibition had not been repealed in 1933, alcohol consumption would have quickly surpassed pre-prohibition levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa-157.html |title=Alcohol Prohibition Was a Failure |publisher=Cato.org |date=July 17, 1991 |accessdate=March 27, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131229232307/http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa-157.html |archivedate=December 29, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; One argument against the War on Drugs is that it uses similar measures as Prohibition and is no more effective.

In the six years from 2000 to 2006, the U.S. spent $4.7 billion on [[Plan Colombia]], an effort to eradicate coca production in Colombia. The main result of this effort was to shift coca production into more remote areas and force other forms of adaptation. The overall acreage cultivated for coca in Colombia at the end of the six years was found to be the same, after the U.S. Drug Czar's office announced a change in measuring methodology in 2005 and included new areas in its surveys.&lt;ref name = "est"&gt;{{cite web| date =April 14, 2006 | url =http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/news/press06/041406.html | title =2005 Coca Estimates for Colombia | publisher =Office of National Drug Control Policy |accessdate=October 4, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927234649/http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/news/press06/041406.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = September 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultivation in the neighboring countries of Peru and Bolivia increased, some would describe this effect like squeezing a balloon.&lt;ref&gt;Juan Forero, "Colombia's Coca Survives U.S. plan to uproot it", ''The New York Times'', August 19, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alberto Fujimori]], president of Peru from 1990 to 2000, described U.S. foreign drug policy as "failed" on grounds that 

&lt;blockquote&gt;for 10 years, there has been a considerable sum invested by the Peruvian government and another sum on the part of the American government, and this has not led to a reduction in the supply of coca leaf offered for sale. Rather, in the 10 years from 1980 to 1990, it grew 10-fold.&lt;ref&gt;Don Podesta and Douglas Farah, "Drug Policy in Andes Called Failure", ''[[Washington Post]]'', March 27, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The aforementioned economists published an open letter to President [[George W. Bush]] stating "We urge...the country to commence an open and honest debate about marijuana prohibition... At a minimum, this debate will force advocates of current policy to show that prohibition has benefits sufficient to justify the cost to [[taxpayer]]s, foregone tax revenues and numerous ancillary consequences that result from marijuana prohibition."

The declaration from the World Forum Against Drugs, 2008 state that a balanced policy of drug abuse prevention, education,
treatment, law enforcement, research, and supply reduction provides the most effective platform to reduce drug abuse and its associated harms and call on governments to consider [[demand reduction]] as one of their first priorities in the fight against drug abuse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wfad.se/about-wfad/wfad-declaration Declaration of World Forum Against Drugs, Stockholm 2008.

==Legality==
{{Main|Legality of the War on Drugs}}

The legality of the War on Drugs has been challenged on four main grounds in the U.S.
# It is argued that drug prohibition, as presently implemented, violates the [[substantive due process]] doctrine in that its benefits do not justify the encroachments on rights that are supposed to be guaranteed by the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]] Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. On July 27, 2011, U.S. District Judge Mary S. Scriven ruled that Florida's legislation purporting to eliminate intent as an element of the crime of drug possession was unconstitutional. Commentators explained the ruling in terms of due process.
# Freedom of religious conscience legally allows some (for example, members of the [[Native American Church]]) to use [[peyote]] with definite spiritual or religious motives. The sacramental use of [[dimethyltryptamine]] in the form of [[ayahuasca]] is also allowed for members of [[União do Vegetal]]. The [[Free Exercise Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] implies no requirement for someone to be affiliated to an official church – therefore leaving some ambiguity.
# It has been argued that the [[Commerce Clause]] means that the power to regulate drug use should be state law not federal law.
# The inequity of prosecuting the war on certain drugs but not alcohol or tobacco has also been called into question.

==Alternatives==
{{See also|Responsible drug use}}
Several authors believe that the United States' federal and state governments have chosen wrong methods for combatting the distribution of illicit substances. Aggressive, heavy-handed enforcement funnels individuals through courts and prisons; instead of treating the cause of the addiction, the focus of government efforts has been on punishment. By making drugs illegal rather than regulating them, the War on Drugs creates a highly profitable black market. [[Jefferson Fish]] has edited scholarly collections of articles offering a wide variety of public health based and rights based alternative drug policies.&lt;ref&gt;Fish, J. M. (Ed.) (1998). ''How to legalize drugs''. Northvale, New Jersey: Jason Aronson.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fish, J. M. (Ed.) (2000). "Is our drug policy effective? Are there alternatives?" New York City, New York: ''Fordham Urban Law Journal''. (Proceedings of the March 17 &amp; 18, 2000 joint conference of the New York Academy of Sciences, New York Academy of Medicine, and Association of the Bar of the City of New York. Vol. 23, No. 1, pp. 3–262.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fish, J. M. (Ed.) (2006). ''Drugs and society: U. S. public policy''. Lanham, Maryland: Rowman &amp; Littlefield.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year 2000, the United States drug-control budget reached 18.4 billion dollars,&lt;ref name="Alter, Jonathan 2001, pp. 37-43"&gt;Alter, Jonathan. "The War on Addiction". ''Newsweek'', February 12, 2001, pp. 37–43&lt;/ref&gt; nearly half of which was spent financing law enforcement while only one sixth was spent on treatment. In the year 2003, 53 percent of the requested drug control budget was for enforcement, 29 percent for treatment, and 18 percent for prevention.&lt;ref&gt;''How Goes the "War on Drugs": An Assessment of U.S. Drug Problems and Policy''. RAND Corporation Drug Policy Research Center, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The state of New York, in particular, designated 17 percent of its budget towards substance-abuse-related spending. Of that, a mere one percent was put towards prevention, treatment, and research.

In a survey taken by Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), it was found that substance abusers that remain in treatment longer are less likely to resume their former drug habits. Of the people that were studied, 66 percent were cocaine users. After experiencing long-term in-patient treatment, only 22 percent returned to the use of cocaine. Treatment had reduced the number of cocaine abusers by two-thirds.&lt;ref name="Alter, Jonathan 2001, pp. 37-43"/&gt; By spending the majority of its money on law enforcement, the federal government had underestimated the true value of drug-treatment facilities and their benefit towards reducing the number of addicts in the U.S.

In 2004 the federal government issued the National Drug Control Strategy. It supported programs designed to expand treatment options, enhance treatment delivery, and improve treatment outcomes. For example, the Strategy provided SAMHSA with a $100.6 million grant to put towards their Access to Recovery (ATR) initiative. ATR is a program that provides vouchers to addicts to provide them with the means to acquire clinical treatment or recovery support. The project's goals are to expand capacity, support client choice, and increase the array of faith-based and community based providers for clinical treatment and recovery support services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atr.samhsa.gov/|title=Recovery to Practice Resources|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ATR program will also provide a more flexible array of services based on the individual's treatment needs.

The 2004 Strategy additionally declared a significant 32 million dollar raise in the Drug Courts Program, which provides drug offenders with alternatives to incarceration. As a substitute for imprisonment, drug courts identify substance-abusing offenders and place them under strict court monitoring and community supervision, as well as provide them with long-term treatment services.&lt;ref name="whitehouse-policy-2004"&gt;[http://whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/publications/policy/ndcs04/index.html The President's National Drug Control Strategy], ''White House'', 2004. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213091104/http://whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/publications/policy/ndcs04/index.html |date=February 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a report issued by the National Drug Court Institute, drug courts have a wide array of benefits, with only 16.4 percent of the nation's drug court graduates rearrested and charged with a felony within one year of completing the program (versus the 44.1% of released prisoners who end up back in prison within 1-year). Additionally, enrolling an addict in a drug court program costs much less than incarcerating one in prison.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Huddleston, C. West III, et al. ''Painting the Current Picture: A National Report Card on Drug Courts and Other Problem Solving Court Programs in the United States'', Vol. 1, Num. 1, May 2004&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Bureau of Prisons, the fee to cover the average cost of incarceration for Federal inmates in 2006 was $24,440.&lt;ref&gt;Lappin, Harley G. Annual Determination of Average Cost of Incarceration. Department of Justice – Bureau of Prisons. June 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The annual cost of receiving treatment in a drug court program ranges from $900 to $3,500. Drug courts in New York State alone saved $2.54 million in incarceration costs.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Describing the failure of the War on Drugs, ''New York Times'' columnist Eduardo Porter noted:

{{quote|Jeffrey Miron, an economist at Harvard who studies drug policy closely, has suggested that legalizing all illicit drugs would produce net benefits to the United States of some $65 billion a year, mostly by cutting public spending on enforcement as well as through reduced crime and corruption. A study by analysts at the RAND Corporation, a California research organization, suggested that if marijuana were legalized in California and the drug spilled from there to other states, Mexican drug cartels would lose about a fifth of their annual income of some $6.5 billion from illegal exports to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Porter |first= Eduardo |date= July 3, 2012 |title= Numbers Tell of Failure in Drug War |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/04/business/in-rethinking-the-war-on-drugs-start-with-the-numbers.html |work=The New York Times |accessdate=4 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Many believe that the War on Drugs has been costly and ineffective largely because inadequate emphasis is placed on treatment of [[addiction]]. The United States leads the world in both recreational drug usage and incarceration rates. 70% of men arrested in metropolitan areas test positive for an illicit substance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.foxnews.com/health/2012/05/17/data-suggests-drug-treatment-can-lower-us-crime/ |title= Data Suggests Drug Treatment can Lower U.S. Crime |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= May 17, 2012 |agency=Reuters |accessdate=November 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 54% of all men incarcerated will be repeat offenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= English |first= Matthew |date= September 30, 2012 |title=U.S. Prison System Needs Reform, Does not Meet Intended Goals |url=http://www.collegiatetimes.com/stories/15927/us-prison-system-needs-reform-does-not-meet-intended-goals |work= Collegiate Times |accessdate=November 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wildlife smuggling''' or trafficking involves the illegal gathering, transportation, and distribution of animals and their derivatives. This can be done either internationally or domestically. Estimates of the money generated by wildlife smuggling vary, in part because of its illegal nature. "Wildlife smuggling is estimated at $7.8bn to $10bn a year, according to the U.S. State Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/e/oes/ecw/wlt/|title=Wildlife Trafficking|website=www.state.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. State Department also lists wildlife trafficking as the third most valuable illicit commerce in the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/wildlife-trafficking-149079896/|title=Wildlife Trafficking|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2018-10-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;The illegal nature of such activities make determining the amount of money involved incredibly difficult. When considered with illegal timber and fisheries, wildlife trafficking is a major illegal trade along with [[narcotics]], human trafficking, and counterfeit products.&lt;ref name="Transnational Crime in the Developing World"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Haken|first1=Jeremy|title=Transnational Crime in the Developing World|url=http://www.gfintegrity.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/gfi_transnational_crime_high-res.pdf|website=Global Financial Integrity|publisher=Global Financial Integrity|accessdate=2014-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="World Wildlife Fund"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dalberg Global Development Advisors|last2=World Wildlife Fund|title=Fighting Illicit Wildlife Trafficking: A consultation with governments|url=http://www.dalberg.com/documents/WWF_Wildlife_Trafficking.pdf|website=World Wildlife Fund|publisher=World Wildlife Fund|accessdate=August 30, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923212439/http://www.dalberg.com/documents/WWF_Wildlife_Trafficking.pdf|archive-date=2015-09-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Products demanded by the trade include [[exotic pet]]s, food, [[traditional medicine]], clothing, and jewelry made from animals' tusks, fins, skins, shells, horns, and internal organs. Smuggled wildlife is an increasing global demand; it is estimated that the [[US]], [[China]], and the [[European Union]] are the places with the highest demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Uhm|first=Daan P. van|title=Illegal Wildlife Trade to the EU and Harms to the World|date=2016-06-01|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305441741_Illegal_Wildlife_Trade_to_the_EU_and_Harms_to_the_World|pages=43–66|isbn=9781472469625|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
At the core of the illegal wildlife trafficking is a strong and rapidly expanding demand for a variety of products around the world: [[bushmeat]]; ingredients for [[traditional Chinese medicine]]; [[exotic pets]]; jewelry, trinkets, and accessories such as chess sets; furs for uses ranging from coats to traditional costumes; and trophies. With the exception of bushmeat, which is used as a primary source of protein by some cultures, all of these uses of illegally obtained wildlife are trophies, driven by a desire to be seen as more affluent, adventurous, or successful than others.

In many parts of Africa, the main demand for illegal wildlife comes from the consumption of [[bushmeat]]. Wild animals are a preferred as a source of protein and [[primates]] are considered a delicacy. It is believed that up to 40,000 monkeys are killed and eventually consumed each year in Africa alone via smuggling. Many primates are killed by bushmeat hunters, who supply to markets all over Africa, Europe, and the United States.

Much of demand for rhinoceros horns, tiger bones, and other animal products arises out of the practice of traditional Chinese medicine, which uses these ingredients to treat fevers, gout, and other illnesses;&lt;ref name="Rhino Horn and Poaching"&gt;{{cite web|title=Poaching for Rhino Horn|url=http://www.savetherhino.org/rhino_info/threats_to_rhino/poaching_for_traditional_chinese_medicine|website=Save the Rhino|publisher=Save the Rhino International|accessdate=September 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   maintain good health and longevity; and enhance sexual potency. Traditional Chinese medicines are taken by hundreds of millions of people. For example, some practitioners drink an expensive liquid made from tiger bones to improve their circulation, treat arthritis, and strengthen the body, in general.&lt;ref name="thedailybeast.com"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hong|first1=Brendon|title=China Is Brewing Wine From Tiger Bones|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/07/22/china-is-brewing-wine-from-tiger-bones.html|accessdate=September 4, 2014|agency=The Daily Beast|publisher=IAC|date=July 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The sale of tiger bones and products made from them is an example of the confusion that can exist on the topic. The sale of bones was outlawed in China in 1993; however, a pilot program, established in 2005, allows the use of bones for captive-bred tigers.&lt;ref name="thedailybeast.com"/&gt;  This can create a confusion in the minds of buyers as to whether the bones were legally obtained. Regardless, tiger wine cannot be sold legally in China, although advertisements for it ran on state television channel in 2011 and journalist attended an auction where tiger wine was offered for sale.&lt;ref name="Journalist attends auction"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Watts|first1=Jonathan|title='It's really good stuff': undercover at a Chinese tiger bone wine auction|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2011/dec/06/china-tiger-bone-wine-auction|website=The Guardian Environmental Blog|publisher=The  Guardian|accessdate=September 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the traditional Chinese medicines fail to cure anything, although the demand for them continues to expand greatly and to the detriment of wildlife.&lt;ref name="Brookings"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Felab-Brown|first1=Vanda|title=The Disappearing Act: The Illicit Trade in Wildlife in Asia|date=June 2011|publisher=Brookings Institution|pages=43|url=http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2011/6/illegal%20wildlife%20trade%20felbabbrown/06_illegal_wildlife_trade_felbabbrown.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104024836/http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2011/6/illegal%20wildlife%20trade%20felbabbrown/06_illegal_wildlife_trade_felbabbrown.pdf|archivedate=2014-01-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Exotic pets]] are animals desired by consumers and are rare  or simply not easily available in the owner's region. Television shows and movies can make certain animals popular.  While many of these animals can be obtained from legal sources, many animals are captured from their native environments, smuggled across national borders,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hajek|first1=Daniel|title=Lucrative Illegal Animal Trade Thrives In Southern California|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/04/05/299385928/lucrative-illegal-animal-trade-thrives-in-southern-california|website=NPR|publisher=National Public Radio|accessdate=2014-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wind up in family homes, menageries, or roadside circuses.&lt;ref name="Brookings"/&gt; Reptiles, such as bearded dragons and geckos, and birds, such as scarlet macaws and certain falcons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=South|first1=Nigel|last2=Brisman|first2=Avi|title=Routledge international handbook of green criminology|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon, Oxon|isbn=9780415678827|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XTiYAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA310&amp;lpg=PA310&amp;dq=TANYA+WYATT+ILLEGAL+FALCON#v=onepage&amp;q=TANYA%20WYATT%20ILLEGAL%20FALCON&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; make up the largest share of animals captured and sold.

"Birds are the most common contraband; the State Department estimates that two million to five million wild birds, from hummingbirds to parrots to harpy eagles, are traded illegally worldwide every year."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/wildlife-trafficking-149079896/|title=Wildlife Trafficking|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tigers]] are a popular pet. An estimated 5,000 to 7,000 tigers (2013) are kept in the United States. The range of numbers is due, in part, to the lack of required reporting in some areas. For comparison, less than 400 of these big cats are in U.S. zoos accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dangerous Exotic Pets: Big Cats|url=http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/exotic_pets/facts/dangerous-exotic-pets-big-cats.html|website=Humane Society of the United States|publisher=Dangerous Exotic Pets: Big Cats|accessdate=September 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 3,200 live in the wild.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=More Tigers in American Backyards than in the Wild|url=http://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/more-tigers-in-american-backyards-than-in-the-wild|website=World Wildlife Fund|publisher=World Wildlife Fund|accessdate=September 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tropical fish, nonhuman primates, and other animals are also part of the illicit pet trade.&lt;ref name="Brookings"/&gt; The U.S. has very strong natural animal and plan laws.

===Health===
The spread of animal-borne disease affects both human health as well as threatening indigenous wildlife and natural ecosystems. According to the United States [[Government Accountability Office]], nearly 75% of emerging diseases that reach humans come from animals. The link between wildlife trafficking and disease outbreak is questioned, although outbreaks of certain diseases have suspected links to smuggled animals.

====Diseases believe to have originated and spread by wildlife smuggling====
*'''[[SARS|SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome)]]''' is caused by a virus and infects both humans and wildlife. Experts suspect that the SARS virus originated in the China due to contact between a [[civets]] (wildcats common in Chinese trade) and humans.
*'''[[Avian flu|Avian flu (H5N1)]]''' is caused by a highly pathogenic virus. It can infect humans through contact with infected crested hawks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Van Borm|first1=S|last2=Thomas|first2=I|last3=Hanquet|first3=G|last4=Lambrecht|first4=B|last5=Boschmans|first5=M|last6=Dupont|first6=G|last7=Decaestecker|first7=M|last8=Snacken|first8=R|last9=van den Berg|first9=T|title=Highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus in smuggled Thai eagles, Belgium|journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases|date=May 2005|volume=11|issue=5|pages=702–5|pmid=15890123|pmc=3320388|url=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/11/5/pdfs/05-0211.pdf|accessdate=October 3, 2014|doi=10.3201/eid1105.050211}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other wild birds, but can be transmitted by contact with poultry as well.
*'''[[Monkeypox]]''' is an infectious disease found in Africa's wildlife that can spread to humans.

====Diseases linked to animal species that are targets of wildlife smuggling====
*'''[[Herpes B virus]]''' is a virus found among macaque monkeys that can be transmitted by bites or scratches to humans in extremely rare cases. If not treated soon after exposure, severe brain damage or death can follow infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Center for Disease Prevention and Control|title=B Virus (herpes B, monkey B virus, herpesvirus simiae, and herpesvirus B)|url=https://www.cdc.gov/herpesbvirus/|website=Center for Disease Prevention and Control|publisher=Center for Disease Prevention and Control|accessdate=September 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rice|first1=Thomas|title=Mother and Daughter Sentenced to Jail for Smuggling Monkey from Thailand|url=http://www.fws.gov/news/ShowNews.cfm?ID=EF38B798-FE9C-34D7-FA635FBC6DE29EE1|accessdate=September 14, 2014|agency=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service|publisher=Department of the Interior|date=April 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Salmonella]]''' infection can cause diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps. Infections have been linked to contact with turtles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Salmonella|url=https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/general/prevention.html|website=Centers for Disease Prevention and Control|accessdate=October 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; bearded dragons and other reptiles.

===Environmental===
Wildlife smuggling directly affects the biodiversity of different ecosystems. Certain animals are in higher demand by smugglers, leading to a visible decline of these species in their native habitats. Wildlife smuggling may also cause the introduction of invasive and harmful species into an ecosystem, which can endanger indigenous wildlife.

==International control measures==
{{see also|Wildlife Enforcement Monitoring System}}

===Coalition Against Wildlife Trafficking===
The Coalition Against Wildlife Trafficking (CAWT) was established in 2005 by the U.S. [[Department of State|State Department]] as a voluntary [[coalition]] of governments and organizations that aims to end the illegal trade of wildlife and wildlife products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cawt-global.squarespace.com/|title=CAWT - About|website=cawt-global.squarespace.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; CAWT currently includes six governments and thirteen international [[NGO]]s. Their means of action include raising public awareness to curb demand, strengthening international cross-border law enforcement to limit supply, and endeavoring to mobilize political support from upper echelons.

===Association of Southeast Asian Nations Wild Enforcement Network===
The [[Freeland Foundation]] and [[Traffic (conservation programme)|TRAFFIC Southeast Asia]] worked with the [[Thailand|Thai]] government and the [[ASEAN|Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)]], to establish the ASEAN Wildlife Enforcement Network (ASEAN-WEN) in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://environment.asean.org/the-asean-wildlife-enforcement-network-asean-wen/|title=The ASEAN Wildlife Enforcement Network (ASEAN-WEN)|date=2012-11-21|work=ASEAN Cooperation on Environment|access-date=2018-10-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; ASEAN-WEN oversees cross-border cooperation and aims to strengthen the collective law enforcement capacity of the ten ASEAN member countries. It is the largest regional wildlife law enforcement collaboration in the world and receives support from the [[United States Agency for International Development]].

===South Asian Enforcement Network===
The South Asian Enforcement Network (SAWEN) was created with the help of CAWT and TRAFFIC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sawen.org/|title=WelcomeSouth Asia Wildlife Enforcement Network|website=South Asia Wildlife Enforcement Network|language=en|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, South Asian environment ministers agreed to create SAWEN under the support of the [[South Asia Co-operative Environment Programme]]. The SAWEN countries include [[Afghanistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Bhutan]], [[India]], [[Maldives]], [[Nepal]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Sri Lanka]].

====Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species====
The [[CITES|Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES)]] directs its efforts at the supply side of wildlife smuggling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cites.org/eng/disc/what.php|title=What is CITES? {{!}} CITES|website=www.cites.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to end wildlife smuggling and to ensure that international trade does not threaten endangered species.

==By country==

===Australia===
International trade of [[Australia]]'s wildlife is regulated under Part 13A of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/epbc|title=Department of the Environment and Energy|website=Department of the Environment and Energy|language=en|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same act implements provisions of CITES and the UN Biodiversity Convention in relation to imports of threatened biodiversity and wildlife.

===Ecuador===
Latin America is vulnerable to wildlife smuggling because of its biodiversity. [[Ecuador]] is known for its biodiversity. In northern Ecuador, the Yasuní National Park and the surrounding Waorani Ethnic Reserve, which cover about 1,770 square miles, are home to around 4,000 species of plants; numerous animals, including the giant river otter; more than 400 fish species; and more than 500 species of birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=USAID|last2=Wildlife Conservation Society|title=The Global Conservation Program Achievements and Lessons Learned from 10 Years of Support for Threats-based Conservation at a Landscape and Seascape Scale: Greater Yasuní-Napo Moist Forest Landscape Conservati on Area (Ecuador)|url=http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACP728.pdf |website=USAID|publisher=USAID and Wildlife Conservation Society|accessdate=August 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a comparison, the United States is home to 900 species of birds. Commonly smuggled birds include the [[scarlet macaw]]; this colorful bird, with bright red, brilliant blue, yellow, and white feathers, is in high demand as a pet.&lt;ref name="Wildlife Trafficking"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bergman|first1=Charles|title=Wildlife Trafficking|journal=Smithsonian|date=December 2009|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/people-places/wildlife-trafficking-149079896/?=&amp;no-ist=&amp;page=1|accessdate=August 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scarlet Macaw"&gt;{{cite web|title=Scarlet Macaw (Ara macao)|url=http://www.rainforest-alliance.org/kids/species-profiles/macaw|website=Rainforest Alliance|accessdate=August 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animals stolen in Latin America often end up in Europe, the United States, or [[Japan]]. Though there are laws against wildlife smuggling, the lack of resources causes conservation to be low in priority.
