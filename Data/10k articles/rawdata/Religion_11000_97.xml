The term {{nihongo|'''A-un'''|阿吽}} is the transliteration in Japanese of the two syllables "a" and "hūṃ", written in [[Devanagari]] as {{script|Deva|अहूँ}}. 

The original Sanskrit term is composed of two letters, the first and the last ([[Anusvara]]) of the [[Sanskrit alphabet]]. Together, they symbolically represent the beginning and the end of all things.&lt;ref name="jaanus a-un"&gt;Japanese Architecture and Art Net Users System (JAANUS), [http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/a/aun.htm "A un" (阿吽)], 2001, retrieved 2011-04-14.&lt;/ref&gt; In Japanese ''[[Mikkyō]]'' Buddhism, the letters represent the beginning and the end of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daijirin]] Japanese dictionary, 2008, Monokakido Co., Ltd. &lt;/ref&gt;  This appears in Greek as Alpha-Omega, similarly adopted by Christianity to symbolize Christ as the beginning and end of all. 

The term is also used in [[Shinto]] and [[Buddhism in Japan|Buddhist]] architecture to describe the paired statues common in Japanese religious settings, most notably the [[Niō]] and the ''[[komainu]]''.&lt;ref name="jaanus a-un"/&gt; In most cases one of the two, the right one, has its mouth open to pronounce the sound "a", while the other has it closed to utter the sound "um". The symbolism is the same already seen. The generic name for statues with an open mouth is {{nihongo|''agyō''|阿形|lit. "a" shape}}, that for those with a closed mouth {{nihongo|''ungyō''|吽形|lit. "un" shape"}}.&lt;ref name="jaanus a-un"/&gt; 

The term ''a-un'' is used figuratively in some Japanese expressions as {{nihongo|"a-un breathing"|阿吽の呼吸|a-un no kokyū}} or {{nihongo|"a-un relationship"|阿吽の仲|a-un no naka}}, indicating an inherently harmonious relationship or non-verbal communication. 

In India, the original Sanscrit "a-huṁ" or simply "Om" is used as a mantra for meditation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5550">[[File:Latium et Campania.png|thumb|300px|A map of Latium, claimed homeland of the Aborigines.]]
The '''Aborigines''' in [[Roman mythology]] are the oldest inhabitants of central [[Italy]], connected in legendary history with [[Aeneas]], [[Latinus]] and [[Evander of Pallene|Evander]]. They were supposed to have descended from their mountain home near [[Reate]] (an ancient [[Sabine]] town) upon [[Latium]], where they expelled the [[Siceli]] and subsequently settled down as [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latini]] under a King [[Latinus]].&lt;ref name="Leonhard Schmitz"&gt;Dr. Leonhard Schmitz ''A History of Rome, From the Earliest Times to the Death of Commodus, A.D. 192.'' p.8-9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DoHI.9"&gt;[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]]. ''Roman Antiquities'', I.9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The most generally accepted etymology of the [[Latin]] word aborigines is that it derives from ''ab origine'', according to which they were the [[Indigenous peoples|original inhabitants]] of the country, although Cato regarded them as [[Greece|Hellenic]] immigrants, not as a native Italian people.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Porcius Cato. ''[[Origines]]'', 5.6.7.&lt;/ref&gt; Other etymological explanations suggested are ''arborigines'', meaning "[[Arbor (garden)|tree]]-born," and ''aberrigines'', meaning "[[nomad]]s". [[Lycophron]] calls a people of central Italy, ''Boreigonoi''.&lt;ref&gt;Lycophron. ''Alexandra'', 1253.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Aborigines were believed to have been descendants of the [[Pelasgians]], the mythical ancestors of all Greek peoples.&lt;ref name="Leonhard Schmitz"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barthold Georg Niebuhr ''Niebuhr's History of Rome, vol I'' note 47&lt;/ref&gt; Their earliest known home was [[Reate]], an ancient [[Sabine]] town to the north-east of [[Latium]] near [[Carseoli]].&lt;ref name="DoHI.9"/&gt; These Aborigines were driven from their mountain home by the Sabines and settled on the river [[Anio]].&lt;ref name="Leonhard Schmitz"/&gt; The [[Sicels]], who inhabited Latium at the time, gave way to the Aborigines, and a portion of them emigrated to Sicily, providing the origin for the island's name.&lt;ref name="Leonhard Schmitz"/&gt; The emigration of the Sicels to Sicily is said to have taken place in either 1264 BC&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius of Halicarnassus ''Roman Antiquities'' I. 22&lt;/ref&gt; or 1035 BC ([[Thucydides]]).&lt;ref name="Leonhard Schmitz"/&gt;

The remaining Siculians joined with the Aborigines eventually becoming the people known as ''Prisci Latini'' (meaning ''old Latins''), that is ''Prisci et Latini'', or simply ''[[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latini]]''.&lt;ref name="Leonhard Schmitz"/&gt; The Aborigines did not become ''Latini'' until the reign of their king, Latinus, from whom the Romans attributed their name. This was after the arrival of the [[Troy|Trojans]] with [[Aeneas]] in the aftermath of the [[Trojan War]].&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius of Halicarnassus ''Roman Antiquities'' I.9, 60&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cities==
The following list is based on [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]].&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius of Halicarnassus ''Roman Antiquities'' I.14, I.15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="William Smith"&gt;William Smith [https://books.google.com/books?id=_sYPAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography'' (1854)]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Palatium''': 25 ''[[stadion (unit)|stades]]'' from Reate.
* '''Tribula''': 60 stades from Reate.
* '''Suesbula''': 60 stades from Tribula, near the Ceraunian Mountains.
* '''Suna''': 40 stades from Suesbula, with an ancient temple of [[Mars (god)|Mars]].
* '''Mefula''': about 30 stades from Suna (ruins with walls in Roman times).
* '''Orvinium''': 40 stades from Mefula. Apparently was once a large and famous city in its area with an ancient temple of [[Minerva]].
* '''Corsula''': about 80 stades from Reate, following the Curian Way, a road thought to go through Raete.
* '''Issa''': an island surrounded by a lake, where the Aborigines relied on the marshy waters of the lake for defence.
* '''Maruvium''': Situated near Issa, on an arm of the same lake and distant forty ''stades'' from something called the ''Septem Aquae''.
* '''Batia''': 30 stades from Raete
* '''Tiora''' (or '''Matiene'''): at a distance of 300 stades from Raete.
* '''Lista''': 24 stades from Tiora, claimed to be the mother-city of the Aborigines, which the Sabines had captured by a surprise attack.
* '''Cutilia''': 70 stades from Reate
All of these cities are claimed to have been taken from the [[Umbrians]].&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius of Halicarnassus ''Roman Antiquities'' I.16&lt;/ref&gt; In Latium itself the Aborigines had the cities Antemnae, Caenina, Ficulnea, Tellenae, and Tibur some of which Dionysius attests were taken from the Siculians.&lt;ref name="William Smith"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius of Halicarnassus ''Roman Antiquities'' I.44, II.35&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Argument from love''' is an [[argument]] for the [[existence of God]]. The best-known defender of the argument is [[Roger Scruton]].

==Arguments from love to the existence of God==
{{also|omnibenevolence|Trinity#Trinity and love}}
[[Tom Wright (theologian)|Tom Wright]] suggests that materialist philosophy and scepticism has "paved our world with concrete, making people ashamed to admit that they have had profound and powerful 'religious' experiences".&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Wright (theologian)|Tom Wright]] ''Simply Christian'' p 16&lt;/ref&gt; The reality of Love in particular ("that mutual and fruitful knowing, trusting and loving which was the creator's intention" but which "we often find so difficult") and the whole area of human relationships in general, are another signpost pointing away from this philosophy to the central elements of the Christian story.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Wright ''Simply Christian'' pp 25–33&lt;/ref&gt; Wright contends ''both'' that the real existence of love is a compelling reason for the truth of theism ''and'' that the ambivalent experience of love, ("marriages apparently made in heaven sometimes end not far from hell") resonates particularly with the Christian account of fall and redemption.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Wright ''Simply Christian'' p 33&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Tillich]] suggested (in 1954) even [[Spinoza]] "elevates love out of the emotional into the [[ontological]] realm. And it is well known that from [[Empedocles]] and [[Plato]] to [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] and [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola|Pico]], to [[Hegel]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], to [[Existentialism]] and depth psychology, love has played a central ontological role."&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Tillich]] ''Love, Power and Justice'' Oxford University Press 1954 p4&lt;/ref&gt; and that "love is being in actuality and love is the moving power of life"&lt;ref&gt;Paul Tillich, ''Love, Power and Justice'', Oxford University Press, 1954, p25&lt;/ref&gt; and that an understanding of this should lead us to "turn from the naive nominalism in which the modern world lives".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Tillich, ''Love, Power and Justice'', Oxford University Press, 1954, p19&lt;/ref&gt;

The theologian Michael Lloyd suggests that "In the end there are basically only two possible sets of views about the universe in which we live. It must, at heart, be either personal or impersonal... arbitrary and temporary&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd cites [[Quentin Smith]]&lt;/ref&gt; [or emerging] from relationship, creativity, delight, love".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Lloyd ''Cafe Theology'' (2005) {{ISBN|1-904074-76-6}} p 14&lt;/ref&gt;

Catholic philosopher [[Peter Kreeft]] summarises the argument as "Love is the greatest of miracles. How could an evolved ape create the noble idea of self-giving love? Human love is a result of our being made to resemble God, who himself is love. If we are made in the image of King Kong rather than in the image of King God, where do the saints come from?"&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Kreeft]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8zm6Fa8UGhYC&amp;pg=PA105 Your Questions, God's Answers]'', Ignatius Press, 1994, {{ISBN|0-89870-488-X}}, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Alvin Plantinga]] expressed the argument in similar terms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alvin Plantinga]] (1986), “Two Dozen [or so] Theistic Arguments,” paper delivered at the 33rd Annual Philosophy Conference, Wheaton College, 23-25 Oct. and republished as an appendix to: Deane-Peter Baker (2007), ''Alvin Plantinga'', Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-85531-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Graham Ward (theologian)|Graham Ward]], postmodern theology portrays how religious questions are opened up (not closed down or annihilated) by postmodern thought. The postmodern God is emphatically the God of love, and the economy of love is [[Kenosis|kenotic]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Modern Theologians'' 3rd ed p 335&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants==

===Comparative rationality of belief in God and Love===
A variant on the argument is a defence of the rationality of theism by comparing faith in God with love, and to suggest that if it isn't irrational to love someone then it shouldn't be seen as irrational to believe in God.&lt;ref&gt;This type of argument was made by [[Alvin Plantinga]] in [[God and Other Minds]]&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Roger Scruton]] suggests: "Rational argument can get us just so far...It can help us to understand the real difference between a faith that commands us to forgive our enemies, and one that commands us to slaughter them. But the leap of faith itself — this placing of your life at God's service — is a leap over reason's edge. This does not make it irrational, any more than falling in love is irrational."&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Scruton]]. [http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/science/sc0078.html Dawkins is wrong about God] reproduced from [[The Spectator]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suggested compelling nature of God's Love===
Another variant of the argument is that the evidence for God's love is sufficiently compelling that people can reasonably believe in it, and hence ''a fortiori'' believe in God.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Michael Welker in ''The Work of Love'' p131 "in this love ''God's identity and power are made known''" (italics in original). He cites e.g. John 17:26&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is criticised by [[Richard Dawkins]] who suggests that it is an "Argument from [[emotional blackmail]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[The God Delusion]] p83&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
If we are going to consider love as an argument for God's existence, then it seems we can say hate is an argument for God's non-existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://jonathandavidgarner.wordpress.com/2016/03/06/argument-from-hate-problem-of-hate/|title=Atheism and the argument from hate|author=|date=6 March 2016|website=wordpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2891">'''Arsaces I of Armenia''', also known as '''Arsaces I''', '''Arshak I''' and '''Arsak''' ({{lang-hy| Արշակ}}, flourished 1st century) (assassinated in 35 AD&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/pages/chronology-1 35 Arsaces is assassinated.] ''iranicaonline.org''&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[Parthian Empire|Parthian Prince]] of [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] and [[Greeks|Greek ancestry]] who served as a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] Client King of [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenia]] in 35. 

Arsaces I was the first-born son of the Parthian King [[Artabanus III (of Parthia)|Artabanus III]] by an unnamed wife.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, Annals, 6.31&lt;/ref&gt; He was born and raised in the Parthian Empire. Arsaces I was named in honor of his Parthian and [[Arsaces of Pontus|Pontian]] relations who ruled with this name as King.

After the death of Roman Client King of Armenia [[Artaxias III]] in 35, Artabanus III wanted to put his son on the Armenian throne. Artabanus III made Arsaces I King of Armenia and was accompanied to Armenia with a strong army.&lt;ref&gt;Dedeyan, ''History of the Armenian people'', p.138&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Roman emperor]] [[Tiberius]], refused to accept the Armenian Kingship of Arsaces I, so Tiberius appointed the Iberian Prince [[Mithridates of Armenia|Mithridates]] as the new Roman Client Armenian King with the support of his brother, King [[Pharasmanes I of Iberia]].&lt;ref&gt;Grousset, ''History of Armenia from its origins to 1071'', p.105&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Arsaces I was a pro-Roman monarch, his Kingship was brief in Armenia. Within less than a year into his first year of his reign, Arsaces I was poisoned from his bribed servants.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, Annals, 6.33&lt;/ref&gt; After Arsaces I died, Artabanus III put another son [[Orodes of Armenia|Orodes]], on the Armenian throne. Orodes succeeded his brother in the Kingship of Armenia and faced Mithridates in a military campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Chaumont, ''Armenia between Rome and Iran I: the advent of Augustus to the accession of Diocletian'', p.88&lt;/ref&gt;

He and some of his disciples were arrested and Bademus was [[martyr]]ed in the year 376; he was subsequently recognized as a saint.&lt;ref name="lives"&gt;{{cite web | last =Butler | first =Alban | authorlink =Alban Butler | title =April 10.—ST.

==Martyrology==
In the thirty-sixth year of [[Shapur II]]'s [[persecution]], Bademus was arrested with seven of his [[monk]]s. For months, he lay in chains in a dungeon. At the same time, a [[Christian]] lord named Nersan, [[Aria (satrapy)|Prince of Aria]], was also imprisoned because he refused to convert to [[Zoroastrianism]]. At first, he appeared resolved to keep the faith, but at the sight of tortures he gave in, and promised to conform. In order to test Nersan's sincerity, King Shapur ordered that Bademus be moved into Nersan's cell, which was actually a chamber in the royal palace. Shapur further instructed Nersan that if he would kill Bademus, his princely rights and dignities would be restored.&lt;ref name="lives"/&gt;

Nersan accepted the conditions. A [[sword]] was placed in his hand, and he advanced so as to plunge it into the abbot's chest. However, he was seized with a sudden terror, so he stopped short, and was unable to lift up his arm to strike for some time. Even so, he attempted to harden himself, and continued, trembling, to aim at Bademus' sides. A combination of fear, shame, remorse, and respect made his strokes weak and unsteady. The martyr's wounds were so numerous that the bystanders are said to have been in admiration of his invincible [[patience]].&lt;ref name="lives"/&gt;

The resolute martyr chided his torturer, saying, "Unhappy Nersan, to what a pitch of [[impiety]] do you carry your [[apostasy]]. With joy I run to meet [[death]]; but could wish to fall by some other hand than yours: why must you be my [[executioner]]?"&lt;ref name="patrick"/&gt;

It took four strokes for Nersan to successfully separate Bademus' head from his body. A short time after, Nersan committed [[suicide]]. The body of Saint Bademus was cast out of the city by the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanids]], but was carried away and buried in secret by the Christians. His disciples were released from their chains in 379, after the death of King Shapur.&lt;ref name="lives"/&gt;

'''Boeun''', (報恩, Offering Gratitude and Repaying), is one of the main teachings of [[Jeungism]]. Bo (報) means "repay" and eun (恩) means "gratitude". Its literal meaning is repay other's gratitude to me.

==Why Boeun is important?==
It is recommended to understand the concept of [[Cosmic year (Chinese astrology)|Cosmic year]] in order to understand better the context of these type of teachings.

As a human being, the most important thing is its life. Without its life, nothing can be more important. Anything that we can think of in our daily life such as money, fame, power, etc. can not be more important because once my life is gone, everything is useless. How one can be rich, famous, and influential without having himself/herself?

Therefore, life is the most important thing for human being. Then, who gave its life? That must be parents. Without parents, one can not be born. For this reason, human being must offer respect to parents and ancestors. This concept is related with [[Wunshibanbon]](Returning to the Origin).

==Aspects==
One aspect of offering gratitude and repaying is to offer respect to parents, ancestors, and teachers to whom we are all indebted. Another is to avoid unnecessary indebtedness and dependence so that we can act freely. It also involves giving credit where credit is due.

Quote from [[Dojeon]]
:It is difficult to serve heaven and earth if you do not respect your parents. Heaven and earth are the parents of humanity, and parents are the heaven and earth of their children. If descendants treat their ancestors badly, ancestors treat the descendants in the same way.
:Dojeon 2:41:3-5

:If you are given a bowl of rice, do not forget it. If you are given only half a bowl of rice, do not forget it. There is a saying, ‘Never fail to repay the benevolence of being given a meal.’ But I say, ‘never fail to repay the benevolence of even half a meal.
:Dojeon 2:40:3-4

:In the Early Heaven, being dependent on others has led people to ruin. You should not even lean on the walls of your own room. Do not wish for the benevolence of others. If you receive many favors, you will be indebted and kept from acting freely. The beast called failure is one-legged. Two of them must lean on each other to walk. When you depend on someone, you are bound to fail.
:Dojeon 8:16:5-7

:Enlightenment is the ultimate way of repaying heaven and earth.
:Dojeon 6:82:5

:You have to discover your own mind and do your own work.
:Dojeon 11:96:8

[[File:Boophone disticha02.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;''Boophone disticha'' flowerhead with caterpillars of the [[Noctuid]] moth ''Diaphone eumela'']]
'''''Boophone''''' is a small [[genus]] of [[herbaceous]], [[perennial]] and [[bulb|bulbous plants]] in the Amaryllis family ([[Amaryllidaceae]], subfamily [[Amaryllidoideae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last=Stevens | first=P.F. | title=Angiosperm Phylogeny Website: Asparagales: Amaryllidoideae | url=http://www.mobot.org/mobot/research/apweb/orders/asparagalesweb.htm#AllAma | postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;) It consists of two confirmed [[species]] distributed across South Africa to Kenya and Uganda. It is closely related to ''[[Crossyne]]'', a genus whose species have prostrate [[leaves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Vigneron|first= P.|title=Boophone |url= http://www.amaryllidaceae.org/Boophone/index.htm|publisher=Amaryllidaceae organization|year=2000–2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are drought tolerant but not cold-hardy, and are very poisonous to livestock.

== Taxonomy ==

=== Etymology ===
[[William Herbert (botanist)|William Herbert]] wrote the name of this genus with three different orthographies: "Boophane" in 1821; "Buphane" and "Buphone" in 1825, and he conserved "Boophone" in 1837. Several authors since then speculated about the etymology and associated orthography of each name, but a proposal was published in 2001 to conserve the first name and to take the later ones as synonyms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = R. H. Archer | author2 = R. K. Brummitt | author3 = D. A.

Brummitt. 2002. Report of the Committee for Spermatophyta: 53. Taxon, Vol. 51, No. 4 (Nov., 2002), pp. 795–799.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Associated insects ==
Larvae of the moth genera ''[[Brithys]]'' and ''[[Diaphone (moth)|Diaphone]]'' use ''Boophone'' as a food plant.

==Traditional medicine ==

''Boophone disticha'' is used in South African [[traditional medicine]] by the Zulus to induce hallucinations for divinatory purposes, and also for various mental illnesses.&lt;ref name="pmid18775771"&gt;{{cite journal

'''[[Carnival]] in [[French Guiana]]''' is a major event.

==Background==
This celebration is a cultural tradition of the [[Guianan Creole]], its origin traced to carnival customs practiced in Europe. It debuted during the beginning of colonization when settlers took part in carnival, forbidding the slaves from participating. Defying the ban, the slaves practiced carnival in clandestine ways, seeing it as a way to regain some freedom, to commemorate African fertility, and to deride the settlers. In the present day, metropolitan, Brazilian and Chinese communities take part in the event.&lt;ref name=Hidair2011&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hidair|first1=Isabelle|title=Le carnaval cayennais ou l'entretien symbolique de frontières "ethniques"|url=http://www.manioc.org/fichiers/V12099|publisher=CRILLASH : Centre de Recherches Interdisciplinaires en Lettres, Langues, Arts et Sciences Humaines|accessdate=16 May 2015|language=French|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its occurrence varies, prescribed by the religious calendar and taking place between the Epiphany in early January, and Ash Wednesday, which marks the beginning of [[Lent]].

There are several traditional costumes in the French Guiana carnival, representing various figures. King Vaval is a mythical figure who serves as carnival king. He is introduced at the beginning of the festival and dies on Ash Wednesday, to be reborn like the Phoenix in the following year. The most famous character is the [[Touloulou]], an elegantly dressed lady who wears a petticoat, hood, [[Domino mask]], and long gloves, so that none of her skin is visible. The aim of the woman who masquerades as a ''touloulou'' is to not be recognized. She strolls down the street and participates in the masked balls. The character represents the bourgeois women of 18th and 19th centuries. Neg'Marrons are groups of men dressed in ''kalimbé'' (red [[loincloth]]) and coated with [[molasses]].&lt;ref name=kreolmagazine.com /&gt; Representing fugitive slaves, they seek to make order of the festival. Other traditional characters include the ''Zombi baréyo'', a [[zombie]] character; ''Jwé farin'', who is dressed in white trousers, shirt, pointed hat, and mask, representing a baker; ''Bobi'', is dressed in old potato sacks and appears as a bear led by a leash; ''Karolin'', representing a rich woman with gold who is jealous and protects other women; ''Lanmò'', who represents death, is dressed in white; '' Soussouris'', who represents the bat, is a winged character who commonly wears black or two tones, and is renowned for its vampire behavior; and ''Diab rouj'' (red devil), who dresses in red and black.&lt;ref name=imagesplus.fr /&gt; The ''tululu'' (mask) is worn in French Guiana while celebrating carnival.{{sfn|Fauquenoy|1972|p=50}}

Fridays commonly include eating a cake, known as the ''[[galette des rois]]'' (cake of kings, which in mainland France would be eaten only for the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]]),&lt;ref name=kreolmagazine.com /&gt; representing the [[Three Kings]].{{sfn|Albala|2011|p=144}} [[Blaff]] is also commonly consumed during this period.{{sfn|Albala|2011|p=144}}

==Events== 
On the Saturday preceding Lent, carnival Queens (locally, ''Touloulous'') dress in colourful, camouflaged dresses and wear masks while they dance through the streets. Their costumes – lace and petticoats, tights and gloves – cover them from head to toe. They speak in disguised voices to retain anonymity.{{Sfn|Shafto|2009|p=57}} The women invite the men to join them, which is a mandatory requirement.{{Sfn|Gray|1999|p=279}} On Friday and Saturday nights, the Toulouois assemble in large dance halls. Men who are invited have to pay an entry fee.{{Sfn|Shafto|2009|p=57}} Sunday is the day of parades.{{Sfn|Gray|1999|p=279}} ''Vides'' (street parades), require months of preparation.{{sfn|Horn|Laing|2005|p=320}} They occur on the streets of [[Cayenne]], [[Kourou]], and [[Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni]]. Groups dress according to the theme of the year. The parade includes decorated floats and there are musicians playing drums and brass. Thousands of spectators line the sidewalks and sit in the stands which are set up for the occasion. Brazilian groups have similar costumes to those encountered at [[Rio Carnival]], while the country's Asian community incorporates dragons in the festivities. On Monday, a sham act of marriage with women (brides) in men's gowns and men (grooms) in women's dresses is the main spectacle.{{Sfn|Gray|1999|p=279}} Tuesday, the last day of the festival, is marked by the appearance of the main spirit of King Vaval, who is considered by the locals to be "the devil and soul of carnival". He arrives on a canoe in the form of an effigy, made of straw. A very large number of people gather on the beach to welcome him.{{Sfn|Shafto|2009|p=57}}{{Sfn|Gray|1999|p=279}} On this occasion the dancers are dressed in black or red coloured costumes adorned with horns and tails and holding pitchforks. The effigy is then burnt in the night and on the following day, Ash Wednesday, people wear black and white dresses to mourn the passing of Vival.{{Sfn|Gray|1999|p=279}}

'''''Chaar Sahibzaade''''' is a 2014 Indian [[Punjabi cinema|Punjabi]] [[List of 3D films|3D]] [[Computer animation|computer-animated]] [[Historical period drama|historical]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] written and directed by [[Harry Baweja]]. It is based on the sacrifices of the sons of the 10th [[Sikh gurus|Sikh guru]] [[Guru Gobind Singh]]—[[Sahibzada Ajit Singh]], [[Sahibzada Jujhar Singh|Jujhar Singh]], [[Sahibzada Zorawar Singh|Jorawar Singh]], and [[Sahibzada Fateh Singh|Fateh Singh]].&lt;ref name="ttt" /&gt; [[Om Puri]] provided the film's narration, and the voice artists for various characters were kept anonymous. It was also the [[List of highest-grossing Punjabi films|highest grossing Punjabi film]] when it was released. It was surpassed by Carry on Jatta 2 in July 2018.

Produced by [[Pammi Baweja]] under the banner Baweja Movies, the film was released on 6 November 2014 to positive reviews from critics and audiences, and the movie emerged as a major box office success, eventually becoming the highest grossing animated movie ever to have been produced in India.&lt;ref name=numbers/&gt;

== Synopsis ==

The film starts with invasions of India by Mughal and Turkish kings. [[Guru Tegh Bahadur]] (9th Guru of Sikhs) sacrificed his life for the human rights and freedom of religion of Kashmiri pandits. Then, [[Guru Gobind Singh]] founded the [[Khalsa]] to counter the invading forces with martyrdom as the fundamental principle.The film depicts the [[Battle of Anandpur (1700)]] in which Mughal General Painde khan was killed by Guru Gobind Singh. The film also depicts the Battle of Chamkaur which took place in December, 1704 CE in which 42 Sikhs (under Guru Gobind singh) fought bravely against 10 [[lakh]] mughal forces (under wazir Khan). In the battle of chamkaur,both the elder sons of Guru Gobind Singh [[Sahibzada Ajit Singh]] 18 years old and [[Sahibzada Jujhar Singh]] 14 years old were martyred.The mughals were in large number but still they failed to capture Guru Gobind Singh and hence Sikhs defeated Mughals. The Younger sons of Guru Gobind Singh [[Sahibzada Zorawar Singh]] who was 9 years old and  [[Sahibzada Fateh Singh]] who was 7 years old were taken to [[Wazir Khan (Sirhind)|Wazir Khan]]'s palace and were cruelly and inhumanely executed by the Mughal ruler of Sirhind. Wazir Khan gave orders that masons were to brick the Gurus two youngest sons into a section of the city's wall.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sikhiwiki.org/index.php/Sahibzada_Fateh_Singh&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Christian Labour Party''' ({{lang-pt|Partido Trabalhista Cristão}}; PTC), formerly named '''National Reconstruction Party''' ({{lang-pt|Partido da Reconstrução Nacional}}; PRN), is a [[Liberal conservatism|liberal-conservative]] [[political party]] in [[Brazil]].

The party was founded in 1985 as '''Youth Party''' (''Partido da Juventude'', PJ) by Daniel Tourinho, a Brazilian lawyer. In 1989 the party was renamed  '''National Reconstruction Party'''. [[Fernando Collor de Mello]] representing this party was elected president in 1990.

After Collor's [[impeachment]] in 1992 the party suffered a deep crisis and eventually changed its name to ''Partido Trabalhista Cristão'' in 2000.

In 2016 Collor de Mello (now a senator) re-joined PTC, which thus regained parliamentary representation.

'''Christian hedonism''' is a [[Christian theology|Christian doctrine]] found in some [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] camp, more specifically those of the [[Reformed theology|Reformed]] tradition especially in the circle of [[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]]. The term was coined by [[Reformed Baptist]] pastor [[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]] in his 1986 book ''Desiring God'' based on [[Vernard Eller]]'s earlier use of the term "hedonism" to describe the same concept.{{sfn|Talbot|2010|p=71-76}} Piper summarizes this philosophy of the Christian life as "God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him."{{sfn|Piper|1995}}

Christian Hedonism may anachronistically describe the theology of [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]]: "God made the world that he might communicate, and the creature receive, his glory; but that it might [be] received both by the mind and heart.  He that testifies His having an idea of God's glory [doesn't] glorify God so much as he that testifies also his approbation of it and his delight in it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Edwards |first=Jonathan |title=The Works of Jonathan Edwards |volume=Vol. 13 |editor-last=Schafer |editor-first=Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt; Piper has said, "The great goal of all Edward's work was the glory of God.  And the greatest thing I have ever learned from Edwards...is that God is glorified most not merely by being known, nor by merely being dutifully obeyed, but by being enjoyed in the knowing and the obeying."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Piper |first=John |title=God's passion for his glory: Living the vision of Jonathan Edwards |location=Wheaton, IL |publisher=Crossway |url=https://document.desiringgod.org/god-s-passion-for-his-glory-en.pdf#page=75 |p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Doctrine==

{{over-quotation|section|date=January 2014}}

The [[Westminster Shorter Catechism]] summarizes the "chief end of man" as "to glorify God and enjoy Him forever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |title=[[s:Westminster Shorter Catechism|Westminster Shorter Catechism]] |date=25 November 1647}}&lt;/ref&gt; Piper has suggested that this would be more correct as "to glorify God ''by'' enjoying Him forever."{{sfn|Piper|1986}} Many Christian hedonists, such as [[Matt Chandler (pastor)|Matt Chandler]], point to figures such as [[Blaise Pascal]] and [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]] as exemplars of Christian hedonism from the past, though their lives predate the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Chandler |first=Matt |title=Persevering in the Pursuit of Joy | website=The Village Church | date=10 November 2013 | url=http://www.tvcresources.net/resource-library/sermons/persevering-in-the-pursuit-of-joy | accessdate=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian hedonism was developed in opposition to the [[deontology]] of [[Immanuel Kant]].{{sfn|Piper|1995}} Kant argued that actions should be considered praiseworthy only if they do not proceed from the actor's desires or expected benefit, but rather from a sense of duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kant |first=Immanuel |author-link=Immanuel Kant |title=[[Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals]] |date=1785 |at=Section 1, 4:397}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Rand|1961|p=32}} On the contrary, Christian hedonists advocate for a [[consequentialism|consequentialist ethic]] based on an understanding that their greatest possible happiness can be found in God.{{sfn|Piper|1995}}{{sfn|Piper|1986}} In this critique of Kant, John Piper was influenced by [[Ayn Rand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |last=Piper |first=John |title=The ethics of Ayn Rand: Appreciation and critique |date=1 June 1979 |publisher=Desiring God Foundation |url=http://www.desiringgod.org/articles/the-ethics-of-ayn-rand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British writer [[C. S. Lewis]], in an oft-quoted passage in his short piece "[[The Weight of Glory and Other Addresses|The Weight of Glory]]," likewise objects to Kantian ethics:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
If there lurks in most modern minds the notion that to desire our own good and to earnestly hope for the enjoyment of it is a bad thing, I suggest that this notion has crept in from Kant and the Stoics and is no part of the Christian faith. Indeed, if we consider the unblushing promises of reward and the staggering nature of the rewards promised in the Gospels, it would seem that our Lord finds our desires, not too strong, but too weak. We are half-hearted creatures, fooling around with drink and sex and ambition when infinite joy is offered us, like an ignorant child who wants to go on making mud pies in a slum because he cannot imagine what is meant by the offer of a holiday at the sea. We are far too easily pleased.{{sfn|Lewis|1941|p=1–2}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Piper later argues:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
But not only is disinterested morality (doing good "for its own sake") impossible; it is undesirable. That is, it is unbiblical; because it would mean that the better a man became the harder it would be for him to act morally. The closer he came to true goodness the more naturally and happily he would do what is good. A good man in Scripture is not the man who dislikes doing good but toughs it out for the sake of duty. A good man loves kindness (Micah 6:8) and delights in the law of the Lord (Psalm 1:2), and the will of the Lord (Psalm 40:8). But how shall such a man do an act of kindness disinterestedly? The better the man, the more joy in obedience.{{sfn|Piper|2013|p=63}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Criticism==
{{see also|Ethical egoism#Criticisms}}
Some Christians object to Christian Hedonism's controversial name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gentry |first=Greg |url=http://parablemania.ektopos.com/archives/2005/09/why_i_am_no_lon.html |title=Why I am no longer a Piperite |website=Parableman |publisher=Parablemania.ektopos.com |date=17 September 2005 |accessdate=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has little commonality with philosophical [[hedonism]]; however, Piper has stated that a provocative term is "appropriate for a philosophy that has a life changing effect on its adherents." Critics charge that hedonism of any sort puts something (namely, ''pleasure'') before God,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thefaithfulword.org/studyhedonism.html |title=A biblical study of the theological foundation of Christian Hedonism |publisher=The Faithful Word.org |date=2002-09-18 |accessdate=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which allegedly breaks the first of the [[Ten Commandments]]: "You shall have no other gods before me." In response, Piper states in ''Desiring God'' that "By Christian Hedonism, we do not mean that our happiness is the highest good. We mean that pursuing the highest good will always result in our greatest happiness in the end. We should pursue this happiness, and pursue it with all our might. The desire to be happy is a proper motive for every good deed, and if you abandon the pursuit of your own joy, you cannot love man or please God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schaumburg |first=Harry |url=http://www.desiringgod.org/articles/we-want-you-to-be-a-christian-hedonist |title=We want you to be a Christian Hedonist! |publisher=Desiring God Foundation |date=31 August 2006 |accessdate=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Circle Sanctuary''' is a [[non-profit organization]] and legally recognized [[neopaganism|Neo-Pagan]] [[Church body|Church]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adherents.com/Na/Na_238.html Adherents.com website] accessed 30 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; based in southwestern [[Wisconsin]], US.  Circle is the publisher of Circle Magazine, which has approximately 15,000 subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Helen A. ''A Community of Witches: Contemporary Neo-Paganism and Witchcraft in the United States'' (1999). Columbia, SC: University of South Carolina Press, p.110.&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to encourage community celebrations, spiritual healing, research, networking and education.

Circle was founded in 1974 by [[Selena Fox]], and sponsors gatherings and encourages nature conservation, nature meditations and workshops at a range of locations, with the primary site being a {{convert|200|acre|km2|sing=on}} site near [[Mount Horeb, Wisconsin]] set in forested hills.&lt;ref&gt;Hopman, Ellen Evert &amp; Bond, Lawrence. ''Circle Sanctuary, People of the Earth: The New Pagans Speak Out''. (1996). Rochester, Vermont: Destiny Books, 236-244. {{ISBN|0-89281-559-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Circle Sanctuary's land is fully owned by Circle Sanctuary Inc., a [[501(c)|501(c)3]] non-profit.

The organization has been prominent in the campaign to permit the [[pentacle]] to be displayed on the gravestones of Wiccan members of U.S. forces, and Selena Fox was one of the plaintiffs in the successful action to obtain this permission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/04/23/america/NA-GEN-US-Wiccan-Soldier.php Wiccans symbols allowed on grave markers in government cemeteries] International Herald Tribune (April 23, 2007) Accessed 30 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Nine of the gravestones are displayed at the Sanctuary's cemetery at [[Barneveld, Wisconsin]], about {{convert|25|mi|km}} west of [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.circlesanctuary.org/index.php/military-ministries/veterans-ridge-at-circle-cemetery Veterans' Ridge at Circle Cemetery] Accessed 16 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Since its creation in 1974, Circle Sanctuary has provided support to Neopagans in several ways, chiefly as a networking resource. For many years, Circle was the only national networking resource available to most Neopagans, especially those who were not located in major cities with large Pagan or Neopagan populations (such as [[New York City]], [[Chicago, Illinois]], and [[San Francisco, California]]). Circle Network News, originally a newspaper-like quarterly and now a quarterly magazine, provided a method for Pagans in less populated areas to find others of like mind.  Networking support remains one of Circle's core functions.

Circle sponsors many gatherings, the best-known of which is the [[Pagan Spirit Gathering]], held annually at [[Litha]] (Midsummer).  Other major festivals on Circle Sanctuary land include [[Beltane]] (near May 1), Green Spirit ([[Lughnasadh]], around August 1) and [[Samhain]] (around October 31).  Additional smaller gatherings, classes and celebrations are held year-round.

Circle has 26 active ministers who perform community support and passage rite work throughout the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.circlesanctuary.org/ministers/ Circle Sanctuary Public Ministers' Roster]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Founded in 1974 by [[Selena Fox]] and Jim Alan, Circle's first public event was a [[Yule]] ritual hosted at the couple's home in [[Madison, Wisconsin]].  The following year, Circle moved to a farm in [[Sun Prairie, Wisconsin]] (just outside Madison).  In 1978, a favorable article written by Jacqueline Mitchard appeared in [[The Capital Times]],&lt;ref name="Mitchard, 1978"&gt;{{cite news |title= Witches put hex on 'evil eye' image |first= Jacqueline |last= Mitchard |location= Madison, WI |newspaper=  Capital Times |page= 39 |department=PM |date= October 31, 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; which marked the beginning of Circle's public outreach.  The same year, Fox and Alan began hosting a Thursday night, weekly half-hour radio program called "Circle Magic" on 89.7 FM [[WORT]]&lt;!--WORT was 89.7 not 89.9 in the 1970s--&gt; in Madison and a television show "Magick Circle"(sic) on cable 4;&lt;ref name="Mitchard, 1978" /&gt; the radio program ran for four years.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

1978 was a pivotal year for Circle.  Incorporated as a [[Wicca]]n Church in Wisconsin on October 27, 1978, the organization's legal name was changed to "Church of Circle Wicca, Inc."&lt;ref name="Legal Name"&gt;[https://www.wdfi.org/apps/CorpSearch/Results.aspx?type=Simple&amp;q=circle+sanctuary Corporation Registration] Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions, retrieved 2010-1-11&lt;/ref&gt; Circle's original coven structure was replaced with a church structure, including a board of directors and ordained ministers. Fox and Alan released a tape entitled ''Circle Magick Music'', one of the first Neopagan music collections to be widely distributed. They also published a paperback collection of music in ''Circle Magic Songs''.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Alan and Selena Fox (1979). ''Circle Magick Songs'' Circle Publications. Out of print, but used copies are occasionally offered for sale on-line.&lt;/ref&gt; A weekly, hour-long cable television show was added on Cable 4 of Madison.  The following year, Circle was featured in ''Time'' magazine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,948768-1,00.html|title=Religion: Preaching Pan, Isis and Om|publisher=Time Magazine|date=August 6, 1979|accessdate=2010-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the Religion page, in an article about a [[History of marriage in Great Britain and Ireland|handfasting]] the couple performed at the third Pan Pagan Festival at Demotte, Indiana.

In 1979 Jim Alan and Selena Fox began working with the Chameleon Club, a [[Cleveland, Ohio]]-based group. They hosted several appearances at [[Case Western Reserve University]] and other Cleveland venues, and on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television talk shows [[The Morning Exchange|Morning Exchange]] and [[Live on Five]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}.  Circle helped launch the first [[Starwood Festival]] in 1981, just one month after the first Pagan Spirit Gathering.

In 1980, Circle received federal recognition as a church, and moved to another rented farm in [[Black Earth, Wisconsin]].  The first Litha gathering was held, a precursor for the Pagan Spirit Gathering that made its debut in 1981.  Fundraising for a land purchase began in 1980, and the land was purchased in 1983.

Its current legal name, "Circle Sanctuary, Inc.," was registered with the State of Wisconsin on September 30, 1983.&lt;ref name="Legal Name" /&gt;

During 1984, Circle Sanctuary assisted in updating the United States Army's ''Requirements and Practices of Certain Selected Groups: A Handbook for Chaplains''.  By that time, Circle Network had existed for several years, bringing Neopagans of many paths together.  Circle was also involved in legal battles during the mid- to late-80's, as the local township government attempted to use zoning laws to prevent Circle from establishing the sanctuary land as church land.  This effort failed, as Circle won key decisions that culminated in the same local government granting Circle the nation's first official recognition as a church of [[Witchcraft]] in 1988.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  Today, Circle enjoys excellent relations with the local town board.

The 1990s were a period of increasing growth for Circle.  Both of its executive directors received advanced degrees by tying their fields of study into their Neopagan experience, with Selena achieving an M.S in Counseling in 1995 from the University of Wisconsin - Madison, and Dennis achieving a Ph.D. in Psychology in 1994&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://richland.uwc.edu/sites/richland.uwc.edu/files/bio/cv/carpenter-vitae-2013.pdf|title=Curriculum Vitae|accessdate=2015-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Saybrook Institute]].  Circle was a sponsor for the [[Parliament of World Religions]] in 1993, bringing Circle wide enough notice to attract the attention of [[fundamentalist Christian]] activists such as [[Pat Robertson]], who described Circle Sanctuary on his television program ''[[The 700 Club]]'' and in his book ''The New World Order'' as "a 1000&amp;nbsp;acre [4 km²] sanctuary for witches", exaggerating the Sanctuary's land area fivefold.

Circle also participated in the Nature Religion Today conference sponsored by [[Lancaster University]], United Kingdom in 1996.  In 1997, the Pagan Spirit Gathering moved to Wisteria Campground in southern Ohio, having been held in southwestern Wisconsin at [[Eagle Cave]] near Blue River, Wisconsin.  In 1998, ''Circle Magazine'' debuted as a quarterly magazine, replacing ''Circle Network News'' which had been published as a newsletter/newspaper since 1978.

== Activities ==
=== Networking ===
Circle Network was founded in 1977 for the purpose of assisting Pagans of all paths to "connect with each other and share information, ideas, and energy". There is no cost to affiliate, and membership is open to any Pagan whose path espouses a reverence for nature and holds an ethical structure consistent with the [[Wiccan Rede]].

=== Gatherings and celebrations ===
Circle Sanctuary sponsors gatherings year-round, but its largest festival is the [[Pagan Spirit Gathering]] (PSG), held annually to coincide with the [[midsummer|Summer Solstice]].  At first, the festivals were held at Eagle Cave in Grant County Wisconsin, but it outgrew the facilities and in 1997 moved to a location near [[Athens, Ohio]] at Wisteria. In 2009, PSG moved to Camp Zoe near [[Salem, Missouri]], and in 2011, PSG moved to Stonehouse Farm in central Illinois.

All other gatherings sponsored by Circle happen on Circle Sanctuary land, with the exception of the Winter Solstice pageant held at a Unitarian Universalist Fellowship in Madison.

=== Legal support ===

Circle Sanctuary founded the [https://www.circlesanctuary.org/liberty/ Lady Liberty League] in 1985. The LLL is the "religious freedom support service" of Circle, providing information and networking for those who are working with religious freedom issues relevant to Wicca and/or [[Nature spirituality]]. In addition, the LLL worked actively to counter negative stereotypes of Neopagans, and has assisted others in furthering Wicca's acceptance. A recent example is the [https://www.circlesanctuary.org/liberty/veteranpentacle/ struggle] to win approval from the United States Military to place pentacles&lt;ref&gt;The symbol was referred to as a [[pentacle]] in the legal case. See also the article on the [[pentagram]] for further discussion of the symbol.&lt;/ref&gt; on the memorial markers for Wiccan soldiers killed in the line of duty.

=== Environmental work ===
Circle Sanctuary is located on a {{convert|200|acre|km2|sing=on}} private nature preserve. Owned by Circle Sanctuary Inc, founded as a preserve in 1983 and zoned as "sacred land" in 1988, the Preserve is dedicated not only to support and maintain local biodiversity, but also to allow people to study interactions on the land from both a scientific and a spiritual basis.

== Access to the sanctuary ==
The land is not open to drop-in visitors, in accordance with its purpose as a nature preserve.  However, the land and its sacred sites are open for:

'''Daara''', is the title used in [[Senegal]] to designate the traditional Koranic schools that have ensured for centuries religious education was well spread out in all segments of population in the West African countries. These Daraa have permitted  to diffused literacy and consequently offer a didactic platform to convey specific ancestral philosophies and customary practices deemed as compatible with the adoption of the Muslim religion. Therefore, while having benefited a royalty of communities as temples of knowledge, these religious schools have subsequently underpinned the intensification of intrusion of foreign cultural practices entrenched in the use of the doctrine  in some localities. These Daara have preceded the implementation of the contemporary very influential religious brotherhoods, as they have grounded with the education they provided a selection of teaching derivative mainly of the Sufism form of Islam.

Nowadays, the denomination conveys a very controversial portrait depend on the understanding one have on their usefulness in social progress. Too often, it has been reported abuse by non-governmental organisations such as XALAAT&lt;ref&gt;http://www.talibe.info&lt;/ref&gt; of the principle of being educational religious school to have been rather perniciously perverted as institutions of financial exploitation and ill-treatment of child beggars called [[Talibe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = xalaat|url = http://www.ngo-xalaat.com|website = xalaat|access-date = 2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is explained by XALAAT&lt;ref&gt;http://www.talibe.info&lt;/ref&gt; by a lack of provision for truly free school as support for schooling stationery or other related expenses, many poor parents chose to give away their children to surrogate Guardian call Serigne &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Les mots du patrimoine: le Sénégal|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_kB1YjS8_ooC|publisher = Archives contemporaines|date = 2006-01-01|isbn = 9782914610339|language = fr|first = Geneviève|last = N'Diaye-Correard}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Marabout]] that should be providing them with alternative social-religious education. Instead these children end up begging for hours in the streets of Senegalese Cities in the benefit of their guardians who find likewise 'production factors' that do not cost pretty much anything to their business.

Set on the fictional Craggy Island, a remote location off Ireland's west coast, the show starred [[Dermot Morgan]] as the eponymous [[Father Ted Crilly]], alongside fellow priests [[Father Dougal McGuire]] ([[Ardal O'Hanlon]]) and [[Father Jack Hackett]] ([[Frank Kelly]]). Exiled on the island for various past incidents, the priests live together in the [[parochial house]] with their housekeeper [[Mrs Doyle]] ([[Pauline McLynn]]). The show was critically acclaimed, receiving several [[BAFTA]] awards, and remains a popular sitcom in Britain and Ireland. In 2004, it was ranked Number 11 in a poll to find [[Britain's Best Sitcom]].

==Synopsis==
{{Further|List of Father Ted characters}}
The show follows the misadventures of three Irish [[Roman Catholic]] priests who live in a parish on the fictional Craggy Island, located off the west coast of [[Ireland]]. [[Father Ted Crilly]], [[Father Dougal McGuire]] and [[Father Jack Hackett]] live chaotically together in Craggy Island's parochial house, along with their housekeeper [[Mrs Doyle]], who always wants to serve them tea.

The three priests answer to Bishop [[List of Father Ted characters#Bishop Brennan|Len Brennan]], who has banished them to Craggy Island as punishment for different incidents in their past: Ted for alleged financial impropriety (apparently involving some money 'resting' in his account and a child being deprived of a visit to [[Lourdes]] so that Ted could go to [[Las Vegas]]), Dougal for something only referred to as the "Blackrock Incident" (resulting in many nuns' "lives [being] irreparably damaged"), and Jack for his [[alcoholism]] and [[Lothario|womanising]], particularly for an incident at a wedding in [[Athlone]].

The show revolves around the priests' lives on Craggy Island, sometimes dealing with matters of the church but more often dealing with Father Ted's schemes to either resolve a situation with the parish or other Craggy Island residents, or to win games of one-upmanship against his enemy, Father Dick Byrne of the nearby Rugged Island parish.

I remember [[Frank Kelly]] and ''[[Hall's Pictorial Weekly]]''. He did a show called ''The Glen Abbey Show'', which was very funny. So I was always aware of the strangeness and madness of Irish things.}}

Linehan and Mathews first met while working at ''[[Hot Press]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Ben |title=Sunshine on Putty: The Golden Age of British Comedy from Vic Reeves to The Office |year=2010 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VH_MuFWd0vMC&amp;pg=PP289&amp;lpg=PP289&amp;dq=graham+linehan+%22hot+press%22+%22first+met%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hDAob9foBi&amp;sig=IedkGK9yhSy0iJgdDZSkAXahSvs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=exPlT8_wH8bW2AWRtqDaCQ&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=graham%20linehan%20%22hot%20press%22%20%22first%20met%22&amp;f=false |page=289 |publisher=Harper Collins |isbn=9780007375530 |type=eBook |accessdate=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1980s, Mathews, [[Paul Woodfull]] and Kieran Woodfull formed The Joshua Trio, a [[U2]] tribute band. The trio began writing comedy sketches to accompany their act. Mathews created the Father Ted character for his short-lived stand-up routine. Before The Joshua Trio played at gigs, Mathews would occasionally come on-stage as Father Ted and tell jokes involving his great friend, Father Dougal McGuire.&lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/incoming/u2-beware-its-the-joshua-trio-musical-26789120.html|title=U2 beware – It's the Joshua Trio musical|date=5 November 2011|accessdate=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Mathews left his job at ''Hot Press'' and moved into Linehan's London home. Over the next three to four years, they worked on rough ideas for shows while at the same time writing for sketch shows such as ''[[The All New Alexei Sayle Show]]'' and ''[[The Fast Show]]''. One of these ideas was for a comedy mockumentary series called ''Irish Lives'', with six episodes, each focusing on a different character living somewhere in Ireland. They scripted an episode centring on a priest named Father Ted Crilly, who visits his friends in the seminary in [[St Patrick's College, Maynooth|Maynooth College]]. Producer [[Geoffrey Perkins]] suggested that the episode's concept be dramatised and rewritten as a sitcom.&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishpost.ie/index.php/component/content/article/13-entertainment-news/138-graham-linehan-father-ted-was-a-specific-kind-of-magic |title=Graham Linehan: 'Father Ted was a specific kind of magic' |last=O'Malley |first=JP |work=irishpost.ie |accessdate=7 October 2012 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/how-we-met-arthur-mathews-and-graham-linehan-1244844.html|title=HOW WE MET: ARTHUR MATHEWS AND GRAHAM LINEHAN|last=Feay|first=Suzi|work=independent.co.uk|date=10 August 1997|accessdate=7 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathews was originally intended to play Ted, but decided he lacked the acting ability the role required. [[Maurice O'Donoghue]], who plays Father Dick in the series, was their second choice for the role of Ted, being the right age and having a similar look and lightness. Mathews always preferred [[Dermot Morgan]]; Linehan was initially reluctant, fearing he would play Ted the same as "Father Trendy", a character he played on the [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] television show ''[[The Live Mike]]'', but Morgan lobbied hard for the role and was cast.

The show was pitched directly to the UK's [[Hat Trick Productions]] and Channel 4 by the duo, contrary to rumours that [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] (the Irish national broadcaster) were originally offered the series but rejected it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Whitaker|first=Ross|title=Issue 134 – Master of Comedy (extract)|url=http://filmireland.net/2010/10/06/issue-134-master-of-comedy/|accessdate=15 February 2012|newspaper=[[Film Ireland]]|date=6 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Arthur|first=

===Recording===
Three series and one Christmas special were aired. Declan Lowney directed the first two series and the Christmas special, while the third series was directed by Linehan (location scenes) and [[Andy De Emmony]] (studio scenes). In addition, Morgan and O'Hanlon hosted an hour of [[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]] in character, during which Kelly and McLynn also made brief guest appearances. One day after the shooting of series three wrapped, Dermot Morgan died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]], aged 45. As a mark of respect, the third series was first broadcast a week later than originally planned.

Just weeks before his death Morgan said that he did not want to continue playing the role of Father Ted for fear of being [[typecasting (acting)|typecast]]: "I don't want to be the next [[Clive Dunn]] and end up playing the same character for years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Father Ted star dies|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/61112.stm|work=BBC News UK|accessdate=29 April 2011|date=1 March 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Morgan's death, the production company received calls from numerous agents and casting directors suggesting either new actors for the role of Ted or spin-offs without the character; Linehan and Mathews declined all offers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tellyspotting.org/2010/05/25/no-more-father-ted-with-or-without-dermot-morgan/|title=No more Father Ted, with or without Dermot Morgan|work=tellyspotting.org|last=Young|first=Bill|date=25 May 2010|accessdate=28 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106010536/http://tellyspotting.org/2010/05/25/no-more-father-ted-with-or-without-dermot-morgan/#|archive-date=6 November 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
In 1994, the writers asked alternative rock band [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]] to compose the theme music for ''Father Ted'', requesting a parody of a typical sitcom theme. When Pulp declined involvement, they contacted [[Neil Hannon]], frontman of Northern Irish [[chamber pop]] band [[The Divine Comedy (band)|The Divine Comedy]]. Hannon's first effort, a jaunty composition, was rejected on Geoffrey Perkins's advice. Hannon composed a second theme, which the team found acceptable. This theme was recorded by Hannon and co-producer [[Darren Allison]] at [[The Jesus and Mary Chain]]'s private studio. One of [[William Reid (musician)|William Reid]]'s guitars was selected by Allison and Hannon to carry the main tune, which was played by Hannon.  Both themes were also reworked, with new lyrics, for inclusion on The Divine Comedy's 1996 album ''[[Casanova (The Divine Comedy album)|Casanova]]'': the final ''Father Ted'' theme became "Songs of Love", while Hannon's rejected theme became "A Woman of the World".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ashortsite.com/songs/?keyword=fatherted |title=Father Ted Theme |work=ashortsite.com |accessdate=10 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106005804/http://www.ashortsite.com/songs/?keyword=fatherted |archivedate=6 November 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;As stated by Neil Hannon in the documentary ''Half Minute Melodies'', [[BBC Radio 4]], 3 February 2000. Hannon offered a choice of tunes to the producers; his personal preference was for "Woman of the World".&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Linehan discussed the dramatic effect this choice had on the tone of the series: "'Woman of the World' was kind of like a jaunty, plinky-plonky song, and we wanted that song. He [Hannon] gave us two choices: he gave us that, and "Songs of Love", and we wanted the plinky-plonky song because our idea was we were making fun of sitcoms. We were saying, you know, we don't like sitcoms. This is a parody of sitcoms. This is a kind of satire on sitcoms. And I remember Geoffrey [Perkins] looking really glum and sad about this, you know? And then he said, 'Why do you want to make fun of your characters?' He said, 'People will love these characters.' And that was just a real revelation for me, and after that, whatever he said went, as far as I was concerned."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZR84X49WZI|title=Graham Lineahn In Conversation With ... IFTA (Part Two)|author=IFTAAwards|work=youtube.com|date=13 September 2010|accessdate=7 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Divine Comedy also contributed most of the show's original music, including the songs "Big Men in Frocks" (for the episode "[[Rock-a-Hula Ted]]"), "[[My Lovely Horse]]" and "The Miracle is Mine" (for "[[A Song for Europe (Father Ted)|A Song for Europe]]"), and "My Lovely Mayo Mammy" (for "[[Night of the Nearly Dead]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ashortsite.com/discs/?page=fatherted |title=Father Ted |work=ashortsite.com |accessdate=10 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005173347/http://www.ashortsite.com/discs/?page=fatherted |archivedate=5 October 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Neil Hannon also provided Ted and Dougal's vocals in the dream sequence version of "My Lovely Horse", which was produced by Allison and Hannon, and later appeared as a [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] on the band's single "[[Gin Soaked Boy]]".

[[File:Father Ted's House (2016).jpg|thumb|The farmhouse in the Burren northeast of [[Kilnaboy]] which was used for external shots of the parochial house (pictured in 2016)]]
Location work for ''Father Ted'' was done mostly in [[County Clare]], including locations at   [[Corofin, County Clare|Corofin]], [[Ennis]], [[Kilfenora]], [[Ennistymon]], and [[Kilnaboy]]. The Parochial House is McCormack's at Glenquin, on the Boston road from Kilnaboy.&lt;ref&gt;McCormack's at Glenquin used for external shots of the parochial house in the Father Ted TV series {{Coord|53.00976|-9.02998|display=inline}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feck.net/splange/ftfaq.html |title=Father Ted FEQ |publisher=Feck.net |date= |accessdate=1 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cinema featured in "[[The Passion of St Tibulus]]" was the Ormonde Cinema, [[Greystones]], [[County Wicklow]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cinematreasures.org/theater/22717/|title=Ormonde Cinema|work=cinematreasures.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "The Field", the location for Funland in "'[[Good Luck, Father Ted]]'", is in [[Portrane]], North [[County Dublin]]. The 'Very Dark Caves' featured in "[[The Mainland (Father Ted)|The Mainland]]" were the [[Aillwee caves]] in [[the Burren]], County Clare.

Some exterior shots for the episode "[[And God Created Woman (Father Ted)|And God Created Woman]]" were filmed in [[Dún Laoghaire]], South County Dublin. The opening sequence (including shots of the [[MV Plassy|''Plassy'' shipwreck]]) were filmed over [[Inisheer]] — the smallest of the [[Aran Islands]]. The interior scenes were recorded at [[the London Studios]] in front of a live studio audience.

==Comedy style==
The series is set in a [[Surreal humour|humorously surreal]] world in which Ted is the only fully rounded normal character among "caricatures", according to Graham Linehan: "exaggerated-over-friendly, over-quiet, over-stupid, over-dull [...] they really only got one thing, they've got one job."&lt;ref name="Baird interview"&gt;[http://www.spiritofgenovia.com/frted/chaptertwo.html "A Peak Inside the Craggy Island Examiner", by Stacey Baird] ''Spirit of Genovia'', c1997 (Retrieved 23 November 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Embarrassment plays a role in many storylines, in a similar fashion to ''[[Fawlty Towers]]''. Linehan says, "if Ted is in a situation that is slightly embarrassing we get him out of it [...] by having him lying or cheating, basically digging a massive hole for himself".&lt;ref name="Baird interview" /&gt; Arthur Mathews has described ''[[Seinfeld]]'' as a major influence on the comedy of ''Father Ted'', with himself and Linehan being "big fans" of the show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/features/2010/1231/1224286538617.html?via=mr "A return to Craggy Island", by Arthur Mathews], [[Irish Times]], 31 December 2010 (Retrieved 23 November 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Father Ted'' also contains references to pop culture, and some film [[parody|parodies]], such as the episode "[[Speed 3]]".

Regarding the series's religious content, Linehan says "Ted doesn't have an anti-religious view of life, but a non-religious view. It's a job to him. He doesn't care about religion." While writing, he says the show's creators imagined Ted and Dougal as "just two people who happen to be [priests]".&lt;ref name="Baird interview" /&gt;

==Critical reception==
''Father Ted'' was met with critical acclaim and is one of the most popular sitcoms in Irish TV history.&lt;ref&gt;Bex, T, Burke, M. &amp; Stockwell, P. ''Contextualized Stylistics: In Honour of Peter Verdonk''. [[Rodopi Publishers]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996 and 1999, the show won the [[BAFTA]] award for Best Comedy, while Morgan also won Best Comedy Performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bafta.org/awards/television/nominations/?year=1995 |title= British Academy of Film and Television Arts Past Nominations 1995 |author= |date= |work= |publisher= British Academy of Film and Television Arts |accessdate=2 November 2010}}; {{cite web |url= http://www.bafta.org/awards/television/nominations/?year=1998 |title= British Academy of Film and Television Arts Past Nominations 1998 |author= |date= |work= |publisher= British Academy of Film and Television Arts |accessdate=2 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 the show won Best New TV Comedy at the [[British Comedy Awards]], with O'Hanlon receiving Top TV Comedy Newcomer Award. At the 1996 British Comedy Awards the show won Top Channel 4 Sitcom Award, McLynn took the Top TV Comedy Actress award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britishcomedyawards.com/pastwinners96.html |title= British Comedy Awards Past Winners 1996 |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=2 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 the show was given the Best Channel 4 Sitcom Award. It was also ranked at number 50 in the [[British Film Institute|BFI]]'s 2000 list of the [[BFI TV 100|100 greatest British television programmes]] of the 20th century, the highest ranking Channel 4 production on the list. In 2004, it came 11th in the poll for [[Britain's Best Sitcom]].

In August 2012, [[Channel 4]] viewers voted the series as the No 1 in ''C4's 30 Greatest Comedy Shows''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/channel_4_30_greatest_comedies/|title=Channel 4's 30 Greatest Comedy Shows|work=comedy.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 January 2011, Channel 4 dedicated a night of programming to celebrate the show's 15th anniversary year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/features/2010/1231/1224286538617.html|title=A return to Craggy Island|date=31 December 2001|work=Irish Times|accessdate=5 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iftn.ie/news/?act1=record&amp;only=1&amp;aid=73&amp;rid=4283579&amp;tpl=archnews&amp;force=1|title=New Adrian McCarthy Doc is Ecumenical Matter |date=23 December 2001|work=iftn.ie|accessdate=5 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included "Father Ted: Unintelligent Design", a documentary on the show's influences, and "Small, Far Away: The World of Father Ted", a documentary revisiting the show's history with the writers and many of the surviving cast (Pauline McLynn declined to take part).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paulinemclynn.com/site/blog/ted|title=Ted|publisher=Pauline McLynn|date=2 January 2011|accessdate=3 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/ten/2011/0104/fatherted.html |title=In Ted We Trust |date=4 January 2011 |work=RTÉ Entertainment |accessdate=5 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102145331/http://www.rte.ie/ten/2011/0104/fatherted.html |archivedate=2 November 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roles reprised===
In 2001, Pauline McLynn reprised her role as Mrs Doyle in a run of advertisements for the UK's [[Inland Revenue]], reminding people to get their taxes in on time with her catchphrase from the programme ("Go on, go on, go on..."). It was voted in an Adwatch poll of 1,000 people as the year's worst advertisement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Mrs Doyle's ad taxes patience of viewers |author= Tania Branigan |newspaper= The Guardian |date= 4 January 2002 |url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/jan/04/advertising.uknews |accessdate=31 December 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 2001, Ardal O'Hanlon returned to the role of Father Dougal for a series of [[PBS]] advertisements to coincide with ''Father Ted''{{'}}s American broadcast; these segments were included on later DVD releases as "Fundraising with Father Dougal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktsmKO97b44|title=Dougal Maguire|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=30 December 2006|accessdate=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbcamericashop.com/dvd/father-ted-the-holy-trilogy-11095.html|title=Father Ted: The Holy Trilogy|work=bbcamericashop.com|accessdate=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Frank Kelly made a brief appearance as Father Jack on an episode of ''[[The One Show]]'' with Graham Norton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNcX1eqjrco|title=Graham Norton Reunited With Father Jack|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=14 November 2012|accessdate=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, guest star [[Ben Keaton]] returned to the role of Father Austin Purcell, performing a stand-up routine and hosting the pub quiz "Arse Biscuits" in-character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lincolnshireecho.co.uk/Meet-neighbour-Prince-Charles-stand-Ben-Keaton/story-27738245-detail/story.html|title=Meet your neighbour: Prince Charles was once made to stand up for Ben Keaton|publisher=''Lincolnshire Echo''|date=6 September 2015|accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thelinc.co.uk/2014/11/review-father-austin-purcell-delights-crowd-within-a-two-metre-radius/|title=Review: Father Austin Purcell delights crowd… within a two metre radius|last=Smith|first=Gregor|publisher=''The Linc''|date=November 2014|accessdate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keaton also set up a Twitter page for the character, and a website where fans can purchase customised Father Purcell video greetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fatheraustinpurcell.xyz|title=Father Austin Purcell|accessdate=21 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150314141502/http://www.fatheraustinpurcell.xyz/|archive-date=14 March 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, he launched the spin-off web series ''Cook Like a Priest''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joe.ie/movies-tv/video-years-after-the-show-ended-this-father-ted-priest-is-still-going-strong/523000|title=Video: Years After the Show Ended, This Father Ted Priest Is Still Going Strong|publisher=joe.ie|last=Cuddihy|first=Tony|date=10 December 2015|accessdate=11 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, Over The Top Wrestling marked the anniversary of Morgan's death with "Ah Ted", an event held in Dublin's [[Tivoli Variety Theatre]]. During the main-event tag-team match between The Lads From the Flats and The Kings of the North, [[Patrick McDonnell (actor)|Patrick McDonnell]], [[Joe Rooney]] and [[Michael Redmond (comedian)|Michael Redmond]] reprised their roles as Eoin McLove, Father Damo Lennon and Father Paul Stone respectively. McLove entered the ring first, withstanding one wrestler's attack on his crotch because he has "no willy", but was soon attacked by Father Damo, who brought the whistle he stole from Benson. Father Stone served as a special guest referee, performing a three-count so slow that one wrestler kicked out after two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstalk.com/Eoin-McLove-Father-Damo-and-Father-Stone-all-turned-up-at-a-Dublin-wrestling-event|title=Eoin McLove, Father Damo and Father Stone all turned up at a Dublin wrestling event|publisher=[[Newstalk]]|last=Kelly|first=Daniel|date=1 March 2016|accessdate=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Rooney appeared as Father Damo in the video for Brave Giant's "The Time I Met the Devil", which follows him on the way to give Mass after a night of alcohol and sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyedge.ie/father-damo-brave-giant-3313163-Mar2017/|title=Here's what Father Damo is up to, 21 years after he appeared on Father Ted|publisher=''[[TheJournal.ie|The Daily Edge]]''|date=29 March 2017|accessdate=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Potential remakes===
Since the end of the series, several attempts to remake ''Father Ted'' have been reported, but none has yet materialised.

In July 2003, it was announced that the show would be remade for the American market. The remake would be scripted by [[Spike Feresten]], who previously wrote for US sitcoms ''[[Seinfeld]]'' and ''[[The Simpsons]]''. Ferensten stated: "I was raised Catholic and this show just felt right to me. The essence of the show is about men who are also priests and, as men, they have many foibles." Hat Trick founders [[Denise O'Donoghue]] and [[Jimmy Mulville]] were set to produce. The US production company was Pariah Productions, which previously adapted ''[[The Kumars at No. 42]]'' for an American audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/jul/01/broadcasting|title=Father Ted crosses the pond|work=guardian.co.uk|last=Cozens|first=Claire|date=1 July 2003|accessdate=9 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2004, Supanet Limited reported that an American remake was in development. This version would be set on a fictional island off the coast of New York. [[Steve Martin]] and [[Graham Norton]] would reportedly play Ted and Dougal. Martin had not been expected to take the role because of his stature, but agreed because he was a fan of the original series, and would reportedly be paid £500,000 per episode. Norton was cast based on his popularity with American audiences, and in reference to his appearance as Father Noel Furlong in the original series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.supanet.com/cgi-bin/news/showfeed.pl?id=1079275308-2&amp;area=entertainment |title=Martin And Norton Team Up Martin And Norton Team Up |publisher=[[Supanet Limited]] |date=14 March 2004 |accessdate=28 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040423160956/http://www.supanet.com/cgi-bin/news/showfeed.pl?id=1079275308-2&amp;area=entertainment |archivedate=23 April 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2007, a separate American remake was announced. Rather than Craggy Island, this version would be set in an unfortunate fishing village in [[New England]]. American actor [[John Michael Higgins]] was cast as Ted, but expressed concerns about the show's religious themes: "The English have a very robust history of being unkind about religion. We don't have that in our country, we're frightened of it. It's basically that you guys are doing an Irish joke also, we don't have that. So I'll be Father Ted, we'll see how it goes." Filming was scheduled to begin in January 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darkhorizons.com/news/9355/higgins-in-us-father-ted-remake|title=Higgins In US Father Ted Remake|work=darkhorizons.com|last=Franklin|first=Garth|date=26 November 2007|accessdate=9 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, Linehan said that there had been "a few attempts" by US broadcasters to remake the show, including one which would have been set in [[Boston]] – an idea Linehan considered "ridiculous".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a619378/the-it-crowds-graham-linehan-on-us-remake-dont-do-my-show.html|title=The IT Crowd's Graham Linehan on US remake: "Don't do my show"|last=Jeffery|first=Morgan|publisher=''[[Digital Spy]]''|date=6 January 2015|accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Musical===
In an interview with ''[[Radio Times]]'' in January 2015, Linehan revealed that he wanted to revive ''Father Ted'' as a musical stage production. He stated that he would never revive the television series itself, "because of the risk you poison people's memories of the original", but that the completely new format would make the project worthwhile. Linehan mentioned the possibility of a dance number with "spinning cardinals". He said that the musical would have to reference the [[Roman Catholic Church sexual abuse scandal in Ireland|Catholic child abuse scandals]], stating, "The jokes would have to have a little bit more edge, because you just can't ignore this stuff." Mathews was "not as convinced" of the musical idea, though Linehan still insisted it could work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2015-01-05/father-ted-the-musical-is-a-heavenly-idea-says-graham-linehan|title=Father Ted the musical is a heavenly idea says Graham Linehan|last=Dowell|first=Ben|publisher=''[[Radio Times]]''|date=5 January 2015|accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December, Mathews said that he and Paul Woodfull were developing a Joshua Trio musical and a show focusing on a "[[Michael Cleary (priest)|Father Michael Cleary]]-type character", and that the ''Father Ted'' musical may follow. He expressed concerns that it would "dilute the product" or be seen as a "cash-in", but said that he believed there was an audience for the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/tv-radio-web/father-ted-christmas-special-comedy-gold-the-frankly-incensed-and-mirth-1.2476180|title=Father Ted Christmas special: comedy gold, the frankly incensed and mirth|publisher=''[[The Irish Times]]''|last=Doyle|first=Martin|date=26 December 2015|accessdate=4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, Linehan said that the musical would draw inspiration from ''[[The Book of Mormon (musical)|The Book of Mormon]]'', and would "go for the jugular ... you get all the things people loved about it, all the innocence and all the sweetness, but introduce a harder edge". Linehan also said that, being a special event, the musical would need to focus on a "world-shaking" story, possibly with Ted becoming Pope due to "some weird succession thing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.businesspost.ie/magazine/social-animal-graham-linehan-384113|title=Social Animal: Graham Linehan|publisher=Business Post|last=Whyte|first=Barry J|date=9 April 2017|accessdate=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June, Linehan said that he hoped [[The Divine Comedy (band)|The Divine Comedy]] frontman [[Neil Hannon]], who wrote the show's music, would return to compose the songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishnews.com/arts/2017/06/03/news/graham-linehan-on-adapting-the-ladykillers-and-a-possible-musical-revival-for-father-ted-1043382/|title=Graham Linehan on a possible musical revival for Father Ted|last=Roy|first=David|publisher=''[[The Irish News]]''|date=3 June 2017|accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, Linehan announced that ''Pope Ted: The Father Ted Musical'' was nearing completion, with a script by Linehan and Mathews and music by Hannon.&lt;ref name="IrishmanAbroad251"&gt;{{cite podcast |title=Graham Linehan on his cancer journey and Father Ted - The Musical: Episode 251 |url=https://soundcloud.com/an-irishman-abroad/graham-linehan-on-his-cancer-journey-and-father-ted-the-musical-episode-251 |author=Jarlath Regan |edition=251 |date=3 July 2018 |work=[[An Irishman Abroad]] |publisher=[[SoundCloud]] |accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linehan said, "It's the real final episode of ''Father Ted''. This is true and not one of my stupid jokes, I promise. Didn't want to do something until the right idea came along. This was the right idea. Arthur and I have been laughing our arses off while writing it. Just like the old days."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://metro.co.uk/2018/06/02/father-ted-creator-reveals-show-turned-musical-real-final-episode-7599437/|title=Father Ted creator reveals show is being turned into a musical: ‘It’s the real final episode’|last=Starkey|first=Adam|publisher=''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]''|date=2 June 2018|accessdate=2 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

{{Hermeticism}}

The '''Fraternity of the Hidden Light''' (also known as '''FLO''' or '''Fraternitas L.V.X. Occulta''') is a [[magical organization]] and "Aquarian Age" mystery school in the [[Western Mystery Tradition]]. The FLO teaches occult sciences, such as [[Tarot]], [[Qabalah]], [[Alchemy]], [[Astrology]], and related Arcane Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lvx.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The Fraternity of the Hidden Light traces its lineage to the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Concise Guide to Today's Religions and Spirituality|last=Walker|first=James K.|page=152|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AMUpn_AK8iQC&amp;pg=PA152|publisher=Harvest House Publishers|year=2007|isbn=9780736920117|accessdate=2013-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fraternity website (in a section entitled "History") tells the story of the rise of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn but also of a new Order that was founded by former members of the Thoth-Hermes temple of the [[Alpha et Omega]], in New York.&lt;ref&gt;http://szermeno.homestead.com/about.html&lt;/ref&gt; Though this description does not give names, the events of which it speaks point to and suggest [[Paul Foster Case]]'s founding of the School of Ageless Wisdom, later called the [[Builders of the Adytum]] or B.O.T.A.

The Fraternity of the Hidden Light was founded in the early 1980s, by Dr. Paul Clark, who trained with B.O.T.A.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, P. (2013). ''Paul Foster Case. His Life and Works''. Covina CA: Fraternity of the Hidden Light, 5&lt;/ref&gt;The Fraternity has lodges on all continents (except Antarctica).&lt;ref&gt;http://occultofpersonality.net/podcast-66-dr-paul-clark/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==

According to its website, the Fraternity of the Hidden Light exists for a three-fold purpose: “(1) To act as a modern day repository of the Ancient Wisdom teachings of the Tarot, Qabalah, Alchemy, Astrology and related Arcane sciences; (2) To train its members for the service to humanity, by providing a seeding ground for their growth and development through group and individual applications of the Wisdom teachings; (3) To promulgate the Ancient Wisdom teachings in an effort to elevate the consciousness of humanity.”&lt;ref&gt;http://szermeno.homestead.com/&lt;/ref&gt; In the Statement of Purpose, the Fraternity emphasizes the importance of service and states that the practices of the Fraternity are for the development of "Wisdom, Power and Love".&lt;ref&gt;http://szermeno.homestead.com/about.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==

The Fraternity of the Hidden Light is structured into several levels. There is first the "Probationary" level, in which training in general esoteric knowledge and basic skills, such as meditation, is given.

The others are initiatory levels. The first or "outer" order focuses on the "growth of Wisdom, Love and Power" and the development "of their being, resulting in balance and harmony. The second or "inner" order consists of those who have both achieved this inner harmony but have also received "illumination," i.e. the higher Self is "awakened and in control of their lives." The third order includes the "Great Adepts and Masters" from the throughout ages who guide the Fraternity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lvx.org/about.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influences ==

Paul Foster Case's work is a major influence on the Fraternity of the Hidden Light. Indeed, the Fraternity has published the original lessons that Case wrote for the School of Ageless Wisdom, the organization that later became B.O.T.A.&lt;ref&gt;Case, Paul F. (2008). Occult Fundamentals and Spiritual Unfoldment. Vol. 1: The Early Writings. [no location given]: Fraternity of the Hidden Light; Case, Paul F. (2008). Esoteric Secrets of Meditation and Magic. Vol. 2: The Early Writings. [no location given]: Fraternity of the Hidden Light&lt;/ref&gt; The Steward of the Fraternity has recently published a book entitled ''Paul Foster Case. His Life and Works''. [[Ann Davies (occultist)|Ann Davies]], who took over the leadership of BOTA after the death of Case, is also an important influence on the Fraternity. Paul Clark is also an acknowledged authority on the thought of Dion Fortune who also influences the Fraternity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blogtalkradio.com/laughingwomanmedia/2014/06/20/goddess-alive--the-life-legacy-of-dion-fortune-with-dr-paul-clark&lt;/ref&gt; The emphasis on the triad Wisdom, Power and Love in the Statement of Purpose echoes the goals of the esoteric orders according to Dion Fortune in ''Esoteric Orders and their Work'', Chapter 3.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ourladyisgod.com/images/eBooks/Dion_Fortune_-_Esoteric_Orders_And_Their_Work_cd6_id1971727491_size183.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Friends meeting house''' is a [[meeting house]] of the [[Religious Society of Friends]] (Quakers), where [[meeting for worship]] is usually held. Typically Friends meeting houses do not have steeples.

==History==
Quakers do not believe that [[meeting for worship]] should occur in any special place.  They believe that "''where two or three meet together in my name, I am there among them''" ([[Revised English Bible]], [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], Ch 18, v 20). Therefore, [[meeting for worship]] may take place in any place.  Early [[Quakers]] often met for worship outdoors or in local public buildings.  However, when the [[Religious Society of Friends]] began to grow there became a need for buildings to house their meetings.

Quakers have always reserved the word ''church'' to mean the body of people who make up the worshipping community:  Quakers do not use the word ''church'' to refer to the bricks and mortar of a worshipping community.  [[George Fox]], an early [[Quaker]], spoke of places of worship that have steeples as ''steeple houses'', and those that do not as ''[[meeting house]]s''.  This practice is shared by a number of other non-conformist Christian denominations, including [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]], [[Christadelphian]]s, [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] and [[Mennonite]]s.

Some Friends meeting houses were adapted from existing structures, but most were purpose-built. [[Briggflatts Meeting House]] in [[Cumbria]], England is an example of the latter. The hallmark of a meeting house is extreme simplicity and the absence of any liturgical symbols. More specifically, though, the defining characteristics of the Quaker meetinghouse are simplicity, equality, community, and peace. Though never explicitly written or spoken about, these tenets (or “Testimonies”) of Quakerism were the basic, and only, guidelines for building a meetinghouse, as was seen through the continuity of the use of Testimonies within meetinghouse design. While meetinghouse design evolved over time to a standardization of the double-cell structure without explicit guidelines for building, the meetinghouse’s reflective architecture revealed a deeper meaning. The meetinghouse design manifested and enhanced Quaker Testimonies and the cultivation of the Inner Light that was essential to Friends. Quakers easily moved from one place of meeting to another, but when given the opportunity to design and construct their own place of meeting, Friends infused their Testimonies in the planning, design, and construction of the building. 
[[File:Colora Meeting House CecilCo MD interior.JPG|thumb|upright=1.1|Interior of the [[Colora Meetinghouse]] in [[Maryland]], showing the facing benches and the moveable divider typical of 18th and 19th century meetinghouses in the area]]
Meeting Houses built in a traditional style usually had two meeting rooms: one for the main meeting for worship, and another where the women's business meeting may be held (often referred to as the women's meeting room).  Meeting houses of this style usually have a ''minister's gallery'' at one end of the meeting room, where traditionally those ''traveling in the ministry'' would have sat, with an ''elders bench'' immediately in front of this.  Wooden benches facing this occupy the rest of the room, often with a gallery for extra seating.  Meeting houses of this style usually have high windows so that worshippers sitting in [[meeting for worship]] cannot see outside.

Meeting houses built in a more modern design will usually consist of: a large meeting room, smaller rooms for committees, children's classes, etc., a kitchen and toilets.

The meeting room itself is a place for Friends to withdraw from the world. The windows are set sufficiently high that worshippers will not be distracted by the activities of the world's people outside, or in some cases they provide a view into the meeting house garden. The seating was originally long, hard and wooden. Today it is usually separate chairs but the layout remains the same – a square or rectangle facing inwards to a central table.

The '''Global Buddhist Network''' (GBN), previously known as the '''Dhammakaya Media Channel''' (DMC) is a Thai online [[Thai television|television channel]] concerned with Buddhism. The channel's taglines were "The secrets of life revealed" and "The only one", but these were later replaced by "Channel for the path to the cessation of suffering and attainment of Dhamma". The channel features many types of programs with Buddhist content, and has programs in several languages.

The channel started in 2002, as a means to reach remote provinces in Thailand. Controversially, the channel made international headlines in 2012 when it featured a teaching on the afterlife of [[Steve Jobs]]. On 26 December 2016, Thai authorities withdrew the permit for the satellite channel permanently, during the [[History of Wat Phra Dhammakaya#Klongchan controversy|legal investigations into the temple]] by the [[National Council for Peace and Order|Thai junta]]. In April 2017, it was reported, however, that the channel's programming had continued, but broadcast through the Internet only. In its online format, the channel has been renamed Global Buddhist Network.

The temple therefore provided live teachings through a thousand public telephone lines, through which people could follow the activities.

== Steve Jobs controversy ==
In 2012, the temple broadcast a talk by Luang Por Dhammajayo, the then abbot of [[Wat Phra Dhammakaya]], about what happened to [[Steve Jobs]] after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Crisis in Thai Buddhism|url=http://www.asiasentinel.com/society/the-crisis-in-thai-buddhism/|accessdate=16 November 2016|work=[[Asia Sentinel]]|date=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The talk came as a response to a software engineer of [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] who had sent a letter with questions to the abbot. Luang Por Dhammajayo described how Steve Jobs looked like in heaven.&lt;ref name="Sify 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TNA 2016" /&gt; He said that Jobs had been reborn as a ''[[deva (Buddhism)|deva]]'' (heavenly being) living close to his former offices,&lt;ref name="Sify 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WSJ 2012" /&gt; as a result of the [[Karma (Buddhism)|karma]] of having given knowledge to people.

Critics such as [[Phra Paisal Visalo]] and religion scholar Surapot Taweesak pressed the [[Supreme Sangha Council]], who leads the monastic community in Thailand, to investigate further as to whether Luang Por Dhammajayo had fraudulent intentions. Surapot, known for his liberal views on [[separation of church and state|separation of religion and state]], was criticized by sociologist Kengkit Kitirianglap and others, however, for abandoning his liberal position. With regard to the teaching about Steve Jobs, Kengkit argued that the state, of which the council is part, should not get involved in what is "true Buddhism" and what is not. Surapot replied that urging the council to crack down on Luang Por Dhammajayo does not go against democratic principles, because the [[Vinaya|monastic discipline]] applies to all monks equally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thaweesak|first1=Surapot|script-title=สตีฟ จ็อบส์ ฉบับธรรมกาย กับปัญหาธรรมวินัยและการประยุกต์พุทธธรรม|trans-title=Dhammakaya's version of Steve Jobs and the problem of Vinaya and applying Buddhism|url=https://prachatai.com/journal/2012/08/42293|accessdate=31 December 2017|work=[[Prachatai]]|date=26 August 2012|language=th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kitirianglap|first1=Kengkit|script-title=ปัญหาธรรมกาย-พระไพศาล-มหาเถรสมาคม-สุรพศ และบททดลองเสนอเกี่ยวกับสถานะของสถาบันศาสนาในสังคมไทย|trans-title=The problem about Dhammakaya, Phra Paisal, Supreme Sangha Council and Surapot, and a hypothesis about religious institutions in Thai society|url=https://prachatai.com/journal/2012/08/42403|accessdate=31 December 2017|work=[[Prachatai]]|date=31 August 2012|language=th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thaweesak|first1=Surapot|script-title=ปัญหาการอ้าง 'ศาสนาเป็นอิสระจากรัฐ' กับความชอบธรรมในการดำเนินการทางพระธรรมวินัย|trans-title=The problem of citing 'religion is independent from the state' and justice in Vinaya procedures|url=https://prachatai.com/journal/2012/09/42410|accessdate=31 December 2017|work=[[Prachatai]]|date=1 September 2012|language=th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The channel could be received through the Internet only, and featured very similar contents as before, although the temple's spokesperson assured there would be no further attempts at mobilizing people.&lt;ref name="Spring 2017"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnFmQymYLaI|script-title=กลับมาแล้วทีวีธรรมกาย ถ่ายสดวันเกิดธัมมชโย|language=th|trans-title=Dhammakaya's television has returned: live broadcast of Dhammajayo's birthday|work=[[Spring News]]|date=24 April 2017|access-date=14 June 2017|first1=Danai|last1=Ekmahasawat|first2=Amonrat|last2=Mahitthiruk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite news|script-title=วันคล้ายวันเกิดครบ 73 ปี พระธัมมชโย วัดพระธรรมกาย-ลูกศิษย์จัดงานทำบุญวันคุ้มครองโลก|trans-title=Phra Dhammajayo's 73rd birthday: devotees organize Earth Day ceremony|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCYSN8uDd20|accessdate=15 June 2017|work=[[Thai PBS]]|date=22 April 2017|language=th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the channel continued in online formats only, through a website and a separate online broadcast. {{As of|2017|post=,}} the website ranked 674th of all Thai websites on the [[Alexa (website)|Alexa]] ranking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/dmc.tv|title=dmc.tv Traffic Statistics|last=|first=|date=15 August 2017|website=[[Alexa Internet]]|access-date=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The closing down of DMC was not the last time that the junta decided to impose sanctions against a media outlet. In March 2017, the junta closed down [[Voice TV]] for seven days, after the channel criticized the martial law imposed on Wat Phra Dhammakaya during the junta's crackdown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Thai PBS]]|url=http://news.thaipbs.or.th/content/261187|title=มติบอร์ด กสท.สั่งปิด "วอยซ์ทีวี" เพิ่มเป็น 7 วัน หลังอนุกก.ผังรายการ กสทช.ให้ปิด 3 วัน|language=th|trans-title=Board of Broadcasting Commission orders closing down Voice TV for four more days, after its planning subcommittee ordered three days shut down|date=27 March 2017|access-date=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; And in August the same year, [[Peace TV (Thailand)|Peace TV]] was also closed down for a month, the junta citing "it broke the rules of the [[National Council for Peace and Order|NCPO]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Thai Rath]]|url=https://www.thairath.co.th/content/1033730|title=นายกฯ ยันปิด "พีซทีวี" ไร้ใบสั่งการเมือง ไม่เกี่ยวคดี “ปู” จำนำข้าว|language=th|trans-title=PM denies closing down Peace TV for political reasons, nothing to do with lawsuit pawed rice Yingluck|date=10 August 2017|access-date=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some reports related this to a policy of removing [[Thaksin Shinawatra|former PM Thaksin]]'s influence, a policy which has also been connected with Wat Phra Dhammakaya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Thai PBS]]|url=http://englishnews.thaipbs.or.th/nbtc-suspends-red-shirt-peace-tvs-broadcasting-licence-30-days/|title=NBTC suspends red-shirt Peace TV’s broadcasting licence 30 days|date=10 August 2017|access-date=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.alterasia.org/201505044141/de-recuperation-politique-bouddhisme/|title=De la récupération politique du bouddhisme|last1=Mérieau|first1=Eugénie|date=4 April 2015|work=Gavroche|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729095122/http://www.alterasia.org/201505044141/de-recuperation-politique-bouddhisme/|archive-date=29 July 2017|language=fr|trans-title=About the political recovery of Buddhism|via=Alter Asia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heru-ra-ha is composed of [[#Active aspect|Ra-Hoor-Khuit]] and [[#Passive aspect|Hoor-paar-kraat]].&lt;ref&gt;''Book of Thoth'', XX, The Aeon.&lt;/ref&gt; He is associated with the other two major Thelemic deities found in ''The Book of the Law,'' [[Nuit]] and [[Hadit]], who are also godforms related to ancient [[Egyptian mythology]]. Their [[Stele of Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu|stelae]] link Nuit and Hadit to the established [[ancient Egypt]]ian deities [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]] and Hor-Bhdt ([[Horus]] of [[Edfu]]).

==Active aspect&lt;!--'Ra-Hoor-Khuit' redirects here--&gt;==
The Active Aspect of Heru-ra-ha is '''Ra-Hoor-Khuit'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (Egyptian: Ra-Hoor-Khu-It,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crowley|first=Aleister|title=Liber Al vel Legis|year=1904|pages=Chapter 1, Verse 36|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/oto/engccxx.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ra-Har-Khuti, Ra-Har-Akht or [[Ra-Horakhty]]), more commonly referred to by the Greek transliteration ''Ra-Herakhty'', means "Ra (who is) Horus on the Horizon."&lt;ref&gt;See for example [http://www.seattleartmuseum.org/exhibit/archive/egypt/Emania/epedia/deities/Rehorakhty.htm Seattle Art Museum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070401032256/http://www.seattleartmuseum.org/Exhibit/Archive/egypt/emania/epedia/deities/Rehorakhty.htm |date=2007-04-01 }} and [http://www.wagenburg.at/staticE/page161.html Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929025515/http://www.wagenburg.at/staticE/page161.html |date=2007-09-29 }}. The latter also shows [[Hadit|the winged sun globe]] in connection with "the new idea that the deceased could become one with the sun god, previously only a royal prerogative."&lt;/ref&gt; Ra-Hoor-Khuit or Ra-Hoor-Khut is the speaker in the Third Chapter of ''The Book of the Law''. Some quotes from his Chapter:

* "Now let it be first understood that I am a god of War and of Vengeance." (AL III:3)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crowley|first=Aleister|title=Liber Al vel Legis|year=1904|pages=Chapter 3, Verse 3|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/oto/engccxx.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* "Fear not at all; fear neither men nor Fates, nor gods, nor anything. Money fear not, nor laughter of the folk folly, nor any other power in heaven or upon the earth or under the earth. Nu is your refuge as Hadit your light; and I am the strength, force, vigour, of your arms." (AL III:17)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crowley|first=Aleister|title=Liber Al vel Legis|year=1904|pages=Chapter 3, Verse 17|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/oto/engccxx.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* "I am the warrior Lord of the Forties: the Eighties cower before me, &amp; are abased. I will bring you to victory &amp; joy: I will be at your arms in battle &amp; ye shall delight to slay. Success is your proof; courage is your armour; go on, go on, in my strength; &amp; ye shall turn not back for any!" (AL III:46)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crowley|first=Aleister|title=Liber Al vel Legis|year=1904|pages=Chapter 3, Verse 46|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/oto/engccxx.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* "There is no law beyond Do what thou wilt." (AL III:60)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crowley|first=Aleister|title=Liber Al vel Legis|year=1904|pages=Chapter 3, Verse 60|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/oto/engccxx.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Thelema, Ra-Hoor-Khuit is called the Lord of the [[Aeon (Thelema)|Aeon]] (which began in 1904 according to Thelemic doctrine), and The Crowned and Conquering Child. 

According to the instructions that Crowley claimed to have received from the 8th [[Enochian magic|Enochian Aethyr]], the five-pointed "star of flame" symbolizes Ra-Hoor-Khuit in certain contexts.&lt;ref&gt;''Liber VIII'' and ''Liber 418'', 8th Aethyr&lt;/ref&gt;

An appellation of [[Ra]], identifying him with [[Horus]], this name shows the two as manifestations of the singular Solar Force. "Khuit" also refers to a local form of the goddess [[Hathor]] at Athribis,&lt;ref&gt;''Géographie ancienne de la Basse-Égypte'' by Jacques Rougé, p 65-66. pub. 1891.

==Passive aspect&lt;!--'Hoor-pa-kraat' redirects here--&gt;==
The Passive Aspect of Heru-ra-ha is '''Hoor-pa-kraat'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (Egyptian: Har-par-khered), more commonly referred to by the Greek transliteration ''Harpocrates'', meaning "Horus the Child"; [[Horus]], the son of [[Isis]] and [[Osiris]], sometimes distinguished from their brother Horus the Elder,&lt;ref&gt;Papyrus Bremner-Rhind, via [https://books.google.com/books?id=mkWWo3WokjMC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;lpg=PA98&amp;dq=five+children+nut+geb&amp;source=web&amp;ots=cP8tnYZLSK&amp;sig=Wu64i9QutAAzoEawftYC_EErwg0 Creation Stories of the Middle East] by Ewa Wasilewska, 2000. Google Books preview retrieved January 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; who was the old patron deity of Upper Egypt. Hoor is represented as a young boy with a child's sidelock of hair, sucking his finger. The Greeks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Daimon/Harpokrates.html |title=HARPOCRATES : Greek god of silence ; mythology : HARPOKRATES |publisher=Theoi.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ovid]] and the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]] attributed silence to him, presumably because the sucking of the finger is suggestive of the common "shhh"-gesture. 

Aiwass, the being who dictated ''The Book of the Law'' to Crowley, introduces himself as "the minister of Hoor-paar-kraat" in the book's first chapter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crowley|first=Aleister|title=Liber Al vel Legis|year=1904|pages=Chapter 1, Verse 7|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/oto/engccxx.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Also known as "The Babe in the Lotus", Hoor-paar-kraat is sometimes thought of as the baby Ra-Hoor-Khuit&lt;ref&gt;''Liber Samekh'' p 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes as the younger brother of Horus.&lt;ref&gt;Regardie's account of ''The Golden Dawn'', invisible stations in "The Enterer of the Threshold", p 344. ''777'' also has one reference to this interpretation, in the Vital Triads on p 41.&lt;/ref&gt; The former interpretation in the works of Aleister Crowley portrays Ra-Hoor-Khuit—in place of the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn|Golden Dawn]]'s [[Osiris]]/[[Jesus]]—as a model for the initiate, and thus describes attainment as a natural growth process, de-emphasizing the metaphor of death and resurrection. In the second interpretation, the Golden Dawn placed Hoor-paar-kraat at the center of their Hall of [[Ma'at]] while the officers of the temple (one of whom represented Horus) revolved around him.

==Combined form==
The Cry of the First Aethyr in Crowley's ''[[The Vision and the Voice|Liber 418]]'' presents Horus, the Crowned and Conquering Child, as the union of many opposites.

''&lt;blockquote&gt;It is a little child covered with lilies and roses. He is supported by countless myriads of [[Archangels]]. The Archangels are all the same colourless brilliance, and every one of them is blind. Below the Archangels again are many, many other legions, and so on far below, so far that the eye cannot pierce. And on his forehead, and on his heart, and in his hand, is the secret sigil of the Beast. (fn: Sun and moon conjoined)  And of all this the glory is so great that all the spiritual senses fail, and their reflections in the body fail.(...)This child danceth not, but it is because he is the soul of the two dances, --- the right hand and the left hand, and in him they are one dance, the dance without motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crowley|first=Aleister|title=The Vision and the Voice|url=http://hermetic.com/crowley/the-vision-and-the-voice/aetyr1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;''

'''Hiacoomes''' (~1610s – 1690) was a [[Wampanoag]] [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] from the island of [[Martha's Vineyard]], ([[Massachusett language|Wampanoag]]: {{lang|ro|Noepe}}), who in 1643 became the first member of his society to [[Religious conversion|convert]] to Christianity under the tutelage of the missionary [[Thomas Mayhew|Thomas Mayhew Jr]]. He would then, with the assistance of Mayhew, become a leading preacher to his fellow Wampanoag on the island, playing a major role in the widespread conversion of the Wampanoag from their traditional beliefs to Christianity.

== Early life and contact with the English ==
Little is known of Hiacoomes' early life except that he was of 'mean' descent and described as "a man of a sad and sober spirit"&lt;ref&gt;Henry Whitfield, ''The Light Appearing More and More Towards the Perfect Day or A farther Discovery of the Present State of the Indians in New England concerning the progresse of the Gospel Amongst Them'' (London, 1651), p.3&lt;/ref&gt; who had a low ranking in the then existing social hierarchy of the Wampanoag.&lt;ref&gt;Experience Mayhew, ''Indian Converts, or some Account of the Lives and Dying Speeches of a considerable number of the Christianized Indians of Martha's Vineyard in New England'' (London, 1727), p.1-2&lt;/ref&gt; In 1639 the first English settlement of the island, under the direction of [[Thomas Mayhew|Thomas Mayhew Senior]], had begun at [[Edgartown]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Gookin. Historical collections of the Indians in New England. Of their several

conversion ... Also suggesting some expedients for their further civilizing and propagating the Christian faith among them (Boston: Apollo Press, 1792), 1-89.

He even attended religious meetings, where he managed to catch the curiosity of Thomas Mayhew Junior (1618?–1657), son of the island's governor and local pastor to the English.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid'', p.1-2&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing this curiosity, the younger Mayhew invited Hiacoomes to his house each Sabbath evening where the soon-to-be missionary to the Indians would teach and instruct his native charge in the doctrines and ideas of Puritanism. Under his direction, Hiacoomes became a professed Christian, learning how to read in the process.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid'', p.3-4&lt;/ref&gt; A letter reference dating from 1651 puts him at that moment as about 30 years of age, so if that is to be believed then Hiacoomes at this stage would have been in his early-to-mid 20s.&lt;ref&gt;Whitfield, ''Light Appearing'', p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

== As a Christian ==
At first Hiacoomes mostly faced opposition from his fellow Wampanoag, some of whom mocked him and called him "an English man".&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid'', p.3-6&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition from sachems to this English innovation was widespread.&lt;ref&gt;Mayhew, ''Indian Converts'', p.77&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1646 an epidemic hit the island devastating the native population, following a similar epidemic which had occurred three years earlier. It is estimated that about half of the native population of the island perished in these plagues.&lt;ref&gt;David J. Silverman, ''Faith and Boundaries: Colonists, Christianity, and Community among the Wampanoag Indians of Martha's Vineyard, 1600–1871'' (Cambridge University Press, New York, 2005), p.22-24, 74&lt;/ref&gt; But Hiacoomes and his family were unaffected. That, and the use of cures by Thomas Mayhew Junior, gave a medical appeal to Christianity in a place where traditional shamanism had failed.&lt;ref&gt;See William S. Simmons, Conversion from Indian to Puritan in ''The New England Quarterly'', Vol. 52, No.2 (Jun 1979), pp. 197–218&lt;/ref&gt; This interest was transferred to a group of sachems, led by [[Miohqsoo]] and [[Towanquatick]], who invited Hiacoomes to a meeting six miles away late at night where he was to discuss his religion with these sachems. The records of this discussion are described in [[Experience Mayhew]]'s ''Indian Converts'':

{{quote|
Hiacoomes being come, Miohqsoo gladly received him, and told him what he desired of him; the sum whereof was, that he would shew his heart to them, and let them know how it stood towards God, and what they ought to do.

Hiacoomes very gladly embraced this call and opportunity to instruct them, declaring to them all Things which he himself had learned, concerning [[Trinity|God the Father, Son and Holy Ghost]], shewing them what this God did for Mankind, and what their Duty was towards him.

Having finished his speech, Miohqsoo asked him, How many Gods the English worshipped? Hiacoomes answered ONE, and no more. Whereupon Miohqsoo reckoned up about 37 principal Gods which he had; and shall I, said he, throw away all these 37 for the sake of one only? What do you your self think, said Hiacoomes? For my part I have thrown away all these, and many more, some Years ago, and yet I am preserved as you see this Day. You speak true, Said Miohqsoo; and therefore I will throw away all my Gods too, and serve that one God with you&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Mayhew, ''Indian Converts'', p.77-78&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From this point on, with greater community support Hiacoomes began preaching more openly on theological topics such as sin, the Trinity, the fall of Adam and the redeeming role of faith in Christ.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid'', p.9&lt;/ref&gt; He especially attacked the shamans, who were deemed to be agents of the Devil by the English&lt;ref&gt;James Axtell, ''The Invasion Within: The Contest of Cultures in Colonial North America'' (Oxford University Press, New York, 1985), p.278-228&lt;/ref&gt; as well as being seen as the principal source of opposition to the new faith.&lt;ref&gt;Whitfield, ''Light Appearing'', p.7, 37&lt;/ref&gt; In 1649 he publicly faced down the shamans by challenging them to kill him using their magic, which he said was inferior to that of God.&lt;ref name="Ibid"&gt;''Ibid'', p.9-10&lt;/ref&gt; He survived and this failure must have helped discredit the shamans as it was followed by a rash of conversions.&lt;ref name="Ibid" /&gt; By 1651 Christian Practices were already spreading quickly throughout the community and according to Thomas Mayhew Junior, there were already 199 Wampanoag who "professed themselves to be worshippers of ... God".&lt;ref&gt;Henry Whitfield, ''Strength out of Weakness: Or a Glorious Manifestation of the Further Progress of the Gospel among the Indians in New England'' (London, 1652 [New York, 1865]), p.45&lt;/ref&gt; Several of these converts were ex-shamans.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid'', p.42-46&lt;/ref&gt; By then, Hiacoomes was preaching twice every Sunday in sermons agreed upon with Mayhew who was still very much teaching and instructing his first charge.&lt;ref&gt;Whitfield, ''Light Appearing'', p.13; Mayhew, ''Indian Converts'', p.9-10&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later life ==
In this path he continued for the rest of his life, although greatly interrupted by the untimely death of Thomas Mayhew Junior in 1657,&lt;ref name="MayhewIndian"&gt;Mayhew, ''Indian Converts'', p.10&lt;/ref&gt; but despite this setback, he continued to play a major role in spreading Christianity, so that by 1660 nearly all the island's Wampanoag community had formally become Christian.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid'', p.10&lt;/ref&gt; Even as late as 1674, Hiacoomes was still seen by one English commentator as the leading "Indian teacher" on the island.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Gookin, ''Historical Collections of the Indians in New England of their several nations, numbers, customs, manners, religion and government, before the English Planted there'' (Boston, 1674), p.14&lt;/ref&gt; By then, it was Wampanoag missionaries themselves and not English ones who were leading the conversion charge.&lt;ref&gt;David J Silverman, Indians, Missionaries, and Religious Translation: Creating Wampanoag Christianity in Seventeenth-Century Martha's Vineyard in ''The William and Mary Quarterly'', Third Series, Vol. 62, No. 2 (Apr 2005), p.169&lt;/ref&gt; He had several children, one of whom, [[Joel Hiacoomes|Joel]] or Ioel, was one of the five Indian students who attended [[Indian College|Harvard Indian College]] during its brief existence but died while there.&lt;ref&gt;Gookin, ''Historical Collections'', p.15&lt;/ref&gt; In 1670, under the aegis of [[John Eliot (missionary)|John Eliot]] and [[Josiah Cotton|John Cotton Jr]]., the first formal Indian church was created on the island, with Hiacoomes ordained as minister alongside [[John Tackanash]].&lt;ref name="MayhewIndian" /&gt; He gave the funeral oration after the latter's death in 1683.&lt;ref&gt;Mayhew, ''Indian Converts'', p.11&lt;/ref&gt; He died in 1690. Several members of his family and descendants would also become leading Christian Indians on the island.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid'', p.91-96, 187–188, 262–264, 84&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Islam in Europe by country}}

[[Islam]] is the second largest religious belief in [[Europe]] after [[Christianity]].{{fact|date=October 2017}} Although the majority of Muslim communities in Europe are of recent migrations, there are pre-Modern ones in the [[Balkans]].

Islam entered southern Europe through the invading "[[Moors]]" of [[North Africa]] in the 8th–10th centuries; Muslim political entities existed firmly in what is today [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[South Italy]] and [[Malta]] for several centuries. The Muslim community in these territories was converted or expelled by the end of the 15th century (see ''[[Reconquista]]''). Islam expanded into the [[Caucasus]] through the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]] in the 7th century. The [[Ottoman Empire]] expanded into southeastern Europe, invading and conquering huge portions of the [[Byzantine Empire]] in the 14th and 15th centuries. Over the centuries, the Ottoman Empire also gradually lost almost all of its European territories, until the empire collapsed in 1922. The countries of the Balkans continue to have large populations of native Muslims, though the majority are [[Cultural Muslim|unobservant or secular]].

The term "Muslim Europe" is used for the Muslim-majority countries of [[Albania]], [[Kosovo]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Transcontinental countries, such as [[Turkey]], [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Kazakhstan]] have large Muslim populations, as does [[Russia]] in the [[North Caucasus]].

In the late 20th and early 21st centuries substantial numbers of Muslims [[Immigration to Europe#Immigration from outside Europe since the 1980s|immigrated to Western Europe]]. By 2010 an estimated 44 million Muslims were living in Europe (6%), including an estimated 19 million in the EU (3.8%).{{sfn|Pew 2011}} They are projected to comprise 8% by 2030.{{fact|date=October 2017}} They are often the subject of intense discussion and political campaigns. These have been periodically revived by events such as [[Islamic terrorism|terrorist attacks by Islamists]], the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|cartoons affair in Denmark]], debates over [[Islamic dress]], and ongoing support for [[populism|populist]] [[Radical right (Europe)|right-wing parties]] that view Muslims as a threat to [[European values]], culture and ways of life. Such events have also fueled growing debate regarding the topic of [[Islamophobia]], attitudes toward Muslims and the populist right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goodwin|first1=Matthew J.|last2=Cutts|first2=David|last3=Janta-Lipinski|first3=Laurence|title=Economic Losers, Protestors, Islamophobes or Xenophobes? Predicting Public Support for a Counter-Jihad Movement|journal=Political Studies|date=September 2014|pages=n/a–n/a|doi=10.1111/1467-9248.12159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Muslim population in Europe is extremely diverse with varied histories and origins. Today, the Muslim-majority regions of Europe are [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Albania]], [[Kosovo]], parts of  [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] and [[Montenegro]], as well as some [[Subdivisions of Russia|Russian regions]] in [[Northern Caucasus]] and the [[Volga]] region. The communities consist predominantly of indigenous Europeans of the Muslim faith whose religious tradition dates back several hundred years. The [[List of countries spanning more than one continent|transcontinental]] countries of [[Turkey]], [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Kazakhstan]] also are Muslim majority.

===Moors, Al-Andalus and Sicily===
{{Main article|Moors|Al-Andalus|Emirate of Sicily}} [[File:Jaume I, Cantigas de Santa Maria, s.XIII.jpg|thumb|The [[Moors]] request permission from [[James I of Aragon]], Spain, 13th century]]
Muslim forays into Europe began shortly after the religion's inception, with a short-lived invasion of [[Byzantine Sicily]] by a small [[Rashidun army|Arab and Berber force]] that landed in 652. Islam gained its first genuine foothold in continental Europe from 711 onward, with the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania]]. The Arabs renamed the land [[Al-Andalus]], which expanded to include the larger parts of what is now Portugal and Spain except for the northern highlands. It is estimated that Al-Andalus had a Muslim majority by the 10th century after most of the local population willingly converted to Islam.{{sfn|Hourani|2002|p=42}} This coincided with the ''[[La Convivencia]]'' period of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] as well as the [[Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain]]. The Christian counter-offensive known as the ''[[Reconquista]]'' began in the early 8th century, when Muslim forces managed to temporarily push into [[Aquitaine|southern France]]. Slowly, the Christian forces began a re-conquest of the fractured [[Taifa|Taifa kingdoms]] of Al-Andalus. There was still a Muslim presence north of Spain, especially in [[Fraxinet]] all the way into [[Switzerland]] until the 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;Manfred, W: "International Journal of Middle East Studies", pages 59-79, Vol. 12, No. 1. Middle East Studies Association of North America, Aug 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; Muslim forces under the [[Aghlabids]] [[Muslim conquest of Sicily|conquered Sicily]] after a series of expeditions spanning 827–902, and had notably [[Arab raid against Rome|raided Rome]] in 846. The [[Emirate of Sicily]] was established in 965. Arabs held onto southern Italy until their [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|expulsion by the Normans]] in 1072. By 1236, practically all that remained of Muslim Spain was the southern province of [[Granada]].

The Arabs imposed [[Sharia]], thus, the Latin- and Greek-speaking Christian communities, as well as a community of Jews, had limited [[freedom of religion]] under the Muslims as ''[[dhimmi]]'' (non-Muslims). They were required to pay ''[[jizya]]'' (poll tax), ''[[kharaj]]'' (land tax), but exempt from the Muslim tax of ''[[zakaat]]''. These taxes marked their status as subject to Muslim rule, albeit in exchange for protection against foreign and internal aggression.

Muslim rule endured in the [[Emirate of Granada]], from 1238 as a [[vassal state]] of the Christian [[Kingdom of Castile]], until the completion of [[La Reconquista]] in 1492.{{sfn|Hourani|2002|p=41}} The [[Morisco]]s (Moorish in Spanish) were finally expelled from [[Spain]] between 1609 (Castile) and 1614 (rest of Spain), by [[Philip III of Spain#Expulsion of the Moors (1609–1610)|Philip III]] during the [[Spanish Inquisition]].

Throughout the 16th to 19th centuries, the [[Barbary coast|Barbary States]] sent [[Barbary pirates|pirates to raid]] nearby parts of Europe in order to capture Christian slaves to sell at [[Arab slave trade|slave markets]] in the [[Arab World]] throughout the Renaissance period.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/white_slaves_02.shtml |title=British Slaves on the Barbary Coast}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.city-journal.org/html/17_2_urbanities-thomas_jefferson.html |title=Jefferson Versus the Muslim Pirates by Christopher Hitchens, City Journal Spring 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Robert Davis, from the 16th to 19th centuries, pirates captured 1 million to 1.25 million Europeans as slaves. These slaves were captured mainly from the crews of captured vessels&lt;ref&gt;Milton, G (2005) White Gold: The Extraordinary Story of Thomas Pellow And Islam's One Million White Slaves, Sceptre, London&lt;/ref&gt; and from coastal villages in [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]], and from farther places like [[Italy]], [[France]] or [[England]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Ireland]], the [[Azores Islands]], and even [[Turkish Abductions|Iceland]].&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

For a long time, until the early 18th century, the [[Crimean Khanate]] maintained a massive [[Slavery in the Ottoman Empire|slave trade]] with the Ottoman Empire and the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www2.econ.hit-u.ac.jp/~areastd/mediterranean/mw/pdf/18/10.pdf The Crimean Tatars and their Russian-Captive Slaves]" (PDF).

===Hungary===
The [[Böszörmény]] Muslims formed [[Islam in Hungary|an early community of Muslims in Hungary]]. Their biggest settlement was near the town of present-day [[Orosháza]] in the central part of the Hungarian Kingdom. At that time this settlement entirely populated by Muslims was probably one of the biggest settlements of the Kingdom. This and several other Muslim settlements were all destroyed and their inhabitants massacred during the 1241 Mongol invasion of Hungary.

In the mid-7th century AD, following the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]], Islam spread into areas that would [[Russo-Persian Wars|later]] become part of [[Russia]].&lt;ref name="et al 2004 3"&gt;{{cite book |quote= It is difficult to establish exactly when Islam first appeared in Russia because the lands that Islam penetrated early in its expansion were not part of Russia at the time, but were later incorporated into the expanding Russian Empire.

During his journey to [[Volga Bulgaria]] in 921-922, [[Ahmad ibn Fadlan | Ibn Fadlan]] observed the Rus', claiming that some had converted to Islam. "They are very fond of pork and many of them who have assumed the path of Islam miss it very much." The Rus' also relished their ''[[nabidh]]'', a fermented drink which Ibn Fadlan often mentioned as part of their daily fare.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.nordicway.com/search/Vikings%20in%20the%20East.htm Vikings in the East, Remarkable Eyewitness Accounts]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mongols]] began their [[Mongol invasion of Rus'| conquest of Rus']], of [[Mongol invasion of Volga Bulgaria |Volga Bulgaria]], and of the [[Cumania|Cuman-Kipchak Confederation]] (parts of present-day Russia and [[Ukraine]]) in the 13th century. After the Mongol empire split, the eastern European section became known as the [[Golden Horde]]. Although not originally Muslim, the western Mongols adopted Islam as their religion in the early-14th century under [[Berke Khan]], and later [[Uzbeg Khan]] established it as the official religion of the state. Much of the mostly Turkic-speaking population of the Horde, as well as the small Mongol aristocracy, became Islamized (if they were not already Muslim, like the Volga Bulgars) and became known to Russians and Europeans as the [[Tatars]]. More than half&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title= Encarta, Mongol Invasion of Russia |url= http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761569000_17/Russia.html |work= |archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/5kwrYIYiP?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761569000_17/Russia.html |archivedate= 2009-11-01 |deadurl= yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
of the European portion of what is now Russia and Ukraine came under the suzerainty of Muslim [[Tatars]] and [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] from the 13th to the 15th centuries. The [[Crimean Khanate]] became a vassal state of the Ottoman Empire in 1475 and subjugated what remained of the [[Great Horde]] by 1502. The Russian Tsar [[Ivan the Terrible]] conquered the Muslim [[Khanate of Kazan]] in 1552.

The [[Ottoman Empire]] began its [[Ottoman wars in Europe|expansion into Europe]] by taking the European portions of the Byzantine Empire in the 14th and 15th centuries up until the 1453 [[fall of Constantinople|capture of Constantinople]], establishing Islam as the state religion in the region. The Ottoman Empire continued to stretch northwards, taking [[Hungary]] in the 16th century, and reaching as far north as the [[Podolia]] in the mid-17th century ([[Peace of Buczacz]]), by which time most of the Balkans was under Ottoman control. Ottoman expansion in Europe ended with their defeat in the [[Great Turkish War]]. In the [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] (1699), the Ottoman Empire lost most of its conquests in [[Central Europe]]. The Crimean Khanate was later annexed by [[Russian Empire|Russia]] in 1783.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avalanchepress.com/Soldier_Khan.php|title=Avalanche Press|publisher=|accessdate=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the centuries, the Ottoman Empire gradually lost almost all of its European territories, until its collapse in 1922, when the former empire was transformed into the nation of [[Turkey]].{{fact|date=October 2017}}

Between 1354 (when the Ottomans crossed into Europe at [[Gallipoli]]) and 1526, the Empire had conquered the territory of present-day Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, Albania, Serbia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Bosnia, and Hungary. The Empire laid siege to [[Vienna]] in 1683. The intervention of the Polish King broke the siege, and from then afterwards the Ottomans battled the Habsburg Emperors until 1699, when the [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] forced them to surrender Hungary and portions of present-day Croatia, Slovenia, and Serbia. From 1699 to 1913, wars and insurrections pushed the Ottoman Empire further back until it reached the current European border of present-day Turkey.{{fact|date=October 2017}}

For most of this period, the Ottoman retreats were accompanied by Muslim refugees from these provinces (in almost all cases converts from the previous subject populations), leaving few Muslim inhabitants in Hungary, Croatia, and the Transylvania region of present-day Romania. Bulgaria remained under Ottoman rule until around 1878, and currently its population includes about 131,000 Muslims (2001 Census) (see [[Pomaks]]).

Bosnia was conquered by the Ottomans in 1463, and a large portion of the population converted to Islam in the first 200 years of Ottoman domination. By the time Austria-Hungary occupied Bosnia in 1878, the Habsburgs had shed the desire to re-Christianize new provinces. As a result, a sizable Muslim population in Bosnia survived into the 20th century. Albania and the Kosovo area remained under Ottoman rule until 1913. Prior to the Ottoman conquest, the northern Albanians were [[Roman Catholic]] and the southern Albanians were Christian Orthodox, but by 1913 the majority were Muslim.{{fact|date=October 2017}}

====Conversion to Islam====

Apart from the effect of a lengthy period under Ottoman domination, many of the subject population were converted to Islam as a result of a deliberate move by the Ottomans as part of a policy of ensuring the loyalty of the population against a potential Venetian invasion. However, Islam was spread by force in the areas under the control of the [[Ottoman Sultan]] through [[devşirme]] and [[jizya]].&lt;ref&gt;Basgoz, I. &amp; Wilson, H. E.

===Cultural influences===
{{Further information|Islamic contributions to Medieval Europe|Reception of Islam in Early Modern Europe}}
Islam piqued interest among European scholars, setting off the movement of [[Orientalism]]. The founder of modern Islamic studies in Europe was [[Ignác Goldziher]], who began studying Islam in the late 19th century. For instance, Sir [[Richard Francis Burton]], 19th-century English explorer, scholar, and orientalist, and translator of ''[[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights]]'', disguised himself as a Pashtun and visited both Medina and Mecca during the Hajj, as described in his book ''A Personal Narrative of a Pilgrimage to Al-Medinah and Meccah.''

[[Islamic architecture]] influenced European architecture in various ways (for example, the [[Türkischer Tempel]] synagogue in [[Vienna]]). During the 12th-century Renaissance in Europe, Latin translations of [[Islamic science|Arabic texts]] were introduced. The [[Koran]] was also translated (for example, [[Lex Mahumet pseudoprophete]]).

===Twentieth century===
Muslim emigration to metropolitan France surged during the [[Algerian War of Independence]].{{fact|date=October 2017}} In 1961, the West German Government invited first [[Gastarbeiter]]s and similar contracts were offered by Switzerland; some of these migrant workers came from majority-Muslim countries such as Turkey.{{fact|date=October 2017}} Migrants came to Britain from its majority-Muslim former colonies [[Pakistan]] and [[Bangladesh]].{{fact|date=October 2017}}

&lt;!-- According to the German {{ill|de|Central Institute Islam Archive|Zentralinstitut Islam-Archiv-Deutschland}}, the total number of Muslims in Europe in 2007 was about 38 million (5.2%),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pewforum.org/uploadedfiles/Topics/Demographics/Muslimpopulation.pdf, p. 25. Islam in Europe states 3.2% Muslims in European Union, but non-European Union countries (mainly Russia) have more Muslim residents so percents go to about 5.2%.&lt;/ref&gt; The total number of Muslims in the [[European Union]] in 2007 was about 16 million (3.2%).&lt;ref name="islam.de"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islam.de/8368.php|title=islam.de / Newsinternational / In Europa leben gegenwärtig knapp 53 Millionen Muslime|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;The exact number of Muslims in Europe is unknown. According to estimates by the [[Pew Forum]], the total number of Muslims in Europe (excluding Turkey) in 2010 was about 44 million (6% of the total population), including 19 million (3.8% of the population) in the [[European Union]].{{sfn|Pew 2011}}

===Projections===
[[File:Muslim pop Euro.JPG|thumb|right|According to the [[Pew Research Center]], Europe's population was 6% Muslim in 2010, and is projected to be 8% Muslim by 2030.{{sfn|Pew 2011}} (The data does not take into account pobulation movements from the Middle East and Africa since the [[European migrant crisis|migration crisis]].)]]

A [[Pew Research Center]] study, published in January 2011, forecast an increase of Muslims in European population from 6% in 2010 to 8% in 2030.{{sfn|Pew 2011}} The study also predicted that Muslim [[fertility rate]] in Europe would drop from 2.2 in 2010 to 2.0 in 2030. On the other hand, the non-Muslim fertility rate in Europe would increase from 1.5 in 2010 to 1.6 in 2030.{{sfn|Pew 2011}} Another Pew study published in 2017 projected that in 2050 Muslims will make 7.4% (if all migration into Europe were to immediately and permanently stop - a “zero migration” scenario) up to 14% (under a “high” migration scenario) of Europe's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2017/11/29/europes-growing-muslim-population/|title=Europes growing muslim-population - Pew Research Center|date=29 November 2017|work=Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data from the 2000s for the rates of growth of Islam in Europe showed that the growing number of Muslims was due primarily to immigration and higher [[birth rate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4385768.stm |title=Muslims in Europe: Country guide |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=2005-12-23 |accessdate=2010-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Pew projected that the Muslim population of Europe would reach a level between 7% and 14% by 2050. The projections depend on the level of migration. With no net migration, the projected level was 7%; with high migration, it was 14%. The projections varied greatly by country. Under the high migration scenario, the highest projected level of any historically non-Muslim country was 30% in [[Sweden]]. By contrast, [[Poland]] was projected to remain below 1%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/12/04/europes-muslim-population-will-continue-to-grow-but-how-much-depends-on-migration/|title=Europe’s Muslim population will continue to grow – but how much depends on migration|work=Pew Center|author=Michael Lipka|date=December 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the conservative Christian historian [[Philip Jenkins]], in an article for the [[Foreign Policy Research Institute]] thinktank, wrote that by 2100, a Muslim population of about 25% of Europe's population was "probable"; Jenkins stated this figure did not take account growing birthrates amongst Europe's immigrant Christians, but did not give details of his metholodogy.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Jenkins, "[http://deathandreligion.plamienok.sk/files/21-Demographics_Religion_and_the_Future_of_Europe.pdf Demographics, Religion, and the Future of Europe]", ''Orbis: A Journal of World Affairs'', vol. 50, no. 3, pp. 533, summer 2006&lt;/ref&gt; in 2010, [[Eric Kaufmann]], professor of politics at [[Birkbeck, University of London]] said that "In our projections for Western Europe by 2050 we are looking at a range of 10-15 per cent Muslim population for most of the high immigration countries – Germany, France, the UK";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/2267/battle-of-the-babies|title=Battle of the Babies - New Humanist|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; he argued that Islam was expanding, not because of conversion to Islam, but primarily due to the religion's “pro-natal” orientation, where Muslims tend to have more children.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Other analysts are skeptical about the accuracy of the claimed Muslim population growth, stating that because many European countries do not ask a person's religion on official forms or in censuses, it has been difficult to obtain accurate estimates, and arguing that there has been a decrease in Muslim fertility rates in [[Morocco]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;Mary Mederios Kent, ''[http://www.prb.org/Articles/2008/muslimsineurope.aspx?p=1 Do Muslims have more children than other women in western Europe?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081108085143/http://www.prb.org/Articles/2008/muslimsineurope.aspx?p=1|date=2008-11-08}}''[http://www.prb.org/Articles/2008/muslimsineurope.aspx][http://www.prb.org/Publications/Articles/2008/muslimsineurope.aspx], [[Population Reference Bureau]], February 2008, [[Simon Kuper]], ''[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/123ade02-4e6f-11dc-85e7-0000779fd2ac,print=yes.html Head count belies vision of ‘Eurabia’]'', [[Financial Times]], 19 August 2007, [[Doug Saunders]], ''[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080920.wreckoning20/BNStory/International/home/ The 'Eurabia' myth deserves a debunking]'' [http://dougsaunders.net/2008/09/eurabia-debunking-steyn-bawer-melanie-phillips-geert-wilders/][http://dougsaunders.tumblr.com/post/7999134091/debunking-the-eurabia-myth], [[The Globe and Mail]], 20 September 2008, ''[http://www.economist.com/node/18008022/print Islam and demography: A waxing crescent]'', [[The Economist]], 27 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2007 Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) report argued that some Muslim population projections may be overestimated, as they assume that all descendants of Muslims will become Muslims even in cases of mixed parenthood.&lt;ref&gt;Esther Pan, ''[http://www.cfr.org/publication/8252/europe.html Europe: Integrating Islam]'', [[Council on Foreign Relations]], 2005-07-13&lt;/ref&gt; Equally, Darren E. Sherkat questioned in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' whether some of the Muslim growth projections are accurate as they do not take into account the increasing number of non-religious Muslims. Quantitative research is lacking, but he believes the European trend mirrors the American: data from the General Social Survey in the United States show that 32 percent of those raised Muslim no longer embrace Islam in adulthood, and 18 percent hold no religious identification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/2015-06-22/losing-their-religion|title=Losing Their Religion|last=|first=|date=17 August 2015|website=Foreign Affairs|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As opposed to politicians and intellectuals, people perceive Islamic dress to not represent religious symbols but a repressive ideology in the form of [[islamism]] which intends to extend its influence into family, society and politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bazonline.ch/news/standard/die-zwangsjacke-namens-burka/story/15893262|title=Die Zwangsjacke namens Burka|work=baz.ch/|access-date=2018-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fundamentalism ===
A 2013 study by [[Wissenschaftszentrum Berlin für Sozialforschung]] (WZB) found that [[Islamic fundamentalism]] was widespread among Muslims in Europe. The study conducted a poll among Turkish immgrants to six European countries: Germany, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria and Sweden. In the first four countries also Moroccan immigrants were interviewed.&lt;ref name="fundamentalism"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://bibliothek.wzb.eu/pdf/2014/vi14-101.pdf|title=Religious fundamentalism and out-group hostility among Muslims and Christians in Western Europe|last=Koopmans|first=Ruud|publisher=WZB Berlin Social Science Center|year=March 2014|isbn=|location=|pages=7, 11, 15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150108011413/https://bibliothek.wzb.eu/pdf/2014/vi14-101.pdf|archive-date=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fundametalism was defined as: the belief that believers should return to the eternal and unchangeable rules laid down in the past; that these rules allow only one interpretation and are binding for all believers; and that religious rules have priority over secular laws. Two thirds of Muslims the majority responded that religious rules are more important than civil laws and three quarters rejecting religious pluralism within Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wzb.eu/en/press-release/islamic-fundamentalism-is-widely-spread|title=Islamic fundamentalism is widely spread|date=December 9, 2013|publisher=Wissenschaftszentrum Berlin für Sozialforschung}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the respondents, 44% agreed to all three statements. Almost 60% responded that Muslims should return to the roots of Islam, 75% thought there was only one possible interpretation of the Quran.&lt;ref name="fundamentalism" /&gt;

The conclusion was that religious fundamentalism is much more prevalent among European Muslims than among Christian natives. Perceived discrimination is a marginal predictor of religious fundamentalism.&lt;ref name="fundamentalism" /&gt; The difference between countries defies a "reactive religious fundamentalism", where fundamentalism is viewed as a reaction against lacking rights and privileges for Muslims. Instead, it was found that Belgium which has comparatively generous policies towards Muslims and immigrants in general also had a relatively high level of fundamentalism. France and Germany which have restricitive policies had lower levels of fundamentalism.&lt;ref name="fundamentalism" /&gt;

In 2017, the EU Counter-terrorism Coordinator [[Gilles de Kerchove]] stated in an interview that there were more than {{Val|50000}} radicals and jihadists in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.elmundo.es/espana/2017/08/31/59a70a48ca4741f7588b45e4.html|title=El coordinador antiterrorista de la UE: "Lo de Barcelona volverá a pasar, hay 50.000 radicales en Europa"|work=ELMUNDO|access-date=2018-08-24|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, French authorities stated that {{Val|15000}} of the {{Val|20000}} individuals on the [[Fiche "S"|list of security threats]] belong to [[Islamism|islamist movements]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2016/09/12/qui-sont-les-15-000-personnes-suivies-pour-radicalisation_4996528_4355770.html|title=Qui sont les 15 000 personnes « suivies pour radicalisation » ?|work=Le Monde.fr|access-date=2018-08-24|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, authorities estimate that {{Val|23000}} jihadists reside in the country, of which about 3000 are actively monitored.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/huge-scale-of-terror-threat-revealed-uk-home-to-23-000-jihadists-3zvn58mhq|title=Huge scale of terror threat revealed: UK home to 23,000 jihadists|last=Gabriella Swerling|first=Sean O’Neill, Fiona Hamilton, Fariha Karim|date=2017-05-27|work=The Times|access-date=2018-08-24|language=en|issn=0140-0460}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, German authorities estimated that there were more than {{Val|10000}} militant salafists in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.focus.de/politik/deutschland/gewaltbereite-islamisten-erstmals-mehr-als-10-000-salafisten-in-deutschland_id_6863813.html|title=Gewaltbereite Islamisten: Erstmals mehr als 10.000 Salafisten in Deutschland|last=Online|first=FOCUS|work=FOCUS Online|access-date=2018-08-24|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attitudes towards Muslims===
 {{Islamophobia}} {{see also|Islamophobia|Criticism of Islam}}
The [[European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia]] reports that the Muslim population tends to suffer [[Islamophobia]] all over Europe, although the perceptions and views of Muslims may vary.&lt;ref&gt;European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (2006): [http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/156-Manifestations_EN.pdf Muslims in the European Union. Discrimination and Islamophobia] Retrieved September 25, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 according to the ''Sociaal en Cultureel Planbureau'' annual report, half the Dutch population and half the Moroccan and Turkish minorities stated that the Western lifestyle cannot be reconciled with that of Muslims.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scp.nl/Publicaties/Alle_publicaties/Publicaties_2005/Jaarrapport_Integratie_2005|title=Jaarrapport Integratie 2005 - SCP Summary|last=|first=|date=|website=www.scp.nl|page=1-2|language=nl|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 poll by the [[Poland|Polish]] [[Centre for Public Opinion Research]] found that 44% of Poles have a [[Islam in Poland|negative attitude]] towards Muslims, with only 23% having a positive attitude towards them. Furthermore, a majority agreed with statements like "Muslims are intolerant of customs and values other than their own." (64% agreed, 12% disagreed), "Muslims living in Western European countries generally do not acquire customs and values that are characteristic for the majority of the population of that country." (63% agreed, 14% disagreed), "Islam encourages violence more than other religions." (51% agreed, 24% disagreed).&lt;ref name="2015 CBOS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cbos.pl/SPISKOM.POL/2015/K_037_15.PDF |title=Postawy wobec Islamu i Muzułmanów |date=March 2015 |publisher= CBOS |work=Michał Feliksiak|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A February 2017 poll of 10 000 people in 10 Eurpean countries by [[Chatham House]] found on average a majority were opposed to further Muslim immigration, with opposition especially pronounced in Austria, Poland, Hungary, France and Belgium. Of the respondents, 55% were opposed, 20% offered no opinion and 25% were in favour of further immigration from [[Muslim world|Muslim-majority countries]]. The authors of the study add that these countries, except Poland, had in the preceding years suffered jihadist terror attacks or been at the centre of a refugee crisis.  They also mention that in most of the polled countries the radical right has political influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.chathamhouse.org/expert/comment/what-do-europeans-think-about-muslim-immigration|title=What Do Europeans Think About Muslim Immigration?|work=Chatham House|access-date=2018-09-28|language=en|quote=With the exception of Poland, these countries have either been at the centre of the refugee crisis or experienced terrorist attacks in recent years.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a study in 2018 by [[Leipzig University]], 56% of Germans sometimes thought the many Muslims made them feel like strangers in their own country, up from 43% in 2014. In 2018, 44% thought immigration by Muslims should be banned, up from 37% in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/auslaenderfeindlichkeit-muslime-studie-rechtsextremismus-1.4199261|title=Die Deutschen werden immer intoleranter|last=Lipkowski|first=Clara|date=2018-11-07|work=sueddeutsche.de|access-date=2018-11-17|last2=(Grafik)|first2=Markus C.

=== Employment ===
According to a [[WZB Berlin Social Science Center|WZB]] report investigating Muslims in Germany, France, the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Belgium and Switzerland, Muslims in Europe generally have higher levels of unemployment which is to a great part caused by the lack of language skills, the lack of inter-ethnic social ties and a traditional view of gender roles where women are not to work outside the home. Discrimination from employers caused a small part of the unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wzb.eu/en/node/42814|title=Muslime auf dem Arbeitsmarkt {{!}} WZB|website=www.wzb.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Islam in the Cook Islands''' is a small religious minority in the [[New Zealand]] dependency of the [[Cook Islands]]. It's not exaclty clear how many Muslims are there in the Cook Islands, because the calculation of Muslims doesn't participate in the country census.&lt;ref name=republika&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.republika.co.id/berita/dunia-islam/islam-mancanegara/13/03/04/mj406p-ranumnya-islam-di-cook-islands | title=Ranumnya Islam di Cook Islands | language=Indonesian | accessdate=August 13, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it's estimated that about 0.06% of the Islands' population of about 15000 is Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ijesd.org/papers/30-D439.pdf Muslim population in Oceania: 1950-2020]&lt;/ref&gt; But there are no mosques in the Islands.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8729">'''Jesse Bushyhead''' (1804–1844) was a [[Cherokee]] religious and political leader, and a Baptist minister.&lt;ref&gt;Balmer, Randall Herbert, 2004, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vjwly0QyeU4C ''Encyclopedia of Evangelicalism''], Baylor University Press, {{ISBN|1-932792-04-X}}, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; He was born near the present-day town of [[Cleveland, Tennessee]]. His Cherokee name was ''Unaduti''.&lt;ref name="COO-JBushyhead"&gt;[http://digital.library.okstate.edu/chronicles/v009/v009p043.html Foreman, Carolyn Ross. "Aunt Eliza of Tahlequah." ''Chronicles of Oklahoma''. Vol. 9, No. 1 (March, 1931).] Retrieved June 19, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a young man, he was ordained a [[Baptist minister]]. 

A member of the [[John Ross (Cherokee chief)|John Ross]] faction of the Cherokee, he was dispatched by Ross in 1837 on a mission to the [[Seminole]]. Although Bushyhead opposed the federal policy forcing [[Indian Removal]] to west of the Mississippi River, he accepted the inevitable and led a party of about 1,000 people on the [[Trail of Tears]]. On his arrival in 1839 near present-day [[Westville, Oklahoma]], he established the Baptist Mission. This marked the end of the Cherokee Trail of Tears. He became chief justice of the Cherokee nation in 1840 and remained in that office until his death. His eldest son, [[Dennis Bushyhead]], held several offices in the [[Cherokee Nation (19th century)|Cherokee Nation]], including as [[Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation|Principal Chief]]. He served from 1879 to 1887.

==Early life==
Jesse Bushyhead was born in September 1804 to a half-blood Cherokee woman named Nancy Foreman in a Cherokee settlement near the present city of [[Cleveland, Tennessee]]. His father was also of [[mixed-race]] Cherokee ancestry. He was educated at Candy's Creek Mission, and taught at several schools for boys in the Candy's Creek area.&lt;ref name="COO-Routh"&gt;Routh, E. C. [http://digital.library.okstate.edu/chronicles/v015/v015p449.html "Early Missionaries to the Cherokees."] ''Chronicles of Oklahoma''. Vol. 15, No. 4. Retrieved July 20, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career as a missionary==
Bushyhead was baptized as a Christian and became an avid member of the Baptist church in 1830. He began converting other Cherokee to Christianity, established a church at Amohee in Tennessee (then his home town), and became a close associate of noted Baptist missionary, Reverend [[Evan Jones (missionary)|Evan Jones]]. Jones preached in English, while Bushyhead translated the sermon into Cherokee. One writer claimed that Bushyhead was, "... the best interpreter in the nation." &lt;ref name="COO-JBushyhead"/&gt;

In 1832, Reverend  Jones recommended to the Baptist Board of Foreign Missions that Bushyhead be appointed as an assistant missionary. The appointment was made, and Bushyhead served in this role for the next eleven years. He is said to have been the first Cherokee to have been ordained as a Baptist minister. He continued to work closely with Jones, not only preaching to the Cherokees, but translating the Book of Genesis and other religious books into the Cherokee language, using the Cherokee Syllabary. He also served as pastor of the Amohee church.&lt;ref name="FOF"&gt;[http://www.fofweb.com/History/MainPrintPage.asp?iPin=ind1247&amp;DataType=Indian&amp;WinType=Free Hirschfelder, Arlene, and Paulette Molin.

==Family life==
Jesse Bushyhead married twice. He had two children with his first wife, whose name is apparently unknown. His second wife was Eliza Wilkerson or Wilkinson, who bore nine children.&lt;ref name="COO-JBushyhead"/&gt; His oldest son, [[Dennis Bushyhead]], was notable for serving as Principal Chief for two terms, from 1879 to 1887.&lt;ref name="FOF"/&gt; His home in Cleveland is now occupied by [[Cleveland High School (Tennessee)|Cleveland High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rozema|first=Vicki|date=1995|title=Footsteps of the Cherokees, 2nd.

Blair Publisher|page=94|isbn=0895871335|author-link=Vicki Rozemo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Removal to Indian Territory==
Jesse Bushyhead had opposed removal of the Cherokees from their homeland in the Southeast. As the deadline approached when General Winfield Scott  and the U.S. Army would escort the people to a new homeland in the Indian Territory, Rev. Bushyhead volunteered to lead one of the groups of emigres.  The group who followed him was from a part of the nation where there was no capable leader.&lt;ref name="COO-JBushyhead"/&gt;

The group led by Bushyhead followed the same northern route taken by the group led by Evan Jones. The route led them north through Tennessee and Kentucky to an Ohio River crossing at Golconda, Illinois, then west to cross the Mississippi River near Cape Girardeau, Missouri. After that, they turned southwest to Indian Territory.&lt;ref name="COO-JBushyhead"/&gt;  At the start of the trek, the group numbered 950 people. During the journey, the group experienced 38 deaths and 6 births, so that 898 arrived safely at their destination on February 23, 1838.&lt;ref name="COO-Routh"/&gt;

The trek terminated at a place Bushyhead called Pleasant Hill, about {{convert|4|mi|km}} north of the present day town of [[Westville, Oklahoma]] and about {{convert|70|mi|km}} from [[Fort Smith, Arkansas]]. The Cherokees called the place "Breadtown" because food rations were distributed there. Later, they named the place "Baptist Mission."&lt;ref name="COO-Routh"/&gt;

==Death and burial ==
Jesse Bushyhead died on July 17, 1844 after a brief, but unspecified illness. He was buried at the old Baptist Mission cemetery near Westville

Jesse Bushyhead's grave at the Baptist Mission Cemetery is marked by a {{convert|15|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} marble monument. His grave is the only surviving property associated with his life, and as such is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

One side of the monument reads: "Sacred to the memory of Rev. Jesse Bushyhead, born in the old Cherokee Nation in East Tennessee, September, 1804; died in the present Cherokee Nation, July 17, 1844. 'Well done, thou good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things. Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.'" An inscription in Cherokee is at the bottom.&lt;ref name="COO-Routh"/&gt;

The other side of the monument bears the following inscription:
"Rev. Jesse Bushyhead was a man noble in person and noble in heart. His choice was to be a true and faithful minister of his Lord and Master rather than any high and worldly position. He loved his country and people, serving them from time to time in many important offices and missions. He united with the Baptist Church in his early manhood and died as he had lived, a devoted Christian."&lt;ref name="COO-Routh"/&gt;

'''Lac Ste. Anne''' is a large [[lake]] in central [[Alberta]], Canada. It is located in [[Lac Ste. Anne County]], along [[Alberta Highway 43|Highway 43]], 75&amp;nbsp;km west of [[Edmonton]].

The lake has a total area of 54.5&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, a maximum depth of 9 m, and an average depth of 4.8 m.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sunsite.ualberta.ca/Projects/Alberta-Lakes/view/?region=North%20Saskatchewan%20Region&amp;basin=North%20Saskatchewan%20River%20Basin&amp;lake=Lac%20Ste.%20Anne&amp;number=82 Atlas of Alberta Lakes] - Lac Ste. Anne&lt;/ref&gt; Lac Ste. Anne lies at an elevation of 730 m, and has a drainage area of 619&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The eutrophic lake is formed along the [[Sturgeon River (Alberta)|Sturgeon River]] through which it drains into the [[North Saskatchewan River]]. Two islands are found at the western end of the lake, ''Farming Island'' and ''Horse Island'', while the small ''Castle Island'' and tiny ''Rock Island'' lie at the eastern tip of the lake.

Along the southern area coal mines generate power and employment, and recreational businesses have flourished because of the lakes. Agriculture is still a mainstay and the area is known for some of the best oat crops in Canada.

==History==

Lac Ste. Anne was first called ''Wakamne'', or God's Lake by the Nakota Sioux, and ''Manitou Sakhahigan'' (Lake of the Spirit) by the [[Cree]] [[first nations]] before the arrival of the settlers.

The legend goes that the Indians hunted buffalo and fished in the lake called Manitou Sakhahigan. The legend told of a large monster that lived in the lake, and as it moved it would create dangerous and unpredictable currents, which could easily capsize a canoe. Very few people saw the monster but when the Hudson's Bay Company came they renamed the lake Devil's Lake&lt;ref name="Oblates in the West"/&gt; possibly in reference to the reported lake monster.

Elders of Alexis Reserve remember their grandparents telling of how as children they would go out on the lake and peer down through the then clear water to the lake bottom in search of the monster. They would hope and fear that they might actually see its legendary form.

===Lac Ste. Anne Mission===
[[File:JeanBaptisteThibault.jpg|thumb|right|140px|Jean-Baptiste Thibault founder of the Lac Ste. Anne Mission]]
The [[Lac Ste. Anne, Alberta|village of Lac Ste. Anne]] is one of the first permanent settlements in Alberta and the first permanent Catholic mission.
Lac Ste. Anne (then called Devil's Lake or Manito-Sakahigan) was visited by Father [[Jean-Baptiste Thibault]] in 1842. Two year later in 1844 he established the Mission of Lac Ste. Anne to serve 30 French Métis families, who had settled there in the 1830s,&lt;ref name="National Historic Site"/&gt; and the native population of the area.&lt;ref name="Oblates in the West"&gt;{{cite web

| url =https://familysearch.org/learn/wiki/en/Alberta_Church_Records_(National_Institute)
| date = 
| accessdate =2014-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also renamed the lake ''Lac Ste. Anne'', honouring [[Saint Anne]]. Lac Ste. Anne was in a central location with good fertile fields, tall trees for lumber, and plenty of fish and wildlife. It was also far enough away from the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] politics in [[Fort Edmonton]].

The missionaries began the teachings of the Church, and also taught the people how to farm. They had predicted the demise of the buffalo and strove to make the [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] people self-sufficient. By 1859 the mission boasted 17 fat and fine cows, 15 horses, 10 dogs, 10 cats, and a garden with flowerbeds. Pigs and sheep were not raised because of the dogs and wild predators. Crops included wheat, barley, potatoes, cabbage, onions, and turnips.

In 1859 three [[Grey Nuns]] made the journey from Montreal to the Mission.&lt;ref name="Oblates in the West"/&gt; They were the third, fourth and fifth white women to travel to Alberta. On September 24 Lac Ste. Anne welcomed these brave women with enough mud to bog down their wagon at the entrance to the Mission. The Sisters began their lives here by learning the Cree language, starting a school, helping in the gardens and painting the windows of the church so that worshippers would not be distracted  during services.

The Mission grew until there were over two thousand people. A Hudson's Bay Company post, a separate school, an orphanage retreat, a [[North-West Mounted Police]] barracks, a dance hall, a post office,  several stores, saloons and hotels moved into the area complimenting the church, rectory and convent.

At one time the mission was larger in population and commerce than Fort Edmonton.

[[Albert Lacombe|Father Lacombe]], who arrived in 1852,&lt;ref name="Oblates in the West"/&gt; was a priest with vision and a great deal of  common sense. In 1861 he decided for many sound reasons to build a new mission at [[St. Albert, Alberta|St. Albert]].&lt;ref name="Oblates in the West"/&gt; When he left the mission of Lac Ste. Anne was almost deserted by pastors and flock. All that was left were a few homes, the church, the rectory and the Grey Nun's residence.

===Lac Ste. Anne Pilgrimage===

Father Lestanc organised the first pilgrimage to Lac Ste. Anne in 1889 in honour of Saint Anne whose feast day is on July 26.&lt;ref name="National Historic Site"&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/APPS/CP-NR/release_e.asp?bgid=922&amp;andor1=bg  | title= Lac Ste. Anne Pilgrimage National Historic Site of Canada | author= Parks Canada | authorlink= Parks Canada |date=February 2005 | accessdate= 2014-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926 over 5,500 pilgrims attended. Many came by a special train from the city of [[Edmonton]] 45 miles away.&lt;ref name="LSAP History"&gt;{{cite web
| title =Lac Ste. Anne Pilgrimage History
| url =http://lsap.ca/history.htm
| date = 
| accessdate =2014-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today pilgrims come to the lake from all over North America, many walking miles bare-footed as penance to witness or be a part of the miracle of healing. A display of crutches and canes have been left behind in the shrine by pilgrims.
Thirty to forty thousand people now attend the annual pilgrimage in the last week of July.&lt;ref name="National Historic Site"/&gt; Oaths of sobriety, along with other life style promises are made, and prayers and forgiveness are given.

The ''Lac Ste. Anne Pilgrimage'' was declared a [[List of national historic sites of Canada|National Historic Site]] of [[Canada]] in 2004 for its social and cultural importance.&lt;ref name="National Historic Site"/&gt;

{{quote|Lac Ste. Anne Pilgrimage is a site of national historic significance because as early as 1889, Aboriginal people, including Cree, Dene, Blackfoot and Métis, have been coming to Lac Ste. Anne to celebrate the Feast of Saint Anne. Saint Anne embodies, for many Aboriginal peoples, the traditional importance of the grandmother figure. For the Aboriginal people of Western and Northwestern Canada, the pilgrimage site is an important place of social, cultural and spiritual rejuvenation, which are important aspects of the traditional summer gathering.|Parks Canada&lt;ref name="National Historic Site"/&gt;}}

===Alberta Beach===

Several miles east, Lac Ste. Anne was the hostess of more history. In 1912 the Alberta Northern Rail built the railroad to what is now [[Alberta Beach, Alberta|Alberta Beach]], it brought its employees out for company picnics and holidays. By 1920 they had incorporated the area as a summer village,&lt;ref name=SVincorp&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.albertasummervillages.org/ | title=The History of Summer Villages | publisher=The Association of Summer Villages of Alberta | accessdate= 2007-08-31| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070929135612/http://www.albertasummervillages.org/| archivedate= 29 September 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; built a dance pavilion, a large wooden pier, and several cabins. Other companies such as Marshall Wells and Woodwards then began to bring their employees out for the same relaxing and beautiful atmosphere.

There was such a demand for this atmosphere that the Moonlight express was started. A.N.R. picked people up in Edmonton on Saturday mornings, took them to [[Alberta Beach, Alberta|Alberta Beach]]., then picked them up Sunday night to take them back to Edmonton.

Soon people began purchasing and building their own cabins and small businesses. On January 1, 1999, the Summer Village of Alberta Beach became a village.&lt;ref name=villageincorp&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.municipalaffairs.alberta.ca/cfml/pdf_search/pdf/VILG/0004/Alberta_Beach_OC_490_1998_No1.pdf | title=Order in Council (O.C.) 490/98 | publisher=Province of Alberta | date=1998-11-25 | accessdate=2011-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It now has 884 year-round residents and can swell to over 3,000 people during long weekends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.albertabeach.com/ | title=Welcome to Alberta Beach | publisher=Alberta Beach | accessdate=2011-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; A hotel and many small businesses operate within the village. Alberta Beach has developed in many ways while still preserving the reason for its popularity. The tranquility and beauty of the lake still draw admiration and provides relaxation to those who come to enjoy the area.

===Hamlet of Gunn===

In the 1900s the Hamlet of Gunn (named after [[Peter Gunn (politician)|Peter Gunn]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Place-names of Alberta|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015070267029;view=1up;seq=64|year=1928|publisher=Geographic Board of Canada.|location=Ottawa|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; was also developing as a major trade center, consisting mainly of Métis and Indian people. There were two flour mills, a blacksmith shop, the hotel, several stores and trading posts that nestled beside the train station. In the 1930s an Army training center was built where the Gunn housing center now operates. Prosperity reigned until the Army left and the C.N.R. removed its rail station. With it, many of the residents and businesses also left.

Today all that remains is a combination store, laundromat, restaurant, car wash and a Post Office, Community hall and University observation and research station, as well as the Gunn Housing and Senior's Center.

===Castle Island===

A French Viscount  by the name of Charles de Caze, In the 1890s began building a castle on the small island located on the northeast shores of  Lac Ste. Anne, which he named Constance Island, in honor of his only daughter. The castle was to be four stories high, built of stone. The walls were to be three feet thick crowning it was to be a stone battlement running all the way around.

The castle was to be his retirement home but unfortunately he died at the age of 44 and did not complete his project. For many years, only the two stories of his dream castle remained to pique the curiosity of people stopping to picnic and enjoy the panoramic view of the lake.

Approximately twenty years later a Mr. Shorty purchased the Island. He demolished the castle and transported several cabins to Constance Island. During prohibition it was an excellent spot for parties and fun. Years later he built a causeway which provided better access to the island. Eventually the Island was sold, renamed Castle Island, subdivided, and incorporated into a summer village.

===Darwell===

A rail station in 1912 also created the community of Darwell, located between Lac Ste. Anne and Isle Lake. The naming of this station caused many debates with no resolution, until an enterprising man took out his hymnbook and randomly picked a good tune. The tune had the name Darwell in it.

It also became known throughout Alberta as Hobo stop because of a ranch which never turned away anyone asking for shelter. Many a man out of work rode the rail to Darwell to get food and lodging in exchange for work. As the story goes many a man wanted by the law also found refuge and the North-West Mounted Police spent many a trip going to the Hobo Ranch.

Today Darwell boasts a store, garage, and school. The old ranch has long disappeared, but the hospitality of this community still exists today.

==Communities==

The [[Alexis Nakota Sioux First Nation|Alexis Indian Reserve]] of the Alexis [[Nakoda (people)|Nakoda]] Nation is located on the northern shore of the lake, and [[Alberta Beach, Alberta|Alberta Beach]] is located on the southeastern shore.  The Summer Villages of [[Ross Haven, Alberta|Ross Haven]] and [[Yellowstone, Alberta|Yellowstone]], along with the subdivision of Corsair Cove, and the unincorporated hamlet of [[Gunn, Alberta|Gunn]] lie along the northern shore.  The Summer Villages of [[Castle Island, Alberta|Castle Island]], [[Sunset Point, Alberta|Sunset Point]] and [[Val Quentin, Alberta|Val Quentin]] lie to either side of Alberta Beach.  The Summer Village of [[West Cove, Alberta|West Cove]] lies on the southern shore of the west basin.

==Recreation==
Two campgrounds are located around the lake, one at Alberta Beach and the other at [[Gunn, Alberta|Gunn]], on the north-eastern shore. There are also two golf courses in the immediate area, one at Alberta Beach, and the other in Ross Haven.  There are two Bible Camps with lakefront property on Lac Ste. Anne, Ross Haven Bible Camp, located in Ross Haven, and run by the Canadian Sunday School Mission, and Sunset Point Christian Camp, in Sunset Point, and run by the Alberta Pentecostal Missions Society.

Fishing is a popular recreational activity, species including [[freshwater whitefish|whitefish]], [[northern pike]], [[walleye]] and [[yellow perch]].

Water based sports include [[sailing]], [[water skiing]] and [[windsurfing]] in summer and [[snowmobiling]] and [[cross-country skiing]] in winter.

The '''Last Gospel''' is the name given to the Prologue of [[Gospel of John|St. John's Gospel]] ([https://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Biblia_Sacra_Vulgata_(Stuttgartensia)/Ioannes John 1:1–14]) when read as part of the concluding rites in the [[Tridentine Mass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.sanctamissa.org/en/resources/books-1962/missale-romanum-1962.pdf|title=Missale Romanum|last=|first=|publisher=|year=1962|isbn=|edition=|location=|pages=327}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Prologue speaks on [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] as the [[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]] and on the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]].

==Description==
The Last Gospel began as a private devotional practice on the priest's part, but was gradually absorbed into the [[rubric]]s of the Mass.&lt;ref name=CathEnc&gt;[[Adrian Fortescue (priest)|Adrian Fortescue]] (1909).

He begins with the ''[[Dominus vobiscum]]'' as at the [[Gospel (liturgy)#Uses in the Western Churches|Proclamation of the Gospel]] during Mass; however, since he reads from an [[altar card]], he makes a [[Sign of the Cross]] with his right thumb on the altar's surface instead of the Gospel text, before signing his own forehead, lips, and chest. At the words "''Et Verbum caro factum est''" ("And the [[Logos (Christianity)|Word]] became flesh"), the priest (and, if present, the congregation) [[genuflect]]s.

The text of John's Gospel is perhaps best known for [[John 1:1|its opening]], ''"In principio erat Verbum, et Verbum erat apud Deum, et Deus erat Verbum'',"[https://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Biblia_Sacra_Vulgata_(Stuttgartensia)/Ioannes] which in most English translations has been rendered as "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(King_James)/John]

The third Mass of [[Christmas Day]], where this same Gospel is read as the Gospel of the Mass, has no Last Gospel; before 1954, the Gospel for the [[Feast of the Epiphany]] would be read here. Also, a superseded Mass, e.g. a Saint's feast superseded by a Sunday, could be commemorated by, among other things, having its Gospel as the Last Gospel.{{Citation needed|reason=No source supplied for this obscure practice.

'''''Love and Responsibility''''' is a book written by Karol Wojtyła before he became [[Pope John Paul II]] and was originally published in [[Polish language|Polish]] in 1960 and in English in 1981.&lt;ref name="Wojtyła"&gt;[[#Wojtyła69|Wojtyła, Karol. ''Love and Responsibility'']]: 1981&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Catholic"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic.org/featured/headline.php?ID=321 |title=How not to be used: Love and Responsibility – Catholic Online |publisher=www.catholic.org |accessdate=2009-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Summary"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christendom-awake.org/pages/may/summaryofl&amp;r.htm |title=A Summary of Karol Wojtyła's Love and Responsibility by William E. May |publisher=www.christendom-awake.org |accessdate=2009-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A new, completely updated and original translation was published in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Translated by Grzegorz Ignatik, published by Pauline Books &amp; Media, Boston, MA.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work consists of five chapters; "The Person and the Sexual Urge"; "The Person and Love"; "The Person and Chastity"; "Justice to the Creator"; and "Sexology and Ethics".&lt;ref name="Summary"/&gt;
It is described as 'a defence of the traditional Church teachings on marriage from a new philosophical standpoint'.&lt;ref name="Kuhiwczak"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polskieradio.pl/zagranica/news/artykul21561.html|title=A literary Pope|last=Kuhiwczak|first=Piotr (Dr.)|date=1 January 2007|work=Polish Radio |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208070732/http://www.polskieradio.pl/ |archivedate=February 8, 2008 |publisher= 2007,2009 Nowe Media, Polskie Radio S.A.|accessdate=2009-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his introduction to the first edition, Fr. Wojtyla describes his reasons for writing the book as being "born principally of the need to put the norms of Catholic sexual morality on a firm basis, a basis as definitive as possible, relying on the most elementary and incontrovertible moral truths and the most fundamental values or goods".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wojtyla|first=Karol|title=Love and Responsibility|year=1981|publisher=Ignatius Press|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-0-89870-445-7|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fr. Wojtyła was originally inspired to write the book while being a professor at the [[John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin|Catholic University of Lublin]],&lt;ref name="pp2bio"&gt;{{cite book | author = Weigel, George |title = Witness of Hope – The Biography of Pope John Paul II | publisher = HarperCollins | year = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; through the experiences he had in teaching young Catholics.

While at the university, Fr. Wojtyła gathered a group of about 20 young people, who began to call themselves ''‘Rodzinka’'', the "little family". They met for prayers, [[philosophy|philosophical]] discussions, and helping the blind and sick. The group eventually grew to approximately 200 participants, and their activities expanded to include annual [[skiing]] and [[kayak]]ing trips.&lt;ref name="USCCB_Bio"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usccb.org/about/leadership/holy-see/pope-john-paul-ii/pope-john-paul-ii-biography.cfm |title=Pope John Paul II: A Light for the World |accessdate=2011-10-23| publisher=United States Council of Catholic Bishops |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The insight he gained from these meetings and discussions helped him develop the raw material for the text.

[[Pope John Paul II|Fr. Wojtyła]] writes that marital [[sexual intercourse]] is the best image of God who is love, for he sees the human body as the only one capable of making the invisible — the spiritual and the divine — visible.&lt;ref name="Wojtyła"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karol Woytyla, Love and Responsibility, San Francisco, [[Ignatius Press]] 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Edward"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.holyspiritinteractive.net/columns/edwardpsri/loveandresponsibility/02.asp|title=Holy Spirit Interactive: Edward P. Sri – Love and Responsibility: The Battle for Purity |publisher=www.holyspiritinteractive.net|accessdate=2009-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He says that human beings were created by God for a purpose: to be persons who freely choose to love, to give themselves as persons who express their self-giving through their bodies. Thus, sexual intercourse between [[Marriage|husband and wife]] is a [[symbol]] of their total mutual self-donation, and further fosters, strengthens and enriches it not just for the present but also for the future.&lt;ref name="Wojtyła"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Edward"/&gt; For Fr.

[[File:Faroe stamp 391 gram and grani.jpg|thumb|Faroe stamp by [[Anker Eli Petersen]] depicting the magical sword [[Gram (mythology)|Gram]]]]
A '''magic sword''' is any [[mythology|mythological]] or [[fiction]]al [[sword]] imbued with [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] power to increase it's strength or grant it other [[supernatural]] qualities.  The [[archetype]] originated in [[mythology|myth]] and [[legend]], and occurs regularly in [[fantasy fiction]].

Renowned swords appear in the folklore of every nation that used swords.&lt;ref name="once"&gt;[[Josepha Sherman]], ''Once upon a Galaxy'' p 113 {{ISBN|0-87483-387-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the sword is ascribed no powers of its own.  It is famous because it is the [[hero]]'s sword, or because of its origin, as when a god gives it to the hero.  Other swords keep their wielders safe or destroy their enemies.

A more localized motif is the sword that has been broken and must be reforged, commonly found in Northern Europe. Such a sword symbolizes the initial defeat and loss of honor of its wielder.  Subsequent victory and the restoration of honor is achieved by reforging it, either at the wielder's hand or that of his heir.&lt;ref name="once"/&gt;

==History==
It is probable that the roots of the sentient weapon myths stem from ancient peoples belief that sword making and metallurgy was in fact a magical process. Through the fires of the forge (''fire was also given spiritual connotations'') a [[ore|lump of earth]] was transformed into a shiny usable object that could be hammered into many shapes. Extending further from the transformation of ore into metal, the difficulty of actually obtaining a quality blade; which took intense concentration and [[swordsmithing|skill]] added to its esoteric qualities. While any [[blacksmith]] could manufacture a knife or an axehead only a swordsmith could create a high quality sword. The secrets of doing so were jealously guarded as well as formulas for alloys.

The skill necessary to forge a balanced blade - one which is not too brittle or too soft and able to hold a usefully sharp edge - in the age before automated machines, blast furnaces, and the knowledge of molecular chemistry made the creation of a sword seem almost miraculous. A few degrees too hot or too cold within a very limited temperature range, which could only be discerned by the glowing hue of a hot [[bar stock|billet]], could make or break a sword. A lack of expertise in knowing when and how to apply carbon and [[borax|flux]] and [[quench]] the blade could ruin weeks of work. Thus the swordsmith almost felt like he was one with his work, giving the process his complete devotion of concentration and thought.  This led to the belief that he was actually [[wiktionary:imbue|imbuing]] the blade with an essence of his spirit. In [[Japan]], the swordsmiths were so concerned with this belief that they would undergo [[ritual purification|purification rituals]] and [[meditation]] before even attempting to start a new blade, for fear that they might inadvertently create an evil sword.

The [[Vikings]] prized their swords above all other things, handing them down from generation to generation and giving them names.  The value of the blade was not only determined by its quality but also by how many battles that it was used in.  Polynesian people such as the [[Māori people|Māori]] also had comparable reverence for their weapons.  They believed a weapon contained a spiritual force called ''mana'' and that the weapon held the spirits of its maker, its line of owners and also stole the spirits of those it killed. These weapons where highly prized for their ''mana'' and cherished as heirlooms.  The [[Samurai]] of Japan believed that their swords had their own soul that could possess them. It was not the wielder but their swords that desired to kill; Samurai were just the instrument that the sword used to complete that task.  Since most of them were Buddhists (a religion that finds violence and murder abhorent), that train of thought gave them some peace of mind in their killing vocation.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Later, as the concept of [[demons]], spiritual possession, and [[elementals]] entered the realm of mythological themes, it was only a natural leap to attribute magical properties of the swords of folklore to indwelling spirits.
[[File:Ahimelech Giving the Sword of Goliath to David.jpg|thumb|''Ahimelech giving the sword of Goliath to David'', by [[Aert de Gelder]].]]
Magic swords may exhibit various degrees of sentience, from being merely influenced by the wielder to being able to think for itself or even control its owner.

==Biblical==
The [[Bible]] relates in the [[Book of Genesis]] how [[God]], seeking to deter [[Adam and Eve]] from returning to the [[Garden of Eden]], "placed at the east of the garden of Eden [[Cherubim]] and a [[flaming sword (mythology)|flaming sword]] which turned every way". By some accounts, the Cherubim are replaced with the [[Archangel Michael]], who wields a similar weapon.
[[King David]] was given the sword of the slain giant [[Goliath]] by the priest [[Ahimelech]], to which was attached extra-biblical mythology and traditions.
In the [[Book of Revelation]], Jesus is symbolically described wielding a double-edged sword that proceeds out from his mouth, in reference to the "sword of the spirit" which is the "word of truth".

==Mythological==

===Arthurian===
[[File:Excalibur the Sword, Howard Pyle 1902.jpg|thumb|"Excalibur the Sword" Illustration of Arthur receiving it from the Lady of the Lake, by [[Howard Pyle]] for ''The Story of King Arthur and his Knights''.]]
In the legend of [[King Arthur]], the king himself is related to two magical swords, in most variants.  The first is the [[Excalibur#Excalibur and the Sword in the Stone|Sword In the Stone]].  Only Arthur could draw it out, thereby proving that he is the rightful king.  In some tales, this is his only sword.  In most variants, this sword was then broken, and he receives from [[The Lady of the Lake]] a new sword called [[Excalibur]], arguably the most famous of magic swords. However, in other variants Excalibur itself is the sword in the stone. It is not clear from the various accounts of the Arthur legend whether Excalibur itself was possessed of magical powers or merely had a magical origin, though its [[scabbard]] protected its bearer from physical harm. Many interpretations of the legend appear to endow Excalibur with a cutting strength and durability beyond that of ordinary weapons.

In Wolfram Von Echenbach's [[Parzival]], the eponymous hero is given a sword by the Grail king, Anfortas. Parzival's cousin explains that "“The sword will withstand the first blow unscathed; at the second it will shatter. If you then take it back to the spring, it will become whole again from the flow of the water. You must have the water at the source…If the pieces are not lost and you fit them together properly, as soon as the spring water wets them, the sword will become whole again, the joinings and edges stronger than before.”

===Chinese===
Ancient [[Chinese mythology]] relates the tale of [[Lü Dongbin]], who "slew [[dragons]]" with a magic sword and performed "freak feats" with it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinapage.com/8-immortal.html Eight Immortals in Chinese Mythology&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050428082953/http://www.chinapage.com/8-immortal.html |date=2005-04-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germanic===
[[File:Sigmunds Schwert (1889) by Johannes Gehrts.jpg|thumb|right|"Sigmund's Sword" (1889) by Johannes Gehrts.]]
In [[Norse mythology]], the god [[Frey]] "possessed a magic sword that struck out at [[Jötunn|Jotuns]] of its own accord". Many other swords appear in Norse legend in the hands of heroes.

[[Tyrfing]] appears in the ''[[Hervarar Saga]]''. [[Svafrlami]] was the King of [[Gardariki]], and a grandson of the god [[Odin]]. He caught the [[norse dwarves|dwarves]], [[Dvalin]] and [[Durin (Norse mythology)|Durin]], and forced them to forge a sword with a golden [[hilt]] that would never miss a stroke, would never [[rust]] and would cut through stone and iron as easily as through clothes. The dwarves made the sword, and it shone and gleamed like fire. However, in revenge they cursed it so that it would kill a man every time it was used and that it would be the cause of three great evils. They also cursed it so that it would kill Svafrlami himself. It would cost the life of not only Svafrlami, but also the life of the [[Sweden|Swedish]] hero [[Hjalmar]].

A similar sword to Tyrfing is [[Dáinsleif]], a sword from the legend of the eternal battle [[Hjaðningavíg]], made by the [[Norse Dwarves|dwarf]] [[Dwarf (Germanic mythology)|Dáin]]. Like Tyrfing, Dainsleif gave wounds that never healed and could not be unsheathed without killing a man.   There is also [[Mistilteinn]], a sword from the ''[[Hrómundar saga Gripssonar]]'', which could never go blunt and which [[Hrómundar saga Gripssonar|Hrómund]] won from the [[undead]] witch-king [[Þrainn]]. Like Tyrfing, it was taken from a [[barrow-wight]].

The various iterations of the story of the [[Völsungasaga|Völsungs]] include several magic swords.  The first magical sword which enters the story is [[Gram (mythology)|Gram]] (="wrath"), stuck by [[Odin]] into the tree [[Barnstokkr]] in the hall of the Völsungs. Only [[Sigmund]] could pull it out. This caused considerable envy and conflict. Eventually, Sigmund fought Odin disguised as an old man, and Odin shattered the sword. Sigmund left it for his son [[Sigurd]], who reforged it to kill [[Fafnir]].  In the [[Nibelungenlied]], Sîfrit (the [[Middle High German]] version of "[[Siegfried]]," the equivalent to Norse Sigurd) discarded Gram in exchange for another magic sword, Balmung (= "destruction").  [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s version of the story calls the sword Nothung ("child of necessity/distress"), rather than Balmung.

The legendary smith [[Wayland Smith]] forged the magic sword [[Mimung]], which appears both in the Anglo-Saxon poem [[Waldere]] and in the German/Scandinavian ''[[Þiðrekssaga]]''.

[[Beowulf]] wielded the sword [[Hrunting]] that was according to the poem annealed in venom. The sword was useless against [[Grendel's Mother]]. In desperation Beowulf grabbed a giant sword of great age and with it took off the head of the she monster.

===Japanese===
In [[Japanese mythology]], there is a magical sword called [[Kusanagi]], which was one of the three crown jewels given to the [[Emperor Jimmu]] by the goddess [[Amaterasu]].  Additionally, the [[katana]] forged by [[Masamune]] and [[Muramasa]] were reputedly of such high quality as to be near-magical.  In the case of the Masamune and Muramasa blades, it was believed that [[Masamune#Legends of Masamune and Muramasa|some element of the smith's personality was imputed into the blade]].  These three swords have been used extensively in popular culture since then, especially in the realm of video game [[Role-playing game|RPG]]s. Despite legends about Nihontō, those three are the most famous. Excellent japanese swords often received nicknames reflecting their cutting prowess. Also, unlike other magical swords, they exist (or still exist). There is, for example, 10 or 11 blades attributed to Masamune who still exist today, such as Kanze Masamune, Kotegiri Masamune or Musashi Masamune.

===Spanish===
More pragmatical, Spanish legends talk too about magical swords. Two belonged to the warrior [[El Cid|Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar, "El Cid"]], both with magical powers according to the medieval epical poem "Cantar del mio Cid". The First "Tizona" has personality of its own, with variable strength according to the man who used it, and even his sight was powerful, as it is stated in the "Cantar del mio Cid":

''Él dexó la lança, e mano al espada metió; (He left aside the spear, and took the sword)
cuando lo vio Ferrán Gonçález, conuvo [reconoció] a Tizón, (When Ferrán González saw it, he recognized Tizón) 
antes qu'el colpe esperasse dixo: —¡Vençudo só!— (And before the first strike, he said: I am lost)
Cantar de mio Cid, versos 3642–3645. Edición de Montaner Frutos (2011:213-214).''

The same is the case for "Colada" which was powerful only in the hands of a brave warrior.

===France===
In the [[Matter of France]], [[Roland]] possessed an indestructible sword, [[Durendal]], which he threw into a poisoned stream to prevent its capture.  Durendal was one of a set of three swords supposedly forged by Wayland and provided as ransom for a Norse captive, the other two being variously [[Turpin (archbishop)|Bishop Turpin]]'s sword [[Almace]], [[Charlemagne]]'s [[Joyeuse]], or [[Ogier the Dane|Ogier]]'s sword [[Curtana]].

===Other===
In the English or Scottish medieval epic poem [[Greysteil]], the hero uses a magic sword 'Egeking' which was made in the [[Far East]].

==Written fiction==
[[File:Ring21.jpg|thumb|Illustration by [[Arthur Rackham]] to Richard Wagner's ''[[Die Walküre]]'': the magic sword '''Nothung'''.]] 

[[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' features a golden sword called [[Chrysaor (sword)|Chrysaor]], the personal weapon of [[Sir Artegal]], the Knight of [[Justice]]. The sword was given to him by [[Astraea (mythology)|Astræa]], who had been holding it since the days when [[Zeus]] had used it to battle the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]]. Because it was "Tempred ''[ [[sic]] ]'' with [[Adamant]]", it was described as being able to cleave through anything.

In ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'', [[Richard Wagner]] drew on the legends of [[Brothers Grimm|Grimm]] for the sword [[Nothung]], belonging to the hero [[Sigmund|Siegmund]] and later reforged by his son [[Sigurd|Siegfried]] and used by him to kill [[Fafnir (Norse mythology)|Fafner]]. It is finally used by Siegfried to shatter the spear of his grandfather, the God [[Wotan]], thus ending his power.

The hero of [[Lewis Carroll]]'s [[poem]] "[[Jabberwocky]]" slays the Jabberwock with a [[vorpal sword]]. Although the poem does not define the word "vorpal" (and contains many nonsensical words with no meaning), the term has been adopted in role playing games to describe a sword which possesses a magical ability to [[decapitate]] those against whom it is wielded.   
[[File:Jabberwocky.jpg|left|thumb|Illustration of the poem "Jabberwocky" featuring the '''vorpal sword'''.]]

In the works of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] such as ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', many magical swords, usually with powers for good, are wielded by important characters. [[Gandalf]] uses his sword [[Glamdring]] in his battle with the [[Balrog]], who wields its own sword of flame. Glamdring's sister blade, [[Orcrist]], is buried with [[Thorin Oakenshield]] under the [[Lonely Mountain]] in ''[[The Hobbit]]''. [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]], [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Samwise]] carry the sword [[Sting (Middle-earth)|Sting]]. It and Glamdring both glow blue when [[Orc (Middle-earth)|orcs]] are near. [[Aragorn]] bears the sword [[List of Middle-earth weapons and armour#Narsil|Andúril]], a potent weapon against the evil of [[Mordor]] and a symbol of his right to rule. [[Turin Turambar]], the main character of [[The Children of H%C3%BArin]], wields the sword Gurthang. He eventually kills himself using the sword, which speaks to him before he dies, telling him it will kill him. This story is based on the Finnish hero [[Kullervo]], whose sword also agreed to kill him. In addition, in ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]'', the protagonist is given and wields a magic sword named [[Caudimordax]] which, in the story, is translated to mean "Tailbiter".

[[Hal Foster]]'s [[Prince Valiant]] wields the [[Singing Sword]], which makes its bearer undefeatable if he fights for a good cause.

In Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman's [[Darksword]] series the Darksword is a sword capable of absorbing magic.

[[Michael Moorcock]] created a sinister magic sword in ''[[Stormbringer]]'', wielded by [[Elric of Melniboné]]. This black sword has the power to suck out the souls of its victims and transfer their energy to its holder. It also appears to have a mind of its own, sometimes striking against its "master's" will.  [[Mercedes Lackey]]'s creation, the sword '''Need''' is similarly independent, although along less sinister lines.

The [[Twelve Swords of Power]] are the primary [[plot device]] in [[Fred Saberhagen]]'s ''[[Books of the Swords]]''.

[[Lawrence Watt-Evans]]'s ''[[The Misenchanted Sword]]'' (1985) involves the difficulties of dealing with the sword of the title; the [[protagonist]] must kill a man when he draws it, can only kill one, will die if he ever kills a hundred men with it – and will not die without killing them, but will ceaselessly age.

[[The Blue Sword]] contains a blue sword, known as [[Gonturan]], that is both a symbol of power (as it can only be used by a damalur-sol, a woman hero), an amplifier of magic and a very sharp sword.  It is also a sword with a mind of its own.

In [[Robert Jordan]]'s ''[[The Wheel of Time]]'' is the sword ''[[Callandor]]'', which is actually not a sword, but a powerful [[Sa'angreal#Items of Power|Sa'angreal]] shaped as a sword and made out of crystal. It is kept within the [[Stone of Tear]]. It can only be taken by the [[Dragon (Wheel of Time)|Dragon]] and is a major sign of his return. Until he takes it the Stone of Tear will never fall to any invaders, but when the sword is taken the Stone is said to fall to the ''[[Aiel|People of the Dragon]]''. It is later revealed that unlike other Sa'angreals it does not have the safety mechanism that prevents a wielder from absorbing too much of the [[One Power]] through it.

[[Terry Goodkind]]'s series is named for its magical weapon, [[the Sword of Truth]]. This blade, with the word "Truth" inlaid into the handle, factors into many of the moral decisions made by [[Richard Rahl]], the series' protagonist. The blade, like most magic in the series, is focused on need. The sword's master is referred to as the Seeker of Truth. The Seeker gains the swordmastery of all those that have wielded the blade previously. Many false Seekers have carried the sword, but a true Seeker can only be named by the First Wizard (Rahl is named by his grandfather, Zeddicus Zorander). A true Seeker has the ability to turn the blade white when he kills in compassion and forgiveness. Richard has done this twice. Once, killing the [[Mord-Sith]] which captured him in [[Wizard's First Rule]], and again to kill a [[Sister of the Dark]] in [[Stone of Tears]].

The eponymous sword from ''[[The Sword of Shannara]]'' series, by [[Terry Brooks]], has a distinctive pommel in the form of the druidic symbol from the series: a hand holding aloft a torch (similar to the Statue of Liberty).  Otherwise it is visually unremarkable, though very well made and unworn.  Its ability lies in revealing absolute truth, which can be difficult to bear.  The sentiment of the enchantment follows that of the "[[Polonius|To thine own self be true...]]" advice to [[Laertes (Hamlet)|Laertes]].  A prospective wielder, upon drawing the blade for the first time, is made to confront all their personal flaws, shortcomings, fears, delusions and morally questionable acts.  If the being's psyche cannot deal with the revelations, they might not be permanently harmed, but the blade is unusable to them.  However, if they can accept the truth of themselves, though it is still a jarring experience, they come out of it wiser for the self-knowledge.  Also, they are able to wield the Sword as both a particularly strong and sharp weapon, and as a harsh mirror of Truth to those touched by the blade.  This exposure to reality, like many years of counseling condensed into a moment, can actually destroy anyone "evil" enough, e.g. the Warlock Lord of the same book.  It also can reveal illusions and give some protection from magical effects.

Also of note is the Sword Nightblood from the book ''[[Warbreaker]]''. Nightblood is a sentient sword which was given a direction when awakened. This direction was to 'destroy evil.' However, being a sword, Nightblood could not judge right and wrong and killed almost indiscriminately. Simply undoing the clasp (which was extraordinarily tempting for one without a pure heart) was enough for nightblood to utterly destroy the one holding it. Nightblood was often recovered by Vasher sticking clean through a man, not even unsheathed. Nightblood, when fully drawn consumed Its user's BioChromatic breaths at an alarming rate, while sending tendrils of darkness out to destroy anything the sword deemed 'evil.' The sword could also telepathically communicate with its wielder, often asking questions such as "Hello, would you like to kill someone today?" or alternatively asking to be unsheathed.

The ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series of novels by [[J.K. Rowling]] features the '''Sword of Gryffindor''', which is used by several of the book's prominent characters.  The sword is an indestructible weapon crafted from goblin metal, the properties of which allow the sword to absorb any substance into itself that will make it stronger, in the case of the books, the immensely deadly venom of a [[basilisk]].

In series: The Dancing Gods, by [[Jack L. Chalker]], the protagonist, the barbarian Joe, is given "The last unnamed magical sword in Husaquahr". In order for the sword to bond with Joe, he has to give it a name, preferably something heroic. However Joe names the sword "Irving" after his son. In response to the exclamations concerning his choice of name, he states "...but I like the name Irving". Once bonded, the sword will fight for no other user, and will return to Joe if he calls it.

==Movies and Television==
Movies and Television across varying genres depict swords with magical qualities. 

*In the ''[[Star Wars]]'' saga, which employs many themes of classical mythology, the [[lightsaber]] can be seen as a [[science fiction]] with a mythological analogue of the magic swords of myth. The device appears to defy the laws of modern technology, however studies and experiments by scientists indicate the technology to be possible in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/26/4773354/scientists-create-light-saber-material-with-photon-binding-technique|title=Scientists create 'light saber' material with photon-binding technique|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/have-harvard-scientists-created-real-lightsaber-kind-1411158|title=Have Harvard Scientists Created A Real Lightsaber?

* In the movie ''[[The Golden Blade]]'' (1952), the Sword of Damaskus, which can cut anything and makes its wielder invincible, is used by [[Harun Al-Rashid]] ([[Rock Hudson]]) to free a fairy-tale [[Baghdad]] from [[Jafar]], a usurper of the throne.
* The ''[[Masters of the Universe]]'' franchise more directly mixes magic and technology, with the [[He-Man|titular hero]] deriving his power from a magic sword but living on a [[Eternia|planet]] where the traditional gadgetry of science fiction is as common as magic.
* In the British television series ''[[Robin of Sherwood]]'', [[Robin Hood]] carries Albion, one of the seven swords of Wayland. The sword's powers include providing visions to its bearer. It cannot hurt its master.
* The Sword of Omens in the ''[[Thundercats]]'' animated series possesses magical powers and the Eye of Thundera in the hilt. Another sword, the Sword of Plun-Darr, was a key element to the plot of certain episodes.
* In the ''[[Samurai Jack]]'' animated series, the father of [[Samurai Jack#Samurai Jack|the titular hero]] gave his son a [[katana]] from the gods to defeat the evil [[Aku (Samurai Jack)|Aku]]. Only this magic katana could harm Aku, although it could not kill him completely. This magic sword would obey only its rightful owner, making it impossible to hurt Jack when his enemy wields it. The sword was forged of the pure spirit of good that humans possess, extracted from Jack's father.
* In the animated series "[[Thundarr the Barbarian]]" the main character Thundarr wields the lightsaber-like sun sword.
* In the ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[Make Love, Not Warcraft]]", the story contains a powerful sword referred to as "The Sword of A Thousand Truths".
* A magic sword, named Sword of Triton, appears in ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides]]''. According to the film's visual guide, this blade was forged in the lost city of [[Atlantis]]. The official ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean Online]]'' website implies that the sword was forged by the sea deity [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]] himself and that it has passed from one ancient mariner to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.piratesonline.go.com/blog/pirates/entry/did_you_know_on_stranger|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130624153911/http://blog.piratesonline.go.com/blog/pirates/entry/did_you_know_on_stranger|deadurl=yes|title=Did You Know? …On Stranger Tides edition : Grog Blog|date=24 June 2013|archivedate=24 June 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the events of ''On Stranger Tides'', the sword is in the possession of the notorious pirate [[Blackbeard]], who uses it to control ships at sea. In the film, Blackbeard first used the sword to "hang" his mutinying crew with the rigging of the ''[[Queen Anne's Revenge]]''. Blackbeard lost the sword after a duel with privateer [[Hector Barbossa]], who wanted revenge on Blackbeard for attacking the ''[[Black Pearl]]'' (which cost Barbossa's right leg) prior to the events of the film. Barbossa claimed the sword before leaving Blackbeard to die at the [[Fountain of Youth]]. Climbing aboard the ''Revenge'', Barbossa returned to piracy as he used the sword to sail the ship to Tortuga.
*In ''[[The Librarian (franchise)|The Librarian]]'', [[Excalibur]], which appears in both the [[The Librarian (franchise)|films]] and the [[The Librarians (2014 TV series)|television series]], is shown as having been infused with magic by [[Merlin]], giving it the ability to be summoned across vast distances and fight independently of its wielder. The sword primarily serves as a personal trainer and protector of the Library, working alongside Librarian [[Flynn Carsen]], who gives it the nickname "Cal". In the first two episodes of ''The Librarians'' ("And The Crown of King Arthur" and "And The Sword In the Stone"), the sword is stolen by the Serpent Brotherhood, who use it to mortally wound Flynn. They then take it to the stone where it was originally forged, combining the two to steal Excalibur's magic and release it into the world. Flynn and his team manage to defeat the Brotherhood, but both he and Excalibur die of their injuries soon after. Cassandra, the Librarian responsible for these events, uses what little magic she can gather to heal them instead of herself. Excalibur makes a final appearance in the episode "And The Final Curtain", where Flynn's Guardian, Eve Baird, receives it from the [[Lady of the Lake]]. Flynn then uses it to destroy the staff of [[Prospero]], who is subsequently erased from existence.

==Anime==

* The [[manga]] and subsequent [[anime]] ''[[Bleach (manga)|Bleach]]'' features several magic swords, called ''[[zanpakuto]]'' ("soul-cutting swords"). These katana-like weapons are a representation of the power of the ''Shinigami'' (called "[[Soul Reaper (Bleach)|Soul Reapers]]" in the English translation) within the ''Bleach'' universe, and essentially - "come from within". As such, ''zanpakuto'' can grow in strength and power in tandem with its user. These swords are often personified in a [[humanoid]] form throughout the series. All ''zanpakuto'' have unique and often poetic Japanese names, such as [[Ichigo Kurosaki]]'s ''zanpakuto'' called '''Zangetsu''', which means '''Moon-Cutter.''' All ''zanpakuto'' have personalities, emotions and feelings of their own, and it is stated that in order to use the true powers of their ''zanpakuto'' (''bankai'', "final release"), the ''Shinigami'' wielder must conquer (master) them through training and battle - essentially forcing a part of themselves (their own power) into submission.
* In ''[[Rave Master]]'', Haru's sword, "Decaforce Sword" is a kind of magic sword powered by Rave stones. It is used by Haru to destroy Dark stones.
* In ''[[Naruto]]'', another Japanese manga series, based heavily on traditional folklore themes, the legendary grasscutter Kusanagi-no tsurugi makes an entrance. The sword used to be in the possession of the snake ''Sannin'' [[Orochimaru]], as the poisonous blade complements the ninja's affinity to summoned snakes. Its counterpart is said to be the sword Totsuka, a sword wielded by the god Susanoo, capable of sealing everything it touches into a pure state of peaceful entrapment.
* [[Gourry Gabriev]] of the anime and manga ''[[The Slayers]]'' is a knight who wields the Sword of Light, a sword with a magical blade of [[list of light sources|pure light]].

* In the manga and anime videos ''[[Ogre Slayer]]'', the main character has no name and is known by the name of his sword, Onikirimaru or ogre-slayer. The sword enables him to track and kill ogres.
* ''In [[InuYasha]]'' both the titular character InuYasha and his half-brother Sesshomaru wield magical blades created by their father's fangs, and there are many other magical swords and weapons in the series mostly gaining power from the energy of the wielder.
*In the anime and manga ''[[Reborn!]]'' the 10th Vongola Rain Guardian [[Takeshi Yamamoto]] and Varia Rain Guardian Superbi Squalo use a swords. Yamamoto uses Shigure Kintoki which was given to him by his father. Squalo uses Arm-Mounted Sword.
* [[One Piece]], [[List_of_best-selling_manga|the best-selling Manga series in history]], (that has also been adapted into an equally successful anime), has a variety of "Meito" or grade swords, one of the primary characters, [[Roronoa Zoro]], wields three such [[Katana]].

==Video and role-playing games==

[[Video game]]s and [[fantasy]] [[role-playing game]]s feature a great variety of magical armaments, most commonly represented by swords and similar archetypal weapons. These swords are rarely unique, and in many role-playing scenarios, magical weapons are so ubiquitous that the [[player character]]s are expected to come into possession of them as a matter of course.

* The "[[Fire Emblem]]" series regularly features magical swords that can only be used by the main protagonists of a given entry of the series.  The most notable of which is called Falchion, a blade forged from a fang from the divine dragon Naga.  This sword's properties include the ability to heal its wielder, inflict increased damage against dragons, and kill the final bosses of the games that it has appeared. 
* ''[[Heavenly sword]]'' game features a sword by the same name wielded by the protagonist Nariko that changes into two chained blades, two short swords or a single two handed sword.
* ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'' games feature many magic swords the most famous of which is the [[Master Sword]], the legendary Blade of Evil's Bane that has appeared in most of the games in the series since its first appearance in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past]]''. The Master Sword was forged by the gods and possesses many mystical abilities such as the power to repel, seal, or smite evil, and protect its user from certain types of magic. The Master Sword can only be wielded by someone with great courage and [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]] and his various incarnations must usually prove themselves in order to wield the blade or unlock its true powers. In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword]]'', it is revealed that the Master Sword contains a sentient spirit named Fi whose soul was imparted into the blade by the Goddess Hylia before she gave up her divinity in order to reincarnate into the mortal [[Princess Zelda]].
**In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap]]'' and the Picori Blade which is re-forged into the legendary Four Sword, a magical blade that can allow its user to split into four copies.

'''Matthew Thomas Skiba''' (born February 24, 1976) is an American musician, singer and songwriter known for his role as the co-lead vocalist and guitarist of the bands [[Alkaline Trio]] and [[Blink-182]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Major|first1=Nick|title="It’s my favorite group of songs we’ve made in a long time"—Travis Barker on new Blink-182|url=http://www.altpress.com/aptv/video/aptv_talks_new_album_with_blink_182s_travis_barker_at_grammys|publisher=Alternative Press|accessdate=9 March 2016|date=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Skiba began performing with Blink-182 in March 2015 as a last minute replacement following the second departure of founding guitarist and vocalist [[Tom DeLonge]] and later joined the band permanently in July of that same year. His first appearance is on the band's 2016 album, ''[[California (Blink-182 album)|California]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/blink-182/88100|title=Blink 182 studio photos confirm Matt Skiba recordings|last=Hendicott|first=James|date=September 5, 2015|work=[[NME]]|accessdate=March 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skiba has also recorded and performed solo and with his side-projects, [[Heavens (band)|Heavens]] and the Hell. In 2012, he released a solo album, ''Babylon'', with his backing band the Sekrets. A second album, ''Kuts'', was released on June 1, 2015.

==Early life and family==
Matt Skiba was born in Chicago and moved to nearby [[McHenry, Illinois|McHenry]] at the age of three. He began playing piano and drums at an early age.  His first concert was [[Public Image Ltd]].&lt;ref name="Alkaline Trio - Matt Skiba"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://decapolis.com/musicreviews/interviews/alkaline.shtml |title=Alkaline Trio – Matt Skiba
 |publisher=Decapolis.com |year=2001 |accessdate=2010-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, while working as a [[Bicycle messenger|bike messenger]], he decided to switch from drums to guitar. Prior to that he played in bands including Blunt, Jerkwater, and the Traitors.

His mother Joan Skiba is a fourth and fifth grade teacher at Woods Creek Elementary School in [[Crystal Lake, Illinois]]. His father Thomas Skiba is an oral surgeon in Crystal Lake.  He has two younger twin sisters.&lt;ref name="Alkaline Trio - Matt Skiba" /&gt;

==Alkaline Trio==
Skiba studied design at Chicago's [[Columbia College Chicago|Columbia College]] but left in 1996 to form [[Alkaline Trio]] with drummer [[Glenn Porter]] and bassist Rob Doran.

After the group recorded their demo and the single "[[Sundials (song)|Sundials]]", they recorded the ''[[For Your Lungs Only]]'' EP, during which Doran left the group. [[Dan Andriano]] joined and played bass on the EP. The band released their debut full-length ''[[Goddamnit]]'' on Asian Man Records in 1998, followed by ''[[Maybe I'll Catch Fire]]''  and the compilation ''[[Alkaline Trio (album)|Alkaline Trio]]'' in 2000.

The group's lineup changed again in 2000 when Porter left and former [[Smoking Popes]] drummer Mike Felumlee joined. ''[[From Here to Infirmary]]'', released by [[Vagrant Records]] in the spring of 2001. In 2002 [[Jade Tree Records]] released a [[Hot Water Music]]/Alkaline Trio split EP which was well received. Both bands contributed original tracks and covers of each other's songs. ''[[Good Mourning]]'' followed in 2003, marking the band's first album with drummer [[Derek Grant (drummer)|Derek Grant]], formerly of [[Suicide Machines]] and Thoughts of Ionesco.  While recording ''Good Mourning'', Skiba had a problem with [[acid reflux]] because of his diet, lack of vocal warm-up and his earlier troubles with alcohol and drugs.

Following a tour and throat surgery for Skiba, the band recorded and released ''[[Crimson (Alkaline Trio album)|Crimson]]'' in 2005 and the compilation ''[[Remains (Alkaline Trio album)|Remains]]'' in 2007. ''[[Agony &amp; Irony]]'', their first record on [[Epic Records]], was released in July 2008. In January 2010 they released ''[[This Addiction]]'' on their own Heart &amp; Skull label in partnership with [[Epitaph Records]]. In July 2011, they released a semi-acoustic LP called ''[[Damnesia]]'' to commemorate 15 years as a band. Their eighth album, ''[[My Shame Is True]]'' was released on April 21, 2013.

In 2014, the band underwent an anthology tour known as the "Past Live Tour", in which they performed their first eight studio albums in their entirety across four dates. Following a five-year hiatus from the studio, the band released their ninth album, ''[[Is This Thing Cursed?]]'', on August 31, 2018.

==Blink-182==
[[File:Matt Skiba performing with Blink-182 in 2016 at the Musink Festival.jpg|thumb|Skiba performing with Blink-182 in 2015 at the Musink Festival.]]
Following the departure of [[Tom DeLonge]] from [[Blink-182]] in 2015, [[Mark Hoppus]] announced that Skiba would "fill in" for the band and performed two club shows and a slot at the Musink festival in March 2015. Later that year, the band confirmed that Skiba was now an official member. He then appeared on the Blink-182 album ''[[California (Blink-182 album)|California]],'' released July 1, 2016.

==Side projects and solo==
In 2001 he began his first full solo tour with The Plea for Peace Tour, consisting mostly of acoustic versions of [[Alkaline Trio]] songs with backing drums and bass in a few shows.

His first solo release came in 2002 in the form of a split with [[Kevin Seconds]] of [[7 Seconds (band)|7 Seconds]] fame. The songs were mostly acoustic with drums, bass, and piano played by Skiba. Alkaline Trio still occasionally performs the song "Good Fucking Bye".

In 2005 Skiba contributed the song "Demons Away" to the [[Fat Wreck Chords]]' compilation ''[[Protect: A Benefit for the National Association to Protect Children]]''.

In 2006 Skiba launched the band [[Heavens (band)|Heavens]] with [[F-Minus]] bassist [[Josiah Steinbrick]]. The group released ''[[Patent Pending (album)|Patent Pending]]'' on September 12, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moture.net/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=54]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018215023/http://www.moture.net/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=54|date=October 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2006 Skiba contributed to the track "[[Rock 'n' Roll High School (song)|Rock 'n' Roll High School]]" featured on ''[[Brats on the Beat: Ramones for Kids]]'', a tribute album released on [[Go-Kart Records]].

In May 2007 Skiba performed five shows with [[Chuck Ragan]] of Hot Water Music.

In late December 2008 Steinbrick announced on Heavens' MySpace page, "This is no longer a Heavens page. Sorry, that's just the way it's going down. Matt will still be doing Trio stuff and last I heard he might be working on a wonderful solo record. I'm not really positive actually but I'm sure it will be great."{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} A falling out between Skiba and Steinbrick led to the breakup.

On August 18, 2009, at Debonair Social Club in Chicago, IL, Skiba, Grant and Greg Corner and Jonny Radtke of [[Kill Hannah]] debuted the [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] cover band Them Crooked Vulvas (and occasionally played under the name A Perfect Circus).

On August 10, 2010, he released a solo album titled ''[[Demos (Matt Skiba album)|Demos]]'' on [[Asian Man Records]]. The album is said to be a precursor to a future Alkaline Trio album .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=1651422 |title=Matt's Solo Details |publisher=AbsolutePunk.net |date= |accessdate=2010-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bhamra |first=Satvir |url=http://amplified.tv/2010/04/23/alkaline-trio-frontman-to-release-solo-album/ |title=Alkaline Trio frontman to release solo album |publisher=Amplified.tv |date=April 23, 2010 |accessdate=2010-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, Skiba released an EP along with former [[Angels and Airwaves]] and [[The Offspring]] drummer [[Atom Willard]] under the moniker The Hell. The Hell's debut EP is entitled ''Sauve Les Requins''.

Skiba's second full-length solo album, ''Babylon'', was released on May 8, 2012. The album features Skiba leading a band called Matt Skiba and the Sekrets, the backing band includes [[AFI (band)|AFI]] bassist [[Hunter Burgan]], and former touring drummer for [[My Chemical Romance]] [[Jarrod Alexander]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/article/45794 |title=Matt Skiba and the Sekrets sign to Superball Music |publisher=Punknews.org |date= |accessdate=2014-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Voices" impacted radio on May 1, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurricane.de/en/|title=Hurricane Festival Lineup 2017|work=hurricane|date=December 6, 2016|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2013, Matt Skiba encouraged Mike Park of [[Asian Man Records]] to release [[The Smith Street Band]] first two albums in America. Matt had met the bands guitarist Lee Hartney and fallen in love with his personality and tones. Blink 182 &amp; The Smith Street Band will play together in 2017 at [[Hurricane Festival]] in Germany.&lt;ref name="Inside Radio &amp; Records"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://darrenroseradio.com/ |title=Inside Radio &amp; Records |publisher=Darren Rose Radio |date= |accessdate=2014-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matt Skiba confirms his current work on a solo record, a screenplay, and a children's punk record featuring Mark Hoppus.&lt;ref name="Inside Radio &amp; Records"/&gt;

In March 2015, Matt Skiba and the Sekrets' second album, ''Kutz'', was announced for a release date of June 1.

=== Cabinets ===
{{Unreferenced|section|date=September 2018}}
Skiba has always been a user of Orange Cabinets, as he has toured with them for the majority of Alkaline Trio and Blink 182's tours. It is believed that they are dummy cabinets now, but Skiba occasionally mics them with Blink, showing that if they are not being used for this purpose, they are most likely for stage-use only.

==Personal life==
Skiba is a vegan and practices [[Transcendental Meditation technique|Transcendental Meditation]] according to an interview with [[AOL]] Interface. He said that the clear and calm state of mind it provides has greatly helped his creative process, though initially he believed the "tortured soul" mindset was more beneficial. The book ''Catching the Big Fish'' by [[David Lynch]] caused him to change his mind and he now believes a calm state is more artistically helpful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/article/47709 |title=Interviews: Matt Skiba (Alkaline Trio) |publisher=Punknews.org |date= |accessdate=2014-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontarmy.com/news/a-long-ass-chat-with-matt-skiba-from-alkaline-trio-and-now-matt-skiba-and-the-sekrets/ |title=A LONG-ASS CHAT WITH MATT SKIBA FROM ALKALINE TRIO AND NOW MATT SKIBA AND THE SEKRETS – FRONT – The funniest, sexiest magazine on Earth &amp;#124; FRONT – The funniest, sexiest magazine on Earth |publisher=Frontarmy.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Outlook|first=Jason|last=Bracelin|work=Las Vegas Review – Journal. |date=July 25, 2008|page=J.22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Menara gardens''' ({{lang-ar|حدائق المنارة}}) are [[botanical garden]]s located to the west of [[Marrakech]], [[Morocco]], near the [[Atlas Mountains]]. They were established in the 12th century (c. 1130) by the [[Almohad Caliphate]] ruler [[Abd al-Mu'min]].
[[File:MD.BOUALAM Sunset El Menara.jpg|thumb|left|El-Menara at sunset, April 2013]]
The name ''menara'' derives from the [[pavilion]] with its small green pyramid-shaped roof (''menzeh''), meaning lighthouse (منارَة [manaara]). Although there is no actual lighthouse in the gardens, any building that sits at a high elevation is locally known as menara, such as the mosque Menaret manaara. The pavilion was built during the 16th century [[Saadi dynasty]] and renovated in 1869 by sultan [[Abderrahmane of Morocco]], who used to stay here in summertime.
[[File:Jardins de la Ménara.jpg|thumb|upright|The Menara gardens]]
The pavilion and [[Basin (maritime)|basin]] (an artificial lake) are surrounded by [[orchard]]s and [[olive grove]]s. The intention of the basin was to [[Irrigation|irrigate]] the surrounding gardens and orchards using a sophisticated system of underground channels called a ''[[qanat]]''. The basin is supplied with water thanks to an old [[hydraulic system]], which conveys water from the mountains located approximately 30&amp;nbsp;km away from Marrakech. It also served as a martial station.

[[File:Milarepa-statue-made-by-root-student-rechungpa.jpg|thumb|238px|A famous statue of Milarepa brought from Nyanang Phelgyeling Monastery, Tibet]]
{{Tibetan Buddhism}}
'''Jetsun Milarepa''' ({{bo|t=རྗེ་བཙུན་མི་ལ་རས་པ|w=rje btsun mi la ras pa}}, 1028/40–1111/23){{sfn|Quintman|p=536}} was a Tibetan [[siddha]], who famously was a murderer as a young man then turned to Buddhism to become an accomplished buddha despite his past. He is generally considered as one of [[Tibet]]'s most famous [[yogi]]s and poets, serving as an example for the Buddhist life. He was a student of [[Marpa Lotsawa]], and a major figure in the history of the [[Kagyu]] school of [[Tibetan Buddhism]].{{sfn|Quintman|p=536}}

==Biography==

===''The Life of Milarepa''===
[[File:Gompa at Milarepa's cave.JPG|thumb|Overlooking Pelgyeling Gompa at [[Milarepa's Cave]], Tibet.]]
[[File:Sekhar Gutog monastery in Lhodrag near Bhutan.jpg|thumb|The nine storey tower that Milarepa single-handedly built, Sekhar Gutok, Lhodrag, Tibet.]]

Milarepa's life-story is famous in the Tibetan culture, and retold many times. The best-known biography, ''The Life of Milarepa'', written by [[Tsangnyön Heruka]] (1452-1507) in the fifteenth century and drawing from older biographies, is still very popular.{{sfn|Quintman|2004|p=536}}{{sfn|Lopez|2010}}{{sfn|Quintman|2010}} Most of the present-day stories on Milarepa come from this single source.{{sfn|Quintman|2010}} While "very little [is known] about him as a historical person at all," Milarepa is venerated by all Tibetan schools "as an exemplar of religious dedication and mastery," and his lifestory established the lineage of the Kagyu sect and its key figures.{{sfn|Quintman|2010}}

According to ''The Life of Milarepa'', Milarepa was born in western Tibet to a prosperous family.{{sfn|Quintman|p=536}} When his father died, his family was bereft of their wealth by his aunt and uncle. At his mother's request, Milarepa left home and studied [[Magic (supernatural)|sorcery]] to take revenge, killing many people.{{sfn|Quintman|2004|p=536}} Later he felt sorrow about his deeds, and became student of [[Marpa Lotsawa|Marpa the Translator]]. Before Marpa would teach Milarepa, he had him undergo abuse and trials, such as letting him build and then demolish three towers in turn. Milarepa was asked to build one final multi-story tower by Marpa at Lhodrag, which still stands.&lt;ref name="prm.ox.ac.uk"&gt;prm.ox.ac.uk: [http://tibet.prm.ox.ac.uk/photo_2001.59.4.50.1.html Sekhar Gutog monastery in Lhodrag near Bhutan]&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Marpa accepted him, explaining that the trials were a means to purify Milarepa's negative karma.{{sfn|Quintman|2004|p=536}} Marpa transmitted tantric Tantric initiations and instructions to Milarepa, including ''[[tummo]]'' ("yogic heat"), the "aural transmissions" ({{bo|w=snyan rgyud}}), and ''[[mahamudra]]''.{{sfn|Quintman|2010}} Marpa told Milarepa to practice solitary meditation in caves and mountain retreats, which, according to the biography, after many years of practice resulted in "a deep experiential realization about the true nature of reality." Thereafter he lived as a fully realized yogin, and eventually even forgave his aunt, who caused the misfortune of his family.{{sfn|Quintman|2010}}

According to Lopez, ''The Life of Milarepa'' represents "Buddhism as it was understood and practiced in Tibet in the fifteenth century, projected back in time,"{{sfn|Lopez|2010}} and contains "many of the key terms and doctrines of Buddhism."{{sfn|Lopez|2010}} Tsangnyön Heruka did his best to establish a lineage of teachers which connects the Kagyu tradition with the Indian ''siddha'' tradition, portraying Marpa as a student of Naropa, though Naropa had already died when Marpa went to India.{{sfn|Lopez|2010}}

Lopez notes that Tsangnyön Heruka used stylistic elements from the biography of [[Gautama Buddha]] to portray Milarepa effectively as a Tibetan Buddha, "born and enlightened in Tibet, without going to India or receiving the direct instructions of an Indian master."{{sfn|Lopez|2010}} The lifestory of Milarepa portrays "the rapid method of the Tantric path,"in which liberation is gained in one lifetime. It describes how Milarepa practiced the generation stage and completion stage, to achieve ''[[mahamudra]]'', "spontaneous realization of the most profound [[Śūnyatā|nature of mind]]."{{sfn|Lopez|2010}} Yet, in his instructions to his Tibetan audiences, Milarepa refers to the basic Buddhist teachings of "impermanence, the sufferings of ''[[saṃsāra]]'', the certainty of death and the uncertainty of its arrival, the frightful rebirth that is the direct result of our benighted deeds." But, his own life also is an example that even a murderer can transform into a Buddha.{{sfn|Lopez|2010}} Lopez further notes that ''The Life of Milarepa'' portrays two parallel worlds, a profane world and a sacred world, which are ultimately one, showing that the world itself is sacred.{{sfn|Lopez|2010}}

===''The Hundred Thousand Songs of Milarepa''===
[[File:Milarepa,_Pango_Chorten,_Gyantse.JPG|thumb|Milarepa statue, Pango Chorten, [[Gyantse]], Tibet.]]

Previous biographies of Milarepa were enlarged with religious poetry and song cycles, which doubled the volume of biographical information.  Tsangnyön Heruka published these songs in a separate volume as ''The Hundred Thousand Songs of Milarepa'', summarizing the various song cycles in chapter eleven of ''The Life of Milarepa''.{{sfn|Quintman|2010}}

==Historical context==
Milarepa lived during the socalled [[Tibetan Buddhism#Tibetan Renaissance - second dissemination (10th-12th century)|second dissemination of Buddhism in Tibet]] (10th-12th century), when Buddhism was re-introduced. Three pivotal figures in this Tibetan Renaissance were [[Rinchen Zangpo]] (958-1055), who translated sutras, tantras and commentaries; [[Atiśa]] (982-1054), whose student [[Dromtön]] founded the [[Kadam (Tibetan Buddhism)|Kadam]] school of Tibetan Buddhism; and [[Marpa Lotsawa]], the teacher of Milarepa, and himself regarded as student of [[Naropa]]. Marpa introduced tantric texts and oral instructions from the Bengali [[siddha]] tradition into Tibet,{{sfn|Lopez|2010}} and Marpa's purported connection with Naropa established the lineage of the Kaguy school, thereby reaching back to the Buddha himself.{{sfn|Lopez|2010}}{{sfn|Quintman|2010}}

The '''Ndut''' is a [[rite of passage]] as well as a [[religious education]] commanded by [[Serer religion]] that every [[Serer people|Serer]] (an ethnic group found in [[Senegal]], [[the Gambia]] and [[Mauritania]]) must go through once in their lifetime. The Serer people being an [[ethnoreligious group]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Diedrich Westermann]], Edwin William Smith, Cyril Daryll Forde, [[International African Institute]], [[International Institute of African Languages and Cultures]], [[Project Muse]], [[JSTOR]] (Organization), ''"Africa: journal of the International African Institute, Volume 63"'', pp 86-96, 270-1, Edinburgh University Press for the International African Institute, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; the Ndut initiation rite is also linked to Serer culture.&lt;ref name="Cir"&gt;{{en icon}} Niang, Cheikh Ibrahima, Boiro, Hamadou, "Social Construction of Male Circumcision in [[West Africa]], A Case Study of [[Senegal]] and [[Guinea-Bissau]]", [in] [[Reproductive Health Matters]] (2007) [http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/pihhr/files/resources_and_publications/journal_series/RHM/RHM29-Niang.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Dion, Salif, "Le Ndut ou l’Education initiatique en pays sereer : étude thématique de chants et de symboles, Dakar, [[Université de Dakar]] (1979), p 124, (Mémoire de Maîtrise)&lt;/ref&gt; From the moment a Serer child is born, education plays a pivotal role throughout their [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]]. The ndut is one of these phases of their life cycle.&lt;ref name="Gravrand"/&gt; In Serer society, education lasts a lifetime, from infancy to old age.&lt;ref name="Gravrand"/&gt;

==Etymology==
The name Ndut comes from the [[Ndut language|language]] of the [[Ndut people]], a sub-group of the [[Serer people]]. In a religious sense, it means [[nest]]. It is a place of sanctuary, and the place where Serer boys lodge in preparation for their [[circumcision]].&lt;ref name="Cir"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gravrand"/&gt; These boys are called ''njuli'' (initiates). The word ''njuli'' comes from the [[Serer language|Serer]] word juul (variations: ''juu'') which means a little boy's [[penis]].&lt;ref&gt;"Diktioneer Seereer-Angeleey, Serere-English Dictionary", First Edition, (May 2010), Compiled by PCVs Bethany Arnold, Chris Carpenter, Guy Pledger, and Jack Brown. Created and printed by Peace Corps Senegal.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its religious connotations, the word has been borrowed by the [[Wolof people|Wolof]] to designate a [[Muslim]] person (juulit)&lt;ref name="Cir"/&gt; (see :[[Serer religion#Influence on Senegambia|Serer religion's influence in Senegambia]]).

==Types==
There are two main types of Ndut initiation rites. The first concerns the circumcision for Serer boys whilst the second concerns the initiation of Serer girls. [[Serer religion]] and culture forbids the circumcision of Serer girls ([[female genital mutilation]]). Only Serer boys are circumcised.&lt;ref name="Cir"/&gt; Serer girls receive their initiation through ''njam'' or ''ndom'' (the [[Tattoo|tattooing of the gums]]). Preparation for the initiation starts early in childhood. In many cases, boys are circumcised when they reach 13 years old. However it is not uncommon for some to be circumcised when they are 19 to 26 years old. Likewise, Serer girls receive their initiation when they are 11 to 18 years.&lt;ref name="Gravrand"&gt;{{fr icon}} [[Henry Gravrand|R.P. Henri Gravrand]]  [http://www.refer.sn/ethiopiques/article.php3?id_article=895&amp;artsuite=6 Le Ndut dans « L'héritage spirituel sereer : valuer traditionnelle d'hier, d'aujourd'hui et de demain »] (article du [in] ''Éthiopiques'' n° 31)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The purpose of this initiation is to mark the transition from [[childhood]] to [[adulthood]]. It is also to teach young Serers how to be good, brave and honourable citizens. In Serer society, a Serer man who has not undergone the Ndut iniation rite is not deemed to be man. It is also [[taboo]] for a Serer woman to marry a Serer man who has not been circumcised. In a [[Serer religion|religious]] and [[Hygiene|hygienic]] point of view, an uncircumcised [[penis]] is deemed uncleanly and impure. Likewise, in old Serer culture, a Serer woman who has not undergone the ''njam'' was not deemed to be a real woman. Though prejudice against Serer women who have not undergone the njam is less prevalent nowadays due to modernity, prejudice against Serer men who have not undergone circumcision still prevails in Serer culture.&lt;ref name="Cir"/&gt;

==Preparation for the Ndut==
The preparation for the Ndut takes several years, and involves the participation of the whole family and lineages (both maternal and paternal) as well as the community. It is a long process where physical, sychological, spiritual and economic 
factors all come into play, in preparation for the child before the actual act of circumcision (for boys) or njam (for girls). The entire family play a vital role in preparing the child for this journey.&lt;ref name="Cir"/&gt;

Before a Serer boy is circumcised, he must make a public pronouncements called ''"Kan boppam"'' in [[Serer language|Serer]]. This public pronouncements is made in the form of a [[poem]] (''"ciid"'' in Serer language&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Diène Faye|Faye, Louis Diène]], "Mort et Naissance Le Monde Sereer", Les Nouvelles Edition Africaines (1983), p 34, {{ISBN|2-7236-0868-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or song.&lt;ref name="Cir"/&gt; One of these chants is given below''':'''
::''"Duma daw Saala Saala maa ko dige"'' (I will not avoid the knife because I requested it).&lt;ref name="Dion in"&gt;Dione, Salif, "L’appel du Ndut ou l’initiation des garc¸ons seereer [[Institut Fondamental d'Afrique Noire|IFAN]] (2004) [in] Niang, Cheikh Ibrahima, Boiro, Hamadou, "Social Construction of Male Circumcision in West Africa, A Case Study of Senegal and Guinea-Bissau", [in] Reproductive Health Matters (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The role of women===
In the initiation of both Serer boys and girls, Serer women play an important role.  Although women are forbidden to participate in the actual act of circumcision or to enter the Ndut (the nest sanctuary), the boy's female family play an important role before and after the act of circumcision. They are part of the family unit that helps the child to prepare for the circumcision. It is not only the male relatives who helps the child, but the whole family. The child's paternal aunt (his father's sister) would give a [[bracelet]] (usually [[silver]]) to the child to be worn on his left arm as a sign of good luck.&lt;ref name="Cir"/&gt; In most cases, it is the father who give the child this bracelet as protection.&lt;ref name="Gravrand"/&gt; Just after the circumcision, the boy's mother would sometimes even breast feed the child for the last time. This breast feeding act is symbolic of rebirth after death, and requires "the ingestion of lifegiving nourishment from the mother". Thus the woman is seen as a giver of life and the protection of life.&lt;ref name="Cir"/&gt; The importance of women is best preserved in the  Serer mythology of ''Mama'' (''"the grandmother"'' in [[Serer language]]) :

::''"Mama swallows those who have undergone initiation and then spits them out again. She is an invisible spirit for the initiates (in her presence, the initiates must lower their heads and close their eyes). Mama appears as soon as the circumcised men have begun to chant, with all their strength, the songs which are dedicated to her."''&lt;ref name="Dion in"/&gt;

==Structure==
{{Serer religion}}
The structure of a Serer girl's initiation is somewhat similar to the structure of a Serer boy's initiation. For a Serer girl, the njam surgery is performed by an elderly woman with her helpers. These elderly women have undergone the surgery themselves. One of the head of these women is called the ''njamkat''. She is the one who will perform the operation (tattoo of the gums). The circumcision of Serer boys is also performed in a structured situation. It involves the circumciser and his helpers as well as a person who supervises the operation. This supervisor is the master of the circumcision (''"kumax"'' in Serer). He is the eldest male in the community and must possess all the qualities of a good kumax, which include: generosity, supportive and patience. All the men involved in the rite of passage must have undergone the operation themselves. A boy and his age group are usually circumcised together, under the guidance of the ''selbe'' (the person who accompanies the children to be circumcised). They form a pact of brotherhood.&lt;ref name="Cir"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gravrand"/&gt;

===The place===
The building where the circumcision takes place is called the ''ndut'' (nest). It is a temporary hut far away from the town or village. It is temporary because the hut must be set on fire just after the initiation. The burning of the ndut is symbolic. It represents that the sanctuary the initiates have been living in for the past three months,&lt;ref name="Gravrand"/&gt; shut off from the outside world was only a dream, an artificial place that does not exist in real life. However, they can refer back to the dream and use what they have learned from the dream when faced with the dangers of real life.&lt;ref name="Cir"/&gt; It is also taboo for a child to attend the same ndut where his father has received his circumcision.&lt;ref name="Gravrand"/&gt; Upon arrival in this sacred place, the boys chant the names of the [[Pangool]] (singular: ''Fangol'', Serer saints and ancestral spirits) :

::"Fadid, Fango, Invey ngara, Fadid, Fangol Invey ngara" (come here, Fangol we arrived. Come here, Fangol).&lt;ref name="Gravrand"/&gt;

Reciting this verse acknowledges the ancestors who have long departed, and are called upon to come near and protect the children from any bad spirit or evil that may befall the ndut especially at night.&lt;ref name="Gravrand"/&gt;

===Education===
{{see also|Timeline of Serer history|Saltigue|Serer ancient history}}
[[File:Five Pointed Star Lined.svg|thumb|upright|''Yoonir'', symbol of the Universe.&lt;ref&gt;Gravrand, ''"La civilisation sereer : Pangool"'' p 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" Museum of Civilization "&gt;Madiya, Clémentine Faïk-Nzuji, "Canadian Museum of Civilization", Canadian Centre for Folk Culture Studies, "International Centre for African Language, Literature and Tradition", (Louvain, Belgium), pp 27, 155, {{ISBN|0-660-15965-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The ndut is also a place for education. In classical ndut teachings, initiates get to learn about themselves, teamwork, how to be upstanding citizens, [[Timeline of Serer history|history of the Serer people]], the [[Supernatural|supernatural world]], [[Serer creation myth]], the [[cosmos]], mysteries of the [[universe]] and the formation of the [[star]]s&lt;ref&gt;Gravrand, "Pangool",  p98-100&lt;/ref&gt; etc.&lt;ref name="Cir"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gravrand"/&gt; Every morning, a [[dream interpretation]] exercise takes place. These exercise guide the children as to how to analysis each other's dreams as well as their own, and helps them develop their skills of [[Clairvoyance|clairvoyancy]].&lt;ref name="Gravrand"/&gt; It is also a place where they receive their [[sex education]], especially among the older members of the initiates. These young men are told not to engage in sexual activities with women until their operation has healed. The ceremony of washing is also emphasised. This helps in the healing process. The first ceremony of washing takes place near the ndut. Washing symbolizes purification.&lt;ref name="Cir"/&gt;

Children compose songs, sing and dance together. This exercise helps them to forget the actual circumcision pending. It also develops their artistic and team working skills. Friendships and brotherhood are formed which last a lifetime. Most of these songs are religious in nature. It is from these religious songs that the [[njuup]] tradition derives from (a conservartive Serer music, and the progenitor of [[mbalax]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} "[[Rémi Jegaan Dioh]] : Sur un air culturel et cultuel [in] ''Ferloo''{{cite web |url=http://www.ferloo.com/Remi-Jegaan-Dioh-Sur-un-air.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513074200/http://www.ferloo.com/Remi-Jegaan-Dioh-Sur-un-air.html |archivedate=2012-05-13 |df= }} (Retrieved : 15 May 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} "[[Youssou N’Dour]] : singer-statesman", [in] Prospect Magazine [http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/2012/01/youssou-n%E2%80%99dour-singer-statesman-senegal-president-berlusconi-fela-kuti-daniel-cohen/] (Retrieved : 15 May 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The operation===
After years of preparation, comes the actual act of circumcision for boys or njam for girls. This is where they test their honour according to the [[Serer principle of Jom]] - a code of beliefs and values that govern Serer lives. ''Jom'' in Serer means honour. The child must show no signs of anxiousness or fright. They must show bravery from start to finish, and must not twitch or cry during the operation. If the child shows signs of nervousness or fright just before the operation, the operation will not go ahead. It means that the child's family have not prepared the child sufficiently for this operation. The parents are judged according to the child's behaviour. In these circumstances, the kumax or njamkat will ask the family to take the child and reassure him or her then bring them back later. If the child has been reassured by the family then brought back later for the operation but they are still anxious, then the operation is cancelled. [[Serer religion]] dictates that, in circumstances like these, the child should not be humiliated. Instead, they should be encouraged and supported with words of praise and better prepared for the operation next time.&lt;ref name="Cir"/&gt; In spite of these religious commandments, the Serer people being governed by the code of ''Jom'', it was not uncommon for some Serer parents and family members to commit suicide because of what they viewed as humiliation or dishonour of the family name. Suicide is only permitted if it satisfies the Jom principle (see [[Serer religion]]).

If the boy shows no sign of anxiety, he is encouraged to open the tissue covering the head of the penis. In Serer, this is called ''"war o sumtax"'' (to kill the foreskin). The word "war" (as in [[War Jabi]]) means to kill in Serer. The boy to be circumcised would seat on a [[Mortar and pestle|mortar]] with his legs opened. He must muster the courage to do this on his own and should not be forced. The mortar symbolises the feminine world, and after the boy has been circumcised, he must never sit on a mortar again. Before the circumciser starts the operation, he ask the boy for forgiveness. He would utter the word ''waasanaam'' (please forgive me), and the boy would usually answer ''waasanaaong'' (I forgive you). This is a symbolic gesture of respect, communion and spirituality. It shows that the circumciser is well aware of the pain he is about to inflict, as he has undergone the operation himself and any mistake may result in death and tars his professional reputation forever.&lt;ref name="Cir"/&gt;

The blade is [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilized]]  before the actual circumcision in order to avoid [[infection]]. After the [[foreskin]] has been removed, a special kind of powder is applied on the penis to avoid infection and help in the healing process.&lt;ref name="Cir"/&gt;

==End of initiation==
After several weeks, usually three months, the initiates finish their rite of passage and go home. The ndut is set a blaze. Children receive presents from family members.&lt;ref name="Cir"/&gt; In pre-colonial times, the boys would perform a dance in front of the Serer kings and the rest of the royal family who would in turn give them presents for their courage (see [[Maad a Sinig Kumba Ndoffene Famak Joof]]).

{{Buddhism}}
The term '''Nikāya Buddhism''' was coined by Masatoshi Nagatomi as a non-derogatory substitute for [[Hinayana]], meaning the [[early Buddhist schools]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Thurman]] and Masatoshi Nagatomi of [[Harvard University]]: "'Nikaya Buddhism' is a coinage of Professor Masatoshi Nagatomi of Harvard University who suggested it to me as a usage for the eighteen schools of Indian Buddhism, to avoid the term 'Hinayana Buddhism,' which is found offensive by some members of the Theravada tradition." {{cite journal|last1=Thurman|first1=Robert|title=The emptiness that is compassion: an essay on Buddhist ethics|journal=Religious Traditions|date=1981|volume=4|page=fn 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of these groups are [[pre-sectarian Buddhism]] and the early Buddhist schools. Some scholars exclude pre-sectarian Buddhism when using the term.  The term [[Theravada]] refers to Buddhist practices based on these early teachings, as preserved in the [[Pāli Canon]].

== In Indian Buddhism ==
=== Overview ===
Early Buddhism in India is generally divided into various monastic fraternities, or [[nikāya]]s. Conventionally numbering eighteen, the actual count varied over time. The doctrinal orientation of each school differed somewhat, as did the number of piṭakas in their canon. An example of this is the [[Dharmaguptaka]], which included a Bodhisattva Piṭaka and a [[Dhāraṇī]] Piṭaka.{{sfn|Baruah|2000|p=52}}

=== In the Mahāsāṃghika branch ===
The Mahāsāṃghika nikāyas generally advocated the transcendental and supramundane nature of the [[buddhahood|buddhas]] and [[bodhisattva]]s, and the fallibility of [[arhat]]s.{{sfn|Baruah|2000|p=48}} Therefore, for the Mahāsāṃghikas, the bodhisattva ideal and buddhahood was advocated over the ideal of becoming an arhat.{{sfn|Padma|2008|p=56}}

Avalokitavrata wrote of the [[Mahāsāṃghika]]s as using a "Great Āgama Piṭaka", which is then associated with Mahāyāna sūtras such as the ''[[Prajnaparamita|Prajñāparamitā]]'' and the ''[[Ten Stages Sutra]]''.{{sfn|Walser|2012|p=53}} In the [[Caitika]] group of nikāyas, the Pūrvaśailas and the Aparaśailas each were known to have the ''{{IAST|Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra}}'' in [[Prakrit]].{{sfn|Xing|2004|p=66}} Bhāvaviveka also wrote of the Siddhārthikas using a Vidyādhāra Piṭaka, and the Pūrvaśailas and Aparaśailas both using a Bodhisattva Piṭaka, implying organized collections of Mahāyāna texts within these Mahāsāṃghika nikāyas.{{sfn|Walser|2012|p=53}}

===In the Sthaviravāda branch===
In the [[Sthavira nikāya]], the Sarvāstivādins were a major nikāya. The [[Sarvastivada|Sarvāstivādin]] ''[[Mahavibhasa|{{IAST|Mahāvibhāṣā Śāstra}}]]'' is known to employ the outlook of Buddhist practice as consisting of three vehicles: [[Śrāvakayāna]], [[Pratyekabuddhayāna]], and [[Bodhisattvayāna]].{{sfn|Nakamura|1987|p=189}} References to the Bodhisattvayāna and the practice of the Six [[pāramitā]]s are commonly found in Sarvāstivāda works as well.{{sfn|Baruah|2000|p=456}}

The Theravada sect from [[Sri Lanka]] generally accepts the three vehicles, but categorizes these as three different types of [[bodhi]], or enlightenment.&lt;ref name="Bodhisattva Ideal in Buddhism"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/budsas/ebud/ebdha126.htm |title=Bodhisattva Ideal in Buddhism |accessdate=2011-02-20 |publisher=Access to Insight |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110318131023/http://www.buddhanet.net/budsas/ebud/ebdha126.htm |archivedate=March 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Theravada nikaya only uses the Pāli Canon, which has three piṭakas, and does not contain separate literature for bodhisattvas.&lt;ref name="Bodhisattva Ideal in Buddhism"/&gt; [[Walpola Rahula]] writes of this, "At the end of a religious ceremony or an act of piety, the bhikkhu who gives benedictions, usually admonishes the congregation to make a resolution to attain Nirvana by realising one of the three Bodhis - Sravakabodhi, Pratyekabodhi or Samyaksambodhi - as they wish according to their capacity."&lt;ref name="Bodhisattva Ideal in Buddhism"/&gt;

== Relationship to Mahāyāna ==

Jan Nattier writes that there is also no evidence that Mahāyāna ever referred to a separate formal school or sect of Buddhism, but rather that it existed as a certain set of ideals, and later doctrines, for bodhisattvas.{{sfn|Nattier|2003|p=193-4}} [[Paul Williams (Buddhist studies scholar)|Paul Williams]] has similarly noted that the Mahāyāna never had nor ever attempted to have a separate [[vinaya]] or ordination lineage from the Indian nikāyas, and therefore each bhikṣu or bhikṣuṇī adhering to the Mahāyāna formally belonged to one of these nikāyas.{{sfn|Williams|2008|p=4-5}} This continues today with the Dharmaguptaka nikāya in East Asia, and the [[Mulasarvastivada|Mūlasarvāstivāda]] nikāya in [[Tibetan Buddhism]].{{sfn|Williams|2008|p=4-5}}

=="Hinayana" and Nikaya Buddhism==
Many commentors on Buddhism have used the term [[Hinayana|Hīnayāna]] to refer to Nikāya Buddhism. However, that term is now generally seen as flawed:
* Hīnayāna, (literally "inferior vehicle"), is often regarded as an offensive or pejorative term.
* Hīnayāna was coined by the Mahāyāna, and has never been used by Nikāya Buddhists to refer to themselves.
* Hīnayāna as a technical term, indicated the vehicles of both the [[Sāvakabuddha]] and the [[pratyekabuddha]], whereas as a division of Buddhism, it refers solely to the individuals who follow the former vehicle, towards the achievement of Savakabuddhahood, while the Mahāyāna in the sense of the bodhisattva path existed within the early schools already.
* It is sensible to use a terms for a division of population which is ideally used by themselves, and failing that, at least not offensive to them.

According to Robert Thurman, the term "Nikāya Buddhism" was coined by Masatoshi Nagatomi of Harvard University, as a way to avoid the usage of the term Hinayana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thurman|first1=Robert|title=The emptiness that is compassion: an essay on Buddhist ethics|journal=Religious Traditions|date=1981|volume=4|page=fn 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Nikaya Buddhism" is thus an attempt to find a more neutral way of referring to Buddhists who follow one of the [[early Buddhist schools]], and their practice.

The term '''Śrāvakayāna''' (literally, "hearer vehicle" or "disciples' vehicle") is also sometimes used for the same purpose. Other terms that have been used in similar senses include sectarian Buddhism or conservative Buddhism. Note that nikāya is also a term used in Theravāda Buddhism to refer to a subschool or subsect within Theravada.

Like the term Hinayana Buddhism, the term Nikāya Buddhism focuses on the presumed commonality between the schools, and not on the actual schools themselves. This commonality is thought to be found in a certain attitude. The term "Nikāya Buddhism" tries to shift the attention to the more neutral issue of attitude concerning the authenticity of scriptures.

A concise analysis by the [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]], [[Reginald Ray]], summarises the mistaken and confusing use of the term "Hīnayāna" to refer to any contemporary extant schools:
{{quote|"Hīnayāna" refers to a critical but strictly limited set of views, practices, and results. The pre-Mahāyāna historical traditions such as the Theravāda are far richer, more complex, and more profound than the definition of "Hīnayāna" would allow. ... The term "Hīnayāna" is thus a stereotype that is useful in talking about a particular stage on the Tibetan Buddhist path, but it is really not appropriate to assume that the Tibetan definition of Hīnayāna identifies a venerable living tradition as the Theravāda or any other historical school[.]{{sfn|Ray|2002|p=240}}}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2995">'''Olen''' ({{lang-grc|Ὠλήν}}) was a [[legend]]ary early poet from [[Lycia]] who went to [[Delos]], where his hymns celebrating the first handmaidens of Apollo in the island of the god's birth and other "ancient hymns" were still part of the cult at Delos in the time of [[Herodotus]]:
{{quote|[[Arge]] and [[Ops|Opis]] came at the same time as the gods of Delos and are honoured by the Delians in a different way. For the Delian women make collections in these maidens' names, and invoke them in the hymn which Olen, a Lycian, composed for them; and the rest of the islanders, and even the [[Ionia]]ns, have been taught by the Delians to do the like. This Olen, who came from Lycia, made the other old hymns also which are sung in Delos.|Herodotus, ''Persian Wars'', iv.35.1&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus,[http://www.galileolibrary.com/ebooks/eu04/herodotus_page_595.htm, The Persian Wars], iv. 35.1.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The [[hieratic]] poetry of Olen is now entirely lost. [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] wrote, "The Lycian Olen, an earlier poet, who composed for the [[Delos|Delians]], among other hymns, one to [[Eileithyia]], styles her 'the clever spinner', clearly identifying her with fate, and makes her older than Cronos." (''Description of Greece'' 8.21.3).&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, [[s:The description of Greece (Jones)|The Description of Greece]], 1. 18. 5 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue 2nd century AD) "The Delians sacrifice to Eileithyia and sing a hymn of Olen."&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently Olen's hymn reflected the pre-Hellenic role of Eileithyia, whom Olympian mythographers like [[Hesiod]] recast as a daughter of [[Zeus]] and [[Hera]].&lt;ref&gt;See Herodotus, iv.35.1; [[Callimachus]], ''Hymn to Delos'', 305; Pausanias i.18; ii.13.1 "Olen, in his hymn to Hera, says that Hera was reared by the Seasons, and that her children were [[Ares]] and [[Hebe (mythology)|Hebe]]"; v.7.6 9 (mentions Olen's hymn to Achaeia); ix.27; x.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Delphi]]an [[Pythia]] [[Boeo]] attributed to him the introduction of the cult of [[Apollo]] and the invention of the [[Dactylic hexameter|epic meter]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Phylos/Hyperborea.html Hyperborea: Fabulous Land of the Far North], Theoi Project, theoi.com. Accessed 2012-5-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Many hymns, ''[[nome (song)|nomes]]'' (simple songs to accompany the circular dance of the [[Greek chorus|chorus]]), and [[oracle]]s, attributed to Olen, were preserved in Delos, revered as Apollo's birthplace. "The legend which was especially attributed to him was that of Apollo's sojourn among the [[Hyperborea]]ns."&lt;ref&gt;Peck, Harry Thurston, Harpers Dictionary of Classical Antiquities, Harper and Brothers, New York, 1898.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>/* History */ disapproved of? That would require a source imv. It suggests that Pope Pius VII thought Fr? already-Bp? Camus personally a bad choice. We don't know anything about that. What we do know is that the Pope was, at the time, refusing to consent to *any* of Napoleon's nominations as long as Napoleon held him prisoner (or sort-of prisoner). As this sufficiently explains the fact that he never became bishop, suggesting an additional personal disapproval would need to be substantiated.</comment>

==History==
Historically, today's territory of the Diocese of Aachen belonged to the [[Diocese of Liège]] and the [[Archdiocese of Cologne]]. The diocese was first created in 1802, covering the area west of the [[Rhine]] formerly belonging to Cologne, as well as parts from the dioceses Liège, [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Utrecht|Utrecht]], Roermond and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Mainz|Mainz]]. After the first bishop [[Marc Antoine Berdolet]] died in 1809, Pope [[Pius VII]] refused to commission the successor suggested by [[Napoleon]], [[Jean Denis François Camus]]. After the French rulership over the area, the diocese was abolished by the bull ''De salute animarum'' of July 16, 1821, and incorporated into the archdiocese of Cologne.

On August 13, 1930 the diocese was re-established by the papal bull ''Pastorale officii nostri''. [[Joseph Vogt]] was appointed as its first bishop.

==Major Churches==
[[File:Aachen Germany Imperial-Cathedral-01.jpg|thumb|Aachen Cathedral]]
The principal church of the diocese is the [[Aachen Cathedral]], of which the central part, the [[Palatine Chapel, Aachen|Palatine Chapel]], was built in 800 under [[Charlemagne]]. It was also the first German [[World Heritage Site]], inscribed in 1978.

The diocese has two churches that have been given the status of [[basilica minor]]ː
*[[Steinfeld Abbey|Steinfeld Basilica]], Kall-Steinfeld – 7 October 1960
*[[Basilica of St. Vitus, Mönchengladbach|Minster St. Vitus]], Mönchengladbach – 25 April 1973

'''Self-immolation''' is an act of killing oneself as a sacrifice. While usage since the 1960s has typically referred only to setting oneself on fire, the term historically refers to a much wider range of suicidal options, such as leaping off a cliff, starvation, or ''[[seppuku]]'' (also called ''harakiri'' — ritual disembowelment). Self-immolation is often used as a form of [[protest]] or for the purposes of [[martyrdom]]. It has centuries-long traditions in some cultures, while in modern times it has become a type of radical political protest. The British sociologist Michael Biggs compiled a list of 533 "self-immolations" reported by Western media from the 1950s to 2002, using the general definition (not just by fire), and including any intentional [[suicide]] "on behalf of a collective cause".&lt;ref name=biggs/&gt;

==Etymology==
The English word ''[[wikt:immolation|immolation]]'' originally meant (1534) "killing a sacrificial victim; sacrifice" and came to figuratively mean (1690) "destruction, especially by fire." Its etymology was from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''[[wikt:immolare#Latin|immolare]]'' "to sprinkle with sacrificial meal ([[mola salsa]]); to sacrifice" in [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]]. ''[[wikt:Self-immolation|Self-immolation]]'' "setting oneself on fire, especially as a form of protest" was first recorded in [[Sydney, Lady Morgan|Lady Morgan]]'s ''France'' (1817).&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford English Dictionary'', 2009, 2nd ed., v. 4.0, [[Oxford University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/immolate immolate], Oxford Dictionaries.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was Western media coverage of Buddhist monk [[Thich Quang Duc|Thích Quảng Đức]]'s suicide by fire in protest of the [[Buddhist crisis]] caused by the Vietnamese [[Ngo Dinh Diem|Ngô Đình Diệm]] regime in 1963 that introduced the word "self-immolation" to a wide English-speaking audience and gave it a strong association with fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thoughtcatalog.com/2011/in-terrifying-color-vietnamese-buddhist-monks-1963-self-immolation/|title=In Terrifying Color: Vietnamese Buddhist Monk's 1963 Self-Immolation|date=10 January 2011|publisher=thoughtcatalog.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2043123,00.html|title=A Brief History of Self-Immolation|date=20 January 2011|publisher=world.time.com |first=Josh|last=Sanburn}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alternative name ''bonzo'' comes from the same era, because the [[Bhikkhu|Buddhist monks]] who immolated themselves were often referred to by the term ''bonze'' in English literature before the mid-20th century, particularly when describing monks from East Asia and [[French Indochina]]. This term is derived from the Japanese word ''bonzō'' (凡僧) for a priest or monk, and has become less common in modern literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=bonze |title=Dictionary.com: bonze |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |accessdate=2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:The Burning of the Rajput women, during the siege of Chitor.jpg|thumb|The self-immolation (''[[jauhar]]'') of the Rajput women, during the [[Siege of Chittorgarh (1567–1568)|Siege of Chittorgarh]] in 1568]]

Self-immolation is tolerated by some elements of [[Mahayana Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]], and it has been practiced for many centuries, especially in [[India]], for various reasons, including ''[[jauhar]]'', ''[[sati (practice)|sati]]'', political protest, devotion, and renouncement. Certain warrior cultures, such as those of the [[Charan]]s and [[Rajput]]s, also practiced self-immolation.

The act of sacrificing one's own body, though not by fire, is a component of two well-known stories found in the ancient Buddhist text known as the ''[[Jataka Tales]]'', which, according to Buddhist tradition, gives accounts of past incarnations of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. In the "Hungry Tigress" Jataka, [[Prince Sattva]] looked down from a cliff and saw a starving [[tigress]] that was going to eat her newborn cubs, and compassionately sacrificed his body in order to feed the tigers and spare their lives. In the "[[Sibi Jataka]]", King Śibi, or [[Shibi (king)|Shibi]], was renowned for selflessness, and the gods [[Indra|Śakra]] and [[Vishvakarman]] tested him by transforming into a hawk and a dove. The dove fell on the king's lap while trying to escape the hawk, and sought refuge. Rather than surrender the dove, Śibi offered his own flesh equivalent in weight to the dove, and the hawk agreed. They had rigged the balance scale, and King Śibi continued cutting off his flesh until half his body was gone, when the gods revealed themselves, restored his body, and blessed him.

The [[Bodhisattva]] "Medicine King" ([[Bhaishajyaraja]]) chapter of the ''[[Lotus Sutra]]'' was associated with auto-cremation. In a previous life, 'Medicine King' Bodhisattva burnt his body as a supreme offering to the Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Williams|first=Paul|title=Mahāyāna Buddhism: the doctrinal foundations, 2nd Edition|publisher=Routledge|url=|year=1989|page=160|isbn=9780415356534}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Benn|first=James A|title=Burning for the Buddha|year=2007|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=0824823710|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Ohnuma|first=Reiko |title=The Gift of the Body and the Gift of Dharma |journal=History of Religions|date=1998|volume=37|issue=4 |page=324 |jstor= 3176401}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Lotus Sutra'' describes the Bodhisattva Sarvarupasamdarsana drinking scented oils, wrapping his body in an oil-soaked cloth, and burning himself. His body flamed for 1,200 years, he was reincarnated, burned off his forearms for 72,000 years, which enabled many to achieve enlightenment, and his arms were miraculously restored.&lt;ref&gt;({{cite book|last1=Kubo |first1=Tsugunari |last2=Yuyama |first2=Akira, trans. |title=The Lotus Sutra |date=2007 |publisher=Numata Center for Buddhist Translation and Research |location=Berkeley, Calif. |isbn=978-1-886439-39-9 |url=http://www.bdkamerica.org/digital/dBET_T0262_LotusSutra_2007.pdf |pp=280–284 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150521183528/http://www.bdkamerica.org/digital/dBET_T0262_LotusSutra_2007.pdf |archivedate=21 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Zarmanochegas]] was a monk of the [[Sramana]] tradition (possibly, but not necessarily a Buddhist) who, according to ancient historians such as [[Strabo]] and [[Dio Cassius]], met [[Nicholas of Damascus]] in [[Antioch]] around 13 ACE and burnt himself to death in Athens shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, xv, 1, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0239&amp;layout=&amp;loc=15.1.73 on the immolation of the Sramana in Athens (Paragraph 73)].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Dio Cassius]], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/54*.html#9 liv, 9]; see also Halkias, Georgios "The Self-immolation of Kalanos and other Luminous Encounters among Greeks and Indian Buddhists in the Hellenistic world." Journal of the Oxford Centre for Buddhist Studies, Vol. VIII, 2015: 163–186 [https://www.academia.edu/12679460/The_Self-immolation_of_Kalanos_and_other_Luminous_Encounters_Among_Greeks_and_Indian_Buddhists_in_the_Hellenistic_World]&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-immolation has a long history in [[Chinese Buddhism]]. The relevant terms are: ''wangshen'' {{zh|c={{linktext|亡身}}}} "lose the body" or {{zh|c={{linktext|忘身}}}} "forget the body", ''yishen'' {{zh|c={{linktext|遺身}}}} "abandon the body", and ''sheshen'' {{zh|c={{linktext|捨身}}}} "give up the body". James A. Benn explains the semantic range of Chinese Buddhist self-immolation. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;But "abandoning the body" also covers a broad range of more extreme acts (not all of which necessarily result in death): feeding one's body to insects; slicing off one's flesh; burning one's fingers or arms; burning incense on the skin; starving, slicing, or drowning oneself; leaping from cliffs or trees; feeding one's body to wild animals; self-mummification (preparing for death so that the resulting corpse is impervious to decay); and of course, auto-cremation.&lt;ref&gt;Benn, James A. (2007), [https://books.google.com/books?id=dWL6EEkL8goC Burning for the Buddha: self-immolation in Chinese Buddhism], University of Hawaii Press, 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The monk Fayu 法羽 (d. 396) carried out the earliest recorded Chinese self-immolation.&lt;ref&gt;Benn (2007), 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt; He first informed the "illegitimate" prince Yao Xu 姚緒—brother of [[Yao Chang]] who founded the non-Chinese [[Qiang people|Qiang]] state [[Later Qin]] (384-417)—that he intended to burn himself alive. Yao tried to dissuade Fayu, but he publicly swallowed incense chips, wrapped his body in oiled cloth, and chanted while setting fire to himself. The religious and lay witnesses were described as being "full of grief and admiration."

Following Fayu's example, many Buddhist monks and nuns have used self-immolation for political purposes. Based upon analysis of Chinese historical records from the 4th to the 20th centuries, Benn discovered, "Although some monks did offer their bodies in periods of relative prosperity and peace, we have seen a marked coincidence between acts of self-immolation and times of crisis, especially when secular powers were [[persecution of Buddhists|hostile towards Buddhism]]."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;(2007), 199.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, [[Daoxuan]]'s (c. 667) ''Xu Gaoseng Zhuan''(續高僧傳, or ''Continued Biographies of Eminent Monks'') records five monastics who self-immolated on the [[Zhongnan Mountains]] in response to the 574–577 persecution of Buddhism by [[Emperor Wu of Northern Zhou]] (known as the "[[Three Disasters of Wu#Second Disaster|Second Disaster of Wu]]").&lt;ref&gt;Benn (2007), 80–82.&lt;/ref&gt;

While self-immolation practices in China were based upon [[Indian Buddhism|Indian Buddhist]] traditions, they acquired some distinctively Chinese aspects. An "unburned tongue" (cf. [[Anthony of Padua]]), which supposedly remained pink and moist owing to self-immolation while chanting the ''Lotus Sutra'', was based on the belief in  [[Śarīra]] "Buddhist relics; purportedly from a master's remains after cremation".&lt;ref&gt;Benn (2007), 144–147.&lt;/ref&gt; "Burning off fingers" was a kind of gradual self-immolation, often in commemoration of relics or textual recitations. The Tang Dynasty monk Wuran 無染 (d. c. 840) had a spiritual vision in which [[Manjusri]] told him to support the Buddhist community on [[Mount Wutai]]. After organizing meals for one million monks, Wuran burned off a finger in sacrifice, and eventually after ten million meals, had burned off all his fingers.&lt;ref&gt;Benn (2007), 135–36.&lt;/ref&gt; Xichen 息塵 (d. c. 937; with two fingers left) became a favorite of [[Emperor Gaozu of Later Jin]] for practicing finger burning to memorialize sutra recitions.&lt;ref&gt;Benn (2007), 149–150.&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Buddhist mummies]]" refers to monks and nuns who practiced self-mummification through extreme [[self-mortification]], for instance, Daoxiu 道休 (d. 629).&lt;ref&gt;Benn (2007), 97.&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Spontaneous human combustion]]" was a rare form of self-immolation that Buddhists associated with [[Samadhi (Buddhism)|samādhi]] "consciously leaving one's body at the time of enlightenment". The monk Ningyi 寧義 (d. 1583) stacked up firewood to burn himself, but, "As soon the torch was raised, his body started to burn 'like a rotten root' and was soon completely consumed. A wise person declared, 'He has entered the fiery ''samādhi''." &lt;ref&gt;Benn (2007), 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ibn Sayyid Murad al-Husayni - Hindu Couple United on the Funeral Pyre - Walters W64919B - Full Page.jpg|thumb|A [[Hindu]] widow burning herself with the corpse of her husband (''[[Sati (practice)|sati]]''), 1657]]
James A. Benn concludes that, "for many monks and laypeople in Chinese history, self-immolation was a form of Buddhist practice that modeled and expressed a particular bodily or somatic path that led towards Buddhahood."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Jan Yun-Hua explains the medieval Chinese Buddhist precedents for self-immolation.&lt;ref name="jan"&gt;{{cite web|author=thichnhattu |url=http://www.buddhismtoday.com/english/vietnam/figure/003-htQuangduc.htm |title=The Self-Immolation of Thich Quang Duc |publisher=Buddhismtoday.com |accessdate=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Relying exclusively on authoritative Chinese Buddhist texts and, through the use of these texts, interpreting such acts exclusively in terms of doctrines and beliefs (e.g., self-immolation, much like an extreme renunciant might abstain from food until dying, could be an example of disdain for the body in favor of the life of the mind and wisdom) rather than in terms of their socio-political and historical context, the article allows its readers to interpret these deaths as acts that refer only to a distinct set of beliefs that happen to be foreign to the non-Buddhist.&lt;ref name="jan"/&gt;}}

Jimmy Yu has shown that self-immolation cannot be interpreted based on Buddhist doctrine and beliefs alone but the practice must be understood in the larger context of the Chinese religious landscape. He examines many primary sources from the 16th and 17th century and demonstrates that bodily practices of self-harm, including self-immolation, was ritually performed not only by Buddhists but also by [[Daoism|Daoists]] and literati officials who either exposed their naked body to the sun in a prolonged period of time as a form of self-sacrifice or burned themselves as a method of procuring rain.&lt;ref&gt;Yu, Jimmy (2012), [https://www.amazon.com/Sanctity-Self-Inflicted-Violence-Religions-1500-1700/dp/0199844909 Sanctity and Self-Inflicted Violence in Chinese Religions, 1500–1700], Oxford University Press, 115–130.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, self-immolation was a sanctioned part of [[Chinese culture]] that was public, scripted, and intelligible both to the person doing the act and to those who viewed and interpreted it, regardless of their various religion affiliations.

During the [[Raskol|Great Schism of the Russian Church]], entire villages of [[Old Believers]] burned themselves to death in an act known as "fire baptism" (self-burners: ''soshigateli'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Loren |last=Coleman |title=The Copycat Effect: How the Media and Popular Culture Trigger the Mayhem in Tomorrow's Headlines |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3B4lTTZE58oC&amp;pg=PA46 |location=New York |publisher=Paraview Pocket-Simon and Schuster |year=2004 |page=46 |isbn=0-7434-8223-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scattered instances of self-immolation have also been recorded by the [[Jesuit]] priests of France in the early 17th century.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} However, their practice of this was not intended to be fatal: they would burn certain parts of their bodies ([[limb (anatomy)|limbs]] such as the forearm or the thigh) to symbolise the pain Jesus endured while upon the [[crucifix|cross]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} A 1973 study by a prison doctor suggested that people who choose self-immolation as a form of suicide are more likely to be in a "disturbed state of consciousness", such as [[epilepsy]].&lt;ref name="Prins"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Offenders, Deviants or Patients?: Explorations in Clinical Criminology|first=Herschel|last=Prins|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2010|page=291|quote=Topp ... suggested that such individuals ... have some capacity for splitting off feelings from consciousness....

==Political protest==
{{see also|List of political self-immolations}}
[[File:Thích Quảng Đức self-immolation.jpg|250px|thumb|Thích Quảng Đức's self-immolation during the [[Buddhist crisis]]]]
Rather than give up their way of life, a number of Buddhist monks (including the most famous case of [[Thích Quảng Đức]]) immolated themselves by fire in protest of the [[Buddhist crisis|persecution of Buddhists]] under the administration of [[Catholic Church in Vietnam|Roman Catholic]] President [[Ngo Dinh Diem|Ngô Đình Diệm]] in [[South Vietnam]]. An important source of inspiration for the monks and nuns who self-immolated is the twenty-third chapter of the ''[[Lotus Sutra]]'' which recounts the life story of [[Bhaisajyaguru|Bodhisattva Medicine King]]. In this section of the Sutra, Medicine King demonstrates his insight into [[Śūnyatā]] and the selfless nature of all things by ritualistically setting his own body aflame, which burned for 1,200 years to demonstrate the immeasurable power of the [[Buddhadharma]]. [[Thich Nhat Hanh]] adds: "The bodhisattva shone his light about him so that everyone could see as he could see, giving them the opportunity to see the deathless nature of the ultimate."&lt;ref&gt;Nhá̂t Hạnh. (2003). ''Opening the heart of the cosmos: Insights on the Lotus Sutra''. Berkeley, CA: Parallax Press. p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

The widespread coverage of the self-immolations of the Buddhist monks in mid 20th century Western media established the practice as a type of a political protest in the Western mind. Self-immolations are often public and political events that catch the attention of the news media through their dramatic means. They are seen as a type of [[altruistic suicide]] for a collective cause, and are not intended to inflict physical harm on others or cause material damage.&lt;ref name=biggs&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Dying Without Killing: Self-Immolations, 1963–2002 |first=Michael |last=Biggs |title=Making Sense of Suicide Missions |editor=Diego Gambetta |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2005 |chapterurl=http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sfos0060/immolation.pdf | isbn=978-0-19-929797-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They attract attention to a cause and those who undergo the act are glorified in [[martyrdom]]. While the burning of vital tissue can be very painful during self-immolation, one criminologist surmises that shock or [[asphyxiation]] quickly make the event painless,&lt;ref name="Prins"/&gt; as do the onset of [[third-degree burns]] which destroy the [[nerve ending]]s. However, fire immolation does not guarantee death for the burned.

The example set by self-immolators in the mid 20th century did spark numerous similar acts between 1963 and 1971, most of which occurred in Asia and the United States in conjunction with protests opposing the [[Vietnam War]]. Researchers counted almost 100 self-immolations covered by ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Comprehensive textbook of suicidology |first=Ronald W. |last=Maris |author2=Alan Lee Berman |author3=Morton M.

As a protest against Soviet rule in Lithuania, 19-year-old [[Romas Kalanta]] set himself on fire in [[Kaunas]]. In 1978 Ukrainian dissident and former political prisoner [[Oleksa Hirnyk]] burnt himself near the tomb of the Ukrainian poet Taras Shevchenko protesting against the russification of Ukraine under Soviet rule.

The practice continues, notably in India: as many as 1,451 and 1,584 self-immolations were reported there in 2000 and 2001, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Loren |last=Coleman |title=The Copycat Effect: How the Media and Popular Culture Trigger the Mayhem in Tomorrow's Headlines |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3B4lTTZE58oC&amp;pg=PA66 |location=New York |publisher=Paraview Pocket-Simon and Schuster |year=2004 |page=66 |isbn=0-7434-8223-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A particularly high wave of self-immolation in India was recorded in [[Mandal Commission protests of 1990|1990 protesting]] the [[Reservation in India]].&lt;ref name=biggs/&gt; [[Tamil Nadu]] has the highest number of self-immolations in [[India]] to date.

The [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] has said he does not encourage the protests, but he has spoken with respect and compassion for those who engage in self-immolation. The Chinese government, however, claims that he and the exiled Tibetan government are inciting these acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=13 Mar 2012 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/tibet/9139760/Teenage-monk-sets-himself-on-fire-on-53rd-anniversary-of-failed-Tibetan-uprising.html |title=Teenage monk sets himself on fire on 53rd anniversary of failed Tibetan uprising |publisher=Telegraph |date=13 March 2012 |accessdate=29 March 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the [[Dalai Lama]] questioned the effectiveness of self-immolation as a demonstration tactic. He has also expressed that the Tibetans are acting of their own free will and stated that he is powerless to influence them to stop carrying out immolation as a form of protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/tibet/10117850/Dalai-Lama-doubts-effect-of-Tibetan-self-immolations.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Dalai Lama doubts effect of Tibetan self-immolations | date=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A wave of self-immolation suicides occurred in conjunction with the [[Arab Spring]] protests in the [[MENA region|Middle East and North Africa]], with at least 14 recorded incidents. These suicides assisted in inciting the [[Arab Spring]], including the [[2010–2011 Tunisian revolution]], the main catalyst of which was the self-immolation of [[Mohamed Bouazizi]], the [[2011 Algerian protests]] (including many [[2011 Algerian self-immolations|self-immolations in Algeria]]), and the [[2011 Egyptian revolution]]. There have also been suicide protests in [[Saudi Arabia]], Mauritania, and [[Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=205180|title=Self-immolation spreads across Mideast inspiring protest}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hogg_5xSMcj4xPppcXbCrFlycHBw?docId=CNG.e943001219a6d9ad02686ab0695962cb.431|title=Second Algerian dies from self-immolation: official}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incarnations==
It is thought{{by whom|date=December 2015}} that Serapis Bey was incarnated as a high priest in one of the "Temples of the Sacred Fire" on [[Atlantis]]{{clarify|date=December 2015}} who migrated to [[Egypt]] at the time of the destruction of [[Atlantis]].&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Mark L. and Elizabeth Clare  ''Lords of the Seven Rays'' Livingston, Montana, U.S.A.:1986 -Summit University Page 149&lt;/ref&gt; It is also believed that he was incarnated as the Egyptian [[Pharaoh]] [[Amenhotep III]] (who constructed the [[Temple of Luxor]] to the god [[Amun]]) &lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Mark L. and Elizabeth Clare  ''Lords of the Seven Rays'' Livingston, Montana, U.S.A.:1986 -Summit University Page 153&lt;/ref&gt; and also as [[Leonidas]], the King of [[Sparta]],&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Mark L. and Elizabeth Clare  ''Lords of the Seven Rays'' Livingston, Montana, U.S.A.:1986 -Summit University Page 150&lt;/ref&gt; who was killed in 480 BC defending the pass of [[Thermopylae]] against the invasion of Greece by Emperor [[Xerxes I of Persia]].
According to the teachings of Agni Yoga,&lt;ref&gt;Elena Ivanovna Roerich. Letters to America. In 4 Vols (1923-1952).  - T. 4.  - Moscow: Sfera, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Serapis Bey was in past lives the Roman King Numa Pompilius, the philosophers Confucius, Plato and Lucius Anneus Seneca. He is referred in the book Supermundane as "The Thinker".

==Ascension==
Adherents of the [[Ascended Master Teachings]] believe that Serapis Bey, after being killed as Leonidas in the battle of Thermopylae, immediately reembodied as [[Phidias]] (c. 480 BC - c. 430 BC), the greatest of all classical Greek sculptors.&lt;ref name="Life Book II"&gt;Luk, A.D.K..

==Identification with the Hellenistic deity Serapis==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Serapis.jpg|thumb|180px|Serapis. {{puic|Serapis.jpg|log=16 September 2009}}]] --&gt;
Serapis Bey has been identified by Theosophists and those adherent to the Ascended Master Teachings with the god [[Serapis]] who was the [[Syncretism|syncretic]] [[Hellenistic]]/[[Egyptian mythology|Egyptian]] [[god (male deity)|god]] used by King [[Ptolemy I]] as the [[god (male deity)|deity]] of his capital city of [[Alexandria]].&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Mark L. and Elizabeth Clare  ''Lords of the Seven Rays'' Livingston, Montana, U.S.A.:1986 -Summit University Page 156&lt;/ref&gt; Serapis was the patron deity of the [[Library of Alexandria]].&lt;ref&gt;Sagan, Carl ''Cosmos'' New York:1980 Random House Pages 20 and 21: Illustrations show Serapis presiding over the Great Hall of the Great Library of Alexandria&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function in the spiritual hierarchy==
[[C. W. Leadbeater]] wrote that many [[artist]]s are on the fourth ray of harmony and beauty, which Serapis Bey is said to oversee as Chohan.&lt;ref name="Path" /&gt;  In the teachings of [[Alice Bailey]] the fourth ray is called the ray of ''harmony through conflict''.&lt;ref name=fire1237/&gt; [[Ascended Master Teachings]] organizations consider Serapis Bey to be the Chohan of the Fourth Ray of Purity, Harmony, and Discipline.&lt;ref name="Life Book II" /&gt;

==Skeptical view==
The scholar [[K. Paul Johnson]] maintains that the "Masters" that [[Helena Blavatsky]] wrote about and produced letters from were actually idealizations of people who were her [[mentor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Paul K. Initiates of Theosophical Masters Albany, New York:1995 State University of New York Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Also see the article “Talking to the Dead and Other Amusements” by Paul Zweig ''New York Times'' October 5, 1980, which maintains that Helena Blavatsky's revelations were fraudulent.

This article describes the relations between the '''[[Seventh-day Adventist Church]]''' and other Christian denominations and movements, and other religions. Adventist resist the movement to full ecumenical integration with other churches, believing that such a transition would result in a renouncing of its foundational beliefs and endanger its distinctive message. According to one church document,
:"The ecumenical movement as an agency of cooperation has acceptable aspects; as an agency for organic unity of churches, it is much more suspect."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adventist.org/beliefs/other_documents/other_doc3.html Seventh-day Adventists and the Ecumenical Movement]. This is a "study document, intended for internal church use... released in connection with the [[General Conference Session]]" of 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Adventists have often been skeptical of other faiths. The [[Millerites|Millerite]] movement, which gave birth to Seventh-day Adventism, experienced rejection and hostility from the majority of North American Christian churches of the time. Early Adventists experienced similar hostility because of their unique views about the [[Sabbath in Seventh-day Adventism|Sabbath]]. They consequently came to see themselves as an obedient [[Remnant (Adventist)|remnant]] which was encountering the wrath of the dragon, as prophesied in {{bibleverse||Revelation|12:17}}. Subsequent developments in [[Adventist eschatology]] saw the Sunday-keeping churches identified with Babylon the Great ({{bibleverse||Revelation|17-18}}). A central aspect of the Adventist mission was to call people out of Babylon, and into the remnant church, as signified by the second of the [[three angels' messages]].

The ''Review and Herald'' (now ''[[Adventist Review]]'') October 12, 1876 contains an "amazing"&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.wwc.edu/staff/thomal/gleaner/baptist.htm A Non-Adventist Church We Can Trust&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.wallawalla.edu/~alden.thompson/text/gleaner/northwest_church_world_church/a_non-adventist_church_we_can_trust.rtf Another link for ''A Non-Adventist Church We Can Trust''] an rtf file accessed 03-21-2011&lt;/ref&gt; article on cordiality between the Adventist pioneers and the [[Seventh Day Baptist]]s. James White pointed out that the two bodies agreed on the two great tests of the Christian life, i.e. the divine law and redemption from its transgression through the Son. The main difference between them, White observed, was the question of immortality. Even though differences existed between the two groups, White recommended, "that there be no controversy between the two bodies." He continued, "we further recommend that Seventh-day Adventists in their {{sic|agressive|expected=aggressive}} work avoid laboring to build up Seventh-day Adventist churches where Seventh-day Baptist churches are already established..." He said it is much better to seek union with Seventh Day Baptists on the points they agree than to sacrifice that union by urging on them peculiar Adventist sentiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = White  | first = James  | title = The Two Bodies: the relation which the S.

While the Adventist church matured and institutionalized in the 20th century, opposition from other churches also declined. By the 1950s, Adventists and American [[Conservatism|conservative]] [[Christians]] were ready to begin a dialogue. A series of discussions between Adventist and conservative leaders led to greater understanding and acceptance on both sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Loren Dickinson|title=The Day Adventists Became Christians|url=http://www.spectrummagazine.org/library/columns2006/061102dickinson.html|publisher=Spectrum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even after these milestone events, however, Adventists continued to resist full ecumenical cooperation with other churches, believing that such cooperation would endanger its distinctive message.&lt;ref name="Beach"/&gt;

Bert Beach was the main Adventist involved with interreligious dialogue.

On January 22, 2007 church leaders voted to rename the Council on Inter-church/Inter-faith Relations to the Council on Inter-church/Inter-religion Affairs.&lt;ref name="name change"&gt;[http://news.adventist.org/data/2007/00/1169580280/index.html.en World Church: Leaders to Cultivate 'Relationship of Relating' Between Adventists and Major Faith Groups]. Adventist News Network. Retrieved 2007-10-17&lt;/ref&gt; This involved more than a change of name, representing a desire for increased dialogue with other religions.&lt;ref name="name change"/&gt;

== Religious liberty ==
{{see also|Freedom of religion|Separation of church and state}}
"Seventh-day Adventists believe that freedom of religion is a basic human right."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adventist.org/beliefs/statements/main_stat50.html A Seventh-day Adventist Statement on Religious Liberty, Evangelism, and Proselytism], an [http://www.adventist.org/beliefs/statements/index.html Official Statement] by the church&lt;/ref&gt; The Adventist church has been active for over 100 years advocating for freedom of religion for all people, regardless of faith. In 1893 its leaders founded the [[International Religious Liberty Association]], which is universal and non-sectarian. The ''Seventh-day Adventist Church State Council'' serves to protect religious groups from legislation that may affect their religious practices.

The church publishes the magazine ''[[Liberty (Adventist magazine)|Liberty]]''.

== Theological conferences ==
The church has two professional organizations for Adventist theologians who are affiliated with the denomination. The [[Adventist Society for Religious Studies]] (ASRS) was formed to foster community among Adventist theologians who attend the [[Society of Biblical Literature]] (SBL) and the [[American Academy of Religion]]. In 2006 ASRS voted to continue their meetings in the future in conjunction with SBL. During the 1980s the [[Adventist Theological Society]] was formed by Jack Blanco to provide a forum for more conservative theologians to meet and is held in conjunction with the [[Evangelical Theological Society]].

== Adventists and ecumenism ==
The Adventist church generally opposes the [[Ecumenism|ecumenical movement]], although it supports some of the goals of ecumenism. The [[General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists|General Conference]] has released an official statement concerning the Adventist position with respect to the ecumenical movement, which contains the following paragraph:

: "Should Adventists cooperate ecumenically? Adventists should cooperate insofar as the authentic gospel is proclaimed and crying human needs are being met. The Seventh-day Adventist Church wants no entangling memberships and refuses any compromising relationships that might tend to water down her distinct witness. However, Adventists wish to be "conscientious cooperators." The ecumenical movement as an agency of cooperation has acceptable aspects; as an agency for organic unity of churches, it is much more suspect."

: "The New Testament presents a qualified church unity in truth, characterized by holiness, joy, faithfulness, and obedience (see John 17:6, 13, 17, 19, 23, 26). "Ecumenthusiasts" (to coin a word) seem to take for granted the eventual organic unity and communion of the great majority of the churches. They emphasize the "scandal of division," as if this were really the unpardonable sin. Heresy and apostasy are largely ignored. However, the New Testament shows the threat of anti-Christian penetration within "the temple of God" (2 Thess. 2:3, 4). The eschatological picture of God's church prior to the Second Coming is not one of a megachurch gathering all humankind together, but of a "remnant" of Christendom, those keeping the commandments of God and having the faith of Jesus (see Rev. 12:17)." :

: "Adventists see the Bible as the infallible revelation of God's will, the authoritative revealer of doctrinal truth, and the trustworthy record of the mighty acts of God in salvation history (see [http://www.adventist.org/beliefs/fundamental/index.html Beliefs of Seventh-day Adventists: 1. The Holy Scriptures]). Adventists see the Bible as a unity. For many WCC leaders the Bible is not normative and authoritative in itself. The emphasis is on Biblical diversity, including at times demythologization of the Gospels. For a large number of ecumenists, as is the case for liberal Christianity in general, inspiration lies not in the Biblical text but in the experience of the reader. Propositional revelation is out; experience is in."  :&lt;ref name="Beach"&gt;{{cite web

==Interfaith dialogue==

=== Relations with Roman Catholicism ===
The official beliefs of the church ([[28 Fundamentals]]) do not mention the papacy or Roman Catholicism. An official statement "[http://adventist.org/beliefs/statements/main-stat42.html How Seventh-day Adventists View Roman Catholicism]" was released in 1997. Adventists are concerned about the institution of the papacy and the Roman Catholic Church, yet recognize many sincere individual Catholics.

[[Woodrow Whidden]] wrote, "we must forthrightly affirm that many positive things have taken place in Roman Catholicism". According to him, the papacy "is a mixed bag morally and ethically... All human organizations (including our own 'enfeebled and defective' denomination) are sadly sinful." He concludes, "the Roman Catholic religious system" or "papal Rome is still the great power envisioned in Daniel 7 and 8; 2 Thessalonians 2; and Revelation 13."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adventistreview.org/2000-21/story1.htm The AntiChrist: Is the Adventist interpretation still viable?] by Woodrow Whidden&lt;/ref&gt; See the companion article [http://www.adventistreview.org/2000-1525/story1.htm By Grace Alone?] by [[Clifford Goldstein]].

More moderate scholars... &lt;!--what is Jon Paulien's view, for example?--&gt; [[Progressive Adventists]] typically reject these traditional identifications. See ''Spectrum'' 27, issue 3 (Summer 1999): 30–52.

There was a number of meetings between Seventh day Adventist and Catholic theologians including now Cardinal [[Walter Kasper]] and Msgr John Radano. A short report by [[Ángel Manuel Rodríguez]] was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adventistbiblicalresearch.org/conversations%20with%20catholics/Catholic%20Conversation.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205035756/http://www.adventistbiblicalresearch.org/conversations%20with%20catholics/Catholic%20Conversation.pdf |archivedate=2008-12-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adventist [[Samuele Bacchiocchi]] was the first non-Catholic to have graduated from the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]].

=== Relations with Lutheran World Federation ===
There was constructive theological dialogue between the Seventh-day Adventist Church and The [[Lutheran World Federation]]. Conversations started in 1994 and ended in 1998. The main issues discussed and described by the final report published in 2000 included [[Justification (theology)|Justification by Faith]], Scripture and Authority in the Church and [[Eschatology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lutheranworld.org/What_We_Do/OEA/Bilateral_Relations/OEA-Lutheran-Seventh_day_Adventist.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217181744/http://www.lutheranworld.org/What_We_Do/OEA/Bilateral_Relations/OEA-Lutheran-Seventh_day_Adventist.html |archivedate=2007-12-17 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

Final report concluded that "Lutherans in their national and regional church contexts" should recognize the Seventh-day-Adventist Church no longer "as a sect but as a free church and a Christian world communion".&lt;ref&gt;Frank IMHOFF, [http://www.wfn.org/1998/05/msg00167.html ''Lutheran-Adventist conversations final report''] 1998 &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relations with World Alliance of Reformed Churches ===
There is active theological dialogue between the Seventh-day Adventist Church and the World Alliance of Reformed Churches. In 2001 report on dialogue has been published as well, among other statements it declared that: 

"We are happy to conclude that our conversation has been productive in a number of directions. We have affirmed the common doctrinal ground on which we stand, and we have specified some of the ways in which our teachings have developed over time. We have sought to dispel mutual misunderstandings concerning doctrine. We have eschewed the sectarian spirit, and have not questioned one another's status as Christians."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warc.ch/dt/erl1/22.html#txt5 ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524141853/http://www.warc.ch/dt/erl1/22.html |date=2011-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were also informal meetings between Setri Nyomi, general secretary of the [[World Alliance of Reformed Churches]] and Adventist leaders, Nyomi told them that he has experienced the positive witness of the Adventist Church.&lt;ref&gt; [http://news.adventist.org/data/2001/0983273666/index.html.en]{{dead link|date=January 2018}} &lt;/ref&gt;

===Relations with World Evangelical Alliance===
The first meeting with the [[World Evangelical Alliance]] (WEA) was in 2006. "Although we come from different religious traditions, there was much that we shared in common and was useful to both parties" said Angel Rodriguez. "The meetings were designed to gain a clearer understanding of the theological positions of each body; clarify matters of misunderstanding; discuss frankly areas of agreement and disagreement on a Biblical basis; and explore possible areas of cooperation. The group also enjoyed a visit to several sites in Prague related to Protestant reformer Jan Hus."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.adventist.org/data/2006/1155758784/index.html.en World Church: Adventists, Evangelicals Commence Dialogue in Prague&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Representatives from the WEA and the Adventist church met at [[Andrews University]] from August 5–10, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.adventist.org/data/2007/07/1187035841/index.html.en Adventist Church expects joint statement with World Evangelical Alliance].

The "[https://web.archive.org/web/20071012233622/http://www.worldevangelicalalliance.com/news/WEAAdventistDialogue20070809d.pdf Joint Statement...]" was released in September.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldevangelicalalliance.com/news/view.htm?id=1387 WEA - World Evangelical Alliance Est 1846&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relations with French Protestant Federation (FPF) ===
Seventh-day Adventist church is a member of [[Protestant Federation of France|French Protestant Federation]], now representing over 900,000 French Protestants and consisting of 17 churches.

"Now we can enjoy the same rights as traditional Protestant churches and we are considered theologically equal with other religious movements in our country," said Jean-Paul Barquon, secretary of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in France.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.adventist.org/data/2006/1144177838/index.html.en France: Joining Protestant Group Puts Adventists on Equal Theological Footing, Church Leaders Say&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relations with Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) ===
There was a meeting between delegates from Seventh day Adventist Church and [[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)]] at the Presbyterian Church's national headquarters in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] August 22 to 24 (2007) to affirm common beliefs and dispel stereotypes. 

“The Adventist church has a responsibility to clear up misconceptions other Christian denominations might have of us, and meetings such as this one give us an opportunity to do so,” said [[Ángel Manuel Rodríguez]], director of the [[Biblical Research Institute]][http://news.adventist.org/data/2007/1189109441/index.html.en].

=== Relations with Salvation Army ===
There is active dialogue and friendly relation between Salvation Army and Seventh day Adventist Church. Theologians from both denominations met several times [http://news.adventist.org/data/2005/1111000066/index.html.en].

"It was most important to see the very similar approaches to the Gospel message that we have; very compatible lifestyles and Christ-centeredness in The Salvation Army and the Seventh-day Adventist Church," Dr. Beach told ANN. "Adventists have always had considerable respect for the work of Salvationists, and I hope that in the future we would increase our knowledge of each other and our cooperation in meeting many of humanity's crying spiritual and material needs."[http://news.adventist.org/data/2004/1073998565/index.html.en]

=== Relations with Serbian Orthodox Church ===
In 2003 there was meeting in Belgrade between [[Jan Paulsen]] (president of the Seventh-day Adventist world church), [[Serbian Patriarch Pavle|Patriarch Pavle]] and [[Stanislav Hočevar]], Roman Catholic archbishop of Belgrade.

"Mutual respect must continue between the Adventist Church and the Orthodox Church in Serbia in order to protect religious liberty, Paulsen said. The conversation between the two leaders was informal, amicable and cordial, and covered brief exchanges on world affairs and also the Adventist position on health.

Paulsen also visited Stanislav Hocevar, Roman Catholic archbishop of Belgrade. The prelate's numerous questions about the faith and theology of the Seventh-day Adventist Church gave Paulsen an in-depth opportunity to explain the church's understanding of Bible teachings."[http://news.adventist.org/data/2003/1047408831/index.html.en]

=== Relations with World Council of Churches ===
While not being a member church of the [[World Council of Churches]], the Adventist Church has participated in its assemblies in an observer capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

World Council of Churches see Seventh-day Adventist Church as "a denomination of conservative evangelical Christians"[http://www.oikoumene.org/en/church-families/seventh-day-adventist-church].

=== Willow Creek ===
[[Willow Creek Association]] is an international, [[Evangelicalism|evangelical Christian]] association that runs workshops, conferences, and one large annual conference. According to one article, "Seventh-day Adventist pastors and church members have been attending these conferences for years".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Relation to other groups and individuals ===
Adventist theology is distinctly [[Protestantism|Protestant]], and holds much in common with Evangelicalism in particular. However, in common with many [[Restorationism (Christian primitivism)|restorationist]] groups, Adventists have traditionally taught that the majority of Protestant churches have failed to "complete" the Reformation by overturning the errors of [[Roman Catholicism]] (see also [[Great Apostasy]]) and "restoring" the beliefs and practices of the [[Early Christianity|primitive church]]—including Sabbath-keeping, [[Believers baptism|adult baptism]] and [[conditional immortality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title=Seventh-day Adventists Believe (2nd ed)
|publisher=Ministerial Association, [[General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists]]
|year=2005
|pages=189
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Adventist church is thus classified as a Restorationist sect by some religion scholars. On the same basis it may be associated with the [[Anabaptists]] and other movements of the [[Radical Reformation]].

Prominent Adventist evangelist [[George Vandeman]] affirmed other churches in ''What I Like About... The Lutherans, The Baptists, The Methodists, The Charismatics, The Catholics, Our Jewish Friends, The Adventists''.

Adventists typically do not associate themselves with [[Fundamentalist Christianity]]:
:"Theologically, Seventh-day Adventists have a number of beliefs in common with Fundamentalists, but for various reasons have never been identified with the movement... On their part, Adventists reject as unbiblical a number of teachings held by many (though not all) Fundamentalists..."&lt;ref&gt;"Fundamentalism" in ''Seventh-day Adventist Encyclopedia'', vol. 10 in the Commentary Reference Series, pp. 577–78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Johnsson, William G, "Are Adventists fundamentalists?" ''Adventist Review'' v158 (January 8, 1981), p. 14. McIver, Robert K., "Are Adventists fundamentalists?" ''Record'' v97 (December 12, 1992), pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt;

However [[Historic Adventism|one stream]] of Adventist thought is often considered fundamentalist.

Baptist [[Wayne Grudem]] wrote the foreword to Samuele Bacchiocchi's book ''Women in the Church''.

At [[Questions on Doctrine#50th anniversary conference|an Adventist conference]], Methodist scholar [[Donald Dayton]] described himself as a "sympathetic outsider". He affirmed Adventists for being ahead of their time on certain beliefs, although not necessarily entirely correct.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://qod.andrews.edu/docs/10_donald_dayton.pdf Some Reflections on Adventist Identity by a 'Sympathetic Outsider' on the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Publication of ''Questions on Doctrine'']" by Donald Dayton.

Anglican minister [[Geoffrey Paxton]] had significant interaction with Adventists, particularly with [[Robert Brinsmead]]. He lost his job as principal of the Queensland Bible Institute (now [[Crossway College]]) because of his association with Adventists.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://spectrummagazine.org/files/archive/archive06-10/9-3ford.pdf The Truth of Paxton’s Thesis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907042659/http://spectrummagazine.org/files/archive/archive06-10/9-3ford.pdf |date=2008-09-07 }}" by [[Desmond Ford]].

Defrocked Adventist minister [[Desmond Ford]] has presented sermons to a wide variety of Christian denominations.

Evangelical [[Tony Campolo]] has written about his positive experiences speaking on numerous Adventist university campuses in the forward to ''Adventism for a New Generation'' by Steve Daily. He presented at the first International Conference on Adventists in the Community, in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.adventist.org/data/2004/1097873199/index.html.en World Church: Campolo Critiques, Challenges at Adventists-in-the-Community Conference&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Martin E. Marty]] describes Adventism as trans-modern, as opposed to counter-modern fundamentalists.&lt;ref&gt;Martin E. Marty, ''Modern American Religion, Vol. 1: The Irony of It All'' (Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1986), 255–57. As quoted elsewhere&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other religions ==
This section describes the interaction between the Adventist church and other religions beside [[Christianity]].

The [[General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists|General Conference]] body [[Global Mission]] started in 1990 after a decision at the [[General Conference Session]]. The [Office of] [http://www.adventistmission.org/ Adventist Mission] was formed in 2005, as a merger of Global Mission and the Office of Mission Awareness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adventist.org/directory_of_organizations.html.en Directory of Organizations] from ''adventist.org''&lt;/ref&gt;

Global Mission has centers specializing in the study of [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Judaism]], [[secularism]]/[[postmodernism]] and [[Islam]].

=== Islam ===
See "[http://spectrummagazine.org/library/columns2006/060517whitehorse.html New Directions in Adventist—Muslim Relations]", a ''[[Spectrum (magazine)|Spectrum]]'' interview with Global Center for Adventist-Muslim Relations director Jerald Whitehouse.

[[Samir Selmanovic]], the pastor of [[Church of the Advent Hope]] in [[New York City]], was honored by the group [[Muslims Against Terrorism]] for his assistance following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], including holding a Christian-Muslim discussion at the peak of tensions.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.atoday.com/magazine/2002/11/new-york-adventists-cooperate-muslims-promote-peace New York Adventists Cooperate With Muslims to Promote Peace] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091125114059/http://www.atoday.com/magazine/2002/11/new-york-adventists-cooperate-muslims-promote-peace |date=2009-11-25 }}" by Robert Darken&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-religious organizations ==
As of 2009, a partnership between the Adventist church and the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) is being explored. According to one report, "While WHO has previously partnered with other faith-based organisations, this would be the first time it could extend official relations to a church denomination."&lt;ref&gt;"Potential Adventist–WHO partnership 'looks promising'" by Ansel Oliver/[[Adventist News Network]]. ''Record'' 114:29 (1 August 2009), p. 7. Another quote: "The conference also gave an opportunity for Adventist Church officials to meet with WHO representatives at its Geneva Executive Meeting Room, the first such meeting between WHO and a church denomination." While "some Adventists" cited concerns, "Most attendees seemed to favour a denominational partnership with WHO."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publications ==
''[[Ministry (magazine)|Ministry]]'' magazine is sent to over twice as many non-Adventists as Adventists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ministrymagazine.org/index.php Ministry, International Journal for Pastors : Welcome&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Shabbat Shalom'' describes itself as "The Journal of Jewish-Christian Reconciliation".

==Independence of Pakistan and India and after==

The temple became a refugee camp in 1947.&lt;ref name="City on the edge"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mag/2004/03/14/stories/2004031400190700.htm | title= City on the edge}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original images of Swaminarayan were removed and taken to [[India]] during the turbulent times of [[Pakistan Movement|independence]].&lt;ref name="ref2"/&gt; One [[murti]] that was originally at this temple is now located in Khan Village, [[Rajasthan]].&lt;ref name="ref2"/&gt; People who wished to settle in India from all over [[Sindh]] awaited their departure to India by ship at this temple.

==Festivals and events==
According to the Pakistan Hindu Council, [[Swaminarayan Jayanti]], [[Ram Navami]], [[Janmastami]], [[Vijayadashami|Dussehra]], [[Diwali]] and almost all of the main religious festivals are celebrated by Hindus in this temple.&lt;ref name="pakistanhinducouncil.org"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pakistanhinducouncil.org/temples.asp | title=Temples in Pakistan: Swami Narayan Temple Opposite Kmc M.A Jinnah Road Karachi. | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815034006/http://pakistanhinducouncil.org/temples.asp | archivedate=2012-08-15 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Holi]] is celebrated with the holi bonfire lit at the centre of the temple grounds, followed by the play with colours. Janmashtami is celebrated with singing [[bhajan]]s and sermons on [[Krishna]], while on [[Diwali]], devotees light lamps and candles to welcome [[Rama]] from his fourteen-year exile, at the end of which he defeated [[Ravana]] and young men burst crackers at the temple on the occasion.&lt;ref name = "TC"&gt;{{cite news|title=Pak Hindu community celebrates Holi in Karachi |url=http://newsagency.thecheers.org/World-news/news_16983_Pak-Hindu-community-celebrates-Holi-in-Karachi.html|publisher=The Cheers Magazine|date= 2008-03-23|accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Dawn"&gt;{{cite news|title=KARACHI: Janamashtami festival celebrated |url=http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/the-newspaper/local/karachi-janamashtami-festival-celebrated-589 |publisher=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]|date= 2009-08-15|accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "GP"&gt;{{cite news|title=Karachi: A place for all souls |url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/pakistan/091105/diwali-all-souls-karachi-pakistan-partition|publisher=[[globalpost.com]]|date= 2009-11-07|accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Holi]] festival celebrations that take place at this temple are the biggest in Karachi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hindus in Pakistan set to celebrate Holi|url=http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=423075&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=41&amp;parent_id=23|accessdate=21 March 2011|newspaper=[[Gulf Times]]|date=20 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gurdwara==
In the Swaminarayan Mandir complex in [[Karachi]], [[Sindh]], [[Pakistan]] where a small [[Hindu]] community lives, a [[Gurdwara]] has been created for the small [[Sikh]] community.

The Gurdwara Sahib houses three sets of Sri [[Guru Granth Sahib]] Ji in the Palki Sahib.  There are pictures of the Gurus and a small shrine devoted to [[Guru Nanak Dev Ji]].  There is a Hindu bell in the Gurdwara Sahib as well.

The whole compound is protected by a security guard to protect the small number of Hindu families.

{{Islamic Culture}}'''The event of Ghadir Khumm''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]]: واقعه غدیر خم) is an event that took place in March 632. While returning from the [[Hajj]] pilgrimage, the [[Islam]]ic prophet [[Muhammad]] gathered all the Muslims who were with him and gave a long sermon. In the sermon, Muhammad announced that [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] would be his successor. This sermon included Muhammad's famous declaration that "to whomsoever I am ''[[Mawla]]'', Ali is also their ''Mawla''."

The Islamic prophet Muhammad also described Ali with the leadership titles "''Imam''," "''Ameer''," and "''Khalifah''" in the lengthy speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Majd|first1=Vahid|title=The Sermon of Prophet Muhammad (saww) at Ghadir Khum|pages=17-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the sermon, the following verse of the Qur'an was revealed: "This day I have perfected your Religion for you: Completed My favor upon you, and have chosen For you Islam as your Religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Razwy |first1=Sayed Ali Asgher |title=A Restatement of the History of Islam and Muslims |page=274}}&lt;/ref&gt; This verse (the fourth verse of Surah Maidah, the fifth chapter of the Qur'an) was the last verse of the Qur'an to be revealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Razwy |first1=Sayed Ali Asgher |title=A Restatement of the History of Islam and Muslims |page=276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, after the sermon, Muhammad instructed everyone to pledge allegiance to Ali.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.oerp.ir/content/event-ghadir-khumm-0 The event of Ghadir Khumm] Retrieved 13 Sep 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
{{main article|Farewell Pilgrimage}}
Ten years after the migration and on the last days of [[Dhu al-Qi'dah]] (coinciding with 632 in the [[Gregorian calendar]]), Muhammad moved from [[Medina]] to [[Mecca]] accompanied by thousands of his followers. He only once attended Hajj rituals, a few months before he died. Since this Hajj took place in the last year of his life, he made his farewells to people. [[Ali]] was in [[Yemen]], preaching Islam, when he was informed about Muhammad's Hajj, so he moved towards Mecca together with some people and joined Muhammad before rituals began. When the rituals of Hajj were finished, Muhammad left Mecca for Medina together with other Muslims.&lt;ref name="Irshad"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Al-Shaykh Al-Mufid|first1= Muhammad|title= Irshad |publisher= Maktaba Basirati |location= Qom| page= 91 |url= http://www.noorlib.ir/View/fa/Book/BookView/Image/20869}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shaykh Tabrasi"&gt;{{cite book|last1=[[Shaykh Tabarsi]]|first1= Ahmad ibn Ali|title= al-Ihtijaj |publisher= Nashr al-Murtaza |location= [[Mashhad]]|volume= 1 |page= 56|url= http://www.noorlib.ir/View/fa/Book/BookView/Image/13413}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Event ==

=== Revelation of the verse of announcement ===
On Thursday the 18th of Dhu al-Hijjah in the year 10 A.H. (March 632), after the [[Farewell Pilgrimage]], the Muslims arrived at [[Rabigh#Ghadir Al-Khumm|Ghadir Khumm]]. The following verse of the Quran was revealed:

{{Quote
|text=O Messenger! proclaim the (message) which hath been sent to thee from thy Lord. If thou didst not, thou wouldst not have fulfilled and proclaimed His mission. And [[Allah]] will defend thee from men (who mean mischief). For Allah guideth not those who reject Faith (5:67).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yusuf Ali Translation|url=http://tanzil.net/#trans/en.yusufali/5:67}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

According to the verse, Muhammad was obliged to proclaim an important message. The verse clearly denotes the importance of the message, by saying that if he does not announce it, then he has not performed his mission. After revelation of the verse, Muhammad ordered the caravan to stop, and ordered those who had passed Ghadir Khumm to return, and for them to wait there until the arrival of those who were still on their way.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Both Shia and Sunni sources state that this verse relates to the event of Ghadir Khumm. According to Sunni traditional narratives, this verse was revealed during the event,&lt;ref&gt;[[Al-Suyuti]], from [[Dur al-Manthur]], based on the authority of [[Ibn Asakir]], Ibn Mardawayh and Ibn Abi Hatim, who narrated from Abu Sa`id al-Khudri&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|last=Al-Shahrastani|authorlink=Al-Shahrastani|title=Kitab al–Milal wa al-Nihal|publisher=Kegan Paul|location=London|year=1984|pages=139–140}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Tafsir ibn Abi Hatim Vol. 4 Pg. 1172 Hadith no. 6609&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The verse  67 of Al-Ma'ida chapter|url=http://tanzil.net/#5:67}}&lt;/ref&gt; and over 360 Sunnis traditional scholars have mentioned about Ghadir and its connection with the mentioned verse.&lt;ref&gt;Al Ghadir (Arabic: الغدير في الكتاب والسنة والأدب) (that is "The Ghadir in the Book, the Sunnah, and Literature") is a 20-volume book written by the Great scholar Abd Al Husayn Amini.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the way back to Medina from Mecca, Muhammad ordered his [[Sahabah|companions]] to stop at Ghadir Khum and delivered a lengthy sermon. The most well-known part of the sermon occurred when he raised Ali's hand and said, "whomever I am his Mawla, this Ali is his Mawla."&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaIslam"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Veccia Vaglieri |first=Laura|authorlink=Laura Veccia Vaglieri|title=G̲h̲adīr K̲h̲umm|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia of Islam, Second Edition|accessdate=28 March 2013 |publisher=Brill Online |url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/ghadir-khumm-SIM_2439| archiveurl=|archivedate=| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dakake&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dakake|first1=Maria Massi|title=The charismatic community : Shiʻite identity in early Islam|date=2007|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|isbn=0791480348|pages=34–37|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=02J6ly4-tMgC&amp;dq=dakake&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Abu Bakr and Umar heard this, they said to Ali: "O son of Abu Talib, you have become the Mawla of every male and every female believer, morning and evening, congratulations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tahir-ul-Qadri|first1=Dr Muhammad|title=The Ghadir Declaration|date=2005|publisher=Tehreek-e-Minhaj-ul-Quran|isbn=9693205138|page=26|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OWEUrmQoDEsC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=abu+bakr+congratulated+ali+ghadeer#v=onepage&amp;q=abu%20bakr%20congratulated%20ali%20ghadeer&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dhahabi|first1=Shams al-Din|title=Siyar A'lam Al-Nubala'i|publisher=Dar Al-Hadith|pages=623–624}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Al-Manaaw|first1=Abdur Raoof|title=Fayd Al-Qadeer|publisher=Dar al-Hadith|page=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A portion of a part of sermon is as follows:
{{quote|O people, Allah the Most Kind the Omniscient has told me that no apostle lives to more than half the age of him who had preceded him. I think I am about to be called (to die) and thus I must respond. I am responsible and you are responsible, then what do you say?' They said, 'We witness that you have informed, advised and striven. May Allah bless you.' He said, 'Do you not bear witness that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is His servant and Apostle, and that His Heaven is true, His Hell is true, death is true, the Resurrection after death is true, that there is no doubt that the Day of Judgment will come, and that Allah will resurrect the dead from their graves?' They said, 'Yes, we bear witness.' He said, 'O Allah, bear witness.' Then he said, 'O people, Allah is my Lord and I am the lord of the believers. I am worthier of believers than themselves. Of whomsoever I had been Mawla, [[Ali]] here is to be his Mawla.{{efn|''Man kunṫu mawlāhu fa-ʿAlī mawlāh'' ({{lang-ar|مَـن كُـنـت مَـولاه فَـعَـلي مَـولاه}}).&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaIslam"/&gt;}} O Allah, be a supporter of whoever supports him (Ali) and an enemy of whoever opposes him and divert the Truth to Ali.'}}

{{quote|O people, I will go ahead of you and you will arrive at my Pond (in Heaven) which is wider than the distance between Basra and San'a. It has receptacles as numerous as the stars, and two cups of gold and two of silver. I will ask you about the two weighty things that I have left for you when you come to me to see how you dealt with them. The greater weighty thing is Allah's book—the Holy [[Qur'an]]. One end is in Allah's hand and the other is in your hands. Keep it and you will not deviate. That other weighty thing is my family ([[Ahl al-Bayt]]) and my descendents. The Most Kind the Omniscient had told me that both of them, would not separate until they come to my Pond.}}

Another similar narration of part of the hadith goes as follows,
{{quote|O people! Reflect on the Quran and comprehend its verses. Look into its clear verses and do not follow its ambiguous parts, for by Allah, none shall be able to explain to you its warnings and its mysteries, nor shall anyone clarify its interpretation, other than the one that I have grasped his hand, brought up beside myself,(and lifted his arm), the one about whom I inform you that whomever I am his Mawla, this Ali is his [[Mawla]]; and he is Ali Ibn Abi Talib, my brother, the executor of my will (Wasiyyi), whose appointment as your guardian and leader has been sent down to me from Allah, the mighty and the majestic.&lt;ref&gt;[[wikisource:The Last Sermon of Muhammad by Shia Accounts|The Last Sermon of Muhammad by Shia Accounts]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Revelation of the verse of Ikmal al-Din ===
{{main article|The verse of Ikmal al-Din}}
According to Shia scholar [[Sheikh Abdul Hosein Amini]]'s work ''[[Al-Ghadir]]'', immediately after Muhammad had finished his speech, the following verse of the Quran was revealed:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=al-Bahrani|first1=Seyyed Hashim|title=[[Al-Burhan Fi Tafsir al-Quran]]|volume=1|pages=434–437}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Makarem Shirazi|first1=Naser|title=[[Tafsir Nemooneh]]|volume=4|pages=263–271}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sobhani|first1=Ja'far|title=Al-Iman va al-Kofr fi al-Ketab va al-Sunnah|volume=1|page=244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This day have those who reject faith given up all hope of your religion: yet fear them not but fear Me. This day have I perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion (5:3).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sunni Muslims believe this verse was revealed during the Farewell Pilgrimage of the Prophet Muhammad on the [[Day of Arafah]], the ninth day of [[Dhul Hijja]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tafsir Ibn Kathir Online|url=http://www.qtafsir.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=822&amp;Itemid=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Oath of allegiance ===
Only then, Muhammad left the rostrum, and gave the order for the establishment of a tent in which Ali would sit to receive the allegiance oath of Muslims. Thousands of people, group by group, including women, went to him and saluted and congratulated him as [[Amir al-Mu'minin]], commander of the [[faith]]ful. [[Umar|Umar ibn Al-Khattab]] was the first to offer congratulations.&lt;ref name="Irshad" /&gt;&lt;ref name= Hanbal &gt;{{cite book|last1= Ahmad ibn Hanbal|first1= Ahmad|title= [[Musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal]]|publisher= Dar al-Ihya al-Torath al-Arabia |location= Beirut| volume= 4 |page= 281}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= al-Ghadir&gt;{{cite book|last1=Amini|first1= Abdul Hosein |title=Al-Ghadir|publisher=Dar al-Kotob al-Islamia|location=Qom|volume= 1|pages=9–30|url= http://www.noorlib.ir/View/fa/Book/BookView/Image/13894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the completion of Muhammad's sermon, Umar said, "Congratulations to you, Ali! This morning has brought you a great blessing. Today you have become the Mawla of all believing men and women." At a later occasion when Umar was asked about his special treatment to Ali as compared to other companions, his reply was, "He is my master."&lt;ref&gt;Al-Bidaya wa'l-Nihaya, by [[Ibn Kathir]], vol. 7, p. 349, Cairo: Matba`at al-Sa`adah (14 vols)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fayd al-Qadir Sharh al-Jami` al-Saghir by [[Muhammad al-Munawi]], vol. 6, pp. 217–8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Al-Milal wa al-Nihal]] by [[Al-Shahrastani]], pp. 139–140, 1984, London: Kegan Paul, Muslim Sects and Divisions&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Manaqib by Ibn al-Maghazili, pp. 18–19, Beirut: Dar al-Adwa, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; Shias believe that, with Muhammad's approbation he recited verses in honour of Ali. The verse are recorded in [[Ibn Shahrashoub]] and affirms that ʿAlī was named as the successor of Muhammad on the day of Ghadir Khum.&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaIslam"/&gt;

[[Mir Sayyid Ali Hamadani]], writes in his book, ''[[Mawaddat al-Qurba]]'' in Mawadda 5, that many companions quoted Umar in different places as having said that Muhammad made Ali the chief and leader of the nation and that Muhammad announced publicly that Ali was their master. Umar was also quoted saying that on the day of that announcement, a handsome youth was sitting besides him and that the youth said to him, "Surely, the Prophet has bound a covenant which none but a hypocrite would break. So Umar! Avoid breaking it." When Umar told Muhammad about the incident, Muhammad said that the youth was not of [[Adam]]'s ([[Adam in Islam|Adem]]) progeny but was [[Gabriel]] ([[Holy Spirit (Islam)|Jibril]]) and was stressing the point about Ali.

It is also reported that Abu Bakr said to Ali, "Well done Ibn Abi Talib! Today you became the leader (Mawla) of all believing men and women." Abu Bakr, Umar, and Uthman are all said to have given their allegiance to Ali, a fact that is reported by both Shia and Sunni sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Shi'ite Encyclopedia|url=https://www.al-islam.org/shiite-encyclopedia-ahlul-bayt-dilp-team|website=Al-Islam.org|publisher=Ahlul Bayt Digital Islamic Library Project|accessdate=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Musnad Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, Volume 4|page=281}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=al-Razi|first1=Fakhr|title=Tafsir al-Kabir, Volume 12|pages=49-50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interpretation and analysis ===
The word ''mawla'' is significant in the first narration of this hadith, and can refer to a leader, client, patron, friend, partner, ally or numerous other similar relationships.&lt;ref name="BernardsNawas2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bernards|first1=Monique|last2=Nawas|first2=John Abdallah|title=Patronate And Patronage in Early And Classical Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RqdcXWARYCQC|year=2005|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-14480-3|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160501194910/https://books.google.com/books?id=RqdcXWARYCQC|archivedate=2016-05-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-seven (27) different meanings are given for the word ''mawla'' and hence the exact meaning should be derived from their syntactical and situational contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mutahari|first=Murtada|title=Wilayah, the Station of the Master|url=http://www.wofis.com/DownloadFilePage.aspx?fileName=asset/Books/046.pdf|date=2001|edition=Fourth|publisher=WOFIS|location=Tehran|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304080422/http://www.wofis.com/DownloadFilePage.aspx?fileName=asset%2FBooks%2F046.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the words "Imam, Ameer, Khalifah, Ulil-Amr, Sultan" which are very clear words to describe leader, the word "Mawla" is more ambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.al-islam.org/shiism-imamate-and-wilayat-sayyid-muhammad-rizvi/appointment-ali-explicit-or-implicit|title=Appointment of &amp;amp;#039;Ali: Explicit or Implicit?|website=Al-Islam.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170107003750/https://www.al-islam.org/shiism-imamate-and-wilayat-sayyid-muhammad-rizvi/appointment-ali-explicit-or-implicit|archivedate=2017-01-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.tr/books?id=3NVpAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT22&amp;lpg=PT22&amp;dq=mawla+ambiguous&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Lt1TPQB8bv&amp;sig=f3cNtewug0ANBqg7aCJvlxmuHCQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjU_fmQ7KzRAhVHXhoKHT6eBw4Q6AEIOTAG#v=onepage&amp;q=mawla%20ambiguous&amp;f=false Asma Afsaruddin, ''The First Muslims: History and Memory''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170106173448/https://books.google.com.tr/books?id=3NVpAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT22&amp;lpg=PT22&amp;dq=mawla+ambiguous&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Lt1TPQB8bv&amp;sig=f3cNtewug0ANBqg7aCJvlxmuHCQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjU_fmQ7KzRAhVHXhoKHT6eBw4Q6AEIOTAG |date=2017-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} However, Shias argue that the context of the sermon makes it clear that the word Mawla is meant as leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Zakee Kazmee|title="Misconceptions of Shi'a" - Ammar Nakhshwani Lecture at MIT|date=2011-04-24|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjLXvqqfIpY|accessdate=2017-04-10|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170411101416/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjLXvqqfIpY|archivedate=2017-04-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Muhammad did use the words "Imam," "Ameer," and "Khalifah" to describe Ali elsewhere in the sermon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Majd|first1=Vahid|title=The Sermon of Prophet Muhammad (saww) at Ghadir Khum|pages=17-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.yjc.ir/fa/news/6230473/%D9%85%D8%AA%D9%86-%DA%A9%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%84-%D8%AE%D8%B7%D8%A8%D9%87-%D9%BE%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%B5-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%BA%D8%AF%DB%8C%D8%B1-%D8%AE%D9%85 The complete text of Ghadir Khum sermon] yjc.ir Retrieved 22 Sep 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also noteworthy that the Prophet used many titles for Ali in the sermon. The words "Wali," "Mawla," and "Imam" were used over 27 times, indicating that Ali as the successor to Muhammad in a spiritual sense, as well as a political sense (as the word "Khalifa" was used three times in the sermon).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Majd|first1=Vahid|title=The Sermon of Prophet Muhammad (saww) at Ghadir Khum|pages=17-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the sermon established Ali's right as the political and spiritual successor to Muhammad.

According to some, the event of Ghadir Khumm took place because of a dispute between Ali and two sahaba in [[Yemen]] prior to the Farewell Pilgrimage.&lt;ref&gt;Wilferd Madelung, The Succession to Muhammad, 18.&lt;/ref&gt; When Muhammad found out about this dispute, he ordered his companions to never anger Ali. The dispute was thus resolved with Muhammad's statement before the Farewell Pilgrimage. This indicates that there was no need to gather over a hundred thousand people around to discuss the dispute after the pilgrimage, as the dispute had already been settled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=18 - The Life of Imam Ali: Ghadir Khumm - Dr. Sayed Ammar Nakshwani - Ramadhan 1435|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkAciGqyads&amp;list=UUtEAmTJT5VH5zBuarXbk1Yg|website=YouTube|publisher=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==

=== Rashidun Caliphate ===
{{see also|Succession to Muhammad|Abu Bakr#Election of Abu Bakr to Caliphate}}
After the death of Muhammad, a gathering at [[Saqifah]] elected [[Abu Bakr]], rather than Ali, to be the successor of Muhammad as the first [[Rashidun Caliph]]. This choice was disputed by some Muslims, who believed that Ali had been appointed as successor. This dispute led to the schism between Sunnis and Shias.

=== Umayyad Caliphate ===
After the [[First Fitna]]h, during the days of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]], when [[Muawiyah I|Muawiyah]] arrived (in Mecca) during one of his pilgrimages, accordingly, [[Sa`d ibn Abi Waqqas]] came to see him, and they happened to mention Ali. Muawiyah disparaged Ali. As a result, Sa`d became angry and said: "You are speaking of this man! I have heard the Messenger of Allah—peace and salutation of Allah be upon him—declare (On the day of Ghadir): "Of whomsoever I am the Mawla, then Ali is his Mawla." I have (also) heard him say: 'You Ali are to me in position that Harun was to Musa, except that there is no prophet after me (See [[Hadith of position]])." And I have heard him announce: "Today I am indeed going to hand over the banner to a person who loves Allah and his Messenger, and Allah and his Messenger also loves him."&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Majah, Sunan, Volume 1 Page 45, Cairo, 1952 CE,&lt;/ref&gt;

The dates of his birth and death are unknown. His early reign was marked by a brief interruption towards the end of the year 54 and a much longer one from 58 to 63 AD. In an agreement to resolve the [[Roman–Iranian relations#Relations_during_the_Julio-Claudian_dynasty|Roman–Parthian conflict]] in and over Armenia, Tiridates I (one of the brothers of [[Vologases I of Parthia]]) was crowned king of Armenia by the Roman emperor [[Nero]] in 66 AD; in the future, the king of Armenia was to be a Parthian prince, but his appointment required approval from the Romans. Even though this made Armenia a [[client state|client kingdom]], various contemporary Roman sources thought that Nero had [[de facto]] ceded Armenia to the [[Parthian Empire]].&lt;ref name="Redgate"&gt;{{cite book | last = Redgate | first = Anne Elizabeth| title = The Armenians | edition = First | year = 2000 | publisher = Blackwell Publishers Inc.  | location = Massachusetts | pages = 88–91 |isbn = 0-631-22037-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ascension==
Tiridates I was one of the sons born to [[Vonones II]], king of [[Media Atropatene]] and later king of [[Parthia]], by a Greek [[concubinage|concubine]].&lt;ref&gt;Assuming that the mother of Vologases, Pacorus and Tiridates was the same woman. [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9075687/Vologeses-I Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt; Virtually nothing is known about Tiridates' youth, which he spent in Media Atropatene. "Tiridates" means "given by Tir".

In 51 AD the Roman [[Promagistrate|procurator]] of [[Cappadocia]], Julius Paelignus, invaded Armenia and ravaged the country, then under an [[Caucasian Iberia|Iberia]]n usurper [[Rhadamistus]]. Rhadamistus had killed his uncle [[Mithridates of Armenia|Mithridates]], the legitimate king of Armenia, by luring the Roman garrison that was protecting him outside of the fortress of [[Garni|Gornea]].&lt;ref name="ANRW"&gt;{{cite book

Acting without instruction, Paelignus recognized Rhadamistus as the new king of Armenia. Syrian governor Ummidius Quadratus sent Helvidius Priscus with a legion to repair these outrages, but he was recalled so as not to provoke a war with Parthia.&lt;ref name="ANRW"/&gt;

In 52 AD King [[Vologases I of Parthia]] took the opportunity to invade Armenia, conquering [[Artaxata]] (''Artashat'' in Armenia) and proclaiming his younger brother Tiridates I as king.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' 12.50.1–2&lt;/ref&gt; This action violated the treaty that had been signed by the Roman emperor [[Augustus]] and Parthian king [[Phraates IV]] which gave the Romans the explicit right to appoint and crown the kings of Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;Augustus had also recovered the Roman standards held by the Parthians as a prize after the [[Battle of Carrhae]] during the signing of the treaty, thereby wiping a long standing stain on Roman honor. {{cite book |first = John | last = Boardman | title = The Cambridge ancient history | publisher = Cambridge University Press | pages = 158–159 | year = 1925 | isbn = 0-521-26430-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vologases I considered the throne of Armenia to have been once the property of his ancestors, now usurped by a foreign monarch in virtue of a crime.&lt;ref&gt;Vologases is referring to Vonones I of Parthia, and the sons of Artabanus II of Parthia, Arsaces and Orodes as the earlier Arsacids who sat on the Armenian throne.

Unable to continue fleeing, she asked her husband to end her life rather than be captured. Rhadamistus stabbed her with a Median dagger and flung her body into the river [[Araxes]]. Zenobia was not fatally injured and was recovered by shepherds who sent her to Tiridates. Tiridates I received her kindly and treated her as a member of the monarchy.&lt;ref name="Ehsan"&gt;{{cite book | last = Yarshater | first = Ehsan| title = The Cambridge History of Iran | year = 1983 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Massachusetts | pages = 80–83 |isbn = 0-521-20092-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rhadamistus himself returned to Iberia and was soon put to death by his father [[Pharasmanes I of Iberia]] for having plotted against the royal power.&lt;ref name="ANRW"/&gt;

==War with Rome==
{{details|Roman–Parthian War of 58–63}}
Unhappy with the growing [[Parthia]]n influence at their doorstep,&lt;ref name="Ehsan"/&gt; Roman Emperor Nero sent General [[Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo|Corbulo]] with a large army to the east in order to restore Roman client kings.&lt;ref name="Ehsan"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'', 13.9&lt;/ref&gt;  A Hasmonean named Aristobulus was given [[Lesser Armenia]] ([[Nicopolis]] and [[Satala]]) and [[Sohaemus of Emesa]] received [[Armenia Sophene]]. In the spring of 58, Corbulo entered Greater Armenia from Cappadocia and advanced towards Artaxata, while Parasmanes I of Iberia attacked from the north, and [[Antiochus IV of Commagene]] attacked from the southwest. Supported by his brother, Tiridates I sent flying columns to raid the Romans far and wide. Corbulo retaliated using the same tactics and the use of the [[Muški|Moschoi]] tribes who raided outlying regions of Armenia.&lt;ref name="Ehsan"/&gt; Tiridates I fled from the capital, and Corbulo burned Artaxata to the ground. In the summer, Corbulo began moving towards [[Tigranocerta]] through rough terrain and passing through the Taronitida (Taron), where several of his commanders died in an ambush by the Armenian resistance; however, the city opened its doors, with the exception of one of the citadels, which was destroyed in the ensuing assault.&lt;ref name="Lindsay"&gt;{{cite book |first = John | last = Lindsay | title = A View of the History and Coinage of the Parthians |publisher= Adamant Media Corporation  | pages = 83–84 | isbn = 1-4021-6080-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By this time the majority of Armenians had abandoned resistance and accepted the prince favored by Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'', 13.55&lt;/ref&gt;

Nero gave the crown to the last royal descendant of the [[List of rulers of Cappadocia|kings of Cappadocia]], the grandson of [[Glaphyra]] (daughter of [[Archelaus of Cappadocia]]) and [[Alexander, son of Herod|Alexander]] of [[Iudaea Province|Judea]] (the brother of [[Herod Archelaus]] and the son of [[Herod the Great]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | last =Tabor  | first =James D.  | title =The Jewish Roman World of Jesus  | publisher =Department of Religious Studies • The University of North Carolina at Charlotte  | url =http://www.religiousstudies.uncc.edu/jdtabor/john.html  | accessdate = 2006-11-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who assumed the Armenian name [[Tigranes VI of Armenia|Tigranes]] (his uncle was [[Tigranes V of Armenia|Tigranes V]]).&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, 12.3.35&lt;/ref&gt; His son, named [[Gaius Julius Alexander]], married [[Julia Iotapa (daughter of Antiochus IV)|Iotapa]], the daughter of [[Antiochus IV of Commagene]] and was made King of Cilicia. Nero was hailed vigorously in public for this initial victory&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'', 13.56&lt;/ref&gt; and Corbulo was appointed governor of Syria as a reward.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'', 14.36 This was a very prestigious appointment. Not only was Syria a wealthy province, it was also one of the largest.&lt;/ref&gt; A guard of 1000 legionary soldiers, three auxiliary cohorts and two wings of horses were allotted to Tigranes in order to defend the country.&lt;ref name="Lindsay"/&gt; Border districts were bestowed to Roman allies that assisted Corbulo including [[Polemon II of Pontus|Polemon]], Parasmanes, [[Aristobulus of Chalcis|Aristobolus]] and Antiochus.&lt;ref name="Lindsay" /&gt;

Vologases I was infuriated by the fact that an alien now sat on the Armenian throne but hesitated to reinstate his brother as he was engaged in a conflict with the [[Hyrcania]]ns who were revolting.&lt;ref name="Lindsay" /&gt;  Tigranes invaded the Kingdom of [[Adiabene]] and deposed its King [[Monobaz II|Monobazes]] in 61, who was a vassal of Parthians.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'', 15.1&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:ArshakuniArmenia150AD.gif|right|thumb|300px|Arsacid Armenia, 1st - 4th century AD]]  --&gt;

Vologases I considered this an act of aggression from Rome and started a campaign to restore Tiridates I to the Armenian throne. He placed under the command of [[spahbod]] Moneses a well-disciplined force of [[cataphract]]s along with Adiabenian auxiliaries and ordered him to expel Tigranes from Armenia. Having quelled the Hyrcanian revolt, Vologases I gathered the strength of his dominions and embarked toward Armenia.&lt;ref name="Lindsay" /&gt; Corbulo, having been informed of the impending attack, sent two legions under the commands of [[Verulanus Severus]] and [[Marcus Vettius Bolanus]] to the assistance of Tigranes with secret directions that they should act with caution rather than vigour. He also dispatched a message to Nero, urging him to send a second commander with the explicit purpose of defending Armenia as Syria was now also in peril. Corbulo placed the remainder of the legions on the banks of the [[Euphrates]] and armed irregular troops of the nearby provinces. Since the region was deficient in water, he erected forts over the fountains and concealed the rivulets by heaping sand over them.&lt;ref name="Lindsay"/&gt;

Moneses marched towards Tigranocerta but failed to break the defense of the city walls as his troops were unfit for a long siege. Corbulo, although eminently successful thought it prudent to use his good fortune with moderation. He sent a Roman centurion by the name of Casperius to the camp of Vologases I in Nisibis located {{convert|37|mi|km}} from Tigranocerta with the demand to raise the siege. Because of a recent locust storm and the scarcity of fodder for his horses Vologases I agreed to raise the siege of Tigranocerta and petitioned to be granted Armenia in order to achieve a firm peace.&lt;ref name="Lindsay"/&gt; Vologases I demanded that both the Roman and Parthian troops should evacuate Armenia, that Tigranes should be dethroned, and that the position of Tiridates I be recognized. The Roman government declined to accede to these arrangements and sent [[Lucius Caesennius Paetus]], governor of Cappadocia, to settle the question by bringing Armenia under direct Roman administration.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia  | last = Smith

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, Annals, 15.1–6,Dio Cassius, 62.20&lt;/ref&gt;

Paetus was an incapable commander and suffered a humiliating defeat at the [[Battle of Rhandeia]] in 62, losing the legions of [[Legio XII Fulminata|XII ''Fulminata'']] commanded by [[Calvisius Sabinus]] and [[Legio IV Scythica|IV ''Scythica'']] commanded by [[Lucius Funisulanus Vettonianus]]. The command of the troops was returned to Corbulo, who the following year led a strong army into [[Melitene]] and beyond into Armenia, eliminating all of the regional governors he suspected were pro-Parthian. Finally in Rhandeia, Corbulo and Tiridates I met to make a peace agreement. The location of Rhandeia suited both Tiridates I and Corbulo. It appealed to Tiridates I because that is where his army had beaten the Romans and sent them away under a capitulation; on the other hand, it appealed to Corbulo because he was about to wipe out the ill repute earned before in the same location. When Tiridates I arrived at the Roman camp he took off his royal diadem and placed it on the ground near a statue of Nero, agreeing to receive it back only from Nero in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Penny Cyclopædia of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge  |publisher = Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge| year = 1842 |location = Great Britain  | page = 496}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tiridates I was recognized as the vassal king of Armenia; a Roman garrison would remain in the country permanently, in Sophene while Artaxata would be reconstructed. Corbulo left his son-in-law [[Lucius Annius Vinicianus (son-in-law of Cn. Domitius Corbulo)|Lucius Annius Vinicianus]] to accompany Tiridates I to Rome in order to attest his own fidelity to Nero.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;

==Visiting Rome==
Prior to embarking for Rome, Tiridates I visited his mother and two brothers in Media Atropatene and Parthia. On his long trek he was accompanied by his wife and children and two of his brothers. His escort included an imposing retinue, comprising many feudal lords, several sages, 3,000 Parthian horsemen, and also a large number of Romans.{{sfn|Chaumont|1986|pp=418–438}} His route lay across [[Thrace]], through [[Illyria]], on the eastern shores of the [[Adriatic]] and [[Picenum]], in northeastern Italy. The journey took nine months, and Tiridates I rode on horseback, with his children and queen at his side.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dio Cassius]], 63.1.2&lt;/ref&gt; The children of Vologases, Monobazes and Pacorus also accompanied Tiridates I.&lt;ref name="Dio1"&gt;{{cite book |first = Dio | last = Cassius | title = Dio's Rome Vol. 5 | publisher = [[Kessinger Publishing]] | year = 2004 | isbn = 1-4191-1613-4 | page = 34 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cassius Dio]], a second-century Roman historian, described Tiridates I favorably at the time of his arrival: "Tiridates himself was in the prime of his life, a notable figure by reason of his youth, beauty, family, and intelligence."&lt;ref name="Dio1"/&gt; Nero greeted Tiridates I at Neapolis ([[Naples]]) in October, sending a state chariot to carry the visitor over the last few miles. 

According to Dio's account, Tiridates I refused to remove his sword as he approached the ruler of the Roman Empire (though as a compromise, he agreed to have his sword firmly fastened in the sheath, so that it could not be drawn).&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, 62.3.1&lt;/ref&gt; Nero was reportedly so impressed by this act that he ordered a [[gladiatorial]] games be staged in honor of his guest at Puteolis (present day [[Pozzuoli]], near Naples). The Armenian king himself had an opportunity to display his ability as a marksman by shooting an arrow through the bodies of two buffaloes.{{cn|date=November 2018}} [[Ethiopian]] women, men and children fought as [[gladiator]]s and [[gladiatrices]] at the games to impress the Armenian king.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wiedemann|first=Thomas|title=Emperors and Gladiators|location=London, United Kingdom|publisher=Routledge|year=1992|isbn=0-415-12164-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B7wzXCCsKiQC|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The climax of the ceremonies was reserved for the capital. Rome was profusely decorated with flags, torches, garlands and bunting, and was gorgeously illuminated at night with great crowds of people seen everywhere.&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;{{cite book |first = Naphtali | last = Lewis | title = Roman Civilization: Selected Readings: The Empire | publisher = Columbia University Press | year = 1990 | isbn = 0-231-07133-7  | page = 33 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the day after Tiridates I's arrival, Nero came to the [[Roman Forum|Forum]] clothed in triumphal vestments and surrounded by dignitaries and soldiers, all resplendent in expensive attire and glittering armor. While Nero sat on the imperial throne, Tiridates I and his retinue advanced between two lines of soldiers. Arriving in front of the [[dais]], Tiridates I knelt, with hands clasped on his breast. After the thundering shouts and acclamations excited by this spectacle had subsided, Tiridates I addressed the emperor:

{{quote|My Lord, I am a descendant of [[Arsaces I of Parthia|Arsakes]] and the brother of the Kings Vologases and Pacorus. I have come to you who are my god; I have worshipped you as the [sun];&lt;ref&gt;
&lt;div class="small"&gt;[[Edward Champlin]] notes: "When Nero entered with the senators and the guard, he ascended the Rostra and sat in his chair of state, looking back down the Forum in an east-southeasterly direction. That is, as Tiridates I approached him through the ranks of soldiers, the rising sun would have hit Nero full on the face, in all his triumphal splendor. The prince then addressed the emperor from the ground, looking up to him on the Rostra: "I have come to you, my god, worshipping you as I do Mithra." The important point—something Nero would know as an initiate, whether others did or not—is that for Zoroastrians the sun was the eye of Mithra, and Mithra was often so closely associated with the sun as to be identified with it: "the Sun whom they call Mithres," as Strabo puts it. Moreover, when Zoroastrians prayed in the open air, they turned toward the sun, since their religion bound them to pray facing fire. Thus, when Tiridates I stood in the open Roman Forum facing the sunlit emperor, and worshipping him as he did Mithra, he was in essence worshipping the sun. An ex-praetor translated his words and proclaimed them to the crowd. At this stage in Rome's history, very few of those present would have known who Mithra was, but there is a good likelihood that the interpreter relayed Tiridates' words as "I have come to you, my god, worshipping you as I do the Sun." For Nero, the marriage of Roman triumph and Parthian ceremony culminated in a splendid theatrical affirmation of his role as the new god of the Sun."&lt;/div&gt;{{cite book | last = Champlin  | first = Edward | title = Nero | publisher = Belknap Press | year = 2003  | isbn = 0-674-01192-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; I shall be whatever you would order me to be, because you are my destiny and fortune.}}

To which Nero replied:

{{quote|You have done well by coming here to enjoy my presence in person. What your father has not left to you and what your brothers did not preserve for you, I do accord to you, and I make you King of Armenia, so that you, as well as they, may know that I have the power to take away and to grant kingdoms.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, 63.5.2&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Tiridates I then mounted the steps of the platform and knelt, while Nero placed the royal diadem on his head. As the young king was about to kneel a second time, Nero lifted him by his right hand and after kissing him, made him sit at his side on a chair a little lower than his own. Meanwhile, the populace gave tumultuous ovations to both rulers. A [[Praetor]], speaking to the audience, interpreted and explained the words of Tiridates, who spoke in Greek.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first = Gaius | last = Suetonius Tranquillus |author2=Robert Graves |author3=Michael Grant | title = The Twelve Caesars | publisher = Penguin Classics | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-14-044921-3  | page = 220 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Pliny the Elder]], Tiridates I then introduced Nero to magian feasts (''magicis cenis'').&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' 30.6.17&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tacitus]] claimed that Tiridates I was also interested in all things Roman.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''[[Tacitus Annals]]'' 15.5&lt;/ref&gt;

Public festivities continued for some time after the coronation ceremony. The interior of the [[Theatre of Pompey]] and every piece of its furniture was entirely gilded for the occasion; for this reason, Rome thenceforth recalled that date as "the Golden Day." Daytime festivities were on a scale no less lavish than those of the night: Royal purple awnings stretched as protection against the heat of the sun. Nero, clad in green and wearing a chariot driver's headdress, took part in a [[chariot race]]. At the evening banquets, Nero, in gold-embroidered vestments, sang and played the lyre with [[zither]] accompaniment. Tiridates I was amazed and disgusted by Nero's extravagance, but he had only praise for Corbulo and expressed to Corbulo his surprise at his serving such a master.&lt;ref name="Dio"&gt;{{cite book |first = Dio | last = Cassius | title = Dio's Rome Vol. 5 | publisher = Kessinger Publishing | year = 2004 | isbn = 1-4191-1613-4 | page = 36 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He made no concealment of his views to Nero's face and said to him sarcastically: "Sire, you have a wonderful servant in the person of Corbulo."&lt;ref name="Dio"/&gt;

In memory of these events, the Senate honored Nero with the laurel wreath and the title of [[Imperator]], or commander-in-chief of the armies. No reception comparable to this in magnitude and splendor is recorded in the history of Rome. Besides the enormous sum spent in festivities, the Roman Government bore the entire cost of the journey of Tiridates I and his retinue, both from and to their homeland. Nero also made a gift to Tiridates I of fifty million [[sesterces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Kurkjian  | first =Vahan  | authorlink =Vahan Kurkjian  | title =A History of Armenia | publisher =[[AGBU|Armenian General Benevolent Fund]]

On his journey back to Armenia, Tiridates I viewed an exhibition of [[Pankration|pancratium]]. When seeing that one of the contestants fell on his back and was being beaten by his opponents, Tiridates I saw exclaimed: "That's an unfair contest. It isn't fair that a man who has fallen should be beaten."&lt;ref name="Dio"/&gt;

Later, Nero summoned the Parthian King Vologases I to Rome several times, but when the invitations became burdensome to Vologases I, he sent back a dispatch to this effect: "It is far easier for you than for me to traverse so great a body of water. Therefore, if you will come to Asia, we can then arrange to meet each other."&lt;ref name="Dio"/&gt;

It has been suggested that the visit of Tiridates I, an event that greatly impressed contemporaries, was adapted by Christians to become the story of the adoration of the Christ Child by the [[Three Magi]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Dietrich, „“Die Weisen aus dem Morgenlande“, ''Zeitschrift für die Neutestamentliche Wissenschaft,'' Bd. III, 1902, S.1-14; cited in J. Duchesne-Guillemin, “Die Drei Weisen aus dem Morgenlande und die Anbetung der Zeit”, ''Antaios'', Vol. VII, 1965, p. 234-252, p.245.&lt;/ref&gt; The Christian legend changed Rome into Bethlehem, the birthplace of the Ruler of the coming Kingdom of God, and replaced Tiridates I with that contemporary king who was already connected with Christianity through the [[Acts of St. Thomas]]: [[Gondophares]], otherwise known as Kaspar.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Herzfeld, ''Archaeological History of Iran,'' London, Oxford University Press for the British Academy, 1935, pp.65-66.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fragile peace==
[[File:Greek inscription of Tiridates I, Garni.jpg|thumb|Greek inscription attributed to Tiridates I on basalt rock from the [[Temple of Garni]].]]

Peace prevailed at this time throughout the Roman Empire. Nero therefore closed the gates of the [[Temple of Janus (Roman Forum)|Temple of Janus]], which were never shut save in times of universal peace. When Tiridates I returned to Armenia, he took with him a great number of skilled artisans for the reconstruction of Artaxata. He renamed the capital Neronia in honor of the emperor;&lt;ref name="Bourn"&gt;{{cite book |first = George | last = Bournoutian |authorlink=George Bournoutian | title = A Concise History of the Armenian People | publisher = Mazda Publishers | year = 2002 | isbn = 1-56859-141-1  | page = 42 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he embellished the royal residence at [[Garni]],&lt;ref&gt;The Greek inscription found in Garni in 1945 refers to Tiridates I as [[Helios]] and supreme ruler of [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Greater Armenia]]. On the basis of building techniques and paleography, scholars generally continue identifying Tiridates I with the inscription. However, R. D. Wilkinson believes that the Tiridates I mentioned in the inscription was not Tiridates I.{{cite journal|last =Joyce|first =Reynolds|title =Roman Inscriptions 1966–1970|journal =The Journal of Roman Studies|volume =61|pages =152|publisher =Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies|year =1971|doi =10.2307/300013|jstor =300013}}&lt;/ref&gt; nearby, with colonnades and monuments of dazzling richness and also the addition of a new temple. Trade between the two continents also grew, allowing Armenia to secure its independence from Rome.&lt;ref name="Bourn"/&gt; Rome now counted upon Armenia as a loyal ally, even after Nero's death and through the entire duration of [[Vespasian]]'s rule in the East. Peace was a considerable victory for Nero politically.&lt;ref&gt;Dio Cassius, ''Roman History'', 62.23&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Nero closedJanus.jpg|thumb|left|Roman coin struck in 66 AD under Nero's reign depicting the gates of the Temple of Janus closed.]]
The immediate dividend of the peace was Rome's ability to turn its full attention to the mounting problems at Judea, which broke into open warfare culminating in the [[First Jewish–Roman War]] just one year after Tiridates' coronation. Large numbers of legions were diverted to Judea from Syria, which would otherwise have been impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first = David | last = Shotter | title = Nero | publisher = Routledge (UK) | pages = 39–40 | year = 1997 | isbn = 0-415-31942-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nero became very popular in the eastern provinces of Rome and with the Armenians and Parthians. The name of [[Legio XII Fulminata]] discovered carved on a mountain in [[Gobustan National Park|Gobustan]] (in modern [[Azerbaijan]]), attests to the presence of Roman soldiers by the shores of the [[Caspian Sea]] in 89 AD, farther east than any previously known Roman inscription.&lt;ref name="Lewis"/&gt; The peace between Parthia and Rome lasted 50 years, until emperor [[Trajan]] invaded Armenia in 114.&lt;ref&gt;Dio Cassius 68.17.2–3&lt;/ref&gt;

==War with Alans and aftermath==
In 72 the [[Alans]], a warlike nomadic [[Sarmatian]] tribe, made an incursion into Media Atropatene as well as various districts of northern Armenia. Tiridates I and his brother [[Pacorus II|Pacorus]], King of Media Atropatene, faced them at a number of battles, during one of which Tiridates I was briefly captured, narrowly escaping being taken alive. He was lassoed from a distance and caught, but he quickly managed to whip out his sword and slash the rope in time. The Alans withdrew with a lot of booty after plundering Armenia and Media Atropatene.&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]], ''[[Jewish Wars]]'' 7.7.4&lt;/ref&gt; The King of Iberia asked for protection against the Alans from [[Vespasian]], who helped reconstruct the fortress of [[Harmozica]] around the Iberian capital [[Mtskheta]], near modern [[Tbilisi]]. An Aramaic inscription found near Tbilisi indicates that Tiridates I also warred with Iberia during his final years. The exact date of the end of Tiridates I's reign is unknown; various sources name Sanatruces as his successor.&lt;ref&gt;Both Classical Greco-Roman and Armenian sources from the [[Late Antiquity]] mention Sanatruces (Sanatruk in Armenian), in Armenian sources he is identified with the martyrdom of [[Saint Jude|Thaddeus]]. Professor Nina Garsoian, Emerita of Columbia University, states that there is no explicit evidence naming Sanatruces as Tiridates' successor.{{cite book|last =Hovannisian|first =Richard G.|title =The Armenian people from ancient to modern times: from antiquity to the fourteenth century|publisher =Palgrave Macmillan|year =1997|isbn =0-312-10168-6|page =69}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is known that Tiridates' nephew, Axidares, the son of Pacorus II of Parthia, was King of Armenia by 110.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v2f4/v2f4a071a.html ARMENIA AND IRAN:b.

[[Franz Cumont]] in ''Les Réligions Orientales dans le Paganisme Romain'' ("The Oriental Religions in Roman Paganism") pointed out that Tiridates I was instrumental in the development of [[Mithraism]] in Rome, which ultimately became the most dominant Roman religion throughout the empire.&lt;ref name="Cumont"/&gt;

Tiridates I is one of the principal characters in [[George Frideric Handel]]'s opera ''[[Radamisto (Handel)|Radamisto]]'' and [[Reinhard Keiser]]'s opera ''[[Octavia (opera)|Octavia]].''

The [[Navajo people|Navajo]] '''yeii''' or '''yei''' ({{lang-nv|{{spell-nv|yéí}} or {{spell-nv|yéʼii}}}})  spirit deity of the Navajo Nation. The most benevolent of such beings are the Diyin Diné'e or Holy People who are associated with the forces of nature.

{{Quote|''Yéi''—There are a number of divinities in the Navaho pantheon known as yéi...which is translated "god" or "genius." What distinction exists between the yéi and other gods is not easy to determine definitely. The [[Zuñi]]ans have a class of gods called by the same name, or more correctly, "yéyi,"... Certain chiefs or important personages among these gods are called by names which begin with the syllables ''h''ast''s''é—as ''H''asi''s''éyal''t''i (Talking God), ''H''ast''s''é''h''o''g''an (House God). It is believed that this, if spelled etymologically, would appear as ''h''astyé, but it is not so pronounced. ''H''ast is a prefix denoting age, especially venerable age. We have it in the word ''h''as''t''í''n'', which means a worthy or respected old man. ''H''astyé would mean a venerable yéi or god. The yéi seem to be deities of minor importance to those previously mentioned and to be more numerous. Thus, while there is but one [[Estsánatlehi]], but one Nayénĕzgạni, and but one ''T''o'bad''s''ĭst''s''íni there are several ''H''ast''s''é''h''ogan and several ''H''a''s''tséyal''t''i, who are chiefs of the yéi. The yéi are supposed to abid in certain localities, and in prayers in their honor the home is mentioned of the yéi to whom appeal is specially made. ...The yéi are supposed to be married and have families. The males are called yébaka; the females, yébaad. ''H''ast''s''é''z''ĭni, the god of fire, and ''H''ast''s''éol''t''oi, the divine huntress, or goddess of the chase, belong, as their names indicate, to the yéi; whil Gá''n''askĭ''d''i, the harvest god and [[Tó'nenĭli|''T''ó'nenĭli]], Water Sprinkler, are associated with them in the legends.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, Washington. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ATNCAAAAIAAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Navaho Legends]'', Vol. V, p.35-7. Boston; New York: Pub. for the American Folk-Lore Society by Houghton, Mifflin &amp; Co.: 1897; New York: Kraus Reprint, 1969.&lt;!--(Note: specifically see P35-38 in "Google books" digitized copy)--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Yei bichei''' ('''Yébîchai'''), or "maternal grandfather of the yei", is another name of [[Diné Bahaneʼ|Talking God]] who often speaks on behalf of the other Holy People. (He, along with Growling God, Black God, and [[Tonenili|Water Sprinkler]], were the first four Holy People encountered by the Navajo.)  He is invoked (along with eight other male yei) in the "Night Chant" or "Nightway" (Navajo: {{spell-nv|Tłʼééʼjí}} or '''Kléjê Hatál'''), sometimes simply called "Yei bichei," a nine-night ceremony in which masked dancers personify the gods.

A rainbow yei, sometimes considered an aspect of the rain-god Water Sprinkler, is drawn around every sandpainting; his body curls around the south, west, and north sides to protect the painting from outside influences, and to protect the user from the power of the god depicted in the painting. He does not need to cover the east, because no evil can come from the east in Navajo thought.

'''Zeved habat''' ({{Lang-he|'''זֶבֶד הַבָּת'''}}), mostly known as '''brita''' (Hebrew: {{Lang|he|בריתה}}), and often as '''simchat bat''' (Hebrew: {{Lang|he|שמחת בת}}) is a [[Jewish]] [[naming ceremony]] for [[newborn]] [[girl]]s.

==Ashkenazi custom==
In the [[Ashkenazi]] community, [[namegiving]] ceremonies for newborn girls were not widespread and often limited to the father announcing the baby's name in the synagogue on the [[Shabbat]], Monday, Thursday or other occasion when the [[Torah]] would be [[Torah reading|read]] following the birth. Sometimes a [[kiddush]] will be held at the synagogue for family and friends. Although ceremonies can be found in Ashkenazic sources. Rabbi [[Jacob Emden|Yacov Emden]] includes a text in his famous prayer book{{specify|if it is referring to the  the [[siddur]] (prayer book) titled ''[[Jacob Emden#Stance on polygamy and concubines|Ammudei Shamayim]]'', the (linked) en.wikipedia's article doesn't mention nor source any description of the rite. Also, the siddur is told to be the book for daily prayers, not reporting unique non-repeated rites like naming ones|date=July 2018}}.

In the 20th century, interest in traditional ceremonies for welcoming baby girls has been revived, and new ceremonies have evolved. These ceremonies are often known under the [[neologism|newly coined terms]] ''simchat bat'' or a ''brit bat''{{citation needed|reason=religious rites have a long-time tradition and Jewish culture marks the importance of names with their related significance. Similar changing must be approved by a (religious) authority, even if they start appearing in the daily language|date=July 2018}}. There is no explicit source in the [[Mishnah]] or [[Talmud]] specifying when girls should be named.

In medieval times, girls were named during ''shavua habat'' (lit. 'week of the daughter'). In early German Jewish communities, a baby naming ceremony was developed for both girls and boys called a ''Hollekreisch'' (of unknown derivation, possibly meaning 'secular shout'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pregnancy-info.net/hollekreisch-ceremony.html |title=Hollekreisch Ceremony |publisher=Pregnancy-Info.net |access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;), in which the children received their secular names. The ritual took place after Shabbat lunch. The babies were dressed up, and boys were draped in a [[tallit]]. The book of [[Vayikra]] (Leviticus) was placed in the crib. The crib would then be lifted up and the following recited in [[German language|German]]: "Hollekreisch! How shall the baby be called? So-and-so So-and-so So-and-so (i.e. his or her name three times)." Nuts, sweets and fruits were then distributed to the guests. The custom applied to both boys (who had already received their Hebrew names at their [[brit mila]]) and girls. This ceremony was widely observed in Jewish circles in [[Germany]] as early as the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Trachtenberg|first=Joshua|title=Jewish Magic and Superstition|location=Philadelphia|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]]|year=2004|origyear=Originally published 1939|isbn=9780812218626|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century this custom was observed in naming boys and girls only in [[South Germany]], while in [[Austria]], [[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]] and [[Poland]] it was not used for boys, and only rarely for girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Trachtenberg|first=Joshua|title=Jewish Magic and Superstition|location=Philadelphia|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]]|year=2004|origyear=Originally published 1939|isbn=9780812218626|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|the introduction tells it is a ritual ceremony for females|date=July 2018}}

==Sephardi custom==
In the [[Sephardi]] community the zeved habat is usually celebrated within the first month of the  birth. It is held privately in the [[synagogue]] or at a party at home. It is often led by the ''[[Hakham|ḥakhám]]''  or [[hazzan]]. The main elements of the ceremony are the mother's thanksgiving for deliverance (Birkat HaGomel); the recital of [[Song of Songs]] {{Bibleverse-nb|song|2:14|JPS}} (and, in the case of the first daughter born to the mother, Song of Songs {{Bibleverse-nb|song|6:9|JPS}}); and the namegiving prayer itself in the form of ''Mi sheberakh (imoteinu)'' (see below). Additional elements may include [[Psalm 128]] and the [[Priestly Blessing]] (Birkat kohanim).

{{Quotation|
The one Who blessed (our mothers,)
Sarah and Rivkah, Rachel and Leah, and the prophet Miriam and Abigayil
and Queen Esther, daughter of Abichayil —
may He bless this beloved girl and let her name (in Israel) be ... ''[name]''
with good luck and in a blessed hour;
and may she grow up with good health, peace and tranquility;
and may her father and her mother merit to see
her joy and her wedding, and male children, riches and honour;
and may they be vigorous and fresh, fruitful into old age;
and so may this be the will, and let it be said, Amen!.
&lt;ref&gt;See Psalm {{Bibleverse-nb|ps|92:15|JPS}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Many Ashkenazi communities use a prayer for the health of a mother and newborn, recited by someone called up to read from the Torah scroll, as an opportunity to name a baby girl.&lt;ref name="artscroll ashkenaz"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nosson|first1=Scherman|title=The Complete Artscroll Siddur|date=1992|publisher=Mesorah Publications|location=Brooklyn, New York|isbn=978-0-89906-654-7|pages=442–443|edition=4th Imprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|
{{he p|מי שברך אבותינו אברהם יצחק ויעקב, הוא יברך את האשה היולדת () בת () ואת בתה הנולדה לה במזל טוב, ויקרא שמה בישראל () בת () בעבור שבעלה ואביה יתן לצדקה. בשכר זה יגדלה לתורה לחפה ולמעשים טובים. ונאמר: אמן.}}

He Who blessed our forefathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob - may He bless the woman who has given birth (new mother's Hebrew name) daughter of (her father's Hebrew name) with her daughter who has been born at an auspicious time, and may her name be called in Israel (baby's Hebrew name) daughter of (baby's father's Hebrew name), for her husband, the infant's father, will contribute to charity on their behalf. In reward for this, may they raise her to Torah, marriage and good deeds. Now let us respond: amen.&lt;ref name="artscroll ashkenaz" /&gt;}}

==New ceremonies==
The ''Simchat Bat'' ("celebration of the daughter") or ''Brit Bat'' (loosely, welcoming the new daughter into the covenant) are now becoming more common. The [[celebration (party)|celebration]] typically consists of a communal welcoming, a naming done over a cup of wine with the quotation of appropriate Biblical verses, and traditional blessings.

"''Moreh Derekh''", the [[Rabbi]]'s manual of the [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] movement's [[Rabbinical Assembly]], presents a ceremony based on traditional Jewish forms, with a number of options that parents may choose to perform:  (A) Lighting seven candles (symbolizing the seven days of creation) and holding the baby towards them, (B)  Wrapping the baby in the four corners of a [[tallit]] (Jewish prayer shawl), or (C) Lifting the baby and touching her hands to a [[Torah]] scroll.
