The '''United States presidential election of 1876''' was the 23rd quadrennial [[United States presidential election|presidential election]], held on Tuesday, November 7, 1876. It was one of the most contentious and controversial [[United States presidential election|presidential elections]] in American history, and is known for being the catalyst for the end of [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]]. [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] faced [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Samuel Tilden]]. After a controversial post-election process, Hayes was declared the winner.

After President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] declined to seek a third term despite previously being expected to do so, Congressman [[James G. Blaine]] emerged as the front-runner for the Republican nomination. However, Blaine was unable to win a majority at the [[1876 Republican National Convention]], which settled on Governor Hayes of Ohio as a compromise candidate. The [[1876 Democratic National Convention]] nominated Governor Tilden of New York on the second ballot.

The results of the election remain among the most disputed ever, although it is not disputed that Tilden outpolled Hayes in the popular vote. After a first count of votes, Tilden won 184 [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]] to Hayes's 165, with 20 votes from four states unresolved. In the case of Florida, Louisiana, and South Carolina, each party reported its candidate had won the state, while in Oregon one elector was replaced after being declared illegal for being an "elected or appointed official". The question of who should have been awarded these electoral votes is the source of the continued controversy. An informal deal was struck to resolve the dispute: the [[Compromise of 1877]], which awarded all 20 electoral votes to Hayes. In return for the Democrats' acquiescence to Hayes's election, the Republicans agreed to withdraw federal troops from the South, ending Reconstruction. The Compromise effectively ceded power in the Southern states to the Democratic [[Redeemers]], who proceeded to [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchise black voters]] in subsequent years.

The 1876 election is one of five presidential elections in which the [[United States presidential elections in which the winner lost the popular vote|person who won the most popular votes did not win the election]], and the only such election in which the popular vote winner received a majority (rather than a plurality) of the popular vote. To date, it remains the election that recorded the smallest [[List of United States presidential elections by Electoral College margin#Table of election results|electoral vote victory]] (185&amp;ndash;184) and the election that yielded the highest [[voter turnout]] of the eligible [[voting age population]] in American history, at 81.8%.&lt;ref name="turnout" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Between 1932 and 2008: {{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/2012/tables/12s0397.pdf|title=Table 397.

[[Image:Hayes-Wheeler.jpg|thumb|Hayes/[[William A. Wheeler|Wheeler]] campaign poster]]
It was widely assumed during the year 1875 that incumbent President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] would run for a third term as president in spite of the poor economic conditions, the numerous political scandals that had developed since he assumed office in 1869, and a long-standing tradition set by the first president, [[George Washington]], not to stay in office longer than two terms. Grant's inner circle advised him to go for a third term and he almost did, but the House, by a sweeping 233 to 18 vote, passed a resolution declaring that the two-term tradition was to prevent a dictatorship. Late in the year, the president withdrew from the running for 1876.

When the Sixth Republican National Convention assembled on June 14, 1876, it appeared that [[James G. Blaine]] would be the nominee. On the first ballot, Blaine was just 100 votes short of a majority. His vote began to slide after the second ballot, however, as many Republicans feared that Blaine could not win the general election. Anti-Blaine delegates could not agree on a candidate until Blaine's total rose to 41% on the sixth ballot. Leaders of the reform Republicans met privately and considered alternatives. Their choice was Ohio's reform governor, Rutherford B. Hayes. On the seventh ballot, Hayes was nominated with 384 votes to 351 for Blaine and 21 for Benjamin Bristow. [[William A. Wheeler]] was nominated for vice-president by a much larger margin (366&amp;ndash;89) over his chief rival, [[Frederick Theodore Frelinghuysen]], who later served as a member of the electoral commission that awarded the election to Hayes.

The 12th Democratic National Convention assembled in [[St. Louis]], Missouri, in June 1876, the first political convention held by one of the major American parties west of the [[Mississippi River]]. Five thousand people jammed the auditorium in St. Louis with hopes for the first presidential victory for the Democratic Party in 20 years. The platform called for immediate and sweeping reforms in response to the scandals that had plagued the Grant administration. Tilden won more than 400 votes on the first ballot and the nomination by a landslide on the second.

Tilden defeated [[Thomas A. Hendricks]], [[Winfield Scott Hancock]], [[William Allen (governor)|William Allen]], [[Thomas F. Bayard]], and [[Joel Parker]] for the presidential nomination. Although Tilden was strongly opposed by [[John Kelly (New York politician)|"Honest John" Kelly]], the leader of New York's [[Tammany Hall]], he was still able to obtain the nomination. Thomas Hendricks was nominated for vice-president, since he was the only person put forward for the position.

The Democratic platform pledged to replace the corruption of the Grant administration with honest, efficient government and to end "the rapacity of carpetbag tyrannies" in the South. It also called for treaty protection for naturalized United States citizens visiting their homelands, restrictions on Asian immigration, tariff reform, and opposition to land grants for railroads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=William |last=DeGregorio |title=The Complete Book of U.S. Presidents |location=New York |publisher=Gramercy |year=1997 |isbn=0-517-18353-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been claimed that Tilden's nomination was received by the voting Democrats with more enthusiasm than any leader since [[Andrew Jackson]].&lt;ref&gt;[[They Also Ran]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Greenback Party]] had been organized by agricultural interests in [[Indianapolis]] in 1874 to urge the federal government to inflate the economy through the mass issuance of paper money called [[United States notes|greenbacks]]. Its first national nominating convention was held in Indianapolis in the spring of 1876. [[Peter Cooper]] was nominated for president with 352 votes to 119 for three other contenders. The convention nominated [[Anti-Monopoly Party|anti-monopolist]] Senator [[Newton Booth]] of California for vice-president; after Booth declined to run, the national committee chose [[Samuel Fenton Cary]] as his replacement on the ticket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Joseph Patterson|title=History of the Republican party in Ohio|date=1898|publisher=The Lewis Publishing Company|location=Chicago|volume=Volume I|page=352|url=https://archive.org/stream/HistoryOfTheRepublicanPartyInOhioV.1/HistoryRepublicanParty_Smith_v1_938pgs60749956#page/n375/mode/2up|accessdate=19 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prohibition Party nomination===
The [[Prohibition Party]], in its second national convention, nominated [[Green Clay Smith]] as its presidential candidate and [[Gideon T. Stewart]] as its vice-presidential candidate.

===American National Party nomination===
This small political party used several different names, often with different names in different states. It was a continuation of the Anti-Masonic Party that met in 1872 and nominated [[Charles Francis Adams, Sr.|Charles Francis Adams]] for president. When Adams declined to run, the party did not contest the 1872 election.

The convention was held from June 8 to 10, 1875, in Liberty Hall, Pittsburgh. B.T. Roberts of New York served as chairman, and [[Jonathan Blanchard (abolitionist)|Jonathan Blanchard]] was the keynote speaker.

The platform supported the Reconstruction Amendments to the Constitution, international arbitration, the reading of the scriptures in public schools, specie payments, justice for [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], abolition of the Electoral College, and prohibition of the sale of alcoholic beverages. It declared the first day of the week to be a day of rest for the United States. The platform opposed secret societies and monopolies.

The convention considered three potential presidential nominees: Charles F. Adams, Jonathan Blanchard, and James B. Walker. When Blanchard declined to run, Walker was unanimously nominated. The convention then nominated Donald Kirkpatrick of New York unanimously for vice-president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=291045 |title=US President - American National Convention Race - Jun 08, 1875 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date=2010-06-21 |accessdate=2014-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Campaign===

[[File:Tilden or blood.jpg|thumb|"A [[truce]] - not a compromise, but a chance for high-toned gentlemen to retire gracefully from their very civil declarations of war." By [[Thomas Nast]] in ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'', 1877 Feb 17, p. 132.]]

Tilden, who had prosecuted machine politicians in New York and sent legendary political boss [[William M. Tweed]] to jail, ran as a reform candidate against the background of the corruption of the [[Presidency of Ulysses S. Grant|Grant administration]]. Both parties backed civil service reform and an end to Reconstruction. Both sides mounted mud-slinging campaigns, with Democratic attacks on Republican corruption being countered by Republicans raising the Civil War issue, a tactic ridiculed by Democrats who called it "[[waving the bloody shirt]]". Republicans chanted, "Not every Democrat was a rebel, but every rebel was a Democrat."

Hayes was a virtual unknown outside his home state of Ohio, where he had served two terms as a Congressman and then two terms as governor. [[Henry Adams]] wrote "[Hayes] is a third-rate nonentity whose only recommendations are that he is obnoxious to no one." He had served in the Civil War with distinction as colonel of the 23rd Ohio Regiment and was wounded several times, which made him marketable to veterans. He had been brevetted as a Major General. Hayes's most important asset was the help he provided the Republican ticket in carrying the crucial swing state of Ohio.  On the other side, newspaper man [[John D. Defrees]] described Tilden as "a very nice, prim, little, withered-up, fidgety old bachelor, about one-hundred and twenty-pounds avoirdupois, who never had a genuine impulse for many nor any affection for woman."&lt;ref&gt;Holt, Michael F., ''By One Vote'', University Press of Kansas, 2008, pg. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

The Democratic strategy for victory in the South was highly reliant on paramilitary groups such as the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]] and the [[White League]]. Using the strategy of the [[Mississippi Plan]], these groups actively suppressed black and white Republican voter turnouts by disrupting meetings and rallies and even using violence and intimidation.&lt;ref&gt;The violent origin of the term [[Bulldozer#History of the word|bulldoze]] as a means of intimidation came from this election. A "bull-dose" was a bull sized whipping used to intimidate [[African Americans]] in the [[Southern United States]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kelly |first1=John |title=What in the Word?! The racist roots of ‘bulldozer’ |url=https://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2018/02/14/word-racist-roots-bulldozer/ |website=[[Oxford English Dictionary|Oxford Dictionaries]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |accessdate=21 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They saw themselves as the military wing of the Democratic Party.

Because it was considered improper for a candidate to pursue the presidency actively, neither Tilden nor Hayes actively stumped as part of the campaign, leaving that job to surrogates.

===Colorado===
[[Colorado]] was admitted to the Union as the 38th state on August 1, 1876. With insufficient time or money to organize a presidential election in the new state, Colorado's state legislature selected the state's electors. These electors in turn gave their three votes to Hayes and the Republican Party. This was the last election in which any state chose electors through its state legislature.

===Electoral disputes===
{{Further|Electoral Commission (United States)}}
In Florida (with 4 electoral votes), Louisiana (with 8), and South Carolina (with 7), reported returns favored Tilden, but election results in each state were marked by fraud and threats of violence against Republican voters. The most egregious case was in South Carolina, where an impossible 101 percent of all eligible voters in the state had their votes counted.&lt;ref&gt;Holt, Michael F, ''By One Vote'', University Press of Kansas, 2008, pg. 167, pg. 255&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the points of contention revolved around the design of ballots. At the time, parties would print ballots or "tickets" to enable voters to support them in the open ballots. To aid illiterate voters the parties would print symbols on the tickets. In this election, many Democratic ballots were printed with the Republican symbol, [[Abraham Lincoln]], on them.&lt;ref name="BALLOT"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1066014.stm |title=Flashback to 1876: History repeats itself |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=November 28, 2006 | date=December 12, 2000 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Republican-dominated state electoral commissions subsequently disallowed a sufficient number of Democratic votes to award their electoral votes to Hayes.

In two southern states, the governor recognized by the United States had signed the Republican certificates. The Democratic certificates from Florida were signed by the state attorney-general and the new Democratic governor. Those from Louisiana were signed by the Democratic gubernatorial candidate, and those from South Carolina by no state official. In the latter state, the Tilden electors simply claimed that they were chosen by the popular vote, and they were rejected by the state election board.&lt;ref name="Andrews"&gt;{{cite book
|last =Andrews|first =E. Benjamin|authorlink =Elisha Benjamin Andrews|title =History of the United States|publisher =Charles Scribner's Sons|year =1912}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, in Oregon, the vote of a single elector was disputed. The statewide result clearly favored Hayes, but the state's Democratic governor, [[La Fayette Grover]], claimed that one elector, former postmaster John Watts, was ineligible under Article II, Section 1, of the [[United States Constitution]], since he was a "person holding an office of trust or profit under the United States." Grover then substituted a Democratic elector in his place. The two Republican electors dismissed Grover's action and each reported three votes for Hayes, while the Democratic elector, C.A. Cronin, reported one vote for Tilden and two votes for Hayes. The two Republican electors presented a certificate signed by the secretary of state of Oregon. Cronin and the two electors he appointed (Cronin voted for Tilden while his associates voted for Hayes) used a certificate signed by the governor and attested by the secretary of state.&lt;ref name="Andrews" /&gt; Ultimately, all three of Oregon's votes were awarded to Hayes.

Hayes thus had a majority of one in the Electoral College. The Democrats cried fraud. Suppressed excitement pervaded the country. Threats were even muttered that Hayes would never be inaugurated. In [[Columbus, Ohio]], a shot was fired at Governor Hayes's residence as he sat down to dinner. Supporters marched to his home, calling for the "president". Hayes urged the crowd that, "it is impossible, at so early a time, to obtain the result."&lt;ref name="Morris"&gt;Morris, Roy, Jr. (2003). ''Fraud Of The Century: Rutherford B. Hayes, Samuel Tilden And The Stolen Election Of 1876''. New York: Simon and Schuster. pp. 168, 239. {{ISBN|978-0-7432-5552-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Grant quietly strengthened the military force in and around Washington.&lt;ref name="Andrews" /&gt;

The Constitution provides that "the President of the Senate shall, in presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the [electoral] certificates, and the votes shall then be counted." Certain Republicans held that the power to count the votes lay with the President of the Senate, the House and Senate being mere spectators. The Democrats objected to this construction, since Mr. Ferry, the Republican President of the Senate, could then count the votes of the disputed states for Hayes. The Democrats insisted that Congress should continue the practice followed since 1865, which was that no vote objected to should be counted except by the concurrence of both houses. The House had a solid Democratic majority; by throwing out the vote of one state, it could elect Tilden.&lt;ref name="Andrews" /&gt;

Facing an unprecedented [[constitutional crisis]], the [[Congress of the United States]] passed a law on January 29, 1877 that formed a 15-member [[Electoral Commission (US)|Electoral Commission]] to settle the result. Five members were selected from each house of Congress, and they were joined by five members of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. [[William M. Evarts]] served as counsel for the Republican Party. The [[Compromise of 1877]] might have helped the Democrats accept this electoral commission as well.

The majority party in each house named three members and the minority party two. As the Republicans controlled the Senate and the Democrats the House of Representatives, this yielded five Democratic and five Republican members of the Commission. Of the Supreme Court justices, two Republicans and two Democrats were chosen, with the fifth to be selected by these four.

The justices first selected a political independent, Justice [[David Davis (Supreme Court justice)|David Davis]]. According to one historian, "[n]o one, perhaps not even Davis himself, knew which presidential candidate he preferred."&lt;ref name="Morris" /&gt; Just as the Electoral Commission Bill was passing Congress, the legislature of Illinois elected Davis to the Senate. Democrats in the Illinois legislature believed that they had purchased Davis's support by voting for him. However, they had made a miscalculation; instead of staying on the Supreme Court so that he could serve on the Commission, he promptly resigned as a Justice in order to take his Senate seat.&lt;ref name="HarpWeek"&gt;[http://elections.harpweek.com/Controversy.htm "Hayes v. Tilden: The Electoral College Controversy of 1876&amp;ndash;1877."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060220200717/http://elections.harpweek.com/Controversy.htm |date=February 20, 2006 }} HarpWeek&lt;/ref&gt; All the remaining available justices were Republicans, so the four justices already selected chose Justice [[Joseph P. Bradley]], who was considered the most impartial remaining member of the court. This selection proved decisive.

[[File:PresidentialCounty1876.gif|thumb|Results by county explicitly indicating the percentage of the winning candidate in each county. Shades of blue are for Tilden (Democratic) and shades of red are for Hayes (Republican).]]
It was drawing perilously near to Inauguration Day. The commission met on the last day of January. The cases of Florida, Louisiana, Oregon, and South Carolina were in succession submitted to it by Congress. Eminent counsel appeared for each side. There were double sets of returns from every one of the states named.&lt;ref name="Andrews" /&gt;

The commission first decided not to question any returns that were ''[[prima facie]]'' lawful.&lt;ref name="Andrews" /&gt; Bradley joined the other seven Republican committee members in a series of 8–7 votes that gave all 20 disputed electoral votes to Hayes, giving Hayes a 185–184 electoral vote victory. The commission adjourned on March 2; two days later [[Inauguration of Rutherford B. Hayes|Hayes was inaugurated]] without disturbance.&lt;ref name="Andrews" /&gt;

During intense closed-door meetings, Democratic leaders agreed with reluctance to accept Hayes as president in return for the withdrawal of Federal troops from the last two still-occupied Southern states, South Carolina and Louisiana. Republican leaders in return agreed on a number of handouts and entitlements, including Federal subsidies for a transcontinental railroad line through the South. Although some of these promises were not kept, in particular the railroad proposal, it was enough for the time being to avert a dangerous standoff.

The returns accepted by the Commission put Hayes' margin of victory in South Carolina at 889 votes, the second-closest popular vote margin in a decisive state in U.S. history, after the [[United States presidential election, 2000|election of 2000]], which was decided by 537 votes in Florida (though in 2000, the declared margin of victory in the Electoral College for [[George W. Bush]] was five votes, as opposed to Hayes' one vote).

It is not possible to conclude definitively what the result would have been if a fair election had been held without the violence and intimidation throughout the South that disenfranchised many African Americans made eligible to vote under the 15th Amendment.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080223082500/http://www.cresswellslist.com/ballots2/1876_who.htm Who Won the 1876 Election?] Issue 9 of Buttons and Ballots, in Spring 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, in the likeliest fair scenario, Hayes would have won the election with 189 electoral votes to Tilden's 180 by winning all of the states that he did ultimately carry, plus Mississippi, but minus Florida.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; In a truly fair election, it seems probable that [[South Carolina]], [[Mississippi]], and [[Louisiana]], which all had majority black populations, would have gone Republican.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Regardless, Hayes would be the last Republican until [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in [[United States presidential election, 1956|1956]] to win the electoral votes of Louisiana and the last Republican until [[Barry M. Goldwater]] in [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964]] to carry South Carolina. Florida, with a majority white population, would have likely gone to Tilden in a fair election.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; It is therefore likely that Hayes would have won appreciably more of the popular vote in a fair election, perhaps even a plurality or majority.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Upon his defeat, Tilden said, "I can retire to public life with the consciousness that I shall receive from posterity the credit of having been elected to the highest position in the gift of the people, without any of the cares and responsibilities of the office." Hayes paid off those who helped him win the electoral college with government sinecures.

=== Results ===

According to the Commission's rulings, of the 2,249 counties and independent cities making returns, Tilden won in 1,301 (57.85%) while Hayes carried only 947 (42.11%). One county (0.04%) in [[Nevada]] split evenly between Tilden and Hayes.

While the Greenback ticket did not have a major impact on the election's outcome, attracting slightly under one percent of the popular vote, Cooper nonetheless had the strongest performance of any third-party presidential candidate since [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]] in [[United States presidential election, 1860|1860]]. The Greenbacks' best showings were in Kansas, where Cooper earned just over six percent of the vote, and Indiana, where he earned 17,207 votes, far exceeding Tilden's roughly 5,500 vote margin of victory over Hayes in that state.

The election of 1876 was the last one held before the end of the Reconstruction era, which sought to protect the rights of African Americans in the South who usually voted for Republican presidential candidates. No [[slave states and free states|antebellum slave state]] would be carried by a Republican again until the 1896 realignment, and it was not until the [[United States presidential election, 1920|election of 1920]] that one of the states of the Confederacy was ever again carried by a Republican presidential candidate. In that case, it was Tennessee, a state that never experienced a long period of occupation by Federal troops and was completely "reconstructed" well before the first presidential election of the Reconstruction period (1868). None of the Southern states that experienced long periods of occupation by Federal troops was carried by a Republican again until the [[United States presidential election, 1928|election of 1928]] (Texas, Florida, North Carolina, and Virginia). This proved the last election in which the Republicans won Louisiana until 1956 and the last in which the Republicans won South Carolina until 1964. The next time those two states voted against the Democrats was when they supported the Dixiecrats in 1948; Louisiana also voted against the Democrats in 1968 by voting for Wallace.

Although 1876 marked the last competitive two party election in the South before Democratic dominance of the South through 1948 and of the border states through 1896, it was also the last election (as of 2017) in which the Democrats won the pro-union counties of [[Mitchell County, North Carolina|Mitchell]] in North Carolina,&lt;ref&gt;The Political Graveyard; [http://politicalgraveyard.com/geo/NC/MI-votes.html Mitchell County, North Carolina]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wayne County, Tennessee|Wayne]] and [[Henderson County, Tennessee|Henderson]] in Tennessee, and [[Lewis County, Kentucky]].&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Robert David; [http://www.americamagazine.org/content/unconventional-wisdom/how-red-and-blue-map-evolved-over-past-century ‘How the Red and Blue Map Evolved Over the Past Century’]; ''America Magazine'' in ''The National Catholic Review''; June 29, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The election was also the last time a Republican won the presidency without carrying Indiana.

The '''Against Chess Olympiad''' ({{Lang-ar|الأولمبياد الضَاد الشطرنج}} ''al-Awlambayād aḍ-ḍādi ash-Shatranji''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.ie/search?q=%22against+chess+olympiad%22&amp;rlz=1C1CHFX_en-GBIE647IE647&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjGxYHn3aLUAhXEIMAKHYDXAVgQ_AUICigB&amp;biw=887&amp;bih=734#imgrc=aKO0FDZHNSfe1M:|title="against chess olympiad" - Google Search|website=www.google.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was arranged as an alternative to the official [[22nd Chess Olympiad|22nd]] [[Chess Olympiad]], held in [[Haifa]], [[Israel]], almost simultaneously. This unofficial Olympiad took place in [[Tripoli]], [[Libyan Arab Republic]] from October 24 to November 15, 1976.

==Background==

When [[FIDE]] decided to award the hosting of the 1976 Olympiad to Israel, it caused considerable controversy, as several countries, including the Soviet Union and all of the Arab nations, did not recognize the state of Israel. After FIDE refused to change the venue, the Soviet team boycotted the tournament in Haifa in protest, as did all the Soviet satellite states in the Eastern Bloc, and the Arab member nations of FIDE. 

The Arab nations held their own Olympiad in Tripoli at the same time as the official one. In the promotion material, this event was called the ''Against Israel Olympiad'', but it has later become known by the politically less volatile name ''Against Chess Olympiad''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allermann.blogspot.ie/2014/08/the-against-chess-olympiad.html|title=The Against Chess Olympiad|website=allermann.blogspot.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the unofficial Tripoli Olympiad was a highly charged political event, the actual chess played was on quite a different level. None of the major chess nations, Eastern or Western, came to Libya, meaning the field consisted of the Arab states, a number of minor chess nations, and some that were not members of FIDE at the time. No [[Grandmaster (chess)|Grandmasters]] were present, and very few [[International Master]]s attended. 

The Philippines, Italy, and Uruguay were the only nations to send teams to both Olympiads, and none of them were able to win any medals at either event.

==Results==

Thirty-four teams played a 13-round [[Swiss system tournament]]. In a somewhat surprising outcome, the completely unknown Salvadoran team, which included 17-year-old talent [[Boris Pineda]], took home the gold medals. Silver and bronze went to Tunisia and Pakistan, respectively.

''' Andrey Ivanovich Zhelyabov''' ({{lang-ru|Желябов, Андрей Иванович}}; {{OldStyleDate|29 August|1851|17 August}}  – {{OldStyleDate|15 April|1881|3 April}}) was a Russian [[revolutionary]] and member of the Executive Committee of [[Narodnaya Volya (organization)|Narodnaya Volya]].

After graduating from a [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in [[Kerch]] in 1869, Zhelyabov got into a [[Law School]] of the Novorossiysky University in [[Odessa]]. He was expelled from the university for his participation in student unrests in October 1871 and sent away from Odessa. In 1873, Zhelyabov lived in a town of [[Gorodische]] (now [[Cherkas'ka oblast']] of [[Ukraine]]) and maintained close ties with revolutionaries from [[Kiev]] and activists of the [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] "[[Gromada]]". After his return to Odessa, Zhelyabov became a member of the revolutionary [[Felix Volkhovsky]] group (the Odessa affiliate of “[[Chaikovtsi]]”) and conducted [[propaganda]] among workers and [[intelligentsia]]. He was arrested in late 1874 and then released on [[bail]]. Nevertheless, he continued his illegal activities. Zhelyabov was one of the suspects in the "[[Trial of the 193]]". After his [[acquittal]] in 1878, he moved to [[Podolsk]] province for the purpose of spreading revolutionary propaganda among the [[peasantry]].

Zhelyabov gradually came to believe in the necessity of violent political struggle and [[terrorism|terror]]. He participated in the [[Lipetsk]] [[Congress]] of political terrorists in June 1879. Zhelyabov was accepted in “[[Zemlya i volya]]” at the [[Voronezh]] Congress of its members and came forward as one of the chief defenders of terrorism. After the split of "Zemlya i volya", he was one of the main organizers of "Narodnaya volya" and its newspaper "Worker’s Gazette" (fall of 1880). Zhelyabov took active part in devising a few of the most important documents of the party's Program. Also, he was one of the chief organizers of the [[assassination]] of [[Alexander II of Russia]] on March 1, 1881. However, he had been arrested a few days before it actually happened. Zhelyabov demanded that his case be considered together with the case of the [[Pervomartovtsi]]. He was executed by hanging on April 3, 1881 with the rest of the terrorists, including his wife [[Sophia Perovskaya]].

In admiration of Zhelyabov’s dedication to his revolutionary cause, [[Vladimir Lenin]] went as far as to compare him with other great revolutionaries, such as [[Maximilien Robespierre]] and [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]].

The '''Australian Labor Party (Anti-Communist)''' (ALP-AC) was the name initially used by the right-wing group which arose from the [[Australian Labor Party split of 1955|1955 Labor split]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Murray (1970), ''The Split. Australian Labor in the Fifties'', F. W. Cheshire, Melbourne, Victoria.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957 it changed its name to the [[Democratic Labor Party (historical)|Democratic Labor Party]], and was dissolved in 1978.

==History==
As part of the ALP split of 1955, in April 1955, 7 Victorian federal MPs and 18 state MPs were expelled from the ALP. The federal MPs were: [[Tom Andrews (Australian politician)|Tom Andrews]], [[Bill Bourke]], [[Bill Bryson (Australian politician)|Bill Bryson]], [[Jack Cremean]], [[Bob Joshua]], [[Stan Keon]] and [[Jack Mullens]].

On the night of 19 April 1955, [[Henry Bolte]] raised a [[motion of no-confidence]] against Cain's government in the Legislative Assembly. After twelve hours of debate on the motion, in the early hours of 20 April, 11 of the expelled Labor members [[Crossing the floor|crossed the floor]] to support Bolte's motion. With his government defeated, Cain sought and received a dissolution of parliament later that day, with the election set down for 28 May..&lt;ref name=noconf&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article75437726 |title=Victorian Govt. Defeated; Election On May 28. |newspaper=[[The Central Queensland Herald]] |location=Rockhampton, Qld. |date=21 April 1955 |accessdate=10 April 2012 |page=6 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ainsley Symons (2012), 'Democratic Labor Party members in the Victorian Parliament of 1955-1958,' in ''Recorder'' (Australian Society for the Study of Labour History, Melbourne Branch) No. 275, November, Pages 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The expelled ALP members formed the Australian Labor Party (Anti-Communist) under the influence of [[B. A. Santamaria]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Strangio and Brian Costar (2005), "B. A. Santamaria: Religion as Politics", in Brian Costar, Peter Love and Paul Strangio (eds.), ''The Great Labor Schism. A Retrospective'', Scribe Publications, Melbourne.&lt;/ref&gt; 

At the [[Victorian state election, 1955|1955 Victorian election]] held in May, 11 of the 12 expelled MPs in the Victorian Legislative Assembly, as well as other candidates, and the one MP facing re-election in the Victorian Legislative Council lost their seats. The party drew 12.6% of the vote, mainly from the ALP, but because its vote was widely spread only one of its candidates, the expelled Labor member Frank Scully, was re-elected. The party directed its 12.6% vote to the Coalition, and most of its supporters followed the party's preferences. Labor won 37.6% of the vote and 20 seats to the Liberals' 34 and the Country Party's ten. In any event, the Cain Labor Government lost government at the 1955 election. Five MPs whose terms had not expired remained in the Legislative Council until the expiry of their terms at the [[Victorian state election, 1958|1958 Victorian election]], and all who recontested their seats were defeated.

[[Frank Scully (politician)|Frank Scully]] was the only expelled MP returned. He had been a Minister in the Cain Government and a member of the Catholic Social Studies Movement ("The Movement") in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], and was expelled from the ministry and the ALP as part of the 1955 split.&lt;ref name="DLP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dlp.org.au/blog/frank-scully-passes-away-aged-95-years/|title=Frank Scully passes away, aged 95 years|date=August 14, 2015|publisher=[[Democratic Labour Party (Australia)]]|accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won the [[Electoral district of Richmond (Victoria)|seat of Richmond]] in the Victorian Legislative Assembly in May 1955 and was the only member of the DLP in the Assembly until 1958.&lt;ref&gt;Ainsley Symons (2012), 'Democratic Labor Party members in the Victorian Parliament of 1955–1958,' in ''Recorder'' (Australian Society for the Study of Labour History, Melbourne Branch) No. 275, November, Pages 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;  

All the 7 expelled federal MPs were defeated at the [[Australian federal election, 1955|1955 federal election]] held in December. However, [[Frank McManus (Australian politician)|Frank McManus]] was elected as a senator for [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] at the 1955 election, and successful ALP candidate [[George Cole (Australian politician)|George Cole]] had chosen before the election to become part of this party. 

The parliamentary membership of the ALP (Anti-Communist) was almost entirely [[Roman Catholic]]. The only two non-Catholics were its federal leader, [[Bob Joshua]], who represented [[Ballarat]] in the [[Australian House of Representatives]], and [[Jack Little (Australian politician)|Jack Little]], who led the party in the [[Victoria Legislative Council]] between 1955 and 1958. It has been suggested that the party was substantially a party of Irish-ethnics,&lt;ref&gt;Lyle Allan (1988), "Irish Ethnicity and the Democratic Labor Party", ''Politics'', Vol. 23 No. 2, Pages 28-34.&lt;/ref&gt; a result of the ALP split of 1955 being a 'de-ethnicisation', a forcible removal of the Irish-Catholic element within the ALP.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Healy (1993), 'Ethnic ALP Branches - The Balkanisation of Labor,' in ''People and Place'' Vol.1, No.4, Page 38.&lt;/ref&gt; However, many ALP (Anti-Communist) members were not of Irish descent. The party attracted many voters among migrants from Catholic countries in southern Europe, and among anti-Communist Eastern European refugees. 

In 1957, the party changed its name to the [[Democratic Labor Party (historical)|Democratic Labor Party]], which formally dissolved in 1978. Those party members who refused to accept the party's dissolution, formed a successor party, the [[Democratic Labour Party (Australia)|Democratic Labour Party]].

The '''black armband protest''' was made by [[Zimbabwe]]an cricketers [[Andy Flower]] and [[Henry Olonga]] during the [[2003 Cricket World Cup]]. The pair decided to wear [[black armband]]s to "mourn the death of democracy in Zimbabwe". The protest received condemnation from senior Zimbabwean political figures, and also some senior Zimbabwean cricket figures, but was praised by the international media. The [[International Cricket Council]] deemed that Flower and Olonga had taken a political action, but refused to charge the pair with an offence. Their initial protest was during Zimbabwe's first match of the tournament in [[Harare]], and the pair wore armbands to protest at all of the matches. As a result of the protest, Flower and Olonga were forced to leave Zimbabwe, and both men later settled in the United Kingdom.

== The protest ==

=== Planning ===

After Flower had decided to protest, he decided that he wanted Olonga to partner him in the protest, as "one white Zimbabwean and one black one operating together gave the message the most eloquent balance."&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; Olonga was the first black, and the youngest ever, cricketer to play for Zimbabwe.&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/africa/08/31/henry.olonga.zimbabwe/| title= Henry Olonga, Zimbabwe's cricketing rebel |publisher=CNN|date= 7 September 2010|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/henry-olonga-he-has-a-love-for-zimbabwe-even-now-but-while-mugabe-is-alive-he-knows-he-cant-return-2034849.html|title= Henry Olonga: He has a love for Zimbabwe even now. But while Mugabe is alive, he knows he can't return|publisher= The Independent| date=25 July 2010|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They met up in a news café in [[Harare]] to plan the protest, originally considering withdrawing from the [[2003 Cricket World Cup|World Cup]], but later deciding to protest instead.&lt;ref name="Cricket County" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Principles"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/292618.html| title= Standing up for their principles| publisher= ESPN Cricinfo|date=27 April 2007|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair spoke with lawyer [[David Coltart]], a founding member of the [[Movement for Democratic Change – Tsvangirai|Movement for Democratic Change]]. Coltart suggested wearing black armbands, and helped word the statement in a non-incriminating way.&lt;ref name="Cricinfo World Cup No. 8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian Olonga"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/dec/16/cricket1| title= How I risked it all with a black armband|publisher=The Guardian|date= 16 December 2003| accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Standard"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/olonga-a-hero-in-exile-7241014.html| title= Olonga: A hero in exile| publisher=London Evening Standard| date=28 February 2007|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the match, Zimbabwe batted first, and the public at the ground were not aware of the protest until the 22nd over, when Flower came out to bat wearing a black armband.&lt;ref name="Cricinfo Great Moments" /&gt; Olonga was also seen wearing a black armband on the Zimbabwe team balcony.&lt;ref name="Cricket County" /&gt; The crowd of 4,000 at the ground were supportive of the protest, and a number of them made their own black armbands during the match.&lt;ref name="Social 2003 WC"/&gt; In the match itself, Flower scored 39, as Zimbabwe reached 340/2, and Olonga took 0/8 in 3 overs, as Zimbabwe won a rain-affected match by 86 runs ([[Duckworth-Lewis method|D/L method]]).&lt;ref name="Wisden" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/current/match/65236.html|title=ICC World Cup, 2nd Match: Zimbabwe v Namibia at Harare, Feb 10, 2003|publisher=ESPN Cricinfo|accessdate=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions ==
[[File:Nasser Hussain.JPG|thumb|right|Former England captain [[Nasser Hussain]], who said Flower and Olonga "have proved to be great men by what they have done."]]

After the match, one man was arrested for wearing a black armband.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/feb/11/cricketworldcup2003.cricketworldcup3|title= Olonga risks his career with political protest| publisher=The Guardian|date=11 February 2015|accessdate=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Zimbabwe's next{{efn|name=Ex|Excluding the walkover against England}} group stage match against India, nearly 200 spectators wore black armbands, to support the protest.&lt;ref name="Social 2003 WC" /&gt;

Inside Zimbabwe, the reaction was hostile to the players. Zimbabwe's [[Minister of Information]], [[Jonathan Moyo]], called Olonga an "Uncle Tom" who had "a black skin and a white mask".&lt;ref name="Cricinfo Great Moments" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cricinfo World Cup No. 8"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wctimeline/content/current/story/825253.html | title=Olonga and Flower make a stand | work=Cricinfo | date=2 February 2015 | accessdate=28 February 2016 | author=Brickhill, Liam}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zanu PF]] information secretary [[Nathan Shamuyarira]] claimed they were forced into it by the British media, and "No true Zimbabwean would have joined in," but "Olonga is not a Zimbabwean, he is a Zambian".&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian events" /&gt; Olonga was charged with treason, an offence punishable by death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.iol.co.za/sport/cricket/olonga-sought-for-treason-1.103157#.VY6CM_lViko| title= Olonga 'sought for treason'| publisher=IOL Sport|date=17 March 2003|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; MDC leader [[Morgan Tsvangirai]] released a statement in support of the protest. He was charged with treason, although the charge was later dropped.&lt;ref name=BBC2003/&gt; Givemore Makoni, the President of [[Takashinga Cricket Club]] where Olonga played said "It is disgraceful what Henry Olonga and Andy Flower have done. Taking politics on to the playing field is a thing the International Cricket Council and all sports organisations have been trying to avoid," and that "by taking politics on to the field and bringing the game into disrepute Henry appears to have breached Takashinga's code of conduct".&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; Olonga was immediately suspended and later sacked by Takashinga Cricket Club.&lt;ref name=BBC2003&gt;{{cite news| url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/2748899.stm| title= Brave cricketers risk Mugabe's wrath| last=Winter| first=Joseph| work=[[BBC News]]| date=11 March 2003| accessdate=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian events"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/mar/17/cricketworldcup2003.cricketworldcup|title= 'I was a cricketer.

They have jeopardised our reputation when given this once in a lifetime chance to host the World Cup ... It would be wrong if they wore black armbands again."&lt;ref name="Social 2003 WC" /&gt; They referred the matter to the [[International Cricket Council]], who deemed that they had taken a political action, but refused to charge them with a formal offence. Instead, they released a statement reiterating the apolitical nature of the organisation, and asked the players not to wear black armbands for the rest of the tournament, with the threat of more serious punishment if they continued to wear them.&lt;ref name="Social 2003 WC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian events" /&gt;

The international reaction to the protest was favourable. [[The Times]] sports correspondent called it a "powerful blow for sanity, decency and democracy", whilst [[The Daily Telegraph]]'s [[Donald Trelford]] praised the players and criticised the [[International Cricket Council|ICC]] and [[England and Wales Cricket Board|ECB]], saying the players "shine out like diamonds in a pile of mud".&lt;ref name="Cricinfo Great Moments" /&gt; Cricket writer [[Tim de Lisle]] praised the pair, saying that "Together they were responsible for a shining moment in the game's history ... Two strips of black tape, more potent than any logo, breathed life back into the game's battered spirit."&lt;ref name="Social 2003 WC" /&gt; [[England national cricket team|England]] captain [[Nasser Hussain]] said that Flower and Olonga "have proved to be great men by what they have done."&lt;ref name="Guardian events" /&gt; As a result of the protest, Olonga's girlfriend broke up with him, and he received numerous threatening emails and death threats.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Principles" /&gt;

== Aftermath ==
[[File:Electrical-tape black.jpg|thumb|200px|Insulating tape was used instead of black armbands in the protest.]]

Zimbabwe won their next match against [[England national cricket team|England]] on a walkover, and also beat the [[Netherlands cricket team|Netherlands]], and had a no-result in their final group match against [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]], which allowed them to qualify for the Super 6 stage of the competition.&lt;ref name="Wisden" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WC 2003 Results"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/series/61124.html?template=fixtures| title= Fixtures: Zimbabwe| publisher=ESPN Cricinfo|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were eliminated in this stage,&lt;ref name="Wisden" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WC 2003 Results" /&gt; however this allowed both players to leave Zimbabwe for South Africa.&lt;ref name="Guardian Olonga" /&gt;

Olonga was dropped for 6 matches,{{efn|Including the walkover against England}} with no reason given – some have speculated that he was dropped as a result of the protest, whilst other suggest it was due to poor form.&lt;ref name="Cricket County" /&gt; Flower on the other hand was considered "undroppable".&lt;ref name="Cricket County" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Principles" /&gt; To comply with the ICC warning not to wear black armbands, during their next{{efn|name=Ex|Excluding the walkover against England}} group match, Flower and [[Glossary of cricket terms#T|twelfth-man]] Olonga both wore black wristbands, and in subsequent matches, Flower wore white armbands.&lt;ref name="Cricket County" /&gt; Olonga's only subsequent appearance for Zimbabwe was in their match against Kenya.&lt;ref name="WC 2003 Results" /&gt;

After their final Super Six match, Olonga immediately announced his retirement from international cricket, after 30 Test matches and 50 ODIs.&lt;ref name="Principles" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Standard" /&gt; Flower had already previously announced his retirement from international cricket, and had signed for [[Essex County Cricket Club|Essex]], and [[South Australia cricket team|South Australia]].&lt;ref name="Social 2003 WC" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/cwc2003/low/newsid_2860000/newsid_2863100/2863151.stm| title= Flower to play in Australia|publisher=BBC Sport|date= 19 March 2003|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Olonga, had not planned what to do after the protest, as he "had in my own naivety thought that I could carry on in Zimbabwe – maybe my career would come to an end but I could still live there."&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; In the end, he was kicked off the team bus,&lt;ref name="Cricket County" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cricinfo Great Moments" /&gt; and travelled to [[Johannesburg]], where he stayed for a month, before being granted a work permit to play for Lashings Cricket Club in England.&lt;ref name="Independent" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Independent2004/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian Olonga" /&gt; He was subsequently granted asylum in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.abc.net.au/news/2003-10-09/olonga-granted-extended-refuge-in-britain/1490854| title= Olonga granted extended refuge in Britain|publisher=ABC|date=9 October 2003|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither player has since returned to Zimbabwe.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian Olonga" /&gt;

== Legacy ==

Both players were awarded an Honorary Life Membership of the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]], an honour usually only given to players who have retired from [[first-class cricket]].&lt;ref name="Cricket County" /&gt; In 2013, the [[BBC]] recorded a special radio programme commemorating 10 years of the protest.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5802">'''Bridge therapy''' is [[therapy]] intended, in transportation [[metaphor]], to serve as a [[figurative analogy|figurative]] bridge to another stage of therapy or health, carrying a [[patient]] past a challenging period of some kind. There are various types of bridge therapy, such as bridge to transplant, bridge to candidacy, bridge to decision, bridge to recovery, and anticoagulation bridge (such as heparin bridge). Bridge therapy exists in contrast to [[destination therapy]], which is the figurative destination rather than a bridge to something else. 
* '''Bridge to transplant''': Such therapy preserves someone's health well enough and long enough that they can make it to [[organ transplantation|organ transplant]], still being [[organ transplantation#Allocation of organs|eligible for transplant]] after spending time waiting for an organ to become available. For example, [[left ventricular assist device|LVAD]] often serves as a bridge to [[heart transplantation|heart transplant]],&lt;ref name="pmid_28504892"&gt;{{Citation |last=Nakagawa |first=S |display-authors=etal |year=2017 |title=Palliative care interventions before left ventricular assist device implantation in both bridge to transplant and destination therapy |journal=J Palliat Med |volume= |issue= |pmid=28504892 |pmc=4125758 |doi=10.1089/jpm.2016.0568 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; locoregional therapy (such as [[radiofrequency ablation]]) for [[hepatocellular carcinoma]] can serve as a bridge to [[liver transplantation|liver transplant]],&lt;ref name="pmid_25099448"&gt;{{Citation |last=Prasad |first=MA |last2=Kulik |first2=LM |year=2014 |title=The role of bridge therapy prior to orthotopic liver transplantation |journal=J Natl Compr Canc Netw |volume=12 |issue=8 |pages=1183–1190; quiz 1191 |url=http://www.jnccn.org/content/12/8/1183.long |pmid=25099448 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[lung volume reduction surgery|LVRS]] can serve as a bridge to [[lung transplantation|lung transplant]].&lt;ref name="pmid_14720034"&gt;{{Citation |last=Cordova |first=FC |last2=Criner |first2=GJ |year=2002 |title=Lung volume reduction surgery as a bridge to lung transplantation |journal=Am J Respir Med |volume=1 |issue=5 |pages=313–324 |url= |pmid=14720034 |pmc= |doi= |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid_23736352"&gt;{{Citation |last=Shigemura |first=N |display-authors=etal |year=2013 |title=Lung transplantation after lung volume reduction surgery |journal=Transplantation |volume=96 |issue=4 |pages=421–425 |url= |pmid=23736352 |doi=10.1097/TP.0b013e31829853ac |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''Bridge to candidacy''': A patient was too sick to be a candidate for a certain therapy, but the bridge carries them to a state of being eligible; for example, [[extracorporeal membrane oxygenation|ECMO]] as a bridge to nontransplant [[cardiac surgery]].&lt;ref name="pmid_28672423"&gt;{{Citation |last=Wallinder |first=A |last2=Pellegrino |first2=V  |last3=Fraser |first3=JF  |last4=McGiffin |first4=DC |year=2017 |title=ECMO as a bridge to non-transplant cardiac surgery |journal=J Card Surg |volume= |issue= |pmid=28672423 |doi=10.1111/jocs.13172 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''Bridge to decision''': A decision will soon be made about what to do next (that is, which [[definitive therapy]] will come soon), but first the patient needs a bridge to support them until that decision; for example, short-term mechanical circulatory support as a bridge to durable [[ventricular assist device|left ventricular assist device]] implant in refractory [[cardiogenic shock]].&lt;ref name="pmid_28472406"&gt;{{Citation |last=den Uil |first=CA |display-authors=etal |year=2017 |title=Short-term mechanical circulatory support as a bridge to durable left ventricular assist device implantation in refractory cardiogenic shock: a systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=Eur J Cardiothorac Surg |volume= |issue= |pmid=28472406 |doi=10.1093/ejcts/ezx088 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''Bridge to recovery''': A recovery is likely, but first support is needed to carry someone through a tough time; for example, [[extracorporeal membrane oxygenation|ECMO]] in [[methamphetamine]] toxicity, which can be viewed as both [[salvage therapy|rescue therapy]] and bridge to recovery.&lt;ref name="pmid_28758605"&gt;{{Citation |last=Morrison |first=LK |display-authors=etal |year=2017 |title=Rescue extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy in methamphetamine toxicity |journal=CJEM |volume= |issue= |pmid=28758605 |doi=10.1017/cem.2017.356 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''Anticoagulation bridge''': Temporary [[anticoagulation]], such as with [[heparin]], is used during a [[perioperative]] period when a patient's regular anticoagulant therapy, such as with [[warfarin]], is suspended;&lt;ref name="Medscape_Periop_anticoag"&gt;{{Citation |last=Daley |first=Brian J. |last2=Taylor |first2=Dana |last3=Aycinena Goicolea |first3=Jose Fernando |editor-last=Schwer |editor-first=William A. |date=2016-03-28 |title=Perioperative anticoagulation management |work=Medscape |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/285265-overview |access-date=2017-08-11 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid_25126354"&gt;{{Citation |last=Baser |first=Onur |last2=Supina |first2=Dylan |last3=Sengupta |first3=Nishan |last4=Wang |first4=Li |year=2011 |title=Anticoagulation bridging therapy patterns in patients undergoing total hip or total knee replacement in a US health plan: real-world observations and implications |journal=Am Health Drug Benefits |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=240–248 |pmid=25126354 |pmc=4125758 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the goal is to prevent excess risk of severe [[bleeding]] during or after surgery. The heparin bridge provides some anticoagulant effect (to prevent [[thrombosis]] from warfarin withdrawal) but not as much as would make severe bleeding likely.

'''Bright Futures''' is the name of a [[scholarship]] program in the state of [[Florida]]. It is funded by the [[Florida Lottery]] and was first started in 1997.

== Scholarships ==
The program funds three scholarships, available to Florida residents who attend a Florida high school and an eligible Florida post-secondary institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.floridastudentfinancialaid.org/ssfad/PDF/BFHandbookChapter1.pdf|title=Bright Futures Student Handbook - Chapter 1: Initial Eligibility Requirements|last=|first=|date=October 24, 2016|website=|publisher=Office of Student Financial Assistance, Florida Department of Education|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Bright Futures Scholarship was meant to emulate neighboring state Georgia's [[HOPE Scholarship]].{{Fact|date=January 2017}} Originally the Program disbursed just above 42,000 scholarships for about $70 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.floridastudentfinancialaid.org/ssfad/PDF/BFstats/BFReportsD.pdf|title=Florida Bright Futures Scholarship Disbursement History|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Florida Bright Futures Scholarship Program|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the program's peak in 2008, it provided scholarships to 39% of Florida high school graduates,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; including 94 percent of incoming freshmen and 70 percent of all undergraduates at the [[University of Florida]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.alligator.org/news/uf_administration/article_3dbff071-13b6-5c5b-9e74-dc280d0d2c62.html|title=UF official says Bright Futures may be adding to budget woes|last=Stewart|first=Thomas|date=|work=|newspaper=The Independent Florida Alligator|access-date=2017-01-04|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The program was solely based on academic merit and not on financial need. At its height in 2008, the program was criticized for subsidizing the education of students from wealthy families using lottery proceeds collected largely from lower-income individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ccweek.com/article-583-popular-bright-futures-penalizes-needy-florida-students,-critics-say.html|title=Popular Bright Futures Penalizes Needy Florida Students, Critics Say|last=|first=|date=September 21, 2008|work=Associated Press|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-04|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; UF Chief Financial Officer Matt Fajack criticized the program for keeping state university tuition artificially low, since any tuition raise would mean that the state would have to spend more money to cover scholarships under the program.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The [[Florida Legislature]] enacted cuts to Bright Futures funding in 2011 by increasing the minimum SAT score required to qualify for the program. The changes took full effect for the graduating class of 2014, increasing the minimum score for A students from 1280 to 1290, and increasing the minimum score for B students from 980 to 1170. The cuts disproportionately impacted black and Latino students as well as students from predominantly poor schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/education/sfl-minorities-poor-hit-hardest-by-bright-futures-changes-20161021-htmlstory.html|title=Minorities, poor hit hardest by stricter Bright Futures requirements|last=McGlade|first=Caitlin|date=|work=|last2=Travis|first2=Scott|newspaper=Sun-Sentinel|access-date=2017-01-04|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 2015-16 school year, the program covered only 20% of Florida high school graduates and paid an average of $2,000 per year.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://wlrn.org/post/negron-eyes-bright-futures-key-senates-ed-plan|title=Negron Eyes Bright Futures As Key To Senate's Ed Plan|last=Carter|first=Cathy|date=|work=WLRN|access-date=2017-01-04|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the [[United States Department of Education]] launched an investigation of the Bright Futures program due to allegations of racial bias against black and Latino students, focusing particularly on its effects on students from [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade County]] and at [[Florida International University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/education/article1961828.html|title=Feds investigate Florida’s Bright Futures scholarships|last=Smiley|first=David|date=March 22, 2014|work=|newspaper=The Miami Herald|access-date=2017-01-04|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The department ultimately found evidence of disparate impacts on minorities but no evidence of discriminatory intent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/stateroundup/gov-rick-scott-wont-address-disparities-in-bright-futures-program/2214804|title=Gov.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5919">The '''Bund Deutscher Jugend''' (BDJ, {{lang-en|League of German Youth}}) was a politically active German association with right-wing and anti-communist leanings founded in 1950. In the beginning of 1953 the BDJ and its paramilitary arm, the Technischer Dienst, were forbidden as extreme right-wing organisations because of "involvement in a secret organisation" ([[guerrilla]] training).&lt;ref name="Cryptonyms"&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/iwg/declassified-records/rg-263-cia-records/second-release-lexicon.pdf Research Aid:  Cryptonyms and Terms in Declassified CIA Files - Nazi War Crimes and Japanese Imperial Government Records Disclosure Acts]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History==

The BDJ was founded on 23 June 1950 in Frankfurt/Main. The founder and main theorist and later chairman of the BDJ was [[Paul Lüth]].&lt;ref name="Bund Deutscher Jugend"&gt;[http://www.foia.cia.gov/sites/default/files/document_conversions/1705143/LCPROWL%20%20%20%20VOL.%204_0001.pdf Declassified CIA File: "Bund Deutscher Jugend" (League of German Youth])&lt;/ref&gt; The CIA-cryptonym for the BDJ was KMPRUDE&lt;ref name="Cryptonyms" /&gt; and for the Technischer Dienst LCPROWL.&lt;ref name="Amendment No. 2"&gt;[http://www.foia.cia.gov/sites/default/files/document_conversions/1705143/LCPROWL%20%20%20%20VOL.%201_0036.pdf Declassified CIA file: Project LCPROWL - Amendment No. 2]&lt;/ref&gt; The project outline in a declassified CIA file states the following objectives:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foia.cia.gov/sites/default/files/document_conversions/1705143/LCPROWL%20%20%20%20VOL.%204_0013.pdf Declassified CIA file: Project Outline: LCPROWL (Januar 24 1951)]&lt;/ref&gt;

# Consolidating the League as a permanent nationwide organization 
# Employing the League in political warfare operations 
# Guerrilla warfare and sabotage training of selected segments of the Leagues membership.

In April 1951 the ''Technischer Dienst'' (technical service), a secret subsection of the BDJ, was founded on the programmatic basis of the partisan writings by Paul Lüth with the aim in mind, to form an armed resistance movement against "Bolshevism".&lt;ref name="Bund Deutscher Jugend" /&gt; The operation ran under the name LCPROWL BDJ Apparat.&lt;ref name="Cryptonyms" /&gt; As of 1951 the budget for one year was $125.000.&lt;ref name="Amendment No. 2" /&gt;

The group was allegedly founded as part of the CIAs program of creating guerrilla and [[stay-behind]] groups in Germany and Western Europe that would fight the Soviets should they occupy Western Europe during a future confrontation. The CIA was training them in covert guerrilla warfare to be part of this future resistance movement. Many members of the BDJ were veterans of the [[Wehrmacht]] and [[Waffen-SS]].&lt;ref name="FAZ-1952-10-9"&gt;{{citation/core|Periodical=''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]''|PublicationPlace=Frankfurt|language=German|Comment=nicht eingesehen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FR-1952-10-14"&gt;{{citation/core|Periodical=Frankfurter Rundschau|Title=Oberbundesanwalt fordert BDJ-Akten |PublicationPlace=Frankfurt|language=German|Comment=nicht eingesehen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TOL-1952-10-9"&gt;{{citation/core|Periodical=''[[The Times (London)|The Times]]''|Title=Alleged Secret Organization: Guerilla Training in Germany |PublicationPlace=London|language=German|Comment=nicht eingesehen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prohibition Proceedings ==

A raid of local police units in the premises of the BDJ in 1952 revealed that the U.S. funded the organization with a monthly sum of $50,000 and supplied it with arms, ammunition and explosives. A weapons cache with machine guns, grenades, light artillery guns and explosives were found in the Odenwald near Frankfurt am Main.&lt;ref&gt;Partisans in Germany: An Arms Dump in the Odenwald. In: The Times. London, October 11, 1952&lt;/ref&gt; Seized documents also contained an assassination list naming 40 German political leaders - mainly politicians of the German socialist party, SPD. Among them were Herbert Wehner, the former head of the SPD party, Erich Ollenhauer, the Hessian Minister of the Interior, Heinrich Zinnkann and the Mayor of Hamburg and Bremen. For a case of "emergency" scenario, the BDJ had already funneled members in the SPD.
The United States [[Counter Intelligence Corps]] (CIC) took over the custody of the German BDJ members and refused in the following access by German authorities who intended to raise an indictment due to unlawful possession of weapons and planned murder. CIC agents continued to seize all documents still available and refused to surrender them to the German authorities. As a result of the ongoing investigation U.S. authorities admitted to having financed the BDJ for the training of guerrillas in case of war with the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;German Saboteurs Betray U.S. Trust. In: New York Times. New York October 10, 1952&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ideology ==
The charter and the official program of the BDJ reveal few details about the actual political motivations of the group. Deliberately any extreme right-wing ideology was kept out. The political guidelines of day-to-day politics were collected in the confidential, 78 pages long, memorandum "Bürger und Partisan" (Citizen and Partisan) by [[Paul Luth|Paul Lüth]]. According to Lüth the world was in a "defense war against [[totalitarianism]]".{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

'''Campus Conservation Nationals''' ('''CCN''') is a national competition in which colleges and universities in North America compete to reduce energy and water consumption over the course of a month. Participating schools aim to educate students and faculty about [[resource consumption]] and its effects on the environment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.competetoreduce.org/|title = Campus Conservation Nationals|date = 2014|accessdate = 10 February 2015|website = |publisher = Lucid|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The program is run by the [[U.S. Green Building Council]] (USGBC), [[Lucid Design Group]], the [[National Wildlife Federation]], and the [[Alliance to Save Energy]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/1896387|title = College Students Save 2.2 Million Kilowatt-hours, 476,000 Gallons of Water, and $196,000 during Electricity and Water Reduction Competitions|date = 5 May 2014|accessdate = 11 February 2015|website = Digital Journal|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The competition lasts for three weeks, and each individual school may choose when to hold their competition during CCN's three-month competition season each spring. Campuses can hold individual competitions, which involves campus buildings competing to have the highest reduction (by percent) of electricity and/or water compared to a previously-set baseline.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many campuses also participate in a group competition, competing against other schools in their region. Campus Conservation Nationals 2015 marks the fifth year of the competition. Recent years'{{when|date=February 2015}} competitions resulted in an overall energy savings of over 2 million [[kWh]] each year.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.ase.org/resources/campus-conservation-nationals-2013-powersave-campus-awards-california-champions|title = Campus Conservation Nationals 2013: PowerSave Campus Awards California Champions|date = 19 March 2013|accessdate = 12 February 2015|website = Alliance to Save Energy|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first  pilot competition was held in 2010, with the program resulting in 500,000 kWh of energy saved. [[DePauw University]] was the winner of the 2010 competition&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.ase.org/resources/college-students-save-500000-kilowatt-hours-electricity-nationwide-campus-conservation|title = College Students Save 500,000 Kilowatt-Hours Of Electricity In Nationwide Campus Conservation Contest|date = 29 November 2010|accessdate = 26 February 2015|website = |publisher = Alliance to Save Energy|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Procedures and methods ==
Colleges and universities across the United States and Canada sign up to participate in the CCN competition in the fall. The CCN website provides "How To" guides and checklists for organizing teams to plan their individual programming and competitions. The schools are responsible for designing and running their own events, with support from Campus Conservation Nationals and Lucid. They choose the campus buildings whose electricity and/or water data they want to collect. This data is monitored by meters in the buildings, collected by or input into Lucid's BuildingOS, then represented visually on Building Dashboard. Lucid Design Group provides its software to give schools a way to visualize and keep track of their resource usage.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.usgbc.org/articles/us-green-building-council-and-lucid-launch-campus-conservation-nationals-2014|title = U.S. Green Building Council and Lucid to Launch Campus Conservation Nationals 2014|date = 17 September 2013|accessdate = 25 February 2015|website = |publisher = U.S. Green Building Council|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each college or university holds its own three-week competition. Various campus buildings will compete against one another to provide incentive for students to reduce their energy and/or water consumption. The goal is for students to see how changing their behavior can make a difference. The organizing team at each school plans its own set of marketing strategies and competition events to spread awareness. In addition to holding the national competition, CCN also holds a poster competition for the "most innovative outreach poster" used in their campaigns.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Throughout the competitions, data can be viewed by all students on their school's Building Dashboard page, which shows each campus building's energy consumption across different time scales, the percent reduction in energy consumption so far, and more. At the end of the national competition run, from February to April, the data from every participating school is compared.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2012, 94 colleges and universities in North America participated in the Campus Conservation Nationals program, and 1.7 million kWh of electricity were saved in total. This equals a savings of about $160,000 in energy costs, and it prevented about 2.6 million pounds of CO&lt;sub&gt;2 &lt;/sub&gt;from entering the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.competetoreduce.org/2012|title = Campus Conservation Nationals 2012|date = 2012|accessdate = 26 February 2015|website = |publisher = Campus Conservation Nationals|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only six campuses were competing in the national competition.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The five schools with the greatest percent of electricity reduction were [[Bowling Green State University]], [[Hofstra University]], [[Connecticut State University System|South Connecticut State University]], [[University of Kentucky]], and [[Western Technical College]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== 2013 ===
The 2013 competition of Campus Conservation Nationals saw 120 participating colleges and universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://news.wfu.edu/2013/05/16/media-advisory-wake-forest-makes-top-5-in-campus-conservation-nationals-2013/|title = Media Advisory: Wake Forest makes top 5 in Campus Conservation Nationals 2013|last = Walker|first = Cheryl|date = 16 May 2013|work = |access-date = 26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2,115,000 kWh of electricity were saved in total by all of the participants. This is the amount of energy that would be saved if 187 U.S. homes were taken off of the power grid for a year. 1,680,000 gallons of water were saved during the competition as well.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The top five schools who reduced the electricity consumption the most were [[Harvey Mudd College]], [[Northwest Missouri State University]], [[Oregon State University]], [[St. John's University (New York City)|St. John's University]], and [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]. [[Cal Poly Pomona]], [[Indiana University]], [[Northwestern University]], [[Oberlin College]], and [[Wake Forest University]] were the top five schools for Greatest Overall Percent Reduction in Water Use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.competetoreduce.org/2013/|title = Campus Conservation Nationals 2013|date = |accessdate = 26 February 2015|website = Campus Conservation Nationals|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2014 ===
109 colleges and universities participated in the 2014 College Conservation Nationals competition. Over 2.2 million kWh of electricity were saved in total. That is equal to preventing 3 million pounds of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere. 476,000 gallons of water were also saved in the 2014 competition. The top ten schools for largest campus-wide electricity reduction were [[Appalachian State University]], [[Bard College]], [[Berea College]], [[California State University Chico|Cal State Chico]], [[Dickinson College]], [[Louisiana State University]], [[Loyola University Maryland]], [[Portland State University]], [[Wake Forest University]], and [[Western Carolina University]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 2014 saw many repeat schools who were making this event a tradition on their campuses.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Building Dashboard ==
Building Dashboard is Lucid Design Group's online interface that helps organizations track their building's energy and water consumption.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://luciddesigngroup.com/buildingdashboard/index.html|title = What is Building Dashboard|date = 2015|accessdate = 12 February 2015|website = Lucid|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It provides real-time feedback of this data, to help convince inhabitants that their behavior change creates results. The energy usage is measured in kilowatt-hours. The interactive website features graphs that illustrate energy usage for every metered building on a university's campus. The settings can be changed to display energy usage over a certain time period: the month, the week, or the day. If a competition is happening, students can view which campus building has saved the most energy thus far on their school's main Building Dashboard page.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The site allows the public to view the statistics in terms of monetary savings, CO&lt;sub&gt;2 &lt;/sub&gt;emissions, and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://energy.tdprofiti.com/unl-to-host-first-energy-saving-competition-in-residence-halls.html|title = UNL to horde initial energy-saving foe in chateau halls|date = 2 April 2014|accessdate = 12 March 2015|website = Energy News|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''century of humiliation''' ({{zh|s=百年国耻|t=百年國恥|w=pai3-nien2 kuo2-chʻih3|p=bǎinián guóchǐ}}), also known by permutations such as the '''hundred years of national humiliation''', refers to the period of intervention and [[imperialism]] by [[Western world|Western powers]] and [[Imperial Japan|Japan]] in [[China]] between 1839 and 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1976-5118.2010.01039.x | volume=25 | issue=1 | title=The "Century of Humiliation," Then and Now: Chinese Perceptions of the International Order | year=2010 | journal=Pacific Focus | pages=1–33 | last1 = Adcock Kaufman | first1 = Alison}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term arose in 1915, in the atmosphere of rising [[Chinese nationalism]] opposing the [[Twenty-One Demands]] made by the Japanese government and their acceptance by [[Yuan Shikai]], with the [[Kuomintang]] and [[Chinese Communist Party]] both subsequently popularizing the characterization.&lt;ref name="NationalHum"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilpatrick|first=Ryan|title=National Humiliation in China|publisher=e-International Relations|date=20 October 2011|url=http://www.e-ir.info/2011/10/20/national-humiliation-in-china/|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The beginning of the Century of Humiliation is usually dated to the mid-19th century, on the eve of the [[First Opium War]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Paul A Cohen | title = China Unbound | publisher = [[Routledge]] | location = London | year = 2003 | page = 148}}&lt;/ref&gt; amidst widespread opium addiction and the political unraveling of [[Qing China]] that followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Chang | first = Maria Hsia | title = Return of the dragon: China's wounded nationalism | publisher = Westview Press | year = 2001 | location = | pages = 69–70 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KYmiafRQP10C&amp;pg=PA69 | isbn = 978-0-8133-3856-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major events cited as part of the Century of Humiliation include:

* Defeat in the First Opium War (1839–1842) by [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]]
* The [[Unequal treaty|unequal treaties]] (in particular [[Treaty of Nanking|Nanking]], [[Treaty of Whampoa|Whampoa]], [[Treaty of Aigun|Aigun]] and [[Treaty of Shimonoseki|Shimonoseki]])
* The [[Taiping Rebellion]] (1850–1864)
* Defeat in the [[Second Opium War]] (1856–1860) and the sacking of the [[Old Summer Palace]] by [[British Empire|British]] and [[Second French Empire|French]] forces.
* Defeat in the [[Sino-French War]] (1884–1885) by [[French Third Republic|France]]
* Defeat in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] (1894–1895) by [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]
* The [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] suppressing the [[Boxer Rebellion|Boxer uprising]] (1899–1901)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=China's New Nationalism: Pride, Politics, and Diplomacy |last=Gries |first=Peter Hays |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-520-93194-7 |publisher=University of California Press |pages=43–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[British invasion of Tibet]] (1903–1904)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/10/world/asia/10gyantse.html "China Seizes on a Dark Chapter for Tibet"], by Edward Wong, ''The New York Times'', August 9, 2010 (August 10, 2010 p. A6 of NY ed.). Retrieved 2010-08-10.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Twenty-One Demands]] (1915) by Japan
* [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria]] (1931-1932)
* The [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (1937–1945)

In this period, China suffered major internal fragmentation, lost almost all of the wars it fought, and was often forced to give major concessions to the [[great power]]s in the [[Unequal treaty|subsequent treaties]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://app1.chinadaily.com.cn/star/2003/1120/cu18-1.html|title=Poisoned path to openness|first=Lan|last=Nike|publisher=[[Shanghai Star]]|date=2003-11-20|accessdate=2010-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, China was forced to pay large amounts of [[War reparations|reparations]], open up ports for trade, [[List of former foreign enclaves in China|lease or cede territories]] (such as [[Outer Manchuria]] and [[Outer Northwest China]] to [[Russian Empire|Russia]], [[Kiautschou Bay concession|Jiaozhou Bay]] to [[German colonial empire|Germany]], [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] to Great Britain, [[Guangzhouwan|Zhanjiang]] to France, and [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Taiwan]] and the [[Kwantung Leased Territory|Liaodong Peninsula]] to Japan) and make various other concessions of sovereignty to foreign "[[Sphere of influence|spheres of influence]]", following military defeats.

===End of humiliation===
When or whether the Century has ended has been open to different interpretations. Both [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and [[Mao Zedong]] declared the end of the Century of Humiliation in the [[aftermath of World War II]], with Chiang promoting his [[Anti-Japanese volunteer armies|wartime resistance to Japanese rule]] and China's place among the Big Four in the victorious [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in 1945, while Mao declared it with the [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|establishment]] of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949.

Extraterritorial jurisdiction was abandoned by the United Kingdom and the United States in 1943. Chiang Kai-shek forced the French to hand over all their concessions back to China control after World War II.

The end of the Century was similarly declared in the [[People's Volunteer Army|repulsion of UN forces in the Korean War]], the 1997 [[Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|reunification with Hong Kong]], the 1999 [[Transfer of sovereignty over Macau|reunification with Macau]], and even the hosting of the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in Beijing.&lt;ref name="NationalHum" /&gt;

==Implications==
The usage of the Century of Humiliation in the [[Chinese Communist Party]]'s [[Chinese historiography|historiography]] and modern Chinese nationalism, with its focus on the "sovereignty and integrity of [Chinese] territory",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=W A Callahan|title=National Insecurities: Humiliation, Salvation and Chinese Nationalism|journal=Alternatives|volume=20|issue=2004|pages=199|url=http://www.humiliationstudies.org/documents/CallahanChina.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been invoked in incidents like the [[US bombing of the People's Republic of China embassy in Belgrade|US bombing of the Chinese Belgrade embassy]], the [[Hainan Island incident]], and protests for [[Tibetan independence movement|Tibetan independence]] along the [[2008 Summer Olympics torch relay|2008 Beijing Olympics torch relay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Jayshree Bajoria | title = Nationalism in China | url = http://www.cfr.org/publication/16079/nationalism_in_china.html | work = Council on Foreign Relations | date = April 23, 2008 | access-date = 2009-11-12 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091014110116/http://www.cfr.org/publication/16079/nationalism_in_china.html# | archive-date = 2009-10-14 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some analysts have pointed to its use in deflecting foreign criticism of [[Human rights in China|human rights abuses in China]] and domestic attention from issues of [[Corruption in China|corruption]], while bolstering its [[Foreign relations of China#International territorial disputes|territorial claims]] and [[China's peaceful rise|general economic and political rise]].&lt;ref name="NationalHum" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Narratives Of Humiliation: Chinese And Japanese Strategic Culture – Analysis|work=Eurasia Review|publisher=International Relations and Security Network|date=23 April 2012|url=http://www.eurasiareview.com/23042012-narratives-of-humiliation-chinese-and-japanese-strategic-culture-analysis/|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Callahan|first=William|title=China: The Pessoptimist Nation|publisher=The China Beat|date=15 August 2008|url=http://www.thechinabeat.org/?p=210|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{main|Military history of China before 1911#Modernization|Self-Strengthening Movement}}
Jane E. Elliott criticized the allegation that China refused to modernize or was unable to defeat Western armies as simplistic, noting that China embarked on a massive military modernization in the late 1800s after several defeats, buying weapons from Western countries and manufacturing their own at arsenals, such as the [[Hanyang Arsenal]] during the [[Boxer Rebellion]]. In addition, Elliott questioned the claim that while Chinese society was traumatized by the Western victories, as many Chinese peasants (90% of the population at that time) living outside the concessions continued about their daily lives, uninterrupted and without any feeling of "humiliation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wWvl9O4Gn1UC&amp;q=chinese+fire+power+pinned+down+enemy#v=snippet&amp;q=defeat%20peasants%20not%20humiliated%20at%20all&amp;f=false|title=Some did it for civilisation, some did it for their country: a revised view of the boxer war|author=Jane E. Elliott|year=2002|publisher=Chinese University Press|location=|page=143|isbn=962-996-066-4|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians have judged the Qing dynasty's vulnerability and weakness to foreign imperialism in the 19th century to be based mainly on its maritime naval weakness while it achieved military success against westerners on land, the historian Edward L. Dreyer said that "China’s nineteenth-century humiliations were strongly related to her weakness and failure at sea. At the start of the First Opium War, China had no unified navy and not a sense of how vulnerable she was to attack from the sea. British navy forces sailed and steamed wherever they wanted to go. In the [[Arrow War]] (1856-60), the Chinese had no way to prevent the Anglo-French navy expedition of 1860 from sailing into the Gulf of Zhili and landing as near as possible to Beijing. Meanwhile, new but not exactly modern Chinese armies suppressed the midcentury rebellions, [[Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1881)|bluffed Russia into a peaceful settlement of disputed frontiers in Central Asia]], and [[Battle of Bang Bo (Zhennan Pass)|defeated the French forces on land in the Sino-French War (1884-85)]]. But the defeat at sea, and the resulting threat to steamship traffic to Taiwan, forced China to conclude peace on unfavorable terms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=PO  |first=Chung-yam |date=28 June 2013 |publisher=Ruprecht-Karls-Universität Heidelberg |title=Conceptualizing the Blue Frontier: The Great Qing and the Maritime World in the Long Eighteenth Century |type= |chapter= |page=11 |docket= |oclc= |url=http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/volltextserver/18877/1/PhD_Dissertation_CyPO.pdf |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ceremony of the Keys''' is held in [[Holyrood Palace]], [[Edinburgh]], at the start of the British monarch's week-long residence there in July. Soon after the monarch's arrival, in the forecourt of the Palace, the Queen or King is symbolically offered the keys to the city of Edinburgh by the [[Lord Provost]]. The monarch returns the keys, saying:
{{quote|I return these keys, being perfectly convinced that they cannot be placed in better hands than those of the Lord Provost and Councillors of my good City of Edinburgh.}}

A Ceremony of the Keys is also held at the start of the [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]] when the [[Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland|Lord High Commissioner]], as the Monarch's representative, receives the keys from the Lord Provost.

Developed by Drs. ''J. David Hawkins'' and ''Richard Catalano'' at the University of Washington's ''Social Development Research Group'' (SDRG), CTC's principal strategy, the '''''Social Development Strategy''''' (right), focuses on strengthening protective factors that can buffer young people from problem behaviors and promote positive youth development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF01325432 | pmid = 24271382 | last1 = Hawkins | first1 = J.

CTC is grounded in rigorous research from [[social work]], [[public health]], [[psychology]], [[education]], [[medicine]], [[criminology]], and [[organizational development]]. It engages all community members who have a stake in healthy futures for young people and sets priorities for action based on community challenges and strengths.

== Research base ==

=== Public health understanding of risk and protective factors ===

The field of public health [https://www.cdc.gov/] has developed a systematic [[methodology]] for understanding and effectively preventing health problems.  Through rigorous research, the [[etiology]] of diseases has been documented, and the factors contributing to those diseases have been identified.  Once these contributing factors are understood, careful study and application of approaches to amend those factors have demonstrated reductions in the [[disease burden]].  For example, [[heart disease]] has been one of the primary causes of death among American adults.  Research shows, however, that adequate [[exercise]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.healthline.com/health/heart-disease/exercise-statistics]&lt;/ref&gt;, a healthy [[diet (nutrition)|diet]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpao/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;, and avoidance of [[smoking]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/]&lt;/ref&gt; can help to prevent heart disease.  These behaviors are considered protective factors, just as smoking, [[high blood pressure]], and a family history of heart disease are considered [[risk factor]]s for poor heart health.

Since the late 1970s, researchers in a variety of disciplines (for example, criminology, [[sociology]], social work, psychology, [[community psychology]], education) have been applying this public health approach to the study of  the healthy development of young people.  This work has created a field called [[Prevention Science|prevention science]], [http://www.preventionscience.org/] which identifies the factors that contribute to the healthy development of children and youth (protective factors) and the factors that impede that development (risk factors).

=== Cause: Longitudinal studies of youth development ===

'' Protective Factors and the Social Development Model. ''
The prevention of health and behavior problems in young people requires, at its foundation, the promotion of the factors required for positive development. Research shows that five basic factors promote positive [[social development]]: opportunities for developmentally appropriate involvement, skills, recognition for effort, improvement and achievement, strong social bonds, and clear, consistent standards for behavior. All children need opportunities to be actively involved with positive adults and peers, the skills to participate and succeed in social, school, and civic settings, and recognition for their efforts, improvements, and accomplishments. When young people are provided with opportunities, skills, and recognition, they develop strong social bonds, that is connections with and commitment to the families, schools, and communities that provided them. When families, schools, and communities communicate to young people clear standards for behavior, those who feel bonded, emotionally connected, invested in the group, will follow those standards that promote health and success. These five factors are protective factors that promote positive development in young people (Hawkins &amp; Weis, 1985), and form the basis for the Social Development Model.

'' Risk Factors. ''  Research has also identified risk factors that can interrupt the process of positive social development. High quality [[longitudinal studies]] have identified risk factors in neighborhoods and communities, families, schools, and peer groups, as well as in individuals themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.112.1.64 | last1 = Hawkins | first1 = J.

''OJJDP Juvenile Justice Bulletin, April.''&lt;/ref&gt; These factors increase the probability of delinquency, violence, substance abuse, [[teen pregnancy]], dropping out of school, and other behavior problems in young people. The risk factors shown in the risk factor chart (right) have been found in at least two high-quality studies to predict later health and behavior problems in young people. Many of these risk factors predict multiple problems. For example, the risk factor of “Poor Family Management” has been shown to predict five youth problem behaviors:  substance abuse, delinquency, teen pregnancy, school drop-out, and violence.  Providing effective parent training programs in a community, therefore, could potentially impact all five of these undesirable outcomes.

=== Intervention: Testing effectiveness of interventions ===

The identification of risk and protective factors provides the foundation for advances in preventing [[adolescent health]] and behavior problems. Prevention scientists have rigorously tested programs and policies that address these risk and protective factors in studies funded largely by the [[National Institutes of Health]], and an increasing number and range of effective prevention approaches have now been identified.  By 2004, 56 tested and effective programs were available in the United States that have been demonstrated to reduce involvement in problem behaviors and/or increase positive outcomes for youth. These 56 effective programs and policies are summarized in CTC's Prevention Strategies Guide at https://www.communitiesthatcare.net/Prevention%20Strategies%20Guide/introduction.pdf&lt;ref&gt;https://www.communitiesthatcare.net/Prevention%20Strategies%20Guide/introduction.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. Sixteen of these programs have been tested at least twice with replicated findings and have been designated as ''Blueprint model programs'',&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, D. S. (1997). ''Blueprints for Violence Prevention.'' Boulder, CO: University of Colorado, Institute of Behavioral Science, Center for the Study and Prevention of Violence.&lt;/ref&gt; which, if rigorously followed, will significantly reduce youth violence and substance abuse.  Programs range from prenatal (for example, Olds, 1997&lt;ref&gt;Olds, D.L. (1997).  The Prenatal/Early Infancy Project:  Fifteen years later.  In G.W. Albee &amp; T. Bullotta (Eds.), ''Primary prevention works'' (pp.41–67).  Thousand Oaks, CA:  Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;) and early childhood interventions (for example, Reid et al., 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S1077-7229(01)80011-0 | last1 = Reid | first1 = M.J. | last2 = Webster-Stratton | first2 = C. | year = 2001 | title = The Incredible Years parent, teacher, and child intervention:  Targeting multiple areas of risk for a young child with pervasive conduct problems using a flexible, manualized treatment program | url = | journal = Cognitive and Behavioral Practice | volume = 8 | issue = 4| pages = 377–386 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), to community policies related to alcohol (e.g. Holder et al., 2000&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1001/jama.284.18.2341 | last1 = Holder | first1 = H.D. | last2 = Gruenewald | first2 = P.J. | last3 = Ponicki | first3 = W.R. | last4 = Treno | first4 = A.J. | last5 = Grube | first5 = J.W. | last6 = Saltz | first6 = R.F. et al. | last7 = Voas | year = 2000 | first7 = RB | last8 = Reynolds | first8 = R | last9 = Davis | first9 = J | last10 = Sanchez | first10 = L | last11 = Gaumont | first11 = G | last12 = Roeper | first12 = P | title = Effect of community-based interventions on high-risk drinking and alcohol-related injuries | url = | journal = Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 284 | issue = 18| pages = 2341–2347 | pmid = 11066184 | display-authors = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), to school-based curricula that teach youth social and emotional skills that will help them navigate life (e.g. Botvin at al, 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1300/J029v12n04_01 | last1 = Botvin | first1 = G.

=== Systems: Researching systems change in states and communities ===

Prevention scientists understand that the final task arising from these research findings is the application of proven prevention programs, policies and strategies in the real world in order to enhance youth development on the ground in communities.  In collaboration with communities and state and federal governments, researchers are studying the impact that prevention science can have on the effectiveness of prevention efforts within those systems.

== Description ==

=== Five Phases ===
[[Image:CTC Five PhaseS.png|thumb|350 px|Five Phases of CTC]]

Communities That Care guides the community's prevention efforts through a five-phase process which includes: 1) Get Started—assessing community readiness to undertake collaborative prevention efforts; 2) Get Organized—getting a commitment to the CTC process from community leaders and forming a diverse and representative prevention coalition; 3) Develop a Profile—using epidemiologic data to assess prevention needs; 4) Create a Plan—choosing tested and effective prevention policies, practices, and programs based on assessment data; and 5) Implement and Evaluate—implementing the new strategies with fidelity, in a manner congruent with the programs' theory, content, and methods of delivery, and evaluating progress over time.

CTC activities are planned and carried out by the CTC Community Board, a prevention coalition of community stakeholders who work together to promote positive youth outcomes. Board members participate in a series of six CTC training workshops in which they build their coalition and learn the skills needed to install the CTC system.

Working through the five phases of CTC provides the opportunity to increase communication, collaboration, and ownership among community members and service providers invested in healthy youth development.&lt;ref name="Quinby 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Quinby | first1 = Rose K. | last2 = Hanson | first2 = Koren | last3 = Brooke-Weiss | first3 = Blair | last4 = Arthur | first4 = Michael W. | last5 = Hawkins | first5 = J. David | last6 = Fagan | first6 = Abigail A. | title = Installing the communities that care prevention system: implementation progress and fidelity in a randomized controlled trial | journal = Journal of Community Psychology | volume = 36 | pages = 313 | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1002/jcop.20194 | issue = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Phase One:  Getting Started'''.  With technical assistance provided by a CTC trainer, a community catalyst and small group of advisors assess community readiness to undertake collaborative prevention efforts, and identify the stakeholders who need to be involved.  Key activities in this phase include recruiting key leaders to serve as champions of the effort, obtaining school district support to conduct a youth survey to provide epidemiological data on risk, protection, and youth behaviors, and hiring a coordinator to manage CTC activities.

'''Phase Two:  Organizing, Introducing, Involving'''.  In Phase Two a diverse and representative prevention coalition is formed.  Specific tasks for this phase include involving and educating stakeholders who were identified in Phase One; developing a vision for the future of the community's children, and putting an organizational structure in place to help the community move toward the vision.  The first two CTC trainings are implemented in this phase:  the Key Leader Orientation (KLO) and the Community Board Orientation (CBO). These trainings introduce prevention science to community stakeholders, and help community members create an appropriate structure for the Community Board.

'''Phase Three:  Developing a Community Profile'''. This is the data collection phase, including a comprehensive community assessment of adolescent behaviors and current prevention services. This phase usually requires administration of the CTC Youth Survey [https://preventionplatform.samhsa.gov/Macro/Csap/dss_portal/templates_redesign/start1.cfm?page=http%3A%2F%2Fncadi%2Esamhsa%2Egov%2Ffeatures%2Fctc%2Fresources%2Easpx&amp;topic_id=0&amp;sect_id=1&amp;CFID=1366190&amp;CFTOKEN=66897747&amp;link_name=Communities%20That%20Care%26reg%3B]. Members of the Risk and Protective Factor Assessment Work Group participate in the Community Assessment Training, in which they learn about key data sources for risk and protective factors (such as the student survey) and how to analyze the data.  In communities already using the CTC Youth Survey, this training is tailored to help the work group interpret survey results and identify elevated risk factors, depressed protective factors, and problem behaviors prevalent among youth in the community.  From this analysis, the work group recommends priority risk and protective factors for focused attention by the CTC Board.

The second component of the community profile is an assessment of current community programs, policies, and resources that address the prioritized risk and protective factors. The Resource Assessment workgroup is trained in assessment procedures during the Community Resource Assessment Training.  The goals of the resource assessment are to identify existing evidence-based programs that address the priority factors, discern the gaps in existing program delivery, and recommend where new programs or policies are needed.

'''Phase Four:  Creating a Community Action Plan'''.  During the fourth phase of CTC, the results of the assessment process are reviewed by the full Community Board, and a community action plan is developed. The Community Plan Training (CPT) is provided to Community Boards during this phase. During this training, Board members select prevention policies and programs that target their prioritized risk factors to fill gaps in current prevention services.  The ''CTC Prevention Strategies Guide'' is a tool used during this process.  It describes prevention programs that have been demonstrated in at least one high quality research trial to be effective in changing risk, protection, and problem behaviors.  Once program choices are made, CPT participants are trained to write an action plan that sets clear, measurable goals regarding anticipated outcomes, and also develop an evaluation plan.

'''Phase Five:  Implementing and Evaluating the Community Action Plan'''.  In this phase, the CTC Board implements selected strategies, and evaluates progress over time.  Board members and staff for the selected preventive programs attend the final CTC training workshop, the Community Plan Implementation Training (CPIT), which emphasizes the importance of implementing prevention programs with fidelity; that is, ensuring that the programs' content, dosage, and manner of delivery adhere to the protocols identified by program developers. Participants also learn methods for tracking implementation progress, assessing desired changes in participants, and using this information to adjust implementation as needed to fulfill program objectives.

CTC is intended as an ongoing process. The process of monitoring implementation progress and community level changes in risk, protection and youth outcomes is repeated every two years.  Based on a review of these data, CTC boards revise their action plans as needed.

=== Essential components ===
The CTC system is collaborative, proactive, science-based, and data driven, and provides structure, tools, training and technical assistance for coalitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brooke-Weiss | first1 = B. | last2 = Haggerty | first2 = K. P. | last3 = Fagan | first3 = A. A. | last4 = Hawkins | first4 = J. D. | last5 = Cady | first5 = R. | year = 2008 | title = Creating community change to improve youth development: The Communities That Care (CTC) system | url =http://www.tpronline.org/article.cfm/Creating_Community_Change | journal = The Prevention Researcher | volume = 15 | issue = 2| pages = 21–24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Collaborative'''. CTC uses a coalition approach to address issues at the community level.  The coalition will include a diverse group of stakeholders concerned with youth development (youth-serving agency staff, school representatives, health professionals, city leaders, [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]], [[United Way of America|United Way]], other funding entities, neighborhood groups, business people, parents, media representatives, faith community members, youth, etc.) in applying prevention science principles to decisions affecting the community's youth. By providing a setting and common language for all stakeholders to discuss prevention, the model ensures that all voices in the community are heard and respected.

'''Proactive'''. Rather than reacting to problems once they have already occurred, CTC focuses on strengthening protections and decreasing risks in order to promote healthy youth development and decrease the likelihood of problem behaviors.

'''Science based'''. CTC is grounded in rigorous research from a variety of disciplines, including public health, sociology, psychology, criminology, and community psychology. This research has identified the ''predictors'' of youth problem behaviors, developed epidemiologic ''assessment tools'' for measuring those predictors in a community, and tested ''programs that work'' in addressing those predictors.

'''Data driven'''. The CTC system ensures local control of decisions based on local data and needs assessments, and flexibility to implement actions specific to the priorities identified by community members. The CTC system provides tools for measuring levels of risk and protective factors, selecting priority factors on which to focus a strategic plan, selecting appropriate prevention responses, and tracking progress toward desired changes in priority risk factors.

a. The ''CTC Youth Survey'' is the primary tool for needs assessment and monitoring. This is a confidential, schoolwide survey for students appropriate for Grades 6-12, that measures a majority of the risk and protective factors identified to predict youth problem behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.evalprogplan.2007.01.009 | last1 = Arthur | first1 = M. W. | last2 = Briney | first2 = J. S. | last3 = Hawkins | first3 = J. D. | last4 = Abbott | first4 = R. D. | last5 = Brooke-Weiss | first5 = B. L. | last6 = Catalano | first6 = R. F. | year = 2007 | title = Measuring risk and protection in communities using the Communities That Care Youth Survey | url = | journal = Evaluation and Program Planning | volume = 30 | issue = 2| pages = 197–211 | pmid = 17689325 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s10940-004-1788-1 | last1 = Glaser | first1 = RR | last2 = Horn | first2 = Van | last3 = ML | first3 =  Michael W.| last4 = Arthur | first4 = MW | last5 = Hawkins | first5 = JD | last6 = Catalano | first6 = RF. | year = 2005 | title = Measurement properties of the Communities That Care Youth Survey across demographic groups | url = | journal = Journal of Quantitative Criminology | volume = 21 | issue = 1| pages = 73–102 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Arthur | first1 = M.

J. | last6 = Jr | year = 2002 | title = Measuring risk and protective factors for substance use, delinquency, and other adolescent problem behaviors: The Communities That Care Youth Survey | url = | journal = Evaluation Review | volume = 26 | issue = 6| pages = 575–601 | pmid = 12465571 | doi=10.1177/019384102237850}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Coalition members use survey results from students in their community as well as community archival data to prioritize risk and protective factors for attention. The survey is re-administered every 2 years in order to monitor progress over time.

b. ''Effective program selection'' is another element of the data-driven process.  Coalition members review policies and programs that have been tested and proven effective in addressing their priority factors.  They consider the suitability of each program to the community's circumstances, and select prevention responses most likely to be successful in that environment. Information on program effectiveness is summarized in menus of effective programs, for example CTC's Prevention Strategies Guide&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.preventionplatform.samhsa.gov/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120423073246/https://www.preventionplatform.samhsa.gov/ |archivedate=2012-04-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Blueprint for Violence Prevention]] list of effective programs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.colorado.edu/cspv/blueprints/model/overview.html&lt;/ref&gt;

c. ''Monitoring of program implementation'' is the third element of the data-driven process.  Throughout the implementation cycle of each prevention program or strategy, coalitions collect data to ensure that the program is delivered with fidelity to the original program design. This monitoring information is important, because without close replication, the effectiveness of these programs can be compromised (see, for example, Elliot &amp; Mihalic, 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1023/B:PREV.0000013981.28071.52 | last1 = Elliott | first1 = D. S. | last2 = Mihalic | first2 = S. | year = 2004 | title = Issues in disseminating and replicating effective prevention rograms | url = | journal = Prevention Science | volume = 5 | issue = 1| pages = 47–53 | pmid = 15058912 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). Monitoring implementation is also a management tool for identifying challenges that can be addressed before they lead to program failure.

'''Structure and tools'''. The CTC structure includes six training workshops and additional tools that help walk community members through each stage of the process. Training manuals are composed of modules that provide comprehensive information, exercises, and guidelines for each stage of the process. The ''Milestones and Benchmarks'' checklist [https://preventionplatform.samhsa.gov/Macro/Csap/dss_portal/templates_redesign/start1.cfm?page=http%3A%2F%2Fncadi%2Esamhsa%2Egov%2Ffeatures%2Fctc%2Fresources%2Easpx&amp;topic_id=0&amp;sect_id=1&amp;CFID=1366190&amp;CFTOKEN=66897747&amp;link_name=Communities%20That%20Care%26reg%3B] functions as a roadmap for the entire effort.  Milestones are major tasks that must be accomplished in each phase of CTC, and benchmarks provide essential steps toward achieving each of these major tasks.&lt;ref name="Quinby 2008" /&gt; Booklets are available to help local leaders evaluate and address community readiness issues before initiating the process, and to explain the system to key leaders and potential board members.

'''Training and technical assistance'''. Successful CTC efforts include high-quality training and technical assistance from experienced and certified facilitators. Feinberg et al. (2004),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1023/B:AJCP.0000027003.75394.2b | last1 = Feinberg | first1 = M.E. | last2 = Greenberg | first2 = M.T. | last3 = Osgood | first3 = W.O. | year = 2004 | title = Readiness, functioning, and perceived effectiveness in community prevention coalitions: A study of Communities That Care | url = | journal = American Journal of Community Psychology | volume = 33 | issue = 3/4| pages = 163–177 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gomez et al. (2005)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gomez | first1 = B.J. | last2 = Greenberg | first2 = M.T. | last3 = Feinberg | first3 = M.E. | year = 2005 | title = Sustainability of prevention coalitions | url = | journal = Prevention Science | volume = 6 | issue = 3| pages = 199–202 | pmid = 16079961 | doi = 10.1007/s11121-005-0003-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Greenberg et al. (2005)&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, M.T., Feinberg, M.E., &amp; Osgood, W.O.  (2005).  Testing a community prevention focused model of coalition functioning and sustainability.  Editors: Stockwell, T., Gruenewald, P., Toumbourou, J., &amp; Loxley, W.  Preventing Harmful Substance Use: The Evidence Base for Policy and Practice.&lt;/ref&gt; studied the functioning and sustainability of CTC coalitions in Pennsylvania, and found three factors strongly related to effective coalition function: community organizational and motivational readiness, initial training, and ongoing technical assistance (TA). The Pennsylvania study also documented that the sustainability of the effort was predicted by the prevention knowledge of coalition members, the quality of coalition functioning, and their fidelity to the CTC model.

=== Tested and effective programs ===
A cornerstone of effective community-level prevention involves the implementation of appropriate responses to the priority needs identified during the assessment phase of the process.  The CTC system guides community groups to choose and implement appropriate [[Evidence-based practice|tested and effective programs]], policies, and practices in families, schools, and communities (see the CTC Prevention Strategies Guide and the Blueprints for Violence Prevention website). These programs have shown significant effects on minimizing youths' risky behaviors and enhancing positive choices.

==Evaluation results==

===Evaluation of implementation===
The CYDS evaluated community efforts to faithfully implement (1) the core principles of the CTC prevention system, and (2) tested and effective prevention programs with respect to content and delivery specifications. The study found that CTC communities achieved high implementation fidelity at the system and program levels when supported by training and technical assistance in CTC.  Control communities did not achieve these things.
At the start of the CYDS, CTC and control communities did not differ in their use of a science-based approach to prevention.&lt;ref name="Hawkinsetal2008"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s11121-008-0092-y | last1 = Hawkins | first1 = J.D. | last2 = Catalano | first2 = R.F. | last3 = Arthur | first3 = M.W. | last4 = Egan | first4 = E. | last5 = Brown | first5 = E.C. | last6 = Abbott | first6 = R.D. | last7 = Murray | first7 = D.M. | year = 2008 | title = Testing Communities That Care: The Rationale, Design and Behavioral Baseline Equivalence of the Community Youth Development Study | url = | journal = Prevention Science | volume = 9 | issue = 3| pages = 178–190 | pmid = 18516681 | pmc = 2562862 }} (NIH Submission # 46898)&lt;/ref&gt; By the third year of the intervention, key leaders in CTC communities reported a higher stage of adoption of science-based prevention, relative to control communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Brown |first1= E.C. |last2= Hawkins |first2= J.D. |last3= Arthur |first3= M.W. |last4= Briney |first4= J.S. |first5= Fagan |last5= A.A. |year= 2011 |title= Prevention service system transformation using Communities That Care |journal= Journal of Community Psychology. |volume= 39 |pages= 183–201 |doi= 10.1002/jcop.20426 |pmid= 23606774 |issue= 2 |pmc=3629975}}&lt;/ref&gt;   They also were willing to provide greater funding for prevention. Differences were sustained one year after the implementation phase of the trial ended. At this point, key leaders in CTC communities also reported significantly stronger community norms against adolescent drug use.&lt;ref name="Rhewunderreview"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Rhew |first1= I.C. |last2= Brown|first2= E.C. | last3= Hawkins | first3= J.D. | year= under review |title= Sustained effects of Communities That Care on prevention service system transformation |last4=Briney|first4= J.S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The CTC Milestones and Benchmarks Survey was used to track progress in the implementation of core components of the CTC prevention system. In each year of the intervention, CTC communities enacted an average of 90% of the key features of the CTC prevention system, including developing a community board, prioritizing risk and protective factors, selecting tested and effective preventive interventions from the Communities That Care Prevention Strategies Guide, implementing selected implementation programs with fidelity, and periodically assessing risk and protective factors and child and adolescent well-being through surveys of students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Fagan |first1= A.A. | last2= Hanson |first2= K. |last3= Hawkins |first3= J.D. |last4= Arthur |first4= M.W.| year= 2009 |title= Translational research in action: Implementation of the Communities That Care prevention system in 12 communities |journal= Journal of Community Psychology |volume= 37 |pages= 809–829 |doi= 10.1002/jcop.20332 |pmid= 22121303 |issue= 7 |pmc=3222885}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Quinby |first1= R.K. |last2= Fagan |first2= A.A. |last3= Hanson | first3= K. | last4= Brooke-Weiss | first4= B. | last5= Arthur | first5= M.W. | last6= Hawkins | first6= J.D. | year= 2008 |title= Installing the Communities That Care prevention system: Implementation progress and fidelity in a randomized controlled trial|journal= Journal of Community Psychology |volume= 36 |pages= 313–332. |doi= 10.1002/jcop.20194 |issue= 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One year after the implementation phase of the trial had ended, eleven of 12 CTC coalitions continued to operate in CTC communities.

===Impact evaluations===

* Pennsylvania
The [http://www.prevention.psu.edu Prevention Research Center at Pennsylvania State University] has been studying the process and impact of the statewide CTC system since its inception in the early 1990s.  Summaries of their findings will be posted here soon.

* '''Community Youth Development Study'''

The Community Youth Development Study (CYDS) is the first controlled experimental trial of the Communities That Care system. Twenty-four communities in 7 states agreed to participate in the study.  These communities consisted of 12 matched pairs which had equivalent demographics and equivalent levels of youth risks and problem behaviors at the start of the study.&lt;ref name="Hawkinsetal2008" /&gt;  Communities were randomly assigned to intervention or control conditions.  The intervention communities received funding to hire a full-time community coordinator, who formed a community coalition that subsequently participated in the full cycle of CTC trainings.  These communities then created community action plans, and were awarded up to $75,000 per year for the next four years to implement the tested, effective prevention strategies selected as part of the action planning process.  Control communities continued prevention business as usual.

Hawkins et al. 2008,&lt;ref name="Hawkinsetal2008earlyeffects"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2008.01.022 | last1 = Hawkins | first1 = J.D. | last2 = Brown | first2 = E.C. | last3 = Oesterle | first3 = S. | last4 = Arthur | first4 = M.W. | last5 = Abbott | first5 = R.D. | last6 = Catalano | first6 = R.F. | year = 2008 | title = Early effects of Communities That Care on targeted risks and initiation of delinquent behavior and substance use | url = | journal = Journal of Adolescent Health | volume = 43 | issue = 1| pages = 15–22 | pmid = 18565433 | pmc = 3867289 }}&lt;/ref&gt; reported finding no significant differences between CTC and control communities in average levels of community-targeted risks among students in fifth grade, prior to the start of the CTC programs. By the third year of the intervention, key leaders in CTC communities reported a higher stage of adoption of science-based prevention, relative to control communities, .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/jcop.20426| last1 = Brown | first1 = E.C. | last2 = Arthur | first2 = M.W. | last3 = Briney | first3 = J.S. | last4 = Fagan | first4 = A.A. | year = 2011 | title = Prevention service system transformation using Communities That Care | url = | journal = Journal of Community Psychology | volume = 39 | issue = 2| pages = 183–201 | pmid = 23606774| last5 = Fagan | first5 = Abigail A. | pmc=3629975}}&lt;/ref&gt;   They also were willing to provide greater funding for prevention. Differences were sustained one year after the implementation phase of the trial ended. At this point, key leaders in CTC communities also reported significantly stronger community norms against adolescent drug use.&lt;ref name="Rhewunderreview" /&gt; The longitudinal panel youth in CTC and control communities reported similar levels of targeted risk in Grade 5, when the intervention began,&lt;ref name="Hawkinsetal2008earlyeffects" /&gt; but targeted risk exposure grew more slowly for youth in CTC communities between Grade 5 and Grade 10.&lt;ref name="Hawkinsetal2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Hawkins |first1= J.D. |last2= Oesterle |first2= S. |last3= Brown | first3= E.C. |last4=Monahan| first4= K.C. |last5=Abbpt| first5= R.D. | last6= Arthur | first6= M.W. |last7=Catalano|first7=R.F.| year= 2012 |title= Sustained decreases in exposure and youth problem behaviors after installation of the Communities That Care prevention system in a randomized trial |journal=Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine|volume=166|issue=2|pages=141–148|pmid= 21969362|doi=10.1001/archpediatrics.2011.183|pmc=4137869}}&lt;/ref&gt; Significantly lower levels of targeted risk were first reported by CTC panel youth 1.67 years into the intervention, in Grade 7, and have continued to be reported by CTC panel youth through Grade 10.

Panel youth from CTC and control communities also reported similar levels of delinquency, alcohol use, and cigarette smoking at Grade 5 baseline. However, between Grades 5 and 10, CTC had significant effects on the initiation of these behaviors by youth.  Significant differences in the initiation of delinquency were first observed in the spring of Grade 7.  Panel youth from CTC communities were 25% less likely than panel youth from control communities to initiate delinquent behavior, and they remained so in Grade 8.  Significantly lower delinquency initiation rates were sustained through Grade 10,&lt;ref name="Hawkinsetal2012" /&gt; when panel youth from CTC communities were 17% less likely to initiate delinquency than panel youth from control communities.

Preventive effects on alcohol use and cigarette use were first observed in the spring of Grade 8, 2.67 years after intervention programs were implemented. Grade 8 youth from CTC communities were 32% less likely to initiate alcohol use, and 33% less likely to initiate cigarette smoking than Grade 8 youth from control communities (Hawkins et al., 2009). Preventive effects were again sustained through Grade 10&lt;ref name="Hawkinsetal2012" /&gt; when CTC panel youth were 29% less likely to initiate alcohol use and 28% less likely to initiate cigarette smoking than panel youth from control communities.

Differences in the initiation of delinquency, alcohol use, and cigarette smoking from Grade 5 through Grade 10 led to cumulatively lower rates of initiation over time: 62% of 10th-grade youth in the panel from CTC communities had engaged in delinquent behavior compared with 70% of 10th-grade youth in the panel from control communities; 67% vs. 75% had initiated alcohol use; and 44% vs. 52% had smoked cigarettes. (insert illustration here).

CTC also significantly reduced the prevalence of youth problem behaviors in Grade 8 and Grade 10. In Grade 8, the prevalence of alcohol use in the past month, binge drinking (five or more drinks in a row) in the past two weeks, and the variety of delinquent behaviors committed in the past year were all significantly lower in CTC panel youth compared to control community panel youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Hawkins |first1= J.D. |last2= Oesterle |first2= S. |last3= Brown | first3= E.C. | last4= Arthur | first4= M.W. | last5= Abbot | first5= R.D. | last6= Fagan | first6= A.A. |year= 2009 |title= Results of a type 2 translational research trial to prevent adolescent drug use and delinquency: A test of Communities That Care|journal= Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine |volume= 163 | pages= 789–798 |doi= 10.1001/archpediatrics.2009.141 |last7= Catalano |first7= R. F. |issue= 9|pmc= 2740999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CYDS also found significant effects of CTC in reducing the prevalence of cigarette use in the past month and delinquent behavior and violence in the past year in the spring of Grade 10.&lt;ref name="Hawkinsetal2012" /&gt;
 
''Child Trends Research Brief:'' An overview of the Communities That Care system and up to date research information is available from [[Child Trends]] with an in depth research brief that can be found [http://www.childtrends.org/Files//Child_Trends_2011_10_01_RB_MobilizingComm.pdf here]. Other research is also available through the [https://web.archive.org/web/19991128013208/http://www.childtrends.org/index.cfm Child Trends Website].

''Conclusions:'' CTC's [[theory of change]] hypothesizes that it takes from 2 to 5 years to observe community-level effects on risk factors, and 5 or more years to observe effects on adolescent delinquency or substance use [insert CTC timeline graphic].  These early findings from the first randomized community trial of CTC are promising, suggesting that CTC is slowing the usual developmental increase in adolescents' risk exposure. Longer follow-up measurements are needed to determine if CTC can significantly reduce community levels of delinquency and drug use as hypothesized. The Community Youth Development Study will collect additional data from these students in 2007 and 2008. These data will allow tests of CTC's effects on community rates of delinquency and substance use initiation among young people through the spring of grade 9, almost 5 years after CTC was introduced in the intervention communities and approximately {{frac|3|1|2}} years after communities began implementing tested and effective prevention programs chosen through the CTC system.

'''Corruption in Myanmar''' is an extremely serious problem. Owing to failures in regulation and enforcement, corruption flourishes in every sector of government and business.&lt;ref name=mmt&gt;{{cite web| last =Aung| first =Nyan Lin| title =Myanmar stalls in corruption rankings march| work =Myanmar Times| date =8 Dec 2014| url =http://www.mmtimes.com/index.php/business/12444-myanmar-stalls-in-corruption-rankings-march.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mcl"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/east-asia-the-pacific/myanmar/corruption-levels.aspx|title=Myanma Corruption Levels|work=GAN Integrity Solutions|accessdate=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bcm"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/east-asia-the-pacific/myanmar/snapshot.aspx|title=Business Corruption in Myanmar|date=October 2014|work=GAN Integrity Solutions|accessdate=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many foreign businesspeople consider corruption “a serious barrier to investment and trade in Myanmar.”&lt;ref name=snap&gt;{{cite web| title =Business Corruption in Myanmar| work =Business Anti-Corruption Portal| url =http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/east-asia-the-pacific/myanmar/snapshot.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[United Nations|U.N.]] survey in May 2014 concluded that corruption is the greatest hindrance for business in Myanmar.&lt;ref name=reut&gt;{{cite web| title =Corruption the biggest concern for Myanmar businesses: survey| work =Reuters| date =6 May 2014| url =https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-corruption-idUSBREA450DS20140506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transparency International's 2017 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country 130th place out of 180 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2017|title=Corruption Perception Index 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Myanmar Business Survey 2014, corruption was the most frequently identified obstacle to business, especially with respect to obtaining firm registration, business licenses and permits from government authorities.&lt;ref name="abe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unescap.org/sites/default/files/MBS_Survey_Results.pdf|title=Myanmar Business Survey 2014: Survey Results|last=Abe Masato|author2=Margit Molnar|date=May 2014|work=Hanns Seidel Foundation|publisher=OECD and UNESCAP|accessdate=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===Saffron Revolution===
{{Main|Saffron Revolution}}

In 2007 the then Burmese government revoked several subsidies for various fuel industries, causing prices to soar throughout the nation. This sparked widespread protests due to the public's dissatisfaction with the military government. It was noted that the average citizen was displeased with the immense levels of kleptocracy in the nation, allowing members of the military dictatorship to live in a "state within a state"&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7023548.stm The hardship that sparked Burma's unrest] BBC News 2 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/6109356.stm Burma leader's lavish lifestyle aired] BBC, 2 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; with accumulated wealth far beyond that of the people. The government reacted harshly to the protests through violence and arbitrary detentions. While the official death count tallied thirteen killed, it is widely surmised that the true number far exceeded this figure. The government had even taken steps to censor [[Internet in Myanmar|internet access within the country]], though to no avail.&lt;ref name="August, 2007 Burma"&gt;{{cite web |title=Human Rights Concern |url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/all-countries/myanmar-burma/page.do?id=1011205 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217100821/http://www.amnestyusa.org/all-countries/myanmar-burma/page.do?id=1011205 |archivedate=17 February 2009 |deadurl=no |accessdate=7 April 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the demonstrations were dispersed and suppressed by the military junta, the public would later vote a new government in and wrested power from [[Than Shwe]] by 2011. Nonetheless, elements of the military government retained power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.burmanet.org/news/2007/04/23/irrawaddy-burma%e2%80%99s-junta-vows-to-crack-down-on-human-rights-activists-yeni/#more-7395 Irrawaddy: Burma's junta vows to crack down on human rights activists-Yeni] BurmaNet News, 23 April 2007.

[[File:Than Shwe 2010-10-11.jpg|thumb|left|150 px|Former Burmese Head of State [[Than Shwe]]]]

Myanmar spent five decades under military rule. This period [[Reforms in Burma|ended in 2011]], when a [[Government of Myanmar|semi-civilian government]] took power and sought to regenerate the economy and draw foreign investment. Among its objectives was the reduction of endemic corruption. As of May 2014, however, those reforms were viewed as having had a minimal effect on corruption.&lt;ref name=reut/&gt;

Every leading official in the [[State Peace and Development Council|former military regime]] is said to have “committed thousands of offenses related to corruption.”&lt;ref name=track&gt;{{cite web| title =Corruption in Burma: How the causes and consequences reflect the current situations| work =Burma Digest| url =https://track.unodc.org/LegalLibrary/LegalResources/Myanmar/Authorities/Myanmar%20-%20Corruption%20in%20Burma%20-%20How%20the%20Causes%20and%20Consequences%20Reflect%20the%20Current%20Situations%20[Burma%20Digest].pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most high-level officials in the civil service were related to military officials.&lt;ref name=track/&gt;

Since the end of military rule, Myanmar has been implementing economic reforms and developing a [[free market]], but according to one source “its nascent market economy remains bound by myriads of regulations,” which make possible rampant corruption that “hinders the functioning of the price mechanism, upon which the proper functioning of the market economy is based.”&lt;ref name=isn/&gt; Kim Ninh of the [[Asia Foundation]] said in May 2015 that despite efforts to reduce corruption after military rule, the country's business environment remained essentially the same, with few new companies emerging since 2011.&lt;ref name=reut/&gt;

An October 2015 article in ''Wired'' stated that notwithstanding attempts by the US and other Western countries to promote transparency, the majority of Myanmar's economy remains in control of a corrupt elite.&lt;ref name=wired&gt;{{cite web| last =Williams| first =Greg| title =Revealed: Myanmar's jade trade is run by former junta members| work =Wired| date =22 Oct 2015| url =https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2015-10/23/jade-trade-burma-corruption}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the privatization process, according to a report by the U4 [[Anti-Corruption Resource Centre]] that was updated in October 2014, “numerous state assets were sold to the [[Tatmadaw|military]], family members, and associates of senior government officials at fire sale prices.”&lt;ref name=issuu&gt;{{cite web| title =Overview of corruption in Burma (Myanmar)| work =Transparency International| url =http://issuu.com/cmi-norway/docs/349/1?e=1246952/2680739}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to several reports, moreover, the military influenced the results of the [[Myanmar general election, 2010|2010]] and [[Myanmar by-elections, 2012|2012]] elections by means of fraud, restrictions on political participation, and prohibition of international monitoring.&lt;ref name=issuu/&gt;

==Factors==

Some reasons for the high levels of corruption in Myanmar include multiple exchange rates, which enable officials to demand bribes for providing favorable rates; low civil-service pay rates; and a tradition of nepotism.&lt;ref name=track/&gt; “As there are no competitive selection processes to enter the public sector,” notes one report, “personal connections and bribery are maybe more important than qualifications. For instance, it is common practice to select ministers and high-level civil servants from the military ranks rather than based on expertise.”&lt;ref name=issuu/&gt;

It has been observed that post-2011 Myanmar has an expanding informal economy, and that such economies are notoriously vulnerable to corruption.&lt;ref name=util&gt;{{cite web| title =Myanma Public Services| work =Business Anti-Corruption Portal| url =http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/east-asia-the-pacific/myanmar/public-services.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of corruption==

===Petty corruption===
Petty corruption, meaning the extortion of small bribes or “gifts” in connection with everyday services, is “endemic to the everyday life of Myanmar citizens. It is particularly prevalent when citizens deal with the bureaucracy of the country and engage with low- to mid-level public officials.” It is common “in application processes for permits or documents, where bribes or gift-giving end up becoming unavoidable elements of the process, perhaps even becoming culturally engrained[,] with bribery rather being seen as gift-giving or a kind gesture.” Since gifts up to 300,000 [[Kyat]] ([[USD]] 300) are not legally regarded as corruption, there are no penalties for this kind of activity, even though it “represents a huge cost for the government, undermines trust in state institutions, and violates the principle of equal treatment of citizens.”&lt;ref name=isn/&gt;

===Business sector===
“The problem of corruption in Myanmar is particularly severe in the area of business activity,” states one source.&lt;ref name=isn/&gt;  A firm wishing a construction permit must go through an application process involving (on average) 16 procedures, a 159-day wait, and a cost of about 567% of income per capita.&lt;ref name=util/&gt; A firm wishing to get electricity must undergo 5 procedures, wait 91 days, and spend over 3000% of income per capita.&lt;ref name=util/&gt;

====Foreign business and investment====
In the Myanmar Business Survey 2014, corruption was the most frequently named obstacle to doing business in the country. Myanmar was also near the bottom of Doing Business 2014's Ease of Doing Business ranking.&lt;ref name=snap/&gt;

According to the Investment Climate Statement 2014, “investors may experience corruption when seeking investment permits or when leasing land in Myanmar.”&lt;ref name=util/&gt; The Enterprise Surveys 2014 reported that 38.9% of businesspeople were “expected to give gifts to get an operating licence,” while 55.8% were expected “to give a gift to get an electrical connection,” and 30.1% were “expected to give gifts to secure a water connection.”&lt;ref name=util/&gt; Persons applying for import and export licences are also likely to be charged illegal fees.&lt;ref name=util/&gt;

Without notice or external review, Myanmar's government routinely promulgates new regulations and laws affecting foreign investors.&lt;ref name=util/&gt;

Daniel Barrins of the [[Herbert Smith Freehills]] law firm, a partner of Australia-based [[Asialink]], has said that corruption is denying Myanmar’s citizens the benefits of foreign investment. Problems with land ownership, intellectual-property rights, and the rule of law all create difficulties for potential foreign investors, according to Barrins.&lt;ref name=mmt/&gt;

====Land====
Under the military government which ruled Myanmar until 2011, land was nationalized. According to an October 2015 report in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', land in Myanmar remains largely under the control of the military and their allies. In addition, allegations of forced evictions are still common across Myanmar.&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;{{cite web| last =Mahtani| first =Shibani; Myo, Myo| title =Myanmar’s Suu Kyi Puts Corruption Fight at Center of Campaign| work =Wall Street Journal| date =12 Oct 2015| url =https://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2015/10/12/myanmars-suu-kyi-puts-corruption-fight-at-center-of-campaign/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jade industry====
[[File:Mawsitsit (kosmochlor jade) Kachin State, Burma.jpg|thumb|150 px|left|Jade mined in Myanmar]]

The [[Jade trade in Myanmar|jade trade]] accounts for 48% of Myanmar’s official GDP.&lt;ref name=wired/&gt; An October 2015 report by ''Global Witness'' noted that Myanmar's jade industry is exploited by the nation's elites; including military leaders, drug traffickers, and business leaders. This was the finding of a year-long investigation entitled “Jade: Myanmar's 'Big State Secret,'” which identified that several leading members of the nation's government and economy had siphoned $31 billion USD worth of jade in 2014, a figure nearly half of Myanmar's economy.&lt;ref name=wired/&gt;

''Global Witness'' estimated that illegal networks in Myanmar had stolen a total $122.8 billion USD worth of jade over the previous decade, and claimed that Myanmar's jade industry is possibly the greatest natural resource racket in recent history. In addition, the nearly one hundred active jade mining deposits are located in areas controlled by about 10 to 15 military-connected businessmen, and a result the people living in those areas remain in poverty while a few businessmen profit greatly.&lt;ref name=wired/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Jeijmans| first =Philip| title =The corruption of Myanmar’s jade trade| work =Al Jazeera| date =23 Oct 2015| url =http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2015/10/corruption-myanmar-jade-trade-151022101916842.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Oil and gas====
Myanmar law requires foreign oil and gas exploration firms operating in the country to be partnered with domestic firms. These arrangements have been criticized for their lack of transparency and accountability.&lt;ref name=issuu/&gt;

====Logging====
{{main|Deforestation in Myanmar}}
As of 2006, [[illegal logging]] accounted for at least half of the logging in the country. The smuggling of timber across the Chinese border is a major activity.&lt;ref name=issuu/&gt;

====Taxation====
Taxes are collected irregularly. Over one third of respondents to a survey said they were expected to give gifts in meetings with tax officials. A medium-sized company doing business in Myanmar must make 31 separate tax payments annually. On average, this takes 155 hours' work, and involves a tax payment amounting to 48.9% of annual profits.&lt;ref name=tax/&gt;

In April 2014, a new Union Taxation Law came into effect. It is designed to help eliminate corruption in tax collection.&lt;ref name=tax/&gt;

===Political corruption===
Political corruption exists at higher levels of government, and comes into play especially “when large infrastructural works or other 'mega-projects' are being negotiated or implemented.” Companies pay bribes “to avoid trouble or delays,” and often “establish illicit networks of patronage which can be exploited in future deals.” Companies that establish such networks “are often given monopoly control over the markets or sectors they win by 'bidding,'” and this monopoly control stifles competition and growth.&lt;ref name=isn/&gt;

In the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report 2013-2014, business executives rated the incidence of corrupt diversion of public funds to companies, individuals, or groups at 2.3 on a 7-point scale (1 being “very common” and 7 “never occurs”). They rated the favoritism of government officials towards well-connected companies and individuals, as reflected in policies and contracts, a score of 2.2 on a 7-point scale (1 meaning “always show favouritism” and 7 “never show favouritism”).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Myanmar Public Procurement| work =Business Anti-Corruption Portal| url =http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/east-asia-the-pacific/myanmar/public-procurement.aspx\}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Government ministries often fail to report their own expenditures on projects.&lt;ref name=isn/&gt;

====Import, export, and customs officials====
Myanmar's import and export regulations are not transparent. According to the Global Enabling Trade 2014, corruption at the border and burdensome procedures are among the major challenges to importation of goods. Business executives gave the efficiency and transparency of border administration in Myanmar a score of 2.2 on a 7-point scale (1 being “non-transparent” and 7 “transparent”). Myanmar ranks 128th out of 138 countries in this regard.&lt;ref name=customs&gt;{{cite web| title =Myanmar Customs Administration| work =Business Anti-Corruption Portal| url =http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/east-asia-the-pacific/myanmar/customs-administration.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Businesses must bribe customs officials in order to avoid high import and export taxes. 53.5% of businesses surveyed in 2014 said that they expected to give “gifts” to obtain import licences.&lt;ref name=customs/&gt;

On average, exporting a container of goods from Myanmar involves 9 documents, takes 25 days, and costs USD 670. On average, importing a container of goods into Myanmar involves 9 documents, takes 27 days, and costs USD 660.&lt;ref name=customs/&gt;

====Buying property====
Business executives rate the protection of property rights and financial assets at 2.5 on a 7-point scale (1 being “very weak” and 7 “very strong”). Registering property involves an average of 6 procedures, a 113-day wait, and a cost amounting to 7.2% of the property's value.&lt;ref name=land&gt;{{cite web| title =Myanmar Land Administration| work =Business Anti-Corruption Portal| url =http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/east-asia-the-pacific/myanmar/land-administration.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Police and security forces====
On the World Economic Forum's 2013–14 Global Competitiveness Report, business executives scored the reliability of police services to enforce law and order at 3.0 on a 7-point scale (1 being “cannot be relied upon at all” and 7 being “can always be relied upon”).&lt;ref name=police&gt;{{cite web| title =Myanmar Police| work =Business Anti-Corruption Portal| url =http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/east-asia-the-pacific/myanmar/police.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Myanmar Police Force|Police officers]] “reportedly often ask victims of crimes to pay substantial amounts to ensure police investigate crimes; in addition, police routinely extort money from civilians.”&lt;ref name=police/&gt; Police are said to be involved in human trafficking, accepting bribes from drug lords, and to have extorted local businessmen. When a curfew was imposed following riots that took place in Mandalay in 2004, police extorted bribes from people who wanted to break the curfew.&lt;ref name=lowly&gt;{{cite web| last =Thompson| first =Rhys| title =Corruption and police reform in Myanmar| work =The Interpreter Magazine| date =18 Feb 2015| url =http://www.lowyinterpreter.org/post/2015/02/18/corruption-police-reform-Myanmar.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One reason for police corruption is that police officers were expected for many years to pay for their own investigations, without any reimbursement or compensation. This policy not only encouraged corruption but also discouraged serious investigation of crimes.&lt;ref name=lowly/&gt;

Security forces “generally act with impunity in Myanmar.” The Human Rights Report 2013 noted that a police escort for a UN rapporteur's convoy “stood by” while the convoy was attacked.&lt;ref name=police/&gt;

====Health care and education====
The low quality of Myanmar’s institutions leads to corruption in [[Health care in Myanmar|health care]] and education.&lt;ref name=isn/&gt;

====NGOs====
It is common for international and domestic NGOs to use money intended to help the public to be spent on expensive offices, residences, or other inappropriate expenses.&lt;ref name=isn/&gt;

====Judiciary====
The judiciary is corrupt and subject to government and military influence. Judiciary officials in Myanmar accept bribes for various services, such as providing access to detainees and rendering a favorable verdict. Judiciary corruption “represents a major challenge to businesspeople looking to do business in Myanmar.” In disputes with foreign firms, local businesses can use bribes to secure favorable judgments.&lt;ref name=judc&gt;{{cite web| title =Myanmar Judicial System| work =Business Anti-Corruption Portal| url =http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/east-asia-the-pacific/myanmar/judicial-system.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the World Economic Forum's 2013–14 Global Competitiveness Report, business executives rate the independence of the judiciary at 2.8 on a 7-point scale (1 being “heavily influenced” and 7 “entirely independent”).&lt;ref name=judc/&gt;

Judicial decisions about land and buildings are often affected by government influence, personal relationships, and bribery.&lt;ref name=land/&gt; It can take years to enforce a contract in the Myanmar courts.&lt;ref name=isn/&gt;

====Lobbying groups====
There are many lobbying groups in Myanmar, but they are unregulated, and “regularly resort to bribes and concessions to secure favor,” which is “abetted by the lack of transparency and accountability in Myanmar.”&lt;ref name=isn/&gt;

====Drugs====
Myanmar is one of the worlds four major [[Opium production in Myanmar|producers of opium and heroin]]. The government has expanded counter-narcotic efforts, but is “reluctant to investigate, arrest, and prosecute high level international traffickers,” according to the CIA.&lt;ref name=issuu/&gt;

==Anti-corruption efforts==
While Myanmar was still under military control, its [[Central Bank of Myanmar|Central Bank]] implemented controls in accordance with the IMF’s Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) guidelines. As a result, Myanmar was removed from the international Financial Action Task Force’s list of “Non-cooperative Countries and Territories” in October 2006.&lt;ref name=isn/&gt;

[[President of Myanmar|President]] [[Thein Sein]] has introduced a number of policies intended to reduce corruption in business.&lt;ref name=snap/&gt; A key theme of his inaugural speech on 30 March 2011, was fighting government corruption. He said that “democracy will [be] promoted only hand in hand with good governance. That is why our government responsible for Myanmar’s democratic transition will try hard to shape good administrative machinery.…We will fight corruption in cooperation with the people as it harms the image of not only the offenders, but also the nation and the people.”&lt;ref name=isn/&gt; Thein Sein has reportedly made “significant efforts to minimise corruption in the extractive industries” in hopes of attracting foreign investment.&lt;ref name=extract&gt;{{cite web| title =Myanmar Natural Resources| work =Business Anti-Corruption Portal| url =http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/east-asia-the-pacific/myanmar/natural-resources.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012, an anti-bribery bill was approved. In August 2013, an Anti-Corruption Law was passed.&lt;ref name=isn/&gt;

In April 2013, several senior government officials charged with corruption were compelled to retire or to leave departments working on investment.&lt;ref name=isn/&gt;

The Myanmar Centre for Responsible Business (MCRB) was founded in 2013. Its seeks to promote “more responsible business practices in Myanmar.” An MCRB initiative called Transparency in Myanmar Enterprise (TiME) “publishes information about anti-corruption, organizational transparency, and concern for human rights, health, and the environment among the largest businesses in Myanmar. Using criteria laid out by Transparency International the project has produced rankings of companies according to the above criteria by analyzing information they post online.”&lt;ref name=isn/&gt;

Anti-corruption laws “were further amended in 2014 to allow for the [[Assembly of the Union|parliament]] to establish a committee to investigate allegations of corruption among government officials.”&lt;ref name=isn/&gt;  The Anti-Corruption Commission was established in February 2014. It focuses mainly on bribery, which can be punished by fines and up to fifteen years in prison.&lt;ref name=isn/&gt; By December 2014, it had received almost 600 written complaints, but had addressed only three, saying that it could not act without documented evidence. MP U Ye Tun stated that the commission did not have the authority to take action effectively. An expert in governance and anti-corruption, stated in December 2014 that the commission would be unlikely to target the government or its ministries, which is where the bulk of corruption in Myanmar takes place.&lt;ref name=mmt/&gt;

A February 2014 report said that the [[Myanmar Police Force]] (MPF) had improved its ability to identify and acknowledge corruption. In 2013 the MPF arrested two senior police officers for involvement in drug smuggling.&lt;ref name=lowly/&gt;

In July 2014, Myanmar became an Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI)  candidate country.&lt;ref name=snap/&gt; Myanmar was thereby agreeing to increase transparency in its extractive industries, notably the logging industry.&lt;ref name=extract/&gt;

The Money Laundering Eradication Law (2015) provides for the recovery of funds tied to illicit or criminal activities. The Anti-Money Laundering Rules, the establishment of a special police unit for financial crimes, and the passage of Rules Combating the Financing of Terrorism also aid the struggle against corruption. The Financial Institutions of Myanmar Law and the Foreign Exchange Management Law both criminalize fraud and other crimes committed in financial institutions. Myanmar’s Competition Law allows for the prosecution of anti-competitive business activities. Prosecution under these laws, however, is relatively rare, owing largely to a lack of governmental resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Myanmar Anti-Corruption Compliance| work =Global Investigations Review| url =http://globalinvestigationsreview.com/insight/chapter/60/myanmar-anti-corruption-compliance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, [[Aung San Suu Kyi]], the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner and opposition leader, said in a speech that she had looked to [[Singapore]] for advice on combatting corruption in her own country, due to Singapore's incredibly [[Corruption in Singapore|low levels]] of corruption.&lt;ref name=wsj/&gt;

In Myanmar, [[Coca-Cola]] adopted a policy of zero-tolerance for corruption at its facilities and trucking routes.

"'''Cuckservative'''" is a [[pejorative]]&lt;ref name="washingtonpost-07-29-2015"&gt;{{cite news |last=Weigel |first=David |date=July 29, 2015 |title='Cuckservative' — the conservative insult of the month, explained |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/07/29/cuckservative-the-conservative-insult-of-the-month-explained/ |newspaper=Washington Post |access-date=August 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; formed as a [[portmanteau]] of "cuck", a shortened form of the word ''[[cuckold]]'', and the political designation ''[[conservatism|conservative]]''.&lt;ref name="salon-08-13-2015"&gt;{{cite news |last=Rozsa |first=Matthew |date=August 13, 2015 |title=Conservatives' crippling masculinity crisis: Cuckservatives, men's rights activism and the privilege the right refuses to acknowledge |url=http://www.salon.com/2015/08/13/conservatives_crippling_masculinity_crisis_cuckservatives_mens_rights_activism_and_the_privilege_the_right_refuses_to_acknowledge_partner/ |newspaper=Salon |access-date=August 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has become an increasingly popular pejorative label in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="splcenter-08-07-2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="thelibertarianrepublic-08-04-2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="adl-08-11-2015"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-pol-alt-right-terminology-20161115-story.html |title='Cuck,' 'snowflake,' 'masculinist': A guide to the language of the 'alt-right' |last=Roy |first=Jessica |website=Los Angeles Times |publication-date=November 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "cuckservative" reached a high level of mainstream political conversation around mid-July 2015, where it gained media attention just a few weeks before the start of the first [[Republican Party presidential debates and forums, 2016|Republican primary debate]] for the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 United States presidential election]].&lt;ref name="thelibertarianrepublic-08-04-2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="buzzfeed-07-28-2015"/&gt; 

The term, as well as the shortened form "cuck" for cuckold, originated on websites such as [[4chan]] (specifically the [[/pol/|/pol/ imageboard]]) and [[8chan]], the [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] message board ''My Posting Career'',&lt;ref name="washingtonpost-07-29-2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="splcenter-08-07-2015"/&gt; the blog ''[[The Right Stuff (blog)|The Right Stuff]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/combating-hate/domestic-extremism-terrorism/c/alt-right-a-primer-about-the.html|title=Alt Right: A Primer about the New White Supremacy|date=February 10, 2016|publisher=Anti-Defamation League}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other sites in the alt-right movement.&lt;ref name="splcenter-08-07-2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="alt-right"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gray|first=Rosie|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/rosiegray/how-2015-fueled-the-rise-of-the-freewheeling-white-nationali|title=How 2015 Fueled The Rise Of The Freewheeling, White Nationalist Alt Right Movement|work=Buzzfeed News|date=December 27, 2015|accessdate=February 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="weeklystandard1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Welton|first=Benjamin|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/what-exactly-is-the-alternative-right/article/2000310 |title=What, Exactly, is the 'Alternative Right?' |work=The Weekly Standard |date=February 1, 2016 |accessdate=February 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition and origin==
One definition of "cuckservative" is a conservative who sells out,&lt;ref name="hotair-07-26-2015"&gt;{{cite news |last=Millard |first=Taylor |date=July 26, 2015 |title=Don't believe the #cuckservative lie |url=http://hotair.com/archives/2015/07/26/dont-believe-the-cuckservative-lie/ |newspaper=Hot Air |access-date=August 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; having bought into all of the key premises of the [[left-wing politics|left]],&lt;ref name="redstate-07-29-2015"/&gt; and sympathizes with [[Liberalism|liberal]] values.&lt;ref name="buzzfeed-07-28-2015"&gt;{{cite news |last=Bernstein |first=Joseph |date=July 28, 2015 |title=Behind The Racist Hashtag That Is Blowing Up Twitter |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/josephbernstein/behind-the-racist-hashtag-some-donald-trump-fans-love |newspaper=BuzzFeed |access-date=August 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[White supremacy|white supremacist]]&lt;ref name=spencer_supremacist/&gt; [[Richard B. Spencer]], the term is a shorthand used to express "a certain kind of contempt for mainstream conservatives".&lt;ref name="nytimes-08-13-2015"/&gt; The phrase is similar to "[[Republican In Name Only]]" (RINO).&lt;ref name="theguardian-08-13-2015"&gt;{{cite news |last=Yuhas |first=Alan |date=August 13, 2015 |title='Cuckservative': the internet's latest Republican insult hits where it hurts |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/13/cuckservative-republicans-conservatives-jeb-bush |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=August 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social conservatism|Social conservatives]] who use the term condemn what they see as [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] running on socially conservative values to appeal to their [[Base (politics)|base]] during an election cycle, only to use [[vote trading]] to compromise on those values while in office.&lt;ref name="nytimes-08-13-2015"&gt;{{cite news |last=Rappeport |first=Alan |date=August 13, 2015 |title=From the Right, a New Slur for G.O.P.

The term ''cuckold'' has a long history as an insult implying that a specific man is weak and emasculated, and may even feel pleasure at his own humiliation. The shortened form "cuck" arose in this manner as an Internet insult, and it also refers to a [[Cuckold#Cuckoldry as a fetish|genre]] of [[Ethnic pornography#Interracial pornography|interracial pornography]] in which a white married woman spurns her white husband for sex with a black man. The white husband is thus cuckolded or "cucked".&lt;ref name="washingtonpost-07-29-2015" /&gt;

Some American political writers have suggested that the terms "cuck" and "cuckservative" are racially charged due to their interracial pornography roots, instead of simply being a sexual insult like the original "cuckold".&lt;ref name="newrepublic-07-26-2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The GOP crack-up continues"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walsh|first1=Joan|title=The GOP crack-up continues|url=http://www.salon.com/2015/08/03/the_gop_crack_up_continues_the_raging_civil_war_over_the_disgusting_%E2%80%9Ccuckservative%E2%80%9D_slur/|website=Salon|accessdate=November 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Behind The Racist Hashtag That Is Blowing Up Twitter"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bernstein|first1=Joseph|title=Behind The Racist Hashtag That Is Blowing Up Twitter|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/josephbernstein/behind-the-racist-hashtag-some-donald-trump-fans-love#.tfxNevKpWb|website=[[Buzzfeed]]|accessdate=November 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="What’s Behind The ‘Cuckservative’ Slur?

Those in the self-described conservative media targeted by the "cuckservative" slur, as well as journalists and commentators from other media outlets, have decried the term as an [[Anti-Christian sentiment|anti-Christian]],&lt;ref name="thelibertarianrepublic-08-04-2015"&gt;{{cite news |last=Petersen |first=Austin |date=August 4, 2015 |title=Is "Cuckservative" the New, Hip Racial Slur For White Nationalists? |url=http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/is-cuckservative-the-new-hip-racial-slur-for-white-nationalists/ |newspaper=The Libertarian Republic |access-date=August 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[racist slur]]&lt;ref name="redstate-07-29-2015"&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Erick Erickson]] |date=July 29, 2015 |title="Cuckservative" is a Racist Slur and an Attack on Evangelical Christians |url=http://www.redstate.com/2015/07/29/cuckservative-is-a-racist-slur-and-an-attack-on-evangelical-christians/ |newspaper=Red State |access-date=August 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mediaite-07-29-2015"&gt;{{cite news |last=Christopher |first=Tommy |date=July 29, 2015 |title=Trump Fans Target 'Mike Cuckabee' for Being a 'Cuckservative' |url=http://www.mediaite.com/online/trump-fans-target-mike-cuckabee-for-being-a-cuckservative/ |newspaper=Mediaite |access-date=August 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a rallying cry for white supremacists and [[Dark Enlightenment|neoreactionaries]].&lt;ref name="thedailybeast-07-28-2015"&gt;{{cite news |last=Lewis |first=Matt |date=July 28, 2015 |title=Twitter's Right-Wing Civil War |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/07/28/twitter-s-right-wing-civil-war.html |newspaper=The Daily Beast |access-date=August 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some observers, such as the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]], say that the term's usage has been rising among white supremacists in the United States.&lt;ref name="splcenter-08-07-2015" /&gt;

A conservative news site in Spain translated "cuckservative" to "cornuservador", stating that: "Republicans are nothing but the 'controlled opposition' completely in the hands of the political left, whose only aspiration is for those rare occasions when those hands pat them on the head, and the media rewards them with the coveted adjective 'moderate': these are the cornuservadores."&lt;ref name="gaceta-08-08-2015"&gt;{{cite news |last=Esteban |first=Carlos |date=August 8, 2015 |title='Cornuservador': el término que saca de quicio al Partido Republicano |url=http://www.gaceta.es/noticias/cornuservador-termino-saca-quicio-partido-republicano-08082015-1229/ |trans-title='Cuckservative': the term that annoys the Republican Party |language=Spanish |newspaper=Gaceta |access-date=August 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

White supremacists have used the term to condemn white politicians who they say unknowingly promote "the interests of Jews and non-whites."&lt;ref name="adl-08-11-2015"&gt;{{cite news |last=Greenblatt |first=Jonathan |date=August 11, 2015 |title=White Supremacists Relish "Cuckservative" Controversy |url=http://blog.adl.org/extremism/white-supremacists-relish-cuckservative-controversy |newspaper=ADL |access-date=August 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Anti-Defamation League]] says that the term is used by white supremacists as a synonym of the pre-existing phrase "[[race traitor]]s".&lt;ref name="adl-08-11-2015"/&gt;

==Use==
Jeet Heer of ''[[The New Republic]]'' wrote that the word is a "fine example of how the sound of a word can reinforce its meaning: abrasive on the ears, ''cuckservative'' appropriately enough has an ugly origin and meaning".&lt;ref name="newrepublic-07-26-2015"/&gt; The word was most popularly adopted in mid-2015 after some alt-right web users were disapproving of the attempts by [[John McCain]], [[Jeb Bush]], and other Republicans to establish more politically liberal positions, dubbing those who did "cuckservatives". Over a matter of weeks, the term then proceeded to attain usage additionally on [[social media]] and the wider internet.&lt;ref name="newrepublic-07-26-2015"/&gt;

Writing for [[Hot Air]], Taylor Millard criticized the word and its history of usage by white supremacists within the conservative movement. He called it short-sighted, giving his opinion that [[Rand Paul]]'s popularity at leading majority-black universities could make African Americans more conservative in the future.&lt;ref name="hotair-07-26-2015"/&gt; Matt Lewis, in ''[[The Daily Beast]]'', gave his opinion that the word could become as popular with Republicans as "RINO" (Republican In Name Only), even if they were oblivious to its often [[racial]] connotations.&lt;ref name="thedailybeast-07-28-2015"/&gt; [[Erick Erickson]], founder of right-wing website [[RedState.com]], called the word an insult to Christian Republicans by white supremacists.&lt;ref name="thedailybeast-07-28-2015"/&gt; Writing in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', [[David Weigel]] described the term as arising from disaffected elements of the right wing.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost-07-29-2015"/&gt;

The '''cultural assimilation of Native Americans''' was an [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] effort by the United States to transform [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American culture]] to European–American culture between the years of 1790 and 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Hoxie, (1984).

&lt;/ref&gt; They formulated a policy to encourage the civilizing process.&lt;ref name="remini_reform_begins"/&gt; With increased waves of immigration from Europe, there was growing public support for education to encourage a standard set of cultural values and practices to be held in common by the majority of citizens. Education was viewed as the primary method in the acculturation process for minorities.

[[Americanization]] policies were based on the idea that when indigenous people learned United States (American) customs and values, they would be able to merge tribal traditions with American culture and peacefully join the majority of the society.  After the end of the [[Indian Wars]], in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the government outlawed the practice of traditional religious ceremonies.  It established [[Native American boarding schools]] which children were required to attend. In these schools they were forced to speak English, study standard subjects, attend church, and leave tribal traditions behind.

The [[Dawes Act|Dawes Act of 1887]], which allotted tribal lands in severalty to individuals, was seen as a way to create individual homesteads for Native Americans.  Land allotments were made in exchange for Native Americans becoming US citizens and giving up some forms of tribal self-government and institutions.  It resulted in the transfer of an estimated total of {{convert|93|e6acre|km2}} from Native American control.  Most was sold to individuals or given out free through the Homestead law, or given directly to Indians as individuals.  The [[Indian Citizenship Act of 1924]] was also part of Americanization policy; it gave full citizenship to all Indians living on reservations.  The leading opponent of forced assimilation was [[John Collier (sociologist)|John Collier]], who directed the federal Office of Indian Affairs from 1933 to 1945, and tried to reverse many of the established policies.

==Europeans and Native Americans in North America, 1601–1776==

[[File:Map of territorial growth 1775.svg|thumb|right|Eastern North America; the 1763 "Proclamation line" is the border between the red and the pink areas.]]
[[Epidemiological]] and [[archeological]] work has established the effects of increased immigration of children accompanying families to North America from 1634–1640.  They came from areas where smallpox was endemic in the Netherlands, England and France, and passed on the disease to indigenous people.  Tribes such as the [[Wyandot people|Huron]]/[[Wyandot people|Wendat]] and others in the Northeast particularly suffered epidemics after 1634.&lt;ref name="Warrick"&gt;Gary Warrick, "European Infectious Disease and Depopulation of the Wendat-Tionontate (Huron-Petun)", ''World Archaeology'' 35 (October 2003), 258–275.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period European powers fought to acquire cultural and economic control of North America, just as they were doing in Europe. At the same time, indigenous peoples competed for dominance in the European fur trade and hunting areas.  The French, English and Spanish powers sought to engage Native American tribes as auxiliary forces in their North American armies, otherwise composed mostly of colonial militia in the early battles.  In many cases indigenous warriors formed the great majority of fighting forces, which deepened some of their rivalries.  To secure the help of the tribes, the Europeans offered goods and signed treaties. The treaties usually promised that the European power would honor the tribe's traditional lands and independence.  In addition, the indigenous peoples formed alliances for their own reasons, wanting to keep allies in the fur and [[gun]] trades, positioning European allies against their traditional enemies among other tribes, etc.  Many Native American tribes took part in [[King William's War]] (1689–1697), [[Queen Anne's War]] (1702–1713) ([[War of the Spanish Succession]]), [[Dummer's War]] (c. 1721–1725), and the [[French and Indian War]] (1754–1763) ([[Seven Years' War]]).

As the dominant power after the Seven Years' War, Great Britain instituted the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]], to try to protect indigenous peoples' territory from colonial encroachment of peoples from east of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. The document defined a boundary to separate Native American country from that of the European community.  In part, this justified the English taking complete control of lands on the European side, but the proclamation did not effectively prevent individual ethnic European colonists from continuing to migrate westward.  The British did not have sufficient forces to patrol the border and keep out colonists.  Europeans and European governments continued to use military/diplomatic and economic force to secure control of more territories from Native Americans. For further information see [[European colonization of the Americas]].

From the Native American perspective, European control of an area generally means a dramatic change in their way of life, with free movement across hunting grounds curtailed or objected to, for instance, by Europeans who had different conceptions of property and the uses of land.

The struggle for empire in [[North America]] caused the [[United States]] in its earliest years to adopt an Indian policy similar to the one devised by [[Great Britain]] in colonial times.&lt;ref name="fritz"&gt;Fritz, Henry E. (1963).  ''The Movement for Indian in 1860–1890''.  University of Pennsylvania Press.&lt;/ref&gt; They realized that good relations with bordering tribes were important for political and trading reasons, but as had the British, they reserved the right to abandon these good relations to absorb the lands of their enemies and allies alike as the agricultural frontier moved west. The United States continued the use of Native Americans as allies, including during the [[American Revolutionary War]] and the [[War of 1812]]. As relations with England and Spain normalized during the early 19th century, the need for such friendly relations ended. It was no longer necessary to "woo" the tribes to prevent the other powers from using them against the United States.  Now, instead of a buffer against other "civilized" foes, the tribes often became viewed as an obstacle in the expansion of the United States.

George Washington formulated a policy to encourage the "civilizing" process.&lt;ref name="remini_reform_begins" /&gt; He had a six-point plan for civilization which included:

# impartial justice toward Native Americans
# regulated buying of Native American lands
# promotion of commerce
# promotion of experiments to civilize or improve Native American society
# presidential authority to give presents
# punishing those who violated Native American rights.&lt;ref name=eric_miller&gt;

===Indian removal===
The [[Indian Removal Act]] of 1830 characterized the US government policy of [[Indian removal]], which called for relocation of Native American tribes living east of the Mississippi River to lands west of the river. While it did not authorize the forced removal of the indigenous tribes, it authorized the President to negotiate land exchange treaties with tribes located in lands of the United States. The Intercourse Law of 1834 prohibited United States citizens from entering tribal lands granted by such treaties without permission, though it was often ignored.

On September 27, 1830, the [[Choctaws]] signed [[Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek]] and the first Native American tribe was to be voluntarily removed. The agreement represented one of the largest transfers of land that was signed between the U.S. Government and Native Americans without being instigated by warfare. By the treaty, the Choctaws signed away their remaining traditional homelands, opening them up for American settlement in Mississippi Territory.

While the Indian Removal Act made the relocation of the tribes voluntary, it was often abused by government officials.  The best-known example is the [[Treaty of New Echota]].  It was negotiated and signed by a small fraction of [[Cherokee]] tribal members, not the tribal leadership, on December 29, 1835. While tribal leaders objected to Washington, DC and the treaty was revised in 1836, the state of Georgia proceeded to act against the Cherokee tribe. The tribe was forced to relocate in 1838.&lt;ref&gt;Hoxie, Frederick (1984). ''A Final Promise: The Campaign to Assimilate the Indians, 1880–1920''. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press.&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 4,000 Cherokees died in the march, now known as the [[Trail of Tears]].

In the decades that followed, white settlers encroached even into the western lands set aside for Native Americans. American settlers eventually made homesteads from coast to coast, just as the Native Americans had before them. No tribe was untouched by the influence of white traders, farmers, and soldiers.

===Office of Indian Affairs===
The Office of Indian Affairs ([[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] as of 1947) was established on March 11, 1824, as an office of the [[United States Department of War]], an indication of the state of relations with the Indians. It became responsible for negotiating treaties and enforcing conditions, at least for Native Americans. In 1849 the bureau was transferred to the [[Department of the Interior]] as so many of its responsibilities were related to the holding and disposition of large land assets.

In 1854 Commissioner [[George W. Manypenny]] called for a new code of regulations. He noted that there was no place in the West where the Indians could be placed with a reasonable hope that they might escape conflict with white settlers. He also called for the Intercourse Law of 1834 to be revised, as its provisions had been aimed at individual intruders on Indian territory rather than at organized expeditions.

In 1858 the succeeding Commissioner, [[Charles Mix]], noted that the repeated removal of tribes had prevented them from acquiring a taste for European way of life. In 1862 Secretary of the Interior [[Caleb B. Smith]] questioned the wisdom of treating tribes as quasi-independent nations.&lt;ref name="fritz" /&gt; Given the difficulties of the government in what it considered good efforts to support separate status for Native Americans, appointees and officials began to consider a policy of Americanization instead.

==Americanization and assimilation (1857–1920)==
{{see also|Federal Indian Policy#Allotment and assimilation era (1887–1943)}}
[[File:Portrait of Marsdin, Non-Native Man, and Group of Students SEP 1893.jpg|325px|thumb|left|Portrait of Marsdin, Non-Native Man, and Group of Students from the Alaska region.]]

The movement to reform Indian administration and assimilate Indians as citizens originated in the pleas of people who lived in close association with the natives and were shocked by the fraudulent and indifferent management of their affairs. They called themselves "Friends of the Indian" and lobbied officials on their behalf.  Gradually the call for change was taken up by Eastern reformers.&lt;ref name="fritz" /&gt;  Typically the reformers were Protestants from well organized denominations who considered assimilation necessary to the Christianizing of the Indians; Catholics were also involved.  The 19th century was a time of major efforts in evangelizing missionary expeditions to all non-Christian people.  In 1865 the government began to make contracts with various missionary societies to operate Indian schools for teaching citizenship, English, and agricultural and mechanical arts.&lt;ref&gt;Robert H. Keller, ''American Protestantism and United States Indian Policy, 1869-82'' (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grant's "Peace Policy"===
{{Main|Presidency of Ulysses S. Grant#"Peace Policy" for Indians}}

In his State of the Union Address on December 4, 1871, [[Ulysses Grant]] stated that "the policy pursued toward the Indians has resulted favorably ... many tribes of Indians have been induced to settle upon reservations, to cultivate the soil, to perform productive labor of various kinds, and to partially accept civilization. They are being cared for in such a way, it is hoped, as to induce those still pursuing their old habits of life to embrace the only opportunity which is left them to avoid extermination."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.infoplease.com/t/hist/state-of-the-union/83.html&lt;/ref&gt; The emphasis became using civilian workers (not soldiers) to deal with reservation life, especially Protestant and Catholic organizations. The Quakers had promoted the peace policy in the expectation that applying Christian principles to Indian affairs would eliminate corruption and speed assimilation. Most Indians joined churches but there were unexpected problems, such as rivalry between Protestants and Catholics for control of specific reservations in order to maximize the number of souls converted.&lt;ref&gt;Cary C. Collins, "A Fall From Grace: Sectarianism and the Grant Peace Policy in Western Washington Territory, 1869–1882", ''Pacific Northwest Forum'' (1995) 8#2 pp 55–77&lt;/ref&gt;

The Quakers were motivated by high ideals, played down the role of conversion, and worked well with the Indians. They had been highly organized and motivated by the anti-slavery crusade, and after the Civil War expanded their energies to include both ex-slaves and the western tribes. They had Grant's ear and became the principal instruments for his peace policy. During 1869–1885, they served as appointed agents on numerous reservations and superintendencies in a mission centered on moral uplift and manual training. Their ultimate goal of acculturating the Indians to American culture was not reached because of frontier land hunger and Congressional patronage politics.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph E. Illick, "'Some Of Our Best Friends Are Indians...': Quaker Attitudes and Actions Regarding the Western Indians during the Grant Administration", ''Western Historical Quarterly'' (1971) 2#3 pp. 283–294 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/967835 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other denominations volunteered to help. In 1871, John H. Stout, sponsored by the Dutch Reformed Church, was sent to the [[Gila River Indian Community|Pima reservation]] in Arizona to implement the policy. However Congress, the church, and private charities spent less money than was needed; the local whites strongly disliked the Indians; the Pima balked at removal; and Stout was frustrated at every turn.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Trennert, "John H. Stout and the Grant Peace Policy among the Pimas", ''Arizona &amp; the West'' (1986) 28#1 pp. 45–68&lt;/ref&gt;

In Arizona and New Mexico, the Navajo were resettled on reservations and grew rapidly in numbers. The Peace Policy began in 1870 when the Presbyterians took over the reservations. They were frustrated because they did not understand the Navajo.  However, the Navajo not only gave up raiding but soon became successful at sheep ranching.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Bender, ''New Hope for the Indians: The Grant Peace Policy and the Navajos in the 1870s'' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

The peace policy did not fully apply to the Indian tribes that had supported the Confederacy. They lost much of their land as the United States began to confiscate the western portions of the Indian Territory and began to resettle the Indians there on smaller reservations.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.archives.gov/legislative/features/oklahoma/&lt;/ref&gt;

Reaction to the massacre of Lt. Col. George Custer's unit at the [[Battle of the Little Big Horn]] in 1876 was shock and dismay at the failure of the Peace Policy. The Indian appropriations measure of August 1876 marked the end of Grant's Peace Policy. The Sioux were given the choice of either selling their lands in the Black Hills for cash or not receiving government gifts of food and other supplies.&lt;ref&gt;Brian W. Dippie, {{"'}}What Will Congress Do About It?' The Congressional Reaction to the Little Big Horn Disaster", ''North Dakota History'' (1970) 37#3 pp. 161–189&lt;/ref&gt;

===Code of Indian Offenses===

In 1882, Interior Secretary [[Henry M. Teller]] called attention to the "great hindrance" of Indian customs to the progress of assimilation.  The resultant "Code of Indian Offenses" in 1883 outlined the procedure for suppressing "evil practice."

A Court of Indian Offenses, consisting of three Indians appointed by the Indian Agent, was to be established at each Indian agency.  The Court would serve as judges to punish offenders.  Outlawed behavior included participation in traditional dances and feasts, polygamy, reciprocal gift giving and funeral practices, and intoxication or sale of liquor.  Also prohibited were "medicine men" who "use any of the arts of the conjurer to prevent the Indians from abandoning their heathenish rites and customs."  The penalties prescribed for violations ranged from 10 to 90 days imprisonment and loss of government-provided rations for up to 30 days.&lt;ref&gt;http://rcliton.files.wordpress.com/2007/11/code-of-indian-offenses.pdf, accessed 27 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Five Civilized Tribes]] were exempt from the Code which remained in effect until 1933.&lt;ref&gt;http://tribal-law.blogspot.com/2008/02/code-of-indian-offenses.html, accessed 27 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In implementation on reservations by Indian judges, the Court of Indian Offenses became mostly an institution to punish minor crimes.  The 1890 report of the Secretary of the Interior lists the activities of the Court on several reservations and apparently no Indian was prosecuted for dances or "heathenish ceremonies."&lt;ref&gt;''Report of the Secretary of the Interior'', Volume II. Washington: GPO, 189, pp. lxxxiii-lxxxix.&lt;/ref&gt;    Significantly, 1890 was the year of the [[Ghost Dance]], ending with the [[Wounded Knee Massacre]].

=== The role of the Supreme Court in assimilation ===
In 1857, Chief Justice [[Roger B. Taney]] expressed that since Native Americans were "free and independent people" that they could become U.S. citizens.&lt;ref name=chiefJustic_taney&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Taney asserted that Native Americans could be naturalized and join the "political community" of the United States.&lt;ref name=chiefJustic_taney /&gt;

{{quote|[Native Americans], without doubt, like the subjects of any other foreign Government, be naturalized by the authority of Congress, and become citizens of a State, and of the United States; and if an individual should leave his nation or tribe, and take up his abode among the white population, he would be entitled to all the rights and privileges which would belong to an emigrant from any other foreign people.|Chief Justice Roger B. Taney, 1857, ''What was Taney thinking? American Indian Citizenship in the era of Dred Scott'', Frederick E. Hoxie, April 2007.&lt;ref name=chiefJustic_taney /&gt;}}

The political ideas during the time of assimilation policy are known by many Indians as the [[progressive era]], but more commonly known as the assimilation era.(1890–1928&lt;ref&gt;Hoxie, Frederick E. Talking Back to Civilization: Indian Voices from the Progressive Era. New York: St. Martin's. 2001. (178) Print.&lt;/ref&gt;).  The progressive era was characterized by a resolve to emphasize the importance of dignity and independence in the modern industrialized world.&lt;ref name="SCOTUS"&gt;Tomlins, Christopher L. The United States Supreme Court: the pursuit of justice. Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin Co. 2005. (175–176) Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  This idea is applied to Native Americans in a quote from Indian Affairs Commissioner John Oberly: "[The Native American] must be imbued with the exalting egotism of American civilization so that he will say ‘I’ instead of ‘We’, and ‘This is mine’ instead of ‘This is ours’."&lt;ref name="Mask"&gt;Wilkins, David E. American Indian Sovereignty and the U.S. Supreme Court: The Masking of Justice. University of Texas Press, 1997. (78–81) Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Progressives also had a faith in the knowledge of experts.&lt;ref name="SCOTUS"/&gt;   This was a dangerous idea to have when an emerging science was concerned with ranking [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]] based on moral capabilities and intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;Tomlins, Christopher L. The United States Supreme Court: the pursuit of justice. Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin Co. 2005. (191) Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, the idea of an inferior Indian race made it into the courts.  The progressive era thinkers also wanted to look beyond legal definitions of equality to create a realistic concept of fairness.  Such a concept was thought to include a reasonable income, decent working conditions, as well as health and leisure for every American.&lt;ref name="SCOTUS"/&gt;  These ideas can be seen in the decisions of the Supreme Court during the assimilation era.

Through cases such as [[Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock]], [[Talton v. Mayes]], [[Winters vs. United States]], [[United States v. Winans]], [[United States v. Nice]], and [[United States v. Sandoval]] the court set many precedents and provided building blocks for much of the new legislation concerning Native Americans. One of the basic decisions that had to be made in most of these cases was how to classify the Indian nations and what rights they were to have. Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock provides an excellent example of the implementation of the paternal view of Native Americans as it refers back to the idea of Indians as "wards of the nation."&lt;ref&gt;http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=187&amp;invol=553&lt;/ref&gt; Some other issues that came into play were the hunting and fishing rights of the natives, especially when land beyond theirs affected their own practices, whether or not Constitutional rights necessarily applied to Indians, and whether tribal governments had the power to establish their own laws. As new legislation tried to force the American Indians into becoming just Americans, the Supreme Court provided these critical decisions.  Native American nations were labeled "domestic dependent nations" by Marshall in [[Cherokee Nation v. Georgia]], one of the first landmark cases involving Indians.&lt;ref&gt;Duthu, Bruce. American Indians and the Law. New York: Penguin Books, 2008. (XXV) Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Some decisions focused more on the dependency of the tribes, while others preserved tribal sovereignty, while still others sometimes managed to do both.

== Decisions focusing on dependence ==

===''United States v. Kagama''===
The United States Supreme Court case ''[[United States v. Kagama]]'' (1886) set the stage for the court to make even more powerful decisions based on plenary power.  To summarize congressional plenary power, the court stated:

{{quote|The power of the general government over these remnants of a race once powerful, now weak and diminished in numbers, is necessary to their protection, as well as to the safety of those among whom they dwell. It must exist in that government, because it never has existed anywhere else; because the theater of its exercise is within the geographical limits of the United [118 U.S. 375, 385] States; because it has never been denied; and because it alone can enforce its laws on all the tribes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=118&amp;invol=375 "United States v. Kagama, 118 U.S. 375 (1886)"]. Findlaw. Retrieved on 2009-10-19.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The decision in ''United States v. Kagama'' led to the new idea that "protection" of Native Americans could justify intrusion into intratribal affairs. The Supreme Court and Congress were given unlimited authority with which to force assimilation and acculturation of Native Americans into American society.&lt;ref name="Mask"/&gt;

===''United States v. Nice''===
During the years leading up to passage of the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighteenth Amendment]] and the [[Volstead Act]], ''United States v. Nice'' (1916), was a result of the idea of barring American Indians from the sale of [[liquor]]. The United States Supreme Court case overruled a decision made eleven years before, ''Matter of Heff'', {{ussc|197|48|1905}}, which allowed American Indian U.S. citizens to drink liquor.&lt;ref name="UG"/&gt; The quick reversal shows how law concerning American Indians often shifted with the changing governmental and popular views of American Indian tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Canby Jr., William. ''American Indian Law In a Nut Shell,'' 4th edition. West Group, 2004. (1) Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The US Congress continued to prohibit the sale of liquor to American Indians. While many tribal governments had long prohibited the sale of alcohol on their reservations, the ruling implied that American Indian nations could not be entirely independent, and needed a guardian for protection.

===''United States v. Sandoval''===
Like ''United States v. Nice,'' the United States Supreme Court case of ''[[United States v. Sandoval]]'' (1913) rose from efforts to bar American Indians from the sale of liquor.  As American Indians were granted citizenship, there was an effort to retain the ability to protect them as a group which was distinct from regular citizens.  The Sandoval Act reversed the ''U.S. v. Joseph'' decision of 1876, which claimed that the Pueblo were not considered federal Indians. The 1913 ruling claimed that the Pueblo were "not beyond the range of congressional power under the Constitution".&lt;ref&gt;''Red Man's Land White Man's Land'' 2nd edition, Wilcomb B. Washburn, 1995,
p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; This case resulted in Congress continuing to prohibit the sale of liquor to American Indians. The ruling continued to suggest that American Indians needed protection.

== Decisions focusing on sovereignty ==

There were several United States Supreme Court cases during the assimilation era that focused on the [[sovereignty]] of American Indian nations.  These cases were extremely important in setting precedents for later cases and for legislation dealing with the sovereignty of American Indian nations.

===''Ex parte Crow Dog'' (1883)===
''[[Ex parte Crow Dog]]'' was a US Supreme Court appeal by an Indian who had been found guilty of murder and sentenced to death.  The defendant was an American Indian who had been found guilty of the murder of another American Indian.  [[Crow Dog]] argued that the district court did not have the jurisdiction to try him for a crime committed between two American Indians that happened on an American Indian reservation.  The court found that although the reservation was located within the territory covered by the district court's jurisdiction, Rev. Stat. § 2146 precluded the inmate's indictment in the district court. Section 2146 stated that Rev. Stat. § 2145, which made the criminal laws of the United States applicable to Indian country, did not apply to crimes committed by one Indian against another, or to crimes for which an Indian was already punished by the law of his tribe.  The Court issued the writs of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' and ''certiorari'' to the Indian.&lt;ref&gt;''Ex parte Crow Dog'', {{ussc|109|556|1883}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Talton v. Mayes'' (1896)===
The United States Supreme Court case of ''[[Talton v. Mayes]]'' was a decision respecting the authority of tribal governments. This case decided that the individual rights protections, specifically the Fifth Amendment, which limit federal, and later, state governments, do not apply to tribal government. It reaffirmed earlier decisions, such as the 1831 ''[[Cherokee Nation v. Georgia]]'' case, that gave Indian tribes the status of "domestic dependent nations", the sovereignty of which is independent of the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://supreme.justia.com/us/163/376/case.html "Full text opinion from Justia.com"]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Talton v. Mayes'' is also a case dealing with Native American dependence, as it deliberated over and upheld the concept of congressional plenary authority. This part of the decision led to some important pieces of legislation concerning Native Americans, the most important of which is the [[Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968]].

===''Good Shot v. United States'' (1900)===
This United States Supreme Court case occurred when an American Indian shot and killed a non-Indian. The question arose of whether or not the United States Supreme Court had jurisdiction over this issue. In an effort to argue against the Supreme Court having jurisdiction over the proceedings, the defendant filed a petition seeking a writ of [[certiorari]]. This request for judicial review, upon writ of error, was denied. The court held that a conviction for murder, punishable with death, was no less a conviction for a capital crime by reason even taking into account the fact that the jury qualified the punishment. The American Indian defendant was sentenced to life in prison.&lt;ref&gt;"Good Shot v. United States''. LexisNexis. 15 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Montoya v. United States'' (1901)===
This United States Supreme court case came about when the surviving partner of the firm of E. Montoya &amp; Sons petitioned against the United States and the Mescalero Apache Indians for the value their livestock which was taken in March 1880. It was believed that the livestock was taken by "Victorio's Band"  which was a group of these American Indians.  It was argued that the group of American Indians who had taken the livestock were distinct from any other American Indian tribal group, and therefore the Mescalero Apache American Indian tribe should not be held responsible for what had occurred. After the hearing, the Supreme Court held that the judgment made previously in the Court of Claims would not be changed. This is to say that the Mescalero Apache American Indian tribe would not be held accountable for the actions of Victorio's Band. This outcome demonstrates not only the sovereignty of American Indian tribes from the United States, but also their sovereignty from one another.  One group of American Indians cannot be held accountable for the actions of another group of American Indians, even though they are all part of the American Indian nation.&lt;ref&gt;"Montoya v. United States". LexisNexis. 15 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''US v. Winans'' (1905)===
In this case, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Yakama tribe, reaffirming their prerogative to fish and hunt on off-reservation land. Further, the case established two important principles regarding the interpretation of treaties. First, treaties would be interpreted in the way Indians would have understood them and "as justice and reason demand".&lt;ref&gt;''Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Association'', 443 U.S. 658, 668&lt;/ref&gt; Second, the Reserved Rights Doctrine was established which states that treaties are not rights granted to the Indians, but rather "a reservation by the Indians of rights already possessed and not granted away by them".&lt;ref&gt;Shultz, Jeffrey D. (2000). ''Encyclopedia of Minorities in American Politics'', p. 710. Greenwood Publishing Group. {{ISBN|1-57356-149-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; These "reserved" rights, meaning never having been transferred to the United States or any other sovereign, include property rights, which include the rights to fish, hunt and gather, and political rights. Political rights reserved to the Indian nations include the power to regulate domestic relations, tax, administer justice, or exercise civil and criminal jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkins, David E. and Lomawaima, K. Tsianina (2002). ''Uneven Ground: American Indian Sovereignty and Federal Law'', p. 125. University of Oklahoma Press. {{ISBN|978-0-8061-3395-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Winters v. United States'' (1908)===

The United States Supreme Court Case ''[[Winters v. United States]]'' was a case primarily dealing with water rights of [[Indian reservation|American Indian reservations]].  This case clarified what water sources American Indian tribes had "implied" rights to put to use.&lt;ref&gt;Duthu, N. (2008). "American Indians and the Law", p. 105. Penguin Group Inc., New York. {{ISBN|978-0-670-01857-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This case dealt with the [[Fort Belknap Indian Reservation]] and their right to utilize the water source of the [[Milk River (Alberta-Montana)|Milk River]] in Montana. The reservation had been created without clearly stating the explicit water rights that the Fort Belknap American Indian reservation had.  This became a problem once non-Indian settlers began moving into the area and using the Milk River as a water source for their settlements.&lt;ref&gt;Shurts, John (2000). "Indian Reserved Water Rights", p. 15. University of Oklahoma Press. {{ISBN|0806132108}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As water sources are extremely sparse and limited in Montana, this argument of who had the legal rights to use the water was presented. After the case was tried, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] came to the decision that the Fort Belknap reservation had reserved water rights through the 1888 agreement which had created the American Indian Reservation in the first place. This case was very important in setting a precedent for cases after the assimilation era. It was used as a precedent for the cases ''Arizona v. California'', ''[[Tulee v. Washington]]'', ''Washington v. McCoy'', ''Nevada v. United States'', ''Cappaert v. United States'', ''Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States'', ''United States v. New Mexico'', and ''Arizona v. San Carlos Apache Tribe of Arizona'' which all focused on the sovereignty of American Indian tribes.

===''Choate v. Trapp'' (1912)===
As more Native Americans received allotments through the [[Dawes Act]], there was a great deal of public and state pressure to tax allottees. However, in the United States Supreme court case ''[[Choate v. Trapp]]'', {{ussc|224|665|1912}}, the court ruled for Indian allottees to be exempt from state taxation.&lt;ref name="UG"&gt;Wilkins, David, and K. Tsianina Lomawaima.

===''Clairmont v. United States'' (1912)===
This United States Supreme Court case resulted when a defendant appealed the decision on his case. The defendant filed a writ of error to obtain review of his conviction after being convicted of unlawfully introducing intoxicating liquor into an American Indian reservation. This act was found a violation of the Act of Congress of January 30, 1897, ch. 109, 29 Stat. 506. The defendant's appeal stated that the district court lacked jurisdiction because the offense for which he was convicted did not occur in American Indian country. The defendant had been arrested while traveling on a train that had just crossed over from American Indian country. The defendant's argument held and the Supreme Court reversed the defendant's conviction remanding the cause to the district court with directions to quash the indictment and discharge the defendant.&lt;ref&gt;"Clairmont v. United States". LexisNexis. 15 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''United States v. Quiver'' (1916)===
This case was sent to the United States Supreme Court after first appearing in a district court in South Dakota. The case dealt with adultery committed on a [[Sioux]] Indian reservation. The district court had held that adultery committed by an Indian with another Indian on an Indian reservation was not punishable under the act of March 3, 1887, c. 397, 24 Stat. 635, now § 316 of the Penal Code. This decision was made because the offense occurred on a Sioux Indian reservation which is not said to be under jurisdiction of the district court. The United States Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the district court saying that the adultery was not punishable as it had occurred between two American Indians on an American Indian reservation.&lt;ref&gt;"United States v. Quiver". LexisNexis. 15 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-reservation boarding schools===

In 1634, Fr. Andrew White of the [[Society of Jesus]] established a mission in what is now the state of [[Maryland]], and the purpose of the mission, stated through an interpreter to the chief of an Indian tribe there, was "to extend civilization and instruction to his ignorant race, and show them the way to heaven".&lt;ref&gt;Foley, Henry. [https://archive.org/details/recordsofenglish00fole Records of the English Province of the Society of Jesus]. 1875. London: Burns and Oates. [https://archive.org/stream/recordsofenglish00fole#page/352/mode/1up p. 352].&lt;/ref&gt; The mission's annual records report that by 1640, a community had been founded which they named St. Mary's, and the Indians were sending their children there "to be educated among the English".&lt;ref&gt;Foley, Henry. [https://archive.org/details/recordsofenglish00fole Records of the English Province of the Society of Jesus]. 1875. London: Burns and Oates. [https://archive.org/stream/recordsofenglish00fole#page/379/mode/1up p. 379]&lt;/ref&gt; This included the daughter of the Pascatoe Indian chief Tayac, which exemplified, or an early co-ed school. The same records report that in 1677, "a school for humanities was opened by our Society in the centre of [Maryland], directed by two of the Fathers; and the native youth, applying themselves assiduously to study, made good progress. Maryland and the recently established school sent two boys to St. Omer who yielded in abilities to few Europeans, when competing for the honour of being first in their class. So that not gold, nor silver, nor the other products of the earth alone, but men also are gathered from thence to bring those regions, which foreigners have unjustly called ferocious, to a higher state of virtue and cultivation."&lt;ref&gt;Foley, Henry.

In 1727, the [[Ursulines|Sisters of the Order of Saint Ursula]] founded [[Ursuline Academy (New Orleans)|Ursuline Academy in New Orleans]], which is currently the oldest, continuously-operating school for girls and the oldest Catholic school in the United States. From the time of its foundation it offered the first classes for Native American girls, and would later offer classes for female African-American slaves and free women of color.

[[File:Male Carlisle School Students 1879.jpg|295px|thumb|left|Male Carlisle School Students 1879.]]

The [[Carlisle Indian Industrial School]] founded by [[Richard Henry Pratt]] in 1879 was the first Indian [[boarding school]] established.  Pratt was encouraged by the progress of Native Americans whom he had supervised as prisoners in Florida, where they had received basic education.  When released, several were sponsored by American church groups to attend institutions such as [[Hampton Institute]]. He believed education was the means to bring American Indians into society.

Pratt professed "assimilation through total immersion". Because he had seen men educated at schools like Hampton Institute become educated and assimilated, he believed the principles could be extended to Indian children. Immersing them in the larger culture would help them adapt. In addition to reading, writing, and arithmetic, the Carlisle curriculum was modeled on the many industrial schools: it constituted vocational training for boys and domestic science for girls, in expectation of their opportunities on the reservations, including chores around the school and producing goods for market. In the summer, students were assigned to local farms and townspeople for boarding and to continue their immersion. They also provided labor at low cost, at a time when many children earned pay for their families.

Carlisle and its curriculum became the model for schools sponsored by the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]]. By 1902 there were twenty-five federally funded non-reservation schools across fifteen states and territories with a total enrollment of over 6,000. Although federal legislation made education compulsory for Native Americans, removing students from reservations required parental authorization. Officials coerced parents into releasing a quota of students from any given reservation.

[[File:Carlisle pupils.jpg|325px|thumb|right|Pupils at Carlisle Indian Industrial School, Pennsylvania (c. 1900)]]

Once the new students arrived at the boarding schools, their lives altered drastically. They were usually given new haircuts, uniforms of European-American style clothes, and even new English names, sometimes based on their own, other times assigned at random. They could no longer speak their own languages, even with each other. They were expected to attend Christian churches. Their lives were run by the strict orders of their teachers, and it often included grueling chores and stiff punishments.

Additionally, infectious disease was widespread in society, and often swept through the schools. This was due to lack of information about causes and prevention, inadequate sanitation, insufficient funding for meals, overcrowded conditions, and students whose resistance was low.

An '''Indian boarding school''' was one of many schools that were established in the United States during the late 19th century to educate [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] youths according to American standards. In some areas, these schools were primarily run by missionaries. Especially given the young age of some of the children sent to the schools, they have been documented as traumatic experiences for many of the children who attended them. They were generally forbidden to speak their native languages, taught [[Christianity]] instead of their native religions, and in numerous other ways forced to abandon their Indian identity and adopt American culture. Many cases of mental and sexual abuse have been documented, as in [[North Dakota]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

By 1923 in the Northwest, most Indian schools had closed and Indian students were attending public schools. States took on increasing responsibility for their education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.english.uiuc.edu/maps/poets/a_f/erdrich/boarding/marr.htm Carolyn Marr, "Assimilation through Education: Indian Boarding Schools in the Northwest"], University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign&lt;/ref&gt;  Other studies suggest attendance in some Indian boarding schools grew in areas of the United States throughout the first half of the 20th century, doubling from 1900 to the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Colmant, S.A. (2000). "U.S. and Canadian Boarding Schools: A Review, Past and Present", ''Native Americas Journal'',17 (4), 24–30.&lt;/ref&gt; Enrollment reached its highest point in the 1970s. In 1973, 60,000 American Indian children were estimated to have been enrolled in an Indian boarding school.&lt;ref&gt;Colmant, S.A. (2000). "U.S. and Canadian Boarding Schools: A Review, Past and Present", ''Native Americas Journal'', 17 (4), 24–30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. Hammerschlag; C.P. Alderfer; and D. Berg, (1973). "Indian Education: A Human Systems Analysis", ''American Journal of Psychiatry''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, the [[Tobeluk vs Lund]] case was brought by teenage Native Alaskan plaintiffs against the State of Alaska alleging that the public school situation was still an unequal one.

===The Meriam Report of 1928===
The Meriam Report,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/research_reports/IndianAdmin/Indian_Admin_Problms.html&lt;/ref&gt; officially titled "The Problem of Indian Administration", was prepared for the Department of Interior. Assessments found the schools to be underfunded and understaffed, too heavily institutionalized, and run too rigidly. What had started as an idealistic program about education had gotten subverted.

It recommended:
* abolishing the "Uniform Course of Study", which taught only majority American cultural values;
* having younger children attend community schools near home, though older children should be able to attend non-reservation schools; and
* ensuring that the Indian Service provided Native Americans with the skills and education to adapt both in their own traditional communities (which tended to be more rural) and the larger American society.

===Indian New Deal===
[[John Collier (sociologist)|John Collier]], the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, 1933–1945, set the priorities of the [[New Deal]] policies toward Native Americans, with an emphasis on reversing as much of the assimilationist policy as he could. Collier was instrumental in ending the loss of reservations lands held by Indians, and in enabling many tribal nations to re-institute self-government and preserve their traditional culture. Some Indian tribes rejected the unwarranted outside interference with their own political systems the new approach had brought them.

Collier's 1920– 1922 visit to [[Taos Pueblo]] had a lasting impression on Collier. He now saw the Indian world as morally superior to American society, which he considered to be "physically, religiously, socially, and aesthetically shattered, dismembered, directionless".&lt;ref&gt;John Collier, "Does the Government Welcome the Indian Arts?" ''The American Magazine of Art. Anniversary Supplement'' vol. 27, no. 9, Part 2 (1934): 10–13&lt;/ref&gt; Collier came under attack for his romantic views about the moral superiority of traditional society as opposed to modernity.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J. Kunitz, "The social philosophy of John Collier." ''Ethnohistory'' (1971): 213–229. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/481531 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Philp says after his experience at the Taos Pueblo, Collier "made a lifelong commitment to preserve tribal community life because it offered a cultural alternative to modernity. ... His romantic stereotyping of Indians often did not fit the reality of contemporary tribal life."&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth R. Philp. "[http://www.anb.org/articles/15/15-00139.html Collier, John]".  ''American National Biography Online'', February 2000. Accessed May 5, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Collier carried through the [[Indian New Deal]] with Congress' passage of the [[Indian Reorganization Act of 1934]]. It was one of the most influential and lasting pieces of legislation relating to federal Indian policy. Also known as the Wheeler–Howard Act, this legislation reversed fifty years of assimilation policies by emphasizing Indian [[self-determination]] and a return of communal Indian land, which was in direct contrast with the objectives of the [[Indian General Allotment Act of 1887]].

Collier was also responsible for getting the [[Johnson–O'Malley Act]] passed in 1934, which allowed the Secretary of the Interior to sign contracts with state governments to subsidize public schooling, medical care, and other services for Indians who did not live on reservations. The act was effective only in Minnesota.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=James Stuart Olson|author2=Raymond Wilson|title=Native Americans in the Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SHj1q_kj1pAC&amp;pg=PA113|year=1986|publisher=University of Illinois Press|pages=113–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collier's support of the [[Navajo Livestock Reduction]] program resulted in [[Navajo people|Navajo]] opposition to the Indian New Deal.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Iverson, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=aP4QyAXsnmkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Dine:+A+History+of+the+Navajos%27%27&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZYVIVemtMYP6aL-sgOAF&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Dine%3A%20A%20History%20of%20the%20Navajos''&amp;f=false Diné: A History of the Navajos]'' (2002) p 144&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald A. Grinde Jr, "Navajo Opposition to the Indian New Deal." ''Integrated Education'' (1981) 19#3-6  pp: 79–87.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Indian Rights Association]] denounced Collier as a "dictator" and accused him of a "near reign of terror" on the Navajo reservation.&lt;ref name="Dippie1991"&gt;Brian W. Dippie, ''The Vanishing American: White Attitudes and U.S. Indian Policy'' (1991) pp 333–336, quote p 335&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian Brian Dippie, "(Collier) became an object of 'burning hatred' among the very people whose problems so preoccupied him."&lt;ref name="Dippie1991" /&gt;

===Change to community schools===
Several events in the late 1960s and mid-1970s (Kennedy Report, National Study of American Indian Education, Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975) led to renewed emphasis on community schools. Many large Indian boarding schools closed in the 1980s and early 1990s. In 2007, 9,500 American Indian children lived in an Indian boarding school dormitory.{{citation needed|date=March 2009}} From 1879 when the Carlisle Indian School was founded to the present day, more than 100,000 American Indians are estimated to have attended an Indian boarding school.

A similar system in Canada was known as the [[Canadian residential school system]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnestyusa.org/amnestynow/soulwound.html Andrea Smith, "Soul Wound: The Legacy of Native American Schools"], ''Amnesty Magazine'', Amnesty International website&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lasting effects of the Americanization policy==

While the concerted effort to assimilate Native Americans into American culture was abandoned officially, integration of Native American tribes and individuals continues to the present day.  Often Native Americans are perceived as having been assimilated. However, some Native Americans feel a particular sense of being from another society or do not belong in a primarily "white" European majority society, despite efforts to socially integrate them.{{citation needed|date=March 2009}}

In the mid-20th century, as efforts were still under way for assimilation, some studies treated American Indians simply as another ethnic minority, rather than citizens of semi-sovereign entities which they are entitled to by treaty. The following quote from the May 1957 issue of ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science'', shows this:

{{quote|The place of Indians in American society may be seen as one aspect of the question of the integration of minority groups into the social system.&lt;ref&gt;Dozier, Edward, et al. "The Integration of Americans of Indian Descent", ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science'', Vol. 311, ''American Indians and American Life'' May 1957, pp. 158–165.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Since the 1960s, however, there have been major changes in society. Included is a broader appreciation for the pluralistic nature of United States society and its many ethnic groups, as well as for the special status of Native American nations. More recent legislation to protect Native American religious practices, for instance, points to major changes in government policy.  Similarly the [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act]] of 1990 was another recognition of the special nature of Native American culture and federal responsibility to protect it.

As of 2013, "Montana is the only state in the U.S. with a constitutional mandate to teach American Indian history, culture, and heritage to preschool through higher education students via the Indian Education for All Act."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==Modern cultural and linguistic preservation==
{{further|Language shift|Language revitalization}}
To evade a shift to English, some Native American tribes have initiated language immersion schools for children, where a native Indian language is the medium of instruction. For example, the [[Cherokee Nation]] instigated a 10-year language preservation plan that involved growing new fluent speakers of the [[Cherokee language]] from childhood on up through school immersion programs as well as a collaborative community effort to continue to use the language at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Native Now : Language: Cherokee| work = We Shall Remain - American Experience - PBS| accessdate = April 9, 2014| year = 2008| url = https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/weshallremain/native_now/language_cherokee}}&lt;/ref&gt; This plan was part of an ambitious goal that in 50 years, 80% or more of the Cherokee people will be fluent in the language.&lt;ref name=preservation/&gt; The [[Cherokee Preservation Foundation]] has invested $3 million into opening schools, training teachers, and developing curricula for language education, as well as initiating community gatherings where the language can be actively used.&lt;ref name=preservation&gt;{{Cite web|title=Cherokee Language Revitalization |work=Cherokee Preservation Foundation |accessdate=April 9, 2014 |year=2014 |url=http://www.cherokeepreservationfdn.org/cultural-preservation-connect/major-programs-and-initiatives/cherokee-language-revitalization |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407070520/http://www.cherokeepreservationfdn.org/cultural-preservation-connect/major-programs-and-initiatives/cherokee-language-revitalization |archivedate=April 7, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Formed in 2006, the Kituwah Preservation &amp; Education Program (KPEP) on the [[Qualla Boundary]] focuses on language immersion programs for children from birth to [[fifth grade]], developing cultural resources for the general public and community language programs to foster the Cherokee language among adults.&lt;ref name="kpep"&gt;Kituwah Preservation &amp; Education Program Powerpoint, by Renissa Walker (2012)'. 2012. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a Cherokee language immersion school in [[Tahlequah, Oklahoma]] that educates students from pre-school through eighth grade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Chavez, Will| title = Immersion students win trophies at language fair| work = Cherokeephoenix.org| accessdate = April 8, 2013| date = April 5, 2012| url = http://www.cherokeephoenix.org/Article/Index/6142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Oklahoma's official language is English, Cherokee immersion students are hindered when taking state-mandated tests because they have little competence in English.&lt;ref name=immersion&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youthonrace.org/cherokee-immersion-school-strives-to-save-tribal-language |title=Cherokee Immersion School Strives to Save Tribal Language |publisher=Youth on Race |accessdate=June 5, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703212619/http://www.youthonrace.org/cherokee-immersion-school-strives-to-save-tribal-language |archivedate=July 3, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Department of Education of Oklahoma said that in 2012 state tests: 11% of the school's sixth-graders showed proficiency in math, and 25% showed proficiency in reading; 31% of the seventh-graders showed proficiency in math, and 87% showed proficiency in reading; 50% of the eighth-graders showed proficiency in math, and 78% showed proficiency in reading.&lt;ref name=immersion/&gt; The Oklahoma Department of Education listed the charter school as a Targeted Intervention school, meaning the school was identified as a low-performing school but has not so that it was a Priority School.&lt;ref name=immersion/&gt; Ultimately, the school made a C, or a 2.33 grade point average on the state's A–F report card system.&lt;ref name=immersion/&gt; The report card shows the school getting an F in mathematics achievement and mathematics growth, a C in social studies achievement, a D in reading achievement, and an A in reading growth and student attendance.&lt;ref name=immersion/&gt; "The C we made is tremendous," said school principal Holly Davis, "[t]here is no English instruction in our school's younger grades, and we gave them this test in English."&lt;ref name=immersion/&gt; She said she had anticipated the low grade because it was the school's first year as a state-funded [[charter school]], and many students had difficulty with English.&lt;ref name=immersion/&gt; Eighth graders who graduate from the Tahlequah immersion school are fluent speakers of the language, and they usually go on to attend [[Sequoyah High School (Tahlequah, Oklahoma)|Sequoyah High School]] where classes are taught in both English and Cherokee.

'''''Dar al-Hikma''''' ({{lang-ar|دار الحكمة}}, 'House of Wisdom') was an underground publishing house, set up by the [[Iraqi Communist Party]] in September 1945.&lt;ref name="Thompson2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Elizabeth F.

}}In November 2009, the [[California State Legislature|California Legislature]] enacted SBX7 1 (Delta Reform Act)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=200920107SB1&amp;search_keywords|title=Bill Text - SBX7-1 Public resources.|website=leginfo.legislature.ca.gov|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;, one of several bills passed related to water supply reliability, ecosystem health, and the [[Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta|Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta]]. The Act, effective on Feb. 3, 2010, called for the creation of the Delta Stewardship Council&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ca.gov/Agencies/Delta-Stewardship-Council|title=CA.gov {{!}} Delta Stewardship Council|last=|first=|date=|website=deltacouncil.ca.gov|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The Council has seven members&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://deltacouncil.ca.gov/delta-council-members|title=Delta Council Members {{!}} Delta Stewardship Council|website=deltacouncil.ca.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;, who are consulted by a 10-member board of scientists, the Delta Independent Science Board&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://deltacouncil.ca.gov/science-board/delta-independent-science-board|title=Delta Independent Science Board {{!}} Delta Stewardship Council|website=deltacouncil.ca.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The Act required that the Council develop a management plan for the Delta to ensure coordinated action at the federal, state, and local levels. This document is referred to as the Delta Plan&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.watereducation.org/aquapedia/delta-plan|title=The Delta Plan {{!}} Water Education Foundation|last=|first=|date=|website=deltacouncil.ca.gov|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Part of SBX7 1, Water Code Section 85204 also mandated the Council "establish and oversee a committee of agencies responsible for implementing the Delta Plan&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=85204.&amp;lawCode=WAT|title=Law section|website=leginfo.legislature.ca.gov|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;" to ensure that the actions of other agencies conform to the Delta Plan's policies.

As stated in the Delta Reform Act, the Council stems from the California (CALFED) Bay-Delta Authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.calwater.ca.gov/calfed/about/History/Detailed.html|title=History of CALFED Bay-Delta Program|last=Program|first=State of California, CALFED Bay-Delta|website=www.calwater.ca.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the Delta Science Program&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://deltacouncil.ca.gov/science-program|title=Delta Stewardship Council|website=deltacouncil.ca.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; replaced the CALFED Science Program&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://science.calwater.ca.gov/|title=CALFED Science Program - Home page|last=California|first=State of|website=science.calwater.ca.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Delta Independent Science Board replaced the CALFED Independent Science Board&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.science.calwater.ca.gov/isb/isb_index.html|title=CALFED Science Program - Independent Science Board|last=Board|first=CALFED Science Program Independent Science|website=www.science.calwater.ca.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

:''This party is not to be confused with any of the other [[Democratic Labour Party (disambiguation)|Democratic Labour parties]]''

'''Democratic Labour''' was a minor [[political party]] operating in the [[United Kingdom]] in the 1970s.  They were formed by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MP, [[Dick Taverne]] when his [[Constituency Labour Party]] ([[Lincoln (UK Parliament constituency)|Lincoln]]) asked him to stand down as their candidate at the next general election.  He had fallen out with them over Britain's continued membership of the [[European Economic Community]] which he supported but they did not.

Taverne resigned from Labour on 6 October 1972, forming the ''Lincoln Democratic Labour Association'' which his supporters in the CLP joined. His initial ambitions were to eventually re-join the Labour Party, but there were some who attempted to persuade him to try to establish a new party of the political centre.

Taverne [[resignation from the British House of Commons|resigned]] from [[parliament of the United Kingdom|parliament]] at the same time that he resigned from the Labour Party in order to force the issue into the open, and he won the ensuing [[Lincoln by-election, 1973|Lincoln by-election]], held in March,1973.

His victory was aided by the lack of a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] candidate as it decided instead to support his candidacy (in those days the party was only able to stand in a limited number of places and had a very limited base to work from in Lincoln) and the controversial adoption of [[Jonathan Guinness]] by the Conservatives.

Shortly after his by-election victory, Taverne formed the ''[[Campaign for Social Democracy]]'' as a nationally based body. He was re-elected in the [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|February 1974 general election]], and continued to serve until the [[United Kingdom general election, October 1974|October 1974 general election]] when he was defeated (Wilson demanding the Labour Party "throw the kitchen sink" at Lincoln to get him out). He did not stand in the seat again, but Democratic Labour continued to organise politically, to the extent that Democratic Labour controlled Lincoln City Council from 1973 until 1979 and across England during the [[United_Kingdom_local_elections,_1973|1973 local elections]] Democratic Labour candidates achieved some success.&lt;ref&gt;How the Main Counties voted: "All over the country freelance candidates appeared wearing the Democratic Labour ticket...and several did well.", ''[[The Economist]]'', 21 April 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 general election]], Democratic Labour contested two seats: [[Lincoln (UK Parliament constituency)|Lincoln]] and [[Brigg and Scunthorpe (UK Parliament constituency)|Brigg and Scunthorpe]]. Taverne advised against nominating any candidates but campaigned for them anyway. Both were unsuccessful in their attempts to gain seats in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], losing their deposits (at that time, 12.5% of the vote was needed to keep deposits, falling to 5% after the 1983 General Election).

In 1980, Democratic Labour merged with the [[Social Democratic Alliance (UK)|Social Democratic Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;"Boost for Labour right", ''[[The Guardian]]'', 15 February 1980&lt;/ref&gt;  A social club they had established ran until 1987.

In many ways, Democratic Labour can be seen as a forerunner of the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]], which was formed by many of the viewpoints as Taverne, that broke away from Labour in the early 1980s. Taverne twice stood as a Social Democratic Party candidate but failed to be elected.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2558">The '''European Border Surveillance System''' (commonly abbreviated '''Eurosur''') is a surveillance system of the [[European Union]] (EU) that uses [[Unmanned combat air vehicle|drones]], [[reconnaissance]] aircraft, [[Intertidal zone|offshore]] sensors and satellite remote sensing, to track [[illegal immigration]] into the member states of the [[European Union]]. The program was put into effect by the [[European parliament]] on October 10, 2013. On December 2, 2013, Eurosur was started in 18 EU member states and Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Europa-setzt-neues-System-an-seinen-Grenzen-ein-Eurosur-startet-2058328.html |title=Europa setzt neues System an seinen Grenzen ein: Eurosur startet |publisher=[[heise.de]] |access-date=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eurosur is primarily a program that allows exchange of information, that supports the cooperation of national immigration agencies. Its goal is to gain information about recent refugee movements and the activity of human trafficking organizations as quickly as possible.

The rescue of people in distress has also been adopted into the Eurosur regulation.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tagesschau.de/ausland/eurosur100.html&lt;/ref&gt; Different aspects of the program are being criticized.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/eurosur-ueberwachung-statt-rettung-a-927140.html&lt;/ref&gt;

As of October 2013, 244 million Euros have been secured from the EU budget for the installation and maintenance of the system until 2020. Critics expect the costs of the project to surpass one billion Euros - other sources however mention expected costs of around 340 million Euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.euractiv.de/soziales-europa/artikel/parlament-sagt-ja-zu-ueberwachungssystem-eurosur-008106 |title=Parlament sagt ja zu Überwachungssystem EUROSUR |access-date=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Felice Casson''' (born 5 August 1953 in [[Chioggia]], [[Province of Venice]]) is an [[Italy|Italian]] [[magistrate]] and [[politician]], who discovered the existence of [[Operation Gladio]], a "[[stay-behind]]" [[NATO]] [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] army during the [[Cold War]], while investigating on the  [[Years of Lead (Italy)#Peteano bombing|Peteano bombing]] in 1972, for which two neo-fascists were convicted; the explosives used in the attack supposedly came from a NATO arms cache.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = 'Gladio' dominates Italy's political arena | publisher = The Independent | date = 1990-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 622 Gladio members, including two people who served as prime minister and president, were exposed in the course of the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&amp;link=140315 Gladio prosecutor Casson: Ergenekon-like organizations spread like cancer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205083343/http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&amp;link=140315 |date=2008-12-05 }}, ''[[Today's Zaman]]'', 28 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Felice Casson is a Member of the [[Senate of the Republic (Italy)|Senate of the Italian Republic]].

He obtained a law degree from [[Padua University]] and entered the magistracy in 1980 as an investigating magistrate. He was subsequently appointed as responsible for preliminary investigations and was public prosecutor in Venice from 1993 to 2005.

He has been on leave since 2006 following his election to the [[Italian Parliament]]. In 2008 he was re-elected to the Senate and elected Vice President of the [[Partito Democratico|Democratic Party]] Group. As a magistrate, among the many investigations conducted by Casson - especially in the field of terrorism, the fight against corruption, environmental security, the protection of workers and citizens from exposure to carcinogenic agents - are those on the [[Vincenzo Vinciguerra|Peteano massacre]], disloyalty of the intelligence service and the State apparatus, terrorism and radical right-wing and international subversive organisations, global trade in warfare material, the GLADIO case, political corruption in the [[Veneto]] region, the fire of [[La Fenice]] Theatre in Venice, the trials over deaths from [[Vinyl chloride|VCM]], [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] and [[asbestos]] in [[Marghera]], investigations into environmental pollution, disorders caused by [[depleted uranium]] and radio spectrum pollution.

As a Senator, he was member of the following committees: Committee on Elections and Parliamentary Immunity, Committee on the Prosecution of Government Members, Standing Commission on the Justice, Committee of Inquiry into Depleted Uranium and the Committee on Workplace Deaths.

In particular, he introduced and promoted bills on the fight against corruption and organized crime, the streamlining of civil and criminal law proceedings, safety and prevention measures for workers exposed to genotoxic, carcinogenic substances such [[asbestos]] and [[Vinyl chloride|VCM]], environmental crime, population safety and the protection of crime victims.

He taught [[Environmental Law]] at the [[Università Iuav di Venezia|Venice Istituto Universitario di Architettura]] and the [[Università telematica internazionale Uninettuno]].

He is a member of the scientific board of the Venice International Academy of Environmental Sciences (IAES).

Casson features in the 2009 documentary ''[[:de:Plastic Planet]]'', directed by [[:de:Werner Boote]].

The '''Human Relations Area Files, Inc.''' ('''HRAF'''), located in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] is a nonprofit international membership organization with over 500 member institutions in the U.S. and more than 20 other countries. A financially autonomous research agency based at [[Yale University]] since 1949, its mission is to promote understanding of cultural diversity and commonality in the past and present. To accomplish this mission, the Human Relations Area Files produces scholarly resources and infrastructure for research, teaching and learning, and supports and conducts original research on cross-cultural variation.  

HRAF produces two flagship databases accessible by its members: ''eHRAF World Cultures'' and ''eHRAF Archaeology''. HRAF also sponsors and edits the quarterly journal, [[Cross-Cultural Research|Cross-Cultural Research: The Journal of Comparative Social Science]]. Expanded and updated annually, ''eHRAF World Cultures'' includes ethnographic materials on cultures, past and present, all over the world. Also expanding annually, ''eHRAF Archaeology'' covers major archaeological traditions and many more sub-traditions and sites around the world. Documents in both ''eHRAF'' databases are subject-indexed at the paragraph level by HRAF anthropologists. 

In addition, HRAF offers several open-access resources. [http://hraf.yale.edu/ehc ''Explaining Human Culture''] is a database with standardized summaries that provides a searchable way for researchers to find out what has been learned from previous cross-cultural research about cultural universals and differences. ''Explaining Human Culture'' also features topical articles on cross-cultural insights (e.g., cross-cultural perspectives on childhood, dwellings, and sports). ''[http://hraf.yale.edu/ccc/ Introducing Cross-Cultural Research]'' is a series of PDFs constituting a "crash course" in cross-cultural methods. Finally, ''[http://hraf.yale.edu/teaching-ehraf/ Teaching eHRAF]'' is a library of teaching exercises and syllabi (many designed by professors at member institutions) that use ''eHRAF'' to explore cultural diversity.

==History==
On February 26, 1949, delegates from [[Harvard University]], the [[University of Pennsylvania]], the [[University of Oklahoma]], the [[University of Washington]], and [[Yale University]] met in New Haven, Connecticut to pledge their membership in a new nonprofit research consortium to be based at Yale. The plan was to "develop and distribute files of organized information related to human societies and cultures."&lt;ref&gt;[[Clellan S. Ford|Ford, Clellan S.]] 1970. ''[http://hraf.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/HRAF-1949-1969.pdf Human Relations Area Files: 1949-1969, a Twenty-Year Report] (10).'' (New Haven, CT: Human Relations Area Files).&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the new inter-university corporation was the Human Relations Area Files, Inc. (HRAF). It is an ever-growing catalogue of cross-indexed ethnographic data, sorted and filed by geographic location and cultural characteristics.

The name came from the Institute of Human Relations, an interdisciplinary program at Yale at the time. The Institute of Human Relations had sponsored HRAF's precursor, the ''Cross-Cultural Survey'' (see [[George Peter Murdock]]), as part of an effort to develop an integrated science of human behavior and culture.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carol R. Ember|Ember, Carol R.]] 2012. Human Relations Area Files. In Leadership in Science and Technology: A Reference Handbook, vol 2. William S. Bainbridge, ed. (Los Angeles: Sage Reference), pp. 619-627.&lt;/ref&gt; On May 7, 1949, the HRAF consortium was formally established with three additional universities—the [[University of Chicago]], the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]], and the [[University of Southern California]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Clellan S. Ford|Ford, Clellan S.]] 1970. ''[http://hraf.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/HRAF-1949-1969.pdf Human Relations Area Files: 1949-1969, a Twenty-Year Report] (11).'' (New Haven, CT: Human Relations Area Files).&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018, there are 21 sponsoring members and hundreds of associate members. The HRAF Collection of Ethnography (the pre-electronic precursor to ''eHRAF World Cultures'') was originally distributed as paper files. From the early 1960s until 1994, most members received their annual installments on [[microfiche]]. Since 1994, the annual installments have been in electronic form, first on CD-ROM and later online.&lt;ref&gt;[[Melvin Ember|Ember, Melvin]]. 2000. [http://hraf.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/HRAF-in-the-21st-Century.pdf ''HRAF in the 21st Century: Blueprint for the Future after 50 Years''.] (New Haven, CT: Human Relations Area Files).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinctiveness of the databases==

The HRAF databases were developed to foster comparative research on humans in all their variety, from small-scale hunting and gathering societies to complex states. This provides a contrast to databases that focus solely on countries. In addition, the databases, in contrast to bibliographic ones that provide pointers to materials, actually contain those materials. Searching across cultures for particular kinds of information is facilitated by the unique ethnographic subject classification system that HRAF has developed and refined over more than 60 years, the [http://ehrafworldcultures.yale.edu/webhelp/#Get_Started/ocm_c.html Outline of Cultural Materials] or OCM. In contrast to most subject-indexing which is done at the document level, HRAF has its indexers subject index at the paragraph level. 

For example, suppose users are interested in assessing the degree to which various cultures depend on stored foods. They would discover that there is an index subject category called "Preservation and Storage of Food" (OCM 251). Searching by that subject category would retrieve all of the paragraphs that describe dried, smoked, pickled, refrigerated, frozen, and canned foods, and whatever other ways the people of the given culture store or preserve food. The analysts at HRAF, who have read through and indexed every page of every text that goes into the HRAF files, have made it possible to find the relevant information, even when the user does not know in advance which particular words (including untranslated native words) the original authors may have used. It is also possible to search the eHRAF texts by the words that actually appear in them. The most efficient searches may use a combination of OCM subject categories and keywords, using Boolean operators. But, if there is no standard vocabulary for the subject matter of interest, the user can always use the OCM subject categories to get to the particular kinds of information sought.

==Uses of the eHRAF collections==

The eHRAF Collections can be used for teaching and research on any aspect of cultural and social life. The collections are primarily organized by major geographical region, and then by culture or archaeological tradition, so researchers can access information about particular cultures, particular regions of the world, or do a worldwide or regional cross-cultural comparison. See [[Cross-cultural studies]].

===Cross-cultural research===
Although the HRAF collections can be used for many purposes, they were primarily designed to enable researchers to find information quickly across a broad range of cultures so that societies could be compared on particular dimensions of variation. Most cross-cultural researchers test hypotheses on worldwide samples with the aim of arriving at valid generalizations about human behavior and social and cultural life. But smaller-scale comparisons are also possible, such as regional comparisons, or comparisons of particular types of societies (such as hunter-gatherers or prehistoric states). While passages in ethnographies or archaeological reports are readily found using HRAF's subject-indexing system, there are few pre-coded variables in eHRAF. Therefore, a researcher needs to develop nominal, ordinal, or interval coding scales to measure the particular types of variation he or she is interested in measuring.

For example, the subject category "Techniques of Socialization" (OCM 861) will find passages that deal with cultural ideas about childtraining or general methods of discipline, but coding schemes need to be developed to measure dimensions of variation, such as "degree to which corporal punishment is employed," "degree to which threatening is employed," or "degree to which children are praised." It is not difficult, after a little practice, to develop ordinal scales that can allow for the coding of words into quantitative measures, and once that is done it is easy to use available software to test hypotheses, and compare, combine, and model the results. The indexed texts in HRAF are also amenable to qualitative cross-cultural comparisons.

The HRAF databases were built somewhat opportunistically, so for hypothesis-testing research it is best to use a sub-sample within ''eHRAF'' that was designed to be representative. There are two main representative sub-samples within ''eHRAF World Cultures'' and one within ''eHRAF Archaeology''. ''eHRAF World Cultures'' contains 1) a 60-culture sample known as the [http://hraf.yale.edu/resources/reference/probability-sample-files-psf/ ''Probability Sample Files'' (PSF)]; and 2) most of the societies in the [http://hraf.yale.edu/resources/reference/sccs-cases-in-ehraf/ Standard Cross-Cultural Sample] (expected to be completely included by 2020). Researchers can use the PSF to test hypotheses on a fairly large and unbiased sample of the world's cultures. Because the PSF sample includes only one culture (that met data quality criteria) randomly selected from each of 60 macro-culture areas around the world, correlations and other statistical results are likely to be trustworthy and functional, not due to duplications in the sample because of random diffusion or common ancestry. From 2000 on, ''eHRAF World Cultures'' has included additional randomly selected cases that may be added to the PSF for scientific sampling (called the Simple Random Sample). The Standard Cross-Cultural Sample of 186 societies also stratified the world into culture areas and then chose one society per culture area, but it differs from the PSF in that 200 culture areas were used and the choice of a society was based on judgmental rather than random selection. ''eHRAF Archaeology'' includes an annually-growing Simple Random Sample (SRS) of archaeological traditions drawn from the Outline Of Archaeological Traditions that can be used for hypothesis-testing. In addition, ''eHRAF Archaeology'' contains complete tradition sequences. 

The results of cross-cultural studies using [[ethnography]] are usually correlational. But it would be informative to go beyond cross-sectional validation, in particular to see if temporal sequences validate causal theories. The ''eHRAF World Cultures'' database often contains information from more than one time period, so while not often done, it is possible to measure ethnographic cases for two different points in time. But for many questions about cultural evolution, the ethnographic (or ethnohistorical) record is not likely to provide enough of the necessary time-series data for statistical analysis.

This dilemma particularly applies to the classical questions about human [[cultural evolution]], including the emergence of agriculture, the rise of social inequality and the first cities, and the origins of the state.  Investigators of cultural evolution can use the ''eHRAF World Cultures and eHRAF Archaeology'' databases to study and model causal sequences. Cross-cultural (comparative ethnographic) studies can provide archaeological indicators of cultural and other (e.g., physical and social environmental) features. Using those indicators, researchers could test many causal ideas about the major events in cultural evolution and devolution on the time-series data in the archaeological record. Thus, the data in ''eHRAF Archaeology'' can allow researchers to determine whether evolutionary patterns in one region are repeated in others, and to determine whether the presumed causal factors in one region are important, and antecedent, in other world regions too. Comparative ethnography can tell us about cultural statics, what predicts cross-cultural variation in recent times. Comparative archaeology can tell us about cultural dynamics, what comes first and what follows what in prehistory.

More and more types of investigators—not just anthropologists—are now doing worldwide cross-cultural research. Psychologists, political scientists, sociologists, and evolutionary biologists also now use HRAF to test universal hypotheses.

'''Ion Mihalache''' ({{IPA-ro|iˈon mihaˈlake}}; March 3, 1882 – February 5, 1963) was a [[Romania]]n [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] politician, the founder and leader of the [[Peasants' Party (Romania)|Peasants' Party]] (PȚ) and a main figure of its successor, the [[National Peasants' Party]] (PNȚ).

==Early life==
A schoolteacher born into a peasant family of [[Topoloveni]], he served as a [[lieutenant]] in the [[Romanian Army]] during [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="Rouček, p.84-85"&gt;Rouček, p.84-85&lt;/ref&gt; Mihalache, who soon became popular among [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] priests and village teachers, served as president of the local teachers' association.&lt;ref name="Rouček, p.84-85"/&gt;

He founded the PȚ in the [[Romanian Old Kingdom]] in 1918; under his leadership, it emerged from northern [[Muntenia]] and became a grouping with national appeal.&lt;ref&gt;Rouček, p.85&lt;/ref&gt; The PȚ had much success in the [[Romanian general election, 1919|elections of November 1919]], forming a coalition government with the [[Transylvania]]n [[Romanian National Party]] (PNR), under [[Alexandru Vaida-Voevod]]. As a politician, Mihalache made himself known for supporting a political option that mixed traditionalist reserve towards [[industrialization]] and calls for preserving the rural base of Romanian economy through voluntary [[cooperative farming]] (allowing for a peasant-based industry) with a vision of [[left-wing]] [[Corporatism]]. In 1929, he wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Many have thought that [economic success] was only possible for the large-scale agricultural entrepreneur. And this is why they have supported that only on the basis of large-scale property can there be carried out a wise and lucrative agriculture, and that dividing the land leads to a decrease in production.&lt;br&gt;Perhaps it would be this way, if the small-scale agricultural entrepreneur will not 'organize' himself and will not enlighten himself.&lt;br&gt;But the cure was found: the association of peasants into agricultural cooperatives, which bring: money, as well as utensils, as well as ''regulated sales'', as well as ''industrialization''."&lt;ref&gt;Mihalache, "A patra scrisoare către plugari", ''[[Dreptatea]]'', September 15, 1929, in Niculae ''et al.'', p.153 (Mihalache's italics)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He notably took the initiative in calling for peaceful marches of peasants and members of the rural [[intelligentsia]], and would almost always dress in accordance with the peasant tradition of his native [[Muscel County]].&lt;ref&gt;Scurtu, "Întâlniri pe înserat..."; Veiga, p.28&lt;/ref&gt;

==1919-1920==
Mihalache became Vaida-Voevod's Minister of Agriculture on December 16, 1919, in a cabinet replacing that of General [[Artur Văitoianu]]. Despite having led a [[Populism|populist]] movement, the [[People's Party (interwar Romania)|People's Party]], Averescu continuously opposed Mihalache's push for widespread [[land reform]].&lt;ref name="Scurtu, Întâlniri pe înserat"&gt;Scurtu, "Întâlniri pe înserat..."&lt;/ref&gt;

The new minister found himself at odds with the political establishment over the issue of land redistribution: promised by [[Ion I. C. Brătianu]]'s [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal]] (PNL) government during [[World War I]], and partly carried out in December 1918, the move viewed as incomplete - [[Nationalization|expropriations]] had not led to a redefinition of peasant property, and land had remained with provisional cooperatives instead of being allocated to members. Mihalache supported the fragmentation of all land property in a country of medium to small sized landowners. The Peasants' Party calculated leaving no landowner with more than on one square kilometre, which also included expropriating land for common [[pasture]]. At the same time, Vaida-Voevod's government created a conflict over its projects for constitutional reform, clashing with the PNL over the [[Centralized government|highly centralized government]] and support for the [[1866 Constitution of Romania]] advocated by the latter. Mihalache is also known to have traveled incognito to various locations, as a means to observe first-hand abuse by government officials.&lt;ref name="Scurtu, Întâlniri pe înserat"/&gt;

After a deadlock over these issues in [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]], Averescu's group and the National Liberals began negotiation a new parliamentary majority; advised by [[Nicolae Iorga]], who was president of the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Chamber]], Mihalache handed in his resignation (March 12, 1920), with the expectation that the land reform project was to be endorsed by parliamentary initiative.&lt;ref name="Scurtu, Întâlniri pe înserat"/&gt; It was advanced later in the same day by the PȚ's [[Grigore Iunian]].&lt;ref name="Scurtu, Întâlniri pe înserat"/&gt; [[King of Romania|King]] [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand I]] intervened in favor of the National Liberals, installing Averescu, who had reached an agreement with Brătianu, as [[List of Prime Ministers of Romania|Prime Minister]].&lt;ref name="Scurtu, Întâlniri pe înserat"/&gt;

A major factor in this move was pressure from the landowners to remove a threat to the system (notably, [[Constantin Garoflid]] filed a complaint with the king,&lt;ref name="Scurtu, Întâlniri pe înserat"/&gt; while Mihalache caused scandal when he publicly assured peasants that the monarch's opposition was ultimately irrelevant.&lt;ref name="Scurtu, Întâlniri pe înserat"/&gt; At the same time, the PȚ's politics had given way to fears that it was a Romanian equivalent of [[Aleksandar Stamboliyski]]'s [[Bulgarian Agrarian People's Union Alexander Stambolijski|Agrarian Union]] of [[Bulgaria]], or even a parallel to [[Bolshevism]]. To the latter accusation, Mihalache once replied indicating, as other leaders of his party had done, his belief that the peasant's needs identified with the [[national interest]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Thus &amp;mdash; after so many years of 'harmony', we arrive today as the 'agitators of social order' and clearly state:&lt;br&gt;''Enough with the lie about social harmony. There is a [[Class conflict|conflict between social classes]]. We do not deny it, but rather bring it to light. We wish to take part in the fight in the name of an underprivileged [[working class]], the peasantry. We wish to rally it in a class party. We shall not ask anybody for power, we shall fight to have the fair number of representatives of the peasant class in Parliament. May each class fight for this'' [that is, for their respective seats] ''and parliament will give itself the government it sees fit.''&lt;br&gt;As for ''"social harmony"'' &amp;mdash; as this has been up to now &amp;mdash; we demand ''a particular'' balance between producing classes and wish for ''the abolition of [[Parasitism (social offense)|parasite]] classes'' such as that of ''untrained politicians''.&lt;br&gt;[...]'Bolshevism', cry the parasite politicians, accustomed to govern together with the highest power&lt;ref&gt;As indicated by another passage of the same text, Mihalache is alluding to the [[King of Romania]], [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand I]], who was a political associate of the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]] and its leader [[Ion I. C. Brătianu]] ("[The other parties take confidence in the fact that] ''the king shall give them'' the government to govern in the name of one class, and not over all" &amp;mdash; Mihalache, in Niculae ''et al.'', p.79; Mihalache's italics)&lt;/ref&gt; and their cries also alert the gentle folk, whose political judgment is chained in 'harmony'-related prejudice.&lt;br&gt;&amp;mdash; 'Truth is not [[Anomie|anarchy]]' &amp;mdash; we reply."&lt;ref&gt;Mihalache, "Partidul Țărănesc. Partid de clasă?", ''Țară Nouă'', July 6, 1919, in Niculae ''et al.'', p.80 (Mihalache's italics)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The land reform that was ultimately carried out did however reflect the influence of some ideas supported by Mihalache, and was itself favorable to small holdings.

==PȚ-PNR union==
Mihalache became vice-president of the National Peasants' Party (PNȚ) in 1926, when the PNR and PȚ groups decided to unite in order to combat the effective monopoly the PNL had ensured after the voting of the [[1923 Constitution of Romania|1923 Constitution]]. The new political group moderated many of its demands, and was not as adverse to industrialization as it had previously been.&lt;ref&gt;Veiga, p.100-101&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1928, Mihalache's voiced the party's call for a march on Bucharest, meant to topple [[Vintilă Brătianu]]'s PNL cabinet: in May, large crowds gathered in [[Alba Iulia]] &amp;mdash; despite the initial success in rallying all forces opposed to the National Liberals, the PNȚ did not capitalize on the gains, and continued instead to block activity in  parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Veiga, p.101-102&lt;/ref&gt;

He served as Minister of Agriculture in the [[Iuliu Maniu]]'s government of 1928-1930 (being seconded by [[Armand Călinescu]]), then, between 1930 and 1933, he was the [[List of Romanian Interior Ministers|Minister of Internal Affairs]] (he also held the office of [[List of Romanian Foreign Ministers|Foreign Minister]] between late 1930 and early 1931). In this latter capacity, Mihalache outlawed the [[Fascism|fascist]] [[Iron Guard]] in January 1931 (under the premiership of [[Gheorghe Mironescu]]), following a period of violence and agitation by the movement.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.295; Veiga, p.126&lt;/ref&gt; The measure was to prove inefficient in time, as the new cabinet allowed [[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu]], leader of the Guard, to run in the [[Romanian general election, 1931|1931 elections]] on a new platform (the ''Corneliu Codreanu Grouping'').&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.295&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period, he also became a noted opponent of [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]]: as [[heir apparent]], the latter had been denied the right of ascension after the war, and returned to the throne with Maniu's backing in 1930. The relations between the PNȚ and the monarch soured, however, especially after Vaida-Voevod's second cabinet fell in 1932, due to disagreement over several policies &amp;mdash; as Minister of the Interior, Mihalache was directly involved in the dispute, as the scandal erupted when [[Gavrilă Marinescu]], the prefect of police in Bucharest, refused to hand in his resignation, and instead called for the king's verdict.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.224; Scurtu, "Ianuarie 1933"&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935, Mihalache briefly took charge of the party upon Maniu's resignation, and steered it to the Left, charging [[Mihai Ralea]] and the PNȚ's Study Circle ([[Constantin Rădulescu-Motru]], [[Mihail Ghelmegeanu]], [[Ernest Ene]], and [[Petre Andrei]]) with drafting a new party program that adapted [[Poporanism|Poporanist]] ideals.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.119-120&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1938, when, faced with the rise of the Iron Guard, Carol imposed his [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] regime, the PNȚ party refused collaboration and merger into the [[National Renaissance Front]]. According to the leading party member [[Ioan Hudiță]], Mihalache, together with [[Virgil Madgearu]] and [[Mihai Popovici]], continued to display support for the king and even considered joining the Front.&lt;ref&gt;Hudiță&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II and after==
During [[World War II]], he opposed the [[National Legionary State]] created by the Iron Guard, and complained to the Guard's rival partner, ''[[Conducător]]'' [[Ion Antonescu]], that [[Horia Sima]] and his grouping had assumed control of his cooperative organization in [[Muscel County]].&lt;ref name="Scurtu, PNL și PNȚ..., p.7"&gt;Scurtu, "PNL și PNȚ...", p.7&lt;/ref&gt; Antonescu refused to mediate; Sima replied to Mihalache that the measure had been partly taken as compensation for the Legionaries' "suffering at the hands of Mihalache [in 1930-1931]", but offered to allow some of the Muscel cooperative's former administrators structure to regain their positions.&lt;ref name="Scurtu, PNL și PNȚ..., p.7"/&gt; Attacks and threats towards Mihalache in the Guard's press became widespread, and [[Mille Lefter]] singled him out as a former persecutor of the movement in a conference aired on [[Romanian Radio Broadcasting Company|Romanian Radio]].&lt;ref name="Scurtu, PNL și PNȚ..., p.11"&gt;Scurtu, "PNL și PNȚ...", p.11&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Antonescu's defeat of the Guard during the [[Legionnaires' Rebellion and Bucharest Pogrom|Legionary Rebellion]] of 1941, Mihalache forwarded a congratulatory message to the former.&lt;ref name="Scurtu, PNL și PNȚ..., p.11"/&gt; In time, he also objected to Antonescu's [[Nazi Germany]]-allied dictatorship of (although pressured by the latter to join a [[War Cabinet]]).&lt;ref&gt;Otu, p.17&lt;/ref&gt; He did, however, support the recovery of [[Bessarabia]] from the [[Soviet Union]] during [[Operation Barbarossa]], and offered his services as a volunteer in the [[Romanian Army]] (June 1941) &amp;mdash; he served for only a few days, and was discharged on orders from Antonescu himself.&lt;ref&gt;Otu, p.17-19&lt;/ref&gt;

He eventually joined a semi-clandestine opposition, and then supported the PNȚ's entry into the underground liberation movement, as well as King [[Michael I of Romania|Michael]]'s pro-[[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[Romania during World War II#The royal coup|August 1944 coup]].

The appearance of the [[Iron Curtain]] and [[Joseph Stalin]]'s plans for Romania singled out the PNȚ, the main supporter of cooperation with the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]], as an adversary of growing Soviet influence over the country (''see [[Soviet occupation of Romania]]''). Consequently, he and Maniu were branded "fascists" by the [[Romanian Communist Party]] press,&lt;ref&gt;Frunză, p.139&lt;/ref&gt; and Mihalache was especially attacked for his supposedly good relations with Antonescu;&lt;ref&gt;Frunză, p.267; Otu, p.15&lt;/ref&gt; the 1941 episode was used against him during the rigged [[Romanian general election, 1946|1946 elections]], when Communists prevented him from running for office based on a law forbidding candidatures of former [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;Frunză, p.287&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible, however, that just before the elections, the PNȚ had attempted to resist and profit from a foreseen insurrection against the [[Petru Groza]] government, by forming ''Cercul Militar Professional'' (the "Professional Military Circle") &amp;mdash; grouping generals and other officers, it was led by Mihalache himself.&lt;ref&gt;Frunză, p.295&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Communist Romania|Communist regime]] which was installed in late 1947 outlawed the PNȚ altogether, alleging that Mihalache and Maniu had been trying to flee the country from the airfield in [[Tămădău]], and had planned to give Romania a [[Capitalism|capitalist]] [[government-in-exile]].&lt;ref&gt;Frunză, p.300-303&lt;/ref&gt; Their capture (''see [[Tămădău Affair]]'') and trial by a [[kangaroo court]] led to sentences of [[life imprisonment]] with requirements of [[penal labour]]; Mihalache, after having passed through [[Sighet prison]], died in custody at [[Râmnicu Sărat prison]].&lt;ref&gt;Frunză, p.388&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kostka Napierski uprising''' was a [[peasant revolt]] in Poland in 1651.

It took place at the same time as the more important [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]] in the south-east part of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and during the Swedish preparation to invade the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]].

[[Aleksander Kostka Napierski]] was an adventurer and officer in the Polish army. During the revolt, he acted most likely as a spy for [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]] or the Prince of [[Transylvania]]. He recruited his forces from among some rebellious highlanders in [[Podhale]] – a mountainous region in [[Lesser Poland]]. They attacked and captured the castle of [[Czorsztyn]] in [[Pieniny]]. Napierski called on every peasant in Poland to rise and overthrow the [[Szlachta|nobles]] and remove them from their positions of power. His attempts to spread the revolt were totally unsuccessful. Napierski and his rebel group remained isolated in the castle, which was soon recaptured by the forces of [[Piotr Gembicki]], [[bishop of Kraków]]. Napierski and the other leaders of the revolt were [[Impalement|impaled]].

Research conducted by Polish historian [[Adam Kersten]] has shown that many facts about Napierski and his plans are either difficult or even impossible to bring to light. It is claimed that Napierski's attempt to lead a revolt by the peasants in Lesser Poland was aimed at disorganizing the Polish defence against the advancing armies of Chmielnicki. In fact, two thousand troops were sent by the king from Ukraine to crush the rebellion. Additionally, Napierski was executed before they even reached Czorsztyn. Even without these troops, the Polish army won a decisive victory in the [[battle of Berestechko]].

'''''Landammann''''' (plural ''Landamänner''), is the German title used by the [[chief magistrate]] in certain [[Cantons of Switzerland]] and at times featured in the Head of state's style at the confederal level.

==Old Swiss Confederacy==
''Landammann'' or ''Ammann''  was the elected judge and leader of the [[Landsgemeinde]].
The term existed in the high medieval period, and was continued in the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]] of the 14th to 18th centuries.

==Napoleonic period ==
While before and after other titles, generally expressing precedence, where used, the title of the Head of State of the Swiss Confederation has been:
*'''Erster Landammann''' (in German)/ (in French) ''Premier Landamman'' 'First official of the country': 23 November 1801 - 6 February 1802  Aloys Reding von Biberegg (b. 1765 - d. 1818); he succeeded himself as the first under the new, shorter, non-distinctive title: 
*''Landammänner/ Landammans'': 
**6 February 1802 - 20 April 1802  Aloys Reding von Biberegg    
**20 April 1802 - 5 July 1802  Vinzenz Rüttimann (acting)  (b. 1769 - d. 1844)   
**5 July 1802 - 8 March 1803  Johann Rudolf Dolder  (b. 1753 - d. 1807) 
**August 1802 - September 1802  Aloys Reding von Biberegg (again; now in rebellion)  
*under French occupation, when emperor Napoleon I Bonaparte styled himself 'Mediator' (equivalent to his title [[protector (title)|Protector]] in the German Confederatio of the Rhine) of the Swiss (at first Helvetic) Confederation, the actual Head of the Confederation was simply the chief magistrate of the canton hosting the [[Swiss Diet]] (Helvetic confederal parliament), with the title '''Landammann der Schweiz''' (in German)/ '''Landamman de la Suisse''' (in French)/ '''Landamano della Svizzera''' (in Italian), usually for a year, 10 March 1803 - 31 December 1813

If the office is held by a woman, she is addressed as ''Frau Landammann'' (Ms. Landammann).
The French version is ''Landamman'' (plural ''Landammans''), the Italian ''Landamano'' (plural ''Landamani'')

Today, ''Landammann'' still is the title of the president of the cantonal executive in the following Swiss cantons :
*[[Aargau]] annual since 1831-32 (before: an ''[[Amtsbürgermeister]])''
* [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]]
* [[Appenzell Ausserrhoden]]
* [[Canton of Glarus|Glarus]]
* [[Nidwalden]]
* [[Obwalden]]
* [[Canton of Schwyz|Schwyz]]
* [[Canton of Solothurn|Solothurn]]
* [[Canton of Uri|Uri]]
* [[Canton of Zug|Zug]]

Some Swiss towns in those cantons use the equivalent title '''Stadtammann''' for the mayor.

==Political career==
In 2015, Southern was a candidate in the [[2015 Canadian federal election]] representing the [[Libertarian Party of Canada|Libertarian Party]] in the [[Electoral district (Canada)|district]] of [[Langley—Aldergrove]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailydot.com/lifestyle/lauren-southern-libertarian/|work=[[The Daily Dot]]|title=Meet the Canadian college student who's about to be the next enemy of the feminist movement|first=Marisa|last=Kabas|date=15 June 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150728105328/http://www.dailydot.com/lifestyle/lauren-southern-libertarian/|archivedate=28 July 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was briefly removed by the party as a candidate, but was eventually reinstated with support from [[Breitbart News]] and [[The Rebel Media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Claxton|first1=Matthew|title=Former Langley Libertarian candidate detained in Italy - Abbotsford News|url=http://www.abbynews.com/news/former-langley-libertarian-candidate-detained-in-italy/|accessdate=28 May 2017|work=Abbotsford News|date=17 May 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170517213951/http://www.abbynews.com/news/former-langley-libertarian-candidate-detained-in-italy/|archivedate=17 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The election was eventually won by [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] candidate [[Mark Warawa]].

In June 2015 while reporting on the [[Vancouver]] [[SlutWalk]] for [[Rebel Media]], Southern's cameraman was shoved and Southern's protest sign stating "There Is No Rape Culture In The West" was torn up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themarysue.com/the-triggering-is-dumb/|last=Lachenal|first=Jessica|date=9 March 2016|website=TheMarySue|access-date=3 September 2016|title=Internet Jerks Pledge to Make Internet Even Worse in #TheTriggering|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923230529/http://www.themarysue.com/the-triggering-is-dumb|archivedate=23 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jean-François Cloutier: ''[http://www.tvqc.com/2015/06/lauren-southern-troll-la-slutwalk-en-disant-il-ny-a-pas-de-culture-du-viol-en-occident Lauren Southern troll la SlutWalk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170701003911/http://www.tvqc.com/2015/06/lauren-southern-troll-la-slutwalk-en-disant-il-ny-a-pas-de-culture-du-viol-en-occident|date=1 July 2017}}'' (in French).

===Support for the targetting of NGO ships===
In May 2017, Southern took part in an attempt organized by the identitarian group ''[[Les Identitaires#G.C3.A9n.C3.A9ration Identitaire|Génération identitare]]'' to block the passage of an [[NGO]] ship, the [[Aquarius (NGO ship)|''Aquarius'']] (co-owned by SOS Mediterranée and by [[Médecins Sans Frontières|Doctors without Borders]]), which was leaving Sicily to start a search-and-rescue mission for ship-wrecked migrants off the shores of Northern Africa. Claiming that the goal of the activists "was to stop an empty boat from going down to Libya and filling up with illegal migrants", Southern was briefly detained by the [[Italian Coast Guard]]. NGO ships often rescue migrants and refugees, who disembark from Libyan shores on unsafe makeshift rafts, and bring them to Sicily.&lt;ref name="abbynews"&gt;Matthew Claxton: ''[http://www.abbynews.com/news/former-langley-libertarian-candidate-detained-in-italy  Former Langley Libertarian candidate detained in Italy] {{webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170517213951/http://www.abbynews.com/news/former-langley-libertarian-candidate-detained-in-italy|date= 17 May 2017}}.''

In: ''[[il Giornale]]'', 13 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to her actions, Southern stated that "if the politicians won't stop the boats, we'll stop the boats."&lt;ref name="Claxton2017"/&gt;

Southern supported similar actions by identitarian group [[Defend Europe]], which chartered a vessel in order to track and stop what it called collusion between NGOs and human traffickers. The group has been accused{{by whom|date= March 2018}} of intending to obstruct the rescue of migrants and refugees in distress at sea. In July 2017, Southern revealed that [[Patreon]] had deleted her account out of concerns about her "raising funds in order to take part in activities that are likely to cause loss of life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtImwK5TI4g|title= PATREON BANNED MY ACCOUNT??|last= Lauren Southern|date= 21 July 2017|publisher= YouTube|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170723023740/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtImwK5TI4g|archivedate= 23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Southern denied these allegations, stating that Defend Europe's actions were likely to save lives and that none of her funding went towards the group.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite news

===United Kingdom-related events===
In February 2018, Southern, along with Brittany Pettibone and Caolan Robertson, distributed flyers in the English town of [[Luton]]  describing Allah as "gay".&lt;ref name="BBC_Entry"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-43393035|title=Why 3 anti-Islam activists were refused entry to the UK|work=[[BBC News]]|date=14 March 2018|accessdate=3 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180318142459/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-43393035|archivedate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018, Southern, Pettibone, and Pettibone's boyfriend, [[Martin Sellner]], were all denied entry to the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Bachmann"&gt;{{cite news|title=Lutz Bachmann: Founder of far-right anti-Islam group Pegida barred from entry to UK and deported|work=[[The Independent|Independent]]|first=Maya|last=Oppenheim|date=18 March 2018|accessdate=17 April 2018|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/lutz-bachmann-pegida-detained-stansted-deported-a8262131.html|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180319180728/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/lutz-bachmann-pegida-detained-stansted-deported-a8262131.html|archivedate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Southern was also questioned under the Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000.&lt;ref name="BBC_Entry"/&gt; Her denial of entry was due to her intentions during her March visit&lt;ref name=NationalPost/&gt; and on the same grounds as Pettibone and [[Martin Sellner|Sellner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=British authorities ban three foreign right-wing activists|work=[[Reuters]]|first=Mark|last=Hosenball|date=12 March 2018|accessdate=3 April 2018|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-security-deportations/british-authorities-ban-three-foreign-right-wing-activists-idUSKCN1GO2LN|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180320082821/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-security-deportations/british-authorities-ban-three-foreign-right-wing-activists-idUSKCN1GO2LN|archivedate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She said she was "permanently banned" from the UK.&lt;ref name="nigel_farage"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-43393035|title=Why 3 anti-Islam activists were refused entry to the UK|date=2018-03-14|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-08-07|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was later confirmed she was instead refused entry for specific purposes only, and reports of her being banned were false.&lt;ref name="attention"/&gt;

===2018 Australian tour===
Shortly before a planned speaking tour of Australia in July 2018, Australia's Department of Home Affairs denied Lauren Southern an Electronic Travel Authority visa, saying it was "not a working visa".&lt;ref name="workvisa"&gt;{{cite news |title=Visa approved for Canadian who warns Australian way of life is under threat |url=https://www.sbs.com.au/news/visa-approved-for-canadian-who-warns-australian-way-of-life-is-under-threat |publisher=[[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]] |accessdate=10 July 2018 |date=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She intended to charge $79 for a basic ticket and up to $749 for an "intimate dinner".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Chung |first1=Frank |title=Australian government declines visa for right-wing activist Lauren Southern ahead of speaking tour |url=https://www.news.com.au/finance/business/media/australian-government-declines-visa-for-rightwing-activist-lauren-southern-ahead-of-speaking-tour/news-story/7b9a15a56981e4508e5305887f85c0e3 |accessdate=10 July 2018 |publisher=news.com.au |date=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian government allowed her to enter the country once she had the correct visa.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.news.com.au/finance/business/media/rightwing-activist-lauren-southerns-australian-visa-approved-after-unusually-prolonged-process/news-story/5e3611992c9edfeb2c65b9db47d901d0&lt;/ref&gt; Arriving at [[Brisbane]] airport, she was wearing an "[[It's OK to be white]]" shirt.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.smh.com.au/national/it-s-ok-to-be-white-far-right-youtuber-lauren-southern-lands-in-australia-20180714-p4zrgq.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.news.com.au/finance/business/media/rightwing-activist-lauren-southern-touches-down-in-brisbane-wearing-its-okay-to-be-white-tshirt/news-story/d750c1b70a5e969ad4190540909ac75d&lt;/ref&gt;

When she asked people on the street in [[Melbourne]] "Should we kill Lauren Southern?", many had never heard of her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=‘You’re not welcome’: Southern’s run-in with police |url=https://www.qt.com.au/news/youre-not-welcome-southerns-runin-with-sydney-poli/3478516/ |accessdate=1 August 2018 |publisher=Queensland Times |date=28 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A speaking event in Melbourne was opposed by more than 100 protestors.&lt;ref name="Melbourne_protests"&gt;{{cite news |title=Protesters disrupt Lauren Southern event in Melbourne |url=https://www.sbs.com.au/news/protesters-disrupt-lauren-southern-event-in-melbourne |publisher=[[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]] |accessdate=31 July 2018 |date=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were no protestors at her event in [[Sydney]], where ticket holders were notified of the venue by receiving a text on the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Smith |first1=Douglas |title=Far-right Canadian duo’s vile rampage against Aboriginal culture at Sydney event |url=https://www.sbs.com.au/nitv/article/2017/07/30/far-right-canadian-duos-vile-rampage-against-aboriginal-culture-sydney-event |accessdate=1 August 2018 |publisher=sbs.com.au |date=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sydney event included a $200 meet-and-greet, a $500 VIP meet-and-greet and a $750 dinner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kinsella |first1=Luke |title=What I learnt about the far right from Lauren Southern |url=https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/true-stories/what-i-learnt-about-the-far-right-from-lauren-southern/news-story/0443ce7a7a09dc8431776f469b34ae0d |accessdate=1 August 2018 |publisher=news.com.au |date=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Brisbane]], Lauren Southern supported bombing the Australian city of [[Melbourne]], quoting the [[Bible]], as a joke.&lt;ref name="not_yet_joke"/&gt; She was opposed by around 60 protesters.&lt;ref name="Brisbane_protests"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Chirgwin |first1=Sophie |title=Alt right activist Lauren Southern targeted in Brisbane |url=https://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/alt-right-activist-lauren-southern-targeted-in-brisbane/news-story/8ba241e85a0a8dbdfe95cededab53406 |accessdate=3 August 2018 |publisher=The Courier Mail |date=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2018 New Zealand tour===
In August 2018, Southern's attempted speaking tour of New Zealand was unsuccessful. [[Auckland Council]] cancelled her booking and blocked her from using its venues to "stir up ethnic or religious tensions".&lt;ref name=radionz/&gt; For agreeing with the cancellation, an MP received violent threats.&lt;ref name="Degrading_Messages_of_a_Sexual_Nature_from_Lauren_Southern_fans"&gt;{{cite news |title=Green Party co-leader Marama Davidson receives death threats |url=https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2018/07/green-party-co-leader-marama-davidson-receives-death-threats.html |accessdate=4 August 2018 |publisher=[[Newshub]] |date=8 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The subsequent booking of a private venue was revoked by its owners, one of whom said "The minute I heard who it was I cancelled".&lt;ref name="The_minute_I_heard_who_it_was_I_cancelled"/&gt; In retaliation, their venue was vandalised.&lt;ref name=vandalised/&gt;

The failure to find a venue was celebrated by around 1,000 protestors, who said the planned event had nothing to do with freedom of speech. The [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]] said Southern's views "are not those that are shared by this country".&lt;ref name="NZ_Hostile_to_Southern"/&gt;

====Auckland Council venue cancellation====
Southern and Canadian [[podcast]]er and [[List of YouTubers|YouTuber]] [[Stefan Molyneux]] were scheduled to speak in [[Auckland]] on 3 August 2018, at an [[Auckland Council]]-owned theatre. However, Auckland Live, the Council agency responsible for the theatre, cancelled the venue booking on the grounds of concerns around "the health and safety of the presenters, staff and patrons". The [[Mayor of Auckland]] [[Phil Goff]] then tweeted that Council venues should not be used to "stir up ethnic or religious tensions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Controversial Canadian speaker denied visa as Auckland agency cancels booking |first=Todd |last=Niall |url= https://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/105302179/controversial-canadian-speaker-denied-visa-as-auckland-agency-cancels-booking |newspaper=Stuff |date=6 July 2018 |accessdate=29 September 2018}} &lt;/ref&gt; He later said "we've got no obligation at all" to provide a venue for "hate speech".&lt;ref name="Degrading_Messages_of_a_Sexual_Nature_from_Lauren_Southern_fans"/&gt; In response, Southern denied assertions that her views were "hate speech" and warned about the danger of "progressivism".&lt;ref name=radionz/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mayor bans controversial Canadian pair from talking in Auckland Council venues|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=12084381|accessdate=9 July 2018|publisher=''[[New Zealand Herald]]''|date=6 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Zealand [[Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand|Deputy Prime Minister]] and Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Winston Peters]] and National Party leader [[Simon Bridges]] said they would have supported her right to speak, while [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Green Party]] co-leader [[Marama Davidson]] said she supported the ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Government divided over far right speakers |url=https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2018/07/government-divided-over-far-right-speakers.html |accessdate=20 July 2018 |publisher=[[Newshub]] |date=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=McCulloch |first1=Craig |title=Winston Peters would've let far-right activists speak |url=https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/361448/winston-peters-would-ve-let-far-right-activists-speak |accessdate=20 July 2018 |publisher=[[Radio New Zealand]] |date=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For saying so, Davidson's family was sent degrading messages of a sexual nature and death threats by supporters of Lauren Southern.&lt;ref name="Degrading_Messages_of_a_Sexual_Nature_from_Lauren_Southern_fans"/&gt; Human rights lawyer Craig Tuck criticized Mayor Goff's decision as a violation of free speech, while the cancellation of Southern and Molyneux's tour was welcomed by the [[Auckland Peace Action]] activist group and the [[Federation of Islamic Associations of New Zealand]] (FIANZ).&lt;ref name=radionz/&gt; By contrast, ''[[The Spinoff]]'' contributor Ali Shakir said that while he disagreed with many of Southern's views, he thought she and Molyneux should be welcomed to New Zealand and said that barring them damaged the country's commitment to [[freedom of expression]] and raised "serious concerns about the process." Shakir also questioned FIANZ's claim to speak for all Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Shakir |first1=Ali |title=To ban, or not to ban: an (agnostic) Muslim's view |url=https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2018/07/to-ban-or-not-to-ban-an-agnostic-muslim-s-view.html |accessdate=20 July 2018 |publisher=[[Newshub]] |date=13 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A group called the Free Speech Coalition advocated for a [[judicial review]] of the cancellation and raised NZ$50,000 in less than 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Whyte |first1=Anna |title=$50K raised for judicial review after controversial speakers banned from Auckland Council venues 37 min ago |url=https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/-50k-raised-judicial-review-after-controversial-speakers-banned-auckland-council-venues |accessdate=10 July 2018 |publisher=[[1 News]] |date=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group's supporters included former Labour Party cabinet minister [[Michael Bassett]], former National and [[ACT New Zealand|ACT]] parties leader [[Don Brash]], Property Institute chief executive Ashley Church, [[Auckland University of Technology]] historian [[Paul Moon]], broadcaster Lindsay Perrigo, political commentator [[Chris Trotter]], and [[New Zealand Taxpayers' Union]] director Jordan Williams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Truebridge |first1=Nick |last2=Niall |first2=Todd |title=Call for judicial review of Auckland Council agency's blocking of far-right speakers |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/105349668/call-for-judicial-review-of-auckland-council-agencys-blocking-of-farright-speakers |accessdate=10 July 2018 |publisher=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |date=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Visa granted====
On 20 July, [[Immigration New Zealand]] granted visas for Southern and Molyneux to visit New Zealand. While describing their views as "repugnant" and "counter to the kind and tolerant values of the vast majority of New Zealanders", [[Minister of Immigration (New Zealand)|Immigration Minister]] [[Iain Lees-Galloway]] cleared their entry on the grounds that the duo had met immigration character requirements including not having prior criminal convictions. He added that they were never banned from Australia or the United Kingdom as previously reported.&lt;ref name="Satherley"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Satherley |first1=Dan |title=Protests outside Lauren Southern speaking gig in Melbourne |url=https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2018/07/protests-outside-lauren-southern-speaking-gig-in-melbourne.html |accessdate=21 July 2018 |publisher=[[Newshub]] |date=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Southern welcomed the news and tweeted that she hoped that she and Molyneux could be "unbarred" from their venue as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bennett |first1=Lucy |title=Alt right speakers Lauren Southern and Stefan Molyneux granted entry to NZ |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=12092243 |accessdate=20 July 2018 |publisher=''[[New Zealand Herald]]'' |date=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Fonseka |first1=Dileepa |title=Lauren Southern and Stefan Molyneux have 'visas in hand' and will come to NZ, organiser says |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/105625016/Lauren-Southern-and-Stefan-Molyneux-have-visas-in-hand-and-will-come-to-NZ-organiser-says |accessdate=20 July 2018 |agency=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |publisher=Auckland Now |date=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alistair McCylmont, a leading immigration lawyer, later said there were "plenty" of grounds to stop the two coming into the country. He cited the visa cancellation of a rapper in 2014 using a law usually reserved for white supremacists, and suggested the grounds of a risk to order or the public interest. "Considering the amount of information out there in the public forum about the views held by the different people and what they've been talking, they would be plenty of grounds that could have been applied to declining visas." However, the minister took the view that denying entry would not be justified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lauren Southern, Stefan Molyneux could still have visas cancelled |url=http://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/news/national/controversial-speakers-lauren-southern-and-stefan-molyneux-could-still-be-banned-from-nz/ |accessdate=5 August 2018 |publisher=''[[Newstalk ZB]]'' |date=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Levashovo Memorial Cemetery''' ({{Lang-ru|Левашовское мемориальное кладбище}}) is a cemetery of victims of Soviet repressions during the [[Great Purge]], at [[Levashovo, Saint Petersburg]]. Since the [[NKVD]] mass graves were opened to the public in 1989, more than 22 memorials have been erected, most notably the Moloch of Totalitarianism statue by sculptors [[Nina Galitskaia]] and [[Vitali Gambarov]].&lt;ref name=map&gt;[http://visz.nlr.ru/eng/pm/levashovo/memo.html Levashovo Memorial Cemetery.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2591">'''Lukuas''' was one of the leaders of Jewish rebels during the [[Kitos War]], in the 2nd century CE. The story of Lukuas is told by [[Eusebius of Caesarea]].

==Kitos War==
In 115 large scale Jewish revolts, known as the Kitos War, erupted across the eastern parts of Roman Empire. In [[Cyrenaica]], the Jewish rebels were led by one Lukuas (or Andreas), who called himself "king" (according to Eusebius of Caesarea). His group destroyed many temples, including those to [[Hecate]], [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], [[Apollo]], [[Artemis]], and [[Isis]], as well as the civil structures that were symbols of Rome, including the [[Caesareum]], the [[basilica]], and the [[thermae|public baths]].

Lukuas then moved towards [[Alexandria]], entered and set fire to the city. Alexandria had been abandoned by the Roman troops in Egypt under the leadership of governor [[Marcus Rutilius Lupus]]. The pagan temples and the tomb of [[Pompey]] were destroyed. Trajan sent new troops under the ''praefectus praetorio'' [[Quintus Marcius Turbo]], but Egypt and Cyrenaica were pacified only in autumn 117.

In the aftermath, Lukuas fled to [[Judaea (Roman province)|Roman Judea]].&lt;ref&gt;Abulfaraj, in Münter, "Der Jüdische Krieg," p. 18, Altona and Leipsic, 1821&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marcius Turbo]] pursued him and sentenced to death the brothers Julian and Pappus, who had been key leaders in the rebellion. [[Lusius Quietus]], the conqueror of the [[History of the Jews in Iraq|Jews of Mesopotamia]], was now in command of the Roman army in Judea, and laid siege to [[Lod|Lydda]], where the rebel Jews had gathered under the leadership of Julian and Pappus. The distress became so great that the patriarch Rabban [[Gamaliel II]], who was shut up there and died soon afterwards, permitted fasting even on Ḥanukkah. Other rabbis condemned this measure.&lt;ref&gt;Ta'anit ii. 10; Yer. Ta'anit ii. 66a; Yer. Meg. i. 70d; R. H. 18b&lt;/ref&gt; Lydda was next taken and many of the Jews were executed; the "slain of Lydda" are often mentioned in words of reverential praise in the [[Talmud]].&lt;ref&gt;Pes. 50a; B. B. 10b; Eccl. R. ix. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Pappus and Julian were among those executed by the Romans in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Ta'anit 18b; Yer. Ta'anit 66b&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Natural Gas Act of 1938''' was the first occurrence of the [[United States federal government]] regulating the [[natural gas]] industry. It was focused on regulating the rates charged by interstate natural gas transmission companies. In the years prior to the passage of the Act, concern arose about the [[Monopoly|monopolistic]] tendencies of the transmission companies and the fact that they were charging higher than competitive prices. The passage of the Act gave the [[Federal Power Commission]] (FPC) control over the regulation of interstate natural gas sales. Later on, the FPC was dissolved and became the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]] (FERC). FERC continues to regulate the natural gas industry to this day.

==History of regulation==
Regulation in the natural gas market has been in place since the very beginnings of the industry.  Originally in the mid-1800s, natural gas was manufactured out of [[coal]], and delivered locally in the same area in which it was produced. Local governments saw the [[monopolistic]] tendencies of the market and began to enforce regulations. It was decided that there would be one distribution network but the rates that could be charged would be regulated by the local governments.

In the 1900s, natural gas was not only used in the locations it was produced, it began to be shipped between municipalities. Intrastate [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]] between cities began to develop and local governments no longer had the authority to regulate rates. The solution to this problem was to enlist state level [[public utilities commission]]s to oversee regulation.

In the years to follow, new technology finally allowed interstate transportation of natural gas. This brought more problems to the ease of regulation. Between the years of 1911 and 1928, states attempted to regulate many of these interstate pipelines. However, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled that state oversight of these pipelines violated the interstate commerce clause of the [[U.S. Constitution]]. This left a large gap for monopolistic business practices to occur in natural gas transmission.

In 1935, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) issued a report which voiced its concern with the market power of natural gas utilities. Congress then passed the [[Public Utility Holding Company Act]] (PUHCA) to try to limit the natural gas holding companies power. However, this act still did not cover the regulation of interstate sales.

==Natural Gas Act of 1938==
In 1938, the [[United States Congress]] passed the Natural Gas Act in order to take control of interstate natural gas transmission. This was the first time the federal government became involved in regulating rates of interstate transmission. The act gave the [[Federal Power Commission]] (FPC), a government agency, jurisdiction over regulation. It was the job of the FPC to regulate the rates that transmission companies charged. The act required that companies had to obtain a "certificate of public convenience and necessity" from the Federal Power Commission before they could make an interstate sale of natural gas.&lt;ref&gt;15 U.S.C. § 717f(c).&lt;/ref&gt; These certificates set the maximum prices natural gas could be sold for. This meant that if gas flowed from one state to another where it was sold to a gas distribution company, the sale by the pipeline to the distributor would need a certificate. However, the final sale to retail customers were exempt from the law.

Although the Natural Gas Act regulated both the transportation and sale of gas in interstate commerce, the production and gathering of gas was exempt from federal regulation. Oil companies claimed that because production and gathering was exempt, any sales that took place at the wellhead or along the gathering lines between the oil company that owned the well and the pipeline company was also exempt from Natural Gas Act regulation. The producers wanted to charge a wellhead price based on market forces, while consumer groups argued that the Natural Gas Act intended that both producers and pipelines should be limited to cost-based rate regulation, so that the final price paid by consumers would represent only the cost of producing, transporting and distributing the gas.

In ''[[Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Wisconsin]]'',&lt;ref name="Phillips"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Wisconsin |vol=347 |reporter =U.S. |opinion=672 |year=1954 |url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=case&amp;court=us&amp;vol=347&amp;page=672}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] held that the sale of natural gas at the wellhead was indeed subject to regulation under the Natural Gas Act. The case resulted in federal price controls on wellhead gas prices for the next 40 years. The act also specified that "no new interstate pipeline could be built to deliver natural gas into a market already served by another pipeline."&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naturalgas.org/regulation/history.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110705092549/http://www.naturalgas.org/regulation/history.asp |archivedate=2011-07-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942, these powers went on to cover any new transmission lines as well. Approval of the FPC was needed before a company could build an interstate transmission line. The act was passed to control the monopolistic tendencies of the market in which companies previously had the power to charge higher than competitive prices. In 1977, the FPC dissolved and the authority to regulate natural gas was transferred to the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]] (FERC).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eia.doe.gov/oil_gas/natural_gas/analysis_publications/ngmajorleg/ngact1938.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of FPC and FERC ==
In 1920, the FPC was established by congress to coordinate [[hydroelectric]] projects under federal control. Early on, the FPC was under joint administration of the Secretary of War, Interior, and Agriculture while the FPC only had an Executive Secretary. All of their other personnel was borrowed from these other departments. This mixture of leadership often resulted in conflicting mandates and made it difficult to design a consistent energy policy. To resolve this, in 1928 Congress voted the give the FPC enough funds to hire their own staff. In 1930, the [[Federal Power Act]] established a bipartisan commission to run the FPC. In 1938, the Natural Gas Act gave FPC jurisdiction over interstate natural gas pipelines and wholesale sales. In 1938, the Natural Gas Act gave FPC jurisdiction over interstate natural gas pipelines and wholesale sales. In 1942, this jurisdiction was expanded to cover the licensing of more natural gas facilities. In 1954, the Supreme Court decision in ''Phillips v. Wisconsin'' extended FPC jurisdiction over all wellhead sales of natural gas in interstate commerce.&lt;ref name="Phillips"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ferc.gov/students/whatisferc/history.htm |accessdate=April 18, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110419234516/http://www.ferc.gov/students/whatisferc/history.htm |archivedate=April 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Congress passed the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] Organization Act in 1977, which consolidated various energy-related agencies into a Department of Energy. Congress insisted that a separate independent regulatory body be retained, and the FPC was renamed the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, preserving its independent status "within" the Department. In 1978, FERC was given additional responsibilities for harmonizing the regulation of wellhead gas sales in both the intrastate and interstate markets.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/business/includes/ferc_primer.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, Congress ended federal regulation of wellhead natural gas prices. After this decision, FERC looked to increase competition in the natural gas industry.&lt;ref&gt;42 U.S.C. § 7174.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]] expanded FERC's authority to impose mandatory reliability standards on the bulk transmission system and to impose penalties on entities that manipulate the electricity and natural gas markets. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 gave FERC additional responsibilities as outlined in FERC's Top Priorities and updated Strategic Plan. As part of that responsibility, FERC:
:In 2005, the year's Energy Policy Act expanded FERC's authority to enforce reliability standards on bulk transmission systems and to impose penalties on the entities that control the electricity and natural gas markets. It also gave FERC additional responsibilities which they outline in the Top Priorities and Updated Strategic Plan. The parts of the plan that affect natural gas include that FERC:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ferc.gov/about/strat-docs/FY-09-14-strat-plan-print.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

:* Regulates the transmission and sale of natural gas for resale in interstate commerce.
:* Approves the siting of and abandonment of interstate natural gas facilities, including pipelines, storage and liquefied natural gas.
:* Uses civil penalties and other means against energy organizations and individuals who violate FERC rules in the energy markets.
:* Oversees environmental matters related to natural gas and [[hydroelectricity]] projects and major electricity policy initiatives.
:* Administers accounting and financial reporting regulations and conduct of regulated companies.

==Effects==
The Natural Gas Act of 1938 had an enormous impact on the future of not only the interstate natural gas market, but the U.S. energy policy and regulation. The natural gas industry has undergone tremendous change since 1938, and pipeline companies no longer function as resellers of gas to local distribution companies (LDCs), the ideas behind the act still impact natural gas regulation to this day. Concern about market power continues to be a key driver of natural gas regulation and monitoring of the market.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;

==Content==
In "Objectivity and Liberal Scholarship" Noam Chomsky argues that, during the [[Vietnam War]], the liberal [[intelligentsia]] provided self-serving arguments in their discussion and analysis of the war, instead of objectively discussing the topic; that they used ideology to legitimize U.S. commitments to autocratic rule and intervention in Asia. Chomsky argues that there was no [[The End of Ideology|end of ideology]], as many scholars opined, but rather that it was an elite ideology that all elites and scholars could agree upon. Chomsky argues that the conservative, moderate, and liberal intelligentsia all had an elite, counter-revolutionary, bias in their writing, but he focuses on the liberal scholars. As an additional example to the Vietnam War, Noam Chomsky looks at liberal scholarship which covered the [[Spanish Civil War]] in which the same lack of objectivity and the same counter-revolutionary subordination can be seen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Synopses &amp; Reviews:Publisher Comments|url = http://www.powells.com/biblio/1-9781565848580-2|publisher=powells.com| accessdate= 2009-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The essay consists of three parts. Part I focuses on the Vietnam War and the increasing role of intellectuals, or specialists, in government and public and foreign policy. Part II focuses on the Spanish Civil War. He contrasts the liberal-communist version of the war with that of other sources including [[anarchist]]s' and first-hand accounts. Part III is a conclusion.

'''Regional human rights regimes''' are relatively independently coherent human rights sub-regimes that are nested within the larger frame work of International human rights practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Donnelly|first=Jack|title=Universal human rights in theory and practice|year=2003|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca|isbn=978-0-8014-8776-7|pages=138|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three principal regional human rights instruments can be identified, the [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]], the [[American Convention on Human Rights]] (the Americas) and the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].

==Africa==
{{Main|Human rights in Africa}}

The [[African Union]] (AU) is a supranational union consisting of fifty-three African states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africa-union.org/root/au/memberstates/map.htm|title=AU Member States|publisher=African Union|accessdate=January 3, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105082457/http://www.africa-union.org/root/au/memberstates/map.htm|archivedate=January 5, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Established in 2001, the AU's purpose is to help secure Africa's democracy, human rights, and a sustainable economy, especially by bringing an end to intra-African conflict and creating an effective common market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africa-union.org/root/au/AboutAu/au_in_a_nutshell_en.htm|title=AU in a Nutshell|accessdate=January 3, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071230204052/http://www.africa-union.org/root/AU/AboutAu/au_in_a_nutshell_en.htm|archivedate=December 30, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]] is the region's principal human rights instrument and emerged under the aegis of the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU) (since replaced by the [[African Union]]). The intention to draw up the [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]] was announced in 1979 and the Charter was unanimously approved at the OAU's 1981 Assembly. Pursuant to its Article 63 (whereby it was to "come into force three months after the reception by the Secretary General of the instruments of ratification or adherence of a simple majority" of the OAU's member states), the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights came into effect on October 21, 1986 – in honour of which October 21 was declared "African Human Rights Day."&lt;ref&gt;[[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights]] (ACHPR) is a quasi-judicial organ of the [[African Union]] tasked with promoting and protecting human rights and collective (peoples') rights throughout the African continent as well as interpreting the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights and considering individual complaints of violations of the Charter. The Commission has three broad areas of responsibility:&lt;ref name=mandate&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.achpr.org/english/_info/mandate_en.html|title=Mandate of the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights|accessdate=January 3, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120104536/http://www.achpr.org/english/_info/mandate_en.html|archivedate=January 20, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In pursuit of these goals, the Commission is mandated to "collect documents, undertake studies and researches on African problems in the field of human and peoples, rights, organise seminars, symposia and conferences, disseminate information, encourage national and local institutions concerned with human and peoples' rights and, should the case arise, give its views or make recommendations to governments" (Charter, Art. 45).&lt;ref name=mandate/&gt;

With the creation of the [[African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights]] (under a protocol to the Charter which was adopted in 1998 and entered into force in January 2004), the Commission will have the additional task of preparing cases for submission to the Court's jurisdiction.&lt;ref name=court&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.achpr.org/english/_info/court_en.html|title=Protocol to the African Charter on human and peoples' rights on the establishment of an African court on human and peoples' rights|accessdate=January 3, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302212249/http://www.achpr.org/english/_info/court_en.html|archivedate=March 2, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a July 2004 decision, the AU Assembly resolved that the future Court on Human and Peoples' Rights would be integrated with the African Court of Justice.

The [[Organization of American States]] (OAS) is an international organization, headquartered in Washington, D.C., United States. Its members are the thirty-five independent states of the Americas. Over the course of the 1990s, with the end of the [[Cold War]], the return to democracy in Latin America{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}, and the thrust toward [[globalization]], the OAS made major efforts to reinvent itself to fit the new context. Its stated priorities now include the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oas.org/key_issues/eng/default.asp|title=OAS Key Issues|accessdate=January 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Strengthening democracy

* Combating corruption
* The rights of Indigenous Peoples
* Promoting sustainable development

The [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] (the IACHR) is an autonomous organ of the [[Organization of American States]], also based in Washington, D.C. Along with the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]], based in [[San José, Costa Rica|San José]], Costa Rica, it is one of the bodies that comprise the inter-American system for the promotion and protection of human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oas.org/documents/eng/biographies.asp?group=hhrr|publisher=Organization of American States|title=Directory of OAS Authorities|accessdate=January 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IACHR is a permanent body which meets in regular and special sessions several times a year to examine allegations of human rights violations in the hemisphere.

The Inter-American Court of Human Rights was established in 1979 with the purpose of enforcing and interpreting the provisions of the American Convention on Human Rights. Its two main functions are thus adjudicatory and advisory. Under the former, it hears and rules on the specific cases of human rights violations referred to it. Under the latter, it issues opinions on matters of legal interpretation brought to its attention by other OAS bodies or member states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corteidh.or.cr/index.cfm?CFID=25331&amp;CFTOKEN=36922058|title=Inter-American Court on Human Rights homepage|publisher=Inter-American Court on Human Rights|accessdate=January 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no Asia-wide organisations or conventions to promote or protect human rights. Countries vary widely in their approach to human rights and their record of human rights protection.

The [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf]] (CCASG) is a trade bloc involving the six Arab states of the [[Persian Gulf]], with many economic and social objectives.

The [[Asia Cooperation Dialogue]] (ACD) is a body created in 2002 to promote Asian cooperation at a continental level, helping to integrate the previously separate regional organizations of political or economical cooperation. The main objectives of the ACD are as follows:&lt;ref name=aboutACD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acddialogue.com/about/index.php|title=About the Asia Cooperation Dialogue|publisher=Asia Cooperation Dialogue|accessdate=January 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* To promote interdependence among Asian countries in all areas of cooperation by identifying Asia's common strengths and opportunities which will help reduce poverty and improve the quality of life for Asian people whilst developing a knowledge-based society within Asia and enhancing community and people empowerment;
* To expand the trade and financial market within Asia and increase the bargaining power of Asian countries in lieu of competition and, in turn, enhance Asia's economic competitiveness in the global market;
* To serve as the missing link in Asian cooperation by building upon Asia's potentials and strengths through supplementing and complementing existing cooperative frameworks so as to become a viable partner for other regions;
* To ultimately transform the Asian continent into an Asian Community, capable of interacting with the rest of the world on a more equal footing and contributing more positively towards mutual peace and prosperity.

{{Main|Human rights in Europe}}

The [[Council of Europe]], founded in 1949, is the oldest organisation working for European integration. It is an international organisation with legal personality recognised under public international law and has observer status with the United Nations. The seat of the Council of Europe is in [[Strasbourg]], France. The Council of Europe is responsible for both the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] and the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://who.int/reproductive-health/gender/index.html |title=Gender and reproductive rights home page |publisher=Who.int |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These institutions bind the Council's members to a code of human rights which, though strict, are more lenient than those of the United Nations charter on human rights.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} The Council promotes the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] and the [[European Social Charter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/T/E/Human_Rights/Esc/|title=Social Charter|publisher=Council of Europe|accessdate=January 4, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071231181123/http://www.coe.int/t/e/human_rights/esc/|archivedate=December 31, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Membership is open to all European states which seek [[European integration]], accept the principle of the [[rule of law]] and are able and willing to guarantee democracy, fundamental human rights and [[freedom (political)|freedoms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/T/e/Com/about_coe/|title=The Council of Europe in Brief |accessdate=January 4, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071215130527/http://www.coe.int/T/e/Com/about_coe/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = December 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Human rights in Oceania}}
There are no regional approaches or agreements on human rights for Oceania, but most countries have a well-regarded human rights record. However, incorporated into the 2005 [[Pacific Plan]], is the commitment to a plan of "defence and promotion of human rights" in the region. The idea of an institutionalized regional human rights framework is ongoing, with an objective to establish an ombudsman and security structures that goes beyond the [[Pacific Islands Forum]].[http://www.pacificplan.org/]&lt;ref&gt;Julia de Blaauw, Human Rights at a Crossroad?

'''Silkville''' is a [[ghost town]] in [[Williamsburg Township, Franklin County, Kansas]], United States.  Its elevation is 1,161&amp;nbsp;feet (354&amp;nbsp;m), and it is located at {{coord|38|27|0|N|95|29|21|W|type:city}} (38.4500149, -95.4891477),&lt;ref&gt;{{gnis|484824}} [[United States Geological Survey]]. Retrieved September 28, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; along [[U.S. Route 50 in Kansas|U.S. Route 50]] southwest of [[Williamsburg, Kansas|Williamsburg]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#KAG|''Kansas Atlas &amp; Gazetteer'' (2009)]], p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

The settlement was founded in the late 1800s by a Frenchman named Ernest de Boissière, who believed in [[Charles Fourier|Fourierian]] [[utopian socialism]]. Silkville was a [[sericulture]]-based settlement, and [[remuneration]] was based what each settler could produce. Silkville's silk was praised at the [[Centennial Exposition]] in [[Philadelphia]] in 1876, but loss of settlers and difficulty in selling the silk resulted in the settlements collapse. Today, only a few buildings remain.

==History==

Silkville was established in 1870 by a Frenchman named Ernest de Boissière. Born in 1810 in France to a noble family, Boissière espoused radical political opinions heavily inspired by the [[Fourierism|specific socialist philosophy]] of [[Charles Fourier]], which became anathematic when the authoritarian [[Napoleon III]] [[French coup d'état of 1851|consolidated power in 1851]]. Consequently, Boissière was forced into exile and moved to America, where he first settled in the port city of [[New Orleans]].&lt;ref name=register&gt;[[#Pankratz|Pankratz (1972)]], p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tollefson80&gt;[[#Tollefson|Tollefson (2015)]], p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; In this new city, he set up a [[shipping line]]. However, because he poured some of his money into supporting orphaned black children, he garnered heavy criticism from wealthy whites; desiring to escape the hostile opinions of his neighbors, Boissière was left with no choice but to leave the [[Southern United States|American South]].&lt;ref name=tollefson80/&gt;&lt;ref name=silk67&gt;[[#Fitzgerald|Fitzgerald (1988)]], p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; He then decided to move to [[Franklin County, Kansas]], an area he believed was well-suited to the establishment of a [[Utopia|utopic]] community. In 1869, Boissière purchased between 3000 and 3500 acres of land in the county from the Kansas Educational Association of the Methodist Episcopal Church and went about setting up his [[Commune|intentional settlement]].&lt;ref name=register/&gt;&lt;ref name=tollefson80/&gt;

[[Image:SilkvilleSchool1884.png|thumb|left|An 1884 photograph, showing students and teachers gathered at the Silkville school house.]]

After operating under myriad names, including Kansas Cooperative Farm, Prairie Home, and Valeton, Boissière's colony came to be known as Silkville, as it was intended to be a Fourierian commune that survived via [[Sericulture|silk production]].&lt;ref name=register/&gt;&lt;ref name=tour/&gt; The first building that Boissière constructed was a massive abode that others in the area referred to simply as the "Chateau".&lt;ref name=silk67/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pankratz|Pankratz (1972)]], p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; For a time the largest manor in the state, this house boasted sixty-rooms that could comfortably hold between 50{{en dash}}100 people. The building was also home to a huge library filled with 2,500 books, tomes, and other volumes.&lt;ref name=silk67/&gt; Boissière also erected a stone cocoonery and planted thousands of [[mulberry trees]] to feed his silkworms.&lt;ref name=register/&gt;&lt;ref name=tour&gt;{{cite web|last1=Richards|last2=Barker|first1=Catherine Jane|first2=Deborah|title=Southwest Franklin County|url=http://www.franklincokshistory.org/places-2/tours/southwest-franklin-county/|publisher=Franklin County Historical Society|accessdate=March 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These groves were later joined by hundreds of peach, apple and [[Ailanthus|ailanthus]] trees, as well as over a thousand grape vines.&lt;ref name=silk68&gt;[[#Fitzgerald|Fitzgerald (1988)]], p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; To educate the children of the colony, Boissière established a school that, according to author and historian Daniel Fitzgerald, was "the first in Kansas in which the instructors attempted to teach the contemporary world literature of the day".&lt;ref name=silk67/&gt;

Boissière structured his colony so that [[remuneration]] was based what each settler could produce, thereby rewarding the efficient labor of assiduous workers. Upon its founding, 40 French emigrants settled at the colony, each paying 100 dollars to be a part of the commune.&lt;ref name=register/&gt;&lt;ref name=tollefson80/&gt;&lt;ref name=silk67/&gt; In 1875, Charles Sears, a friend of Boissière's, moved to Silkville, and his arrival was a boon for the settlement's sericulture. The following year, Boissière's silk was lauded at the [[Centennial Exposition]] in [[Philadelphia]]. Despite this critical reception, Silkville struggled to make money, largely because it was competing with comparatively cheaper fabrics imported from Asia, and because Boissière refused to use cost-effective American dyes.&lt;ref name=tollefson83&gt;[[#Tollefson|Tollefson (2015)]], p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, many members left.&lt;ref name=register/&gt; (Most, when they had arrived in America, spoke only French but soon learned English and began to assimilate into mainstream society.) Many immigrants also learned that for 100 dollars{{em dash}}the amount that they had pledged to live in the settlement{{em dash}}they could buy their own land.&lt;ref name=tollefson84&gt;[[#Tollefson|Tollefson (2015)]], p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; To compensate, Boissière shifted production towards butter, cheese, and the raising of livestock. While this kept the settlement afloat for a few years, Silkville eventually collapsed and its members dispersed.&lt;ref name=nomination/&gt; Boissière returned to France in 1892 (dying two years later), and his property was given to the [[Independent Order of Odd Fellows]] for use as an orphanage. Financial reasons compelled the Order to give up the property, and after a long court battle, it passed into the hands of lawyers from Topeka. In 1916, a fire hollowed out the "Chateau", only part of which was ever reconstructed.&lt;ref name=nomination&gt;[[#Pankratz|Pankratz (1972)]], pp. 3, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=silk70&gt;[[#Fitzgerald|Fitzgerald (1988)]], p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remains==
[[Image:Silkville sign.jpg|thumb|Today, the Silkville Ranch exists upon the former settlement.]]
Today, little remains of Silkville, and only three stone structures survive: the settlement's school house, and two barns.&lt;ref name=register/&gt; The original chateau that Boissiere constructed{{em dash}}which, at the time of its construction cost US$10,000{{em dash}}was destroyed in the aforementioned fire, and a modern home was built over the west end of the ruin, utilizing some of the stone from the original.&lt;ref name=nomination2&gt;[[#Pankratz|Pankratz (1972)]], pp. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the modern day barns was once the settlement's cocoonery, although it was reduced to a one-level building after a tornado damaged the top floor.&lt;ref name=tollefson84/&gt; In 1972, these buildings were added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] because of their significance in the [[history of Kansas]].&lt;ref name=nris &gt;{{cite web|title=Silkville|url=http://focus.nps.gov/AssetDetail/NRIS/72000504|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|accessdate=September 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The aspects of the community seen as most significant historically were its nature as an [[intentional community]] and its practice of [[sericulture]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pankratz|Pankratz (1972)]], p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Socialism sidebar|Models}}
The '''socialist-oriented market economy''' ([[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]: ''Kinh tế thị trường theo định hướng xã hội chủ nghĩa'') is the official title given to the [[Economy of Vietnam|current economic system]] in the [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]]. It is described as a multi-sectoral [[market economy]] where the state sector plays a decisive role in [[Developmental state|directing economic development]], with the eventual long-term goal of developing [[Socialist mode of production|socialism]].&lt;ref name="links.org.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://links.org.au/node/14|title=Socialism and the market: China and Vietnam compared|author=Karadjis, Michael|work=|publisher=Links International Journal for Socialist Renewal|accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The socialist-oriented market economy is a product of the [[Đổi Mới]] economic reforms which led to the replacement of the [[centrally-planned economy]] with a market-based [[mixed economy]] based on state-owned industry. These reforms were undertaken to allow Vietnam to integrate with the global market economy.

== Reforms leading to establishment ==
The Đổi Mới economic reforms were initiated by the [[Communist Party of Vietnam]] in 1986 during the party's [[6th National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam|6th National Congress]]. These reforms allowed for private ownership of small enterprises alongside state-run and collectively-owned enterprises. Additionally, these reforms also introduced a greater role for market forces for coordinating economic activity between enterprises and government agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tapchicongsan.org.vn/details_e.asp?Object=29152838&amp;News_ID=18459436|title=Consistently pursuing the socialist orientation in developing the market economy in Vietnam|author=|work=|publisher=Communist Review|accessdate=20 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510005305/http://www.tapchicongsan.org.vn/details_e.asp?Object=29152838&amp;News_ID=18459436|archivedate=10 May 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economic reforms aimed to restructure the Vietnamese economy away from [[Soviet-type economic planning|Soviet-type central planning]] and towards a mixed economy intended to be a transitional phase in the development of a [[socialist economy]].&lt;ref name=vnturmoil&gt;Napier, Nancy K.; Vuong, Quan Hoang (2013). [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0985530588/ ''What We See, Why We Worry, Why We Hope: Vietnam Going Forward]''. Boise, Idaho: Boise State University CCI Press. {{ISBN|978-0985530587}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of this economic system is to improve the [[productive forces]] of the economy, developing a firm technical-material base for the foundation of socialism, and to enable Vietnam to better integrate with the world economy.&lt;ref name="vietnamembassy-usa.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vietnamembassy-usa.org/news/story.php?d=20031117235404|title=Socialist-oriented market economy: concept and development|author=|work=|publisher=Embassy of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam|accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The socialist-oriented market economy is a multi-sectoral [[commodity]] economy regulated by the market, consisting of a mixture of private, collective and state ownership of the means of production. However, the state sector and collectively-owned enterprises form the backbone of the economy. It is similar to the Chinese [[socialist market economy]] in that many forms of ownership, including cooperative/collective enterprises, communal, private and state ownership models co-exist in the economy, but the state sector plays a decisive role.&lt;ref name="vietnamembassy-usa.org"/&gt;

=== Compared with the Chinese model ===
In contrast to the Chinese model (dubbed the socialist market economy), the Vietnamese system is not officially viewed as a form of [[socialism]] or even [[market socialism]] and it is instead considered to be a multi-sectoral market economy that is in the process of undergoing a long-term transition towards socialism, with the view that socialism can only emerge once Vietnam's [[productive forces]] are developed to a point where socialism becomes a technical possibility.&lt;ref name="links.org.au"/&gt;

The socialist-oriented market economy has aroused less controversy than the Chinese model within its perspective government because private business plays a smaller role in the Vietnamese model, with most of the means of production remaining firmly under either collective or state ownership and administration.&lt;ref&gt;Pham, Minh-Chinh; Vuong, Quan-Hoang (2009). [https://books.google.com/books?id=1Wxg3gafpJ4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''Kinh te Viet Nam - Thang Tram va Dot Pha, NXB Chinh Tri Quoc Gia, Hanoi, Vietnam''].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vuong, Quan-Hoang (2007). [https://books.google.com/books?id=El4zVl36thsC&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''Van Minh Lam Giau va Nguon Goc Cua Cai, NXB Chinh Tri Quoc Gian, Hanoi, Vietnam''].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theoretical basis ==
The Communist Party of Vietnam maintains that the socialist-oriented market economy is consistent with the [[Marxism|Marxist]] view of economic development, being a key step in achieving economic growth and modernization while being able to co-exist in the modern [[Globalization|global market economy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.vista.gov.vn/english/st_documents_abstract/200502173672813586/200607024871565598/200607021500783644/200607021602963868/ "The awareness of the socialist-oriented market economy in Vietnam"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120714192732/http://english.vista.gov.vn/english/st_documents_abstract/200502173672813586/200607024871565598/200607021500783644/200607021602963868/|date=14 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Communist Party of Vietnam has re-affirmed its commitment to the development of a socialist economy with its Đổi Mới reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpv.org.vn/cpv/Modules/News/NewsDetail.aspx?co_id=30107&amp;cn_id=144322|title=Firmly holding to the socialist orientation|accessdate=10 January 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929020443/http://www.cpv.org.vn/cpv/Modules/News/NewsDetail.aspx?co_id=30107&amp;cn_id=144322|archivedate=29 September 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This economic model is defended from a Marxist perspective, which states that a planned socialist economy can only emerge after first developing the basis for socialism through the establishment of a market economy and commodity-exchange economy and that socialism will only emerge after this stage has exhausted its historical necessity and gradually transforms itself into socialism.&lt;ref&gt;Zhongqiao, Duan. [https://docs.google.com/gview?a=v&amp;q=cache:tWl8XGM_vQAJ:www.nodo50.org/cubasigloXXI/congreso06/conf3_zhonquiao.pdf+Socialist+planned+commodity+economy&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us ''Market Economy and Socialist Road''].&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of this model argue that the [[Economy of the Soviet Union|economic system]] of the [[Soviet Union]] and its [[Eastern Bloc|satellite states]] attempted to go from a natural economy to a planned economy by decree without passing through the necessary market economy phase of development.&lt;ref name=vn&gt;Vuong, Quan-Hoang (2010). [https://www.amazon.com/dp/3639233832 ''Financial Markets in Vietnam's Transition Economy: Facts, Insights, Implications'']. Saarbrücken, Germany: [[VDM Publishing|VDM Verlag]]. {{ISBN|978-3-639-23383-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of socialist market economies distinguish themselves from market socialists with the view of market socialism that markets are a central feature of socialism and that markets are the most feasible mechanism for a socialist economy.&lt;ref&gt;Zhongqiao, Duan. [http://bibliotecavirtual.clacso.org.ar/ar/libros/cuba/if/marx/documentos/22/Market%20Economy%20and%20Socialist%20Road.pdf ''Market Economy and Socialist Road''] (PDF).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Soul City entrance.jpg|thumb|right|Sign along Highway 158 marking the entrance to Soul City]]
'''Soul City, North Carolina''' was a [[planned community]] first proposed in 1969 by [[Floyd McKissick]],&lt;ref name="two"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northcarolinahistory.org/encyclopedia/462/entry/ |title=North Carolina History Project : Soul City |publisher=Northcarolinahistory.org |date= |accessdate=2015-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[civil rights]] leader and director of the [[Congress of Racial Equality]]. Funded by the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]], (HUD) as one of  thirteen model city projects under the [[Urban Growth and New Community Development Act]], it was located on {{convert|5000|acre|km2}} in [[Warren County, North Carolina|Warren County]] near Manson-Axtell Road and Soul City Boulevard in [[Norlina, North Carolina]], 27563.{{cn|date=November 2018}} According to McKissick, "Soul City was an idea before the movement. Soul City actually started after World War II, in my mind. And it was first talked about when we saw the use of the Marshall Plan, and all like that. See, I've always been in real estate and I've always been a businessman."&lt;ref&gt;"Documenting the American South: Oral Histories of the American South." Interview by Jack Bass and [[Walter DeVries]]. Documenting the American South: Oral Histories of the American South. University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 6 Dec. 1973. Web. 06 Mar. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docsouth.unc.edu/sohp/playback.html?base_file=A-0134 |title=Documenting the American South: Oral Histories of the American South |publisher=Docsouth.unc.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soul City was intended to be a new town built from the ground up and open to all races, but placed emphasis on providing opportunities for minorities and the poor.&lt;ref name="two"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schultz, Will. "Soul City." North Carolina History Project :. North Carolina History, n.d. Web. 09 Mar. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also designed to as a means of reversing out-migration of  minorities and the poor to urban areas; the opportunities Soul City provided, such as jobs, education, housing, training, and other social services would help lessen the migration.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;McKissick, Floyd B. Soul City North Carolina. Soul City, NC, 1974. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The city was planned to contain three villages housing 18,000 people by 1989.  Soul City was projected to have 24,000 jobs and 44,000 inhabitants by 2004.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt; It was intended to include industry and retail development for jobs, as well as residential housing and services. The plan was for residents to work, get schooling, shop, receive health care, and worship in town. Soul City was the first new town to be organized by African-American businesses. McKissick envisioned Soul City as a community where all races could live in harmony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bey|first1=Lee|title=Story of cities #41: Soul City's failed bid to build a black-run suburbia for America|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/may/12/story-cities-soul-city-floyd-mckissick-north-carolina-black-run-suburbia|website=The Guardian|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, the city received a grant of $14 million from HUD based on plans of attracting industry as well as developing residential housing. By 1975, the city had few homes and only one industrial building, "Soultech 1".

The city failed to reach its initial ambitions. Lawsuits and investigations into the use of funds by the Soul City Company, the city's developers, resulted in foreclosure in 1979 despite eventually being cleared by a Government Accountability Office audit. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/products/RED-76-52 |title=Information on the New Community of Soul City, North Carolina |publisher=www.gao.gov |date=1975-12-18 |accessdate=2015-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, 35 housing units, a clinic, a tennis court, and a pool had been developed. About 150 people were employed in the city.

Since that time, the city has grown somewhat, but not to the size originally planned. The former Soultech 1 building was purchased by the adjoining Warren County Correctional Institution for expansion. A number of new homes have been constructed.

Representative [[Eva Clayton]] lived in and worked for Soul City Company before being appointed to a state position in community development, and later being elected to the  [[United States Congress]].

The '''Terrorism Suppression Act 2002''' is [[New Zealand]] [[counter-terrorism]] legislation passed under the [[Helen Clark|Clark]]-led [[Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand|Labour government]]. Enacted following the [[September 11 attacks]], the Act was designed to better address contemporary [[terrorism]] issues, both domestically and abroad. As of April 2015, the Act has not been formally used in prosecution; however there have been several failed attempts by [[the Crown]] to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Hamed v R [2012] 2 NZLR 305.&lt;/ref&gt; Many individuals and organisations have however been designated as "Terrorist entities" under the Act's provisions, in line with [[UN Security Council]] designations.&lt;ref&gt;"Lists associated with Resolution 1337" (20 July 2014) NZ Police http://www.police.govt.nz/advice/personal-community/counterterrorism/designated-entities/lists-associated-with-resolution-1373.&lt;/ref&gt; The Act was amended in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Terrorism Suppression Amendment Act 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{Further|Terrorism in New Zealand}}
{{Terrorism in New Zealand}}

New Zealand, considered a relatively 'safe' country, has experienced few terrorist incidents in its short history. Prior to 2001, incidents included the bombings of the [[Huntly, New Zealand|Huntly]] rail bridge in 1951, the [[Whanganui]] Computer Centre in 1982, the [[Wellington]] Trades Hall in 1984 and the [[Greenpeace]] vessel ''[[Sinking of the Rainbow Warrior|The Rainbow Warrior]]'' in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;B.K. Greener-Barcham "Before September: A History of Counter-terrorism in New Zealand" (2002) Australian Journal of Political Science at 510-514.&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to the popular association between [[terrorism]] and [[insurgency]], the latter two of the four were perpetrated by state or state-aligned actors, as noted by Omar Hamed.&lt;ref&gt;''Operation 8'' (2011) Directed by Abi King-Jones and Errol Wright [Film] New Zealand: Cutcutcut films.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to these incidents, [[New Zealand]] had already established prior to this act, "A comprehensive legislative and substantive counter-terrorist framework..."&lt;ref&gt;B.K. Greener-Barcham "Before September: A History of Counter-terrorism in New Zealand" (2002) Australian Journal of Political Science at 514.&lt;/ref&gt; However the growth of international [[terrorism]] in recent years, alluded to by then [[Foreign Minister|Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade]] [[Phil Goff]] in the bill's first reading, gave rise to the need to introduce new, "comprehensive" anti-terror legislation.&lt;ref&gt;(3 May 2001) 591 NZPD 9001.&lt;/ref&gt; The examples he gave were the [[Lockerbie bombing]], the [[World Trade Centre bombing]] and the [[1998 United States embassy bombings|Nairobi embassy attack.]]&lt;ref&gt;(3 May 2001) 591 NZPD 9001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Passage==

===Introduction===

[[Phil Goff|Goff]] introduced the Terrorism (bombings and financing) bill to [[New Zealand Parliament|parliament]] on 3 May 2001.&lt;ref&gt;(3 May 2001) 591 NZPD 9001.&lt;/ref&gt; Seen by many as simply the enactment of two recent international conventions, the bill was considered unremarkable and garnered widespread lukewarm support.&lt;ref&gt;New Zealand Council for Civil Liberties "Submission to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee on the Terrorism (Bombing and Financing) Bill 2001."&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was then sent to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade [[select committee]] for review and submissions.

The day of the attacks, a special ministerial statement session was held at the beginning of [[New Zealand Parliament|parliament]], in which [[Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand|Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Jim Anderton]], amongst others, gave their condolences for those killed, with Anderton moving a motion to express New Zealand's "shock and horror" at the events.&lt;ref&gt;(12 September 2001) 595 NZPD 11614.&lt;/ref&gt; What followed was a dramatic shift in pace at the [[select committee]] level, with many submitters feeling that they did not have enough time to review and make submissions on the increasing amendments that the committee was making in the wake of the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;New Zealand Council for Civil Liberties "Submission to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee on the Terrorism (Bombing and Financing) Bill 2001."&lt;/ref&gt;
Proponents of the bill claimed that this urgency was a matter of necessity given the threat posed by terrorism, however opponents claimed that this legislative process eroded the public's right to proper consultation. For instance in its submission on the bill the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]] (Aotearoa), an organisation with consultative status with the [[United Nations]], claimed to be, "dismayed at the extremely short length of time" and did not, "consider such a time period to be sufficient for...such a complex, and extreme, piece of legislation."&lt;ref&gt;Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (Aotearoa) "Submission to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee on the Terrorism (Bombing and Financing) Bill 2001."&lt;/ref&gt; This was echoed in the submission by the [[Human Rights Commission]], stating that, "There has been limited opportunity for public discussion and preparation of submissions."&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Commission "Submission to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee on the Terrorism (Bombing and Financing) Bill 2001."&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the [[New Zealand government]], following several other governments around the world, broadened its own powers in the bill. Greener-Barcham claims that this was in order, "To be part of a broader anti-terrorist effort" and to, "Strengthen ties with 'like-minded states'" following the [[September 11 attacks]] and [[George W. Bush|President Bush]]'s call to arms.&lt;ref&gt;B.K. Greener-Barcham "Before September: A History of Counter-terrorism in New Zealand" (2002) Australian Journal of Political Science at 514.&lt;/ref&gt; This shift in mentality was reflected in the bill's renaming from the Terrorism (Bombing and Financing) bill to the Terrorism Suppression bill.

===Final readings and royal assent===

Due to the alterations made in the [[select committee]] stage, the bill became hotly debated during the committee of the whole house. For example, [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Green Party]] [[Member of Parliament]] [[Keith Locke]] proposed (unsuccessfully) an amendment which would have changed the bill's name to the, "Civil Liberties Reduction" bill.&lt;ref&gt;(08 October 2002) 603 NZPD 1090.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite strong dissent from the Green Party, the bill passed its third reading on 8 October 2002 with multi-party support and 106 votes in favour, with only the 9 Green votes against.&lt;ref&gt;(08 October 2002) 603 NZPD 1148.&lt;/ref&gt; The bill received [[royal assent]] and became an act on 17 October 2002.

==Content of Act==

===Part 1===
Part 1, "Preliminary Provisions," deals with the purpose of the act and its interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Terrorism Suppression Act 2002, ss1-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part 2===
Part 2, "Suppression of Terrorism," forms the substantive part of the act's offences.&lt;ref&gt;Terrorism Suppression Act 2002, ss6A-61.&lt;/ref&gt; It also deals with some of the other most significant aspects of the act, the designation of terrorist entities, organisations and individuals, in sections 20-42. It creates the offences of:
*Section 7: terrorist bombing
*Section 8: financing terrorism
*Section 9: dealing with terrorist property
*Section 10: making property available to a terrorist entity
*Section 12: recruiting members for terrorist groups
*Section 13: participating in a terrorist group
*Section 13A-D: harbouring terrorists, using plastic explosives, protecting or acquiring radioactive materials

===Part 3===
Part 3, "Miscellaneous provisions," deals primarily with the obligations on the [[New Zealand]] [[attorney general]].&lt;ref&gt;Terrorism Suppression Act 2002, ss62-81.&lt;/ref&gt; These include to:
*Section 64: Indicate if New Zealand will exercise jurisdiction under the act
*Section 65: Give notification if an individual is taken into custody under the act
*Section 67: Give permission for prosecutions under the act
*Section 68: Communicate the outcome of any such prosecution

The penalties within the act are severe, with most offences carrying either 14 years or life imprisonment (the harshest penalty available in [[New Zealand]]).&lt;ref&gt;Terrorism Suppression Act 2002, ss6A-61.&lt;/ref&gt;

==2007 New Zealand police raids==
{{See also|2007 New Zealand police raids}}

In October 2007, the [[NZ Police]] carried out several raids across [[New Zealand]] and arrested 17 individuals, charging them under the Terror Suppression Act for involvement in so-called "military style training camps."&lt;ref&gt;Hamed v R [2012] 2 NZLR 305.&lt;/ref&gt; For the prosecutions to go ahead the [[attorney general]]'s consent under section 67 of the act was required. Under delegated authority from then [[Attorney General]] [[Michael Cullen (politician)|Michael Cullen]], then [[solicitor general]] [[David Collins (judge)|David Collins]] announced on 8 November 2007 that he was:

{{quote|...Unable to authorise the prosecutions that have been sought under the Terrorism Suppression Act. There is insufficient evidence to establish to the very high standard required that a group or entity was planning or preparing to commit a terrorist act, as that term is defined in the legislation.&lt;ref&gt;David Collins, Solicitor General of New Zealand "Press Release regarding prosecutions under Terrorism Suppression Act|Wellington, New Zealand, 08 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As a result of this decision, the charges under the act were dropped as were any form of prosecution of the vast majority of those arrested. Only [[firearm]]s charges against four of the accused were eventually successful.&lt;ref&gt;Hamed v R [2012] 2 NZLR 305.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of [[David Collins (judge)|Collin's]] criticism that the act was, "Unnecessarily complex" and, "Incoherent" he recommended the act be sent to the [[New Zealand Law Commission|law commission]] for review.&lt;ref&gt;David Collins, Solicitor General of New Zealand "Press Release regarding prosecutions under Terrorism Suppression Act" (Wellington, New Zealand, 08 November 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amendment Act 2007==

Following the [[2007 New Zealand police raids|2007 raids]], the government introduced a major overhaul of the act (an amendment bill was already before parliament). The amendment was to correct inconsistencies with [[UN]] and [[UN Security Council]] requirements and replace the role of the [[High Court of New Zealand|High Court]] in extending terrorist designations with the [[prime minister of New Zealand|prime minister]].&lt;ref&gt;Terrorism Suppression Amendment Bill 2007 (explanatory note).&lt;/ref&gt; It also introduced new "nuclear material" provisions.&lt;ref&gt;Terrorism Suppression Amendment Bill 2007, s14.&lt;/ref&gt; Of most significance was the amendment's redefining of several of the offences in the act:
*Section 12 (recruiting members of a terrorist group) now simply required a designated terrorist entity (DTE)&lt;ref&gt;Terrorism Suppression Amendment Bill 2007, s11.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Section 13 (participating in a terrorist group) introduced a recklessness component alongside knowledge, as well as only requiring a DTE&lt;ref&gt;Terrorism Suppression Amendment Bill 2007, s12.&lt;/ref&gt;
In doing so, the threshold to commit either offence was considerably lowered, in large part to correct the issues highlighted by the [[solicitor general]]. The Terrorism Suppression Amendment Act 2007 came into force on 19 November 2007.

==Criticism==

The Act as a whole has been criticised by some as placing too much power in the hands of the [[Executive (government)|executive]]. Whereas the court formerly made findings of fact, in regards to the designation of terrorist entities the responsibility has been given to the [[prime minister of New Zealand|prime minister]]. Such a designation carries with it strict penalties under the act in terms of association and membership. Some have claimed that this may lead to the act being used politically to quell dissidents rather than actual terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron Walker "The Terrorism Suppression Act" (1 April 2014) New Zealand Human Rights Blog http://nzhumanrightsblog.com/uncategorized/the-terrorism-suppression-act-and-criminalisation-of-national-liberation-groups/.&lt;/ref&gt; Human rights groups have also raised concerns over whether convictions based on a wrongful designation will nevertheless remain upheld.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron Walker "The Terrorism Suppression Act" (1 April 2014) New Zealand Human Rights Blog http://nzhumanrightsblog.com/uncategorized/the-terrorism-suppression-act-and-criminalisation-of-national-liberation-groups/.&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent periodic review of the act (in line with the review regime within the act) was cancelled in 2013 by then [[Minister of Justice (New Zealand)|Justice Minister]] [[Judith Collins]]. [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Green Party]] co-leader [[Russel Norman]] claims this is because the government "is unwilling to risk further public scrutiny of the state's search and surveillance powers."&lt;ref&gt;Adam Dudding "Review of terror laws stopped" (15 September 2013) Stuff http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/9166763/Review-of-terror-laws-stopped.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''TheBlaze''' is an [[American conservative]] news and entertainment network available on [[television network|television]], [[News broadcasting|radio]], and the [[Internet]] that was founded by [[talk radio]] personality [[Glenn Beck]], based in [[Irving, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;Matt DeLong, [http://voices.washingtonpost.com/44/2010/08/glenn-beck-launches-conservati.html Glenn Beck launches conservative news site The Blaze], ''Washington Post'' ( August 31, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sydney Ember, [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/08/business/media/sinclair-bid-to-acquire-tribune-media-draws-opposition.html Sinclair Deal Draws Unlikely Opponent: Conservative News Media], ''New York Times'' (August 8, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; TheBlaze has studios and offices based in the [[Las Colinas]] urban district in [[Irving, Texas|Irving]] and [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]].

The network is available on regional cable providers throughout the United States, on [[Verizon Fios]] channel 112, on [[Dish Network]] channel 212, on the [[Roku Device]], on [[Sling TV]], and is available internationally on its own [[online streaming]] service. The live audio stream is available on [[iHeartRadio]] and both the audio stream and live television stream are available on TheBlaze app, which is on the [[iPhone]] and on [[Android (operating system)|Android]] through [[Google Play]].

As of October 1, 2014, TheBlaze was available on 77 television providers, with eleven of those being in the top 25 nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/news/suddenlink-launches-glenn-becks-theblaze-after-removing-viacom-outlets-1201318377/|title=Suddenlink Launches Glenn Beck's TheBlaze After Removing Viacom Outlets|first=Brian|last=Steinberg|work=Variety|accessdate=July 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:MRA2GlennBeck.png|thumb|450px|right|Mercury Radio Arts serves as the production and operating company over the TheBlaze's outlets]]
[[File:The Mercury Studios Building, long known as The Studios of Las Colinas, in Irving, Texas LCCN2015630717.tif|thumb|320px|The Mercury Studios Building, which houses the main studios and offices for Mercury Radio Arts]]
Beck spawned [[Mercury Radio Arts]] in 2002, naming it after the [[Orson Welles]] seminal [[Mercury Theatre]], which produced live theatrical broadcasts during the 1930s. The company produces all of Beck's productions, including his [[Glenn Beck Radio Program|eponymous radio show]], books, and live [[stage show]]s, and his official website.&lt;ref name="beingglenn"&gt;{{cite news|work= [[New York Times Magazine]]|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/03/magazine/03beck-t.html?_r=3&amp;hp=&amp;pagewanted=all|title = Being Glenn Beck|date = September 29, 2010|first = Mark|last = Leibovich}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = https://blogs.forbes.com/laceyrose/2010/08/30/glenn-becks-35-million-empire-adds-a-news-site/|work = Forbes Blogs: Moneywood|first = Lacey|last = Rose|date = August 30, 2010|title = Glenn Beck's $35 Million Empire Adds A News Site}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 31, 2010, three days after his [[Restoring Honor rally]] at the [[Lincoln Memorial]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], Beck launched the ''TheBlaze'' website, describing it as an [[alternative media|alternative]] to "mainstream media outlets", which he said are "distorting facts to fit rigid agendas," he said ''TheBlaze'' will feature "breaking news, original reporting, insightful opinions, and engaging videos about the stories that matter most" and that "we will examine our culture, deal with matters of faith and family, and we won't be afraid of a history lesson."&lt;ref name="politicoblaze"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0810/41616.html|title=Glenn Beck launches news site|publisher=POLITICO|first=Andy|last=Barr|date=August 31, 2010|accessdate=August 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site was reportedly modeled after ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', and has been compared accordingly by Matt DeLong of the ''Washington Post'' and Steve Krakauer of ''[[Mediaite]]''.&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.forbes.com/laceyrose/2010/08/30/glenn-becks-35-million-empire-adds-a-news-site/?boxes=businesschannelsections|title=Glenn Beck's $35 Million Empire Adds A News Site|first=Lacey|last=Rose|publisher=Forbes|date=August 31, 2010|accessdate=August 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beck announced the creation of an online-only network that would replace Insider Extreme as a result of his Fox News departure on June 7, 2011. On September 12, 2011, Beck launched GBTV (Glenn Beck TV) as an exclusive [[internet streaming]] network, produced and operated by Mercury Radio Arts. GBTV would air a television adaptation of his [[Glenn Beck Radio Program|radio show]], his [[Glenn Beck Program|television show]], and other original programming, including ''[[Real News|Real News from TheBlaze]]'', a nightly news program hosted by former [[CNN]] personality [[Amy Holmes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher = Huffington Post|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/09/amy-holmes-joins-glenn-be_n_922739.html|title = Amy Holmes Joins Glenn Beck's GBTV Network As Anchor|date = August 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 18, 2012, Mercury Radio Arts announced the consolidation of all of its outlets under the "TheBlaze" brand, thus renaming the internet television station from GBTV to TheBlaze.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/06/18/showbiz/glenn-beck-web-tv-network/index.html |title=Glenn Beck drops his name from Web network, promises media 'revolution' – CNN.com |publisher=CNN |date=June 18, 2012 |accessdate=September 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[Dish Network]] placed TheBlaze on its channel lineup. As a result of the "Get TheBlaze" campaign (a movement led by supporters to have other supporters call their cable or satellite television provider and ask them to carry the channel), several smaller, regional cable operators also have recently picked up TheBlaze—including [[Cablevision]] (also known as Optimum TV – Channel 828), a major cable provider in the [[New York metropolitan area]].&lt;ref name="morecableoperators"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/03/28/theblaze-tv-launching-on-4-more-cable-operators|title=TheBlaze TV Launching on 4 More Cable Operators|publisher=TheBlaze|first=Madeleine|last=Morgenstern|date=March 28, 2013|accessdate=March 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="extendsreach"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/05/01/theblaze-extends-its-reach-announces-tv-deal-with-tri-state-cable-provider|title=TheBlaze Extends Its Reach, Announces TV Deal with Tri State Cable Provider|publisher=TheBlaze|first=Becket|last=Adams|date=May 1, 2013|accessdate=May 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Betsy Morgan was named CEO of ''TheBlaze'' on December 9, 2014, replacing Chris Balfe, who had been CEO since the beginning. Morgan left the company on in June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/betsy-morgan-ceo-of-glenn-becks-the-blaze-steps-down/265312|title=Betsy Morgan, CEO of Glenn Beck's The Blaze, Steps Down|website=www.adweek.com|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chief Revenue Officer Kraig Kitchin replaced Morgan until he resigned in January 2016, taking the position of Interim Head of Sales and being replaced by Stewart Padveen, a digital startup entrepreneur, who resigned in February 2017, after completing a successful turnaround year at TheBlaze, launching a new OTT &amp; CMS platform, innovative new monetization opportunities, highly popular new digital content, expanded distribution, and doubling TheBlaze's audience size. Beck took over as CEO of the company in May 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/GlennBeck/photos/a.130102203187.105634.36400348187/10155526557303188/?type=3&amp;theater|title=Glenn Beck New Blaze CEO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Monday, November 2, 2015, Beck sent an open letter to the [[Republican National Convention]], requesting permission for TheBlaze to host the ninth and final Republican presidential debate; this offer was not accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politicususa.com/2015/11/03/glenn-beck-host-gop-debate-bill-oreilly-hopes.html|title=Glenn Beck Wants to Host a GOP Debate and Bill O'Reilly Hopes They Let Him %%|date=2015-11-03|work=Politicus USA|access-date=2018-01-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uspresidentialelectionnews.com/2016-debate-schedule/2016-republican-primary-debate-schedule/|title=Republican Debate Schedule (2016 Primary Debates)|first=Election|last=Central|date=October 14, 2014|publisher=|accessdate=June 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 31, 2017, TheBlaze laid off nearly 60 employees, which cut its personnel by almost 30%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=09.01.17 12:00 AM ET |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/after-mass-layoffs-can-glenn-beck-still-save-the-blaze |title=After Mass Layoffs, Can Glenn Beck Still Save ‘The Blaze’? |publisher=Thedailybeast.com |date= |accessdate=2017-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 20, 2018, TheBlaze website announced that it would be shutting down the comments section of its website effective 6/24/18 citing that; over the past several years, most of the discussion about its stories had moved to social media and that they wanted to better focus on engaging with their readers on Facebook and Twitter.&lt;ref&gt;theblaze.com&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 24, 2018, Midnight (EST) TheBlaze's comment section went offline.

On December 1st, 2018, Mercury Radio Arts acquired CRTV, which brought personalities such as [[Mark Levin]], [[Steven Crowder]], [[Gavin McInnes]], Allie Stuckey, [[Phil Robertson]], and [[Michelle Malkin]] to their lineup.

TheBlaze website launched on August 26, 2010. According to Beck, the site took two months to design.&lt;ref name="politicoblaze"/&gt; At launch, the site's chief editor was [[Scott Baker (journalist)|Scott Baker]], with its associate editor-video producer Pam Key and with Jon Seidl and Meredith Jessup as reporters.

[[File:Vishaka.pdf|thumb|In 1997, the Supreme Court laid down guidelines in the Vishaka case, pending formal legislation, for dealing with [[sexual harassment]] of women at the workplace. This is the judgement of the Supreme Court of India]]

'''''Vishakha and others v State of Rajasthan''''' was a 1997 [[Indian Supreme Court]] case where Vishakha and other women groups filed [[Public Interest Litigation]] (PIL) against State of [[Rajasthan]] and [[Union of India]] to enforce the fundamental rights of working women under Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution of India. The petition was filed after [[Bhanwari Devi]], a social worker in [[Rajasthan]] was brutally gang raped for stopping a [[child marriage]].&lt;ref name="indianexpress.com"&gt;http://www.indianexpress.com/news/sexualharassmentatworkplace/571636/&lt;/ref&gt;

The court decided that the consideration of "International Conventions and norms are significant for the purpose of interpretation of the guarantee of gender equality, right to work with human dignity in Articles 14, 15, 19(1)(g) and 21 of the Constitution and the safeguards against [[sexual harassment]] implicit therein." The petition, resulted in what are popularly known as the [[Vishaka Guidelines]]. The judgment of August 1997 given by a bench of [[J. S. Verma]] (then C.J.I)., [[Sujata Manohar]] and [[B. N. Kirpal]], provided the basic definitions of [[sexual harassment]] at the workplace and provided guidelines to deal with it. It is seen as a significant legal victory for women's groups in India.&lt;ref name="indianexpress.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1031794/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iiap.res.in/files/VisakaVsRajasthan_1997.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

In India, before 1997, there were no formal guidelines for how an incident involving sexual harassment at workplace should be dealt by an employer. Women experiencing sexual harassment at workplace had to lodge a complaint under Section 354 of the Indian Penal Code that deals with the 'criminal assault of women to outrage women's modesty' and Section 509 that punishes an individual or individuals for using a 'word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman'. These sections left the interpretation of 'outraging women's modesty' to the discretion of the police officer.&lt;ref name="dnaindia.com"&gt;http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-explained-vishakha-judgment-on-sexual-harassment-at-workplace-1923309&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bhanwari Devi==

In 1992 [[Bhanwari Devi]] a social worker in [[Rajasthan]] was brutally gang raped by a number of upper caste men, because she had tried to stop a child marriage. Bhanwari Devi was determined to get justice and lodged a case against the offenders. However, the accused was acquitted by a trial court. This appalling injustice, together with the fighting spirit of Bhanwari Devi, inspired several women’s groups and NGOs to file a petition in the Supreme Court under the collective platform of Vishakha.

&lt;ref name="dnaindia.com"/&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lawisgreek.com/indian-laws-for-women-the-historic-case-of-vishakha-versus-state-of-rajasthan&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

The court decided that the consideration of "International Conventions and norms are significant for the purpose of interpretation of the guarantee of gender equality, right to work with human dignity in Articles 14, 15 19(1)(g) and 21 of the Constitution and the safeguards against [[sexual harassment]] implicit therein." Supreme Court of India defined sexual harassment and set guidelines for employers.

== What is sexual harassment ==

Sexual harassment includes such unwelcome sexually determined behaviour (whether directly or by implication) as:

a) physical contact and advances;
b) a demand or request for sexual favours;
c) sexually coloured remarks;
d) showing pornography;
e) any other unwelcome physical verbal or non-verbal conduct of sexual NATURE

Where any of these acts is committed in circumstances where under the victim of such conduct has a reasonable apprehension that in relation to the victim’s employment or work whether she is drawing salary, or honorarium or voluntary, whether in government, public or private enterprise such conduct can be humiliating and may constitute a health and safety problem.

It is discriminatory for instance when the woman has reasonable grounds to believe that her objection would disadvantage her in connection with her employment or work including recruiting or promotion or when it creates a hostile work environment. Thus, sexual harassment need NOT involve physical contact. Any act that creates a hostile work environment - be it by virtue of cracking lewd jokes, verbal abuse, circulating lewd rumours etc. counts as sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=FP Staff |url=http://www.firstpost.com/india/sexual-harassment-and-vishakha-guidelines-all-you-need-to-know-1241649.html |title=Sexual harassment and Vishakha guidelines: All you need to know |publisher=Firstpost |date=2011-02-23 |accessdate=2013-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of a hostile work environment through unwelcome physical verbal or non-verbal conduct of sexual nature may consist not of a single act but of pattern of behaviour comprising  many such acts.

Thus, it is important that the victim report such behaviour as soon as possible and not wait for it to become worse. In some cases, the psychological stigma of reporting the conduct of a co-worker might require a great deal of courage on the part of the victim and they may report such acts after a long period of time. The guidelines suggest that the complaint mechanism should ensure time bound treatment of complaints, but '''they do not suggest that a report can only be made within a short period of time since the incident occurred'''.

Often, the police refuse to lodge [[First Information Report|FIR]]s for [[sexual harassment]] cases, especially where the harassment occurred some time ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=TNN May 7, 2013, 11.04AM IST |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-05-07/ranchi/39089462_1_police-station-police-officer-khunti |title=Most harassment cases go unreported - Times Of India |publisher=Articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date=2013-05-07 |accessdate=2013-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== From guidelines to Act ==

The [[Supreme Court of India]]'s judgement only proposed guidelines to alleviate the problem of [[sexual harassment]] in 1997. India finally enacted its law on prevention of sexual harassment against female employees at the workplace. [[The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013]] ("[[Sexual Harassment]] Act") has been made effective on April 23, 2013 by way of publication in the [[Gazette of India]].&lt;ref name="mondaq1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mondaq.com/india/x/238076/Discrimination+Disability+Sexual+Harassment/Indias+New+Labour+Law+Prevention+Of+Sexual+Harassment+At+The+Workplace |title=India’s New Labour Law - Prevention Of Sexual Harassment At The Workplace - Employment and HR - India |publisher=Mondaq.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is also Professor in the Department of English at [[Matsuyama University]].

==Education and career==
Tsuda was born in [[Kanagawa]], Japan in 1950. He majored in English and graduated from [[Yokohama National University]] in 1973. He received his M.A. in [[TEFL]] (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) in 1978 and his Ph.D. in [[Speech Communication]] in 1985 from [[Southern Illinois University]] at Carbondale.&lt;ref&gt;Majid Tehranian (Ed.), ''Worlds Apart: Human Security and Global Governance'', New York, NY: I. B. Tauris, 1999, p. x.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tsuda held several faculty positions in his academic career. He was Associate Professor in the Faculty of Economics at [[Nagasaki University]] from 1986 to 1988. He then moved to [[Nagoya University]] where he was Associate Professor in the Institute of Languages and Cultures from 1988 to 1993 and Professor in the Department of International Communication and in the Graduate School of International Development from 1993 to 2001.

Tsuda had been Professor in the Doctoral Program in Modern Cultures and Public Policies in the Graduate School of Humanities and Social Sciences at the University of Tsukuba since 2001. He retired from the University of Tsukuba and founded the Institute of Peace Linguistics in [[Ibaraki Prefecture]] in 2014. He is currently Professor in the Department of English at Matsuyama University in [[Ehime Prefecture]].

Tsuda was Visiting Professor at the [[International Research Center for Japanese Studies]] in [[Kyoto]] in 1996 &lt;ref&gt;Yukio Tsuda (Ed.), "The Japanese and the English Language: An Interdisciplinary Study of Anglicized (Americanized) Japan" (Special Section), ''Japan Review'', 1998, No. 10, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; and at the [[College of San Mateo]] in California in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Nat Friedland, "Fulbright Scholar in Residence a first for CSM," ''The San Francisco Examiner'', March 3, 2007 (http://www.sfexaminer.com/fulbright-scholar-in-residence-a-first-for-csm/).&lt;/ref&gt; He was also [[Braj Kachru]] Fellow in the "Internationalization Forum" program in 1996 and Visiting Fellow in 1999 at the [[East-West Center]] in Honolulu, Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;East-West Center (Ed.), ''Building an Asia Pacific Community'' (Annual Report 1999), Honolulu, HI: East-West Center, 2000, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tsuda's academic interests include [[language policy]], cross-cultural [[psychoanalysis]], and international and [[intercultural communication]]. Among his publications are ''Language Inequality and Distortion in Intercultural Communication: A Critical Theory Approach'' (John Benjamins, 1986), ''Language, Education, and Intercultural Communication'' (Nagasaki University, 1988), ''Eigo Shihai-no Kouzou'' [''The Structure of the Dominance of English''] (Daisan Shokan, 1990), ''Shinryaku-suru Eigo, Hangeki-suru Nihongo'' [''The Invading English, The Counter-Attacking Japanese''] (PHP Institute, 1996), and ''Eigo Shihai-to Kotoba-no Byoudou'' [''The Hegemony of English and Linguistic Equality''] (Keio University Press, 2006).

==The Ecology of Language Paradigm==
Tsuda is well known as a critic of the [[hegemony]] of English and as an advocate of linguistic and [[cultural pluralism]]. He believes that the domination of English is tantamount to [[linguicism]] and [[language death|linguicide]], and that addressing the problem of linguistic hegemony is crucial to the development of human and cultural security.&lt;ref&gt;Yukio Tsuda, "Anglomania Muddies Japan's Self-Image," ''Asahi Evening News'', January 23, 1997, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yukio Tsuda, "Language Problems in Intercultural Communication: Review and Suggestions," ''Studies in Language and Culture'', Vol. 10, No. 1, 1988, pp. 17-30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yukio Tsuda, "Speaking Against the Hegemony of English," in ''Special Research Project: Civil Society, the State and Culture in Comparative Perspective'' (Annual Report), Tsukuba, Japan: University of Tsukuba, 2005, pp. 235-244.&lt;/ref&gt; In an article in ''The San Matean'', a San Mateo Community College newspaper, dated March 19, 2007, Tsuda was quoted to say: "It is more important to be students learning other languages than being a teacher only teaching one." He proposed the "ecology of language" paradigm as opposed to the "diffusion of English" paradigm.

{{Quotation|The Diffusion of English Paradigm, which is a dominant position not only in the Anglo-American world but also in the former British colonies in Asia and Africa, is characterized by theoretical orientations such as capitalism, science and technology, modernization, monolingualism, ideological globalization and internationalization, transnationalization, Americanization, the homogenization of the world culture, and linguistic, cultural, and media imperialism. In contrast, an alternative theoretical orientation critical of the Diffusion of English Paradigm is what I call the "Ecology of Language Paradigm." This paradigm is based on the theoretical positions such as the human rights perspective, equality in communication, multilingualism, the maintenance of languages and cultures, the protection of national sovereignties, and the promotion of foreign language education.&lt;ref&gt;Yukio Tsuda, "The Diffusion of English: Its Impact on Culture and Communication," ''Keio Communication Review'', No. 16, March 1994, pp. 58-59.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Tsuda urges international and intercultural communication scholars to recognize the hegemony of English as a subject of academic inquiry in the fields especially in the English-speaking countries. He also suggests that English-language teaching professionals incorporate the ecology of language paradigm into the contents and methods of teaching as well as teacher education. Finally, he insists that both native speakers and non-native speakers of English learn the philosophy of the ecology of language so that they will become more sensitive to the ethical aspects of international and intercultural communication.&lt;ref&gt;Yukio Tsuda, "The Hegemony of English and Strategies for Linguistic Pluralism: Proposing the Ecology of Language Paradigm," in Molefi Kete Asante, Yoshitaka Miike, and Jing Yin (Eds.), ''The Global Intercultural Communication Reader'' (2nd Ed.), New York, NY: Routledge, 2014, p. 455.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5259">[[File:View over Playa La Ropa.jpg|thumb|Playa La Ropa near the site of the Zihuatanejo Project]]
The '''Zihuatanejo Project''' was a psychedelic training center and  [[intentional community]] created during the beginning of the [[counterculture of the 1960s]] by [[Timothy Leary]] and [[Richard Alpert]] under the umbrella of their nonprofit group, the International Federation for Internal Freedom (IFIF).  The community was located in [[Zihuatanejo]], [[Guerrero]], [[Mexico]], and took up residence at the Hotel Catalina in the summers of 1962 and 1963.&lt;ref name="Leary1964"&gt;Leary, Timothy; Richard Alpert; Ralph Metzner. 1964.

==Background==
Leary and Alpert first discovered the town of Zihuatanejo in 1960.  After the [[Marsh Chapel Experiment]] in 1962 they decided the area would make a good location for a training center.&lt;ref name="Conners"/&gt;  The idea for the community was influenced by [[Aldous Huxley]]'s fictional novel,  ''[[Island (Huxley novel)|Island]]'' (1962).&lt;ref&gt;Greenfield, Robert. 2006. ''Timothy Leary: A Biography''. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. {{ISBN|0-15603-206-6}}. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lattin"&gt;Lattin, Don. 2011.

HarperCollins. {{ISBN|0-06165-594-5}}. 2011, 99, 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training program==
Thousands of people applied to the IFIF in the hopes of joining the project in Zihuatanejo.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Martin A. &amp; Shlain, Bruce. 1992. "Preaching LSD". ''Acid Dreams: The Complete Social History of LSD: The CIA, the Sixties, and Beyond'', Grove Press, {{ISBN|0-8021-3062-3}}. 96-98.&lt;/ref&gt;  Out of this pool of applicants, a small, select group of people were chosen.  Amenities cost $200 a month per person, including food and lodging in bungalows near a secluded beach.  Fishermen supplied a bounty of fresh fish from the bay.  During the first training session in 1962, Leary and 35 guests rented the Catalina Hotel for a month using their own version of the ''[[The Psychedelic Experience: A Manual Based on the Tibetan Book of the Dead|Tibetan Book of the Dead]]'' as a guide book for [[LSD]] sessions; [[Ralph Metzner]] and Richard Alpert helped manage the group.&lt;ref&gt;Dass, Ram; Metzner, Ralph; Bravo, Gary. 2010.  ''Birth of a Psychedelic Culture: Conversations about Leary, the Harvard Experiments, Millbrook and the Sixties''. Synergetic Press. {{ISBN|9780907791386}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Group LSD sessions began in the morning with the consumption of liquid LSD, with a dosage of 100 to 500 micrograms ingested by participating individuals; the experience would usually last until late afternoon.

==Closure==
Immigration officials were tipped off to the project when the Mexican media began reporting stories about an "LSD Paradise".  In the summer of 1963, after only six weeks (May 1 - June 16) the Mexican authorities shut the community down.  Officials removed the group from Zihuatanejo and sent them to [[Mexico City]] aboard a chartered [[Douglas DC-3|

Hollingshead's account is from Dusheck, George. July 2, 1963. "Paradise Lost by Mexico LSD Colony." ''San Francisco News-Call Bulletin''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Several failed attempts were made to move the training center to Dominica and Antigua.  In August 1963, with the help of wealthy patrons, Leary and their group moved to [[Millbrook, New York]], where they stayed until 1968.&lt;ref name="Conners"&gt;Conners, Peter. 2010.

Leary talks extensively about the project on the rare, out-of-print 1966 recording, ''Turn On, Tune In, Drop Out: Timothy Leary Ph.D.  speaks on L.S.D.''

'''Zulkifli Hasan''' (born 17 May 1962 in Lampung) is an [[Indonesian people|Indonesian]] politician who is currently Speaker of the [[People's Consultative Assembly|People's Consultative Assembly (MPR)]] and Chairman of the Islam-oriented [[National Mandate Party]] (PAN). He was Forestry Minister from 22 October 2009 to 1 October 2014.

==Childhood and education==
Zulkifli Hasan was born to Hasan and Siti Zaenab, who were farmers in Pisang village in Penengahan, [[South Lampung Regency|South Lampung]]. In later life, he would claim to have experienced economic hardship as a child, saying he learnt to work hard by selling eggs produced on the farm. He attended a local elementary school from 1969 to 1975. At age 13, his father took him to Tanjungkarang (now called [[Bandar Lampung]]) to enroll him in junior high school level at the State Islamic Teachers Training School (PGAN), against the boy's wishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Zulkifli Hasan: Man Jadda Wajada!|url=http://rilis.id/Zulkifli-Hasan-Man-Jadda-Wajada|accessdate=1 April 2018|publisher=RILISID|date=13 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While attending PGAN, Zulkifli lived in a rented room in lodgings for boarders. He left PGAN in his fourth year at the school. He took an entrance exam for Madrasah Tsanawiah and passed. Without parental consent, he enrolled at Tandjungkarang State Senior High School. After four months, his father discovered he had switched schools and forced him to leave the high school. 

Armed with a little money from his mother, Zul moved to Jakarta. There, he attended State Senior High School 53 and graduated in 1982. In 1986, he enrolled at the Faculty of Economics at Krisnadwipayana University (Unkris) in Jakarta and financed his studies independently. In 2003, he graduated from PPM School of Management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Profil Zulkifli Hasan|url=https://www.viva.co.id/siapa/read/12-zulkifli-hasan|accessdate=3 April 2018|publisher=PT. Viva Media Baru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== A self-made man ==
Having been raised in a farming family, Zulkifli was motivated to seek success beyond a rural environs. In a 2015 interview, he said his parents had wanted him to become like [[Buya Hamka]], an Islam-oriented journalist and author from Sumatra. "But I refused. I wanted to migrate to Jakarta."

Arriving in Jakarta as a teenager without prior acquaintances or relatives, Zulkifli supported himself with jobs from washing taxis to selling drinks. He graduated from high school with the highest achievement in his class. He then tried his luck as a door-to-door salesman of pots and later attended college while doing business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kuwado|first1=Fabian Januarius|title=Zulkifli Hasan Bicara Kesuksesannya sebagai "Sales" Panci dan Reformasi PAN|url=https://nasional.kompas.com/read/2015/01/22/21413111/Zulkifli.Hasan.Bicara.Kesuksesannya.sebagai.Sales.Panci.dan.Reformasi.PAN|accessdate=3 April 2018|publisher=Kompas.com|date=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After exploring various areas of business, he began working for an ethnic Chinese businessman who sold home furnishings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kisah Dua Menteri yang Sama-Sama Putra Lampung|url=https://www.jpnn.com/news/kisah-dua-menteri-yang-sama-sama-putra-lampung?page=2|accessdate=9 April 2018|publisher=JPNN.com|date=24 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his later years, Zulkifli once visited Lembaga Pendidikan Insani (LPI), an educational institution whose operational costs came from Islamic donations. He told students there: "If I ate eggs and could become a minister, then you who eat chicken should be able to become president."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Widjaya|first1=M. Akbar|title=Masa Kecil Menhut Zulkifli Hasan, Makan Sebutir Telur Dibagi Delapan|url=http://www.republika.co.id/berita/nasional/umum/11/10/21/lteug3-masa-kecil-menhut-zulkifli-hasan-makan-sebutir-telur-dibagi-delapan|accessdate=1 April 2018|publisher=Republika.co.id|date=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Bang'' (Brother) Zul, as he was known, remained close to the people of his hometown in Lampung and would present assistance in times of disaster.

==Business career==
Prior to becoming a politician, Zulkifli worked as a civil servant and then started his own businesses. His father had advised him not to be a follower but to be a leader, even if that meant starting from something small, so he quit the civil service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Zulkifli Hasan, Keluar dari PNS Jadi Pengusaha Sukses|url=https://finance.detik.com/sosok/d-1943289/zulkifli-hasan-keluar-dari-pns-jadi-pengusaha-sukses|accessdate=3 April 2018|publisher=detikFinance|date=17 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His older brother, Herli Hasan, says Zulkifli left the civil service because the salary was low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kisah Dua Menteri yang Sama-Sama Putra Lampung|url=https://www.jpnn.com/news/kisah-dua-menteri-yang-sama-sama-putra-lampung?page=2|accessdate=9 April 2018|publisher=JPNN.com|date=24 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Youth entrepreneurship===
After starting his political career, he did not abandon his entrepreneurial interests. He became a motivator for young people and the wider community, particularly in Sumatra, to develop entrepreneurship and create new jobs. He encouraged rural youths to help advance Indonesia's future economic growth. In 2012, he supported a program of the National Mandate Party (PAN) that provided venture capital and training for young entrepreneurs in North Sumatra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Suryana|first1=Dede|title=Jadi KEK, Sumut Harus Tingkatkan Wirausaha|url=https://economy.okezone.com/read/2012/05/06/320/624714/jadi-kek-sumut-harus-tingkatkan-wirausaha|accessdate=3 April 2018|publisher=Okezone.com|date=6 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono was re-elected for a second term in 2009, Zulkifli was appointed forestry minister on 21 October 2009. He said his priorities would be the development of production forests (HTI and HTR), reducing forest fires by 20% annually, combating illegal logging, streamlining of overlapping regulations of the central government and regencies for forest sites, and improving forest industry institutions. He also said he would resist temptations and pressure from businessmen and politicians putting themselves before the public interest. “But temptations are always there everywhere. It’ll pose no problem to us if we just don’t pay attention to them,” he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Zulkifli Hasan vows to live up to his political contract|url=http://www.pressreader.com/indonesia/the-jakarta-post/20091102/282956741238073|accessdate=3 April 2018|publisher=The Jakarta Post|date=2 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indonesia's Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) in 2012 declared the Forestry Ministry to be considered the country's most corrupt institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Indonesia Struggles to Clean Up Corrupt Forestry Sector|url=http://jakartaglobe.id/news/indonesia-struggles-to-clean-up-corrupt-forestry-sector/|accessdate=4 April 2018|publisher=Jakarta Globe|date=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; To support efforts to eradicate corruption, Zulkifli issued circular No.SE.2 / Menhut-II / 2012 on Gratification Reporting at the Ministry of Forestry. The circular encouraged staff at the ministry to report the gratuities they receive to their superiors to report to first echelon officials and the KPK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Snowdon|first1=Karon|title=Forestry Ministry Signs an MoU With KPK|url=https://en.tempo.co/read/news/2013/05/21/055482221/Forestry-Ministry-Signs-an-MoU-With-KPK}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zulkifli served as forestry minister until 1 October 2014.

===Illegal forest operations===
In 2010, the Forestry Ministry promised to crack down on plantation companies operating without permits in Indonesia. In 2011, the ministry admitted hundreds of mining and plantation companies were operating in Central Kalimantan province without correct permits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Activists urge crackdown on 'forest mafia' networks|url=http://www.asia-pacific-solidarity.net/southeastasia/indonesia/netnews/2011/ind05v15.htm#Activists%20urge%20crackdown%20on%20'forest%20mafia'%20networks|accessdate=3 April 2018|publisher=Jakarta Globe|date=3 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zulkifli said the problem was due to misinterpretations of regional autonomy legislation introduced in 2001. Elfian Effendi of Greenomics Indonesia said it was difficult for the minister to stop the offending companies because they have political links.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Snowdon|first1=Karon|title=Indonesia admits hundreds of companies without forestry permits|url=http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/2011-02-02/indonesia-admits-hundreds-of-companies-without-forestry-permits/224918|accessdate=3 April 2018|publisher=ABC Radio Australia|date=2 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Forestry Ministry promised to stop issuing new plantation and mine permits in the province and to cooperate with the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) to enforce the law.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

===Moratorium on new forest concessions===
In January 2011, Zulkifli announced the Forestry Ministry would implement a 2-year moratorium on the issuance of permits for the conversion of primary and peat forests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Govt to implement forest conversion moratorium in January|url=https://en.antaranews.com/news/66951/govt-to-implement-forest-conversion-moratorium-in-january|accessdate=4 April 2018|publisher=Antara|date=13 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservationists noted that on the eve of the logging moratorium, the ministry issued 2.9 million hectares of new plantation concessions to 44 firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lang|first1=Chris|title=On the eve of the logging moratorium, Indonesia’s Ministry of Forestry issued almost three million hectares of concessions|url=http://www.redd-monitor.org/2011/01/26/on-the-eve-of-the-logging-moratorium-indonesias-ministry-of-forestry-issued-almost-three-million-hectares-of-concessions/|website=REDD-Monitor|publisher=Wordpress|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 May 2011, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono signed a presidential decree putting the two-year moratorium into effect. The decree covered from 64 million to 72 million hectares of primary forest and peatland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stolle|first1=Fred|title=Indonesia’s Ambitious Forest Moratorium Moves Forward|url=http://www.wri.org/blog/2011/06/indonesia%E2%80%99s-ambitious-forest-moratorium-moves-forward|website=World Resources Institute|publisher=World Resources Institute|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegation of state losses===
In May 2013, the Indonesian Forum for Budget Transparency (Fitra) claimed data from the State Audit Agency (BPK) showed the Forestry Ministry had lost or misappropriated Rp 7.1 trillion ($731 million) in 2012. Zulkifli responded by saying the data and description of “losses” were inaccurate. He said the actual figure was Rp 6.2 trillion in non-tax revenue the ministry has been unable to collect since 2002. “We’re continuing to collect on those payments, both at the regional level and at the central level, and to date we’ve whittled down the outstanding amount to just Rp 2.1 trillion,” he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Indonesian Ministers Deny Claims They Have Lost 8.3t Rupiah|url=http://jakartaglobe.id/news/indonesian-ministers-deny-claims-they-have-lost-8-3t-rupiah/|accessdate=4 April 2018|publisher=Jakarta Globe|date=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interview by Harrison Ford===
On 9 September 2013, Zulkifli was interviewed by [[Harrison Ford]] for part of a documentary series on climate change and the environment. Presidential adviser Andi Arief complained Ford had attacked the minister with rude questions. He accused Ford and his crew of “harassing state institutions” and threatened to deport him.

Zulkifli said Ford was emotional because he wanted illegal loggers swiftly arrested at [[Tesso Nilo National Park|Tesso Nilo]] National Park in Sumatra. The minister said Ford did not give him sufficient time to explain the difficulties of catching those who violate forestry laws. He lamented they had not rehearsed the interview before filming commenced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FM bemoans Harrison Ford's attitude|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/09/09/fm-bemoans-harrison-ford-s-attitude.html|accessdate=3 April 2018|publisher=The Jakarta Post|date=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Ford was making part of series on climate change called ''[[Years of Living Dangerously]]'' for US television network [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Harrison Ford shocks Indonesian minister with heated climate interview|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-09-10/indonesian-minister-shocked-at-harrison-ford-climate-interview/4949316|accessdate=3 April 2018|agency=AFP|publisher=ABC News|date=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hazardous smoke haze===
During Zulkifli's tenure as forestry minister, forests in Sumatra and Kalimantan were burned to clear land for plantations, causing hazardous haze that reached neighboring Singapore and Malaysia. In 2013, Kuntoro Mangkusubroto, the head of Indonesia's presidential working unit for development supervision and control, said many fires were on land owned by Asia Pulp and Paper (APP) and Asia Pacific Resources International Limited. Zulkifli said there was no strong evidence against the two companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lim|first1=Leonard|title=MFA seeks answers from Jakarta to conflicting views on whether Singapore firms caused haze|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/mfa-seeks-answers-from-jakarta-to-conflicting-views-on-whether-singapore-firms-caused-haze|accessdate=8 April 2018|publisher=The Straits Times|date=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In June 2013, Zulkifli blamed the severity of the haze on a five-year weather cycle. "Every five years, the weather becomes extremely dry. The wind is also much stronger and moves in a circular motion. So, when there is burning, fire spreads very quickly... Due to the dry season, it takes time for firefighters to locate the water sources. By the time water is irrigated to the hot spots, the fire would have spread."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lim|first1=Joyce|title=Severity of haze 'due to 5-year cycle' of dry weather|url=http://www.asiaone.com/health/severity-haze-due-5-year-cycle-dry-weather|accessdate=8 April 2018|publisher=The Straits Times|date=28 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Responding to allegations that plantation and forestry companies were responsible for the fires, Zulkifli was quoted by [[Tempo Magazine (Indonesia)|''Tempo'' magazine]] as saying the companies must be defended because they pay taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cahyadi|first1=Firdaus|title=When People's Safety are Sacrificed to Defend Companies|url=https://en.tempo.co/read/news/2013/07/07/080494143/When-Peoples-Safety-are-Sacrificed-to-Defend-Companies|accessdate=8 April 2018|publisher=Tempo.co|date=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said 14 people had been arrested on suspicion of starting fires, 11 of them linked to companies and three of them smallholders. "If proven guilty they could be jailed for five years and have their permits revoked," he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Indonesia allocates Rp100 billion to overcome forest fires|url=https://en.antaranews.com/news/89602/indonesia-allocates-rp100-billion-to-overcome-forest-fires|accessdate=8 April 2018|publisher=Antara|date=28 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, Zulkifli supported calls by the National Police and Indonesian Military for the shooting of people found burning forests if they resist arrest. He acknowledged the people responsible for forest fires were seeking to open up new land for oil palm plantations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Forestry Minister Echoes Calls for Strict Action on Haze Issue|url=http://jakartaglobe.id/news/forestry-minister-echoes-calls-strict-action-haze-issue/|accessdate=8 April 2018|publisher=Jakarta Globe|date=18 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2015, anti-haze activist Syahrul Fitra accused Zulkifli of allowing corporations to burn forests and causing the haze crisis. He claimed Zulkifli had allegedly given permission for the burning of over 1.3 million hectares of forests be used for plantations. He said law enforcers should arrest any officials responsible for the haze and called for an investigation into possible corruption in the issuance of permits. Zulkifli denied any wrongdoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Former Indonesian Forestry Minister blamed by activist for haze crisis|url=http://www.todayonline.com/world/asia/former-indonesian-forestry-minister-blamed-activist-haze-crisis|accessdate=8 April 2018|publisher=Mediacorp Press Ltd|date=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Riau forestry corruption case===
In August 2014, Zulkifli visited [[Riau]] province and encouraged proposals to change the status of forest land owned by locals so it could become part of 1,638,249 hectares allowed by the [[Indonesian Ministry of Forestry|Forestry Ministry]] for conversion into non-forest land.

Riau governor Annas Ma'mun's administration responded by sending a proposal to Zulkifli, who gave his approval to some of the areas. Annas later revised the proposal, adding some land owned by palm-oil businessman Gulat Manurung, who paid a bribe of S$156,000 and Rp 500 million. Annas later stated Zulkifli had approved and issued the conversion permit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Budiari|first1=Indra|title=MPR speaker faces more questions from KPK|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/11/13/mpr-speaker-faces-more-questions-kpk.html|accessdate=3 April 2018|publisher=The Jakarta Post|date=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 November 2014, Zulkifli was questioned as a witness by the [[Corruption Eradication Commission]] (KPK) in the case against Annas. Zulkifli denied approving the permit. Annas said he had been on his way to meet with Zulkifli when he was arrested by the KPK in a sting operation in September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Budiari|first1=Indra|title=Governor piles more allegations on Zulkifli|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/11/19/governor-piles-more-allegations-zulkifli.html|accessdate=3 April 2018|publisher=The Jakarta Post|date=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Testifying at Annas's corruption trial in April 2015, Zulkifli admitted he had met with the director of PT Duta Palma, Surya Darmadi, to discuss a forest clearing permit. Surya was linked to the case by Gulat, who said he helped PT Duta Palma to meet with Annas to enable the company to convert 18,000 hectares of land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=S.|first1=Iqbal T.

===Bogor land conversion case===
Zulkifli was questioned by the KPK on 11 November 2014 over the illegal issuance of a land conversion permit for a luxury housing project in [[Bogor Regency|Bogor]], [[West Java]]. The project was developed by property firm [[Sentul City, Indonesia|PT Sentul City]]. Former Bogor regent Rachmat Yasin received Rp 4.5 billion in bribes from Sentul City president director Kwee Cahyadi Kumala, who is president commissioner of property company PT Bukit Jonggol Asri (BJA), the main shareholder of Sentul City. KPK in December 2014 raided the Forestry Ministry to seize evidence. Zulkifli denied any wrongdoing. The Forestry Ministry's director general for planning, Bambang Supijanto, said Zulkifli had rejected BJA's proposal to convert nearly 3,000 acres of forest area for housing projects in Bogor because it lacked some requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Halim|first1=Haeril|title=KPK raids ministry's office in land-conversion case|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/12/17/kpk-raids-ministry-s-office-land-conversion-case.html|accessdate=3 April 2018|publisher=The Jakarta Post|date=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forest smallholdings and education===
Zulkifli sought to improve the performance and image of the Forestry Ministry through two programs: one targeting the growth of agriculture through smallholdings in forest areas, and the other promoting environmental education. The first was the simplification of the application procedure for the development of smallholdings under the Community Nursery (''Kebun Bibit Rakyat'', KBR) scheme, introduced in 2010 and simplified in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Prosedur Kebun Bibit Rakyat Dipermudah |url=https://ekonomi.kompas.com/read/2011/03/16/0352377/prosedur.kebun.bibit.rakyat.dipermudah |accessdate=6 August 2018 |publisher=Kompas Cyber Media |date=16 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second is the Forest Education program, which involves students visiting selected forest areas and planting trees.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Flurry of decrees===
Conservation groups have alleged that after Joko Widodo had won Indonesia’s presidential election in July 2014, Zulkifli realized he would not retain his cabinet position because PAN was not part of the incoming ruling coalition, so he therefore started issuing more ministerial decrees, right up to his final week in office, when 100 decrees were signed. Many of the decrees granted new concessions for timber and logging companies, or allowed forest land to be used by oil palm plantation companies. Much of the land in question is in Papua province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=September 29th 2014, a terrible day for Papua’s forests|url=https://awasmifee.potager.org/?p=1600|website=awasMIFEE!|publisher=awasMIFEE!|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenomics Indonesia said Zulkfli, during his tenure as minister, granted permits for 1.64 million acres of forest land to be used for farming, including for oil palm plantations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hendartyo|first1=Muhammad|title=Greenomics says PAN Cadre Granted More Land Permits Than Jokowi|url=https://en.tempo.co/read/news/2018/03/22/055916893/Greenomics-says-PAN-Cadre-Granted-More-Land-Permits-Than-Jokowi|accessdate=4 April 2018|publisher=Tempo.co|date=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zulkifli in March 2018 defended his action, saying Papua needed more land for sugar cultivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Novaria|first1=Astri|title=Respon Zulkifli Hasan Jawab Tudingan Greenomics|url=http://mediaindonesia.com/read/detail/151069-respon-zulkifli-hasan-jawab-tudingan-greenomics|accessdate=4 April 2018|publisher=Media Indonesia|date=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==MPR Speaker==
On 8 October 2014, Zulkifli was sworn in as speaker of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) for the 2014-2019 period. His appointment was supported by [[Prabowo Subianto]]'s Red-and-White Coalition following Prabowo's loss of the [[Indonesian presidential election, 2014|2014 presidential election]] to [[Joko Widodo|Joko "Jokowi" Widodo]]. Although PAN was then a member of the opposition coalition, Zulkifli promised to uphold the interests of all Indonesians and not just those of his political supporters. Jokowi's coalition had wanted [[Oesman Sapta Odang]] as MPR speaker, but Zulkifli defeated Oesman by 347 to 330 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Zulkifli Hasan inaugurated as new speaker of People's Consultative Assembly|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/10/08/zulkifli-hasan-inaugurated-new-speaker-people-s-consultative-assembly.html|accessdate=3 April 2018|publisher=The Jakarta Post|date=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Zulkifli's first tasks as MPR speaker was to lead the inauguration ceremony of Indonesia's seventh president, Joko Widodo, on 20 October 2014. He was credited for ensuring the event was attended by the losing presidential candidate Prabowo Subianto, who had vigorously rejected the election result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hariyadi|first1=Yoseph|title=Jokowi inaugurated as Indonesia's new president|url=https://en.antaranews.com/news/96163/jokowi-inaugurated-as-indonesias-new-president|publisher=The Jakarta Post|date=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 December 2014, Zulkifli said protests against then-Jakarta governor [[Basuki Tjahaja Purnama]], better known as Ahok, on the basis of his religion and race were unacceptable. Ahok, a Christian of Chinese ethnicity, faced opposition from conservative Muslim groups. "I strongly protest those who protest against Ahok because he's ethnic Chinese or because of his religion. If you want to criticize, go ahead, but do not make it about ethnicity, religion or race, as we are united in diversity," he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ketua MPR: Tak Boleh Ada yang Protes Ahok Karena Etnis dan Agamanya|url=https://news.detik.com/berita/d-2784784/ketua-mpr-tak-boleh-ada-yang-protes-ahok-karena-etnis-dan-agamanya|accessdate=5 April 2018|publisher=detikcom|date=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stance on alcohol and drugs===
In May 2016, Zulkifli called for tighter regulations on the sale of alcohol, saying it has negative social consequences, including death and crimes of obscenity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zulfikar|first1=Muhammad|title=Zulkifli Hasan: Peredaran Miras di Indonesia Harus Diatur|url=http://www.tribunnews.com/mpr-ri/2016/05/27/zulkifli-hasan-peredaran-miras-di-indonesia-harus-diatur|accessdate=8 April 2018|publisher=Tribunnews.com|date=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indonesia already bans the sale of alcohol to minors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wahyuningsih|first1=Merry|title=Tak Boleh Minum Bir Sebelum Umur 21 Tahun|url=https://www.cnnindonesia.com/gaya-hidup/20141031121011-255-9076/tak-boleh-minum-bir-sebelum-umur-21-tahun|accessdate=8 April 2018|publisher=CNN Indonesia|date=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2018, Zulkifli claimed eight parties in the national parliament were in favor of open alcohol sales at small shops. He said alcoholic drinks should be rejected firmly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Delapan Fraksi Setujui Penjualan Miras Secara Bebas|url=https://www.jawapos.com/read/2018/01/20/182792/delapan-fraksi-setujui-penjualan-miras-secara-bebas|accessdate=8 April 2018|publisher=PT Jawa Pos Grup Multimedia|date=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, Zulkifli called for smoking to be banned as it contributes to "ignorance and poverty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Aco|first1=Hasanudin|title=Zulkifli Hasan: Stop Merokok!|url=http://www.tribunnews.com/nasional/2016/02/16/zulkifli-hasan-stop-merokok|accessdate=4 April 2018|publisher=TRIBUNnews.com|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018, Zulkifli said drug traffickers should be shot dead, while drug users should be rehabilitated rather than imprisoned, as most of Indonesia's prison inmates are drug offenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tegas!!

Indo Network Intermedia|date=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition to LGBT===
In March 2016, Zulkifli said the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) movement should have no place in Indonesia, but he warned against violence and discrimination. "As a movement, the existence of LGBT must be opposed. We must limit its room to move. However, as individual people, they must be protected like any other citizen," he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nurbinato|first1=Bambang|title=More political leaders speak out against LGBT|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/03/04/more-political-leaders-speak-out-against-lgbt.html|accessdate=3 April 2018|publisher=The Jakarta Post|date=21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, Zulkifli falsely claimed five parties in the House of Representatives were supporting a bill to legalize same-sex marriage. His statement was refuted by House speaker [[Bambang Soesatyo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=La Batu|first1=Safrin|title=MPR speaker’s remarks on LGBT spark controversy|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2018/01/23/mpr-speaker-s-remarks-lgbt-spark-controversy.html|accessdate=3 April 2018|publisher=The Jakarta Post|date=23 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and prompted other major parties to affirm their opposition to gay rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Knight|first1=Kyle|title=Why criminalizing LGBT relationships is misguided|url=http://www.atimes.com/criminalising-lgbt-relations-indonesia-preposterous/|accessdate=3 April 2018|publisher=Asia Times|date=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Protecting LGBTs|url=https://en.tempo.co/read/news/2018/02/06/314915509/Protecting-LGBTs|accessdate=3 April 2018|publisher=Tempo.co|date=6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chairman of PAN==
PAN held a congress in Bali over 28 February to 2 March 2015 to choose a chairman for the 2015-2020 period. Among those considered contenders were Zulkifli, then-incumbent chairman Hatta Rajasa and deputy chairman Dradjad Wibowo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tiga Nama Calon Ketua Umum PAN|url=https://nasional.kompas.com/read/2014/12/18/09333521/Tiga.Nama.Calon.Ketua.Umum.PAN|accessdate=3 April 2018|publisher=Komps.com|date=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zulkifli announced his candidacy on 19 January 2015 in Surabaya. The Chairman of PAN's Youth Front Advisory Council, Hanafi Rais, said Zulkfli wanted the party to focus on defending the interests of the people, as well as giving local party officials full authority in determining regional leadership boards, and improving the performances of regional heads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stefanie|first1=Christie|title=Deklarasi Ketua Umum PAN, Zulkifli Hasan Bawa 4 Gagasan|url=https://www.cnnindonesia.com/nasional/20150121121055-32-26195/deklarasi-ketua-umum-pan-zulkifli-hasan-bawa-4-gagasan|accessdate=3 April 2018|publisher=CNN Indonesia|date=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 March 2015, Zulkifli was narrowly elected PAN chairman, receiving 292 votes, while Hatta Rajasa received 286 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Aritonang|first1=Margareth S.|title=MPR speaker elected new PAN chief|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/03/02/mpr-speaker-elected-new-pan-chief.html|accessdate=3 April 2018|publisher=The Jakarta Post|date=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his election, Zulkifli insisted PAN would remain part of Prabowo Subianto's opposition coalition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sihaloho|first1=Markus Junianto|title=PAN Will Remain in Opposition, New Chairman Zulkifli Says|url=http://jakartaglobe.id/news/pan-will-remain-opposition-new-chairman-zulkifli-says/|accessdate=3 April 2018|publisher=Jakarta Globe|date=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 September 2015, Zulkifli announced PAN was switching its allegiance to Jokowi's ruling coalition in order to help the government's programs succeed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PAN Officially Switches Sides, Joins Jokowi's Coalition|url=http://jakartaglobe.id/news/pan-officially-switches-sides-joins-jokowis-coalition/|accessdate=3 April 2018|publisher=Jakarta Globe|date=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 August 2018, Zulkifli shifted PAN's allegiance back to Prabowo amid allegations that Prabowo's running mate for the 2019 presidential election, Sandiaga Uno, had paid Rp 500 billion to PAN in order to secure his nomination. PAN denied the allegation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Saputro |first1=Febrianto Adi |title=PAN actually wants Anies Baswedan to run with Prabowo |url=https://www.republika.co.id/berita/en/national-politics/18/08/23/pdxafc414-pan-actually-wants-anies-baswedan-to-run-with-prabowo |accessdate=25 August 2018 |publisher=Republika.co.id |date=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=PAN, PKS deny getting Rp 500b to let Sandiaga become VP candidate |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2018/08/09/pan-pks-deny-getting-rp-500b-to-let-sandiaga-become-vp-candidate.html |accessdate=25 August 2018 |publisher=The Jakarta Post |date=9 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Money politics===
In February 2017, Zulkifli urged Indonesians to avoid all forms of money politics in regional elections. “The sovereignty and power are fully in the hands of the people. Do not trade it for money or staple foods,” he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sihaloho|first1=Markus Junianto|title=MPR Speaker Zulkifli Hasan Calls on Public to Avoid Money Politics in Regional Elections|url=http://jakartaglobe.id/news/mpr-speaker-zulkifli-hasan-calls-on-public-to-avoid-money-politics-in-regional-elections/|accessdate=4 April 2018|publisher=Jakarta Globe|date=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 March 2018, Zulkifli was filmed giving money to women in a public transport vehicle at a market in [[Muara Enim Regency|Muara Enim]] in [[South Sumatra]] province, ahead of the election for the regent of Muara Enim. He was accompanied at the market by regency head candidate Syamsul Bahri, who is supported by PAN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Adriansyah Laporkan Balik Cabub Syamsul Bahri Ke Polres Muara Enim|url=http://www.palugadanews.com/2018/03/adriansyah-laporkan-balik-cabub-syamsul-bahri-ke-polres-muara-enim/|accessdate=7 April 2018|publisher=Palugadanews.com|date=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Inge|first1=Nefri|title=PAN Bantah Zulkifli Hasan Lakukan Politik Uang di Pilkada Muara Enim|url=http://www.liputan6.com/pilkada/read/3373367/pan-bantah-zulkifli-hasan-lakukan-politik-uang-di-pilkada-muara-enim|accessdate=4 April 2018|publisher=Liputan6.com|date=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Election Supervisory Agency (Panwaslu) of Muara Enim conducted an investigation and attempted to summon Zulkifli for questioning but he was too busy to attend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Inge|first1=Nefri|title=Terekam Bagi-Bagi Duit, Zulkifli Hasan Akan Diperiksa Panwas Muara Enim|url=http://www.liputan6.com/pilkada/read/3370498/terekam-bagi-bagi-duit-zulkifli-hasan-akan-diperiksa-panwas-muara-enim|accessdate=4 April 2018|publisher=Liputan6.com|date=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; PAN officials denied the handing out of money in the presence of the candidate constituted money politics, arguing Syamsul Bahri's presence was his own initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Inge|first1=Nefri|title=PAN Bantah Zulkifli Hasan Lakukan Politik Uang di Pilkada Muara Enim|url=http://www.liputan6.com/pilkada/read/3373367/pan-bantah-zulkifli-hasan-lakukan-politik-uang-di-pilkada-muara-enim|accessdate=4 April 2018|publisher=Liputan6.com|date=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Panwaslu later concluded Zulkifli had not been trying to influence voters to choose a particular candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Inge|first1=Nefri|title=Alasan Panwas Muara Enim Bebaskan Zulkifli Hasan|url=http://www.liputan6.com/pilkada/read/3382311/alasan-panwas-muara-enim-bebaskan-zulkifli-hasan|accessdate=4 April 2018|publisher=Liputan6.com|date=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presidential ambition===
In February 2018, Zulkifli said he would be ready to contest Indonesia's [[Indonesian presidential election, 2019|2019 presidential election]] if he is nominated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Triansyah|first1=Isra|title=Zulkifli Hasan Siap Maju Capres jika Diusung PAN|url=https://nasional.sindonews.com/read/1283700/12/zulkifli-hasan-siap-maju-capres-jika-diusung-pan-1519128456|accessdate=4 April 2018|publisher=SINDOnews.com|date=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later acknowledged any presidential nominee would likely require the backing of a coalition of parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Purbaya|first1=Angling Adhitya|title=Zulkifli Perhitungkan Syarat Kursi 20% Untuk Ikut Pilpres|url=https://news.detik.com/berita-jawa-tengah/d-3943561/zulkifli-perhitungkan-syarat-kursi-20-untuk-ikut-pilpres|accessdate=4 April 2018|publisher=detikcom|date=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2018, he said he would be PAN's presidential candidate, despite speculation the party might choose former military commander [[Gatot Nurmantyo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bayhaqi|first1=Ahda|title=Zulkifli Hasan sebut PAN tak akan usung Gatot di Pilpres 2019|url=https://www.merdeka.com/politik/zulkifli-hasan-sebut-pan-tak-akan-usung-gatot-di-pilpres-2019.html|accessdate=4 April 2018|publisher=Merdeka.com|date=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; PAN ended up supporting Prabowo Subianto for the 2019 presidential election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Zulkifli Hasan Reveals Prabowo-Sandiaga Campaign Team |url=https://en.tempo.co/read/news/2018/08/18/055920916/Zulkifli-Hasan-Reveals-Prabowo-Sandiaga-Campaign-Team |accessdate=25 August 2018 |publisher=Tempo.co |date=18 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Helmi Hasan, who became mayor of Bengkulu in 2013, viewed Zulkifli not only as an older brother but also as a parent to be obeyed and respected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dibalik “Insya Allah” Helmi Hasan|url=http://bengkuluekspress.com/dibalik-insya-allah-helmi-hasan/|accessdate=8 April 2018|publisher=Bengkuluekspress.com|date=21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zulkifli, Helmi and Zainudin founded Insan Cendikia Kalianda Lampung Indonesia Foundation, which built a free school for children from poor families in Lampung.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Supriyadi|first1=Eko|title=Zulkifli Hasan Tinjau SMA Kebangsaan di Lampung|url=http://www.republika.co.id/berita/mpr-ri/berita-mpr/16/03/17/o46sy3254-zulkifli-hasan-tinjau-sma-kebangsaan-di-lampung|accessdate=8 April 2018|publisher=republika.co.id|date=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, Helmi Hasan was declared a suspect by Bengkulu Attorney General's Office for allegedly embezzling Rp 11.4 billion ($870,000) of social aid from the city's 2012-2013 budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bengkulu Mayor Named Corruption Suspect|url=http://jakartaglobe.id/news/bengkulu-mayor-named-corruption-suspect/|accessdate=8 April 2018|publisher=Jakarta Globe|date=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Helmi filed a pre-trial motion, which was accepted on 9 September 2015 by Bengkulu City State Court, so he did not stand trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Supriatin|title=Pengadilan batalkan status tersangka wali kota Bengkulu Helmi Hasan|url=https://www.merdeka.com/peristiwa/pn-bengkulu-batalkan-status-tersangka-wali-kota-bengkulu-helmi-hasan.html|accessdate=8 April 2018|publisher=Merdeka.com|date=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former head of Bengkulu City's Office for Management of Regional Revenue, Finance and Assets, M.
