'''Al Duqm Port &amp; Drydock''' is a [[seaport]] located in [[Oman]].  The  port is equipped with a Ship Repair Yard &amp; [[Drydock]] facility, which is the first of its kind in Oman. Control of the port was transferred to the [[Ministry of Transport and Communications (Oman)|Ministry of Transport and Communications]] in May 2012. The port authority is the [[Port of Duqm Company]], S.A.O.C., who manage the port.

[[Oman Drydock Company]] (ODC) have run the ship repair yard since 2013; primarily for the overhaul and conversion of large commercial vessels. In 2017 ODC and [[Babcock International Group]] started [[Duqm Naval Dockyard]] (DND), focusing on the expansion of the port's capability into the support of military forces operating in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.omanobserver.om/new-oman-duqm-naval-dockyard-set-april-launch|title=New Oman Duqm Naval Dockyard set for April launch|publisher=OEPPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International access==

In August 2017, Oman and the United Kingdom signed a [[memorandum of understanding]] allowing th [[Royal Navy]] access to the port facilities of Duqm.&lt;ref name="ie"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-gets-access-to-strategic-oman-port-for-military-use-chabahar-gwadar-in-sight-5061573/ |publisher=''[[Indian Express]]'' |title=India gets access to strategic Oman port Duqm for military use, Chabahar-Gwadar in sight |first=Shubhajit |last=Roy |date=February 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, India announced that it had secured access to the facilities at Duqm for the [[Indian Air Force]] and the [[Indian Navy]].&lt;ref name="ie"/&gt; Duqm had previously served as a port for the [[INS Mumbai|INS ''Mumbai'']].&lt;ref name="ie"/&gt;

'''''Alivuokralainen''''' ([[Finnish language|Finnish]] for "the sub-tenant") is a [[Finland|Finnish]] comedy play written by [[Timo Kahilainen]] and [[Heikki Vihinen]] and directed by Heikki Vihinen. The play stars [[Heikki Hela]], [[Heikki Kinnunen]], [[Kake Aunesneva]], [[Jukka Leisti]], [[Ritva Jalonen]], [[Ilpo Hakala]], [[Tuija Ernamo]], [[Pete Keskinen]] and [[Mikko Rantaniva]]. It premiered in 2003 and is still showing in [[Tampere]].

==Plot==

[[Entomologist]] Pauli Bergström and [[kidney]] [[surgeon]] Lauri Mustonen share a 280 m² rented [[apartment]] in the centre of [[Helsinki]]. Their peaceful, uneventful life is interrupted when their [[landlady]], aging aristocrat Lydia Molotova, decides to give the apartment as a gift to her nephew, Sergeant John Molotov. Immediately, Sergeant Molotov raises the [[renting|rent]] by a factor of more than ten, which is more than Bergström and Mustonen can pay. Not wanting to move elsewhere, they place an ad in the [[newspaper]], looking for a sub-tenant to help them pay the rent. The sub-tenant is Carl Robert Palmberg, a [[Finland-Swedish]] interior decorator in his 30s, who is openly [[homosexuality|gay]]. Things get further complicated when Sergeant Molotov has to undergo surgery because of an infected kidney, and Mustonen decides to operate him privately.

'''"Are You Sure?"''' is a song by [[United Kingdom|British]] pop duo [[The Allisons]], that represented the United Kingdom at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1961]], performed in [[English language|English]].

The song was performed 15th on the night of the contest, held on 18 March 1961, following [[Luxembourg]]'s [[Jean-Claude Pascal]] with "[[Nous les amoureux]]", and preceding [[Italy]]'s [[Betty Curtis]] with "[[Al di là]]". The song received 24 points, placing 2nd in a field of 16, the third consecutive second place Eurovision finish for the UK for whom two subsequent Eurovision entrants would also be second-place finishers before "[[Puppet on a String]]" by [[Sandie Shaw]] would give the UK its first Eurovision victory at [[Eurovision Song Contest 1967|Eurovision 1967]]. "Are You Sure?" was also the first UK Eurovision entrant to become a Top Ten hit reaching #2 UK, the best chart showing for a UK Eurovision entrant until "Puppet on a String" by Sandie Shaw reached #1 in 1967.

The song was succeeded as the [[United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest|UK representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1962|1962 Contest]] by [[Ronnie Carroll]] with "[[Ring-A-Ding Girl]]".

The lyrics are memorable for a possibly unique example of the bizarre grammatical error "Comes tomorrow, you won't want me".

'''''Ben Hur Live''''' is a 2009 stage adaptation of [[Lew Wallace]]'s novel ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ]]''. Produced by Franz Abraham with music and narration by [[Stewart Copeland]], it premièred on 17 September 2009 at the [[The O2 arena (London)|O2 Arena]] in London, the first date of its European tour.

The show's dialogue is in [[Latin]] and [[Aramaic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2009/sep/14/ben-hur-live|title=Ben Hur Live leaves little to the imagination|last=Espiner|first=Mark|date=14 September 2009|work=guardian.co.uk|publisher=Guardian News and Media|accessdate=18 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it includes a [[sea battle]] and [[gladiatorial combat]], as well as the [[chariot race]] for which ''Ben Hur'' is famous. It is based primarily on the book as its source material rather than the [[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Academy Award-winning adaptation]] which starred [[Charlton Heston]].

== Reception ==
After its London première, it received mixed reviews from theatre critics.&lt;ref name="PressRev"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts_and_culture/8262536.stm|title=Ben Hur Live: press views|date=18 September 2009|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=18 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Boan''' (Buan, ''Ababuan'') is a proposed intermediate group of [[Bantu languages]] coded Zones C and D in Guthrie's classification.&lt;ref&gt;McMaster, Mary Allen. 1988. ''Patterns of Interaction: A comparative ethnolinguistic perspective on the Uele region of Zaïre ca. 500 A.D. to 1900 A.D.'' Los Angeles: University of California. 346.&lt;/ref&gt; There are three branches:

*''[[Komo language (Bantu)|Komo]]'' (D20)
*''[[Bali language (Congo)|Bali]]'' (D20), ?[[Beeke language|Beeke]]
*Bomokandian (the various [[Bati–Angba languages|Bwa]] and [[Komo–Bira languages|Biran]] languages)
**[[Biran languages|Biran]] (Bira–Amba) (D22, D30)
**''[[Homa language|Homa]] (Ngenda)'' (D40)
**''[[Lika language|Lika]]'' (D20)
**[[Bati–Angba languages|Bati–Angba]] (Bwa) (C40)

Beeke is an erstwhile member of the [[Nyali languages|Nyali]] cluster that seems to be closest to Bali.

In the ''Glottolog'' 2.3 classification, several additional, poorly attested languages are included as being closest to Homa/Ngenda:

*''[[Bali language (Congo)|Bali]]'' (D20)
*Old Bomokandian
**[[Komo–Bira languages|Komoic]] (Biran, incl. Komo)
**[[Bati–Angba languages|Middle Bomokandian]] (Lika &amp; Bati–Angba)
**Ngbele–Ngenda

***Ngendan
****[[Homa language|Homa]], [[Ngbinda language|Ngbinda]], ?[[Boguru language|Boguru]], ?[[Bodo language (Central African Republic)|Bodo]] (perhaps instead [[Lebonya languages|Lebonya]])

The '''Boao Forum for Asia''' ('''BFA'''; {{zh|c=博鳌亚洲论坛|p=Bó'áo Yàzhōu Lùntán}}) is a non-profit organisation that hosts high-level forums for leaders from government, business and academia in [[Asia]] and other continents to share their vision on the most pressing issues in this dynamic region and the world at large. BFA is modelled on the [[World Economic Forum]] held annually in [[Davos]], [[Switzerland]]. Its fixed address is in [[Bo'ao]], [[Hainan]] province, [[China]], although the Secretariat is based in [[Beijing]]. The forum, sometimes known as the “Asian Davos”, takes its name from the town of Boao, located in China’s southern Hainan province, which has been the permanent venue for its annual conference since 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Lavers, Georgina, [http://vision.ae/articles/global_integration_dubai_to_host_boao_forum_for_asia "Global integration: Dubai to host Boao Forum for Asia"], ''[[Vision (magazine)|Vision]]'', June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Forum is committed to promoting regional economic integration and bringing Asian countries even closer to their development goals. Initiated in 1998 by [[Fidel V. Ramos]], former President of the Philippines, [[Bob Hawke]], former Prime Minister of Australia, and [[Morihiro Hosokawa]], former Prime Minister of Japan, the Boao Forum for Asia was formally inaugurated in February 2001. The founding of the BFA was driven by the People's Republic of China and founded by 26 [[Asia]]n and [[Australasia]]n states on 27 February 2001. The organisation held its first meeting from 12–13 April 2002. 

Discussions at the BFA focus on economics, integration, cooperation, society and the environment. In the past the forum also addressed China's entry into the [[World Trade Organization]], as well as [[1997 Asian Financial Crisis|Southeast Asia's economic crisis during the 1990s]]. The geopolitical strategy '[[China's peaceful rise]]' was a topic of discussion for the forum in 2004. In addition to its annual meeting, the BFA also sponsors other forums and meetings related to Asian issues.

'''''California''''' (663 tons) is the most famous of four [[Dutch clipper]]s launched in 1853. An iron-[[Hull (watercraft)|hull]]ed [[Clipper ship|clipper]], she was built by [[Fop Smit]] and mastered by F.C. Jaski for the company L. Bienfait &amp; sn. On the maiden voyage Jaski sailed her in 86 days from [[The Downs (ship anchorage)|The Downs]] to [[Port Adelaide]], delivering a hundred English immigrants.

'''The Canadian Peace Alliance / L'Alliance canadienne pour la paix''' (CPA/ACP) was a [[Canada|Canadian]] umbrella [[Peace movement|peace organization]] claiming more than 140 member groups. It was founded in 1985 but became inactive in 2017.

The Canadian Peace Alliance organized cross-Canada campaigns and actions; arranged political lobbying sessions between member groups and key political leaders in Ottawa; facilitated the development of strategies for the Canadian peace movement; and produced and distributed education and action materials.

The Canadian Peace Alliance's policy and campaign direction was determined by a bi-annual convention of member groups and by a geographically representative Steering Committee.

The Canadian Peace Alliance worked closely with the [[Canadian Labour Congress]].

== History ==
It was founded by Daniel Dörr (1788-1837) in 1817 in Vienna. His son Wilhelm Dörr I took the business over afterwards. Carl Dörr (1856-1934) succeeded as head of the company in 1882. For the excellence of the products he received a medal at the [[Weltausstellung 1873 Wien]].

'''Chinese Tartary''' (see also [[Tartary]]) is an archaic geographical term used especially during the time of the [[Qing Dynasty]]. The term was used as early as 1734 on a map created by the French geographer and cartographer [[Jean Baptiste Bourguignon d’Anville]] (1697–1782) who published the map in the ''Nouvel atlas de la Chine, de la Tartarie Chinoise et du Thibet'' (New atlas of China, Chinese Tartary, and Tibet) in 1738 (refer to the date of 1734 that appears on the map). D’Anville’s map was based on work ordered by the Emperor of China and conducted by Chinese under the supervision of the Jesuits.&lt;ref name=wdi&gt;{{cite web|website=World Digital Library|title=New atlas of China, Chinese Tartary, and Tibet|url=https://www.wdl.org/en/item/167/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also published in 1738 was ''A description of the empire of China and Chinese-Tartary together with the kingdoms of Korea, and Tibet'' by Father [[Jean-Baptiste Du Halde]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/descriptionofemp00duha A description of the empire of China and Chinese-Tartary together with the kingdoms of Korea, and Tibet] by [[Jean-Baptiste Du Halde]], Volume 2 (1738).&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to write in 1741 ''The General History of China Containing a Geographical, Historical, Chronological, Political and Physical Description of the Empire of China, Chinese-Tartary, Corea and Thibet''.&lt;ref&gt; {https://archive.org/details/generalhistoryc02haldgoog ''The General History of China: Containing a Geographical, Historical, Chronological, Political and Physical Description of the Empire of China, Chinese-Tartary, Corea and Thibet''] by [[Jean-Baptiste Du Halde]], Volume 2 (1736).&lt;/ref&gt; Modern areas today that were described by their work as falling within Chinese Tartary included:
*[[Xinjiang]]
*[[Mongolia]]
*[[Manchuria]]
*[[Qinghai]] (kokonor or Ho-Ho-Nor)

Its geographical boundaries are defined in ''A Geographical Dictionary Or Universal Gazetteer''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Geographical Dictionary Or Universal Gazetteer, Ancient and Modern, Volume 2|author=Joseph Emerson  Worcester|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=vXM9AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA703}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cockpit Country''' is an area in [[Trelawny Parish|Trelawny]] and [[Saint Elizabeth Parish|Saint Elizabeth]] parishes in [[Jamaica]]. The land is marked by steep-sided hollows, as much as {{convert|120|m|ft}} deep in places, which are separated by conical hills and ridges. [[Maroon (people)|Maroon]]s who had escaped from plantations used the difficult territory for its natural defenses to develop communities outside the control of [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] or [[British Empire|British]] [[colonialism|colonists]]. Since 1739 it has been the center of [[Accompong]], an indigenous Maroon community that still has a certain recognized autonomy under the independent Jamaican government.

==Geography==
On the north, the main defining feature is the fault-based "Escarpment", a long ridge that extends from Flagstaff in the west, through Windsor in the centre, to Campbells and the start of the Barbecue Bottom Road (B10). The Barbecue Bottom Road, which runs north-south, high along the side of a deep, fault-based valley in the east, is the only drivable route across the Cockpit Country. Walkers and riders can use two old, historical trails cross further west, the Troy Trail, and the Quick Step Trail. As of 2006 they are seldom used and difficult to find.

In the southwest, near Quick Step, is the district known as the "Land of Look Behind." It was so named because Spanish horsemen venturing into this region of hostile escaped slaves were said to have ridden two to a mount, one rider facing to the rear to keep a precautionary watch against ambush.

Where the ridges between sinkholes in the plateau area have dissolved, flat-bottomed basins or valleys have been formed that are filled with [[terra rossa (soil)|terra rosa]] soils, some of the most productive on the island. The largest basin is the Vale of Clarendon, {{convert|80|km|mi}} long and {{convert|32|km|mi}} wide. Queen of Spains Valley, [[Nassau Valley]], and Cave Valley were formed by the same process.

Shallow caves, known locally as cockpits (based on pits used for [[cockfights]]), are particularly common around the hamlet of Quick Step, reaching a density of 15 per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Jamaica Underground: The Caves, Sinkholes and Underground Rivers of the Island, by Alan Fincham (page 31). &lt;/ref&gt; Noteworthy caves include Marta Tick Cave&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jamaicancaves.org/martatick.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and Minocal's Glory Hole&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jamaicancaves.org/minocals_050115.htm&lt;/ref&gt;. Ecotourism has been proposed for the hamlet of Quick Step, at the end of the road into the heart of Cockpit County.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cockpitcountry.com/Quickstep.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environment==
The Cockpit Country is Jamaica's largest remaining contiguous [[rainforest]]. In 1979 an unpublished paper proposed preserving the area as a National Park.&lt;ref&gt;Cotterell "The Proposed Development of the Cockpit Country." Unpublished. NRCD, Kingston, Jamaica. 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994 the geographer [[Alan Eyre]]&lt;ref&gt;Eyre, ''Slow Death of a Tropical Rainforest: The Cockpit Country of Jamaica, West Indies,'' 1994&lt;/ref&gt; proposed that the Cockpit Country be designated as a [[World Heritage Site]] to preserve its environment. A petition for protection of the area was submitted to Prime Minister [[Bruce Golding]] in 2006.

As of April 2013, public consultations have begun on the definition of the boundary proposed in a recently released study by Mitchell, Miller, Ganapathy, and Spence of the [[University of the West Indies]] (UWI).

'''Dancon''', an [[abbreviation]] of '''Danish Contingent''', is the term that comprises all [[Denmark|Danish]] national forces in a current military mission of the [[UN]], [[NATO]], or national character. Dancon is not a military unit per se, like a [[brigade]], but rather an organisation in which all [[Military organization#Units, Formations &amp; Commands|military units]] currently working in a mission are linked together. The [[commander]] of Dancon is usually the commander of the hierarchically biggest military unit associated with the specified mission, and does not have a headquarters of its own, but rather it is that military unit's headquarters.

Because several Dancons can exist at the same time, the mission name is usually added to Dancon, like [[Dancon/Irak]] or [[Dancon/SFOR]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="768">'''''Fakta fra verden''''' ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] for "Facts from the world") is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[comic strip]] written and drawn by [[Karstein Volle]], since 2001.

The comic has an [[education]]al theme and each episode is written and drawn like an educational message. However, the facts that the strip claims to present are always completely absurd.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3268">Following independence, the government of [[Guinea]] adopted rules of transcription for the [[languages of Guinea]] based on the characters and diacritic combinations available on typewriters of that period.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} This alphabet was used officially until 1989.

==Guinea language orthography==
The Guinea alphabet made use of several [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] (including either "h" or "y" as the second letter), some of which represent consonants not present in European languages, and two [[diacritic]]s ([[grave accent]] and [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]]) for open vowels. 

This system was widely used within the country but differed from the orthographies of neighboring countries of [[West Africa]], as developed in the wake of the 1966 Bamako expert meeting on harmonizing orthographies of the [[cross-border language]]s of the region. 

In 1989, following a meeting on reform of the alphabet in 1988,&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert Sâa Ifono, "L'activité terminologique en Guinée," [http://www.termisti.org/rifal/PDF/tn09/tn09.pdf RINT 9, June 1993]&lt;/ref&gt; it was decided to adopt an orthography similar to the [[African reference alphabet]] used elsewhere in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Diallo, Alpha Mamadou, ''Usages et images des langues en guinée'', Université de Conakry. [http://www.unice.fr/ILF-CNRS/ofcaf/19/DIALLO.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diallo, Amadou; ''Étude sur le rôle de l'éducation non formelle dans la stratégie de réduction de la pauvreté (SRP) en Guinée'', Ministère du Plan de la République de Guinée/ GTZ, Conakry 3/2006. [http://www.srp-guinee.org/download/diallo-education-non-formelle-et-srp.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Effectuated by decree 019/PRG/SGG/89&lt;/ref&gt;

A summary table of the digraphs and diacritics of the old alphabet, and their extended Latin equivalents in the new system, follows:

'''Indulis''' is a [[Latvian masculine given name]], borne by more than 1,000 men in [[Latvia]].&lt;ref&gt;PMLP database&lt;/ref&gt; Its nameday is celebrated on 2 January.

The name has two possible derivations, one from a Baltic word meaning "gift", and the other as a diminutive of Indriķis, the Latvian form of [[Heinrich (given name)|Heinrich]].

Indulis was the name of the hero of the legend of Indulis and Ārija, the Latvian [[Romeo and Juliet]], set in the 13th century during the [[Germany|German]] conquest, which relates the tragic love of Indulis, a [[Curonians|Curonian]] chieftain, and Ārija, daughter of a German military commander. The name was revived, along with many other medieval names, in the late 19th century, and was brought to especial prominence by the poet and dramatist [[Rainis]] with the publication in 1911 of his play ''"Indulis un Ārija"''.

As a modern name, Indulis is better-known than many Latvian names because of [[Indulis Emsis]], Prime Minister of Latvia in 2004, the first [[Latvian Green Party|Green]] head of state in the world.

'''Intelsat IV F-6''' was a [[geostationary]] [[communication]] [[satellite]] built by [[Hughes Aircraft Company|Hughes]], it was owned by [[Intelsat]]. The satellite was based on the [[Spacebus|HS-312]] platform and its estimated useful life was 7 years.

== History ==
The Intelsat IV F-6 was part of the Intelsat IV series which consisted of eight communications satellites, launched from [[Cape Canaveral]] during the early 1970s, marked the fifth generation of geostationary communications satellites developed by the [[Hughes Aircraft Company]] since 1963 with the launch of Syncom II, the world's first synchronous satellite. The [[Syncom]] II was 15&amp;nbsp;cm high and 28 inches in diameter, weighing 78 pounds in orbit. In contrast, the Intelsat IVs weighed more than [[Pound (mass)|£]] 1,300 (595&amp;nbsp;kg) into orbit and were more than 17 feet (5.31 meters) in diameter. All seven satellites exceeded their projected life expectancies and were withdrawn from active duty, the last of which, the [[Intelsat IV F-1]] was retired in October 1987.

The satellite was equipped with 12 [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]] transponders. It had 6,000 two-way [[relay]] phone calls or broadcast 12 concurrent color television programs or mixed combinations of communications traffic including data and fax.

The satellite had 12 channels of broadband communication. Each channel had a bandwidth of 40&amp;nbsp;MHz and provided about 500 communication circuits.

== Release ==

The satellite was lost due to a launcher malfunction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ezell |first1=Linda Neuman |title=NASA Historical Databook |volume=Volume III: Programs and Projects 1969-1978 |publisher=NASA |publication-date=1988-01-01 |at=Table 4-103.

'''Míša''' is a popular [[Czech Republic|Czech]] brand of frozen confection. Míšas have been made continuously since 1961, and sell over 12 million ice pops per year, making it the most successful [[ice cream]] brand in the Czech Republic. It has survived events such as the [[Velvet Revolution]] and is fondly remembered as an integral part of Czech childhood.&lt;ref name="unilever.cz"&gt;{{cite web|title=MÍŠA|url=http://www.unilever.cz/our-brands/detail/misa/309234//|website=Unilever.cz|accessdate=2014-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are made with frozen quark, rather than ice cream or yogurt.&lt;ref name="unilever.cz"/&gt;

The [[logo]] features a grinning green [[bear]] as the brand's mascot, holding its [[arm]]s above the word "Míša."&lt;ref name="unilever.cz"/&gt;

'''Near FM''' (North East Access Radio) 90.3 FM is a [[Broadcasting Authority of Ireland|BAI]]-licensed, communally owned, and not-for-profit community media project.

The project is operated by a democratic co-operative, Near Media Co-op, and is open to all organisations and individuals in [[Dublin]] North-East, [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].

The station provides a wide range of specialist music programmes (blues, punk, ska etc.) as well as a variety of talk programming, incorporating a positive emphasis on facilitating and supporting community development and providing a platform to a wide range of local groups.

Previously known as ''Near fm 101.6'', the station first went on air in August 1995. On Tuesday 23 January 2007, the station switched to a new frequency of 90.3 MHz and was renamed ''Near90fm''. In 2012, the station reverted to using its former ''Near FM'' name.

Near Media Co-op also runs a community television project – Near TV Productions – and an IT project called Near Online. The station also runs an internet cafe in the Northside Civic Centre, [[Coolock]], where the project is based, as well as the Near Drama, Near Records, and Near Choice projects.

Near fm is a founding member of [[CRAOL]], The Community Radio Forum of Ireland. 

In the 1980s there was an [[Irish_pirate_radio|pirate radio]] station which NEAR FM is based on called, ''North Dublin Community Radio'' it closed down in order to reform as NEAR FM and apply for a licence.

The '''Pohokura field''' is an oil and gas field located 4 km offshore of north [[Taranaki Region|Taranaki]] in [[New Zealand]], in approximately 30 m of water.  The field was discovered in 2000 by Fletcher Challenge and has ultimate recoverable reserves (1P) of 1,227 Bcf (1435 PJ) of gas and 61 mmbbls of oil and condensate.&lt;ref name="Energy2015" &gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mbie.govt.nz/info-services/sectors-industries/energy/energy-data-modelling/publications/energy-in-new-zealand| title=Energy in New Zealand 2015| publisher=[[Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment|MBIE]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The field has 6 offshore and 3 onshore wells, with the production station located on shore, adjacent to the [[Motunui]] methanol plant.  The production station is unmanned, and is operated from a control room in [[New Plymouth]].  The first commercial production was in September 2006.

In 2009, Pohokura was the largest gas producing field in New Zealand, producing 42% of total production.&lt;ref name="EDF"&gt;{{cite book| title=Energy Data File| publisher=[[Ministry of Economic Development (New Zealand)|MED]]| date=July 2009| url=http://www.med.govt.nz/edf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pohokura is owned by Shell (48%), OMV (26%) and [[Todd Corporation|Todd Energy]] (26%), and is operated by Shell.&lt;ref name="Energy2015" /&gt;

}}'''The Schistosomiasis Control Initiative (SCI)''', at Imperial College London, is a non-profit initiative that works with Ministries of Health in sub-Saharan African countries and Yemen. It supports and evaluates treatment programmes against [[schistosomiasis]] and [[Soil-transmitted helminthiasis|soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH).]]

These parasitic infections are part of a group called “Neglected Tropical Diseases”, which affect the poorest and most marginalised communities in the world. They can impair a child’s development, reduce school attendance and productivity, and even cause internal organ damage.

Estimates suggest that over 1 billion people are infected by these diseases. However, treatment is safe, effective and can reverse the damaging effects of infections, and costs as little as £1 for three people.  In fact, the SCI has been recommended by the charity evaluator [https://www.givewell.org/ GiveWell], as one of the world’s most cost-effective non-profits to receive donations.

The impact of SCI-supported treatment programmes is observed quickly. The number of people infected by these parasites can be reduced by up to 60% after the first round of treatment and sustained below 11% after two rounds of treatment.

SCI continually conducts research to assess programme performance and investigate novel approaches to disease management. This ensures that control strategies are optimised and will ultimately lead to disease elimination.

==History&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imperial.ac.uk/schistosomiasis-control-initiative/about&lt;/ref&gt;==
In 2002, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundations Global Health Programme granted a £20 million award to establish the SCI at Imperial College London. SCI assisted the Ministries of Health and Education to deliver treatment for schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis in 6 countries, targeting school-aged children and adults at high risk of infection.

In 2006, the SCI was a founding partner of the [[Global Network for Neglected Tropical Diseases]] which promoted integration of control or elimination programmes against seven NTDs.

By 2007, the SCI had facilitated delivery of approximately 40 million treatments of [[praziquantel]] against schistosomiasis, and many more deworming doses of [[albendazole]].

In 2010, SCI expanded its reach after the award of the management of [http://www.imperial.ac.uk/schistosomiasis-control-initiative/our-work/projects/ ICOSA] - a programme funded by the Department for International Development (DFID). ICOSA delivered 203 million treatments against schistosomiasis and STH in 10 sub-Saharan African countries by December 2018.

In April 2013, SCI announced that it had facilitated delivery of its [http://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/121788/imperial-group-reaches-milestone-tropical-disease/ 100 millionth treatment of praziquantel against schistosomiasis] thanks to funding from private donations which complemented the ICOSA award.

By 2016, SCI had reached an annual delivery of over 50 million treatments for schistosomiasis and STH.

==Plot==
Jakub is a daydreamer in his early 30s and is still living with his father. The father is tired of Jakub's idleness and throws him out of the flat. He tells Jakub to sell the old garden of his grandfather and to buy his own flat. Jakub retires into the neglected garden and retreats into the worn garden house from the world and from his problems. The garden turns out to be a magical place full of surprises and mysteries. Jakub stumbles across his grandfather’s journal which is written in reverse script. He finds a map leading him to an old bottle of slivovice hidden years ago. Now curious Jakub must solve the mysteries of his grandfather’s garden. He meets Helena, a young girl Jakub’s grandfather taught to also write backwards. Strange things happen in the garden, and some of them do indeed seem like miracles. Amid the eccentric events, young Helena teaches Jakub to appreciate the delicate mysteries of life. In the end Jakub loses all his possessions but finds his peace.

'''USA-38''', also known as '''GPS II-2''' and '''GPS SVN-13''', was an [[United States|American]] [[navigation satellite]] which formed part of the [[Global Positioning System]]. It was the second of nine [[GPS Block II|Block II]] GPS satellites to be launched, which were the first operational GPS satellites to be launched.

USA-38 was launched at 22:19 UTC on 10 June 1989, atop a [[Delta II]] carrier rocket, flight number D185, flying in the 6925 configuration.&lt;ref name="LL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/launchlog.txt|title=Launch Log|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch took place from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 17|Launch Complex 17A]] at the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]],&lt;ref name="lvdb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/lvdb/list2.html|title=Launch List|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|work=Launch Vehicle Database|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and placed USA-38 into a transfer orbit. The satellite raised itself into [[medium Earth orbit]] using a [[Star-37XFP]] [[apogee motor]].&lt;ref name="GSP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/navstar-2.htm|title=GPS-2 (Navstar-2)|first=Gunter|last=Krebs|work=Gunter's Space Page|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 July 1989, USA-38 was in an orbit with a [[apsis|perigee]] of {{convert|19967|km}}, an [[apsis|apogee]] of {{convert|20395|km}}, a [[orbital period|period]] of 717.92 minutes, and 54.5 degrees of [[inclination]] to the equator.&lt;ref name="satcat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/satcat.txt|title=Satellite Catalog|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It operated in slot 3 of plane B of the GPS constellation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceandtech.com/spacedata/constellations/navstar-gps_consum.shtml|title=NAVSTAR GPS - Summary|publisher=Space and Tech|accessdate=10 July 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615061419/http://www.spaceandtech.com/spacedata/constellations/navstar-gps_consum.shtml|archivedate=15 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The satellite had a mass of {{convert|840|kg}}, and generated 710 watts of power.&lt;ref name="NSSDC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1989-044A|title=Navstar 2-02|publisher=US National Space Science Data Center|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had a design life of 7.5 years,&lt;ref name="GSP"/&gt; and ceased operations on 12 May 2004.
