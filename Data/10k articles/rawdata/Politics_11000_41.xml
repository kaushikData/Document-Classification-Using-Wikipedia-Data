      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4598">'''Administrative resource''' is the ability of [[political candidate]]s (and [[political party|parties]]) to use their official positions or connections to government institutions to influence the outcome of [[election]]s.

The term is widely used in [[Russia]] and other former [[USSR]] countries, because the practice is widespread, is well known and is openly discussed by public and media. In these countries, the administrative resource is one of the major factors in most elections. Although similar practices of corruption are conducted throughout the world in countries with fragile democracies, the term administrative resource is ascribed almost exclusively to Russia. Moreover, the utilization of administrative resources is generally not considered to be a democratic form of electioneering but in fact as a tool used to undermine democracy.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.newsweek.com/how-putin-agents-undermine-democracy-456133 How Putin’s Agents Undermine Russian Democracy]'', Newsweek&lt;/ref&gt;

The administrative resource is only one part that determines the election outcome. Two other major factors are the [[ideology]] (candidate's agenda) and the use of political technologies ([[Public relations|PR]], campaign organisation, etc.).

Among many different ways the administrative resource can be applied are:
* Mobilisation of organisational and financial resources. The authorities can easily pressure businessmen to fund preferred candidates and parties. Before Russian parliamentary elections the money is often used to create "authorities parties", based not on a particular ideology but on affiliation with the government and easy access to money.
* The laws can be selectively applied to assist friendly candidates, by hindering their competition. The authorities can use frequent tax inspections, police searches and arrests to punish businessmen who fund the competing candidates.
* The authorities can use the election laws to their advantage, for example, by creating a pretext for appealing the results later if the unfavourable candidate is winning. Another option is to stop from voting some groups of people who are likely to vote against the preferred candidate.
* Government controlled organisations, such as the army, prisons, hospitals, public schools, etc. can be mobilised for signature collection and other goals. They can also pressure their employees and customers for voting for particular candidates and exercise control over votes by housing the polling stations.
* Redistribution of budget funds. The authorities can bribe the electorate indirectly by repaying pension debts, indexing salaries, etc. The federal government can control governors by measuring donations to their regions.
* Controlling the [[mass media]]. The heads of states or regions can easily create news topics for media, getting free publicity and circumventing the limits for TV advertisements imposed on all candidates. This method was used with particular effectiveness in [[Russian presidential election, 2004]].
* Falsifying the election results. Additional ballots can be introduced under the names of those who didn't vote, ballots for "wrong" candidate can be invalidated by damaging them, ballots can be replaced. The authorities can also control the staff of the election committees and prevent control by independent observers.

The '''Amakasu Incident''' (''Amakasu jiken'') refers to a crime in which the [[Masahiko Amakasu|Lieutenant Amakasu Masahiko]] was found responsible for the murders of two anarchists and a young boy in September 1923.

== Incident ==

Following Japan's [[Great Kantō earthquake]] in early September 1923, a police squadron led by [[Masahiko Amakasu|Lieutenant Amakasu Masahiko]] sought out two noted anarchist-socialist leaders, the feminist [[Noe Itō]] and her partner, the anarchist [[Sakae Ōsugi]]. Together they were beaten and killed by the police along with Ōsugi's six-year-old nephew, and their bodies disposed in a well. Following countrywide outcry, Amakasu was [[court-martialed]] and sentenced to 10 years in prison. When [[Hirohito]] became [[Emperor of Japan]] three years later, Amakasu was released. He studied in France and became a special agent for the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] in Manchuria.&lt;ref name="Cybriwsky2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cybriwsky|first=Roman|title=Historical Dictionary of Tokyo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9pePrUSs7kMC&amp;pg=PA21|year=2011|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-7489-3|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{broader|Outlier}}
In [[data mining]], '''anomaly detection''' (also '''outlier detection'''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|last=Zimek|first=Arthur|title=Outlier Detection|date=2017|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-1-4899-7993-3_80719-1|work=Encyclopedia of Database Systems|pages=1–5|publisher=Springer New York|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-4899-7993-3_80719-1|isbn=9781489979933|access-date=2018-08-16|last2=Schubert|first2=Erich}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the identification of rare items, events or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Typically the anomalous items will translate to some kind of problem such as [[bank fraud]], a structural defect, medical problems or errors in a text. Anomalies are also referred to as [[outlier]]s, novelties, noise, deviations and exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hodge | first1 = V. J. | last2 = Austin | first2 = J. | doi = 10.1007/s10462-004-4304-y | title = A Survey of Outlier Detection Methodologies | journal = Artificial Intelligence Review| volume = 22 | issue = 2 | pages = 85–126 | year = 2004 | url = http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/767/1/hodgevj4.pdf| pmid =  | pmc = | citeseerx = 10.1.1.318.4023 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, in the context of abuse and network intrusion detection, the interesting objects are often not ''rare'' objects, but unexpected ''bursts'' in activity. This pattern does not adhere to the common statistical definition of an outlier as a rare object, and many outlier detection methods (in particular unsupervised methods) will fail on such data, unless it has been aggregated appropriately. Instead, a [[cluster analysis]] algorithm may be able to detect the micro clusters formed by these patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first=Paul | last=Dokas | first2=Levent |last2=Ertoz |first3=Vipin |last3=Kumar |first4=Aleksandar |last4=Lazarevic |first5=Jaideep |last5=Srivastava |first6=Pang-Ning |last6=Tan | title=Data mining for network intrusion detection | year=2002 | journal=Proceedings NSF Workshop on Next Generation Data Mining | url=http://www.csee.umbc.edu/~kolari1/Mining/ngdm/dokas.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three broad categories of anomaly detection techniques exist.&lt;ref name="ChandolaSurvey"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chandola|first1=V.|last2=Banerjee|first2=A.|last3=Kumar|first3=V.|year=2009|title=Anomaly detection: A survey|journal=[[ACM Computing Surveys]]|volume=41|issue=3|pages=1–58|doi=10.1145/1541880.1541882}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Unsupervised anomaly detection''' techniques detect anomalies in an unlabeled test data set under the assumption that the majority of the instances in the data set are normal by looking for instances that seem to fit least to the remainder of the data set. '''Supervised anomaly detection''' techniques require a data set that has been labeled as "normal" and "abnormal" and involves training a classifier (the key difference to many other [[statistical classification]] problems is the inherent unbalanced nature of outlier detection). '''Semi-supervised anomaly detection''' techniques construct a model representing normal behavior from a given ''normal'' training data set, and then test the likelihood of a test instance to be generated by the learnt model.

== Applications ==
Anomaly detection is applicable in a variety of domains, such as [[intrusion detection]], [[fraud detection]], fault detection, system health monitoring, event detection in sensor networks, and detecting ecosystem disturbances. It is often used in preprocessing to remove anomalous data from the dataset. In [[supervised learning]], removing the anomalous data from the dataset often results in a statistically significant increase in accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1109/TSMC.1976.4309523 | first = Ivan | last = Tomek| title = An Experiment with the Edited Nearest-Neighbor Rule | journal = [[IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics]]| volume = 6 | issue = 6 | pages = 448–452 | year = 1976 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Smith | first1 = M.

== Popular techniques ==
Several anomaly detection techniques have been proposed in literature.&lt;ref name="ZimekFilzmoser2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zimek|first1=Arthur|last2=Filzmoser|first2=Peter|title=There and back again: Outlier detection between statistical reasoning and data mining algorithms|journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery|volume=8|issue=6|year=2018|pages=e1280|issn=19424787|doi=10.1002/widm.1280}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the popular techniques are:

== Application to data security ==
Anomaly detection was proposed for [[intrusion detection systems]] (IDS) by [[Dorothy E. Denning|Dorothy Denning]] in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Denning | first1 = D.

The '''Argentine National Gendarmerie''' ({{lang-es|Gendarmería Nacional Argentina}}, '''GNA''') is the [[gendarmerie]] and corps of [[border guards]] of [[Argentina]].

The Argentine National Gendarmerie has a strength of 70,000.

The Gendarmerie is primarily a frontier guard force but also fulfils other important roles. The force functions from what are today five regional headquarters at [[Campo de Mayo]], [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]], [[Rosario]], [[San Miguel de Tucumán]] and [[Bahía Blanca]].

==Personnel and training==
Non-commissioned personnel of the Gendarmerie are all volunteers and receive their training in the force's own comprehensive system of training institutions. Officers graduate after a three-year course at the National Gendarmerie Academy. Both officers and non-commissioned personnel have access to the specialist training establishments of the [[Argentine Army|Army]].

==History==
[[File:Personal-Gendarmeria-Nacional-Argentina.jpg|thumb|300px|Argentine Gendarmes in [[Oberá]] in [[Misiones]]]]

The Gendarmerie was created in 1938 by the [[Argentine National Congress|National Congress]], and replaced the regiments of the Army which previously fulfilled the Gendarmerie's missions. The Gendarmerie was particularly tasked with providing security in isolated and sparsely populated frontier regions which had only been settled relatively recently. In many senses the Gendarmerie may still be considered an adjunct of the Argentine Army.

==Activities==
&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Argentine GNA 01.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The emblem of the Argentine National Gendarmerie]] --&gt;

The Gendarmerie's mission and functions are concerned with both domestic security and national defense.

According to the [[Constitution of Argentina|Argentine Constitution]], the [[Military of Argentina|armed forces]] cannot intervene in internal civil conflicts, so the Gendarmerie is subordinate to the Interior Ministry. It is defined as a civilian "security force of a military nature". It maintains a functional relationship with the Ministry of Defense, as part of both the National Defense System and the [[Sistema de Seguridad Interior|Interior Security System]]. It therefore maintains capabilities arising from the demands required by joint military planning with the armed forces.

The Gendarmerie's main missions are:
*Providing security for Argentina's borders
*Providing security for places of national strategic importance (e.g. [[nuclear plant]]s)

The Gendarmerie is also used for other security missions, which include:

*Policing missions:
**Assisting [[Provinces of Argentina|provincial]] police services in maintaining public security in rural areas
**Preventing [[smuggling]]
**Fighting [[Illegal drug trade|drug trafficking]]
**Fighting terrorism
**Fighting crimes "against life and freedom" (children and organs trade, slavery, etc.)
**Dealing with economic crime
**Dealing with environmental crime
**Dealing with illegal immigration
*Military missions:
**War-fighting missions (e.g. in the [[Falklands War]])
**[[Peacekeeping]] or [[humanitarian aid]] missions under the [[United Nations]]
**Providing security for Argentine embassies and consulates in several foreign nations

Under the United Nations, the Gendarmerie has served in [[Guatemala]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Croatia]], [[Angola]], [[Lebanon]], [[Rwanda]] and [[Haiti]].

==Organization==

===High Command===
The high command includes:

*The National Director: As of 2016, the National Director is [[Commandant-General]] [[Gerardo Jose Otero]].
*The Deputy National Director: As of 2016, the Deputy National Director is Commandant-General [[Federico Sosa]].
*The General and Special Staff of the National Directorate of the Gendarmerie.

===Rank structure===
The ranks of the Argentine Gendarmerie, in ascending order, are:

'''Sub-Officer Ranks'''

{|id="toc"
!width="16%" align="left" |Rank
!width="16%" align="left" |Approximate English translation
|-
|-
|align="left" |''Cabo''
|align="left" |[[Corporal]]
|-
|align="left" |''Cabo Primero''
|align="left" |Corporal First Class
|-
|align="left" |''Sargento''
|align="left" |[[Sergeant]]
|-
|align="left" |''Sargento Primero''
|align="left" |Sergeant First Class
|-
|align="left" |''Sargento Ayudante''
|align="left" |Sergeant-[[Adjutant]]
|-
|align="left" |''Suboficial Principal''
|align="left" |Principal Sub-Officer
|-
|align="left" |''Suboficial Mayor''
|align="left" |Sub-Officer-Major
|}

The ranks up to and including sergeant are classified as Subaltern Sub-Officers (''Suboficiales Subalternos''), and the remainder are classified as Superior Sub-Officers (''Suboficiales Superiores''). The sub-officer ranks are the same as Argentine army ranks, and wear the same insignia, but with a much thicker gold band for a Gendarmerie Principal Sub-Officer than is used in the Army.

'''Officer Ranks'''

|align="left" |[[Brigade General]]
|-
|align="left" |
|align="left" |
|align="left" |(Deputy National Director = [[Divisional General]],
and National Director = [[Lieutenant-General]])
|}

The ranks up to and including ''Segundo Comandante'' are classified as Subaltern Officers (''Oficiales Subalternos''). Gendarmerie officers wear the same insignia as the equivalent  Argentine Army rank. The National Director and his Deputy wear the insignia of an Argentine Lieutenant-General and Divisional General respectively, although they still have the rank of Commandant-General. (NB: Lieutenant-General is the highest Argentine Army rank.)

===Unit structure===
*A [[Platoon (military unit)|Section]] (Spanish: ''pelotón'') is a [[squad]] of several men.
*A Group (Spanish: ''grupo'') consists of several sections and is the basic operational unit of the Gendarmerie.
*A [[Squadron (army)|Squadron]] (Spanish: ''escuadrón'') consists of three groups.
*A Grouping (Spanish: ''agrupación'') consists of several squadrons. This may be thought of as roughly corresponding to the level of command of a [[battalion]] or [[regiment]].
*Above the groupings are the regional commands and the staff of the National Directorate.

===Operational units===
*Regional Headquarters
*Mobile Units
*[[Special Forces]] Units: [[Grupo Alacrán]]
*Intelligence Squadron
*[[Highway patrol|Highway Security Section]]s
*Environment Protection Service
*Mountain Rescue Groups
*Scrubland Special Section

===Support units===
*Logistics Squadron
*Telecommunications and Computer Service
*Expert Investigation Service
*Aviation Service
*Medical Assistance Service

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5896">[[File:Jännerstreik 1918 in Wiener Neustadt.png|thumb|right|Striking workers assembling outside the Town Hall, Wiener Neustadt, 14 January 1918]]
The '''1918 Austro-Hungarian January Strike''' was a strike which spread across the [[Austro-Hungarian empire]] between January 3 and 25, 1918 demanding better living and working conditions and an end to the [[First World War]]. It is known as the "Jännerstreik" as opposed to the "[[German strike of January 1918|Januarstreik]]" – a similar strike movement which lasted from 25 January to 1 February 1918 in Germany - Jänner being the usual spelling for January in Austria.

==Prelude==
There had been strikes in early 1917 by Viennese workers in response to food shortages. However by the winter of 1917 the situation had got worse. However news of the [[October revolution|Bolshevik seizure of power in Russia]] encouraged workers in [[Vienna]] and more generally across Europe to emulate their example with the demand that the war be ended or more strikes would be organised.&lt;ref name="rw"&gt;{{cite web |title=Jännerstreik-1918 |url=http://www.dasrotewien.at/seite/jaennerstreik-1918 |website=www.dasrotewien.at|publisher=SPÖ Vienna |accessdate=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leadership of the [[SPÖ|Sozialdemokratische Arbeiterpartei Österreichs]] (SDAPÖ) was slow to react although the youth wing of the party started to organise and local sections also prepared for action. In early January the party took a clearer anti-war position, particularly in relation to the [[Brest-Litovsk Treaty|Brest-Litovsk negotiations]] and convened three large meetings in Vienna on Sunday 13 January. On 6 January a demonstration by 4,000 angry Hungarian workers in [[Budapest]] occurred outside the [[German empire|German]] Consulate.&lt;ref name="Chernev"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chernev |first1=Borislav |title=Twilight of Empire: The Brest-Litovsk Conference and the Remaking of East-Central Europe, 1917–1918 |date=2017 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |location=Toronto |isbn=9781487501495 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mc3hDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA86&amp;lpg=PA86&amp;dq=%22General+Anton+H%C3%B6fer%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3Of1GX48sV&amp;sig=2_FLk2AbRNkui4R3seLBZLOBcz8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjhhdjalprcAhWBVxQKHeA1CsYQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22General%20Anton%20H%C3%B6fer%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=13 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They actively supported the peace plan of the Bolshevik negotiator, [[Adolph_Joffe#Brest-Litovsk|Adolph Joffe]], and several window of the consulate were smashed. By the 13 January, the three large meetings had grown to five and the topic was "The Peace Negotiation in Brest-Litovsk and Social Democracy". Ellenbogen, Domes and [[Karl Renner]] delivered speeches where they said that a victorious peace was impossible. However they were heckled by workers calling out "Long LIve the Austrian Revolution".&lt;ref name="Chernev"/&gt;

==The strike begins==
When the flour ration was halved on 14 January 1918 the workers in [[Wiener Neustadt]], particularly the 4,500 working for [[Austro-Daimler]] downed tools and went on strike. The strike soon spread to the nearby [[Wiener Neustädter Lokomotivfabrik]] and through factories in [[Lower Austria]] and to the [[Lokomotivfabrik Floridsdorf]] which employed over 1,000 workers in [[Vienna]].&lt;ref name="ÖSTA"&gt;{{cite web |title=Jännerstreik 1918 |url=http://wk1.staatsarchiv.at/revolten-und-politische-proteste/jaennerstreik-1918/#/?a=artefactgroup452 |website=wk1.staatsarchiv.at |publisher=Austrian State Archives |accessdate=11 July 2018 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno?aid=aze&amp;datum=19180116&amp;seite=1&amp;zoom=33 “Arbeiter und Arbeiterinnen!” Arbeiter Zeitung, 16 January 1918]&lt;/ref&gt; By 18 January over 110,000 of the total Viennese workforce of 350,000-370,000 people were on strike. From the strike meetings [[workers' councils]] were established as a form of [[participatory democracy]]. The executive of the [[SPÖ|Sozialdemokratische Arbeiterpartei Österreichs]] (SDAPÖ) had drawn up a list demands to be presented to the government. These were accepted by the workers' council. On January 19, Workers' Council received a delegation led by Count [[Ottokar Czernin]], the [[Foreign Ministry of Austria-Hungary|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] who promised that territorial demands would not jeopardise the peace negotiations. The [[Minister-president]], [[Ernst Seidler von Feuchtenegg]] promised to reform the war benefits and to establish a food service and the democratisation of municipal election law. In a turbulent session during the night of Saturday 19-20 January, the Workers' Council accepted the SDAPÖ proposal to call the workforce to resume work on Monday, January 21.

==The strike in Hungary==
The strike was started by [[Budapest]] [[street car]] workers on the morning of 18th January. They were protesting about the ban on reports of the events in Austria. By noon the strike had spread across all industries, and 40,000 workers took part in fifteen different demonstration which were prevented by the police from converging on the centre of Budapest. The [[Hungarian Social Democratic Party]] declared a general strike. The following day the strike spread to [[Nagykanizsa]] and [[Szeged]].&lt;ref name="Chernev"/&gt;

'''''Benisek v. Lamone''''', 585 U.S. ____ (2018), was a case before the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] dealing with the topic of partisan [[gerrymandering]], the second case heard in the [[2017 term opinions of the Supreme Court of the United States|2017–2018 term]] following ''[[Gill v. Whitford]]'', which had been heard by the Court prior to accepting this case in December 2017.

The case centers on the redistricting of the state of [[Maryland]], drawn up by the prevailing [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic party]] in 2011, which diluted the number of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] voters in the [[Maryland's 6th congressional district|6th district]] that had historically voted for Republican candidates. Affected voters filed suit, stating that the redistricting violated their right of representation under [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article One, Section Two of the U.S. Constitution]] and [[freedom of association]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].

The original suit, filed in 2013, was rejected in both federal District and Appeals Courts, ruling that the voters had failed to state a claim to be ruled upon, but the Supreme Court remanded the case back to the Appeals Court in 2015, stating that the lower courts had not properly weighed the partisan gerrymandering claims. As part of the second trial, which started in 2016, the plaintiffs had asked the Appeals Court to block the use of the 2011 district map in anticipation of the 2018 election, but the Court denied the injunction, and with the Supreme Court having accepted to hear ''Gill v. Whitford'', put the case on hold until the Supreme Court's decision was announced. The plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court on the denial of the injunction related to the map, leading the Supreme Court to accept the case and hear the merits of their complaints.

The Court issued a [[per curiam decision|''per curiam'' decision]] on June 18, 2018, finding that the Appeals Court's denial of the injunction was not improper, but otherwise did not weigh in on the merits of the gerrymandering aspects. The District Court has since ruled that the redistricting map was unconstitutional, ordering the state to draw a new map by March 2019. The order is being challenged by the state's Democratic attorney general [[Brian Frosh]].

==Background==
{{see also|Gill v. Whitford#Background|l1=Background of ''Gill v. Whitford''}}
In the United States, the number of Representatives within the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] that serve a state is based on the results of the [[United States Census]], run every ten years. This leads to [[redistricting]], changes in the boundaries of the state's district. Redistricting is typically done by representatives of the political party in power within the state, and can result in the practice of [[gerrymandering]], creating oddly-shaped districts that help to favor the party's chances for election due to the population distribution within them. The Supreme Court has ruled that gerrymandering based on racial and ethnic grounds is unconstitutional, and had stated that partisan gerrymandering is also likely unconstitutional, but has yet to develop a valid means to determine when partisan gerrymandering has occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/05/politics/supreme-court-gerrymandered-districts/index.html|title=Supreme Court tackles racial gerrymander cases|last=Reporter|first=Ariane de Vogue, CNN Supreme Court|website=CNN|access-date=2016-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maryland redistricting==
For the 2010 Census, the Census Bureau recommended states to count incarcerated prisoners to be living in the location of their group quarters, rather than at their home location. Within Maryland, most prisoners are [[African-American]], and the largest prisoner populations were located in the state's [[Maryland's 4th congressional district|4th]] and [[Maryland's 6th congressional district|6th]] districts, which are otherwise predominately populated by Caucasians. Because prisoners do not have the right to vote but would be counted as residents of those districts, this created concerns that "prison-based gerrymandering," where those districts would be overrepresented in elections, and districts containing the metropolitan areas like Baltimore where most of these prisoners originated would be underrepresented. Maryland passed the first-of-its-kind civil act, the "No Representation Without Population Act", which would have prisoners counted in the Census within their home district instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/14/AR2010041404600.html|title=Maryland changes how prisoners are counted in census|first=Carol|last=Morello|date=April 15, 2010|accessdate=March 28, 2018|work=[[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maryland has traditionally been a Democratic-heavy state, and according to [[FiveThirtyEight]], non-gerrymandered or proportionally partisan districts in Maryland could range from four to six likely Democrat seats,&lt;ref name=FiveThirtyEight&gt;{{cite web|url=https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-maps/maryland/|publisher=FiveThirtyEight|accessdate=June 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that a proper redistricting of the state's eight districts would end up with four to six districts favoring Democrats, and two to four either favoring Republicans or remaining competitive. Democratic analysts envisioned the possibility of an "8-0 map" which aspired to shut Republicans out of elections altogether; however, this may have endangered some incumbents, who rejected the proposal because they wanted to stay in office more easily.&lt;ref name=TheAtlantic&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/06/how-deep-blue-maryland-shows-redistricting-is-broken/531492/|title=How Democrats Gerrymandered Their Way to Victory in Maryland|publisher=[[The Atlantic]]|author=Dave Daley|date=June 25, 2017|accessdate=June 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Democratic leaders suggested the potential to create a district map that give Democrats seven districts to the Republican's one, the "7-1 map". The state Democrats drew on services from [[National Committee for an Effective Congress]] (NCEC) to determine how to create this "7-1 map".&lt;ref name="atlantic 2017"/&gt; This primarily came down to how to redistrict the current two Republican-leaning districts, the [[Maryland's 1st congressional district|1st]] and the 6th, with mapmakers settling on the 6th since redistricting the 1st would require them to draw district lines across [[Chesapeake Bay]].&lt;ref name="atlantic 2017"/&gt; Ultimately, a 7-1 map favoring Democrats was implemented.&lt;ref name=FiveThirtyEight/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheAtlantic/&gt;

==First legal challenge==

The new redistricting was initially challenged in ''Fletcher v. Lamone'', raised by a number of African-American voters who believed that the new map diluted the strength of the African-American vote, violating the equal representation under [[Article One of the United States Constitution]], equal protection from the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] and equal voting rights from the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|15th Amendment]]. They further challenged the "No Representation Without Population Act", believing this further constituted a dilution of their vote. The case was heard by a three-judge panel at the [[United States District Court for the District of Maryland|District Court of Maryland]] in December 2011, and in a unanimous decision, the District Court found in favor of the state, issuing a [[summary judgement]] that asserted the plaintiffs has not shown harm by the new district map nor from the Act.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13044246681863733884&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr RWT-11cv3220]&lt;/ref&gt; On appeal to the Supreme Court, the Court issues a summary disposition that upheld the District Court's ruling.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15573953002986309908&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr 11-1178. 133 S.Ct. 29 (2012)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/beginning-of-the-end-for-prison-based-gerrymandering/2012/07/13/gJQAJP7fiW_story.html | title = Beginning of the end for ‘prison-based gerrymandering’ | first = Peter | last= Wagner | date =July 13, 2012 | accessdate = March 28, 2018 | work = [[The Washington Post]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second legal challenge==

[[File:United States Congressional Districts in Maryland (2003–2013).tiff|thumb|right|The district map of Maryland from 2003 to 2013]]
[[File:Maryland Congressional Districts, 113th Congress.tif|thumb|right|The district map of Maryland as of 2013]]
However a separate challenge arose from other residents of the state in 2013. Aware the District Court of Maryland had ruled the redistricting map was not considered partisan from ''Fletcher v. Lamone'', these citizens challenged the redistricting's use of "narrow ribbons and orifices" that were used to connect non-contiguous regions with non-consistent population distribution that occurred in the state's 4th, 6th, [[Maryland's 7th congressional district|7th]], and [[Maryland's 8th congressional district|8th]] districts.&lt;ref name="brennancenter.org"&gt;[https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legal-work/D.Md_Shapiro_1st_Complaint.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular concern was the 6th district. Previously it covered most of the rural northwestern part of the state along the Pennsylvanian border, and was a predominately Republican district with a high Caucasian population that supported Representative [[Roscoe Bartlett]] for two decades. After redistricting, the 6th still covered the western arm of the state, but now include many of the suburban and metropolitan areas across the border from [[Washington D.C.]], increasing the population of African-American voters within it; the number of registered Republicans dropped by 70,000 voters, roughly 20% of the registered voters in the district. As a result, Bartlett lost his seat to Democrat [[John Delaney (Maryland politician)|John Delancy]] in the 2012 elections by more than 20% of the vote.&lt;ref name="atlantic 2017"&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/06/how-deep-blue-maryland-shows-redistricting-is-broken/531492/ | title = How Democrats Gerrymandered Their Way to Victory in Maryland | first=  Dave | last = Daley |date =June 25, 2017 | accessdate = March 28, 2018 | work = [[The Atlantic]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The complaint stated that because these districts that were predominately Republican had been remapped to swing predominately Democratic, the redistricting map violated their rights of equal representation, the right to vote under the 14th Amendment, and the rights of association under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|1st Amendment]].&lt;ref name="brennancenter.org"/&gt;

The case, filed as ''Benisek v. Mack'', was reviewed by Judge [[James K. Bredar]], who deemed that none of the complaints brought by the plaintiffs were not actionable and denied the request for a standard three-judge hearing in April 2014. Judge Bredar did find that the case represented a substantially different subset of residents of ''Fletcher'' and rejected the defense's argument for ''[[res judicata]]''. In regards to the plaintiffs' arguments, Judge Bredar found that the plaintiffs did not provide an effective measure to demonstrate partisan gerrymandering as suggested by ''[[Vieth v. Jubelirer]]'', nullifying their Article One and 14th Amendment claims, and that the citizens affects still had their rights to participate in the political process, denying any relief for the 1st Amendment claim.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12532690538911722170&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr]&lt;/ref&gt; The plaintiffs appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit|Fourth Circuit Appeals Court]], but the appeal was summarily denied in October 2014 on the basis that there claims were insubstantial as determined by Bredar.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3734961500851970470&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr]&lt;/ref&gt; The plaintiffs issued a petition for writ of ''[[certiorari]]'' from the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], arguing that because the Districts Courts are required to hear any substantial constitutional challenges to state redistricting under Section 2284 of [[Title 28 of the United States Code|Title 28]], the Appeals Court dismissal on the insubstantial claim was inappropriate.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legal-work/Shapiro_Writ_Petitition.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The case, ''[[Shapiro v. McManus]]'', was accepted by the Supreme Court in June 2015, with oral arguments in November 2015 and the decision issued in December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/dc-law-student-takes-case-against-md-gerrymandering-to-supreme-court/2015/11/01/51fd94a6-7cbc-11e5-b575-d8dcfedb4ea1_story.html | title = D.C. law student takes case against Md. gerrymandering to Supreme Court | first = Robert | last = Barnes | date = November 1, 2015 | accessdate = March 29, 2018 | work = [[The Washington Post]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The unanimous Court agreed with the petitioners, in that the claims presented related to the constitutionality of the redistricting were not insubstantial and cleared the bar set in ''Goosby v. Osser'', and ordered a full three-judge hearing at the District Court for the case, but otherwise did not comment on the merits of the petitioners complaints related to the redistricting.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-990_10n2.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/2015/12/08/190bd7c0-9dbe-11e5-8728-1af6af208198_story.html | title = Supreme Court says challenge of Maryland district lines may proceed | first = Robert | last = Barnes |date = December 8, 2015 | accessdate = March 29, 2018 | work = [[The Washington Post]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second hearing===
The new hearing before Judges Bredar, [[Paul V. Niemeyer]], and [[George Levi Russell III]] began in 2016. The plaintiffs had revised their case to focus specifically on the redistricting of the 6th district, which had the widest swing in voter demographics. While the state attempted to dismiss the case, the Court denied their dismissal in a 2-1 decision (with Bredar dissenting) in August 2016, allowing the case to move into the discovery phase.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legal-work/Shapiro%20v.%20McManus%20Op.%20on%20MTD.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Both sides sought to expedite the case through summary judgements in mid-2017. However, on June 2017, the Supreme Court announced that they would be hearing the ''Gill v. Whitford'' case later that year. The plaintiffs in ''Benisek'' requested the District Court to issue an injunction from the state of Maryland from using the 2011 redistricting maps in anticipation of the upcoming 2018 elections, as the state of Maryland was seeking a [[stay of proceedings]] for the case until ''Gill v. Whitford'' was concluded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/md-redistricting-case-could-stall-while-supreme-court-hears-wisconsin-case/2017/07/13/623ccdaa-6013-11e7-a4f7-af34fc1d9d39_story.html | title = Md. redistricting case could stall while Supreme Court hears Wisconsin case | first = Josh  |last =Hicks | date = July 13, 2017 | accessdate = March 29, 2018 | work = [[The Washington Post]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The District Court denied the plaintiffs' request, and issued a stay on the case in August 2017, pending the conclusion of ''Gill v. Whitford''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legal-work/Benisek_v_Lamone_Order_EnteringStay_08.24.17.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supreme Court==
Seeking an expedited ruling, the plaintiffs filed a request for a jurisdictional statement to the Supreme Court on September 1, 2017 to reverse the District Court's denial of summary judgement and injunctions and placing the case on hold.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legal-work/17-333_JurisdictionalStatement.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; While the Supreme Court denied to reverse the District Court's orders, the Court did agree to hear the case on its merits on December 8, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/2017/12/08/4fde65f4-dc66-11e7-b1a8-62589434a581_story.html | title = Supreme Court will take up a second gerrymandering case this term | first = Robert | last = Barnes | date = December 8, 2017 | accessdate = March 29, 2018 | work = [[The Washington Post]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oral arguments were heard on March 28, 2018. In contrast to ''Gill v. Whitford'', the Justices seemed to indicate that the Maryland redistricting of the 6th district was a much more aggressive partisan gerrymandering than with Wisconsin, but still debated if they had a proper measure to judge how much of a partisan division it was, whether the Court should be involved in that decision, or whether this is something to be regulated through federal or state legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/even-on-second-look-supreme-court-seems-stumped-on-gerrymandering-issue/2018/03/28/bda41b00-31fd-11e8-94fa-32d48460b955_story.html | title = Even on second look, Supreme Court seems stumped on gerrymandering issue | first= Robert | last=  Barnes |date = March 28, 2018 | accessdate = March 29, 2018 | work = [[The Washington Post]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court issued its [[per curiam decision|''per curiam'' decision]] affirming the Appeals' Court decision on June 18, 2018, the same day as the ''Gill'' decision was announced. In the decision, the Court did not touch on the merits of the gerrymandering case, but instead found that the Appeals Court, in denying to issue an injunction on the use of the redistricting maps, was not an "abuse of discretion", given both the pending legal challenge of ''Gill'', and the need for "due regard for the public interest in orderly elections".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/18/politics/supreme-court-gerrymandering-decision/index.html | title = Supreme Court sidesteps partisan gerrymandering cases, let maps stand for now | first=  Ariane | last =  de Vogue | date = June 18, 2018 | accessdate = June 18, 2018 | work = [[CNN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision further argued that the plaintiffs had waited too long from the certification of the redistricting maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/18/us/politics/supreme-court-wisconsin-maryland-gerrymander-vote.html | title = Supreme Court Sidesteps Decision on Partisan Gerrymandering | first = Adam | last = Liptak | date = June 18, 2018 | accessdate  =June 18, 2018 | work = [[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent actions==
Following the ''per curiam'' decision and the conclusion of ''Gill v. Whitford'', the District Court rescheduled hearings on the case on October 4, 2018. The District Court subsequently ruled on November 7, 2018, that the redistricting of the 6th District was unconstitutional, and required the state to redraw the state's redistricting maps in a more neutral manner by March 7, 2019 to be approved by the Court, or otherwise the Court would assign an independent three-member commission to oversee the new maps, such that new maps would be available prior to the 2020 election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bs-md-maryland-house-district-gerrymandering-20181107-story.html | title = Federal judges say Maryland's 6th congressional district is unconstitutional; map must be redrawn for 2020 | first = Jeff | last = Barker | date = November 7, 2018 | accessdate = November 16, 2018 | work = [[The Baltimore Sun]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; State governor [[Larry Hogan]], a Republican, had stated his intent to let the ruling stand and engage with the state's general assembly to start redistricting, but the attorney general [[Brian Frosh]], a Democrat, stated his intention to appeal the District court ruling, potentially directly to the United States Supreme Court. Frosh also sought a stay of the District Court's redistricting order while the matter of appeal was under discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bs-md-frosh-redistricting-20181114-story.html | title = Michael | last = Dresser | date = November 15, 2018 | accessdate = November 16, 2018 | work = [[The Baltimore Sun]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''bumper sticker''' is an adhesive [[label]] or [[sticker]] with a message, intended to be attached to the [[Bumper (automobile)|bumper]] of an [[automobile]] and to be read by the occupants of other vehicles—although they are often stuck onto other objects. Most bumper stickers are about 30&amp;nbsp;cm by 8&amp;nbsp;cm (12 in by 3 in) and are often made of [[polyvinyl chloride|PVC]].

==Purpose==

[[Image:Feedbackbumpersticker.jpg|thumb|right|"[["How's my driving?" sign|How's my driving]]" bumper stickers are often used on commercial vehicles so that employers can receive feedback about the driving habits of their employees.]]

Bumper stickers can be commercial, religious, secular, humorous, or in support of a sports team or other organization. They may promote or oppose a particular philosophical or political position. In some countries, such as the [[United States]], bumper stickers are a popular way of showing support for a candidate for a government seat and become more common during election years. In others, such as the [[United Kingdom]], they are rarely seen in any form.

One variety of bumper sticker is the [[List of international license plate codes|country tag]]. This is typically used for cars crossing international borders, and is overseen by the [[United Nations]] as the ''Distinguishing Signs of Vehicles in International Traffic'', being authorized by the UN's [[Geneva Convention on Road Traffic]] (1949) and [[Vienna Convention on Road Traffic]] (1968). Often the country code is displayed on the license plate itself.

These have (usually in the [[United States]]) been spun off into tags indicating a country with which the driver affiliates, or more humorously to indicate things like a region ([[Outer Banks|OBX]]), support for rabbit rescue groups ([[House Rabbit Society|BUN]]), etc.

People who opt to exhibit their individuality through these decals may take part in more acts of [[road rage]]. [[Colorado State University]] [[social psychologist]], William Szlemko, found that aggressive driving is linked to the number of markers a person has on his/her car, regardless of the messages portrayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2008-06-17-0806160579-story.html | title=Sign of road rage may be on bumper | author=Vedantam, Shankar | work=[[Chicago Tribune]] | date=2008-06-17 | accessdate=2008-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application and removal==

Early bumper stickers had printed directions on the back removable liner for applying them to the bumper of a car.&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baker|first1=Whitney|title=Soapbox for the automobile: Bumper sticker history, identification, and preservation|journal=Collections: A Journal for Museum and Archives Professionals|date=2011|volume=7|issue=2|pages=251–270|url=http://hdl.handle.net/1808/9874}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the movement of the vehicle and changing weather conditions, the sticker needed to adhere well to the bumper surface.

There are some "easy to remove" bumper stickers and [[magnetic]] bumper stickers. Bumper stickers can be removed with a [[razor]] blade, [[penetrating oil]] or a [[heat gun]].  Home remedies also include using common household items, such as [[WD-40]] or [[paint thinner]].

==History==

Before bumper stickers, advertisers used other methods of displaying their wares. In the horse-drawn carriage era, advertisers printed on horsefly nets with the name of a business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schwab|first1=Armand|title=Bumpers tell tourist's story|issue=June 15|publisher=New York Times|date=1952|pages=X13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s and 1940s, bumper signs were printed on metal or cardboard and wired to the chrome bumpers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A million a month! Screen processed bumper strips developing into big business|journal=Screen Process Magazine|date=1953|issue=February|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lester Dill, promoter of [[Meramec Caverns]] in Missouri, was an ardent adopter of the bumper sign to attract motorists to his site.&lt;ref name=caverns&gt;{{cite web|title=Discover the history of the caverns|url=http://www.americascave.com/history.php|website=Meramec Caverns. America's Cave.com|accessdate=29 January 2016|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using a windowshield [[decal]] was another option. These paper strips could be wetted and placed inside a car window.&lt;ref name="Schwab"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Schwab|first1 = Armand|title = Bumpers tell tourist's story|journal = New York Times|date = 1952|volume = June 15|pages = X13}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these strips did not hold up well when placed on a bumper.

Various factors contributed to the development of the bumper sticker. Developments in material manufacturing during [[World War II]] led to the widespread use of [[Blacklight paint|daylight fluorescent inks]], which were created by [[Bob Switzer]] and his brother Joe. These inks appeared to glow during the daytime and were useful to support various wartime activities; they were favored by early bumper sticker manufacturers after the war. In addition, the first commercially produced [[pressure-sensitive tape|pressure-sensitive]] stickers appeared after [[World War II]]; new developments in adhesive materials led to the production of paper strips with adhesive on the back.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture|last = Levine|first = Richard|publisher = St. James Press|year = 2013|isbn = |location = Detroit|pages = 456–457}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the rise of consumer use of [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] after [[World War II]] led to the eventual use of this material in bumper stickers.

Many experts credit Forest P. Gill, a silkscreen printer from Kansas City, Kansas, USA, as the developer of the bumper sticker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pechuls|first1=Anne|title=Forest P. Gill: Responsible and dependable|journal=Promotional Products Business|date=2003|issue=April}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kennedy&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kennedy|first1=Pagan|title=Who made that bumper sticker?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/23/magazine/who-made-that-bumper-sticker.html|accessdate=29 January 2016|issue=September 12|publisher=New York Times Magazine|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gill recognized that the self-adhesive paper used during the second world war could be used to advertise promotional products in the late 1940s and beyond.

Early widespread uses of the advertising bumper sticker were for tourist attractions, such as Marine Gardens, Florida, Seven Falls, Colorado, [[Meramec Caverns]] in Missouri, and [[Lookout Mountain, Tennessee]]. Another popular advertisement was the "[[Rock City (roadside attraction)|See Rock City]]" sticker. In the 1940s and 1950s, visitors to the site had a sticker applied to their car, which duplicated the famous signs painted on the roofs of barns throughout the southeastern USA.  Tourist attraction staff would circulate through the parking lot, applying the promotional sticker to every car.

The first documented presidential election that used adhesive bumper stickers in [[political campaign]]s was the [[United States presidential election, 1952|1952 election]] between [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and [[Adlai Stevenson II]].&lt;ref name=Hanners&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hanners|first1=David|title=Candidates no longer favor bumper stickers; contenders prefer to spend their money on other ways . . .|issue=September 24|publisher=Contra Costa Times|date=2000|pages=A20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bumper stickers allowed citizens to show support for a candidate while still maintaining some anonymity.

Bumper stickers have sparked legal issues between people and states. A man with a bumper sticker containing indecent wording was convicted. The man's conviction was reversed during Cunningham v. State (1991). The court referenced the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], stating  “the provision regulating profane words on bumper stickers reaches a substantial amount of constitutionally protected speech and unconstitutionally restricts freedom of expression”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of the First Amendment|last = Hudson|first = David|publisher = CQ Press|year = 2009|isbn = 978-0-87289-311-5|location = Washington D.C.|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Around the world ==
{{Original research|section|date=March 2008}}

Considerable variation exists around the world as to the context and purpose of stickers.

On some vehicles, some stickers are like trophy signs of World War II aeroplanes, either of locations visited or actions completed.

They have also been extensively applied to rear windows as well, where legislative measures have not banned such use.  For instance in Sweden that is the normal place to put them and the bumper sticker is actually called "bakrutedekal" (rear window decal).

More recently, bumper stickers have become a route for advertising and a few companies offer to match car owners to advertisers willing to pay for the ad.

"[[Shirat Hasticker]]" ("The Sticker Song") by [[Hadag Nachash]] is an [[Israel]]i song composed entirely of bumper sticker slogans.

Variants of the bumper sticker have developed in recent years, including vinyl decals meant to be applied to a car's rear windshield, and chrome emblems to be affixed to the body of the car itself, generally on the rear (the "[[Jesus fish]]" and its "[[Darwin fish]]" counterpart are popular examples).

'''Bureaucratic collectivism''' is a theory of [[social class|class]] society. It is used by some [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]]s to describe the nature of the [[Soviet Union]] under [[Joseph Stalin]], and other similar states in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]] and elsewhere (such as [[North Korea]]).{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

==Theory==
A bureaucratic collectivist [[state (polity)|state]] owns the [[means of production]], while the [[economic surplus|surplus]] or profit is distributed among an elite [[communist party|party]] [[bureaucracy]] (''[[nomenklatura]]''), rather than among the [[working class]]. Also, most importantly, it is the bureaucracy—not the workers, or the people in general—which controls the economy and the state. Thus, the system is not truly [[capitalism|capitalist]], but it is not [[socialism|socialist]] either.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest E. Haberkern and Arthur Lipow, editors, ''Neither Capitalism nor Socialism'', Humanities Press, Atlantic Highlands, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] theory, it is a [[new class|new form of class society]] which [[Exploitation of labour|exploits]] workers through new mechanisms. Theorists, such as [[Yvan Craipeau]], who hold this view believe that bureaucratic collectivism does not represent progress beyond capitalism—that is, that it is no closer to being a [[workers' state]] than a capitalist state would be, and is considerably less efficient. Some{{Who|date=May 2010}} even believe that certain kinds of capitalism, such as [[social democracy|social democratic capitalism]], are more progressive than a bureaucratic collectivist society.

George Orwell's famous novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' describes a fictional society of "[[oligarchical collectivism]]". Orwell was familiar with the works of [[James Burnham]], having [[Second Thoughts on James Burnham|reviewed Burnham's ''The Managerial Revolution'']] prior to writing ''Nineteen Eighty-Four''. Oligarchical collectivism was a fictionalized conceptualization of bureaucratic collectivism, where [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]] and the [[Inner Party]] form the nucleus of a hierarchical organization of society professing itself as "[[ingsoc|English socialism]]" because of its revolutionary origins, but afterwards only concerned with total domination by the Party.

The idea has also been applied to Western countries outside the [[Eastern Bloc]], as a regime necessary to institute in order to maintain capitalism and keep it from disintegrating in the [[post-war era]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Finger |first=BarryI |date=Summer 1997 |title=On Bureaucratic Collectivism |journal=New Politics |volume=6 |url=http://nova.wpunj.edu/newpolitics/issue23/finger23.htm9 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This different form of bureaucratic collectivism is supposed to integrate various sectors of society, such as labor unions, corporations, and government organizations, in order to keep contradictions in the economy from developing into a general meltdown. This form is supposedly embodied in the [[welfare state]], which organizes workers into a government network subsumed under capitalist relations.

==Theoretical origins==
"Bureaucratic collectivism" was first used as a term to describe a theory originating in England, shortly before the [[World War I|First World War]], about a possible future social organisation. After the war, the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], and the rise to power of [[Joseph Stalin]] in the [[Soviet Union]], Hugo Urbahns and [[Lucien Laurat]] both began to critique the nature of the Soviet state in a similar manner.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

This theory was first taken up within [[Trotskyism]] by a small group in [[France]] around Craipeau. It was also taken up by [[Bruno Rizzi]], who believed that the Soviet, German, and Italian bureaucracies were progressive and celebrated "the class which has the courage to make itself master of the state".{{cn|date=July 2016}} It was with Rizzi that [[Leon Trotsky]] debated in the late 1930s. Trotsky held that the Soviet Union was a [[degenerated workers state]] and that if it did not undergo a new workers' [[political revolution]], it could move towards a new form of society, such as bureaucratic collectivism. However, Trotsky doubted that a state of &lt;em&gt;pure&lt;/em&gt; bureaucratic collectivism would ever be reached; he believed that, in the absence of a [[proletarian revolution]] to return the Soviet Union to socialism, a comprehensive [[counter-revolution]] would return the nation to capitalism instead.

Soon after the [[Workers Party (US)|Workers Party]] in the [[United States]] (later the [[Independent Socialist League]]), led by [[Max Shachtman]], split from the [[Fourth International]], it adopted the theory of bureaucratic collectivism and developed it. As a result, it is often associated with [[Shachtmanite|Left Shachtmanism]] and the [[Third Camp]]. Its version had much in common with Craipeau's, as developed by [[James Burnham]] and [[Joseph Carter (socialist)|Joseph Carter]], but little with Rizzi's.

==Criticisms==
In 1948, [[Tony Cliff]] argued that it is difficult to make a critique of bureaucratic collectivism because authors such as Shachtman never actually published a developed account of the theory. He asserted that the theoretical poverty of the theory of bureaucratic collectivism is not accidental and tried to show that the theory is only negative; empty, abstract, and therefore arbitrary. Cliff proposed “[[state capitalism]]” as an alternative theory that more accurately describes the nature of the Soviet Union under [[Stalinism]].&lt;ref name="Cliff 1948"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Cliff | first = Tony | authorlink = Tony Cliff | title = The theory of bureaucratic collectivism: A critique | year = 1948 | url = http://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1948/xx/burcoll.htm | accessdate = 2011-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1979 ''[[Monthly Review]]'' essay, [[Ernest Mandel]] argued that the hypothesis that the [[nomenklatura|Soviet bureaucracy]] is a [[new class]] does not correspond to a serious analysis of the real development and the real contradictions of [[Economy of the Soviet Union|Soviet economy]] and society in the last fifty years. He asserted that [[conflict of interest]] turns bureaucracy into a cancer on a society in transition between [[capitalism]] and [[socialism]]. Accordingly, bureaucratic management is not only increasingly wasteful but it also prevents the system of a [[planned economy]] based upon [[socialization (economics)|socialized property]] from operating effectively. Mandel concluded that this undeniable fact is in itself incompatible with the characterization of the bureaucracy as a [[ruling class]] and with the USSR as a new “exploitative [[mode of production]]” whose “laws of motion” have never been specified.&lt;ref name="Mandel 1979"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Mandel | first = Ernest | authorlink = Ernest Mandel | title = Why The Soviet Bureaucracy is not a New Ruling Class | journal = [[Monthly Review]] |year = 1979 | url = http://www.ernestmandel.org/en/works/txt/1979/soviet_bureaucracy.htm | accessdate = 2011-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Convention for the Suppression of the Illicit Traffic in Dangerous Drugs''' was a drug control [[treaty]] signed in 1936.

[[Harry Anslinger]] representing the United States attempted to add provisions to [[criminalisation|criminalize]] all activities – cultivation, production, manufacture and distribution – related to the use of [[opium]], [[coca]] (and its derivatives) and [[cannabis]] for non-medical and non-scientific purposes. Other countries objected to this proposal, so the Convention's focus remained on trafficking. The U.S. considered the final treaty to be too weak, and refused to sign it, fearing that it might have to weaken its own controls to comply with the treaty. The Convention therefore had little effect, although it was the first treaty to make certain drug offenses international crimes; all the previous treaties had dealt with regulating licit drug activity.

While hard data on [[corruption]] is difficult to collect, '''corruption in Indonesia''' is clearly seen through [[public opinion]], collated through [[Survey (human research)|survey]]s as well as observation of how each system runs.&lt;ref name="Lateef, S. (2003)"&gt;Lateef, S. ''et al''; ''Combating Corruption in Indonesia'', World Bank East Asia Poverty Reduction and Economic Management Unit 2003 [http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTINDONESIA/Resources/Publication/03-Publication/Combating+Corruption+in+Indonesia-Oct15.pdf Full text]&lt;/ref&gt; Transparency International's 2017 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country 96th place out of 180 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2017|title=Corruption Perception Index 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two key areas in the public sector in which [[political corruption|corruption]] in [[Indonesia]] can be found. These are the [[Judiciary|justice]] and [[civil service]] sectors. Corruption within the justice sector is seen by its ineffectiveness to enforce laws, failure to uphold justice, hence undermining the rule of law. The areas of corruption within this sector include the [[Indonesian National Police|police]] and the [[Supreme Court of Indonesia|courts]]. In the 2008 Public Sector Integrity Survey, the Supreme Court ranked the lowest in integrity in comparison to the other public services in Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;(Komisi Pemberantasan Korupsi, Integritas Sektor Publik Indonesia Tahun 2008: Fakta Korupsi dalam Layanan Publik, (Jakarta: Direktorat Penelitian dan Pengembangan Komisi Pemberatasan Korupsi, 2009), pg 10.)&lt;/ref&gt; The courts were viewed to make decisions unfairly and have high unofficial costs.

Evidence of corruption within the civil service comes from surveys conducted within the sector. Some surveys found out that almost half were found to have received [[bribe]]s. Civil servants themselves admit to corruption.&lt;ref name="Lateef, S. (2003)"/&gt;

In January 2012, it was reported that Indonesia has lost as much as Rp 2.13 trillion (US$238.6 million) to corruption in 2011. A study conducted by [[Indonesia Corruption Watch]], a non-profit organization co-ordinated by Danang Widoyoko, said that [[embezzlement]] accounted for most of the money lost and that “[[Public infrastructure|government investment]] was the sector most prone to [[gratification]].”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/home/corruption-costs-indonesia-238m-in-2011/494558   | title=Corruption Costs Indonesia $238m in 2011| author=Ezra Sihite| publisher=Jakarta Globe| date=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies are concerned about [[red tape]] and widespread [[extortion]] in the process of obtaining [[Business license|licences and permits]], and they often faced demand for irregular fees or [[Collusion|concessions based on personal relationships]] when obtaining [[Government procurement|government contracts]]. Companies have also reported regular demand for cash payments and expectations for gifts and special treatments by Indonesian officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indonesia Corruption Profile|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/east-asia-the-pacific/indonesia/show-all.aspx|website=Business Anti-Corruption Portal|accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic and social costs==
Corruption is an important development challenge that poses [[Economic cost|economic]] and [[social cost]]s in Indonesia. Interference in public laws and policies for the sake of personal or private gain has weakened the competitiveness of Indonesia.&lt;ref name="Vinay Kumar Bhargava, E. P. (2004)"&gt;Vinay Kumar Bhargava, E. P. (2004). Challenging corruption in Asia: case studies and a framework for action. World Bank Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
About one-quarter of [[Cabinet of Indonesia|ministries]] suffer from [[Government budget|budgetary]] diversions in Indonesia. Households spent approximately 1% while enterprises spent at least 5% of monthly company revenue on unofficial payments. Social costs due to corruption in Indonesia include the weakening of government institutions and the rule of law.&lt;ref name="Lateef, S. (2003)"/&gt; Increases in crime due to smuggling and extortion involve the institutions that are supposed to be protecting citizens. The people who suffer most are the poor&lt;ref name="Mauro, P. (1997)"&gt;Mauro, P. (1997). Why Worry About Corruption?&lt;/ref&gt; as they are pressured to finance payments through their already tight budgets and the effectiveness of social services are less accessible indirectly. These concerns were voiced by the poor urban communities of Indonesia themselves in a joint World Bank-Partnership for Governance Reform research project, entitled “Corruption and the Poor”.&lt;ref name="Hardjono, R. a. (2002)"&gt;Hardjono, R. a. (2002). The Poor Speak Up; 17 Stories of Corruption, Partnership for Governance .
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Efforts to curb corruption==
Anti-corruption efforts began in Indonesia in the 1950s. There have been some efforts to battle corruption with the creation of the ombudsman and the Assets Auditing Commission (KPKPN).&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Sherlock, Combating Corruption in Indonesia? The Ombudsman and the Assets Auditing Commission, Volume 38, Issue 3, December 2002, pages 367-383&lt;/ref&gt; It has been an important agenda and part of [[Post-Suharto era|Indonesia's official reform program since May 1998]]. However, the efforts made are questionable as there has been limited success to reduce corruption. Some obstacles that impeded the improvement of corruption included political and economic constraints, and the complex nature of the corruption itself.&lt;ref&gt;Natasha Hamilton-Hart. ANTI-CORRUPTION STRATEGIES IN INDONESIA Bulletin of Indonesian Economic Studies, Vol.37, No 1,2001: 65-82.&lt;/ref&gt; Following strong criticism of corruption at the beginning of the [[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order]] regime in the late 1960s a ''Commission of Four'' was appointed by president [[Suharto]] in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;J. A. C. Mackie, 'The report of the Commission of Four on corruption', ''Bulletin of Indonesian Economic Studies'', 6 (3), 1970, pp. 87-101.&lt;/ref&gt; The report of the commission noted that corruption was "rampant" but none of the cases it said were in need of urgent action were followed up. Laws were passed in 1999 giving the [[Indonesian National Police|Police]] and [[Attorney General of Indonesia|prosecution service]] the authority to investigate corruption cases.

These efforts have taken the shape of ordering corruption convicts to pay back all the money they have stolen. On 6 March 2012, the Jakarta Corruption Court sentenced Ridwan Sanjaya, an official from the [[Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (Indonesia)|Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources]], to six years in prison for rigging a tender bid for a [[Solar power|home solar energy system]] project in 2009 worth IDR526 billion (US$57.86 million). This is an abnormal number in equation to other southeastern-Asian countries. The government isn't doing much for this case and the Indonesians are left to handle this on their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne%2BNews/Asia/Story/A1Story20120307-332013.html | title=Corruption convicts told to give back cash: Jakarta| author=Ina Parlina and Apriadi Gunawan| publisher=The Jakarta Post/Asia News Network| date=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ridwan was found guilty of accepting IDR 14.6 billion in kickbacks, resulting in IDR131 billion in state losses. The [[Corruption Eradication Commission]] (KPK) stated that it will use Ridwan’s verdict as material to develop the investigation on the graft scandal involving the Solar Home System project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tempointeractive.com/hg/nasional/2012/03/07/brk,20120307-388581,uk.html | title=Ridwan’s Verdict, KPK’s Investigation Material| author=TRI SUHARMAN – ISMA SAVITRI – SUKMA| publisher=TEMPO Interactive| date=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Democratic Alignment''' ({{lang-el|Δημοκρατική Συμπαράταξη (ΔΗΣΥ)|translit=Dimokratiki Symparataxi}}, '''DISI'''), also translated as '''Democratic Coalition''', is a [[political alliance]] in [[Greece]].

==Formation and enlargements==
The alliance was launched on 30 August 2015, prior to the September snap election formed by the [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] (PASOK) and the [[Democratic Left (Greece)|Democratic Left]] (DIMAR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13611">A '''dirtbox''' (or DRT box) is a [[cell site]] simulator, or a phone device mimicking a cell phone tower. The device is designed to create a signal strong enough within a short range that it forces dormant mobile phones to automatically switch over to it. It is used by the [[United States Marshals Service]], mounted on aircraft all over the U.S., to detect and locate cell phones and thus collect information, and can be used to [[Mobile phone jammer|jam]] phones. The name stems from the company that originally developed it, Digital Receiver Technology, Inc., abbreviated DRT, owned by the [[Boeing]] company. Boeing describes the device as a hybrid of "jamming, managed access and detection".&lt;ref name=ntia&gt;{{cite web|author1=The Boeing Company |title=Technical Approaches to Preventing Contraband Cell Phone Use in Prisons;Docket No. 100504212-0212-01 |url=http://www.ntia.doc.gov/files/ntia/comments/100504212-0212-01/attachments/Boeing%20and%20DRT%20Comments%20on%20NTIA%20Contraband%20Cell%20Phone%20NOI%206%2011%2010.pdf. |publisher=National Telecommunications and Information Administration |accessdate=16 November 2014 |pages=7 |date=11 June 2010 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}} A similar device with a more limited range that has been widely used by United States federal entities, including the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), is the controversial [[Stingray phone tracker|StingRay phone tracker]].

== History ==
It is not known when Digital Receiver Technology, Inc. (DRT) first manufactured the dirtbox. DRT does not publicly advertise the dirtbox, stating, "Due to the sensitive nature of our work, we are unable to publicly advertise many of our products" on its Web site.&lt;ref name=DRT&gt;{{cite web|title=DRT Products|url=http://www.drti.com/products.htm|publisher=Digital Receiver Technology, Inc.|accessdate=16 November 2014|date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Wall Street Journal'' wrote that the program by the [[U.S. Marshals Service]] "fully matured by 2007".&lt;ref name=wsj/&gt; Boeing bought DRT in 2008.&lt;ref name=CIR/&gt;

Similar devices from the [[Harris Corporation]], like the [[Stingray phone tracker]], have been sold around the same time. Since 2008, their airborne mounting kit for cell phone surveillance has been said to cost $9,000.&lt;ref name=wired&gt;{{cite news|author1=Kim Zetter|title=The Feds Are Now Using ‘Stingrays’ in Planes to Spy on Our Phone Calls|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/11/feds-motherfng-stingrays-motherfng-planes/|accessdate=16 November 2014|work=Wired|publisher=Condé Nast|date=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 11, 2010, the Boeing Company had asked the [[National Telecommunications and Information Administration]] to advise the United States Congress that the "...&amp;nbsp;Communications Act of 1934 be modified to allow prison officials and state and local law enforcement to use appropriate cell phone management".&lt;ref name="ntia"/&gt; It suggested that special weapons and tactics ([[SWAT]]) teams and other paramilitary tactical units could control wireless communications in a building during a raid.&lt;ref name=ntia/&gt;{{rp|5}}

The [[Chicago Police Department]] bought dirt boxes to eavesdrop on demonstrators during the [[2012 NATO summit]] and used them in 2014 [[Black Lives Matter]] demonstrations, and in 2015 it became known that the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] had purchased them too.&lt;ref name=CIR&gt;Ali Winston (August 7, 2015) [https://www.revealnews.org/article/chicago-and-los-angeles-have-used-dirt-box-surveillance-for-a-decade/ Chicago and Los Angeles have used ‘dirt box’ surveillance for a decade] Center of Investigative Reporting, retrieved 26 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==
The device was described as being {{convert|2|sqft|adj=on}} in size in the first mass media publication that shed light on it.&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;{{cite news|author1=Devlin Barrett|title=Americans’ Cellphones Targeted in Secret U.S. Spy Program|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/americans-cellphones-targeted-in-secret-u-s-spy-program-1415917533|accessdate=14 November 2014|work=The Wall Street Journal|publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company|date=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It acts as a fake cell phone tower,&lt;ref name=CIR/&gt; and utilizes [[IMSI-catcher]] technology, which stands for "international mobile subscriber identity". Phone networks use this system to identify an individual subscriber.&lt;ref name=wsj/&gt; The device emits a [[pilot signal]] made to appear stronger than that from the service provider [[cell site|cell tower]], which forces all phones within its range to broadcast their [[International mobile subscriber identity|IMSI]] number and [[electronic serial number]] (ESN). Encryption does not prevent this process.&lt;ref name=wsj/&gt; Furthermore, the devices can retrieve the encryption session keys for a cellphone in less than a second with success rates of 50 to 75% (in real world conditions)".&lt;ref name=CIR/&gt;

By mounting the device on a plane, it can locate a phone within 10 feet,&lt;ref name=wsj/&gt; while another source claims that by triangulating flights, a dirtbox can identify a phone accurately up to two feet.&lt;ref name=register&gt;{{cite news|author1=Iain Thomson|title=US Marshals commit DIRTBOX INTRUSION on Americans, says report|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/11/14/report_us_marshals_can_slurp_up_your_mobe_privates_with_flying_dirtbox/|accessdate=16 November 2014|work=The Register|publisher=Situation Publishing|date=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dirtbox is a hybrid of detection, managed access and [[Radio jamming|jamming]] technologies: According to "people with knowledge of the program", in ''The Wall Street Journal'' article, the device can determine which phones belong to suspects and which belong to non-suspects,&lt;ref name=wsj/&gt; and that "cell phones not of interest, such as those belonging to prison personnel or commercial users in the area, are returned to their local network."&lt;ref name=ntia/&gt;{{rp|4}} The dirtbox can also selectively [[Mobile phone jammer|jam]] for brief intervals, that is, interrupt or disable calls on certain phones, preventing contraband use in prison.&lt;ref name=ntia/&gt;{{rp|4}} It can also retrieve data from a phone. The technology is "unobtrusive to legitimate wireless communications", as described by Boeing,&lt;ref name=ntia/&gt;{{rp|4}} and bypasses phone companies in its operations.

== Agency use ==
=== Law enforcement ===
{{as of|November 2014}}, the [[U.S. Marshals Service]] Technical Operations Group has been using the device fixed on manned airplanes to track fugitives, but it can deploy it on "targets requested by other parts of the Justice Program".&lt;ref name=wsj/&gt; It operates from at least five U.S. airports "covering most of the U.S. population". It is unclear whether the U.S. Marshals Service is requesting court orders.&lt;ref name=wsj/&gt; 
 
Specifically, the Marshals Service has used dirtboxes in the [[Mexican Drug War]] for tracking fugitives in coordination with Mexico's [[Naval Infantry Force]] and flights in [[Guatemala]].&lt;ref name="mexicandrugwar"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Devlin Barrett|title=U.S. Marshals Service Personnel Dressed as Mexican Marines Pursue Cartel Bosses|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-marshals-service-personnel-dressed-as-mexican-marines-pursue-drug-cartel-bosses-1416595305|accessdate=21 November 2014|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DRT boxes are used by the [[United States Special Operations Command]], the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]], the [[FBI]] and [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]]. The U.S. Navy bought dirtboxes to mount on drones at [[Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake]], its research and development facility in Southern California according to procurement documents. The Pentagon Washington Headquarters Services bought them in 2011.&lt;ref name=CIR/&gt;

=== Signal intelligence ===
Based on references to DRTBox in NSA's [[Boundless informant]] screenshots&lt;ref name=electro&gt;{{cite web|author1=P/K|title=DRTBOX and the DRT surveillance systems|url=http://electrospaces.blogspot.com/2013/11/drtbox-and-drt-surveillance-systems.html|website=Top Level Telecommunications|publisher=electrospaces.net|accessdate=16 November 2014|date=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; leaked by [[Edward Snowden]], dirtbox is probably used by the NSA.&lt;ref name=ssrn&gt;{{cite web|author1=Stephanie K.

The [[United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group]] Group One bought a Digital Receiver Technology 1301B System on April 2, 2007 costing over $25,000  per the [[government procurement in the United States|United States government procurement]] web site.&lt;ref name=fbo&gt;{{cite web|author1=FedBizOpps|title=59 -- Portable Receiving System|url=https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;tab=core&amp;id=05fc805e57934b06f219ecf013928870|publisher=FedBizOpps.gov|accessdate=17 November 2014|date=2 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{US Constitution article series}}
The '''Eighteenth Amendment''' ('''Amendment XVIII''') of the [[United States Constitution]] effectively established the [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition of intoxicating liquors in the United States]] by declaring the production, transport, and sale of  intoxicating liquors (though not the consumption or private possession) illegal. It was ratified on January 16, 1919. The separate [[Volstead Act]] set down methods for enforcing the Eighteenth Amendment, and defined which "intoxicating liquors" were prohibited, and which were excluded from prohibition (e.g., for medical and religious purposes). The Amendment was the first to set a time delay before it would take effect following ratification, and the first to set a time limit for its ratification by the states. The Volstead Act set the starting date for nationwide prohibition for January 17, 1920, which was the earliest day allowed by the Eighteenth Amendment.

The Amendment was in effect for the following 13 years. It was repealed in 1933 by ratification of the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-First Amendment]]. The Twenty-first Amendment was ratified on December 5, 1933. It is unique among the 27 amendments of the U.S. Constitution for being the only one to repeal a prior amendment and to have been ratified by [[state ratifying conventions]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-xviii|title=The 18th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution|website=National Constitution Center – The 18th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution|language=en|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{Expand section|date=January 2017}}
{{Main|Prohibition in the United States}}
The Eighteenth Amendment was the result of decades of effort by [[the temperance movement in the United States]] and at the time was generally considered a [[Progressivism|progressive]] amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hamm |first=Richard F. |title=Shaping the Eighteenth Amendment: temperance reform, legal culture, and the polity, 1880–1920 |year=1995 |publisher=UNC Press Books |isbn=978-0-8078-4493-9 |oclc=246711905 |page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1906, the [[Anti-Saloon League|Anti-Saloon League (ASL)]] began leading a campaign to ban the sale of alcohol on a state level. They led speeches, advertisements, and public demonstrations, claiming that banning the sale of alcohol would get rid of poverty and social issues, such as immoral behavior and violence. It would also inspire new forms of sociability between men and women and they believed that families would be happier, fewer industrial mistakes would be made and overall, the world would be a better place.&lt;ref name="gilderlehrman.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/roaring-twenties/essays/prohibition-and-its-effects|title=User account - Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History|website=www.gilderlehrman.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Other groups such as the Women's Christian Temperance Union began as well trying to ban the sale, manufacturing, and distribution of alcoholic beverages.&lt;ref name="gilderlehrman.org"/&gt; A well-known reformer during this time period was Carrie Amelia Moore Nation, whose violent actions (such as vandalizing saloon property) made her a household name across America.&lt;ref name="history.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/18th-and-21st-amendments|title=18th and 21st Amendments - Facts &amp; Summary - HISTORY.com|website=HISTORY.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Many state legislatures had already enacted statewide prohibition prior to the ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment but did not ban the consumption of alcohol in most households. It took some states longer than others to ratify this amendment, especially northern states, including New York, New Jersey, and Massachusetts. They violated the law by still allowing some wines and beers to be sold.&lt;ref name="gilderlehrman.org"/&gt;   By 1916, 23 of 48 states had already passed laws against saloons, some even banning the manufacture of alcohol in the first place.&lt;ref name="history.com"/&gt;

== The Temperance Movement==
The Temperance Movement was dedicated to the complete abstinence of alcohol from public life. The movement began in the early 1800s within Christian churches, and was very religiously motivated. The central areas the group was founded out of were in the Saratoga area of New York, as well as in Massachusetts. Churches were also highly influential in gaining new members and support, garnering 6,000 local societies in several different states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=temperance movement|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/temperance-movement|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, inc.|accessdate=November 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A group that was inspired by the movement was the Anti-Saloon league, who at the turn of the 20th century began heavily lobbying for prohibition in the United States. The group was founded in 1893 in the state of Ohio, gaining massive support from Evangelical Protestants, to becoming a national organization in 1895. The group was successful in helping implement prohibition, through heavy lobbying and having a vast influence. The group following repeal of prohibition fell out of power and in 1950 merged with other groups forming the National Temperance League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anti-Saloon League|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Anti-Saloon-League|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, inc.|accessdate=November 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proposal and ratification ==
[[Image:18th Amendment Pg1of1 AC.jpg|190px|thumb| Amendment XVIII in the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]]]]
On August 1, 1917, the [[U.S. Senate|Senate]] passed a resolution containing the language of the amendment to be presented to the [[States of the United States|states]] for ratification.  The vote was 65 to 20, with the Democrats voting 36 in favor and 12 in opposition; and the Republicans voting 29 in favor and 8 in opposition. The [[U.S. House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] passed a revised resolution&lt;ref&gt;{{USStat|40|1050}}&lt;/ref&gt; on December 17, 1917. This was the first amendment to impose a date by which it had to be ratified or else the amendment would be discarded.&lt;ref name="laws.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://constitution.laws.com/american-history/constitution/constitutional-amendments/18th-amendment|title=18th Amendment - constitution - Laws.com|website=constitution.laws.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the House, the vote was 282 to 128, with the Democrats voting 141 in favor and 64 in opposition; and the Republicans voting 137 in favor and 62 in opposition.  Four Independents in the House voted in favor and two Independents cast votes against the amendment.&lt;ref name =Pietrusza160&gt;David Pietrusza, ''1920: The Year of Six Presidents'' (NY: Carroll &amp; Graf, 2007), 160&lt;/ref&gt; It was officially proposed by the [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] to the states when the Senate passed the resolution, by a vote of 47 to 8, the next day, December 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Prohibition wins in Senate, 47 to 8 |newspaper=New York Times|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20A17FF355F157A93CBA81789D95F438185F9|format=PDF |date=December 19, 1917 |page=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amendment and its enabling legislation did not ban the consumption of alcohol, but made it difficult to obtain alcoholic beverages legally, as it prohibited the sale, manufacture and distribution of them in U.S. territory. Any one who got caught selling, manufacturing or distributing alcoholic beverages would be arrested.&lt;ref name="gilderlehrman.org"/&gt; 
Because prohibition was already implemented by many states, it was quickly ratified into a law.&lt;ref name="laws.com"/&gt; The ratification of the Amendment was completed on January 16, 1919, when Nebraska became the 36th of the 48 states then in the Union to ratify it. On January 29, acting Secretary of State [[Frank L. Polk]] certified the ratification.&lt;ref&gt;{{USStat|40|1941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Prohibition.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Prohibition agents destroying barrels of alcohol]]
To define the language used in the Amendment, Congress enacted enabling legislation called the National Prohibition Act, better known as the [[Volstead Act]], on October 28, 1919. President Woodrow Wilson vetoed that bill, but the House of Representatives immediately voted to override the veto and the Senate voted similarly the next day. The Volstead Act set the starting date for nationwide prohibition for January 17, 1920, which was the earliest date allowed by the 18th amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/us-presidents/woodrow-wilson|title=Woodrow Wilson - U.S. Presidents - HISTORY.com|website=HISTORY.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Volstead Act==
The act was conceived and introduced by Wayne Wheeler who was a leader of the Anti-Saloon League, a group which found alcohol responsible for almost all of society's problems, and were also responsible for many campaigns against the sale of alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;Smentkowski, Brian P. "Eighteenth Amendment." Encyclopædia Britannica, Encyclopædia Britannica, inc., 22 Aug. 2017, www.britannica.com/topic/Eighteenth-Amendment&lt;/ref&gt; The law was also heavily supported by Judiciary Chairman at the time, Andrew Volstead from Minnesota and was named in his honor. The act in its written form laid the ground work of prohibition, defining the procedures for banning the distribution of alcohol including their production and distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Volstead Act|url=http://history.house.gov/HistoricalHighlight/Detail/36108|website=History, Art &amp; Archives, U.S. House of Representatives|accessdate=2017-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Volstead had once before introduced an early version of the law to congress. It was first brought to the floor on May 27, 1919 meeting heavy resistance from Democrat senators, introducing instead what was called the "wet law", which was an attempt to end the wartime prohibition laws put into affect much earlier. The debate of prohibition would continue to be fueled even longer in congress, for that entire the House would be divided among what would be known as the "bone-drys and the "wets".

With Republicans in the majority of the House of Representatives, the act was passed July 22, 1919 with 287 in favor and 100 opposed. Unfortunately the act was in large part a failure, being unable to prevent mass distribution of alcoholic beverages and also inadvertently gave way to massive increase in organized crime.&lt;ref&gt;"Congress enforces prohibition." History.com, A&amp;E Television Networks, www.history.com/this-day-in-history/congress-enforces-prohibition.&lt;/ref&gt; The act would go on to be the standard for enforcing prohibition, until the passing of the 21st amendment in 1933 effectively repealed it.

'''Positives:'''
* During the Prohibition era's first years, amendment supporters were gratified by a decline in arrests for drunkenness, hospitalization for alcoholism, and instances of liver-related medical problems. These statistics seemed to validate their campaign and to suggest that America's future might include happier families, fewer industrial accidents, and a superior moral tone. 
* Most Americans greeted the end of the Prohibition era with relief. While the end of the conflict and lawlessness was a relief there was also a clear benefit that Americans could recognize. The legalization of alcohol meant that alcohol could be taxed by government; the United States was in the midst of the Great Depression and state and federal governments needed revenue to create relief programs.

'''Negatives:'''
* The rise of mass disobedience to prohibition laws took the amendment's advocates by surprise. People who could afford the high price of smuggled liquor flocked to speakeasies and gin joints. These establishments could be quite glamorous. Whereas pre-Prohibition saloons had seldom welcomed women, the new world of nightclubs invited both the bob-haired "flapper" and her "sheik" to drink cocktails, smoke, and dance to jazz.
* Working-class consumption largely moved from saloons into the home. "Bathtub gin" and moonshine took the place of mass-produced liquor, and hosts might use additives to turn grape juice into wine for their guests. Americans who sought to remain in the liquor business found ways to re-distill the alcohol in perfume, paint, and carpentry supplies. They continued redistilling even after learning that many of these products contained poisons meant to deter such transformations.
* Ultimately, only a small percentage of liquor distributors found themselves arrested. But even this limited number of accused—there were approximately 65,000 federal criminal actions in the first two years of Prohibition—was enough to cripple the justice system. Prisons grew crowded, and judges tried to incentivize quick "guilty" pleas by promising very small fines. And if a liquor seller did wind up on trial, juries filled with liquor drinkers were often reluctant to find the defendants guilty; only about 60 percent of cases ended with a conviction.

==Controversies==
The proposed amendment was the first to contain a provision setting a deadline for its ratification.&lt;ref&gt;https://constiution.laws.com/american-history/constiution/constituional-amendments/18th-amendment&lt;/ref&gt; That clause of the amendment was challenged, with the case reaching the [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]].  It upheld the constitutionality of such a deadline in ''[[Dillon v. Gloss]]'' (1921). The Supreme Court also upheld the ratification by the Ohio legislature in ''[[Hawke v. Smith]]'' (1920), despite a petition requiring that the matter go to ballot.

This was not the only controversy around the amendment. The phrase "intoxicating [[Liquor|liquor]]" would not logically have included beer and wine (as they are not distilled), and their inclusion in the prohibition came as a surprise to the general public, as well as wine and beer makers. This controversy caused many Northern states to not abide by which caused some problems.&lt;ref name="gilderlehrman.org"/&gt; The brewers were probably not the only Americans to be surprised at the severity of the regime thus created. Voters who considered their own drinking habits blameless, but who supported prohibition to discipline others, also received a rude shock. That shock came with the realization that federal prohibition went much farther in the direction of banning personal consumption than all local prohibition ordinances and many state prohibition statutes. National Prohibition turned out to be quite a different beast than its local and state cousins.

Under Prohibition, the illegal manufacture and sale of liquor–known as "bootlegging"–occurred on a large scale across the United States. In urban areas, where the majority of the population opposed Prohibition, enforcement was generally much weaker than in rural areas and smaller towns. Perhaps the most dramatic consequence of Prohibition was the effect it had on organized crime in the United States: as the production and sale of alcohol went further underground, it began to be controlled by the Mafia and other gangs, who transformed themselves into sophisticated criminal enterprises that reaped huge profits from the illicit liquor trade.

When it came to its booming bootleg business, the Mafia became skilled at bribing police and politicians to look the other way. Chicago's [[Al Capone]] emerged as the most notorious example of this phenomenon, earning an estimated $60 million annually from the bootlegging and speakeasy operations he controlled. In addition to bootlegging, gambling and prostitution reached new heights during the 1920s as well. A growing number of Americans came to blame Prohibition for this widespread moral decay and disorder–despite the fact that the legislation had intended to do the opposite–and to condemn it as a dangerous infringement on the freedom of the individual.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/18th-and-21st-amendments|title=18th and 21st Amendments - Facts &amp; Summary - HISTORY.com|website=HISTORY.com|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his important study both of the Eighteenth Amendment and its repeal, Daniel Okrent identifies the powerful political coalition that worked successfully in the two decades leading to the ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment:

Five distinct, if occasionally overlapping, components made up this unspoken coalition:  racists, progressives, suffragists, populists (whose ranks included a small socialist auxiliary), and nativists. Adherents of each group may have been opposed to alcohol for its own sake, but used the Prohibition impulse to advance ideologies and causes that had little to do with it.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Calls for repeal ==
If public sentiment had turned against Prohibition by the late 1920s, the Great Depression only hastened its demise, as some argued that the ban on alcohol denied jobs to the unemployed and much-needed revenue to the government. The efforts of the nonpartisan group Americans Against Prohibition Association (AAPA) added to public disillusionment. In 1932, the platform of Democratic presidential candidate Franklin D. Roosevelt included a plank for repealing the 18th Amendment, and his victory that November marked a certain end to Prohibition.

In February 1933, Congress adopted a resolution proposing the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-first Amendment]], which repealed the 18th Amendment and modified the [[Volstead Act]] to permit the sale of beer. The resolution required state conventions, rather than the state legislatures, to approve the amendment, effectively reducing the process to a one-state, one-vote referendum rather than a popular vote contest. That December, Utah became the 36th state to ratify the amendment, achieving the necessary majority for repeal. A few states continued statewide prohibition after 1933, but by 1966 all of them had abandoned it. Since then, liquor control in the United States has largely been determined at the local level.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==Impact==
Just after the Eighteenth Amendment's adoption, there was a significant reduction in alcohol consumption among the general public and particularly among low-income groups. There were fewer hospitalizations for alcoholism and likewise fewer liver-related medical problems. However, consumption soon climbed as underworld entrepreneurs began producing "rotgut" alcohol which was full of dangerous diseases.&lt;ref name="history.com"/&gt; With the rise of home distilled alcohol, careless distilling led to the deaths of many citizens. During the ban upwards of 10,000 deaths can be attributed to wood alcohol ([[methanol]]) poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/3665643/deadly-drinking/|title=The History of Poisoned Alcohol Includes an Unlikely Culprit: The U.S. Government|last=Rothman|first=Lily|date=January 14, 2015|website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, during prohibition use and abuse of alcohol ended up higher than before it started.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pbs.org/kenburns/prohibition/unintended-consequences/ PBS: The Unintended Consequences of Prohibition] and Government, http://time.com/3665643/deadly-drinking/|website=TIME|accessdate=14 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blum|first1=Deborah|title=The Poisoners Handbook|date=18 February 2010|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York, New York|page=Ch. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The greatest unintended consequence of Prohibition however, was the plainest to see. For over a decade, the law that was meant to foster temperance instead fostered intemperance and excess. The solution the United States had devised to address the problem of alcohol abuse had instead made the problem even worse. The statistics of the period are notoriously unreliable, but it is very clear that in many parts of the United States more people were drinking, and people were drinking more.

Though there were significant increases in crimes involved in the production and distribution of illegal alcohol, there was an initial reduction in overall crime, mainly in types of crimes associated with the effects of alcohol consumption such as public drunkenness.&lt;ref&gt;https://object.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa157.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Those who continued to use alcohol, tended to turn to organized criminal syndicates. Law enforcement wasn't strong enough to stop all liquor traffic; however, they used a "sting" operations--"Prohibition agent Elliot Ness famously used wiretapping to discern secret locations of breweries."&lt;ref name="gilderlehrman.org"/&gt; The prisons became crowded which led to fewer arrests for the distribution of alcohol, as well as those arrested being charged with small fines rather than prison time.&lt;ref name="gilderlehrman.org"/&gt; The murder rate fell for two years, but then rose to record highs because this market became extremely attractive to criminal organizations, a trend that reversed the very year prohibition ended.&lt;ref&gt;https://object.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa157.pdf — Cato Institute Policy Analysis No. 157:
Alcohol Prohibition Was a Failure&lt;br/&gt; The homicide rate increased from 6 per 100,000 population in the pre-Prohibition period to nearly 10 per 100,000 in 1933. That rising trend was reversed by the repeal of Prohibition in 1933, and the rate continued to decline throughout the 1930s and early 1940s&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reason.com/archives/2003/01/29/prohibition-violence|title=Prohibition = Violence|date=January 29, 2003|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, crime rose 24%, including increases in assault and battery, theft, and burglary.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/a/umn.edu/historpedia/home/politics-and-government/the-eighteenth-amendment-s-contribution-to-increased-crime-and-societal-disobedience-in-the-1920s-fall-2012 Histeropedia - The Eighteenth Amendment’s Contribution to Increased Crime and Societal Disobedience in the 1920s (Fall 2012)]&lt;br/&gt;Rather than reducing the crime rates within the United States, prohibition resulted in an increased crime rate of 24% including increased assault and battery by 13%, homicide rates by 12.7%, and burglaries and theft by 9%.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-prohibition groups arose and worked to have the amendment repealed, once it became apparent that Prohibition was an unprecedented catastrophe. It is alleged that the Eighteenth Amendment failed because of its sudden, strict enforcement. It didn't allow the people to have a say or let them gradually ease into the complete ban of alcoholic beverages. Instead, the people rebelled and the introduction of speakeasies and "flappers" came about.&lt;ref name="gilderlehrman.org"/&gt;

The [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-first Amendment]] repealed the Eighteenth Amendment on December 5, 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Roosevelt |first=Franklin |title=[[s:Repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment|Proclamation 2065 - Repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment]] |date={{date|1933-12-05|mdy}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bootlegging and organized crime ==
Following ratification in 1919 the effects of the amendment were long lasting, leading to increases in crime in many large cities in the United States, like Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles [https://prologue.blogs.archives.gov/2012/01/17/prohibition-and-the-rise-of-the-american-gangster/]. Along with this came many separate forms of illegal alcohol distribution. Examples of this include speakeasies and bootlegging, as well as illegal distilling operations.

Bootlegging got its start in towns bordering Mexico and Canada, as well as in areas with several ports and harbors, a favorite distribution area for bootleggers being Atlantic City, New Jersey. The alcohol was often supplied from various foreign distributors, like Cuba and the Bahamas, or even Newfoundland and islands under rule by the French.

The government in response employed the Coast Guard to search and detain any ships transporting alcohol into the ports, but with this came several complications such as disputes over where jurisdiction lay on the water. This was what made Atlantic City such a hot spot for smuggling operations, because of a shipping point nearly three miles off shore that U.S. officials could not investigate, further complicating enforcement of the amendment. What made matters even worse for the Coast Guard was that they were not well equipped enough to chase down bootlegging vessels. The Coast Guard however, was able to respond to these issues, and began searching vessels out at sea, instead of when they made port, and upgraded their own vehicles allowing for more efficient and consistent arrests.

But even with the advancements in enforcing the amendment, there were still complications that plagued the government's efforts. One issue came in the form of forged prescriptions for alcoholic beverages. Many forms of alcohol were being sold over the counter at the time, under the guise of being for medical purposes. But in truth, these beverages had falsified the evidence that they were medically fit to be sold to consumers.

Bootlegging itself was the leading factor that developed the organized crime-rings in big cities, given that controlling and distributing liquor was a very difficult task to achieve. From that arose many profitable gangs that would control every aspect of the distribution process, whether it be concealed brewing and storage, or even operating a speakeasy, or selling in restaurants and nightclubs run by a specific syndicate. With organized crime becoming a rising problem in the United States, control of specific territories was a key objective among gangs, leading to many violent confrontations with murder rates and burglaries heavily increasing between 1920 and 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://prologue.blogs.archives.gov/2012/01/17/prohibition-and-the-rise-of-the-american-gangster/|title=Prohibition and the Rise of the American Gangster|date=January 17, 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bootlegging was also found to be a gateway crime for many gangs, who would then expand operations into crimes such as prostitution, gambling rackets, narcotics, loan-sharking, extortion and labor rackets, thus causing problems to persist long after the amendment was repealed.

===7th European Parliament===
{{main|Europe of Freedom and Democracy}}

===Formation for the 8th European Parliament===
Following the [[European Parliament election, 2014|2014 European parliament elections]], the [[Europe of Freedom and Democracy]] (EFD) group faced difficulties reforming for the [[Eighth European Parliament|8th European Parliament]], with various member parties and MEPs of the previous term's EFD either defecting to different parliamentary groups or failing to be re-elected.

On 4 June 2014, the [[Danish People's Party]] (Denmark) and [[Finns Party]] (Finland) were admitted into the [[European Conservatives and Reformists]] (ECR) and therefore were no longer attached to the EFD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Keating |first=Dave |url=http://www.europeanvoice.com/article/ecr-group-takes-two-parties-from-farage/ |title=ECR group takes two parties from Farage |publisher=European Voice |date= |accessdate=2014-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Henriette Jacobsen |url=http://www.euractiv.com/sections/eu-elections-2014/eurosceptic-danes-and-finns-leave-farages-group-302612 |title=Eurosceptic Danes and Finns leave Farage's group |publisher=EurActiv |date= |accessdate=2014-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 June 2014, the [[Five Star Movement]] (M5S) of Italy, having been rejected by the [[Greens–European Free Alliance|Greens/EFA]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nielsen |first=Nikolaj |url=http://euobserver.com/eu-elections/124495 |title=EUobserver / Greens reject Beppe Grillo's offer to team up |publisher=Euobserver.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and  [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Group|Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alde.eu/nc/press/press-and-release-news/press-release/article/alde-response-to-the-seven-conditions-of-the-movimento-5-stelle-43004/ |title=Press Release |publisher=Alde.eu |date=2014-01-27 |accessdate=2014-07-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129103727/http://www.alde.eu/nc/press/press-and-release-news/press-release/article/alde-response-to-the-seven-conditions-of-the-movimento-5-stelle-43004/ |archivedate=29 January 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; groups, offered its activists a limited-choice online referendum to choose a European Parliament group for the party, in which 78% of participating activists voted for the EFD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Altri articoli dalla categoria &amp;raquo; |url=http://www.repubblica.it/politica/2014/06/12/news/m5s_blog_grillo_si_vota_su_alleanze_ue-88731934/ |title=Alleanze in Europa, il M5S sceglie l'Ukip di Farage.

On 16 June 2014, Dutch MEP [[Bas Belder]] of the [[Reformed Political Party]] (SGP) moved from the EFD to the ECR group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=EurActiv.com |url=http://www.euractiv.com/sections/eu-elections-2014/dutch-mep-joins-conservatives-farage-trouble-302835 |title=Dutch MEP joins Conservatives, Farage in trouble |publisher=EurActiv |date=2014-06-17 |accessdate=2014-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EFD group was reformed on 18 June 2014 with MEPs from existing member parties: the [[UK Independence Party]] (United Kingdom) and the [[Order and Justice]] (Lithuania), in addition to new affiliates: the Five Star Movement, the [[Sweden Democrats]] (Sweden), the [[Party of Free Citizens]] (Czech Republic), the [[Latvian Farmers Union]] (Latvia) and a French independent MEP, formerly of the [[National Front (France)|National Front]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Euobserver |url=http://euobserver.com/tickers/124651 |title=EUobserver / Farage creates eurosceptic group in EP |publisher=Euobserver.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=James Crisp |url=http://www.euractiv.com/sections/eu-elections-2014/le-pen-candidate-joins-farages-new-efd-group-302906 |title=Le Pen candidate joins Farage's new EFD group |publisher=EurActiv |date=2014-06-18 |accessdate=2014-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 June 2014, the EFD group name was revised to Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy (EFDD), and [[David Borrelli (politician)|David Borrelli]] of the Five Star Movement was chosen as the incoming group's new co-president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2014/06/25/bruxelles-prima-riunione-gruppo-ukip-m5s-farage-e-borrelli-presidenti/285970/ |title=Bruxelles, prima riunione gruppo Ukip-M5S.

===Events during 8th European Parliament===
On 16 October 2014, it was announced that [[Iveta Grigule]] MEP from the Latvian Farmers Union had defected from EFDD to,the ALDE group, resulting in the collapse of the group because it was no longer composed of representatives from at least a quarter of the EU's Member States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/content/20141016IPR74258/html/Opening-Schulz-warns-against-attempts-to-disrupt-Northern-Ireland-peace-process |title=Opening: Schulz warns against attempts to disrupt Northern Ireland peace process |publisher=Europarl.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2015-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Keating |first=Dave |url=http://www.europeanvoice.com/article/efdd-group-collapses/ |title=Farage’s EFDD group collapses – POLITICO |publisher=Europeanvoice.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The criterion was restored on 20 October, with one Polish MEP, [[Robert Iwaszkiewicz]] from [[Congress of the New Right]] (KNP), joining the group,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efdgroup.eu/news/press-releases/item/efdd-group-back-with-a-bang-normal-transmission-resumed |title=EFDD Group back with a bang.

On 8 April 2016, [[Alternative for Germany]] (AfD) MEP [[Beatrix von Storch]] left the ECR group to join EFDD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://euobserver.com/political/130891 |title=Germany's anti-euro party which became two |accessdate=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://euobserver.com/political/132982 |title=Right-wing German MEP quits EU parliament group |accessdate=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 October 2016, [[Steven Woolfe]] left the group to sit as Non-Inscrits, followed by [[Diane James]] on 20 November 2016.

On 9 January 2017, the Five Star Movement voted in an online referendum to leave EFDD in order to join the ALDE group; however, they were rejected by ALDE later the same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/09/five-star-movement-nigel-farage-meps-m5s-alde|title=Ukip's EU funding at risk after M5S quits Nigel Farage's Brussels group|first=Jennifer|last=Rankin|date=9 January 2017|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-italy-5star-ukip-idUKKBN14T1R6|title=EU's Liberals rebuff Italy's 5-Star bid to join parliamentary group|first=Gavin Jones and Julia|last=Fioretti|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38558366|title=EU liberals refuse to unite with Italy Five Star Eurosceptics|website=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath, two MEPs left the group, with [[Marco Affronte]] defected to the Greens/EFA group, and [[Marco Zanni]] to the [[Europe of Nations and Freedom|ENL]] group.&lt;ref name="M5Sdefections"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euractiv.com/section/future-eu/news/grillo-blocks-further-5-star-defections/|title=Grillo blocks further 5 Star defections|website=EURACTIV.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Five Star Movement MEPs pulled out of switching parliamentary group after threatened by party leader [[Beppe Grillo]] with a fine of €250,000.&lt;ref name="M5Sdefections"/&gt;

During the European Parliament debate about [[Catalan independence referendum, 2017|Catalan independence referendum in 2017]], the EFDD, by the voice of [[Ray Finch]] considered that European Union should have made some intervention against Spain to protect Catalan independence. He considered that this referendum led to human rights abuses.

[[File:EleanorRooseveltHumanRights.png|thumb|[[Eleanor Roosevelt]] and the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (1949)—Article 19 states that "Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/ Universal Declaration of Human Rights]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Orator at Speakers Corner, London, with crowd, 1974.jpg|thumb|Orator at [[Speakers' Corner]] in London, 1974]]
'''Freedom of speech''' is a principle that supports the [[freedom]] of an individual or a community to articulate their opinions and ideas without fear of retaliation, [[censorship]], or legal sanction.  The term "'''freedom of expression'''" is sometimes used synonymously but includes any act of seeking, receiving, and imparting information or ideas, regardless of the medium used.

Freedom of expression is recognized as a human right under article 19 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) and recognized in [[international human rights law]] in the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR). Article 19 of the UDHR states that "everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference" and "everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice". The version of Article 19 in the ICCPR later amends this by stating that the exercise of these rights carries "special duties and responsibilities" and may "therefore be subject to certain restrictions" when necessary "[f]or respect of the rights or reputation of others" or "[f]or the protection of national security or of public order (order public), or of public health or morals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Article 19 |url= http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm |work= International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights |publisher= Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights; adopted and opened for signature, ratification and accession by UN General Assembly resolution 2200A (XXI) of 16 December 1966, entry into force 23 March 1976 |date=23 March 1976 |accessdate=13 March 2014 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080705115024/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm |archivedate=5 July 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freedom of speech and expression, therefore, may not be recognized as being absolute, and common limitations to freedom of speech relate to [[libel]], [[slander]], [[obscenity]], [[pornography]], [[sedition]], [[incitement]], [[fighting words]], [[classified information]], [[copyright violation]], [[trade secrets]], [[List of food labeling regulations|food labeling]], [[non-disclosure agreements]], the [[right to privacy]], the [[right to be forgotten]], [[public security]], and [[perjury]]. Justifications for such include the [[harm principle]], proposed by [[John Stuart Mill]] in ''[[On Liberty]]'', which suggests that: "the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others."&lt;ref name="van Mill"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2016/entries/freedom-speech/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=van Mill|first=David|date=1 January 2016 |editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of the "offense principle" is also used in the justification of speech limitations, describing the restriction on forms of expression deemed offensive to society, considering factors such as extent, duration, motives of the speaker, and ease with which it could be avoided.&lt;ref name="van Mill"/&gt; With the evolution of the [[digital age]], application of the freedom of speech becomes more controversial as new means of communication and restrictions arise, for example the [[Golden Shield Project]], an initiative by Chinese government's [[Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Public Security]] that filters potentially unfavorable data from foreign countries.

== Origins ==
Freedom of speech and expression has a long history that predates modern [[international human rights instruments]].&lt;ref name="guardiantimeline" /&gt; It is thought that ancient [[Athenian democracy|Athenian democratic principle]] of free speech may have emerged in the late 6th or early 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Origins of democracy in ancient Greece|first=Kurt|last=Raaflaub|first2=Josiah|last2=Ober|first3=Robert|last3=Wallace|year=2007|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|isbn=0-520-24562-8|page=65|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The values of the [[Roman Republic]] included freedom of speech and [[freedom of religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Classical Review|volume=57|issue=1|date=March 1943|page=49|publisher=The Classical Association|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=9192DF339924E8290F982D7458AFBC06.tomcat1?fromPage=online&amp;aid=4343064|author=M. P. Charlesworth|title=Freedom of Speech in Republican Rome|doi=10.1017/s0009840x00311283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concepts of freedom of speech can be found in early human rights documents.&lt;ref name="guardiantimeline"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/feb/05/religion.news | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Timeline: a history of free speech | first=David | last=Smith |date=5 February 2006 |accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; England's [[Bill of Rights 1689]] legally established the constitutional right of 'freedom of speech in Parliament' which is still in effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|ref=harv |last=Williams |first= E. N. |year=1960| title=The Eighteenth-Century Constitution. 1688–1815 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |oclc=1146699 |pages=26–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]], adopted during the [[French Revolution]] in 1789, specifically affirmed freedom of speech as an inalienable right.&lt;ref name="guardiantimeline" /&gt; The Declaration provides for freedom of expression in Article 11, which states that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The free communication of ideas and opinions is one of the most precious of the rights of man. Every citizen may, accordingly, speak, write, and print with freedom, but shall be responsible for such abuses of this freedom as shall be defined by law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hrcr.org/docs/frenchdec.html|title=Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen|work=Hrcr.org|publisher=www.hrcr.org|accessdate=25 June 2013|author=Arthur W. Diamond Law Library at Columbia Law School|date=26 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Article 19 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], adopted in 1948, states that: &lt;blockquote&gt;Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/ |title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights|author=[[United Nations]]|work=UN.org|accessdate=25 June 2013|date=10 September 1948|publisher=www.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Today, freedom of speech, or the freedom of expression, is recognized in international and regional [[human rights law]]. The right is enshrined in Article 19 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], Article 10 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], Article 13 of the [[American Convention on Human Rights]] and Article 9 of the [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Andrew Puddephatt, Freedom of Expression, The essentials of Human Rights, Hodder Arnold, 2005, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; Based on [[John Milton]]'s arguments, freedom of speech is understood as a multi-faceted right that includes not only the right to express, or disseminate, information and ideas, but three further distinct aspects:
# the right to seek information and ideas;
# the right to receive information and ideas;
# the right to impart information and ideas

International, regional and national standards also recognize that freedom of speech, as the freedom of expression, includes any medium, be it orally, in written, in print, through the [[Internet]] or through art forms. This means that the protection of freedom of speech as a right includes not only the content, but also the means of expression.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

=== Relationship to other rights ===
The right to freedom of speech and expression is closely related to other rights, and may be limited when conflicting with other rights (see [[Freedom of speech#Limitations|limitations on freedom of speech]]).&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The right to freedom of expression is also related to the [[right to a fair trial]] and court proceeding which may limit access to the search for information, or determine the opportunity and means in which freedom of expression is manifested within court proceedings.&lt;ref name=Limitstotolerance&gt;{{cite book | last =Brett| first = Sebastian| title = Limits to tolerance: freedom of expression and the public debate in Chile| publisher = Human Rights Watch| year =1999| location =| page = xxv| url = https://books.google.com/?id=KGS_vAYDdtoC&amp;dq=freedom+of+expression+limitations| doi =| id =| isbn =978-1-56432-192-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a general principle freedom of expression may not limit the [[right to privacy]], as well as the honor and reputation of others. However greater latitude is given when criticism of public figures is involved.&lt;ref name=Limitstotolerance/&gt;

The right to freedom of expression is particularly important for [[News media|media]], which plays a special role as the bearer of the general right to freedom of expression for all.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; However, [[freedom of the press]] does not necessarily enable freedom of speech. Judith Lichtenberg has outlined conditions in which freedom of the press may constrain freedom of speech, for example where the media suppresses information or stifles the diversity of voices inherent in freedom of speech. Lichtenberg argues that [[freedom of the press]] is simply a form of [[property right]] summed up by the principle "no money, no voice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Sanders |first= Karen |title= Ethics &amp; Journalism |publisher= Sage |year= 2003 |page= 68 |url= https://www.google.com/books?id=bnpliIUyO60C&amp;dq=Areopagitica+freedom+of+speech+britain&amp;as_brr=3|isbn= 978-0-7619-6967-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Democracy and social interaction ==
[[File:Free Speech Wall.jpg|thumb|Permanent Free Speech Wall in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]], U.S.]]
Freedom of speech is understood to be fundamental in a democracy. The norms on limiting freedom of expression mean that public debate may not be completely suppressed even in times of emergency.&lt;ref name=Limitstotolerance /&gt; One of the most notable proponents of the link between freedom of speech and [[democracy]] is [[Alexander Meiklejohn]]. He has argued that the concept of democracy is that of self-government by the people. For such a system to work, an informed electorate is necessary. In order to be appropriately knowledgeable, there must be no constraints on the free flow of information and ideas. According to Meiklejohn, democracy will not be true to its essential ideal if those in power are able to manipulate the electorate by withholding information and stifling criticism. Meiklejohn acknowledges that the desire to manipulate opinion can stem from the motive of seeking to benefit society. However, he argues, choosing manipulation negates, in its means, the democratic ideal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Propaganda and the Ethics of Persuasion |last=Marlin |first= Randal |authorlink= |year=2002 |publisher= Broadview Press |location= |isbn=978-1551113760 |pages=226–27 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=Zp38Ot2g7LEC&amp;pg=PA226&amp;dq=%22free+speech%22+democracy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eric Barendt]] has called this defense of free speech on the grounds of democracy "probably the most attractive and certainly the most fashionable free speech theory in modern Western democracies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Propaganda and the Ethics of Persuasion |last=Marlin |first=Randal |authorlink= |year=2002 |publisher= Broadview Press |location= |isbn= 978-1551113760 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Zp38Ot2g7LEC&amp;pg=PA226&amp;dq=%22free+speech%22+democracy |page=226 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas I. Emerson expanded on this defense when he argued that freedom of speech helps to provide a balance between stability and [[Social change|change]]. Freedom of speech acts as a "safety valve" to let off steam when people might otherwise be bent on [[revolution]]. He argues that "The principle of open discussion is a method of achieving a more adaptable and at the same time more stable community, of maintaining the precarious balance between healthy cleavage and necessary consensus."

Research undertaken by the [[Worldwide Governance Indicators]] project at the [[World Bank]], indicates that freedom of speech, and the process of accountability that follows it, have a significant impact in the quality of [[governance]] of a country. "Voice and Accountability" within a country, defined as "the extent to which a country's [[citizen]]s are able to participate in selecting their [[government]], as well as freedom of expression, [[freedom of association]], and [[Freedom of the press|free media]]" is one of the six dimensions of governance that the Worldwide Governance Indicators measure for more than 200 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi2007/pdf/booklet_decade_of_measuring_governance.pdf |title=A Decade of Measuring the Quality of Governance|publisher=World Bank|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408193105/http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi2007/pdf/booklet_decade_of_measuring_governance.pdf|archivedate=8 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Against this backdrop it is important that development agencies create grounds for effective support for a free press in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Freedom of expression promotes democracy|url =  http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/alexander-matschke-promoting-free-media-task-development-policy|first = Alexander|last = Matschke|date = 25 December 2014|website = D+C Development and Cooperation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Moon has developed the argument that the value of freedom of speech and freedom of expression lies with social interactions. Moon writes that "by communicating an individual forms relationships and associations with others – family, friends, co-workers, church congregation, and countrymen. By entering into discussion with others an individual participates in the development of knowledge and in the direction of the community."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Zp38Ot2g7LEC&amp;pg=PA226&amp;dq=%22free+speech%22+democracy|title=Propaganda and the Ethics of Persuasion |last=Marlin |first=Randal |publisher=Broadview Press|year=2002|isbn=978-1551113760|location=|page=229|authorlink=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal systems sometimes recognize certain limits on the freedom of speech, particularly when freedom of speech conflicts with other rights and freedoms, such as in the cases of [[Defamation|libel]], [[Defamation|slander]], [[pornography]], [[obscenity]], [[fighting words]], and [[intellectual property]]. In Europe, blasphemy is a limitation to free speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Brennan |first1=David |title=Calling Prophet Muhammad a Pedophile Not Protected by Free Speech, Court Rules |url=https://www.newsweek.com/calling-prophet-muhammad-pedophile-not-protected-free-speech-court-rules-1189031 |accessdate=27 October 2018 |work=Newsweek |date=26 October 2018 |quote=The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled that calling the Prophet Muhammad a pedophile was not protected by freedom of speech laws.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Chase Winter |title=Calling Prophet Muhammad a pedophile does not fall within freedom of speech: European court |url=https://www.dw.com/en/calling-prophet-muhammad-a-pedophile-does-not-fall-within-freedom-of-speech-european-court/a-46050749 |accessdate=27 October 2018 |work=Deutsche Welle |date=26 October 2018 |quote=An Austrian woman's conviction for calling the Prophet Muhammad a pedophile did not violate her freedom of speech, the European Court of Human Rights ruled Thursday.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lucia I.

[[Censorship of broadcasting in the United States|Limitations to freedom of speech]] may occur through legal sanction or social disapprobation, or both.&lt;ref name="leeds1"&gt;{{cite web | title = Freedom of Speech| work = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy| publisher = | date = 17 April 2008| url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freedom-speech/ | accessdate = 29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain public institutions may also enact policies restricting the freedom of speech, for example [[speech code]]s at [[state school]]s.

In ''[[On Liberty]]'' (1859), [[John Stuart Mill]] argued that "...there ought to exist the fullest liberty of professing and discussing, as a matter of ethical conviction, any doctrine, however immoral it may be considered."&lt;ref name="leeds1" /&gt; Mill argues that the fullest liberty of expression is required to push arguments to their logical limits, rather than the limits of social embarrassment.&lt;ref name="Mill 1859 1-5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mill 1859 2-19"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ten Cate 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wragg 2015"/&gt;  However, Mill also introduced what is known as the harm principle, in placing the following limitation on free expression: "the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others."&lt;ref name="leeds1" /&gt;

In 1985, [[Joel Feinberg]] introduced what is known as the "offense principle", arguing that Mill's harm principle does not provide sufficient protection against the wrongful behaviors of others. Feinberg wrote "It is always a good reason in support of a proposed criminal prohibition that it would probably be an effective way of preventing serious offense (as opposed to injury or harm) to persons other than the actor, and that it is probably a necessary means to that end."&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;{{cite book|title = The Collapse of the Harm Principle|url = http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7037&amp;context=jclc|chapter = Conclusion|author = Harcourt|accessdate = 7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence Feinberg argues that the harm principle sets the bar too high and that some forms of expression can be legitimately prohibited by law because they are very offensive. But, as offending someone is less serious than harming someone, the penalties imposed should be higher for causing harm.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt; In contrast, Mill does not support legal penalties unless they are based on the harm principle.&lt;ref name="leeds1" /&gt; Because the degree to which people may take offense varies, or may be the result of unjustified prejudice, Feinberg suggests that a number of factors need to be taken into account when applying the offense principle, including: the extent, duration and social value of the speech, the ease with which it can be avoided, the motives of the speaker, the number of people offended, the intensity of the offense, and the general interest of the community at large.&lt;ref name="leeds1" /&gt;

Along similar lines as Mill, Jasper Doomen argued that harm should be defined from the point of view of the individual citizen, not limiting harm to physical harm since nonphysical harm may also be involved; Feinberg's distinction between harm and offense is criticized as largely trivial.&lt;ref&gt;Doomen 2014, pp. 111, 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, [[Bernard Harcourt]] wrote of the collapse of the harm principle: "Today the debate is characterized by a cacophony of competing harm arguments without any way to resolve them. There is no longer an argument within the structure of the debate to resolve the competing claims of harm. The original harm principle was never equipped to determine the relative importance of harms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/l/law-phil.htm |chapter=Philosophy of Law|author=Kenneth Einar Himma|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interpretations of both the harm and offense limitations to freedom of speech are culturally and politically relative. For instance, in Russia, the harm and offense principles have been used to justify the [[Russian LGBT propaganda law]] restricting speech (and action) in relation to [[LGBT]] issues. A number of European countries that take pride in freedom of speech nevertheless outlaw speech that might be interpreted as [[Holocaust denial#Laws against Holocaust denial|Holocaust denial]]. These include Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Israel, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, and Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;Lechtholz-Zey, Jacqueline: Laws Banning Holocaust Denial.

In the U.S., the standing landmark opinion on political speech is ''[[Brandenburg v. Ohio]]'' (1969),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Brandenburg v. Ohio]]'', {{ussc|395|444|1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; expressly overruling ''Whitney v. California''.{{sfn|Jasper|1999|p=32}} In ''Brandenburg'', the [[United States Supreme Court|US Supreme Court]] referred to the right even to speak openly of violent action and revolution in broad terms:{{quote|[Our] decisions have fashioned the principle that the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not allow a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing [[imminent lawless action]] and is likely to incite or cause such action.&lt;ref&gt;''Brandenburg'', at 447&lt;/ref&gt;}} The opinion in ''Brandenburg'' discarded the previous test of "clear and present danger" and made the right to freedom of (political) speech's protections in the United States almost absolute.&lt;ref&gt;''Brandenburg'', at 450–01&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Lewis|2007|p=124}} Hate speech is also protected by the First Amendment in the United States, as decided in ''[[R.A.V. v.

Jo Glanville, editor of the ''[[Index on Censorship]]'', states that "the Internet has been a revolution for [[censorship]] as much as for free speech".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/nov/17/censorship-internet |title=The big business of net censorship |last=Glanville  |first=Jo |date=17 November 2008 |work= The Guardian | location=London|accessdate=26 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; International, national and regional standards recognise that freedom of speech, as one form of freedom of expression, applies to any medium, including the [[Internet]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The [[Communications Decency Act]] (CDA) of 1996 was the first major attempt by the [[United States Congress]] to regulate [[pornography|pornographic]] material on the Internet. In 1997, in the landmark [[cyberlaw]] case of ''[[Reno v. ACLU]]'', the [[United States Supreme Court|US Supreme Court]] partially overturned the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Godwin | first = Mike | authorlink =Mike Godwin  | year = 2003 | title = [[Cyber Rights: Defending Free Speech in the Digital Age]] | publisher = MIT Press| isbn = 0-262-57168-4|pages=349–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judge [[Stewart R. Dalzell]], one of the three federal judges who in June 1996 declared parts of the CDA unconstitutional, in his opinion stated the following:&lt;ref name="rowland"&gt;{{cite book|title=Information Technology Law|first=Diane |last=Rowland|pages=463–65|year=2005|isbn= 978-1859417560|publisher=Routledge-Cavendish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Internet is a far more speech-enhancing medium than [[Print media|print]], the [[village green]], or the [[mail]]s. Because it would necessarily affect the Internet itself, the CDA would necessarily reduce the speech available for adults on the medium. This is a constitutionally intolerable result. Some of the dialogue on the Internet surely tests the limits of conventional discourse. Speech on the Internet can be unfiltered, unpolished, and unconventional, even emotionally charged, sexually explicit, and vulgar – in a word, "indecent" in many communities. But we should expect such speech to occur in a medium in which citizens from all walks of life have a voice. We should also protect the autonomy that such a medium confers to ordinary people as well as media magnates.[...] My analysis does not deprive the Government of all means of protecting children from the dangers of Internet communication. The Government can continue to protect children from pornography on the Internet through vigorous enforcement of existing laws criminalizing obscenity and child pornography. [...] As we learned at the hearing, there is also a compelling need for public educations about the benefits and dangers of this new medium, and the Government can fill that role as well. In my view, our action today should only mean that Government's permissible supervision of Internet contents stops at the traditional line of unprotected speech. [...] The absence of governmental regulation of Internet content has unquestionably produced a kind of chaos, but as one of the plaintiff's experts put it with such resonance at the hearing: "What achieved success was the very chaos that the Internet is. The strength of the Internet is chaos." Just as the strength of the Internet is chaos, so that strength of our liberty depends upon the chaos and cacophony of the unfettered speech the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] protects.&lt;ref name="rowland" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[World Summit on the Information Society]] (WSIS) Declaration of Principles adopted in 2003 makes specific reference to the importance of the right to freedom of expression for the "[[Information society|Information Society]]" in stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We reaffirm, as an essential foundation of the Information society, and as outlined in Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, that everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; that this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers. Communication is a fundamental social process, a basic human need and the foundation of all social organisation. It is central to the [[Information society|Information Society]]. Everyone, everywhere should have the opportunity to participate and no one should be excluded from the benefits of the Information Society offers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Klang | first1 = Mathias| last2 = Murray| first2 = Andrew| title = Human Rights in the Digital Age| publisher = Routledge| year = 2005|page=1 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=USksfqPjwhUC&amp;dq=%22digital+rights%22+human+rights | isbn = 978-1-904385-31-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Bernt Hugenholtz and Lucie Guibault the [[public domain]] is under pressure from the "[[commodification]] of information" as information with previously little or no economic value has acquired independent economic value in the information age. This includes factual data, [[personal data]], [[genetic information]] and pure [[idea]]s. The commodification of information is taking place through [[intellectual property]] law, [[contract law]], as well as broadcasting and telecommunications law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Guibault| first = Lucy|last2=Hugenholtz |first2=Bernt| title = The future of the public domain: identifying the commons in information law| publisher = Kluwer Law International| year = 2006| page = 1| url = https://www.google.com/books?id=KJmNGglq0nwC&amp;dq=public+domain&amp;as_brr=3| isbn = 9789041124357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Freedom of information ===
{{Main|Freedom of information}}
Freedom of information is an extension of freedom of speech where the medium of expression is the [[Internet]]. Freedom of information may also refer to the [[right to privacy]] in the context of the Internet and [[information technology]]. As with the right to freedom of expression, the right to privacy is a recognised [[human right]] and freedom of information acts as an extension to this right.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite magazine |url = http://freenetproject.org/papers/freenet-ieee.pdf |title = Protecting Free Expression Online with Freenet |magazine = Internet Computing|publisher =  IEEE|last1 = Clarke |first1 = Ian|last2 = Miller|first2 = Scott G.|last3= Hong|first3 = Theodore W.|last4 = Sandberg|first4= Oskar|last5 = Wiley|first5 = Brandon|date = 2002|pages =40–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freedom of information may also concern [[censorship]] in an information technology context, i.e. the ability to access [[Web content]], without censorship or restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pauli|first=Darren|date=14 January 2008|url=http://www.thestandard.com/news/2008/01/14/industry-rejects-australian-govt-sanitized-internet-measure|title=Industry rejects Australian gov't sanitized Internet measure|work=[[The Industry Standard]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120912112920/http://www.thestandard.com/news/2008/01/14/industry-rejects-australian-govt-sanitized-internet-measure|archivedate=12 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freedom of information is also explicitly protected by acts such as the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act of Ontario, in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Sourcebook of Canadian Media Law|pages=232–34|first=Robert|last=Martin|last2=Adam |first2=G.

=== Internet censorship ===
{{Main |Internet censorship |Internet censorship by country}}
The concept of [[freedom of information]] has emerged in response to state sponsored censorship, monitoring and surveillance of the internet. Internet censorship includes the control or suppression of the publishing or accessing of information on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 =Deibert|first1 = Robert|last2= Palfrey|first2= John G|last3 = Rohozinski|first3 = Rafal| last4= Zittrain|first4 = Jonathan|date =2008|title=Access denied: the practice and policy of global Internet filtering |publisher = MIT Press|isbn = 978-0262541961}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Global Internet Freedom Consortium]] claims to remove blocks to the "free flow of information" for what they term "closed societies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internetfreedom.org/mission.html|title=Our Mission|publisher=Global Internet Freedom Consortium|accessdate=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170927182331/http://www.internetfreedom.org/mission.html|archivedate=27 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Reporters without Borders]] (RWB) "internet enemy list" the following states engage in pervasive internet censorship: [[China]], [[Cuba]], [[Iran]], [[Myanmar]]/[[Burma]], [[North Korea]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Syria]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Uzbekistan]], and [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref name=RWBEnemies&gt;{{cite web|url = http://march12.rsf.org/i/Internet_Enemies.pdf |title =Internet Enemies|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110315002153/http://march12.rsf.org/i/Internet_Enemies.pdf |deadurl = yes|archivedate=15 March 2011 |publisher = Reporters Without Borders |location= Paris|date =  March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A widely publicized example of internet censorship is the "[[Great Firewall of China]]" (in reference both to its role as a [[firewall (networking)|network firewall]] and to the ancient [[Great Wall of China]]). The system blocks content by preventing [[IP address]]es from being routed through and consists of standard firewall and [[proxy server]]s at the [[Internet]] [[gateway (telecommunications)|gateways]]. The system also selectively engages in [[DNS poisoning]] when particular sites are requested. The government does not appear to be systematically examining Internet content, as this appears to be technically impractical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/china/story/0,,1713317,00.html|author=Watts, Jonathan |date=20 February 2006 |title=War of the words |publisher=[[The Guardian]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China]] is conducted under a wide variety of laws and administrative regulations, including more than sixty regulations directed at the Internet.

Before the invention of the [[printing press]] a written work, once created, could only be physically multiplied by highly laborious and error-prone manual copying. No elaborate system of censorship and control over [[scribes]] existed, who until the 14th century were restricted to religious institutions, and their works rarely caused wider controversy. In response to the [[printing press]], and the ''[[heresies]]'' it allowed to spread, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] moved to impose censorship.&lt;ref name="de Sola Pool 1983 14"&gt;{{Cite book | last = de Sola Pool| first = Ithiel | title = Technologies of freedom| publisher = Harvard University Press| year = 1983 | page = 14 | url = https://www.google.com/books?id=BzLXGUxV4CkC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=%22Censorship+and+Control%22#v=onepage| isbn = 978-0-674-87233-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Printing allowed for multiple exact copies of a work, leading to a more rapid and widespread circulation of ideas and information (see [[print culture]]).&lt;ref name="MacQueen 2007 34"&gt;{{Cite book | last = MacQueen | first = Hector L |last2=Waelde |first2=Charlotte |last3=Laurie |first3=Graeme T | title = Contemporary Intellectual Property: Law and Policy | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2007 | page = 34 | url = https://www.google.com/books?id=_Iwcn4pT0OoC&amp;dq=contemporary+intellectual+property | isbn = 978-0-19-926339-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origins of [[copyright law]] in most European countries lie in efforts by the Roman Catholic Church and governments to regulate and control the output of printers.&lt;ref name="MacQueen 2007 34" /&gt;

In 1501 [[Pope Alexander VI]] issued a Bill against the unlicensed printing of books and in 1559 the [[Index Expurgatorius]], or ''List of Prohibited Books'', was issued for the first time.&lt;ref name="de Sola Pool 1983 14" /&gt; The Index Expurgatorius is the most famous and long lasting example of "bad books" catalogues issued by the Roman Catholic Church, which presumed to be in authority over private thoughts and opinions, and suppressed views that went against its doctrines. The Index Expurgatorius was administered by the [[Roman Inquisition]], but enforced by local government authorities, and went through 300 editions. Amongst others, it banned or [[censored]] books written by [[René Descartes]], [[Giordano Bruno]], [[Galileo Galilei]], [[David Hume]], [[John Locke]], [[Daniel Defoe]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and [[Voltaire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Castillo| first = Anastasia| title = Banned Books: Censorship in Eighteenth-Century England| publisher = GRIN Verlag| year = 2010| page = 12| url = https://books.google.com/?id=CqaAGfL-IQIC&amp;dq=Giordano+Bruno+censorship| isbn = 978-3-640-71688-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; While governments and church encouraged printing in many ways because it allowed for the dissemination of [[Bible]]s and government information, works of dissent and criticism could also circulate rapidly. As a consequence, governments established controls over printers across Europe, requiring them to have official licenses to trade and produce books.&lt;ref name="MacQueen 2007 34" /&gt;

The notion that the expression of dissent or subversive views should be tolerated, not censured or punished by law, developed alongside the rise of [[printing]] and the [[News media|press]]. ''[[Areopagitica]]'', published in 1644, was [[John Milton]]'s response to the [[Parliament of England|Parliament of England's]] re-introduction of government licensing of printers, hence [[publishers]].&lt;ref name="Sanders 2003 66" /&gt; Church authorities had previously ensured that Milton's [[Milton's divorce tracts|essay on the right to divorce]] was refused a license for publication.

Milton's defense of freedom of expression was grounded in a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] worldview and he thought that the English people had the mission to work out the truth of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], which would lead to the [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] of all people. But Milton also articulated the main strands of future discussions about freedom of expression. By defining the scope of freedom of expression and of "harmful" speech Milton argued against the principle of pre-censorship and in favor of tolerance for a wide range of views.&lt;ref name="Sanders 2003 66" /&gt; Freedom of the press ceased being regulated in England in 1695 when the Licensing Order of 1643 was allowed to expire after the introduction of the [[Bill of Rights 1689]] shortly after the Glorious Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/journalists/gordon-rayner/8812486/Leveson-Inquiry-British-press-freedom-is-a-model-for-the-world-editor-tells-inquiry.html | title=Leveson Inquiry: British press freedom is a model for the world, editor tells inquiry | publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited | work=The Telegraph | date=7 October 2011 | accessdate=9 May 2018 | author=Rayner, Gordon | quote=Mr Rusbridger said: “When people talk about licensing journalists or newspapers the instinct should be to refer them to history.

Several MPs now want to replace this with a principle whereby MPs define the parameters under which the press operates – and “work together”. It is a hideous idea that must be resisted. The last time this happened was under the Licensing Order of 1643, which was allowed to expire in 1695 after the introduction of the 1688 Bill of Rights shortly after the Glorious Revolution. As I wrote in my Daily Telegraph column  yesterday, it’s amazing that so many Tory MPs should want to turn the clock back 300 years.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of publications like the ''[[Tatler (1709)|Tatler]]'' (1709) and the ''[[The Spectator (1711)|Spectator]]'' (1711) are given credit for creating a 'bourgeois public sphere' in England that allowed for a free exchange of ideas and information.

As the "menace" of printing spread, more governments attempted to centralize control.&lt;ref name="de Sola Pool 1983 15"&gt;{{Cite book | last = de Sola Pool| first = Ithiel | title = Technologies of freedom| publisher = Harvard University Press| year = 1983 | page = 15 | url = https://www.google.com/books?id=BzLXGUxV4CkC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=Areopagitica+freedom+of+speech+britain&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=36#v=onepage| isbn = 978-0-674-87233-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[French crown]] repressed printing and the printer [[Etienne Dolet]] was burned at the stake in 1546. In 1557 the [[British Crown]] thought to stem the flow of seditious and heretical books by chartering the [[Stationers' Company]]. The right to print was limited to the members of that guild, and thirty years later the [[Star Chamber]] was chartered to curtail the "greate enormities and abuses" of "dyvers contentyous and disorderlye persons professinge the arte or mystere of pryntinge or selling of books." The right to print was restricted to two universities and to the 21 existing printers in the [[city of London]], which had 53 [[printing presses]]. As the British crown took control of type founding in 1637 printers fled to the [[Netherlands]]. Confrontation with authority made printers radical and rebellious, with 800 authors, printers and book dealers being incarcerated in the [[Bastille]] in Paris before it was stormed in 1789.&lt;ref name="de Sola Pool 1983 15" /&gt;

A succession of English thinkers was at the forefront of early discussion on a right to freedom of expression, among them [[John Milton]] (1608–74) and [[John Locke]] (1632–1704). Locke established the [[individual]] as the unit of value and the bearer of rights to [[right to life|life]], [[right to liberty|liberty]], [[right to property|property]] and the [[pursuit of happiness]]. However Locke's ideas evolved primarily around the concept of the right to seek salvation for one's soul, and was thus primarily concerned with theological matters. Locke neither supported a universal toleration of peoples nor freedom of speech; according to his ideas, some groups, such as atheists, should not be allowed.&lt;ref name="jonathanisrael"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan Israel|title=Radical Enlightenment|publisher=Oxford University Press|year= 2002|pages= 265–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the second half of the 17th century philosophers on the European continent like [[Baruch Spinoza]] and [[Pierre Bayle]] developed ideas encompassing a more universal aspect freedom of speech and toleration than the early English philosophers.&lt;ref name="jonathanisrael" /&gt; By the 18th century the idea of freedom of speech was being discussed by thinkers all over the Western world, especially by French [[philosophes]] like [[Denis Diderot]], [[Baron d'Holbach]] and [[Claude Adrien Helvétius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan Israel|title=Enlightenment Contested|publisher= Oxford University Press|year= 2006|pages= 155ff, 781ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea began to be incorporated in political theory both in theory as well as practice; the first state edict in history proclaiming complete freedom of speech was the one issued December 4, 1770 in [[Denmark-Norway]] during the regency of [[Johann Friedrich Struensee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan Israel|title=A Revolution of the Mind|publisher= Princeton University Press|year= 2010|page= 76}}&lt;/ref&gt; However Struensee himself imposed some minor limitations to this edict in October 7, 1771, and it was even further limited after the fall of Struensee with legislation introduced in 1773, although censorship was not reintroduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=H.

[[John Stuart Mill]] (1806–1873) argued that without human freedom there can be no progress in science, law or politics, which according to Mill required free discussion of opinion. Mill's ''[[On Liberty]]'', published in 1859 became a classic defence of the right to freedom of expression.&lt;ref name="Sanders 2003 66" /&gt; Mill argued that [[truth]] drives out falsity, therefore the free expression of ideas, true or false, should not be feared. Truth is not stable or fixed, but evolves with time. Mill argued that much of what we once considered true has turned out false. Therefore, views should not be prohibited for their apparent falsity. Mill also argued that free discussion is necessary to prevent the "deep slumber of a decided opinion". Discussion would drive the onwards march of truth and by considering false views the basis of true views could be re-affirmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sanders| first = Karen| title = Ethics &amp; Journalism| publisher = Sage| year = 2003| page = 67| url = https://www.google.com/books?id=bnpliIUyO60C&amp;dq=Areopagitica+freedom+of+speech+britain&amp;as_brr=3| isbn = 978-0-7619-6967-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Mill argued that an opinion only carries intrinsic value to the owner of that opinion, thus silencing the expression of that opinion is an injustice to a basic human right. For Mill, the only instance in which speech can be justifiably suppressed is in order to prevent harm from a clear and direct threat. Neither economic or moral implications, nor the speakers own well-being would justify suppression of speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Warburton| first = Nigel| title = Free Speech: A Very Short Introduction| publisher = Oxford| year = 2009| pages = 24–29| url = https://books.google.com/?id=nJ0uf50ZtzsC&amp;printsec=frontcover| isbn = 978-0-19-923235-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Evelyn Beatrice Hall]]'s biography of [[Voltaire]], she coined the following sentence to illustrate Voltaire's beliefs: "I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it."&lt;ref name="paulboller" /&gt; Hall's quote is frequently cited to describe the principle of freedom of speech.&lt;ref name="paulboller"&gt;{{cite book |last=Boller, Jr. |first=Paul F. |authorlink= |author2=George, John |title=They Never Said It: A Book of Fake Quotes, Misquotes, and Misleading Attributions |year=1989 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |pages=124–26 |isbn=0-19-505541-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th Century, Noam Chomsky states that: "If you believe in freedom of speech, you believe in freedom of speech for views you don't like. Dictators such as [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] and [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]], were in favor of freedom of speech for views they liked only. If you're in favor of freedom of speech, that means you're in favor of freedom of speech precisely for views you despise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV Media|title=[[Manufacturing Consent: Noam Chomsky and the Media]]|year=1992|people= Mark Achbar and Peter Wintonick}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lee Bollinger]] argues that "the free speech principle involves a special act of carving out one area of social interaction for extraordinary self-restraint, the purpose of which is to develop and demonstrate a social capacity to control feelings evoked by a host of social encounters." Bollinger argues that [[Toleration|tolerance]] is a desirable value, if not essential. However, critics argue that society should be concerned by those who directly deny or advocate, for example, [[genocide]] (see limitations above).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Lee C.|last =  Bollinger|title=The Tolerant Society: Freedom of Speech and Extremist Speech in America|publisher=Oxford University Press|location= |year= 1986|isbn = 0195040007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1928 novel ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' by [[D. H. Lawrence]] was banned for [[obscenity]] in a number of countries, including the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia and Canada. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, it was the subject of landmark court rulings which saw the ban for obscenity overturned. Dominic Sandbrook of ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' in the UK wrote, "Now that public obscenity has become commonplace, it is hard to recapture the atmosphere of a society that saw fit to ban books such as ''Lady Chatterley’s Lover'' because it was likely to “deprave and corrupt” its readers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/8066784/Lady-Chatterley-trial-50-years-on.-The-filthy-book-that-set-us-free-and-fettered-us-forever.html |title= Lady Chatterley trial - 50 years on.

Now that public obscenity has become commonplace, it is hard to recapture the atmosphere of a society that saw fit to ban books such as Lady Chatterley’s Lover because it was likely to “deprave and corrupt” its readers. Although only half a century separates us from Harold Macmillan’s Britain, the world of 1960 can easily seem like ancient history. In a Britain when men still wore heavy grey suits, working women were still relatively rare and the Empire was still, just, a going concern, D H Lawrence’s book was merely one of many banned because of its threat to public morality.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fred Kaplan of ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated the overturning of the obscenity laws "set off an explosion of free speech" in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/21/opinion/21kaplan.html |title= The Day Obscenity Became Art |work= The New York Times |date=July 20, 2009 |accessdate=May 9, 2018 |author= Kaplan, Fred |quote=TODAY is the 50th anniversary of the court ruling that overturned America’s obscenity laws, setting off an explosion of free speech — and also, in retrospect, splashing cold water on the idea, much discussed during Sonia Sotomayor’s Supreme Court confirmation hearings, that judges are “umpires” rather than agents of social change.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The right to freedom of expression has been interpreted to include the right to take and publish photographs of strangers in public areas without their permission or knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.newseuminstitute.org/first-amendment-center/topics/freedom-of-the-press/photography-first-amendment/ |title= Photography &amp; First Amendment |last= Kenworthy |first= Bill |date = April 2012|website = Newseum Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.aclu.org/issues/free-speech/photographers-rights | title=Photographers' Rights | publisher=American Civil Liberties Union | accessdate=9 May 2018 | work=aclu.org | quote=Taking photographs and video of things that are plainly visible in public spaces is a constitutional right—and that includes transportation facilities, the outside of federal buildings, and police and other government officials carrying out their duties.

Other people have ended up in FBI databases for taking innocuous photographs of public places.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Golden Cavalry of St George''' was the colloquial name of subsidies paid out by the British government to other [[Europe]]an states in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, particularly during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zl8TAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA99&amp;lpg=PA99&amp;dq=Golden+Cavalry+of+St+George+coins&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NK6LsPmkkB&amp;sig=efFN7Cb1Fhp6Lv1_lwMGaYhpXQc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiCjsbqqPbbAhUKU1AKHcmCCjoQ6AEIczAO#v=onepage&amp;q=Golden%20Cavalry%20of%20St%20George%20coins&amp;f=false|website=Google Books|title=Fragile by Design: The Political Origins of Banking Crises and Scarce Credit by Charles W. Calomiris, Stephen H. Haber}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The name is a [[euphemism]] and derives from the British [[Sovereign (British coin)|Sovereign]] gold coins, often used in these payments, which bear an image of [[Saint George]], the patron saint of [[England]], on horseback slaying the dragon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-a-1911-gold-sovereign-in-a-mount-used-as-a-mans-ring-with-an-image-49020341.html?pv=1&amp;stamp=2&amp;imageid=7BEEEBEC-91BC-4C3F-9F8D-9228BAEFF800&amp;p=197160&amp;n=0&amp;orientation=0&amp;pn=1&amp;searchtype=0&amp;IsFromSearch=1&amp;srch=foo%3dbar%26st%3d0%26pn%3d1%26ps%3d100%26sortby%3d2%26resultview%3dsortbyPopular%26npgs%3d0%26qt%3dst%2520george%2520slaying%2520a%2520dragon%26qt_raw%3dst%2520george%2520slaying%2520a%2520dragon%26lic%3d3%26mr%3d0%26pr%3d0%26ot%3d0%26creative%3d%26ag%3d0%26hc%3d0%26pc%3d%26blackwhite%3d%26cutout%3d%26tbar%3d1%26et%3d0x000000000000000000000%26vp%3d0%26loc%3d0%26imgt%3d0%26dtfr%3d%26dtto%3d%26size%3d0xFF%26archive%3d1%26groupid%3d%26pseudoid%3d%26a%3d%26cdid%3d%26cdsrt%3d%26name%3d%26qn%3d%26apalib%3d%26apalic%3d%26lightbox%3d%26gname%3d%26gtype%3d%26xstx%3d0%26simid%3d%26saveQry%3d%26editorial%3d1%26nu%3d%26t%3d%26edoptin%3d%26customgeoip%3d%26cap%3d1%26cbstore%3d1%26vd%3d0%26lb%3d%26fi%3d2%26edrf%3d%26ispremium%3d1%26flip%3d0|website=Alamy.com|title=Image of British gold sovereign}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

During the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] Britain kept Austria afloat by large subsidies owing to the [[Anglo-Austrian Alliance]]. Eight years later in the [[Seven Years' War]] they did the same for [[Prussia]], who were now their allies against the Austrians. The [[Anglo-Prussian Convention]] signed in April 1758 guaranteed Prussia a payment of £670,000 a year.

In more recent times [[T. E. Lawrence|Lawrence of Arabia]] is reported to have made payments of these gold sovereigns to Arab soldiers during the [[Arab Revolt]] in return for their cooperation and he was nicknamed in [[Arabic]] 'Abu Khayyal' meaning 'father of the horsemen'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lK-nQ47S-XwC&amp;pg=PT82&amp;lpg=PT82&amp;dq=Golden+Cavalry+of+St+George+payment&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=72n9SqKA0Z&amp;sig=IY8rCkbQ8t1U14-VIUhTfvO0OmA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwieyv-DqPbbAhXJyaQKHQz3ANgQ6AEIdzAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Golden%20Cavalry%20of%20St%20George%20payment&amp;f=false|website=Google Books|title=The Golden Warrior: The Life and Legend of Lawrence of Arabia by Lawrence James}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

During [[World War II]] The 'cavalry of St George' was a euphemism for large scale bribery of the Spanish officials in [[Francisco Franco|Franco's]] dictatorship to prevent Spain from joining the Germans in the war&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ChU4DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT203&amp;lpg=PT203&amp;dq=british+spies+espionage+bribes+golden+cavalry+st+george&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yMyku9eWVP&amp;sig=X4dm9g6TOLkCE9QLnM1eSfk0D48&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQhJWrsvbbAhUQ2qQKHWMKAUAQ6AEINTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=british%20spies%20espionage%20bribes%20golden%20cavalry%20st%20george&amp;f=false|website=Google Books|title=Trotsky's Favourite Spy: The Life Of George Alexander Hill by Peter Day}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Napoleonic Wars==
During the [[Napoleonic Wars]] a number of European states were allied with the British against [[France]]. Britain, which had a [[Royal Navy|large navy]] but a small army, was unable to deploy major forces on the European continent. As Britain was a wealthy commercial power, they were able to pay out millions of pounds to Allied nations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nOSGCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA93&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;dq=Golden+Cavalry+of+St+George+coins&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=n2HYy6Ja7Y&amp;sig=kvBep4sYFHjxH3O83FvEoopOAS8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQnZTcpvbbAhUIKewKHZ8XCFoQ6AEIbjAO#v=onepage&amp;q=Golden%20Cavalry%20of%20St%20George%20coins&amp;f=false|website= Google Books|title=The Georgians in 100 Facts by Mike Rendell}}&lt;/ref&gt;, who could field much larger armies against the French. An example is the £1,500,000 paid to [[Austria]] to commit troops to the [[Flanders Campaign|campaign against the French]] in the [[Netherlands]] in 1793, an expedition to which the British could contribute only men.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey p.&lt;/ref&gt; Adjusted for inflation, this is equivalent to £273,000,000 in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/education/Pages/inflation/calculator/flash/default.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6NA5SosVg?url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/education/Pages/inflation/calculator/flash/default.aspx |archivedate=2014-02-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large sums were made available for the purpose, sometimes as formal subsidies and sometimes as bribes for European statesman. This was partly funded by the introduction of the [[Income Tax]] by Prime Minister [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]]. Though the policy was extremely costly, it ultimately proved successful as a coalition of European nations eventually defeated France in 1814.

The '''Gordon–Loeb''' /ˈgȯr-dən ˈlōb/ '''Model''' is a mathematical [[economic model]] analyzing the optimal investment level in [[information security]].

Investing to protect company data involves a cost that, unlike other investments, usually does not generate profit. It does, however, serve to prevent additional costs. Thus, it’s important to compare how expensive it is to protect a specific set of data, with the potential loss in case said data is stolen, lost, damaged or corrupted. To draft this model, the company must possess knowledge of three parameters: how much the data is worth; how much the data is at risk; the probability an attack on the data is going to be successful. This last parameter, Gordon and Loeb defined as '''vulnerability'''. The product of said parameters provides the medium money loss with no security investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Big Data e Privacy by design|author=Giuseppe D'Acquisto, Maurizio Naldi|publisher=G.Giappichelli Editor|isbn=978-88-921-0629-1|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=Ig9EDgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=it&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Gordon-Loeb.png|thumb|Ideal level of investment in company computer security, given decreasing incremental returns]]

From the model we can gather that the amount of money a company spends in protecting information should, in most cases, be only a small fraction of the predicted loss (for example, [[expected value]] of a loss following a [[security breach]]). Specifically, the model shows that it is generally inconvenient to invest in informatics security (including [[cybersecurity]] or [[computer security]] related activities) for amounts higher than '''37%''' of the predicted loss. The Gordon-Loeb model also shows that, for a specific level of potential loss, the amount of resources to invest in order to protect an information set does not always increase with the increase in [[vulnerability (computing)|vulnerability]] of said set. Thus, companies can enjoy greater economic returns by investing in cyber/information security activities aimed to increase the security of data sets with a medium level of vulnerability. In other words, the investment in safeguarding a company’s data reduces vulnerability with '''decreasing incremental returns'''.

'''Example''': suppose an estimated data value of '''1.000.000 euros''', with an attack probability of '''15%''', and an '''80%''' chance that an attack would be successful. In this case, the potential loss is given by the product '''1.000.000 euros x 0.15 x 0.8 = 120.000 euros'''. According to Gordon and Loeb, the company’s investment in security should not exceed '''120.000 euros x 0.37 = 44.000 euros'''.

The Gordon–Loeb Model was first published by [[Lawrence A. Gordon]] and [[Martin P. Loeb]] in their 2002 paper, in [http://tissec.acm.org/ ''ACM Transactions on Information and System Security''], entitled "The Economics of Information Security Investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gordon|first=Lawrence|author2=Martin Loeb|title=The Economics of Information Security Investment|journal=ACM Transactions on Information and System Security|date=November 2002|volume=5|issue=4|pages=438–457|doi=10.1145/581271.581274}}&lt;/ref&gt;" The paper was reprinted in the 2004 book [https://www.springer.com/computer/theoretical+computer+science/book/978-1-4020-8089-0 Economics of Information Security]. Gordon and Loeb are both Professors at the [[University of Maryland]]'s [[Robert H. Smith School of Business]].

The Gordon–Loeb Model is one of the most well accepted analytical models  in the "economics of cyber/information security" literature. The Model has been widely referenced in the academic and practitioner literature.&lt;ref name="econinfosec"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weis2008.econinfosec.org/papers/Matsuura.pdf|date=23 April 2008|title=Productivity Space of Information Security in an Extension of the Gordon-Loeb's Investment Model|author=Kanta Matsuura|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="psu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.60.9931|title=CiteSeerX — On the Gordon&amp;Loeb Model for Information Security Investment|publisher=citeseerx.ist.psu.edu|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ieee"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?reload=true&amp;tp=&amp;arnumber=5438086&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D5438086|title=IEEE Xplore Abstract - Extending the Gordon-Loeb Model for Information Security Investment|publisher=ieeexplore.ieee.org|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Managing Information Risk and the Economics of Security|author=Johnson, E.|date=2009|publisher=Springer-Verlag|isbn=9780387097626|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PHAaT9KjbmkC|page=99|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bibsonomy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/79b784185a4be9d45abd80a74a1c294d|title=BibSonomy  :: publication :: The Gordon-Loeb Investment Model Generalized: Time Dependent Multiple Threats and Breach Losses over an Investment Period.|publisher=bibsonomy.org|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="utwente"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eprints.eemcs.utwente.nl/5693/01/00000177.pdf|date=15 June 2006|title=An Overview of Economic Approaches to Information Security Management|author=Xiaomeng Su|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="uni-muenster"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wi1.uni-muenster.de/security/publications/Boehme2010_SecurityInvestment-IWSEC.pdf|date=29 August 2010|title=Security Metrics and Security Investment Models|author=Rainer Böhme|publisher=International Computer Science Institute, Berkeley, California|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="repository"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://repository.ust.hk/dspace/handle/1783.1/5020|title=An  economic model of investment in information security - HKUST Institutional Repository|publisher=repository.ust.hk|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nii"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110003298595|title=CiNii 論文&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;最適投資モデルに基づくセキュアシステム設計と事例研究|publisher=ci.nii.ac.jp|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model has also been empirically tested in several different settings.

'''Hardline''' is a [[deep ecology]] subculture that has its roots in the [[vegan]] [[straight edge]] [[hardcore punk]] scene.

From an initial founding statement the movement attempted a break with the straight edge and hardcore scenes. The founding statement and subsequent literature pushed a [[biocentrism (ethics)|biocentric]] view of the world, [[anti-abortion movements|anti-abortion]] stance and much more extreme version of straight edge. Many hardline bands existed, the most well known of which were [[Vegan Reich]]&lt;ref name=vr/&gt; and [[Raid (band)|Raid]].&lt;ref name=raid/&gt;

==Beliefs==
The hardline philosophy forbids its adherents from smoking or chewing any form of [[tobacco]], drinking [[alcoholic beverage]]s, and using illicit [[drug]]s or employing [[medicine]]. Hardliners (as they are called) are expected to follow a strict dietary regimen based on the above-mentioned pillars of respect for innocent life and the "natural order". Hardliners eat only foods that are [[veganism|vegan]] and relatively natural (e.g. brown rice over white, evaporated cane juice over white sugar, organic produce over conventional, natural oils over hydrogenated).  [[Human rights]] issues are also factored into the movement's food politics, and followers are urged to shun third-world [[cash crop]]s such as coffee, chocolate, sugar, and most tropical fruits.  Hardliners include caffeine in their stance on mind-altering drugs so the first two items are generally abstained from, but consumption of the last two is often given more leeway.&lt;ref name=sj/&gt;&lt;ref name=nagia/&gt;

In keeping with its [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] view of the natural order, the sexual politics of the hardline movement are very conservative.  Sex is not allowed except for the reason of procreation; thus [[homosexuality]] is seen as anathema, [[pornography]] and [[masturbation]] is abjured, birth control is avoided, and abortion is militantly opposed.  Although the official hardline stance on sex is that its natural purpose is purely procreative, many hardliners justify recreational sex within the context of committed relationships as potentially procreative by opting not to use birth control.

Hardline has always been highly syncretic (over time absorbing influences from [[Islam]] and a host of other schools of thought) and initially claimed a [[Taoism|Taoist]]&lt;ref name=Muttaqi/&gt; foundation for their sexual morals. This appeal to the orientation of the punk and hardcore scenes met with little success, and the topics of abortion and homosexuality have always been sources of tension between hardliners and their subcultural cousins.&lt;ref name=sj/&gt;&lt;ref name=nagia/&gt;

==History==
{{Original research|section|date=June 2013}}
The hardline subculture grew out of the hardcore and hardcore punk scenes in the 1990s.  Although one of the basic tenets of hardline is that it has existed in various forms since the beginning of time, the ideology was largely formulated by Sean Muttaqi of the band Vegan Reich. The hardline philosophy is said to be rooted in one ethic (the sacredness of innocent life), but in reality the ethos rested on that base and on an idea of an immutable natural order.  Hardline can be described as a synthesis of [[deep ecology]], [[straight edge]], [[veganism]] and the [[animal rights movement]].

Hardline began to attract followers shortly after the 1990 release of Vegan Reich's ''Hardline'' EP and the official founding of the subculture.  Other bands soon formed; the most notable of them being Raid from Tennessee.

Sean Muttaqi, as editor of the zine ''Vanguard'' (hardline's official press organ), was able to exert ideological influence on the movement, and caused the center of its activities to become shifted to Tennessee.  Many in the Memphis hardcore scene adopted Hardline stances and started editing magazines, organizing protests, engaging in direct action against industries that exploited animals, and otherwise acting on their new beliefs. Some of the most notable achievements of Memphis Hardline were organizing the movement's first annual gathering and founding the long-standing [[Coalition to Abolish the Fur Trade]] (CAFT).

Things began to fade in Memphis. Muttaqi left for [[Jamaica]] to explore [[Rastafari]] and decided to leave the hardcore scene along with hardline altogether. Editing was transferred of ''Vanguard''. 

Hardliners were instrumental in CAFT, the [[Animal Defense League]], and Vegans For Life.  Some were also involved in [[Earth First!]], [[anti-imperialist]] organizations, and other leftist causes and groups.

Some Hardliners from Massachusetts set out to establish an intentional community in Hawaii. The effort quickly failed due to personality conflicts (especially the ongoing debate among group members as to whether or not cooked food was natural enough) and a distinct lack of required agricultural and engineering skills.  In an ironic coincidence, this self-defeating arc reflects tensions in similarly idealistic communes of the 1960s and 1970s during the [[History of the hippie movement]] and the [[back-to-the-land movement]].

Hardline was undoubtedly heavily inspired from its inception by straight edge.  The original logo of the movement was an outline of a large "X" (the sign most often associated with straightedge) with two crossed [[M16 rifle]]s inside it. Muttaqi has said that he was first exposed to the idea of fusing veganism and abstinence from drugs by an English punk named Rat. Rat had allegedly coined the term "vegan straight edge" by the mid-1980s.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} However, Rat was doing little to spread his ideology while Muttaqi was transforming and propagating it. Vegan Reich was for many in the hardcore scene their first exposure to ideas about militant animal liberation, and the controversy they aroused drew considerable attention to their positions.  Those in the subculture who gravitated toward animal-related causes but disagreed with some of hardline's finer points found themselves becoming vegan straightedge. Vegan straightedge band [[Earth Crisis]] initially wanted Muttaqi to release their debut EP, ''All Out War'' on his record label, [[Uprising Records]].

As hardline came into its own, many hardliners decided that their philosophy was so beyond the narrow scene politics of straightedge that the two were entirely different things. The "X" was removed from the crossed rifles logo, straightedge was harshly criticized, and hardliners were encouraged to leave the hardcore scene.  Much of this sprang from the momentum being gained by the more activist-oriented elements within the subculture.  Eventually hardliners came to consider their network wholly divorced from the hardcore scene. However, the nature of information dissemination in a mostly pre-Internet media environment made recruiting from outside the hardcore subculture next to impossible.  Although hardline served to involve people heavily in political activity, the overwhelming bulk of new members were straight-edgers who would with time come to identify primarily as activists instead of hardcore kids.

In mid-1998 the subculture experienced a massive internal upheaval as Indianapolis Hardline member David Agranoff's attempts to weaken Hardline were sidelined by Boston Hardline. ''Vanguard'' number eight announced the reorganization of the movement under the authority of the newly created Hardline Central Committee (HCC) and castigated Agranoff and his comrades for softening the network's ideology through their refinement and development of it.  This proved a wise decision as Agranoff later became a police informer. Chapters were instructed to report to the Committee for evaluation and were told in no uncertain terms that they would not be recognized as cells until they submitted to this review.  Also in the issue was a document about the stages through which the Hardline revolution would progress which was presented as being from 1990, but had never before been seen and was suspiciously contemporary feeling.

Some chapters opted to leave hardline entirely and instead established a new activist network called Education For A Sustainable Future (ESF).  ESF differed from its predecessor in that it took no stances.&lt;ref name=Muttaqi/&gt;&lt;ref name=Muttaqi2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Muttaqi3/&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;{{harvnb|Haenfler|2006|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;{{harvnb|Kuhn|2010|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;{{harvnb|Wood|2006|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;{{harvnb|Pike|2011|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Indicative planning''' is a form of [[economic planning]] implemented by a [[State (polity)|state]] in an effort to solve the problem of [[imperfect information]] in market and mixed [[economy|economies]] in order to increase economic performance. However, indicative planning takes only endogenous market uncertainty and plans the economy accordingly and does not look into exogenous uncertainty like technology, foreign trade, etc.   When utilizing indicative planning, the state employs "influence, subsidies, grants, and taxes [to affect the economy], but does not compel".&lt;ref&gt;[[Alec Nove]] (1987), "Planned Economy," ''[[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]]'', v. 3, p. 879.&lt;/ref&gt; Indicative planning is contrasted with ''directive'' or ''mandatory planning'', where a state (or other economic unit) sets quotas and mandatory output requirements. Planning by inducement is often referred to as indicative planning.

==In practice==
Indicative planning is coordinated information that guides the choices of separate state and private entities in a [[market economy]] or [[mixed economy]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3404100580.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
This method of economic planning originated in [[France]] after the [[Second World War]] and was carried out by the [[Commission General du Plan]]. The underlying concept behind indicative planning is the early identification of oversupply, bottlenecks and shortages so that state investment behavior can be modified in a timely fashion to reduce the incidence of market disequilibrium, with the goal being a concerted economy.&lt;ref&gt;https://docs.google.com/gview?a=v&amp;q=cache:UtOoJ6qgy5QJ:www.econ.umn.edu/~hhe/TEACHING/ECON4337/Frencheconomy.pdf+Indicative+Planning&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&lt;/ref&gt; Indicative planning was one aspect of [[dirigisme]].

===People's Republic of China===
Since the 1978 economic reforms in China, the state reduced its role to directing economic activity rather than managing it through directive plans. By the early 21st century, the Chinese government had limited the role of directive mandatory planning to goods of national importance and large-scale construction, while increasing the scope of indicative planning and market forces in all other sectors of the economy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/111803/China/71005/The-role-of-the-government#ref=ref589614&lt;/ref&gt; The current Chinese [[socialist market economy]] is largely based on market forces for consumer goods and indicative planning for heavy industry in the public sector.

===Union of Soviet Socialist Republics===
The [[Soviet Union]] utilized indicative plans for its state-run economy up until 1928, before they were integrated into mandatory planning under the [[Supreme Council of the National Economy]] and later by the [[Gosplan]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3404100580.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexei Kosygin]]'s [[1965 Soviet economic reform]] tried to introduce some sort of indicative planning in the USSR.

===Japan===
The Japanese government practiced indicative planning through the [[Japanese Economic Planning Agency]].

==National economic planning==
The term ''National Economic Planning'' is associated with government's effort to coordinate the working of both the public sector and the private sector through a structured mechanism. Although, during the 20th century, the term was more associated with the communist and eastern economies, through the 1970s, theorists and practitioners documented the growth of this practice amongst western economies too [https://www.nytimes.com/1976/01/25/archives/the-american-plan-national-economic-planning-will-arrive-when.html][https://www.nytimes.com/1975/12/21/archives/points-of-view-national-economic-planning-pro-and-con.html][https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/642597432.html?dids=642597432:642597432&amp;FMT=CITE&amp;FMTS=CITE:AI&amp;date=Jan+25%2C+1976&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=National+Economic+Planning%3A+An+Idea+Whose+Time+Has+Come&amp;pqatl=google][http://www.ucpress.edu/books/op/RILLL3.php]. In the latter part of the 20th century and till date, economists have demanded that underdeveloped and developing countries — especially in continents like Africa — should embrace National Economic Planning to a large extent [http://www.newera.com.na/article.php?articleid=5726][http://news.myjoyonline.com/news/200907/33224.asp]. Famous proponents and practitioners of National Economic Planning have been Nobel Prize–winning Russian politician [[Leonid Kantorovich]], John M Hartwick [https://books.google.com/books?id=kUerTqCKydAC&amp;pg=PA409&amp;lpg=PA409&amp;dq=%22National+Economic+Planning%22+definition&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PQoYG0UKUY&amp;sig=AUao9w3dV73vIp04DbpREbhLRNs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=03R2SpiaFMKGkAWQzeiQDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false], Carl Landauer (who, in 1947, wrote one of the first western books on the subject, titled Theory of National Economic Planning),{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} American Republican politician [[Alf Landon]], the Russian born Canadian politician [[David Lewis (politician)|David Lewis]], Chinese politician [[Zhang Baoshun]] and German sociologist [[Adolph Lowe]].

The '''Invisible Party''' (''Osynliga partiet'') was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[conceptualism|conceptual]] [[anti-capitalist]] media campaign masquerading as an "organization" with the purpose of connecting all anti-capitalist action, however small or without actual realization, to an "invisible" [[political party]].

Although it called itself a party, it did not have official members but instead had ''participants''. It could not, and did not wish to, participate in elections. The professed goal of the group was to undermine the [[Capitalism|capitalist system]]. It was founded by different parts of the Swedish extra-parliamentary left, in particular the [[Swedish Anarcho-syndicalist Youth Federation]].

The Invisible Party "disbanded" after a September 16, 2006 press release by the "central committee" behind the campaign declaring that they would discontinue their activities:
{{quote|''This chapter of history that we have told over the last six months is now over. We chose to illustrate the possibilities of the invisible class spirit through a campaign where we showed different aspects of the struggle that goes on in the shadows. All actions performed during the campaign followed their own logic, had their own purposes and their own meaning without the words that describes them. All we did was talk about that which was previously invisible, and now it will become invisible yet again.'' &lt;small&gt;statement from the Invisible Party central committee, September 16, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osynligapartiet.se Invisible party website]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303210835/http://www.osynligapartiet.se/ |date=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt;}}

==Ideology==
[[Image:Osynligapartiet demonstration.jpg|thumb|250px|An Invisible Party banner at a demonstration in [[Stockholm]], June 3, 2006 organized by the [[Pirate Party (Sweden)|Pirate Party]] amongst others. The banner reads: "Everything for everyone. Online &amp; [[Real life|IRL]]".]]
The Invisible Party can be seen as a shared [[concept]], a symbol for a struggle against capitalism and the perceived exploitation of the workforce. Participation in the party has involved [[Strike action|strikes]], [[blockade]]s, [[flyposting]], [[sabotage]], [[shoplifting]], [[riot]]s, and other radical tactics.

Anna-Lena Lodenius, a Swedish author on political extremism, has described the Invisible Party as follows:
{{quote|It's about groups who see themselves as some kind of elite, a moral elite who goes in front and changes the reality. Then all we others are going to understand that it was all for our best. They don't respect the democracy and the representative democratic system.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sr.se/ekot/artikel.asp?artikel=870263 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-06-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060618091541/http://www.sr.se/ekot/artikel.asp?artikel=870263 |archivedate=2006-06-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[left wing politics|leftist]] website Motkraft described the views of the group as follows:
{{quote|''We have already made our choices! At workplaces, at school, and amongst unemployed the class struggle is ever present, invisible and faceless. These struggles are the Invisible Party. Every time you refuse to obey your boss, or cheat on an exam, or screw that job application-course, you're not alone. You're part of the Invisible Party, the actual movement that undermines capitalism.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.motkraft.net/index.php?view=tema&amp;tema=36 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-05-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614194921/http://motkraft.net/index.php?view=tema&amp;tema=36 |archivedate=2006-06-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Methods==
After the [[Centre Party (Sweden)|Centre Party]] proposed a special youth contract for those under 26 (similar to [[France]]'s [[First Employment Contract]] policy), activists claiming to be members of the Invisible Party responded by vandalizing Centre Party offices throughout Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sr.se/ekot/arkiv.asp?DagensDatum%3D2006-04-12%26Artikel%3D835940 |accessdate=May 3, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311015425/http://www.sr.se/ekot/arkiv.asp?DagensDatum=2006-04-12&amp;Artikel=835940 |archivedate=March 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre Party was in opposition at the time.

Activists under the banner of the Invisible Party continued the vandalism throughout the 2006 Swedish general election campaign, hitting the offices of the [[Christian Democrats (Sweden)|Christian Democrats]], another opposition party, as well.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.city.se/TT/TT.asp?Id=45856{{Dead link|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2006, the [[Swedish Security Service]] (Säpo) was gathering information about the Invisible Party and its supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Säpo granskar 'det osynliga partiet{{'-}} |date=13 April 2006 |first=Erik |last=Ridderstolpe |url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=83&amp;artikel=837703 |newspaper=[[Sveriges Radio]] |accessdate=17 July 2010 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
The Invisible Party was widely misunderstood outside the extra-parliamentary left.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Media presented the party as an actual organization with members in the strict and traditional sense. Because of the actions against the Centre Party the party was vilified by Swedish media and presented as a violent and anti-democratic organization. This led to the true purpose of the campaign becoming even more obscure than before. The winner of the Swedish political reality show ''Toppkandidaterna'' (The Top Candidates), Petter Nilsson, donated 100,000 of his 250,000 [[Swedish krona|SEK]] prize-money to the project. After the actions against the Centre Party, the party demanded that the license-funded public broadcaster [[Sveriges Television|SVT]] should ask Nilsson to repay the money, and the [[Centre Party Youth]] claimed that SVT was "responsible for the attacks",&lt;ref&gt;{{sv icon}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20061017034017/http://www.gp.se/gp/jsp/Crosslink.jsp?d=114&amp;a=271586 ''gp.se'': Centerförbund: SVT ansvarigt för skadegörelsen mot våra lokaler]&lt;/ref&gt; but SVT chose not to take any action against Nilsson.&lt;ref&gt;{{sv icon}} [http://www.sr.se/cgi-bin/ekot/artikel.asp?Artikel=836838 ''sr.se'': Prispengar från SVT stöder protest mot c] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930232030/http://www.sr.se/cgi-bin/ekot/artikel.asp?Artikel=836838 |date=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="62551">'''Medicare''' ({{lang-fr|assurance-maladie}}) is an unofficial designation used to refer to the [[publicly funded health care|publicly funded]], [[single-payer]] [[Healthcare in Canada|health care system]] of [[Canada]]. Canada does not have a unified national health care system, instead the system consists of 13 provincial and territorial health insurance plans that provides [[universal health care]] coverage to [[Canadian citizen]]s, [[Permanent residency in Canada|permanent resident]]s, and certain temporary residents. These systems are individually administered on a provincial or territorial basis, within guidelines set by the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canada's health care system|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/canada-health-care-system.html|website=Canada.ca|publisher=Health Canada|accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The formal terminology for the insurance system is provided by the ''[[Canada Health Act]]'' and the [[health insurance]] legislation of the individual [[provinces and territories of Canada|provinces and territories]].

The name is a contraction of ''medical'' and ''care'', and was used in the United States for health care programs since at least 1953.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, s.v. "Medicare".&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the terms of the Canada Health Act, all "insured persons" are entitled to receive "insured services" without [[copayment]]. Such services are defined as medically necessary services if provided in hospital, or by 'practitioners' (usually physicians).&lt;ref name="Canada Health Act Overview"&gt;{{cite web|title=Canada Health Act|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/health-care-system/canada-health-care-system-medicare/canada-health-act.html|website=Canada.ca|publisher=Health Canada|accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 70% of expenditures for [[health care in Canada]] come from public sources, with the rest paid privately (both through private insurance, and through out-of-pocket payments). The extent of public financing varies considerably across services. For example, approximately 99% of physician services, and 90% of hospital care, are paid by publicly funded sources, whereas almost all dental care is paid for privately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Canadian Institute for Health Information | date=September 27, 2005 | title=CIHI exploring the 70–30 split | publisher= | url=http://www.cihi.ca/cihiweb/dispPage.jsp?cw_page=AR_1282_E | accessdate=2007-12-21 | postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Services of non-physicians working within hospitals are covered; conversely, provinces can, but are not forced to, cover services by non-physicians if provided outside hospitals. Changing the site of treatment may thus change coverage. For example, pharmaceuticals, nursing care, and physical therapy must be covered for inpatients, but there is considerable variation from province to province in the extent to which they are covered for patients discharged to the community (e.g., after day surgery). The need to modernize coverage was pointed out in 2002 by both the [[Royal Commission on the Future of Health Care in Canada|Romanow Commission]] and by the [[Michael J. L. Kirby|Kirby]] committee of the Canadian Senate (see External links below). Similarly, the extent to which non-physician providers of primary care are funded varies; [[Quebec]] offers primary health care teams through its [[CLSC]] system.

==History==
{{Main|Health care in Canada#The beginning of coverage|l1= Health Care in Canada – the beginning of coverage}}

The first implementation of public hospital care in Canada came at the provincial level in Saskatchewan in 1947 and in Alberta in 1950, under provincial governments led by the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] and the [[Social Credit Party of Canada|Social Credit party]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Quinlan|first=Don|title=The Canadian Challenge|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Canada|isbn=978-0-19-542647-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first implementation of nationalized public health care – at the federal level – came about with the [[Hospital Insurance and Diagnostic Services Act]] (HIDS), which was passed by the Liberal majority government of [[Louis St. Laurent]] in 1957,&lt;ref name="Turner"&gt;{{Cite web
| last = J. Gilbert Turner
| title = The Hospital Insurance and Diagnostic Services Act: Its Impact on Hospital Administration
 | pmc = 1829926
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was adopted by all provinces by 1961. [[Lester B. Pearson]]'s government subsequently expanded this policy to universal health care with the Medical Care Act in 1966.&lt;ref name="Forman2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lillian E. Forman|title=Health Care Reform|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=igthi21RZVgC&amp;pg=PA2002|accessdate=6 June 2011|date=January 2009|publisher=ABDO|isbn=978-1-60453-532-7|page=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some{{who|date=March 2014}} have argued {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} that these developments towards public national health care came as a result of the adoption of a publicly funded health plan in 1961-1962 in Saskatchewan government. The fight for a publicly funded system was originally led by Premier [[Tommy Douglas]] and implemented by [[Woodrow Stanley Lloyd]], who became premier of the province when Douglas resigned to become the leader of the new federal [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]]. Although Saskatchewan is often credited with the birth of public health care funding in Canada, the federal legislation itself was actually drafted (and first proposed to parliament) by [[Allan MacEachen]], a Liberal MP from Cape Breton.&lt;ref name="Allan MacEachen"&gt;{{Cite web
| title = Civilization.ca – History of Canadian Medicare – 1958–1968 – Allan J. MacEachen
| accessdate = 2012-04-19
| url = http://www.civilization.ca/cmc/exhibitions/hist/medicare/medic-5k05e.shtml
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, the Canada Health Act was passed, amalgamating the 1966 Medical Care Act and the 1957 Hospital Insurance and Diagnostic Services Act. The Canada Health Act affirmed and clarified five founding principles: (a) ''public administration'' on a non-profit basis by a public authority; (b) ''comprehensiveness'' – provincial health plans must insure all services that are medically necessary; (c) ''universality'' – a guarantee that all residents in Canada must have access to public healthcare and insured services on uniform terms and conditions; (d) ''portability'' – residents must be covered while temporarily absent from their province of residence or from Canada; and (e) ''accessibility'' – insured persons must have reasonable and uniform access to insured health services, free of financial or other barriers. These five conditions prevent provinces from radical innovation, but many small differences do exist between the provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Benefits Canada|url=http://www.benefitscanada.com/benefits/health-wellness/the-canada-health-act-then-now-and-in-2014-26218|accessdate=May 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eligibility==
Although in theory all Canadians should qualify for coverage, each province or territory operates its own health insurance program, and provinces and territories have enacted qualification rules which effectively exclude many Canadians from coverage. For example, to qualify for enrollment in Ontario, one must, among other requirements, "be physically present in Ontario for 153 days in any 12-month period; and be physically present in Ontario for at least 153 days of the first 183 days immediately after establishing residency in the province."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Ministry of Health |author2=Long-Term Care | date=2011-11-28 | title=Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) – Eligibility | publisher=Queen's Printer for Ontario | url=http://health.gov.on.ca/en/public/programs/ohip/ | accessdate=2012-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While there are exceptions for students studying out of province, and for mobile workers, many Canadians who regularly travel from one province to another for other reasons, as well as those who often travel outside Canada, cannot qualify for enrollment in any province. Proof-of-residency provisions requiring presentation of documents such as utility bills and bank statements also operate to establish eligibility.

==Funding==
According to Canada's constitution, the provinces have responsibility for health care, education and welfare. However, the federal Canada Health Act sets standards for all the provinces. The [[Canada Health Act]] requires coverage for all medically necessary care provided in hospitals or by physicians; this explicitly includes diagnostic, treatment and preventive services. Coverage is universal for qualifying Canadian residents, regardless of income level.

Funding for the health care is transferred from the general revenues of the Canadian federal government to the 10 provinces and 3 territories through the [[Canada Health Transfer]]. Some provinces also charge annual health care premiums. These are, in effect, taxes (since they are not tied to service use, nor to provincial health expenditures). The system is accordingly classified by the [[OECD]] as a tax-supported system, as opposed to the social insurance approaches used in many European countries. Boards in each province regulate the cost, which is then reimbursed by the federal government.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Patients do not pay out of pocket costs to visit their doctor, at present.

==Delivery==
Canada uses a mix of public and private organizations to deliver health care in what is termed a publicly funded, privately delivered system. Hospitals and acute care facilities, including long term complex care, are typically directly funded. Health care organizations bill the provincial health authorities, with few exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Raisa Deber | date=August 2002 | title=Delivering Health Care Services: Public, Not-For-Profit or Private | publisher= | url=http://teamgrant.ca/M-THAC%20Greatest%20Hits/Bonus%20Tracks/Delivering%20Health%20Care%20Services.pdf | format=PDF | accessdate=2008-08-07 | postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt; | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706204324/http://www.teamgrant.ca/M-THAC%20Greatest%20Hits/Bonus%20Tracks/Delivering%20Health%20Care%20Services.pdf | archivedate=2011-07-06 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hospitals are largely non-profit organizations, historically often linked to religious or charitable organizations. In some provinces, individual hospital boards have been eliminated and combined into quasi-private [[Health regions of Canada|regional health authorities]], subject to varying degrees of provincial control.

Private services are provided by diagnostic laboratories, occupational and physical therapy centres, and other allied professionals. Non-medically necessary services, such as optional plastic surgery, are also often delivered by for-profit investor-owned corporations. In some cases patients pay directly and are reimbursed by the health care system, and in other cases a hospital or physician may order services and seek reimbursement from the provincial government.

With rare exceptions, medical doctors are small for-profit independent businesses. Historically, they have practised in small solo or group practices and billed the government Canadian Health Care system on a [[fee for service]] basis. Unlike the practice in fully socialized countries, hospital-based physicians are not all hospital employees, and some directly bill the provincial insurance plans on a fee-for-service basis. Since 2000, physicians have been allowed to incorporate for tax reasons (dates of authorization vary province to province).

Efforts to achieve ''primary health care reform'' have increasingly encouraged physicians to work in multidisciplinary teams, and be paid through blended funding models, including elements of capitation and other 'alternative funding formulas'. Similarly, some hospitals (particularly [[teaching hospital]]s and rural/remote hospitals) have also experimented with alternatives to fee-for-service.

In summary, the system is known as a "public system" due to its public financing, but is not a nationalized system such as the UK's [[National Health Service|NHS]]: most health care services are provided privately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/healthcare/public_vs_private.html |title=CBC Health Care Private versus Public |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=2006-12-01 |accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An additional complexity is that, because health care is deemed to be under provincial jurisdiction, there is not a "Canadian health care system". Most providers are private, and may or may not coordinate their care. Publicly funded insurance is organized at the level of the province/territory; each manages its own insurance system, including issuing its own healthcare identification cards (a list of the provincial medical care insurance programs is given at the end of this entry). Once care moves beyond the services required by the Canada Health Act—for which universal comprehensive coverage applies—there is inconsistency from province to province in the extent of publicly funded coverage, particularly for such items as outpatient drug coverage and rehabilitation, as well as vision care, mental health, and long-term care, with a substantial portion of such services being paid for privately, either through private insurance, or out-of-pocket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pharmacists.ca/content/cpjpdfs/sept04/Commentary-Sept04.pdf |title=Neil MacKinnon.

===Drug coverage===
Unlike a number of other countries with universal health insurance systems, Canada lacks a universal pharmaceutical subsidy scheme, with co-payment, cost ceilings, and special subsidy groups varying by private insurer and by province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 4401594 | pmid=25780047 | doi=10.1503/cmaj.141564 | volume=187 | issue=7 | title=Estimated cost of universal public coverage of prescription drugs in Canada | year=2015 | journal=CMAJ | pages=491–7 |vauthors=Morgan SG, Law M, Daw JR, Abraham L, Martin D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/17685108/From_the_city_to_the_bush_increases_in_patient_co-payments_for_medicines_have_impacted_on_medicine_use_across_Australia|title=From the city to the bush: increases in patient co-payments for medicines have impacted on medicine use across Australia|first1=Kemp,|last1=Anna|first2=Glover,|last2=John|first3=Preen, David|last3=B.|first4=Bulsara,|last4=Max|first5=Semmens,|last5=James|first6=Roughead, Elizabeth|last6=E.|publisher=|volume=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each province may provide its own prescription drug benefit plan, although the Canada Health Act requires only coverage for pharmaceuticals delivered to hospital inpatients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drugcoverage.ca/default.asp |title=Prescription Drug Coverage in Canada |publisher=Drugcoverage.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110621032832/http://www.drugcoverage.ca/default.asp |archivedate=2011-06-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Provincial prescription drug benefit plans differ across provinces. Some provinces cover only those in particular age groups (usually, seniors) and/or those on social assistance. Others are more universal. Quebec achieves universal coverage through a combination of private and public plans. Co-payments also vary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/21/40/37868186.pdf |title=Valérie Paris and Elizabeth Docteur. Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement Policies in Canada. OECD Health Working Papers 24, 2006. |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Provinces maintain their own provincial formularies, although the [[Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health|Common Drug Review]] provides evidence-based formulary listing recommendations to the provincial ministries. Note that there is ongoing controversy in Canada, as in other countries, about inclusion of expensive drugs and discrepancies in their availability, as well as in what if any provisions are made for allowing medications not yet approved to be administered under "exceptional drug" provisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drugcoverage.ca/p_rejected_claims.asp?language=1 |title=on rejected claims |publisher=Drugcoverage.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514101531/http://www.drugcoverage.ca/p_rejected_claims.asp?language=1 |archivedate=2011-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Drug costs are contentious. Their prices are controlled by the [[Patented Medicine Prices Review Board]] (PMPRB).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pmprb-cepmb.gc.ca/english/home.asp?x=1 |title=PMPRB Home page. Accessed Dec 26, 2007 |publisher=Pmprb-cepmb.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PMPRB's pricing formula ensures that Canada pays prices based on the average of those charged to selected countries; they are neither the highest, nor the lowest.

===Dental care, eye care, and other services===
[[Dentistry|Dental care]] is not required to be covered by the government insurance plans. In Quebec, children under the age of 10 receive almost full coverage, and many oral surgeries are covered for everyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ramq.gouv.qc.ca/en/citoyens/assurancemaladie/serv_couv_queb/serv_dent_sc.shtml#tous |title=RAMQ – Health Insurance – Dental Services - Services Covered |publisher=Ramq.gouv.qc.ca |date=2011-04-14 |accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canadians rely on their employers or individual private insurance, pay cash themselves for dental treatments, or receive no care. In some jurisdictions, public health units have been involved in providing targeted programs to address the need of the young, the elderly or those who are on welfare. The Canadian Association of Public Health Dentistry tracks programs, and has been advocating for extending coverage to those currently unable to receive dental care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.caphd-acsdp.org/Welcome.htm |title=Canadian Association of Public Health Dentistry home page |publisher=Caphd-acsdp.org |date= |accessdate=2011-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126045927/http://www.caphd-acsdp.org/Welcome.htm |archivedate=2010-01-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The range of services for vision care coverage also varies widely among the provinces. Generally, "medically required" vision care is covered if provided by physicians (cataract surgery, diabetic vision care, some laser eye surgeries required as a result of disease, but not if the purpose is to replace the need for eyeglasses). Similarly, the standard vision test may or may not be covered. Some provinces allow a limited number of tests (e.g., no more than once within a two-year period). Others, including Ontario, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and British Columbia, do not, although different provisions may apply to particular sub-groups (e.g., diabetics, children).

Naturopathic services are covered in some cases, but homeopathic services are generally not covered. Chiropractic is partially covered in some provinces. Cosmetic procedures are not typically covered. Psychiatric services (provided by physicians) are covered, fee-for-service psychology services outside of hospitals or community based mental health clinics are usually not. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, nursing, and chiropractic services are often not covered unless within hospitals. Some provinces, including Ontario include some rehabilitation services for those in the home care program, those recently discharged from hospitals (e.g., after a hip replacement), or those in particular age categories. Again, considerable variation exists, and provinces can (and do) alter their coverage decisions.

==Inter-provincial Imbalances==
The fact that health insurance plans are administered by the provinces and territories in a country where large numbers of residents of certain provinces work in other provinces may lead to inequitable inter-provincial outcomes with respect to revenues and expenditures. For example, many residents of the Atlantic provinces work in the oil and gas industry in the western province of Alberta. For most of the year these workers may be contributing significant tax revenue to Alberta (e.g. through fuel, tobacco and alcohol taxes) while their health insurance costs are borne by their home province in Atlantic Canada.

Another considerable inter-provincial imbalance is a person who is insured by Quebec and obtains healthcare in another province or territory. Quebec does not have any physician payment agreements with any other provinces or territories of Canada. As a result, someone that sees a physician outside Quebec, even in another part of Canada, must either pay the cost themselves and submit a request to the [[Régie de l'Assurance Maladie du Québec]] (RAMQ Medicare) for reimbursement (even then, expenses are often denied), or take out a third party insurance plan. The same situation also applies to a resident of any other part of Canada visiting Quebec, only they submit any claims to their respective provincial healthplan. All provinces and territories of Canada, however, do have reciprocal hospital agreements, so hospital admissions, for example, are covered throughout Canada.&lt;ref name="AHCIP"&gt;{{Cite web

==Opinions on Canadian Health Care==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2007}}
Polling data in the last few years have consistently cited Canadian Health Care as among the most important political issues in the minds of Canadian voters. Along with [[peacekeeping]], Canadian Health Care was found, based on a [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] poll, to be among the foremost defining characteristics of Canada. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/maple-leaf-best-defines-canada-survey-finds-1.722322|title=Maple leaf best defines Canada, survey finds|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has increasingly become a source of controversy in Canadian politics. As a recent report from the Health Council of Canada has noted
"Herein lies one of the puzzles of Canadian health care: Canadians increasingly view the health care system as unsustainable and under threat, even as their own experiences with the system are mostly positive."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthcouncilcanada.ca/docs/rpts/2007/Public%20Perceptions%20-%20English%20Final_Feb-07.pdf Stuart N. Soroka. Canadian Perceptions of the Health Care System. 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706182550/http://www.healthcouncilcanada.ca/docs/rpts/2007/Public%20Perceptions%20-%20English%20Final_Feb-07.pdf |date=2011-07-06 }}. {{ISBN|0-9739726-8-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As analysts have noted, the root of the concern may be traced to successful cost control efforts in the mid 1990s, where public health expenditure per capita, in inflation-adjusted dollars, actually fell.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080214090847/http://secure.cihi.ca/cihiweb/dispPage.jsp?cw_page=PG_876_E&amp;cw_topic=876&amp;cw_rel=AR_31_E CIHI National Health Expenditures in Canada 1975–2007]&lt;/ref&gt; These efforts arose from efforts by the federal government to deal with its deficit through various austerity measures, which led to cuts in their transfers to the provinces, and in turn to squeezing hospital budgets and physician reimbursements. The number of physicians being trained was reduced. The result was seen in increased wait times, particularly for elective procedures. More recently, government has been reinvesting in health care, but public confidence has been slow to recover.

A number of studies have compared Canada with other countries, and concluded that each system has its own strengths and weaknesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/publications_show.htm?doc_id=568237 |title=Schoen et al., Toward Higher-Performance Health Systems: Adults' Health Care Experiences in Seven Countries, 2007 |publisher=Commonwealthfund.org |date=2007-11-01 |accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/46/33/38979719.pdf |title=OECD Health Data 2007.

However, the basis for these rankings has been highly contentious. As Deber noted, "The measure of "overall healthsystem performance" derives from adjusting "goal attainment" for educational attainment. Although goal attainment is in theory based on five measures (level and distribution of health, level and distribution of "responsiveness" and "fairness of financial contribution"), the actual values assigned to most countries, including Canada, were never directly measured. The scores do not incorporate any information about the actual workings of the system, other than as reflected in life expectancy. The primary reason for Canada's relatively low standing rests on the relatively high educational level of its population, particularly as compared to France, rather than on any features of its health system."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://longwoods.com/product.php?productid=17238&amp;cat=367&amp;page=1 |title=R.

Longwoods Review 2(1) 2004 |publisher=Longwoods.com |date=2003-06-20 |accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other countries had similar complaints, and the WHO has not repeated this ranking.

==2003 Accord==
In 2003, the prime minister and the provincial premiers agreed upon priority areas for reinvestment. The 2003 First Ministers’ Accord on Health Care Renewal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/delivery-prestation/fptcollab/2003accord/index_e.html |title=Home page on the accord |publisher=Hc-sc.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602045037/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/delivery-prestation/fptcollab/2003accord/index_e.html |archivedate=2008-06-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; reaffirmed their commitment to the principles of the Canada Health Act. They indicated the following principles:

"Drawing from this foundation, First Ministers view this Accord as a covenant which will help to ensure that:
* all Canadians have timely access to health services on the basis of need, not ability to pay, regardless of where they live or move in Canada;
* the health care services available to Canadians are of high quality, effective, patient-centred and safe; and
* our health care system is sustainable and affordable and will be here for Canadians and their children in the future."

The accord set the following priority areas: primary health care, home care, catastrophic drug coverage, access to diagnostic/medical equipment and information technology and an [[electronic health record]]. The extent of progress in meeting reform goals has varied across these areas.

==Evaluating claims about the system==
Evaluating the accuracy of claims about the system is hampered by several factors. The highly decentralized nature of health care delivery means that good data is not always available. It is often difficult to distinguish compelling but atypical anecdotes from systemic problems. Considerable effort is being made to develop and implement comparable indicators to allow better assessment of progress. However, the Health Council of Canada—with a mandate to monitor and report on health reform—complained in 2007 that progress has stalled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.healthcouncilcanada.ca/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=136&amp;Itemid=115 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216143147/http://www.healthcouncilcanada.ca/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=136&amp;Itemid=115 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-02-16 |title=Health Council of Canada. Health Care Renewal in Canada: Measuring UP? 2007 |publisher=Healthcouncilcanada.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-06-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate about health care has also become heavily ideological. The [[Fraser Institute]], a right leaning think tank supporting "competitive market solutions for public policy problems" is a frequent critic of publicly funded Canadian Health Care. It publishes yearly reports about wait times which are then used to argue that the system is both failing and unsustainable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fraserinstitute.org/commerce.web/newsrelease.aspx?nID=4967 |title=Fraser Institute press release, October 2007 |publisher=Fraserinstitute.org |date= |accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others criticize their methodology, which is based on physician perceptions rather than actual waits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chsrf.ca/mythbusters/pdf/myth17_e.pdf |title=CHSRF Mythbusters: A parallel private system would relieve waiting times in the public system. 2005 |publisher=Chsrf.ca |date=2010-12-13 |accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other complaints come from the political left, who object to 'privatization' (by which they usually mean a heavier involvement of for-profit providers). (See, for example, the Canadian Health Coalition web page.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthcoalition.ca/ |title=Canadian Health Coalition. Home Page. Accessed Dec 26, 2007 |publisher=Healthcoalition.ca |date=2011-05-24 |accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are frequent debates in the media and on line between advocates and opponents of Canadian healthcare.

===Wait times and access===
Common complaints relate to access, usually to elective surgery (especially hip and knee replacement and cataract surgery) and diagnostic imaging. These have been the primary targets of health care reinvestment, and it appears that considerable progress has been made for certain services, although the implications for procedures not on the target list are unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://healthcouncilcanada.ca/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=202&amp;Itemid=10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070727021417/http://healthcouncilcanada.ca/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=202&amp;Itemid=10 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-07-27 |title=Health Council of Canada.

Barua and Esmail completed a study in October 2013, Waiting Your Turn, Wait Times for Health Care in Canada. The authors surveyed both private and publicly funded outpatient health care offices and found the amount of wait time between general practitioner and specialists. The second segment was determining wait times between consultation and time of procedure. They studied each province and found where the longest and shortest wait times were. Barua and Esmail found that the wait times for health services have increased 95% from 1993-2013. Esmail and Barua also compared the wait times in 2012 to the wait times in 2013. A few provinces wait times decreased but mostly provinces wait times increased slightly. The number of procedures overall that people in 2013 waited for was 928,120. This is a 6.6% increase from 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Barua, B., &amp; Esmail, N. (October, 2013). Waiting Times Wait Times for Health Care in Canada. Fraser Institute . Retrieved October 21, 2014, from http://www.fraserinstitute.org/uploadedFiles/fraser-ca/Content/research-news/research/publications/waiting-your-turn-2013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health human resources===
A related issue is the volume, and distribution, of health human resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cihi.ca/cihiweb/dispPage.jsp?cw_page=AR_35_E|title=CIHI Canada's Health Care Providers accessed Dec 26, 2007|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822183918/http://www.cihi.ca/cihiweb/dispPage.jsp?cw_page=AR_35_E|archivedate=2007-08-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are ongoing issues about the distribution of physicians, with the pendulum swinging from arguing that there were too many, to arguing that there were too few. As Ben Chan found, the major factor driving the drop in physician numbers was changes in training programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cihi.ca/cihiweb/dispPage.jsp?cw_page=media_05jun2002_e|title=CIHI report, From Perceived Surplus to Perceived Shortage: What Happened to Canada’s Physician Workforce in the 1990s? 2002|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021116091216/http://www.cihi.ca/cihiweb/dispPage.jsp?cw_page=media_05jun2002_e|archivedate=2002-11-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combined with such factors as changes in the hours worked by each physician, and a decrease in the proportion of doctors choosing to go into family practice, there were shortages in some areas, particularly for general practitioners (GP) / family doctors. One response has been to encourage 'primary care reform', including greater use of multidisciplinary health care teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/prim/index_e.html |title=Health Canada Primary Health Care home page, accessed Dec 26, 2007 |publisher=Hc-sc.gc.ca |date=2004-10-01 |accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also ongoing issues regarding nurses. (See Nursing Health Services Research Unit, which links to some reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhsru.com/ |title=NHRSU home page. Accessed Dec 26, 2007 |publisher=Nhsru.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; CIHI also gives data about nursing.)

===Delisting===
Delisting is the term used in [[Canada]] when a province decides that a medical procedure will no longer be covered by the health care system in that [[province]].

While health care coverage is country wide, and is required to be portable and to have equal access, there are a few differences between what provinces will cover. In some cases, this has resulted in lost [[Grant (money)|grants]] to the provinces; in other cases it has not.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

An example of a delisted service is [[circumcision]] in [[Ontario]]. It is still possible to have a boy circumcised in Ontario by a [[physician|doctor]] but the parents must pay the cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health-and-fitness/ask-a-health-expert/circumcision-5-facts-and-3-misconceptions-to-consider-before-you-do-it/article9461671/|title=Circumcision: 5 facts and 3 misconceptions to consider before you do it|work=The Globe and Mail|access-date=2017-05-06|language=en-ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of delisting services is becoming increasingly a political battleground in Canadian health care. In an effort to save health care money some provinces are delisting some services; however, some delisted services are ones that could be considered "medically necessary". For example, except for seniors, children, and diabetics eye exams to check vision are no longer covered in Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.gov.on.ca/english/public/pub/ohip/services.html|title= Ontario Ministry of Health and Long Term Care – Public Information – Ontario Health Insurance Plan - Health Services|accessdate=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parallel private debate==
Some politicians and [[think tank]]s have proposed removing barriers to the existence of a parallel private healthcare system. Others note that such systems act to erode cost control and impede equity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.longwoods.com/product.php?productid=19340&amp;cat=515&amp;page=1 |title=I. Dhalla. Private Health Insurance: An International Overview and Considerations for Canada. Longwoods Review vol 5(3) 2007 |publisher=Longwoods.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Though polling suggests support for such reforms has been increasing, it has yet to be adopted as official policy by any of the main federal political parties.

Under federal law, private clinics are not legally allowed to charge patients directly for services covered by the Canada Health Act, if they qualify for the public insurance. Regardless of this legal issue, many do offer such services. There are disputes as to whether surgical procedures can be performed. Two related issues have obstructed the growth of such clinics. One is regulatory&amp;nbsp;— hospital-based quality assurance often failed to encompass them. This gap has been filled in most provinces, but sometimes only after celebrated incidents in which patients died in unregulated clinics, including one physician who performed cosmetic surgery in an Ontario hotel room. The second is economic&amp;nbsp;— there may be no way for physicians to recoup the additional costs of running a surgical facility from their fees. Here, provinces can choose to offer 'facility fees' to these clinics, but doing so has often been contentious, particularly if hospitals felt that these costs would be better devoted to allowing them to increase their operating room time.

Note that uninsured persons can pay for care (including [[medical tourism]]), and that insured persons can still pay for uninsured services. These are both niche markets.

Opponents of Canadian health care often raise issues such as long wait times, a '[[brain-drain]]' drawing qualified professionals away from Canada to other jurisdictions where working in the health care field is more profitable, and impairment of the Canadian health care system due to budget cuts.  Fox News ran a story in 2007 reporting that during a period of above average numbers of births, at least 40 Canadian mothers of premature babies had to travel to the U.S. for treatment due to insufficient capacity for premature babies in British Columbia neonatal units.  Nonetheless, Canada's health care system covered the health care costs of those mothers affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,300939,00.html | work=Fox News | title=Canada's Expectant Moms Heading to U.S. to Deliver | date=2007-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the Government in Canada spent $2,998 USD per capita on healthcare as compared to $5,711 USD per capita in the United States, while almost every Canadian citizen is fully covered.&lt;ref&gt;Health Care Spending in the United States and OECD Countries, January 2007 {{cite web |url=http://www.kff.org/insurance/snapshot/chcm010307oth.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081103090227/http://www.kff.org/insurance/snapshot/chcm010307oth.cfm |archivedate=2008-11-03 |df= }} Retrieved October 19th, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, 11.9% of adults lack public or private health coverage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2015/04/13/news/economy/obamacare-uninsured-gallup/ |title=Nearly 90% of Americans now have health insurance - Apr. 13, 2015 |date=15 March 2016 |publisher= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315000410/http://money.cnn.com/2015/04/13/news/economy/obamacare-uninsured-gallup/ |archivedate=15 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; despite higher proportional spending along with large private investment.

The lack of competition has given healthcare unions a monopoly on essential services, thus ensuring a very strong bargaining position. Nova Scotia is currently debating healthcare legislation aimed at removing the threat of striking healthcare workers and replacing it with binding arbitration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed reforms==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
One proposed solution for improving the Canadian healthcare system is to increase funding. Proponents of this approach point to{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} the rise of [[Neoconservatism|neo-conservative]] economic policies in Canada and the associated reduction in [[welfare state]] expenditure (particularly in the provinces) from the 1980s onwards as the cause of degradation in the system. While some say evidence clearly indicate an overall percentage increase on healthcare spending, the net spending has been drastically decreasing on top of inflation.

Other critics of healthcare state{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} that increased funding will not solve systemic problems in the healthcare system including a rising cost of medical technology, infrastructure, and wages. These critics say{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} that Canada's proximity to the United States causes a "[[brain drain]]" or migration of Canadian-trained doctors and nurses (as well as other professionals) to the United States, where private hospitals can pay much higher wages and income tax rates are lower (partially because health care is not covered through taxation). Some of these critics{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} argue that increased privatization of healthcare would improve Canada's health infrastructure. Others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1503/cmaj.081177|pmid=18838441|pmc=2565716|title=Privatizing health care is not the answer: Lessons from the United States|journal=CMAJ|volume=179|issue=9|pages=916–9|year=2008|last1=Angell|first1=M}}&lt;/ref&gt; argue vehemently against it. For example, large resources are required to train and educate doctors. Since the number of available doctors is therefore limited, doctors working for a private system would not be working under the public system creating little to no net increase in available services.

Critics of greater privatization state{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} that healthcare should be kept public, (public in funding only, as most services are provided by the private sector including doctors who in most cases are private corporations) in part because it separates Canadians from Americans by mandating equality and fairness in health care. This is in contrast to other states{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} where doctors are on a per capita based salary. In this sense the Canadian Healthcare system is merely a publicly funded one where services are provided by a mixture of public and private entities, which most Canadians appreciate and desire.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} Changing the system to eliminate the balance between public and private service providers to a completely public system is one such alternative.

==Ontario's reform experiments==
Since the early 1990s, Ontario has implemented several systematic reforms to reduce health care costs. Similar reforms have been implemented in other provinces.

===User premiums===
Currently in Ontario, people with an annual taxable income above $20,000 must pay an annual health care premium ranging from $60–$900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rev.gov.on.ca/en/tax/healthpremium/rates.html |title=Ontario Health Premium Rate Chart |publisher=Ontario Ministry Of Finance |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funding for health care in Ontario also comes in part from a dedicated Employer Health Tax (EHT) that ranges from 0.98%-1.95% of employer payroll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rev.gov.on.ca/en/tax/eht/ |title=Employer Health Tax |publisher=Ontario Ministry Of Finance |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eligible employers are exempted from EHT on the first $400,000 of payroll.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} British Columbia and Quebec charge similar premiums.

===Medical clinics===
Ontario has increased the number of 24-hour drop-in medical clinic networks{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} to reduce costs associated with treating off-hours emergencies in hospital emergency rooms.

Many family doctor practices have created their own clinics, offering 24-hour service for their patients if needed. Each doctor in the practice takes a turn at being "on call" on a rotating basis. Patients who have family doctors belonging to these practices are able to have a doctor come to their home in extreme situations. There is no additional charge for these services as they are billed to the Province, the same as an office visit.

Hospitals in some major Canadian cities, such as London, Ontario, have restructured their emergency services to share emergency treatment among several hospitals.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} One hospital may provide full emergency room care, while another sees patients who have broken limbs, minor injuries and yet another sees patients suffering cold, flu, etc.

In 2007, the first nurse practitioner-led office to relieve waiting times caused by a shortage of primary practitioners was opened in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury, Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=First Nurse Practitioner-Led Clinic Opens Doors in Sudbury | date=2007-08-31 | publisher=CNW Group | url =http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/August2007/30/c3886.html | work =REGISTERED NURSES' ASSOCIATION OF ONTARIO | pages = | accessdate = 2007-09-02 | language =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=1st nurse practitioner-governed clinic opens in Sudbury | date=2007-08-31 | publisher=CBC | url =http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2007/08/31/nurse-clinic.html | work =CBC News | pages = | accessdate = 2007-09-02 | language =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternatives to fee-for-visit or service===
Ontario has also attempted to move the system away from bill for service or visit and toward preventive and community-based approaches to healthcare. The Ontario government in the early 1990s helped develop many community health care centres, often in low-income areas, which provide both medical and social support which combines health care with programs such as collective kitchens, Internet access, anti-poverty groups and groups to help people quit smoking.

While funding has decreased for these centres, and they have had to cut back,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} they have had a lower cost than the traditional fee-for-service approach.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Many of these centres are filled to capacity in terms of general doctors, and there are often fairly long waiting lists and the centres also utilize [[nurse practitioner]]s, who reduce the workload on the doctors and increase efficiency.

===Midwives and hospital birthing reforms===
Ontario and Quebec have recently licensed [[midwives]], providing another option for childbirth which can reduce costs for uncomplicated births. Midwives remain close to hospital facilities in case the need for emergency care emerges. These births often cost much less than the traditional hospital delivery.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Hospitals have also reformed their approach to birthing by adding private birthing areas, often with a hot tub (which is good for relieving pain without medication).

===Privatization===
Currently, privately owned and operated hospitals that allow patients to pay [[Out-of-pocket expenses|out-of-pocket]] for services cannot obtain public funding in Canada, as they contravene the "equal accessibility" tenets of the [[Canada Health Act]]. Some politicians and medical professionals have proposed{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} allowing public funding for these hospitals. Workers' Compensation Boards, the [[Canadian Forces]], the RCMP, federally incarcerated prisoners, and medical care for which an insurance company has liability (e.g., motor vehicle accidents) all pay for health care outside of the public systems in all provinces.&lt;ref name="Canada Health Act Overview"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taxpayer.com/main/news.php?news_id=1833 B.C. Canadian Taxpayers Federation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071108232550/http://www.taxpayer.com/main/news.php?news_id=1833 |date=November 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Quebec, a recent legal change has allowed this reform to occur. In June 2005, the Supreme Court of Canada overturned a Quebec law preventing people from buying private health insurance to pay for medical services available through the publicly funded system and this ruling does not apply outside the province. See: [[Chaoulli v. Quebec (Attorney General)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
| title = Chaoulli v. Quebec (Attorney General), 2005 SCC 35
| accessdate = 2011-07-11

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2005, the Quebec government announced that it would allow residents to purchase private medical insurance to comply with this ruling.

Private insurance from companies such as [[Blue Cross Blue Shield Association|Blue Cross]], [[Green Shield Canada|Green Shield]] and [[Manulife]] have been available for many years to cover services not covered by the Canadian health care system, such as dental care and some eye care. Private insurance is provided by many employers as a benefit.

The Canadian Medical Association (CMA) released a report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=fe42e2be-077a-4193-a7c0-d6fc2e242269&amp;k=12821 |title=Doctors’ group prescribes private health care |publisher=Canada.com |date=2007-07-30 |accessdate=2011-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026020309/http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=fe42e2be-077a-4193-a7c0-d6fc2e242269&amp;k=12821 |archivedate=2012-10-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in July 2007 endorsing private healthcare as a means to improve an ailing healthcare system. [[Brian Day|Dr. Brian Day]], who acted as President of the CMA in 2007/2008, is the owner of the largest private healthcare hospital in Canada and a proponent of mixed public and private healthcare in Canada.

===Canadian Health Practitioner standards===
It is generally accepted that physicians arriving in Canada from other countries must meet Canadian Health Practitioner standards. So there is concern that doctors from other countries are not trained or educated to meet Canadian standards. Consequently, doctors who want to practise in Canada must meet the same educational and medical qualifications as Canadian-trained practitioners.  Others suggest that the [[Canadian Medical Association]], the [[Ontario Medical Association]], and the regulatory bodies (the provincial [[Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada|Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons]]) have created too much red tape to allow qualified doctors to practise in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=10763392|pmc=1232340|year=2000|author1=Mahim|first1=A|title=Red tape is strangling foreign-trained physicians|journal=CMAJ |volume=162|issue=7|pages=972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada's health system is ranked 30th in the world, suggesting the logic of the doctor shortage defies the statistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cthealth.server101.com/Old%20Universal%20Health%20Care/united_states_spends_most_on_health,_but_france_no__1_in_treatment.htm |title=Universal Health Care – Canada ranks 30th |publisher=Cthealth.server101.com |date=2000-06-20 |accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact according to a report by Keith Leslie of the Canadian Press in the Chronicle Journal, Nov 21, 2005, over 10,000 trained doctors are working in the United States, a country ranked 37th in the world. It would suggest money or the perception of better working conditions, or both, are resulting in an exodus of Canadian doctors (and nurses) to the USA.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Ont. Medi Scare – Chronicle Journal, Thunder Bay, November 21, 2005 – Physician shortage puts stability of health-care system at risk. OMA&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to recognize that many consider the doctor shortage in Canada to be a very severe problem affecting all sectors of health care. It may relate in part to the details of how doctors are paid; a detail often misunderstood. In Canada, almost all doctors receive a fee per-visit, not per-service. It has been suggested that this type of "fee-for-visit" payment system can encourage complexity, volume visits, repeat visits, referrals, and testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epe.lac-bac.gc.ca/100/200/300/fraser/health_reform/improving.html |title=Improving health care for Canadians |publisher=Epe.lac-bac.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.benefitnews.com/feedback/views34.cfm |title=Health Care Costs Nobody Talks About |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2007-04-08 |accessdate=2011-06-06 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070408035710/http://www.benefitnews.com/feedback/views34.cfm |archivedate=2007-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One consequence of the shortage in Canada is that a great many patients are left without family doctors, and trained specialists, making early intervention very difficult. As the article in the Toronto Star specially isolates, it is not so much a problem of a doctor shortage but of a shortage of 'licensed doctors'. [[Michael Urbanski]] states that Canada already has a hidden reserve of foreign-trained MDs eager to begin medical practice. "However, what's crucial to understanding the issue of doctor shortage in Ontario is that while the Liberal government is planning to go "poaching" for other countries' doctors, there are an estimated 4,000 internationally trained doctors right here in Ontario working at low-wage jobs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://triec.ca/index.asp?pageid=41&amp;int=newsite/news-media/inthenews/MediaClippings/StarAug1904.htm |title=What doctor shortage? - Toronto Star, August 19, 2004 |publisher=Triec.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929211116/http://triec.ca/index.asp?pageid=41&amp;int=newsite%2Fnews-media%2Finthenews%2FMediaClippings%2FStarAug1904.htm |archivedate=September 29, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A CBC report [6](August 21, 2006) on the health care system reports the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Dr. Albert Schumacher,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/healthcare/public_vs_private.html |title=Private verses Public – Dr. Albert Schumacher |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=2006-12-01 |accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; former president of the Canadian Medical Association estimates that 75 per cent of health-care services are delivered privately, but funded publicly. "Frontline practitioners whether they're GPs or specialists by and large are not salaried. They're small hardware stores. Same thing with labs and radiology clinics …The situation we are seeing now are more services around not being funded publicly but people having to pay for them, or their insurance companies. We have sort of a passive privatization.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a report by Keith Leslie of the Canadian Press in the Chronicle Journal, Nov 21, 2005, commenting on an Ontario Medical Association Report, prepared by the human resources committee states "The year 2005 finds the province in the midst of a deepening physician resources crisis". The report continues to report, "the government should make it easier for doctors from other provinces to work in Ontario and .... ". Here we have signs of inter-provincial competition affecting the doctor shortage in one province over another.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Essentially, privatized healthcare is not a choice of interest for lower income Canadians, it is most likely to be unaffordable and unfair to those who suffer on a social standard.

==Provincial insurance plans==
Though the [[Canada Health Act]] provides national guidelines for healthcare, the provinces have exclusive jurisdiction over health under the [[Constitution of Canada|constitution]] and are free to ignore these guidelines, although if they ignore the guidelines, the [[Government of Canada|federal government]] may deny federal funding for healthcare. All provinces currently abide by the Canada Health Act in order to receive this funding; however the [[Alberta]] legislature has considered proposals{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} to ignore the Act to allow them to implement reforms not allowed under the Act.

The federal government has no direct role in the delivery of medicine in the provinces and territories so each province and territory has its own independent public health insurance program. Under the Canada Health Act, each province and territory must provide services to members of plans in other provinces and territories.

'''Mohna Ansari''' ({{lang-ne|मोहना अन्सारी}}) is a member of [[National Human Rights Commission]] of Nepal. She was appointed to this position in October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;National Human Rights Commission-Nepal, Members &amp; Secretary, http://www.nhrcnepal.org/nhrc_members.html&lt;/ref&gt;  She is a well-known rights activist, and Nepal's only female attorney from the Muslim community.&lt;ref name="foo"&gt;Meet Mohna Ansari: Nepal's first female Muslim lawyer, Aljazeera, 13 APRIL 2016, http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/04/meet-mohna-ansari-nepal-female-muslim-lawyer-160412141331055.html&lt;/ref&gt;
She worked as a commissioner at the [[National Commission for Women|National Women Commission]] (NWC) of Nepal between 2010 and 2014.

==Early life==
Mohna Ansari was born in [[Nepalganj]], [[Banke]], in a lower middle-class [[Muslim]] family. She grew up in ''ailani'' land ''(''public land informally owned) with her family. When she was in the six grade, the land reform program introduced by the government allowed her father to pay taxes and claim ownership of the land. However, there was a counter-claim on their land, and her father lost her case in the court. She attributes this incident as inspiration to become a lawyer later in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/printedition/news/2017-02-18/we-may-have-come-a-long-way-but-there-is-much-to-achieve.html|title=We may have come a long way, but there is much to achieve|access-date=2017-04-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her family's sole source of income was her father's carpentry shop. However, her parents are illiterate, so they wanted their kids to be educated and to have careers in different sectors. Her brothers went to [[English medium]] boarding school, while she went to government school but according to her she was happy that her parent sent her to school where she got education not only [[Islamic]] but also modern education.&lt;ref name="foo" /&gt;

Financial issues plagued her college education and she was forced to drop out after her first year. She joined college three years later upon getting a scholarship. Then, she enrolled in a [[Bachelor of Laws|bachelor in law]] at Mahendra Multiple College, the only government college in [[Nepalgunj]] and graduated in 2003. During her studies, she supported herself by teaching in schools and working as a private tutor. She also found time to write articles about issues affecting women and children for local newspapers.&lt;ref name="foo" /&gt;
She has an additional degree, a master's degree in sociology. She also participated in a course on the "Human Rights and Peace Studies" conducted by South Asian Forum for Human Rights (SAFHR) in 2004.&lt;ref name="name" /&gt;

==Career==
She started her career as a [[journalist]] at a young age, reporting mainly on women and children issues, and partially got involved with the work of the [[Amnesty International]] Nepal as well as INSEC. She was appointed by the government as a member of the Regional Sports Development Committee for Mid-Western Region in 1994. After her graduation in 2003, she joined the Nepal Bar Association [[Banke]] and managed a legal assistance program for vulnerable [[women]] and children.&lt;ref name="name" /&gt;
 
From 2004 to 2010, Ansari worked with several national and international organizations including Action Aid Nepal, the McConnell Foundation, the Women's Power Development Center and the [[UNDP]] covering the areas of [[women empowerment]] and [[social inclusion]], [[gender]] and [[equity theory|equity]], [[legal education]], [[conflict resolution]], peace building and mediation and [[human rights]]. As one of the expert panel appointed by the SNV Nepal in 2010, she wrote a paper for the National Inclusion Commission (NIC) on social inclusion of [[Muslims]] in Nepal. She is also a master trainer of the “Gender and Equity Concerns” and has trained hundreds of men and women.&lt;ref name="name" /&gt;

She presented [[Scholarly paper|paper]]s on women and children's issues in international forums in [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Philippines]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Thailand]], [[Cambodia]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], and [[United States]]. Recently in 2014, she presented a paper on “Statelessness Among Women and Children in Nepal” in the Global Forum on Statelessness in The Hague.&lt;ref name="name" /&gt;

==Controversy==
In 2016, Ansari attended the Universal Periodic Review of Nepal at the Human Rights Council in Geneva as a member of the National Human Rights Commission. Speaking on behalf of the Commission, Ansari spoke about the use of state force in the suppression of the [[Madhesh]] movement, and discriminatory citizenship provisions.&lt;ref name="roo"&gt;International outcry as Nepal PM Oli takes Mohana Ansari to task over her Geneva remarks, OnlineKhabar  | Friday, April 15th, 2016 1:10 PM, http://english.onlinekhabar.com/2016/04/15/375076&lt;/ref&gt; While she was leading an investigation team for the Madhesh movement, the team found that live ammunition was used instead of rubber bullets.&lt;ref&gt;Unveiling Nepal's constitution amid deadly protests,20 SEPTEMBER 2015, Aljazeera, http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2015/09/unveiling-nepal-constitution-deadly-protests-150920102909569.html&lt;/ref&gt; Following this meeting, the then Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli raised questions with NHRC Chairman Anup Raj Sharma and other commissioners about the speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/04/14/nepal-end-intimidation-human-rights-commission|title=Nepal: End Intimidation of Human Rights Commission|date=2016-04-14|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2017-04-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asiapacificforum.net/news/nepal-government-urged-respect-nhrcs-independence/|title=Nepal government urged to respect NHRC’s independence {{!}} Asia Pacific Forum|website=www.asiapacificforum.net|language=en|access-date=2017-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nikhil Narayan, the senior legal adviser to ICJ (South Asia), said this summons and criticism threatened members of the NHRC, and prevented the Commission from discharging its duties independently.&lt;ref name="roo" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14295">'''National Bullying Prevention Month''' is a campaign in the United States founded in 2006 by '''PACER's National Bullying Prevention Center'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.morganhilltimes.com/news/197737-national-bullying-prevention-awareness-week Morgan Hill Times Article]&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign is held during the month of October and unites communities nationwide to educate and raise awareness of [[bullying]] prevention. Traditionally held the first week in October, the event was expanded in 2010 to include activities, education, and awareness building for the entire month. National Bullying Prevention Month is recognized in communities across the United States, with hundreds of schools and organizations signing on as partners. Facebook,&lt;ref&gt;[http://memisupport.wordpress.com/2010/10/04/demi-lovatos-anti-bullying-psa-facebook-campaign-2/ Memi Support]&lt;/ref&gt; CNN&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2010/OPINION/10/07/hertzog.down.syndrome.son/?hpt=Sbin CNN.com posting - Activist Inspired by Down syndrome Son]&lt;/ref&gt; and Yahoo! Kids&lt;ref&gt;[http://kids.yahoo.com/parents/blog/1008/38--No+Bull%21 Yahoo! Kids Editor Blog Post]&lt;/ref&gt; have supported the month through media outreach and dissemination.

PACER developed the initial campaign National Bullying Prevention and Awareness Week in response to the need to raise awareness of bullying, as it was historically viewed "a childhood rite of passage" and believed that bullying "made kids tougher", when the reality is that bullying has devastating effects such as school avoidance, loss of self-esteem, increased anxiety, and depression. PACER reached out to the community through partnerships with education based organizations such as National PTA, American Federation of Teachers and National Education Association to provide schools, parents and students with resources to respond to bullying behavior and to begin the shift of societal acceptance of bullying to social change of addressing the issue through education and support. PACER disseminated nationwide press releases through the partners and media channels, encouraging a call to action to educate the community about their role in bullying prevention, which provided the groundwork for the campaign to be consistently recognized as an annual event.

"Childhood bullying is a significant problem nationwide," said Paula F. Goldberg, executive director of PACER, a national parent center located in Minnesota. "It can cause school absenteeism, mental and physical stress, poor school performance, poor self-esteem, and, in some cases, school violence. Statistics show that 160,000 children in the United States miss school each day as a result of being bullied. That's not acceptable. "Teachers and parents can play a critical role in creating a climate where bullying is not tolerated. When adults and children stand together, bullying ends," Goldberg said.

==Ideology==
As adopted in the January 2013 declaration of ideology, the decision-making council of the National Movement has indicated its three main components: identity (nation, family, people), sovereignty (the state, culture, economy) and freedom (of speech, management, people); identified the awareness and commitment of the young generation of Poles as the strength of the National Movement and pledged to work on the transformation of the homeland, emphasized the idea of the nation, understood as a cultural community formed by generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://narodowcy2014.pl/idea/|title=narodowcy2014.pl  –  Deklaracja Ideowa|work=narodowcy2014.pl|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020194655/http://narodowcy2014.pl/idea/|archivedate=2014-10-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; National Movement advocates fight for the sovereignty of the country, to repair the political and economic state and defending the freedom of its citizens, as well as the realisation in the sphere of culture and politics of traditional values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mw.org.pl/index.php/ruch-narodowy/|title=Młodzież Wszechpolska   » RUCH NARODOWY|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the Movement is a fundamental social change - the so-called. "Overthrow of the republic of the Round Table". Declares itself as a social movement which is a network of community initiatives for state sovereignty and national identity.

In the absence of hierarchical and organisational dependencies, the movement will be guided by the common symbols, and the demands of the electorate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiadomosci.onet.pl/tylko-w-onecie/powstaje-ruch-narodowy/kfm2z|title=Powstaje Ruch Narodowy|author=Grzegorz Krawczyk|date=12 November 2012|work=Onet Wiadomości}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the symbols is the image of the nationalist right, which formed in the struggle for Polish independence. For most of the activists of the Movement such symbols are also soldiers of the army of the underground [[National Armed Forces]] (NSZ), who fought during World War II and after the war against the [[Occupation of Poland (1939–45)|German and Soviet occupation]]. National Armed Forces, founded by the military part of the underground organisation nationalist camp in 1942, also declared obedience to submit to the Army. Among the soldiers of the National Armed Forces of the Supervisory Board sees its historical similarity and should continue to operate. Fundamental important dates to the Movement is the day commemorating the creation of the National Armed Forces attributable to 22 September, the anniversary of Captain [[Witold Pilecki]]'s death sentence and 1 March - National Day of Remembrance "Soldiers accursed" (from 2011 official holiday) and attributable to the November 11 march Independence. National Movement is also trying to commemorate the anniversary of the [[Martial law in Poland|imposition of martial law]] and the 1981 workers' [[Poznań uprising of 1956|uprising in Poznań]] in 1956.

National Movement, a coalition of independent groups, presents a conservative position on social issues. According to the program, decided at the second congress of 2014 the movement traditional ally of the [[Catholic Church]] and will strive to uphold traditional Christian values. The movement also refers to the tradition and heritage of ancient Rome.&lt;ref&gt;''My jesteśmy Rzymianami, jesteśmy synami i córkami Rzymu antycznego, Rzymu w rozumieniu katolickim, jesteśmy dziedzicami Wiecznego Rzymu'' – Robert Winnicki podczas II Ogólnopolskiego Kongresu Ruchu Narodowego, 3 May 2014"&lt;/ref&gt; The progress of civilisation, which was to take place in Poland thanks to EU funds, is treated as a partial compensation for the losses that Poland suffered in connection with the unilateral opening of the market in the pre-accession period, while Polish banking sector depends on foreign capital.&lt;ref&gt;narodowcy2014.pl/krzysztof-bosak-w-warszawskiej-tvp-o-gospodarce/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economy===
The outline of the economic program was presented by Krzysztof Bosak during the second congress of the Movement. According to the RN, it is possible to combine a wide range of economic freedoms with constructive approach to the state, furnished on the basis of the principles of thrift and subsidiarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ruchnarodowy.org/wystapienie-krzysztofa-bosaka-na-kongresie-ruchu-narodowego|title=Wystąpienie Krzysztofa Bosaka na Kongresie Ruchu Narodowego - Ruch Narodowy|work=Ruch Narodowy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of the Institute for National Strategy, will bring together experts and work out a modern program for the National Movement.

The movement is opposed to the introduction of the [[euro]] in Poland.

===Foreign policy===
The National Movement is assumed to be an [[Euroscepticism|eurosceptic]] grouping.

In a joint statement with the Hungarian [[Jobbik]] on the situation in Ukraine, they have indicated a desire to deepen cooperation between the two groups. They announced the Polish-Hungarian exchange of lists of candidates for election to the European Parliament in 2014 (which ultimately did not happen).&lt;ref&gt;http://wyborcza.pl/1,75478,15341109,Polscy_narodowcy_ida_z_Jobbikiem_do_UE.html&lt;/ref&gt; Hungarian and Polish nationalists believe that national governments devote national interests in favour of [[Federalism in Europe|eurofederalism]]. In this particular case, both national movements called together the national authorities of their countries for political and diplomatic efforts to protect endangered the rights of national minorities in Ukraine due to the revolutionary mood in the east, including promoting the symbolism and characters associated with the Ukrainian ethnic chauvinism that in the context of historical experience violently celebrated national minorities in these lands.

On December 21, 1975, six militants attacked the semi-annual meeting of [[OPEC]] leaders in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]; the attackers took more than 60 hostages after killing an Austrian policeman, an Iraqi OPEC security officer, and a Libyan economist. Several other individuals were wounded. The self-named "Arm of the Arab Revolution" group was led by [[Carlos the Jackal]]. The siege ended two days later, after flights to [[Algiers]] and [[Tripoli]], with all the hostages and terrorists walking away from the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wien-vienna.com/opec.php |title=OPEC raid 1975 |publisher=Wien-Vienna.com |accessdate=February 15, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126110600/http://www.wien-vienna.com/opec.php |archivedate=January 26, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Siege ==
[[File:OPEC Siege.pdf|right|thumb|The path taken by the attackers inside [[OPEC]] Headquarters]]
On December 21, 1975, Saudi Arabian Minister of Petroleum [[Ahmed Zaki Yamani]] and the other oil ministers of the members of OPEC were taken hostage in [[Vienna, Austria]], where the ministers were attending a meeting at the OPEC headquarters at Dr-Karl-Lueger-Ring 10 (renamed Universitätsring in 2012). The hostage attack was orchestrated by a six-person team led by Venezuelan terrorist [[Carlos the Jackal]] (which included [[Gabriele Kröcher-Tiedemann]], [[Hans-Joachim Klein]] and [[Anis al-Naqqash]]). The self-named "Arm of the Arab Revolution" group called for the liberation of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. Carlos planned to take over the conference by force and kidnap all eleven oil ministers in attendance and hold them for ransom, with the exception of Ahmed Zaki Yamani and Iran's [[Jamshid Amuzegar]], who were to be executed.

Carlos led his team past two police officers in the building's lobby and up to the first floor, where a police officer, an Iraqi plainclothes security guard and a young Libyan economist, Yusuf al-Azmarly, were shot dead.

As Carlos entered the conference room and fired shots into the ceiling, the delegates ducked under the table. The terrorists searched for Ahmed Zaki Yamani and then divided the sixty-three hostages into groups. Delegates of friendly countries were moved toward the door, 'neutrals' were placed in the centre of the room and the 'enemies' were placed along the back wall, next to a stack of explosives. This last group included those from Saudi Arabia, Iran, Qatar and the UAE. Carlos demanded that a bus be provided to take his group and the hostages to the airport, where a [[DC-9]] airplane and crew would be waiting. In the meantime, Carlos briefed Yamani on his plan to eventually fly to [[Aden]], where Yamani and Amuzegar would be killed. During the attack Hans-Joachim Klein was shot and injured; however, Carlos refused to leave him behind and demanded medical assistance. Kurdish-born doctor Wiriya Rawenduzy, who was living and working in Vienna, volunteered to accompany the terrorists on board in exchange for the hostages' safe release upon arrival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Face to Face with Terror: From the Vienna OPEC Attack to the Terrorism of Today |first=Ingrid |last=Weiss |publisher=Ibera |date=2004 |isbn=978-3850522199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlos demanded that the Austrian authorities read a communiqué about the Palestinian cause on Austrian radio and television networks every two hours. To avoid the threatened execution of a hostage every 15 minutes, the Austrian government agreed and the communiqué was broadcast as requested. The communiqué written in French demanded the Arab world wage a "total liberation war". Vienna Police said that 96 hostages were taken during the siege. The attackers freed about 50 Vienna resident hostages and a bus was provided the following morning at 6:40 as requested and 42 hostages were boarded and taken to the airport.

== Flight ==

An [[Austrian Airlines]] DC-9 was provided for the group and was airborne just after 9:00, with explosives placed under Yamani's seat. The plane first stopped in Algiers, where Carlos left the plane to meet with the Algierian Foreign minister. Five oil-ministers and 31 other hostages were released, five oil ministers were kept.

The refueled plane left for Tripoli, where there was trouble in acquiring another plane as had been planned. Carlos decided to instead return to Algiers and change to a [[Boeing 707]], a plane large enough to fly to [[Baghdad]] nonstop. Ten more hostages were released before leaving.

With only ten hostages remaining, the Boeing 707 left for Algiers and arrived at 3:40&amp;nbsp;a.m. After leaving the plane to meet with the Algerians, Carlos talked with his colleagues in the front cabin of the plane and then told Yamani and Amuzegar that they would be released at mid-day. Carlos was then called from the plane a second time and returned after two hours.

At this second meeting it is believed that Carlos held a phone conversation with Algerian President [[Houari Boumédienne]], who informed Carlos that the oil ministers' deaths would result in an attack on the plane. Yamani's biography{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} suggests that the Algerians had used a covert listening device on the front of the aircraft to overhear the earlier conversation between the terrorists, and found that Carlos had in fact still planned to murder the two oil ministers. Boumédienne must also have offered Carlos asylum at this time and possibly financial compensation for failing to complete his assignment.

On returning to the plane Carlos stood before Yamani and Amuzegar and expressed his regret at not being able to murder them. He then told the hostages that he and his comrades would leave the plane, after which they would all be free. After waiting for the terrorists to leave, Yamani and the other nine hostages followed and were taken to the airport by Algerian Foreign Minister [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]]. The terrorists were present in the next lounge and Khalid, the Palestinian, asked to speak to Yamani. As his hand reached for his coat, Khalid was surrounded by guards and a gun was found concealed in a holster. All the hostages and terrorists walked away from the situation, two days after it began.

== Aftermath ==
In the years following the OPEC raid, Carlos's accomplices revealed that the operation was commanded by [[Wadie Haddad]], a founder of the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]]. They also claimed that the idea and funding came from an Arab president, widely thought to be Libya's [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]]. Fellow militants [[Bassam Abu Sharif]] and Klein claimed that Carlos received and kept a ransom between US$20&amp;nbsp;million and US$50&amp;nbsp;million from "an Arab president". Carlos claimed that Saudi Arabia paid ransom on behalf of Iran, but that the money was "diverted en route and lost by the Revolution".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/terrorists_spies/terrorists/jackal/12.html |title=Carlos the Jackal: Trail of Terror |publisher=truTV |first=Patrick |last=Bellamy |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107125703/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/terrorists_spies/terrorists/jackal/12.html |archivedate=January 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3t5jtM2faD8C&amp;pg=PA102 |title=Jackal: The Complete Story of the Legendary Terrorist, Carlos the Jackal |first=John |last=Follain |publisher=Arcade Publishing |year=1998 |isbn=978-1559704663 |page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was finally captured in 1994 and is serving life sentences for at least 16 other murders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.sky.com/story/carlos-the-jackal-jailed-over-1974-paris-grenade-attack-10816476 |title='Carlos the Jackal' jailed over 1974 Paris grenade attack |first=Gary |last=Anderson |publisher=Sky News |date=March 28, 2017 |accessdate=April 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==

=== Films ===
The 1997 film ''[[The Assignment (1997 film)|The Assignment]]'' depicts the OPEC siege early in the film.

The 2010 Olivier Assayas-directed series [[Carlos (TV miniseries)|''Carlos'']] documented the life of Ramírez Sánchez. The film won a [[Golden Globe Award]] for Best Miniseries or Television Movie. Carlos was played by the Venezuelan actor [[Édgar Ramírez]].

'''Older People for Older People''' (or '''O4O''') was a project aimed to provide a greater degree of independence to the elderly whom were located in  non-urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Older People for Older People|url=http://www.understandingglasgow.com/asset_based_approaches/older_people_for_older_people_o40|website=Understanding Glasglow|publisher=Th Glasglow Indicator Project|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project was a winner at the Regions for Economic Change Conference in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=O4O Project wins RegioStars 2012 Awards|url=http://www.northernperiphery.eu/en/newsletter/show/&amp;tid=105|website=Northern Periphery Program|publisher=European Regional Development Fund|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

With the intent to focus on what the elderly could provide for a community, and recognize their capabilities,&lt;ref name="o4os" /&gt; the project investigated the means of using [[community building]] to facilitate the provision of services available to those people of [[old age]]. It used older people's skills to assist other older people,&lt;ref name="ruralgateway" /&gt; delaying the times at which they move out of their own homes.&lt;ref name="pressandjournal 2010" /&gt; It was part-financed by the [[European Regional Development Fund]] through the Northern Periphery Programme and covered rural areas of [[Scotland]], [[Finland]], [[Greenland]], [[Northern Ireland]] and [[Sweden]].&lt;ref name="europa video" /&gt; It ran from 2008&lt;ref name="ruralgateway" /&gt; to 2013.&lt;ref name="hie 2012" /&gt; At the end of the project, some services developed under it continued to be provided.&lt;ref name="northernperiphery 2012" /&gt;

The project was supported by the [[University of the Highlands and Islands]], the [[University of Aberdeen]] and the [[Highlands and Islands Enterprise]].&lt;ref name="hie 2012" /&gt; The project was shortlisted for the RegioStars awards in December 2011&lt;ref name="centreforhealthscience 2011" /&gt; and announced as winner at the Regions for Economic Change Conference in 2012.&lt;ref name="hie 2012" /&gt;

== Outcomes ==

One project outcome was the development of a toolkit to help others create their own O4O projects. Some example outcomes which were developed are [[community transport]], [[supported housing]], [[self-sufficiency]] via a luncheon club using shared local produce, [[volunteering]] and schemes for friendship and helping.&lt;ref name="europa mobilising" /&gt;&lt;ref name="o4os" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30857">'''Ostracism''' ({{lang-el|ὀστρακισμός}}, ''ostrakismos'') was a procedure under the [[Athenian democracy]] in which any [[citizen]] could be [[exile|expelled]] from the [[city-state]] of [[Athens]] for ten years. While some instances clearly expressed popular anger at the citizen, ostracism was often used preemptively. It was used as a way of neutralizing someone thought to be a threat to the state or potential [[tyrant]]. It has been called an "honourable exile" by scholar P. J. Rhodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://irisonline.org.uk/index.php/features/features-archive/197-voting-in-ancient-athens|title=Words|first=Iris Online|last=Editor|date=|website=irisonline.org.uk|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "ostracism" continues to be used for various cases of social [[shunning]].

==Procedure==
The name is derived from the ''[[ostracon|ostraka]]'' (singular ''ostrakon'', ὄστρακον), referring to the [[sherd|pottery shard]]s that were used as voting tokens. Broken pottery, abundant and virtually free, served as a kind of scrap paper (in contrast to [[papyrus]], which was imported from [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] as a high-quality writing surface, and was thus too costly to be disposable).

Each year the Athenians were asked in the [[ecclesia (ancient Athens)|assembly]] whether they wished to hold an ostracism. The question was put in the sixth of the [[Attic calendar#State calendar|ten months used for state business under the democracy]] (January or February in the modern [[Gregorian Calendar]]). If they voted "yes", then an ostracism would be held two months later. In a section of the [[agora]] set off and suitably barriered,&lt;ref&gt;According to some sources, part of the [[agora]] was roped-off, according to others it was temporarily immured with wooden planks.&lt;/ref&gt; citizens gave the name of those they wished to be ostracised to a scribe, as many of them were illiterate, and they then scratched the name on pottery shards, and deposited them in [[urn]]s. The presiding officials counted the ''ostraka'' submitted and sorted the names into separate piles. The person whose pile contained the most ''ostraka'' would be banished, provided that an additional criterion of a [[quorum]] was met, about which there are two principal sources:
* According to [[Plutarch]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0009%3Achapter%3D7%3Asection%3D5] Life of Aristides 7.5&lt;/ref&gt; the ostracism was considered valid if the total number of votes cast was at least 6,000.
* According to a fragment of [[Philochorus]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.attalus.org/translate/philochorus.html] See n. 30&lt;/ref&gt; the "winner" of the ostracism must have obtained at least 6,000 votes.
Plutarch's evidence for a quorum of 6,000, on [[a priori and a posteriori|''a priori'']] grounds a necessity for ostracism also per the account of Philochorus, accords with the number required for grants of citizenship in the following century and is generally preferred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Democracy and Participation in Athens |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |author=Sinclair, R. K. |isbn=0-521-42389-9 |year=1988 |pages=114–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Greek and Roman Voting and Elections |author=Staveley, E.S. |publisher=[[Thames and Hudson]] |year=1972 |pages=89ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Classical Athenian Democracy |author=Stockton, David |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=0-19-814697-3 |year=1990 |pages=33ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mass and Elite in Democratic Athens |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |author=Ober, Josiah |isbn=0-691-02864-8 |year=1988 |page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The person nominated had ten days to leave the city. If he attempted to return, the penalty was [[capital punishment|death]]. Notably, the property of the man banished was not confiscated and there was no loss of status. After the ten years, he was allowed to return without stigma. It was possible for the assembly to recall an ostracised person ahead of time; before the [[Persian Wars|Persian invasion]] of 479 BC, an amnesty was declared under which at least two ostracised leaders—[[Pericles]]' father Xanthippus and [[Aristides]] 'the Just'—are known to have returned. Similarly, [[Cimon]], ostracised in 461 BC, was recalled during an emergency.&lt;ref name="lifesimon17_2_6"&gt;[[Plutarch]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0182:text=Cim.:chapter=17 ''Life of Cimon'' 17.2–6].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinction from other Athenian democratic processes==
Ostracism was crucially different from [[Athenian law court (classical period)|Athenian law]] at the time; there was no charge, and no defence could be mounted by the person expelled. The two stages of the procedure ran in the reverse order from that used under almost any trial system&amp;nbsp;— here it is as if a jury are first asked ''"Do you want to find someone guilty?"'', and subsequently asked ''"Whom do you wish to accuse?"''. Equally out of place in a judicial framework is perhaps the institution's most peculiar feature: that it can take place at most once a year, and only for one person. In this it resembles the Greek ''[[pharmakos]]'' or [[scapegoat]]&amp;nbsp;— though in contrast, ''pharmakos'' generally ejected a lowly member of the community.

A further distinction between these two modes (and one not obvious from a modern perspective) is that ostracism was an automatic procedure that required no initiative from any individual, with the vote simply occurring on the wish of the electorate&amp;nbsp;— a diffuse exercise of power. By contrast, an Athenian trial needed the initiative of a particular citizen-prosecutor. While prosecution often led to a counterattack (or was a counterattack itself), no such response was possible in the case of ostracism as responsibility lay with the polity as a whole. In contrast to a trial, ostracism generally reduced political tension rather than increased it.

Although ten years of exile would have been difficult for an Athenian to face, it was relatively mild in comparison to the kind of sentences inflicted by courts; when dealing with politicians held to be acting against the interests of the people, Athenian juries could inflict very severe penalties such as death, unpayably large fines, confiscation of property, permanent exile and loss of citizens' rights through [[atimia (loss of citizen rights)|''atimia'']]. Further, the elite Athenians who suffered ostracism were rich or noble men who had connections or [[xenos (guest-friend)|''xenoi'']] in the wider Greek world and who, unlike genuine exiles, were able to access their income in [[Attica]] from abroad. In [[Plutarch]], following as he does the anti-democratic line common in elite sources, the fact that people might be recalled early appears to be another example of the inconsistency of [[majoritarianism]] that was characteristic of Athenian democracy. However, ten years of exile usually resolved whatever had prompted the expulsion. Ostracism was simply a pragmatic measure; the concept of serving out the full sentence did not apply as it was a preventative measure, not a punitive one.

One curious window on the practicalities of ostracism comes from the cache of 190 [[ostracon|ostraka]] discovered dumped in a well next to the [[Acropolis, Athens|acropolis]].&lt;ref&gt;Broneer, Oscar. "Excavations on the North Slope of the Acropolis, 1937". ''Hesperia'', 1938. pp. 228-243.&lt;/ref&gt; From the handwriting they appear to have been written by fourteen individuals and bear the name of [[Themistocles]], ostracised before 471 BC and were evidently meant for distribution to voters. This was not necessarily evidence of [[electoral fraud]] (being no worse than modern voting instruction cards), but their being dumped in the well may suggest that their creators wished to hide them. If so, these ostraka provide an example of organized groups attempting to influence the outcome of ostracisms. The two-month gap between the first and second phases would have easily allowed for such a campaign.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

There is another interpretation, however, according to which these ostraka were prepared beforehand by enterprising businessmen who offered to them for sale to citizens who could not easily inscribe the desired names for themselves or who simply wished to save time.&lt;ref&gt;See Surikov, pp. 284–294&lt;/ref&gt;

The two-month gap is a key feature in the institution, much as in [[election]]s under modern [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]]. It first prevented the candidate for expulsion being chosen out of immediate anger, although an Athenian general such as Cimon would have not wanted to lose a battle the week before such a second vote.&lt;ref name="lifesimon17_2_6"/&gt; Secondly, it opened up a period for discussion (or perhaps agitation), whether informally in daily talk or [[public speaking|public speeches]] before the Athenian assembly or Athenian courts.&lt;span class="reference"&gt;&lt;sup id="ref_Oration" class="plainlinksneverexpand"&gt;[{{fullurl:Ostracism}}#endnote_Oration *]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In this process a consensus, or rival consensuses, might emerge. Further, in that time of waiting, ordinary Athenian citizens must have felt a certain power over the greatest members of their city; conversely, the most prominent citizens had an incentive to worry how their social inferiors regarded them.

==Period of operation==
Ostracism was not in use throughout the whole period of Athenian democracy (circa 506–322 BC), but only occurred in the fifth century BC. The standard account, found in [[Aristotle]]'s [[Constitution of the Athenians (Aristotle)|Constitution of the Athenians]] 22.3,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0046:chapter=22|title=Aristotle, 
Athenian Constitution,
chapter 22|author=|date=|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; attributes the establishment to [[Cleisthenes]], a pivotal reformer in the creation of the democracy. In that case ostracism would have been in place from around 506 BC. The first victim of the practice, however, was not expelled until 487 BC&amp;nbsp;— nearly twenty years later. Over the course of the next sixty years some twelve or more individuals followed him. The list may not be complete, but there is good reason to believe the Athenians did not feel the need to eject someone in this way every year. The list of known ostracisms runs as follows:
[[File:Athen Stoa Ostrakismos 2.jpg|thumb|[[Ostracon|Ostraca]] from 482 BC]]
*487 Hipparchos son of Charmos, a relative of the [[tyrant]] [[Peisistratos (Athens)|Peisistratos]]
*486 [[Megacles]] son of [[Hippocrates]]; Cleisthenes' nephew (possibly ostracised twice&lt;ref name="Lysias"&gt;Lysias 14.39&lt;/ref&gt;)
*485 [[Kallixenos]] nephew of [[Cleisthenes]] and head of the Alcmaeonids at the time (not known for certain){{cn|date=August 2017}}
*484 [[Xanthippus]] son of Ariphron; [[Pericles]]' father
*482 [[Aristides]] son of Lysimachus
*471 [[Themistocles]] son of Neocles (last possible year)
*461 [[Cimon]] son of [[Miltiades the Younger|Miltiades]]
*460 [[Alcibiades (disambiguation)|Alcibiades]] son of Kleinias (possibly ostracised twice&lt;ref name="Lysias"/&gt;)
*457 Menon son of Meneclides [less certain]
*442 [[Thucydides (politician)|Thucydides]] son of Melesias
*440s Callias son of Didymos [less certain]
*440s [[Damon (ancient Greek musicologist)|Damon]] son of Damonides [less certain]
*416 [[Hyperbolus]] son of Antiphanes (±1 year)

Around twelve thousand political ostraka have been excavated in the Athenian agora and in the [[Kerameikos]]. {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} The second victim, Cleisthenes' nephew Megacles, is named by 4647 of these, but for a second undated ostracism not listed above. The known ostracisms seem to fall into three distinct phases: the 480s BC, mid-century 461–443 BC and finally the years 417–415: this matches fairly well with the clustering of known expulsions, although Themistocles before 471 may count as an exception. This suggests that ostracism fell in and out of fashion.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mabel Lang]], (1990). ''Ostraka'': 3–6, Athens.&lt;/ref&gt;

The last known ostracism was that of [[Hyperbolos]] in circa 417 BC. There is no sign of its use after the [[Peloponnesian War]], when democracy was restored after the [[oligarchic]] coup of [[Thirty Tyrants|the Thirty]] had collapsed in 403 BC. However, while ostracism was not an active feature of the 4th-century version of democracy, it remained; the question was put to the assembly each year, but they did not wish to hold one.

==Purpose==
Because ostracism was carried out by thousands of people over many decades of an evolving political situation and culture, it did not serve a single monolithic purpose. Observations can be made about the outcomes, as well as the initial purpose for which it was created.

The first rash of people ostracised in the decade after the defeat of the first [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] invasion at [[Marathon, Greece|Marathon]] in 490 BC were all related or connected to the [[tyrant]] [[Peisistratos]], who had controlled Athens for 36 years up to 527 BC. After his son [[Hippias (tyrant)|Hippias]] was deposed with [[Sparta]]n help in 510 BC, the family sought refuge with the Persians, and nearly twenty years later Hippias landed with their invasion force at Marathon. [[Tyranny]] and Persian aggression were paired threats facing the new democratic regime at Athens, and ostracism was used against both.

Tyranny and democracy had arisen at Athens out of clashes between regional and factional groups organised around politicians, including Cleisthenes. As a reaction, in many of its features the democracy strove to reduce the role of factions as the focus of citizen loyalties. Ostracism, too, may have been intended to work in the same direction: by temporarily decapitating a faction, it could help to defuse confrontations that threatened the order of the State.

In later decades when the threat of tyranny was remote, ostracism seems to have been used as a way to decide between radically opposed policies. For instance, in 443 BC [[Thucydides, son of Melesias]] (not to be confused with [[Thucydides|the historian of the same name]]) was ostracised. He led an [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] opposition to Athenian [[imperialism]] and in particular to [[Pericles]]' building program on the acropolis, which was funded by taxes created for the wars against the [[Achaemenid Empire]]. By expelling Thucydides the Athenian people sent a clear message about the direction of Athenian policy.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0182:text=Per.:chapter=11 Life of Pericles 11]–[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0182:text=Per.:chapter=11 12], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0182:text=Per.:chapter=14 14].&lt;/ref&gt; Similar but more controversial claims have been made about the ostracism of [[Cimon]] in 461 BC.

The motives of individual voting citizens cannot, of course, be known. Many of the surviving ostraka name people otherwise unattested. They may well be just someone the submitter disliked, and voted for in moment of private spite. As such, it may be seen as a secular, civic variant of Athenian [[curse tablet]]s, studied in scholarly literature under the Latin name ''defixiones'', where small dolls were wrapped in lead sheets written with curses and then buried, sometimes stuck through with nails for good measure.

In one anecdote about Aristides, known as "the Just", who was ostracised in 482, an illiterate citizen, not recognising him, came up to ask him to write the name Aristides on his ostrakon. When Aristides asked why, the man replied it was because he was sick of hearing him being called "the Just".&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0182:text=Arist.:chapter=7 Life of Aristides 7.7]&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps merely the sense that someone had become too arrogant or prominent was enough to get someone's name onto an ostrakon. Ostracism rituals could have also been an attempt to dissuade people from covertly committing murder or assassination for intolerable or emerging individuals of power so as to create an open arena or outlet for those harboring primal frustrations and urges or political motivations. The solution for murder, in Gregory H. Padowitz's theory, would then be "ostracism" which would ultimately be beneficial for all parties – the unfortunate individual would live and get a second chance and society would be spared the ugliness of feuds, civil war, political jams and murder.

==Fall into disuse==
The last ostracism, that of [[Hyperbolos]] in or near 417 BC, is elaborately narrated by Plutarch in three separate ''lives'': Hyperbolos is pictured urging the people to expel one of his rivals, but they, [[Nicias]] and [[Alcibiades]], laying aside their own hostility for a moment, use their combined influence to have him ostracised instead. According to Plutarch, the people then become disgusted with ostracism and abandoned the procedure forever.

In part ostracism lapsed as a procedure at the end of the fifth century because it was replaced by the ''[[graphe paranomon]]'', a regular court action under which a much larger number of politicians might be targeted, instead of just one a year as with ostracism, and with greater severity. But it may already have come to seem like an anachronism as factional alliances organised around important men became increasingly less significant in the later period, and power was more specifically located in the interaction of the individual speaker with the power of the assembly and the courts. The threat to the democratic system in the late 5th century came not from [[tyranny]] but from [[Oligarchy|oligarchic]] coups, threats of which became prominent after two brief seizures of power, in 411 BC by [[Athenian coup of 411 BC|"the Four Hundred"]] and in 404 BC by [[Thirty Tyrants|"the Thirty"]], which were not dependent on single powerful individuals. Ostracism was not an effective defence against the oligarchic threat and it was not so used.

==Analogues==
Other cities are known to have set up forms of ostracism on the Athenian model, namely [[Megara]], [[Miletos]], [[Argos]] and [[Syracuse, Sicily]]. In the last of these it was referred to as ''[[petalism]]os'', because the names were written on [[olive]] leaves. Little is known about these institutions. Furthermore, [[sherd|pottery shard]]s identified as ''ostraka'' have been found in [[Chersonesos Taurica]], leading historians to the conclusion that a similar institution existed there as well, in spite of the silence of the ancient records on that count.&lt;ref name="Surikov_ch"&gt;see Surikov, pp. 121–122.&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar modern practice is the [[recall election]], in which the electoral body removes its representation from an elected officer.
Unlike under modern voting procedures, the Athenians did not have to adhere to a strict format for the inscribing of ''ostraka''. Many extant ''ostraka'' show that it was possible to write expletives, short epigrams or cryptic injunctions beside the name of the candidate without invalidating the vote.&lt;ref name="Surikov"&gt;see Surikov, pp. 73–80, and references therein.&lt;/ref&gt; For example:
* Kallixenes, son of Aristonimos, "the traitor"
* Archen, "lover of foreigners"
* Agasias, "the donkey"
* [[Megacles]], "the adulterer"

==Modern usage==
The social psychologist [[Kipling Williams]] has written extensively on ostracism as a modern phenomenon. Williams defines ostracism as "any act or acts of ignoring and excluding of an individual or groups by an individual or a group".&lt;ref&gt;Williams, K. 2001. Ostracism: The Power of Silence. New York: Guilford Press. p. ix&lt;/ref&gt; Williams suggests that the most common form of ostracism in a modern context is refusing to communicate with a person. By refusing to communicate with a person, that person is effectively ignored and excluded.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, K. 2001. Ostracism: The Power of Silence. New York: Guilford Press. pp. 2-18.&lt;/ref&gt; The advent of the internet has made ostracism much easier to engage in, and conversely much more difficult to detect, with Williams and others describing this online ostracism as "cyberostracism". In email communication, in particular, it is relatively easy for a person or organization to ignore and exclude a specific person, through simply refusing to communicate with the person. Karen Douglas thus describes "unanswered emails" as constituting a form of cyberostracism,&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, K. 2008. 'Antisocial Communication on Electronic Mail and the Internet'. In: A. Konjin, M. Tanis, S. Utz, and S Barnes (eds.) Mediated Interpersonal Communication. (200-214). New York: Routledge. p.203.&lt;/ref&gt; and similarly Eric Wesselmann and Kipling Williams describe "ignored emails" as a form of cyberostracism.&lt;ref&gt;Wesselmann, E. and Williams, K. 2013. 'Ostracism and Stages of Coping'. In: C. Dewall (ed.) Oxford Handbook of Social Exclusion. (20-30). Oxford: Oxford University Press. p.21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Williams and his colleagues have charted responses to ostracism in some five thousand cases, and found two distinctive patterns of response.  The first is increased group-conformity, in a quest for re-admittance; the second is to become more provocative and hostile to the group, seeking attention rather than acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;J. Rose, ''The Literary Churchill'' (Yale 2015) p. 233&lt;/ref&gt;

As it researched as well by many social psychologists, (Williams, 2007) research has demonstrated that being rejected from groups can have profound effects on a person (Smith, E. R., Macki, D. M., &amp; Claypool, H. M., (2014) social psychoogy. Psychology Press. p.409)

==Whistleblowing==
Research suggests that ostracism is a common reprisal strategy used by organizations in response to whistleblowing. Kipling Williams, in a survey on US whistleblowers, found that 100% reported post-whistleblowing ostracism.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, K. 2001. Ostracism: The Power of Silence. New York: Guilford Press. pp. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander Brown similarly found that post-whistleblowing ostracism is a common response, and indeed describes ostracism as form of "covert" reprisal, as it is normally so difficult to identify and investigate.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, A.J. (ed) 2008. Whistling While They Work. Canberra: ANU Press. p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Qahr and Ashti==
'''Qahr and Ashti''' is a culture-specific [[Iran]]ian form of personal shunning, most frequently of another family member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rXS3DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA37&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;dq=qahr+iran+family&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oT3NSxqBBC&amp;sig=_vZxLJDHB6cYL-vmE3pPaanhfB0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwje7ta2ycfTAhWFWCYKHZmlDLAQ6AEIIDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=qahr+iran+family&amp;f=false|title=Iran: At War With History|first=John W.|last=Limbert|date=22 July 2016|publisher=Routledge|accessdate=25 March 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Qahr and ashti are described by Dr. Kambiz Behzadi&lt;ref&gt;U.S. News Health Care, Dr. Kambiz Behzadi, MD http://health.usnews.com/doctors/kambiz-behzadi-1166{{full citation needed|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as:

In the Islamic Republic of Iran, the husband only has the right to show ''qahr'' towards his wife, the wife does not have this right to show qahr towards her husband,&lt;ref&gt;''Gender Relationships in Iran'' http://www.cultureofiran.com/gender_relations_in_iran.html&lt;/ref&gt; as the husband's family rank is that of Head of Household while the wife has a much lower family ranking.&lt;ref&gt;Treatise On Rights (Risalat al-Huquq) https://www.al-islam.org/treatise-rights-risalat-al-huquq-imam-zain-ul-abideen&lt;/ref&gt;  She may practice qahr only towards others of equal or lower status.

''Qahr'' is avoidance of a lower-ranking family member who has committed a perceived insult.  It is one of several ritualized social customs of Iranian culture.&lt;ref&gt;''Iran: At War with History'', by John Limbert, pub. 1987 ppg 37-38https://books.google.com/books?id=rXS3DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA37&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;dq=qahr+iranian+behavior&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oT1PRsnIAA&amp;sig=givEDjpjh1QgCDLtP2-FzTZPrcg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwinzO_lorfPAhXH7SYKHWADBAIQ6AEIJzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=qahr%20iranian%20behavior&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes==
{{note|Oration}} Oration IV of [[Andocides]] purports itself to be speech urging the ostracism of Alcibiades in 415 BC,  but it is probably not authentic.

{{note|Lysias}} The second ostracisms of Megacles and of Alcibiades son of Kleinias are reported only by Lysias in the quoted passage&amp;nbsp;– no other ancient author refers to them. Thus, Lysias's report is regarded as probably spurious by many modern historians.

&lt;small&gt;Note that the ancient sources on ostracism are mostly 4th century or much later and often limited to brief descriptions such as notes by [[lexicographer]]s. Most of the narrative and analytical passages of any length come from Plutarch writing five centuries later and with little sympathy for democratic practices. There are no contemporary accounts that can take one into the experiences of participants: a dense account of Athenian democracy can only be made on the basis of the much fuller sources available in the 4th century, especially the [[Attic orators]],  after ostracism had fallen into disuse. Most of such references are a 4th-century memory of the institution.&lt;/small&gt;

The '''PRECEDE–PROCEED model''' is a cost–benefit evaluation framework proposed in 1974 by [[Lawrence W. Green]] that can help health program planners, policy makers and other evaluators, analyze situations and design health programs efficiently.&lt;ref name="Green74"&gt;Green, L.W. (1974). Toward cost–benefit evaluations of health education: some concepts, methods, and examples. ''Health Education Monographs'' 2 (Suppl. 2): 34–64.&lt;/ref&gt; It provides a comprehensive structure for assessing health and quality of life needs, and for designing, implementing and evaluating health promotion and other public health programs to meet those needs.&lt;ref name="Green05"&gt;Green, L., Kreuter, M. (2005). ''Health program planning: An educational and ecological approach''. 4th edition.

DiClemente (Eds.) ''Injury and Violence Prevention: Behavioral Science Theories, Methods, and Applications''. 1st edition, pp. 127–158. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass&lt;/ref&gt; One purpose and guiding principle of the PRECEDE–PROCEED model is to direct initial attention to outcomes, rather than inputs. It guides planners through a process that starts with desired outcomes and then works backwards in the causal chain to identify a mix of strategies for achieving those objectives.&lt;ref name="Glanz05"&gt;Glanz, K. and Rimer, B. (2005). ''Theory at a Glance: A Guide for Health Promotion Practice'', 2nd Edition. Publication Number: T052. NIH Number: 05-3896. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. National Institutes of Health. Bethesda: National Cancer Institute. Accessed on June 26, 2011 at {{cite web |url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/cancerlibrary/theory.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016173516/http://cancer.gov/cancertopics/cancerlibrary/theory.pdf |archivedate=October 16, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A fundamental assumption of the model is the active participation of its intended audience — that is, that the participants ("consumers") will take an active part in defining their own problems, establishing their goals and developing their solutions.&lt;ref name="Green05" /&gt;

In this framework, health behavior is regarded as being influenced by both individual and environmental factors, and hence has two distinct parts. First is an "educational diagnosis" – ''PRECEDE'', an acronym for '''P'''redisposing, '''R'''einforcing and '''E'''nabling '''C'''onstructs in '''E'''ducational '''D'''iagnosis and '''E'''valuation. Second is an "ecological diagnosis" – ''PROCEED'', for '''P'''olicy, '''R'''egulatory, and '''O'''rganizational '''C'''onstructs in '''E'''ducational and '''E'''nvironmental '''D'''evelopment.&lt;ref name="Green05" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gielen08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Glanz05" /&gt; The model is multidimensional and is founded in the social/behavioral sciences, epidemiology, administration, and education. The systematic use of the framework in a series of clinical and field trials confirmed the utility and predictive validity of the model as a planning tool.&lt;ref name="Green75"&gt;Green, L.W., Levine, D.M. and Deeds, S.G. (1975). Clinical trials of health education for hypertensive outpatients: design and baseline data. ''Preventive Medicine'' 4(4): 417–25&lt;/ref&gt;

== Brief history and purpose ==

The PRECEDE framework was first developed and introduced in the 1970s by [[Lawrence W. Green|Green]] and colleagues.&lt;ref name="Green74" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Green05" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gielen08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Glanz05" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Green80"&gt;Green, L.W., Kreuter, M.W., Deeds, S.G., Partridge, K.B. (1980). ''Health Education Planning: A Diagnostic Approach''. Mountain View, California: Mayfield&lt;/ref&gt; PRECEDE is based on the premise that, just as a medical diagnosis precedes a treatment plan, an educational diagnosis of the problem is very essential before developing and implementing the intervention plan.&lt;ref name="Gielen08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Glanz05" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Green80" /&gt; Predisposing factors include knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, personal preferences, existing skills, and self-efficacy towards the desired behavior change. Reinforcing factors include factors that reward or reinforce the desired behavior change, including social support, economic rewards, and changing social norms. Enabling factors are skills or physical factors such as availability and accessibility of resources, or services that facilitate achievement of motivation to change behavior.&lt;ref name="Green74" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Glanz05" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Green80" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ransdell01"&gt;Ransdell, L.B. (2001). Using the PRECEDE–PROCEED Model to Increase Productivity in Health Education Faculty. ''The International Electronic Journal of Health Education'', 4: 276–282&lt;/ref&gt; The model has led to &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt; more than 1000 &lt;/span&gt; published studies, applications and commentaries on the model in the professional and scientific literature.

In the early 1990s the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion at the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC, US Department of Health and Human Services) gave additional national prominence to the PRECEDE model.  Dr. Marshall Kreuter, Director of the Division of Chronic Disease Control and Community Intervention and his staff adapted and incorporated PRECEDE within a model planning process offered, with federal technical assistance, to state and local health departments to plan and evaluate health promotion programs (with their coalitions). The CDC model was called ''PATCH'', for '''P'''lanned '''A'''pproach to '''C'''ommunity '''H'''ealth. The relevance of this initiative to the application of PRECEDE, and the inspiration for some of the extensions of the (PATCH) model to incorporate PROCEED dimensions was detailed in a special issue of the Journal of Health Education in 1992.&lt;ref name="GreenKr92"&gt;Green, L.W., Kreuter, M.W. (1992). CDC's Planned Approach to Community Health as an application of PRECEDE and an inspiration for PROCEED. Journal of Health Education 23(3): 140–147&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, "PROCEED" was added to the framework in consideration of the growing recognition of the expansion of health education to encompass policy, regulatory and related ecological/environmental factors, in determining health and health behaviors.&lt;ref name="Green05" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gielen08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Glanz05" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Green91"&gt;Green, L., Kreuter, M. (1991). ''Health promotion planning: An educational and environmental approach''. 2nd edition. Mountain View, CA: Mayfield Publishing Company&lt;/ref&gt; As health-related behaviors, such as smoking and alcohol abuse, increased or became more resistant to change, so did the recognition that these behaviors are influenced by factors such as the media, politics, and businesses, which are outside the direct control of the individuals. Hence more "ecological" methods were needed to identify and influence these environmental and [[social determinants of health]] behaviors. With the emergence of and rapid growth in the field of genetics, the PRECEDE–PROCEED model was revised, in 2005, to include and address the growing knowledge in this field.&lt;ref name="Green05" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gielen08" /&gt;

== Description ==

The PRECEDE–PROCEED planning model consists of four planning phases, one implementation phase, and 3 evaluation phases.&lt;ref name="Green05" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gielen08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Glanz05" /&gt;

===Phase 1 – social diagnosis===
The first stage in the program planning phase deals with identifying and evaluating the social problems that affect the quality of life of a population of interest. Social assessment is the "application, through broad participation, of multiple sources of information, both objective and subjective, designed to expand the mutual understanding of people regarding their aspirations for the common good".&lt;ref name="Green05" /&gt; During this stage, the program planners try to gain an understanding of the social problems that affect the quality of life of the community and its members, their strengths, weaknesses, and resources; and their readiness to change. This is done through various activities such as developing a planning committee, holding community forums, and conducting [[focus group]]s, [[Survey (human research)|survey]]s, and/or [[interview]]s. These activities will engage the beneficiaries in the planning process and planners will be able to see the issues just as the community sees them.

===Phase 2 – epidemiological, behavioral, and environmental diagnosis===
''Epidemiological diagnosis'' deals with determining and focusing on specific health issue(s) of the community, and the behavioral and environmental factors related to prioritized health needs of the community. Based on these priorities, achievable program goals and objectives for the program being developed are established.&lt;ref name="Green05" /&gt; Epidemiological assessment may include secondary data analysis or original data collection — examples of epidemiological data include [[vital statistics (government records)|vital statistics]], state and national health surveys, medical and administrative records, etc.  Genetic factors, although not directly changeable through a health promotion program, are becoming increasingly important in understanding health problems and counseling people with genetic risks, or may be useful in identifying high-risk groups for intervention.&lt;ref name="Green05" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gielen08" /&gt;

''Behavioral diagnosis'' — This is the analysis of behavioral links to the goals or problems that are identified in the social or epidemiological diagnosis. The behavioral ascertainment of a health issue is understood, firstly, through those behaviors that exemplify the severity of the disease (e.g. tobacco use among teenagers); secondly, through the behavior of the individuals who directly affect the individual at risk (e.g. parents of teenagers who keep cigarettes at home); and thirdly, through the actions of the decision-makers that affects the environment of the individuals at risk (e.g. law enforcement actions that restrict teens' access to cigarettes). Once behavioral diagnosis is completed for each health problem identified, the planner is able to develop more specific and effective interventions.

''Environmental diagnosis'' — This is a parallel analysis of social and physical environmental factors other than specific actions that could be linked to behaviors. In this assessment, environmental factors beyond the control of the individual are modified to influence the health outcome. For example, poor nutritional status among children may be due to the availability of unhealthful foods in school. This may require not only educational interventions, but also additional strategies such as influencing the behaviors of a school's food service managers.

===Phase 3 – educational and ecological diagnosis===
Once the behavioral and environmental factors are identified and interventions selected, planners can start to work on selecting factors that, if modified, will most likely result in behavior change, as well as sustain it. These factors are classified as 1) predisposing, 2) enabling, and 3) reinforcing factors.&lt;ref name="Green05" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gielen08" /&gt;

''Predisposing factors'' are any characteristics of a person or population that motivate behavior prior to or during the occurrence of that behavior.&lt;ref name="Green05" /&gt; They include an individual's knowledge, beliefs, values, and attitudes.

''Enabling factors'' are those characteristics of the environment that facilitate action and any skill or resource required to attain specific behavior.&lt;ref name="Green05" /&gt; They include programs, services, availability and accessibility of resources, or new skills required to enable behavior change.

''Reinforcing factors'' are rewards or punishments following or anticipated as a consequence of a behavior.&lt;ref name="Green05" /&gt; They serve to strengthen the motivation for a behavior. Some of the reinforcing factors include social support, peer support, etc.

===Phase 4 – administrative and policy diagnosis===
This phase focuses on the administrative and organizational concerns that must be addressed prior to program implementation. This includes assessment of resources, development and allocation of budgets, looking at organizational barriers, and coordination of the program with other departments, including external organizations and the community.&lt;ref name="GreenOt08"&gt;Green L.W., Ottoson J.M. (2008). Public health education and health promotion. In L.F. Novick, C.B. Morrow, &amp; G.P. Mays (eds.). ''Public Health Administration: Principles for Population-Based Management''. Boston: Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers, pp. 589–620&lt;/ref&gt;

''Administrative diagnosis'' assesses policies, resources, circumstances and prevailing organizational situations that could hinder or facilitate the development of the health program.

''Policy diagnosis'' assesses the compatibility of program goals and objectives with those of the organization and its administration. This evaluates whether program goals fit into the mission statements, rules and regulations that are needed for the implementation and sustainability of the program.

===Phase 5 – implementation of the program===

===Phase 6 – process evaluation=== 
This phase is used to evaluate the process by which the program is being implemented. This phase determines whether the program is being implemented according to the protocol, and determines whether the objectives of the program are being met. It also helps identify modifications that may be needed to improve the program.

===Phase 7 – impact evaluation=== 
This phase measures the effectiveness of the program with regards to the intermediate objectives as well as the changes in predisposing, enabling, and reinforcing factors. Often this phase is used to evaluate the performance of educators.

===Phase 8 – outcome evaluation=== 
This phase measures change in terms of overall objectives as well as changes in health and social benefits or quality of life. That is, it determines the effect of the program in the health and quality of life of the community.

== Conclusion==

The PRECEDE–PROCEED model is a participatory model for creating successful community health promotion and other public health interventions. It is based on the premise that behavior change is by and large voluntary, and that health programs are more likely to be effective if they are planned and evaluated with the active participation of those who will implement them, and those who are affected by them. Thus, it looks at health and other issues within the context of the community.

Čobanković finished elementary and high school in [[Ilok]], after that he attended Faculty of Agriculture at [[University of Zagreb]] where he obtained his B.Sc. in agriculture. From 2000 until 2001 he was Prefect of [[Vukovar-Srijem County]].&lt;ref name="MPS"/&gt; Between 2003 and 2008 he was the Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management in the [[Cabinet of Ivo Sanader I]].&lt;ref name="MPS"/&gt; On January 12, 2008 he was named Minister of Regional Development, Forestry and Water Management in the [[Cabinet of Ivo Sanader II]]. In 2010 he became deputy-prime minister of [[Government of Croatia]] in the [[Cabinet of Jadranka Kosor]].

Čobanković pleaded guilty and he was sentenced in March 2013 to one year in jail for corruption. The sentence was consequently reduced to a community sentence in an exchange for full cooperation with the prosecutor in the corruption case against the former Croatian premier [[Ivo Sanader]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/cobankovic-nece-ici-u-zatvor--godinu-dana-radit-ce-za-opce-dobro/1089369/|title=Čobanković neće ići u zatvor, godinu dana radit će za opće dobro|work=[[Jutarnji list]]|date=7 March 2013|language=Croatian|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8950">'''Pierre Mulele''' (11 August 1929 &amp;ndash; 3 or 9 October 1968) was a [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] rebel active in the [[Simba Rebellion]] of 1964. Mulele had also been minister of education in [[Patrice Lumumba]]'s [[Lumumba Government|cabinet]]. With the assassination of Lumumba in January 1961 and the arrest of his recognised deputy [[Antoine Gizenga]] one year later, Mulele became one of the top Lumumbists determined to continue the struggle. He went to Cairo, Egypt, as the representative of the Lumumbists' Congo National Liberation Committee based in [[Brazzaville]]. From Cairo he proceeded to [[People's Republic of China|China]] in 1963 to receive military training, and also took a group of Congolese youths with him, who received training in guerrilla tactics.&lt;ref&gt;China's Policy in Africa 1958-71. By Alaba Ogunsanwo. {{ISBN|0521134404}}. Page 175.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the [[Bapende]] ethnic group.&lt;ref&gt;Congo, [[David van Reybrouck]], 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:First Congolese government.jpg|thumb|Mulele (third from the right) with the [[Lumumba Government]], 1960]]
===Simba Rebellion===
In January 1964, a new conflict broke out as Congolese rebels calling themselves "Simba" ([[Swahili language|Swahili]] for "lion") rebelled against the government. They were led by Mulele, [[Gaston Soumialot]] and [[Christophe Gbenye]], former members of [[Antoine Gizenga]]'s [[Parti Solidaire Africain]] (PSA). 

During the [[Simba Rebellion]], Mulele, who had previously undergone training in the [[Eastern bloc]] as well as the [[People's Republic of China]], led a [[Maoism|Maoist]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irinnews.org/print.asp?ReportID=52245&lt;/ref&gt; faction in the [[Kwilu District]]. This came to be known as the Kwilu Rebellion. Mulele was an avowed Maoist, and for this reason his insurgency was supported by communist China. By the end of April 1964, Mulele's rebellion had been rendered somewhat less dangerous by the government. The USSR, with an embassy in the national capital of Leopoldville, did not support Mulele's Kwilu revolt and had no part in its preparation: lack of support from the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] was in the first place responsible for Mulele turning to China as his patron.&lt;ref&gt;China's Policy in Africa 1958-71. By Alaba Ogunsanwo. {{ISBN|0521134404}}. Page 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, by August the Simba insurgents had captured [[Kisangani|Stanleyville]] and set up a rebel government there. However, the Congolese central government requested foreign intervention, and the troops fighting under the command of Soumialot and Gbenye were routed in November 1964, after intense drives by central government troops officered by foreign [[mercenary|mercenaries]]. The landing of Belgian paratroopers in Stanleyville also proved instrumental in the rebels' defeat, as did key military assistance from the United States. On 24 November 1964, five US Air Force [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|C-130]] transports dropped 350 Belgian paratroopers of the [[Immediate Reaction Cell|Para-Commando Regiment]] onto the airfield at Stanleyville to rescue 2,000 European civilians being held hostage by the Simbas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=David|last=Van Reybrouck|page=326|title=Congo|ISBN=978-0-00-756291-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This move made the United States very unpopular in Africa at the time.&lt;ref&gt;China's Policy in Africa 1958-71. By Alaba Ogunsanwo. {{ISBN|0521134404}}. Page 177.&lt;/ref&gt; After the rebellion's defeat, Mulele fled into exile in [[Republic of the Congo|Congo-Brazzaville]]. 

In 1968, then-[[Heads of state of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|President]] Joseph-Désiré Mobutu (later [[Mobutu Sese Seko]]) lured Mulele out of exile by promising him amnesty. Mulele returned to [[Republic of the Congo (Léopoldville)|Congo-Kinshasa]], believing he would be granted amnesty. Instead, he was publicly tortured and executed: his eyes were pulled from their sockets, his genitals were ripped off, and his limbs were amputated one by one, all while he was alive. What was left was dumped in the [[Congo River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=In The Footsteps of Mr. Kurtz: Living on the Brink of Disaster in Mobutu's Congo |author=Michela Wrong |authorlink=Michela Wrong |pages=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=In the footsteps of Mr Kurtz: living on the brink of disaster in the Congo |author=Michela Wrong |authorlink=Michela Wrong |year=2000 |isbn=1-84115-421-0 |pages=86 |publisher=[[HarperCollins|Fourth Estate Ltd (Harpercollins Publishers)]]}}&lt;!-- note this is a different edition, do not remove as it aids [[WP:Verifiability]] --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ideology and Maoism===

When the Kwilu rebellion broke out in 1964, the revolt was led by Mulele in a way reminiscent of the Chinese communist revolutionary tactics during the [[Chinese Civil War]]. Mulele required his fighters to adhere to a very strict moral code, emphasising self-discipline and respect for civilians. The tribal peasant fighters proved difficult to control and many disregarded Mulele's orders. The eight instructions on conduct Mulele issued to his guerrilla fighters showed the great influence [[Mao Zedong|Mao Zedong's]] writings regarding "people's war" had on the Kwilu insurgency. Mulele's code of conduct was as follows:&lt;ref&gt;China's Policy in Africa 1958-71. By Alaba Ogunsanwo. {{ISBN|0521134404}}. Page 175.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Respect all men, even bad ones.
#Buy the goods of villagers in all honesty and without stealing.
#Return borrowed things in good time and without trouble.
#Pay for things which you have broken and in good spirit.
#Do not harm or hurt others.
#Do not destroy or trample on other people's land.
#Respect women and do not amuse yourselves with them as you would like to.
#Do not make your prisoners of war suffer.
The attempt to adapt Maoist Chinese practice to African conditions also extended to Mulele's use of the peasants as the mainstay of his revolution.

==Personal life==

Mulele was born in [[Kwilu Province|Isulu-Matende]]. He married [[Leonie Abo]], a fellow fighter who spent five years in the underground rebel movement alongside guerrillas loyal to Mulele. In 1968, after her husband's assassination, she fled to Congo-Brazzaville where she has since lived. Abo has made a great effort to preserve the memory of her slain revolutionary husband, Pierre Mulele.&lt;ref name=abiodun&gt;[http://www.notevenpast.org/read/gender-and-decolonization-congo-legacy-patrice-lumumba-2010 Gender and Decolonization in the Congo: The Legacy of Patrice Lumumba (2010)], Tosin Abiodun, NotEvenPast, Retrieved 26 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;  The Belgian book ''Une Femme du Congo'' (''A Congolese Woman''), by [[Ludo Martens]], tells Abo's life story.

'''''Pork barrel''''' is a [[metaphor]] for the [[Appropriation (law)|appropriation]] of government spending for localized projects secured solely or primarily to bring money to a representative's [[district]]. The usage originated in [[American English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Drudge |first=Michael W.

However, scholars use it as a technical term regarding legislative control of local appropriations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Congressional Pork Barrel in a Republican Era|year=2008|last1=Bickers|first1=Kenneth N.|last2=Stein|first2=Robert M. |journal=The Journal of Politics|volume=62|issue=4 |pages=1070–1086|doi= 10.1111/0022-3816.00046  |jstor=2647865 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shepsle | first1 = Kenneth A. | last2 = Weingast | first2 = Barry R. |title=Political Preferences for the Pork Barrel: A Generalization|journal=American Journal of Political Science|volume= 25|issue= 1 |year=1981|pages= 96–111|jstor=2110914|doi=10.2307/2110914 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and etymology==
The term ''pork barrel politics'' usually refers to spending which is intended to benefit [[Electoral district|constituents]] of a [[politician]] in return for their political support, either in the form of [[Campaign finance|campaign contributions]] or votes. In the popular 1863 story "The Children of the Public", [[Edward Everett Hale]] used the term ''pork barrel'' as a homely metaphor for any form of public spending to the citizenry.&lt;ref&gt;The story first appeared in ''[[Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper]],'' Jan. 24 and Jan. 31, 1863. {{Cite journal | last = Hale | first = Edward Everett | author-link = Edward Everett Hale | title = The Children of the Public | volume = The Man without a Country and Other Tales | pages = 97–175 | year = 1910 | publisher = Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after the [[American Civil War]], the term came to be used in a derogatory sense. The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' dates the modern sense of the term from 1873.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50184318?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=pork+barrel&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10 Oxford English Dictionary]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''pork barrel,'' draft revision June 2008. Retrieved October 22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Pork barrel originally came from storing meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pork%2520barrel|title=Dictionary and Thesaurus {{!}} Merriam-Webster|website=www.merriam-webster.com|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1870s, references to "pork" were common in Congress, and the term was further popularized by a 1919 article by Chester Collins Maxey in the ''National Municipal Review'', which reported on certain legislative acts known to members of Congress as "pork barrel bills". He claimed that the phrase originated in a pre-Civil War practice of giving slaves a barrel of salt pork as a reward and requiring them to compete among themselves to get their share of the handout.&lt;ref&gt;

More generally, a barrel of [[salt pork]] was a common [[larder]] item in 19th century households, and could be used as a measure of the family's financial well-being. For example, in his 1845 novel ''The Chainbearer'', [[James Fenimore Cooper]] wrote: "I hold a family to be in a desperate way, when the mother can see the bottom of the pork barrel."&lt;ref&gt;

==Definition==
Typically, "pork" involves funding for government programs whose [[economic]] or service benefits are concentrated in a particular area but whose costs are spread among all taxpayers. [[Public works]] projects, certain national defense spending projects, and [[agricultural subsidies]] are the most commonly cited examples.

[[Citizens Against Government Waste]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cagw.org/site/PageServer?pagename=reports_pigbook2006 |title=Citizens Against Government Waste: |publisher=Cagw.org |year=2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080714103840/http://www.cagw.org/site/PageServer?pagename=reports_pigbook2006 |archivedate=July 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; outlines seven criteria by which spending can be classified as "pork":
# Requested by only one chamber of Congress
# Not specifically authorized
# Not competitively awarded
# Not requested by the President
# Greatly exceeds the President's budget request or the previous year's funding
# Not the subject of Congressional hearings
# Serves only a local or special interest.

== Examples ==
An early example of pork barrel politics in the United States was the [[Bonus Bill of 1817]], which was introduced by Democrat [[John C. Calhoun]] to construct [[highways]] linking the Eastern and Southern United States to its [[Frontier#The U.S. frontier|Western frontier]] using the earnings bonus from the [[Second Bank of the United States]]. Calhoun argued for it using general welfare and post roads clauses of the [[United States Constitution]]. Although he approved of the economic development goal, President [[James Madison]] vetoed the bill as [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]].

One of the most famous alleged pork-barrel projects was the [[Big Dig (Boston, Massachusetts)|Big Dig]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. The Big Dig was a project to relocate an existing {{convert|3.5|mi|km|adj=on}} section of the [[interstate highway]] system underground. The official planning phase started in 1982; the construction work was done between 1991 and 2006; and the project concluded on December 31, 2007. It ended up costing US$14.6 [[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]], or over US$4 billion per mile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2006/08/06/big_dig_failures_threaten_federal_funding/ | work=The Boston Globe | title=Big Dig failures threaten federal funding | date=August 6, 2006 | first1=Rick | last1=Klein}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tip O'Neill]] (D-Mass), after whom one of the Big Dig tunnels was named, pushed to have the Big Dig funded by the federal government while he was the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rimer | first = Sara |url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2010/01/01/travel/escapes/01boston.html |title=In Boston, Where Change Is in the Winter Air |work=New York Times |date= 30 December 2009 |accessdate=17 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 U.S. presidential campaign]], the [[Gravina Island Bridge]] (also known as the "Bridge to Nowhere") in Alaska was cited as an example of pork barrel spending. The bridge, pushed for by Republican Senator [[Ted Stevens]], was projected to cost $398 million and would connect the island's 50 residents and the [[Ketchikan International Airport]] to [[Revillagigedo Island]] and [[Ketchikan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = $315 million bridge to nowhere | url = http://www.taxpayer.net/user_uploads/file/Transportation/gravinabridge.pdf | publisher = Taxpayers for Common Sense | date = February 9, 2005 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081025113307/http://www.taxpayer.net/user_uploads/file/Transportation/gravinabridge.pdf | archivedate = October 25, 2008 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Hawaii Senator [[Daniel Inouye]] described himself as “the No. 1 earmarks guy in the U.S. Congress.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bangordailynews.com/2012/12/18/politics/daniel-inouye-was-war-hero-senate-deal-maker-no-1-earmarks-guy/|title=Daniel Inouye was war hero, Senate deal maker, 'No. 1 earmarks guy'|last=Brown|first=Emma|last2=Post|first2=The Washington|website=The Bangor Daily News|access-date=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inouye regularly passed earmarks for funding in the state of Hawaii including military  and transportation spending.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/earmarks.php?cid=n00001762|title=Daniel K.

Pork-barrel projects, which differ from ''[[Earmark (politics)|earmarks]]'', are added to the federal budget by members of the appropriation committees of [[United States Congress]]. This allows delivery of federal funds to the local district or state of the appropriation committee member, often accommodating major campaign contributors. To a certain extent, a member of Congress is judged by their ability to deliver funds to their constituents. The Chairman and the [[ranking member]] of the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations]] are in a position to deliver significant benefits to their states. Researchers Anthony Fowler and Andrew B. Hall claim that this still does not account for the high reelection rates of incumbent representatives in American legislatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fowler | first1 = Anthony | last2 = Hall | first2 = Andrew B. | title = Congressional seniority and pork: a pig fat myth? | journal = [[European Journal of Political Economy]] | volume = 40 | issue = A | pages = 42–56 | doi= 10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2015.07.006 | date = December 2015 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Madrid-Sevilla high-speed rail line|Madrid-Seville high-speed line]] was a noted example of pork barrel politics in Spain.  [[Pasqual Maragall]] revealed details of an unwritten agreement between him and [[Felipe Gonzalez]], the prime minister at the time who was from [[Seville]].  The agreement was that Barcelona would receive the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] and Seville would receive the high-speed railway line (which opened in 1992).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Iglesias | first = Natalia | title = Maragall revela que acordó con González que el AVE llegara primero a Sevilla | url = http://elpais.com/diario/2007/11/18/catalunya/1195351643_850215.html | work = [[El País]] | date = 18 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was in spite of position of the [[Madrid-Barcelona high-speed rail line]] as Spain's most profitable high-speed line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Solo 11 de 179 rutas de tren en España cubren gastos operativos | url = http://www.preferente.com/noticias-de-transportes/solo-11-de-179-rutas-de-tren-en-espana-cubren-gastos-de-explotacion-235175.html | work = La Preferente }}&lt;/ref&gt; Barcelona received its AVE connection in 2008, though with many advantages that the line to Seville does not have, e.g. full-speed bypasses [http://www.ferropedia.es/wiki/LAV_Madrid_-_Sevilla#Velocidades_autorizadas LAV Madrid – Sevilla] and [http://www.ferropedia.es/wiki/LAV_Madrid_-_Zaragoza_-_Barcelona#Velocidades_m.C3.A1ximas_y_limitaciones_de_velocidad.5B10.5D LAV Madrid – Zaragoza – Barcelona]:  the decision to construct the line to Seville was only taken in 1986 and construction was rushed, so that the line would be ready for the [[Seville Expo '92]].

==Use of the term outside the United States==
In other countries, the practice is often called [[patronage]], but this word does not always imply corrupt or undesirable conduct.

=== Australia ===
"Pork barrel" is frequently used in [[Australian politics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Taylor | first = Lenore | title = The Australian: PM rolls out his own pork barrel | url = http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23801061-5013946,00.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080605193323/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0%2C25197%2C23801061-5013946%2C00.html | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 5 June 2008 | work = [[The Australian]] | publisher = [[News Corp Australia]] | date = 3 June 2008 | access-date = 31 August 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Pearlman | first1 = Jonathan | last2 = Coorey | first2 = Phillip | title = Vaile in last-ditch pork barrel | url = http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2007/11/16/1194766968042.html | work = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | date = 16 November 2007 | access-date = 31 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where [[marginal seat]]s are often accused of receiving more funding than [[safe seat]]s or, in the case of the [[Australian federal election, 2010|2010 election]] in negotiations with key [[Independent (politician)|independents]].

=== Central and Eastern Europe ===
Romanians speak of ''{{lang|ro|pomeni electorale}}'' (literally, "electoral alms"), while the Polish ''{{lang|pl|kiełbasa wyborcza}}'' means literally "election sausage". In Serbian, ''{{lang|sr|podela kolača}}'' ("cutting the cake") refers to post-electoral distribution of state-funded positions for the loyal members of the winning party. The Czech ''{{lang|cs|předvolební guláš}}'' ("pre-election [[goulash]]") has similar meaning, referring to free dishes of [[goulash]] served to potential voters during election campaign meetings targeted at lower social classes; metaphorically, it stands for any populistic political decisions that are taken before the elections with the aim of obtaining more votes. The process of diverting budget funds in favor of a project in a particular constituency is called ''{{lang|cs|porcování medvěda}}'' ("portioning of the bear") in Czech usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euro.cz/detail.jsp?id=11172 |title=Porcování medvěda zvítězilo nad ideály  |publisher=Euro.cz |date= |accessdate=14 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== India ===
In India, the term "pork barrel politics" has been employed to depict the pattern of distribution of discretionary grants by the national government (see for example Arulampalam et al. 2009)&lt;ref&gt;Arulampalam, W., Dasgupta, S., Dhillon, A. and Dutta, B., 2009. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304387808000059 Electoral goals and center-state transfers: A theoretical model and empirical evidence from India]. [[Journal of Development Economics]], 88(1), pp. 103–119. {{doi|10.1016/j.jdeveco.2008.01.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biswas et al. 2010;&lt;ref&gt;

India Review, 16(1), pp. 14–41. {{doi|10.1080/14736489.2017.1279922}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latest contribution by Sharma demonstrates that the incentives of the Prime Minister's party under a coalition system create a universalisation effect which means "giving something to everyone". Thus, the states governed by non-affiliated parties do not suffer as much as in the dominant party era. In fact, a coalition party system limits opportunities to reward party loyalty (see Sharma 2017).

===Ireland===
The term ''parish pump politics'' is more commonly used in Ireland although Independent TD [[Shane Ross]] did refer to Pork Barrel politics at a press conference for the [[Independent Alliance (Ireland)|Independent Alliance]] in the run up to the [[Irish general election, 2016|2016 General Election]], saying that the Alliance was "not interested in ''pork barrel'' politics".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/independents-not-interested-in-pork-barrel-politics-says-shane-ross-1.2547270 Independents not interested in pork barrel politics says Shane Ross]"&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being appointed [[Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport]] in the [[Members of the 32nd Dáil|32nd Dáil]] he went on to prioritise the reopening of a police station in his own constituency which was eventually delivered on the eve of the election of new Taoiseach [[Leo Varadkar]] in June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/stepaside-garda-station-to-re-open-fulfilling-key-shane-ross-demand-1.3118058|title=Stepaside Garda station to re-open, fulfilling key Shane Ross demand|work=Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== German-speaking countries ===
The German language differentiates between campaign goodies (''Wahlgeschenke'', literally "election gifts") to occur around election dates and parish-pump politics (''Kirchturmpolitik'', literally "church tower politics") for concentrating funding and reliefs to the home constituency of a politician. While the former is a technical term (neutral or slightly derogatory) the latter is always derogatory meaning that the scope of actions is limited to an area where the steeple of the politician's village can still be seen. In Switzerland the wording of provincial thinking (''Kantönligeist'', literally "[[Cantons of Switzerland|cantonal]] mind") may cover these actions as well and it is understood as a synonym in Germany and Austria.

=== Philippines ===
{{main|Priority Development Assistance Fund}}
In the [[Philippines]], the term "pork barrel" is used to mean funds allocated to the members of the [[Philippine House of Representatives]] and the [[Philippine Senate]] to spend as they see fit without going through the normal budgetary process or through the Executive Branch.  It can be used for both "hard" projects, such as buildings and roads, and "soft" projects, such as scholarships and medical expenses. The first pork barrel fund was introduced in 1922 with the passage of the first Public Works Act (Act No 3044). This pork barrel system was technically stopped by President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] during his dictatorship by abolishing Congress. It was reintroduced to the system after the restoration of the Congress in 1987. The program has had different names over the years, including the Countryside Development Fund, Congressional Initiative Fund, and currently the Priority Development Assistance Fund.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Since 2006, the PDAF was [[Philippine peso|₱]]70.0 M for each Representative and ₱200.0  M for each Senator.

During the presidency of [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]], PDAF became the biggest source of corruption among the legislators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cabacungan|first=Gil|title=Arroyo chose who, how much PDAF to give|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/471659/arroyo-chose-who-how-much-pdaf-to-give|accessdate=8 September 2013|newspaper=Inquirer.net|date=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kickback (bribery)|Kickback]]s were common and became syndicated—using pre-identified project implementers including government agencies, contractors and bogus [[non-profit corporation]]s as well as the government's [[Commission on Audit (Philippines)|Commission on Audit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/471659/arroyo-chose-who-how-much-pdaf-to-give|title=Arroyo chose who, how much PDAF to give|last=Cabacungan|first=Gil C.|website=newsinfo.inquirer.net|access-date=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2013, outrage over the ₱10 B [[Priority Development Assistance Fund scam]], involving [[Janet Lim-Napoles]] and numerous Senators and Representatives, led to widespread calls for abolition of the PDAF system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pcij.org/stories/pdaf-wins-elections-favors-political-parties/|title=PDAF wins elections, favors political parties|website=Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism|access-date=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The so-called [[Million People March]] which occurred on August 26, 2013, [[National Heroes' Day in the Philippines]], called for the end of "pork barrel" and was joined by simultaneous protests nationwide and by the [[Filipino diaspora]] around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Francisco|first=Rosemarie|title=Tens of thousands of Filipinos protest "pork barrel" funds|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/26/us-philippines-politics-idUSBRE97P01T20130826|accessdate=28 August 2013|newspaper=Reuters.com|date=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Petitioners have challenged the constitutionality of the PDAF before the high court following reports of its widespread and systematic misuse by some members of Congress in cahoots with private individuals. Three incumbent senators and several former members of the House of Representatives have been named respondents in a plunder complaint filed with the Office of the Ombudsman in connection with the alleged P10-billion pork barrel scam. Public outrage over the anomaly has resulted in the largest protest gathering under the three-year-old Aquino administration.&lt;ref name="Merueñas"&gt;{{cite news | last = Merueñas | first = Mark | title = Supreme Court declares PDAF unconstitutional| url = http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/336120/news/nation/supreme-court-declares-pdaf-unconstitutional | work = [[GMA News and Public Affairs|GMA News]] | date = 19 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 19, 2013, the Supreme Court declared the controversial Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF), or more commonly known as the pork barrel, as  unconstitutional. In a briefing, the high court declared the PDAF Article in 2013 General Approriations Act and all similar provisions on the pork barrel system as illegal because it "allowed legislators to wield, in varying gradiations, non-oversight, post-enactment authority in vital areas of budget executions (thus violating) the principle of separation of powers".&lt;ref name="Merueñas" /&gt;

=== Nordic countries  ===
Similar expressions, meaning "election meat", are used in Danish (''{{lang|da|valgflæsk}}''), Swedish (''{{lang|sv|valfläsk}}'') and Norwegian (''{{lang|no|valgflesk}}''), where they mean promises made ''before'' an election, often by a politician who has little intention of fulfilling them.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Nationalencyklopedin]]'', NE Nationalencyklopedin AB. Article ''Valfläsk''&lt;/ref&gt;
The Finnish political jargon uses ''{{lang|fi|siltarumpupolitiikka}}'' ([[culvert]] politics) in reference to national politicians concentrating on small local matters, such as construction of roads and other public works at politician's home municipality. In Iceland, the term ''kjördæmapot'' refers to the practice of funneling public funds to key voting demographics in marginal constituencies.

=== United Kingdom ===
The term is rarely used in [[British English]], although similar terms exist: '''election sweetener''', '''tax sweetener''', or just '''sweetener''' which refers to the practise of a chancellor of the exchequer leaving room in their fiscal program to announce a big tax cut or spending boost in the budget immediately prior to an election, usually targeting a key voting demographic (such as the elderly) or benefitting marginal constituencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Thornton | first = Philip | title = Brown warned on pre-election tax 'sweeteners' | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/brown-warned-on-preelection-tax-sweeteners-484599.html | work = [[The Independent]] | date = 24 February 2005 | access-date = 31 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "pork barrel" was, however, used in August 2013 by the [[Campaign for Better Transport (United Kingdom)|Campaign for Better Transport]] in their criticism of [[Danny Alexander]] MP's involvement in securing funding for the A6 Manchester Airport Relief Road which passed through a marginal Liberal Democrat constituency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Treasury minister's role in road funding 'in danger of looking like pork barrel politics' (blog) | url = http://www.bettertransport.org.uk/blogs/roads/120813_manchester_airport_link | website = bettertransport.org.uk | publisher = Campaign for Better Transport | date =  12 August 2013 | access-date = 31 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also used by [[Pete Wishart]] in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on 26 June 2017 in reference to [[Conservative–DUP agreement|the deal]] between the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] and the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] to keep the former in power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Millar |first1=Joey |title=‘It’s almost laughable!’ Greedy SNP put in place after saying DUP deal UNFAIR for Scotland |url=https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/821501/DUP-deal-theresa-may-snp-pete-wishart-damian-green |accessdate=7 August 2018 |date=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ramón Massó Tarruella''' (1928 - 2017) was a Spanish [[Communication|media and communications]] expert and a former [[Carlist]] politician.

==Early life and education==
[[File:Antiga Fabrica Borras i Masso.jpg|thumbnail|190px|left|Borràs &amp; Massó manufacture, [[Mataró]]]]
Ramón Massó Tarruella was born to an established, much branched and well-to-do [[Catalan people|Catalan]] [[bourgeoisie]] family. His grandfather, [[Ramón Massó Marcer]], originated from the small seaside town of [[Sant Pere de Ribes]]. In 1885, during rapid expansion of the Catalan [[clothing]] manufacturing, he moved to Barcelona to set up his own business; he started a company specializing in [[dye]]s for the [[textile industry]] (his cousin, [[Ramón Oliveras Massó]], became an academic and taught [[chemistry]] in the Barcelona-based [[Escuela de Ingenieros Industriales]] until 1936). His son, [[Juan Massó Soler]], entered the family business in 1912 and developed it into a successful chemical company. Member of many Catalan commercial and trade institutions, he married Nuria Tarruella Riu.

The couple had 8 children, 3 sons (José Luis, Ramón, Juan Antonio) and 5 daughters (Montserrat, Isabel, Maria Amelia, Pilar and Nuria), all raised in a profoundly [[Catholic]] and traditional ambience. In the 1950s José Luis and Juan Antonio got engaged in the family company and later turned it into [[Comercial Química Massó Sociedad Anónima]], which expanded into new market sectors and remains active until today. In the early 1960s [[John Masso|Juan Antonio]] left the family enterprise and commenced studying [[canon law]], ordained as a [[priest]] in 1965; following his transfer to Australia he later became head ([[Vicar|Regional Vicar]]) of [[Opus Dei]] there, the position retained until his death.

As a child Ramón together with his family fled Barcelona, the city which fell under the [[CNT-FAI|anarchist]] control during the first months of the [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]]. The family settled in [[San Sebastián]] in the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|nationalist zone]]. The Massó boys joined [[Pelayos (Carlist Youth Organisation)|Pelayos]], the Carlist organization for older children animated mostly by the Catalan emigrees, but terminated their engagement following [[:es:Decreto de Unificación|amalgamation]] of the Carlist and [[Falangist]] juvenile organizations; as a kid Massó took part in the 1937 anti-unification demonstrations, allegedly shouting "death to Franco" and "death to Falange". Following the end of hostilities the family returned to Barcelona, where Ramón together with his brothers became a teenage member of the Catalan Opus Dei.

In late 1940s Massó moved to [[Madrid]] studying Filosofia y Letras to graduate in Philosophy (later he became also Técnico en Publicidad). During his university years he joined [[Agrupación de Estudiantes Tradicionalistas]], a technically illegal though tolerated Carlist student organization. Enraged by increasing marginalization of Carlism within the political realm of the [[Francoist Spain|regime]] he developed his childish anti-Falangist sentiments into a firm anti-Francoist outlook. Engaged in leafleting campaigns and skirmishes against the official [[:es:Sindicato Español Universitario|SEU]] organization, in 1954 Massó (recommended by the Carlist political leader [[Manuel Fal Conde]]) grew to the position of Delegado Nacional of AET.

==Aspiring Carlist==
[[File:Don Javier 1960.jpg|thumbnail|left|170px|Don Javier, 1960]]
Massó was increasingly disappointed by the perceived somnolent atmosphere of the movement's circulos, with the older generation trapped in recollections of the long gone days of glory. Highly emotional semi-clandestine 1956 attempts to dissuade the Carlist [[Prince Xavier of Bourbon-Parma|claimant]] from a would-be dynastical union with the ''[[Alfonsism|Alfonsinos]]'' and to inspire him towards a decisive policy proved unsuccessful. The Massó-led ''aetistas'', upset with the diffident Don Javier, decided to focus on his eldest son [[Carlos Hugo, Duke of Parma|Carlos Hugo]], with whom the group found common ground during his brief stay in Madrid en route to Portugal in 1955.
 
Carlos Hugo, at that time a [[French citizen]] completing PhD in economics in [[Oxford]], threw himself into the Spanish politics in liaison with Massó and his team. Following half a year spent quietly in [[Bilbao]] on improving his [[Castellano language|castellano]] and learning Spanish politics (his key tutor Massó just commenced teaching at the local [[Colegio Gaztelueta]]), the prince made a public debut during the annual Carlist amassment at [[Montejurra]] in May 1957. The entry, repeatedly rehearsed, meticulously planned and pre-agreed with the Carlist leadership, turned out to be a masterpiece of public appearance. The unexpected prince's presentation generated exploding enthusiasm of the crowd, excited by youth, optimism and royal firmness of the speaker (though the lecture contained only one reference to God and included phrases sounding like an offer to [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]). Massó and his team ensured that ''La Proclama de Montejurra'' gets propagated in the Carlist circulos across Spain. In 1958 Carlos Hugo's speech – again carefully crafted by the prince, Massó and the team – called for profound change, put social issues on the forefront and contained a positive reference to Franco. During the following years the snowballing attendance at Montejurra transformed it from a Carlist-flavored local ''[[Via Crucis]]'' to the largest (save official, religious and football gatherings) public amassment in Francoist Spain. 
[[File:Charles-Hugues de Bourbon-Parme.jpg|thumbnail|180px|Carlos Hugo, 1964]]
The emergence of Carlos Hugo and the ''hugocarlistas'' coincided with the overall change in the Carlist strategy towards Francoism; in 1955 the intransigent Fal Conde was replaced as the movement's leader by a collective governing body, which initiated a new collaborative policy. Tactically Massó also opted for limited collaboration with Francoism (which cost him AET leadership in 1957), judging that gaining room for action is vital for his further aims.  However, while the new Carlist leader [[José María Valiente Soriano|José María Valiente]] sincerely hoped for some sort of prudent partnership between Francoism and Carlism, Massó aimed at dismantling the regime from within. Moreover, while Valiente oriented himself towards the army and bureaucracy, the hugocarlistas approached the hardcore [[syndicalist]] Falange sector, likewise promoting new social order and disdainful towards greedy capitalism.

The collaborative approach appeared to work: in the early 1960s the Carlists were granted a few media and organizational concessions. The ''hugocarlistas'' benefited the most, opening a number of new periodicals turned into their ideological tribunes (mostly ''Azada y asta'' and ''Montejurra''), galvanizing the chain of [[Círculos Culturales Vázquez de Mella]] and launching their own workers' organization, [[Movimiento Obrero Tradicionalista|MOT]], all of them becoming later dissemination channels of their political vision.

==Protagonist Carlist==
[[File:Flag of Cross of Burgundy.svg|thumbnail|210px|left|the Carlist standard]]
As Carlos Hugo moved to Madrid he organized the young collaborators, dubbed ''camarilla'' and headed by Massó, into his [[Secretaría Politica (of Carlos Hugo)|Secretaría Política]]. The partnership of the old and the young leaders seemed smooth, though some of the former started suspecting the latter of dangerously Leftist ideas. Backed by the aging claimant the ''hugocarlistas'' assumed more powers as the newly established [[Junta de Gobierno (Carlist body)|Junta de Gobierno]] diluted the authority of Valiente. Massó outplayed the chief opponent, [[José Luis Zamanillo González-Camino|José Luis Zamanillo]], marginalized him in 1962–1963 and finally got him expelled early 1964. From this moment on the ''hugocarlistas'' spelled out their vision of Carlism more openly; the same year they published ''Esquema doctrinal'', a lecture which avoided open challenge to Francoism and presented a monarchist [[Corporativism|corporative]] political organization combined with [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] and [[Democracy|democratic]] principles. During the 1965 Montejurra the ''hugocarlistas'' voiced their praise of [[socialism]] and even [[Marxism]] at unprecedented levels.

It is not clear whether Massó intended to instaurate the Carlist dynasty by means of new social mobilization or he tried to promote profound transformation using Carlos Hugo as an agent of change; anyway, the two threads became intertwined. The immediate political objective of Massó was to prevent the Alfonsist restoration. The young Carlists dogged the ''juanista niño'', boycotting or jeering [[Juan Carlos]]; they publicly humiliated the royal prince and [[Sofia de Grecia|his wife]] a few times. At the same time, Massó engineered a campaign to promote Carlos Hugo across the country. The operation revealed much understanding of the media role in the [[consumer society]], as it exploited common [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] threads and kept feeding the press with new [[Scoop (term)|scoops]] (the prince as a miner in [[Asturias]], at a [[parachute]] course, at [[Sanfermines]]) and taking advantage of charm and youth of the prince's three sisters. The efforts proved fairly successful, as in the tightly [[Censorship|censured]] media the Borbon-Parmas gained sort of nationwide positive recognition.

The greatest scoop came in 1964, when Carlos Hugo married [[princess Irene of the Netherlands]]. At this point, however, the regime propaganda machine was firmly ordered to backtrack. Franco, though personally delighted that the [[House of Orange-Nassau|Dutch royal family]] (one of the harshest critics of his regime) was publicly humiliated by a Spanish royal hopeful, grew increasingly anxious that the popularity of Carlos Hugo might get him cornered when it comes to an inescapable dynastical decision. Despite wide TV coverage across Western Europe the Spanish media played down the event, which marked hard limits of Massó's strategy and got him bitterly disappointed.

In mid-1960s Massó realized that his strategy had failed; moreover, he realized that Leftist phraseology (with ''socialismo'' and ''autogestión'' most prominent catchwords) had divided and debilitated Carlism. In 1965 he loosened his ties with Carlos Hugo by moving from Madrid to [[Pamplona]], where he commenced teaching at the Opus Dei university. As opposition against his influence mounted from the orthodox [[Traditionalism (Spain)|Traditionalist]] camp of Valiente and from the militantly Leftist group of [[José María de Zavala y Castella|José de Zavala]], in 1966 Massó ceased as head of Secretaría Política; in 1967 he and some of his collaborators handed their resignations and withdrew from politics. He remained loosely related to Carlism, e.g. shortly before death taking part in historical conference,

==Media pundit and academic==
[[File:IESE Campus.jpg|thumbnail|left|IESE (contemporary view)]]
In late 1960s Massó settled in Pamplona, working as an academic teacher at [[IESE Business School|Instituto de Estudios Superiores de la Empresa]] (IESE), a prestigious business school founded by Opus Dei back in 1958. It was there that he completed the Alta Dirección curriculum himself, a holistic leadership program offered to top corporate managers. Finally disillusioned with Opus Dei and with its role during the process of installing Juan Carlos as the future king of Spain, Massó broke with the organization and moved to Barcelona. In his native city he joined [[Universidad Autónoma de Barcelona]] (UAB), where he became ''catedratico'' in Departamento de publicidad at the Facultad de Ciencias de la Información.
[[File:Biblioteca Comunicacio UAB.JPG|thumbnail|UAB library]]
Massó's small booklet ''Estrategia para unas extrañas elecciones'' (1977) earned him local media recognition  and triggered co-operation with ''[[La Vanguardia]]''; he became its key politics and public affairs commentator (until 1984). Massó experienced most of the Spanish [[Transition to democracy (Spain)|transition to democracy]] not as a protagonist but as a witness, periodically having a regular column in the Sunday issue. As a press pundit he was careful to remain within the limits of political science and styled himself as an unbiased scholarly observer, though his hostility to Francoism and support for reforms remained evident. In general opposed to [[sectarian]] politics, he occasionally kept referring to [[Lenin]] as a political authority. His commentary suggested also that Massó sort of put up with the royal function of Juan Carlos and with his role in the Spanish transition. In late 1970s together with his former Carlist collaborator [[José Antonio Parilla]] he engaged in the Nono Art publishing house and co-ordinated work on a popular series ''Breu História de Catalunya'' (1979–81).

==Communication expert==
[[File:Sede La Caixa.png|thumbnail|left|''la Caixa'' brand]]
In mid-1970s Massó co-founded Alas, one of the first media agencies in Spain and became head of its Barcelona branch. About the same time he launched the term "politing", intended as a merger of "politics" and "marketing" and meant as a specialized knowledge (if not a science itself) on the crossroads of [[social sciences]], [[public relations]] and [[politics]]. His work ''Introducción al “politing”. Lanzamiento de un aspirante'' (1976), apart from gaining official prizes (Premio Markedit, Premio Instituto Nacional de Publicidad), generated also significant interest among the academics, politicians and commentators.  The book was formatted as a systematic theoretical lecture on the basics of [[political marketing]], though it contained many explicit and implicit references to the 1957–1967 political experiences of the author. Relative success of launching Carlos Hugo became one of Masso's key credentials as a scholar in public relations and as a businessman running commercial (he claims authorship of [[La Caixa]] brand) and social (e.g. cancer awareness) media campaigns. He followed with another book, ''De la magia a la artesanía: el politing del cambio español''  (1980), becoming a nationwide recognised scholar and giving courses organised by [[Sociedad Española de Anunciantes]], I[[nstituto Nacional de Publicidad]] or [[Escuela Oficial de Radio y Television]].
[[File:Alblog5.png|thumbnail|communication model (sample)]]
In the 1990s Massó switched his focus to media with ''El exito de la cultura light: Anuncios y noticias'' (1993) and ''Noticias frente a hechos: Entender la realidad despues de leer los periodicos'' (1997). Later on he broadened his interest into the wider realm of public communication, focusing on combined multidimensional holistic forms and channels of information exchange named "integral communication". He co-founded the Barcelona-based [[Institut de Comunicació Integral]], an independent college specializing in [[marketing]], [[Brand|brand communications]] and [[public relations]], and became its president. ICOMI turned out to be a commercial (though not necessarily scientific) success and became a fashionable educational institute (incorporated into [[Abat Oliba CEU University|Universidad Abad Oliva CEU]] in 2003). During the last decade Massó published successive books on culture, communications and politics: ''Otro rey para España: crónica del lanzamiento y fracaso de Carlos Hugo'' (2004), ''Los últimos días de la Telecracia'' (with Enrique Nebot, 2009), ''Nacimiento y muerte de las marcas'' (with Joaquín García-Lavernia Gil, 2010), ''Navegando por el cachondeo de la historia'' (2012) and even a children's book, ''La segunda vida de Don Jos Kintana'' (1999). He maintaied [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]] accounts, scarcely active during last years of his life.

==Reception==
[[File:Formal dinner in honour of King Juan Carlos 2 (crop).jpg|thumbnail|180px|left|Juan Carlos de Borbón]]
In the 1990s, looking back on his political past, Massó admitted defeat at the hands of a competitive group of [[Machiavellian]] players coming from the same Opus Dei hotbed (especially [[Laureano López Rodó|López Rodó]]), who outplayed him by dismantling Francoism with technocratic strategy and with Juan Carlos as a better marketed and better designed version of Carlos Hugo. He denied charges that he had implanted Marxism within the Carlist realm; he rather pointed to the Juan Vázquez de Mella heritage, based on ''sociedalismo'' and the concept of [[:es:Democracia orgánica|organic society]].
 
In historiography Massó remains a rather divisive and ambiguous figure, with little agreement as to his role and intentions. Some historians (Payne, Bartyzel) maintain that he unleashed forces which either destroyed Carlism or turned it into its own [[antinomy]]. Some historians (Clemente, Martorell Pérez) claim that he helped to safeguard Carlist identity or at least contributed to emphasizing genuine Carlism and sidetracking its accidental threads.  Some historians (MacClancy, Caspistegui Gorasurreta) suggest that he commenced the process of redirecting Carlism from traditional and orthodox path to a new formula. Some historians (Perez-Nievas) do not consider Massó worth mentioning and present de Zavala as the leader of the group.

According to one group of studies (Martorell Pérez, MacClancy) Massó was primarily motivated by dynastical objectives, according to another (Clemente) he was not a monarchist at all. There are scholars (Bartyzel) who consider him a radical Leftist approximate to Marxism, there are others (Clemente) who consider him a "neocapitalist technocrat". Certain works (Martorell Pérez, in line with Masso's own later narration) present Carlos Hugo as a politician invented and created by Massó, certain works (Clemente) present Massó as Carlos Hugo's sidekick, useful at one political phase and to be replaced at the following one. Massó's departure from politics is explained by failure of his policy (Martorell Pérez), by Carlos Hugo's decision to replace him (Clemente), by his alleged falling in love with one of Carlos Hugo's sisters (Fraga), by pressure from Opus Dei (Lavardín), by combined efforts of enemies from the Right like Valiente and from the Left like de Zavala (Pérez Madrigal) or by pure greed (Zabala).
[[File:Carlism, Concepts, Context and Time.jpg|thumbnail|Carlist concepts over time]]
One thing most historians agree on is that Massó proved instrumental in dismantling Traditionalist Carlism (though they do not agree whether a non-Traditionalist Carlism can actually exist). None of the currently operating Carlist grouplets admits deference to Massó. Traditionalists ([[Carloctavismo|carloctavistas]], [[Prince Sixtus Henry of Bourbon-Parma|sixtinos]], [[:es:Comunión Tradicionalista Carlista|CTC]]) tend to view him as a turncoat, the progressives ([[Carlist Party (1970)|Partido Carlista]], [[Carlos, Duke of Parma|javierocarlistas]]) tend to view him as merely a former [[:ru:Попутчик (жаргон)|fellow-traveller]].

Before death he dedicated his future corpse to scientific research, and hence there was no funeral arranged and there is no grave. His death was acknowledged on few websites related to Partido Carlista, though not by major Spanish media.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5036">'''Royal Secretary''' is a position at the [[Court (royal)|court]] of a [[monarch]] generally responsible for communicating the sovereign's wishes to the other members of government. At times and places it may have a number of other duties. In most cases the royal secretary is a close adviser of the monarch. In some cases the office of Royal Secretary evolved into the Secretary of State.

==Biblical==
In the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]] the royal secretary had both the duties of private secretary to the king and secretary of state.&lt;ref name="De Vaux"&gt;De Vaux, Roland (1997) "Royal Secretary" ''Ancient Israel: its life and institutions'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=A42yVk8kj8kC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;lpg=PA131 pages 131-132]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the royal secretary exercised some fiscal duties.&lt;ref name="De Vaux" /&gt;

==Great Britain==
Currently the royal secretary of [[Great Britain]] is denominated [[Private Secretary to the Sovereign]] and has been since 1805.

==Korea==
[[Seungjeongwon]] was the Royal Secretariat during the Joseon Dynasty of Korea (1392 &amp;ndash; 1910).&lt;ref&gt;Sin, Myŏng-ho (2004) ''Joseon Royal Court culture: ceremonial and daily life'' Dolbegae Publications, Seoul, Korea, page 276, {{ISBN|89-7199-187-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poland==
Originally of the office of royal secretary in Poland was the secretary protonotarius (or royal notary).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slownik-online.pl/kopalinski/D46046FFD7CEB3BCC125658100575054.php "protonotariusz"] Slownik online (Online Dictionary) in Polish&lt;/ref&gt; It was under this name that the office operated under [[Władysław II Jagiełło]] from 1387 to 1423. Under the [[Jagiellon dynasty]] the royal secretaries were responsible for arranging the royal correspondence, representing the king at the regional sejms, arranging all kinds of cases most often financial, diplomatic correspondence, and editing the most important public documents.  They also kept deputations entertained and resolved disputes between courtiers. The [[Royal elections in Poland|elected kings]] maintained the tradition and the royal secretary often had a great deal of power.&lt;ref&gt;Walewskiego, Antoniego (1868) ''Historya Wyzwolenia Polski za panowania Jana Kazmierza (1655-1660), Tom.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10778">In the field of [[computer security]], '''security information and event management''' ('''SIEM''') software products and services combine [[security information management]] (SIM) and [[security event manager|security event management]] (SEM). They provide real-time analysis of security alerts generated by applications and network hardware.

Vendors sell SIEM as software, as appliances or as managed services; these products are also used to log security data and generate reports for [[regulatory compliance|compliance]] purposes.&lt;ref name="drdobbs2007"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.drdobbs.com/197002909 |title= SIEM: A Market Snapshot |date= 5 February 2007 |publisher= Dr.Dobb's Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The acronyms ''SEM'', ''SIM'' and ''SIEM'' have been sometimes used interchangeably.&lt;ref name=Generic&gt;{{cite web|last= Swift|first= David|title= A Practical Application of SIM/SEM/SIEM, Automating Threat Identification|url= http://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/logging/practical-application-sim-sem-siem-automating-threat-identification-1781|work= SANS Institute|accessdate= 14 May 2014|page= 3|format= PDF|date= 26 December 2006|quote= ...the acronym SIEM will be used generically to refer...}}&lt;/ref&gt; The segment of security management that deals with real-time monitoring, correlation of events, notifications and console views is known as ''security event management'' (SEM). The second area provides long-term storage as well as analysis, manipulation and reporting of log data and security records of the type collated by SEM software, and is known as ''security information management'' (SIM).&lt;ref name="r1"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.gmdit.com/NewsView.aspx?ID=9IfB2Axzeew= |title= The difference between SEM, SIM and SIEM|date= 29 March 2010 |author= Jamil, Amir}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with many meanings and definitions of capabilities, evolving requirements continually shape derivatives of SIEM product-categories. Organizations are turning to [[big data]] platforms, such as [[Apache Hadoop]], to complement SIEM capabilities by extending [[Computer data storage|data storage]] capacity and [[analytics|analytic]] flexibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cloudera.com/solutions/cybersecurity.html|title=Cybersecurity at petabyte scale|website=Cloudera|language=en-us|access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vision.cloudera.com/cybersecurity-and-the-big-yellow-elephant/?_ga=1.226365786.1594023217.1456770249|title=Cybersecurity and the Big Yellow Elephant|last=Hayes|first=Justin|date=6 May 2015|website=Cloudera Vision Blog|publisher=|access-date=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The need for voice-centric visibility or vSIEM (voice security information and event management) provides a recent example of this evolution.

* '''Data aggregation:''' [[Log management]] aggregates data from many sources, including network, security, servers, databases, applications, providing the ability to consolidate monitored data to help avoid missing crucial events.
* '''Correlation:''' Looks for common attributes, and links events together into meaningful bundles. This technology provides the ability to perform a variety of correlation techniques to integrate different sources, in order to turn data into useful information. Correlation is typically a function of the Security Event Management portion of a full SIEM solution&lt;ref&gt;[http://securityinformationeventmanagement.com/security-event-management.php Correlation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019131638/http://securityinformationeventmanagement.com/security-event-management.php |date=2014-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Alerting:''' The automated analysis of correlated events and production of alerts, to notify recipients of immediate issues.  Alerting can be to a dashboard, or sent via third party channels such as email.
* '''Dashboards:''' Tools can take event data and turn it into informational charts to assist in seeing patterns, or identifying activity that is not forming a standard pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://securosis.com/blog/understanding-and-selecting-siem-lm-use-cases-part-1|title=Securosis - Blog - Understanding and Selecting SIEM/LM: Use Cases, Part 1|last=Lane|first=Rich Mogull, Mike Rothman, Adrian|website=securosis.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Compliance:''' Applications can be employed to automate the gathering of compliance data, producing reports that adapt to existing security, governance and auditing processes.&lt;ref name="accelops.net"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.accelops.net/blog/?p=149|title=Compliance Management and Compliance Automation – How and How Efficient, Part 1|last=|first=|date=|website=accelops.net|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723002943/http://www.accelops.net/blog/?p=149|archive-date=2011-07-23|dead-url=yes|access-date=2018-05-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Retention:''' Employing long-term storage of historical data to facilitate correlation of data over time, and to provide the retention necessary for compliance requirements.  Long term log [[data retention]] is critical in forensic investigations as it is unlikely that discovery of a network breach will be at the time of the breach occurring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.verizonbusiness.com/about/events/2012dbir/|title=2018 Data Breach Investigations Report  {{!}} Verizon Enterprise Solutions|website=Verizon Enterprise Solutions|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Forensic analysis:''' The ability to search across logs on different nodes and time periods based on specific criteria. This mitigates having to aggregate log information in your head or having to search through thousands and thousands of logs.&lt;ref name="accelops.net"/&gt;

== Usage cases ==
Computer security researcher [[Chris Kubecka]] identified the following SIEM use cases, presented at the hacking conference 28C3 ([[Chaos Communication Congress]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4pF9VUdphc&amp;feature=youtu.be|title=28c3: Security Log Visualization with a Correlation Engine|date= December 29, 2011|accessdate= November 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* SIEM visibility and anomaly detection could help detect [[Zero-day (computing)|zero-days]] or [[Computer virus#Polymorphic code|polymorphic code]]. Primarily due to low rates of [[anti-virus]] detection against this type of rapidly changing malware.
* Parsing, log normalization and categorization can occur automatically, regardless of the type of computer or network device, as long as it can send a log.
* Visualization with a SIEM using security events and log failures can aid in pattern detection.
* Protocol anomalies which can indicate a mis-configuration or a security issue can be identified with a SIEM using pattern detection, alerting, baseline and dashboards.
* SIEMS can detect covert, malicious communications and encrypted channels. 
* [[Cyberwarfare]] can be detected by SIEMs with accuracy, discovering both attackers and victims.

== Alerting examples ==
David Swift of the SANS Institute wrote about activities that can be monitored and customized rules that can be created for event correlation to trigger alerts based on certain conditions from various log sources such as network devices, security devices, servers and antivirus. Some examples of customized rules to alert on event conditions involve user authentication rules, attacks detected and infections detected. Thresholds can be configured to trigger alerts based on the quantity of occurrences of events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/auditing/successful-siem-log-management-strategies-audit-compliance-33528|title=Successful SIEM and Log Management Strategies for Audit and Compliance|last=Swift|first=David|date=2010|website=SANS Institute|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sodium lactate''' is the [[sodium]] [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] of [[lactic acid]], and has a mild saline taste. It is produced by fermentation of a sugar source, such as [[corn]] or [[beets]], and then, by neutralizing the resulting lactic acid&lt;ref name="Silberberg"&gt;{{cite book|last=Silberberg|first=Barrie|title=The Autism and ADHD Diet: A Step-by-Step Guide to Hope and Healing by Living Gluten Free and Casein Free (GFCF) and Other Interventions|publisher=Sourcebooks, Inc.|year=2009|page=119|isbn=1-4022-1845-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; to create a [[Compound (chemistry)|compound]] having the formula NaC&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

== Usage ==
As a [[food additive]], sodium lactate has the [[E number]] E325 and is naturally a liquid product, but also is available in powder form. It acts as a [[preservative]], [[acidity regulator]], and bulking agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dh.sa.gov.au/pehs/food/additive-code-numbers-nov06.pdf | title = Food Additive Code Numbers | author =  | date = August 2006 | accessdate = 2012-08-16 | publisher = [[Government of South Australia#Department for Health and Ageing (SA Health)|South Australian Department of Health]] | work =  | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090521122611/http://www.dh.sa.gov.au/pehs/Food/additive-code-numbers-nov06.pdf | archivedate = 2009-05-21 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sodium lactate is sometimes used in [[shampoo]] products and other similar items such as liquid soaps, as it is an effective [[humectant]] and [[moisturizer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=US |number=4758599 |status=Patent |title = Clear, hydroalcoholic aftershave lotion which moisturizes, conditions, and prevents irritation |gdate=1988-07-19 |fdate=1988-06-04| invent1= Dawn C. Minetti}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sodium lactate is used to treat arrhythmias caused by overdosing of [[Antiarrhythmic agent#Class I agents|class I antiarrythmics]], as well as pressor [[sympathomimetics]] which can cause [[hypertension]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Trevor|first=Anthony|author2=Bertram Katzung |author3=Susan Masters |title=Katzung &amp; Trevor's Pharmacology Examination and Board Review|publisher=Go Dairy Free|year=2008|edition=8e|page=126|isbn=0-07-148869-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also can be given [[intravenously]] as a source of [[bicarbonate]] for preventing or controlling mild to moderate [[metabolic acidosis]] in patients with restricted oral intake (for sodium bicarbonate) whose oxidative processes are not seriously impaired. However, the use in [[lactic acidosis]] is [[contraindicated]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/archives/fdaDrugInfo.cfm?archiveid=2425 | title = Sodium Lactate (sodium lactate)  Injection, Solution, Concentrate  | author = Hospira, Inc. |date=November 2004 | accessdate = 2012-08-16 | publisher = U.S. [[National Library of Medicine]] | work = [[DailyMed]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can [[Anxiogenic|cause panic attacks]] in patients with existing [[panic disorder]].&lt;ref name="HollanderSimeon2003"&gt;{{cite book | author1 = Eric Hollander | author2 = Daphne Simeon | title = Concise Guide to Anxiety Disorders | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qlXxu9D39xcC&amp;pg=RA1-PA83 | accessdate = 13 May 2012 | year = 2003 | publisher = American Psychiatric Pub | isbn = 978-1-58562-080-7 | page = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regarding milk ==
Despite the similarity in name, sodium lactate is not chemically similar to [[lactose]] (milk sugar), so need not be restricted by those with [[lactose intolerance]].&lt;ref name="Silberberg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Willitts"&gt;{{cite book|last=Willitts|first=Alice|author2=Deborah Carter |title=Food allergy &amp; your child|publisher=Class Publishing Ltd|year=2007|page=85|isbn=1-85959-186-8|quote=The following ingredients do not contain milk protein and need not be avoided by people allergic to milk: … Sodium lactate}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, lactates such as sodium, [[calcium lactate|calcium]], and [[potassium lactate|potassium]] lactate are salts derived from the neutralization of lactic acid and most commercially used lactic acids are fermented from dairy-free products such as [[cornstarch]], [[potato]]es, or [[molasses]].&lt;ref name="Fleming"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fleming|first=Alisa Marie|title=Go Dairy Free: The Guide and Cookbook for Milk Allergies, Lactose Intolerance, and Casein-free Living|publisher=Go Dairy Free|year=2008|page=90|isbn=0-9791286-2-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sugar]] or [[tapioca]] additionally may be used. In some rare instances, some lactic acid is fermented from dairy products such as [[whey]]&lt;ref name="Silberberg" /&gt; and [[lactose]].&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt; Whey is made of up 6.5% solids of which 4.8% is solid lactose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ranken|first=M. D.|author2=R. C. Kill |title=Food industries manual|publisher=Springer|year=1997|page=125|isbn=0-7514-0404-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waste whey is infrequently used to produce lactic acid when the whey itself is produced as waste during the manufacture of certain dairy products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Inamdar|first=|title=Biochemical Engineering: Principles And Concepts|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd.|year=2009|page=254|isbn=81-203-3677-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such dairy-type lactic acid generally goes back into dairy products, such as [[ice cream]] and [[cream cheese]],&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt; rather than into nondairy products. Moreover, although the lactic-acid starter culture to ferment corn or beets may contain milk,&lt;ref name="Silberberg" /&gt; sodium lactate does not contain milk protein and need not be restricted by someone avoiding milk or those with a milk allergy.&lt;ref name="Silberberg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Willitts" /&gt;

'''Soviet deportations from Lithuania''' were a series of 35&lt;ref&gt;Tininis (2003), p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; mass [[deportation]]s carried out in [[Lithuania]], a country that was occupied as a [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic|constituent socialist republic]] of the [[Soviet Union]], in 1941 and 1945–1952. At least 130,000 people, 70% of them women and children,&lt;ref&gt;Anušauskas  (2005), p. 302&lt;/ref&gt; were forcibly transported to labor camps and other [[Forced settlements in the Soviet Union|forced settlements]] in remote parts of the Soviet Union, particularly in the [[Irkutsk Oblast]] and [[Krasnoyarsk Krai]]. Among the deportees were about 4,500 Poles.&lt;ref&gt;Stravinskienė (2012), p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; These deportations do not include [[Lithuanian partisans]] or political prisoners (approximately 150,000 people) deported to [[Gulag]]s (prison camps).&lt;ref&gt;Anušauskas (2005), p. 289&lt;/ref&gt; Deportations of the civilians served a double purpose: repressing resistance to [[Sovietization]] policies in Lithuania and providing free labor in sparsely inhabited areas of the Soviet Union. Approximately 28,000 of Lithuanian deportees died in exile due to poor living conditions. After Stalin's death in 1953, the deportees were slowly and gradually released. The last deportees were released only in 1963. Some 60,000 managed to return to Lithuania, while 30,000 were prohibited from settling back in their homeland. Similar deportations took place in Latvia, Estonia, and other parts of the Soviet Union (see [[Soviet deportations from Estonia]] and [[population transfer in the Soviet Union]]). Lithuania observes the annual Mourning and Hope Day on June 14 in memory of those deported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=[[Baltic News Service|BNS]] |url=http://www.15min.lt/en/article/in-lithuania/lithuania-marks-mourning-and-hope-day-commemorating-soviet-mass-deportations-525-226278 |title=Lithuania marks Mourning and Hope Day commemorating Soviet mass deportations |publisher=[[15 min]] |date=2012-06-14 |accessdate=2014-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical background==
{{main|Occupation of the Baltic states|Sovietization of the Baltic states}}
In August 1939, Nazi Germany and Soviet Union signed the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] whereby dividing Eastern Europe into [[spheres of influence]]. The [[Baltic states]] (Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia) became part of the Russian sphere. The Soviet Union began preparations for the occupation and incorporation of these territories. First, it imposed mutual assistance treaties by which the Baltic states agreed to allow military bases for Soviet soldiers within their territory. Further steps were delayed by [[Winter War]] with Finland. By spring 1940, the war was over and Soviet Union increased its rhetoric accusing the Baltics of anti-Soviet conspiracy. Lithuania [[1940 Soviet ultimatum to Lithuania|received Soviet ultimatum]] on June 14, 1940. Almost identical ultimatums to Latvia and Estonia followed two days later. Soviet Union demanded to allow an unlimited number of Soviet troops to enter the state territory and to form a more pro-Soviet government. The Soviets followed semi-constitutional procedures while forcibly transforming the independent Baltic states into the [[soviet socialist republic]]s. They formed pro-Soviet People's Governments and held [[show election]]s to [[People's Parliament]]s. The annexation of the [[Lithuanian SSR]], [[Latvian SSR]], and [[Estonian SSR]] was completed by August 6, 1940.

The Soviets took control of political, economic, and cultural life in the three states. They rapidly implemented various [[sovietization]] policies: [[nationalization]] of private enterprises, land reform in preparation for [[collectivization]], suppression of political, cultural, and religious organizations. Economic life was disrupted and standard of living decreased. Political activists and other people labeled as "[[enemy of the people]]" were arrested and imprisoned. In June 1941, some 17,000 Lithuanians were deported during the [[June deportation|first deportation]]. Further repressions were prevented by [[Operation Barbarossa|Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union]]. Within a week [[Occupation of Lithuania by Nazi Germany|Lithuania was under Nazi regime]]. At first the Germans were greeted as liberators from the oppressive Soviet rule. Even when the Lithuanians became disillusioned with the Nazi regime and organized resistance, notably the [[Supreme Committee for the Liberation of Lithuania]], the Soviet Union remained "Public Enemy Number One."

In 1944, Nazi Germany was losing the war and Soviet Russia was making steady advances. In July 1944, [[Red Army]] reached the Lithuanian borders as part of the [[Operation Bagration]]. Most of the Lithuanian territory was taken during the [[Baltic Offensive (1944)|Baltic Offensive]]. The last [[Battle of Memel|battle in Klaipėda]] ended in January 1945. Anticipating return of the Soviet terror, some 70,000{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} Lithuanians retreated into Germany ahead of the advancing Red Army. Generally those were political and cultural activists, artists and scientists, better educated and wealthier. Spending the first post-war years as [[displaced person]]s, they eventually settled in other countries, most often United States, forming culturally active Lithuanian diaspora. Those who remained in Lithuania were drafted into the army (some 80,000 soldiers). Men escaped the draft by joining the [[Lithuanian partisans]], armed anti-Soviet resistance. Armed resistance inspired civil and political disobedience, to which the Soviets responded with persecutions: massacres, executions, arrests, deportations, etc.

==Deportation procedures==
[[File:N. Vilnia, paminklas tremtiniams.JPG|thumb|Monument to the deportees in [[Naujoji Vilnia]] – the last major train stop in Lithuania]]

Extra soldiers, equipment, and vehicles would be brought in to carry out the deportation. However, the deportations were kept strictly secret. There was a single public order by [[Juozas Bartašiūnas]] in February 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Anušauskas (1996), p. 317&lt;/ref&gt; Armed groups of soldiers would surround a targeted house in the middle of the night. At night it was more likely to find everyone at home and easier to keep the operation quiet without alarming other residents. Everyone inside, including newborns and the elderly, would be ordered to pack food and other necessities (the exact list of what should or could be taken varied between deportations and depended on the generosity of the soldiers). If someone attempted to resist or run away, they would be shot or beaten. Often families would be separated and there were cases when parents, children, or spouses voluntarily reported to the train station to be deported with their captured relatives.&lt;ref&gt;Anušauskas (1996), p. 322&lt;/ref&gt; The trains often used [[cattle cars]] with no amenities. The journey often lasted weeks if not months. The conditions were unsanitary, passengers often lacked food and water. Often trains would report deaths, especially among children and elderly, before reaching the destination.&lt;ref name=a323&gt;Anušauskas (1996), p. 323&lt;/ref&gt; In one case, a train with deportees derailed killing 19 and injuring 57 people.&lt;ref&gt;Anušauskas (1996), p. 324&lt;/ref&gt; While official instructions (for example [[Serov Instructions]] of 1941) often prescribed mild treatment of the deportees, in reality the captured people were subject to abuse and robbed of the few things that they were allowed to pack.&lt;ref name=a323/&gt;&lt;!--Division of left property.--&gt;

The first mass deportation was carefully planned by the Soviets. Already in late summer 1940, high-ranking Soviet officials began hinting at planned mass arrests and deportations.&lt;ref&gt;Anušauskas (1996), p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; [[NKVD]] began registering and tracking all "anti-Soviet elements", i.e. people who were judged to be harboring anti-Soviet attitudes solely based on their social standing, political affiliations, religious beliefs, etc. In particular, it targeted policemen, members of the [[Lithuanian Nationalist Union]], [[Lithuanian Riflemen's Union]], various Catholic organizations. In total, NKVD estimated that it needed to register 320,000 people or about 15% of the Lithuanian population,&lt;ref&gt;Anušauskas (1996), pp. 44–45&lt;/ref&gt; which with family members constituted about half of the population.&lt;ref&gt;Anušauskas (1996), p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for the deportation, NKVD drafted lists of people that would be deported during the first campaign, identified their incriminating background, traced their family members, and located their current residence. The list was fluid and kept changing. For example, a report dated May 13, 1941 identified 19,610 people that should be arrested and deported to prison camps and 2,954 people (mostly family members of those arrested) that should be deported to work camps.&lt;ref&gt;Anušauskas (1996), pp. 83–89&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, the numbers changed to 8,598 arrested and 13,654 deported family members clearly indicating a policy of eliminating entire anti-Soviet families.&lt;ref&gt;Anušauskas (1996), pp. 89–91&lt;/ref&gt;

The operation began during the Friday night of June 13 and was carried out by [[NKVD]] and [[NKGB]] troops from Russia, Ukraine, Belarus.&lt;ref&gt;Anušauskas (1996), p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ivan Serov]] issued instructions, known as [[Serov Instructions]], detailing how the deportees should be detained and transported to the trains. The instructions emphasized that the deportations should be carried out as stealthily as possible to minimize panic and resistance. Each four-member executive group was given the task of deporting two families.&lt;ref&gt;Anušauskas (1996), p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; According to the official instructions, each family could take up to {{convert|100|kg}} of food, clothes, shoes, and other necessities but witnesses testified that these instructions were often not followed. Many families left unprepared for the journey or the life at the destination.&lt;ref&gt;Anušauskas (1996), pp. 95–96&lt;/ref&gt; According to the official instructions, signed by [[Mečislovas Gedvilas]] and [[Icikas Meskupas]], property left by the deportees was to be divided into personal property (clothes, linens, furniture, tableware) and other (art, investments, trade inventory, real estate, farm animals, agricultural tools and machinery). Personal property was to be transferred to a representative of the deportee who would sell the property and would transfer the money to the original owners. Other property was to be confiscated and either sold or used by local Soviet officials.&lt;ref&gt;Anušauskas (1996), p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; These instructions were not followed and people reported widespread looting of the left property.&lt;ref name=a99&gt;Anušauskas (1996), p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

The deportations continued, but on June 16 it was counted that the Soviets were still missing about 1,400 people from their list.&lt;ref name=a99/&gt; Needing to meet their quotas, Soviet officials hurriedly arrested another 2,000 people on June 16–18. The trains with deportees gathered in [[Naujoji Vilnia]] where men (using various excuses of needing additional inspection, questioning, or paperwork) were separated from their families and loaded onto trains heading towards prison camps.&lt;ref&gt;Anušauskas (1996), p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; In total, there were 17 trains; they moved out on June 19 and reached their destinations between June 30 and July 9.&lt;ref&gt;Anušauskas (1996), p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; An official NKVD report, prepared on June 19, accounted for 17,485 deportees, but the official statistics was incomplete and confused.&lt;ref&gt;Anušauskas (1996), pp. 101–104&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Genocide and Resistance Research Centre of Lithuania]] has traced and published the fate of 16,246 deportees.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.komisija.lt/Files/www.komisija.lt/File/Tyrimu_baze/I%20Soviet%20okupac%20Nusikalt%20aneksav/Tremimai/A_Anusauskas_1941%20tremimai%20_patvirtintos%20isvados_.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===First post-war deportations===
[[File:Lithuanian deportees in Mezhduganki, Irkutsk.jpg|thumb|A group of Lithuanian deportees in [[Ziminsky District]], [[Irkutsk Oblast]]]]
By 1944, Nazi Germany was retreating along the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] and Soviet forces reached the territory of Lithuania by mid-1944. In October 1944, Soviet officials, including [[Sergei Kruglov (politician)|Sergei Kruglov]] who had experience [[Operation Lentil (Caucasus)|deporting the Chechen and Ingush people]], began circulating ideas about deporting families of "bandits" – men who avoided conscription into the [[Red Army]] and joined the [[Lithuanian partisans]].&lt;ref&gt;Anušauskas (2005), pp. 292–293&lt;/ref&gt; However, such measures were not practical at the time of war. Instead, preparations were made to deport any Lithuanian Germans, their families, and more distant relatives. The train with 1,000 people left [[Kaunas]] on May 3 and arrived at its destination only in June.&lt;ref&gt;Anušauskas (2005), p. 293&lt;/ref&gt; The deportees provided free labor to cotton plantations in the valley of the [[Vakhsh River]].&lt;ref&gt;Anušauskas (2005), p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; Due to particularly poor living conditions, about 580 deportees died in the first two years.&lt;ref&gt;Anušauskas (1996), p. 382&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II ended, [[Mikhail Suslov]], chairman of the Bureau for Lithuanian Affairs of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], approved a decision to deport 50–60 families from [[Administrative divisions of Lithuania|each county]]. [[Lavrentiy Beria]] approved the plan and sent [[Bogdan Zaharovich Kobulov]] and [[Arkady Apollonov]] to assist.&lt;ref name="Anušauskas 1996, p. 313"&gt;Anušauskas (1996), p. 313&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign targeted Lithuanian families of the "bandits" and was coordinated with a "legalization" offer to the partisans: if they surrendered, their families would be unharmed. However, such promises were not kept and lists of legalized partisans were used as basis for the deportee lists.&lt;ref&gt;Kasparas (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Over 6,000 people were deported over the course of a month and a half. Most of those families had already their property confiscated,&lt;ref&gt;Anušauskas (2005), p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; therefore official Soviet instructions that a family could take up to {{convert|1500|kg}} of property were often useless.&lt;ref&gt;Anušauskas (1996), p. 315&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to NKVD troops, [[destruction battalion]]s were used for auxiliary duties.&lt;ref name="Anušauskas 1996, p. 313"/&gt;

From 1946 to early 1948, the civilian deportations were relatively small. The main method of oppression were individual arrests of "[[enemies of the people]]" and subsequent mass deportations of the prisoners. The deportations targeted Lithuanian partisans and their supported, but also included [[kulaks]] ({{lang-lt|buožė}}) and [[bourgeoisie]].&lt;ref&gt;Anušauskas (2005), pp. 296–297&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operations ''Vesna'' and ''Priboi''===

Two largest deportations were carried out in May 1948 (code name ''Vesna'' – spring) and in March 1949 (code name ''Priboi'' – coastal surf) when some 70,000 people were deported. The deportations were ordered by the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Anušauskas (1996), p. 319&lt;/ref&gt; Operation ''Priboi'' was carried out simultaneously in the [[Lithuanian SSR]], [[Latvian SSR]], and [[Estonian SSR]]. Operation ''Vesna'' affected only Lithuania (possibly because resistance movement was the strongest in Lithuania). Officially, this new wave of terror continued to target families and supporters of the resistance fighters. However, it was intended to break the resistance to [[collectivization]], which required that peasants contribute their land, livestock, and farming equipment to a [[kolkhoz]] (collective farm). The farmer would then work for the collective farm and be paid a share of the farm's product and profit according to the number of workdays. Very few farmers joined the process voluntarily as it would mean abandoning private ownership for a system often compared to [[serfdom]].&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick (1996), p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

As people had witnessed previous deportations and knew the warning signs (e.g. the arrival of fresh troops and transport vehicles), many residents attempted to hide. In Lithuania, according to official Soviet records, some 13,700 avoided capture.&lt;ref&gt;Anušauskas (1996), p. 325&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the authorities organized a follow-up deportation in April 1949. Some 3,000 people were found. They were labeled as especially dangerous, treated as prisoners, and sent to gold mines in [[Bodaybo]].&lt;ref&gt;Anušauskas  (2005), p. 300&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation ''Osen'' and last deportations===
{{main|Operation Osen}}
It seemed that the 1947–1948 deportations achieved their goals: 1949 saw a flurry of collectivization and further weakening of the armed resistance. However, the pace of collectivization in Lithuania was still not as rapid as in Latvia or Estonia, where 93% and 80% of the farms were collectivized by the end of 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Misiunas (1993), p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, an additional large-scale deportation took place in October 1951 (code name ''Osen'' – autumn). It specifically targeted kulaks and those who did not join the collective farms.&lt;ref&gt;Anušauskas (1996), p. 326&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life in exile==

===Living conditions===
The living conditions varied greatly and depended on the geographic location of the forced settlement, local conditions, and type of work performed by the deportees. Even official reports acknowledged lack of suitable housing; for example, a report from [[Igarka]] described barracks with leaky roofs and without windows, beds, or bedding.&lt;ref&gt;Anušauskas  (1996), p. 388&lt;/ref&gt; Majority of the Lithuanian deportees were employed by the logging and timber industry.&lt;ref&gt;Anušauskas  (1996), p. 386&lt;/ref&gt; The deportees could not leave the location of their settlement or change work; their deportations had no expiration date and were for their lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Anušauskas  (2002), p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Those who attempted escape or "avoid work" were sent to prison camps. Between 1945 and 1948, 1722 Lithuanians attempted to escape; 1070 were caught by 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Bugaĭ (1996), p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, stricter regulations adopted by the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]] allotted 20 years in prison for those who escaped and 5 years for those aiding the fugitives.&lt;ref&gt;Pohl (1999), p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; Children born in exile were classified as deportees and were subject to the same treatment as their parents, with some exceptions for mixed (deportee and non-deportee) families.&lt;ref&gt;Anušauskas  (1996), p. 385&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to poor living conditions, demanding physical labor, lack of food and medical care, the [[mortality rate]]s were high, especially among the young and the elderly. Based on the incomplete and inaccurate records kept by MVD and MGB, Arvydas Anušauskas estimated that some 16,500 and 3,500 Lithuanians died in 1945–1952 and 1953–1958 respectively;&lt;ref name=a391&gt;Anušauskas  (1996), p. 391&lt;/ref&gt; this number does not include 8,000 deaths among the deportees of 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Anušauskas  (2002), p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Thus total Lithuanian deaths could be around 28,000. Children accounted for about a quarter of the total casualties.&lt;ref name=a391/&gt;

Stalin's death in 1953 was followed by the [[Khrushchev Thaw]] and a [[de-Stalinization]] campaign, which included gradual release of the deportees and prisoners. In July 1954, deportee children under 16 were removed from the deportee list and the sentence for escape was reduced from 20 to 3 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;Anušauskas  (1996), pp. 392–393&lt;/ref&gt; The release of the Lithuanians was slow. When in 1954 an amnesty was announced for people older than 55–60, disabled, or incurably ill, a special provision excluded the Lithuanians or members of the [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists]] due to matters of "public security."&lt;ref&gt;Anušauskas  (1996), p. 393&lt;/ref&gt; In Lithuania, the deportee files were slowly reviewed on case-by-case basis by the [[Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR]]. Soviet [[apparatchik]]s regarded the deportees as a threat, especially when they wanted to claim their property confiscated at the time of the deportation. The Lithuanians approved releases only in limited circumstances if they found some irregularities or violations.&lt;ref&gt;Anušauskas  (1996), pp. 393–394&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956 and 1957, the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]] approved releases of larger groups of the deportees, including the Lithuanians. Deportees started returning in large numbers creating difficulties for local communists – deportees would petition for return of their confiscated property, were generally considered unreliable and required special surveillance. Soviet Lithuanian officials, including [[Antanas Sniečkus]], drafted local administrative measures prohibiting deportee return and petitioned Moscow to enact national policies to that effect.&lt;ref&gt;Anušauskas  (2005), p. 415&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1958, the Soviet Union revised its policy regarding the remaining deportees: all those who were not involved with the Lithuanian partisans were released, but without the right to return to Lithuania.&lt;ref&gt;Anušauskas  (1996), p. 396&lt;/ref&gt; The last Lithuanians—the partisan relatives and the partisans—were released only in 1960 and 1963 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Anušauskas  (2005), pp. 417–418&lt;/ref&gt; Majority of the deportees released in May 1958 and later never returned to Lithuania.&lt;ref&gt;Anušauskas  (1996), pp. 397–398&lt;/ref&gt;

About 60,000 deportees returned to Lithuania.&lt;ref&gt;Anušauskas  (2005), p. 418&lt;/ref&gt; However, they faced further difficulties: their property was long looted and divided up by strangers, they faced discrimination for jobs and social guarantees, their children were denied higher education. Former deportees, resistance members, and their children were not allowed to integrate into the society. That created a permanent group of people that opposed the regime and continued non-violent resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Vardys (1997), p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact and evaluations==
Deportations of civilian population without warning, trial, or apparent cause were one of the most serious grievances against the Soviet regime. When, during [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]]-introduced ''[[glastnost]]'', Lithuanians were allowed a greater freedom of speech, honoring the memory of the deportees was one of their first demands. Such demands were raised during the first public anti-Soviet rally organized by the [[Lithuanian Liberty League]] on August 23, 1987.

Some Lithuanians believe that the deportees should be paid a compensation for their slave labor in a similar fashion as Germany paid [[Foundation "Remembrance, Responsibility and Future"|compensation to forced laborers]] in [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Vardys (1997), p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''States of Friesland''' were the sovereign body that governed the province of [[Friesland]] under the [[Dutch Republic]]. They were formed in 1580 after the former [[Lordship of Frisia]] (a part of the [[Habsburg Netherlands]]) acceded to the [[Union of Utrecht]] and became one of the Seven United Netherlands. The Frisian [[stadtholder]] was their "First Servant" (mostly in military matters, as he had few other powers before 1748, when the Government Regulations for Friesland were promulgated by then-stadtholder [[William IV, Prince of Orange]]). The board of ''Gedeputeerde Staten'' (Delegated States) was the executive of the province when the States were not in session (which was most of the time). The States of Friesland were abolished after the [[Batavian Revolution]] of 1795, when the [[Batavian Republic]] was founded. They were resurrected in name (but not in substance) in the form of the Provincial States of Friesland under the [[Constitution of the Netherlands|Constitution of the Kingdom of the Netherlands]].
==Background==
After the [[Lordship of Frisia]] (formerly enjoying [[Imperial immediacy]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]], but given as a [[fief]] to [[Albert III, Duke of Saxony|the father]] of [[George, Duke of Saxony]] in 1498 by [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]], then still [[King of the Romans]], and sold by duk George to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] in 1515), became part of the [[Habsburg Netherlands]], its government followed the general Habsburg model of a [[stadtholder]] with a Council (in this case the Court of Friesland). But as in other provinces of the Netherlands a [[Estates of the realm|States]] was periodically convened to send representatives to the [[States General of the Netherlands]] to deliberate about the granting of extraordinary subsidies to the central government (called ''Beden''), and as in other provinces the three Estates: [[Clergy]], [[Nobility]], and Third Estate were represented in that body. In Friesland the Third Estate was formed by representatives of the three ''[[Gau (territory)|Goa]]s'' that made up Friesland: ''[[Westergoa|Westergo]]'', ''[[Eastergoa|Oostergo]]'', and ''Zevenwouden''. These representatives were elected by ''eigenerfden'' (comparable to [[Freehold (law)|freeholders]]) who possessed a ''hornleger'' (a farmhouse and yard), with a parcel of land attached that was taxed for the ''verponding'' or ''floreen'' (a land tax that was comparable to the French ''[[Taille]]'')&lt;ref&gt;Wierdsma, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;. The "electoral districts" were formed by the 30 ''[[Grietenij]]en'' into which Friesland was subdivided. Originally the citizens of the eleven cities were mixed in  with the peasants and nobles in the ''grietenijen'', but just before the accession of Friesland to the Union of Utrecht in 1580, they were allowed to form a separate fourth "quarter", apart from the three Goas just mentioned, by then-stadtholder [[George de Lalaing, Count of Rennenberg]], and have their own representation in the States. After the revolutionary period of the accession to the Union in 1579-1580 the Clergy and Nobility no longer participated in the States, at least as separate Estates.&lt;ref&gt;Wierdsma, pp. 39-42&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''Gedeputeerde Staten'' (Delegated States) also predated the Dutch Republic. Already in the 1530s they were formed by the States as a counterweight against the Court of Friesland (then still mainly a kind of [[Privy council]] for the stadtholder, and secondarily the court of highest instance in the Lordship).&lt;ref name="bestuur"&gt;Gewestelijke bestuursinstellingen&lt;/ref&gt; During the first years of the [[Dutch Revolt]] they achieved a permanent existence when Rennenberg in 1577 formally recognized them after the [[Pacification of Ghent]]. Initially they consisted of two members for each of the "quarters" of Friesland, but in 1584 the quarter of the cites was given three representatives, bringing the total number of members to nine. They formed the true "Executive" on a daily basis and were directly responsible to the States.&lt;ref&gt;Israel, pp. 281-282&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation and Powers==
The States of Friesland were the assembly of the thirty ''grietenijen'' and eleven cities&lt;ref group=Note&gt;[[Leeuwarden]] and [[Dokkum]] in ''Oostergo''; [[Harlingen, Netherlands|Harlingen]], [[Franeker]], [[Bolsward]], [[Sneek]], [[IJlst]], [[Workum]], [[Hindeloopen]], and [[Stavoren]] in ''Westergo''; and [[Sloten, Friesland|Sloten]] in ''Zevenwouden''.&lt;/ref&gt; of Friesland in which each had one vote. (In comparison, the [[States of Holland and West Friesland]] were made up of eighteen cities and the ''ridderschap'' (College of Nobles) of the  [[County of Holland]], each having one vote). Other than most other provinces, Friesland did not have a ''Ridderschap'' as part of its States, and the Clergy was also no longer represented as such (though individual nobles and clergymen could of course be delegates). Every ''grietenij'' and every city was allowed to send two delegates to the annual session of the States, that was known as the ''Landdag'' ([[Landtag]] or [[Diet (assembly)]]). The ''grietenijen'' elected such delegates, called ''Volmachten'' (which literally means [[Agent (law)|Proxy]]) in elections in which owners of a taxable parcel of land of a certain minimum size, with a farmhouse on it (so-called ''eigenerfden''), could take part.The minimum size varied over the course of time. In the Government Regulations adopted in 1748 the minimum size was put at  five ''pondematen''&lt;ref group=Note&gt;One ''pondemaat'' was 0. 3674 [[hectare]], so slightly less than an [[acre]]; Cf. Wierdsma, p. 16, note 3.&lt;/ref&gt; of [[clay]] soil, or ten ''pondematen'' of [[woodland]].&lt;ref&gt;Wierdsma, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; 

It should be noted that the vote was tied to the land and was transferred when the land was sold or otherwise transferred. The minimum size of the taxable parcel so determined the number of votes in the ''grietenij''. The system was open to the abuse of amassing these taxable parcels to amass votes in the ''grietenij'' elections.&lt;ref&gt;Wierdsma, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, vote collectors would buy the plots with borrowed money, giving a mortgage to the lender, and then immediately renting it out to a tenant, who would not be eligible to vote. The ''hornlegers'' on this land were rented out in perpetuity for very low rents (sometimes the value of two [[rooster]]s) and still allow the new owner to use the vote attached to the land (so-called "rooster votes"), but for this reason the Regulation of 1748 stipulated that the new owner should own the house for at least a year, before he could use its vote.&lt;ref&gt;Wierdsma, p. 16, and note 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Not everybody who owned such a taxable parcel was allowed to vote, however. Excluded were members of [[religious denomination]]s that were "not-admitted". The only admitted denominations were the [[Dutch Reformed Church]] (and its French-language equivalent, the [[Walloon church]]); the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran church]], and the [[Mennonites]]. [[Minor (law)|Minor]]s could be represented by their guardians. Otherwise, everybody (women, as well as men, natural-born citizens as well as aliens) could exercise the vote.&lt;ref&gt;Wierdsma, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Passive suffrage]] was more restricted. In the first place, one of the ''Volmachten'' of every ''grietenij'' had to be an ''eigenerfde'' (i.e. a commoner), while the other had to be a "nobleman." But this immediately posed the problem that Friesland did not have a nobility in the usual sense of families who had received a feudal [[fief]] from a [[Homage (feudal)|liege lord]], or people who had been [[Knight|knighted]], for lack of a feudal history. However, Friesland did have notable families of great substance, who lived on castles known as ''[[Stins]]en'', and enjoyed the respect of the local population, whose "natural leaders" they were. These people (though not having pieces of paper, such as patents of nobility, to prove their claim) were generally considered members of the domestic nobility, and they often used noble titles like [[baron]] or [[jonkheer]]. On the other hand, members of foreign&lt;ref group=Note&gt;"Foreign" in this case could mean being a citizen of one of the other provinces of the Dutch Republic, as well as of foreign countries.&lt;/ref&gt; nobility could be "recognized" as nobles. But all in all, the qualification was vague and gave occasion to much litigation before the ''Gedeputeerde Staten'' (who acted as the competent court in disputes about [[accreditation]]).&lt;ref&gt;Wierdsma, pp. 25-32, 20&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''volmachten'' representing the cities also were of two kinds: one had to be a member of the city ''[[vroedschap]]''; the other a member of the city magistracy, like a ''[[burgemeester]]''. These delegates were, however, elected by the combined ''vroedschap'' and magistracy, not by each separately.&lt;ref&gt;Wierdsma, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; In sum, the ''Landdag'' usually consisted of 84 members (60 for the ''grietenijen'' and 22 for the cities). But as so much in Friesland this was not strictly enforced, and often the number of delegates was (much) larger, though the number of votes remained fixed at (30 + 11 =) 41.&lt;ref&gt;Wierdsma, p. 20-21&lt;/ref&gt;

For all ''volmachten'' was required that they be:
* either natural-born citizens of Friesland, or [[Naturalization|naturalized]] former aliens, who had resided at least ten years in Friesland;&lt;ref&gt;Wierdsma, pp. 21-22&lt;/ref&gt;
* at least 20 years of age (though the minimum age, was sometimes put as high as 25);&lt;ref name="wierdsma 24"&gt;Wierdsma, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;
* an avowed Patriot;&lt;ref name="wierdsma 24"/&gt;
* a member of the Dutch Reformed Church (so this was more restrictive than the requirement for [[Suffrage|active suffrage]], mentioned above);&lt;ref name="wierdsma 25"&gt;Wierdsma, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;
* finally, there were a number of incompatibilities, like the ineligibility of officers of cities as delegates of the land-quarters, and of officers of the ''grietenijen'' and land-quarters as delegates for the cities; and delegates, closely related by blood or marriage, could not be delegates in the same body at the same time&lt;ref name="wierdsma 25"/&gt;
[[File:Interieur, overzicht statenzaal met polonceauspanten en wapens, provinciehuis - Leeuwarden - 20345355 - RCE.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Interior of the restored Meeting Hall of the States of Friesland (still in use by the modern States)&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Note the [[Camille Polonceau|Polonceau]] trusses under the roof.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The ''Landdag'' was usually convened once a year (in January), by a summons issued by the ''Gedeputeerde Staten'' to the ''[[Grietman]]nen'' of the ''grietenijen'' and the city governments, who were charged with organizing the elections. The summons usually specified the [[Agenda (meeting)|agenda]] for the session also, though this would not bind the ''Landdag''. After the elections had taken place the ''volmachten'' would convene at the ''Landshuis'' in Leeuwarden at the appointed day and time. After the opening of the session they would divide themselves up in four "chambers" (one for each "quarter"), who would start their deliberations in four rooms assigned to these quarters.&lt;ref&gt;Wierdsma, pp. 34-37&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of the ''Landdag'' on a daily basis was organized by a steering committee of eight ''volmachten'' (two for each quarter) called the ''Mindergetal'' (literally "smaller number" as they were a committee from the States that was smaller than the number of the delegates in the ''Landdag''). Initially this committee was elected by the ''Landdag'' at the beginning of the deliberations, but later they were appointed for a number of years, according to a schedule of rotation. All documents for the States (such as petitions) first had to be submitted to the ''Mindergetal'', whose members would convey them to their own Chamber, and report back to the ''Mindergetal'' with the advice from the Chamber. The ''Mindergetal'' also drafted Resolutions for the ''Landdag'', which were then submitted to the Chambers for deliberation and consent. The ''Mindergetal'' also advised the States on documents from the States General and the [[Council of State (Netherlands)#Under the Dutch Republic|Council of State]].&lt;ref name="bestuur"/&gt;

As elsewhere in the Dutch Republic the "center of gravity" of government was located in local government (i.e. the cities and villages). [[Sovereignty]] was supposed to be located "in the People" and to percolate upward from there to the States of the province by way of the local authorities, where it was eventually "reposited". The States were (at least after 1588, when the last of the Governors-General, who before then were considered the founts of sovereignty, [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester]], left Dutch territory forever) considered the governing bodies where sovereignty ultimately resided&lt;ref group=Note&gt;And therefore not, as often is incorrectly assumed, in the stadtholders of the several provinces.&lt;/ref&gt;  But under the Union of Utrecht the seven provinces had concluded a defensive alliance in 1579 and delegated certain sovereign powers upward to the [[States General of the Netherlands]], such as the common defense and foreign policy. For these common matters the provinces had to supply financial contributions and these contributions were with their consent determined in the States General. The States of the provinces were therefore in the first place responsible for the representation of their province in the States General, and for providing the agreed contributions. Legislating about the necessary taxation in each province was therefore an important task of the States (though the collection of those taxes was usually left to the local authorities, who in turn, before 1748, outsourced that task to [[Farm (revenue leasing)|tax farmers]]). The States were generally the [[legislature]] on the provincial level, though most civil and criminal law already existed under the system known as [[Roman-Dutch law]], that was enforced by the courts with the Court of Friesland at their apex. As the notion of [[Separation of powers]] did not (yet) exist, the States were also the [[Executive (government)|Executive]] on the provincial level. 

It is often assumed that the provincial stadtholder (an office held over from the [[Habsburg Netherlands]]) was the true "Executive", but this was only the case in any meaningful sense of the word after the [[Second Stadtholderless Period#Crisis and the_Orangist revolution of 1747|Orangist revolution of 1747]]. Before that, the actual powers of the Frisian stadtholder were very limited by the Instruction the States drafted at the appointment of each of those stadtholders. Ironically, Friesland was the only province that always had a stadtholder, even during the [[First Stadtholderless Period]] (1650-1672) and the [[Second Stadtholderless Period]] (1702-1747), when other provinces had abolished the office of stadtholder. After 1588 the Frisian stadtholders were always members of the [[House of Orange-Nassau|House of Nassau-Dietz]], beginning with [[William Louis, Count of Nassau-Dillenburg]]. The office was even made hereditary in Friesland for members of this House in 1675. After [[William the Silent]] Friesland never had a stadtholder who was a member of the original [[Prince of Orange|House of Orange]], that expired with [[William III of England]]&lt;ref group=Note&gt;During William's stadtholderate in the other provinces [[Henry Casimir II, Prince of Nassau-Dietz]] was stadtholder in Friesland.&lt;/ref&gt; who was never a stadtholder of Friesland. Before 1747 (when the then-Frisian stadtholder, [[William IV, Prince of Orange]], was made stadtholder of all the other provinces also), the competence of the Frisian stadtholder was usually limited in wartime to being Captain-General of the Frisian contingent of troops in the [[Dutch States Army]], usually subordinated to the stadtholder of Holland. In  peacetime his duties were even less onerous. All of this changed, however, with the Government Regulations that were promulgated by William IV in 1748 at the express "request" of the Frisian States. After that a large number of powers of appointment that previously had belonged to the States themselves, or the ''Gedeputeerde Staten'', were taken over by the stadtholder.&lt;ref&gt;Wierdsma, pp. 95-97, 117-125&lt;/ref&gt; But the States retained the monopoly of creating and abolishing offices for the discharge of tasks on the provincial level, which may be seen as the principal "executive" function of the States.

==History==
===Attempts at constitutional reform===
The "constitution" of Friesland, as in the other provinces of the Republic, was not one written document, but a quilt of medieval [[charter]]s, ordinances that predated the Union of Utrecht (like the [[Placard]] of 30 October 1539, that regulated the elections in Friesland&lt;ref&gt;Wierdsma, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;, treaties (like the [[Peace of Münster]]), and customs, and legal precedents from Roman-Dutch law.&lt;ref&gt;Wierdsma, pp. 38-39&lt;/ref&gt; But certain problems with these largely unwritten norms formed an impetus for several attempts at constitutional reform in the form of the promulgation of a written Government Regulation. These problems were widely felt abuses like the trade in votes in the ''grietenijen'' and the sale of offices, or in general rampant corruption.&lt;ref&gt;Wierdsma, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; The trade in votes led to a situation similar to that of the [[Rotten and pocket boroughs]] in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] before the [[Reform Act 1832]]. The sale of offices was a universal abuse that is known as [[Simony]] in the context of the Church, and in many countries elicited periodical attempts at suppression (like e.g. the [[Sale of Offices Act 1551]] in England). But there were other forms of corruption also, that needed to be addressed. Also, the "rules of the game" embedded in the existing system favored certain political players over others, and this led to attempts to arrive at a more equitable set-up. In Friesland these attempts at constitutional reform came to a head during three periods with a "revolutionary flavor": 1627, 1672 and 1748.

In '''1627''' the proximate cause of the reform movement were new taxes that were introduced in connection with the war situation.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The [[Eighty Years' War]] had resumed in 1621 and in 1626-1627 the Spaniards and their allies in the context of the [[Thirty Years' War]] approached the Frisian borders. In 1627 Dutch troops under the Frisian stadtholder [[Ernest Casimir I, Count of Nassau-Dietz]] captured [[Oldenzaal]]. The Spanish successes, however, necessitated an enlargement of the [[Dutch States Army]], first with 7,000 new troops in 1626, and in 1627 to equality with the Spanish [[Army of Flanders]] at 58,000 men. This necessitated far larger contributions from Friesland to the financing of the war, and hence to imposition of new taxes by the Frisian States ;Cf. Israel, pp. 498-499&lt;/ref&gt; As so often, the taxpayers rebelled at this, especially those in the cities, who felt unfairly imposed upon. The [[oligarchy]] of the ''grietmannen'' was blamed for this, and this led to a movement to diminish their power.&lt;ref&gt;Wierdsma, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

The States appointed a commission of inquiry on 13 December 1626 that had to gather comments from the population about its grievances through the intermediary of the ''grietmannen'' and the city governments, and report by 30 January 1627 (i.e. at the time the new ''Landdag'' was to be convened). This procedure resulted in a [[Resolution (law)|Resolution]] of the States of 17 April 1627, which became known as the Appeal about Abuses. This formed the basis for the so-called ''poincten reformatoir'' (reform points) of 1627, a terminology that was repeated at later occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Wierdsma, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important of these 28 points were the following:
* A ''Volmacht'' could no longer be appointed to an Office;
* Votes recruited with corrupt means would be invalid;
* Accumulation of offices was prohibited;
* Written contracts to acquire an office were prohibited, as was the sale of offices;
* Officers could not be absent for periods of more than eight weeks;
* ''Gedeputeerde Staten'' were no longer allowed to create paid offices or pensions; this was exclusively a matter for the States;
* There was a [[quorum ]]for decisions in all official bodies;
* Strict regulations about public accountancy were introduced;
* Strict regulations about the [[Muster (military)|muster]] of troops were to be enforced;
* In case of vacancies of ''grietmannen'' and other ''grietenij'' offices, the ''Gedeputeerde Staten'' would speedily organize an election in which the voters of the ''grietenij'' would draw up a [[Slate (elections)|slate]] of [[Nomination|nominees]], and the ''Gedeputeerde Staten'' would speedily appoint one of these nominees to the vacant office.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;First note that though the office of ''Grietman'' was in principle an elective office, the actual election was done, not by the voters, but by a supposedly "neutral" institution that was supposed to be "above the local politics." Note also that in this case the appointing institution was not yet the stadtholder (as would be the case after 1748), but the ''Gedeputeerde Staten''; Cf. Wierdsma, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;
These points were promulgated by the Resolution of the States of 15 June 1627.&lt;ref&gt;Wierdsma, pp. 51-54&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately, these reforms, though impressive on paper, were honored primarily in the breach. They formed the basis for new attempts at reform in '''1672''' therefore, when a [[Rampjaar|war situation]] again roiled public sentiments. A petition of representatives of the cities of 12 September 1672 to the States referred explicitly to the Appeal about Abuses of 1627. The States had already on 2 March 1672 formed a commission to draw up proposals for military and financial reform, but without result, so the petition may be explained from the frustrations of the population at this inaction. The military situation became threatening for Friesland when on 25 June 1672 the troops of the [[Prince-Bishopric of Münster]], led by [[Christoph Bernhard von Galen]], who had invaded the Dutch Republic from the East, came near to the Frisian border. The danger was soon averted, but the [[Countess Albertine Agnes of Nassau]], [[Regent]]&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The Frisian stadtholderate was not yet hereditary at this time, but the boy's father had persuaded the States before his death in 1664 to accept him as future stadtholder at his majority in 1675. When William Frederick unexpectedly died in 1664, the mother was treated by the States "as if" she was his regent.&lt;/ref&gt; for her son [[Henry Casimir II, Prince of Nassau-Dietz]], the putative stadtholder after the death of her husband [[William Frederick, Prince of Nassau-Dietz]], had already petitioned the States on behalf of her son, to [[Inundation|inundate]] the countryside as a means to stop the enemy. This harebrained scheme was averted, but by then the population was in full revolt.&lt;ref&gt;Wierdsma, pp. 55-60&lt;/ref&gt;

In Leeuwarden the mob put pressure on the Magistrate to promote the appointment of the only  15-year old Prince as Frisian stadtholder, and this was actually done on 13 July 1672.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Around the same time Prince Henry Casimir's cousin William III was appointed stadtholder in Holland and Zeeland, ending the [[First Stadtholderless Period]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wierdsma, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; This did not satisfy the reformers, however, and in September 1672 the Leeuwarden Magistrate was forced to allow the convening of a commission that soon came up with proposals for reform. A petition was handed over to the States and on 18 September 1672 the ''Landdag'' appointed a commission to deliberate the 53 points in this petition. Around this time the eminent Frisian [[jurist]][[Ulrik Huber]] published a brochure, entitled ''Spiegel van Doleancie en Reformatie'' (Mirror of Appeal and Reform) in which he pleaded for a rational and constitutional/legal approach to reform, instead of the wild "revolutionary" approach of the reformers. He proposed that either the States, or the Court of Friesland would take the initiative.&lt;ref&gt;Wierdsma, pp. 63-66&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:UlrikHuber.jpg|thumb|right|250px|&lt;center&gt;Portrait of [[Ulrik Huber]]]]
His most useful contribution as a legal scholar was, however, that he discussed the ''poincten reformatoir'' of 1627 to decide what was still relevant. Among those points he counted:
* the prohibition of the accumulation of offices;
* a minimum age for all offices of 23 years;
* prohibition of corrupt practices at elections (an example was to "liquor up" entire villages at election time&lt;ref&gt;Wierdsma, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;);
* prohibition of the sale of offices;
* prohibition of long absences, and the requirement that officers live in the place where they work;
* appointment of representatives of the States in the States General for at least three years.&lt;ref&gt;Wierdsma, pp. 64-69&lt;/ref&gt;

From this brochure it may be inferred that the abuses were indeed serious. In any case, the commission of the States indeed included many of the points from the 1627 ''poincts reformatoir'' recommended by Huber in her proposal, and added a large number of new ones, not always of great import&lt;ref group=Note&gt;One of the proposals was to abolish the office of inspector of stud horses as an economy measure; Cf. Wierdsma, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;, but sometimes of great consequence, like the proposed prohibition of ''grietmannen'' standing for election as ''volmacht''. This was intended to diminish the power of the ''grietmannen'' and would cause great problems when the proposals were adopted under pressure of the Leeuwarden mob by the States in the Resolution of 27 September 1672.&lt;ref&gt;Wierdsma, pp. 70-74&lt;/ref&gt;

The new ''Landdag'' was convened for 14 October 1672, elected under the new Resolution, hence without ''grietmannen''. However, the excluded ''grietmannen'' now started a fight over the letters of accreditation of the newly elected ''volmachten'', in which they managed to bring the whole accreditation process to a standstill. The old ''volmachten'', with the support of the new stadtholder and his mother, then convened the States in the city of [[Sneek]] for 7 November 1672. The old ''volmachten'' defended this schism in the States with the argument that they had been elected for the entire year of 1672, so the recent elections had been illegal, as was the Resolution of 27 September 1672. The two competing ''Landdagen'' (in Leeuwarden and Sneek) then published so-called ''Deducties'' (Arguments) in pamphlet form in which they pleaded their cases during November and December 1672. The quarrel threatened the safety of the Union, so the States General sent a commission to mediate between the warring ''Landdagen''. That commission arrived on 4 January 1673 in Leeuwarden and offered its services to both the Sneek and Leeuwarden groups. Sneek accepted immediately, but Leeuwarden rejected the offer. The Leeuwarden States preferred mediation by the Court of Friesland. However, this ploy failed and the commission from the States General on 21 January 1673 sent an ultimatum to the Leeuwarden States to accept their mediation. After some hesitation this was accepted on 25 January.&lt;ref&gt;Wierdsma, pp. 74-83&lt;/ref&gt;

The commission (augmented with the boy-stadtholder) then started with the compilation of a new set of ''poincten reformatoir'' with resulted in a draft-Resolution for the States of 105 articles, presented on 8 February 1673 to the States. But this draft did not meet with approval. On 17 February the newly elected ''Landdag'' was opened with a speech by one of the commissioners from the States General, but the commission left Leeuwarden on 1 March 1673, without having attained a result. The ''Gedeputeerde Staten'' then proposed to the States to put the matter in the hands of a commission of the States, formally chaired by the boy-stadtholder, consisting of one representative of each of the land quarters, and two representatives of the city quarter (one of which was [[Allart Pieter van Jongestall]]). This commission took the report of the mediation commission as a starting point and came (after some culling) up with 97 articles, which were promulgated by the Resolution of the States of 19 March 1673.&lt;ref&gt;Wierdsma, pp. 83-85&lt;/ref&gt;

The new Regulation contained the following important points:
* The stadtholder assumed the rights of his ancestors;
* All disputed decisions of the States of the previous year were annulled;
* The minimum age for a ''volmacht'' would be 20 years;
* ''Grietmannen'' were eligible for all offices (including ''volmacht'') with exception of member of the ''Gedeputeerde Staten'';
* Aliens could be naturalized after ten years residence;
* Offices could not be transferred to others;
* The offices of ''Land's Advocate'' ([[Grand Pensionary]]) and ''fiscal'' of the ''Gedeputeerde Staten'' were abolished;
* An [[Amnesty]] was declared in connection with the events of the preceding year.
Furthermore, a large number of articles from the previous ''poincten reformatoir'' were included. The whole was called the ''poincten decisoir'' of 1673. However, despite this seemingly decisive result the new Regulation was again (like the one of 1627) honored in the breach.&lt;ref&gt;Wierdsma, pp. 85-91&lt;/ref&gt;

A new political crisis, the one of '''1748''', was needed to finally arrive at a written constitution that was effective. To understand that crisis the situation during the [[Second Stadtholderless Period]] should briefly be recapitulated. After the death of king-stadtholder William III in 1702 the stadtholderate was abolished in all provinces, except Friesland and Groningen, and a regime of [[Dutch States Party]] ''[[regenten]]'' came into power that would stay there until the French invasion of 1747, which caused a popular revolt. During this long period, Friesland retained a stadtholder with the usual limited powers. This was first [[John William Friso, Prince of Orange]], who inherited the office in 1696 (still a minor) and died in 1711. At the time of his death his wife, [[Landgravine Marie Louise of Hesse-Kassel]], was pregnant with their son [[William IV, Prince of Orange]], who was born six weeks later. He also inherited the office of stadtholder in Friesland and Groningen, but evidently was unable to serve, and his mother acted as a regent until his majority in 1731. During this time [[Gelderland]] in 1722 also indicated its willingness to accept him as its stadtholder. Between 1731 and 1747 he therefore was already stadtholder in three of the seven provinces of the Republic, but for each separately, and without powers at the national level. In the four other provinces and on the national level the States party dominated, and it also had great influence in the three provinces that had appointed William, which contributed to a steady erosion of his prerogatives in those provinces, according to complaints of his [[Orangism (Dutch Republic)|Orangist]] partisans.&lt;ref&gt;Wierdsma, pp. 92-94&lt;/ref&gt;

The French invasion of 1747 showed the military unpreparedness of the Republic, as in 1672, and as in 1672 the population revolted against the States party and demanded that a stadtholder be appointed to take charge of the country's defenses. The only likely candidate was William IV, and despite great misgivings the States of Holland and the other three provinces appointed him in their vacant stadtholder's offices in May 1747. He then moved his court from Leeuwarden to the Hague, and started to consolidate his political position by deftly exploiting the disarray of his political opponents and replacing them with his own partisans, often helped by judiciously applied street violence of Orangist mobs to intimidate his opponents.&lt;ref&gt;Israel, pp. 1067-1070&lt;/ref&gt; Friesland was spared this violence, apart from a [[Pachtersoproer|few riots against the tax farmers]], which in other parts of the Republic also had drawn the ire of the population.&lt;ref&gt;Wierdsma, pp. 94-95&lt;/ref&gt; The States asked for military protection against the mob violence from the stadtholder, but like in other cases where he deemed that violence convenient for his purposes, he refused to send troops.&lt;ref&gt;Israel, p. 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

This mob violence was in Friesland, however, canalized into a movement to reform the old regime, starting with a deputation that on 1 June 1748 was sent by the city of [[Harlingen, Netherlands|Harlingen]] to the States in Leeuwarden, with a petition, containing the following demands:
* Making the office of Frisian stadtholder hereditary in the House of Orange-Nassau in both the male and female lines&lt;ref group=Note&gt;To avoid misunderstandings, making the office hereditary did not mean that the succession was automatic: the States still appointed the stadtholder, and drew up a new Instruction at each occasion. But there was only one candidate for the position: the current [[German nobility#Non-reigning titles|''Erfprins'']] of Nassau-Dietz (later Orange-Nassau). Making the office hereditary in both lines did not mean that male descendants did not still have priority, as illustrated by the fact that in 1751 not Princess [[Carolina of Orange-Nassau|Carolina]] succeeded, but her younger brother [[William V, Prince of Orange| William V]]. The provision about the female line was only introduced to avoid a situation as arose in 1890, when Queen [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands]] could not succeed her father [[William III of the Netherlands]] as [[List of monarchs of Luxembourg#House of Nassau-Weilburg|Grand Duke of Luxembourg]]. The office of Frisian stadtholder had been hereditary in the male line only since 1675.&lt;/ref&gt;, as had in 1747 been done in the other provinces;
* repeal of a number of taxes, to be replaced with a so-called ''quotisatie''&lt;ref group=Note&gt;This was a form of [[Poll tax]].&lt;/ref&gt;;
* abolition of the tax farms;
* a request to the stadtholder to draw up written Government Regulations to codify the constitutional arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Wierdsma, pp. 96-97&lt;/ref&gt;

These demands were accepted by the hastily assembled States on 5 June, but meanwhile a large number of citizen-delegates from all over Friesland had assembled in Leeuwarden to present further grievances. These so-called ''gecommitteerden'' marched to the States and presented a number of demands, partly overlapping with the ones just mentioned, but in addition also that the ''poincten reformatoir'' of 1627 and the ''poincten decisoir'' of 1672 would be brought into force, and that the authorities would indicate their willingness to accede to future petitions, or would allow the populace to approach the stadtholder with their grievances.&lt;ref  group=Note&gt;The States had on 11 June 1748 requested the stadtholder to come up with a draft for new ''poincten reformatoir''; Cf. Wierdsma, pp. 96, 117&lt;/ref&gt; Even more consequential than these demands (that were immediately granted) was that the ''gecommitteerden'' charged a number of commissions from their midst to formulate new proposals. This led to a number of further reforms in the following months, such as the new rule that the stadtholder would have a tie-breaking vote in the ''Landdag''.&lt;ref&gt;Wierdsma, pp. 97-99&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 July 1748 the ''gecommitteerden'' went to the States in solemn procession, and presented a further list of 72 demands, and another list of 47 demands on 25 July. These lists contained  (in random order) the usual forms of redress of grievances against the combination of offices; forms of official corruption, like sale of offices; appointment of minors in offices as [[sinecure]]s; election abuses; the abolition of the regulation of stud horses (which appears to have been an enduring grievance); accountability in the public finances, including the mustering of the troops; reduction of the standing army in peace time; increase of the minimum size of the parcel of land attached to a vote, to ten pondematen clay soil and twenty pondematen woodland, but only for new cases; the prohibition of payments by the authorities in the form of paper money or [[IOU]]s; incompatibilities of all kinds of public offices, especially for ''grietmannen''; abolition of a number of privileges; and many others of more or less importance. Most of these demands were accepted by the States, but with the proviso that these decisions would be ''approved'' by the stadtholder. The ''gecommitteerden'' saw this as too much wiggle room, and demanded that the reforms would be ''guaranteed'' by the stadtholder, which the States hastily consented to.&lt;ref&gt;Wierdsma, pp. 99-113&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:StadhouderWillemIV(4).jpg|thumb|left|250px|&lt;center&gt;Portrait of stadtholder [[William IV, Prince of Orange|William IV]]]]
These reforms seemed a great success for the "democratic" forces in Friesland, and a defeat for the old oligarchy. But then the stadtholder intervened. He had already restored the ''Regeringsreglementen'' (Government Regulations) that the States of Gelderland, of Overijssel and of Utrecht had been forced to accept in 1674 as the price of their re-admission to the Union after their occupation by the French army in 1672, and which had given then-stadtholder William III far-reaching powers of control over their provincial governments. These  Regulations had lapsed under the stadtholderless regime, but were now re-introduced for the benefit of William IV. They gave him the right of appointment, or at least approval of appointments, of magistrates on the local level (from a slate of nominees, drawn up by the local ''vroedschap'', but he was not bound by those nominations), and of officials on the provincial level, among whom delegates to the States General. William also tamped down on "democratic" movements among his followers in other parts of the country.&lt;ref&gt;Israel, p. 1071, 1074-1075&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1748 he did sent troops "to restore order" (though the disturbances had ceased by then) and delegated a commission of the States General to hold an inquiry into the causes of the unrest in Friesland.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Note that this was quite a constitutional reversal: in olden days the States General had sent stadtholders on such a mission, not the other way around.&lt;/ref&gt; This commission consisted of a number of his henchmen from other provinces: Schimmelpenninck van der Oye (delegate for Gelderland), Gevaerts (Holland), Verelst (Zeeland), Perzoon (Overijssel). They arrived in Leeuwarden at the end of August and immediately started hearings of a number of people specifically selected by William himself (mostly ''grietmannen'' from well-known noble families) to inform them about what had been going on. It should not cause much surprise that the first conclusion the Commission arrived at after its inquiry was that the main cause of the disturbances had been "the little authority, left to the stadtholder, because of which the authority of the States had become overweening"&lt;ref&gt;Wierdsma, pp. 114-115&lt;/ref&gt;

Little happened after the departure of the Commission at the end of September, however, as everybody seemed to be awaiting the arrival of the stadtholder himself, which was delayed until December 1748. On 21 December 1748 he gave a forceful speech to the ''Landdag'' and handed over his already completed ''Reglement reformatoir'', a Government Regulation for Friesland after the model of the Regulations for the other provinces mentioned before.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;It should be noted that this was a novum for Friesland, as it had never had such a Government Regulation imposed.&lt;/ref&gt; After referring to the request of the States of 11 June 1748, the stadtholder enumerated 60 articles, among which the following:
* The minimum size of a vote-carrying parcel of land would again be 5 ''pondematen'' clay soil, or 10 ''pondematen'' woodland (i.e. half the size the ''gecommitteerden'' had laid down in July), and a number of other regulations concerning elections;
* The stadtholder (no longer the ''Gedeputeerde Staten'') appoints the ''Grietman'' from the slate of nominees drawn up in the ''grietenij'' elections;
* An ordinary session of the States could last no longer than six weeks, and a number of other regulations concerning the rules of order of the deliberations of the States; extraordinary sessions could only consider the agenda made up by the ''Gedeputeerde Staten'';
* In case of conflicts between chambers of the ''Landdag'' the stadtholder decides, and also in conflicts of an administrative or political nature, where the Court of Friesland will no longer be competent;
* As the tax farms have been abolished, which causes a crisis in the public finances, the States will decide on new taxes to replace these revenues, and a number of reforms of public accountancy and of the collection of taxes were ordained;
* The old [[guild]]s were to be restored in the cities with regulations updated to modern circumstances;
* Only officially established [[weigh house]]s were to be tolerated;
* All old laws not contrary to this Regulation will remain in force;
* All officials will swear an oath to maintain this Regulation;
* The stadtholder is the only person who may ''interpret'' and explain this Regulation (but he was ''not'' authorized to ''amend''&lt;ref&gt;Wierdsma, pp. 126-127&lt;/ref&gt; it on his own in future)&lt;ref&gt;Wierdsma, pp. 117-125&lt;/ref&gt;

William left Leeuwarden for The Hague at the end of 1748 in the belief that he had finally laid down a written constitution for Friesland that would actually be observed. However, this appears not to have been the case, as shown by the facts in the ''Apologie'' (Apologia) the Frisian politician [[Court Lambertus van Beyma]] published during his exile in [[Saint-Omer]] in 1790.&lt;ref&gt;Wierdsma, pp. 130-132&lt;/ref&gt; Many corrupt practices were continued, and the hoped for forceful government of William IV as a [[Enlightened despotism|benevolent dictator]] in the Republic did not materialize. After his unexpected death in 1751 his infant son [[William V, Prince of Orange]] formally succeeded him as stadtholder in all provinces of the Republic, but the government was exercised as Regent by his mother [[Anne, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange]] until her death in 1759. During this time a so-called "Frisian cabal" of her courtiers made the stadtholderian regime infamous for its corrupt practices. One especially corrupt official was her [[equerry]] [[Douwe Sirtema van Grovestins]], who once sold the governorship of [[Dutch Ceylon]] for 70,000 guilders.&lt;ref&gt;Israel, p. 1082&lt;/ref&gt;. When William V came of age in 1766 and was duly appointed stadtholder in all provinces, he remained under the tutelage of his equally corrupt mentor [[Duke Louis Ernest of Brunswick-Lüneburg]], with whom he concluded the [[Acte van Consulentschap]].&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The Frisian States tried to claw back some of their independence at the occasion of their appointment of William as the Frisian stadtholder in 1766, when they formulated a restrictive Instruction. But the Duke of Brunswick easily deflected this attempt at insubordination; Cf. Israel, p. 1092&lt;/ref&gt; This regime eventually provoked the Patriot Revolt during the [[Patriottentijd]].

===The schism during the Patriottentijd===
{{main|Patriottentijd}}
The system of suffrage for the States facilitated the accumulation of votes in a few hands of people who bought up land parcels to which votes were attached. To finance these land purchases they generally took out mortgage loans. In any case, around the 1770s the main investors in these mortgage loans were wealthy members of the [[Mennonites|Mennonite]] religious minority, who were discriminated against in public life. Though they could vote in elections, they were not allowed to stand for those elections, which formally deprived them of political influence. But materially they did use their hold over the [[Mortgage law#Participants and variant terminology|mortgagors]] to strongly influence the elections. They were strongly opposed to the stadtholderate that they saw as the main obstacle to their own emancipation. Through their influence the States had a large minority of Patriot members, and at times even a majority.&lt;ref name="colenbrander 115"&gt;Colenbrander, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of this Patriot hold over the States was seen in February 1782 when the States accepted the letters of accreditation of the envoy of the "Rebel" Unites States of America, [[John Adams]], as the first province in the Union (and the second sovereign body in Europe, after the [[Kingdom of France]]), and instructed their delegates in the States General to do likewise. This helped convince the latter  body to recognise the United States on 19 April 1782, against the will of the stadtholder, which represented an important diplomatic coup for Adams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Simon Schama|Schama, S.]]|date=1977|title=Patriots and Liberators. Revolution in the Netherlands 1780-1813|place=New York|publisher=Vintage books|ISBN=0-679-72949-6|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Court Lambertus van Beyma.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Portrait of [[Court Lambertus van Beyma]]]]
But usually the Patriots and the Orangists in the States were more or less in balance and around 1787 the Orangists had a definite majority, though this was uncertain enough that the British ambassador in the Republic, Sir [[James Harris, 1st Earl of Malmesbury|James Harris]], who had by then a mandate from the government of [[William Pitt the Younger]] to subvert the Patriots, and had the use of a slush-fund of £70,000 to further that end&lt;ref&gt;Cobban, pp. 121-135&lt;/ref&gt;, embarked on a scheme to buy up enough mortgages of Pro-Orangist voters in Friesland, to break the hold of the Mennonites, and secure a definite Orangist majority in the States.&lt;ref name="colenbrander 115"/&gt;

However, the elections of January 1787 had already resulted in an Orangist majority in the States, which was immediately used to legislate against the Patriots: Patriot petitions were prohibited as were Patriot demonstrations. But the Patriots did not take this attempt at suppression lying down. Van Beyma mobilized the Patriot [[Exercitiegenootschap|civic militias]] that helped protect the centers of Patriot opposition against the States against repression by the States Army garrison in Leeuwarden. One of those centers was the [[University of Franeker]] where the faculty and students were strong Patriot partisans. The faculty member [[Johan Valckenaer]] was dismissed by the States for his political views in May 1787, which caused the students to riot. This recommended [[Franeker]] as a safe place for Patriots. When a split developed in the States of Utrecht in the Summer of 1787, with rival States, one from [[Amersfoort]], the other from [[Utrecht]] city, vied for recognition as the "true" representatives of that province in the States General, van Beyma tried to do the same in Friesland.&lt;ref&gt;Colenbrander, p. 278&lt;/ref&gt;

About twelve Patriot ''volmachten'' went to Franeker to constitute themselves as the "Franeker" States in opposition to the rest of the ''volmachten'' who remained in Leeuwarden. Valckenaer opposed this, because he thought that militarily Harlingen, where the arsenal of the [[Admiralty of Friesland]] was located, was a better choice. The opportunity passed, however, when the Leeuwarden States had Harlingen occupied by States Army troops on 4 September 1787. Meanwhile, Franeker had been reinforced with Patriot militia from Holland, and the city prepared for a siege. While the Leeuwarden States recalled States Army troops, paid for by Friesland, to the province, both sides started [[Anathema|anathematizing]] each other, both claiming to be the "true and only legitimate" States of Friesland.&lt;ref&gt;Geyl, pp. 185-186&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the civil war could begin in earnest, however, the [[Prussian invasion of Holland]] started on 13 September 1787, and soon the resistance of the Frisian Patriots collapsed. Those that could get away, fled to Amsterdam, led by van Beyma and Valckenaer, to take part in the last stand of the Patriots.&lt;ref&gt;Colenbrander, p. 279&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of that city on 10 October 1787 most of the Frisian Patriots fled to France, where most congregated in Saint-Omer in the next few years, often feuding among themselves.

But they returned "with a vengeance" in 1795 when the old Republic was overturned by the [[Batavian Revolution]]. On 7 February 1795 a ''Committé Révolutionair Provinciaal'' met for the first time. This took over the powers of the Frisian States. Soon, after the example of the [[Provisional Representatives of the People of Holland]] a similar assembly of Provisional Representatives of the People of Friesland formally took over from the States on 19 February 1795.&lt;ref name="bestuur"/&gt; This was replaced by the National Assembly of the [[Batavian Republic]] in April 1796.

==Provincial States of Friesland in the Kingdom of the Netherlands==
The '''States of Friesland''' ({{lang-nl|Staten van Friesland}}, {{IPA-nl|ˈstaːtə(n) vɑn ˈfrislɑnt|pron}}) are the [[States-Provincial]] for the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Provinces of the Netherlands|province]] of [[Friesland]], first introduced under the [[Constitution of the Netherlands]] in 1814. It forms the legislative body of the province. Its 43 seats are distributed every four years in [[Provincial elections in the Netherlands|provincial elections]]. Since 2008, it is chaired by [[John Jorritsma]] ([[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy|VVD]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.johnjorritsma.nl/ |title = Commissaris van de Koning |website = Provinsje fryslân |accessdate= 29 June 2014 |language=Dutch }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chu comes from a family of scholars. His father, [[Ju-Chin Chu]], earned a [[D.Eng.|doctorate]] in [[chemical engineering]] from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] and taught at [[Washington University in St. Louis]] and [[Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute]], and his mother studied [[economics]]. His maternal grandfather, [[Shu-tian Li]], earned a Ph.D. from [[Cornell University]], and was a professor and president of Tianjin University ([[Peiyang University]]). His mother's uncle, [[Li Shu-hua]], a physical scientist, studied physics at the [[Sorbonne]] before returning to [[China]].&lt;ref name="Nobel" /&gt; Chu's older brother, [[Gilbert Chu]], is a professor of [[biochemistry]] and [[medicine]] at [[Stanford University]].  His younger brother, [[Morgan Chu]], is a partner and former co-managing partner at the [[law firm]] [[Irell &amp; Manella]].&lt;ref name="Irell&amp;Manella"&gt;{{cite web |publisher = [[Irell &amp; Manella|Irell &amp; Manella LLP]] |url = http://www.irell.com/professionals-22.html |title = Morgan Chu |accessdate = 2008-12-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Chu, his two brothers and four cousins have four Ph.D.s, three [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]]s, and a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] among them.

In 1997, he married Jean Fetter, a British-American [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]-trained physicist.&lt;ref name="Eljera" /&gt; He has two sons, Geoffrey and Michael, from a previous marriage to Lisa Chu-Thielbar.&lt;ref name="Nobel" /&gt;

Chu is interested in sports such as [[baseball]], [[swimming (sport)|swimming]], and [[cycling]]. He taught himself [[tennis]]—by reading a book—in the eighth grade, and was a second-string substitute for the school team for three years. He also taught himself how to [[pole vault]] using bamboo poles obtained from the local [[carpet]] store.&lt;ref name="Nobel" /&gt; Chu said he never learned to speak [[Chinese language|Chinese]] because his parents always spoke to their children in [[English language|English]].&lt;ref name="Eljera" /&gt;

==Career and research==
[[File:Steven Chu NSF.jpg|thumb|right|Steven Chu lecturing]]
After obtaining his doctorate he remained at Berkeley as a [[postdoctoral researcher]] for two years before joining [[Bell Labs]], where he and his several co-workers carried out his Nobel Prize-winning [[laser cooling]] work. He left Bell Labs and became a professor of physics at [[Stanford University]] in 1987,&lt;ref name="Nobel" /&gt; serving as the chair of its Physics Department from 1990 to 1993 and from 1999 to 2001. At Stanford, Chu and three others initiated the Bio-X program, which focuses on interdisciplinary research in biology and medicine,&lt;ref name="BioX"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biox.stanford.edu/about/index.html|title=About Bio-X|publisher=[[Stanford University]]|accessdate=2009-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and played a key role in securing the funding for the [[Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology]].&lt;ref name="chu-77"&gt;{{cite web|title=Steven Chu named director of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|url=http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2004/july7/chu-77.html|publisher=Stanford News Service|date=2004-06-21|accessdate=2009-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2004, Chu was appointed as the director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, a [[United States Department of Energy National Laboratories|U.S. Department of Energy National Laboratory]], and joined UC Berkeley's Department of Physics and Department of Molecular and Cell Biology.&lt;ref name="BerkeleyNews"&gt;{{cite news|title=Obama chooses Nobelist Steven Chu as secretary of energy|url=http://berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2008/12/15_obama.shtml|author=Robert Sanders|publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]]|date=2008-12-15|accessdate=2009-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Chu's leadership, the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has been a center of research into [[biofuel]]s and [[solar energy]].&lt;ref name="Hebert" /&gt; He spearheaded the laboratory's Helios project, an initiative to develop methods of harnessing solar power as a source of [[renewable energy]] for transportation.&lt;ref name="BerkeleyNews" /&gt;

Chu's early research focused on [[atomic physics]] by developing [[laser cooling]] techniques and the [[magneto-optical trap]]ping of atoms using [[lasers]]. He and his co-workers at Bell Labs developed a way to cool atoms by employing six laser beams opposed in pairs and arranged in three directions at right angles to each other. Trapping atoms with this method allows scientists to study individual atoms with great accuracy. Additionally, the technique can be used to construct an [[atomic clock]] with great precision.&lt;ref name="NobelPhys"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1997/press.html|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1997|publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]]|date=1997-10-15|accessdate=2009-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Stanford, Chu's research interests expanded into [[biophysics|biological physics]] and [[polymer physics]] at the [[single-molecule experiment|single-molecule level]]. He studied [[enzyme]] activity and [[Protein folding|protein and RNA folding]] using techniques like [[fluorescence resonance energy transfer]], [[atomic force microscopy]], and [[optical tweezers]]. His [[polymer physics]] research used individual [[DNA]] molecules to study polymer dynamics and their [[phase transitions]]. He continued researching atomic physics as well and developed new methods of laser cooling and trapping.&lt;ref name="BerkeleyBio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.berkeley.edu/research/faculty/chu.html|title=Steven Chu|publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]]|accessdate=2009-03-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090315153306/http://physics.berkeley.edu/research/faculty/chu.html|archivedate=2009-03-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His nomination to be Secretary of Energy was unanimously confirmed by the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] on January 20, 2009.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aFtD02yqOtMw|title=Senate Confirms Seven Obama Nominees, Delays Clinton|author=Nicholas Johnston|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]]|date=2009-01-20|accessdate=2009-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 21, 2009, Chu was sworn in as Secretary of Energy in the [[Barack Obama administration]]. Chu is the first person appointed to the U.S. Cabinet after having won a Nobel Prize.&lt;ref name="FirstNobel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2008/12/a-nobel-prize-w.html|title=A Nobel Prize Winner in the Cabinet|publisher=[[ABC News]]|author=[[Jake Tapper]]|date=2008-12-11|accessdate=2009-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also the second Chinese American to be a member of the U.S. [[United States Cabinet|Cabinet]], after former [[U.S. Secretary of Labor|Secretary of Labor]] [[Elaine Chao]].&lt;ref name=.&gt;{{cite news|author=Sky Canaves|title=Commerce Nominee a Locke In China|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=2009-02-26|accessdate=2009-03-23|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/chinajournal/2009/02/26/commerce-nominee-a-locke-in-china/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His scientific work continued, however, and he even published a paper on [[gravitational redshift]] in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in February 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature08776| title = A precision measurement of the gravitational redshift by the interference of matter waves| journal = Nature| volume = 463| issue = 7283| pages = 926–9| year = 2010| last1 = Müller | first1 = H. | last2 = Peters | first2 = A. | last3 = Chu | first3 = S. | pmid=20164925|bibcode = 2010Natur.463..926M }} According to Nature he worked on this "during nights, weekends and on planes – after putting in 70–80 hours a week as energy secretary"&lt;/ref&gt; and another one he co-authored in July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Borestein | first = Seth | agency = Associated Press | title = Energy secretary's hobby is nano science | work = MSNBC | accessdate = 2010-07-12 | date = 2010-07-07 | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/38130342/ns/technology_and_science-science/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature09163| title = Subnanometre single-molecule localization, registration and distance measurements| journal = Nature| volume = 466| issue = 7306| pages = 647–51| year = 2010| last1 = Pertsinidis | first1 = A. | last2 = Zhang | first2 = Y. | last3 = Chu | first3 = S. | pmid=20613725|bibcode = 2010Natur.466..647P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011 Chu said that regulators at the U.S. [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] should not delay approving construction licenses for planned U.S. nuclear power plants in the wake of the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]] in [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/15/us-usa-nuclear-licenses-idUSTRE72E6PM20110315 | work=Reuters | title=Japan crisis should not delay new U.S. reactors: Chu | date=2011-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2011 Chu praised an advisory panel report on curbing the environmental risks of [[natural-gas]] development. Chu responded to the panel's report on [[hydraulic fracturing]], the controversial drilling method that is enabling a U.S. gas boom while bringing fears of groundwater contamination. The report called for better data collection of air and water data, as well as "rigorous" air pollution standards and mandatory disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. Chu said that he would "be working closely with my colleagues in the Administration to review the recommendations and to chart a path for continued development of this vital energy resource in a safe manner".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Geman |first=Ben |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/e2-wire/677-e2-wire/177419-chu-vows-to-chart-a-path-for-safe-gas-drilling |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120724091107/http://thehill.com/blogs/e2-wire/677-e2-wire/177419-chu-vows-to-chart-a-path-for-safe-gas-drilling |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-24 |title=Chu vows to 'chart a path' for safe gas drilling |publisher=Thehill.com |date=2011-08-18 |accessdate=2012-01-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chu faced controversy for a statement he made prior to being appointed, claiming in a September 2008 interview with the Wall Street Journal that "somehow we have to figure out how to boost the price of gasoline to the levels in Europe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=King|first1=Bob|title=Chu's Europe gas quote haunts W.H. |url = http://www.politico.com/story/2012/02/chus-europe-gas-price-quip-still-haunts-obama-073138 |website=Politico|accessdate=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in March 2012 he retracted this comment, saying "since I walked in the door as secretary of Energy I've been doing everything in my powers to do what we can to … reduce those prices" and that he "no longer shares the view [that we need to figure out how to boost gasoline prices in America]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Guillén|first1=Alex |title=Chu walks back '08 gas prices quote |url = http://www.politico.com/story/2012/03/chu-walks-back-europe-gas-prices-quote-073934 |website=Politico|accessdate=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 12, 2013, Chu was the [[designated survivor]] during the [[2013 State of the Union Address|State of the Union address]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2013/02/12/steven-chu-is-designated-survivor-for-state-of-the-union/|title=Steven Chu is the State of the Union 'designated survivor'|last=Weiner|first=Rachel|website=Washington Post|access-date=2017-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 1, 2013, Chu announced his intent to resign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Energy Secretary Steven Chu to resign |url = http://www.politico.com/story/2013/02/energy-secretary-steven-chu-to-resign-87073.html?hp=l2 |publisher=Politico|accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt; In his resignation announcement, he warned of the risks of climate change from continued reliance on [[fossil fuels]], and wrote, "the [[Stone Age]] did not end because we ran out of stones; we transitioned to better solutions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Letter from Secretary Steven Chu to Energy Department Employees |url = http://energy.gov/articles/letter-secretary-steven-chu-energy-department-employees |publisher=energy.gov |accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned on April 22, 2013.

==Energy and climate change==
Chu has been a vocal advocate for more research into [[renewable energy]] and [[nuclear power]], arguing that a shift away from [[fossil fuels]] is essential to combat [[climate change]] and [[global warming]].&lt;ref name="Hebert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tribble"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Directors"/&gt; He also spoke at the 2009 and 2011 [[National Science Bowl]] about the importance of America's science students, emphasizing their future role in [[environmental planning]] and global initiative. Chu said that a typical [[coal power]] plant emits 100 times more radiation than a nuclear power plant.&lt;ref&gt;[https://blogs.wsj.com/environmentalcapital/2008/12/11/steven-chu-coal-is-my-worst-nightmare/ Steven Chu: ‘Coal is My Worst Nightmare’], Wall St. Journal, December 11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:OliverInderwildi-FatihBirol-StevenChu-OxfordUniversity.jpg|left|thumb|250px||Steven Chu (right) with IEA Executive Director [[Fatih Birol]] (middle) and Oliver Inderwildi (left) at the [[Oxford Union]], [[University of Oxford]] ]]
Chu warns that [[global warming]] could wipe out California farms within the century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Romm |first=Joe |url = http://climateprogress.org/2009/02/09/stephen-chu-la-times-interview-global-warming/ |title=Steven Chu's full global warming interview: "This is a real economic disaster in the making for our children, for your children."|publisher=Climateprogress.org |date=2009-02-09 |accessdate=2012-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He joined the [[Copenhagen Climate Council]], an international collaboration between business and science established to create momentum for the [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference|2009 UN Climate Change Conference]] in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]].&lt;ref name="Copenhagen"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.copenhagenclimatecouncil.com/about-us/councillors/steve-chu.html |archive-url = https://archive.is/20090105173421/http://www.copenhagenclimatecouncil.com/about-us/councillors/steve-chu.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-01-05 |title = Councillors: Steven Chu |publisher=Copenhagen Climate Council |accessdate=2008-12-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Chu signed the ''[[Mainau Declaration|Mainau Declaration 2015 on Climate Change]]'' on the final day of the 65th [[Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings|Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting]]. The declaration was signed by a total of 76 Nobel Laureates and handed to then-President of the French Republic, [[François Hollande]], as part of the successful [[Paris Climate Change Conference|COP21 climate summit]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mainaudeclaration.org/|title=Mainau Declaration|website=www.mainaudeclaration.org|access-date=2018-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chu was instrumental in submitting a winning bid for the [[Energy Biosciences Institute]], a [[BP]]-funded $500 million multidisciplinary collaboration between UC Berkeley, the Lawrence Berkeley Lab, and the [[University of Illinois]]. This sparked controversy on the Berkeley campus, where some fear the alliance could harm the school's reputation for academic integrity.&lt;ref name="Dalton"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1038/445688b|title = Berkeley's energy deal with BP sparks unease |journal = Nature |volume = 445 |issue = 7129 |pages = 688–689 |year = 2007 |last1 = Dalton |first1 = R. |bibcode = 2007Natur.445..688D |pmid = 17301752 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Michaels"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/environment/jan-june07/climatechange_05-02.html|title=Physicist Searches for Alternative Fuel Technologies|publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service]] |date=2007-05-02 |accessdate=2008-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gonzalez"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.ci.berkeley.ca.us/news/print.asp?id=20934 |author=Angel Gonzalez |title=BP Berkeley Venture Means Big Money, Big Controversy |publisher=City of Berkeley, Central Administrative Offices |date=2007-05-14 |accessdate=2008-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blumenstylk"&gt;{{cite news |author=Goldie Blumenstylk |url = http://chronicle.com/blogs/facevalue/index.php?id=683 |title=TV's Take on the Influence of Big Oil |publisher=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |date=2007-09-28 |accessdate=2008-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based partially on his research at UC Berkeley, Chu has speculated that a global "glucose economy", a form of a [[low-carbon economy]], could replace the current system. In the future, special varieties of high-[[glucose]] plants would be grown in the [[tropics]], processed, and then the chemical would be shipped around like [[Petroleum|oil is today]] to other countries. ''The [[St. Petersburg Times]]'' has stated that Chu's concept "shows vision on the scale needed to deal with global warming".&lt;ref name=ontap/&gt;

Chu has also advocated making the roofs of buildings and the tops of roads around the world white or other light colors, which may [[Reflective_surfaces_(climate_engineering)|reflect sunlight back into space]] and [[mitigate global warming]]. The effect would be, according to Chu, similar to taking every car in the world off the roads for about 11 years.&lt;ref name="ontap" /&gt; Samuel Thernstrom, a resident fellow at the [[American Enterprise Institute]] and co-director of its [[climate engineering|Geoengineering]] Project, expressed support for the idea in ''[[The American (magazine)|The American]]'', praising Chu for "do[ing] the nation a service" with the concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=''[[The American (magazine)|The American]]'' |url = http://www.american.com/archive/2009/june/white-makes-right-steven-chu2019s-helpful-idea |title=White Makes Right?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10946">'''Temple denial''' refers to the assertion that none of the [[Temples in Jerusalem]] ever existed or were not located on the [[Temple Mount]]. Israeli writer [[David Hazony]] has described the phenomenon as "a campaign of intellectual erasure [by Palestinian leaders, writers, and scholars] ... aimed at undermining the Jewish claim to any part of the land", and compared the phenomenon to [[Holocaust denial]].&lt;ref&gt;Hazony, David. "[http://www.nysun.com/article/49985 Temple Denial In the Holy City]", ''[[The New York Sun]]'', March 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gold, pp. 10 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniel Levin (writer)|Daniel Levin]] calls Temple denial a "relatively new phenomenon" that "has become a central tenet of [[Palestinian nationalism]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forward.com/articles/116770 Daniel Levin, Denial on the Temple Mount, The Forward, Oct. 23, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; He stated: "The [[Jerusalem Islamic Waqf|Islamic land trust]] is destroying Judeo-Christian ruins beneath the Temple Mount so as to deny any connection between Judaism and Christianity and Jerusalem."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.chicagojewishnews.com/story.htm?sid=5&amp;id=253204 |title='EMBERS' OF TRUTH IN NEW THRILLER |work=Chicago Jewish News |date=August 14, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014134653/http://www.chicagojewishnews.com/story.htm?sid=5&amp;id=253204 |archive-date=October 14, 2013 |access-date=December 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dore Gold]], president of the [[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]] and former [[Permanent Representative of Israel to the United Nations|Israeli ambassador to the United Nations]], used the term "Temple denial" in his 2007 book, ''The Fight for Jerusalem: Radical Islam, the West, and the Future of the Holy City''.

The ''New York Times'' noted that "Temple denial, increasingly common among Palestinian leaders, also has a long history: After Israel became a state in 1948, the Waqf removed from its guidebooks all references to King Solomon's Temple, whose location at the site it had previously said was "beyond dispute.""&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/23/world/middleeast/mistrust-threatens-delicate-balance-at-a-sacred-site-in-jerusalem-.html Mistrust Threatens Delicate Balance at a Sacred Site in Jerusalem, The New York Times, Nov. 22, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A Brief Guide to al-Haram al-Sharif'', a booklet published in 1925 (and earlier) by the "Supreme Moslem Council", a body established by the British government to administer [[waqf]]s and headed by Hajj [[Amin al-Husayni]] during the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]] period, states on page 4: "The site is one of the oldest in the world. Its sanctity dates from the earliest (perhaps from pre-historic) times. Its identity with the site of Solomon's Temple is beyond dispute. This, too, is the spot, according to universal belief, on which 'David built there an altar unto the Lord, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.'(''2 Samuel 24:25'')"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/what-is-beneath-the-temple-mount-920764/?device=ipad&amp;no-ist=&amp;page=3 |title=What is Beneath the Temple Mount? |author=Joshua Hammer |publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]] |access-date=December 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Gold and [[Dennis Ross]], at the [[2000 Camp David Summit]] [[Yasser Arafat]] insisted that "the Temple"  existed near [[Nablus]], not on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=Gold_11&gt;Gold, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Ross and Gidi Grinstein, reply by Hussein Agha and Robert Malley,  [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/14529 "Camp David: An Exchange,"] ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', September 20, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brit Hume, [http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,50830,00.html Interview] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090722060043/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,50830,00.html |date=2009-07-22 }} with [[Dennis Ross]], ''[[Fox News Sunday]]'', [[Fox News]], April 21, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  And in the recollection of [[Ehud Barak]], referring to a conversation he had with Clinton, Arafat said to the US President, "there is nothing there [i.e., no trace of a temple on the Temple Mount]." &lt;ref&gt;Benny Morris, [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2002/06/13/camp-david-and-after-an-exchange-1-an-interview-wi/ "Camp David and After: An Exchange (1. An Interview with Ehud Barak),"] ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', June 13, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Ross later wrote about an August 2000 meeting he had with Arafat: "Since we would be discussing the options on the Haram, I anticipated that Arafat might well again declare that the Temple—the most sacred place in Jewish tradition—did not exist in Jerusalem, but was in Nablus.... I wanted Gamal, a Christian of Coptic origin who was originally from Egypt, to tell Arafat that this was an outrageous attempt to delegitimize the Israeli connection to Jerusalem....  Finally, after nearly ten minutes of increasing invective, I intervened and said 'Mr. Chairman, regardless of what you think, the President of the United States ''knows'' that the Temple existed in Jerusalem. If he hears you denying its existence there, he will never again take you seriously. My advice to you is never again raise this issue in his presence.'"&lt;ref&gt;''The Missing Peace: The Inside Story of the fight for Middle East Peace'' by Dennis Ross (2004, {{isbn|0-374-19973-6}}), p. 718&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Gold, in the wake of Arafat's remark at Camp David, Temple denial "spread across the Middle East like wildfire", and even "subtly slipped into the writing of Middle-East based western reporters".&lt;ref name=Gold_12&gt;Gold, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, in a book entitled ''From Jerusalem to Mecca and Back; The Islamic Consolidation of Jerusalem'', [[Yitzhak Reiter]] describes the growing tendency of Islamic authorities to deny the existence of the Jewish Temples on the Temple Mount, characterizing it as part of a campaign to increase the status of Jerusalem and the Temple mount in Islam as part of the effort to make Jerusalem a Muslim city under Arab governance. According to Reiter, this narrative "reflects the mainstream in many Islamic communities around the world", and is promoted by "religious figures, politicians, academics and journalists".&lt;ref&gt;"From Jerusalem to Mecca and Back; The Islamic Consolidation of Jerusalem", Yitzhak Reiter, Jerusalem Institute for Israel Studies, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the beginning was Al-Aqsa; A new study exposes the systematic Muslim denial of the existence of Solomon's Temple by clergymen, historians and statesmen. Some claim that the mosque was built in the times of Adam, Nadav Shragai, Haaretz, Nov. 27, 2005, [http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/features/in-the-beginning-was-al-aqsa-1.175216]&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all Islamic scholars accept Temple denialism. Imam [[Abdul Hadi Palazzi]], leader of the Italian Muslim Assembly and a co-founder and a co-chairman of the Islam-Israel Fellowship, quotes the [[Quran]] to support Judaism's special connection to the Temple Mount. According to Palazzi, "[t]he most authoritative Islamic sources affirm the Temples". He adds that Jerusalem is sacred to Muslims because of its prior holiness to Jews and its standing as home to the biblical prophets and kings David and Solomon, all of whom he says are sacred figures also in Islam. He claims that the Quran "expressly recognizes that Jerusalem plays the same role for Jews that Mecca has for Muslims".&lt;ref name="margolis"&gt;

==Journalistic response==
In October 2015, the ''[[New York Times]]'' published an article stating that "The question, which many books and scholarly treatises have never definitely answered, is whether the 37-acre site, home to Islam's sacred Dome of the Rock shrine and al-Aqsa Mosque, was also the precise location of two ancient Jewish temples, one built on the remains of the other, and both long since gone."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Historical Certainty Proves Elusive at Jerusalem’s Holiest Place (original version) | newspaper=The New York Times | date=8 October 2015 | author=Gladstone, Rick}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a few days, the newspaper responded to feedback by changing the text to "The question, which many books and scholarly treatises have never definitively answered, is where on the 37-acre site, home to Islam’s sacred Dome of the Rock shrine and Al Aqsa Mosque, was the precise location of two ancient Jewish temples, one built on the remains of the other, and both long since gone."&lt;ref name=NYT2&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/09/world/middleeast/historical-certainty-proves-elusive-at-jerusalems-holiest-place.html | title=Historical Certainty Proves Elusive at Jerusalem’s Holiest Place | publisher=The New York Times | work=Newspaper | date=8 October 2015 | accessdate=14 October 2015 | author=Gladstone, Rick}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ngo"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/biblical-sites-places/temple-at-jerusalem/contested-temple-mount-history/ | title=Contested Temple Mount History? | publisher=Bible History Daily | work=Website | date=13 October 2015 | accessdate=14 October 2015 | author=Ngo, Robin}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few weeks later, the newspaper further corrected the story, backdating the Islamic [[waqf]] that controls the site from 1967 to 1187.&lt;ref name=NYT2/&gt;

'''Titan Rain''' was the designation given by the [[federal government of the United States]] to a series of coordinated attacks on American [[computer]] systems since 2003; they were known to have been ongoing for at least three years.&lt;ref name="Bodmer, Kilger 2012"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bodmer |first1=Sean |last2=Kilger |first2=Max |last3=Carpenter |first3=Gregory |last4=Jones |first4=Jade |date=July 24, 2012 |title=[[Reverse Deception: Organized Cyber Threat Counter-Exploitation]] |place=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill Osborne Media |isbn=0071772499}}, {{ISBN|978-0071772495}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attacks were labeled as [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] in origin, although their precise nature, e.g., state-sponsored [[espionage]], [[corporate espionage]], or random [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]] attacks, and their real identities&amp;nbsp;– masked by proxy, [[Zombie (computer science)|zombie]] computer, spyware/virus infected&amp;nbsp;– remain unknown. The activity known as "Titan Rain" is believed to be associated with an [[Advanced Persistent Threat]].

Titan Rain hackers gained access to many United States [[defense contractor]] computer networks who were targeted for their sensitive information,&lt;ref name="Bodmer, Kilger 2012"/&gt; including those at [[Lockheed Martin]], [[Sandia National Laboratories]], [[Redstone Arsenal]], and [[NASA]].

== Attackers ==
The series of attacks are believed by some to be the actions of the [[People’s Liberation Army]] (PLA), rather than some freelance Chinese hackers. These hackers attacked both the American (''[[Defense Intelligence Agency]]'' – DOD) and British Government Departments ([[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] – MOD). The British government had an incident in 2006 where a part of the House of Commons computer system was shut down by - initially thought to be an individual – an “organised Chinese hacking group.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Norton-Taylor |first=Richard |date=September 5, 2007 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2007/sep/04/news.internet |title=Titan Rain - how Chinese hackers targeted Whitehall |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although most of the evidence has pointed to the Chinese government as the attackers, the Chinese government has claimed that it was not them who attacked the United States, leading to another possibility that it was hackers using Chinese computers.

== Consequences ==

‘Titan Rain’ has caused friction between the U.S. and Chinese governments, and the U.S. government has blamed the Chinese government for the attacks of 2004 on the unclassified, although potentially fatal information. Adam Paller, SANS Institute research director, stated that the attacks came from individuals with “intense discipline,” and that, “no other organisation could do this if they were not a military”. Such sophistication and evidence has pointed toward the Chinese military (People’s Liberation Army) as the attackers. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Homeland Security News Wire |date=December 14, 2005 |url=http://www.homelandsecuritynewswire.com/lesson-titan-rain-articulate-dangers-cyber-attack-upper-management |title=The lesson of Titan Rain: Articulate the dangers of cyber attack to upper management |access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

‘Titan Rain’ reportedly attacked multiple high-end political systems, such as NASA and the FBI. Although no sensitive and classified information was reported stolen, the hackers were however able to steal unclassified information (e.g. information from a home computer). The fact that the information was classified or not was somewhat irrelevant; when it all comes together it could reveal the strengths and weaknesses of the U.S., making such an attack very damaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=Dvice |date=September 22, 2010 |url=http://www.dvice.com/archives/2010/09/7_of_the_most_d.php |title=The 7 worst cyberattacks in history (that we know about)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112155600/http://www.dvice.com/archives/2010/09/7_of_the_most_d.php |archive-date=November 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The US Treasury Department.jpg|thumb|The U.S. Department of the Treasury, Washington, D.C.]]

‘Titan Rain’ has caused distrust between other countries (such as the United Kingdom and Russia – other superpowers) and China. Such distrust has occurred because these countries were likely attacked, but either did not detect an attack or have not released statements that they were attacked. The United Kingdom have stated officially that their governmental offices were attacked by hackers of a Chinese source. The events of ‘Titan Rain’ have caused the rest of the world to be more cautious of attacks; not just from China, but from other countries as well, thereby causing, however small, a slight distrust between other countries. This distrust between them may affect future agreements and dealings and as such further affect their relationship with China.

== Alternative cases ==
One alternative to the People’s Liberation Army carrying out the attacks is hackers using Chinese computers and websites to carry out the attack. It has been long known that many Chinese computers and websites are very insecure. Hackers use the website/system to attack a targeted system. This makes it look as if it was a Chinese system attacking the target, and not the hacker. This method allows a hacker to attack a system without his/her location being revealed. [[People’s Republic of China]] (PRC) have argued that this method had been used to attack the U.S. and other locations targeted by ‘Titan Rain’. This has, however, sparked controversy as to who actually caused the events of ‘Titan Rain’ – the Chinese or a bored hacker?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Thornburgh |first=Nathan |date=September 5, 2005 |url=http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/csep590/05au/readings/titan.rain.htm |title=The Invasion of the Chinese Cyberspies (And the Man Who Tried to Stop Them) |newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, to support Adam Paller’s idea of the attackers having to be a large, organised body with “intense discipline,” it is possible such an organisation could have exploited these insecure computers, servers and websites to attempt to steal sensitive information from the United States and other targets. 
A rogue state and/or a large, sophisticated collection of hackers could have used these insecurities in China’s computers to attack the targets, rather than China themselves being the attacker. Using this method of using China’s computers means that this organisation can hide themselves while making an effective attack, all with relative ease. Such a plot protects the hackers but put the Chinese government in a predicament where they cannot prove that they did not do the attack, causing tensions between the United States and China.

The '''Turkmen Brigades''' are [[Iraqi Turkmens|Iraqi Turkmen]] militias as part of the [[Popular Mobilization Forces]] formed in 2014.

The group's commander, Said  Yilmaz Najar, rejected proposals of an unified Turkmen militia from the [[Iraqi Turkmen Front]], saying that his group has both [[Shia]] and [[Sunni]] Turkmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aa.com.tr/en/world/iraqi-turkmen-to-take-part-in-mosul-attack/49126|title=Iraqi Turkmen to take part in Mosul attack|work=AA|date=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 September 2016, 16th Brigade has announced that the militias will participate the [[Hawija offensive (2017)|Hawija Offensive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wr-news.net/arabic/reports/2192|title=بالفيديو: لواء 16 الحشد الشعبي قوة التركمان تعلن استعدادها الكامل للمشاركة في عمليات تحريرى الحويجة|work=WR news|date=25 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2896">'''The Young, Gifted &amp; Talented Programme''' (YG&amp;T) was a United Kingdom government scheme that aimed to enhance the educational development of students between the ages of 4 and 19. The scheme was established in 2002, and scrapped in 2010 in favour of reallocating funds to help disadvantaged students get into University.

== Inclusion policy ==
Within the scheme, a young and gifted individual is defined as: "...children and young people with one or more abilities developed to a level significantly ahead of their year group (or with the potential to develop those abilities)”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ygt.dcsf.gov.uk/DynamicPage.aspx?pageId=8|title=The Young Gifted &amp; Talented programme |work=ygt.dcsf.gov.uk|accessdate=2008-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Entrance to the scheme is via a validation process performed by the student's school or college and is based on criteria including:

* For students aged between 4–11, there is no set percentage and they are identified by their performance and ability relative to their cohort.
* For students aged between 11–19, that they fall within the top 5% of students as identified by the national eligibility criteria provided by [[DCSF|The Department for Children, Schools and Families]] (DCSF). Alternatively they can be selected by the use of local sectional that identifies them as above average in their cohort within their school age group.

While the onus is on schools to determine the size of their gifted and talented population, clear justification for the size of the group and the benefit to all members must be clearly identified. The DCSF uses 10% of any given school population as the assumption of size during the planning process.

== Operations ==

The operations of the programme are [[Outsourcing|outsourced]] to the [[CfBT Education Trust]] who took over the National Programme for Gifted and Talented Education in September 2007 and renamed it to the Young, Gifted &amp; Talented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfbt.com/teach/giftedtalentededucation.aspx|title=Young, Gifted &amp; Talented Programme|publisher=CfBT Educational Trust|accessdate=2008-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program also supports the activities of private organisations in providing training activities and materials to the identified student groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/the-city-highflyer-who-went-back-to-school-856432.html|title=The City high-flyer who went back to school|last=Baker|first=Martin|date=2008-06-29|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=2008-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
