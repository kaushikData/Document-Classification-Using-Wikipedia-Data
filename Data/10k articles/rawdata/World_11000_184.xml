'''ATOMKI''' is the  '''Institute for Nuclear Research, [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]]'''. The institute was established in 1954 by [[Sándor Szalay (physicist)|Sándor Szalay]] the founder director.

ATOMKI became independent from the Institute of Experimental Physics of the Kossuth Lajos University (presently called [[University of Debrecen]]), where Sándor Szalay started and directed [[nuclear physics]] research for decades. At present, the main research fields of Atomki are atom-, nuclear-, and particle physics, ion beam analytics, technique of detection and signal processing, environmental analytics, radioactive dating, radiochemistry, and solid state physics. The director is Zsolt Dombrádi, [[Doctor of Sciences|D.Sc.]].

Some of its buildings were originally the National Orphanage for Teachers' Children, built in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Old photos|url=http://www.atomki.hu/regi_kepek/index_en.html|work=ATOMKI|accessdate=27 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Battle of the Gulf''' ({{Lang-is|Flóabardagi}}) was a naval battle on 25 June 1244 in [[Iceland]]'s [[Húnaflói]] Bay, during the [[Age of the Sturlungs]] civil war. The conflicting parties were the followers of [[Þórður kakali Sighvatsson]] and those of [[Kolbeinn ungi Arnórsson]]. Þórður's men were from the [[Westfjords]] of Iceland, while Kolbeinn's were northerners. The primary weapons were rocks hurled between boats. A detailed description of the battle can be found in ''[[Sturlunga saga]]''.

'''Belgrade Design Week''' is an international festival established in 2005, and held once a year in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]]. The week-long conference is organized every spring and is the largest design initiative in South Eastern Europe. It covers architecture, design, fashion, publishing, and new media, as well as related fields like communications, marketing, advertising, and arts management.  The event includes design labs, competitions, and presentations from international speakers like [[Karim Rashid]] and [[Daniel Libeskind]].

During the rest of the year, there are related projects such as promoting local designers, holding a branding competition for the Serbian Center for the Promotion of Science, and participating in the Partners of the Human Cities/ Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belgradedesignweek.com/projects/|title=Projects|date=14 July 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humancities.eu/story/belgrade-design-week-welcomes-the-city-of-kragujevac-to-the-human-cities-family/|title=Belgrade Design Week welcomes the City of Kragujevac to the Human Cities/ family!|website=humancities.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="belgradedesignweek.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belgradedesignweek.com/interview-with-jovan-jelovac-narativ/|title=INTERVIEW WITH JOVAN JELOVAC – NARATIV|date=1 November 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization also spearheaded the Belgrade 2020 project, promoting the city as a candidate for the [[European Capital of Culture]].&lt;ref name="belgradedesignweek.com"/&gt;

== History ==
First held in 2005, Belgrade Design Week festival was founded by brand consultant [[Jovan Jelovac]], a formally trained architect.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.disegnodaily.com/article/belgrade-design-week|title=Belgrade Design Week|website=DisegnoDaily}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The conference costs about half a million euros to produce and is supported mostly through commercial and media sponsorships.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For Jelovac, education was the primary reason for launching the summit, as well as inspiring the country's citizens through design. In 2014, the president of Serbia, [[Tomislav Nikolić]], presided over the event, mentioning how design can contribute to the country's economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belgradedesignweek.com/the-ninth-belgrade-design-week-launched/|title=THE NINTH BELGRADE DESIGN WEEK LAUNCHED-DIZAJN PARK MAGAZINE|date=29 July 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, designer [[Karim Rashid]] was the ambassador for the second Belgrade Design Week and spoke at the conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/the-king-of-kool-is-so-over-new-york/article667234/|title=The King of Kool is so over New York|last=|first=|date=2008-02-02|work=The Globe and Mail|access-date=2018-04-06|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, he later headed several design projects in Serbia's capital city.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/11/on-the-verge-belgrade-europes-latest-urban-success-story/|title=On the Verge {{!}} Belgrade, Europe's Latest Urban Success Story|last=Beaumanis|first=Viia|date=2013-10-11|website=T Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rashid stated that he is fascinated by Belgrade and Eastern Europe in general, seeing it "as the next upcoming place - everyone is psyched and enthusiastic about the rebuilding of these poetic, romantic, artistic and very intellectual places."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sajkaca.blogspot.ca/2008/05/karim-rashid-goes-belgrade_18.html|title=Karim Rashid goes Belgrade|website=sajkaca.blogspot.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/05/five-emerging-fashion-capitals-worth-knowing.html|title=Five Emerging Fashion Capitals Worth Knowing|work=pastemagazine.com|access-date=2018-04-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/design/moma-yugoslavia-new-exhibition-architecture-concrete-brutalism-celebrate-new-york-photography-a8178471.html|title=New MoMA exhibition celebrates the concrete world of Yugoslavia|date=2018-01-25|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-04-06|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After attending the design festival in 2008, architect [[Daniel Libeskind]] left with a billion dollar, albeit controversial, commission to redevelop the Belgrade waterfront.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/dec/10/belgrade-waterfront-gulf-petrodollars-exclusive-waterside-development|title=Belgrade Waterfront: an unlikely place for Gulf petrodollars to settle|first=Herbert|last=Wright|date=10 December 2015|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lukabeograd.com/en/city-on-wather/master-plan/strategy.html|title=Luka Beograd :: Strategy|website=www.lukabeograd.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major projects like this one are contributing to the renewal of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://viaggi.corriere.it/viaggi/weekend/belgrado-hotel-ristoranti/?refresh_ce-cp|title=La nuova Belgrado: cosa vedere, gli hotel e i ristoranti|date=14 July 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other skyscrapers and shopping malls are in the planning stages, and architectural masterpieces, like the Art Nouveau "Geozavod" building, are being restored.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  Belgrade is being compared to 1990's Berlin, seen as a decaying but alive metropolis: "Recently, the gritty city has emerged as an outpost of creative activity and urban cool on the cheap, against the lingering backdrop of socialism."

== About ==
The principal site of the festival changes annually with various run-down or abandoned buildings being renovated for the event. Past locations have included a palace, the bombed out hotel Jugoslavija, an abandoned department store,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.designboom.com/design/belgrade-design-week-09-the-location/|title=belgrade design week 09  the location|date=31 May 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the closed contemporary art museum, and an old factory.&lt;ref name="designboom.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.designboom.com/design/belgrade-design-week-2014-conferences-brand-new-world-10-05-2014/|title=belgrade design week 2014 conferences open up a brand new world|date=5 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every year, the conference also focuses on a common thread, for example, in 2013 the unifying theme was the square shape.&lt;ref name="glassrpske"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.glassrpske.com/plus/intervju/Jovan-Jelovac-Dizajn-nije-umetnost-nego-biznis/lat/110507.html|website=glassrpske.com|title=Jovan Jelovac: Dizajn nije umetnost nego biznis|accessdate=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately thirty international speakers present each year and cover a wide range of subjects, helping to promote cultural exchanges between Serbia and the rest of the world. Notable designers and artists who have spoken at the event include [[Konstantin Grcic]], [[Aylin Langreuter]], [[Christophe de la Fontaine]], [[Hella Jongerius]], [[Daan Roosegaarde]], [[Ross Lovegrove]]. [[Christophe Pillet]], [[Sacha Lakic]] and [[Patricia Urquiola]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In addition to the presentations, there are numerous workshops and design competitions, as well as exhibits from designers such as Israeli Eilon Armon and Swiss architect duo Lang/Baumann.&lt;ref name="designboom.com"/&gt;

'''Blink''' was one of the largest [[online community]] in [[Norway]] with over 350,000 active members (7.74% of the Norwegian population). It was created by Fredrik Kristiansen and Morten Mitch Larød, and released on February 1, 2002. Over the following two years, the community became twice as popular as any other Norwegian community.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} The community was finally closed down at the end of 2011, due to a mass flight of users to competitors like Facebook. After this flight, the 4,000 active members were not enough for the community to remain viable and it was therefore closed down.

'''Burkina Faso–Denmark relations''' refers to the [[bilateralism|current and historical relationship]] between [[Burkina Faso]] and [[Denmark]]. Burkina Faso has an embassy in [[Copenhagen]], and Denmark has an embassy in [[Ouagadougou]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ambaburkina.dk/intro.html Burkina Faso embassy in Copenhagen]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ambouagadougou.um.dk/da/ Danish embassy in Ouagadougou &amp;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100916233029/http://www.ambouagadougou.um.dk/da/ |date=September 16, 2010 }} {{fr icon}} {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assistance==
Burkina Faso has, since 1973, been in a development cooperation with Denmark, and a programme country since 1993. Assistance for Burkina Faso was 233 million DKK in 2010; in 2013, Denmark assisted with 250 million [[Danish krone|DKK]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.dk/samling/20101/almdel/uru/bilag/52/928712.pdf History between Burkina Faso and Denmark]&lt;/ref&gt;

Denmark's main support is towards poverty reduction, through the Danish and Burkinabe Development Cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netpublikationer.dk/um/7647/pdf/87-7667-646-3.pdf Burkina Faso - Denmark Partnership] {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Denmark also has an agriculture programme in Burkina Faso.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netpublikationer.dk/um/9115/html/entire_publication.htm#Section11.5 Danish assistance with Agriculture]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Capra Grigia''', {{lang-fr|'''Chèvre grise des montagnes'''|italic=no}}, {{lang-de|'''Graue Bergziege'''|italic=no}},{{r|dad}} is a rare and endangered indigenous [[breed]] of [[goat|domestic goat]] from Switzerland. It originates in the valleys of the [[canton (administrative division)|cantons]] of the [[Grisons]] or Graubünden in the eastern part of the country, and of [[Ticino]] or Tessin in the south.{{r|szzv}} It is possibly related to the grey type of the [[Passeirer Gebirgsziege]] from the [[Autonomous Province of Bolzano]] in north-eastern Italy.{{r|save}}

==History==

Documentation of the Capra Grigia in the valleys of the Ticino and the Grisons goes back more than 100 years. Three regional types were distinguished: the Bleni-Valmaggia or Lavizzarer, the Liviner or Misoxer, and the Riveria.{{r|save}} The breed was not recognised in the reorganisation of Swiss goat breeds in 1938, and infection with [[caprine arthritis encephalitis]] in the mid-twentieth century contributed to its near-total disappearance.{{r|cgs}} The Swiss association [[ProSpecieRara]] launched a conservation and recovery project for the Capra Grigia in 1997, recorded all surviving members in a [[herd-book]], and started a controlled [[breeding programme]]. [[Breed standard]]s were formulated in 2005, and in 2006 the Capra Grigia was officially recognised as a Swiss breed.{{r|psr|page=112|cabi|page2=367}} In 2007 the total number registered was 190, and the [[conservation status]] was listed by the [[FAO]] as "critical-maintained".{{r|barb|cabi|page2=367}} In 2008, five apparently similar goats were discovered in the [[Valchiavenna]] in Italy, which increased the gene pool.{{r|psr}} In 2011 a breed association, Capra Grigia Schweiz, was formed.{{r|psr2}}

At the end of 2011 a population of 475–490 was reported to [[DAD-IS]].{{r|dad}}

== Characteristics ==

The Capra Grigia is sure-footed and agile, with hard hooves well-suited to the high mountain terrain of the southern Alps. The horns are strong, and grow upwards and outwards. The coat colour is similar to that of the Austrian {{ill|Blobe Ziege|de}}: it varies from a mottled dark grey to a pale silver-white; the legs are dark grey or black, and there is a dark [[dorsal stripe]].{{r|cabi|page=367}}

'''Celje National Hall''' ({{lang-sl|Narodni dom}}) is a city hall in [[Celje]], a town in central-eastern [[Slovenia]]. It was built between 1895 and 1896 and today hosts the seat of a township. It was designed by the Czech [[architect]]s [[Jan Vladimír Hráský]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|Jan Vejrych|cs}} and was a multimodal building. Such [[national hall]]s were typical of the [[Slovene Lands]] of the period.

The '''Constitutive Act of the African Union''' sets out the codified framework under which the [[African Union]] is to conduct itself. It was signed on 11 July 2000 at [[Lomé]], [[Togo]]. It entered into force after two thirds of the 53 signatory states ratified the convention. When a state ratifies the Constitutive Act, it formally becomes a member of the AU. All 53 signatory states have ratified the document.

The only states in Africa that have neither signed nor ratified the document are [[Morocco]] and [[South Sudan]]. South Sudan has been admitted as a member of the AU but has not yet ratified the Constitutive Act.

The '''corridinho''' is a form of [[Portugal|Portuguese]] dance, namely in the [[Algarve]]. It is [[dance]]d with the pairs always embraced, forming a circle, girls inside and the boys outside the circle. By rotating the circle the pairs evolve side by side. At a certain time, when the music as a stronger beat, their feet hit the floor more intensely, stopping the rotation, to resume afterwards. Further away in the dance, the pairs embraced [[waltz]] by spinning in the same place. Next the circle starts rotating again always for the right side. It is a very traditional dance in Portugal that Portuguese people like doing.  Besides, you also see people enjoying the dance in the past Portuguese empire states like [[Goa]], [[Daman and Diu]], [[Dadra and Nagar Haveli]], small part of [[Ceylon]] (Sri Lanka) and [[Macau]] (China).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9704">A '''cross-border region''' is a [[territorial entity]] that is made of several local or regional authorities that are co-located yet belong to different nation states.

== Cross-border regions in Europe ==

In Europe, there are a large number of cross-border regions. Some of them are often referred to as '[[Euroregion]]s' although this is an imprecise concept that is used for a number of different arrangements. European cross-border regions are most commonly constituted through co-operation among border municipalities, districts or regions. 

Many cross-border regions receive financial support from the European Commission via its [[Interreg]] programme. They vary in their legal and administrative set-up but have in common that they are not 'regions' in an administrative-constitutional sense. Many cross-border regions are based on some sort of civil-law agreements among the participating authorities. For instance, the classical form of a Euroregion is the ‘twin association’: On each side of the border, municipalities and districts form an association according to a legal form suitable within their own national legal systems.  In a second step, the associations then join each other on the basis of a civil-law cross-border agreement to establish the cross-border entity. Many Euroregions along the Germany-Benelux border are established according to this model, following the initiatives by the [[EUREGIO]].

== History ==

The first European cross-border region, the EUREGIO,&lt;ref&gt;Perkmann, M, Construction of new territorial scales: A framework and case study of the EUREGIO cross-border region, Regional Studies, 2007, Vol: 41, Pages: 253 - 266.[http://sites.google.com/site/markusperkmann/Home/cross-border-regions/Constructionofnewterritorialscales.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; was established in 1958 on the Dutch-German border, in the area of Enschede (NL) and Gronau (DE). Since then, Euroregions and other forms of cross-border co-operation have developed throughout Europe. 

For local and regional authorities, engaging in cross-border regions meant they entered a field long reserved for central state actors. For dealing with issues such as local cross-cross-border spatial planning or transport policy, in the 1960s and 1970s various bi-lateral and multi-lateral governmental commissions were established without granting access to local authorities (Aykaç 1994). They dealt with issues such as local cross-border spatial planning and transport policy. 

But over the last thirty years the scope for non-central governments (NCGs) to co-operate across borders has widened considerably. To a large degree, this can be related to macro-regional integration in Europe. In particular, two supranational bodies, the Council of Europe and the European Union, were important for improving the conditions under which NCGs could co-operate across borders. Whereas the Council of Europe was in past particularly active in improving the legal situation, the Commission of the European Union new provides substantial financial support for CBC initiatives. 

Legally, the first cross-border regions were based on agreements with varying degrees of formality and mostly relied on good will. In 1980, on the initiative of the Council of Europe, the so-called Madrid Convention ([[Outline Convention on Transfrontier Co-operation]]) was introduced as a first step towards CBC structures based on public law. The convention has been signed by 20 countries and was more recently updated with two Additional Protocols. It provides a legal framework for completing bi- and multinational agreements for public law CBC among NCGs. Examples for such agreements are the BENELUX Cross-border Convention of 1989 and the German-Dutch cross-border treaty of 1991. The Euroregion Rijn-Waal on the Dutch-German border has been such a cross-national public body since 1993. However, the regulations delivered by such agencies are binding only on the public authorities within the cross-border area concerned and not on civil subjects (Denters et al. 1998). 

Compared with the Council of Europe, the CBC-related activities of the EU are primarily financial. Many CBC initiatives are eligible for support under the Interreg Community Initiative launched by the European Commission in 1990; this policy was re-confirmed as Interreg II in 1994 and as Interreg III in 1999.

== Types of European cross-border regions  ==

There are several ways in which cross-border regions can be distinguished. First, they vary in geographic scope. Small-scale initiatives such as the EUREGIO can be distinguished from larger groupings, such as the 'Working Communities'. The latter – most of them were founded between 1975 and 1985 – usually comprise several regions forming large areas that can stretch over several nation states. Examples of Working Communities are the Arge Alp, the Alpes-Adria, the Working Community of the Western Alps (COTRAO), the Working Community of the Pyrenees or the Atlantic Arc. Their organizational structures usually consist of a general assembly, an executive committee, thematic working groups and secretariats (Aykaç, 1994: 12–14), but activities tend to be confined to common declarations and information exchange. However, some groupings, such as the Atlantic Arc, succeeded in obtaining European funds (Balme et al., 1996).

Smaller initiatives are technically referred to as micro cross-border regions [http://hdl.handle.net/10044/1/1407] but for simplicity they can be called Euroregions. Euroregions have a long tradition in certain areas of post-war Europe, especially on the Germany–BENELUX border where the expressions ‘Euroregion’ and ‘Euregio’ were invented. Organizationally, Euroregions usually have a council, a presidency, subject-matter oriented working groups and a common secretariat. The term Euroregion can refer both to a territorial unit, comprising the territories of the participating authorities, and an organizational entity, usually the secretariat or management unit. 

Legally, the cooperation can take different forms, ranging from legally non-binding arrangements to public-law bodies. The spatial extension of micro-CBRs will usually range between 50 and 100&amp;nbsp;km in width; and they tend to be inhabited by a few million inhabitants. In most cases, the participating authorities are local authorities, although in other cases regional or district authorities are involved. Occasionally, third organizations, such as regional development agencies, interest associations and chambers of commerce, have become official members. The organizational set-up can also differ from the original model inspired by the Dutch–German EUREGIO. 

Cross-border regions also differ in terms of how closely the participating parties work with each other. While some initiatives hardly go beyond ceremonial contacts, others are engaged in enduring and effective collaboration. For estimating the co-operation intensity of existing CBC arrangements, a catalogue of criteria proposed by the AEBR can be used:&lt;ref&gt;Association of European Border Regions and European Commission (1997) Practical Guide to Cross-border Cooperation. Enschede: AEBR.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
* co-operation based on some type of legal arrangement, common permanent secretariat controlling its own resources;
* existence of an explicitly documented development strategy;
* broad scope of co-operation in multiple policy areas, similar to conventional local or regional authorities.

A third way of distinguishing cross-border regions considers the nature of the participating authorities. Most of the small-scale initiatives involve local authorities as the driving protagonists whereas large-scale CBC is almost exclusively driven by regional authorities. There is variance in this respect,  depending on the territorial organization of different European countries. For instance, in Germany, local administration comprises two levels, the municipalities and the Kreise, with the latter being self-governed groupings of municipalities. In most cases, the Kreise are the driving force behind cross-border initiatives. By contrast, in Italy, it is meso-level authorities, the 'province' (provinces), that are usually involved in cross-border cooperation initiatives while the municipalities play a minor role because of their relative fragmentation compared to the German Kreise. In Scandinavia, as for instance in the Øresund region, both counties and large urban municipalities (Greater Copenhagen) participate in the cooperation arrangement. In general, in countries with a strong role for inter-municipal associations, cross-border co-operation is often pursued by local actors. By contrast, in countries with a two-tier regional administration and a minor role for inter-local action (such as Italy or France), cross-border regions are a domain pursued by regional authorities.

'''Elion Enterprises Limited''', or '''Elion''' for short, was the largest telecommunications and [[Internet service provider]] in [[Estonia]]. It was owned by Eesti Telekom (now [[Telia Eesti]]), which until September 2009 was listed at the stock exchanges of Tallinn (ETLAT) and [[London Stock Exchange|London]] (EETD), and was bought by the [[TeliaSonera]] group.

The Elion Group's consolidated revenues for 2007 were 2.98 billion [[Estonian kroon|kroons]] (191 million [[euro]]s), making it one of the largest companies in Estonia. It had 1,533 employees at the end of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elion.ee/wwwmain?screenId=html.general-profile.21341&amp;locale=en About Elion: General Information and Management]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 May 2011, Elion, like all other TeliaSonera group companies, changed its logo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uudised.err.ee/index.php?06228666 Elion logo change]&lt;/ref&gt; The logo change reportedly cost Elion and [[EMT (mobile operator)|EMT]] 700,000 euros.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.battleit.eu/emt-ja-elion-tulevad-valja-uute-pakkumistega-vahetasid-logo/&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 January 2016, the company, along with mobile services provider [[EMT (mobile operator)|EMT]] were merged under the [[Telia Company|Telia]] name, along with parent company Eesti Telekom becoming Telia Eesti.

'''Act 1696''', or the '''Flag Act''', (Philippine Commission Act № 1696, August 23, 1907) is an act of the [[Philippine Commission]] that outlawed the display of [[Katipunan]] flags, banners, emblems, or devices in the [[American Colonial Period (Philippines)|American-controlled]] [[Insular Government|Philippine Islands]]. Both the current national anthem, ''[[Lupang Hinirang]]'', and the present-day [[Flag of the Philippines]], were covered by this ban.

The Flag Act was repealed by the [[Philippine Legislature]] in 1919.

'''"Frauen regier'n die Welt"''' ([[English language|English]]: "Women rule the World", official translation: "Guess Who Rules the World") was [[Germany]]'s entry for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2007]] in [[Helsinki]]. 
It was performed by German swing singer [[Roger Cicero]] and written by Matthias Hass and Frank Ramond. Cicero performed 16th during the contest and came 19th (out of 24) in the voting.

The lyrics were criticised by Germany's feminist magazine EMMA. They voted Roger Cicero "Pasha of the Month" (a title for men who display chauvinist attitudes) because of the song's lyrics. They were of the opinion that the line “''Und schon öffnen sich Tasche und Herz und dann kaufst du ´n Ring und ´n Nerz''“ (translation: And soon your wallet and heart open and then you buy a ring and mink coat) is antiquated. (EMMA Magazine Issue 3/2007)

The song was succeeded as the [[Germany in the Eurovision Song Contest|German representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008]] by [[No Angels]] with "[[Disappear (No Angels song)|Disappear]]".

A '''karvalakki''' ({{lang-fi|furry cap}}) is a [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]]-shaped, [[fur]]ry [[forage cap]]-styled hat typically worn in parts of [[Finland]] and [[Russia]]. Finnish TV presenter [[Hannu Karpo]] often wore a karvalakki on his show, ''[[Karpolla on asiaa]]''.

In Finnish, the expression ''karvalakkimalli'' ("furry cap model") means a bare-bones, no-frills model, meaning the cheapest and most basic model that just works and does nothing extra. The term can also be used to describe anything that is very basic.

The '''"Kingdom of Wallachia"''' ({{lang-cs|Valašské Kralovství}}), named after the region of [[Moravian Wallachia]], is a [[tongue-in-cheek]] [[micronation]] that was founded in 1997 by the photographer Tomáš Harabiš as an "elaborate practical joke". The location is in the northeast corner of the [[Czech Republic]], 230 miles from Prague. Since foundation a reported 80,000 Czech citizens have acquired "Wallachian Passports".&lt;ref name=RadioPraha&gt;[http://www.radio.cz/en/article/107855 Court to hear appeal in "Wallachian Kingdom" dispute, Rod Cameron, Radio Praha, 2 September 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the official proclamation of the Wallachian kingdom in 1997, actor [[Bolek Polívka]] was enthroned as '''King Boleslav I''' ''the Gracious'' with his coronation occurring at a lavish ceremony in 2000. The "Government" led by Tomáš Harabiš established state institutions and issued passports to around 80,000 officially Czech citizens. A new currency, the '''Jurovalsar''', was launched which was pegged to the [[euro]] at a rate of 1:1. Enthusiastic attempts to forge official ties with other countries have so far proved disappointing and the Kingdom of Wallachia enjoys no formal diplomatic recognition.

== Constitutional Crisis of 2001 ==

In 2001 the Wallachian "government" deposed King Boleslav in a [[palace coup]], accusing the fallen monarch of behaving unconstitutionally by demanding 1,000,000 [[Czech koruna]] for his services.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/coup-in-fantasy-kingdom-inside-czech-republic-959310.html Coup in a fantasy kingdom inside the Czech Republic (The Independent, 2008-10-13)]&lt;/ref&gt; Unperturbed, the deposed king travelled the realm gathering support for his restoration claiming that he had actually ascended the throne in 1993 some four years before the formation of the Harabiš government, and business venture. The ex-king also claimed the idea for the kingdom was his.&lt;ref name=RadioPraha/&gt; Unable to settle the dispute internally, the case was taken to court in 2007 in [[Ostrava]], Czech Republic. The court ruled in favour of the "government" of Tomáš Harabiš which went on to search for a new candidate for the throne, eventually crowning Vladimír Zháněl as '''King Vladimír II'''. Since then the former king, Bolek Polívka, has appealed to the Czech High Court.

=== "Kings of Wallachia" ===
* '''Boleslav I''', 1997–2001 ([[Deposition (politics)|deposed]]). The start of Boleslav's reign is disputed, with the former monarch claiming it began in 1993.
* '''Vladimír II''', 2001–present.

The '''Noefefan Bridge''' is a bridge over the [[Tono River]], in [[Oecusse]], [[East Timor]]. It was inaugurated on 10th June 2017 by the president of Timor-Leste, [[Francisco Guterres]].&lt;ref name="zeesm"&gt;[https://www.zeesm.tl/opened-noefefan-bridge-tono/ Noefefan Bridge inaugurated]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 3-arched bridge —which is 380 meters long and 20 meters high— connects [[Citrana]], [[Passabe]] and other isolated regions west of the Tono River to the regional capital of [[Pante Macassar]], providing them permanent access to markets, the ferry and airport, even on the rainy season (November to April).&lt;ref name="zeesm" /&gt;

'''''Red Shambhala: Magic, Prophesy, and Geopolitics in the Heart of Asia''''' is a 2011 non-fiction work by [[Andrei Znamenski]]. The book explores the links between [[Bolshevik]] revolutionaries and their attempt to influence [[Vajrayana Buddhism]] in [[Mongolia]] and [[Tibet]], as well as indigenous shamanic elements in the [[Russian Far East]]. In particular, some elements within the Bolsheviks were interested in using the apocalyptic [[Shambhala]] prophesies of the [[Kalachakra Tantra]] to influence the Buddhists into supporting [[Marxist-Leninism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/slavic-review/article/red-shambhala-magic-prophecy-and-geopolitics-in-the-heart-of-asia-by-znamenski-andrei-wheaton-111-quest-books-2011-xxv-268-pp-notes-index-illustrations-photographs-map-1795-paper/77DB54D2FD6CDD437CAD6BEF22AD3D46|publisher=Cambridge Core - Slavic Review|title=Red Shambhala: Magic, Prophecy, and Geopolitics in the Heart of Asia.

{{Politics of the European Union}}

The [[European Union]] created a [[Committee of the Regions]] to represent '''Regions of Europe''' as the layer of EU government administration directly below the [[nation-state]] level. The Committee has its headquarters in [[Brussels]].

Reasons given for this include:
* the historic and cultural claims for autonomy in many regions all over the EU
* strengthening the political and economic situation in those regions

The term 'region' as used here includes [[England]], [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]] which are non-sovereign [[countries]], referred to as separate countries, even though collectively they form the country known as the [[United Kingdom]] they are [[Countries of the United Kingdom|recognised as countries]] by the [[UK Government]] and are not referred to as [[regions]].

Some nation states which have historically had a strong centralized administration have transferred political power to the regions. Examples of this include the devolution of power in the UK (the [[Scotland Act 1998]], the [[Government of Wales Act 1998]]) and the current negotiations in France concerning increased autonomy for [[Corsica]]. Some other states have traditionally had strong regions, such as the [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] or the [[autonomous communities]] of [[Spain]]; yet others have been structured on the basis of national and municipal government with little in between.

==Competence==
Regional and local authorities elect delegates to the [[Committee of the Regions]]. The Committee is a consultative body, and is asked for its opinion by the Council or the Commission on new policies and legislation in the following areas:
* Education
* Training
* Culture
* Public Health
* Anti-drug support
* Trans-European Networks
* Social and Economic Cohesion
* Structural Funds

On certain issues it works in partnership with the [[Economic and Social Committee]].

== Political influence ==
The politics of regionalism has also had an impact at the pan-European level. The regions of Europe had lobbied for an increased say in EU affairs, especially the German Länder. This resulted in the creation by the [[Maastricht Treaty]] of the [[Committee of the Regions]], and provision for member states to be represented in the Council by ministers from their regional governments.

The [[Council of Europe]] also has a [[Congress of the Council of Europe|congress of local and regional authorities]], similar to the EU's [[Committee of the Regions]].

Strengthening economic competition between communities further supports the creation of authentic regions within the EU and almost all EU member states recently have or currently are re-organizing their administration to create competitive EU regions. 
Often these regions better reflect culture and identity and a sense of common interests.

Of the major organisations representing the regions of Europe, the [[Assembly of European Regions]] (AER) is the largest. Established in 1985, the organisation now brings together over 270 regions from 33 countries, along with 16 interregional associations, across wider Europe.
Apart from playing a key role as the regions' political voice on the European stage, AER is a forum for interregional cooperation in numerous areas of regional competence, including economic development, social policy, public health, culture, education and youth. The organisation is also a key defender of the [[subsidiarity]] principle in Europe, lobbying for its inclusion in the EU treaties and demanding recognition of the word in dictionaries via the worldwide "Subsidiarity is a word" movement.

Outside EU institutions, the [[Council of European Municipalities and Regions]] (CEMR-CCRE) is the largest organisation of local and regional government in Europe; its members are national associations of towns, municipalities and regions from over 35 countries. Together these associations represent some 100,000 local and regional authorities.

CEMR works to promote a united Europe that is based on local and regional self-government and democracy. To achieve this goal it endeavours to shape the future of Europe by enhancing local and regional contribution, to influence European law and policy, to exchange experience at local and regional level and to cooperate with partners in other parts of the world.

[[File:United Nations Security Council.JPG|thumb|250px| The United Nations Security Council Chamber in New York, also known as the Norwegian Room]]
'''Security studies''', also known as '''International security studies''', is traditionally held to be an academic sub-field of the wider discipline of [[international relations]].&lt;ref&gt;Wæver, Ole (2004) "New 'Schools' in Security Theory and their Origins between Core and Periphery" Paper presented at the annual meeting of the International Studies Association, Le Centre Sheraton Hotel, Montreal, Quebec&lt;/ref&gt; The field rapidly developed within [[international relations]] during the [[Cold War]], and examples from the era can be considered to include the academic works of mid-20th century [[Realism (international relations)|Realist]] political scientists such as [[Thomas Schelling]]&lt;ref&gt;http://openvault.wgbh.org/catalog/V_5293F77426B84C68A360BD6283ACF4FC&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Henry Kissinger]],&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=e-kgAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA88&amp;lpg=PA88&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; whose works focused primarily on [[nuclear deterrence]]. While the field is mostly contained within [[political science]] and [[public policy]] programs, it is increasingly common to take an interdisciplinary approach that incorporates knowledge from the fields of [[history]], [[geography]] (stressing classical [[geopolitics]]), military sciences, and [[criminology]].

While the field (much like its parent field of international relations) is often meant to educate students who aspire to professional careers in [[think tanks]], [[consulting]], [[defense contractors]], [[Human Rights]] [[NGO]]s or in [[government]] service positions focused on [[diplomacy]], [[foreign policy]], [[conflict resolution]] and prevention, emergency and [[disaster management]], [[intelligence]], and [[National security|defense]], it can also be tailored to students seeking to professionally conduct academic research within academia, or as [[public intellectuals]], [[pundits]] or [[journalists]] writing about security policy. 

At its core, international security studies, as an area of inquiry, takes organized violence as its focus, and the steps individuals and aggregations of individuals can take to both employ organized violence effectively and, much more importantly, to protect themselves from organized violence (accumulation of knowledge in the former being essential for the accumulation of knowledge in the latter). Thus subjects can range from the micro—weapons types, effectiveness, tactics, human-weapons interfaces, individual and group motivations—to the macro; including the causes of war, nuclear strategy, military doctrine, defense spending, and conventional and unconventional warfare strategies. 

More recently, however, these traditional approaches to security have been supplemented (one leaves the utility open to argument) by variants such as [[critical security studies]], and the [[Copenhagen School (international relations)|Copenhagen School]]. Clearly useful contributions to our understanding of insecurity and security have also come from [[constructivism (international relations)]], [[Peace Studies|peace studies]] and [[critical theory]]. As implied by the close association of the Cold War with the advent and establishment of international security studies as such, broader historical trends (or rather perceptions of them) created the openings that these alternative schools have sought, with mixed effect, to provide an array of theoretical foundations. 

Contemporary security studies is therefore as contested a field of inquiry as it is both interesting and important.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul (2012) ''Security Studies: An Introduction'', Abingdon: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

It will be used to relay signals for the [[United States Air Force]] Navstar [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS).&lt;ref name="Boeing"&gt;{{cite web |title=Global Positioning System (GPS) IIF |url=http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/space/gps/index.html |publisher=Boeing |accessdate=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The satellite was launched at 03:00 [[UTC]] on 28 May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/air-force-new-gps-satellite-launch-100527.html |title=Air Force Launches Advanced New GPS Satellite |author=Tariq Malik |publisher=SPACE.com |date=28 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It will be placed into plane B of the GPS constellation, and will transmit the PRN-25 signal. PRN-25 was previously broadcast by [[USA-79]], which was retired in late 2009 after almost eighteen years of service.

==Spacecraft==
USA-213 is a {{convert|1630|kg|adj=on}} spacecraft, which is expected to remain in service for at least twelve years. In addition to broadcasting the same signals as previous satellites, it will also broadcast the [[GPS signals#L5, Safety of Life|L5 signal]], and a military signal known as [[GPS signals#Military (M-code)|M-code]]. Its signal accuracy is expected to be twice that of its predecessors.&lt;ref name="MOB"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission Overview|url=http://www.ulalaunch.com/site/docs/missionbooklets/DIV/div_gpsiifsv1_mob.pdf|work=Delta IV Launches GPS IIF SV-1|publisher=United Launch Alliance|accessdate=27 May 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6JfECDdka?url=http://www.ulalaunch.com/site/docs/missionbooklets/DIV/div_gpsiifsv1_mob.pdf|archivedate=16 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the sixty-first GPS satellite to be launched, and the fiftieth Block II spacecraft.

GPS IIF spacecraft are built by [[Boeing]],&lt;ref name="Boeing"/&gt; under a contract which was originally signed in 1996. At the time, thirty three satellites were planned, however this has since decreased to twelve.

==Launch==
GPS IIF SV-1 was launched on a [[United Launch Alliance]] [[Delta IV|Delta IV-M+(4,2)]] rocket, flying from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 37|Space Launch Complex 37B]] at the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]].&lt;ref name="MOB"/&gt; This made it the first GPS satellite to be launched on an [[Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle]], and the first time since 1985 that anything other than a [[Delta II]] had been used to launch one.

The launch occurred successfully at 03:00 UTC on 28 May 2010, at the start of a nineteen-minute launch window.&lt;ref name="ULA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Delta IV Set to Launch GPS IIF SV-1|url=http://www.ulalaunch.com/site/pages/Launch.shtml#/8/|publisher=United Launch Alliance|accessdate=27 May 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110901221606/http://www.ulalaunch.com/site/pages/Launch.shtml#/8/|archivedate=1 September 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally scheduled to occur in 2006, however program and engineering delays resulted in it slipping to 2010.&lt;ref name="GSORG"&gt;{{cite web|last=Pike|first=John|title=GPS Block II F|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/systems/gps_2f.htm|publisher=Globalsecurity.org|accessdate=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first launch attempt was made on 21 May 2010, during a [[launch window]] opening at 03:25 UTC and closing at 03:43. A problem with spacecraft [[telemetry]] was detected, but resolved in time for an attempt to be made at the end of the window, however it recurred during the last minutes of the countdown. With no launch window remaining, the launch was scrubbed.&lt;ref name="CFN-23A"&gt;{{cite web|title=Delta IV Rocket To Launch Sunday |url=http://www.cfnews13.com/Space/DestinationSpace/2010/5/21/delta_4_carrying_gps_satellite_set_to_launch_tonight.html |publisher=Central Florida News 13 |accessdate=27 May 2010 |date=23 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525184936/http://www.cfnews13.com/Space/DestinationSpace/2010/5/21/delta_4_carrying_gps_satellite_set_to_launch_tonight.html |archivedate=May 25, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch was rescheduled for 24 May, between 03:17 and 03:35 UTC, but scrubbed early in the countdown to allow further time to resolve the problem which had occurred during the previous attempt.&lt;ref name="CFN-23B"&gt;{{cite web |title=Delta IV Rocket Launch Scrubbed For Sunday |url=http://www.cfnews13.com/Space/DestinationSpace/2010/5/23/delta_iv_rocket_launch_scrubbed_for_sunday.html |publisher=Central Florida News 13 |accessdate=27 May 2010 |date=23 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527061802/http://www.cfnews13.com/Space/DestinationSpace/2010/5/23/delta_iv_rocket_launch_scrubbed_for_sunday.html |archivedate=May 27, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An attempt on 25 May, targeting the start of an eighteen-minute window at 03:13, resulted in a scrub after a hold was called less than ten seconds before the rocket was scheduled to launch, due to a problem with the thrust vectoring of the solid rocket motors. Launch attempts on 26 and 27 May&lt;!--UTC--&gt; were not possible as the [[Eastern Range]] had to be reconfigured to support the final landing of {{OV|104}}, returning from [[STS-132]].&lt;ref name="MSC"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ray|first=Justin|title=Mission Status Center|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/delta/d349/status.html|work=Delta Mission Report|publisher=Spaceflight Now|accessdate=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike earlier GPS satellites, which were launched on [[Atlas E/F]] and [[Delta II]] rockets, GPS IIF SV-1 was placed directly into its operational orbit, eliminating the need for an [[apogee motor]].

== Operational status ==
After the launch the satellite underwent a testing period which was scheduled to last between 90 and 120 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailytech.com/First+Block+2F+GPS+Satellite+Launched+Needed+to+Prevent+System+Failure/article18483.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530023659/http://www.dailytech.com/First+Block+2F+GPS+Satellite+Launched+Needed+to+Prevent+System+Failure/article18483.htm |archivedate=2010-05-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was declared operational 27 August 04:10 UTC.&lt;ref name="NANU 2010113"&gt;{{cite web|title=NOTICE ADVISORY TO NAVSTAR USERS (NANU) 2010113|url=https://gps.afspc.af.mil/gps/archive/2010/NANUS/2010113.nnu|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130408132016/https://gps.afspc.af.mil/gps/archive/2010/NANUS/2010113.nnu|archivedate=2013-04-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Él"''' ({{IPA-es|ˈel}}, "{{lang|en|He}}") was the [[Spain|Spanish]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1982]], performed in [[Spanish Language|Spanish]] by [[Lucía (singer)|Lucía]].

The song was performed twelfth on the night, following [[Belgium]]'s [[Stella Maessen|Stella]] with "[[Si tu aimes ma musique]]" and preceding [[Denmark]]'s [[Brixx]] with "[[Video, Video]]". At the close of voting, it had received 52 points, placing 10th in a field of 18. Votes came from nine countries, the highest score being ten points from Cyprus.

In the song, Lucía is a young student who has to decide between two men. While the one (''él'' – "he") seems to be caring and understanding, but also "intends to be my owner", the other (''tú'' – "you") rather seems to look for a [[one-night stand]]: "You phone me and forget me". Still, the girl is more interested in the latter of the two and invites him to come to her place that evening "from eight to ten". Then she has to study and make up her mind.

The music was a [[Tango music|tango]] which partially caused a sensation because the Song Contest took place in Britain, and many connected tango to Argentina, with whom Britain was at war at that time (see [[Falklands War]]).

"Él" was succeeded as [[Spain in the Eurovision Song Contest|Spanish representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1983|1983 Contest]] by [[Remedios Amaya]] with "[[¿Quién maneja mi barca?]]".
