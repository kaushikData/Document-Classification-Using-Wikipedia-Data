The '''A363''' is a main road in the [[United Kingdom]], which runs through [[Bath and North East Somerset]] and [[Wiltshire]]. It provides a link between the small [[market town]]s of West Wiltshire and Bath, the [[M4 motorway|M4]] westbound, and the [[M5 motorway|M5]]. It runs from the [[A4 road (Great Britain)|A4]] at [[Bathford]] to the [[A350 road|A350]] at [[Yarnbrook]], running through [[Bradford-on-Avon]] and [[Trowbridge]] on the way. It also links [[Westbury, Wiltshire|Westbury]] by merging with the A350.

==Route==

The road starts off bypassing Bathford to the west. It then climbs up the hill known locally as ''Sally in the Woods'', on the edge of the [[Cotswolds]] [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]], which has been the scene of a fatal accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisbath.co.uk/news/Police-appeal-fatal-accident/article-1785106-detail/article.html |title=Woman cyclist killed in crash|publisher=Bath Chronicle|accessdate=14 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The road summits at the turn-off to [[Monkton Farleigh]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiltshire.gov.uk/community/getcom.php?id=165|title=Monkton Farleigh|publisher=Wiltshire County Council|accessdate=11 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; at an altitude of 144 metres. After this, the road quality improves in that it widens and is straighter. This continues up to the approach to Bradford-on-Avon. Through Bradford-on-Avon itself, the road descends a steep 1 in 7 (14%) hill, known as ''Masons Lane''. This is the road's main bottleneck since this leads to Bradford-on-Avon's one and only vehicle bridge over the River Avon (which splits the town in two), and at this stage travelers have merged with traffic from [[Melksham]], [[Corsham]] and [[Chippenham, Wiltshire|Chippenham]] ([[List of B roads in Great Britain|B3109]]) which is fed here.

The road passes on towards Trowbridge. 1/4 mile (400 m) after ''Town Bridge'', the traffic to [[Frome]] splits off upon the restart of the B3109 which had been concurrent with the A363 for a short distance, thus easing congestion. The road passes over a low hill, then descends into Trowbridge.

It is concurrent for a short distance with the [[A361 road|A361]], then emerges as ''Bradley Road''. There are three roundabouts as the road goes through North Bradley via the White Horse Business Park, to the south. Until the 1980s it passed through North Bradley's residential lane, but since the opening of the business park, the older road through North Bradley became declassified and no longer has A- or B-road status. The A363, then terminates at a roundabout with the A350, in Yarnbrook.

When it was first designated in the 1920s, the road continued on from Yarnbrook as far as [[Chippenham]], but by 1948 this stretch had been redesignated as a continuation of the [[A350 road|A350]].

'''Active optics''' is a [[technology]] used with [[reflecting telescope]]s developed in the 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hardy|first=John W.|title=Active optics: A new technology for the control of light|date=June 1977|series=Proceedings of the IEEE|pages=110|url=http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA339170|bibcode=1978IEEEP..66..651H|journal=|access-date=2011-06-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222112555/http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA339170|archive-date=2015-12-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which actively shapes a telescope's [[mirror]]s to prevent deformation due to external influences  such as wind, temperature, mechanical stress. Without active optics, the construction of 8 metre class telescopes is not possible, nor would telescopes with segmented mirrors be feasible.

This method is used by, among others, the [[Nordic Optical Telescope]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last=Andersen|first=T.|author2=Andersen, T.|author3= Larsen, O. B.|author4= Owner-Petersen, M.|author5= Steenberg, K.|title=Active Optics on the Nordic Optical Telescope|conference=ESO Conference and Workshop Proceedings|date=April 1992|series=Progress in Telescope and Instrumentation Technologies|pages=311–314|editor1-first=Marie-Helene|editor1-last=Ulrich|bibcode=1992ESOC...42..311A}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[New Technology Telescope]], the [[Telescopio Nazionale Galileo]] and the [[Keck telescope]]s, as well as all of the largest telescopes built since the mid-1990s.

Active optics is not to be confused with [[adaptive optics]], which operates at a shorter timescale and corrects atmospheric distortions.

== In astronomy ==
[[File:Prototype of part of the adaptive support system of the E-ELT.jpg|thumb|Prototype of part of the adaptive support system of the [[E-ELT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ESO Awards Contract for E-ELT Adaptive Mirror Design Study|url=http://www.eso.org/public/announcements/ann12032/|accessdate=25 May 2012|newspaper=ESO Announcements}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

Most modern telescopes are reflectors, with the [[Primary mirror|primary element]] being a very large [[mirror]].  Historically, primary mirrors were quite thick in order to maintain the correct surface figure in spite of forces tending to deform it, like wind and the mirror's own weight.  This limited their maximum diameter to 5 or 6 metres (200 or 230&amp;nbsp;inches), such as [[Palomar Observatory]]'s [[Hale telescope]].

A new generation of telescopes built since the 1980s uses thin, lighter weight mirrors instead. They are too thin to maintain themselves rigidly in the correct shape, so an array of [[actuator]]s is attached to the rear side of the mirror. The actuators apply variable forces to the mirror body to keep the reflecting surface in the correct shape over repositioning. The telescope may also be segmented into multiple smaller mirrors, which reduce the sagging due to weight that occurs for large, monolithic mirrors.

The combination of actuators, an image quality [[detector]], and a computer to control the actuators to obtain the best possible image, is called ''active optics''.

The name ''active'' optics means that the system keeps a mirror (usually the primary) in its optimal shape against environmental forces such as wind, sag, thermal expansion, and telescope axis deformation. Active optics compensate for distorting forces that change relatively slowly, roughly on timescales of seconds. The telescope is therefore ''actively'' still, in its optimal shape.

=== Comparison with adaptive optics ===

Active optics should not be confused with [[adaptive optics]], which operates on a much shorter timescale to compensate for atmospheric effects, rather than for mirror deformation. The influences that active optics compensate (temperature, gravity) are intrinsically slower (1&amp;nbsp;Hz) and have a larger amplitude in aberration. Adaptive optics on the other hand corrects for [[Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric]] distortions that affect the image at 100–1000&amp;nbsp;Hz (the [[Greenwood frequency]],&lt;ref&gt;

depending on wavelength and weather conditions). These corrections need to be much faster, but also have smaller amplitude. Because of this, adaptive optics uses smaller [[Deformable mirror|corrective mirrors]]. This used to be a separate mirror not integrated in the telescope's light path, but nowadays this can be the [[Secondary mirror|second]],&lt;ref&gt;

== Other applications ==
Complicated laser set-ups and interferometers can also be actively stabilized.

A small part of the beam leaks through beam steering mirrors and a four-quadrant-diode is used to measure the position of a laser beam and another in the focal plane behind a lens is used to measure the direction.  The system can be sped up or made more noise-immune by using a [[PID controller]]. For pulsed lasers the controller should be locked to the repetition rate. A continuous (non-pulsed) pilot beam can be used to allow for up to 10&amp;nbsp;kHz bandwidth of stabilization (against vibrations, air turbulence, and acoustic noise) for low repetition rate lasers.

Sometimes [[Fabry–Pérot interferometer]]s have to be adjusted in length to pass a given wavelength. Therefore, the reflected light is extracted by means of a [[Faraday rotator]] and a [[polarizer]]. Small changes of the incident wavelength generated by an [[acousto-optic modulator]] or [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] with a fraction of the incoming radiation delivers the information whether the Fabry Perot is too long or too short.
 
Long [[optical cavity|optical cavities]] are very sensitive to the mirror alignment. A control circuit can be used to peak power. One possibility is to perform small rotations with one end mirror. If this rotation is about the optimum position, no power oscillation occurs. Any beam pointing oscillation can be removed using the beam steering mechanism mentioned above.

[[X-ray]] active optics, using actively deformable grazing incidence mirrors, are also being investigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research Partnership Advances X-ray Active Optics|url=http://www.adaptiveoptics.org/News_0305_1.html|work=adaptiveoptics.org|accessdate=2 June 2011|archiveurl=http://www.mssl.ucl.ac.uk/smartoptics/Newsletter/SO_Newsletter_7.pdf|date=March 2005|archivedate=March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Apollo 13''''' is a 1995 American space [[docudrama|docudrama film]] directed by [[Ron Howard]] and starring [[Tom Hanks]], [[Kevin Bacon]], [[Bill Paxton]], [[Gary Sinise]], and [[Ed Harris]]. The screenplay by [[William Broyles, Jr.]], and [[Al Reinert]] dramatizes the aborted 1970 [[Apollo 13]] lunar mission and is an adaptation of the book ''[[Lost Moon|Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13]]'' by astronaut [[Jim Lovell]] and [[Jeffrey Kluger]]. The film depicts [[astronaut]]s Lovell, [[Jack Swigert]], and [[Fred Haise]] aboard Apollo 13 for America's third Moon landing mission. En route, an on-board explosion deprives their spacecraft of most of its oxygen supply and electric power, forcing [[NASA]]'s flight controllers to abort the [[Moon landing]], and turning the mission into a struggle to get the three men home safely.

Howard went to great lengths to create a technically accurate movie, employing [[NASA]]'s technical assistance in astronaut and flight controller training for his cast, and obtaining permission to film scenes aboard a [[reduced gravity aircraft]] for realistic depiction of the "[[Free fall|weightlessness]]" experienced by the astronauts in space.

Released to cinemas in the United States on June 30, 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=apollo13.htm|title=Apollo 13|publisher=Box Office Mojo|language=English|date=30 June 1995|accessdate=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Apollo 13'' was nominated for nine [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] (winning for [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound]]).&lt;ref name="Oscar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org|title=Academy Awards, USA: 1996|publisher=awardsdatabase.oscars.org|accessdate=8 April 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723203650/http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ |archivedate=July 23, 2008 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, the film grossed over $355 million worldwide during its theatrical releases. The film was very positively received by critics.

== Plot ==
&lt;!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400-700 words. --&gt;

In July 1969, astronaut [[Jim Lovell]] hosts a [[house party]] where guests watch [[Neil Armstrong]]'s televised first human steps on the Moon. Afterwards Lovell, who had orbited the Moon on [[Apollo 8]], tells his wife Marilyn that he intends to return to the Moon to walk on its surface.

Three months later, as Lovell conducts a VIP tour of NASA's [[Vertical Assembly Building]], his boss [[Deke Slayton]] informs him that because of problems with [[Alan Shepard]]'s crew, his crew will fly Apollo 13 instead of 14. Lovell, [[Ken Mattingly]], and [[Fred W. Haise, Jr.|Fred Haise]] train for their new mission. A few days before launch, Mattingly is exposed to [[rubella|the measles]], and the flight surgeon demands his replacement with Mattingly's backup, [[Jack Swigert]]. Lovell resists breaking up his team, but relents when Slayton threatens to bump his crew to a later mission. As the launch date approaches, Marilyn has a nightmare about her husband getting killed in space, but goes to the [[Kennedy Space Center]] the night before launch to see him off.

On April 11, 1970, Flight Director [[Eugene F. Kranz|Gene Kranz]] gives the go-ahead from Houston's [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|Mission Control Center]] for the Apollo 13 launch. As the [[Saturn V]] rocket climbs through the atmosphere, a second stage engine cuts off prematurely, but the craft reaches its Earth parking orbit. After the third stage fires to send Apollo 13 to the Moon, Swigert performs the [[transposition, docking, and extraction|maneuver]] to connect the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command/Service Module]] ''Odyssey'' to the [[Lunar Module]] ''Aquarius'' and pull it away from the spent rocket.

Three days into the mission, the crew makes a television transmission, which the networks decline to broadcast live. After Swigert turns on the [[liquid oxygen]] tank stirring fans as requested, one of the tanks explodes, emptying its contents into space and sending the craft tumbling. The other tank is soon found to be leaking. They attempt to stop the leak by shutting off fuel cells #1 and #3, but to no avail. With the fuel cells closed, the Moon landing must be aborted, and Lovell and Haise must hurriedly power up ''Aquarius'' to use as a "lifeboat" for the return home, as Swigert shuts down ''Odyssey'' before its battery power runs out. In Houston, Kranz rallies his team to come up with a plan to bring the astronauts home safely, declaring "failure is not an option". Controller [[John Aaron]] recruits Mattingly to help him invent a procedure to restart ''Odyssey'' for the landing on Earth.

As Swigert and Haise watch the Moon pass beneath them, Lovell laments his lost chance of walking on its surface, then turns their attention to the business of getting home. With ''Aquarius'' running on minimal electrical power, the crew suffers freezing conditions, and Haise contracts a urinary infection and a fever. Swigert suspects Mission Control is withholding their inability to get them home; Haise angrily blames Swigert's inexperience for the accident; and Lovell quickly squelches the argument. When [[carbon dioxide]] approaches dangerous levels, ground control must quickly invent a way to make the Command Module's square filters work in the Lunar Module's round receptacles. With the guidance systems on ''Aquarius'' shut down, the crew must make a difficult but vital course correction by manually igniting the Lunar Module's engine.

Mattingly and Aaron struggle to find a way to turn on the Command Module systems without drawing too much power, and finally transmit the procedure to Swigert, who restarts ''Odyssey'' by transferring extra power from ''Aquarius''. When the crew jettisons the Service Module, they are surprised to see the extent of the damage. As they release ''Aquarius'' and re-enter the Earth's atmosphere, no one is sure that ''Odyssey''{{'}}s [[ablative heat shield|heat shield]] is intact. The tense period of radio silence due to [[ionization blackout]] is longer than normal, but the astronauts report all is well and splash down in the Pacific Ocean.

As helicopters bring the three men aboard the recovery ship [[USS Iwo Jima (LPH-2)|USS ''Iwo Jima'']] for a hero's welcome, Lovell's voice-over describes the subsequent investigation into the explosion, and the careers of Haise, Swigert, Mattingly, and Kranz. He wonders if and when mankind will return to the Moon.

The real Jim Lovell appears as captain of the recovery ship [[USS Iwo Jima (LPH-2)|USS ''Iwo Jima'']]; Howard had intended to make him an admiral, but Lovell himself, having retired as a captain, chose to appear in his actual rank. Horror film director [[Roger Corman]], a mentor of Howard, appears as a congressman being given a VIP tour by Lovell of the [[Vehicle Assembly Building]], as it had become something of a tradition for Corman to make a cameo appearance in his protégés' films.&lt;ref name="https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128873305"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128873305 | title=Repertoire Of Horrors: The Films Of Roger Corman | accessdate=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DVDHowardCommentary"&gt;{{cite video | title = Apollo 13: 2-Disc Anniversary Edition (Disc 1), Special Features: Commentary track by Ron Howard | medium = DVD  | publisher = [[Universal Studios]]  | date=19 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The real Marilyn Lovell appeared among the spectators during the launch sequence.&lt;ref name="DVDLovellCommentary" /&gt; CBS News anchor [[Walter Cronkite]] appears in archive news footage and can be heard in newly recorded announcements, some of which he edited himself to sound more authentic.&lt;ref name="DVDLovellCommentary" /&gt;

In addition to his brother, Clint Howard, several other members of Ron Howard's family appear in the movie:
* [[Rance Howard]] (his father) appears as the Lovell family minister.
* [[Jean Speegle Howard]] (his mother) appears as Lovell's mother Blanch.
* Cheryl Howard (his wife) and [[Bryce Dallas Howard]] (his daughter) appear as uncredited background performers in the scene where the astronauts wave goodbye to their families.&lt;ref name="DVDHowardCommentary" /&gt;
[[Brad Pitt]] was offered a role in the film, but turned it down to star in ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Se7en]]''.&lt;ref name="http://www.quickoverview.com/overviews/brad-pitt-overview.html"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.quickoverview.com/overviews/brad-pitt-overview.html | title=Brad Pitt – A Quick Overview | accessdate=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reportedly, the real Pete Conrad expressed interest in appearing in the film.&lt;ref name="DVDLovellCommentary" /&gt;

[[Jeffrey Kluger]] appears as a television reporter.&lt;ref name="DVDHowardCommentary" /&gt;

== Production ==

=== Preproduction and props ===

The screenplay by William Broyles, Jr. and Al Reinert was rewritten by [[John Sayles]] after Hanks had been cast and construction of the spacecraft sets had begun.&lt;ref name="Sayles"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=Mary|last2=Neff|first2=Renfreu|last3=Mercurio|first3=Jim|last4=Goldsmith|first4=David F.|title=John Sayles on Screenwriting|url=https://creativescreenwriting.com/john-sayles-on-screenwriting/|accessdate=2 October 2017|work=Creative Screenwriting|date=April 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While planning the film, director Ron Howard decided that every shot of the film would be original and that no mission footage would be used.&lt;ref name="DVDProductionNotes"&gt;{{cite video | title = Apollo 13: 2-Disc Anniversary Edition (Disc 1), Production Notes | medium = DVD | publisher = [[Universal Studios]] | date=19 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spacecraft interiors were constructed by the [[Kansas Cosmosphere and Space Center]]'s Space Works, which also restored the Apollo 13 Command Module. Two individual Lunar Modules and two Command Modules were constructed for filming. While each was a replica, composed of some of the original Apollo materials, they were built so that different sections were removable, which enabled filming to take place inside the capsules. Space Works also built modified Command and Lunar Modules for filming inside a [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker|Boeing KC-135]] [[reduced gravity aircraft|reduced-gravity aircraft]], and the pressure suits worn by the actors, which are exact reproductions of those worn by the Apollo astronauts, right down to the detail of being airtight. When the actors put the suits on with their helmets locked in place, air was pumped into the suits to cool them down and allow them to breathe, exactly as in launch preparations for the real Apollo missions.&lt;ref name="ProductionNotes2" /&gt;

The real [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|Mission Control Center]] consisted of two control rooms located on the second and third floors of Building 30 at the [[Johnson Space Center]] in [[Houston, Texas]]. [[NASA]] offered the use of the control room for filming, but Howard declined, opting instead to make his own replica from scratch.&lt;ref name="DVDLovellCommentary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DVDProductionNotes" /&gt; Production designer Michael Corenblith and set decorator Merideth Boswell were in charge of the construction of the Mission Control set at Universal Studios. The set was equipped with giant rear-screen projection capabilities and a complex set of computers with individual video feeds to all the flight controller stations. The actors playing the flight controllers were able to communicate with each other on a private audio loop.&lt;ref name="ProductionNotes2" /&gt; The Mission Control room built for the film was on the ground floor.&lt;ref name="DVDProductionNotes" /&gt; One NASA employee, who was a consultant for the film, said that the set was so realistic that he would leave at the end of the day and look for the elevator before remembering he was not in Mission Control.&lt;ref name="DVDLovellCommentary" /&gt; By the time the film was made, the USS ''Iwo Jima'' had been scrapped, so her sister ship, the [[USS New Orleans (LPH-11)|USS ''New Orleans'']], was used as the recovery ship instead.&lt;ref name="DVDProductionNotes" /&gt;

{{Quote box|quote = For actors, being able to actually shoot in zero gravity as opposed to being in incredibly painful and uncomfortable harnesses for special effects shots was all the difference between what would have been a horrible moviemaking experience as opposed to the completely glorious one that it actually was.|source = —Tom Hanks&lt;ref name="ProductionNotes2" /&gt;|width = 35%|align = right|salign = right}}
Howard anticipated difficulty in portraying [[weightlessness]] in a realistic manner. He discussed this with [[Steven Spielberg]], who suggested using a KC-135 airplane, which can be flown in such a way as to create about 23 seconds of weightlessness, a method NASA has always used to train its astronauts for space flight. Howard obtained NASA's permission and assistance in filming in the realistic conditions aboard multiple KC-135 flights.&lt;ref name="http://industrycentral.net/director_interviews/RH01.HTM"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://industrycentral.net/director_interviews/RH01.HTM | title=Ron Howard Weightless Again Over Apollo 13's DGA Win | accessdate=16 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cast training and filming ===

In Los Angeles, Ed Harris and all the actors portraying [[flight controller]]s enrolled in a Flight Controller School led by [[Gerry Griffin]], an Apollo 13 flight director, and flight controller Jerry Bostick. The actors studied audiotapes from the mission, reviewed hundreds of pages of NASA transcripts, and attended a crash course in [[physics]].&lt;ref name="DVDProductionNotes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ProductionNotes2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.imax.com/apollo13/pressmaterials/ProductionNotes.pdf | title=Production Notes (Press Release) | publisher=[[IMAX]] | accessdate=9 April 2009 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604135005/http://www.imax.com/apollo13/pressmaterials/ProductionNotes.pdf | archivedate=June 4, 2011 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Astronaut Dave Scott was impressed with their efforts, stating that each actor was determined to make every scene technically correct, word for word.&lt;ref name="lost moon" /&gt;

The score to ''Apollo 13'' was composed and conducted by [[James Horner]]. The [[soundtrack]] was released in 1995 by [[MCA Records]] and has seven tracks of score, eight period songs used in the film, and seven tracks of dialogue by the actors at a running time of nearly seventy-eight minutes. The music also features solos by vocalist [[Annie Lennox]] and Tim Morrison on the trumpet. The score was a critical success and garnered Horner an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/apollo13.html ''Apollo 13''] soundtrack review at [[Filmtracks.com|''Filmtracks'']].

[[Janet Maslin]] made the film an ''[[The New York Times|NYT]]'' Critics' Pick, calling it an "absolutely thrilling" film that "unfolds with perfect immediacy, drawing viewers into the nail-biting suspense of a spellbinding true story." According to Maslin, "like ''[[Quiz Show (film)|Quiz Show]]'', ''Apollo 13'' beautifully evokes recent history in ways that resonate strongly today. Cleverly nostalgic in its visual style ([[Rita Ryack]]'s costumes are especially right), it harks back to movie making without phony heroics and to the strong spirit of community that enveloped the astronauts and their families. Amazingly, this film manages to seem refreshingly honest while still conforming to the three-act dramatic format of a standard Hollywood hit. It is far and away the best thing Mr. Howard has done (and ''[[Far and Away]]'' was one of the other kind)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=990CE0D7123FF933A05755C0A963958260 |date=June 30, 1995 |first=Janet|last=Maslin|authorlink=Janet Maslin|title=''Apollo 13'', a Movie for the Fourth of July |work=The New York Times |accessdate=September 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The academic critic Raymond Malewitz focuses on the DIY aspects of the "mailbox" filtration system to illustrate the emergence of an unlikely hero in late 20th-century American culture—"the creative, improvisational, but restrained thinker—who replaces the older prodigal cowboy heroes of American mythology and provides the country a better, more frugal example of an appropriate 'husband'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://stanfordpress.typepad.com/blog/2014/09/getting-rugged-with-thing-theory.html |date=September 5, 2014 |first=Raymond|last=Malewitz|title=getting Rugged With Thing Theory |publisher=Stanford UP |accessdate=September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technical and historical accuracy ==
[[File:Universal Studios Hollywood 2012 58.jpg|thumb|Apollo 13 space capsule prop from the film]]
The film depicts the crew hearing a bang quickly after Swigert followed directions from mission control to stir the oxygen and hydrogen tanks. In reality, the crew heard the bang 93 seconds later.&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;[https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/Apollo_13h_Timeline.htm Apollo 13 Timeline], ''Apollo by the Numbers: A Statistical Reference'', NASA History Series, Office of Policy and Plans, Richard W. Orloff, Sept. 2004. See "Oxygen tank #2 fans on. Stabilization control system electrical disturbance indicated a power transient. 055:53:20."&lt;/ref&gt;

The film portrays the [[Saturn V]] launch vehicle being rolled out to the launch pad two days before launch. In reality, the launch vehicle was rolled out on the [[mobile launch platform]] using the [[crawler-transporter]] weeks before the launch date.

The movie depicts Swigert and Haise arguing about who was at fault.  The show ''The Real Story: Apollo 13'' broadcast on the Smithsonian Channel includes Haise stating that no such argument took place and that there was no way anyone could have foreseen that stirring the tank would cause problems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smithsonianchannel.com/shows/the-real-story/apollo-13/679/141246 ''The Real Story: Apollo 13''], Season 4, Episode 3, 2012.  See this section beginning at 15:18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dialogue between ground control and the astronauts was taken nearly verbatim from transcripts and recordings, with the exception of one of the taglines of the film, "[[Houston, we have a problem]]." (This quote was voted #50 on the list "[[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes]]".) According to the mission transcript, the actual words uttered by Jack Swigert were "Hey, we've got a problem here" (talking over Haise, who had started "Okay, Houston"). Ground control responded by saying "This is Houston, say again please." Jim Lovell then repeated, "Houston, we've had a problem."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/mission_trans/AS13_PAO.PDF|title=Page 231 of Apollo 13's transcript at NASA Johnson Space Center|accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One other incorrect dialogue is after the re-entry blackout. In the movie, Tom Hanks (as Lovell) says "Hello Houston... this is ''Odyssey''... it's good to see you again." In the actual re-entry, the Command Module's transmission was finally acquired by a [[Sikorsky SH-3D Sea King]] recovery aircraft which then relayed communications to Mission Control. CAPCOM and fellow astronaut Joe Kerwin (not Mattingly, who serves as CAPCOM in this scene in the movie) then made a call to the spacecraft "Odyssey, Houston standing by. Over." Jack Swigert, not Lovell, replied "Okay, Joe," and unlike in the movie, this was well before the parachutes deployed; the celebrations depicted at Mission Control were triggered by visual confirmation of their deployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://apollo13.spacelog.org/05:22:46:03/#log-line-513963|title=Apollo 13's re-entry transcript on Spacelog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tagline "Failure is not an option", stated in the film by Gene Kranz, also became very popular, but was not taken from the historical transcripts. The following story relates the origin of the phrase, from an e-mail by Apollo 13 [[Flight Dynamics Officer]] Jerry Bostick:
&lt;blockquote&gt;As far as the expression "Failure is not an option," you are correct that Kranz never used that term. In preparation for the movie, the script writers, Al Reinart and Bill Broyles, came down to Clear Lake to interview me on "What are the people in Mission Control really like?" One of their questions was "Weren't there times when everybody, or at least a few people, just panicked?" My answer was "No, when bad things happened, we just calmly laid out all the options, and failure was not one of them. We never panicked, and we never gave up on finding a solution." I immediately sensed that Bill Broyles wanted to leave and assumed that he was bored with the interview. Only months later did I learn that when they got in their car to leave, he started screaming, "That's it! That's the tag line for the whole movie, Failure is not an option. Now we just have to figure out who to have say it." Of course, they gave it to the Kranz character, and the rest is history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceacts.com/notanoption.htm|title=Origin of Apollo 13 Quote: "Failure Is Not an Option."|publisher=''SPACEACTS.COM''|accessdate=4 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the film, Flight Director Gene Kranz and his White Team are portrayed as managing all of the essential parts of the flight, from liftoff to landing.  Consequently, the actual role of the other flight directors and teams, especially Glynn Lunney and his Black Team, were neglected.  In fact, it was Flight Director Lunney and his Black Team who got Apollo 13 through its most critical period in the hours immediately after the explosion, including the mid-course correction that sent Apollo 13 on a "free return" trajectory around the Moon and back to the Earth.  Astronaut Ken Mattingly, who was replaced as Apollo 13 Command Module Pilot at the last minute by Jack Swigert, later said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;If there was a hero, Glynn Lunney was, by himself, a hero, because when he walked in the room, I guarantee you, nobody knew what the hell was going on.  Glynn walked in, took over this mess, and he just brought calm to the situation.  I've never seen such an extraordinary example of leadership in my entire career.  Absolutely magnificent.  No general or admiral in wartime could ever be more magnificent than Glynn was that night.  He and he alone brought all of the scared people together.  And you've got to remember that the flight controllers in those days were—they were kids in their thirties.  They were good, but very few of them had ever run into these kinds of choices in life, and they weren't used to that.  All of a sudden, their confidence had been shaken.  They were faced with things that they didn't understand, and Glynn walked in there, and he just kind of took charge.&lt;ref&gt;Ken Mattingly, quoted in Go, Flight! The Unsung Heroes of Mission Control, 1965-1992, Rick Houston and Milt Heflin, 2015, University of Nebraska Press, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A [[Audio commentary (DVD)|DVD commentary track]], recorded by Jim and Marilyn Lovell and included with both DVD versions,&lt;ref name="DVDInfo" /&gt; mentions several inaccuracies included in the film, all done for reasons of [[artistic license]]:
{{Quote box|quote=We were working and watching the controls during that time. Because we came in shallow, it took us longer coming through the atmosphere where we had ionization. And the other thing was that we were just slow in answering.|source=—Jim Lovell, on the real reason for the delay in replying after Apollo 13's four-minute re-entry into Earth's atmosphere&lt;ref name="nytlovell"/&gt;|width=45%|align=right|salign=right}}
* In the film, Mattingly plays a key role in solving a power consumption problem that Apollo 13 was faced with as it approached re-entry. Lovell points out in his commentary that Mattingly was a composite of several astronauts and engineers—including [[Charles Duke]] (whose rubella led to Mattingly's grounding)—all of whom played a role in solving that problem.&lt;ref name="DVDLovellCommentary" /&gt;
* When Jack Swigert is getting ready to dock with the LM, a concerned NASA technician says: "If Swigert can't dock this thing, we don't have a mission." Lovell and Haise also seem worried. In his DVD commentary, the real Jim Lovell says that if Swigert had been unable to dock with the LM, he or Haise could have done it. He also says that Swigert was a well-trained Command Module Pilot and that no one was really worried about whether he was up to the job,&lt;ref name="nytlovell" /&gt; but he admitted that it made a nice subplot for the film. What the astronauts were really worried about, Lovell says, was the expected rendezvous between the Lunar Module and the Command Module after Lovell and Haise left the surface of the Moon.&lt;ref name="DVDLovellCommentary" /&gt;
* A scene set the night before the launch, showing the astronauts' family members saying their goodbyes while separated by a road, to reduce the possibility of any last-minute [[transmission (medicine)|transmission]] of disease, depicted a tradition not begun until the [[Space Shuttle program]].&lt;ref name="DVDLovellCommentary" /&gt;
* The film depicts Marilyn Lovell dropping her wedding ring down a shower drain. According to Jim Lovell, this did occur,&lt;ref name="nytlovell" /&gt; but the drain trap caught the ring and his wife was able to retrieve it.&lt;ref name="DVDLovellCommentary" /&gt;  Lovell has also confirmed that the scene in which his wife had a nightmare about him being "sucked through an open door of a spacecraft into outer space" also occurred, though he believes the nightmare was prompted by her seeing a scene in ''[[Marooned (1969 film)|Marooned]]'', a 1969 film they saw three months before Apollo 13 launched.&lt;ref name="nytlovell"&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/19/garden/at-the-movies-with-jim-lovell-in-space-no-room-for-fear.html | first=Lena | last= William | date= 19 July 1995 | title= In Space, No Room For Fear | publisher= The New York Times |accessdate= 30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[fluid dynamics]], the '''Chézy formula''' describes the mean [[flow velocity]] of [[Steady flow|steady]], [[Turbulence|turbulent]] [[open channel flow]]:

: &lt;math&gt;v=C\sqrt{R\,i},\,&lt;/math&gt;

where
*&lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is average velocity [m/s],  
*&lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is Chezy's coefficient [m&lt;sup&gt;½&lt;/sup&gt;/s],
*&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the hydraulic radius (~ water depth) [m], and
*&lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is the bottom slope [m/m].

The formula is named after [[Antoine de Chézy]], the French hydraulics engineer who devised it in 1775.

==Usage with Manning coefficient==
This formula can also be used with Manning's Roughness Coefficient, instead of Chézy's coefficient. [[Robert Manning (engineer)|Manning]] derived&lt;ref&gt;Manning, R., "On the flow of Water in Open Channels and Pipes." ''Transactions Institute of Civil Engineers of Ireland, vol. 20, pp 161-209, Dublin, 1891, Supplement, vol 24, pp. 179-207, 1895&lt;/ref&gt; the following relation to C based upon experiments:
: &lt;math&gt;C=\frac{1}{n}R^{1/6}&lt;/math&gt;

where
*&lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is the Chézy coefficient [m&lt;sup&gt;½&lt;/sup&gt;/s],
*&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the hydraulic radius (~ water depth) [m], and
*&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is Manning's roughness coefficient.

Unlike the Manning equation, which is empirical, the Chézy equation is derived from hydrodynamics theory.&lt;ref&gt;Martin &amp; McCutcheon, 1999, Hydrodynamics and Transport, Lewis&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4681">In [[information science]] and [[bibliometrics]], a '''citation graph''' (or [[citation network]]) is a [[directed graph]] in which each [[vertex (graph theory)|vertex]] represents a document and in which each edge represents a [[citation]] from the current publication to another.

The best known example is probably the citation graph where academic papers are the vertices, as described in the classic 1965 article "Networks of Scientific Papers"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Derek J. de Solla Price | title=Networks of Scientific Papers | journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] | date=July 30, 1965 | volume=149 | issue=3683| pages=510&amp;ndash;515 | url=http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/papers/pricenetworks1965.pdf | pmid=14325149 | doi=10.1126/science.149.3683.510|format=PDF| bibcode=1965Sci...149..510D}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Derek J. de Solla Price]].  Another example is formed by  [[Judgment (law)|court judgements]] in which judges refer to earlier judgements to support their decisions.  [[Legal citation#Legal citation analysis|Citation analysis in a legal context]] is therefore an important commercial field. Patents are another well known example since they must refer to earlier patents which are known as [[prior art]].

A typical application for a citation graph is to try to measure the impact may be used in [[citation analysis]] as the basis for calculating measures of scientific impact such as the [[h-index]], and for studying the structure and development of different fields of academic inquiry.

The actual construction of citation graphs can be complicated in practice as there is often no standard format for the citations in a bibliography. This makes the [[record linkage]] of the citations in a document to their cited document time consuming.  Worse there are often errors in the citations introduced at any one of many stages of the process of publishing a document.  However there is a long history of creating a database of citations, also known as a [[citation index]], and so there is lot of information about such problems.

In principle each document will have a unique publication date and can only refer to earlier documents.  This means that the edges of the graph are not only [[directed graph|directed]] but they are also acyclic, that is there are no loops in the graph.  So a perfect citation graph is an example of a [[directed acyclic graph]]. In practice this is not always true, for instance an academic paper goes through several versions in the publishing process and it may be possible to update bibliographies at different times in such a way to lead to edges that apparently point forward in time.  However in practice it appears such citations are often less than 1% of the total number of links.&lt;ref name="clough2015" &gt;{{cite journal |author1=James R Clough |author2=Jamie Gollings |author3=Tamar V Loach |author4=Tim S Evans | title=Transitive reduction of citation networks | journal=Journal of Complex Networks |  year=2015 | volume= 3 | issue=2 | pages = 189&amp;ndash;203 | url=http://comnet.oxfordjournals.org/content/3/2/189.full.pdf |  doi=10.1093/comnet/cnu039|format=PDF |arxiv=1310.8224 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Compiler Description Language''', or '''CDL''', is a [[programming language]] based on [[affix grammar]]s. It is very similar to [[Backus–Naur form]] (BNF) notation. It was designed for the development of [[compiler]]s. It is very limited in its capabilities and control flow; and intentionally so. The benefits of these limitations are twofold. On the one hand they  make possible the sophisticated data and control flow analysis used by the CDL2 optimizers resulting in extremely efficient code. The other benefit is that they foster a highly verbose naming convention. This in turn leads to programs that are to a great extent [[self-documenting]].

The language looks a bit like [[Prolog]] (this is not surprising since both languages arose at about the same time out of work on [[affix grammar]]s). As opposed to Prolog however, control flow in CDL is deterministically based on success/failure i.e., no other alternatives are tried when the current one succeeds.  This idea is also used in [[parsing expression grammar]]s.

CDL3 is the third version of the CDL language, significantly different from the previous two versions.

== Design ==

The original version, designed by [[Cornelis H. A. Koster]] at the [[University of Nijmegen]] emerged in 1971 had a rather unusual concept: it had no core. A typical programming language source is translated to machine instructions or canned sequences of those instructions. Those represent the core, the most basic [[abstraction]]s that the given language supports. Such primitives can be the additions of numbers, copying variables to each other and so on. CDL1 lacks such a core, it is the responsibility of the programmer to provide the primitive operations in a form that can then be turned into machine instructions by means of an assembler or a compiler for a traditional language. The CDL1 language itself has no concept of primitives, no concept of data types apart from the machine word (an abstract unit of storage - not necessarily a real machine word as such). The evaluation rules are rather similar to the [[Backus–Naur form]] syntax descriptions; in fact, writing a parser for a language described in BNF is rather simple in CDL1.

Basically, the language consists of rules. A rule can either succeed or fail. A rule consists of alternatives that are sequences of other rule invocations. A rule succeeds if any of its alternatives succeeds; these are tried in sequence. An alternative succeeds if all of its rule invocations succeed. The language provides operators to create evaluation loops without recursion (although this is not strictly necessary in CDL2 as the optimizer achieves the same effect) and some shortcuts to increase the efficiency of the otherwise recursive evaluation but the basic concept is as above. Apart from the obvious application in context-free grammar parsing, CDL is also well suited to control applications, since a lot of control applications are essentially deeply nested if-then rules.

Each CDL1 rule, while being evaluated, can act on data, which is of unspecified type. Ideally the data should not be changed unless the rule is successful (no side effects on failure). This causes problems as although this rule may succeed, the rule invoking it might still fail, in which case the data change should not take effect. It is fairly easy (albeit memory intensive) to assure the above behavior if all the data is dynamically allocated on a stack but it is rather hard when there's static data, which is often the case. The CDL2 compiler is able to flag the possible violations thanks to the requirement that the direction of parameters (input,output,input-output) and the type of rules (can fail: '''test''', '''predicate'''; cannot fail: '''function''', '''action'''; can have side effect: '''predicate''', '''action'''; cannot have side effect: '''test''', '''function''') must be specified by the programmer.

As the rule evaluation is based on calling simpler and simpler rules, at the bottom there should be some primitive rules that do the actual work. That is where CDL1 is very surprising: it does not have those primitives. You have to provide those rules yourself. If you need addition in your program, you have to create a rule that has two input parameters and one output parameter and the output is set to be the sum of the two inputs by your code. The CDL compiler uses your code as strings (there are conventions how to refer to the input and output variables) and simply emits it as needed. If you describe your adding rule using assembly, then you will need an assembler to translate the CDL compiler's output to machine code. If you describe all the primitive rules (macros in CDL terminology) in Pascal or C, then you need a Pascal or C compiler to run after the CDL compiler. This lack of core primitives can be very painful when you have to write a snippet of code even for the simplest machine instruction operation but on the other hand it gives you great flexibility in implementing esoteric abstract primitives acting on exotic [[abstract object]]s (the 'machine word' in CDL is more like 'unit of data storage', with no reference to the kind of data stored there). Additionally large projects made use of carefully crafted libraries of primitives. These were then replicated for each target architecture and OS allowing the production of highly efficient code for all.

To get a feel for the language, here is a small code fragment adapted from the CDL2 manual:

&lt;source lang="text"&gt;
ACTION quicksort + &gt;from + &gt;to -p -q:
  less+from+to, split+from+to+p+q,
    quicksort+from+q, quicksort+p+to;
  +.

ACTION split + &gt;i + &gt;j + p&gt; + q&gt; -m:
  make+p+i, make+q+j, add+i+j+m, halve+m,
    (again: move up+j+p+m, move down+i+q+m,
       (less+p+q, swap item+p+q, incr+p, decr+q, *again;
        less+p+m, swap item+p+m, incr+p;
        less+m+q, swap item+q+m, decr+q;
        +)).

FUNCTION move up + &gt;j + &gt;p&gt; + &gt;m:
  less+j+p;
  smaller item+m+p;
  incr+p, *.

FUNCTION move down + &gt;i + &gt;q&gt; + &gt;m:
  less+q+j;
  smaller item+q+m;
  decr+q, *.

TEST less+&gt;a+&gt;b:=a"&lt;"b.
FUNCTION make+a&gt;+&gt;b:=a"="b.
FUNCTION add+&gt;a+&gt;b+sum&gt;:=sum"="a"+"b.
FUNCTION halve+&gt;a&gt;:=a"/=2".
FUNCTION incr+&gt;a&gt;:=a"++".
FUNCTION decr+&gt;a&gt;:=a"--".

TEST smaller item+&gt;i+&gt;j:="items["i"]&lt;items["j"]".
ACTION swap items+&gt;i+&gt;j-t:=t"=items["i"];items["i"]=items["j"];items["j"]="t.
&lt;/source&gt;
The primitive operations are here defined in terms of Java (or C). This is not a complete program; we must define the Java array ''items'' elsewhere.

CDL2, which appeared in 1976, kept the principles of CDL1 but made the language suitable for large projects. It introduced modules, enforced data-change-only-on-success and extended the capabilities of the language somewhat. The optimizers in the CDL2 compiler and especially in the CDL2 Laboratory (an IDE for CDL2) were world class and not just for their time. One feature of the CDL2 Laboratory optimizer is almost unique: it can perform optimizations across compilation units, i.e., treating the entire program as a single compilation.

CDL3 is a more recent language. It gave up the open-ended feature of the previous CDL versions and it provides primitives to basic arithmetic and storage access. The extremely puritan syntax of the earlier CDL versions (the number of keywords and symbols both run in single digits) have also been relaxed and some basic concepts are now expressed in syntax rather than explicit semantics. In addition, data types have been introduced to the language.

== Use ==

The commercial mbp Cobol (a Cobol compiler for the PC) as well as the MProlog system (an industrial strength Prolog implementation that ran on numerous architectures (IBM mainframe, VAX, PDP-11, Intel 8086, etc.) and OS-s (DOS/OS/CMS/BS2000, VMS/Unix, DOS/Windows/OS2)). The latter in particular is testimony to CDL2's portability.

While most programs written with CDL have been compilers, there is at least one commercial GUI application that was developed and maintained in CDL. This application was a dental image acquisition application now owned by DEXIS. A dental office management system was also once developed in CDL.

The software for the [[Mephisto (chess computer)|Mephisto III chess computer]] was written with CDL2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nitsche|first1=Thomas|title=Das Mephisto 3-Projekt|journal=Schach-Echo|date=1984|issue=7/1984|url=http://www.schach-computer.info/wiki/index.php/Das_Mephisto_3-Projekt|accessdate=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It involves the use of either solid filiform needles or hollow-core hypodermic needles for therapy of muscle pain, including pain related to [[myofascial pain syndrome]]. Dry needling is sometimes also known as intramuscular stimulation (IMS).&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt;

While many studies have been performed to test the [[efficacy]] of dry needling as a treatment for muscle pain, there remains no scientific consensus as to whether  or not it is effective.&lt;ref name="ebsco01"/&gt; Some results suggest that it is an effective treatment for certain kinds of muscle pain, while other studies have shown no benefit compared to a [[placebo]]. There are not enough high-quality studies of the technique to draw clear conclusions about its efficacy.

== Origin ==
The origin of the term "dry needling" is attributed to [[Janet G. Travell]]. In her book, ''Myofascial Pain and Dysfunction: Trigger Point Manual'', Travell uses the term "dry needling" to differentiate between two hypodermic needle techniques when performing [[Myofascial trigger point|trigger point]] therapy. However, Travell did not elaborate on the details on the techniques of dry needling; the current techniques of dry needling were based on the traditional and western medical acupuncture. The two techniques Travell described are the injection of a local anesthetic and the mechanical use of a hypodermic needle without injecting a solution (Travell, Simons, &amp; Simons, 1999, pp.&amp;nbsp;154–155). Travell preferred a 22-gauge, 1.5-in hypodermic needle for [[Myofascial trigger point|trigger point]] therapy and used this needle for both injection therapy and dry needling. Travell never used an acupuncture needle. Travell had access to acupuncture needles but reasoned that they were far too thin for [[Myofascial trigger point|trigger point]] therapy. She preferred hypodermic needles because of their strength and tactile feedback: "A 22-gauge, 3.8-cm (1.5-in) needle is usually suitable for most superficial muscles. In hyperalgesic patients, a 25-gauge, 3.8-cm (1.5-in) needle may cause less discomfort, but will not provide the clear "feel" of the structures being penetrated by the needle and is more likely to be deflected by the dense contraction knots that are the target... A 27-gauge needle, 3.8-cm (1.5-in) needle is even more flexible; the tip is more likely to be deflected by the contraction knots and it provides less tactile feedback for precision injection" (Travell, Simons, &amp; Simons, 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;156).

The use of a hypodermic needle for dry needling was described by Chang-Zern Hong in his research paper on "Lidocaine Injection Versus Dry Needling to Myofascial Trigger Point". In his research, he describes the procedure for [[Myofascial trigger point|trigger point]] or MTrP injection and dry needling by using a 27-gauge hypodermic needle {{frac|1|1|4}}-in long (Hong, 1994). Both Travell and Hong used hypodermic needles for dry needling. Hong, like Travell, did not use an acupuncture needle for dry needling.

Although dry needling originally utilized only hypodermic needles due to the concern that solid needles had neither the strength or tactile feedback that hypodermic needles provided and that the needle could be deflected by "dense contraction knots", those concerns have proven unfounded and many healthcare practitioners who perform dry needling have found that the acupuncture needles not only provides better tactile feedback but also penetrate the "dense muscle knots" better and are easier to manage and caused less discomfort to patients. For that reason, both the use of hypodermic needles and the use of acupuncture needles are now accepted in dry needling practice.  Ofttimes practitioners who use hypodermic needles also provide [[Myofascial trigger point|trigger point]] injection treatment to patients and therefore find the use of hypodermic needles a better choice. As their use became more common, some dry needling practitioners without acupuncture in their scope of practice, started to refer to these needles by their technical design term as "solid filiform needles" as opposed to the FDA designation "acupuncture needle".

The "solid filiform needle" used in dry needling is regulated by the FDA as a Class II medical device described in the code titled "Sec. 880.5580 Acupuncture needle" as "a device intended to pierce the skin in the practice of acupuncture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=[Code of Federal Regulations]|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfCFR/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=880.5580|publisher=FDA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Per the Food and Drug Act of 1906 and the subsequent Amendments to said act, the FDA definition applies to how the needles can be marketed and does not mean that acupuncture is the only medical procedure where these needles can be used.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2010-title21/pdf/USCODE-2010-title21-chap9-subchapV-partA-sec360j.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2010-title21/pdf/USCODE-2010-title21-chap9-subchapV-partA-sec360c.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2010-title21/pdf/USCODE-2010-title21-chap9-subchapV-partA-sec353.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2010-title21/pdf/USCODE-2010-title21-chap9-subchapV-partE-sec360bbb.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2010-title21/pdf/USCODE-2010-title21-chap9-subchapV-partE-sec360bbb-2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Dry needling using such a needle contrasts with the use of a hollow [[hypodermic needle]] to inject substances such as [[saline solution]], botox or corticosteroids to the same point. In a small number of studies, the use of a solid needle has been found to be as effective as injection of substances in such cases as relief of pain in muscles and [[fascia|connective tissue]].

The Founder of Integrative Systemic Dry Needling (ISDN), Yun-Tao Ma, has been spearheading the "dry needling" movement in the United States. Ma states, "Although ISDN originated in traditional Chinese methods, it has developed from the ancient empirical approach to become modern medical art rooted in evidence-based thinking and practice."&lt;ref&gt;Ma, Yun-Tao. "Integrative Systemic Dry Needling/ A New Modality for Athletes." Biomedical Acupuncture for Sports and Trauma Rehabilitation: Dry Needling Techniques. St. Louis: Churchill Livingstone Elsevier, 2011. 4. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Ma then contradicts himself stating, "Dry needling technique is a modern Western medical modality that is not related to traditional Chinese acupuncture in any way. Dry needling has its own theoretical concepts, terminology, needling technique and clinical application."&lt;ref&gt;Ma, Yun-Tao. "What Is Dry Needling?" (n.d.): 1. Web. 02 Aug. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  
Ma realizing both the self-contradictions and the legal ramifications of dry needling being rooted in acupuncture and Chinese medicine has since taken down all information in his bios regarding his education in Chinese Medicine and being a Licensed Acupuncturist in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Ma, Yun-Tao. "Meet Your Teacher." Dry Needling Course RSS. Dr. Yun-Tao Ma, Ph.D., LAc, n.d. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Academy of Orthopedic Manual Physical Therapists (AAOMPT) states:

{{Quote|Dry needling is a neurophysiological evidence-based treatment technique that requires effective manual assessment of the neuromuscular system. Physical therapists are well trained to utilize dry needling in conjunction with manual physical therapy interventions. Research supports that dry needling improves pain control, reduces muscle tension, normalizes biochemical and electrical dysfunction of motor end plates, and facilitates an accelerated return to active rehabilitation.}}

The statement above is self-explanatory on the functional, physiological and medical aspect of treatment. His book Manual of Dry Needling Techniques Color Edition (2) (Volume 1) is a basic reference text for the therapists who are trained in the method of dry needling procedures in accordance with the norm of the practice of their respective countries. The basic steps given in the book can make a practicing therapist use dry needling technique for the subjects in different clinical conditions. The text focus not only on the steps needed to be performed but also focus on what should not be done by a therapist while performing the procedure. At work, we have taken all the guidelines given by OSHA for blood borne diseases as well as WHO guideline on workplace and hand hygiene.

Dry needling for the treatment of myofascial (muscular) [[Myofascial trigger point|trigger points]] is based on theories similar, but not exclusive, to traditional acupuncture; both acupuncture and dry needling target the [[Myofascial trigger point|trigger points]], which is a direct and palpable source of patient pain.  However, dry needling theory is only beginning to describe the complex sensation referral patterns that have been documented as "channels" or "meridians" in Chinese Medicine. Dry needling, and its treatment techniques and desired effects, would be most directly comparable to the use of 'a-shi' points in acupuncture.&lt;ref name="books.google.ca"&gt;[[#Aung2007|Aung &amp; Chen]], 2007, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=I6NclaeDWjgC&amp;pg=PA101#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 101].&lt;/ref&gt; What further distinguishes dry needling from traditional acupuncture is that it does not use the full range of traditional theories of Chinese Medicine which is used to treat not only pain but other non-musculoskeletal issues which often are the cause of pain. The distinction between trigger points and acupuncture points for the relief of pain is blurred. As reported by Melzack, et al., there is a high degree of correspondence (71% based on their analysis) between published locations of trigger points and classical acupuncture points for the relief of pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Travell|last2=Simons|title=Myofascial Pain and Dysfunction, The Trigger Point Manual, Volume 1. Upper Half of Body, Second Edition|publisher=North Atlantic Books|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debated distinction between dry needling and acupuncture has become a [[dry needling#Controversy|controversy]] because it relates to an issue of [[scope of practice]] of various professions.

== Technique ==

In the treatment of [[trigger point]]s for persons with [[myofascial pain syndrome]], dry needling is an invasive procedure in which a filiform needle is inserted into the skin and muscle directly at a myofascial trigger point. A myofascial trigger point consists of multiple contraction knots, which are related to the production and maintenance of the pain cycle. Deep dry needling for treating trigger points was first introduced by Czech physician [[Karel Lewit]] in 1979.&lt;ref name=baldry&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baldry|first1=Peter|last2=Yunus|first2=Muhammad B.|last3=Inanici|first3=Fatma|title=Myofascial pain and fibromyalgia syndromes: a clinical guide to diagnosis and management|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VpjTcoDLXPQC&amp;pg=PA36|year=2001|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=0-443-07003-2|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Lewit had noticed that the success of injections into trigger points in relieving pain was apparently unconnected to the analgesic used.&lt;ref name=lewit&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The needle effect in the relief of myofascial pain|author=K. Lewit|journal=Pain|date= February 1979|volume=6|pmid=424236|issue=1|pages=83–90|doi=10.1016/0304-3959(79)90142-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proper dry needling of a myofascial trigger point will elicit a local twitch response (LTR), which is an involuntary spinal cord reflex in which the muscle fibers in the taut band of muscle contract. The LTR indicates the proper placement of the needle in a trigger point. Dry needling that elicits LTRs improves treatment outcomes,&lt;ref name=cochrane/&gt; and may work by activating [[endogenous opioids]].&lt;ref name=baldry/&gt;  The activation of the endogenous opioids is for an analgesic effect using the Gate Control Theory of Pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Myofascial Pain and Dysfunction|last = Travell|first = JG|date = 1999|journal = Trigger Point Manual|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inserting the needle can itself cause considerable pain,&lt;ref name=baldry/&gt; although when done by well-trained practitioners that is not a common occurrence.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} No study to date has reported the reliability of trigger point diagnosis and physical diagnosis cannot be recommended as a reliable test for the diagnosis of trigger points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lucas|first=N.|author2=Macaskill P. |author3=Irwig L. |author4=Moran R. |author5=Bogduk N. |year=2009|title=Reliability of physical examination for diagnosis of myofascial trigger points: a systematic review of the literature|journal=The Clinical Journal of Pain|publisher=Eastern Pain Association|volume=25|issue=1|pages=80–9|issn=0749-8047|doi=10.1097/AJP.0b013e31817e13b6|pmid=19158550|url=http://journals.lww.com/clinicalpain/Abstract/2009/01000/Reliability_of_Physical_Examination_for_Diagnosis.12.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tough|first=Elizabeth A.|author2=White, Adrian R. |author3=Richards, Suzanne |author4= Campbell, John |year=2007|title=Variability of Criteria Used to Diagnose Myofascial Trigger Point Pain Syndrome-Evidence From a Review of the Literature|journal=The Clinical Journal of Pain|publisher=Eastern Pain Association|volume=23|issue=3|pages=278–286|doi=10.1097/AJP.0b013e31802fda7c|pmid=17314589|url=http://journals.lww.com/clinicalpain/Abstract/2007/03000/Variability_of_Criteria_Used_to_Diagnose.13.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Efficacy ==
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2013}}

There is currently no standardized form of dry needling, no body of evidence that indicates its efficacy, and there is no medical action pathway that provides a theoretical basis for why dry needling should be efficacious. Many of the studies published about dry needling do not have strong evidence; either the studies were not randomized, contained small sample sizes, had high dropout rates, used active interventions in the control group, did not follow the minimally acceptable criteria to diagnose a myofascial trigger point, or did not clearly state that myofascial trigger points were the sole cause for the pain. For example, in a [[systematic review]] on needling therapies in the management of myofascial trigger points, only 8 of the 23 trials described the minimally acceptable criteria for diagnosing a trigger point. Locating the trigger point for dry needling is the basis for performing dry needling and should, therefore, be documented in each study performing this technique. In the same review, two studies tested the efficacy beyond placebo of dry needling in the treatment of myofascial trigger point pain, but, in one, the dropout rate was 48% and it was neither blinded nor randomized, and the other study used potentially active interventions in the control group. Another concluded that dry needling can reduce pain, thus improving mood, function, and disability. The study used the dry needling on trigger points to relieve pain in patients with chronic myofascial pain.&lt;ref name="ebsco01"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=5&amp;sid=433ddf1c-3e1d-4228-b7a2-65b00b10f9c1%2540sessionmgr115&amp;hid=124&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#AN=109604111&amp;db=rzh|title=|author=|date=|website= ebscohost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another [[systematic review]] concluded that dry needling for the treatment of myofascial pain syndrome in the lower back appeared to be a useful addition to standard therapies, but stated clear recommendations could not be made because the published studies are small and of low quality.&lt;ref name=cochrane&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Furlan AD, van Tulder MW, Cherkin DC, etal |title=Acupuncture and dry-needling for low back pain |journal=[[Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews]]|volume= |issue=1 |pages=CD001351 |year=2005 |pmid=15674876 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001351.pub2 |url=http://mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD001351/frame.html|editor1-last=Furlan|editor1-first=Andrea D}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 meta-analysis examining dry needling of myofascial trigger points concluded that the effect of needling was not significantly different to that of placebo controls, though the trend in the results could be compatible with a treatment effect. One study (Lorenzo et al. 2004) did show a short-term reduction in shoulder pain in stroke patients who received needling with standard rehabilitation compared to those who received standard care alone, but the study was open-label and measurement timings differed, limiting the use of the study. Again the small sample size and poor quality of studies was highlighted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.ejpain.2008.02.006 |last=Tough |first=Elizabeth A. |author2=Adrian R. White |author3=T.

A 2013 systematic review and meta-analysis released by [[Journal of Orthopaedic &amp; Sports Physical Therapy|JOSPT]] on "effectiveness of dry needling for upper-quarter myofascial pain" recommends the usage of dry needling, compared to sham or placebo, for decreasing pain immediately after treatment and at 4 weeks in patients with upper quarter myofascial pain syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Kietrys |first=David M. |last2=Palombaro |first2=Kerstin M. |last3=Azzaretto |first3=Erica |last4=Hubler |first4=Richard |last5=Schaller |first5=Bret |last6=Schlussel |first6=J.

A 2014 review of dry needling&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=4117383|year=2014|author1=Dunning|first1=J|title=Dry needling: A literature review with implications for clinical practice guidelines|journal=Physical Therapy Reviews|volume=19|issue=4|pages=252–265|last2=Butts|first2=R|last3=Mourad|first3=F|last4=Young|first4=I|last5=Flannagan|first5=S|last6=Perreault|first6=T|doi=10.1179/108331913X13844245102034|pmid=25143704}}&lt;/ref&gt; found insufficient high-quality evidence for the use of direct dry needling for short and long-term pain and disability reduction in patients with musculoskeletal pain syndromes.
The same review found that robust evidence validating the clinical diagnostic criteria for trigger point identification or diagnosis is lacking and that high-quality studies demonstrate that manual examination for the identification and localization of a trigger point is neither valid nor reliable between-examiners. A 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis found very little evidence supporting the use of trigger point dry needling to treat upper shoulder pain and dysfunction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hall |first=Michelle Louise |last2=Mackie |first2=Angela Claire |last3=Ribeiro |first3=Daniel Cury |date=2017-08-07 |title=Effects of dry needling trigger point therapy in the shoulder region on patients with upper extremity pain and dysfunction: a systematic review with meta-analysis  |journal=Physiotherapy |doi=10.1016/j.physio.2017.08.001 |issn=1873-1465 |pmid=29439829}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 literature review collated 16 eligible studies and found that although it appeared to be a superior technique to acupuncture for lower back pain current evidence is not robust enough to draw a clear conclusion about safety and efficacy.&lt;ref name="Hu Gao Ma Zhao 2018 p=e11225"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hu | first=Han-Tong | last2=Gao | first2=Hong | last3=Ma | first3=Rui-Jie | last4=Zhao | first4=Xiao-Feng | last5=Tian | first5=Hong-Fang | last6=Li | first6=Lu | title=Is dry needling effective for low back pain? | journal=Medicine | publisher=Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health) | volume=97 | issue=26 | year=2018 | issn=0025-7974 | doi=10.1097/md.0000000000011225 | page=e11225}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another found that although dry needling appears to reduce pain for patients in all 11 studies considered, it was not clear what, if any other than placebo, mechanism was acting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Adah |first1=Felix |last2=Haung |first2=Min |title=THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DRY NEEDLING ON THE REDUCTION OF PROXIMAL UPPER QUARANT PAIN USING COHEN’S d: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW |journal=Journal of the Mississippi Academy of Sciences |date=10 March 2018 |volume=63 |issue=2 |pages=194 - 201 |url=http://sbec18.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/MAS-Vol-63-no-2-supplemental.pdf#page=30 |accessdate=3 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==

Many physical therapists and chiropractors have asserted that they are not practicing acupuncture when dry needling.&lt;ref name=dommerholt&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aaaomonline.info/qiunity/08/07/3a.html |title=The "Dry Needling Issue" |last=Dommerholt |first=Jan |year=2008 |work=Qi-Unity Report |accessdate=16 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104134841/http://www.aaaomonline.info/qiunity/08/07/3a.html |archivedate=4 November 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They assert that much of the basic physiological and biomechanical knowledge that dry needling utilizes is taught as part of their core physical therapy and chiropractic education and that the specific dry needling skills are supplemental to that knowledge and not exclusive to acupuncture.  However, the originators and proponents of dry needling acknowledged that certain aspects of this techniques were inspired by acupuncture although they also acknowledge that the medical basis for it is purely Western Medicine in nature and therefore is not validly a subset of acupuncture and is a separate medical process. Many acupuncturists have argued that dry needling appears to be an acupuncture technique requiring minimal training that has been re-branded under a new name ("dry needling").  Whether dry needling is considered to be acupuncture depends on the definition of acupuncture, and it is argued that trigger points do not correspond to acupuncture points or meridians.&lt;ref name=headaches&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fernández De las Peñas|first1=César|last2=Arendt-Nielsen|first2=Lars|last3=Gerwin|first3=Robert D.|title=Tension-Type and Cervicogenic Headache: Pathophysiology, Diagnosis, and Management|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E77N-9iIaMAC&amp;pg=PA250|year=2009|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|isbn=0-7637-5283-5|page=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; They correspond by definition to the ad hoc category of 'a-shi' acupoints.&lt;ref name="books.google.ca"/&gt; It is important to note that this category of points is not necessarily distinct from other formal categories of acupoints. In 1983, Janet Travell et al. described trigger point locations as 92% in correspondence with known acupuncture points. In 2006, Peter T. Dorsher, acupuncturist at the Mayo Clinic, concludes that the two point systems are in over 90% agreement.&lt;ref name=Dorsher&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Trigger Points and Acupuncture Points: Anatomic and Clinical Correlations|author=Peter T. Dorsher|journal=Medical Acupuncture|date= May 2006|volume=17|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Dorsher and Fleckenstein conclude that the strong (up to 91%) consistency of the distributions of trigger point regions’ referred pain patterns to acupuncture meridians provides evidence that trigger points most likely represent the same physiological phenomenon as acupuncture points in the treatment of pain disorders.&lt;ref name="Dorsher and Fleckenstein.J"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Trigger Points and Acupuncture Points: Anatomic and Clinical Correlations|author1=Peter T.

In 2011, The Council of Colleges of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (CCAOM) published a [http://www.ccaom.org/downloads/CCAOM_Position_Paper__May_2011_Update.pdf position paper] describing dry needling as an acupuncture technique.
  
The North Carolina Acupuncture Licensing Board has published a position statement  asserting that dry needling is acupuncture and thus is covered by the North Carolina Acupuncture Licensing law, and is not within the present scope of practice of Physical Therapists, and Physical Therapists are not among the professions exempt from the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In May 2011 the Oregon Board of Chiropractic Examiners ruled to allow "dry needling" into the chiropractic scope of practice with 24 hours of training. In July 2011 the Court of Appeals of the State of Oregon issued an injunction, preventing chiropractors from practicing dry needling until the case is heard in court. The document issued by the court states that "dry needling" is "substantially the same" as acupuncture and that the "respondent has not explained how 24 hours of training, with no clinical component, provides sufficient training to chiropractors to adequately protect patients."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reddit.com/r/physicaltherapy/comments/7uzi4l/trigger_point_dry_needling/ Trigger points for dry needling technique] {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2011, the Oregon Board of Chiropractic Examiners And Oregon Attorney General appealed said order on the grounds that they feel the commissioner who issued the order was mistaken in his assertion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.oregon.gov/OBCE/pdfs/DN4A_OBCE_vs_OAAOM_BRIEF_requesting_Stay_be_overturned.pdf OBCE &amp; Oregon State Attorney General Motion Requesting Reconsideration of Administrative Stay, September 22, 2011] {{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 10, 2011, The Court of Appeals of the State of Oregon issued an Order Denying the Motion for Reconsideration.&lt;ref&gt;Order Denying Motion for Reconsideration, Court of Appeals, State of Oregon, No. A148924, November 10, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of said ruling is that the entire Appeals Court will now determine if the stay was appropriate. The stay is relevant ''only'' in the State of Oregon.

In January 2014, The Oregon Court of Appeals ruled that the Oregon Board of Chiropractic Examiners did not have the statutory authority to include dry needling in the scope of practice for chiropractors in that state. The ruling did not address whether chiropractors have the medical expertise to use dry needling or whether the training they were being given was adequate.&lt;ref name="publications.ojd.state.or.us"&gt;http://www.publications.ojd.state.or.us/docs/A148924.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Pending further discussion of training requirements the Oregon Physical Therapist Licensing Board has advised all Oregon physical therapists against practicing dry needling.  They have not changed their ruling that dry needling is within the scope of practice for Oregon Physical Therapists.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oregon.gov/PTBrd/docs/current.topics/board.statement.relevant.to.dry.needling.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Medical Association]] adopted a policy in 2016 that said physical therapists and other non-physicians practicing dry needling should – at a minimum – have standards that are similar to the ones for training, certification, and continuing education that exist for acupuncture. AMA board member Russell W. H. Kridel, M.D. stated "Lax regulation and nonexistent standards surround this invasive practice. For patients' safety, practitioners should meet standards required for licensed acupuncturists and physicians."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/news/news/2016/2016-06-15-new-policies-annual-meeting.page|title=AMA Adopts New Policies on Final Day of Annual Meeting - American Medical Association|author=|date=|website=www.ama-assn.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ex-Cubs Factor''' (or Ex-Cub Factor) is a seemingly [[spurious correlation]] that was seen as  essentially a corollary to the [[Curse of the Billy Goat]]. Widely published in the 1990s, the hypothesis asserted that since the appearance by the [[Chicago Cubs]] in the [[1945 World Series]], any [[baseball]] team headed into the World Series with three or more former Cubs on its roster has "a critical mass of Cubness" and a strong likelihood of failure.&lt;ref name=Berler-1981 /&gt;

==Ex-Cubs Factor hypothesis==

}}

The theory was developed in October 15, 1981 by Ron Berler, a freelance journalist and Cubs fan.  Berler posited in an article that "it is utterly impossible for a team with three or more ex-Cubs to win the series."&lt;ref name=Berler-1981&gt;{{cite news |last=Berler |first=Ron |title=The Ex-Cub Factor: Theory will Decide World Series winner |url=//www.all-baseball.com/ref/berler.html |accessdate= |newspaper=Boston Herald |date=15 October 1981 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405034627/http://www.all-baseball.com/ref/berler.html |archivedate=April 5, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Berler based this on a pattern that he observed in the post-1945 era; 1945 being the last time the Chicago Cubs made it to a World Series until 2016.

Berler cited many examples of teams with three or more ex-Cubs on their teams that reached the World Series and lost: including the [[1958 Milwaukee Braves season|1958 Milwaukee Braves]], the [[1966 Los Angeles Dodgers season|1966 Los Angeles Dodgers]], and the [[1978 Los Angeles Dodgers season|1978 Los Angeles Dodgers]].  The 1978 Dodgers, according to Berler, had lost the 1977 World Series with three ex-Cubs on their roster and seemed to be doing well the next season when they traded one of those ex-Cubs ([[Mike Garman]]) away and began playing excellently.  However, four weeks later, the Dodgers traded for ex-Cub [[Bill North]] and, in the words of Berler, the "team suffered an immediate tailspin and barely beat Cincinnati to the pennant."&lt;ref name=Berler-1981 /&gt;  The 1978 Dodgers lost the World Series to the Yankees leading to Berler's hypothesis of three ex-Cubs making it impossible to win a championship. In addition, the [[1980 Kansas City Royals season|1980 Kansas City Royals]] lost the World Series as well with 3 ex-Cubs.

In the original article, Berler predicted that based on this pattern the 1981 New York Yankees would not win the [[World Series]] because they had five ex-Cubs on their roster ([[Oscar Gamble]], [[Bobby Murcer]], [[Dave LaRoche]], [[Rick Reuschel]], and [[Barry Foote]]), this prediction went against the odds which heavily favored the Yankees at the time.&lt;ref name=Strachan&gt;{{cite news|last=Strachan|first=Al|title=Three Cubs and You're Out|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=October 21, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His prediction about the [[1981 World Series]] based on this hypothesis was proved correct with the Yankees losing to the Dodgers, four games to two.

===Explanation of the relationship===
Berler relates the relationship to the inherent "cubness" that ex-Cubs take to their future teams.  In the original article, he wrote that "the ballclub possesses eerie, bewitching powers over its players" and that "'Cubness'...is synonymous with the rankest sort of abject failure, and is a condition chronic among all Cubs, past and present."&lt;ref name=Berler-1981 /&gt;

[[Mike Royko]], who popularized the term in his columns in Chicago, wrote that cubness was a "virus" where "Three or more ex-Cubs could infect an entire team with the will to lose, no matter how skillful that team might appear."&lt;ref name=Royko /&gt;  Berler adopted a similar explanation in later articulations, writing that the virus "attacks all who've played for the Cubs, even if only for a single day. There is no inoculation, no cure. When traded to another team, ex-Cubs become carriers of this debilitating disease—the ticks of baseball. Any World Series team infested with three or more of them turns addled and confused, losing all ability to win."&lt;ref name=Berler-2008 /&gt;

===Modified Ex-Cub Factor===
{{Quote box
| width = 300px
| quote = '''A team with no ex-Cubs probably has the edge on a team that has even one in the World Series'''
| source = -Mike Royko's ''Modified ex-Cubs Factor'' hypothesis
}}
Mike Royko developed an additional hypothesis contending that "A team with no ex-Cubs probably has the edge on a team that has even one."  The key evidence provided for this was the [[1986 World Series]] which had the [[New York Mets]] (with no ex-Cubs) defeat the [[Boston Red Sox]] (with a dramatic error by ex-Cub [[Bill Buckner]]).&lt;ref name=Gatto&gt;{{cite book|last=Gatto|first=Steve|title=Da Curse Of The Billy Goat: The Chicago Cubs, Pennant Races, And Curses|year=2004|publisher=Protar|location=Lansing, Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This hypothesis was largely discredited in the [[2003 World Series]] with the [[Florida Marlins]] (who had ex-Cub [[Lenny Harris]]) defeating the New York Yankees (who had no ex-Cubs), though Harris did not play in the World Series.&lt;ref name=Berler-2008 /&gt;

Since 1945, of the 23 teams to reach the World Series with three or more Cubs players, only 3 have won the World Series (the 1960 Pirates, the 2001 Diamondbacks, and the 2008 Phillies).&lt;ref name=Reynolds /&gt; Since its articulation in 1981, the Ex-Cubs Factor has been used to predict and explain post-season and World Series defeats for many different baseball teams.

During the 1980s, the ex-Cubs factor was used to explain a number of losses by teams.  It was used, in a letter to the editor, as a reason for the loss by the San Diego Padres (who ironically beat the Cubs to get to the Series) in the [[1984 World Series]] (with three ex-Cubs) and by the collapse of the [[1985 Toronto Blue Jays season|1985 Toronto Blue Jays]] who had added ex-Cub [[Cliff Johnson (baseball)|Cliff Johnson]] on August 28 and then blew a 3-1 lead over the Royals in the [[1985 American League Championship Series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Curse Of the Cubs|accessdate=|newspaper=New York Times|date=October 13, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While not falling under the curse in the traditional sense, [[Bill Buckner]]'s infamous gaffe in Game 6 of the [[1986 World Series]] can be interpreted to fit the Ex-Cubs Factor. Buckner, a former Cub, booted a ground ball hit by [[New York Mets]] batter [[Mookie Wilson]], allowing [[Ray Knight]] to come around and score the winning run. The Mets would go on to win the series in seven games, and Buckner would never win the World Series in his career. Upon video analysis, Buckner was shown to be wearing a Cubs batting glove under his mitt when he made the error.

The theory became more prominent in 1990 when it was popularized by syndicated ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' columnist [[Mike Royko]] and continued predictions by Ron Berler.  On October 16, 1990, Berler again asserted the ex-Cubs factor as the reason that the favored [[Oakland Athletics]] (with ex-Cubs Scott Sanderson, Dennis Eckersley, and Ron Hassey) would lose in the [[1990 World Series]] (which they did by getting swept by the [[Cincinnati Reds]]).&lt;ref name=Berler-1990&gt;{{cite news|last=Berler|first=Ron|title=A's doomed by ex-Cubs?|newspaper=The Washington Times|date=October 16, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was again cited by Berler as a reason for the defeat of the league-leading [[1991 Pittsburgh Pirates season|1991 Pittsburgh Pirates]] in the [[1991 National League Championship Series]] to the Atlanta Braves.&lt;ref name=Berler-1991&gt;{{cite news|last=Berler|first=Ron|title=Agents of doom ; Ex-Cub Factor could jinx Pirates in postseason|newspaper=Washington Times|date=October 8, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mike Royko used the ex-Cubs factor to predict the playoff collapse of the 104-win [[1993 Atlanta Braves season|1993 Atlanta Braves]] (which did occur in the [[1993 National League Championship Series]]).&lt;ref name=Royko&gt;{{cite book|last=Royko|first=Mike|title=For the Love of Mike: More of the Best of Mike Royko|year=1999|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|url=http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/730735.html|quote=Reprint of article from October 5, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ex-Cubs factor hypothesis was used to predict the [[San Francisco Giants]] (with three ex-Cubs [[Shawon Dunston]], [[Benito Santiago]] and [[Tim Worrell]]) loss to the [[Anaheim Angels]] in the [[2002 World Series]].&lt;ref name=Berler-2002&gt;{{cite news|last=Berler|first=Ron|title=Chicago Mope|url=http://espn.go.com/magazine/berler_20021024.html|accessdate=2012-10-19|newspaper=ESPN The Magazine|date=October 24, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ex-Cubs factor hypothesis has also been used to explain the results of the [[2004 American League Championship Series]] (ALCS) and the [[2004 World Series]], both won by the [[Boston Red Sox]].  In the 2004 ALCS, the Yankees (with six ex-Cubs) lost a 3-0 game lead to the Boston Red Sox, the first time in Major League Baseball history.  The Red Sox (with only two ex-Cubs) then went on to defeat the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] (with three ex-Cubs) in the World Series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wherry|first=Aaron|title=Did 'Ex-Cub Factor' foil the Yankees?

==Cases against the Ex-Cubs Factor hypothesis==
Berler's study of the ex-Cub factor since 1945 revealed only one exception since 1945: the [[1960 Pittsburgh Pirates season|1960 Pittsburgh Pirates]], who won the World Series with three ex-Cubs on their roster.  Berler contends that one of those ex-Cubs, [[Don Hoak]], spent so little time in Chicago, that he did not fully develop what Berler called his "Cubness".  Berler quoted pitcher [[Jim Brosnan]] as saying that "Hoak is quite possibly the only man who ever conquered his Cubness".&lt;ref name=Berler-1981 /&gt;

The [[2001 Arizona Diamondbacks season|2001 Arizona Diamondbacks]] similarly had four ex-Cubs on their roster ([[Miguel Batista]], [[Mark Grace]], [[Mike Morgan (baseball)|Mike Morgan]], and [[Luis Gonzalez (outfielder)|Luis Gonzalez]]) but defeated the New York Yankees in the [[2001 World Series]].  [[Mark Grace]] declared in an post-game interview that "We beat the ex-Cub Factor!".&lt;ref name=Reynolds&gt;{{cite news|last=Reynolds|first=Dave|title=Ex-Cub Factor might be on wane|url=http://www.pjstar.com/sports/x576541274/Ex-Cub-Factor-might-be-on-wane|newspaper=Peoria Journal Star|date=October 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sympathy many fans felt for New York City following the [[September 11 attacks]], topped off by the four ex-Cubs on the Arizona roster, seemed to stack up against the Diamondbacks.  But Arizona won Game 6 in a lopsided score, and then won Game 7 in a come-from-behind finish, scoring a pair of runs in the ninth inning to win the Series. In fact, two of the four former Cubs played prominent roles in that ninth inning, [[Mark Grace]] getting a lead off single and [[Luis Gonzalez (outfielder)|Luis Gonzalez]] driving in the winning run with a single.

The 1960 Pittsburgh Pirates and the 2001 Arizona Diamondbacks (both with victories over the New York Yankees) are the only teams that have won the World Series in Game 7 [[Walk-off home run|walk-off]] victories.&lt;ref name=Reynolds /&gt;

The [[2008 Philadelphia Phillies season|2008 Philadelphia Phillies]] team was declared prior to the post-season by Berler as "doomed this year by the Ex-Cub Factor" (with three ex-Cubs [[Scott Eyre]], [[Jamie Moyer]], and [[Matt Stairs]] on their roster).&lt;ref name=Berler-2008&gt;{{cite news|last=Berler|first=Ron|title=Are the 2008 Cubs Doomed by the "Ex-Cub Factor"?|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/are-the-2008-cubs-doomed-by-the-ex-cub-factor/Content?oid=1106033|newspaper=Chicago Reader|date=October 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;   However, the Phillies defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers (a team also with three ex-Cubs) in the National League Championship Series and the [[Tampa Bay Rays]] (one ex-Cub) in the [[2008 World Series]].

==Applied to other teams==
The Ex-Cubs Factor hypothesis has been applied to other professional baseball teams in both positive and negative references.  For example, sports writer Jeff Blair has argued there exists an "ex-[[Expos]] factor" where number of former [[Montreal Expos]] players correlates with post-season success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Blair|first=Jeff|title=You can't win a Series without a few ex-Expos|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=October 27, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jim Caple for ESPN.com has similarly proposed an ex-[[Seattle Mariners|Mariners]] factor (or XMF) which explores the excellent play by ex-Mariners for other teams in postseason baseball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Caple|first=Jim|title=Examining the Ex-Mariners Factor|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/playoffs/2012/story/_/id/8509812/several-former-members-seattle-mariners-display-alcs|newspaper=ESPN.com|date=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Federally funded research and development centers''' ('''FFRDCs''') are [[public-private partnership]]s which conduct [[scientific research|research]] for the [[United States Government]].  They are administered in accordance with U.S. [[Code of Federal Regulations]], [[Federal Acquisition Regulation|Title 48]], Part 35, Section 35.017 by universities and corporations.  There are currently 42 recognized FFRDCs that are sponsored by the U.S. government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/ffrdclist/ | title = FMaster Government List of Federally Funded R&amp;D Centers | author = National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics |date=March 2017 | work = Statistics | publisher = [[National Science Foundation]] | location = [[Arlington, Virginia]] | accessdate = 2017-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  FFRDCs are similar to the [[University Affiliated Research Center]]s run by the [[United States Department of Defense]].

==History of FFRDCs==
During [[World War II]] scientists, engineers, mathematicians, and other specialists became part of the United States massive war effort—leading to evolutions in radar, aircraft, computing and, most famously, the development of nuclear weapons through the [[Manhattan Project]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}. The end of armed conflict did not end the need for organized research and development in support of the government.

As the [[Cold War]] became the new reality, government officials and their scientific advisors advanced the idea of a systematic approach to research, development, and acquisitions, one independent of the ups and downs of the marketplace and free of the restrictions on civil service. From this idea arose the concept of FFRDCs—private entities that would work almost exclusively on behalf of the government, be free of organizational conflicts of interest, and maintain a stable workforce composed of highly trained technical talent.

The [[U.S. Air Force]] created the first FFRDC, the [[RAND Corporation]], in 1947. Others grew directly out of their wartime roles. For example, [[MIT Lincoln Laboratory]], founded in 1951, originated as the Radiation Laboratory at MIT, and the Navy's Operation Research Group evolved into the Center for Naval Analyses. The first FFRDCs served the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]. Since then, other government organizations have sponsored FFRDCs to meet their specific needs. In 1969, the number of FFRDCs peaked at 74.&lt;ref&gt;Dale, Bruce C. and Timothy D. Moy.

'''Geoprofessions''' is a term coined by the Geoprofessional Business Association to connote various technical disciplines that involve engineering, earth and environmental services applied to below-ground (“subsurface”), ground-surface, and ground-surface-connected conditions, structures, or formations. The principal disciplines include, as major categories:
* [[geomatics engineering]]
* [[#Geotechnical-engineering specialties|geotechnical engineering]];
* [[#Engineering geology and other geology specialties|geology and engineering geology]];
* [[#Geological engineering|geological engineering]];
* [[#Geophysics|geophysics]];
* [[#Geophysical engineering|geophysical engineering]];
* [[#Environmental-science and environmental-engineering specialties|environmental science and environmental engineering]];
* [[#Construction-materials engineering and testing (CoMET)|construction-materials engineering and testing]]; and
* [[#Other geoprofessional services|other geoprofessional services]].

Each discipline involves specialties, many of which are recognized through professional designations that governments and societies or associations confer based upon a person’s education, training, experience, and educational accomplishments. In the United States, engineers must be licensed in the state or territory where they practice engineering. Most states license geologists and several license environmental “site professionals.” Several states license engineering geologists and recognize geotechnical engineering through a geotechnical-engineering titling act.

==Geotechnical-engineering specialties==
{{main|Geotechnical engineering}}
Although geotechnical engineering is applied for a variety of purposes, it is essential to foundation design. As such, geotechnical engineering is applicable to every existing or new structure on the planet; every building and every highway, bridge, tunnel, harbor, airport, water line, reservoir, or other public work. Commonly, the geotechnical-engineering service comprises a study of subsurface conditions using various sampling, in-situ testing, and/or other site-characterization techniques. The instrument of professional service in those cases typically is a report through which geotechnical engineers relate the information they have been retained to provide, typically: their findings; their opinions about subsurface materials and conditions; their judgment about how the subsurface materials and conditions assumed to exist probably will behave when subjected to loads or used as building material; and their preliminary recommendations for materials usage or appropriate foundation systems, the latter based on their knowledge of a structure’s size, shape, weight, etc., and the subsurface/structure interactions likely to occur. [[Civil engineers]], [[structural engineers]], and [[architects]], feasibly among other members of the project team, apply the geotechnical findings and preliminary recommendations to take the structure’s design forward. They realize these preliminary recommendations are subject to change, however, because – as a matter of practical necessity related to the [[Observational method (geotechnics)|observational method]] inherent to geotechnical engineering – geotechnical engineers base their recommendations on the composition of samples taken from a tiny portion of a site whose actual subsurface conditions are unknowable before excavation, because they are hidden by earth and/or rock and/or water. For this reason, as a key component of a complete geotechnical engineering service, geotechnical engineers employ construction-materials engineering and testing (CoMET) to observe subsurface materials as they are exposed through excavation. To help achieve economies on their clients’ behalf, geotechnical engineers assign their field representatives – specially educated and trained paraprofessionals – to observe the excavated materials and the excavations themselves in light of conditions the geotechnical engineers opined to exist. When differences are discovered, the geotechnical engineers evaluate the new findings and, when necessary, modify their design and construction recommendations. Because such changes could require other members of the design and construction team to modify their designs, specifications, and proposed methods, many owners have their geotechnical engineers serve as active members of the project team from project inception to conclusion, working with others to help ensure appropriate application of geotechnical information and judgments.

In other cases, geotechnical engineering goes beyond a study and construction recommendations to include design of soil and rock structures. The most common of these are the [[Road surface|pavements]] that make up our streets and highways, airport runways, and bridge and tunnel decks, among other paved improvements. Geotechnical engineers design the pavements in terms of the subgrade, subbase, and base layers of materials to be used, and the thickness and composition of each. Geotechnical engineers also design the earth-retention walls associated with structures such as levees, earthen dams, reservoirs, and landfills. In other cases, the design is applied to contain earth, via structures such as excavation-support systems and retaining walls. Sometimes referred to as geostructural engineering or geostructural design, these services are also intrinsic to [[hydraulic engineering]], [[Hydrogeological|hydrogeologic engineering]], [[coastal engineering]], geologic engineering and [[Civil engineering#Water resources engineering|water-resources engineering]]. Geotechnical-engineering design is also applied for structures such as tunnels, bridges, dams, and other structures beneath, on, or connected to the surface of the earth. Geotechnical engineering, like geology, engineering geology, and geologic engineering, also involves the specialties of [[rock mechanics]] and [[soil mechanics]], and often requires knowledge of [[geotextiles]] and [[geosynthetics]], as well as an array of instrumentation and monitoring equipment, to help ensure specified conditions are achieved and maintained.

[[Earthquake engineering]] and landslide detection, remediation, and prevention are geoprofessional services associated with specialized types of geotechnical engineering (as well as [[#Geophysics|geophysics]]; see below), as is forensic geotechnical engineering, a geoprofessional service applied to determine why a certain applicable type of event – usually a failure of some sort – occurred. (Virtually all geoprofessional services can be performed for forensic purposes, commonly as litigation-support/[[expert witness]] services.) [[Railway systems engineering|Railway-systems engineering]] is another type of specialized geotechnical engineering, as are the design of [[piers]] and [[Bulkhead (barrier)|bulkheads]], [[drydocks]], on-shore and off-shore [[Wind turbine|wind-turbine]] systems, and systems that stabilize [[oil platforms]] and other marine structures to the sea floor.

Geotechnical engineers have long been involved in [[sustainability]] initiatives, including  (among many others) the use of excavated materials; the safe application of contaminated subsurface materials; the recycling of asphalt, concrete, and building rubble and debris; and the design of [[permeable paving|permeable pavements]].

All [[Civil engineering|civil-engineering]] specialties and projects – roads and highways, bridges, rail systems, ports and other waterfront structures, airport terminals, etc. – require the involvement of geotechnical engineers and engineering, meaning that many civil-engineering pursuits are geoprofessional pursuits to a greater or lesser degree. However, geotechnical engineering has for centuries also been associated with [[military engineering]]; [[sappers]] (in general) and [[miners]] (whose tunneling design services (known as [[Mining (military)|landmining]] and [[Mining (military)|undermining]]) were used in military-siege operations).

==Engineering geology and other geology specialties==
{{main|Geology|Engineering geology}}
Engineering geologist.
(a) Elements of the engineering geologist specialty. 
The practice of engineering geology involves the interpretation, evaluation, analysis, and application of geological information and data to civil works. Geotechnical soil and rock units are designated, characterized, and classified, using standard engineering soil and rock classification systems. Relationships are interpreted between landform development, current and past geologic processes, ground and surface water, and the strength characteristics of soil and rock. Processes evaluated include both surficial processes (for example, slope, fluvial, and coastal processes), and deep-seated processes (for example, volcanic activity and seismicity). Geotechnical zones or domains are designated based on soil and rocked geological strength characteristics, common landforms, related geologic processes, or other pertinent factors. Proposed developmental modifications are evaluated and, where appropriate, analyzed to predict potential or likely changes in types and rates of surficial geologic processes. Proposed modifications may include such things as vegetation removal, using various types of earth materials in construction, applying loads to shallow or deep foundations, constructing cut or fill slopes and other grading, and modifying ground and surface water flow. The effects of surficial and deep-seated geologic processes are evaluated and analyzed to predict their potential effect on public health, public safety, land use, or proposed development.
(b) Typical engineering geologic applications and types of projects. Engineering geology is applied during all project phases, from conception through planning, design, construction, maintenance, and, in some cases, reclamation and closure. Planning-level engineering geologic work is commonly conducted in response to forest practice regulations, critical areas ordinances, and the State Environmental Policy Act. Typical planning-level engineering geologic applications include timber harvest planning, proposed location of residential and commercial developments and other buildings and facilities, and alternative route selection for roads, rail lines, trails, and utilities. Site-specific engineering geologic applications include cuts, fills, and tunnels for roads, trails, railroads, and utility lines; foundations for bridges and other drainage structures, retaining walls and shoring, dams, buildings, water towers, slope, channel and shoreline stabilization facilities, fish ladders and hatcheries, ski lifts and other structures; landings for logging and other work platforms; airport landing strips; rock bolt systems; blasting; and other major earthwork projects such as for aggregate sources and landfills.

While engineering geology is applicable principally to planning, design and construction activities, other specialties of geology are applied in a variety of geoprofessional specialty fields, such as [[mining geology]], [[petroleum geology]], and [[environmental geology]]. Note that mining geology and [[mining engineering]] are different geoprofessional fields.

==Geological engineering==
{{distinguish|Climate engineering}}
'''Geological engineering''' is a hybrid discipline that comprises elements of [[civil engineering]], [[mining engineering]], [[petroleum engineering]], and [[earth sciences]]. Geological engineers often become licensed as both engineers and geologists. There are thirteen geological-engineering (or '''geoengineering''') programs in the United States that are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission (EAC) of ABET: (1) Colorado School of Mines, (2) Michigan Technological University, (3) Missouri University of Science and Technology, (4) Montana Tech of the University of Montana, (5) South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, (6) University of Alaska-Fairbanks, (7) [[University of Minnesota]] Twin Cities, (8) [[University of Mississippi]], (9) [[University of Nevada, Reno]] (10) University of North Dakota, (11) University of Texas at Austin, (12) University of Utah, and (13) University of Wisconsin-Madison.

Other schools offer programs or classes in geological engineering, including the [[University of Arizona]].

'''Geoengineering''' or '''geological engineering''', [[engineering geology]], and [[geotechnical engineering]] deal with the discovery, development, and production and use of subsurface earth resources, as well as the design and construction of [[earthworks (engineering)|earthworks]]. Geoengineering is the application of [[geosciences]], where mechanics, mathematics, physics, chemistry, and geology are used to understand and shape our interaction with the earth.

Geoengineers work in areas of
# [[mining]], including surface and subsurface [[Earthworks (engineering)|excavation]]s, and [[rock burst]] mitigation
# energy, including [[hydraulic fracturing]] and [[Boring (earth)|drilling]] for exploration and production of water, oil, or gas
# infrastructure, including [[Rapid transit|underground transportation]] systems and isolation of [[nuclear waste|nuclear]] and [[hazardous waste]]s; and
# environment, including [[groundwater flow]], contaminant transport and remediation, and hydraulic structures.

Professional [[List of geoscience organizations|geoscience organizations]] such as the [[American Rock Mechanics Association]] or the [[Geo-Institute]] and academic degrees such as the bachelor of geoengineering accredited by [[ABET]] acknowledge the broad scope of work practiced by geoengineers and stress fundamentals of science and engineering methods for the solution of complex problems. Geoengineers study the mechanics of rock, [[soil mechanics|soil]], and fluids to improve the sustainable use of earth’s finite resources, where problems appear with competing interests, for example, groundwater and waste isolation, [[Offshore drilling|offshore]] [[oil drilling]] and risk of spills, natural gas production and [[induced seismicity]].

==Geophysics==
{{main|Geophysics|Exploration geophysics}}
Geophysics is the study of the physical properties of the earth using quantitative physical methods to determine what lies beneath the earth's surface.  The physical properties of concern include the propagation of elastic waves (seismic), magnetism, gravity, electrical resistivity/conductivity, and electromagnetism.  Geophysics has historically been most commonly used in oil exploration and mining, but its popularity in non-destructive investigative work has flourished since the early 1990s.  It is also used in groundwater exploration and protection, geo-hazard studies (e.g., faults and landslides), alignment studies (e.g., proposed roadway, underground utilities, and pipelines), foundation studies, contamination characterization and remediation, landfill investigations, unexploded-ordnance investigations, vibration monitoring, dam-safety evaluation, location of underground storage tanks, identification of subsurface voids, and assisting in archeological investigations. (definition from Association of Environmental &amp; Engineering Geologists)

==Geophysical engineering==
'''Geophysical engineering''' is the application of geophysics to the engineering design of facilities including roads, tunnels, and mines.

==Environmental-science and environmental-engineering specialties==
{{main|Environmental science|Environmental engineering}}
Environmental science and environmental engineering are the geoprofessions commonly associated with the identification, remediation, and prevention of environmental contamination. These services range from phase-one and phase-two [[Environmental Site Assessment|environmental site-assessments]] – research designed to assess the likelihood that a property is contaminated and subsurface exploration conducted to identify the nature and extent of contamination, respectively – up through the design of processes and systems to remediate contaminated sites for the protection of human health and the environment.

[[Environmental geology]] is one of the principal geoprofessions engaged in assessing and remediating contaminated sites. Environmental geologists help identify the subsurface [[stratigraphy]] in which contaminants are located and through which they migrate. [[Environmental chemistry]] is the geoprofession that encompasses the study of chemical compounds in the soil.  These compounds are categorized as pollutants or contaminants when introduced into the environment by human factors (e.g., waste, mining processes, radioactive release) and are not of natural origin. Environmental chemistry assesses interactions or these compounds with soil, rock, and water to determine their fate and transport, the techniques to measure the levels of contaminants in the environment, and technologies to destroy or reduce the toxicity of contaminants in wastes or compounds that have been released to the environment. [[Environmental engineering]] is often applied to assess contaminated sites, but more often is used in the design of systems to remediate contaminated soil and groundwater.

[[Hydrogeology]] is the geoprofession involved when environmental studies involve subsurface water. Hydrogeology applications range from securing safe, plentiful underground drinking-water sources to identifying the nature of groundwater contamination in order to facilitate remediation. [[Environmental toxicology]] is a geoprofession when used to identify the source, fate, transformation, effects, and risks of pollutants on the environment, including soil, water, and air. [[Society of Wetland Scientists|Wetlands science]] is a geoprofessional pursuit that incorporates several scientific disciplines, such as [[botany]], [[biology]], and [[limnology]]. It involves, among other activities, the delineation, conservation, restoration, and preservation of wetlands. These services are sometimes conducted by geoprofessional specialists called [[Society of Wetland Scientists|wetlands scientists]]. [[Ecology]] is a closely related environmental geoprofession involving studies into the distribution of organisms and biodiversity within an environmental context.
 
Numerous geoprofessional disciplines contribute to the redevelopment of [[brownfields]], sites (typically urban) that are underused or abandoned because they are or are assumed to be contaminated by hazardous materials. Geoprofessionals are engaged to evaluate the degree to which such sites are contaminated and the steps that can be taken to achieve the sites’ safe reuse. Environmental engineers and scientists work with developers to identify and design remediation strategies and exposure-barrier designs that protect future site users from unacceptable exposure to environmental contamination resulting from previous uses of the site. Because these previous uses often resulted in degraded soil conditions and the presence of abandoned, underground structures, geotechnical engineers often are needed to design special foundations for the new structures.

==Construction-materials engineering and testing (CoMET)==
Construction-materials engineering and testing (CoMET) comprises an array of licensed-engineer-directed professional services applied principally for purposes of construction quality assurance and quality control. CoMET services commonly are provided as a separate discipline by firms that also practice geotechnical engineering, possibly among other geoprofessional disciplines. The geoprofessional-service industry has evolved in this manner because geotechnical engineering employs the observational method. [[Karl von Terzaghi]] and [[Ralph B. Peck]] – the creators of modern geotechnical engineering – used the [[Observational method (geotechnics)|observational method]] and multiple working hypotheses to expedite and economize the subsurface-exploration process, by using sampling and testing to form a judgment about subsurface conditions, and then observing excavated conditions and materials to confirm or modify those judgments and related recommendations, and then finalize them. To economize still further, geoprofessionals educated and trained paraprofessionals to represent them on site (hence the term “field representative”), especially to apply their judgment (much as a geotechnical engineer would) in comparing observed conditions with those the geotechnical engineer believed would exist. Over time, geotechnical engineers expanded their CoMET services by providing the additional education and training their field representatives needed to evaluate constructors’ attainment of conditions commonly specified by geoprofessionals; e.g., subsurface preparation for foundations of buildings, roadways, and other structures; materials used for subgrade, subbase, and base purposes; site grading; construction of earthen structures (earth dams, levees, reservoirs, landfills, et al.) and earth-retaining structures (e.g., retaining walls); and so on. Because many of the materials involved, such as concrete, are used in other elements of construction projects and structures, geoprofessional firms expanded their field representatives’ skill sets still more, to encompass observation and testing of numerous additional materials (e.g., reinforced concrete, structural steel, masonry, wood, and fireproofing), processes (e.g., cutting and filling and rebar placement), and outcomes (e.g., the effectiveness of welds). Laboratory services are a common element of many CoMET operations. Also operating under the direction of a licensed engineer, they are applied in geotechnical engineering to evaluate subsurface-material samples. In overall CoMET operations, laboratories operate with the equipment and personnel required to evaluate a variety of construction materials.

CoMET services applied to evaluate the actual composition of a site’s subsurface are part of a complete geotechnical engineering service. For purposes of short-term economy, however, some owners select a firm not associated with the geotechnical engineer of record to provide these and all other CoMET services. This approach precludes the geotechnical engineer of record from providing a complete service. It also aggravates risk, because the individuals engaged to evaluate actual subsurface conditions are not “briefed” by the geotechnical engineer of record before they go to the project site and seldom communicate with the geotechnical engineer of record when they discern differences, in large part because the firm associated with the geotechnical engineer of record is regarded as a competitor of the firm employing the field representatives. In some cases, the field representatives in question lack the specific project background information and/or the education and training required to discern those differences.

CoMET services applied to evaluate constructor’s attainment of specified conditions take the form of quality-assurance (QA) or quality-control (QC) services. QA services are performed directly or indirectly for the owner. The owner specifies the nature and extent of QA services that the owner believes is appropriate. Some owners specify none at all or only those that may be required by law. Those required by law are imposed via a jurisdiction’s [[building code]]. Almost all U.S. jurisdictions base their building codes on “model codes” developed by associations of building officials. The [[International Code Council|International Code Council (ICC)]] is the most prominent of these groups and its [[International Building Code (IBC)]] is the most commonly used model. As a result, many jurisdictions now require IBC “Special Inspection,” a term defined by the IBC as “the required examination of the materials, installation, fabrication, erection, or placement of components and connections requiring special expertise to ensure compliance with approved construction documents and referenced standards.” Special Inspection requirements vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction based on the provisions adopted by the local building official. While some of the services involved may be similar to or the same as conventional CoMET services, Special Inspection is handled differently. Most commonly, the owner or the owner’s agent is required to retain a building-official-approved Special Inspection-services provider. Special Inspection is often required to obtain a certificate of occupancy.

QC services are those applied by or on behalf of a constructor to ensure the constructor has attained conditions the constructor has contractually agreed to attain. Most CoMET consultants are engaged far more to provide QA services than QC services.

Many CoMET procedures are specified in standards developed by [[Standards organization#Standard-developing organizations .28SDOs.29|standards-developing organizations (SDOs)]] such as the [[American Society of Civil Engineers|American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)]], [[ASTM International]], and [[American Concrete Institute|American Concrete Institute (ACI)]], using standards-development protocols approved by the [[American National Standards Institute|American National Standards Institute (ANSI)]] and/or the [[International Organization for Standardization|International Organization for Standardization (ISO)]]. All such standards identify what is minimally required to conform. Likewise, several organizations have developed programs to accredit CoMET field and laboratory services to perform certain types of testing and inspection. Some of these programs are more comprehensive than others; e.g., requiring regular calibration of equipment, participation in proficiency testing programs, and implementation and documentation of a (quality) management system to demonstrate technical competence. As with all such programs, of course, accreditation identifies what is least acceptable. Many CoMET laboratories go far beyond minimum requirements in an effort to attain higher levels of quality.

A variety of organizations – including local building departments – have developed personnel-certification protocols and requirements. In many jurisdictions, only appropriately certified individuals are permitted to perform certain evaluations. Individuals typically are required to meet certain prerequisites for certification and must pass examinations, in some cases involving performance observation in the field. The prerequisite for higher degrees of certification often include a requirement that the individual has met requirements for a lower degree of certification (e.g., Soils Technician I is in some cases a prerequisite for Soils Technician II). It should be noted that field representatives are sometimes referred to as “soil testers,” “technicians,” “technicians/technologists,” or “engineering technicians.” The Geoprofessional Business Association developed the term “field representative” to encompass all the many types of paraprofessionals involved (e.g., those involved with specific types of materials, such as reinforced concrete, soil, or steel; those who observe or inspect processes or conditions, such as welding inspectors, caisson inspectors, and foundation inspectors), and especially to underscore their significant, mutual responsibility, that purpose titles such as “technician” fail to signify. In fact, the engineers who direct CoMET operations are personally and professionally responsible and liable for their field representatives’ acts and statements while representing the engineer on site.

Especially because CoMET consultants have more hands-on experience with construction activities than many other design-team members, many owners involve them (among other geoprofessionals) from the outset of a project, during the design phase, to help the owner and/or design team members develop technical specifications and establish testing and inspection requirements, instrumentation requirements and procedures, and observation programs. Geotechnical engineers employ CoMET services during the earliest stages of a project, to oversee subsurface sampling procedures, such as drilling.

Many of the CoMET services performed for construction projects are performed for environmental projects as well, but requirements tend to be less rigid because they involve fewer licensing and related requirements. For example, individuals may perform federally mandated all-appropriate inquiries – typically a phase-one environmental site assessment – without a license of any kind.

==Other geoprofessional services==
To the extent that [[archeology]] and [[paleontology]] require systematic subsurface excavation to recover artifacts, they, too, are considered geoprofessions. Many geoprofessional-services firms offer these services to those of their clients that need to satisfy federal and/or state regulations that require paleontological and/or archeological inquiry before site development or redevelopment activities can proceed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7194">The '''Gladstone–Dale relation''' (J. H. Gladstone and T. P. Dale, 1864) is a mathematical relation used for optical analysis of liquids, the determination of composition from optical measurements. It can also be used to calculate the [[density]] of a liquid for use in [[fluid dynamics]] (e.g., flow visualization; Merzkirch 1987). The relation has also been used to calculate [[refractive index]] of glass and [[minerals]] in [[optical mineralogy]] (Mandarino 2007).

In the Gladstone–Dale relation, (n−1)/ρ = sum(km), the [[index of refraction]] (n) or the [[density]] (ρ in g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) of miscible liquids that are mixed in mass fraction (m) can be calculated from characteristic optical constants (the [[molar refractivity]] k in cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/g) of pure molecular end-members. For example, for any mass (m) of ethanol added to a mass of water, the alcohol content is determined by measuring density or index of refraction ([[Brix]] [[refractometer]]).

Mass (m) per unit volume (V) is the density m/V. Mass is conserved on mixing, but the volume of 1&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of ethanol mixed with 1&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of water is reduced to less than 2&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; due to the formation of ethanol-water bonds. The plot of volume or density versus molecular fraction of ethanol in water is a quadratic curve. However, the plot of index of refraction versus molecular fraction of ethanol in water is linear, and the weight fraction equals the fractional density (d; Teertstra 2005).

The Gladstone–Dale relation can be expressed as an equation of state by re-arranging the terms to (n−1)V = sum(kdm). The macroscopic values (n) and (V) determined on bulk material are now calculated as a sum of atomic or molecular properties. Each molecule has a characteristic mass (due to the atomic weights of the elements) and atomic or molecular volume that contributes to the bulk density, and a characteristic refractivity due to a characteristic electric structure that contributes to the net index of refraction.

The refractivity of a single molecule is the refractive volume k(MW)/An in nm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, where MW is the molecular weight and An is Avogadro's number. To calculate the optical properties of materials using the polarizability or refractivity volumes in nm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, the Gladstone–Dale relation competes with the [[Kramers–Kronig relation]] and [[Lorentz–Lorenz equation|Lorentz–Lorenz relation]] but differs in optical theory (Jaffe 1988).

The index of refraction (n) is calculated from the change of angle of a collimated monochromatic beam of light from vacuum into liquid using [[Snell's law]] for [[refraction]]. Using the theory of light as an electromagnetic wave (Iksander 1992), light takes a straight-line path through water at reduced speed (v) and wavelength (λ). The ratio v/λ is a constant equal to the frequency (ν) of the light, as is the quantized (photon) energy using [[Planck's constant]] and E = hν. Compared to the constant speed of light in a vacuum (c), the index of refraction of water is n = c/v.

The Gladstone–Dale term (n−1) is the non-linear optical path length or time delay. Using [[Isaac Newton]]'s theory of light as a stream of particles refracted locally by (electric) forces acting between atoms, the optic path length is due to refraction at constant speed by displacement about each atom. For light passing through 1 m of water with n = 1.33, light traveled an extra 0.33 m compared to light that traveled 1 m in a straight line in vacuum. As the [[speed of light]] is a ratio (distance per unit time in m/s), light also took an extra 0.33 s to travel through water compared to light traveling 1 s in vacuum.

The Gladstone–Dale relation requires a particle model of light because the continuous wave-front required by wave theory cannot be maintained if light encounters atoms or molecules that maintain a local electric structure with a characteristic refractivity. Similarly, the wave theory cannot explain the photoelectric effect or absorption by individual atoms and one requires a local particle of light (see [[wave–particle duality]]).

In the 1900s, the Gladstone–Dale relation was applied to glass, synthetic crystals and [[minerals]]. Average values for the refractivity of oxides such as MgO or SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; give good to excellent agreement between the calculated and measured average indices of refraction of minerals (Mandarino 2007). However, specific values of refractivity are required to deal with different structure-types (Eggleton 1991), and the relation required modification to deal with structural polymorphs and the [[birefringence]] of anisotropic crystal structures.

In recent optical crystallography, Gladstone–Dale constants for the refractivity of ions were related to the inter-ionic distances and angles of the [[crystal structure]]. The ionic refractivity depends on 1/d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where d is the inter-ionic distance, indicating that a particle-like photon refracts locally due to the electrostatic [[Coulomb force]] between ions (Teertstra 2008a).
 
A local model of light consistent with these electrostatic refraction calculations occurs if the electromagnetic energy is restricted to a finite region of space. An electric-charge monopole must occur perpendicular to dipole loops of magnetic flux, but if local mechanisms for propagation are required, a periodic oscillatory exchange of electromagnetic energy occurs with transient mass. In the same manner, a change of mass occurs as an electron binds to a proton. This local photon has zero rest mass and no net charge, but has wave properties with spin-1 symmetry on trace over time. In this modern version of Newton's corpuscular theory of light, the local photon acts as a probe of the molecular or crystal structure (Teertstra 2008b).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5881">The '''International Association of People-Environment Studies''' (IAPS), has been promoting the interdisciplinary exchange of ideas between planning and social scientists for 35 years – above all between spatial planning, architecture, psychology, and sociology. IAPS was officially founded in 1981, although its origins can be traced back to a series of successful conferences in several European countries from 1969 to 1979.

The objectives of IAPS are:
*To facilitate communication among those concerned with the relationships between people and their physical environment
*To stimulate research and innovation for improving human well-being and the physical environment
*To promote the integration of research, education, policy and practice

People-environment studies, originating from [[environmental psychology]] ([[Kurt Lewin|Lewin]], Barker, [[Egon Brunswik|Brunswik]]), have always tried to close the “mind gaps” between natural sciences, engineering, arts, and social sciences by an [[epistemological]] approach that encompasses denotations (objects and techniques) as well as connotations (subjective social, cultural meanings). 

==Membership==
Benefits of membership include:
*  The right to vote and stand for membership of the Board
* Reduced fees for attending conferences and seminars
* Free copies of the IAPS newsletter. This contains research summaries, articles, reviews, letters, lists of references, and general news of the research field
* The right to be listed in and receive a copy of the Directory of IAPS members
* Reduced subscription rates for specified journals

==List of conferences==
The [[academic conference|biannual conference]] is the main event organised under auspices of the association. In the past years, the following [[academic conference|conferences]] have been organised:

The principal '''laws of association''' are [[Contiguity (psychology)|contiguity]], [[Repetition (rhetorical device)|repetition]], [[attention]], [[Pleasure paradox|pleasure-pain]], and [[Gestalt Psychology#Gestalt laws of grouping|similarity]].  The basic laws were formulated by [[Aristotle]] in approximately 300 B.C. and by [[John Locke]] in the seventeenth century.

A '''leaflet''' (occasionally called '''foliole''') in [[botany]] is a leaf-like part of a [[compound leaf]].&lt;ref name="WaltersKeil1996"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walters|first1=Dirk R.|last2=Keil|first2=David J.|title=Vascular Plant Taxonomy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZbaNxSnNoecC&amp;pg=PA33|edition=4th|year=1996|publisher=Kendall Hunt Publishing Company|language=en|isbn=978-0-7872-2108-9|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though it resembles an [[entire leaf]], a leaflet is not borne on a main [[plant stem]] or branch, as a leaf is, but rather on a [[leaf|petiole]] or a branch of the leaf. Compound leaves are common in many plant families and they differ widely in [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]]. The two main classes of compound leaf morphology are [[Leaf shape|palmate]] and [[pinnate]].
For example, a ''[[Cannabis|hemp]]'' plant has palmate compound leaves, whereas some species of ''[[Acacia]]'' have pinnate leaves.

The ultimate free division (or leaflet) of a compound leaf, or a pinnate subdivision of a multipinnate leaf is called a '''[[pinnule]]''' or '''pinnula'''.

The '''Fellowship of the Australian Academy of Science''' is made up of about 500 Australian scientists.

Scientists judged by their [[peer group|peers]] to have made an exceptional contribution to knowledge in their field may be elected to Fellowship of the [[Australian Academy of Science|Academy]]. [[Fellow]]s are often denoted using the post-nominal '''FAA''' (Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science).

A small number of distinguished foreign scientists with substantial connections to Australian science are elected as Corresponding Members.

Fellows are appointed for life; this table also contains deceased fellows.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="54253">Most sovereign states have '''alternative names'''. Some countries have also undergone [[Geographical renaming|name changes]] for political or other reasons. This article attempts to give all known alternative names and initialisms for all nations, countries, and sovereign states, in English and any predominant or official languages of the country in question.

Countries are listed alphabetically by their ''description'', the most common name or term that is politically neutral and unambiguous. This may be followed by a note as to the status of the description used.

The following contains a '''list of coronal mass ejections'''. A [[coronal mass ejection]] (CME) is a massive burst of [[solar wind]] and magnetic fields rising above the solar corona or being released into space. Most ejections originate from active regions on the Sun's surface, such as groupings of sunspots associated with frequent flares.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9804">During the 1980s, most [[digital forensics|digital forensic investigations]] consisted of "live analysis", examining digital media directly using non-specialist tools. In the 1990s, several [[freeware]] and other proprietary tools (both hardware and software) were created to allow investigations to take place without modifying media. This first set of tools mainly focused on [[computer forensics]], although in recent years similar tools have evolved for the field of mobile device forensics.&lt;ref name="casey" /&gt; This list includes notable examples of digital forensic tools.

==Memory forensics==
{{main|memory forensics}}
Memory forensics tools are used to acquire and/or analyze a computer's volatile memory (RAM).  They are often used in incident response situations to preserve evidence in memory that would be lost when a system is shutdown, and to quickly detect stealthy malware by directly examining the operating system and other running software in memory.

==Software forensics==
{{main|software forensics}}
Software forensics is the science of analyzing software source code or binary code to determine whether intellectual property infringement or theft occurred. It is the centerpiece of lawsuits, trials, and settlements when companies are in dispute over issues involving software patents, copyrights, and trade secrets. Software forensics tools can compare code to determine correlation, a measure that can be used to guide a software forensics expert.

&lt;!--NOTE TO EDITORS: Please do not link general ecoregion articles such as [[Taiga]] or general place articles such as [[Cascade Range]]. This list is for the ecoregions defined under the CEC classification, and articles linked here should be about the specific units defined by the CEC. See [[User:Northwesterner1/notes]] for a rationale. NOTE TO EDITORS--&gt;

This '''list of ecoregions in the United States''' provides an overview of [[United States]] [[ecoregions]] designated by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) and the [[Commission for Environmental Cooperation]] (CEC). The CEC was established in 1994 by the member states of [[Canada]], [[Mexico]], and the [[United States]] to address regional environmental concerns under the [[North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation]] (NAAEC), the environmental side accord to the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA). The Commission's 1997 report, ''Ecological Regions of North America'', provides a framework that may be used by government agencies, [[non-governmental organization]]s, and academic researchers as a basis for [[Risk management|risk analysis]], [[natural resource management|resource management]], and [[environmental science|environmental study]] of the continent's [[ecosystem]]s.&lt;ref name=CEC&gt;{{cite web | publisher=[[Commission for Environmental Cooperation]] | title=Ecological Regions of North America: Toward a Common Perspective | url=http://www.cec.org/files/PDF/BIODIVERSITY/eco-eng_EN.pdf | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109050656/http://www.cec.org/files/PDF/BIODIVERSITY/eco-eng_EN.pdf| archivedate=2009-01-09| year=1997 | accessdate=2008-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States, the EPA and the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) are the principal federal agencies working with the CEC to define and map ecoregions. Ecoregions may be identified by similarities in [[geology]], [[physiography]], [[vegetation]], [[climate]], [[soil]]s, [[land use]], [[wildlife]] distributions, and [[hydrology]].

The classification system has four levels, but only Levels I and III are shown on this list. '''Level I''' divides North America into 15 broad ecoregions; of these, 12 lie partly or wholly within the United States. Fifty '''Level II''' regions were created to allow for a narrower delineation of Level I areas. Three level I areas were not subdivided for level 2.&lt;ref name="urlUS EPA-WEP"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Level III''' subdivides the continent into 182 smaller ecoregions; of these, 104 lie partly or wholly with the United States.&lt;ref name=CEC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Ecoregion Maps and GIS Resources | publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] | url=https://www.epa.gov/eco-research/ecoregions | accessdate=2008-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Level IV''' is a further subdivision of Level III ecoregions. Level IV mapping is still underway but is complete across most of the United States. For an example of Level IV data, see [[List of ecoregions in Oregon]] and the associated articles. The classification system excludes the [[U.S. state]] of [[Hawaii]], which is not part of the North American mainland.

&lt;!--NOTE TO EDITORS: Please do not link general ecoregion articles such as [[Taiga]] or general place articles such as [[Cascade Range]]. This list is for the ecoregions defined under the CEC classification, and articles linked here should be about the specific units defined by the CEC. See [[User:Northwesterner1/notes]] for a rationale. NOTE TO EDITORS--&gt;

[[Image:MyOcean logo.jpg|200px|right]]'''MyOcean''' is a series of projects granted by the [[European Commission]] within the [[GMES]] Program ([[Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development|Seventh Framework Program]]), whose objective is to define and to set up a concerted and integrated pan-European capacity for ocean monitoring and forecasting. The activities benefit several specified areas of use: Maritime security, [[oil spill]] prevention, marine resources management, [[climate change]], [[seasonal forecasting]], coastal activities, ice sheet surveys, [[water quality]] and pollution. The series of MyOcean projects ended in 2015, and their services are now continued by the [[Copernicus Programme]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mercator-ocean.fr/eng/mercator_ocean/programmes-copernicus&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==
MyOcean's objective is to set up (definition, design, development and validation) an integrated pan-European capability for ocean monitoring and forecasting, using nationally available skills and resources.

Although the budgetary frame of the project is labelled "Research", the priority is not to conduct further scientific research in the field of operational oceanography, even if this aspect is also taken into account. It is more a question of developing a System of Systems (in the industrial sense), according to the European quality standards, and to achieve operational qualification and eventually qualification of Service.

==Context==
The first '''MyOcean''' project started on 1 January 2009, scheduled to last for 39 months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmes.info/pages-principales/projects/marine-projects/more-on-myocean/ GMES on MyOcean]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a follow-up to the MERSEA project (FP6: system implementation phase: 2004-2008), and also integrates some service lines developed as part of ESA's GSE (GMES Service Elements) projects, particularly Marcoast and PolarView.

The follow up project '''MyOcean2''' runs from April 2012 to September 2014 to ensure a controlled continuation and extension of the services and systems already implemented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cordis.europa.eu/search/index.cfm?fuseaction=proj.document&amp;PJ_LANG=EN&amp;PJ_RCN=12533467&amp;pid=19&amp;q=7D33B45E243BC05C85AEC57A012536AC&amp;type=adv Prototype Operational Continuity for the GMES Ocean Monitoring and Forecasting Service]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Figures==
'''MyOcean''' is a consortium of 60 partners in 28 countries (the 22 states of the EU-27 that have a sea coastline, plus Norway, Russia, Ukraine, Morocco, Israel and Canada). 
Two European bodies ([[Joint Research Centre|JRC]] and [[European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts|ECMWF]]) are also partners of 'MyOcean'. The ([[European Environment Agency]]) and the ([[European Maritime Safety Agency]]) are represented on the Board.

The total budget was €55M, of which €33.8M comes from a European Commission subsidy (representing 61% of the total budget), over 36 months.
This budget essentially corresponded to staff costs (83.5%), with the second largest item being mission expenses (7.3% of the total budget). Management costs (and external communication costs) represented 4.1% of the total budget. Equipment fees represented 3%.

The total workload corresponded to the equivalent of 190 full-time employees, but in practical terms, there were more than 350 people involved in the project.

The total budget og MyOcean2 was €41M.

==Organisation==
The project is coordinated between the executive level (the Executive Committee) and the strategic level (the Board). The role of the 'Governing Body' is to take high-level decisions that affect the project at a strategic level, the major themes, the budget or the make-up of the consortium.

On the 'Board' the following are represented:
- Senior experts representing the main parties ([[Italian National Institute of Geology and Vulcanology|INGV]], [[Met Office]], [[Nansen Environmental and Remote Sensing Center|NERSC]], [[Danish Meteorological Institute|DMI]], [[Ifremer]], [[Collecte Localisation Satellites|CLS]] and Mercator Ocean)
- The Chairmen of the Advisory Bodies (Core User Group and Scientific Advisory Committee)
- Representatives of the European Stakeholders (EEA, EMSA, etc.)

The Board and the Governing Body are chaired by Pierre Bahurel.

=== TAC (Thematic Assembly Centres) Production Centres ===
Their role is to collect the measurements or observations, whether satellite or in situ, and to calibrate, validate, edit, archive and distribute them. There are 5 TACs (WP Leader shown in brackets):
* Sea Level TAC (CLS)
* Ocean Color TAC (CNR)
* Sea Surface Temperature TAC (Met Office)
* Sea Ice and Wind TAC ([[Norwegian Meteorological Institute|MET Norway]])
* In Situ TAC ([[Ifremer]]), see [[CORA dataset]] global temperature and salinity product
TAC involved into MyOcean project are organized into 7 regions, each region is linked to the corresponding area defined into [[SeaDataNet]] project in order to improve efforts on data management and exchange of datasets.

=== MFC (Monitoring &amp; Forecasting Centres) Production Centres ===
They correspond to the 6 European 'basins', plus the Global Ocean. By assimilating observation data in 3D Models, they are to predict the state of the ocean (or to say what the state of the ocean was between two observations). There are 7 of them:
* Global MFC (Mercator Ocean)
* Arctic MFC (NERSC)
* Baltic MFC (DMI)
* North West Shelves MFC (UK Met Office)
* Iberian, Biscay, Ireland MFC (Mercator Ocean)
* Mediterranean MFC (INGV)
* Black Sea MFC (Marine Hydrophysical Institute of the Ukrainian National academy of Sciences)

=== End of the project series and transition to the Copernicus Programme ===
After the MyOcean project (2009–2012), the second Milestone "MyOcean2" (2012–2014) came to an end on September 30 and let the floor to MyOcean follow-On, from October 1, 2014, until March 31, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://marine.copernicus.eu/web/17-focus-on.php?item=2073&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 November 2014, the European Commission signed an agreement with the French privately owned non-profit company [[Mercator Ocean]], that entrusts the latter with the setting-up of the future [[Copernicus Programme|Copernicus]] Marine Service as of April 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mercator-ocean.fr/eng/mercator_ocean/programmes-copernicus&lt;/ref&gt; The services provided of the former MyOcean site "myocean.eu" are now hosted by [http://marine.copernicus.eu/ marine.copernicus.eu].

"Narrative Analysis" (Newbury Park: Sage Publications).&lt;/ref&gt; Narrative inquiry uses field texts, such as stories, autobiography, journals, field notes, letters, conversations, [[interview]]s, family stories, photos (and other artifacts), and life experience, as the units of analysis to research and understand the way people create meaning in their lives as [[narratives]].&lt;ref&gt;D. Jean Clandinin and F. Michael Connelly, Narrative Inquiry: Experience and Story in Qualitative Research (San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Publishers, 2000), 98–115.&lt;/ref&gt;

Narrative inquiry has been employed as a tool for analysis in the fields of [[cognitive science]], [[organizational studies]], [[knowledge]] theory, [[sociology]], [[occupational science]] and [[education]] studies, among others. Other approaches include the development of [[quantitative methods]] and tools based on the large volume capture of fragmented anecdotal material, and that which is self signified or indexed at the point of capture.&lt;ref&gt;Snowden D (2010) Naturalizing Sensemaking' in Mosier and Fischer (eds) Informed by Knowledge: Expert Performance pp 223-234&lt;/ref&gt; Narrative Inquiry challenges the philosophy behind quantitative/grounded data-gathering and questions the idea of “objective” data, however, it has been criticized for not being “theoretical enough."&lt;ref&gt;David M. Boje,'' Narrative Methods for Organizational and Communication Research'' (Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage, 2001), 83, 98.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clandinin and Connelly, 42. See also Laurel Richardson, “Narrative and Sociology,” in ''Representation in Ethnography'', edited by John Van Maanen (Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

Narrative inquiry is a form of [[qualitative research]], that emerged in the field of [[management science]] and later also developed in the field of [[knowledge management]], which shares the sphere of [[Information Management]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Harlan Cleveland]], ''The Knowledge Executive: Leadership in an Information Society'' (New York: E. P. Dutton, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus Narrative Inquiry focuses on the organization of human knowledge more than merely the collection and processing of [[data]]. It also implies that knowledge itself is considered valuable and noteworthy even when known by only one person.

[[Knowledge management]] was coined as a discipline in the early 1980s as a method of identifying, representing, sharing, and communicating [[knowledge]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Nico Stehr]] and Richard V. Ericson, eds., ''The Culture and Power of Knowledge: Inquiries into Contemporary Societies'' (New York: Walter de Gruyter, 1992); and, [[Fritz Machlup]], ''Knowledge and Knowledge Production'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Knowledge management]] and Narrative Inquiry share the idea of [[Knowledge transfer]], a theory which seeks to transfer unquantifiable elements of knowledge, including [[experience]].  Knowledge, if not communicated, becomes arguably useless, literally unused.

Philosopher [[Andy Clark]] speculates that the ways in which minds deal with [[narrative]] (second-hand information) and [[memory]] (first-hand perception) are cognitively indistinguishable.  Narrative, then, becomes an effective and powerful method of transferring knowledge.

== Narrative ways of knowing ==

[[Narrative]] is a powerful tool in the transfer, or sharing, of knowledge, one that is bound to cognitive issues of [[memory]], constructed memory, and perceived memory. [[Jerome Bruner]] discusses this issue in his 1990 book, ''Acts of Meaning'', where he considers the narrative form as a non-neutral [[rhetorical]] account that aims at “illocutionary intentions,” or the desire to [[communicate]] [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerome S. Bruner]], Acts of Meaning (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1990), 85.&lt;/ref&gt;  This technique might be called “[[narrative]]” or defined as a particular branch of [[storytelling]] within the narrative method.  Bruner’s approach places the narrative in time, to “assume an experience of time” rather than just making reference to historical time.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Polkinghorne, ''Narrative Knowing and the Human Sciences'' (Albany: SUNY Press, 1988), 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

This narrative approach captures the emotion of the moment described, rendering the event active rather than passive, infused with the latent meaning being communicated by the teller.  Two concepts are thus tied to narrative storytelling: memory and notions of time, both as time as found in the past and time as re-lived in the present.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Jacques Le Goff]], ''History and Memory'' (New York: Columbia University Press, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

A narrative method accepts the idea that knowledge can be held in stories that can be relayed, stored, and retrieved.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald E. Fry, ''Appreciative Inquiry and Organizational Transformation: Reports from the Field'' (Westport: CN: Quorum Books, 2002), 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==
1. '''Develop''' a [[research question]]
*A qualitative study seeks to learn why or how, so the writer’s research must be directed at determining the why and how of the research topic. Therefore, when crafting a research question for a qualitative study, the writer will need to ask a why or how question about the topic.&lt;ref&gt;[[Research question]]&lt;/ref&gt; 
2. '''Select''' or produce raw data 
*The raw data tend to be [[interview]] transcriptions, but can also be the result of field notes compiled during [[participant observation]] or from other forms of data collection that can be used to produce a narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Coffey, Amanda &amp; Paul Atkinson (1996). "Making Sense of Qualitative Data." Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

3. '''Organize''' data
*According to psychology professor Donald Polkinghorne, the goal of organizing data is to refine the research question and separate irrelevant or redundant information from that which will be eventually analyzed, sometimes referred to as "narrative smoothing."&lt;ref&gt;Polkinghorne, Donald E. (1995). Narrative configuration in qualitative analysis. Qualitative studies in education, Vol. 8, issue 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Some approaches to organizing data are as follows: 
:(When choosing a method of organization, one should choose the approach best suited to the research question and the goal of the project. For instance, Gee's method of organization would be best if studying the role language plays in narrative construction whereas Labov's method would more ideal for examining a certain event and its effect on an individual's experiences.)&lt;ref&gt;Riessman, C.K. (1993). "Narrative Analysis". Newbury Park: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith C.P. (2000). Content analysis and narrative analysis. In: Reis HT, Judd CM, eds. ''Handbook of research methods in social and personality psychology''. New York, NY: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

:*[[Labov]]'s: Thematic organization&lt;ref&gt;William Labov (1972). Some principles of linguistic methodology. Language in Society, 1, pp 97-120 doi:10.1017/S0047404500006576&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Synchronic Organization''. 
::This method is considered useful for understanding major events in the narrative and the effect those events have on the individual constructing the narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Smith C.P. (2000). Content analysis and narrative analysis. In: Reis HT, Judd CM, eds. Handbook of research methods in social and personality psychology. New York, NY: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The approach utilizes an "evaluation model" that organizes the data into an abstract (What was this about?), an orientation (Who? What? When? Where?), a complication (Then what happened?), an evaluation (So what?), a result (What finally happened?), and a coda (the finished narrative).&lt;ref&gt;Coffey, A. &amp; Atkinson, P. (1996) Making sense of qualitative data. Thousand Oaks: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; Said narrative elements may not occur in a constant order; multiple or reoccurring elements may exist within a single narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Coffey, A. &amp; Atkinson, P. (1996) Making sense of qualitative data. Thousand Oaks: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

:*Polkinghorne's: Chronological Organization or ''Diachronic Organization''
::also related to the sociology of stories approach that focuses on the contexts in which narratives are constructed. This approach attends to the "embodied nature" of the person telling the narrative, the context from which the narrative is created, the relationships between the narrative teller and others within the narrative, historical continuity, and the chronological organization of events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Polkinghorne|first=Donald|title=Narrative Configuration in Qualitative Analysis|journal=Qualitative Studies in Education|year=1995|volume=8|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A story with a clear beginning, middle, and end is constructed from the narrative data. Polkinghorne makes the distinction between narrative analysis and analysis of narratives.&lt;ref&gt;Polkinghorne, Donald E. (1995). Narrative Configuration in Qualitative Analysis. Qualitative Studies in Education, Vol. 8, Issue 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Narrative analysis utilizes "narrative reasoning" by shaping data in a narrative form and doing an in-depth analysis of each narrative on its own, whereas analysis of narratives utilizes [[paradigmatic]] reasoning and analyzes themes across data that take the form of narratives.&lt;ref&gt;Polkinghorne, Donald E. (1995). Narrative Configuration in Qualitative Analysis. Qualitative Studies in Education, Vol. 8, Issue 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

:*[[Jerome Bruner|Bruner]]'s functional approach focuses on what roles narratives serve for different individuals. In this approach, narratives are viewed as the way in which individuals construct and make sense of reality as well as the ways in which meanings are created and shared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bruner|first=Jerome|title=The Narrative Construction of Reality|journal=Critical Inquiry|year=1991|volume=18|issue=1|pages=1–21|doi=10.1086/448619}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is considered a functional approach to narrative analysis because the emphasis of the analysis is focused on the work that the narrative serves in helping individuals make sense of their lives, particularly through shaping random and chaotic events into a coherent narrative that makes the events easier to handle by giving them meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bruner|first=Jerome|title=The Narrative Construction of Reality|journal=Critical Inquiry|year=1991|volume=18|issue=1|pages=1–21|doi=10.1086/448619}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of this form of analysis is on the interpretations of events related in the narratives by the individual telling the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bruner|first=Jerome|title=The Narrative Construction of Reality|journal=Critical Inquiry|year=1991|volume=18|issue=1|pages=1–21|doi=10.1086/448619}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:*[[James Paul Gee|Gee]]'s approach of structural analysis focuses on the ways in which the narrative is conveyed by the speaker with particular emphasis given to the interaction between speaker and listener.&lt;ref&gt;Riessman, C.K. (1993). "Narrative Analysis." Newbury Park: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; In this form of analysis, the language that the speaker uses, the pauses in speech, discourse markers, and other similar structural aspects of speech are the focus. In this approach, the narrative is divided into [[stanzas]] and each stanza is analyzed by itself and also in the way in which it connects to the other pieces of the narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Daiute|first=Colette &amp; Cynthia Lightfoot|title=Narrative Analysis: Studying the Development of Individuals in Society|year=2003|publisher=Sage|location=Thousand Oaks, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:*[[Jaber F. Gubrium's]] form of narrative ethnography features the storytelling process as much as the story in analyzing narrativity.  Moving from text to field, he and his associate James A. Holstein present an analytic vocabulary and procedural strategies for collecting and analyzing narrative material in everyday contexts, such as families and care settings. In their view, the structure and meaning of texts cannot be understood separate from the everyday contexts of their production.  Their two books--"Analyzing Narrative Reality" and "Varieties of Narrative Analysis" provide dimensions of an institutionally-sensitive, constructionist approach to narrative production.

*There are a multitude of ways of organizing narrative data that fall under narrative analysis; different types of research questions lend themselves to different approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Riessman, C. K. (1993). "Narrative Analysis." Newbury Park: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of the approach, qualitative researchers organize their data into groups based on various common traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Polkinghorne|first=Donald|title=Narrative Configuration in Qualitative Analysis|journal=Qualitative Studies in Education|year=1995|volume=8|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

4. '''Interpret''' data
*Some paradigms/theories that can be used to interpret data: 
:{| class="wikitable"

*While interpreting qualitative data, researchers suggest looking for patterns, themes, and regularities as well as contrasts, paradoxes, and irregularities.&lt;ref&gt;Coffey, A. &amp; Atkinson, P. (1996) Making sense of qualitative data. Thousand Oaks: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; 
:(The research question may have to change at this stage if the data does not offer insight to the inquiry.)
 
*The interpretation is seen in some approaches as co-created by not only the interviewer but also with help from the interviewee, as the researcher uses the interpretation given by the interviewee while also constructing their own meaning from the narrative. 
:With these approaches, the researcher should draw upon their own knowledge and the research to label the narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Riessman, C.K. (1993). "Narrative Analysis." Newbury Park: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

* According to some qualitative researchers, the goal of data interpretation is to facilitate the interviewee's experience of the story through a narrative form.&lt;ref&gt;Polkinghorne, Donald E. (1995). Narrative Configuration in Qualitative Analysis. Qualitative Studies in Education, Vol. 8, Issue 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Narrative configuration in qualitative analysis. Qualitative studies in education, Vol. 8, issue 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretive research ==
The idea of imagination is where narrative inquiry and [[storytelling]] converge within narrative methodologies. Within narrative inquiry, storytelling seeks to better understand the “why” behind human action.&lt;ref&gt;Nona Lyons and Vicki Kubler LaBoskey, ''Narrative Inquiry in Practice: Advancing the Knowledge of Teaching'' (New York: Teachers College Press, 2002), 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Story collecting as a form of narrative inquiry allows the research participants to put the [[data]] into their own words and reveal the latent “why” behind their assertions.

“[[Interpretive research]]” is a form of field research methodology that also searches for the subjective "why."&lt;ref&gt;H. Klein and M. D. Myers, “A Set of Principles for Conducting and Evaluating Interpretive Field Studies” ''MIS Quarterly'' 23, no. 1 (1999): 67–93.&lt;/ref&gt; Interpretive research, using methods such as those termed “storytelling” or “narrative inquiry,” does not attempt to predefine [[independent variables]] and [[dependent variables]], but acknowledges context and seeks to “understand phenomena through the meanings that people assign to them.”&lt;ref&gt;Heinz K. Klein and Michael D. Myers, “A Set of Principles for Conducting and Evaluating Interpretive Field Studies in Information Systems,” ''MIS Quarterly'' 23, no. 1 (March 1999): 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two influential proponents of a narrative research model are [[Mark Johnson (professor)|Mark Johnson]] and [[Alasdair MacIntyre]]. In his work on experiential, embodied metaphors, Johnson encourages the researcher to challenge “how you see knowledge as embodied, embedded in a culture based on narrative unity,” the “construct of continuity in individual lives.”&lt;ref&gt;Clandinin and Connelly, ''Narrative Inquiry'', 3. See also George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, ''Metaphors We Live By'' (Chicago: University of Chicago, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt;

The seven “functions of narrative work” as outlined by Riessman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Riessman|first1=Catherine|title=Narrative Methods for the Human Sciences|date=2008|publisher=Sage}}&lt;/ref&gt;
1. Narrative constitutes past experiences as it provides ways for individuals to make sense of the past. 
2. Narrators argue with stories.
3. Persuading. Using rhetorical skill to position a statement to make it persuasive/to tell it how it “really” happened. To give it authenticity or ‘truth’.
4. Engagement, keeping the audience in the dynamic relationship with the narrator. 
5. Entertainment.
6. Stories can function to mislead an audience.
7. Stories can mobilize others into action for progressive change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Riessman|first1=Catherine|title=Narrative Methods for the Human Sciences|date=2008|publisher=Sage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practices ==
Narrative analysis therefore can be used to acquire a deeper understanding of the ways in which a few individuals organize and derive meaning from events&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Polkinghorne|first=Donald|title=Narrative Configuration in Qualitative Analysis|journal=Qualitative Studies in Education|year=1995|volume=8|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
. It can be particularly useful for studying the impact of social structures on an individual and how that relates to identity, intimate relationships, and family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frost|first=David M.|title=Stigma and Intimacy in Same Sex Relationships: A Narrative Approach|journal=Journal of Family Psychology|year=2011|volume=25|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example:

*[[Feminist]] scholars have found narrative analysis useful for data collection of perspectives that have been traditionally [[marginalized]]. The method is also appropriate to [[cross-cultural]] research.  As Michael Brecher and Frank P. Harvey advocate, when asking unusual questions it is logical to ask them in an unusual manner.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Brecher and Frank P. Harvey (2002). ''Millennial Reflections on International Studies'' (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press), 326.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Developmental Psychology]] utilizes narrative inquiry to depict a child's experiences in areas such as self-regulation, problem-solving and development of self.&lt;ref&gt;Smith C.P. (2000). Content analysis and narrative analysis. In: Reis HT, Judd CM, eds. Handbook of research methods in social and personality psychology. New York, NY: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Personality uses the narrative approach in order to illustrate an individual's identity over a lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;McAdams, D.P. &amp; Zeldow, P.B. (1993). Construct validity and content analysis. Journal of Personality Assessment, 61. 243-245.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Social movements have used narrative analysis in their persuasive techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Donald E. Polkinghorne (1995). Narrative configuration in qualitative analysis. Qualitative Studies in Education, Vol. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Political practices. Stories are connected to the flow of power in the wider world. Some narratives serve different purposes for individuals and others, for groups. Some narratives overlap both individual experiences and social.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leave|first1=Patricia|title=Method Meets Art: Arts Based Research Practice|date=2009|publisher=Guliford Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Promulgation of a culture: Narratives and storytelling are used to remember past events, reveal morals, entertain, relate to one another, and engage a community. Narrative inquiry helps to create an identity and demonstrate/carry on cultural values/traditions. Stories connect humans to each other and to their culture. These cultural definitions aid to make social knowledge accessible to people who are unfamiliar with the culture/situation. An example of this is how children in a given society learn from their parents and the culture around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leave|first1=Patricia|title=Method Meets Art: Arts Based Research Practice|date=2009|publisher=Guliford Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''NeuroLex''' is a dynamic [[lexicon]] of [[neuroscience]] concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Initial content for this article was adapted from the NeuroLex project which is licensed under a [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/ Creative Commons Attribution License].&lt;/ref&gt; It is a structured as a [[semantic wiki]], using [[Semantic MediaWiki]]. NeuroLex is supported by the [[Neuroscience Information Framework]] project.

== Overview ==
The NeuroLex is intended to help improve the way that neuroscientists communicate about their data, so that information systems like the NIF can find data more easily and provide more powerful means of integrating data that occur across distributed resources.  One of the big roadblocks to data integration in neuroscience is the inconsistent use of [[terminology]] in databases and other resources like the [[literature]]. When one uses the same terms to mean different things, one cannot easily ask questions that span across multiple resources.  For example, if three databases have information about what [[gene]]s are expressed in [[Cortex (anatomy)|cortex]], but they all use different definitions of [[cerebral cortex]], then one cannot compare them easily.

== Utilization within the Neuroscience Information Framework ==
The NIF enables discovery and access to public research data and tools worldwide through an open source, networked environment. Funded by the [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]] Blueprint for Neuroscience Research,&lt;ref&gt;The [http://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research] is a cooperative effort among the 16 NIH Institutes, Centers and Offices that support neuroscience research. By pooling resources and expertise, the Blueprint supports the development of new tools, training opportunities, and other resources to assist neuroscientists in both basic and clinical research. [http://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/blueprint_basics/about_blueprint.htm Read more about the Blueprint].&lt;/ref&gt; the NIF enables scientists and students to discover global neuroscience web resources that cut across traditional boundaries – from experimental, clinical and translational neuroscience databases, to knowledge bases, atlases, and genetic/genomic resources.

Unlike general search engines, NIF provides deeper access to a more focused set of resources that are relevant to neuroscience, search strategies tailored to neuroscience, and access to content that is traditionally “hidden” from [[web search engine]]s.  The Framework is a dynamic inventory of neuroscience databases, annotated and integrated with a unified system of [[Ontology|biomedical terminology]] (i.e. NeuroLex). NIF supports concept-based queries across multiple scales of biological structure and multiple levels of biological function, making it easier to search for and understand the results.

As part of the NIF, a search interface to many different sources of neuroscience information and data is provided.  To make this search more effective, the NIF is constructing ontologies to help organize neuroscience concepts into category hierarchies, e.g. stating that a [[neuron]] is a [[Cell (biology)|cell]]. This allows users to perform more effective searches and also to organize and understand the information that is returned.  But an important adjunct to this activity is to clearly define all of the terms that are used to describe data, e.g., anatomical terms, techniques, [[organism]] names.

== Content ==
The initial entries in the NeuroLex were built from the NIFSTD ontologies which subsumed an earlier vocabulary BIRNLex.  It currently contains concepts that span gross anatomy, cells of the [[nervous system]], subcellular structures, [[disease]]s, functions and techniques. NIF is soliciting community input to add more content and correct what is there.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2752">A '''pilot study''', '''pilot project''', '''pilot test''', or '''pilot experiment''' is a small scale preliminary study conducted in order to evaluate feasibility, time, cost, adverse events, and improve upon the study design prior to performance of a full-scale research project.&lt;ref&gt;Hulley, Stephen B. ''Designing Clinical Research''. Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, 2007, p.168-169.&lt;/ref&gt; Pilot studies, therefore, may not be appropriate for [[case studies]].

==Implementation==
Pilot experiments are frequently carried out before large-scale [[quantitative research]], in an attempt to avoid time and money being wasted on an inadequately designed project.  A pilot study is usually carried out on members of the relevant population, but not on those who will form part of the final sample.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

A pilot study is often used to test the design of the full-scale experiment which then can be adjusted. It is a potentially valuable insight and, should anything be missing in the pilot study, it can be added to the full-scale (and more expensive) experiment to improve the chances of a clear outcome.

==Other applications==
In [[sociology]], pilot studies can be referred to as small-scale studies that will help identify design issues before the main research is done.

Although pilot experiments have a well-established tradition in public action, their usefulness as a strategy for change has been questioned, at least in the domain of environmental management.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sapiens.revues.org/index979.html Billé, R. (2010) “Action without change? On the use and usefulness of pilot experiments in environmental management.”. ''S.A.P.I.EN.S.'' '''3''' (1) ]&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that extrapolation from a pilot study to large scale environmental strategy cannot be assumed to be possible, partly due to the exceptional resources and favourable conditions that often accompany a pilot study.

'''Quoats''' is a LINK research project funded by government, levy boards and industry groups that aims to develop and apply state-of-the-art [[genomic]] and [[metabolomic]] tools for the genetic improvement of [[oats]]. Its name is a [[portmanteau]] of the words ''quality'' and ''oats''. Its focus is on the understanding and [[gene manipulation|manipulation]] of key [[Phenotypic trait|traits]] that will enhance the value of oats in [[human health]] improvement, to capitalise on the value of oats as a low input [[cereal crop]], increase the [[environmental sustainability|environmental]] and [[Sustainable business|economic sustainability]] of cereal based [[crop rotation|rotations]], realise the potential of oats as a high value [[fodder|animal feed]] and develop new opportunities for using oats for industrial use through advanced [[fractionation]]. The project objective is to deliver powerful enabling genetic technologies for the identification of specific [[genes]] and markers that will drive the development of breeder–friendly tools accelerating the production of improved oat varieties that will be evaluated and marketed by industrial partners. Quoats is a multi-disciplinary research programme which combines modern [[phenotyping]] methodologies with the expertise of genomics researchers, oat breeders and end-users. It also addresses long term breeding goals by developing experimental oat populations which are [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]] for agronomically important traits but more amenable to [[Gene mapping|mapping]] and forward [[Genetics|genetic]] approaches than conventional agronomic lines.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1002">'''Range fractionation''' is a term used in biology used to denote varying firing thresholds for different stimuli intensities. Sense organs are usually composed of many [[sensory receptor]]s measuring the same property. These sensory receptors show a limited degree of precision due to an upper limit in [[action potential|firing rate]]. If the [[sensory receptors|receptors]] are endowed with distinct [[transfer function]]s in such a way that the points of highest sensitivity are scattered along the axis of the quality being measured, the precision of the sense organ as a whole can be increased. This was shown for the [[chordotonal organ]] in the [[locust]] leg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=J.|last1=Campbell|display-authors=etal|title="Structure and physiology of a chordotonal organ in the locust leg"|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|volume=48|pages=305-323|date=1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Rocket Science''''' is a [[BBC]] television documentary series, first broadcast in March 2009 on [[BBC Two]], exploring new ways to teach science to children. Across the UK, fewer and fewer youngsters want to study chemistry and physics, so with the help of physics teacher Andy Smith, Rocket Science sets out to convert a small sample by teaching them everything safe there is to know about fireworks. The series was filmed over a period of nine months.

Andy Smith won the secondary school teacher of the year for the north west region in 2005. He has also filmed shows for the digital channel Teacher's TV. He is a big Doctor Who fan and has assisted in many conventions in which previous stars of the series attend, notably the Who in the Cavern, which raises money for the Liverpool children's hospital Alder Hey. He once famously presided over a quiz between fifth doctor Peter Davison and sixth doctor Colin Baker.

'''''Rough Science''''' is a British [[documentary]] [[reality television series]] made by the [[BBC]] in collaboration with the [[Open University]]. Six series were made between 2000 and 2005. It was broadcast in prime time on [[BBC Two]] and is considered something of a "break-out hit" for the Open University.&lt;ref name=teuviet&gt;{{cite web|title=Rough Science (2016)|url=http://www.teuviet.com/movie/series/504174-Rough-Science/seasons/2|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rough Science'' was first shown in 2000.

The series' formula consists of a group of four or five [[scientist]]s with specialities in different fields who are given a task that they must complete using the [[natural resources]] of the surrounding area together with a small set of supplies. Each programme features a different task and follows the scientists as they use their knowledge and ingenuity in attempting to fulfil it and, in the process, educate the viewing public — despite failure being common.

Each episode either requires the team to work together in smaller groups to create requirements for the overall challenge, for the small groups to fulfil vaguely related challenges or even to complete the same task in competition. It has been set in a different scenic location each series, typically somewhere with plenty of plants for use by the group. The presenter is [[Kate Humble]] and groups of scientists — most of the scientists appear in several series.

==Series 1==
This series is set on the [[Mediterranean]] island of [[Capraia]] and features four episodes, and various tasks:

# "Mediterranean Mystery" – The group is taken to a disused prison on the island where they have to determine the [[longitude]] and [[latitude]] of the island, create a [[radio]] from a [[saucepan]] and create an [[insect repellent]].
# "Simmering Shutterbugs" – Create a camera with film, create a compass and dye a flag.
# "Power Supplies" –  Generate power and build a pharmacy (creating [[antiseptic]] using [[olive]]s and [[Myrtus|myrtle]], and [[antiflatulent]] with [[fennel]] seeds).
# "Sustenance and Sayonara" – Create [[soap]] and [[toothpaste]] (though the general task is to put food on the table).

The scientists featured are:

* Vanessa Griffiths, [[marine biology|marine biologist]] and teacher of [[ecology]]
* Anna Lewington, [[ethnobotany|ethnobotanist]] and author&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://www.anna-lewington.co.uk/about.html|website=Anna Lewington|accessdate=14 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Jonathan Hare]], [[chemistry|chemist]], [[physics|physicist]], inventor, and teacher
* [[Mike Leahy]], [[virology|virologist]]
* [[Mike Bullivant]], organic [[photochemistry|photochemist]]

==Series 2==
This series takes place on the [[Caribbean]] island of [[Carriacou]] and features five scientists, including three (Mike Leahy, Mike Bullivant, and Jonathan Hare) from the first series. It has six episodes and many challenges:

# "Mapping it Out" – Make a [[map]] of the island, [[paper]] and [[ink]] for the map, and a [[sound recorder|device to record sounds]].
# "Bugs and Barometers" – Make an [[antiseptic]] lotion, a [[microscope]], and a [[weather station]].
# "Time and Transmitters" – Make a [[radio]], [[clock]], and [[kite]].
# "Feel the Heat" – Make a [[freezer]], [[thermometer]], and [[sunscreen]].
# "Sun and Sea" – Make a [[lamp (electrical component)|lamp]] that could function underwater, and to generate [[electrical energy]] to charge up a [[battery (electricity)|battery]].
# "The Science of Celebration" – Make [[musical instrument]]s and [[fireworks]] for a party.

New scientists featured in this series were:
* [[Kathy Sykes]], [[science communicator]] and physicist
* Ellen McCallie, [[ecology|ecologist]] and teacher

Anna Lewington and Vanessa Griffiths from the first series were not featured in this series.

==Series 3==
This series takes place on the West Coast of the South Island of [[New Zealand]], has six episodes, and features the same scientists as the previous series.

# "Gold Rush" – Collect [[gold]] from a river, build a [[metal detector]], and construct a super-accurate [[Weighing scale|balance]].
# "Shakers" – Build an automatic [[gold panning]] machine, create [[cosmetics]], and look for evidence of [[earthquake]]s in trees.
# "Quakers" – Build a [[waterproof]] [[tent]] and a [[seismograph]].
# "Ice" – Measure the speed and melting rate of a [[glacier]] and keep warm without a [[fire]].
# "Treasure Hunt" – Build a device for measuring [[altitude]] to assist in finding gold, and extract gold from [[rock (geology)|rock]].
# "The Big Smelt" – [[smelting|Smelt]] the gold and [[craft]] a [[souvenir]] from it.

==Series 4==
This series takes place at [[Darwin, California|Darwin]] Mine,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = McCallie | first = Ellen | title = Ellen's Rover Diary | url = https://www.pbs.org/weta/roughscience/series4/scientists/ellen/rover.html | accessdate = 27 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; adjacent to [[Death Valley National Park]] in California and has six episodes, all involving [[space exploration]]. Four scientists from the previous series (Ellen McCallie, Jonathan Hare, Mike Bullivant, and Kathy Sykes) are featured plus a new scientist, [[Iain Stewart (geologist)|Iain Stewart]], the show's first [[geology|geologist]]. Mike Leahy from the previous series is not featured in this series.

# "'Rover": Build a [[Wiktionary:rover|rover]] and [[water purification|purify water]].
# "Communication": Send a communication in a way that didn't rely purely on [[sound]] (by altering the vibrations of reflected [[sunlight]], which is then detected by a transistor functioning as a light detector), and make a [[pen]] that works in [[zero gravity]].
# "Spacesuit": Design a [[Liquid Cooling and Ventilation Garment|cooling system for a spacesuit]].
# "Impact": Measure the size of the meteor that created [[Barringer Meteor Crater]]. Iain and Kathy travel to Arizona to see the crater. Mike stays behind, and experiments with impact. Jonathan and Ellen make a [[telescope]] using an eyepiece and mirror they find in the chest given to them at the start of the episode (their task was to actually measure the size of a crater on the [[moon]]).
# "Aerial Surveyor": Build a device with a [[camera]] that could survey a large area from the air. Find the center of one of the largest earthquakes to hit America that took place back in 1872 in California, and estimate what it measured on the [[Richter scale]]. Mike creates a system that filters carbon dioxide, just as the [[astronaut]]s of [[Apollo 13]] were forced to do when an explosion ruptured an oxygen tank.
# "Rocket": Design [[rocket]]s that can launch an [[Egg (biology)|egg]] into the air and return it safely to earth. Three different rockets are attempted by three of the scientists, while the remaining two work on a [[parachute]] system.

==Series 5==
This series takes place on the coast of [[Zanzibar]] and has a strong ecological theme running through the challenges. The line-up of scientists is Ellen McCallie, Jonathan Hare, Mike Bullivant, and Kathy Sykes. The episode challenges for this series are:

# "Shipwrecked" – Design and build a [[submersible]] exploration vehicle to explore a [[shipwreck]], determine when [[low tide]] occurs for the best chance at getting to the wreck, and how to [[Water purifier|purify]] the scientists' water supply.
# "Lost at Sea" – Build a [[Flare|distress flare]], make an [[Floatation device|emergency flotation device]], and create a [[electric light|warning light]] activated by seawater.
# "Call of the Wild" – Const an underwater [[hydrophone]], an underwater viewing device, and create [[mosquito repellent]].
# "To the Lighthouse" – Build a [[lighthouse]] by creating a light source visible from great distances while at sea, as well as create the lighthouse infrastructure and make the light flash.
# "The Reef" – Create a system to protect a [[coral reef]] by alerting approaching boats that they're entering a protected area.
# "Beneath the Waves" – Build a [[Scuba set|SCUBA device]] that can safely be used to a depth of 5 meters and still provide freedom for exploration.

==Series 6==
This series, shown in 2005, takes place in the [[San Juan Mountains]] in [[Colorado]]. For this series, [[geomorphology|geomorphologist]] [[Hermione Cockburn]] replaced Kathy Sykes.

# "Power" – Supply [[electricity]] and [[natural gas]] to their basecamp, located in an old mill.
# "Safety" – Build a [[fire extinguisher]] (using [[carbon dioxide]]) and a [[Industrial wastewater treatment|water treatment plant]].
# "Mountain" – Calculate the height and weight of a mountain and make [[sunglasses]] to protect the eyes at high altitudes.
# "Clean" – Build a [[washing machine]] with washing [[soap]], and create [[antiperspirant]] and [[deodorant]].
# "Mine" – Detect [[radioactive]] rocks and [[flammable]] gases, and create a [[Electrical generator|generator]] to power an [[electric lamp]].
# "Photo" – Take and develop a [[photograph]], and deliver it by [[Gas balloon|hydrogen balloon]].

'''Science and technology''' is a topic that encompasses [[science]], [[technology]], and the interactions between the two. '''[[Science]]''' is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of  explanations and predictions about nature and the universe. '''[[Technology]]''' is the collection of techniques, methods or processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation, or any other consumer demands.

Science may drive technological development, by generating demand for new instruments to address a scientific question, or by illustrating technical possibilities previously unconsidered. In turn, technology may drive scientific investigation, by creating demand for technological improvements that can only be produced through research, and by raising questions about the underlying principles that a new technology relies on.

For the majority of human history, technological improvements were achieved by chance, trial and error, or spontaneous inspiration. When the modern scientific enterprise matured in the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], it primarily concerned itself with basic questions of nature. [[Research and development]] directed towards immediate technical application is a relatively recent occurrence, arising with the [[Industrial Revolution]] and becoming commonplace in the 20th century.

==Overlapping topics==
As academic fields, science and technology are often grouped with [[engineering]] and [[mathematics]], as the [[STEM fields]].

The [[history of science and technology]] examines how humanity's understanding of science and technology has changed over the centuries.

[[science and technology studies|Science and technology are often studied]] together [[Technology and society|with society]], in terms of their mutual interactions.

[[File:2014 seed library USA 15210065125.jpg|thumb|right|Seed library shelving, USA]]
A '''seed [[library]]''' is an institution that lends or shares [[seed]]. It is distinguished from a [[seedbank]] in that the main purpose is not to store or hold [[germplasm]] or seeds against possible destruction, but to disseminate them to the public which preserves the shared plant varieties through propagation and further sharing of seed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/07/garden/07seed.html?_r=1 |last=Wang |first=Joy C. |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |title=A Seed Library for Heirloom Plants Thrives in the Hudson Valley }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
Seed libraries usually maintain their collections through donations from members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jun/18/home/la-hm-seed-library-20110618 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |last=MacVean |first=Mary |title=Seeds of hope and change |date=June 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but may also operate as pure charity operations intent on serving gardeners and farmers.&lt;ref name="Boing Boing"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://boingboing.net/2012/04/02/seed-libraries-crop-up.html |title=Seed Libraries Crop Up |work=[[BoingBoing]] |date=April 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A common attribute of many seed libraries is to preserve [[agricultural biodiversity]] by focusing on rare, local, and heirloom seed varieties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nurturing plant legacies: Two groups lend seeds and plants to gardeners |last=Hageman |first=William |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/classified/realestate/home/ct-sun-garden-0325-seed-lenders-20120323,0,589451.story |date=March 23, 2012 |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seed libraries use varied methods for sharing seeds, primarily by:
* [[seed swaps]] otherwise known as seed exchanges, in which library members or the public meet and exchange seeds
* seed "lending," in which people check out seed from the library's collection, grow them, save the seed, and return seed from the propagated plants to the library

Seed libraries may function as programs of public libraries, such as the programs of the Richmond Public Library in California (the "Richmond Grows" program is the "unofficial spiritual center of the [public library seed library] movement"&lt;ref name="bosglobe"&gt;Kevin Hartnett, [https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2014/03/09/seed-libraries-try-save-world-plants/XnM6HJ8GCfPoo6JWtU6DQL/story.html "'Seed Libraries' Try to Save the World's Plants"], ''[[Boston Globe]]'', March 9, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;) and the [[New Port Richey Public Library]] (Florida).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://suncoastnews.com/npr-launches-seed-exchange-community-gardens-20130823/ |newspaper=The Suncoast News |last=Orth |first=Carl |title=NPR launches seed exchange,community gardens |date=August 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Seed library initiatives in public libraries garner patron participation as a novelty supplement to book check-outs. Seed packets are usually located next to everyday circulated items like books, audiobooks, CDs, and DVDs. Seed libraries in public libraries have been successful because they catch patron hobby curiosities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2013/02/02/170846948/how-to-save-a-public-library-make-it-a-seed-bank|title=How To Save A Public Library: Make It A Seed Bank|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-03-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public libraries are an appropriate space for seed libraries because they make seeds and plants available to everyone.

They are also located in college libraries, such as [[Hampshire College]]'s seed library;&lt;ref name="bosglobe" /&gt; museums, such as the Hull-House Heirloom Seed Library, a program of the [[Hull House|Jane Addams Hull-House Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uic.edu/jaddams/hull/_programsevents/_kitchen/_seedlibrary/seedlibrary.html  |title=Hull House Seed Library |work=uic.edu }}&lt;/ref&gt; or as membership based online programs like the Hudson Valley Seed Library. Some have developed as programs of [[botanical garden]]s, such as that of the [[VanDusen Botanical Garden]], or from gardening associations and research institutes, such as the Heritage Seed Library of [[Garden Organic]]. Other seed libraries have evolved from community sustainability or resilience efforts, such as the [[Bay Area Seed Interchange Library]] (BASIL) (the United States' oldest seed library, which developed from the [[Berkeley, California]] Ecology Center); and still others from the [[Slow Food]] movement, such as [[Grow Gainesville]]'s seed program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://growgainesville.wordpress.com/seed-library/ | title=Seed Library _ Grow Gainesville | accessdate=January 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While "lending" is straightforward, "returning" or re-depositing seeds presents a challenge, since the new seeds are not necessarily well-described, and may be inadvertent [[hybrid (biology)|hybrids]].&lt;ref name="bosglobe" /&gt;

Seed libraries complement the preservationist activities of [[seedbank]]s, by collecting local and heirloom varieties that might otherwise be lost, and by collecting new local varieties. In theory, lending and returning seed libraries will also promote local agriculture over time, by growing collections of seeds locally adapted to the region.&lt;ref name="bosglobe" /&gt;

'''Setting circles''' are used on [[telescopes]] equipped with an [[equatorial mount]] to find astronomical objects in the sky by their [[Equatorial coordinate system|equatorial coordinates]] often used in [[star chart]]s or [[ephemeris|ephemerides]].

==Description==
Setting circles consist of two graduated disks attached to the axes – [[right ascension]] (RA) and [[declination]] (DEC) – of an [[equatorial mount]]. The RA disk is graduated into hours, minutes, and seconds. The DEC disk is graduated into degrees, [[minute and second of arc|arcminutes]], and arcseconds.

Since the RA coordinates are fixed onto the [[celestial sphere]], the RA disk is usually driven by a [[clock drive|clock mechanism]] in sync with [[sidereal time]]. Locating an object on the celestial sphere using setting circles is similar to finding a location on a terrestrial map using [[latitude]] and [[longitude]]. Sometimes the RA setting circle has two scales on it: one for the Northern Hemisphere and one for the Southern.

==Application==

===Research telescopes===
Historically setting circles have rivaled the telescopes optics as far as difficulty in construction. Making a set of setting circles required a lot of precision crafting on a [[dividing engine]]. Setting circles usually had a large diameter and when combined with a [[vernier scale]] could point a telescope to nearly an [[arc minute]] of accuracy. In the 20th century setting circles were replaced with electronic [[rotary encoder|encoders]] on most research telescopes.

===Portable telescopes===
In [[amateur astronomy]], setting up a portable telescope equipped with setting circles requires:

* [[Polar alignment]] -  The telescope must be aligned with either the north [[celestial pole]] or the south celestial pole.  [[Polaris]] is roughly at the north pole, while [[Sigma Octantis]] is roughly at the south pole.
* Setting Right Ascension - After polar alignment, the observer uses a calculator or a known star to synchronize the right ascension circle with Sidereal Time.

Accuracy of pointing the telescope can be hard to achieve.  Some sources of error are:

#Less-than-perfect polar alignment
#The optical tube not being perpendicular to the declination axis
#The declination and right ascension axis not being perpendicular
#Errors in rotating the setting circles when setting up
#Errors in reading the setting circles
#Confusion between Northern and Southern hour angles (Right Ascension)

It is common to blame an unlevel tripod as a source of error, however when a proper polar alignment is performed, any induced error is factored out.  

These sources of error add up and cause the telescope to point far from the desired object.  They are also hard to control; for example, Polaris is often used as the celestial north pole for alignment purposes, but it is over half a degree away from the true pole.  Also, even the finest graduations on setting circles are usually more than a degree apart, which makes them difficult to read accurately, especially in the dark.  Nothing can be done if the optical tube is not perpendicular to the declination axis or if the R.A. and Dec axes are not perpendicular, because these problems are next to impossible to fix.

In the southern hemisphere the [[Right Ascension]] scale operates in reverse from in the Northern Hemisphere.  The term Right Ascension took its name from early northern hemisphere observers for whom "ascending stars" were on the east or right hand side.  In the southern hemisphere the east is on the left when an [[equatorial mount]] is aligned on the south pole.  Many Right Ascension setting circles therefore carry two sets of numbers, one showing the value if the telescope is aligned in the northern hemisphere, the other for the southern.   

Even with some inaccuracies in polar alignment or the perpendicularity of the mount, setting circles can be used to roughly get to a desired object's coordinates, where a star chart can be used to apply the necessary correction.  Alternatively, it is possible to point to a bright star very close to the object, rotate the circles to match the star's coordinates, and ''then'' point to the desired object's coordinates. Setting circles are also used in a modified version of [[star hopping]] where the observer points the telescope at a known object and then moves it a set distance in RA or declination to the location of a desired object.

==Digital setting circles==
Digital setting circles (DSC) consist of two [[rotary encoder]]s on both axis of the telescope mount and a digital readout. They give a highly accurate readout of where the telescope is pointed and their lit display makes them easier to read in the dark. They have also been combined with [[microcomputer]]s to give the observer a large database of celestial objects and even guide the observer in correctly pointing their telescope.

In contrast to a [[GoTo (telescopes)|GOTO]] telescope mount, a mount equipped with DSC alone is sometimes called a "PUSH TO" mount.

{{Francoism sidebar}}
'''Sociological Francoism''' ({{lang-es|franquismo sociológico}}) is an expression used in [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/Spain Spain] which attests to the social characteristics typical of [[Francoist Spain|Francoism]] that survived in Spanish society after the death of [[Francisco Franco]] in 1975 and continue to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Justel|first1=Manuel|date=1992|title=Edad y Cultura Politica|url=http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/fichero_articulo?articulo=250098&amp;orden=80654|journal=Reis|volume=58|page=69|pages=|via=|[http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/fichero_articulo?articulo=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The root causes of sociological Francoism are found in the prolonged state of repression that existed during the forty years of the Franco dictatorship (1936-1975), and the fear of a repetition of the [[Spanish Civil War]] and a clashing of the so-called [[The two Spains|two Spains]]. A further reason for its durability is the positive role attributed to Francoism in the Spanish economic boom (the [[Spanish miracle]],1959-1975), while avoiding reference to the mass [[Spanish diaspora|Spanish emigration]] or the period of economic recession that prevailed during the ten years following the [[Spanish transition to democracy|Transition]] (1975-1985). All of this led the Spanish social majority, including even those identified with the anti-Francoist opposition, to perpetuate the conservative and survivalist behaviours that were learned and transmitted from generation to generation since the 1940s. These include self-censorship and the voluntary submission and conformity to authority&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cronicasbarbaras.blogs.com/crnicas_brbaras/2005/06/franquismo_soci.html|title=Franquismo sociológico|last=Molares do Val|first=Manuel|date=4 June 2005|website=Crónicas Bárbaras|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; – which in extreme cases could even be classified as servility (most commonly identified with the "[[silent majority]]") – which provided the regime with its cheapest, most effective and most ubiquitous form of repression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alasbarricadas.org/noticias/?q=node/6852|title=Interview with José Ribas|last=|first=|date=4 February 2008|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with [[Xavier Moret]], the writer [[Manuel Vázquez Montalbán]] described the phenomenon in the following way:&lt;blockquote&gt;There was a sociological Francoism which existed before and still exists to a greater or lesser extent today, coupled with Francoist rhetoric in which only the best years – those of 1962 or 1963 and the first part of the 1970s – are remembered, omitting the years of misery and the economic recession that existed prior to the Spanish Civil War and continued to grow under Francoism. The economically prosperous years have been mythologized within sociological Francoism; however, we should remind ourselves that this success was based on exporting the unemployed first to Catalonia and the Basque Country and then later to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vespito.net/mvm/autob2.html|title="El franquismo era feísimo; daba la impresión de que a todo el mundo le olían los calcetines"|last=Moret|first=Xavier|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In a similar vein, the philosopher [[José Luis López Aranguren]] has written that "Francoism, while originally a political system, transformed into a way of life for the Spanish people".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=La cultura política en la España de Franco|last=López Pina|first=Antonio|last2=Aranguren|first2=Eduardo|publisher=Taurus|year=1976|isbn=9788430630318|location=Madrid|pages=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sociological Francoism and political culture ==
In the exercise of political power, '''sociological Francoism''' is defined as "the political culture of identification with the [Francoist] regime".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://descargas.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/jlv/04705177577947206454480/003133_4.pdf|title=La cultura política en la crisis del franquismo|last=Reig Cruañes|first=José|publisher=Doctoral Thesis in the Facultad de Filosofía y Letras in the Universidad de Alicante|year=1999|isbn=|location=Alicante|pages=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the journalist [[Antonio Maestre]] adds a definition that goes beyond the political sphere, describing sociological Francoism as:&lt;blockquote&gt;The collection of citizens and politicians that, having lived well under Francoism and supported its ideas, were in favour of opening up the regime to a certain degree to ensure that the Transition would proceed in a tolerable direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lamarea.com/2013/10/06/la-mayoria-silenciosa-el-pp-y-el-franquismo-sociologico/|title=La mayoría silenciosa, el Partido Popular y el franquismo sociológico {{!}} lamarea.com|last=Maestre|first=Antonio|date=6 October 2013|work=lamarea.com|access-date=17 November 2017|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The popularity of Franco during his dictatorship was not measured in opinion polls, but in the [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] of the army and the charismatic legitimacy of his person ([[Caudillo|caudillismo]]), as well as the widespread social binding that took place through the [[Movimiento Nacional|Movimiento nacional]] (all of which are typical elements of [[fascism]]). Together, these ensured massive public demonstrations of support and the practically unanimous results in sporadically held national referenda (such as the [[Spanish organic law referendum, 1966 (Spanish Sahara)|Spanish organic law referendum of 1966]]). In 1969, in one of his last televised Christmas addresses, Franco spoke of Spain's future, saying that all was ''atado y bien atado''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.el-nacional.com/noticias/columnista/todo-esta-atado-bien-atado_79771|title=¿Todo está atado y bien atado?|last=Barrios|first=Froilán|date=8 February 2017|work=El Nacional|access-date=17 November 2017|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; (literally "tied and well tied", referring to the institutionalization of his regime), which became a popular saying in Spain. Any clues to his personal health were carefully scrutinized, as were his cryptically-expressed intentions, such as the phrase ''no hay mal que por bien no venga'' (roughly equivalent to "every cloud has a silver lining"), which he used in reference to the [[Assassination of Luis Carrero Blanco|assassination]] of [[Luis Carrero Blanco]] in 1973 by the Basque separatist group [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.es/hemeroteca/historico-20-01-2007/abc/Galicia/no-hay-mal-que-por-bien-no-venga_1631014785383.html|title=¿No hay mal que por bien no venga? {{!}} Galicia {{!}} Galicia - Abc.es|last=Barrón|first=Gaspar|date=|website=ABC|access-date=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and whose meaning was the subject of endless speculation. In a secret 1971 interview with [[Vernon A. Walters|Vernon Walters]], envoy of [[Richard Nixon]], Franco expressed his opinion that upon his death, Spanish society would carry out a political evolution that would not break with his legacy, as the now larger and more well-off Spanish middle class would avoid risking another civil war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.es/abcfoto/revelado/20141009/abci-nixon-franco-madrid-201410081432.html|title=Francisco Franco y Richard Nixon|last=ABC|work=ABC.es|access-date=17 November 2017|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the regime change that followed Franco's death in 1975, however, those that remained most loyal to Francoism were relegated to far-right movements that failed to gain a single seat in 1977 (and only elected a single MP, [[Blas Piñar]], in the [[Spanish general election, 1979|second general elections in 1979]] under the coalitionist [[National Union (Spain)|Unión nacional]] banner).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/blas-pi-ar-extremist-who-remained-stubbornly-loyal-to-the-memory-of-franco-and-strove-to-prevent-the-9100633.html|title=Blas Piñar: Extremist who remained stubbornly loyal to the memory of|date=1 February 2014|work=The Independent|access-date=17 November 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The political right, represented by a coalition of former Francoist administrators under the banner of the [[People's Alliance (Spain)|Alianza Popular]] (referred to as ''aperturistas'', those in favour of social reform), attempted to strike a balance between the need to connect with the social majority while at the same time minimizing associations with the past, though with very little electoral success. During the 1970s and 1980s, the social majority tended to vote for parties from the centre (such as the [[Union of the Democratic Centre (Spain)|UCD]], led by [[Adolfo Suárez]]) or the left ([[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party|PSOE]]).

In a book about the Transition, [[Alfonso Osorio]], a member of the 1977 Adolfo Suárez government, describes the reasons behind Alianza Popular's failure to capitalize on sociological Francoism:&lt;blockquote&gt;What the Alianza Popular intended for, in essence, was to use sociological francoism to their advantage. But as it worked out, what they actually capitalized on was the lingering, and less significant, political Francoism...In the meantime, this sociological Francoism...favoured other democratic options closer to the centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/7212228|title=Trayectoria política de un ministro de la Corona|last=1923-|first=Osorio, Alfonso,|date=1980|publisher=Planeta|isbn=8432056642|edition=1a|location=Barcelona|oclc=7212228}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Yet the political system continued to show elements inherited from Francoism. The debate between a post-Franco ''reforma o ruptura'' (political reform or rupture) ended in a compromise reform established by constitutional consensus, as left-wing parties were conscious that their own weakness prevented a full rupture with the old regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=del Águila Tejerina|first=Rafael|date=1982|title=La transición a la democracia en España: Reforma, Ruptura y Consenso|url=http://www.cepc.es/rap/Publicaciones/Revistas/3/REPNE_025_112.pdf|journal=Revista de estudios políticos|volume=25|pages=101–128|via=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091223231453/http://www.cepc.es/rap/Publicaciones/Revistas/3/REPNE_025_112.pdf|archivedate=2009-12-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1976 onwards, King [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos I]] (designated by Franco as his successor in 1969) and his team of close advisors (essentially [[Torcuato Fernández-Miranda]] and [[Adolfo Suárez]]) implemented the agreed-upon reform, which left both the ''inmovilistas'' (ultraconservatives) and the best-known ''aperturistas'' (progressives such as [[Manuel Fraga Iribarne|Manuel Fraga]] and [[José María de Areilza, Count of Motrico|José María de Areilza]]) sidelined from the process. The degree of democracy thus achieved is questioned by some writers, including [[Armando López Salinas]], who considers it essentially controlled reform, in some sense similar to [[Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa]]'s characterization of the [[Italian unification]] in his novel ''[[The Leopard]]'': The [[ruling class]]es need to change something so that everything remains the same".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unidadcivicaporlarepublica.es/opinion2/transicion%20armando.htm|title=Unidad Cívica por la República|last=López Salinas|first=Armando|date=April 2004|website=www.unidadcivicaporlarepublica.es|access-date=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Con Franco vivíamos mejor''  ==
A sign of the survival of Francoist sentiment in a large segment of the population was, among other things, the widespread success of far-right sympathiser [[Fernando Vizcaíno Casas]]' satirical novels (''[[Al tercer año resucitó]]'', ''De camisa vieja a chaqueta nueva''), which express viewpoints associated with the then-popular saying "'''''Con Franco vivíamos mejor'''''" (literally, "We lived better with Franco"). Even in 2007, in the context of the debates surrounding the [[Historical Memory Law]], there was still resistance among large segments of society and the political establishment to condemn Francoism, as demonstrated by Spanish right-wing politician [[Jaime Mayor Oreja]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;Why should I have to condemn Francoism when there were many families that lived it with naturalness and normality? In my Basque lands there were endless myths. The [Spanish Civil] war was much worse than Francoism. Some say that the persecutions in Basque towns were terrible, but it can't have been the case if all the Civil Guards from Galicia were asking to be sent to the Basque Country. It was a situation of extraordinary tranquility. Let's leave the commentaries on Francoism to the historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lavozdegalicia.es/noticia/espana/2007/10/14/tener-condenar-franquismo/0003_6226393.htm|title="¿Por qué voy a tener que condenar yo el franquismo?"|date=14 October 2007|work=La Voz de Galicia|access-date=29 November 2017|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The so-called "traditional values" also remained identified with Francoism: country, religion, and family. As such, "Francoism" is used, in some respects, as synonymous with [[conservatism]], [[patriarchy]], [[traditionalist conservatism]], or [[authoritarianism]]; all long-standing phenomena that predate Franco. Indeed, some even reverse the cause and effect between Franco and sociologicial Francoism, positing Franco as the effect of a ''pre-existing'' sociological Francoism, as described by former ''[[El País]]'' editor-in-chief [[Juan Luis Cebrián]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;I don't believe that Franco was the cause, but rather the consequence. I don't think that Franco or Francoism were a sort of military group that seized power, but rather the physical manifestation, or result, of a way of understanding Spain. And a large part of that way of understanding Spain has been transmitted from generation to generation among the sectors of the Spanish right-wing which former president Aznar belongs to, and in which I was educated. I went to the same school as Aznar; my family is, sociologically, like Aznar's; I studied where he studied, which is to say, the Salamanca neighbourhood of Madrid. That is the sociological Francoism to which I belonged, and thus know so well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.generacionxxi.com/entrevistas/CEBRIAN.HTM|title=Juan Luis Cebrián|date=26 February 2008|access-date=29 November 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226071242/http://www.generacionxxi.com/entrevistas/CEBRIAN.HTM|archivedate=26 February 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The Spanish journalist [[Enrique Gil Calvo]] adds ''desarrollismo'' – the quick and unscrupulous economic growth that brought about the so-called [[Spanish Miracle]] – as another area that has remained identified with Francoism, describing Madrid as having changed from the "red breakwater of all the Spains" to an "ostentatious showcase of upstart sociological neo-Francoism".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://elpais.com/diario/2008/10/18/babelia/1224287414_850215.html|title=Crítica {{!}} Espejismo del espacio público|last=País|first=Ediciones El|date=18 October 2008|work=EL PAÍS|access-date=29 November 2017|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The writer [[Manuel Vázquez Montalbán]] has been attributed with penning the satirical derivative phrase ''"contra Franco vivíamos'' ''mejor"'' (literally "We lived better against Franco").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.publico.es/actualidad/franco-viviamos-mejor.html|title=¿Contra Franco vivíamos mejor?|access-date=29 November 2017|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Esto con Franco no pasaba''  ==
Another saying that remains present in Spanish society is ''"'''Esto con Franco no pasaba'''"'' (literally "This never used to happen with Franco"). It was initially used as a way of denouncing behaviours, arising soon after the death of Franco, that contradicted the norms of the then-pervasive ultra-Catholic morality (see: the ''destape'' (literally "uncovering") period of Spanish cinema that followed the abolition of censorship, or the [[La Movida Madrileña|Movida Madrileña]]).

Currently it is only used in a rhetorical way to point out the irony that, despite living in a liberal democracy, some freedoms that were permitted by the Francoist regime, such as smoking in public places or barbecuing in the mountains or the beach, have been taken away. Similarly, it is used to criticize current problems in society that did not exist in the Franco era, like the [[Spanish property bubble]], and the consequent delay in young adults leaving the family home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.larioja.com/20080516/opinion/esto-franco-pasaba-20080516.html|title=Esto con Franco no pasaba. larioja.com|website=www.larioja.com|access-date=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Moncloa syndrome ==
[[File:Palacio de la Moncloa.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Palace of Moncloa]] has been the official residence of the Prime Minister since Adolfo Suárez moved it from the former, traditional, location at 3 [[Paseo de la Castellana]] next to the [[Plaza de Colón|Plaza de Coló]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;n in Madrid. The isolation attributed to the new location, in a palace whose setting in the northeastern part of the capital brings to mind Franco's residence in the [[Royal Palace of El Pardo]], is reflected in the expression "Moncloa syndrome", which is used to describe the haughtiness or detachment from reality that has supposedly affected all successive Prime Ministers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://elpais.com/diario/2010/07/25/domingo/1280029953_850215.html|title=Reportaje {{!}} "He pasado noches sin dormir"|last=País|first=Ediciones El|date=25 July 2010|work=EL PAÍS|access-date=30 November 2017|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Debates have continued as to whether, in a democratic sense, the lasting effects of Francoism were greater or lesser than the actual changes. One aspect described as an inheritance from the Francoist past is the notable individualism of Spain's leadership (e.g. [[Adolfo Suárez|Adolfo Suarez]], [[Felipe González]], [[José María Aznar]], [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]] and [[Mariano Rajoy]]) coupled with the extraordinary sway that the government holds over the [[Cortes Generales|parliament]], much greater than in other European democracies. Although the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|1978 Constitution]] cannot be described as a [[presidential system]], the powers held by the [[Prime Minister of Spain|Prime Minister]] are ample. On the other hand, the investiture of the Prime Minister has always occurred without too many issues – the inconclusive [[Spanish general election, 2015|2015 general election]] notwithstanding – especially compared to other [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracies]] (such as Italy); government mandates have been stable (except for the failed [[23-F|''coup d'état'' of 1981]], or perhaps precisely because of it) and lengthy (except the government of [[Leopoldo Calvo-Sotelo]], due to that same circumstance), and have never resorted to [[coalition government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.es/hemeroteca/historico-29-01-2008/abc/Opinion/if-i-were-zapatero-if-i-were-rajoy-(reflexiones-para-un-momento-postelectoral)_1641595667604.html|title=If I were Zapatero... If I were Rajoy (Reflexiones para un momento postelectoral) {{!}} Opinión {{!}} La Tercera - Abc.es|last=ABC|website=ABC|access-date=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A final aspect is the fact that the Spanish government has traditionally been a two-party system with smaller, peripheral [[Nationalisms and regionalisms of Spain|nationalist/regionalist parties]], although the recent rise of [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]] has produced a more fragmented parliament.

== Criticism of the concept ==
In an essay, the Spanish academic [[Carlos Ollero]] expressed the following reservations about the concept of sociological Francoism:&lt;blockquote&gt;I think that this expression is imprecise and can lend itself to misunderstandings. It is necessary to distinguish between two interrelated, yet different, meanings, with varying degrees of effectiveness. The first, stricter, meaning refers to the complex of socioeconomic structures and concrete interests that are created, maintained and strengthened by the Francoist system. The second, too broad, includes under the umbrella term of "sociological Francoism" what, in general terms, can be understood as the ensemble of sociopolitical attitudes, consistencies in personal and collective behaviour, and passive or indecisive inertia prompted by forty years of steadfast exercise of personal power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ollero|first=Carlos|date=May–June 1984|title=Cambio político, monarquía parlamentaria y consolidación de la democracia|url=http://www.cuentayrazon.org/revista/doc/017/Num017_006.doc|journal=Cuenta y Razón|volume=17|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Space Shuttle program''' was the fourth [[human spaceflight]] program carried out by the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA), which accomplished routine transportation for Earth-to-orbit crew and cargo from 1981 to 2011. Its official name, '''Space Transportation System (STS)''', was taken from a 1969 plan for [[Space Transportation System|a system of reusable spacecraft]] of which it was the only item funded for development.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/taskgrp.html|title=Space Task Group Report, 1969|first=Roger D.|last=Launius}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Space Shuttle]]—composed of an [[Space Shuttle orbiter|orbiter]] launched with two reusable [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|solid rocket boosters]] and a disposable [[Space Shuttle external tank|external fuel tank]]—carried up to eight [[astronaut]]s and up to {{Convert|50000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of [[Payload (air and space craft)|payload]] into [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO). When its mission was complete, the orbiter would [[atmospheric reentry|re-enter]] the [[Earth]]'s atmosphere and land like a [[glider (aircraft)|glider]] at either the [[Kennedy Space Center]] or [[Edwards Air Force Base]].

The Shuttle is the only winged manned spacecraft to have achieved orbit and landing, and the only reusable manned space vehicle that has ever made multiple flights into orbit (the Russian shuttle [[Buran (spacecraft)|Buran]] was very similar and was designed to have the same capabilities but made only one unmanned spaceflight before it was cancelled). Its [[List of space shuttle missions|missions]] involved carrying large payloads to various orbits (including segments to be added to the [[International Space Station]] (ISS)), providing crew rotation for the space station, and performing service missions. The orbiter also recovered [[satellite]]s and other payloads (e.g., from the ISS) from orbit and returned them to Earth, though its use in this capacity was rare. Each vehicle was designed with a projected lifespan of 100 launches, or 10 years' operational life, though original selling points on the shuttles were over 150 launches and over a 15-year operational span with a 'launch per month' expected at the peak of the program, but extensive delays in the development of the International Space Station&lt;ref name="iss-casis.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iss-casis.org/About/ISSTimeline.aspx|title=International Space Station Historical Timeline}}&lt;/ref&gt; never created such a peak demand for frequent flights.

==Background==
Various shuttle concepts had been explored since the late 1960s. The program formally commenced in 1972, becoming the sole focus of NASA's manned operations after the [[Apollo program|Apollo]], [[Skylab]], and [[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project|Apollo-Soyuz]] programs in 1975. The Shuttle was originally conceived of and presented to the public in 1972 as a 'Space Truck' which would, among other things, be used to build a United States space station in [[low Earth orbit]] during the 1980s and then be replaced by a new vehicle by the early 1990s. The stalled plans for a U.S. space station evolved into the [[International Space Station]] and were formally initiated in 1983 by President [[Ronald Reagan]], but the ISS suffered from long delays, design changes and cost over-runs&lt;ref name="iss-casis.org"/&gt; and forced the service life of the Space Shuttle to be extended several times until 2011 when it was finally retired—serving twice as long than it was originally designed to do. In 2004, according to President [[George W. Bush]]'s [[Vision for Space Exploration]], use of the Space Shuttle was to be focused almost exclusively on completing assembly of the ISS, which was far behind schedule at that point.

The first experimental orbiter [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|''Enterprise'']] was a high-altitude glider, launched from the back of a specially modified Boeing 747, only for [[Approach and Landing Tests|initial atmospheric landing tests (ALT)]]. ''Enterprise'''s first test flight was on February 18, 1977, only five years after the Shuttle program was formally initiated; leading to the launch of the first space-worthy shuttle ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'' on April 12, 1981 on [[STS-1]]. The Space Shuttle program finished with its last mission, [[STS-135]] flown by [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']], in July 2011, retiring the final Shuttle in the fleet. The Space Shuttle program formally ended on August 31, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n1108/29shannon/ |title=Breaking News &amp;#124; Shannon to review options for deep space exploration |publisher=Spaceflight Now |date=August 29, 2011 |accessdate=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conception and development==
{{Main|Space Shuttle design process}}
[[File:North American Rockwell P333.jpg|thumb|North American Rockwell's initial shuttle design. The original, fully reusable concept used a piloted, winged booster stage, essentially a larger version of the orbiter stage.]]
Before the [[Apollo 11]] moon landing in 1969, NASA began early studies of space shuttle designs. In 1969, President [[Richard Milhous Nixon|Richard Nixon]] formed the [[Space Task Group]], chaired by Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]]. This group outlined ambitious post-Apollo missions centered on a large permanently manned [[space station]], a small reusable logistics vehicle that would support it, and ultimately a manned mission to [[Mars]]. Smaller goals included a variety of space vehicles for moving spacecraft around in [[orbit]].&lt;ref name="decision"&gt;Hepplewhite, T.A. [https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4221/sp4221.htm ''The Space Shuttle Decision: NASA's Search for a Reusable Space Vehicle'']. Washington, DC: National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Presenting the plans to Nixon, Agnew was told that the administration would not commit to a Mars mission, and limited activity to low Earth orbit for the immediate future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.planetary.org/blogs/guest-blogs/jason-callahan/20141003-how-richard-nixon-changed-nasa.html |title= How Richard Nixon Changed NASA |first=Jason |last=Callahan |date= October 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was then told to select one of the two remaining proposals. After some debate between the station and the vehicle, the vehicle was chosen; suitably designed, such a spacecraft could perform some longer-duration missions and thus fill some of the goals of the station, and over the longer run, could help lower the cost of access to space and make the station less expensive.&lt;ref name="decision"/&gt;

The goal, as presented by NASA to Congress, was to provide a much less-expensive means of access to space that would be used by NASA, the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], and other commercial and scientific users.&lt;ref&gt;General Accounting Office. Cost Benefit Analysis Used in Support of the Space Shuttle Program. Washington, DC: General Accounting Office, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

During early shuttle development there was great debate about the optimal shuttle design that best balanced capability, development cost and operating cost. Ultimately chosen was a design using a reusable winged orbiter, reusable [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|solid rocket boosters]], and an expendable [[Space Shuttle external tank|external fuel tank]] for the orbiter's main engines.&lt;ref name="decision"/&gt;

The shuttle program was formally launched on January 5, 1972, when President Nixon announced that NASA would proceed with the development of a reusable space shuttle system.&lt;ref name="decision"/&gt; The stated goals of "transforming the space frontier...into familiar territory, easily accessible for human endeavor"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_vault/2012/11/15/the_space_shuttle_nixon_s_aides_asked_him_to_reconsider_the_program_s_name.html |title=I Say "Space Shuttle," You Say "Space Clipper" |author=Rebecca Onion |date=November 15, 2012 |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |publisher=[[The Slate Group]] |accessdate=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; was to be achieved by launching as many as 50 missions per year, with hopes of driving down per-mission costs.&lt;ref name="AP July 2011"&gt;{{cite news|last=Borenstein|first=Seth|title=AP Science Writer|url=http://www.boston.com/news/science/articles/2011/07/05/space_shuttles_legacy_soaring_in_orbit_and_costs/|accessdate=5 July 2011|newspaper=Boston Globe|date=July 5, 2011|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prime contractor for the program was [[North American Rockwell]] (later [[Rockwell International]], now [[Boeing]]), the same company responsible for building the [[Apollo Command/Service Module]]. The contractor for the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters was [[Thiokol|Morton Thiokol]] (now part of [[Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems]]), for the external tank, [[Martin Marietta]] (now [[Lockheed Martin]]), and for the [[Space Shuttle main engine]]s, [[Rocketdyne]] (now [[Aerojet Rocketdyne]]).&lt;ref name="decision"/&gt;

The first orbiter was originally planned to be named ''Constitution'', but a massive write-in campaign from fans of the ''[[Star Trek]]'' television series convinced the White House to change the name to ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]''.&lt;ref name="orbiter names"&gt;Brooks, Dawn (date unknown).

[[File:Space Shuttle Approach and Landing Tests crews.jpg|thumb|Shuttle approach and landing test crews, 1976]]
All Space Shuttle missions were launched from the Kennedy Space Center (KSC).&lt;ref&gt;Civilian and military circumpolar space shuttle missions were planned for [[Vandenberg Air Force Base#Space Shuttle|Vandenberg AFB]] in California. The use of Vandenberg AFB for space shuttle missions was cancelled after space shuttle ''Challenger'' exploded on January 28, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Space shuttle launch commit criteria|weather criteria used for launch]] included, but were not limited to: precipitation, temperatures, cloud cover, lightning forecast, wind, and humidity.&lt;ref name="weather launch criteria"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-pao.ksc.nasa.gov/kscpao/release/1999/39-99.htm|title=Space Shuttle Weather Launch Commit Criteria and KSC End of Mission Weather Landing Criteria|work=KSC Release No. 39-99|publisher=NASA Kennedy Space Center|accessdate=July 6, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090626180630/http://www-pao.ksc.nasa.gov/kscpao/release/1999/39-99.htm|archivedate=June 26, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Shuttle was not launched under conditions where it could have been struck by [[lightning]].

The first fully functional orbiter was ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'' (designated OV-102), built in [[Palmdale, California]]. It was delivered to [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC) on March 25, 1979, and was first launched on April 12, 1981—the 20th anniversary of [[Yuri Gagarin]]'s [[Vostok 1|space flight]]—with a crew of two.

''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'' (OV-099) was delivered to KSC in July 1982, ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'' (OV-103) in November 1983, ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' (OV-104) in April 1985 and ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'' in May 1991. ''Challenger'' was originally built and used as a Structural Test Article (STA-099), but was converted to a complete orbiter when this was found to be less expensive than converting ''Enterprise'' from its Approach and Landing Test configuration into a spaceworthy vehicle.

On April 24, 1990, ''Discovery'' carried the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] into space during [[STS-31]].

In the course of 135 missions flown, two orbiters (''Columbia'' and ''Challenger'') suffered catastrophic accidents, with the loss of all crew members, totaling 14 astronauts.

The accidents led to national level inquiries and detailed analysis of why the accidents occurred.&lt;ref name="space.com"/&gt; There was a significant pause where changes were made before the Shuttles returned to flight.&lt;ref name="space.com"/&gt; The ''Columbia'' disaster occurred in 2003, but STS took more than a year off before returning to flight in June 2005 with the STS-114 mission.&lt;ref name="space.com"/&gt; The previous break was between January 1986 (when the ''Challenger'' disaster occurred) and 32 months later when [[STS-26]] was launched on September 29, 1988.&lt;ref name="history.nasa.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4219/Chapter15.html|title=Return to Flight...Challenger Accident|first=John A.|last=Logsdon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The longest Shuttle mission was [[STS-80]] lasting 17 days, 15 hours. The final flight of the Space Shuttle program was [[STS-135]] on July 8, 2011.

Since the Shuttle's retirement in 2011, many of its original duties are performed by an assortment of government and private vessels. The European ATV [[Automated Transfer Vehicle]] supplied the ISS between 2008 and 2015. Classified military missions are being flown by the US Air Force's unmanned [[space plane]], the [[Boeing X-37|X-37B]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}. By 2012, cargo to the International Space Station was already being delivered commercially under NASA's [[Commercial Resupply Services]] by SpaceX's partially reusable [[SpaceX Dragon|Dragon spacecraft]], followed by Orbital Sciences' [[Cygnus (spacecraft)|Cygnus spacecraft]] in late 2013. Crew service to the ISS is currently provided by the Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]] while work on the [[Commercial Crew Development|Commercial Crew Development program]] proceeds; the first crewed flight of this is planned for January 27, 2019, on the [[SpaceX]] [[Falcon 9]] with [[Dragon 2]] crew capsule.&lt;ref&gt;https://blogs.nasa.gov/commercialcrew/2018/01/11/nasas-commercial-crew-program-target-test-flight-dates-2/&lt;/ref&gt; For missions beyond [[low Earth orbit]], NASA is building the [[Space Launch System]] and the [[Orion (spacecraft)]].

Early during development of the space shuttle, NASA had estimated that the program would cost $7.45&amp;nbsp;billion ($43&amp;nbsp;billion in 2011 dollars, adjusting for inflation) in development/non-recurring costs, and $9.3M ($54M in 2011 dollars) per flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|date=February 1973|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early estimates for the cost to deliver payload to low earth orbit were as low as $118 per pound ($260/kg) of payload ($635/lb or $1,400/kg in 2011 dollars), based on marginal or incremental launch costs, and assuming a 65,000 pound (30&amp;nbsp;000&amp;nbsp;kg) payload capacity and 50 launches per year.&lt;ref&gt;NASA (2003) [http://caib.nasa.gov/events/public_hearings/20030423/transcript_am.html Columbia Accident Investigation Board Public Hearing Transcript] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060812151208/http://caib.nasa.gov/events/public_hearings/20030423/transcript_am.html |date=August 12, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="costbenefit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.gao.gov/f0302/096542.pdf|title=Report to the Congress: Cost-Benefit Analylsis Used in Support of the Space Shuttle Program|accessdate=November 25, 2008|publisher=United States General Accounting Office|year=1972|author=Comptroller General|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more realistic projection of 12 flights per year for the 15-year service life combined with the initial development costs would have resulted in a total cost projection for the program of roughly $54&amp;nbsp;billion (in 2011 dollars).

Per-launch costs can be measured by dividing the total cost over the life of the program (including buildings, facilities, training, salaries, etc.) by the number of launches.

NASA used a [[management philosophy]] known as success-oriented management during the Space Shuttle program which was described by historian Alex Roland in the aftermath of the [[Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' disaster]] as "hoping for the best".&lt;ref name="roland"&gt;{{cite web |title=Roland Statement |url=https://history.nasa.gov/columbia/Troxell/Columbia%20Web%20Site/Documents/Congress/Senate/FEBRUA~1/roland_statement.html |publisher=NASA |accessdate=18 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Success-oriented management has since been studied by several analysts in the area.&lt;ref name="som1"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Weinrich |first1=Heinz |title=Management: A Global, Innovative, and Entrepreneurial Perspective |date=2013 |page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="som2"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Klikauer |first1=Thomas |title=Management Education: Fragments of an Emancipatory Theory |date=2016 |page=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="som3"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Keuper |first1=Franz |title=Finance Bundling and Finance Transformation: Shared Services Next Level |date=2013 |page=i}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the course of 135 missions flown, two orbiters were destroyed, with loss of crew totalling 14 astronauts:
* ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'' – lost 73 seconds after liftoff, [[STS-51-L]], January 28, 1986
* ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'' – lost approximately 16 minutes before its expected landing, [[STS-107]], February 1, 2003

There was also one [[Space Shuttle abort modes|abort-to-orbit]] and some fatal accidents on the ground during launch preparations.

===''Challenger'' 1986===
Close-up video footage of ''Challenger'' during its final launch on January 28, 1986 clearly show it began due to an [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|O-ring failure]] on the right solid rocket booster (SRB). The hot plume of gas leaking from the failed joint caused the collapse of the external tank, which then resulted in the orbiter's disintegration due to high aerodynamic stress. The accident resulted in the loss of all seven astronauts on board. ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'' (OV-105) was built to replace ''Challenger'' (using structural spare parts originally intended for the other orbiters) and delivered in May 1991; it was first launched a year later.

After the loss of ''Challenger'', NASA grounded the shuttle program for over two years, making numerous safety changes recommended by the [[Rogers Commission Report]], which included a redesign of the SRB joint that failed in the ''Challenger'' accident. Other safety changes included a new escape system for use when the orbiter was in controlled flight, improved landing gear tires and brakes, and the reintroduction of pressure suits for shuttle astronauts (these had been discontinued after [[STS-4]]; astronauts wore only coveralls and oxygen helmets from that point on until the ''Challenger'' accident). The shuttle program continued in September 1988 with the launch of ''Discovery'' on [[STS-26]].

The accidents did not just affect the technical design of the orbiter, but also NASA.&lt;ref name="history.nasa.gov"/&gt;
Quoting some recommendations made by the post-''Challenger'' Rogers commission:&lt;ref name="history.nasa.gov"/&gt;
{{Quote|&lt;poem&gt;
'''Recommendation I''' – The faulty Solid Rocket Motor joint and seal must be changed. This could be a new design eliminating the joint or a redesign of the current joint and seal. ... the Administrator of NASA should request the National Research Council to form an independent Solid Rocket Motor design oversight committee to implement the Commission's design recommendations and oversee the design effort.
'''Recommendation II''' – The Shuttle Program Structure should be reviewed. ... NASA should encourage the transition of qualified astronauts into agency management Positions.
'''Recommendation III''' – NASA and the primary shuttle contractors should review all Criticality 1, 1R, 2, and 2R items and hazard analyses.
'''Recommendation IV''' – NASA should establish an Office of Safety, Reliability and Quality Assurance to be headed by an Associate Administrator, reporting directly to the NASA Administrator.
'''Recommendation VI''' – NASA must take actions to improve landing safety. The tire, brake and nosewheel system must be improved.
'''Recommendation VII''' – Make all efforts to provide a crew escape system for use during controlled gliding flight.
'''Recommendation VIII''' – The nation's reliance on the shuttle as its principal space launch capability created a relentless pressure on NASA to increase the flight rate ... NASA must establish a flight rate that is consistent with its resources.
&lt;/poem&gt;}}

===''Columbia''  2003===

The shuttle program operated accident-free for seventeen years after the ''Challenger'' disaster, until [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' broke up on re-entry]], killing all seven crew members, on February 1, 2003. The accident began when a piece of foam shed from the external tank struck the leading edge of the orbiter's left wing, puncturing one of the reinforced carbon-carbon (RCC) panels that covered the wing edge and protected it during re-entry. As ''Columbia'' re-entered the atmosphere, hot gas penetrated the wing and destroyed it from the inside out, causing the orbiter to lose control and disintegrate.

After the ''Columbia'' disaster, the International Space Station operated on a skeleton crew of two for more than two years and was serviced primarily by Russian spacecraft. While the "Return to Flight" mission [[STS-114]] in 2005 was successful, a similar piece of foam from a different portion of the tank was shed. Although the debris did not strike ''Discovery'', the program was grounded once again for this reason.

The second "Return to Flight" mission, [[STS-121]] launched on July 4, 2006, at 14:37 (EDT). Two previous launches were scrubbed because of lingering thunderstorms and high winds around the launch pad, and the launch took place despite objections from its chief engineer and safety head. A five-inch (13&amp;nbsp;cm) crack in the foam insulation of the external tank gave cause for concern; however, the Mission Management Team gave the go for launch.&lt;ref&gt;Chien, Philip (June 27, 2006) [http://www.washtimes.com/national/20060626-110227-5543r.htm "NASA wants shuttle to fly despite safety misgivings."] ''The Washington Times''&lt;/ref&gt; This mission increased the ISS crew to three. ''Discovery'' touched down successfully on July 17, 2006 at 09:14 (EDT) on Runway 15 at [[John F. Kennedy Space Center|Kennedy Space Center]].

Following the success of [[STS-121]], all subsequent missions were completed without major foam problems, and the construction of ISS was completed (during the [[STS-118]] mission in August 2007, the orbiter was again struck by a foam fragment on liftoff, but this damage was minimal compared to the damage sustained by ''Columbia'').

The ''Columbia'' Accident Investigation Board, in its report, noted the reduced risk to the crew when a shuttle flew to the International Space Station (ISS), as the station could be used as a safe haven for the crew awaiting rescue in the event that damage to the orbiter on ascent made it unsafe for re-entry. The board recommended that for the remaining flights, the shuttle always orbit with the station. Prior to STS-114, NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe declared that all future flights of the shuttle would go to the ISS, precluding the possibility of executing the final [[Hubble Space Telescope]] servicing mission which had been scheduled before the ''Columbia'' accident, despite the fact that millions of dollars worth of upgrade equipment for Hubble were ready and waiting in NASA warehouses. Many dissenters, including astronauts {{who|date=September 2013}}, asked NASA management to reconsider allowing the mission, but initially the director stood firm. On October 31, 2006, [[NASA]] announced approval of the launch of ''Atlantis'' for the fifth and final shuttle servicing mission to the Hubble Space Telescope, scheduled for August 28, 2008. However SM4/[[STS-125]] eventually launched in May 2009.

One impact of ''Columbia'' was that future crewed launch vehicles, namely the [[Ares I]], had a special emphasis on crew safety compared to other considerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/7126-dumping-nasa-ares-rocket-cost-billions.html|title=Dumping NASA's New Ares I Rocket Would Cost Billions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NASA maintains extensive, warehoused catalogs of recovered pieces from the two destroyed orbiters.

==Retirement==
[[File:STS-135 begins takeoff.jpg|thumb|''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' begins the last mission of the Space Shuttle program]]
{{main|Space Shuttle retirement}}

The Space Shuttle program was extended several times beyond its originally envisioned 15-year life span because of the delays in building the United States space station in low Earth orbit—a project which eventually evolved into the [[International Space Station]]. It was formally scheduled for mandatory retirement in 2010 in accord with the directives President George W. Bush issued on January 14, 2004 in his Vision for Space Exploration.&lt;ref name="bushvision"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/missions/solarsystem/bush_vision.html|title=President Bush Offers New Vision For NASA|accessdate=January 14, 2004|publisher=nasa.gov|year=2004|author=President George W. Bush (Attributed)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A$2.5&amp;nbsp;billion spending provision allowing NASA to fly the Space Shuttle beyond its then-scheduled retirement in 2010 passed the Congress in April 2009, although neither NASA nor the White House requested the one-year extension.&lt;ref&gt;Mark, Roy "Mandatory Shuttle Retirement Temporarily Postponed" (April 30, 2009) ''Green IT'', e-week.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The final Space Shuttle launch was that of ''Atlantis'' on July 8, 2011. Although the retirement was planned and roughly in line with what was expected out of STS without further upgrades, the planned replacement for the STS, the Constellation program was cancelled the year before STS concluded. The two programs that took its place, two undetermined commercial crew vehicles and SLS with Orion needed even more time to have a new launcher. NASA has continued to fly to the station via its [[Roscosmos]] partner, who still has a functioning manned launcher, the Soyuz system. Manned launch systems have been proposed by other countries, such as the ESA's mini-shuttle [[Hermes (spacecraft)|Hermes]] launched by an [[Ariane rocket]], which was cancelled in 1992.

==Preservations==
[[File:Space Shuttle Discovery @ Udvar Hazy.png|thumb|left|Space Shuttle ''Discovery'' at the Udvar Hazy museum]]
Out of the five fully functional shuttle orbiters built, three remain. ''Enterprise'', which was used for atmospheric test flights but not for orbital flight, had many parts taken out for use on the other orbiters. It was later visually restored and was on display at the [[National Air and Space Museum]]'s [[Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center]] until April 19, 2012. ''Enterprise'' was moved to New York City in April 2012 to be displayed at the [[Intrepid Sea, Air &amp; Space Museum]], whose Space Shuttle Pavilion opened on July 19, 2012.  ''Discovery'' replaced ''Enterprise'' at the [[National Air and Space Museum]]'s [[Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center]]. ''Atlantis'' formed part of the Space Shuttle Exhibit at the [[Kennedy Space Center]] visitor complex and has been on display there since June 29, 2013 following its refurbishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/space-shuttle-atlantis-exhibit-opens-support-souvenirs-180805853.html|title=Space Shuttle Atlantis Exhibit Opens with Support from Souvenirs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 14, 2012, ''Endeavour'' completed an unprecedented {{convert|12|mi|km|abbr=on}} drive on city streets from [[Los Angeles International Airport]] to the [[California Science Center]], where it has been on display in a temporary hangar since late 2012. The transport from the airport took two days and required major street closures, the removal of over 400 city trees, and extensive work to raise power lines, level the street, and temporarily remove street signs, lamp posts, and other obstacles.  Hundreds of volunteers, and fire and police personnel, helped with the transport.  Large crowds of spectators waited on the streets to see the shuttle as it passed through the city. ''Endeavour'' will be displayed permanently beginning in 2017 at the [[Samuel Oschin]] Air and Space Center (an addition to the California Science Center currently under construction), where it will be mounted in the vertical position complete with solid rocket boosters and an external tank.&lt;ref name="casc"&gt;{{cite web | title=Space Shuttle Endeavour homepage | url=http://www.californiasciencecenter.org/GenInfo/Membership/Campaign/Campaign.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One area of Space Shuttle applications is an expanded crew.&lt;ref name=orbiter&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/reference/basics/orbiter/index.html|title=Human Space Flight (HSF) – Space Shuttle}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crews of up to eight have been flown in the Orbiter, but it could have held at least a crew of ten.&lt;ref name=orbiter/&gt; Various proposals for filling the payload bay with additional passengers were also made as early as 1979.&lt;ref name=reichert&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spacefuture.com/archive/the_future_of_space_tourism.shtml|title=Space Future – The Future of Space Tourism|first=Peter Wainwright|last=(www.spacefuture.com)}}&lt;/ref&gt; One proposal by [[Rockwell International|Rockwell]] provided seating for 74 passengers in the Orbiter payload bay, with support for three days in Earth orbit.&lt;ref name=reichert/&gt; With a smaller 64 seat orbiter, costs for the late 1980s would be around 1.5&amp;nbsp;million USD per seat per launch.&lt;ref name=david&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spacefuture.com/archive/the_space_tourist.shtml|title=Space Future – The Space Tourist|first=Peter Wainwright|last=(www.spacefuture.com)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rockwell passenger module had two decks, four seats across on top and two on the bottom, including a 25-inch (63.5&amp;nbsp;cm) wide isle and extra storage space.&lt;ref name=david/&gt;

Another design was Space Habitation Design Associates 1983 proposal for 72 passengers in the Space Shuttle Payload bay.&lt;ref name=david/&gt; Passengers were located in 6 sections, each with windows and its own loading ramp at launch, and with seats in different configurations for launch and landing.&lt;ref name=david/&gt; Another proposal was based on the Spacelab habitation modules, which provided 32 seats in the payload bay in addition to those in the cockpit area.&lt;ref name=david/&gt;

There were some efforts to analyze commercial operation of STS.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/files/SP-2014-617.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Using the NASA figure for average cost to launch a Space Shuttle as of 2011 at about $450&amp;nbsp;million per mission,&lt;ref name="missionbudget"/&gt; a cost per seat for a 74&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacefuture.com/archive/images/the_space_tourist.15.gif]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="launiusr.files.wordpress.com"&gt;[https://launiusr.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/the_future_of_space_tourism-shuttle-with-passengers.gif]&lt;/ref&gt; seat module envisioned by Rockwell came to less than $6&amp;nbsp;million, not including the regular crew. Some passenger modules used hardware similar to existing equipment, such as the tunnel,&lt;ref name="launiusr.files.wordpress.com"/&gt; which was also needed for [[Spacehab]] and Spacelab

{{further|List of Space Shuttle crews}}

==Successors==
During the three decades of operation, various follow-on and replacements for the STS Space Shuttle were partially developed but not finished.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/11363-nasa-space-shuttle-replacement-30-years-anniversaries.html|title=Politics played a big role in why NASA doesn't already have a new spacecraft to replace the retiring space shuttles. Funding and technical challenges put a stop to any attempts to build the ' Space Shuttle 2.'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of possible future space vehicles to supplement or supplant STS:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
*National Aero-Space Plane (NASP)
**[[Rockwell X-30]] (not funded)
*[[Lockheed Martin X-33]] (cancelled 2001)
*[[Ares I]] (ended with Constellation cancellation)
*[[Orbital Space Plane Program]]

One effort in the direction of space transportation was the Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) program, initiated in 1994 by NASA.&lt;ref name="spinoff.nasa.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://spinoff.nasa.gov/spinoff1996/14.html|title=Reusable Launch Vehicle}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to work on the X-33 and X-34 vehicles.&lt;ref name="spinoff.nasa.gov"/&gt; NASA spent about 1&amp;nbsp;billion USD on developing the X-33 hoping for it be in operation by 2005.&lt;ref name="spinoff.nasa.gov"/&gt; Another program around the turn of the millennium was the [[Space Launch Initiative]], which was a next generation launch initaive.&lt;ref name="nasa.gov"&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/pdf/172379main_ngltfacts.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Space Launch Initiative program was started in 2001, and in late 2002 it was evolved into two programs, the [[Orbital Space Plane Program]] and the Next Generation Launch Technology program.&lt;ref name="nasa.gov"/&gt; OSP was oriented towards provided access to the International Space Station.&lt;ref name="nasa.gov"/&gt;

Other vehicles that would have taken over some of the Shuttles responsibilities were the [[HL-20 Personnel Launch System]] or the [[NASA X-38]] of the [[Crew Return Vehicle]] program, which were primarily for getting people down from ISS. The X-38 was cancelled in 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/news/nation-world/article/X-38-project-s-cancellation-irks-NASA-partners-2064969.php|title=X-38 project's cancellation irks NASA, partners}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the HL-20 was cancelled in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aerospaceguide.net/hl_20.html|title=HL-20 – Lifting Body Spaceplane for Personnel Launch System|last=x0av6|date=August 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other programs in this existed such as the Station Crew Return Alternative Module (SCRAM) and Assured Crew Return Vehicle (ACRV)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/n/nasaacrv.html|title=NASA ACRV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2004 Vision for Space Exploration, the next manned NASA program was to be [[Project Constellation]] with its [[Ares I]] and [[Ares V]] launch vehicles and the [[Orion Spacecraft]]; however, the Constellation program was never fully funded, and in early 2010 the Obama administration asked Congress to instead endorse a plan with heavy reliance on the private sector for delivering cargo and crew to LEO.

The [[Commercial Orbital Transportation Services]] (COTS) program began in 2006 with the purpose of creating commercially operated unmanned cargo vehicles to service the ISS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=NASA |date=August 18, 2006 |title=NASA Selects Crew and Cargo Transportation to Orbit Partners |url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2006/aug/HQ_06295_COTS_phase_1.html |accessdate=21 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these vehicles, [[SpaceX]]'s [[SpaceX Dragon|Dragon]], became operational in 2012, and the second, [[Orbital Sciences]]' [[Cygnus (spacecraft)|Cygnus]] did so in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2011/10/iss-partners-welcome-spacex-orbital-busy-2012/|title=ISS partners prepare to welcome SpaceX and Orbital in a busy 2012|last=Bergin|first=Chris|date=October 6, 2011|publisher=NASASpaceFlight.com (Not affiliated with NASA)|accessdate=December 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Commercial Crew Development]] (CCDev) program was initiated in 2010 with the purpose of creating commercially operated manned spacecraft capable of delivering at least four crew members to the ISS, staying docked for 180 days and then returning them back to Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spacenews.com/venture_space/100201-biggest-ccdev-award-goes-sierra-nevada.html|title=Biggest CCDev Award Goes to Sierra Nevada|last=Berger|first=Brian|date=February 1, 2011|publisher=Imaginova Corp.|accessdate=December 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These spacecraft, like the SpaceX [[Dragon V2]] and Sierra Nevada Corporation's [[Dream Chaser]] are expected to become operational around the end of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-commercial-crew-program-mission-in-sight-for-2018|title=NASA Commercial Crew Program Mission in Sight for 2018|date=January 4, 2018|publisher=NASA|accessdate=April 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Constellation program was canceled, it has been replaced with a very similar beyond low Earth orbit program. The [[Orion spacecraft]] has been left virtually unchanged from its previous design. The planned [[Ares V]] rocket has been replaced with the smaller [[Space Launch System]] (SLS), which is planned to launch both Orion and other necessary hardware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/exploration/systems/sls/sls1.html|title=NASA Announces Design for New Deep Space Exploration System|date=September 14, 2011|publisher=NASA|accessdate=April 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Exploration Flight Test 1|Exploration Flight Test-1]] (EFT-1), an unmanned test flight of the Orion spacecraft, launched on December 5, 2014 on a [[Delta IV Heavy]] rocket.&lt;ref name=schedule&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2012/02/acronyms-ascent-sls-managers-create-developmental-milestone-roadmap/|title=Acronyms to Ascent – SLS managers create development milestone roadmap|last=Bergin|first=Chris|date=February 23, 2012|publisher=NASA|accessdate=April 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Exploration Mission 1|Exploration Mission-1]] (EM-1) is the unmanned initial launch of the SLS, which is planned for 2019.&lt;ref name=schedule/&gt; Exploration Mission-2 (EM-2) is the first manned flight of Orion and SLS and is scheduled for 2023.&lt;ref name=schedule/&gt; EM-2 is a 10-14-day mission planned to place a crew of four into Lunar orbit. {{As of|2018|4}}, the destination for EM-3 and immediate destination focus for this new program is still in-flux.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2012/03/nac-select-human-exploration-destination-asap/|title=NASA Advisory Council: Select a Human Exploration Destination ASAP|last=Bergin|first=Chris|date=March 26, 2012|publisher=NasaSpaceflight (not affiliated with NASA)|accessdate=April 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assets and transition plan==
[[File:STS-135 30 mins after touchdown2.png|250px|thumb|''Atlantis'' about 30 minutes after final touchdown]]
The Space Shuttle program occupied over 654 facilities, used over 1.2&amp;nbsp;million line items of equipment, and employed over 5,000 people. The total value of equipment was over $12&amp;nbsp;billion. Shuttle-related facilities represented over a quarter of NASA's inventory. There were over 1,200 active suppliers to the program throughout the United States. NASA's transition plan had the program operating through 2010 with a transition and retirement phase lasting through 2015. During this time, the [[Ares I]] and [[Orion (Constellation program)|Orion]] as well as the Altair Lunar Lander were to be under development,&lt;ref name="NTMP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/202388main_Transition_Mgmt_Plan-Final.pdf|title=NASA Transition Management Plan|last=Olson|first=John|author2=Joel Kearns |date=August 2008|work=JICB-001|publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt; although these programs have since been canceled.

in the 2010s, two major programs for human spaceflight were [[Commercial Crew Development]] and the [[Space Launch System]] with the [[Orion (spacecraft)|Orion capsule]].&lt;reF&gt;[https://oig.nasa.gov/docs/IG-17-017.pdf]&lt;/reF&gt; [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39]] was, for example, used to launch a [[Falcon Heavy]] rocket.

==Critiques==
{{Main|Criticism of the Space Shuttle program}}
The Space Shuttle program has been criticized for failing to achieve its promised cost and utility goals, as well as design, cost, management, and safety issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idlewords.com/2005/08/a_rocket_to_nowhere.htm A Rocket to Nowhere], Maciej Cegłowski, Idle Words, March 8, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Others have argued that the Shuttle program was a step backwards from the Apollo Program, which, while extremely dangerous, accomplished far more scientific and space exploration endeavors than the Shuttle ever could.

After both the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' disaster]] and the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' disaster]], high-profile boards convened to investigate the accidents with both committees returning praise and serious critiques to the program and NASA management. Some of the most famous of the criticisms, most of management, came from Nobel Prize winner [[Richard Feynman]], in his report that followed his [[Rogers Commission#Role of Richard Feynman|appointment to the commission]] responsible for investigating the ''Challenger'' disaster.&lt;ref name="Commission report"&gt;http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/51-l/docs/rogers-commission/Appendix-F.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support vehicles==

Many other vehicles were used in support of the Space Shuttle program, mainly terrestrial transportation vehicles.

* The [[Crawler-Transporter]] carried the [[Mobile Launcher Platform]] and the Space Shuttle from the [[Vehicle Assembly Building]] (VAB) to [[Launch Complex&amp;nbsp;39]], originally built for Project Apollo.
* The [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]] (SCA) were two modified [[Boeing 747]]s. Either could fly an orbiter from alternative landing sites back to the [[Kennedy Space Center]]. These aircraft were retired to the [[Joe Davies Heritage Airpark]] at the [[Armstrong Flight Research Center]] and [[Space Center Houston]].
* A 36-wheeled transport trailer, the Orbiter Transfer System, originally built for the [[U.S. Air Force]]'s launch facility at [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] in California (since then converted for [[Delta&amp;nbsp;IV rocket]]s) would transport the orbiter from the landing facility to the launch pad, which allowed both "stacking" and launch without utilizing a separate VAB-style building and crawler-transporter roadway. Prior to the closing of the Vandenberg facility, orbiters were transported from the [[Orbiter Processing Facility|OPF]] to the VAB on their undercarriages, only to be raised when the orbiter was being lifted for attachment to the SRB/ET stack. The trailer allowed the transportation of the orbiter from the OPF to either the SCA [[Mate-Demate Device|"Mate-Demate"]] stand or the VAB without placing any additional stress on the undercarriage.
* The [[Mobile_lounge#NASA_Crew_Transport_Vehicles|Crew Transport Vehicle]] (CTV), a modified airport [[Mobile lounge|jet bridge]], was used to assist astronauts to egress from the orbiter after landing. Upon entering the CTV, astronauts could take off their launch and re-entry suits then proceed to chairs and beds for medical checks before being transported back to the crew quarters in the [[Operations and Checkout Building]]. Originally built for Project Apollo.
* The [[Astronaut transfer van|Astrovan]] was used to transport astronauts from the crew quarters in the Operations and Checkout Building to the launch pad on launch day. It was also used to transport astronauts back again from the Crew Transport Vehicle at the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]].
* The three locomotives serving the [[NASA Railroad]], used to transport segments of the [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster]]s, were determined to be no longer needed for day-to-day operation at the Kennedy Space Center. In April 2015, locomotive No. 1 was sent to [[Natchitoches Parish Port]] and No. 3 sent to the [[Madison Railroad]]. Locomotive No. 2 was sent to the [[Gold Coast Railroad Museum]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NASA Railroad rides into sunset|url=http://www.floridatoday.com/story/tech/science/space/2015/05/23/nasa-railroad-rides-sunset/27784213/|work=Florida Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tanagra supports several standard [[data mining]] tasks such as: Visualization, Descriptive statistics, Instance selection, [[feature selection]], feature construction, [[regression analysis|regression]], [[factor analysis]], [[data clustering|clustering]], [[statistical classification|classification]] and [[association rule learning]].

Tanagra is an academic project. It is widely used at French-speaking universities.&lt;ref&gt;G. Gregoire, F.X. Jollois, J.F. Petiot, A. Qannari, S. Sabourin, P. Swertwaegher, J.C. Turlot, V.

==History==

The development of Tanagra was started in June 2003. The first version is distributed in December 2003. Tanagra is the successor of Sipina, another free data mining tool which is intended only for the supervised learning tasks (classification), especially an interactive and visual construction of decision trees. Sipina is still available online and is maintained.
Tanagra is an "open source project" as every researcher can access to the source code, and add his own algorithms, as far as he agrees and conforms to the software distribution license.

The main purpose of Tanagra project is to give researchers and students a user-friendly data mining software, conforming to the present norms of the software development in this domain (especially in the design of its GUI and the way to use it), and allowing to analyze either real or synthetic data.

From 2006, Ricco Rakotomalala made an important documentation effort. A large number of tutorials are published on a dedicated website. They describe the statistical and machine learning methods and their implementation with Tanagra on real case studies. The use of the other free data mining tools on the same problems is also widely described. The comparison of the tools enables to the readers to understand the possible differences in the presenting of results.

==Description==

[[File:Screenshot Tanagra software.jpg|thumb|250px|A screenshot of Tanagra software]]

Tanagra works as the current data mining tools. The user can design visually a data mining process in a diagram. Each node is a statistical or machine learning technique, the connection between two nodes represents the data transfer. But unlike of the majority of the tools which are based on the workflow paradigm, Tanagra is very simplified. The treatments are represented in a tree diagram. The results are displayed in a HTML format. So it is easy to export the outputs in order to visualize the results in a browser. It is also possible to copy the result tables to a spreadsheet.

Tanagra makes a good compromise between the statistical approaches (e.g. parametric and nonparametric statistical tests), the multivariate analysis methods (e.g. factor analysis, correspondence analysis, cluster analysis, regression) and the machine learning techniques (e.g. neural network, support vector machine, decision trees, random forest).

'''''The Mysterious Universe''''' is a [[popular science]] book by the British astrophysicist [[Sir James Jeans]], first published in 1930 by the [[Cambridge University Press]]. In the United States, it was published by [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan]].

The book is an expanded version of the [[Rede Lecture]] delivered at the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1930.&lt;ref name="jeans1938"&gt;Sir James Jeans 1938 (reprint of 1931 edition of 1930 book): ''The Mysterious Universe'', vii.&lt;/ref&gt; It begins with a full-page citation of the famous passage in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Republic]]'', Book VII, laying out the [[allegory of the cave]]. The book made frequent reference to the [[Old quantum theory|quantum theory]] of [[radiation]], begun by [[Max Planck]] in 1900, to [[Einstein]]'s [[general relativity]], and to the new theories of [[quantum mechanics]] of [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]] and [[Schrödinger]], of whose philosophical perplexities the author seemed well aware.

The book was denounced by the Cambridge philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], because "Jeans has written a book called ''The Mysterious Universe'' and I loathe it and call it misleading. Take the title...I might say that the title ''The Mysterious Universe'' includes a kind of idol worship, the idol being Science and the Scientist."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ray Monk|Monk, Ray]]. ''Wittgenstein: The Duty of Genius''. Jonathan Cape Ltd; London. 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

A second edition appeared in 1931. The book was reprinted 15 times between 1930 and 1938 and in September 2007 ({{ISBN|978-0548451168}}).

== Contents ==
* Foreword
* The Dying Sun
* The New World of Modern Physics
* Matter and Radiation
* Relativity and the Ether
* Into the Deep Waters
* Index

There are two pages of photographic plates:
* "The Depths of Space," taken with the [[Mount Wilson observatory]];
* "The Diffraction of Light and of Electrons," bearing out the wave nature of [[electron]]s and [[proton]]s predicted by [[Old quantum theory|quantum theory]].

The US edition has woodcut illustrations by the painter [[Walter Tandy Murch]].

It was derived from the earlier [[Vostok-L]]; however, it featured uprated engines to improve performance, and enlarge its payload capacity.&lt;ref name="EA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/soyuz.htm|title=Soyuz|last=Wade|first=Mark|publisher=Encyclopedia Astronautica|accessdate=2009-04-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5mqiUXlX2?url=http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/soyuz.htm|archivedate=2010-01-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a member of the [[R-7 (rocket family)|R-7]] family of rockets.

The Vostok-K made its maiden flight on 22 December 1960, three weeks after the retirement of the Vostok-L. The third stage engine failed 425 seconds after launch, and the payload, a [[Korabl'-Sputnik]] spacecraft, failed to reach orbit. The spacecraft was recovered after landing, and the two [[dog]]s aboard the spacecraft survived the flight.

On 12 April 1961, a Vostok-K rocket was used to launch [[Vostok 1]], the first [[human spaceflight|manned spaceflight]], which made [[Yuri Gagarin]] the first human to fly in space. All six manned missions of the [[Vostok programme]] were launched using Vostok-K rockets. The first two Zenit reconnaissance satellites were also launched with the Vostok-K, but it was soon replaced in that capacity with the uprated 8A92 booster. After the conclusion of the Vostok program, there were two remaining 8K72Ks left; these were used to launch four Elektron scientific satellites on January 30 and July 10, 1964.&lt;ref name="JSR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/lvdb/launch/R-7|title=R-7|work=Orbital and Suborbital Launch Database|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|accessdate=2009-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The book is an "anthropology of science" that explores the dualistic distinction [[modernity]] makes between [[nature]] and [[society]]. [[Pre-modern]] peoples, argues Latour, made no such division. Contemporary matters  of public concern such as [[global warming]], the [[HIV/AIDS pandemic]] and emerging [[biotechnologies]] mix politics, science, popular and specialist discourse to such a degree that a tidy nature/culture dualism is no longer possible. This inconsistency has given rise to [[post-modern]] and [[Anarcho-primitivism|anti-modern]] movements&lt;!--NOTE: the link to "Anarcho-primitivism" is only a rough and far from ideal fit to Latour's conception of "anti-modernism". Insert a better one if you can--&gt;. Latour attempts to reconnect the social and natural worlds by arguing that the modernist distinction between nature and culture never existed. He claims we must rework our thinking to conceive of a "Parliament of Things" wherein [[natural phenomena]], [[social phenomena]] and the [[discourse]] about them are not seen as separate objects to be studied by [[experts|specialist]]s, but as [[wikt:hybrid|hybrids]] made and scrutinized by the public interaction of people, things and concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

'''''Wholeness and the Implicate Order''''' is a book by theoretical physicist [[David Bohm]]. It was originally published 1980 by [[Routledge]], Great Britain.

The book is considered a basic reference for Bohm's concepts of undivided wholeness and of [[implicate and explicate order according to David Bohm|implicate and explicate orders]], as well as of Bohm's rheomode - an experimental language based on verbs. The book is cited, for example, by philosopher [[Steven M. Rosen]] in his book ''The Self-evolving Cosmos'',&lt;ref name="Rosen2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven M.
