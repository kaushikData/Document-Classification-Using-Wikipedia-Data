'''111 Murray Street''' (formerly known as '''101 Murray Street''' or '''101 Tribeca''') is a residential skyscraper completed in 2018 developed by [[Steve Witkoff|Witkoff Group]] and [[Fisher Brothers]] located at the intersection of [[Battery Park City]], [[the Financial District]], and [[Tribeca]] in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]].

==Overview==
According to Winston C. Fisher, of Fisher Brothers, the building has 156 luxury condominiums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marino|first1=Vivian|title=A Conversation With Winston C.

==Construction==
[[File:111 Murray 14 October 2016.png|thumb|left|200px|Construction progress in October 2016.]]
The tower was constructed at the site of the former [[St. John's University (New York City)|St. John's University]] building, at 101 Murray Street. In May 2015, the developers finalized the project's financing after securing additional funding from a Chinese insurance company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Putzier|first1=Konrad|title=Chinese insurer is funding Witkoff’s 111 Murray|url=http://therealdeal.com/blog/2015/05/22/chinese-insurer-is-funding-witkoffs-111-murray/|website=The Real Deal|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By Summer 2015, demolition of the previous structure was complete and construction of the foundation commenced. The building topped out in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Look: 111 Murray|url=http://tribecacitizen.com/2015/06/11/first-look-the-full-monty-on-111-murray/|website=Tribeca Citizen|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Mushimba, who was the brother of President [[Sam Nujoma]]'s wife, [[Kovambo Nujoma]], was involved in the liberation struggle beginning in the early 1960s. As the national organiser for [[SWAPO]] inside the country, he was arrested and tortured several times by the [[apartheid]] authorities in the mid-1970s. In 1975 he was arrested in connection with the assassination of Ndonga Chief Filemon Elifas, the Chief Minister of the tribal [[Ovamboland|Ovambo]] Executive. Mushimba was sentenced to death but released on appeal in 1977 after it was found that the defense had leaked documents to the prosecution in his original trial. After his release he left for exile, where he acted as a 'fixer' for SWAPO, particularly concerning money matters. During the 1980s he was Deputy Treasurer on the SWAPO Politburo. His political track record and the fact that he was Nujoma's brother-in-law did not prevent him being detained by SWAPO in the late 1980s.

With independence, Mushimba played a dominant role in a number of business initiatives ranging from fishing through banking to construction. Several made newspaper headlines in the 1990s. He was chairman of Stocks and Stocks Namibia when the company built the [[Windhoek Country Club and Resort]]. The hotel's construction fell so far behind schedule that its launch event, the [[Miss Universe 1995|Miss Universe pageant of 1995]], had to be held with the complex only part-completed. By the end of the decade, the government owned the hotel after Stocks and Stocks failed to pay its debts. Stocks and Stocks also won contracts worth over N$300 million to build government office buildings in the 1990s. The government granted Mushimba's mining company, PE Minerals, the mineral rights for the [[Rosh Pinah mine|Rosh Pinah zinc mine]] in 1995. Following three years of uncertainty over the future of the mine, [[PE Minerals]] signed a partnership deal with the mine owners, [[Mittal Steel South Africa|Iscor]], at the end of 1998. Another company that Mushimba heads, Namibian Harvest Investments, bought the majority share in the struggling City Savings and Investment Bank in 2001.

Mushimba was reported to be acting as the representative of international diamond trader [[Maurice Tempelsman]], who in 2002 offered the government an interest free loan in return for keeping [[De Beers]]'exclusive marketing contract for NamDeb's diamonds. He has also emerged as a key player in Epia Investments, the empowerment company formed by Ohlthaver and List, the owners of [[Namibia Breweries Limited|Namibia Breweries]]. Mushimba has played a key role in several of Namibia's largest black empowerment deals.&lt;ref name="NID"/&gt;

Mushimba died on 31 August 2014 in a Cape Town hospital where he had been hospitalised for three weeks previous. According to his daughter Ujama, Mushimba was admitted for a back surgery, but suffered complications after the operation . He was 67.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

==History==
[[File:SF Call, 1897-09-06, page 10.png|thumb|left|upright|Illustration of the unveiling ceremony, from the ''San Francisco Call'']]
The work was commissioned from Douglas Tilden by Mayor [[James D. Phelan]], who paid the $12,000 cost of the monument.&lt;ref name=LAH-970906 /&gt; The monument was announced in November 1895 as "an opportunity [for the public to drink] 'al fresco' in artistic surroundings such as have hitherto been unknown in the far West."&lt;ref name=SFC-951116&gt;{{cite news |url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=SFC18951116.2.138 |title=To Ornament the City |author= |date=16 November 1895 |newspaper=San Francisco Call |volume=78 |number=169 |accessdate=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Phelan formally presented the monument in a letter to the Board of Supervisors on February 8, 1896.&lt;ref name=SFC-960209 /&gt;&lt;ref name=PhelanFount /&gt; Although the Board was inclined to accept during a meeting on February 17, they asked Phelan for more details, and he responded with three photographs on February 21, and then by filing plans and specifications on February 27. The Board referred the matter to the Committee on Streets, who recommended acceptance at the next Board meeting on March 2. The Board accepted the recommendation and filed Resolution No. 13,902 formally accepting the gift from Phelan and naming it the '''''Phelan Fountain'''''.&lt;ref name=PhelanFount /&gt;

The monument was unveiled on September 5, 1897&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marketstreetassociation.org/hidden-treasures|title=Hidden Treasures|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Market Street Association|access-date=|accessdate=September 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; at Market, Turk and Mason Streets, and dedicated to the [[Native Sons of the Golden West]]&lt;ref name=LAH-970906&gt;{{cite news |url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=LAH18970906.2.4 |title=A Handsome Fountain |author= |date=6 September 1897 |newspaper=Los Angeles Herald |accessdate=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Historic Spots in California|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2002|isbn=9780804778176|location=|pages=358 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AYMPR6xAj50C&amp;pg=PA358 |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; on September 9, 1897.&lt;ref name=PhelanFount&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hIe3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA391#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=San Francisco Municipal Reports for the Fiscal Year 1896–97, Ending June 30, 1897 |chapter=The Phelan Fountain |pages=391–393 |author= |date=1897 |publisher=The Hinton Printing Company |location=San Francisco, California |accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mayor Phelan insisted that no display, speeches, or parade should accompany the presentation ceremony, and presented the monument to [[T.

In 1948 it was moved to Golden Gate Park, and in 1977 returned to Market Street at its present location, on the initiative of the Native Sons.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Design==
[[File:SF Call, 1896-02-09, page 14.png|thumb|right|upright|Tilden's design sketch for ''Admission Day'']]
When initially installed, the monument rested on a square foundation {{convert|15|ft}} on a side and {{convert|10|ft}} deep, and had three steps up to a central stone pedestal bearing engraved panels, topped by a [[doric column]] and the bronze sculptures. The three steps totaled {{convert|1.5|ft}} from ground level. From the top step, the top of the pedestal was {{convert|6|ft}} tall; the pillar added another {{convert|18.5|ft}}, and the bronze atop the pedestal is {{convert|9|ft}}, so the overall height of the monument was {{convert|35|ft}}.&lt;ref name=PhelanFount/&gt; When the monument was reinstalled at Market and Montgomery in the 1970s, the square foundation and steps were not restored, making the overall height of the monument now {{convert|33.5|ft}}.

The lower bronze sculpture depicts a miner who is waving an American flag and carrying a gun.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FkVQx6MWa8MC&amp;pg=RA1-PR3&amp;q=%22gun-toting%20miner%22#v=snippet|title=An Architectural Guidebook to San Francisco and the Bay Area|last=Cerny|first=Susan Dinkelspiel|date=2017-05-03|publisher=Gibbs Smith|isbn=9781586854324|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the original design, the miner represents the Youth of California or the Native Sons of the Golden West, waving his hat in his left hand and "cheering lustily in triumphant enthusiasm".&lt;ref name=SFC-951116 /&gt;&lt;ref name=SFC-960209&gt;{{cite news |url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=SFC18960209.2.140 |title=Phelan Makes a Princely Gift |author= |date=9 February 1896 |newspaper=San Francisco Call |volume=79 |number=71 |accessdate=14 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the finished work, the Native Son is carrying the American flag on the left shoulder and has a miner's [[pickaxe]] slung on the other.&lt;ref name=SFC-970906&gt;{{cite news |url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=SFC18970906.2.123 |title=Beautiful Gift to the City |author= |date=6 September 1897 |newspaper=San Francisco Call |volume=82 |number=98 |accessdate=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PhelanFount/&gt;

Above him – atop the column – stands the Genius of California (modeled after the sculptor's wife) that blesses the union, standing on a bronze ball and holding an open book with the admission date of September 9, 1850 inscribed inside.&lt;ref name="Kaprielian" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=PhelanFount /&gt; According to the design concept, the marble column is {{convert|35|ft}} tall, and each figure is approximately {{convert|7|ft}} tall.&lt;ref name=SFC-960209 /&gt; A contemporary news account called the planned design "graceful, light and symmetrical; it has the effect of tapering toward the apex, and yet the effect appears to be entirely unstudied."&lt;ref name=SFC-951116 /&gt;

The column and base were designed by [[Willis Polk]].&lt;ref name="Kaprielian" /&gt; The pedestal features two bronze bear heads, with water issuing from their mouths.&lt;ref name=SFC-960209 /&gt; The bear heads are surrounded by rattlesnakes, symbolizing the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada mountains]] and "the attendant dangers of the wild Western life"; as originally installed, handles held between the bears' teeth could be pulled to release water from the heads of the snakes, where they would be caught in cups decorated with a buffalo motif for drinking.&lt;ref name=PhelanFount /&gt; The quote inscribed on the pedestal is from a speech by [[William H. Seward]] in the US Senate on March 11, 1850, arguing for the admission of California: "The perpetual unity of the Empire hangs on the decision of this day."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/williamhspeech00sewarich|title=Speech of William H.

==In media==
The Native Sons' monument met [[Lotta's Fountain]] in a fanciful 1898 children's story published by the ''San Francisco Call'' entitled "The Three Fountains". In the story, Sinbad and [[loblolly boy|the Lob-Lolly]] are touring San Francisco when Sinbad announces his thirst and the Lob-Lolly responds by calling Lotta's Fountain over to them. After it arrives, it is able to dispense "the best ice-cold soda water" for all the children until it starts to run low, whereupon it walks over to the Native Sons' monument to ask for help. The Native Sons' monument dispensed soda for the girls, and the boys were directed to the [[Temperance fountain|Cogswell Fountain]] (which stood at California and Market, but had been torn down in 1894 by an angry mob).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=SFC18930302.2.123 |title=His Soul Was Sad: Dr. Cogswell a Victim of Ingratitude |author= |date=2 March 1893 |newspaper=San Francisco Call |volume=73 |number=92 |accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=SFC18940103.2.110 |title=Image Breakers: Dr. Cogswell's Statue Overturned Under Shadow of Night By a Silent Gang of Hoodlum Miscreants |author= |date=3 January 1894 |newspaper=San Francisco Call |volume=75 |number=34 |accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cogswell Fountain also gave what was first thought to be soda water to the boys, but which turned out to be [[castor oil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=SFC18980522.2.173.59.1 |title=The Three Fountains |author=D.H.W. |date=22 May 1898 |newspaper=San Francisco Call |accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4659">'''Alfred Reingoldovich Kokh (Koch)''' ({{lang-ru|Альфред Рейнгольдович Кох}}, {{lang-de|Alfred Reingoldowitsch Koch}}, born February 28, 1961)  is a [[Russia]]n writer, mathematician-economist and businessman [[History of Germans in Russia and the Soviet Union|of German origin]].

==Career==
He served as a deputy prime minister under President [[Boris Yeltsin]] and was an ally of economic reformer [[Anatoly Chubais]], a chief architect of [[Privatization in Russia|Russia's privatization]]. On September 12, 1996, Kokh was appointed head of Russia's [[State Property Committee]], acting as Russia's privatization chief.  He left the position on August 13, 1997, after the privatization auctions (loans-for-shares).

In June 2000, Alfred Kokh became head of [[Gazprom-Media]], a subsidiary media holding of [[Gazprom]] (now a subsidiary holding of [[Gazprombank]]), and oversaw the gas giant's controversial takeover of [[NTV Russian TV channel|NTV]], an independent television company owned by [[Vladimir Gusinsky]]. He was succeeded by [[Boris Jordan]] in October 2001. He also served as head of the 2003 election campaign staff for the [[Union of Right Forces]], a pro-business, democratic party of young reformers including [[Yegor Gaidar]], [[Boris Nemtsov]] and [[Irina Khakamada]], the first woman to run for the Russian presidency.

He wrote the 2006 Russian best-seller, ''A Crate of Vodka'' (Ящик водки), a dialogue with journalist Igor Svinarenko about the twenty-year period that covered the last Soviet generation and the first, truly free Russian generation (1982, the [[Death and funeral of Leonid Brezhnev|death of Leonid Brezhnev]], to 2001, when [[9/11]] put an end to liberal politics).  The English translation appeared in spring 2009.

In 2008, he financed a scholarly point-by-point refutation of [[Holocaust denial]] materials.  ''Denial of the Denial'' (Отрицание отрицания), with [[Pavel Polian]], is the first book on the subject published in Russia.

Kokh is a frequent commentator in ''Medved'', a glossy Russian men's magazine, writing about history and travel.

Alfred Kokh is a Candidate of Economic Science from the St. Petersburg Mathematics and Economics Institute of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]. He funds an annual Russian prize in mathematics; he was a sponsor of the new monument in Moscow to [[Tsar Alexander II]], the leader who [[Emancipation reform of 1861|emancipated the serfs]] and [[Imperial Russian Army#Reforms|reformed the Russian army]].

Out of fear of persecution by the Russian authorities he fled to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/ukraine-russland-jagt-die-intellektuellen-aus-dem-land-a-990452.html#ref=rss&lt;/ref&gt; His daughter Olga is a stand-up comedian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/arts/comedian-olga-koch-on-living-through-crazy-chaos-in-russia-and-bringing-a-revolution-to-edinburgh-a3856406.html|title=Comedian Olga Koch says she feels like she's speaking for all Russians when she goes onstage|work=Evening Standard|access-date=2018-08-16|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brahim Zniber''' (1920–2016) was a Moroccan businessman. Through Diana Holding, he was the founder and the owner of [[Celliers de Meknès]], the largest wine producer in Morocco, and owned 85% of the country's wine production. From the 1970s onward, he expanded into fruit and poultry production, and [[Coca-Cola]] bottling plants.

==Early life==
Brahim Zniber was born in 1920 in [[Salé]], Morocco.&lt;ref name="forbesnsehedeath"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nsehe|first1=Mfonobong|title=Moroccan Multi-millionaire Brahim Zniber Dies at 96|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/mfonobongnsehe/2016/10/01/moroccan-multi-millionaire-brahim-zniber-dies-at-96/#59c279ac37f1|accessdate=October 2, 2016|work=Forbes|date=October 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in [[Sidi Kacem]], then known as Petit Jean.&lt;ref name="telquelobit"&gt;{{cite news|title=Le milliardaire Brahim Zniber s’est éteint|url=https://telquel.ma/2016/09/30/brahim-zniber-nest_1516709|accessdate=October 1, 2016|work=[[TelQuel]]|date=September 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, [[Taher Zniber]], was a cereal and wool merchant who was active in the [[Koutla]] political coalition.&lt;ref name="telquelobit"/&gt; He had five brothers and four sisters.&lt;ref name="telquelobit"/&gt;

Zniber studied [[arboriculture]] and [[viticulture]] remotely, taking courses at the Ecole universitaire de Paris.&lt;ref name="telquelobit"/&gt; While he was a student, he became a nationalist activist, serving under [[Mehdi Ben Barka]].&lt;ref name="telquelobit"/&gt; He hid in a remote location near Meknes to flee persecution.&lt;ref name="telquelobit"/&gt;

==Career==
Zniber began his career in wine-making in 1956, when he purchased 740 hectares in [[Ait Harz Allah]].&lt;ref name="telquelobit"/&gt; Meanwhile, he joined the board of directors of the regional chapter of the [[Crédit agricole du Maroc]].&lt;ref name="telquelobit"/&gt; By 1958, he founded the Union marocaine de l’agriculture, a trade organization for Moroccan agriculture.&lt;ref name="telquelobit"/&gt;

Zniber was granted 1,100 hectares by King [[Hassan II of Morocco|Hassan II]] in 1958, as French settlers were deprived of their landholdings in the wake of Morocco's independence.&lt;ref name="telquelobit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="decestv5monde"&gt;{{cite news|title=Décès du "premier vigneron" du Maroc, le millionnaire Brahim Zniber|url=http://information.tv5monde.com/en-continu/deces-du-premier-vigneron-du-maroc-le-millionnaire-brahim-zniber-131327|accessdate=October 1, 2016|work=TV5Monde|date=September 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ftmoroccosatlasmountainsseek"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lindsey|first1=Ursula|title=Morocco’s Atlas Mountains seek place on winemaking map|url=https://www.ft.com/content/0daacbf4-cb48-11e5-a8ef-ea66e967dd44|accessdate=October 1, 2016|work=Financial Times|date=March 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1964, he founded Samavin,&lt;ref name="telquelobit"/&gt; later known as Celliers de Meknès.&lt;ref name="decestv5monde"/&gt; He was responsible for the growth of the wine industry in the [[Meknès Prefecture]] and [[Benslimane Province]] from the 1960s onwards.&lt;ref name="bonte145"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bonte|first1=Marie|title=Ethiques et pratiques éthyliques en milieu urbain marocain|journal=Confluences Méditerranée|date=2011|volume=3|issue=78|pages=145–156|doi=10.3917/come.078.0145|url=http://www.cairn.info/article.php?ID_ARTICLE=COME_078_0145&amp;DocId=162800&amp;hits=771+770+710+709+|accessdate=October 1, 2016|via=[[Cairn.info]]|registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zniber served as a member of the [[House of Representatives (Morocco)|House of Representatives]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="telquelobit"/&gt; Meanwhile, he began to grow citrus fruits, apples, apricots, pears, almonds and pistachios.&lt;ref name="telquelobit"/&gt; He acquired a poultry factory in 1975.&lt;ref name="decestv5monde"/&gt; Six years later, in 1981, he acquired Ebertec, a wine production distribution company with two subsidiaries, Thalvin and MR. Renouvo.&lt;ref name="telquelobit"/&gt; Additionally, he invested in two bottling plants for [[Coca-Cola]], one in [[Tangier]] and the other one in [[Oujda]].&lt;ref name="telquelobit"/&gt; He founded Diana Holding in 1986.&lt;ref name="decestv5monde"/&gt;&lt;ref name="forbes5moroccanmultmillionaires"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nsehe|first1=Mfonobong|title=5 Moroccan Multi-Millionaires You Should Know|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/mfonobongnsehe/2014/05/03/5-moroccan-multi-millionaires-you-should-know/#3d88ec0371ef|accessdate=October 1, 2016|work=Forbes|date=March 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, he established the first "[[appellation d'origine contrôlée]]" in Morocco, known as Les Coteaux de L’Atlas.&lt;ref name="telquelobit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ftmoroccosatlasmountainsseek"/&gt;

By 2014, Zniber was the owner of 2,000 hectares of vineyards near Meknes through Celliers de Meknès, and he sold 35 million bottles every year, making him the largest wine producer in Morocco.&lt;ref name="forbes5moroccanmultmillionaires"/&gt; His flagship vineyard was [[Château Roslane]].&lt;ref name="ftmoroccosatlasmountainsseek"/&gt; His holding company, Diana Holding, had a payroll of 8,000 and annual sales of US$3 billion.&lt;ref name="forbes5moroccanmultmillionaires"/&gt; His investments included the production of [[olive oil]] under the brandname of [[CaracTerre]] and wine via Celliers de Meknès as well as "meat processing and commercial [[Plant nursery|nurseries]]".&lt;ref name="forbes5moroccanmultmillionaires"/&gt;

By 2016, Zniber owned 85% of Morocco's wine production,&lt;ref name="decestv5monde"/&gt; and 8,300 hectares.&lt;ref name="telquelobit"/&gt; Diana Holding was the seventh largest privately owned company in Morocco.&lt;ref name="decestv5monde"/&gt; His main competitor was [[Groupe Castel]].&lt;ref name="bonte145"/&gt;

==Personal life and death==
Zniber was married to [[Rita Maria Zniber]].&lt;ref name="forbesmideastthemostpowerful"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Most Powerful Arab Women 2015: #30 Rita Maria Zniber|url=http://www.forbesmiddleeast.com/en/lists/people/pname/rita-maria-zniber/pid/86381/|accessdate=October 1, 2016|work=Forbes Middle East|date=April 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had a son, [[Leyth Zniber]], who founded [[Eiréné]], an investment fund, in 2014.&lt;ref name="challengelanceunfonds"&gt;{{cite news|title=Leyth Zniber lance un fonds d’investissement|url=http://www.challenge.ma/leyth-zniber-lance-un-fonds-dinvestissement-27108/|accessdate=October 1, 2016|work=Challenge|date=May 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5428">{{citations|date=January 2018}}'''Business mathematics''' is [[mathematics]] used by [[Commerce|commercial]] enterprises to record and manage [[business operations]]. Commercial organizations use mathematics in [[accounting]], [[inventory management]], [[marketing]], sales [[forecasting]], and [[financial analysis]].  

Mathematics typically used in commerce includes [[elementary arithmetic]], elementary [[algebra]], [[statistics]] and [[probability]].  Business management can be done more effectively in some cases by use of more advanced mathematics such as [[calculus]], [[Matrix_(mathematics)#Basic_operations|matrix algebra]] and [[linear programming]].

==High school==
''Business mathematics, '' sometimes called ''commercial math''  or ''consumer math'', is a group of practical subjects used in [[commerce]] and everyday life. In schools, these subjects are often taught to students who are not planning a university education.  In the United States, they are typically offered in [[high schools]] and in schools that grant [[associate's degrees]]; elsewhere they may be included under [[Business studies]].  The emphasis in these courses is on computational skills and their practical application, with practical application being predominant. 

A (U.S.) business math course might include a review of [[elementary arithmetic]], including [[fractions]], [[decimals]], and [[percentages]]. Elementary [[algebra]] is often included as well, in the context of solving practical business problems. The practical applications typically include [[checking accounts]], [[discounts and allowances|price discounts]], [[markup (business)|markups and Markup]], [[payroll]] calculations, [[interest|simple and compound interest]], [[credit (finance)|consumer and business credit]], and [[mortgages]] and [[revenues]].

==University level==
===Undergraduate===
"Business Mathematics" comprises mathematics courses taken at an [[undergraduate]] level by [[Business education#Undergraduate education|business students]]. The two most common here are ''Business Calculus'' and ''[[Business Statistics]]''.  Programs often also cover matrix operations as above, and may include a separate module on [[time value of money|interest calculations]].

These courses are usually focused on problems from the business world, and the syllabus is adjusted correspondingly. Thus for example, whereas in a regular calculus course students would study [[trigonometric functions]], courses here would not typically cover this area. Correspondingly, these courses typically do not go into the same depth as standard courses in the mathematics or science fields.  (Although see [[Bachelor of Science in Business Administration]] and [[Bachelor of Business Science]].) 

Note that [[Bachelor of Economics|economics majors]], especially those planning to pursue  [[Master of Economics|graduate study in the field]], are encouraged to instead take regular calculus, as well as [[linear algebra]] and other advanced math courses, especially [[real analysis]]. Some programs (instead) include a module in "mathematics for economists", providing a bridge between the above "Business Mathematics" courses and [[mathematical economics]] and [[econometrics]].
[[Operations management]] (and [[management accounting]]) may similarly include supplementary coursework in relevant quantitative techniques, generally linear programming as above, as well as other optimization methods.

===Postgraduate===
[[Business_education#Postgraduate_education|At the postgraduate level]], ''generalist'' management and finance programs include quantitative topics which are foundational for the study in question - often exempting students with an appropriate background. These are usually "interest mathematics" and statistics, both at the above level. [[MBA]] programs often also include basic [[operations research]] (linear programming, as above) with the emphasis on practice, and may combine the topics as "quantitative analysis"; [[master of science in finance|MSF programs]] may similarly cover applied [[econometrics]].

More technical [[masters degree|Masters]] in these areas, such as those in [[management science]] and [[Master of Quantitative Finance|quantitative finance]], will entail a deeper, more theoretical study of operations research and econometrics, and extend to further advanced topics such as [[mathematical optimization]] and [[stochastic calculus]]. These programs do not include "Business mathematics" ''per se''.

Where [[mathematical economics]] is not required, [[Master of Economics|graduate economics programs]] often include "quantitative techniques", which covers (applied) [[linear algebra]] and [[multivariate calculus]], and may include the above topics; regardless, econometrics is usually a separate course, and is dealt with in depth.

{{Patent law}}
'''Business method patents''' are a class of patents which disclose and [[claim (patent)|claim]] new [[methods of doing business]].  This includes new types of [[electronic commerce|e-commerce]], insurance, banking and [[tax|tax compliance]] etc. Business method patents are a relatively new species of patent and there have been several reviews investigating the appropriateness of patenting business methods. Nonetheless, they have become important assets for both independent inventors and major corporations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070929091155/http://www.insurancenetworking.com/protected/article.cfm?articleId=3505 Rutkowski, T.

== Background ==
In general, [[invention]]s are eligible for patent protection if they pass the tests of [[patentability]]: [[patentable subject matter]], [[novelty (patent)|novelty]], [[inventive step and non-obviousness|inventive step or non-obviousness]], and [[industrial applicability]] (or [[utility (patent)|utility]]).

A business method may be defined as "a method of operating any aspect of an economic enterprise".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acip.gov.au/pdfs/ACIP_Final_Report_Review_of_Patenting_of_Business_Systems_Archived.pdf|title=REPORT ON A REVIEW OF THE PATENTING OF BUSINESS SYSTEMS|date=September 2003|publisher=ADVISORY COUNCIL ON INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY|accessdate=17 December 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160228215505/http://www.acip.gov.au/pdfs/ACIP_Final_Report_Review_of_Patenting_of_Business_Systems_Archived.pdf|archivedate=February 28, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===France===
[[File:Dousset 1792.png|thumb|right|First page of Dousset 1792 French patent for a tontine]]On January 7, 1791, France passed a patent law that stated that "Any new discovery or invention, in all types of industry, is owned by its author...".  Inventors paid a fee depending upon the desired term of the patent (5, 10, 15 years), filed a description of the invention and were granted a patent.  There was no preexamination.  Validity was determined in courts.  14 out of 48 of the initial patents were for financial inventions. In June 1792, for example, a patent was issued to inventor F. P. Dousset for a type of [[tontine]] in combination with a [[lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?pg=RA1-PA559&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=1900&amp;id=cEYFAAAAQAAJ&amp;as_brr=0#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Description des Machines et Procédés Specifies Dans Les Brévets D’Invention, De Perfectionnement et D’Importation, 1811 pp 544 et seq.]&lt;/ref&gt;  These patents raised concerns and were banned and declared invalid in an amendment to the law passed in 1792.

===Britain===
In Britain, a patent was issued in 1778 to John Knox for a “[p]lan for assurances on lives of persons from 10 to 80 years of age.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patentlyo.com/08-964bsunitedstates.pdf  Bilski v. Kappos, USPTO Brief for the Respondent, September 30, 2009, p30] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007123319/http://www.patentlyo.com/08-964bsunitedstates.pdf |date=October 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At this time in British law, patents could only be issued for manufactured objects, not manufacturing processes.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===United States===
{{update|section|date=September 2014}}
Patents have been granted in the United States on methods for doing business since the US patent system was established in 1790.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uspto.gov/web/menu/busmethp/index.html#origins “Automated Financial or Management Data Processing Methods (Business Methods)”] USPTO white paper’&lt;/ref&gt;  The first financial patent was granted on March 19, 1799, to Jacob Perkins of Massachusetts for an invention for "Detecting Counterfeit Notes." All details of Mr. Perkins' invention, which presumably was a device or process in the printing art, were lost in the great [[X-Patent#The 1836 fire|Patent Office fire of 1836]]. Its existence is only known from other sources.

[[Image:Lottery patent header.JPG|thumb|300px|Header from 1840 {{cite patent|US|1700}} on a new type of private lottery.]]
The first financial patent for which any detailed written description survives was to a printing method entitled "A Mode of Preventing Counterfeiting" granted to John Kneass on April 28, 1815.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uspto.gov/web/menu/busmethp/x2301.html Kneass, John, “A Mode of Preventing Counterfeiting”, US patent x2301]&lt;/ref&gt; The first fifty years of the U.S. Patent Office saw the granting of forty-one financial patents in the arts of bank notes (2 patents), bills of credit (1), bills of exchange (1), check blanks (4); detecting and preventing counterfeiting (10), coin counting (1), interest calculation tables (5), and lotteries (17).

On the other hand, cases such as ''Hotel Security Checking Co. v. Lorraine Co.'', 160 F. 467 (2d Cir. 1908), which held that a bookkeeping system to prevent embezzlement by waiters was unpatentable, were often read to imply a "business method exception", in which business methods are unpatentable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/patent/comments/96_1327.htm  | title=commentary on ''State Street Bank'' |author1=P. Jason Hadley |author2=Jung Hahm |author3=Tanya Harding |author4=Steven Lee |author5=Malcolm T. Meeks |author6=Richard Polidi | publisher=University of Cornell Law School}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another such case was ''Joseph E. Seagram &amp; Sons v. Marzell'', 180 F.2d 26 (D.C. Cir. 1950), in which the court held that a patent on “blind testing” whiskey blends for consumer preferences would be “a serious restraint upon the advance of science and industry” and therefore should be refused.

[[File:Growth in Business Method Patents.jpg|thumb|300px|A diagram showing the growth of business method patents]]

====The change in practice in the 1990s====
For many years, the USPTO took the position that "methods of doing business" were not patentable.  With the emergence in the 1980s and 1990s of patent applications on internet or computer enabled methods of doing commerce, however, USPTO found that it was no longer practical to determine if a particular computer implemented invention was a technological invention or a business invention.  Consequently, they took the position that examiners would not have to determine if a claimed invention was a method of doing business or not.  They would determine patentability based on the same statutory requirements as any other invention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.emory.edu/fedcircuit/july98/96-1327.wpd.html State Street Bank v. Signature Financial, decided July 23, 1998] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829183009/http://www.law.emory.edu/fedcircuit/july98/96-1327.wpd.html |date=August 29, 2008 }}, citing the then current [[Manual of Patent Examining Procedure|MPEP]] Sec. 706.03(a) (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bitlaw.com/source/mpep/2106.html |title=MPEP 2106 PATENT SUBJECT MATTER ELIGIBILITY |website=bitlaw.com  |date= |accessdate=27 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The subsequent allowance of patents on computer implemented methods for doing business was challenged in the 1998 ''[[State Street Bank v. Signature Financial Group]]'', (47 [[United States Patents Quarterly|USPQ]] 2d 1596 ([[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit|CAFC]] 1998)).  The court affirmed the position of the USPTO and rejected the theory that a "method of doing business" was excluded subject matter. The court further confirmed this principle with ''[[AT&amp;T Corp. v. Excel Communications, Inc.]]'', (50 USPQ 2d 1447 (Fed. Cir. 1999)).

The USPTO continued to require, however, that business method inventions must apply, involve, use or advance the "technological arts" in order to be patentable.  This was based on an unpublished decision of the U.S. [[Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences]], ''[[Ex Parte Bowman]]'', 61 USPQ2d 1665, 1671 (Bd Pat. App. &amp; Inter. 2001).  This requirement could be met by merely requiring that the invention be carried out on a computer.

====The reaction against business method patents after 2000====
In October 2005 the USPTO's own administrative judges overturned this position in a majority decision of the board in ''[[Ex Parte Lundgren]]'', Appeal No. 2003-2088 (BPAI 2005).  The board ruled that the "technological arts" requirement could not be sustained,&lt;ref&gt;[http://patentlaw.typepad.com/patent/2005/10/patent_board_el.html http://patentlaw.typepad.com/patent/2005/10/patent_board_el.html]&lt;/ref&gt; as no such requirement existed in law.

In light of Ex Parte Lundgren, the USPTO has issued interim guidelines for patent examiners to determine if a given claimed invention meets the statutory requirements of being a process, manufacture, composition of matter or machine (35 USC 101).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/dapp/opla/preognotice/guidelines101_20051026.pdf# |title=http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/dapp/opla/preognotice/guidelines101_20051026.pdf |access-date=October 29, 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051029223225/http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/dapp/opla/preognotice/guidelines101_20051026.pdf# |archive-date=October 29, 2005 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These guidelines assert that a process, including a process for doing business, must produce a concrete, useful and tangible result in order to be patentable.  It does not matter if the process is within the traditional technological arts or not.  A price for a financial product, for example, is considered to be a concrete useful and tangible result (see [[State Street Bank v. Signature Financial Group]]).

The USPTO has reasserted its position that literary works, compositions of music, compilations of data, legal documents (such as [[Insurance contract|insurance policies]]), and forms of energy (such as data packets transmitted over the Internet), are not considered "manufactures" and hence, by themselves, are not patentable.  Nonetheless, the USPTO has requested comments from the public on this position.

In 2006, Justice [[Anthony Kennedy|Kennedy]] of the [[United States Supreme Court|US Supreme Court]]  cast aspersions on business method patents when he commented that some of them were of "potential vagueness and suspect validity".  This was expressed in a [[concurring opinion]] to the case of ''[[eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C.]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C.]]'', 126 S. Ct. 1837 (2006), Kennedy, J., concurring, page 2&lt;/ref&gt;  There has been considerable speculation as to how this opinion might affect future business method patent litigation, particularly where a patent owner seeks an injunction to stop an infringer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patenthawk.com/blog/2006/05/injunction_mud.html “Injunction Mud” The Patent Prospector, May 16, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, three Justices (Breyer, J., joined by Stevens and Souter, JJ.) dissented from the dismissal of certiorari as improvidently granted in ''Laboratory Corp. of Am. Holdings v. Metabolite Labs., Inc.'',&lt;ref&gt;548 U.S. 124 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that ''State Street'' enunciated an erroneous legal test under which processes that the Supreme Court had held patent-ineligible would be held patent-eligible.

====The ''Bilski'' case - 2010====

In ''[[Bilski v. Kappos]]'', 561 U.S. 593 (2010), the Supreme Court held that the [[machine-or-transformation test]] is not the sole test for determining whether a claim comes within the "process" subject matter of the Patent Act and is thus patent eligible. Rather than being an exclusive test for eligibility, the machine-or-transformation test is "a useful and important clue, an investigative tool, for determining whether some claimed inventions are processes under §&amp;nbsp;101. With respect to the facts of the case before it, the Supreme Court affirmed the Federal Circuit's ''en banc'' rejection of an application for a patent on a method of stabilizing cost inputs in the energy industry by hedging price rises against decreases. The Court held that the investment strategy set forth in the application was an "abstract idea," making it ineligible under that exception to the general subject-matter areas listed in the Patent Act.

The Supreme Court's decision in ''Bilski v. Kappos'' affirmed but sharply qualified the Federal Circuit's 2008 ''en banc'' decision in ''[[In re Bilski]]''.&lt;ref&gt;545 F.3d 943 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (''en banc'').&lt;/ref&gt; The decision announced a "machine-or-transformation" test of patent eligibility that, if it had been accepted as the exclusive for process patents, would have made ineligible many business-method patents granted in the last decade. Although the Supreme Court rejected its exclusive use, the test is still important as a "useful and important clue" for determining patent eligibility of claimed process inventions. Under this test. first, processes that transform an article from one state or thing to another are patent eligible regardless of whether their use requires a machine. Processes involving transformation of abstract financial data, such as that claimed in machine format in ''State Street'', are probably patent ineligible. Second, processes that do not make patent-eligible transformations are patent eligible only if they are claimed to be carried out with a “particular machine.” It appears that a programmed general-purpose digital computer is not a ''particular machine'', for this purpose. It is unclear from ''Bilski'' whether a particular machine must be novel and nonobvious, and specially adapted for carrying out the new process.  The Supreme Court’s decision in ''[[Parker v. Flook]]''&lt;ref&gt;437 U.S. 584 (1978).&lt;/ref&gt; seems to call for that, but the ''Bilski'' court did not choose to opine on this point at that time.&lt;ref&gt;The two-branch test is based on the decisions of the Supreme Court in its patent-eligibility trilogy some three decades ago – ''[[Gottschalk v. Benson]]'', 409 U.S. 63 (1972); ''Parker v. Flook'', 437 U.S. 584 (1978); and ''Diamond v. Diehr'', 450 U.S. 175 (1981).&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority opinion in ''[[In re Bilski]]'' refused to hold business methods categorically ineligible on any ground. Judge Mayer's dissent, however, seconded by Judges Dyk's and Linn's concurring opinion, insisted that the US patent system is limited to technology and therefore it excludes trade and business expedients. Judge Mayer equated the US Constitution's limitation of patent grants to the "useful arts"&lt;ref&gt;Article I, section 8, clause 8 of the Constitution Gives Congress the power “To promote the Progress of…useful Arts” by granting patents. The Supreme Court has held that the grant of power is also a limitation on congressional power. [[Graham v. John Deere Co.]], 383 U.S. 1, 5–6 (1966).&lt;/ref&gt; to a limitation to technology, relying on [[case law]] stating that technology is the modern equivalent of useful arts.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Malla Pollack, ''The Multiple Unconstitutionality of Business Method Patents'', 28 Rutgers Computer &amp; Tech. L.J. 61, 96 (2002; Micro Law, "What Kinds of Computer-Software-Related Advances (if Any) Are Eligible for Patents? Part II: The Useful Arts Requirement," IEEE MICRO (Sept.-Oct. 2008) (available at http://docs.law.gwu.edu/facweb/claw/KindsElg-II.pdf and http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4659278&amp;isnumber=4659262.pdf ).&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2007, the United States [[Internal Revenue Service]] proposed rules that would require tax filers who paid a license fee for a [[tax patent]] to declare that to the IRS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=IRS-2007-0112-0001   IRS Patent Transactions Rule Changes, Federal Register / Vol. 72, No. 186 / Wednesday, September 26, 2007 / Proposed Rules 54615]&lt;/ref&gt;

====The ''Alice'' case - 2014====

Several years later, in ''[[Alice v. CLS Bank]]'', the Supreme Court readdressed the patent eligibility of a business method. It held patent ineligible a method of securing intermediated settlement—a form of electronic escrow. In invalidating Alice's patent, the Court announced a two-step test based on the Court's earlier decisions in ''[[Mayo v. Prometheus]]'' and ''[[Funk Bros. Seed Co. v. Kalo Inoculant Co.]]'' This test first determines whether the claimed invention is directed to an abstract idea, law of nature, mathematical formula, or similar abstraction, If it is, the court is to proceed to the second step—determining whether the way the claimed invention implements the abstraction contains an inventive concept, as contrasted with being routine and conventional. Under the ''Alice'' test, the claimed invention is patent eligible only if it contains an inventive concept.

The USPTO business method examining work groups responded quickly to the Alice decision.  Allowances per month for patents related to finance dropped to 10% of their pre Alice value.&lt;ref&gt;[https://issuu.com/cipa-journal/docs/cipa-2017-07-july-august-2017?e=2508290 Mark Nowotarski “Surviving Alice in the Finance Arts", CIPA Journal, July/August 2017 p 20 -23]&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Patent Trial and Appeal Board]] has reacted in a similar manner.  Only about 20% of the appealed business method rejections by patent examiners are getting reversed by the board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bilskiblog.com/blog/2017/09/surviving-alice-with-an-appeal.html Mark Nowotarski, "Surviving Alice with an Appeal", Bilski Blog, 21 September 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Jurisdictions ==

Whether a business method is regarded as patentable subject matter depends on the legal [[jurisdiction]]. The [[World Trade Organization]]’s [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] (TRIPS) does not specifically address business method patents.

=== Australia ===

There is no general prohibition on the patentability of business methods in Australia. Their patentability is determined by applying the tests used to determine the patentability of any type of invention. However, in the decision of ''Grant v Commissioner of Patents'' [2006] FCAFC 120, at paragraph [47], the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia held that a business method will only be patentable if it has a physical aspect, being a concrete, tangible, physical, or observable effect or phenomenon. Accordingly, 'pure' business methods, being those that do not have a physical aspect, are not patentable in Australia.

It has been suggested that ''Grant v Commissioner of Patents'' was wrongly decided because the court failed to properly apply the existing law as set out in the decision of the High Court of Australia in ''[[National Research Development Corporation v Commissioner of Patents (1959) 102 CLR 252]]'' and that the court should not have imposed a physical aspect requirement.&lt;ref&gt;Ben McEniery, ‘Patents for Intangible Inventions in Australia After Grant v Commissioner of Patents (Part 1)’ (2007) 13(2) Computer and Telecommunications Law Review 70; [http://eprints.qut.edu.au/archive/00007006/01/7006.pdf (Online eprints version)] and Ben McEniery, ‘Patents for Intangible Inventions in Australia After Grant v Commissioner of Patents (Part 2)’ (2007) 13(3) Computer and Telecommunications Law Review 100 [http://eprints.qut.edu.au/archive/00007444/01/7444.pdf (Online eprints version)].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
{{Main|Subject matter in patent law in Canada}}
A business method must be more than an abstract idea or theorem, otherwise it is not patentable in Canada.  In order to be patentable, the business method must have a practical application.

However, a business method that is an abstract idea does not become patentable merely because it has a practical application.  For example, a particular business method that is an abstract idea does not become patentable merely because it is programmed into a computer as an algorithm.  For a business method to be patentable, the algorithm cannot be the whole invention, but only one aspect of a novel combination.  See ''Amazon.com, Inc. v The Attorney General of Canada, 2011 FCA 328, November 24, 2011''&lt;ref&gt;[http://decisions.fca-caf.gc.ca/en/2011/2011fca328/2011fca328.pdf Amazon.com, Inc. v The Attorney General of Canada, 2011 FCA 328, November 24, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
{{Main|Patent law of the People's Republic of China}}
In April 2017, SIPO (i.e. the Chinese patent office) revised it's patent examination guidelines to allow the patenting of business methods provided the method had technical features.&lt;ref&gt;[https://issuu.com/cipa-journal/docs/cipa-2017-07-july-august-2017?e=2508290 Toby Mak, “SIPO update”, CIPA Journal, July/August 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brazil ===
According to Brazilian Patent Law 9279, "''commercial, accounting, financial, educational, advertising, raffling, and inspection schemes, plans, principles or methods''" are not considered to be inventions or Utility Models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/clea/en/text_html.jsp?lang%3DEN%26id%3D515 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007173417/http://www.wipo.int/clea/en/text_html.jsp?lang=en&amp;id=515 |archivedate=October 7, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European Patent Convention ===
Under the [[European Patent Convention]], "[s]chemes, rules and methods for (...) doing business" are not regarded as inventions and are not [[patentability|patentable]], "to the extent that a European patent application or European patent relates to such subject-matter or activities as such".&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|52|2)(c) and (3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, if the claimed subject-matter "specifies an apparatus or a technical process for carrying out at least some part of the scheme, that scheme and the apparatus or process have to be examined as a whole."&lt;ref&gt;{{EPO Guidelines|g|ii|3|5}}: "Schemes, rules and methods for performing mental acts, playing games or doing business".&lt;/ref&gt; In such a case, the claimed subject-matter is considered to be of a technical nature and is not barred from patentability under {{EPC Article|52|2)(c) and (3}}. It then has to be assessed, as a second step, whether the invention involves an inventive step, considering that the "features which do not contribute to the technical character of the invention cannot support the presence of an inventive step".&lt;ref&gt;{{EPO Guidelines|g|vii|5|4}}: "Claims comprising technical and non‑technical features".&lt;/ref&gt;

=== India ===
Per Chapter II, [https://web.archive.org/web/20150924035914/http://www.ipindia.nic.in/IPActs_Rules/updated_Version/sections/ps3.html Section 3], part (k) of the Indian Patent Act, business methods are not patentable per se. However they are patentable if a new method solves a "technical" problem and an apparatus/system is involved.

=== United States ===
Current US case law ''[[Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International]]'' (decided June 2014) requires that in order for a business method to be patentable, it must be “significantly more” than simply implementing a well-known business process on a computer.  The immediate response of the USPTO to this decision as of July 2014 has been to essentially stop allowing business method patents.  The key issue is that examiners do not yet have clear guidance as to what is allowable under the Alice decision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kilpatricktownsend.com/~/media/Files/articles/2014/Post-Alice%20Exam%20Stats%20In%20Software%20Art%20Units%20A%20Bleajer%20Road.ashx Kate Gaudry, Tomas Franklin, “Post-Alice Exam Stats In Software Art Units: A Bleaker Road”, Law360 3 October 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classification ==
In the 8th edition of the [[International Patent Classification]] (IPC), which entered into force on January 1, 2006, a special subclass has been created for business methods: "[http://www.wipo.int/ipcpub/#refresh=page&amp;symbol=G06Q G06Q]" (Data processing systems or methods, specially adapted for administrative, commercial, financial, managerial, supervisory or forecasting purposes). In the previous editions, business methods were classified in "G06F 17/60". This is purely a classification matter and will not change the patent laws however.

US patents describing methods of doing business that involve the use of a computer are [[United States Patent Classification|classified]] in Class 705 ("data processing: financial, business practice, management or cost/price determination"). Class 705 includes sub-categories for industries such as health care, insurance, electronic shopping, inventory management, accounting, and finance.

'''Charles Carroll''' (September 19, 1737 – November 14, 1832), known as  '''Charles Carroll of Carrollton''' or '''Charles Carroll III''' to distinguish him from his similarly-named relatives,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/declaration/bio5.htm|title=Signers of the Declaration: Biographical Sketches: Charles Carroll|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2012-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a wealthy [[Maryland]] planter and an early advocate of independence from the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and one of the signers of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|American Declaration of Independence]].  He is sometimes referred to as one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Father]]s of the [[United States of America]], although he was not involved in framing the [[United States Constitution]]. He served as a delegate to the [[Continental Congress]] and [[Confederation Congress]] and later as first [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] for Maryland. He was the sole [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/americancatholic24philuoft#page/n189/mode/2up ''"Charles Carroll, of Carrollton,"''] The American Catholic Quarterly Review, Vol. XXIV, 1899.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carroll was known contemporaneously as the "First Citizen" of the American Colonies, a consequence of his editorials in the ''Maryland Gazette''[citation needed]. Carroll was the wealthiest, the longest-lived survivor, and possessed the highest formal education of all of the signers of the Declaration of Independence. A product of his 17-year [[Jesuit]] education in France, Carroll spoke five languages fluently.

Born in [[Annapolis, Maryland]], Carroll inherited vast agricultural estates and was regarded as the wealthiest man in the American colonies when the American Revolution commenced in 1775. His personal fortune at this time was reputed to be 2,100,000 pounds sterling; the equivalent of $465,000,000 in USD in 2018. In addition, Carroll presided over his manor in Maryland; a 10,000 acre estate that included approximately 1,000 African slaves whom he later freed. Though barred from holding office in Maryland due to his religion, Carroll emerged as a leader of the state's movement for independence. He was a delegate to the [[Annapolis Convention (1774–1776)|Annapolis Convention]] and was selected as a delegate to the Continental Congress in 1776. He was part of an unsuccessful diplomatic mission that Congress sent to [[Canada]] in hopes of winning the support of [[French Canadians]].

Carroll served in the [[Maryland Senate]] from 1781 to 1800. He was elected as one of Maryland's inaugural representatives in the United States Senate, but resigned from the United States Senate in 1792 after Maryland passed a law barring individuals from simultaneously serving in state and federal office. After retiring from public office, he helped establish the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]]. He was the longest-lived and last surviving signatory of the Declaration of Independence, dying 56 years after the document was signed.

==Ancestry==
[[File:Coat of Arms of Charles Carroll of Carrollton.svg|175px|thumb|left|Coat of Arms of Charles Carroll]]
The [[Carroll family]] were descendants of the Ó Cearbhaill lords of [[Éile]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rootsweb.com/~irlkik/ihm/thomond.htm#ely|title=Ireland's History in Maps - Tuadmumu, Kingdom of Thomond|date=25 October 2003|work=rootsweb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Lords of Ely) in King's County (now [[County Offaly]]), [[Ireland]].  Carroll's grandfather was the Irish-born [[Charles Carroll the Settler]] (1660–1720) from [[Litterluna]]; he was a descendant of Daniel O'Carroll of Aghagurty Clareen, three miles south of Kinnitty, and a clerk in the office of [[William Herbert, 1st Marquess of Powis|Lord Powis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com/people/pc/Charles_Carroll.html|title=Charles Carroll, Signer of Declaration of Independence|work=adherents.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carroll left his native Ireland (King's County) around the year 1659,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colonialhall.com/carroll/carroll.php|title=Biography of Charles Carroll of Carrollton, page 1 - Colonial Hall|work=colonialhall.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and emigrated to [[St. Mary's City]], capital of the colony of Maryland, in 1689,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charlescarrollhouse.com/|title=www.charlescarrollhouse.com|work=charlescarrollhouse.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a commission as Attorney General from the colony's Catholic proprietor, [[Charles Calvert, 3rd Baron Baltimore]].

Charles Carroll the Settler was the son of Daniel O'Carroll of Litterluna. The "O'" in Irish surnames was often dropped due to the Anglicisation policy of the occupying English, particularly during the period of the "[[Penal Laws]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Fry| first = Peter |author2=Fiona Somerset Fry | title = A History of Ireland| publisher = Routledge| year = 1991 | isbn = 978-0-415-04888-0 | page = 170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Carroll the Settler had a son, born in 1702 and also named Charles. To distinguish himself from his father he was known as [[Charles Carroll of Annapolis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faculty.fairfield.edu/faculty/hodgson/Courses/City/philadelphia/PHILADELPHIA_ih.html#chapter%2029|title=History of Independence Hall (1859)|work=fairfield.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
[[File:Doughoregan.jpg|thumb|right|[[Doughoregan Manor]], the Carroll family seat, now a [[National Historic Landmark]]]]
Carroll was born on September 19, 1737, in [[Annapolis, Maryland]], the only child of Charles Carroll of Annapolis (1702–1782) and Elizabeth Brooke (1709–1761). He was born illegitimate, as his parents were not married at the time of his birth, for technical reasons to do with the inheritance of the [[Carroll family]] estates. They eventually married in 1757.&lt;ref name="McClanahan, p.199"/&gt;

The young Carroll was educated at a [[Jesuit]] preparatory school known as Bohemia Manor in [[Cecil County]] on Maryland's [[Eastern Shore of Maryland|Eastern Shore]].&lt;ref name="McClanahan, p.199"/&gt; At the age of eleven, he was sent to France where he continued in Jesuit schools; first at the [[College of St. Omer]], and later the [[Lycée Louis-le-Grand]] (Louis the Great College) in Paris, graduating in 1755. He continued his studies in Europe, and read for the law in [[London]] before returning to Annapolis in 1765.&lt;ref name="McClanahan, p.199"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maier"&gt;Maier, Pauline. ''The Old Revolutionaries'' (1980), {{ISBN|0-394-51096-8}}/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Carroll of Annapolis granted [[Carrollton Manor]] to his son, Charles Carroll of Carrollton. It is from this tract of land that he took his title, "Charles Carroll of Carrollton". Like his father, Carroll was a Roman Catholic, and as a consequence was barred by Maryland statute from entering politics, practicing law and voting.&lt;ref name="McClanahan, p.199"/&gt; This did not prevent him from becoming one of the wealthiest men in Maryland (or indeed anywhere in the Colonies),&lt;ref name="McClanahan, p.199"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Q2BQUXkctagC&amp;pg=PA199 McClanahan, Brion T., p.199, ''The Politically Incorrect Guide to the Founding Fathers''].

==American Revolution==

===Voice for independence===
[[Image:PeggyStewart.jpg|thumb|right|The burning of the ''[[Peggy Stewart (ship)|Peggy Stewart]]'' at the Annapolis Tea Party, October 19, 1774]]
Carroll was not initially interested in politics&lt;ref name="McClanahan, p.199"/&gt; and in any event Catholics had been barred from holding office in Maryland since the 1704 Act seeking "to prevent the growth of Popery in this Province".&lt;ref name="roarke"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6ybHa6D24qQC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=henry+darnall&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=fcKDS_qNIKjoygTH_rnxCg&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q=henry%20darnall&amp;f=false Roark, Elisabeth Louise, p.78, Artists of colonial America] Retrieved August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; But, as the dispute between [[Great Britain]] and her colonies intensified in the early 1770s, Carroll became a powerful voice for independence. In 1772 he engaged in a debate conducted through anonymous newspaper letters, maintaining the right of the colonies to control their own taxation. Writing in the ''[[Maryland Gazette]]'' under the pseudonym "First Citizen," he became a prominent spokesman against the governor's proclamation increasing legal fees to state officers and Protestant clergy. Opposing Carroll in these written debates and writing as "Antillon" was [[Daniel Dulany the Younger]], a noted lawyer and [[loyalist (American Revolution)|loyalist]] politician.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=mMSafBl5V2QC&amp;pg=PA247&amp;dq=carroll+dulany+tax&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=tdrOTObLGoKMswar_ZyoAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=carroll%20dulany%20tax&amp;f=false Williamson, Claude, p.247, ''Great Catholics'', Williamson Press (March 15, 2007)].

D., p. 215, ''The Founders of Anne Arundel and Howard Counties, Maryland'']. Retrieved November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In these debates, Carroll argued that the government of [[Maryland]] had long been the monopoly of four families, the Ogles, the Taskers, the Bladens and the Dulanys, with Dulany taking the contrary view.&lt;ref name="Warfield, p.215"/&gt; Eventually word spread of the true identity of the two combatants, and Carroll's fame and notoriety began to grow.&lt;ref name="McClanahan, p.203"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Q2BQUXkctagC&amp;pg=PA199&amp;dq=charles+carroll&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZADTTLzKNoPwsgaOtfHyDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=charles%20carroll&amp;f=false McClanahan, Brion T., p.203, ''The Politically Incorrect Guide to the Founding Fathers'']. Retrieved November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Dulany soon resorted to highly personal ad hominem attacks on "First Citizen", and Carroll responded, in statesmanlike fashion, with considerable restraint, arguing that when Antillon engaged in "virulent invective and illiberal abuse, we may fairly presume, that arguments are either wanting, or that ignorance or incapacity know not how to apply them".&lt;ref name="McClanahan, p.203"/&gt;

Following these written debates, Carroll became a leading opponent of British rule, and served on various committees of correspondence.&lt;ref name=aoc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aoc.gov/cc/art/nsh/carroll.cfm|title=Charles Carroll|website=aoc.gov|publisher=Architect of the Capitol|date=October 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also played an important role in the burning in [[Annapolis]] harbor of the ''[[Peggy Stewart (ship)|Peggy Stewart]]'', a ship which had been carrying tea to Maryland, and was destroyed on October 19, 1774 as part of the [[Peggy Stewart (ship)|tea party]] protests against British excise duties enacted by the [[British Parliament|Parliament]] in the "[[Tea Act]]".{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}&lt;!--Need a better reference. McClanahan's book incorrectly relates details of the Peggy Stewart affair.--&gt; The day of the burning is commemorated in Maryland by a state holiday and historical event commemorating the [[American Revolution]], known as "Peggy Stewart Day" on October 19.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

In the early 1770s Carroll appears to have embraced the idea that only violence could break the impasse with Great Britain. According to legend, Carroll and [[Samuel Chase]] (who would also later sign the Declaration of Independence on Maryland's behalf) had the following exchange:
:Chase: "We have the better of our opponents; we have completely written them down."
:Carroll: "And do you think that writing will settle the question between us?"
:Chase: "To be sure, what else can we resort to?"
:Carroll: "The bayonet. Our arguments will only raise the feelings of the people to that pitch, when open war will be looked to as the arbiter of the dispute."&lt;ref name="McClanahan, p.204"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Q2BQUXkctagC&amp;pg=PA204&amp;dq=enforcement+of+marylands+boycott+of+british+teat+and+other&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Ew7UTKqRKoGWswaKhMjsBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false McClanahan, Brion T., p.204, ''The Politically Incorrect Guide to the Founding Fathers'']. Retrieved November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maryland representative===
Beginning with his election to Maryland's [[committee of correspondence]] in 1774, Carroll represented the colony in most of the pre-revolutionary groups. He became a member of Annapolis' first [[Committee of Safety (American Revolution)|Committee of Safety]] in 1775. Carroll was a delegate to the [[Annapolis Convention (1774–1776)]], which functioned as Maryland's revolutionary government before the Declaration of Independence. In 1776, he was selected as a delegate to the Continental Congress.&lt;ref name="Maier"/&gt;

In early 1776, the Congress sent him on a three-man diplomatic mission to [[Canada]], in order to seek assistance from French Canadians in the confrontation with Britain. Carroll was an excellent choice for such a mission, being fluent in French and a Roman Catholic, and therefore well suited to negotiations with the French-speaking Catholics of [[Quebec]].&lt;ref name="McClanahan, p.204"/&gt; He was joined in the commission by [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Samuel Chase]] and his cousin [[John Carroll (bishop)|John Carroll]].&lt;ref name=aoc/&gt; The commission did not accomplish its mission, primarily because of the failure of the concurrent [[Invasion of Canada (1775)|Invasion of Canada]].

===Signatory of the Declaration of Independence===
Carroll was elected to the Continental Congress on July 4, 1776, and remained a delegate until 1778. He arrived too late to vote in favor of the [[Declaration of Independence (United States)|Declaration of Independence]], but was present to sign the official document that survives today. After both [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[John Adams]] died on July 4, 1826, Carroll became the last living signatory of the Declaration of Independence.

His signature reads "Charles Carroll of Carrollton", to distinguish him from his father "[[Charles Carroll of Annapolis]]", who was still living at that time, and several other [[Charles Carroll (disambiguation)|Charles Carroll]]s in Maryland, such as Charles Carroll, Barrister, or his son Charles Carroll, Jr., also known as Charles Carroll of Homewood. He is usually referred to this way by historians. At the time he was one of the richest men in America. Throughout his term in the [[Second Continental Congress]], he served on the board of war.

===Member of the U.S. Senate===
Carroll returned to Maryland in 1778 to assist in the formation of a state government. Carroll was re-elected to the [[Continental Congress]] in 1780, but he declined. He was elected to the [[Maryland State Senate]] in 1781 and served there continuously until 1800.

In November 1779 The [[Maryland House of Delegates]] moved to pass a bill confiscating the property of those who had sided with the Crown during the Revolution. Carroll opposed this measure, questioning the motives of those who pressed for confiscation and arguing that the measure was unjust. However, such moves to confiscate Tory property had much popular support and eventually, in 1780, the measure passed.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, Matthew Page, ''History of Maryland'', p. 374, Doubleday Doran &amp; Co, New York (1929)&lt;/ref&gt;

When the United States government was created, the Maryland legislature elected him to the first [[United States Senate]]. In 1792 Maryland passed a law that prohibited any man from serving in the state and national [[legislature]]s at the same time. Since he preferred to be in the Maryland Senate, he resigned from the U. S. Senate on November 30, 1792.

==Attitude toward slavery==
The Carroll family were slaveholders and Carroll was himself a substantial and wealthy planter. Carroll was opposed in principle to slavery, asking rhetorically: "Why keep alive the question of slavery? It is admitted by all to be a great evil."&lt;ref&gt;[http://quotes.practicalmanliness.com/author/charles-carroll/ Quotes by Carroll]. Retrieved November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; However, although he supported its gradual abolition, he did not free his own slaves.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=N_1rzB1plukC&amp;pg=PA214&amp;dq=charles+carroll+carrollton+slavery&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=charles%20carroll%20carrollton%20slavery&amp;f=false Miller, Randall M., and Wakelyn, Jon L., p.214, ''Catholics in the Old South: Essays on Church and Culture''] Mercer University Press (1983).

==Later life and legacy==

Carroll retired from public life in 1801. After Thomas Jefferson became president, he had great anxiety about political activity, and was not sympathetic to the [[War of 1812]]. He was elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]] in 1815.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlistc|title=MemberListC|work=American Antiquarian Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Carroll came out of retirement to help create the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] in 1827. In 1828 he commissioned the [[Phoenix Shot Tower]] and laid its corner stone, which was then the tallest building in the United States until the [[Washington Monument]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/baltimore/b29.htm|title=Baltimore Travel Itinerary-- Shot Tower|website=www.nps.gov|access-date=2016-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; His last public act, on July 4, 1828, was the laying of the "first stone" (cornerstone) of the railroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03379c.htm| title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Charles Carroll of Carrollton| author=J.E. Hagerty| accessdate=April 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1832, he was asked to appear at the first-ever [[Democratic National Convention|Democratic Party Convention]] but did not attend on account of poor health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://deadpresidentsdaily.blogspot.com/2007/05/may-21-1832-first-democratic-party.html| title=First Democratic Party Convention| author=Dees Stribling| accessdate=May 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carroll died on November 14, 1832, of an apparent heart attack at the age of 96, in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]]. He holds the distinction of being the oldest lived founding father. He had outlived the first five U.S presidents. His funeral took place at the Baltimore Cathedral (now known as the [[Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary]]), and he is buried in his [[Doughoregan Manor]] Chapel at [[Ellicott City, Maryland|Ellicott City, Maryland.]]

Carroll funded the building of what is known today as [[Homewood House]], a 140-acre (570,000&amp;nbsp;m²) estate in northern [[Baltimore, Maryland]] as a wedding gift to his son, Charles Jr., and Harriet Chew. Charles Jr. then oversaw the design and construction of the house, which began construction in 1801 and was mostly finished by 1808. Research shows that he incorporated suggestions from his wife. It took five years to build and cost $40,000, four times the budgeted expense. The house never fulfilled the family's expectations, as it did nothing to cure Charles Jr.'s idleness and [[alcoholism]], factors which led to the failure of the marriage by binding separation. Homewood was donated to [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 1876 and later became its main campus. Today, Johns Hopkins operates Homewood House as a museum, and its [[Federal-style architecture]] serves as the inspiration for Hopkins campus architecture.

The home of Carroll's son-in-law Richard Caton, [[Brooklandwood]] in [[Baltimore County, Maryland|Baltimore County]], was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{MHT url|id=70}}|title=Maryland Historical Trust|date=2008-10-05|work= National Register of Historic Places: Brooklandwood|publisher=Maryland Historical Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carroll is remembered in the third stanza of the state song ''[[Maryland, My Maryland]]''.

:Thou wilt not cower in the dust,
:Maryland! My Maryland!
:Thy beaming sword shall never rust,
:Maryland! My Maryland!
:Remember Carroll's sacred trust,
:Remember Howard's warlike thrust,–
:And all thy slumberers with the just,
:Maryland! My Maryland

[[Carroll County, Kentucky]] and its county seat, [[Carrollton, Kentucky|Carrollton]], are both named for him.  Also named for him are the [[Carroll Gardens]] [[neighborhood]] in [[Brooklyn]] and the [[Greater Carrollwood]] neighborhoods of [[Tampa]]; as well as the city of [[New Carrollton, Maryland]], home to [[Charles Carroll Middle School]], and the town of [[Carroll, New York]]. [[Carroll University]] in Waukesha, Wisconsin, is named in his honor.  In addition, Charles Carroll High School in the [[Port Richmond, Philadelphia|Port Richmond]] neighborhood of [[Philadelphia]] is named for Charles Carroll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://webgui.phila.k12.pa.us/schools/c/carroll/about-us/who-was-charles-carroll | title = Who was Charles Carroll - The School District of Philadelphia | accessdate = 2012-10-26 | author = Charles Carroll High School | work = Charles Carroll High School web site | publisher = School District of Philadelphia | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121009050504/http://webgui.phila.k12.pa.us/schools/c/carroll/about-us/who-was-charles-carroll | archivedate = 2012-10-09 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1876, the Centennial Exhibition held to commemorate the birth of the United States was held in Philadelphia. The Catholic Abstinence Union of America commissioned the [[Catholic Total Abstinence Union Fountain]] for the Centennial Exhibition which includes a statue of Charles Carroll.  The fountain was commissioned and created by sculptor Herman Kim to promote American morality and the centerpiece of the fountain was a statue of Moses.  The statue of Moses is the center of the fountain and there are four other statues that surround it. The other four statues, that make up the points of the Maltese Cross, are statues of Charles Carroll of Carrollton, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, [[Theobald Mathew (temperance reformer)|Father Matthew]], the Great Apostle of temperance, [[Commodore Barry|Commodore John Barry]], a distinguished officer of the American Revolution and father of the American Navy, and Archbishop [[John Carroll (bishop)|John Carroll]], the patriot priest of the American Revolution. The fountain is currently located in West Fairmount Park, Philadelphia at the intersection of Avenue of the Republic and States Drive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Catholic Total Abstinence Fountain of the 1876 Centennial Exhibition|url=http://www3.villanova.edu/centennial/fountain/abstinencepage.htm|website=villanova.edu|publisher=Villanova University|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323135917/http://www3.villanova.edu/centennial/fountain/abstinencepage.htm|archivedate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1903, the state of Maryland added a [[Charles Carroll (Brooks)|bronze statue of Charles Carroll of Carrollton]] to the [[United States Capitol]]'s [[National Statuary Hall Collection]]. It is located in the Crypt.&lt;ref name="aoc"/&gt;

In 1906 the [[University of Notre Dame]] constructed what is now known as Carroll Hall, a residence hall named after Charles Carroll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Carroll Hall|url=http://www3.nd.edu/~carroll/history.html|publisher=[[University of Notre Dame]]|accessdate=5 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225075048/http://nd.edu/~carroll/history.html#|archive-date=2011-02-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paca-Carroll House at [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]] is named for Carroll and his fellow signer of the Declaration of Independence, [[William Paca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Paca-Carroll House |url=http://hcap.artstor.org/cgi-bin/library?a=d&amp;d=p1634 |website=Historic Campus Architecture Project |publisher=The Council of Independent Colleges |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
[[File:Carroll arms cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Arms of Carroll of Maryland]]
Charles Carroll of Carrollton married Mary Darnall (1749-1782), known as Molly, on June 5, 1768. She was a granddaughter of [[Henry Darnall]] (Charles Carroll was a great grandson of Henry Darnall).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoffman|first=Ronald|year=2000|title=Princes of Ireland, Planters of Maryland: A Carroll Saga, 1500–1782. |chapter=Appendix 6. Genealogical Charts|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill|isbn=0-8078-5347-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had seven children before Molly died in 1782, but only three survived infancy:
* Mary Carroll (1770-1846), who married Richard Caton (1763-1845), an Englishman who became a [[Baltimore]] merchant. From 1820 to 1832, Carroll would winter with the Catons in Baltimore. Their daughters were:
** Marianne (Caton) Patterson (1788-1853), sister-in-law of [[Elizabeth Patterson Bonaparte]], and later married the British statesman [[Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley]] (1760-1842), who was the brother of the legendary military commander [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]], who was believed to have been previously Marianne's [[paramour]].
** Elizabeth Stafford-Jerningham (1790-1862), [[Baron Stafford|Baroness Stafford]],
** Louisa [[Hervey-Bathurst Baronets|Hervey-Bathurst]] (1793-1874) then [[Francis D'Arcy-Osborne, 7th Duke of Leeds|Louisa D'Arcy-Osborne, Duchess of Leeds]]
** Emily Caton (1794/5-1867), married [[John MacTavish (British Consul)|John McTavish]] (1788-1852), British Consul at Baltimore, and were parents of four children including Mary Wellesley McTavish (1826-1915), The Hon. Mrs [[George Howard, 6th Earl of Carlisle#Family|Henry George Howard]] (of the [[Earls of Carlisle]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Wake |first= Jehanne |title= Sisters of Fortune |publisher=  A Touchstone Book published by Simom &amp; Schuster | year= 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Charles Carroll Jr. (1775-1825) (sometimes known as Charles Carroll of [[Homewood Museum|Homewood]] because he oversaw its design and construction), married Harriet Chew (1775-1861) and lived in Philadelphia. Harriet was the daughter of [[Benjamin Chew]], the chief justice of [[Pennsylvania]], and her sister married [[John E. Howard|John Eager Howard]], who had served in the Senate with Charles Carroll of Carrollton. Charles Jr. reportedly consumed up to two quarts of brandy a day. This led to erratic behavior that resulted in his separation from Harriet.
* Catherine ("Kitty") Carroll (1778-1861), who married [[Robert Goodloe Harper]] (1765-1826), a lawyer and U.S. senator.

Today, Carroll's descendants continue to own [[Doughoregan Manor]], the largest parcel of land in [[Howard County, Maryland]], with over 1000 acres (4&amp;nbsp;km²) of valuable but historically preserved land in [[Ellicott City, Maryland]].

==Carroll's signature==
In the 1940s, newspaper journalist John Hix's syndicated comic ''[[Strange as It Seems]]'' published an interesting, but apocryphal, explanation for Charles Carroll's distinctive signature on the Declaration of Independence. Every member of the Continental Congress who signed this document automatically became a criminal, guilty of sedition against King [[George III]]. Carroll, because of his wealth, had more to lose than most of his companions. Some of the signators, such as [[Caesar Rodney]] and [[Button Gwinnett]], had unusual and distinctive names which would clearly identify them to the King; other signators, with more commonplace names, might hope to sign the Declaration without incriminating themselves.

According to Hix, when it was Carroll's turn to sign the Declaration of Independence, he rose, went to [[John Hancock]]'s desk where the document rested, signed his name "Charles Carroll" and returned to his seat. At this point another member of the Continental Congress, who was prejudiced against Carroll because of his Catholicism, commented that Carroll risked nothing in signing the document, as there must be many men named Charles Carroll in the colonies, and so the King would be unlikely to order Carroll's arrest without clear proof that he was the same Charles Carroll who had signed the Declaration. Carroll immediately returned to Hancock's desk, seized the pen again, and added "of Carrollton" to his name.

In fact, Carroll had been appending "of Carrollton" to his signature for over a decade, the earliest surviving example appearing at the end of a September 15, 1765, letter to his English friend William Gibson. Carrollton Manor was the name of a tract of more than twelve thousand acres in Frederick County, Maryland, which the Carroll family leased to tenant farmers.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, Ronald, Sally D. Mason and Eleanor S. Darcy, Eds. Dear Papa, Dear Charley: Vol. I, pp. 344, n. 2, 378, and 378, n. 9. Chapel Hill, NC. The University of North Carolina Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carroll in fiction==
Charles Carroll was portrayed by actor [[Terrence Currier]] in the 2004 film ''[[National Treasure (film)|National Treasure]]'' with [[Nicolas Cage]]. He is accurately described as the last living signatory of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. Although the film does not explicitly state it, it is implied that Carroll died in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people = Christopher Plummer (playing John Adams Gates) |date = 2004 | title = National Treasure | time = 00:01:54 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is inaccurately stated that Carroll was a [[Freemasonry|Mason]]; historians of freemasonry agree that there is no evidence that he was, though his son (also named Charles Carroll) is known to have been a member.&lt;ref name="10000.masons.AJ"&gt;{{cite book|

Unable to meet with Jackson in time, Carroll takes into his confidence his carriage driver, Thomas Gates, the great-great-great-great-grandfather of Nicolas Cage's character, Benjamin Franklin Gates. From Carroll, Thomas receives the last known clue to the Treasure of the [[Templar Knights]].

Carroll is mentioned in the movie [[Gone with the Wind (film)|''Gone with the Wind'']].

In [[loan agreement|lending agreements]], '''collateral''' is a [[Borrower|borrower's]] [[pledge (law)|pledge]] of specific [[property]] to a [[lender]], to [[Secured loan|secure]] repayment of a loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Garrett | first = Joan F. | authorlink = | title = Banks and Their Customers | publisher = Oceana Publications | location = Dobbs Ferry, NY | year = 1995 | url = | doi = | isbn = 0-379-11194-2 | page = 99}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = O'Sullivan | first = Arthur | authorlink = Arthur O'Sullivan (economist) | first2 = Steven M. | last2 = Sheffrin | title = Economics: Principles in Action | publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall | year = 2003 | location = Upper Saddle River, New Jersey 07458 | page = 513 | isbn = 0-13-063085-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collateral serves as a lender's protection against a borrower's [[default (finance)|default]] and so can be used to offset the loan if the borrower fails to pay the [[principal sum|principal]] and [[interest]] satisfactorily under the terms of the lending agreement.

The protection that collateral provides generally allows lenders to offer a lower [[interest rate]] on loans that have collateral compared to those without collateral because the [[credit risk|risk]] of loss to the lender is lower. The reduction in interest rate can be up to several percentage points, depending on the type and value of the collateral. For example, the interest rate (APR) on an unsecured loan is often much higher than on a [[secured loan]] or [[logbook loan]], as the risk for the lender is then increased.

If a borrower defaults on a loan (due to [[insolvency]] or another event), that borrower loses the property pledged as collateral, with the lender then becoming the owner of the property. In a typical [[mortgage loan]] transaction, for instance, the [[real estate]] being acquired with the help of the loan serves as collateral. If the buyer fails to repay the loan according to the mortgage agreement, the lender can use the [[legal process]] of [[foreclosure]] to obtain ownership of the real estate. A [[pawnbroker]] is a common example of a business that may accept a wide range of items as collateral.

The type of the collateral may be restricted based on the type of the loan (as is the case with auto loans and mortgages); it also can be flexible, such as in the case of collateral-based personal loans.

==Concept==
Collateral, especially within [[banking]], traditionally refers to [[Secured loan|secured lending]] (also known as [[asset-based lending]]). More-complex collateralization arrangements may be used to secure [[trade]] transactions (also known as ''capital market collateralization''). The former often presents unilateral obligations secured in the form of [[property]], [[surety]], [[guarantee]] or other collateral (originally denoted by the term ''security''), whereas the latter often presents bilateral obligations secured by more-liquid assets such as [[cash]] or [[security (finance)|securities]], often known as [[margin (finance)|margin]].

==Marketable collateral==
Marketable collateral is the exchange of [[financial assets]], such as stocks and bonds, for a loan between a financial institution and borrower. To be deemed marketable, assets must be capable of being sold under normal market conditions with reasonable promptness at current [[fair market value]]. For [[national banks]] to accept a borrower's loan proposal, collateral must be equal to or greater than 100% of the loan or credit extension amount. In the United States of America, the bank's total outstanding loans and credit extensions to one borrower may not exceed 15 percent of the bank's capital and surplus, plus an additional 10 percent of the bank's capital and surplus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/12/32.3|title=12 CFR 32.3 - Lending limits.|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reduction of collateral value is the primary risk when securing loans with marketable collateral. Financial institutions closely monitor the [[market value]] of any financial assets held as collateral and take appropriate action if the value subsequently declines below the predetermined maximum loan-to-value ratio. The permitted actions are generally specified in a loan agreement or margin agreement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3667">'''Dan David''' ({{lang-he|דן דוד}}; &amp;lrm;23 May 1929 – 6 September 2011) was a [[Romania]]n-born [[Israel|Israeli]] businessman and philanthropist.

==Biography==
Dan David was born to a [[Jewish]] family in [[Bucharest]], [[Romania]]. He joined a [[Zionist youth movement]] at the age of 16. After studying economics at university, he worked for Romanian television and became a press photographer. In 1958, his newspaper asked him to travel to [[West Germany]] on an assignment. When he requested an exit permit, he was accused of being a Zionist activist and was fired from his job.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/businessman-philanthropist-dan-david-dies-in-london-1.382965 Businessman-philanthropist Dan David dies in London] (dead link)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dnevnik''''' ({{lang-bg|Дневник}}) is a business-oriented [[Bulgaria]]n daily [[newspaper]], that is published Monday - Friday in [[Sofia]] since 2001. Until early 2005, it was printed in broadsheet format, the last Bulgarian daily to use the large format. It adopted a compact format after research in 2005 found that more than 50% of the readers would prefer a smaller, thicker paper. Dnevnik's main editorial line is that the state should intervene less, and that business should have more freedom. Like the influential business and politics weekly ''[[Capital (newspaper)|Capital]]'', it is published by Sofia-based [[Economedia]].

[[Germany|German]] publishing group [[Georg von Holtzbrinck Publishing Group]] was the owner of a 50 per cent stake in Economedia, but the Bulgarian owners of Economedia bought the shares back in November 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.sofiaecho.com/article/handelsblatt-exits-economedia-investor-structure/id_26449/catid_67 | title = Handelsblatt exits Economedia investor structure | work = [[The Sofia Echo]] November 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a print-run of between 12,000 and 15,000, Dnevnik claimed 6,000 paid subscribers, distributed between 2,000 and 5,000 copies free-of-charge and sold about 5,000 copies at newsstands, the publisher's figures showed, adding that each copy had about five readers. In November 2005, Dnevnik launched ''Morski Dnevnik'', a weekly supplement for Bulgaria's Black Sea region with each Friday's paper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economedia.bg/economedia.php?lang=en/ ''Main products'', Economedia corporate website. Undated].Accessed 12-09-2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dnevnik publishes daily web editions in Bulgarian and English and sends a daily summary of the day's top stories by email in either language to anyone who signs up for this free service. It also offers a Bulgarian-language [[RSS]] newsfeed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnevnik.bg/rss.php Dnevnik RSS sign-up page, 7 December 2007].Accessed 12-09-2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Owners and representatives ==
As per Bulgarian [https://web.archive.org/web/20100405074024/http://public.brra.bg/ Trade register] owners of the Dnevnik - Economedia are not disclosed as the company is a joint stock company per registration but directors and representatives are Ivo Georgiev Prokopiev, Philip Michailov Harmandzhiev and Galia Valentinova Prokopieva. Also legal representatives who are not shareholders are: Kostadin Dimitrov Georgiev and Neli Velkova Hristova. Share capital of the company is 6,379,957 BGN (€3.2 mln, or $4.4 mln). The company's liabilities include a drawn €1 mln loan from the Greek Alpha bank.

'''Downtown Wichita''' is the [[central business district]] of [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]], [[Kansas]], [[United States]]. The political and financial hub of the city, it is home to several of the area’s major landmarks and event venues including the [[Epic Center]], [[Century II Performing Arts &amp; Convention Center]], [[Intrust Bank Arena]], and the Old Town entertainment district.&lt;ref name=Dev/&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of Wichita, Kansas}}
[[File:Sedgwick co historical museum.jpg|left|thumb|Wichita's Old City Hall, now the Sedgwick County Historical Museum (2008)]]
In 1872, the community of Wichita opened a toll bridge on Douglas Avenue to [[Delano, Wichita, Kansas|Delano]] across the [[Arkansas River]], and the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]] opened a line through the city, triggering an economic boom. Local industries in banking, meat packing, and real estate emerged. A large warehouse district developed along the rail lines south from Central Avenue.&lt;ref name=OldTownHistory&gt;{{cite web | title = Oldtown History | publisher = OldtownWichita.com | url = http://www.oldtownwichita.com/oldtown-history | accessdate = 2017-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1870s, the intersection of Douglas Avenue and Main Street had become the downtown hub of local commerce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = History of Jews in Wichita | publisher = Mid-Kansas Jewish Federation | url = http://mkjf.org/joomla/index.php/about-us/16-history-of-jews-in-wichita | accessdate = 2017-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continued economic growth through the 1880s spurred further downtown development, including the completion of the Wichita City Building in 1892.  The building housed all city government offices, both the police and fire departments, and the city’s first public library.&lt;ref name=Museum&gt;{{cite web | title = About the Museum and its Building: Old City Hall | publisher = The Wichita-Sedgwick County Historical Museum | url = http://wichitahistory.org/our_building/ | accessdate = 2017-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the subsequent decades, a number of manufacturers constructed plants downtown, including the [[Coleman Company]] in 1901.&lt;ref name=OldTownHistory/&gt;

The Forum, Wichita’s convention center and primary event venue, opened downtown in 1911. It was built on the site of city co-founder Dutch Bill Greiffenstein’s homestead.&lt;ref name=CenturyII&gt;{{cite web | title = History of Century II | publisher = City of Wichita | url = http://www.century2.org/Pages/History.aspx | accessdate = 2017-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Orpheum Theatre (Wichita, Kansas)|Orpheum Theatre]] opened downtown in 1922 and became a popular venue on the [[vaudeville]] circuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Buchanan-Spachek | first = Johny | last2 = Salley | first2 = Paul | title = Orpheum Theatre | publisher = Cinema Treasures | url = http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/381 | accessdate = 2017-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1960s, sections of downtown had entered a period of decline. To commemorate the centennial of Wichita’s founding, the city razed The Forum and in its place built the [[Century II Performing Arts &amp; Convention Center]] which opened in 1969.&lt;ref name=CenturyII/&gt; The city government relocated to a new City Hall in 1975. In 1981, the former City Building reopened as the [[Wichita-Sedgwick County Historical Museum]].&lt;ref name=Museum/&gt; In 1987, construction finished downtown on the [[Epic Center]] office tower, the tallest building in the city and in the state of Kansas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Epic Center | publisher = Emporis | url = https://www.emporis.com/buildings/125730/epic-center-wichita-ks-usa | accessdate = 2017-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, the city initiated a redevelopment plan to revitalize Downtown Wichita.&lt;ref name=Redev&gt;{{cite web | title = Project Downtown History | publisher = Wichita Downtown Development Corporation | url = http://downtownwichita.org/development/project-downtown | accessdate = 2017-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the plan’s results was the redevelopment of the old warehouse district into Old Town, an entertainment district home to numerous restaurants and night clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Project Downtown: The Master Plan for Wichita | publisher = Wichita Downtown Development Corporation | date = November 2010 | page = 2.2 | url = http://downtownwichita.org/user/file/Project%20Downtown%20Adopted%20Plan.pdf | accessdate = 2017-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city implemented further development plans, including the construction of [[Intrust Bank Arena]], a new multi-purpose indoor arena which opened in 2010.&lt;ref name=Redev/&gt;

The '''Duval County Courthouse''' is the local [[courthouse]] for [[Duval County, Florida]]. It houses courtrooms and judges from the Duval County and [[Fourth Judicial Circuit Court of Florida|Fourth Judicial Circuit]] Courts. The new facility is located [[Downtown Jacksonville|Downtown]] [[Jacksonville, Florida]]; it was built starting in 2009 and opened in 2012.

Duval County was created on August 12, 1822 and was formerly part of [[St. Johns County]]. Although the county's area was huge, it took more than twenty years before the first courthouse was constructed during the 1840s. A second courthouse was constructed in 1886, but was burned in the [[Great Fire of 1901]]. The third courthouse was constructed in 1902 and closed in 1958. A new courthouse funded by the [[Better Jacksonville Plan]] was planned in 2000, but budget issues and rising costs delayed its construction until 2009.

==Previous courthouses==

&lt;/gallery&gt;
===First===
The first courthouse erected in Duval County was constructed of wood during the 1840s where Forsyth and Market Street intersect. It was burned to the ground during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].

===Second===
It took another twenty years before it was replaced with a brick building, constructed in 1886, which lasted until the [[Great Fire of 1901]], which destroyed most of downtown Jacksonville. After the fire, the courthouse was one of the first buildings reconstructed, across the street from the old one. The exterior brick walls of the old courthouse remained mostly intact and were utilized in the creation of a new armory building. That structure became part of the Lanier Building, which was demolished in 2003.

===Third===
Rutledge Holmes designed the 1902 courthouse, which had a stone exterior. The architect incorporated up to seven additional floors in the design, but the original building was never expanded. Instead, when additional space was required, an annex was added in 1914, nearly doubling the usable courthouse space.

===Fourth===
An architecturally modern courthouse was constructed on East Bay Street and dedicated in 1958, ten years before consolidation and at a time when the entire county's population was just over 450,000. During that same time, Jacksonville built the [[Haydon Burns Library]], [[Friendship Fountain]], [[Jacksonville Memorial Coliseum]], the current Courthouse Annex and the CSX Transportation Building, making the city, “thoroughly modern”. The 1902 courthouse was demolished; the 1914 annex was preserved and later expanded to include the site of the 1902 courthouse and still functions as a county office building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jud10.org/Courthouses/Duval/duval.html|title=Florida's 10th Judicial Circuit: Courthouses-Duval|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New courthouse==
The 2000 Census counted over three-quarters of a million people in Duval County, an increase of 67% since the prior courthouse opened. The Bay Street facility had been overcrowded for many years and additional space was desperately needed. State law required the local government to construct a new facility. Mayor [[John Delaney (mayor)|John Delaney]] proposed the [[Better Jacksonville Plan]], a $2.25 billion package of projects, including a new courthouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/050900/met_3016056.html|title=Mayor seeks $2.2 billion fix - Jacksonville.com|first=Steve Patterson and David|last=Bauerlein|website=jacksonville.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The referendum on the Better Jacksonville Plan passed on September 5, 2000, and planning for the courthouse commenced. Costs were estimated at $190 million, with another $20 million built into the budget for contingency. Construction was awarded to Cannon Design.

In 2003 Delaney left office and was succeeded by [[John Peyton (U.S. politician)|John Peyton]]. Construction continued under Cannon, but budget and size estimates fluctuated. Peyton stopped work on the courthouse complex on October 28, 2004, and fired Cannon and construction managers Skanska Dynamic Partners.&lt;ref name=AIR/&gt; At the time, the project had not broken ground, but project design, property acquisition, site work and utility relocation had been completed, at a cost of $64.3 million. Peyton's office cited rising construction costs as part of the reason for the budget deficit.&lt;ref&gt;http://origin.firstcoastnews.com/news/local/news-article.aspx?storyid=35492&amp;catid=3{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DuvalCountyCourthouse.JPG|thumb|The newly completed Duval County Courthouse]]
Peyton decided to throw out Cannon's original designs, including completed work, and proposed a new plan. The [[Jacksonville City Council]] approved increasing the courthouse budget to $263.5 million in 2006. The project was re-bid, and the team of Perry-McCall Construction and [[The Auchter Company]] were initially awarded the contract. When it was discovered that the Auchter Company had financial troubles, the contract was withdrawn. In an attempt to retain the contract, Perry-McCall and Auchter merged to form a new company, but Jacksonville's General Counsel rejected their plan because the new company had not bid on the project.&lt;ref name=SHOT&gt;[http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/072007/met_185696120.shtml "Design firm gets new shot at courthouse"] Florida Times-Union, July 20, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Second place bidder, Turner Construction Company, which partnered with Technical Construction Services Group and [[KBJ Architects]], was given an opportunity to negotiate a contract with the city in July 2007, by approval of the Competitive Sealed Proposal Evaluation Committee.&lt;ref name=SHOT /&gt; On November 16, 2007, the Courthouse Architectural Review Committee (CARC) convened to review the new options under consideration by the administration and voted 4-1 to pursue the mayor's recommendation to build one 800,000 square foot facility on the existing [[LaVilla]] site using the design from KBJ Architects. Turner Construction was chosen as contractor. Turner Construction is also company that built the [[Jacksonville Veterans Memorial Arena|Veteran's Memorial Arena]] in Jacksonville.

Based on that recommendation and after intensive study, the Jacksonville City Council approved a $350 million county courthouse complex in April, 2008 that was supported by Mayor Peyton and Chief Circuit Judge [[Donald Moran]]. The council also agreed that any proceeds from the sale of the current riverfront courthouse and the City Hall annex be used to pay for the increased costs of the new courthouse construction.&lt;ref&gt;Kormanik, Beth: [http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/042308/met_271204928.shtml "Courthouse project approved"] Florida Times-Union, April 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/042308/met_271204928.shtml|title=Courthouse project approved - Jacksonville.com|first=BETH|last=KORMANIK|website=jacksonville.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Employees' Provident Fund Organisation''' (abbreviated to '''EPFO'''), is an Organization tasked to assist the Central Board of Trustees, a statutory body formed by the Employees' Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 and is under the administrative control of the [[Ministry of Labour and Employment (India)|Ministry of Labour and Employment]], [[Government of India]].

EPFO assists the Central Board in administering a compulsory contributory Provident Fund Scheme, a Pension Scheme and an Insurance Scheme for the workforce engaged in the organized sector in India. It is also the nodal agency for implementing Bilateral Social Security Agreements with other countries on a reciprocal basis. The schemes cover Indian workers as well as International workers (for countries with which bilateral agreements have been signed. As of now 17 Social Security Agreements are operational).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epfindia.com/site_en/International_workers.php|title=EPFO -- International Workers|website=www.epfindia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the largest [[social security]] organisations in [[India]] in terms of the number of covered beneficiaries and the volume of financial transactions undertaken.&lt;ref name="EPFO About Us"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epfindia.gov.in/epfbrief.html |title=About Us |publisher=Employees' Provident Fund Organisation |date= |accessdate=5 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523145007/http://epfindia.gov.in/epfbrief.html |archivedate=23 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The EPFO's apex decision making body is the Central Board of Trustees (CBT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Press Trust of India|PTI]] |url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/personal-finance-news/interest-rate-on-public-provident-fund-cut-to-8-1-from-8-7/articleshow/51459583.cms |title=Interest rate on Public Provident Fund cut to 8.1% from 8.7%|publisher=''[[The Economic Times]]'' |date=18 March 2016 |accessdate=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the Scheme==
The question of providing for the future of industrial workers after their retirement or for their dependents, in the event of their premature death, engaged the attention of the Central Government for a long time. The first Provident Fund Act passed in 1925 for regulating the provident funds of some private concerns was limited in scope.  In 1929 the Royal Commission on Labour stressed the need for formulating schemes for instituting provident funds for industrial workers. In the Indian Labour Conference held in 1948, it was generally agreed that the introduction of a statutory provident fund scheme for industrial workers might be undertaken. To test such a scheme in a  restricted field the  Coal Mines Provident Fund Scheme was launched in 1948. The success of this Scheme led to the demand for its expansion to other industries.

Accordingly, close of the year 1951 witnessed the promulgation of the Employees' Provident Funds Ordinance.  The Ordinance promulgated on 15 November 1951 was replaced by the Employees' Provident Funds Act, 1952 which extended to the whole of India except Jammu and Kashmir. The  Employees' Provident Funds Scheme, 1952 framed under section 5 of the Act was brought into force by stages and was enforced in  its entirety by 1 November 1952.

==Provident Fund==
The Employees' Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 came into effect on 4 March 1952. Six industries namely Cigarettes, Electrical, mechanical or general engineering products, Iron and Steel, Paper and Textiles (made wholly or in part of cotton, wool or jute or silk, whether natural or artificial) came under implementation of the Act wef 1 November 1952 The organisation is administered by a Central Board of Trustees, composed of representatives of the Government of India, State governments, Employers and Employees. The board is chaired by the Union Labour Minister of India. The Chief Executive of the EPFO, the Central Provident Fund Commissioner, reports to the Union Labour Minister through the Secretary of Labour and Employment in the ministry. The headquarters of the organisation is in [[New Delhi]].

The [[Constitution of India]] under "Directive Principles of State Policy" provides that the State shall within the limits of its economic capacity make effective provision for securing the right to work, to education and to public assistance in cases of unemployment, old-age, sickness &amp; disablement and undeserved want. The EPF &amp; MP Act, 1952 was enacted by the [[Parliament of India]] and came into force with effect from 4 March 1952 as part of a series of legislative interventions  made in this direction. Presently, the following three schemes are in operation under the Act:
#  Employees' Provident Fund Scheme, 1952
#  Employees' Deposit Linked Insurance Scheme, 1976
#  Employees' Pension Scheme, 1995 (replacing the Employees' Family Pension Scheme, 1971)

Retirement fund body EPFO on 21 February 2018 lowered the rate of interest on employees provident fund to 8.55% for 2017-18,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nayaindia.com/business-news/epfo-declares-8-55-pc-interest-rate-for-2017-18.html|title=EPFO Declares 8.55% interest Rate for 2017-18|date=21 February 2018|work=Naya India}}&lt;/ref&gt; from 8.65%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/personal-finance-news/epfo-cuts-interest-rate-to-8-55-for-2017-18-from-8-65-for-2016-17/articleshow/63016770.cms|title=EPFO cuts interest rate to 8.55% for 2017-18 from 8.65% for 2016-17|date=22 February 2018|work=The Economic Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the previous fiscal.

==Appeals==
The orders of the Department can be appealed to Employees' Provident Fund Appellate Tribunal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epfindia.nic.in/EPFAT/epfat.htm |title=EPFAT : Introduction |publisher=Employees' Provident Fund Organisation |date= |accessdate=5 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508100917/http://www.epfindia.nic.in/EPFAT/epfat.htm |archivedate=8 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[New Delhi]] or at Bangalore if the employer is situated in states  of  Karnataka,  Tamil Nadu,  Kerala,  Andhra  Pradesh, 
Telangana, Goa and Union Territories of Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Puducherry. The Delhi Tribunal is located at Scope Tower, Laxmi Nagar-sss, New Delhi and is presided by Presiding Officer who is a member of Judicial Service and by a Registrar who is deputed from the other central government cadres.

==Structure==
The EPFO has the dual role of being the enforcement agency to oversee the implementation of the [http://biblehr.com/the-employees-provident-fund-and-miscellaneous-provisions-act-1952-epf-act/ EPF &amp; MP Act] and as a service provider for the covered beneficiaries throughout the country.

The Act is administered by Central Board of Trustees, EPF a Statutory Board constituted by the Central Government under Section 5A of the Act. The CBT, as the Board is informally called, consists of a Chairman, a Vice Chairman, 5 Central Government Representatives, 15 State Government Representatives, 10 Employees' Representatives, 10 Employers' Representatives with Central P.F Commissioner and the Member Secretary to the Board. The Executive Committee of the CBT is constituted from among the members of the CBT to assist the Central Board in discharge of its function related to Administrative matters.

The officials of the organization in the Cadre of Commissioners are appointed by the Central Board under Section 5D for efficient administration of the Act and Schemes. To this end, the Commissioners of the Organization are vested with vast powers under the statute conferring quasi-judicial authority for assessment of financial liability on the employer, search and seizure of records, levy of damages, attachment and auction of a defaulter's property, prosecution and arrest and detention of defaulters in civil prison etc.

Administratively, the organization is divided into zones which are headed by an Additional Central Provident Fund Commissioner. At present, there are 10 Zones across the country. Further below, the states have either one or more than one Regional Offices headed by Regional Provident Fund Commissioners (RPFC) (Grade I) which are again sub- divided into Sub-Regions headed by Regional Provident Fund Commissioners (Grade II). To assist them are Assistant Provident Fund Commissioners looking after the enforcement of the Act and Schemes. Many districts in the country have district offices where an assistant provident fund commissioner is stationed for implementation of the scheme and attend to grievances.

The total manpower of the EPFO is at present more than 20000 including all levels. The Commissioner cadre numbering 815 are recruited directly, competitively, through the Union Public Service Commission of India as well as through promotion from lower ranks. Subordinate Officers (Enforcement Officers/Accounts Officers) are also recruited directly in addition to promotion from the staff cadre of social security assistants.

==Universal Account Number==
'''UAN is Universal Account Number'''. The [http://uanlogin.in UAN] is a 12-digit  number allotted to employee who is contributing to EPF will be generated for each of the PF member by EPFO. For example, 111222333444. The UAN will act as an umbrella for the multiple Member Ids allotted to an individual by different establishments and also remains same through the lifetime of an employee. It does not change with the change in jobs. The idea is to link multiple Member Identification Numbers (Member Id) allotted to a single member under single Universal Account Number. This will help the member to view details of all the Member Identification Numbers (Member Id) linked to it.

The Major benefit of UAN or Universal Account Number will include easy tagging of multiple Employee's Provident Fund Member Id under a single number, thus reducing the confusion. The UAN will help in easy transfer and withdrawals of claims. Along with this services like Online Pass-Book, [[Short Message Service|SMS]] Services on each deposit of contribution and Online [[Know your customer|KYC]] Update can be provided on the basis of UAN number. Before that, you need to activate UAN &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pavzipost.com/uan-login-activation-epf-balance-statement-passbook-download/|title=UAN Login &amp; Activation EPF Balance Statement Passbook Download - Complete Guide about epfindia|author=|date=1 October 2018|website=pavzipost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; from EPFO portal.

==Longevity Risk==
In March 2018, Union Cabinet claimed that almost 84 million EPFO subscribers did not have birth dates and that father's name was missing in 110 million accounts.

Critics asserted that such excuses were turning common to cancel pension and other annuity schemes without any legal backlash, riot or even public debate. The underlying cause is believed to be unfunded or underfunded risk through longevity swap transactions.

'''Geoffrey Morgan Pike''' (who writes as '''Geoff Pike''' and '''Pai Kit Fai''') is an English-born, naturalized Australian writer and cartoonist.
==Early years==
Born in [[Tottenham, Middlesex]] on 17 October, 1929, to parents Mildred and Robert Pike, he has two siblings Anthony  J. Pike and Robert Pike.At age 14 he entered training on the Navy ship [[HMS Indefatigable (R10)|Indefatigable]], and went to sea in 1945 aged 15. In 1949, Pike emigrated to Australia where he worked in the outback breaking horses, felling trees and sailing aboard deep-sea trawlers before he signed on as an artistic director on many popular cartoons such as ''[[Beetle Bailey]]'' and ''[[Krazy Kat]]'' with American [[Paramount Studios]]. ''[[Unbearable Bear in T.V. Tours]]'', an animated cartoon series for [[Artransa Park Television]], featured a globe trotting [[koala]] with itchy feet.&lt;ref&gt;Geoff Pike, ''Unbearable Bear in Boy Meets Bear'' (Sungravure 1964), p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Pike worked with [[Bryce Courtenay]] at [[McCann Erickson]] advertising agency, most notably on the [[Mortein]] advertisement, "[[Louie the Fly]]". Bryce wrote the jingle and Geoff created the cartoon and animation. He also created the animation for the [[McWilliams]]' monk advertisement and the popular [[Yowie (chocolate)|Yowie]] characters featured in children's picture books and [[Cadbury's]] line of confectionery containing small plastic toys.

In 1977 Pike was diagnosed with throat cancer and learned the art of [[Chi Kung]] (also known as Quigong) and traditional Oriental medicine rather than surgery, beating cancer and becoming a master of Chi Kung and creating books and videos teaching others the philosophy and practice of aligning breath, physical activity and awareness for mental, spiritual and corporeal health.

==Writing==

In 1974 he published the first of many books, ''[[Henry Golightly: a novel of the sea]]''. Published by [[Angus and Robertson]], it was the story of a [[Gweilo]] (caucasian foreigner) living in [[Macau]] and building a boat amongst the locals; a youthful search for adventure and love among the post-war wreckage of 1945 and the horror that was [[Hiroshima]].

Pike now writes under the name Pai Kit Fai, which was given to him by his Chinese in-laws. Loosely translated, it means "White Person of Letters and Grand Ambition'. He has written two books under this [[nom de plume]], ''[[The Concubine's Daughter]]'' and ''[[Red Lotus]]''.

'''Juan Anacleto Araneta''' (July 13, 1852 – October 3, 1924), was a pioneer sugar farmer and revolutionary leader during the [[Negros Revolution]].

==Early life==
Juan was born to Romualdo Araneta and Agüeda Torres in Molo, [[Iloilo]], [[Philippines]]. The Aranetas later moved to [[Negros Island|Negros]] and settled there permanently.

At the age of 19, he was brought by his brother-in-law, Pedro Sarmiento, to [[Manila]] and was enrolled at the [[Ateneo de Manila University|Ateneo Municipal de Manila]]. He showed great promise in school, earning medals of merit for his endeavours. He graduated with a ''perito mercantil'' degree, equivalent to today's bachelor's degree in Commerce. His contemporaries in school included [[José Rizal]], [[Jose Alejandrino]], [[Cayetano Arellano]], and [[Apolinario Mabini]], among others.

Upon returning to Molo, he was elected ''Capitan del Pueblo'', like his father before him. The friars in the province, however, had become suspicious of him, and only the high regard and respect of the people of [[Bago City|Bago]] and the other towns in the province prevented his summary liquidation by the Spanish authorities.

In 1891, Juan went to [[Europe]] with his friend, Don Claudio Reina after his wife died. He had the opportunity to meet many of the Filipino leaders then living in [[Madrid]], [[London]] and [[Paris]]. As a consequence, the Spanish authorities were even more antagonistic toward him upon his return. As a result, he lost the land that he and his sisters inherited from their parents. He had to take his family to the slopes of [[Mt. Kanlaon]] where they started to farm anew. He brought many gadgets to his ''hacienda'' in Dinapalan. One popular tale was his use of a [[telescope]] to supervise his laborers in the vast hacienda from afar. It became a legend among the common people that he had magical powers, but in reality, he was only able to see their actions by using the telescope.

==Altercation with Spanish authorities==
His travels in Europe made him aware of the use of new machinery and tools for agriculture. He imported a sugar mill from [[England]] and had it installed in his [[hacienda]] in Dinapalan. From time to time, he bought farm implements like a baler for [[abaca]], a [[rice]] thresher, and plows of improved models.

This preference for modern agricultural tools, however, became his undoing. The Spanish authorities grew suspicious of the boatloads of cargo being unloaded near his land in Lumangub. He was arrested and brought to Concordia in January 1897. He was later brought to [[Himamaylan]] and then again to Ilog which was then the capital of the province. His diary hinted that even in prison, there were plans to organize the revolutionary forces in the province. There were annotations showing that he made contact with other leaders in the province. He was finally brought to [[Bacolod City|Bacolod]] where he was released in October 1897.

==The Negros Revolution==
{{main|Negros Revolution}}
On November 5, 1898, ([[Negros Revolution|Cinco de Noviembre]]) a messenger from [[Talisay City, Negros Occidental|Talisay]] brought news that the revolutionaries and the ''cazadores'' were already engaged in skirmishes. At about 1:00 in the afternoon, the revolutionary forces in Bago started marching toward Bacolod. They had only three firearms among them: a [[Remington Arms|Remington]] rifle, a [[Mauser]] rifle, and a [[shotgun]]. General Araneta, who led the rebel forces, told his men to cut [[Nypa fruticans|nipa]] stems or ''pagong'', and to shoulder these as if these were rifles. In case they contact with each other, the password was to be ''utod'' (brother) in [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]].

The Spanish authorities in Bacolod, who saw the rebels marching toward the town, thought that they wanted to surrender their arms. Surprised, the Spaniards were advised by the rebels to surrender in order to avert bloodshed. The Spaniards readily agreed. It was only when Bacolod was already in the hands of the rebels, that the Spanish reinforcements from Iloilo arrived.

The Spanish Governor of Negros Island, Don Isidro Castro, surrendered to forces under Aniceto Lacson and Juan Araneta at Bacolod on 6 Nov. 1898.&lt;ref name=Foreman&gt;Foreman, J., 1906, The Philippine Islands, A Political, Geographical, Ethnographical, Social and Commercial History of the Philippine Archipelago, New York: Charles Scribner's Sons&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|476}}

==The Republic of Negros==
:''See: [[Republic of Negros#History|Republic of Negros]]''
A cantonal form of government was set up in Bacolod with General Aniceto Lacson as President and General Juan Araneta serving as Secretary of War. When the Americans arrived in Iloilo, he counseled the cantonal government to submit to the American forces. This was vehemently opposed and ridiculed by his companions-in-arms. His idea was finally adopted, however, and the Americans occupied Negros without encountering hostilities.

==Later life==
In 1904, he was appointed as one of the commissioners to the [[Saint Louis Exposition (annual fair)|St. Louis Exposition]] where he put on exhibit over a thousand varieties of rice, samples of cacao, beans, abaca, and many other agricultural crops from [[Negros (island)|Negros]] and [[Panay]]. All these exhibits were of exceptional merit; as a result, he was awarded with gold and silver medallions. He also developed Buenos Aires Mountain Resort for his large family to use and enjoy. He later gave this property to his daughter Maria A. Matti.

He kept in touch with new developments in agriculture, either in tools and implements or crops. He tried to grow different crops on his farm and even planted trees that were not endemic to Negros. When the [[Ma-ao Sugar Central]] was organized, he became one of its founders. He lent to the corporation the titles of his land to back up the new enterprise. He prevailed upon his lessees to plant wide areas of land to sugar cane. Unfortunately, "Don Juan" did not live long enough to realize his dream of seeing the sugar central freed of its obligations. He died on October 3, 1924, leaving behind a large family of about 25 members.

A '''justice and public safety practitioner''' is an American [[civil service|public service]] job role.

The practitioner is a local, state, tribal or federal government employee who devotes his or her time to the practice of providing, administering or promoting justice and [[public safety]] services according to the laws, policies and practices of the government entity they serve.  They are mindful of national standards and codes of conduct and often are members of state or national organizations that seek to improve the efficiency, effectiveness and quality of their profession.

Practitioners historically are employed by agencies such as [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]], [[prosecutor]]s/[[district attorney]]s, the courts, jail and correctional institutions, supervised custody organizations and the technology organizations that support these agencies.

'''Józef Montwiłł''' {{lang-lt|Juozapas Montvila}} (9 March 1850 in [[:lt:Mitėniškiai (Kėdainiai)|Mitėniškiai]] (now [[Kėdainiai district]], [[Lithuania]]) – 7 February 1911) was a Polish-Lithuanian social worker, bank owner and [[philanthropist]], notable for the many social societies he founded. A descendant of a [[Lithuania]]n [[szlachta|noble]] family, Montwiłł inherited a significant fortune, which he further increased through banking and investment. He financed numerous courses for the poor, among them was a class of painting and arts, run by - among others - [[Józef Bałzukiewicz]] and [[Ivan Trutnev]], from which graduated a renowned Lithuanian artist [[Juozas Zikaras]]. 

In 1898 Montwiłł also financed a monument to [[Adam Mickiewicz]] in Vilnius, designed by [[Tadeusz Stryjeński]]. As the tsarist authorities did not allow the monument to be placed in open space, it was built inside the Saint John's Church. Montwiłł also created the ''Lutnia'' Artistic Society and financed the construction of the society's theatre, in currently [[Lithuanian National Drama Theatre]]. Among other societies he formed and financed was the Society of Friends of Sciences, one of the founding members of the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]]. 

Montwiłł also financed the creation of a Polish school in Vilnius (1907), a city hall in [[Panevėžys]]; built already after his death, and the Polish Theatre in Vilnius (in modern times converted to ''Russian Dramatic Theatre of Lithuania''). He died in 1911 and was buried at the [[Rasos cemetery|Rossa cemetery]] (Lithuanian: Rasos). His tomb, designed by [[Zygmunt Otto]], was decorated with a sculpture of an angel. Although vandalized in recent times, the tomb remains there. In 1935 a monument to Montwiłł was erected in front of the Franciscan Church. A monument in his honour was built in the square, located in the former Franciscan cemetery in the [[Trakai]] Street of Vilnius.

In modern times the Polish Culture in Lithuania Fund ({{Lang-pl|Fundacja Kultury Polskiej na Litwie im. Józefa Montwiłła}}) has adtoped Montwiłł as its patron.

'''Lee Jae-yong''' ({{lang|ko|이재용}}; born 23 June 1968), known professionally in the West as '''Jay Y. Lee''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-18/south-korea-court-denies-arrest-of-samsung-heir-jay-y-lee|title=A Chinese Court Rejects Arrest of Samsung Heir Jay Y. Lee|date=2017-01-18|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|access-date=2017-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[South Korea]]n business magnate and the [[vice chairman]] of [[Samsung Group]], serving as de facto head. He is the eldest child and only son of [[Hong Ra-hee]] and [[Lee Kun-hee]], Chairman of [[Samsung]], and is widely considered to be his father's future successor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-38997370|title=Samsung heir Lee Jae-yong arrested in South Korea|date=2017-02-17|publisher=BBC News|access-date=2017-08-07|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is referred to as the "Crown Prince of Samsung" by the South Korean media, and speaks Korean, English and Japanese.&lt;ref name="businessinsider.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/r-samsungs-crown-prince-in-focus-as-father-hospitalized-2014-13|title=All Eyes Are On Samsung's 'Crown Prince'}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee is estimated to be worth US$7.9 billion, making him the third wealthiest person in South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/jay-y-lee/|title=Jay Y. Lee|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-08-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Lee was named the world's 35th most powerful person and the most powerful Korean by [[Forbes Magazine's List of The World's Most Powerful People]] along with his father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/powerful-people/list/#tab:overall|title=The World's Most Powerful People}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==

Jae-yong was born in Seoul, South Korea to [[Lee Kun-hee]]. He received his [[B.A.]] in East Asian history from [[Seoul National University]],&lt;ref name="reuters.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-samsung-lee-newsmaker-idUSBRE8B40A220121205|title=Jay Lee, Samsung's unassuming heir apparent|date=5 December 2016|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his [[Master of Business Administration|M.B.A.]] from [[Keio University]]. He attended [[Harvard Business School]] for about five years in pursuit of a [[Doctor of Business Administration]] degree, but did not graduate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lee  |first1=Jungah  |last2=Clenfield |first2= Jason |date=26 August 2014|title=Samsung Low-Profile Heir Poised to Succeed Father Seen as a God |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-08-26/samsung-low-profile-heir-poised-to-succeed-father-seen-as-god- |publisher=[[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg L.P.]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career at Samsung==
Jae-yong started working for [[Samsung]] in 1991. He began serving as Vice President of Strategic Planning and then as "Chief Customer Officer", a management position created exclusively for Lee. His prospects for future company leadership dimmed when his father Kun-hee stepped down as Chairman due to [[tax evasion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://go.bloomberg.com/tech-blog/2012-12-05-how-samsung-is-developing-its-next-generation-leader/|title=Technology - Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2009, however, his succession prospects revived when Lee became the [[Chief Operating Officer]] of [[Samsung Electronics]]. Since December 2012, he has been [[Vice Chairman]] of Samsung. He is one of the main shareholders of Samsung's financial services subsidiary, owning 11 percent of [[Samsung SDS]].&lt;ref name="businessinsider.com"/&gt;

=== Court Appearances  ===
In January 2017, Lee was accused "of bribery, embezzlement and perjury" by the South Korean prosecutor's office,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21715037-investors-have-stayed-cool-despite-probe-samsung-lee-jae-yong-dodges-arrest-charges|title=Lee Jae-yong dodges arrest on charges of bribery|website=The Economist|access-date=2017-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and after an investigation, he was arrested on February 16, 2017. On August 25, 2017 Lee was sentenced to 5 years in prison after being found guilty of corruption. The appeals court suspended his sentence on February 5, 2018 and reduced it to 2.5 years, releasing him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/5/16972818/samsung-ceo-wins-bribery-appeal|title=Samsung heir Lee Jae-yong released from prison on appeal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The arrest of Jay Y. Lee was largely prompted by the investigation of the [[2016 South Korean political scandal|Choi Soon-sil scandal]], that could be traced back to the shift of the father-to-son ownership of Samsung in 2014. His involvement in bribery with the then-South Korean President was first brought to the table by an arrest warrant issued by the South Korea prosecutor's office in January, which led to his arrest in mid-February.{{cn|date=April 2017}} On January 12, 2017, the special prosecutor's office said it would decide "soon" whether to seek an [[arrest warrant]] for Lee. He was questioned for more than 22 hours for suspicion of illegal activities including [[bribery]] in a scandal that consumed president [[Park Geun-hye]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=South Korea prosecutor to decide 'soon' whether to seek arrest warrant for Samsung's Lee|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-southkorea-politics-samsung-group-war-idUSKBN14X07C?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=worldNews|accessdate=13 January 2017|agency=Reuters|date=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Corruption scandal ===

On January 16 2017, when the prosecutor's office finally decided to seek an arrest warrant for Lee,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=South Korea prosecutor seeks arrest of Samsung chief for bribery|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-southkorea-politics-idUSKBN150079|accessdate=16 January 2017|agency=Reuters|date=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pham|first1=Sherisse|title=South Korean prosecutors seek to arrest Samsung heir|url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/16/investing/samsung-heir-lee-jae-yong-arrest-warrant/index.html|accessdate=16 January 2017|work=CNNMoney|date=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the warrant was denied based on a court ruling from 19 January, with the Central District Court Justice Cho Eui-yeon stating that it was "difficult to recognize the need" for his incarceration.&lt;ref name="nyt-court"&gt;{{cite web|last1=SANG-HUN|first1=CHOE|title=In a Blow to Prosecutor, South Korean Court Blocks Arrest of Samsung Leader|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/18/world/asia/samsung-korea-president-impeachment.html|website=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=South Korean court dismisses arrest warrant for Samsung chief|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-southkorea-politics-samsung-lee-idUSKBN1522UY|accessdate=19 January 2017|agency=Reuters|date=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 February 2017, Lee was "formally arrested after the Seoul central district court issued a warrant on the night" of 16 February for "handing bribes worth almost £30m to then South Korean president [[Park Geun-hye]] and her close friend [[Choi Soon-sil]] to win government favours for a smooth leadership transition."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2017/02/16/south-korean-court-issues-warrant-arrest-samsung-heir/|title=Samsung heir Lee Jae-yong arrested amid bribery allegations|newspaper=The Telegraph|access-date=2017-02-17|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent to his arrest, [[Samsung]] admitted to making contributions to two non-profit foundations allegedly controlled by Choi and her [[Germany]]-based firm, but denied such contributions were related to the 2015 merger.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/all-you-wanted-to-know-about-the-arrest-of-samsung-heir-lee-jae-yong/what-samsungs-saying/slideshow/57232107.cms|title=What Samsung's saying - All you wanted to know about the arrest of Samsung heir Lee Jae-yong - The Economic Times|newspaper=The Economic Times|access-date=2017-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesman for Samsung said: “We will do our best to ensure that the truth is revealed in future court proceedings.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; On February 28, 2017, the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' reported that "South Korean prosecutors said they would indict the Samsung conglomerate’s de facto leader Lee Jae-yong on charges of bribery and four other offenses."&lt;ref name=samsung-bribery&gt;{{cite news |last=Martin |first=Timothy W.  |date=February 28, 2017 |title=Samsung Heir Lee Jae-yong to Be Indicted on Bribery Charges |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/samsung-heir-lee-jae-yong-indicted-on-bribery-charges-1488260531 | work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |location=New York City |access-date=February 27, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported on August 7, 2017, that prosecutors demanded a twelve-year sentence for Lee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/07/south-korea-prosecutors-demand-12-year-sentence-samsung-boss|title=South Korea prosecutors demand 12-year sentence for Samsung boss|last=McCurry|first=Justin|date=2017-08-07|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-08-07|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 25th, Lee Jae-yong was sentenced to 5 years in jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40847211|title=Prosecutors seek 12-year sentence for Samsung's Lee Jae-yong|date=2017-08-07|publisher=BBC News|access-date=2017-08-07|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; He will now be in prison pending a trial in the appellate court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/samsung-heir-sentenced-to-five-years-jail/ |date=25 August 2017 |publisher=ZDNet |access-date=26 August 2017 |title=Samsung heir sentenced to five years in jail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, Jay Y. Lee was freed from jail after a South Korean court suspended his five year jail term for bribing ex-president, Park Geun-hye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-42942466|title=Samsung heir freed from S Korea jail|publisher=BBC News|date=5 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has two younger sisters, Lee Boo-jin, Lee Seo-hyun, and was the older brother of the late [[Lee Yoon-hyung]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://chinese.joins.com/gb/article.do?method=detail&amp;art_id=130257&amp;category=001001 李在镕、李富真、李叙显今日将齐聚新上任高管晚宴].

'''Elizabeth Lloyd Holzman''', best known as '''Libby Holman''' (May 23, 1904 &amp;ndash; June 18, 1971), was an American singer and actress who also achieved notoriety for her complex and unconventional personal life.

==Early life==
Elizabeth Lloyd Holzman was born May 23, 1904, in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], the daughter of a lawyer and [[stockbroker]], Alfred Holzman (August 20, 1867 – June 14, 1947) and his wife, Rachel Florence Workum Holzman (October 17, 1873 – April 22, 1966). Her family was Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last = Boardman|first = Sam|title = Not Quite White: Sam Boardman Jacobs on the turbulent career of the torch singer - and political activist – Libby Holman|url = http://www.jewishquarterly.org/issuearchive/article5c9e.html?articleid=253|accessdate = 9 August 2012|year = Winter 2006|quote = Zach's family had always disapproved of Libby, and her Jewish ancestry was publicly known to play a large part in that disapproval.|work = Jewish Quarterly|issue = Number 204}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their other children were daughter Marion H. Holzman (January 25, 1901 – December 13, 1963) and son Alfred Paul Holzman (March 9, 1909 – April 19, 1992).

In 1904, the wealthy family grew destitute after Holman's uncle Ross Holzman embezzled nearly $1 million of their stock brokerage business. At some point, Alfred changed the family name from Holzman to Holman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,744163-2,00.html|title=At "Reynolda"| date=1932-08-15| publisher=''Time''| pages=2| accessdate=2009-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Libby graduated from [[Hughes Center High School (Cincinnati, Ohio)|Hughes High School]] on June 11, 1920, at the age of 16. She graduated from the [[University of Cincinnati]] on June 16, 1923, with a Bachelor of Arts degree. Holman later subtracted two years from her age, insisting she was born in 1906, the year she gave the [[Social Security Administration]] as the year of her birth.&lt;ref&gt;Social Security Death Index: [http://ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/ssdi.cgi SSN 073-14-3155 under the name "Elizabeth Schanker"], ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com; accessed December 23, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theatrical career==
In the summer of 1924, Holman left for [[New York City]], where she first lived at the Studio Club. Her first theater job in New York was in the road company of ''The Fool''. [[Channing Pollock (writer)|Channing Pollock]], the writer of ''The Fool'', recognized Holman's talents immediately and advised her to pursue a theatrical career. She followed Pollock's advice and soon became a star. An early stage colleague who became a longtime close friend was future film star [[Clifton Webb]], then a dancer. He gave her the nickname, "The Statue of Libby".

Her [[Broadway theatre]] debut was in the play ''The Sapphire Ring'' in 1925 at the [[American Airlines Theatre|Selwyn Theatre]], which closed after thirteen performances. She was billed as Elizabeth Holman. Her big break came while she was appearing with Clifton Webb and [[Fred Allen]] in the 1929 Broadway revue ''[[The Little Show]],'' in which she first sang the [[blues]] number, "[[Moanin' Low]]"  by [[Ralph Rainger]], which earned her a dozen [[curtain call]]s on opening night, drew raves from the critics and became her signature song.&lt;ref name=treetops&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/18/nyregion/treetops-an-aura-of-glamour-a-trail-of-tragedies.html Jack Cavanaugh, "Treetops: An Aura of Glamour, a Trail of Tragedies," May 18, 1997], accessed January 7, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Also in that show, she sang the [[Kay Swift]] and [[James Warburg|Paul James]] song, "[[Can't We Be Friends?]]"

The following year, Holman introduced the [[Howard Dietz]] and [[Arthur Schwartz]] standard "[[Something to Remember You By (1930 song)|Something to Remember You By]]" in the show ''Three's a Crowd'', which also starred Allen and Webb.&lt;ref&gt;Original sheet music for "Something to Remember You By" is inscribed with the subtitle "Introduced by Libby Holman."&lt;/ref&gt; Other Broadway appearances included ''The Garrick Gaieties'' (1925), ''Merry-Go-Round'' (1927), ''Rainbow'' (1928), ''Ned Wayburn's Gambols'' (1929), ''Revenge with Music'' (1934), ''You Never Know'' (1938, score by Cole Porter), during which production she had a strong rivalry with the tempestuous Mexican actress [[Lupe Vélez]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cinesilentemexicano.wordpress.com/category/actores-y-actrices-del-cine-silente/lupe-velez|title=Lupe Vélez/MEXICAN SILENT CINEMA|publisher=cinesilentemexicano.wordpress.com|accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and her self-produced one-woman revue ''Blues, Ballads and Sin-Songs'' (1954).

One of Holman's signature looks was the [[strapless dress]], which she has been credited with having invented,&lt;ref&gt;Scheper, Jeanne.

==Personal life==
Holman was married three times and had a variety of intimate relationships with both men and women.&lt;ref name="Odd Girls and Twilight Lovers"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Faderman |first1=Lillian |title=Odd girls and twilight lovers : a history of lesbian life in twentieth-century America |date=1991 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=0-231-07488-3 |page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her [[lesbian]] lovers included DuPont heiress [[Louisa d'Andelot Carpenter]], actress [[Jeanne Eagels]], and writer [[Jane Bowles]].&lt;ref name=site&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paulbowles.org/photosjanebowles.html |title=Jane Bowles, Libby Holman Reynolds and Barbara Hutton |work=The Authorized Paul Bowles Web Site |publisher=www.paulbowles.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carpenter was to play a significant part throughout Holman's lifetime. They raised their children and lived together and were openly accepted by their theater companions. She scandalized some by dating much younger men, such as American actor [[Montgomery Clift]], whom she mentored.&lt;ref name="Odd Girls and Twilight Lovers"/&gt;

Holman took an interest in one fan, [[Zachary Smith Reynolds]], the heir to the [[R. J. Reynolds]] tobacco company. He was smitten with her from the start despite being seven years younger. They met in Baltimore, Maryland in April 1930 after he saw her performed in ''The Little Show''. He asked his friend [[Dwight Deere Wiman]], the producer of the show, to introduce him to her. He pursued her  around the world in his plane.

With the persuasion of her former lover, Louisa d'Andelot Carpenter, Holman and Reynolds, who went by his middle name, married on November 29, 1931 in the parlor of a house in [[Monroe, Michigan]]. Reynolds wanted Holman to abandon her acting career. She took a one-year leave of absence. But his family was unable to bear Holman and her theater friends, who at her invitation often visited [[Reynolda House|Reynolda]], the family estate near [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina]]. Arguments were common.

===Death of Zachary Smith Reynolds===
At a party at [[Reynolda Gardens|Reynolda]] in 1932, Holman told her husband she was pregnant. The party was for Charles Gideon Hill Jr., a friend of Reynolds and a cousin of his first wife, Anne Ludlow Cannon Reynolds. A tense argument ensued. Moments later a shot was heard. Friends discovered Reynolds bleeding and unconscious with a gunshot wound to the head. Authorities ruled the shooting a suicide, but a coroner's inquiry ruled it murder. Holman and Albert Bailey "Ab" Walker, a friend of Reynolds and an alleged lover of Holman, were indicted for murder.

Carpenter paid Holman's $25,000 bail at the Rockingham County Courthouse in [[Wentworth, North Carolina]]. Holman wore a heavy veil and dark dress, and bystanders and reporters thought he was black or of mixed race. Fearing a scandal, the Reynolds family contacted the local authorities and had the charges dropped. On January 10, 1933, Holman gave birth to Christopher Smith "Topper" Reynolds.

Journalist [[Milt Machlin]] investigated the death of Reynolds and argued that he committed suicide. In his account Holman was a victim of the anti-Semitism of local authorities. The district attorney involved with the case later told Machlin that she was innocent.&lt;ref name="Machlin"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Machlin |first1=Milt |title=Libby |date=1980 |publisher=Tower Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=January 2011 }} A 1933 film, ''[[Sing, Sinner, Sing]]'', was loosely based on the allegations surrounding Reynolds' death.&lt;ref name="moans"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Sing, Sinner, Sing: Moans, Groans, and Murder on a Gambling Ship |journal=Newsweek |date=1933}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Determeyer |first=Eddy|title=Rhythm Is Our Business: Jimmie Lunceford and the Harlem Express |publisher=University of Michigan Press |year=2008 |page=65 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cGjlObYrRhsC |isbn=9780472033591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
In March 1939, Holman married Ralph (pronounced "Rafe") Holmes, a film and stage actor twelve years younger. She had dated his older brother, [[Phillips Holmes]]. In 1940, both brothers, who were half-Canadian, joined the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]]. Phillips Holmes was killed in a collision of two military aircraft on August 12, 1942. When Ralph Holmes returned home in August 1945, the marriage soured and they separated. On November 15, 1945, Ralph Holmes was found dead in his Manhattan apartment from a [[barbiturate]] overdose at age 29.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Milestones |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,852521,00.html |date=1945-12-03 |work=Time |accessdate=2009-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holman adopted two sons, Timmy (born October 18, 1945), and Tony (born May 19, 1947). Her biological son Christopher ("Topper") died on August 7, 1950 after falling while mountain climbing. She had given him permission to go mountain climbing with a friend on [[Mount Whitney]], the highest peak in California, but was unaware that the boys were ill-prepared for the adventure. Both died. Those close to Holman claim she never forgave herself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Libby Holman profile|url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/holman-libby |website=jwa.org |access-date=2016-01-12 |last=Scheper |first=Jeanne |date=2009-03-01 |publisher=Jewish Women: A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, Holman worked with her accompanist, Gerald Cook, on researching and rearranging what they called earth music. It was primarily [[blues]] and [[Spiritual (music)|spirituals]] that were linked to the [[African American]] community. She was involved in the [[Civil rights movement]] and became a close friend and associate of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]

After the death of her son Christopher, she created the Christopher Reynolds Foundation to support equality, international disarmament, and the resolution of environmental problems. Over time the foundation narrowed its scope to more specific causes, such as relations between Cuba and the U.S. She contributed to the defense of [[Benjamin Spock]], the pediatrician and writer arrested for taking part in antiwar demonstrations.&lt;ref name="treetops"/&gt;

Through this foundation she provided funds for King's trip to India with his wife, [[Coretta Scott King]], to meet followers of Mahatma Gandhi&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/Holman-Libby |title=Libby Holman profile |website=jwa.org |access-date=2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; whom he referred to as "the guiding light of our technique of nonviolent social change".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=King Jr |first=Martin Luther |date=July 1959 |title=My Trip to the Land of Gandhi |url=http://kingencyclopedia.stanford.edu/primarydocuments/Vol5/July1959_MyTriptotheLandofGandhi.pdf |journal= Martin Luther King Jr. Papers Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], she tried to organize shows for servicemen with her friend [[Josh White]], but they were turned down on the grounds that "we don't book mixed company."&lt;ref name="Perry"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Perry |title=Libby Holman, Body and Soul |publisher=Little, Brown}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}

{{Quote|Libby and Josh were beyond brave, although perhaps she did not quite realize what she was taking on in 1940s America. When they started rehearsals for their first show in a New York club, she arrived at the front door and was welcomed. Josh was directed to the staff entrance round the back. Libby waited till the day they were due to open, after the owners had spent a vast amount on publicity, and told them she was not going to sing in their club until they changed their racial door policy. She won. In Philadelphia, Josh was refused a room at the hotel in whose bar they sang nightly. Libby ranted and told them: "Take down the American flag outside and fly the fucking swastika, why don't you!" When they were told by officials that the US Army did not tolerate mixed shows, Libby replied: "Mixed? You mean boys and girls?"&lt;ref name="Jewish Quarterly"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishquarterly.org/issuearchive/article5c9e.html?articleid=253|title=The Jewish Quarterly}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On December 27, 1960, she married sculptor [[Louis Schanker]]. Although she had enough money after her marriage to Reynolds, she continued to perform and make records.

===Death and legacy===
[[File:Treetops Mansion from Treetops State Park.JPG|thumb|The Treetops Mansion viewed from Treetops State Park]]
Holman reportedly suffered from depression because of: the deaths of [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], the presidential election loss by [[Eugene McCarthy]], the deaths of young men in the [[Vietnam War]], the death of her son, and the illness of her friend [[Jane Bowles]].&lt;ref name="Jewish Quarterly"/&gt; Friends said she lost her vitality after the death of [[Montgomery Clift]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Machlin, ''Libby'', 353&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 18, 1971, Holman was found nearly dead in the front seat of her [[Rolls-Royce (car)|Rolls Royce]]. She was taken to the hospital where she died hours later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Nash |first=Jay Robert |title=The Great Pictorial History of World Crime |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |year=2004 |pages=1246 |isbn=1-928831-22-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her death was ruled a suicide due to [[carbon monoxide poisoning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Frasier|first=David K. |title=Suicide in the Entertainment Industry: An Encyclopedia of 840 Twentieth Century Cases |publisher=McFarland |year=2002 |pages=147 |isbn=0-7864-1038-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In view of her bouts with depression and reported past suicide attempts, none of Holman's friends or relatives was surprised by her death. She was cremated and her ashes scattered at Treetops.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Scott. ''Resting Places: The Burial Sites of More Than 14,000 Famous Persons'', 3d ed.: 2 (Kindle Locations 21849-21850). McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., Publishers. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, a successful effort was made by citizens to save [[Treetops (State Park)|Treetops]], her Connecticut estate, from development. It straddles the border of Stamford and Greenwich. As a result, the pristine grounds were preserved. Treetops is part of the Mianus River State Park, which is overseen by the [[Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection]]. Treetops is south of the Mianus River Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Friends of the Mianus River Park: History of Treetops State Park|url=http://sites.google.com/site/mianusriverpark/treetops-state-park|accessdate=21 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mansion is privately owned. In 2006, Louis Schanker's art studio on a hill overlooking the property became the home of the Treetops Chamber Music Society.&lt;ref&gt;Friends of Mianus River State Park: [https://sites.google.com/site/mianusriverpark/treetops-state-park Harry Day, "Libby Holman, the SLCT and the Treetops Legacy," Spring 2009], accessed January 7, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Rosen was born Lucie Bigelow Dodge in 1890, and married the lawyer and banker [[Walter Tower Rosen]] in 1914. They shared a common passion in art and culture, especially Italian, making frequent European trips and  collecting works of art for their [[Caramoor Center for Music and the Arts|Caramoor]] estate that they developed from 1929 to 1939.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Glinsky|Glinsky]] p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1930 Lucie was part of a ten-person theremin ensemble rehearsing for their debut at the Carnegie Hall with [[Leon Theremin]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Glinsky|Glinsky]] p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometime afterward, the Rosens offered Theremin the use of their 37 West Fifty-fourth Street townhouse at low rent. By 1938 Leon Theremin needed money to return to Russia and, according to the Rosen's daughter Anne Stern, Walter offered him ten thousand dollars to create a new machine for Lucie together with all technical papers and rights to produce more for personal use only.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Glinsky|Glinsky]] p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Walter died in 1951, Lucie expanded the musical performances they had both started in 1940 into the Caramoor festival.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Glinsky|Glinsky]] p. 288. fully developed Caramoor festival&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/19/nyregion/the-view-from-katonah-for-costume-fanciers-regal-fantasy-fashions.html|title=The View From: Katonah; For Costume Fanciers, Regal Fantasy Fashions|last=Ames|first=Lynne|date=October 19, 1997|work=New York Times|accessdate=12 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Her parents were Flora Bigelow and Charles Stuart Dodge; they divorced in 1902 and Flora was given custody of Lucie and her brother [[Johnnie Dodge|John Bigelow Dodge]].  She  remarried  to [[Guest family#Ivor Bertie Guest, 1st Baron Wimborne|Lionel Guest]], a cousin of [[Winston Churchill]] and moved to Canada and later to London.  Lucie's paternal grandfather was [[Charles C. Dodge]] who was a brigadier-general during the American Civil War and had married Maria Theresa Schieffelin, daughter of [[Bradhurst Schieffelin]].  Her great grandfather was [[William E. Dodge]] who helped found [[Phelps Dodge|Phelps Dodge &amp; Co]] and secured the family wealth.  Her maternal grandfather was [[John Bigelow]] husband of Jennie Tunis Poultney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dodge|first1=Phyllis B.|title=Tales of the Phelps-Dodge Family|date=1987|publisher=New York Historical Society|location=New York|page=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913 Lucie disappeared from her mother's home in London, resulting in a much publicized search involving Scotland Yard.  She was discovered six days later living in London's West End theatre district.  She returned home but soon after moved to New York and married Rosen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dodge|first1=Phyllis B.|title=Tales of the Phelps Dodge Family|date=1987|publisher=New York Historical Society|location=New York|page=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had two children, Anne and Walter; he was killed in 1944 on a training mission in England whilst serving with the Royal Canadian Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Caramoor History|url=http://www.caramoor.org/about/history/|website=Caramoor.org|publisher=Caramoor Center for Music &amp; the Arts, Inc.|accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oakes Ames''' (January 10, 1804 – May 8, 1873) was an American manufacturer, capitalist, and member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] from [[Massachusetts]].  As a congressman, he is credited by many historians as being the single most important influence in the building of the [[Union Pacific]] portion of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad (North America)|transcontinental railroad]]. He is also noted for the subsequent [[Crédit Mobilier of America scandal|scandal]] that alleged the improper sale of stock of the railroad's construction company.

==Biography==
Ames was born in [[Easton, Massachusetts]], the son of [[Oliver Ames, Sr.]], a [[blacksmith]] who had built a business of making shovels, the [[Ames Shovel Shop]], and became nicknamed "King of Spades".&lt;ref&gt;[[Modern Marvels]] television program; episode "Construction Machines." Originally aired February 22, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In his youth, he obtained a public school education and later worked in the family workshops to learn each step of the manufacturing process. He eventually became a partner in the business, and with his brother [[Oliver Ames, Jr.]] he established the firm Oliver Ames &amp; Sons. Driven by the settlement of the [[Midwest]], by the discovery of gold in California and Australia, as well as by railroad construction, the shovel manufacturing business boomed. During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the firm prospered with contracts for swords, shovels, and other tools and implements.&lt;ref name=amer&gt;{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Ames, Oakes|year=1920}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ames made a large fortune.

He was influential in the establishment of the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] in Massachusetts. In 1860, he became a member of the executive council of Massachusetts, and from 1863 to 1873 he served as a U.S. Congressman from the Second District of Massachusetts. In Congress, he became a member of the Committee on Railroads during the early building of the transcontinental railroad. In 1865, [[Abraham Lincoln|President Abraham Lincoln]] appealed to him to take control of the Union Pacific (UP) portion of the project, which had become mired down because of the war, and had built only {{convert|12|mi|km}} of track.

Through his influence he obtained contracts for his family firm in the construction of the Union Pacific and staked nearly all the family's holdings as capitalization for the project. The contracts were later transferred to the [[Crédit Mobilier of America scandal|Credit Mobilier Company of America]] after Ames ousted its founder [[Thomas C. Durant|Thomas Durant]]. His brother Oliver was appointed president of the UP in 1866. The railroad was completed in 1869.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Nothing Like It In The World; The Men who Built the Transcontinental Railroad 1863–1869 |author=Ambrose, Stephen E.|year=2000 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |isbn=0-684-84609-8 |pages=363–368}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1872, it was disclosed Ames sold shares in Credit Mobilier to fellow congressmen at a price greatly below the market value of the stock. The subsequent public scandal led to a House investigation, which formally recommended expulsion. On February 28, 1873, the House passed a resolution formally [[Censure in the United States|censuring]] Ames "in seeking to secure congressional attention to the affairs of a corporation in which he was interested, and whose interest directly depended upon the legislation of Congress, by inducing members of Congress to invest in the stocks of said corporation."&lt;ref&gt;United States Congress, Washington, D.C. [http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=A000175 "Ames, Oakes, (1804 - 1873)."] ''Biographical Directory of the United States Congress.'' Accessed December 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Detractors referred to him as "Hoax Ames."&lt;ref&gt;Massachusetts Foundation for the Humanities, Northampton, MA. [http://www.massmoments.org/moment.cfm?mid=139 "Ames brothers celebrate 'Golden Spike.'] ''Mass Moments.'' Accessed December 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Ames died soon afterward at [[Easton, Massachusetts|North Easton, Massachusetts]].

On May 10, 1883, the 14th anniversary of the completion of the railroad, the [[Massachusetts General Court|state legislature of Massachusetts]] passed a resolution exonerating Ames.&lt;ref name=amer/&gt; His son [[Oliver Ames (governor)|Oliver Ames]] served as [[Governor of Massachusetts|Governor]] from 1887 to 1890.&lt;ref&gt;Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Boston, MA.

The contributions of Ames and his brother Oliver in the building of the Union Pacific are commemorated in the [[Oliver and Oakes Ames Monument]] at Sherman Summit, near [[Laramie, Wyoming]], along the original route. The [[pyramid]]al monument was designed by famous architect [[Henry Hobson Richardson]] (who designed a number of projects for the Ames family) with sculpted plaques of the Ames brothers by [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]]. At the time of its construction, the monument was located at the highest point attained by the UP's transcontinental route.  With a change in the route of the railroad, the monument today is not on any major transportation route.

The city of [[Ames, Iowa|Ames]], Iowa is named for Oakes, as is likely the community of [[Ames, Nebraska|Ames]], Nebraska. The public high school in [[Easton, Massachusetts|Easton]], Massachusetts is named [[Oliver Ames High School]].

[[File:Olof Aschberg, bankdirektör, brunpatinerad bronsbyst utförd av Carl Fagerberg, 1925.jpg|thumb|Bank director Olof Aschberg, brown patronized bronze bust created by [[Carl Fagerberg (sculptor)|Carl Fagerberg]] in 1925.]]  
'''Olof Aschberg''' (22 July 1877 – 21 April 1960) was a Swedish banker and businessman. Aschberg was a leftist sympathizer and helped finance the [[Bolshevik]]s in Russia. In gratitude, the Bolshevik government allowed Aschberg to do business with Soviet Union during the 1920s. In 1922, Aschberg founded [[Roskombank]], the first Soviet international bank.&lt;ref&gt;[[Antony C. Sutton]], ''Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution'', chapter XI, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

Olof founded in Stockholm the first Swedish bank for trade unions and cooperatives (Nya Banken) in 1912 and became a friend of [[Hjalmar Branting]]. When financial operations in favour of the Germans in 1918 caused him trouble with the [[Allies of World War I]], the bank was renamed Svensk Ekonomiebolaget.&lt;ref name="Artiste"&gt;[[Alain Dugrand]] / Frédéric Laurent, ''Willi Münzenberg. Artiste en révolution (1889–1940)'', Paris, Librairie Arthème Fayard 2008, pp. 218–219, 585&lt;/ref&gt; He was already a successful banker and businessman when he met first [[Willi Münzenberg]] who visited the Stockholm Youth Socialist Congress of 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Babette Gross, ''Willi Münzenberg: Eine politische Biographie'', Stuttgart 1967, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; Later, during the Bolsheviks aspirations to rebuild the Russian economy, it was Münzenberg's task to expand their modest pool of capital by floating a so-called "workers' loan" using his "[[Workers International Relief]]" (WIR).&lt;ref name="Red Millionaire"&gt;Sean McMeekin, ''The red millionaire: A political biography of Willi Münzenberg, Moscow’s secret propaganda tsar in the West'', New Haven &amp; London,Yale University Press 2003, pp. 135, 138, 296, 297, 301&lt;/ref&gt; By means of this subterfuge the money used for buying machines and goods in the West looked like being the outcome of proletarian support, in reality it came directly from the Kremlin, confiscated from Russia's rich and the Church.&lt;ref name="Red Millionaire" /&gt; Established in [[Berlin]] in the 1920s, Aschberg's Guarantee and Credit Bank for the East was charged with repayment of the WIR workers' loan, although he had not been very fond of it from its very beginning on and had even contributed to deep six it soon after the launch. Aschberg had already gained the Soviet leaders' esteem by being one of the main connections in the early years after 1917 in evading the international boycott on gold robbed by the Bolsheviks, which he offered on the Stockholm market after having the bullions melted down and given new markings.&lt;ref name="Red Millionaire" /&gt;

He built up a collection of [[Russian icons]] with 245 pieces which he donated to the Swedish [[Nationalmuseum]] at Stockholm in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Helge Kjellin, ''Icones Russes. Collection Olof Aschberg. Donation faite au Musée National'', (Catalogues d'expositions du Musée National, № 45), Stockholm, Kungl. Boktryckeriet. P. A. Norstedt &amp; Söner 1933, pp. 1–3&lt;/ref&gt;  This largest and finest collection of icons outside Russia was supplemented in 1952 and put the Nationalmuseum among the leading museums in this field.

At the end of the 1920s Aschberg moved to France, where he bought Château du Bois du Rocher at [[Jouy-en-Josas]], in 1950 offered to the [[Unesco]] and subsequently sold to the [[Yvelines]] [[Departments of France|department]].&lt;ref name="Artiste" /&gt; He helped finance the [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Again Münzenberg was often invited to Aschberg's [[Paris]] townhouse on the place Casimir-Périer and received the funds for launching ''Die Zukunft'' (The Future), a weekly political broadsheet.&lt;ref name="Red Millionaire" /&gt; The [[Rive Gauche (Paris)|Left Bank]] townhouse was gradually transformed into a kind of all-purpose Münzenberg salon, which did attract the attention of the [[Gestapo]], spying on the meetings taking place there.&lt;ref name="Red Millionaire" /&gt; With the outbreak of [[World War II]] Aschberg was interned in [[Camp Vernet]] by the French authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Thierry Wolton, ''Le grand recrutement'', Paris, Bernard Grasset 1993, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; Due to his [[Jew]]ish background he was endangered when France was invaded by [[Nazi Germany]] in 1940 and could not sooner as January 1941 leave Europe via [[Lisbon]] when [[Vichy France|Vichy government]] gave order to set him free. Aschberg and his family fled to the United States where he immediately started to support the Free World Association. After the war, Aschberg moved back to Sweden. In 1946 he started publishing his memoirs in three volumes (''En vandrande jude från Glasbruksgatan'', ''Återkomsten'', and ''Gästboken'') and he invited [[Margarete Buber-Neumann]] to write there ''Under Two Dictators: Prisoner of Stalin and Hitler''.&lt;ref name="Artiste"/&gt;

Olof is the grandfather of the journalists [[Robert Aschberg]] and Richard Aschberg.

'''Pedro Affonso Collor de Melo''' (14 December 1952 – 19 December 1994) was the brother of former [[Brazil]]ian president [[Fernando Collor]]. Working for the Collor family's newspaper [[Gazeta de Alagoas]], Pedro Collor gained prominence when he made a series of accusations against his brother, who was then president. The allegations include corruption, and drug use.  Pedro Collor's revelations helped precipitate his brother's downfall in 1992.  Pedro Collor died of brain cancer in 1994.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1181">The '''process window''' is a graph with a range of parameters for a specific manufacturing process yields a defined result. Typically multiple parameters are plotted in such a graph with a central region where the process behaves well, while the outer borders define regions where the process becomes unstable or returns an unfavourable result. A statistical evaluation of the process performance is further performed by the calculation of the associated [[Process Window Index]].

==Applications==
Typical applications are found in [[photolithography]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mack|first=Chris|title=Swing curves and the process window|url=http://www.lithoguru.com/scientist/litho_tutor/TUTOR20%20%28Winter%2098%29.pdf|work=Tutorials on Photolithography|accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the response of a photoresist to parameters like temperature, radiation intensity, critical dimension and sidewall angle of the structures, etc. are plotted versus an optical parameter such as the [[numerical aperture]] to optimize the design of an exposure tool or to achieve a reproducible result and high yield.

'''Reginald "Reg" William Revans''' (14 May 1907 &amp;ndash; 8 January 2003) was an [[academic]] [[professor]], administrator and [[management consultant]] who pioneered the use of [[Action learning]]. He was also a [[long jump]]er who represented [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] at the [[1928 Summer Olympics]] in [[Amsterdam]] where he finished 32nd in the [[Athletics at the 1928 Summer Olympics - Men's long jump|long jump event]]. At the [[1930 British Empire Games|first British Empire Games]], in 1930, he won the silver medal in both the long jump and triple jump competition.

==Early life==
He was born at [[Portsmouth]], where his father was a marine surveyor. As a boy he saw his father receive a visit from seaman’s representatives after the wreck of the ''[[RMS Titanic]]''.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} He recollected attending the funeral of [[Florence Nightingale]] with his mother.{{dubious|date=August 2016}}{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

In the late 1920s he was a doctoral student in [[astrophysics]] at the [[University of Cambridge]]. A Commonwealth Scholarship in 1930 took him to study astrophysics and [[astronomy]] at [[the University of Michigan|University of Michigan]], and on his return to Cambridge as a fellow to [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge|Emmanuel]] he worked at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] under [[Lord Rutherford]] and Sir [[J. J. Thomson]]. There were five [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] prizewinners in the department, but Revans found them humble enough to share their puzzlements and to listen, rather than claiming to know and be able to instruct. Revans always remembered [[Albert Einstein]] saying to him: "If you think you understand a problem, make sure you are not deceiving yourself."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article884986.ece ''Times'' obituary&lt;/ref&gt; It was here that Revans began to develop his thinking on the role of 'non-expert' in problem solving, distinguishing between [[knowledge]] and [[wisdom]] in so doing.

He moved into education to become assistant education officer for [[Essex]] (1935–1945) and then director of education for the [[National Coal Board]] from 1945 to 1950.

==Action Learning==
{{main article|Action learning}}
It was at the Coal Board that Revans did much of the early work on developing action learning, working alongside [[E. F. Schumacher]] (author of ''Small is Beautiful'') and [[Eric Trist]], whose theories about socio-technical systems have also had an important influence on organisation development.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} He then moved to the [[Acton Society Trust]] where he worked with [[Teddy Chester]]. He and Chester both moved to the [[University of Manchester]] where Revans became the first professor of industrial management (1955–1965) but left to develop the inter-university action learning programme in Belgium.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Revans strongly held that the key to improving performance lay not with 'experts' but with practitioners themselves.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Hence he devised Action Learning as a process whereby the participant studies his own actions and experience in conjunction with others in small groups called action learning sets.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

== Belgium ==
After resigning from Manchester University, Revans moved to Belgium where he headed the Inter-University project, which had been set up to improve the ranking of Belgium in the organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development league. Working with five 
universities and 23 of the country's largest businesses, Revans' collaborative approaches succeeded in raising Belgium's industrial productivity growth rate above that of the USA, Germany and Japan.

Revans was subsequently awarded with the nation's top honour by the King of Belgium.

In 1969, he was awarded an Honorary Degree (Doctor of Science) from the [[University of Bath]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bath.ac.uk/ceremonies/hongrads/older.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
During the 1970s and 1980s he travelled round the world several times and wrote his most famous books: ''Developing Effective Managers'' (1971); ''The Origins and Growth of Action Learning'' (1982) and ''ABC of Action Learning'' (1983). From the 1980s Revans worked with public and private sector organisations, in the UK and internationally, advocating the process of action learning as a way of enabling and empowering people to learn with and from each other.

In the 1990s he was associated with the City of London where he met Raymond Mahoney and Alan Wenham-Prosser who were using his techniques to solve peoples problems of managing their work load in the City, and other personal problems which had become long term when managing difficult situations.  Reg Revans was made a Freeman of the City of London for the work which he did.

Revans made furniture as a hobby, played the trumpet and painted — even illustrating small books for his children. As well as being knighted by the [[King of Belgium]], in 1997 he was awarded the freedom of the [[City of London]]. Revans died in [[Wem]], [[Shropshire]] on 8 January 2003.

==Legacy==
Revans is not remembered as one of the best known [[guru]]s of [[management]] [[education]] or organisational development, not least because of his scorn for experts and his championing of [[w:John Doe|ordinary people]]. However, his ideas have been taught at the [[Revans Centre for Action Learning and Research]] (later the [[Revans Institute]]), part of the [[Salford Business School]] and they are applied in many organisations. His techniques have been applied in many organisations and by [[Management consulting|management consultant]]s and [[academic]]s including Richard Brimble, Mike Pedler, Alan Mumford and Richard Hale in the UK, and [[Michael Marquardt]], Yury Boshyk, Robert Kramer and Joe Raelin in the United States.

Recently the Revans Centre has moved to [[Manchester Business School]] becoming the [[Revans Academy]].  The [[Revans Collection]] is to be found at Salford University.

'''Samuel Batchelder''' (8 June 1784 in [[Jaffrey, New Hampshire]] – 5 February 1879 in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]) was a United States inventor and author.

==Biography==
His family moved to [[New Ipswich, New Hampshire|New Ipswich]] when he was young, and by 1808 he was an investor in a cotton factory there, the second that was erected in [[New Hampshire]]. In 1825 he moved to [[Lowell, Massachusetts]], where he superintended the erection of the Hamilton Company's mills. In 1831, he was called on to undertake the erection of a cotton mill for the York Manufacturing Company in [[Saco, Maine]], and to superintend its operations. The mills under his management were very successful, and the plant and capital were greatly enlarged.

In 1846 he moved to [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], where he continued to reside, and, although a representative in the [[Massachusetts State Legislature]], he yet for many years continued his relations with the mills, being president of the Hamilton Manufacturing Company, the Appleton Company, the Essex Company, the Everett Mills, the York Manufacturing Company, and the Exeter Manufacturing Company. The mills under his supervision had an aggregate capital of about $5,000,000.

==Inventions==
About 1832, he devised the first stop motion to the drawing frame, which afterward was used both in the United States and England. In 1832 he patented the steam cylinders and connections which became universally used in dressing frames for drying yarns. His greatest invention was the [[dynamometer]] used for ascertaining the power for driving machinery. It was first used in the York Co. mills in 1837, and was considered preferable to any known apparatus for determining the power actually used in driving machinery.

==Writing==
In early life he contributed to the ''Boston Monthly Anthology'' and to the ''[[Port Folio (magazine)|Port Folio]]''. He wrote:
*''Responsibilities of the North in Relation to Slavery'' (Cambridge, 1856)
*''Introduction and Early Progress of the Cotton Manufacture in the United States'' (Boston, 1863)

A Scope Limitation is a restriction on the applicability of an [auditor's report] that may arise from the inability to obtain sufficient appropriate evidence about a component in the financial statements.  When all the audit procedures that are considered necessary, either by circumstances, engagement, or client limitation, the audit is limited in scope.

Auditing standards suggest that when restrictions imposed by the client significantly limit the scope of the engagement the auditor should consider disclaiming the opinion.

Some scope limitations arise for reasons that are beyond the control of the client, such as [[fire]] and [[flood]]. Alternative procedures can overcome the risk of the auditor's qualified or disclaimer opinion.  Simple procedures to provide sufficient evidence would be necessary for the auditor to adhere to [[US GAAP]].

== Examples of limitations ==
*End of period inventory count limited, because the auditor is not engaged until after the end of the period. 
*Client requests
The scope limitation should bt of ADAM described before the opinion or disclaimer paragraph.

'''Southwell Business Park''' is a business park on the [[Isle of Portland]], [[Dorset]], [[England]]. It is housed at the former Admiralty Underwater Weapons Establishment, which closed in 1995 and became the Southwell Business Park in 1997.

==History==
[[Image:Southwell Business Park (ex-AUWE Portland) 3.JPG|thumb|The establishment as it remains today, now the Southwell Business Park.]]
[[Image:South West Coast Path Portland Dorset.jpg|thumb|The establishment can be clearly seen on the skyline from various parts of Portland, particularly from the South West Coast Path which runs around the edge of the establishment.]]
The Admiralty Underwater Weapons Establishment, built as a Gunnery Establishment at the beginning of the Cold War, was closed in 1995 alongside Portland's naval base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Legg|first=Rodney|title=Portland Encyclopaedia|year=1999|publisher=Dorset Publishing Company|isbn=978-0948699566|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jurassicagent1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jurassicagent.co.uk/index.php/library/history/deadly-weapons/55-underwater-research|title=The Jurassic Coast - Underwater Research|publisher=jurassicagent.co.uk|accessdate=2014-07-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726022607/http://www.jurassicagent.co.uk/index.php/library/history/deadly-weapons/55-underwater-research|archivedate=2014-07-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment buildings remained empty for two years, until Roy Haywood and Ray Bulpit, whose business was the acquisition and development of former military sites, purchased the site in 1997.&lt;ref name="dorsetlife1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dorsetlife.co.uk/2008/10/a-portland-success-story/ |title=A Portland Success Story &amp;#124; Dorset Life - The Dorset Magazine |publisher=Dorset Life |date= |accessdate=2014-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first tenants of Southwell Business Park arrived that year, and the park continued to expand its range of business tenants. In the 2000s, the site was recorded as employing almost 500 people and being home to over 100 businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geoffkirby.co.uk/Portland/680700/ |title=Southwell Business Park |publisher=Geoffkirby.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was estimated that the total turnover generated at the park from 1997 to 2008 reached over £200 million.&lt;ref name="dorsetlife1"/&gt;

In 2006, work commenced on developing unused parts of the park, including an unused 1970s-built wing, into the Portland Spa and an 80-bedroom hotel, known as the Venue Hotel. Completed in 2007, the spa included a gym, a fitness studio and an indoor swimming pool.&lt;ref name="dorsetlife1"/&gt; The Orchid Restaurant was also converted from the former AUWE canteen. It was later renamed to the Cliff Panoramic Restaurant and Bar.&lt;ref name="dorsetlife1"/&gt; In 2010, the park went into administration after the UK recession made it difficult to repay borrowed money used to create the spa and hotel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/8242944.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; England &amp;#124; Business park 'recession victim' |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-09-07 |accessdate=2014-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site was sold to Compass Point Estates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McDonald |first=Ian |url=http://www.dorsetecho.co.uk/news/5970880.Fresh_start_for_new_team_at_Southwell_Business_Park/ |title=Fresh start for new team at Southwell Business Park (From Dorset Echo) |publisher=Dorsetecho.co.uk |date=2010-03-31 |accessdate=2014-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a succession of ownership changes and names, the tenants of the Ocean Spa took over the hotel and restaurant in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Davis |first=Joanna |url=http://www.dorsetecho.co.uk/news/10222017.Portland_spa_takes_over_hotel/ |title=Portland spa takes over hotel (From Dorset Echo) |publisher=Dorsetecho.co.uk |date=2013-02-12 |accessdate=2014-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thanathorn was born and raised in Bangkok, the second child of five. His mother, [[Somporn Juangroongruangkit]], is the current President and CEO of the Thai Summit Group, taking over the company from Thanathorn’s father, [[Pattana Juangroongruangkit]], after his death in 2002. Pattana founded the Thai Summit Group in 1977. The Juangroongruangkit family also owns a large stake in the Thai media conglomerate Matichon Publishing Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Thai Autoparts Heir Launches Political Party |url=https://www.voanews.com/a/thailand-autoparts-heir-political-party/4299631.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Thanathorn’s uncle, [[Suriya Juangroongruangkit]], is a Thai politician who served as Minister of Transport of Thailand between 2002 and 2005.  

== Education ==  
Thanathorn attended the [[Triam Udom Suksa School]] in Bangkok. After graduating from high school, Thanathorn obtained a joint-honours Bachelor of Engineering (B.Eng.) in Mechanical Engineering from [[Thammasat University]] and the [[University of Nottingham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Isaan’s future: Thanathorn on moving the region forward |url=https://isaanrecord.com/2018/06/08/isaans-future-thanathorn-on-moving-the-region-forward/ |website=Isaan Record |accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, he became President of the Thammasat University Students Union in 1999, and was later named deputy secretary-general of the Students Federation of Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A risk-taker billionaire pursuing social justice |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/detail/politics/30342763 |accessdate=10 September 2018 |agency=The Nation}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later decided to pursue his interest in social and economic issues and obtained three master’s degrees: one in Political Economy from [[Chulalongkorn University]], one in Global Finance from [[NYU Stern School of Business|Stern School of Business, New York University]] and one in International Business Law from the [[University of St. Gallen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=“ไพร่หมื่นล้าน” ธนาธร จึงรุ่งเรืองกิจ กับ “โรดแมป” การเมือง |url=https://www.bbc.com/thai/thailand-43080898 |website=BBC Thai}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout his studies, Thanathorn was involved with various charities and NGOs calling for social and economic reforms in Thailand, including Friends of the People and the [[Assembly of the Poor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A risk-taker billionaire pursuing social justice |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/detail/politics/30342763 |accessdate=10 September 2018 |agency=The Nation}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Thanathorn campaigned for the land and compensation rights of villagers affected by the [[Pak Mun dam]] in the Ubon Ratchathani Province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Isaan’s future: Thanathorn on moving the region forward |url=https://isaanrecord.com/2018/06/08/isaans-future-thanathorn-on-moving-the-region-forward/ |website=Isaan Record |accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=สัมภาษณ์ : ธนาธร จึงรุ่งเรืองกิจ รองประธานกรรมการบริหาร กลุ่มบริษัทไทยซัมมิท “ผมถูกบังคับให้เป็นนายทุน” |url=https://www.sarakadee.com/2007/01/14/thanatorn/ |publisher=Sarakadee Magazine |accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His family also expressed serious concern about Thanathorn's student movement activities. It is disclosed in several interviews that Thanathorn has been in conflict with his uncle, [[Suriya Juangroongruangkit]], since he was young mainly due to their disagreement regarding the [[Trans Thailand–Malaysia Gas Pipeline|Trans Thai-Malaysia Gas Pipeline Project]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=‘สุริยะ’ พูดถึง ธนาธร จึงรุ่งเรืองกิจ ‘ผมเองยังถูกต่อว่า เขาเป็นคนแบบนี้มาตั้งแต่เรียน’ |url=https://www.matichon.co.th/politics/news_1077860 |website=Matichon Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thanathorn believes the construction of this dam exemplified the government unaccountability and crony-capitalism that peaked with the 1997 economic crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Isaan’s future: Thanathorn on moving the region forward |url=https://isaanrecord.com/2018/06/08/isaans-future-thanathorn-on-moving-the-region-forward/ |website=Isaan Record |accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Professional career == 
After completing his studies, Thanathorn set out to pursue a career with the United Nations, and was offered a position as a development worker for the UN in Algeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Isaan’s future: Thanathorn on moving the region forward |url=https://isaanrecord.com/2018/06/08/isaans-future-thanathorn-on-moving-the-region-forward/ |website=Isaan Record |accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Thanathorn was forced to abandon his plans when his father, Pattana Juangroongruangkit, was diagnosed with cancer. Following his father’s death in 2002, Thanathorn returned to Thailand and assumed leadership of the Thai Summit Group at just 23 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Thai Autoparts Heir Launches Political Party |url=https://www.voanews.com/a/thailand-autoparts-heir-political-party/4299631.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Under Thanathorn’s leadership, the company’s revenue grew from 16 billion baht in 2001 to 80 billion baht in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ธนาธร จึงรุ่งเรืองกิจ พลิกตำราบริหารความเสี่ยงครั้งใหม่ที่ ‘ขั้วโลกใต้’ |url=http://forbesthailand.com/forbes-life-detail.php?did=2139 |website=Forbes Thailand}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thanathorn oversaw the transformation of the company into a global conglomerate with manufacturing facilities in 7 countries and more than 16,000 employees worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ธนาธร จึงรุ่งเรืองกิจ ดัน “ไทยซัมมิท” ทะลุเป้าแสนล้าน |url=https://www.prachachat.net/motoring/news-54183 |website=Prachachat.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2005, Thanathorn struck a deal with the American auto-maker, [[Tesla, Inc.|Tesla]] to supply 500,000 cars per year. The deal was noted as a ‘new record’ for Thai Summit Group with total sales of 7.9 billion baht and a profit of 5.98 billion baht. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Exclusive ธนาธร จึงรุ่งเรืองกิจ: มองอนาคตยานยนต์ไทย โลกขยับแล้ว แต่เราไม่ขยับ |url=https://www.voicetv.co.th/read/521050 |accessdate=10 September 2018 |agency=Voice TV |date=Sep 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks to the deal, the Thai Summit Group set up production factories in the United States. In 2009, Thanathorn led the company to acquire the world's largest mould maker, the Japanese company Ogihara.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Regarding the partial transfer of share holdings in Ogihara Corporation |url=http://www.daiwa-grp.jp/english/press/en_090219-a.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thanathorn served as the President of the Federation of Thai Industries’ Nakhon Nayok Chapter for two consecutive terms, between 2008 and 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Thailand's Focus 2017, Speakers' Profile |url=https://www.set.or.th/thailandfocus/speakers.html |website=The Stock Exchange of Thailand}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the youngest elected Secretary-General of the Thai Auto Parts Manufacturers Association, serving between 2007 and 2010. Thanathorn was also a member of the Industrial Cluster Development Board of Thailand’s National Science and Technology Development Agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Thailand's Focus 2017, Speakers' Profile |url=https://www.set.or.th/thailandfocus/speakers.html |website=The Stock Exchange of Thailand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, after 17 years as Executive Vice-President of the Thai Summit Group, Thanathorn resigned from this position after being elected leader of the Future Forward Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Thanathorn to hand over reins |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/news/1437502/thanathorn-to-hand-over-reins |website=Bangkok Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political career ==  

On 15 March 2018, Thanatorn and [[Piyabutr Saengkanokkul]], a former constitutional law professor at Thammasat University, filed for the creation of a new political party, [[Future Forward Party|Future Forward]] (Thai: อนาคตใหม่), with the [[Election Commission of Thailand]]. Thanathorn was unanimously elected as the party’s leader at the party’s first public meeting in May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/1473845/thanathorn-elected-leader-of-future-forward-party|title=Thanathorn elected leader of Future Forward Party|website=|language=th|access-date=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since founding the party, Thanathorn has advocated his political vision for the party; the return of civilian government and demilitarization of Thai politics, greater political accountability, a fairer distribution of wealth, social welfare system to promote human dignity and greater decentralisation of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Exclusive: "ไพร่หมื่นล้าน" จับมือ สมาชิก "นิติราษฎร์" เปิดตัวพรรคใหม่ |url=https://www.bbc.com/thai/thailand-43251942 |website=BBC Thai}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to guarantee Future Forward’s independence and transparency, the party has developed a unique funding structure, which relies entirely on donations from party members and supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ธนาธร-ปิยบุตร ตั้งพรรค "อนาคตใหม่" ประกาศไม่รับทุกส่วนประกอบ "อประชาธิปไตย" |url=https://www.bbc.com/thai/thailand-43411311}}&lt;/ref&gt; Future Forward Party goal is to raise 350 million baht funds from party members and the public to pursue its campaign in the next 2019 election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=“ธนาธร” จ่อระดมทุน 350 ล้านสู้ศึกลต. ลั่น อีก 10 เดือนขอทำงานหนักไม่ใช้เงินดูดอดีตส.ส. |url=https://www.matichon.co.th/politics/news_933215 |website=Matichon Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Due to his business experience, young age and political views, international media have drawn a comparisons between Thanathorn and French president [[Emmanuel Macron]] and Canadian Prime Minister [[Justin Trudeau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title='I might go to jail tomorrow' – Thai tycoon takes on junta |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/01/thanathorn-juangroongruangkit-thai-tycoon-trying-to-take-on-the-junta |website=The Guardian |accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=‘Young blood’ to shake up Thai politics |url=https://www.ft.com/content/ffd8506c-38ca-11e8-8eee-e06bde01c544 |website=Financial Times |accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He is occasionally referred by Thai media as the “Billionaire Commoner” which represents the struggle of social class system in Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ไพร่หมื่นล้าน! 10 รู้จัก 'เอก ธนาธร จึงรุ่งเรืองกิจ' เขาคือใคร?|url=https://www.thairath.co.th/content/1219182 |website=Thairath |accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thanathorn and two other senior party members, Jaruwan Sarankate and Klaikong Vaidhyakarn, were charged by police with the Computer Crime Act after an [[NCPO]] member filed an allegation against them for transmiting false information or information that damages the country's stability in relation with the Facebook Live Broadcast on 29th June 2018. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Future Forward's Thanathorn charged with computer crime |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/1527190/future-forwards-thanathorn-charged-with-computer-crime |website=Bangkok Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three politicians were ordered to meet investigators at the Technology Crime Suppression Division (TCSD) on Friday, 24th August 2018 to hear charges against them. Through their lawyer, they asked to postpone the date to 17th September 2018, saying the order had come at a short notice and they were already tied up with their planned schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Future Forward Leaders Postpone Police Meeting |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/1527754/future-forward-leaders-postpone-police-meeting |website=Bangkok Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thanathorn previously appeared on 31st July 2018 as a witness, but refrain his rights to give any statement on the allegation to the officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Thanathorn may face computer crime charges|url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/1513298/thanathorn-may-face-computer-crime-charges}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==  
Thanathorn is married to Rawiphan Juangroongruangkit. They have four children together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='ธนาธร' เปิดภาพครอบครัวอนาคตใหม่ เผยภรรยาท้อง5เดือนเล็งตั้งชื่อ'น้องฟิวเจอร์' |url=https://www.thaipost.net/main/detail/10472 |accessdate=10 September 2018 |agency=Thaipost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his spare time, Thanathorn enjoys outdoor activities such as hiking, trekking, climbing, marathons, kayaking, biking, diving and mountaineering. He has participated in various extreme sports competitions, including the [[Tor des Géants|Tor Des Géants]] and the [[Marathon des Sables|Sahara Marathon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ผมก็แค่คนธรรมดาคนหนึ่ง : ธนาธร จึงรุ่งเรืองกิจ |url=https://www.fungjaizine.com/article/interview/thanathorn-playlist |website=Fungjai |accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thanathorn was notably the first Asian to complete the 560KM self-supported foot race above the Arctic Circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About TJ: TJ's True South |url=http://www.paulpoole.co.th/truesouth/about-tj.html |accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wage theft''' is the denial of [[wages]] or [[employee benefits]] rightfully owed an [[employee]]. It can be conducted by employers in various ways, among them failing to pay [[overtime]]; violating [[minimum wage|minimum-wage]] laws; the [[misclassification of employees as independent contractors]], illegal deductions in pay; forcing employees to work "off the clock", or simply not paying an employee at all.

According to some studies, wage theft is common in the [[United States]], particularly from [[low wage]] legal or [[undocumented immigrant]] workers.&lt;ref name=NYTStudyreport&gt;{{cite news|title=Low-Wage Workers Are Often Cheated, Study Says|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/02/us/02wage.html|accessdate=May 29, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 1, 2009|author=Steven Greenhouse}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=More Workers Are Claiming  'Wage Theft' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/01/business/more-workers-are-claiming-wage-theft.html|accessdate=August 31, 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 31, 2014|author=Steven Greenhouse}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Economic Policy Institute]] reported in 2014 that survey evidence suggests wage theft costs US workers billions of dollars a year.&lt;ref&gt;Brady Meixell and Ross Eisenbrey (September 11, 2014). [http://www.epi.org/publication/epidemic-wage-theft-costing-workers-hundreds/ An Epidemic of Wage Theft Is Costing Workers Hundreds of Millions of Dollars a Year]. Economic Policy Institute. Retrieved June 8, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Some rights violated by wage theft have been guaranteed to workers in the United States in the 1938 [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] (FLSA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=eE9svG8wLAsC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR5&amp;dq=wage+theft&amp;ots=EMqtcfRtLs&amp;sig=rb7ileUzwElvRRPEMogQKnBeVIk#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Wage Theft in America.

== Forms ==

=== Overtime ===

]]
According to the FLSA, unless exempt, employees are entitled to receive [[overtime]] pay calculated at least time and one-half times pay for all time worked past forty hours a week. Some exemptions to this rule apply to public service agencies or to employees who meet certain requirements in accordance to their job duties along with a salary of no less than $455 a week. Despite regulations, there are many employees today who are not paid overtime due them. A 2009 study of workers in the United States found that in 12 occupations more than half of surveyed workers reported being denied overtime pay: child care (90.2 percent denial), stock and office clerks (86 percent), home health care (82.7 percent),  beauty/dry cleaning and general repair workers (81.9 percent), car wash workers and parking attendants (77.9 percent), waiters, cafeteria workers and bartenders (77.9 percent), retail salespersons (76.2 percent), janitors and grounds workers (71.2 percent), garment workers (69.9 percent), cooks and dishwashers (67.8 percent), construction workers (66.1 percent) and cashiers (58.8 percent).&lt;ref name="Broken Laws, Unprotected Workers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wage Theft: Six Common Methods"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nclnet.org/worker-rights/148-wage-theft/525-wage-theft-six-common-methods |title=Wage Theft: Six common methods - National Consumers League |publisher=Nclnet.org |date= |accessdate=March 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Minimum wage ===
In 2009, reform placed the new [[US|United States]] federal [[minimum wage]] at $7.25. Some states have legislation that sets a state minimum wage. In the case an employee is subject to both federal and state minimum wage acts, the employee is entitled to the higher standard of compensation. For tipped employees, the employer is only required to compensate the employee $2.13 an hour as long as the fixed wage and the tips add up to be at or above the federal minimum wage. Minimum wage is enforced by the [[Wage and Hour Division]] (WHD). WHD is generally contacted by 25,000 people a year in regards to concerns and violations of minimum wage pay.&lt;ref name="Broken Laws, Unprotected Workers" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cpps.org.my/resource_centre/FACTSHEET%20ON%20MINIMUM%20WAGE%20LEGISLATION%20AROUND%20THE%20WORLD.pdf |title=Factsheet on Minimum Wage Legislation Around The World |work=Centre for Public Policy Studies (CPPS) |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common form of wage theft for tipped employees is to receive no standard pay ($2.13 an hour) along with tips.&lt;ref name="Wage Theft: Six Common Methods" /&gt;

=== Misclassification ===
[[Misclassification of employees as independent contractors|Misclassification of employees]] is a violation that leaves employees very vulnerable to other forms of wage theft. Under the FLSA, [[independent contractor]]s do not receive the same protection as an employee for certain benefits. The difference between the two classifications depends on the permanency of the employment, opportunity for profit and loss, the worker's level of [[self-employment]] along with their degree of control. An independent contractor is not entitled to [[minimum wage]], [[overtime]], [[insurance]], protection, or other employee rights. Attempts are sometimes made to define ordinary employees as independent contractors.&lt;ref name="Broken Laws, Unprotected Workers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wage Theft: Six Common Methods" /&gt;

Misclassification in the United States is extensive. In New York state, for example, it was found in a 2007 study that approximately 704,785 workers, or 10.3% of the state's private sector workforce, was misclassified each year. For the industries covered in the study, average [[Unemployment benefits|unemployment insurance]] taxable wages underreported due to misclassification was on average $4.3 billion for the year and [[Federal Unemployment Tax Act|unemployment insurance tax]] underreported in these industries was $176 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1009&amp;context=reports|title = The Cost of Worker Misclassification in New York State|author1=Linda H.

=== Illegal deductions ===
Employees are subject to forms of wage theft through illegal deductions. Trivial to sometimes fabricated violations in the workplace are used to validate deductions. Any deduction that brings an employee to a level of compensation lower than minimum wage is also illegal. In many states, employers are required to issue employees documentation of deductions along with earnings. Failure to issue this documentation is generally prevalent in working places subject to wage theft.&lt;ref name="Broken Laws, Unprotected Workers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wage Theft: Six Common Methods" /&gt;

=== Full wage theft ===
The most blatant form of wage theft is for an employee to not be paid for work done. An employee being asked to work overtime, working through breaks, or being asked to report early and/or leave late without pay is being subjected to wage theft. This is sometimes justified as displacing a paid meal break without guaranteeing meal break time. In the most extreme cases, employees report receiving nothing.&lt;ref name="Broken Laws, Unprotected Workers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wage Theft: Six Common Methods" /&gt; In some cases, the [[Illegal immigration to the United States|legal status]] of the workers can enable employers to withhold pay without fear of facing any consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2013/04/10/176677299/construction-booming-in-texas-but-many-workers-pay-dearly|title=Construction Booming In Texas, But Many Workers Pay Dearly|work=National Public Radio (NPR)|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other forms ===
Putting the pressure on injured workers to not file for [[workers' compensation]] is frequently successful.&lt;ref name=NYTStudyreport /&gt; Employees are often confronted with threats of firing or calls to immigration services if they complain or seek redress. Workers are often denied time off or [[Annual leave|vacation time]] that they have acquired or denied pay for [[sick leave]] or vacation time.

In Australia, another form of wage theft is the failure of employers to pay the mandatory minimum contribution to employee's [[Superannuation in Australia|superannuation fund]]. Between 2009 and 2013 the [[Australian Tax Office]] recovered&amp;nbsp;A$1.3 billion&amp;nbsp;in unpaid superannuation which is estimated to be only a small portion of total unpaid superannuation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://insurancenewsnet.com/oarticle/2014/07/08/unpaid-super-a-billion-dollar-problem-says-actu-a-527139.html#.U7wMjvldXfI|title = Unpaid Super a Billion Dollar Problem, Says ACTU|date = 7 July 2014|work = Targeted News Service|accessdate=July 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;

|}
A 2009 study based on interviews of over 4,000 [[low wage]] workers in [[Chicago]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[New York City]] found that wage theft from low wage workers in large cities in the United States was severe and widespread. Incidents varied with the type of job and employee. Sixty-eight percent of the surveyed workers experienced at least one pay-related violation in the week prior to the survey. On average the workers in the three cities lost a total of $2,634 annually due to [[workplace violation]]s, out of an average income of $17,616, which translates into wage theft of fifteen percent of income. Extrapolating from these figures, low wage workers in Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York City lost more than $2.9 billion due to employment and labor law violations.&lt;ref name="Broken Laws, Unprotected Workers" /&gt; Nationally it is estimated that workers are not paid at least $19 billion every year in overtime&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://voiceofrussia.com/us/2014_05_21/Wage-Theft-in-America-How-the-Rich-get-Richer-While-the-Poor-Stay-Poor-6533/|title = Wage Theft in America: How the Rich get Richer While the Poor Stay Poor|last = Park|first = Crystal|date = 21 May 2014|work = Voice of Russia|accessdate=July 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that in the US $40 billion to $60 billion in total are lost annually due to all forms of wage theft.&lt;ref name=Groote&gt;{{cite news|last1=Michael De Groote|first1=Michael De Groote|title=Wage theft: How employers steal millions from workers every week|url=http://national.deseretnews.com/article/1748/Wage-theft-How-employers-steal-millions-from-workers-every-week.html|accessdate=July 1, 2014 |publisher=Desert News National|date=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This compares to national annual losses of  $340 million due to [[robbery]], $4.1 billion due to [[burglary]], $5.3 billion due to [[larceny]], and $3.8 billion due to [[auto theft]] in 2012.&lt;ref name="Federal Bureau of Investigation"/&gt;

=== Workers at risk ===
Studies have found inflated rates of wage theft violations in markets employing women and foreign-born populations. Within the foreign-born population, women were at a much greater risk for wage violations than their male counterparts. Undocumented workers or unauthorized immigrants stood at the highest risk levels. Education, longer [[tenure]]d employment, and English proficiency proved to be influential factors in employee populations. All three variables reduced the probability of wage theft for the aforementioned demographics. Workplaces where the compensation was paid in one weekly flat rate or in cash saw a higher instance rate of wage theft. Smaller businesses with less than 100 employees also saw a higher instance rate of violations than larger business. In one study, the [[manufacturing industry]], repair services, and private home employment were at the highest risk for violations at the workplace. [[Home health care]], education, and construction saw the lowest levels of wage theft. Restaurants, grocery stores, retail, and warehousing fell around the [[median]].&lt;ref name="Broken Laws, Unprotected Workers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wage Theft and Workplace Violations in Los Angeles"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irle.ucla.edu/events/2010/pdf/LAwagetheft.pdf |title=Wage Theft and Workplace Violations in Los Angeles - The Failure of Employment and Labour Law for Low-Wage Workers |author=Milkman, R. |author2=Narro, V. |author3=González, A. |last-author-amp=yes |year=2010 |publisher=Institute for Research on Labor and Employment University of California, Los Angeles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contemporary examples ===
In November 2011, Warehouse Workers helped [[Wal-Mart]] warehouse employees file their fourth [[Class action|class-action lawsuit]] against the warehouse companies. Without Wal-Mart being a direct defendant, the argument was made that Wal-Mart has created this culture amongst the companies it works with. The first lawsuit filed was in 2009. The workers argued that poor record keeping and broken promises have led to workers receiving less than minimum wage. Walmart also denied workers paid vacations that they were promised upon contracting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kari Lydersen |url=http://www.alternet.org/story/153226/wage_theft_at_wal-mart_warehouses_fourth_lawsuit_in_two_years_filed_on_behalf_of_underpaid_workers/ |title=Wage Theft at Wal-Mart Warehouses? Fourth Lawsuit in Two Years Filed on Behalf of Underpaid Workers |publisher=AlterNet |date=2011-11-27 |accessdate=March 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a report released on November 26, 2011, a [[Palm Beach County]] organization, People Engaged in Active Community Efforts (PEACE), sent postcards to [[Macy's]] and [[Bealls (Florida)|Bealls]] executives as a form of protest. The Florida Retail Federation had recently proposed a bill to block a wage theft ordinance in their county, which was intended to create a system that would speed the investigation and processing of wage theft reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/palm-beach/pb-wage-theft-macys-20111126,0,1398136.story |title=Topic Galleries - South Florida wage theft macys |publisher=Sun-sentinel |date= 26 November 2011|accessdate=March 4, 2012|archive-date= November 29, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129212218/http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/palm-beach/pb-wage-theft-macys-20111126,0,1398136.story}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 study by the Iowa Policy Project calculated that dishonest employers defraud Iowa workers out of about $600 million annually in wages. State Senator [[Tony Bisignano]], Democrat from [[Des Moines]] and Senator [[William Dotzler]], a Democrat from [[Waterloo, Iowa]], proposed a bill to strengthen wage law enforcement on January 28, 2015, "since Iowa's wage theft laws are so weak they are impossible to enforce". The Iowa Association of Business and Industry opposed the bill, saying that resources for enforcement should be the focus instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=William Petroski|title=Senate Democrats offer plan to stop Iowa wage theft|url=http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2015/01/27/iowa-wage-theft-senate/22430863/|accessdate=29 January 2015|work=DesMoinesRegister|publisher=Gannett|date=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 report by Middlesex University and Trust for London revealed that at least 2 million workers in Britain are losing an estimated £3 billion in unpaid holiday pay and wages per year. It suggested that withholding holiday pay, not paying wages and workers losing a couple of hours money per week are some of the deliberate strategies used by employers to improve their profits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Unpaid Britain |url=https://www.trustforlondon.org.uk/publications/unpaid-britain-wage-default-british-labour-market/ |website=Trust for London |accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Documentation ===
In the United States, the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] (FLSA) requires employers to keep detailed records regarding the identity of workers and hours worked for all workers who are protected under federal [[minimum wage law]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs21.htm|title =Fact Sheet #21: Recordkeeping Requirements under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) |date = July 2008|accessdate = |website = |publisher = US Department of Labor}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=&amp;SID=6ed1b6e0e73541547a3ca78d87ee2663&amp;r=PART&amp;n=29y3.1.1.1.13#29:3.1.1.1.13.1.89.1|title =Labor.PART 516—RECORDS TO BE KEPT BY EMPLOYERS |work= Code of Federal Regulations|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most states require that employers also provide each worker with documentation every pay period detailing that worker's hours, wages and deductions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.thehrspecialist.com/38703/Pay_Statements__50_State_Laws.hr?cat=compensation_and_benefits|title =Pay Statements: 50 State Laws |date = August 11, 2011|accessdate = |website=HR Specialist|publisher = Business Management Daily, division of Capitol Information Group, Inc. }}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=January 2015}} As of September 2011 [[Arkansas]], [[Florida]], [[Louisiana]], [[Mississippi]], [[Nebraska]], [[South Dakota]], [[Tennessee]] and [[Virginia]] did not require this documentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://blog.primepay.com/payroll-business-experts-blog/bid/33887/What-States-Require-Printed-Pay-Statements|title =What States Require Printed Pay Statements? |date = |accessdate = |website = blog.primepay.com|publisher =PrimePay, LLC.  }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=January 2015}} A 2008 survey of wage theft from workers in [[Illinois]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[California]] found that 57% of low wage workers did not receive this required documentation and that workers who were paid in cash or on a weekly rate were more likely to experience wage theft.&lt;ref name="Broken Laws, Unprotected Workers" /&gt; Anecdotal evidence suggests that tip theft, which is a legally complex issue distinct from wage theft and not necessarily under the control of the same laws governing the payment of wages,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.texasemploymentlawblog.com/2013/05/articles/overtime-law-1/courts-make-it-more-difficult-for-employees-to-pursue-tip-theft-by-employers/|title =Courts Make it More Difficult for Employees to Pursue Tip Theft by Employers |date = May 2013 |accessdate = |website = texasemploymentlawblog.com|publisher =texasemploymentlaw }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=January 2015}} may also be common in instances where employer record keeping does not comply with the law.&lt;ref name="Ruggles"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ruggles Waitstaff Stages Walk-Out, Alleging Non-Payment of Tips: UPDATE|url=http://blogs.houstonpress.com/eating/2011/12/ruggles_waitstaff_stages_walk-.php|accessdate=May 29, 2012|newspaper=Houston Press|date=December 5, 2011|author=Katharine Shilcutt|format=blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Penalties and sanctions ===
When the [[Wage and Hour Division]] (WHD) receives reports of violations, it works to ensure that employers change their work practices and pay back missed wages to the employees. [[Willful violation|Willful violators]] can face fines up to $10,000 upon their first conviction with [[imprisonment]] resulting from future convictions. In regards to [[child labor laws]], an employer can face a fine of up to $11,000 per minor. In 2012 the Wage and Hour Division collected $280 million in back wages for 308,000 workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.dol.gov/dol/budget/2014/PDF/FY2014BIB.pdf|title = FY 2014 Department of Labor Budget in Brief|date = |accessdate= |website = |publisher = US Department of Labor|page = 47}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, there are 1,100 federal investigators for 135 million workers in more than 7 million businesses.&lt;ref name=Carpenter&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carpenter|first1=Zoë|title=Low-Wage Workers' Newest Ally Is a Washington Bureaucrat|url=http://www.thenation.com/blog/180462/low-wage-workers-newest-ally-washington-bureaucrat#|accessdate=July 2, 2014|publisher=The Nation|date=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ratio of labor enforcement agents to U.S. workers has decreased tenfold since the inception of the FLSA from one for every 11,000 workers in 1941&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-08-05/linkedin-stiffed-its-own-employees-agrees-to-pay-millions|title = LinkedIn Stiffed Its Own Employees, Agrees to Pay Millions|last = Josh Eidelson|first = Josh Eidelson|date = 5 August 2014|work = Businessweek|accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; to one for every 123,000 workers in 2014.&lt;ref name="Carpenter" /&gt;

In February 2010 [[Miami-Dade County, Florida]] became the first jurisdiction in America to ban wage theft with an ordinance passed unanimously by the [[county commission]]. Prior to the ordinance, wage theft was called "the crime wave that almost no one talks about".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/stopwagetheft/in-the-news|title=Stop Wage Theft — In the News |publisher=South Florida Interfaith Worker Justice |date= |accessdate=March 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
