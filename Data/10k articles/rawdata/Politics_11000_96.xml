The '''American Union of Associationists''' (AUA) was a national organization of supporters of the economic ideas of [[Charles Fourier]] (1772–1837) in the [[United States of America]]. Organized in 1846 in [[New York City]] as a [[federation]] of independent local [[Fourierism|Fourierist]] groups, the AUA published a weekly magazine called ''The Harbinger'' and published more than 70 books and pamphlets, which helped it to enjoy a brief moment of influence spreading the ideas of [[communitarianism]] to a circle of leading intellectuals. 

The failure of the Fourierist model in its various practical incarnations led to the rapid dissolution of the Fourierist movement and with it the AUA, however, and the organization rapidly atrophied as the decade of the 1840s drew to a close. The final issue of the official AUA organ, ''The Harbinger,'' was published in February 1849 and the final national meeting of the organization took place in 1851.

==Organizational history==
===Background===

The 1840 publication of the book ''Social Destiny of Man'' by [[Albert Brisbane]] (1809–1890) and subsequent publication of a regular column by him in the pages of [[Horace Greeley|Horace Greeley's]] ''[[New York Tribune]]'' ushered in a period of popular enthusiasm for the ideas of [[Charles Fourier]] in the United States.&lt;ref name=Guarneri2&gt;Carl J. Guarneri, ''The Utopian Alternative: Fourierism in Nineteenth-Century America.'' Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1991; pg. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; 

American Fourierists were divided between the bookish advocates of "pure" [[Fourierism]] such as Brisbane, [[Osborne Macdaniel]], and [[Parke Godwin (journalist)|Parke Godwin]] — who advocated for the establishment of very specific Fourierist "phalanx" (commune), properly funded and containing between 1600 and 1800 people — and those who sought immediate implementation of Fourierist cooperative ideas at whatever size determined by available funds and the number of committed participants.&lt;ref&gt;Guarneri, ''The Utopian Alternative,'' pp. 227-228.&lt;/ref&gt; These practical communitarians, exemplified by [[George Ripley (transcendentalist)|George Ripley]] and his [[transcendentalism|transcendentalist]] experiment near Boston called [[Brook Farm]], initially held sway. 

In the years 1843 and 1844 a [[boom and bust|faddish boom]] saw the launch of more than two dozen Fourierism "Associations" (communal economic units) in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]. To this were added various "Fourierist clubs" scattered across the country.&lt;ref name=Guarneri227&gt;Guarneri, ''The Utopian Alternative,'' pg. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these efforts proved short-lived and by 1846 the Fourierist movement was already in retreat.&lt;ref name=Guarneri227 /&gt; 

Committed believers in Fourier's ideas did not see a structural cause to the mass failure of Fourierist "phalanxes" (communes) however, instead concentrating on the obvious underfinancing and haphazard operation of the first experiments in communalism. Intent on making a new start, Fourierist leaders sought to create a national organization to share ideas through publications, raise funds, and to concentrate efforts onto the formation of a single properly founded phalanx which would serve as a practical model for emulation.&lt;ref name=Guarneri227 /&gt; The American Union of Associationists (AUA) was the organization established as the mechanism for coordinating and refocusing Fourierist efforts in America.

===Regional conferences===
[[File:George Ripley.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Unitarian minister George Ripley (1802-1880), whose Brook Farm was one of the most prominent communal experiments of the 1840s.]]

Previous efforts to bring together Fourierist Associations were regional in nature and oriented towards the immediate creation of phalanxes, with three conferences taking place in 1843 and 1844 — one each for the Midwest, [[New York City]], and [[New England]].&lt;ref name=Guarneri230&gt;Guarneri, ''The Utopian Alternative,'' pg. 230.&lt;/ref&gt; The so-called Western Fourier Convention, held in [[Pittsburgh]] in September 1843, was intended to concentrate the efforts of participants upon one "Model Western Association" but owing to personal jealousies, local rivalries, and fundamental philosophical differences ultimately lead to the formation of four small and impoverished experiments in the states of [[Ohio]] and [[Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;Guarneri, ''The Utopian Alternative,'' pp. 230-231.&lt;/ref&gt; Three of these died in the crib, with only one lasting past 1846.&lt;ref&gt;William Alfred Hinds, ''American Communities and Co-operative Colonies.'' Second Edition. Chicago, IL: Charles H. Kerr &amp; Co., 1908; pg. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second regional gathering, held in December 1843, was held in [[Boston]] under the auspices of the Brook Farm transcendentalists.&lt;ref name=Guarneri231 /&gt; It was at this gathering that the Brook Farm principals announced their formal conversion to the ideas of Fourierism.&lt;ref name=Guarneri231 /&gt; Plans were made to coordinate the activities of Brook Farm with the Christian [[Hopedale Community]] and the [[Ross Farm (Northampton, Massachusetts)|Northampton Association of Education and Industry]] (Ross Farm) through quarterly meetings.&lt;ref&gt;Guarneri, ''The Utopian Alternative,'' pp. 231-232.&lt;/ref&gt; Three such conclaves were held before the idea was abandoned in October 1844 due to the divergent interests of the three communal experiments.&lt;ref name=Guarneri232&gt;Guarneri, ''The Utopian Alternative,'' pg. 232.&lt;/ref&gt; The Boston convention also led to the formation in January 1844 of a formal regional organization, the New England Fourier Society, in which Brisbane and [[William Henry Channing]] played a leading role.&lt;ref name=Guarneri232 /&gt;

Efforts in Western New York proved somewhat fruitful, with a March 1844 meeting in [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] resulting in the formation of a group called the American Industrial Union (AIU), attended by representatives of seven phalanxes.&lt;ref name=Guarneri231&gt;Guarneri, ''The Utopian Alternative,'' pg. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; The group opened an office in Rochester in May and attempted to aid its member Associations through cooperative purchasing of supplies and coordinating trade of the products of each.&lt;ref name=Guarneri231 /&gt; The AIU soon was forced to terminate due to the rapid collapse of its member phalanxes, however, although the idea behind the organization made a lasting impression on prominent Fourierist leaders.&lt;ref name=Guarneri231 /&gt;

These regional meetings were followed by a first attempt at a truly national conclave, with New York Fourierist leaders issuing a call for a "General Convention of the Friends of Association in the United States," held in New York City from April 4-6, 1844.&lt;ref name=Guarneri232 /&gt;

'''Andries Tatane''' (22 February 1978 – 13 April 2011) was a 33-year-old South African citizen who was shot and killed by police officers during a [[Protest in South Africa|service delivery protest]] in [[Ficksburg]]. Seven police officers accused of his murder and assault were acquitted in the Ficksburg Regional Court in March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Court acquits police officers in Andries Tatane case|url=http://www.bdlive.co.za/national/2013/03/28/court-acquits-police-officers-in-andries-tatane-case|accessdate=11 April 2013|newspaper=Business Day|date=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tatane: So many questions remain |url=http://www.citypress.co.za/news/tatane-so-many-questions-remain/ |accessdate=11 April 2013 |newspaper=City Press |date=31 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410192628/http://www.citypress.co.za/news/tatane-so-many-questions-remain/ |archivedate=10 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Andries was a member of the [[African National Congress|ANC]] until 2008 when he left the ANC to join the breakaway party [[Congress of the People (South African political party)|COPE]]. In the months before he died he left COPE to join the Meqheleng Concerned Citizens (MCC), an autonomous local community organisation.&lt;ref name=MGWhoWasAT&gt;{{cite news|last=Sosibo|first=Kwanele|title=Who was Andries Tatane?|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2011-04-21-who-was-andries-tatane|accessdate=16 August 2011|newspaper=Mail &amp; Guardian|date=21 April 2011|quote="He was a very brilliant student, a pioneer by nature. He was very skilled in initiating things that would benefit others. He wanted to see all the people freed from unemployment and illiteracy."}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a mathematics teacher, a community activist, journalist, community newspaper publisher and possible independent candidate for the municipal elections due to take place in May 2011.  He was married to Rose Tatane.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whoswhosa.co.za/andries-tatane Andries Tatane entry at ''Who's Who of Southern Africa'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events surrounding his death==

On 13 April 2011, Andries Tatane, together with 4,000 other protesters, took to the streets and marched to [[Setsoto Local Municipality|Setsoto Municipal Offices]] in Ficksburg, Free State, South Africa to protest against poor service delivery in the area. The protesters were met by [[South African Police Service|police members]] who attempted to disperse the crowd with water cannons. While some arrested protesters were being bundled into police vans, Tatane tried to argue with the police and to block a water cannon vehicle, at which point he was grabbed around one arm by a police officer. Tatane was seen to pull his arm away from the officer who then started to beat him with a baton. Tatane appeared to move aggressively towards this officer. Four or five other police officers then pulled him away and began to kick and beat him with batons. During this time he was twice shot in the chest. Tatane collapsed shortly after and died on the scene 20 minutes later.

While Tatane's death as a result of police action during a protest is by no means a unique event in South Africa, it had notably garnered greater nationwide attention than any previous such occurrence. One of the main reasons for this was the fact that the entire incident was filmed on T.V. cameras and later broadcast during the prime time evening news of the national broadcaster, the SABC.

==Aftermath==

Following Tatane's death, there has been public outrage about the manner in which he died.&lt;ref&gt;Several opinion pieces in South African newsmedia:
*{{cite news|last=Mahabane|first=Itumeleng|title=Death in Ficksburg shows how we value life|url=http://www.businessday.co.za/articles/Content.aspx?id=140341|newspaper=Business Day|date=15 April 2011}}

Tatane's death has been described as "a watershed moment in public perceptions of state violence after apartheid".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedailymaverick.co.za/opinionista/2011-05-05-it-is-time-to-be-offended It is time to be offended], Herman Wasserman &amp; Sean Jacobs, ''The Daily Maverick'', 8 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

An investigation into his death was launched by the [[Independent Complaints Directorate]]'s commission. The [[South African Police Service]] has also launched their own internal investigation into the matter. The death of Tatane has placed both the issue of rising anger over a lack of service delivery as well as police brutality in the media spotlight, with comparisons being drawn&lt;ref name=Sowetan&gt;{{cite news|last=Mngxitama|first=Andile|title=Tatane's death underlines need for government to deliver|url=http://www.sowetanlive.co.za/columnists/2011/04/19/tatane-s-death-underlines-need-for-government-to-deliver|accessdate=23 April 2011|newspaper=The Sowetan|date=19 April 2011|quote=Hector Pieterson was the symbol of the 1976 uprising in the same way that Tatane is the symbol of service delivery struggles today.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to the deaths of [[Hector Pieterson]] and [[Steve Biko]] at the hands of police during the height of [[apartheid]].

It has also emerged that this was not an isolated incident&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/amnesty-red-flag-police-brutality-1.1068706 Amnesty red flag police brutality], Craig Dodds, 13 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/region/south-africa/report-2011 Amnesty International South Africa Report 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; and that the ICD has investigated 1,769 separate incidents of people dying in police custody or as a result of police action in 2010.&lt;ref name=M&amp;GIsolatedIncident&gt;{{cite news|last=Ilham|first=Rawoot|title=Protester's death not an isolated case|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2011-04-15-protesters-death-not-an-isolated-case/|date=15 April 2011|accessdate=23 April 2011|newspaper=Mail &amp; Guardian|author2=Underhill, Glynnis|quote=Video footage of the protester, identified as 33-year-old Andries Tatane, caused shockwaves when it was broadcast on SABC (South African Broadcasting Corporation) prime time news on Wednesday evening.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  National Police Commissioner [[Bheki Cele]]'s statement in late August 2009 that police officers should be able to "shoot to kill"&lt;ref name=IOLShootToKill&gt;{{cite news|last=Carvin|first=Goldstone|title=Police must shoot to kill, worry later - Cele|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/police-must-shoot-to-kill-worry-later-cele-1.453587|accessdate=23 April 2011|newspaper=IOL News|date=1 August 2009|quote=Cele's philosophy on shooting before being shot, which he has preached in KwaZulu-Natal during his time as MEC for community safety, has led to the province having more deaths in police custody under review than any other province during the past year. There were 258 deaths in custody in KZN during 2008/2009 - 83 more than the previous year.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  without worrying about the consequences will undoubtedly be brought to the forefront again.

The [[African National Congress|ANC]]'s National Spokesperson, [[Jackson Mthembu]], condemned the brutality, but also chastised the [[SABC]] for broadcasting the footage during the prime time news, citing the fact that it might have upset sensitive viewers,&lt;ref name=M&amp;GIsolatedIncident/&gt; calling on the [[Independent Communications Authority of South Africa]] (ICASA) to investigate the SABC's editorial decision.  Mthembu has been one of the most vocal supporters of planned legislation to introduce a [[Media Appeals Tribunal]] to govern the South African media;&lt;ref name=M&amp;GMediaTribunal&gt;{{cite news|last=Mandy|first=Rossouw|title=ANC backtracks on media tribunal|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2011-01-14-anc-backtracks-on-media-tribunal/|accessdate=23 April 2011|newspaper=Mail &amp; Guardian|date=14 January 2011|quote=In July last year Mthembu was adamant there should be even harsher punishment for errant journalists. "If you have to go to prison, let it be. If you have to pay millions for defamation, let it be. If journalists have to be fired because they don't contribute to the South Africa we want, let it be," he told the Mail &amp; Guardian.}}&lt;/ref&gt; legislation which is currently held in abeyance.

After visiting the Tatane family in Meqheleng, Ficksburg, on 19 April 2011, [[Archbishop of Cape Town|Anglican Archbishop of Cape Town]], Dr [[Thabo Makgoba]], directed attention to the lack of justice and delivery on promises which had preceded the incident and points out the irony of the protesters having been met with water cannons, "attacked with the very thing they don’t have the pleasure of in their daily lives."  He called on the Minister of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs, [[Sicelo Shiceka]], to "visit and see the appalling conditions under which God’s people live" and the Minister of Human Settlements, [[Tokyo Sexwale]], to "provide houses".  He added that "Minister [[Nathi Mthethwa]] and President [[Jacob Zuma|Zuma]] should publicly apologise for this embarrassing act of aggression by police."&lt;ref&gt;[http://archbishop.anglicanchurchsa.org/2011/04/visit-to-ficksburg-and-tatane-family.html  Visit to Ficksburg and Tatane Family, by the Most Revd Dr Thabo Makgoba, Archbishop of Cape Town, blog dated 21 April 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Archbishop has subsequently said: "Let us affirm and call for a renaming of our police services back to 'safety and security' and not a police 'force', for this force seems to maim and kill rather than offer safety and security." &lt;ref&gt;[http://archbishop.anglicanchurchsa.org/2011/04/sermon-at-service-for-renewal-of-vows.html Archbishop Thabo Makgoba’s Sermon at the Service for the Renewal of Vows, Maundy Thursday, 21 April 2011, published 22 April]&lt;/ref&gt;

There was an election boycott in the area following Tatane's death.&lt;ref name="mg.co.za"&gt;[http://mg.co.za/article/2011-05-20-disillusioned-voters-snub-ficksburg-poll Disillusioned voters snub Ficksburg poll], KWANELE SOSIBO, ''Mail &amp; Guardian'', 20 May 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2011 it was reported that the Meqheleng Concerned Citizens group was a credible structure with growing influence.&lt;ref name="mg.co.za"/&gt; However, by December 2011 it had degenerated to the point of being described as "a toothless organisation led by calculating tenderpreneurs".&lt;ref&gt;[http://mg.co.za/article/2011-12-23-ficksburg-the-dorpie-where-revolution-was-a-false-alarm Ficksburg: The dorpie where revolution was a false alarm], by Kwanele Sosibo, ''Mail &amp; Guardian'', 23 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of police officers were charged with Tatane's murder but they were found not guilty on the grounds that Tatane's murderers could not be identified as they were wearing helmets. However, a British journalist was easily able to identify his killers from video footage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2013-07-22-police-brutality-and-the-mass-amnesia-that-threatens-to-obscure-it/#.UeylJY3I2VI Police brutality, and the mass amnesia that threatens to obscure it], Inigo Gilmore, ''Daily Maverick'', 22 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural references to Tatane==

'''Anti-fascism''' is opposition to [[Fascism|fascist]] ideologies, groups and individuals. The anti-fascist movement began in a few European countries in the 1920s, and eventually spread to other countries around the world. It was at its most significant shortly before and during [[World War II]], where the fascist [[Axis powers]] were opposed by many countries forming the [[Allies of World War II]] and dozens of [[resistance movement]]s worldwide. Anti-fascism has been an element of movements holding many different political positions, including [[social democracy|social democratic]], [[nationalism|nationalist]], [[liberalism|liberal]], [[conservatism|conservative]], [[communism|communist]], [[Marxism|Marxist]], [[capitalism|capitalist]], [[anarchism|anarchist]], [[socialism|socialist]], and [[centrism|centrist]] viewpoints.

==Origins==
With the development and spread of [[Italian Fascism]], i.e. original fascism, the [[National Fascist Party]]'s ideology was met with increasingly militant opposition by Italian communists and socialists. Organizations such as the [[Arditi del Popolo]]&lt;ref name=Arditi&gt;[http://www.romacivica.net/anpiroma/antifascismo/antifascismo3a.html Gli Arditi del Popolo (Birth)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807125621/http://www.romacivica.net/anpiroma/antifascismo/antifascismo3a.html |date=7 August 2008 }} {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Italian Anarchist Union&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070823000013/http://ita.anarchopedia.org/Unione_Anarchica_Italiana "Unione Anarchica Italiana" at italian anarchopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; emerged between 1919–1921, to combat the nationalist and fascist surge of the post-World War I period.

In the words of historian [[Eric Hobsbawm]], as fascism developed and spread, a "nationalism of the left" developed in those nations threatened by Italian [[irredentism]] (e.g. in the [[Balkans]], and [[Albania]] in particular).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hobsbawm|first1=Eric|title=The Age of Extremes|date=1992|publisher=Vintage|isbn=978-0394585758|pages=136–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the outbreak of World War II, the [[Albanian resistance during World War II|Albanian]] and [[Main National Liberation Committee for Serbia|Serbian]] resistances were instrumental in antifascist action and underground resistance. This combination of irreconcilable nationalisms and leftist partisans constitute the earliest roots of European anti-fascism. Less militant forms of anti-fascism arose later. For instance, during the 1930s in Britain, "Christians – especially the [[Church of England]] – provided both a language of opposition to fascism and inspired anti-fascist action".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lawson|first=Tom |title=Varieties of Anti-Fascism: Britain in the Inter-War Period|year=2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|language=English|isbn=978-1-349-28231-9|pages=119–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The diversity of political entities that share only their anti-fascism has prompted the historian [[Norman Davies]] to argue in his book ''[[Europe at War 1939–1945: No Simple Victory]]'' that anti-fascism does not offer a coherent political ideology, but rather that it is an "empty vessel". Davies further asserts that the concept of anti-fascism is a "mere political dance" created by [[Josef Stalin]] and spread by Soviet propaganda organs in an attempt to create the false impression that Western democrats by joining the USSR in the opposition to fascism could in general align themselves politically with communism. The motive would be to lend legitimacy to the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] and was done at the time the USSR was pursuing a policy of [[collective security]]. Davies goes on to point out that with [[Winston Churchill]] as a notable exception, the concept of anti-fascism gained widespread support in the West, except that its credibility suffered a serious but temporary blow while the USSR and [[Nazi Germany]] coordinated their wars of aggression in Eastern Europe under their [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Norman |last= Davies |authorlink= Norman Davies |title= Europe at War 1939–1945: No Simple Victory |year= 2006 |location= London |publisher= [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] |isbn= 9780333692851 |oclc= 70401618 |pages= [https://books.google.com/books?id=9P_uQ2qeFUkC&amp;pg=PT53 54–55]|title-link= Europe at War 1939–1945: No Simple Victory }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Anti-fascist movements emerged first in Italy, during the rise of [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]], but soon spread to other European countries and then globally. In the early period, Communist, socialist, anarchist and Christian workers and intellectuals were involved. Until 1928, the period of the [[United front]], there was significant collaboration between the Communists and non-Communist anti-fascists. In 1928, the [[Comintern]] instituted its [[ultra-left]] "[[Third Period]]" policies, ending co-operation with other left groups, and denouncing social democrats as "[[social fascists]]". From 1934 until the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], the Communists pursued a [[Popular Front]] approach, of building broad-based coalitions with liberal and even conservative anti-fascists. As fascism consolidated its power, and especially during [[World War II]], anti-fascism largely took the form of [[Partisan (military)|Partisan]] or [[Resistance during World War II|Resistance]] movements.

===Italy: against Fascism and Mussolini===
{{See also|Italian resistance movement}}
[[File:Flag of the Arditi del Popolo Battalion.svg|thumb|right|Flag of the ''[[Arditi del Popolo]]'', a militant anti-fascist group founded in 1921]]
In Italy, [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] regime used the term "anti-fascist" to describe its opponents. Mussolini's [[secret police]] was officially known as ''Organizzazione per la Vigilanza e la Repressione dell'Antifascismo'' (OVRA), [[Italian language|Italian]] for "[[Organization for Vigilance and Repression of Anti-Fascism]]").

In the [[Kingdom of Italy]] in the 1920s, anti-fascists—many from the [[labour movement]]—fought against the violent [[Blackshirts]] and against the rise of fascist leader Benito Mussolini. After the  [[Italian Socialist Party]] (PSI) signed a  [[Pact of Pacification|pacification pact]] with Mussolini and his [[Fascist Revolutionary Party]] (PFR) on 3 August 1921,&lt;ref&gt;Charles F. Delzell, edit., ''Mediterranean Fascism 1919-1945'', New York, NY, Walker and Company, 1971, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; and trade unions adopted a legalist and pacified strategy, members of the workers' movement who disagreed with this strategy formed the ''[[Arditi del popolo]]''. The [[Italian General Confederation of Labour|General Confederation of Labour]] (CGT) and the PSI refused to officially recognize the anti-fascist militia, while the [[Italian Communist Party]] (PCI) ordered its members to quit the organization. The PCI organized some militant groups, but their actions were relatively minor, and the party maintained a non-violent, legalist strategy. The [[Anarchism in Italy|Italian anarchist]] [[Severino Di Giovanni]], who exiled himself to [[Immigration to Argentina|Argentina]] following the 1922 [[March on Rome]], organized several bombings against the Italian fascist community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anarchist_century.tripod.com/timeline.html |title=Anarchist Century |publisher=Anarchist_century.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian liberal anti-fascist [[Benedetto Croce]] wrote ''[[Manifesto of the Anti-Fascist Intellectuals]]'', which was published in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;David Ward ''Antifascisms: Cultural Politics in Italy, 1943–1946''&lt;/ref&gt; Another notable Italian liberal anti-fascist around that time was [[Piero Gobetti]].&lt;ref&gt;James Martin, 'Piero Gobetti's Agonistic Liberalism', ''History of European Ideas'', '''32''', (2006), pp. 205–222.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:An Italian partisan in Florence, 14 August 1944. TR2282.jpg|thumb|An [[Italian partisan]] in [[Florence]], 14 August 1944.]]
Between 1920 and 1943, several anti-fascist movements were active among the [[Slovenes]] and [[Croats]] in the territories annexed to Italy after [[World War I]], known as the [[Julian March]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Milica Kacin Wohinz]], [[Jože Pirjevec]], ''Storia degli sloveni in Italia : 1866–1998'' (Venice: Marsilio, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Milica Kacin Wohinz, ''Narodnoobrambno gibanje primorskih Slovencev : 1921–1928'' (Trieste: Založništvo tržaškega tiska, 1977)&lt;/ref&gt; The most influential was the militant insurgent organization [[TIGR]], which carried out numerous sabotages, as well as attacks on representatives of the Fascist Party and the military.&lt;ref&gt;[[Milica Kacin Wohinz]],  ''Prvi antifašizem v Evropi'' (Koper: Lipa, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mira Cenčič, ''TIGR : Slovenci pod Italijo in TIGR na okopih v boju za narodni obstoj'' (Ljubljana: Mladinska knjiga, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the underground structure of the organization was discovered and dismantled by the [[Organization for Vigilance and Repression of Anti-Fascism]] (OVRA) in 1940 and 1941,&lt;ref&gt;Vid Vremec, Pinko Tomažič in drugi tržaški proces 1941 (Trieste: Založništvo tržaškega tiska, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; and after June 1941, most of its former activists joined the [[Slovene Partisans]].

During [[World War II]], many members of the [[Italian resistance]] left their homes and went to live in the mountainside, fighting against Italian fascists and [[Nazi Germany|German Nazi]] soldiers. Many cities in  Italy, including [[Turin]], [[Naples]] and [[Milan]], were freed by anti-fascist uprisings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://darbysrangers.tripod.com/id102.htm |title=Intelligence and Operational Support for the Anti-Nazi Resistance |publisher=Darbysrangers.tripod.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anti-fascist resistance emerged within the [[Slovene minority in Italy (1920–1947)]], who the Fascists meant to [[Italianization|deprive]] of their culture, language and ethnicity.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} The 1920 burning of the [[National Hall, Trieste|National Hall in Trieste]], the [[Slovene minority in Italy|Slovene]] center in the multi-cultural and multi-ethnic [[Trieste]] by the Blackshirts,&lt;ref name="Primorski90let2010"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.primorski.eu/dossiers/dossier/10/31/130144/|title=90 let od požiga Narodnega doma v Trstu |trans-title=90 Years From the Arson of the National Hall in Trieste|quote=Požig Narodnega doma ali šentjernejska noč tržaških Slovencev in Slovanov [Arson of the National Hall or the St. Bartholomew's Night of the Triestine Slovenes and Slavs]|newspaper=Primorski dnevnik [The Littoral Daily]|language=Slovenian|year=2010|pages=14–15 |id={{COBISS|ID=11683661}} |accessdate=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benito Mussolini who, at the time, was yet to become Duce, praised as a being a "masterpiece of the Triestine fascism" ({{lang|it|capolavoro del fascismo triestino...}}).&lt;ref name="Sestani2012-02"&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.provincia.lucca.it/scuolapace/uploads/quaderni/ricordo2012.pdf |title=I profugi istriani, dalmati e fiumani a Lucca |language=Italian |trans-title=The Istrian, Dalmatian and Rijeka Refugees in Lucca |publisher=Instituto storico della Resistenca e dell'Età Contemporanea in Provincia di Lucca |chapter=Il confine orientale: una terra, molti esodi |trans-chapter=The Eastern Border: One Land, Multiple Exoduses |date=10 February 2012|editor=Sestani, Armando|pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only in multi-ethnic areas, but also in the areas where the population was exclusively Slovene, the use of Slovene language in public places, including churches, was forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=nOALhEZkYDkC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;dq=%22signed+a+treaty+on+November+12,+1920,+at+Rapallo&amp;q=%22signed%20a%20treaty%20on%20November%2012%2C%201920%2C%20at%20Rapallo |last=Hehn |first=Paul N. |title=A low dishonest decade: the great powers, Eastern Europe, and the economic origins of World War II, 1930–1941 |year=2005 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |pages=44–45 |isbn=978-0-8264-1761-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children, if they spoke Slovene, were punished by Italian teachers who were brought by the Fascist State from [[Southern Italy]]. The Slovene teachers, writers, and clergy were sent to the other side of Italy.

The first anti-fascist organization, called [[TIGR]], was formed by Slovenes and Croats in 1927 in order to fight Fascist violence. Its guerrilla fight continued into the late 1920s and 1930s when by the mid-1930s, already 70,000 Slovenes fled Italy mostly to [[Slovenia]] (then part of Yugoslavia) and [[South America]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The Slovene anti-fascist resistance in [[Yugoslavia]] during World War II was led by [[Liberation Front of the Slovenian People]]. The [[Province of Ljubljana]], occupied by Italian Fascists, saw the deportation of 25.000 people, equaling 7.5% of the total population, filling up [[Rab concentration camp]] and [[Gonars concentration camp]] and other [[Italian concentration camps]].

{{See also|German resistance to Nazism}}

In the 1920s and 1930s in the [[Weimar Republic]], [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]] and [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] members advocated violence and mass agitation amongst the [[working class]] to first stop the ''[[Freikorps]]'' movements in immediate post-WW I Germany, and not long thereafter, [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Nazi Party]]. [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] revolutionary [[Leon Trotsky]] wrote:
{{quote|[F]ighting squads must be created ... nothing increases the insolence of the fascists so much as 'flabby [[pacifism]]' on the part of the workers' organisations ... [It is] political cowardice [to deny that] without organised combat detachments, the most heroic masses will be smashed bit by bit by fascist gangs."&lt;ref&gt;quoted ''Fighting Talk'' no.22 October 1999, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There were several anti-Nazi militant and paramilitary groups. These included the [[SPD|Social Democrat]]-dominated [[Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold]] (formed in February 1924), the [[KPD|Communist]] paramilitary and propaganda organisation [[Roter Frontkämpferbund]] (Red Front Fighters League or RFB, formed in summer 1924) and the Communist [[Kampfbund gegen den Faschismus]] (Fighting-Alliance against Fascism, formed in 1930).&lt;ref&gt;Eve Rosenhaft, ''Beating the Fascists?: The German Communists and Political Violence 1929-1933'', Cambridge University Press, 25 Aug 1983, pp.3-4&lt;/ref&gt; The Roter Front was a paramilitary organization affiliated with the Communist Party of Germany that engaged in street fights with the Nazi [[Sturmabteilung]]. Its first leader was [[Ernst Thälmann]], who would later die in a concentration camp and become widely honored in [[East Germany]] as an anti-fascist and socialist. In 1932, during the [[United Front]] period, [[Antifaschistische Aktion]] was formed as a broad-based alliance in which Social Democrats, Communists and others could fight legal repression and engage in self-defence against Nazi paramilitaries.&lt;ref&gt;Eve Rosenhaft, ''Beating the Fascists?: The German Communists and Political Violence 1929-1933'', Cambridge University Press, 25 Aug 1983, p.81&lt;/ref&gt; Its two-flag logo, designed by [[Max Keilson]] and [[Max Gebhard]], is still widely used as a symbol of militant anti-fascists globally.&lt;ref&gt;Loren Balhorn [https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/05/antifascist-movements-hitler-nazis-kpd-spd-germany-cold-war The Lost History of Antifa]" ''Jacobin'' May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain: Civil War with the Nationalists===
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2010}}


In Spain, large-scale anti-fascist movements were first seen in the 1930s, before and during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. The [[Second Spanish Republic|republican]] government and army, the [[Antifascist Worker and Peasant Militias]] (MAOC) linked to the [[Communist Party of Spain (main)|Communist Party]] (PCE),&lt;ref name="Histo"&gt;De Miguel, Jesús y Sánchez, Antonio: ''Batalla de Madrid,'' in his ''Historia Ilustrada de la Guerra Civil Española.'' Alcobendas, Editorial LIBSA, 2006, pp. 189–221.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[International Brigades]], the [[Workers' Party of Marxist Unification]] (POUM), [[Anarchism in Spain|Spanish anarchist]] [[militias]], such as the [[Iron Column]] and the autonomous governments of [[Catalonia]] and the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], fought the rise of [[Francisco Franco]] with military force. The [[Friends of Durruti]], associated with the [[Federación Anarquista Ibérica]] (FAI), were a particularly militant group. Thousands of people from many countries went to Spain in support of the anti-fascist cause, joining units such as the [[Abraham Lincoln Brigade]], the [[British Battalion]], the [[Dabrowski Battalion]], the [[Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion]], the [[Palafox Battalion#Naftali Botwin Company|Naftali Botwin Company]] and the [[Thälmann Battalion]], including [[Winston Churchill]]'s nephew, [[Esmond Romilly]].&lt;ref&gt;Boadilla by [[Esmond Romilly]]. The Clapton Press Limited, London. 2018. {{ISBN|978-1999654306}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable anti-fascists who worked internationally against Franco included: [[George Orwell]] (who fought in the POUM militia and wrote ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]'' about this experience), [[Ernest Hemingway]] (a supporter of the International Brigades who wrote ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'' about this experience), and radical journalist [[Martha Gellhorn]].

Spanish anarchist [[guerrilla]] [[Francesc Sabaté Llopart]] fought against Franco's regime until the 1960s, from a base in France. The [[Spanish Maquis]], linked to the PCE, also fought the Franco regime long after the Spanish Civil war had ended.&lt;ref&gt;See "Wolf Moon" by [[Julio Llamazares]], Peter Owen Publications, London 2017 {{ISBN|978-0720619454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Members of the Maquis in La Tresorerie.jpg|thumb|[[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis]] members in 1944]]

In the 1920s and 1930s in the [[French Third Republic]], anti-fascists confronted aggressive [[far-right politics|far-right]] groups such as the [[Action Française]] movement in France, which dominated the [[Latin Quarter, Paris|Latin Quarter]] students' neighborhood.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} After fascism triumphed via invasion, the French Resistance ({{lang-fr|La Résistance française}}) or, more accurately, [[resistance movement]]s fought against the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] occupation and against the collaborationist [[Vichy France|Vichy régime]]. Résistance cells were small groups of armed men and women (called the [[maquis (World War II)|''maquis'']] in rural areas), who, in addition to their [[guerrilla warfare]] activities, were also publishers of [[underground press|underground newspapers and magazines]] such as ''[[Arbeiter und Soldat]]'' (''Worker and Soldier'') during World War 2, providers of first-hand intelligence information, and maintainers of escape networks.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

===United Kingdom: against Mosley's BUF===
The rise of [[Oswald Mosley]]'s [[British Union of Fascists]] (BUF) in the 1930s was challenged by the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]], [[socialism|socialists]] in the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and [[Independent Labour Party]], [[anarchism|anarchists]], [[Irish people|Irish]] [[Catholic]] dockmen and [[working class]] [[Jew]]s in [[East End of London|London's east end]]. A high point in the struggle was the [[Battle of Cable Street]], when thousands of eastenders and others turned out to stop the BUF from marching. Initially, the national Communist Party leadership wanted a mass demonstration at [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] in solidarity with [[Republican Spain]], instead of a mobilisation against the BUF, but local party activists argued against this. Activists rallied support with the slogan ''[[They shall not pass]],'' adopted from Republican Spain.

There were debates within the anti-fascist movement over tactics. While many east end ex-servicemen participated in violence against fascists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jacobs |first=Joe |title=Out of the Ghetto |location= London |publisher=Phoenix Press |year=1991 |origyear=1977 |url=http://libcom.org/tags/joe-jacobs}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communist Party leader [[Phil Piratin]] denounced these tactics and instead called for large demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;Phil Piratin ''Our Flag Stays Red''. London: Lawrence &amp; Wishart, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the militant anti-fascist movement, there was a smaller current of liberal anti-fascism in Britain; Sir [[Ernest Barker]], for example, was a notable English liberal anti-fascist in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Andrezj Olechnowicz, 'Liberal anti-fascism in the 1930s the case of Sir Ernest Barker', ''Albion'' 36, 2005, pp. 636–60&lt;/ref&gt;

During the United States [[Red Scare]] after the end of [[World War II]], the term "premature anti-fascist" came into currency to describe Americans who had strongly agitated or worked against fascism, such as by fighting for the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republicans]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]], before fascism was seen as a proximate and existential threat to the United States (which only occurred generally after the [[invasion of Poland]] by [[Nazi Germany]] and universally after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]).

Anti-fascist Italian expatriates in the United States founded the [[Mazzini Society]] in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]] in September 1939 to work toward ending Fascist rule in Italy. Political refugees from Mussolini's regime, they disagreed among themselves whether to ally with Communists and anarchists or to exclude them. The Mazzini Society joined together with other anti-Fascist Italian expatriates in the Americas at a conference in [[Montevideo]], Uruguay in 1942. They unsuccessfully promoted one of their members, [[Carlo Sforza]], to become the post-Fascist leader of a republican Italy. The Mazzini Society dispersed after the overthrow of Mussolini as most of its members returned to Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tirabassi |first1=Maddalena |title=Enemy Aliens or Loyal Americans?: the Mazzini Society and the Italian-American Communities |journal=Rivista di Studi Anglo-Americani |date=1984–1985 |issue=4–5 |pages=399–425}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Morrow |first1=Felix |authorlink1=Felix Morrow |title=Washington's Plans for Italy |journal=Fourth International |date=June 1943 |volume=4 |issue=6 |pages=175–179 |url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/morrow-felix/1943/06/italy.htm |accessdate=October 25, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After World War II===
{{See also|Post-WWII anti-fascism}}
The anti-fascist movements which emerged during the period of classical fascism, both liberal and militant, continued after the defeat of the Axis powers in response to the resilience and mutation of fascism in Europe and elsewhere. In Germany, for example, in 1944, as Nazi rule crumbled, veterans of the 1930s anti-fascist struggles formed "Antifaschistische Ausschüsse," "Antifaschistische Kommittees" or "[[Antifaschistische Aktion]]" groups (all typically abbreviated to [[Antifa movements|Antifa]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/05/antifascist-movements-hitler-nazis-kpd-spd-germany-cold-war|title=The Lost History of Antifa|last=Balhorn|first=Loren|date=8 May 2017|website=Jacobin|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom: against the NF and BNP===
After [[World War II]], Jewish [[war veteran]]s in the [[43 Group]] continued the tradition of militant confrontations with [[Oswald Mosley]]'s [[Union Movement]]. In the 1960s, the [[62 Group]] continued the struggle against [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title='Classic' Fascism and the New Radical Right in Western Europe: Comparisons and Contrasts|first=Diethelm |last=Prowe|journal=Contemporary European History|volume=3|issue=3|date=November 1994|pages=289–313 |jstor=20081528}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, fascist and far-right parties such as the [[National Front (United Kingdom)|National Front]] (NF) and [[British Movement]] (BM) were making significant gains electorally, and were increasingly bold in their public appearances. This was challenged in 1977 with the [[Battle of Lewisham]], when thousands of people disrupted an NF march in [[South London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://century.guardian.co.uk/1970-1979/Story/0,,106928,00.html |title=The real losers in Saturday's battle of Lewisham &amp;#124; 1970–1979 |work=century.guardian.co.uk |date= |accessdate=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, the [[Anti-Nazi League]] (ANL) was launched by the [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party]] (SWP). The ANL had a large-scale propaganda campaign and squads that attacked NF meetings and paper sales. The success of the ANL's campaigns contributed to the end of the NF's period of growth. During this period, there were also a number of black-led anti-fascist organisations, including the [[Campaign Against Racism and Fascism]] (CARF) and local groups like the [[Newham Monitoring Project]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150427225856/http://www.nmp.org.uk/timeline/ NMP’s History of Resisting Racism and Injustice]; Alastair Bonnett''Radicalism, Anti-Racism and Representation'', London: Routledge, 2013, p. 57; Nigel Copsey ''Anti-Fascism in Britain'', Springer, 1999, pp. 125–83&lt;/ref&gt;

The SWP disbanded the ANL in 1981, but many squad members refused to stop their activities. They were expelled from the SWP in 1981, many going on to found [[Red Action]]. The SWP used the term [[squadism]] to dismiss these militant anti-fascists as thugs. In 1985, some members of Red Action and the [[Anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalist]] [[Direct Action Movement]] launched [[Anti-Fascist Action (UK)|Anti-Fascist Action]] (AFA). Their founding document said "we are not fighting Fascism to maintain the status quo but to defend the interests of the working class".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amielandmelburn.org.uk/collections/soundings/14_53.pdf |format=PDF |title=Anti-Fascist Action: Radical resistance or rent-a-mob? |work=''Soundings'' – issue 14 Spring 2000 |publisher=Amielandmelburn.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;AFA (London) Constitution Part 1.4&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of people took part in AFA mobilisations, such as [[Remembrance Day]] demonstrations in 1986 and 1987, the Unity Carnival, the [[Battle of Cable Street]]'s 55th anniversary march in 1991, and the ''Battle of Waterloo'' against [[Blood and Honour]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skrewdriver.net/diamond.html |title=Diamond in the Dust – The Ian Stuart Biography |publisher=Skrewdriver.net |date= |accessdate=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 1995, some AFA mobilisations still occurred, such as against the NF in [[Dover]] in 1997 and 1998. However, AFA wound down its national organisation and some of its branches and had ceased to exist nationally by 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Nigel Copsey ''Anti-Fascism in Britain'' London: Routledge, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a surge in fascist activity across Europe from 1989 to 1991 after the collapse of Communism. In 1991, the [[Campaign Against Fascism in Europe]] (CAFE) coordinated a large militant protest against the visit to London by French right-wing leader, [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]]. This sparked a surge in anti-fascist organisations throughout Europe. In the UK alone, in 1992 a number of left-wing groups formed anti-fascist [[front organisation]]s, such as a re-launched ANL in 1992, the [[Socialist Party (England and Wales)|Socialist Party's]] [[Youth against Racism in Europe]] YRE, and the [[Revolutionary Communist Party (UK, 1978)|Revolutionary Communist Party's]] Workers Against Racism. A number of black-led organisations, along with the Labour Party Black Sections and the National Black Caucus, formed the Anti-Racist Alliance in 1991, which eventually became the [[National Assembly Against Racism]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barberis, John McHugh, Mike Tyldesley (26 July 2005) ''Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations: Parties, Groups and Movements of the 20th Century''. Continuum International Publishing Group. p. 107. {{ISBN|978-0-8264-5814-8}}; Stefano Fella, Carlo Ruzza (24 December 2012) ''Anti-Racist Movements in the EU: Between Europeanisation and National Trajectories''. Palgrave Macmillan. {{ISBN|978-0-230-29090-7}}, pp. 67–68&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2018, the Shadow Chancellor [[John McDonnell]] called for a revival of "an Anti-Nazi League-type cultural and political campaign" following a number of far-right and racist incidents in the UK, including fascist attacks on a socialist bookshop by members of the far-right and [[UK Independence Party|UKIP]], marches in favour of far-right activist [[Tommy Robinson (activist)|Tommy Robinson]] and high-profile [[Islamophobia in the UK Conservative Party|Islamophobia in the Conservative Party]].&lt;ref name="Sabbagh2018a"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sabbagh |first1=Dan |title=John McDonnell: revive Anti-Nazi League to oppose far right |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/aug/07/john-mcdonnell-revive-anti-nazi-league-oppose-far-right |accessdate=20 August 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=7 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sabbagh2018b"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sabbagh |first1=Dan |title=Anti-Nazi League founders call for new national campaign |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/15/anti-nazi-league-founders-call-for-new-national-campaign |accessdate=20 August 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=15 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This "welcome and timely" call to action was supported in a ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' letter signed by the league's founders, which included former Labour minister [[Peter Hain]], political activist Paul Holborow and leading musicians from [[Rock Against Racism]].&lt;ref name="Sabbagh2018b" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1737">The '''Bloc Català''' ({{lang|en|Catalan Bloc}}) is a [[Catalan nationalism|Catalan nationalist]] political party in [[Pyrénées-Orientales]] ([[France]]) (or [[Northern Catalonia]] as Bloc Català refers to it). It was established on October 23, 2001. 

It defines itself as a center-left wing political party. One of its proposals is the establishment of a "northern Catalan region" in France. This party was one of the organizations that promoted a movement against the denomination [[Septimanie]], proposed by [[Georges Frêche]], the president of the region of [[Languedoc-Roussillon]]. As a symbol of a so-called Catalan resistance against that move, they will adopt a disguised [[Catalan donkey|donkey]] as [[mascot]].{{Dubious|date=December 2008}}

It participates since 2002 in all the elections of Northern Catalonia: cantonal, legislative, regional and European elections, so far without success in terms of having elected any representative.

On December 3, 2006, the Bloc Català changed its name and it was converted to an autonomous federation, representative of Northern Catalonia, of the Spanish Catalan political party [[Convergència Democràtica de Catalunya]].

The '''Central Intelligence Organisation''' ('''CIO''') is the national [[intelligence agency]] or "[[secret police]]" of [[Zimbabwe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theindependent.co.zw/2012/07/27/off-budget-cio-funding-threatens-democracy/ Off Budget CIO funding threatens democracy]&lt;/ref&gt; It was conceived as the external intelligence-gathering arm of the [[British South Africa Police]] [[Special Branch]] in the early 1960s, under [[Southern Rhodesia]]n prime minister [[Winston Field]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdn.entelectonline.co.za/wm-122882-cmsimages/documents/zim.pdf Security Forces]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The CIO was formed in [[Rhodesia]] on the instructions of [[Prime Minister]] [[Winston Field]] in 1963 at the dissolution of the [[Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]], and took over from the Federal Intelligence and Security Bureau, which was a co-ordinating bureau analysing intelligence gathered by the [[British South Africa Police]] (BSAP) and the police forces of [[Northern Rhodesia]] and [[Nyasaland]].

The first head of the CIO was police Deputy Commissioner, [[Ken Flower] who during his tenure oversaw the BSAP'[[Special Branch]] Headquarters incorporated within the CIO, while the Special Branch retained its internal security function within the BSAP. Upon gaining independence in April 1980,
[[Prime Minister]] Mugabe kept Flower in the role of head of the CIO after majority rule in 1980, when the country's name changed to ''Zimbabwe''. Flower had no more than a professional relationship with [[MI6]] despite rumours that he had covertly and intermittently plotted with the British intelligence services to undermine [[Ian Smith]]'s government. He had, however, an especially good professional relationship with Sir [[Dick Franks]], the head of [[MI6]] at the time, as he had with all the other main intelligence agencies.

In addition to the information contained in ZWE38448.E of 12 March 2002, and ZWE38050.E of 2 November 2001, media reports indicate that the Central Intelligence Organization (CIO), ostensibly has powers of arrest and detention (AFP 1 Apr. 2002; ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'' 29 Mar. 2002). The CIO is also allegedly known to perpetrate acts of violence against the political opposition (''[[The Observer]]'' 3 Mar. 2002; [[Amnesty International]] 12 Mar. 2002).

Before the March 2002 election, the [[Movement for Democratic Change – Tsvangirai|Movement for Democratic Change]] (MDC) reportedly complained that its leaders were being "constantly harassed, intimidated and detained by the CIO and the police" (The Star 15 Feb. 2002). ''The Star'' quotes the ''[[Zimbabwe Financial Gazette]]'' as alleging that "CIO agents from the counter-intelligence unit were working with Foreign Affairs Ministry officials to monitor the activities and movements of the international observers ahead of the critical two-day poll" (ibid.).

''The Observer'' of 3 March 2002 reported that in 2000, an MDC "election agent, Tichoana Chiminya and another MDC activist, Talent Mabika, were burnt to death by a CIO officer called Joseph Mwale."

An Amnesty International [[press release]]'' of 12 March 2002 states that:

Several human rights sources in Zimbabwe have reported that police and security intelligence officers from the Central Intelligence Organization (CIO) are targeting ZESN (Zimbabwe Election Support Network) monitors for harassment and detention under orders from superiors.

In March 2002, CIO agents reportedly arrested a Zimbabwean correspondent for London's Daily Telegraph, Peta Thornycroft, who had gone to Chimanimani (about 480 kilometres east of Harare) to investigate election violence by the ruling party, the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), against the political opposition (AFP 1 Apr. 2002; Orlando Sentinel 29 Mar. 2002). Under the "new state security laws," she was expected "to face charges of incitement to violence and publishing of 'false statements likely to be prejudicial to state security'" (ibid.). Parliament reportedly passed "the public order and security bill ... by acclamation and not by formal vote" in January 2002 (''The Guardian'' 10 Jan. 2002). These laws reportedly gave "sweeping powers to clamp down on the opposition" (ibid.). Peta Thornycroft was reportedly released by the police "on a High Court order after four nights in detention" (AFP 1 Apr. 2002).

No reports on the official mandate, policies and procedures of the CIO, and on what their uniforms look like, could be found among the sources consulted by the Research Directorate.

This response was prepared after researching publicly accessible information currently available to the Research Directorate within time constraints. This esponse is not, and does not purport to be, conclusive as to the merit of any particular claim to refugee status or asylum.

In recent years international human rights organisations such as Amnesty International]] have criticised the CIO's role in alleged internal repression, which is said on occasions to have involved [[torture]].

In his book ''Serving Secretly'', Flower complained about the undue influence of Irish Catholics in top positions during his early days in the BSA Police. He thought that this matter had been resolved in the late 1940s after a commission of enquiry. The Commissioner of Police at the time Mugabe became Prime Minister, most of the other top police officers were Catholic and Irish or had strong Irish connections.
The Central Intelligence Organisation, otherwise known as the CIO, is an arm of the Zimbabwe security sector whose line of work is inherently classified. For a very long time the organisation and its operations have ignited public debate and fueled speculation.

==Structure==
Isaac Moyo is the head of the CIO and is referred to as a director general. He is deputised by Aaron Nhepera. The intelligence organisation consists of nine key branches which include internal, external, counter-intelligence, military intelligence, training, close security unit, technical, administration and another simply known as branch six. The other directors who come immediately after Moyo head these other branches. The directors are duty bound to report directly to the President thereby effectively bypassing the minister of defence. Immediately under the directors are deputy directors, assistant directors, provincial intelligence officers, district intelligence officers, senior intelligence officers, assistant senior intelligence officers and ordinary-level intelligence officers.&lt;ref name="ref"&gt;[http://www.refworld.org/docid/3df4bece4.html Zimbabwe: The Central Intelligence Organization (CIO), including its structure and branches and whether its members commit human rights abuses. And if so, the branch which is involved], ''Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada'', Published: November 2, 2001, Retrieved: June 24, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions==
The function of the organisation is to provide high level security to the state from threats both within and outside Zimbabwe. The organisation also offers high level security to high ranking government officials like the President, various government employees like ministers and diplomats working in and outside Zimbabwe. Regionally the organisation works with other Intelligence organisations from other African countries under a regional body called Central Intelligence and Security Services of Africa CISSA  to tackle problems that threaten the stability of the continent and hamper development like terrorism and extremism.&lt;ref name="herald"&gt;Isidore Guvamombe [http://www.herald.co.zw/cissa-when-the-ides-of-march-woke-up-a-continent/ CISSA: When the Ides of March woke up a continent], ''The Herald'', Published: April 23, 2013, Retrieved: June 25, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human rights abuses and malpractices==
There have been numerous reports of gross human rights abuses allegedly perpetrated by the organisation which range from unlawful abductions, torturing of civilians at undisclosed locations among others. Some of the specific incidents in which the Intelligence organisation was fingered include the attack on [[Nelson Chamisa]] at the Harare International Airport, the brief disappearance of former ZBC News host [[Jestina Mukoko]] and the abductions of Zimbabweans living in South Africa. It is also accused for the abduction of Itai Dzamara, a Zimbabwean activist. These are some allegations that have been leveled against the organisation in the media. There were also unconfirmed reports linking the Central Intelligence Organisation to the closure of Zimweb Internet in December 2001 and the looting of [[diamond]]s at the Marange Diamond fields among other malpractices.&lt;ref name="cham"&gt;Hope, [http://www.sokwanele.com/thisiszimbabwe/archives/527 Nelson Chamisa attacked by CIO agents at Harare International Airport] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140718042240/http://www.sokwanele.com/thisiszimbabwe/archives/527# |date=July 18, 2014 }}, ''Sokwanele'', Published: March 18, 2007, Retrieved: June 25, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recruitment==
Applying for a job in the organisation is not public knowledge like other arms of the Zimbabwe security sector like the police or the army. It has been proposed that they recruit people with preexisting links and others have even proposed that the process of recruitment is a long process in which the one being recruited is researched on to verify their suitability to the job. There have reports linking the organisation with Midlands State University in which the organisation was said to be targeting University graduates for their recruitment sessions, Matebeleland is also one of the alleged areas in which the recruitment sessions are said to have taken place in recent years.&lt;ref name="voice"&gt;[http://www.radiovop.com/index.php/national-news/5647-university-graduates-main-target-of-cio-recruitment.html University Graduates Main Target Of CIO Recruitment], '' Voice of the People'', Published: February 26, 2011, Retrieved: 24 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9151">{{For|the descriptive term in the Old Testament or Hebrew Bible and the New Testament|People of God}}
Throughout history, various groups of people have considered themselves to be '''chosen people''' by a [[deity]] for a purpose, such as to act as the deity's agent on earth.{{cite-needed|date=April 2017}} In [[monotheistic]] faiths references to [[God in Abrahamic religions|God]] are used in constructs such as "God's Chosen People". The phenomenon of a "chosen people" is particularly common in the
Israelite tradition, where it originally referred to the Israelites—in fact Jews refer to this as a burden to spread the message of one God. Some claims of chosenness are based on parallel claims of [[groups claiming affiliation with Israelites|Israelite]] ancestry, as is the case for the [[Christian Identity]] and [[Black Hebrew]] sects—both which claim themselves (and not Jews) to be the "true Israel". Others claim a "spiritual" chosenness, including most Christian denominations, who traditionally believe the church has replaced Israel as the [[People of God]].

[[Anthropologist]]s commonly regard claims of chosenness as a form of [[ethnocentrism]].&lt;ref name="HavilandPrins2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=William A. Haviland|author2=Harald E. L. Prins|author3=Dana Walrath|author4=Bunny McBride|title=The Essence of Anthropology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AmvJ1XtnIQoC&amp;pg=PA159|year=2009|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-59981-4|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EitzenZinn2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=D. Stanley Eitzen|author2=Maxine Baca Zinn|title=In conflict and order: understanding society|year=2003|edition=10th|publisher=Pearson|isbn=978-0-205-37622-3|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism==
{{Main article|Jews as the chosen people}}
In Judaism, "chosenness" is the belief that the [[Jew]]s, via descent from the ancient [[Israelites]], are the chosen people, i.e. chosen to be in a [[covenant (biblical)|covenant]] with [[God in Judaism|God]]. The idea of the Israelites being chosen by God is found most directly in the [[Book of Deuteronomy]]&lt;ref&gt;Clements, Ronald (1968). ''God's Chosen People: a Theological Interpretation of the Book of Deuteronomy''. In series, ''Religious Book Club'', 182. London: S.C.M. Press&lt;/ref&gt; as the verb ''bahar'' ({{native name|he|בָּחַ֣ר|italics=off}}), and is alluded to elsewhere in the [[Hebrew Bible]] using other terms such as "holy people".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9nN8AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Jews as a Chosen People: Tradition and Transformation, S. Leyla Gurkan]&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Much is written about these topics in [[rabbinic literature]]. The three largest Jewish denominations—[[Orthodox Judaism]], [[Conservative Judaism]] and [[Reform Judaism]]—maintain the belief that the Jews have been chosen by God for a purpose. Sometimes this choice is seen as charging the Jewish people with a specific mission—to be a light unto the nations, and to exemplify the [[Covenant (biblical)|covenant]] with God as described in the Torah.

===Seventh-day Adventism===

===Mormonism===
{{See also|Mormonism|Mormonism and Judaism|Mormonism and Islam}}
In [[Mormonism]], all [[Latter Day Saint]]s are viewed as [[Covenant (Latter Day Saints)|covenant]], or chosen, people because they have accepted the name of Jesus Christ through the [[ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinance]] of baptism. In contrast to [[supersessionism]], Latter Day Saints do not dispute the "chosen" status of the Jewish people.
Most practicing Mormons receive a [[patriarchal blessing]] that reveals their lineage in the House of Israel. This lineage may be blood related or through "adoption;" therefore, a child may not necessarily share the lineage of her parents (but will still be a member of the [[tribes of Israel]]). It is a widely held belief&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel H. Ludlow]], [http://www.lds.org/ensign/1991/01/of-the-house-of-israel "Of the House of Israel"], ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', January 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lds.org/manual/old-testament-seminary-student-study-guide/genesis-44  |title= Genesis 44&amp;nbsp;– Joseph Tests His Brothers |accessdate=|work=[http://www/lds.org/ lds.org] |publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints }}&lt;/ref&gt; that most members of the faith are in the [[tribe of Ephraim]] or the [[tribe of Manasseh]].

The Christian Identity movement sees the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]], [[Germanic people|Germanic]], [[Nordic race|Nordic]] and kindred peoples of the world as both the descendants of the ancient Israelites and the physical descendants of [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]] and [[Jacob]].

that promotes a [[racial]] interpretation of [[Christianity]]. Christian Identity beliefs were primarily developed and promoted by two authors{{which?|date=January 2017}} who regarded Europeans as the "chosen people" and Jews as the cursed offspring of [[Cain]]. [[White supremacist]] sects and gangs later adopted many of these teachings.

==Rastafari==
{{Main article| Rastafari}}
Based on Jewish biblical tradition and Ethiopian legend via [[Kebra Nagast]], Rastas believe that Israel's [[King Solomon]], together with Ethiopian [[Queen of Sheba]], conceived a child which began the [[Solomonic dynasty|Solomonic line]] of kings in Ethiopia, rendering the Ethiopian people as the true children of Israel, and thereby chosen. Reinforcement of this belief occurred when [[Beta Israel]], Ethiopia's ancient Israelite First Temple community, were rescued from Sudanese famine and brought to Israel during [[Operation Moses]] in 1985.

The NOI teaches that black people constitute a nation and that through the institution of the [[Atlantic slave trade]] they were systematically denied knowledge of [[History of Africa|their history]], [[Languages of Africa|language]], [[Culture of Africa|culture]], and [[Traditional African religion|religion]] and, in effect, lost control of their lives. Founder [[Elijah Muhammad]] called for the establishment of a separate nation for black Americans and the adoption of a religion based on the worship of [[Allah]] and on the belief that blacks were his chosen people.

'''ERAS''' (Committee for a Radical Left Rally, ''Επιτροπή για μια Ριζοσπαστική Αριστερή Συσπείρωση'') was a [[far-left]] organisation in the [[Republic of Cyprus]]. It was founded in 2011 by communist and socialist activists in an attempt to organise the people of the radical left in Cyprus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://erascy.blogspot.com/2011/11/blog-post.html|title = The Road for the Organization of the Radial Left (Ο δρόμος για τη συσπείρωση της ριζοσπαστικής αριστερας) |publisher = ERAS|date = 7 November 2011 |accessdate= 19 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to internal disagreement between its various factions ERAS was eventually dissolved in 2014, with one faction forming the bi-communal group ''ΔΡΑΣυ-Eyelem'' and participating in the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (Cyprus)|Cypriot European Elections of the same year]].&lt;ref&gt;''Worker's Democracy'' (Newspaper), Issue 147, June - July 2014, page 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political Views==
ERAS identified itself as a [[communist]] political party. It claimed to hold a strong position in favor of the [[welfare state]] and supported the permanent nationalisation of the banking sector. It supported the reduction of Defense expenses and the duration of [[Conscription in Cyprus|conscription]] in the [[Cypriot National Guard|National Guard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://erascy.blogspot.co.uk/2012/08/2012.html|title = Positions of ERAS, August 2012 (Θέσεις ΕΡΑΣ, Αύγουστος 2012) |publisher = ERAS |date = 5 August 2012|accessdate= 19 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It held a strong anti-austerity position concerning the [[2012 Cypriot Financial Crisis#Bailout Request and Agreement|austerity measures]] agreed upon between the Troika and the government of Cyprus.&lt;ref name = rpr_eras1&gt;{{cite web |url = http://rproject.gr/article/i-topothetisi-tis-eras-gia-tis-eperhomenes-proedrikes-ekloges-stin-kypro|title = The position of ERAS for the next Presidential Election in Cyprus(Η τοποθέτηση της ΕΡΑΣ για τις επερχόμενες προεδρικές εκλογές στην Κύπρο) |publisher = rproject.gr |date = 2012-12-11|accessdate= 19 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It chose not to support any candidate in the [[Cypriot presidential election, 2013|2013 presidential elections]], stating that "within the current conditions, we should have had our own candidate in order to strongly express the ideas and strength of the radical left" but that "since ERAS is a recently founded committee, we deemed that we do not have at the moment the organisational capacity or the resources to undergo an electoral campaign".&lt;ref name = rpr_eras1 /&gt; The Committee also stated that the [[AKEL]]-backed candidate, [[Stavros Malas]], does not "guarantee in any way the defense of the interests of the people and the working class and promotes the delusion that it is possible in the conditions of this crisis to retain the social interest without opposition to the central decisions of the [[bourgeoisie]]."&lt;ref name = rpr_eras1 /&gt;

'''Democratic Awakening''' ({{lang-de|Demokratischer Aufbruch}}) was an [[East Germany|East German]] political movement and political party that was active during the [[Fall of Communism]] and in the period leading up to the [[German reunification]]. While it was a relatively minor party, it took part in the first democratically elected government in East Germany in 1990, and is especially known because future [[Chancellor of Germany]] [[Angela Merkel]] started her political career within the party.

It was founded in October 1989, based on existing politically active church groups. Founding members included Wolfgang Schnur, [[Friedrich Schorlemmer]], [[Rainer Eppelmann]], [[Günter Nooke]] and [[Thomas Welz]]. The organisation became a political party on December 16/17, 1989 in [[Leipzig]]. The party convention adopted a more conservative program than some of the founding members, like Schorlemmer, were willing to bear, so they left the party. Others, like Nooke, who left some time later, resented the growing cooperation with the [[Christian Democratic Union (East Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]]  (CDU) of East Germany, which had been a member of the Communist-dominated [[National Front (East Germany)|National Front]] of parties and mass organisations that had supported the Communist regime.

Democratic Awakening now supported rapid [[German reunification]] and joined the [[Alliance for Germany]] (''Allianz für Deutschland'') along with the CDU and [[German Social Union (East Germany)|German Social Union]] (DSU) for the [[East German general election, 1990|1990 Volkskammer elections]] on March 18. Only a few days prior to the elections, party chairman Schnur had to confess to having been an informer for the [[Ministry for State Security (East Germany)|Ministry for State Security (Stasi)]], and resigned. Although Alliance for Germany won the elections, Democratic Awakening only collected 0.9% of votes, amounting to four seats in the Volkskammer. Eppelmann became minister for disarmament and defense in the new government and new party chairman. On August 5, 1990 Democratic Awakening ceased to exist after merging into the East German CDU, which in turn on 3 October 1990 merged into its [[West German]] counterpart, the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU).

From February 1990, [[Angela Merkel]] served as the party's spokeswoman. After the mergers, Merkel was elected in the [[German federal election, 1990|post-unification election]] as a member of the all-German [[Bundestag]] for the CDU, and eventually became [[Chancellor of Germany]] in 2005.

The '''Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA)''' ({{lang|ar|هيئة كهرباء ومياه دبي}}) is a [[public service]] [[infrastructure]] company that was founded on 1 January 1992 by [[Sheikh Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum]].&lt;ref name="DEWA: History"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.dewa.gov.ae/aboutus/dewahistory.aspx |title=DEWA: History|publisher=Dubai Electricity and Water Authority|accessdate=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It arose from the merger of the Dubai Electricity Company and the Dubai Water Department that had been operating independently until then. These organizations were established in 1959 by [[sheikh]] [[Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum]], former ruler of [[Dubai]].&lt;ref name="DEWA: History"/&gt; The objective of the state-run company is making available to the people of Dubai an adequate and reliable supply of electricity and water.&lt;ref name="WdonE"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilde|first1=Felix |year=2011 |chapter=Country-specific Organizations and Authorities|title=Worldwide development of nuclear Energy|location=Hamburg |publisher=Diplomica Verlag |page=25 |isbn=9783842859647 |oclc=837778047 }}&lt;!----&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

As of end of 2017, DEWA employs a workforce of over 11,000 employees and provides 796,764 customers with electricity and 705,376 customers with water.&lt;ref name="World Future Energy Summit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldfutureenergysummit.com/portal/sponsorship/wfes-2014-sponsors.aspx|title=2014 World Future Energy Summit Sponsors|publisher=[[World Future Energy Summit]]|accessdate=24 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826115816/http://www.worldfutureenergysummit.com/portal/sponsorship/wfes-2014-sponsors.aspx|archivedate=26 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, DEWA had an installed capacity of 10,200 MW of electricity and 470 million imperial gallons of desalinated water per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.dewa.gov.ae/en/about-dewa/about-us/dewa-publications/annual-statistics|title=DEWA Statistics 2017|last=|first=|date=22 April 2015|work=|accessdate=23 June 2018|publisher=DEWA website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After using conventional gas-fired power plants for most of its history, DEWA has recently started to add solar power to its energy mix. After installing an initial 13 MW (DC) solar plant at the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DEWA 13 Solar Plant|url= http://www.firstsolar.com/en/About-Us/Projects/DEWA-13-Solar-Plant.aspx |website=firstsolar.com|publisher=First Solar|accessdate=14 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a further 200 MW (AC) were contracted from developer ACWA Power in January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dubai Doubling Size of Power Plant to Make Cheapest Solar Energy|url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-01-15/acwa-power-wins-contract-to-build-dubai-solar-plant-acwa-ceo |website=bloomberg.com|publisher=Bloomberg Business|accessdate=14 February 2016|date=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latest addition to DEWA's solar portfolio will be an 800 MW solar power plant, which was started in the fall of 2015 and should be completed by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DEWA announces release of Request for Proposal for 800MW 3rd phase of the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park|url= http://www.wam.ae/en/news/emirates/1395289755171.html |accessdate=14 February 2016|agency=WAM Emirates News Agency|date=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; DEWA plans a 250 MW [[pumped-storage hydroelectricity]] at [[Hatta, United Arab Emirates|Hatta]] using 880 million gallons of water 300 meter above a lower dam.&lt;!--1,716 million gallons water stored in the Hatta Dam--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://electrek.co/2016/12/23/dubai-to-build-persian-gulfs-first-hydroelectric-plant-880-million-gallon-battery/ |title=Dubai to build Persian Gulf’s first hydroelectric plant, 880 million gallon ‘battery’|date=23 December 2016|work=Electrek |accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Encontro Irmandiño''' ('''EI''', ''[[Irmandiño]] Meeting'' in English) is a [[political organization]] that is part of [[Anova-Nationalist Brotherhood]] in Galicia, Spain. It used to be an internal current in the [[Galician Nationalist Bloc]] (BNG). EI was founded in 2007 and has an ideology based in [[Galician nationalism]], [[direct democracy]], [[anticapitalism]], [[feminism]] and [[Anti-globalization movement|alter-globalization]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.galiciaconfidencial.com/nova/10857.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Encontro Irmandiño was founded as an internal current of the BNG on 21 July 2007&lt;ref&gt;http://www.galiciaconfidencial.com/nova/1927.html&lt;/ref&gt; at a meeting in [[Santiago de Compostela]]. Led by [[Xosé Manuel Beiras]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.laopinioncoruna.es/galicia/2011/02/20/encontro-irmandino-constituye-partido-liderato-beiras/469402.html&lt;/ref&gt; EI advocated for a return to the founding principles of BNG, as [[Horizontalidad|assembly]]-based internal democracy and communication between the different levels of the organization. Encontro Irmadiño abandoned the BNG in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lavozdegalicia.es/noticia/galicia/2012/02/13/beiras-va-tras-30-anos-bng/0003_201202G13P2991.htm?idioma=galego&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 March 2012 the Encontro Irmandiño announced that it had begun to contact other small formations towards the creation of a common electoral platform, among which would be [[Máis Galiza]], [[Nationalist Left]], [[Espazo Ecosocialista Galego]], [[New Galician Left]], [[Galician People's Front]] (FPG), [[Communist Party of the Peoples of Spain|Communist Party of the Galician People]] (PCPG), [[Movemento pola Base]] (MpB), [[Causa Galiza]], [[Galician Workers Front]], [[Marín Nationalist Collective]] and a small section of the [[Galician Socialist Party]] of [[Vigo]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lavozdegalicia.es/noticia/galicia/2012/03/14/once-grupos-nacionalistas-abren-contactos-confluir/0003_201203G14P12991.htm?idioma=galego&lt;/ref&gt; This platform would have the temporary name of ''New Common Project'', and would lead to new political party: [[Anova-Nationalist Brotherhood]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2012/03/15/galicia/1331834607.html&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''Estoppel Certificate''' (or '''Estoppel Letter''') is a document often used in due diligence in [[Real estate]] and [[Mortgage loan|mortgage]] activities.&lt;ref name="Shaffer"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shaffer|first1=Brent C.|title=Using Tenant Estoppel Letters to Cut to the Chase|date=2001|url=http://www.americanbar.org/publications/probate_property_magazine_home/rppt_publications_magazine_2001_01nd_shaffer.html|accessdate=3 March 2017|publisher=ABA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a document often completed, but at least signed, by a tenant used in his or her landlord's proposed transaction with a third party.&lt;ref name=Shaffer/&gt;  A mortgage lender intending to collateralize a tenant-occupied property or a purchaser intending to purchase such a property will often want to verify certain representations made by the landlord.&lt;ref name=Shaffer/&gt;

An estoppel certificate provides confirmation by the tenant of the terms of the rental agreement, such as the amount of rent, the amount of security deposit and the expiration of the agreement.&lt;ref name=Shaffer/&gt;   Further, the estoppel certificate may give the opportunity to the tenant to explain if they may have any claims against the landlord, which may affect a buyer's or lender's decision to complete the proposed transaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of Estoppel Certificate|url=http://www.redfin.com/definition/estoppel-certificate|publisher=Redfin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some lease agreements require the tenant to complete such a certificate or to waive his responses by allowing the landlord to complete the estoppel certificate under certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Heller|first1=Stu|title=The Landlord Wants You to Sign an Estoppel Certificate?|url=http://www.theleasinglawyer.com/estoppel.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some extreme cases, a tenant can be in default of a lease when failing to comply with an estoppel certificate, though this is rare.  The majority of leases do not mention the protocol for signature of estoppel certificates.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

[[Image:Coal power plant Datteln 2 Crop1.png|thumb|A coal power plant in Germany. Fee and dividend will make fossil fuels – [[coal]], [[oil]], and [[gas]] – less competitive as a fuel than other options.]]

'''Fee and Dividend''' or '''Carbon Fee and Dividend''' ('''CF&amp;D''') is a market-based mechanism for reducing the carbon emissions that help to drive [[anthropogenic climate change]]. Carbon Fee and Dividend begins with levying a progressively-rising tax on [[carbon]]-based fuels, then returning some or all of the revenue to the public as a regular energy dividend. This is intended to incentivize a shift to low-carbon energy while protecting consumers from any increases in the costs of carbon-based fuels.

Designed to maintain or improve economic vitality while speeding the transition to a [[sustainable energy]] economy, Carbon Fee and Dividend has been proposed as an alternative to emission reduction mechanisms such as [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|complex regulatory approaches]], [[Emissions trading|cap and trade]] or a straightforward [[carbon tax]]. While there is general agreement among scientists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine |title=The Power of Change: Innovation for Development and Deployment of Increasingly Clean Electric Power Technologies |publisher=The National Academies Press |url=https://www.nap.edu/catalog/21712/the-power-of-change-innovation-for-development-and-deployment-of |accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rosenberg |first1=Stacy |last2=Vedlitz |first2=Arnold |last3=Cowman |first3=Deborah |last4=Zahran |first4=Sammy |title=Climate Change: A Profile of U.S. Climate Scientists' Perspectives |journal=Climatic Change |date=August 2010 |volume=101 |issue=3-4 |pages=311-329 |doi=10.1007/s10584-009-9709-9 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-009-9709-9 |accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and economists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fuller |first1=Dan |last2=Geide-Stevenson |first2=Doris |title=Consensus Among Economists —An Update |journal=The Journal of Economic Education |date=14 April 2014 |volume=45 |issue=2 |pages=131-146 |doi=10.1080/00220485.2014.889963 |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00220485.2014.889963 |accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Haab |first1=Timothy |last2=Whitehead |first2=John |title=What do Environmental and Resource  Economists Think?

==Structure==
The basic structure of Carbon Fee and Dividend is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://citizensclimatelobby.org/carbon-fee-and-dividend/|title=Carbon Fee and Dividend (Citizens' Climate Lobby)|last=|first=|date=|website=citizensclimatelobby.org|publisher=|access-date=July 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# A fee is levied on fuels at their point of origin into the economy, such as the well, mine, or port of entry. The fee is based upon the carbon content of a given fuel, with a commonly-proposed starting point being $10–$16 per ton of carbon that would be emitted once the fuel is burned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carbontax.org/faqs/ |title=FAQs |website=Carbontax.org |date=2008-07-01 |accessdate=2016-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://niskanencenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/The-Conservative-Case-for-a-Carbon-Tax1.pdf|title=The Conservative Case for a Carbon Tax|last=Taylor|first=Jerry|date=March 23, 2015|website=Niskanencenter.org|publisher=|access-date=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The fee is progressively increased, providing a steady, predictable price signal and incentivizing early transition to low-carbon energy sources and products. 
# A border tax adjustment is levied on imports from nations that lack their own equivalent fee on carbon. To take one example, if the United States created a carbon fee-and-dividend system, China would face the choice of paying carbon fees to the United States or creating its own internal carbon pricing system. This would leverage American economic power to incentivize carbon pricing around the world. 
# Some or all of the fee is returned to households as an energy dividend. Returning 100% of net fees results in a revenue-neutral carbon fee-and-dividend system; this revenue neutrality often appeals to conservatives, such as former Secretary of State George Shultz,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323611604578396401965799658|title=Why We Support a Revenue Neutral Carbon Tax|last=Shultz|first=George|date=April 7, 2013|work=The Wall Street Journal|last2=Becker|first2=Gary|access-date=July 6, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who want to reduce emissions without increasing the size and funding of the federal government.  
In order to maximize effectiveness, the amount of the fee would be regulated based on the scientific assessments from both economic and [[climate science]] in order to balance the size and speed of fee progression.

&lt;/ref&gt;  It is well understood that unilateral [[climate policy]] can lead to [[Carbon leakage|emissions leakage]].  As one example, trade-exposed emissions-intensive industries may simply relocate to regions with laxer climate protection.  A border carbon adjustment (BCA) program can help counter this and related effects.  Under such a policy, tariffs are levied on the carbon embodied in imported goods from unregulated trading partners while the original climate protection payments for exported goods are rebated.&lt;ref name="emf-29-website"/&gt;  The study finds that the BCA programs evaluated:&lt;ref name="boehringer-etal-2012b"/&gt;

* can reduce [[Carbon leakage|emissions leakage]]
* yield modest gains in global [[economic efficiency]]
* shift substantial costs from abating [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] counties to non-abating non-OECD countries

In light of these findings, the study recommends care when designing and implementing BCA programs.&lt;ref name="boehringer-etal-2012b"/&gt;  Moreover, the regressive impact of shifting part of the abatement burden southward conflicts with the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|UNFCCC]] principle of common but differentiated responsibility and respective capabilities, which explicitly acknowledges that developing countries have less ability to shoulder climate protection measures.&lt;ref name="emf-29-website"/&gt;

=== Regional Economic Models study 2014 ===

A 2014 [[economic impact analysis]] by Regional Economic Models, Incorporated (REMI) concluded that a carbon fee that began at $10 per ton and increased by $10 per year, with all net revenue returned to households as an energy dividend, would carry substantial environmental, health, and economic benefits:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://citizensclimatelobby.org/remi-report/|title=Carbon Fee and Dividend's Economic Impact|last=|first=|date=|website=citizensclimatelobby.org|publisher=|access-date=July 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nystrom-and-luckow-2014"&gt;

* CO2 emissions in the United States would decrease to 50% of 1990 levels in the first 20 years.
* Over the same timespan, reductions in airborne pollution that accompanies CO2 emissions would result in 230,000 fewer premature deaths.
* Regular dividend payments would stimulate the [[U.S. economy]], leading to the creation of 2.8 million jobs over baseline during the program's first two decades. 
* The stimulative effect was also found to positively affect national GDP, adding $70–85 billion per year for a cumulative 20-year increase of $1.375 trillion over baseline (the approximate equivalent of adding an additional year of growth during that span).

=== International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis study 2016 ===

A 2016 working paper from the [[International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis]] (IIASA) looked more narrowly at the impact of Carbon Fee and Dividend on American households during the first year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ummel|first=Kevin|date=April 1, 2016|title=Impact of CCL’s proposed carbon fee and dividend policy: A high-resolution analysis of the financial effect on U.S. households|url=https://citizensclimatelobby.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Ummel-Impact-of-CCL-CFD-Policy-v1_4.pdf|journal=International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis working paper|volume=|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=July 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the shorter window analyzed (which did not allow for considerations of changes to personal energy use under the policy) the paper found a smaller percentage of households benefiting from Carbon Fee and Dividend than the REMI report summarized above (53% versus approximately two-thirds in the REMI report). It also found that an additional 19% of households suffered a loss of less than 0.2% of annual income, an amount that might be experienced as effectively "breaking even" by households in the upper income quintiles most likely affected.


==Implementation==

The [[British Columbia carbon tax]] could be considered a "fee and dividend", although there are some differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://canada.citizensclimatelobby.org/laser-talk-the-bc-carbon-tax-vs-ccls-carbon-fee-and-dividend/|title=LASER TALK: BC Carbon Tax vs Carbon Fee and Dividend - Citizens' Climate Lobby Canada|website=canada.citizensclimatelobby.org|date=April 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rather than entirely or mostly being returned as a dividend to households, 73% of the carbon tax is used to reduce corporate and small business taxes. Unlike most governments, British Columbia's electricity portfolio largely consists of hydroelectric power and their energy costs, even with the tax, are lower than most countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://peoplepowerplanet.ca/british-columbia/overview-of-electricity-sector-bc/|title=Overview of Electricity Sector - PeoplePowerPlanet|work=PeoplePowerPlanet|access-date=2017-09-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/electricity-alternative-energy/electricity/electricity-residents/rates|title=B.C.'s Electricity Rates - Province of British Columbia|last=Mines|first=Ministry of Energy and|website=www2.gov.bc.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This needs sorting out before putting back into article:
==History==
The originator of the method of fee and dividend is Georg Ziegler, who at its introduction in the 1980s called it RENOVA for 'Reduction of energy-demand without command and control'.
A book was published in German regarding Fee and Dividend in 1992. The title when translated to English is '[https://www.amazon.de/dp/3725304440 Ecological Tax Reform: The European level and case example of Switzerland].&lt;ref&gt;Mauch, Samuel P; Iten, Rolf; von Weizsacker, Ernst U; Jesinghaus, Jochen - 1992&lt;/ref&gt;
 --&gt;

==Political support==
Carbon Fee and Dividend is the preferred climate solution of [[Citizens Climate Lobby|Citizens' Climate Lobby]] (CCL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citizensclimatelobby.org/|title=Citizens Climate Lobby|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|work=Citizens Climate Lobby|accessdate=July 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citizens' Climate Lobby argues that a fee-and-dividend policy will be easier to adopt and adjust than relatively complicated cap-and-trade or regulatory approaches, enabling a smooth, economically-positive transition to a low-carbon energy economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Carbon Fee and Dividend FAQ|url=http://www.citizensclimatelobby.org/node/444|publisher=Citizens Climate Lobby|accessdate=9 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[James Hansen]], Director of the [[NASA]] [[Goddard Institute for Space Studies]]  has frequently promoted awareness of Carbon Fee and Dividend through his writings &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rep.org/opinions/weblog/weblog10-10-11.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=April 10, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219194417/http://www.rep.org/opinions/weblog/weblog10-10-11.html |archivedate=February 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jan/12/james-hansen-carbon-emissions|title=James Hansen rails against cap-and-trade plan in open letter|date=12 January 2010|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and frequent public appearances, as well as his position at [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~jeh1/mailings/2010/20100425_PeoplesBill.pdf |format=PDF |title=People’s Climate Stewardship / Carbon Fee and Dividend Act of 2010 |website=Columbia.edu |accessdate=2016-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by the market-friendly structure of Carbon Fee and Dividend, [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Congressman [[Bob Inglis]] introduced H.R. 2380 (the 'Raise Wages, Cut Carbon Act of 2009')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h2380/text |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 6, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023020210/http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h2380/text |archivedate=October 23, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://inglis.house.gov/sections/issues/current/rnct/The%20Triple%20Win%202.pdf] {{dead link|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the U.S. House of Representatives on May 13, 2009.  Congressman Inglis considers Carbon Fee and Dividend to be a solution with great potential appeal for conservatives;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailycaller.com/2016/01/25/donald-trump-and-the-strength-of-ten-grinches/|title=Donald Trump and the Strength of Ten Grinches|last=Inglis|first=Bob|date=January 5, 2016|website=The Daily Caller|publisher=|access-date=July 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; concerned about energy infrastructure as an issue of [[national security]], he supports Fee and Dividend as the a reliable means of reducing dependence on foreign oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/bob-inglis-climate-change-and-the-republican-party/|title=Bob Inglis: Climate Change and the Republican Party|last=Breslow|first=Jason|date=October 23, 2013|website=PBS.org|publisher=Frontline|access-date=July 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another bill partly inspired by the Fee and Dividend structure was introduced by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Congressman [[John B. Larson]] on July 16, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/hr3104|title=America’s Energy Security Trust Fund Act of 2015 (H.R. 3104)|website=Govtrack.us|accessdate=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  H.R. 3104, or the “America’s Energy Security Trust Fund Act of 2015" includes a steadily rising price on carbon but uses some revenue for job retraining, and returns the remainder of revenue via a payroll tax cut rather than direct dividend payments.

On September 1, 2016 the California Assembly Joint Resolution 43, "Williams. Greenhouse gases: climate change", was filed, having passed both houses.&lt;ref name="ajr-43"&gt;
{{cite web
 | title = AJR-43 Greenhouse gases: climate change
 | date = 1 September 2016

 | access-date = September 12, 2016
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  The measure urges the United States Congress to enact a tax on carbon-based fossil fuels.  The proposal is revenue-neutral, with all money collected going to the bottom 2/3 of American households.  It may have difficulty passing in Congress because it would be considered a tax, but if households were to receive an equal share in the form of a dividend then the legislation should properly class as a carbon fee.  Thus California's recommendation for national legislation is perhaps close to being acceptable to Congress.

A bipartisan Carbon Fee &amp; Dividend bill was introduced in the second session of the 115th Congress of U.S. House of Representatives on November 27th, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eenews.net/assets/2018/11/26/document_gw_06.pdf|title=Text of H.R. 7173|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Co-sponsors included Rep. Ted Deutch (D-FL), Rep. Francis Rooney (R-FL), Rep. Charlie Crist (D-FL), Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA) and Rep. John Delaney (D-MD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cama |first1=Timothy |last2=Green |first2=Miranda |title=Bipartisan group of lawmakers propose landmark carbon tax |url=https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/418596-bipartisan-group-of-lawmakers-propose-landmark-carbon-tax |website=The Hill |accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1507">The '''Glen Grey Act''' is an 1894 act of the parliament of the [[Cape Colony]], instigated by the government of Prime Minister [[Cecil John Rhodes]], which established a system of individual (rather than communal) [[land tenure]], and created a labour tax to force [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] men into employment on commercial farms or in industry. The act was so named because, although it was later extended to a larger area, it initially applied only in the Glen Grey district. Glen Grey is a former name for the area around [[Lady Frere]], east of [[Queenstown, Eastern Cape|Queenstown]], in the [[Eastern Cape]] province of [[South Africa]].

The Glen Grey district became part of the [[Transkei]], within which it was named Cacadu district (not to be confused with the current [[Cacadu District Municipality]], which is further to the west) and is now the magisterial district of Lady Frere. It is part of the [[Thembu people|Western Thembuland]] traditional kingdom.

The [https://www.globalemergencyresponse.org/ Global Emergency Response Coalition] formed in 2017 in response to hunger crises affecting more than 20 million people in Nigeria, Yemen, South Sudan, Somalia and neighboring countries.

Eight of the world’s largest U.S.-based international relief organizations united to launch a joint fundraising appeal, the Hunger Relief Fund, to the American public to respond to the unprecedented hunger crisis.

The Global Emergency Response Coalition consists of [[CARE (relief agency)|CARE]], [[International Medical Corps]], [[International Rescue Committee]], [[Mercy Corps]], [[Oxfam]], [[Plan (aid organisation)|Plan International]], [[Save the Children USA|Save the Children]] and [[World Vision United States|World Vision]].

== Fundraising and Partners ==
All funds raised by the coalition are allocated to the member agencies equally, and at the discretion of each member. At least 85% of all donations will go directly to support the communities affected.

Corporate partners of the coalition include [[BlackRock]], [[PepsiCo]]., [http://www.pepsico.com/purpose/global-citizenship PepsiCo. Foundation], [[Visa Inc.|Visa]], [[Google]], [https://www.pmxagency.com/ PMX Agency], [[Porter Novelli]] and [[Twitter]].

== Background ==
The causes of the crisis in each country range from drought to ongoing violence, but the consequences are the same: children and their families are struggling to survive or are starving to death. They are also at increased risk of succumbing to diseases – including cholera and measles – that induce severe diarrhea and dehydration.

More than 20 million people are facing the threat of starvation in the coming months and nearly 1.4 million children are severely malnourished and at risk of death without immediate help.

The '''genomic epidemiological database for global identification of microorganisms''' or '''global microbial identifier (GMI) '''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=GMI|title=Global Microbial Identifier|url=http://www.g-m-i.org/About.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a platform for storing [[whole genome sequencing]] (WGS) data of [[microorganisms]], for the identification of relevant [[genes]] and for the comparison of [[genomes]] to detect and track-and-trace [[infectious disease]] outbreaks and emerging [[pathogens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schlundt|first=J|title=The time is right for a global genomic database for microorganisms|journal=Health Diplomacy Monitor|year=2011|volume=3|issue=2|pages=2–3|url=http://www.ghd-net.org/sites/default/files/Health%20Diplomacy%20Monitor%20Volume%203%20Issue%202.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The database holds two types of information: 1) genomic information of [[microorganisms]], linked to, 2) [[metadata]] of those microorganism such as [[epidemiological]] details. The database includes all genera of microorganisms: [[bacteria]], [[viruses]], [[parasites]] and [[fungi]].

== Technology ==

For [[genotype|genotyping]] of microorganisms for [[medical diagnosis]], or other purposes, scientists may use a wide variety of [[DNA profiling]] techniques, such as [[PCR]], [[PFGE]] and [[MLST]]. A complication of this broad variety of pre-WGS techniques is the difficulty to standardize between techniques, laboratories and microorganisms, which may be overcome using the complete [[DNA]] code of the genome generated by WGS techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shendure|first=J|title= Next-generation DNA sequencing|journal=Nat. Biotechnol.|year=2008|volume=26|issue=10|pages=1135–1145|doi=10.1038/nbt1486|pmid=18846087}}&lt;/ref&gt; For straight forward diagnostic identification the WGS information of a microbiological sample is fed into a global genomic database and compared using [[BLAST]] procedures to the genomes already present in the database.&lt;ref name="X"&gt;{{cite web|title=genomic epidemiology database|url=http://www.genomicepidemiology.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, WGS data may be used to back calculate to the different pre-WGS genotyping methods, so previous collected valuable information is not lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Inouye|first=M|title=Short read sequence typing (SRST):multi-locus sequence types from short reads|journal=BMC Genomics|year=2012|volume=13|pages=388|doi=10.1186/1471-2164-13-338|pmid=22827703|pmc=3460743|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Larsen|first=MV|title=Multilocus sequence typing of total-genome-sequenced bacteria|journal=J Clin Microbiol|year=2012|volume=50|pages=1355–1366|doi=10.1128/JCM.06094-11|pmid=22238442|issue=4|pmc=3318499|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the global microbial identifier the genomic information is coupled to a wide spectrum of metadata about the specific microbial clone and includes important clinical and [[Epidemiology|epidemiological]] information such as the global finding place(s), treatment options and [[antimicrobial resistance]], making it a general microbiological identification tool.This makes [[Personalized medicine|personalized treatment]] of microbial disease possible as well as real-time tracing systems for global surveillance of [[infectious diseases]] for [[food safety]] and serving [[human health]].

== The initiative ==

The initiative for building the database arose in 2011 and when several preconditions were met : 1) WGS has become mature and serious alternative for other genotyping techniques,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zankari|first=E|title=Genotyping using whole-genome sequencing is a realistic alternative to surveillance based on phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing|journal=J Antimicrob Chemother|year=2013|pmid=23233485|doi=10.1093/jac/dks496|volume=68|issue=4|pages=771–7|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dunne|first=WM|title= Next-generation and whole-genome sequencing in the diagnostic clinical microbiology laboratory|journal=Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis|year=2012|volume=31|issue=8|pages=1719-17126|doi=10.1007/s10096-012-1641-7|pmid=22678348|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2) the price of WGS has started falling dramatically and in some cases below the price of traditional identifications, 3) vast amounts of [[Information technology|IT]] resources and a fast [[Internet]] have become available, and 4) there is the idea that via a cross sectoral and [[One Health]] approach infectious diseases may be better controlled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology, Vol 366|title=One Health: The Human-Animal-Environment Interfaces in Emerging Infectious Diseases|year=2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-70961-9|pages=280|url=https://www.springer.com/biomed/virology/book/978-3-642-35845-6?detailsPage=authorsAndEditors#|editor=Mackenzie, J.S. |editor2=Jeggo, M. |editor3=Daszak, P. |editor4=Richt, J}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Wielinga, PR |author2=Schlundt, J |title=Food Safety: At the Center of a One Health Approach for Combating Zoonoses |journal=Curr Top Microbiol Immunol|year=2013|pmid=22763857|doi=10.1007/82_2012_238|pages=3–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting the second millennium, many microbiological laboratories, as well as national health institutes, started genome sequencing projects for sequencing the infectious agents collections they had in their [[biobanks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= A summary of genomic databases|title= Bacterial genome databases|url= http://phobos.ramapo.edu/~pbagga/binf/binf_res/bioinfo_gndb_bact.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= WGS projects info by EBI|title= WGS projects|url= http://www.ebi.ac.uk/genomes/wgs.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereby generating private databases and sending model genomes to global nucleotide databases such as [[GenBank]] of the [[National Center for Biotechnology Information|NCBI]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Genome Browser NCBI|title= Genome information by organism |url= https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/browse/}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the nucleotide database of the [[EMBL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Genome Browser EMBL|title= Access to Completed Genomes|url= http://www.ebi.ac.uk/genomes/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This created a wealth of genomic information and independent databases for [[List of sequenced eukaryotic genomes|eukaryotic]] as well as [[List of sequenced bacterial genomes|prokaryotic]] genomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Microbial Genomes Database|title=MBGD|url= http://mbgd.genome.ad.jp/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Other genomic databases via EBI|url= http://www.ebi.ac.uk/2can/databases/genomic2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= DOE's Joint Genome Institute Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG) |title= IMG DOEs JGI|url=http://img.jgi.doe.gov/cgi-bin/w/main.cgi}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The need to further integrate these databases and to harmonize data collection, and to link the genomic data to metadata for optimal prevention of infectious diseases, was generally recognized by the scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aarestrup|first=F|title=Integrating Genome-based Informatics to Modernize Global Disease Monitoring, Information Sharing, and Response|journal=Emerg Infect Dis|year=2012|volume=18|issue=11|pages=e1|doi=10.3201/eid/1811.120453|pmid=23092707|pmc=3559169|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, several infectious disease control centers and other organizations took the initiative of a series of international scientific- and policy-meetings, to develop a common platform and to better understand the potentials of an interactive microbiological genomic database. The first meeting was in Brussels, September 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kupferschmidt|first=K|title=Epidemiology. Outbreak detectives embrace the genome era.|journal=Science|year=2011|volume=333|issue=6051|pages=1818–1819|pmid=21960605|doi=10.1126/science.333.6051.1818}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Consensus report of an expert meeting 1-2 September 2011, Brussels, Belgium.|url=http://www.food.dtu.dk/upload/f%C3%B8devareinstituttet/food.dtu.dk/publikationer/2011/consensus%20report%20perspectives%20of%20a%20global,%20real-time.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by meetings in Washington (March 2012) and Copenhagen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=GMI|title=GMI news and events|url=http://www.globalmicrobialidentifier.org/News-and-Events }}&lt;/ref&gt; (February 2013). In addition to experts from around the globe, Intergovernmental Organizations have been included in the action, notably the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and the [[World Organization for Animal Health]] (OIE).

== Development plan ==

A detailed roadmap&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=GMI|title=GMI development plan|url= http://www.globalmicrobialidentifier.org/~/media/Sites/gmi/About/roadmap-draft2.ashx }}&lt;/ref&gt; for the development of the database was set up with the following  general timeline:
:2010 - 2012: Development of pilot systems.&lt;ref name="X" /&gt;
:2011 - 2013: International structural start-up, with the formation of an international core group, analysis of the present and future landscape to build the database, and diplomacy efforts to bring the relevant groups together.
:2012 - 2016: Development of a robust IT-backbone for the database, and development of novel genome analysis algorithms and software.
:2017 - 2020: Construction of a global solution, including the creation of networks and regional hubs.

The term '''Growth Recession''' indicates a situation were growth is slow, but not low enough to be a technical recession, yet, unemployment increases since more jobs are lost than created.[http://www.ezonomics.com/whatis/a_growth_recession] The term was created{{When|date=July 2011}} by Dr. Solomon Fabricant (New York University, [[National Bureau of Economic Research]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hoisingtonmgt.com/HIM2007Q3NP.pdf], Van R. Hoisington, Lacy H. Hunt, Ph.D., Hoisington Quarterly Review and Outlook Third Quarter 2007, "Growth Recession"&lt;/ref&gt; and is recognized and cited more recently by business [[economist]]s. Note that the term also has slightly different secondary meanings including a more general one that growth is below potential. However, the more specific meaning indicates the growth is weak and insufficient to provide jobs for those entering the labor market (see the Hoisington and [[Lacy Hunt|Hunt]] reference). There may also be a third meaning referring to growth in which more jobs are actually being destroyed than created. In all cases the term indicates, Real [[GDP]] is expanding (slowly) but with job contraction, so the economy behaves or feels in many ways like a [[recession]].

A former Group Managing Director at [[Global Insight]] who is now at the [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]] uses the phrase in this quote:

{{Quote|My feeling at the time (2002-2003) was we had a recession followed by a growth recession till 03. That’s what I showed on those Global Insight recession/growth recession charts. Mike Nemeira (Chief Economist, International Council of Shopping Centers) a better expert than I am, and I debated this. He thought there was an argument for a quick full recovery then a lapse into a growth recession. There is no agreed standard for growth recession. But I would say while it looked stronger for a couple quarters, it wasn’t real strong.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}}}

[[soft landing (economics)|Soft landings]] tend to also be growth recessions but not always. If economic growth in the economy is slowing to such a point that establishment payroll growth contracts, then the soft landing is so soft it has crossed over into a Growth Recession. Both Soft Landings in the mid-1980s and 1990s qualify as for several months employment did contract. Two months in 1995 and one month in 1986.

[[Jobless recovery]], is another similar term. All jobless recoveries are by definition also growth recessions, however not all growth recessions are jobless recoveries because a growth recession can occur at any point in an [[economic cycle]], and a jobless recovery only refers to the period immediately after a recession ends.

The '''Industrial Socialist Labor Party''' and the '''Independent Labor Party''' were short lived socialist political parties in Australia in 1919 and the early 1920s. The Industrial Socialist Labor Party was founded by radical socialist members of the industrial wing of the [[Australian Labor Party]] (ALP), at a time when the ALP's socialist ideology was a matter of intra-party dispute. It was closely aligned with the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW) and the [[One Big Union (concept)|One Big Union]] (OBE) movement.

The party was formally founded at a conference in August 1919, with [[Arthur Rae]] becoming Secretary and [[Albert Willis (Australian politician)|Albert Willis]] President of the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article242590974 |title=New Socialist Group |newspaper=[[The Herald (Melbourne)|The Herald]] |issue=13,577 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=13 August 1919 |accessdate=5 April 2018 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party subsequently announced that it would run candidates for the seats of Illawarra and Cook in the [[Australian federal election, 1919|1919 federal election]] ([[George Burns (Australian politician)|George Burns]] and [[William McCristal]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article106480905 |title="INDUSTRIAL SOCIALIST LABOR. |newspaper=[[The Herald (Adelaide)|Daily Herald]] |volume=X, |issue=2984 |location=South Australia |date=13 October 1919 |accessdate=5 April 2018 |page=4 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article203692882 |title=SOCIALIST-LABOR OPPONENT FOR MR. CATTS. |newspaper=[[The Age]] |issue=20,165 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=13 November 1919 |accessdate=5 April 2018 |page=8 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; These candidates were opposed by endorsed ALP candidates and received less than 10% of the primary vote.

In January 1920, the party merged with the [[Socialist Labor Party (Australia)|Socialist Labor Party]], taking the name of the Socialist Labor Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article93021550 |title=SOCIALIST PARTIES. |newspaper=[[The Northern Star]] |volume=44 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=7 January 1920 |accessdate=5 April 2018 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article104827460 |title=SOCIALIST LABOR PARTY. |newspaper=[[Northern Daily Leader|Daily Observer]] |volume=X, |issue=12 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=15 January 1920 |accessdate=5 April 2018 |page=1 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Subsequently, one of the breakaway members [[Percy Brookfield]] won the seat of [[Electoral district of Sturt (New South Wales)|Sturt]] as an Independent Labor candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article165646435 |title=LATE MR. PERCY BROOKFIELD. |newspaper=[[The Observer (Adelaide)|The Observer]] |volume=LXXVIII, |issue=5852 |location=South Australia |date=26 March 1921 |accessdate=5 April 2018 |page=13 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brookfield  had the [[balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]] in the assembly following the election but was murdered the following year.

[[Michael Considine]], [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] member for [[Division of Barrier|Barrier]] in the federal [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] from 1917, joined the Independent Labor Party in 1920 after his expulsion from the ALP, and unsuccessfully contested the seat of [[Division of Darling|Darling]] for the party in 1922. [[Donald Grant]], one of 12 Australian IWW members gaoled in 1916, contested Sturt at the 1922 general election but received only 2.8% of the primary vote. He later became a member of parliament for the  Labor Party. Other members of the party who later became prominent in the ALP were [[Jock Garden]] and [[Jack Baddeley]].

Support for the party rapidly diminished after the ALP adopted the Socialist Objective in 1921, with many members returning to the ALP and others joining the [[Australian Communist Party]].

== History ==
[[File:Alex Jones &amp; Paul Joseph Watson (9072625782).jpg|thumb|[[Alex Jones]] with [[Paul Joseph Watson]]]]
InfoWars was created in 1999 by American [[conspiracy theorist]] Alex Jones, who remains its controlling influence.&lt;ref name="Business Insider"&gt;{{cite news |last=Relman |first=Eliza |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/alex-jones-bio-conspiracy-trump-megyn-kelly-2017-6 |title=How a public-access broadcaster from Austin, Texas, became a major conspiracy theorist and one of Trump's most vocal supporters |work=Business Insider |date=June 19, 2017 |accessdate=January 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="companiestx"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://companiestx.com/company/32034156953/free-speech-systems-llc |title=Free Speech Systems, Llc |website=companiestx.com|access-date=January 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''InfoWars'' features ''[[The Alex Jones Show]]'' on their broadcasts and was established as a public-access television program aired in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Texas]] in 1999.&lt;ref name="Business Insider" /&gt;

In 2016, [[Paul Joseph Watson]] was hired as [[editor-at-large]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The live-streamers who are challenging traditional journalism |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/12/11/the-live-streamers-who-are-challenging-traditional-journalism |publisher=[[The New Yorkers]] |date=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Top InfoWars editor criticizes Trump after anti-Muslim tweets |url=http://thehill.com/homenews/news/362288-top-infowars-editor-criticizes-trump-after-anti-muslim-tweets |work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |date=November 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2017, political commentator Dr [[Jerome Corsi]] was hired as Washington bureau chief,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Conspiracy Bureau: Alex Jones Teams Up With Jerome Corsi for White House Coverage |url=https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2017/02/02/conspiracy-bureau-alex-jones-teams-jerome-corsi-white-house-coverage |publisher=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]] |date=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; after InfoWars was granted a [[White House Correspondents' Association|White House]] day pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Conspiracy outlet InfoWars was granted temporary White House press credentials |url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/infowars-granted-white-house-press-credentials-2017-5 |publisher=[[Business Insider]] |date=May 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' has accused Corsi, who is [[Catholic]], "of being [[Islamophobic|anti-Islamic]], [[anti-Catholic]], [[anti-Semitic]] and [[homophobia|homophobic]], and of exploiting [[racism|racial prejudices]] in an attempt to 'scare white America{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/07/uselections2008.kenya |title=Author of anti-Barack Obama book detained in Kenya |accessdate=August 2, 2008 |first=Lee |last=Glendinning |date=October 7, 2008 |work=The Guardian |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, it was announced [[Roger Stone]], a former campaign advisor for [[Donald Trump]], would be hosting his own ''InfoWars'' show "five nights a week", with an extra studio being built to accommodate his show.&lt;ref name="Stone" /&gt;

In March 2018, some of the biggest brands in the U.S. suspended their ads from InfoWars' YouTube channels, after CNN notified them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://money.cnn.com/2018/03/03/technology/youtube-ads-infowars-alex-jones/index.html |title=Advertisers flee InfoWars founder Alex Jones' YouTube channel |authors=Paul P.

In July 2018, [[YouTube]] removed four of InfoWars' uploaded videos that violated its policy against [[hate speech]] and suspended posts for 90 days. Facebook also banned Jones after it determined four videos on his pages violated its community standards in July 2018.&lt;ref name=BBCNews/&gt;&lt;ref name=ArtsTechnica/&gt; In August 2018, YouTube, Apple, and Facebook removed content from Jones and InfoWars, citing their policies against hate speech and harassment.&lt;ref name=CNNMoney2018/&gt;

==Business aspects==
While Jones has stated, "I'm not a business guy, I'm a revolutionary", he spends much of InfoWars air time pitching health-enhancement and survivalist products to loyal viewers.  As a private firm, Infowars and its affiliated companies ("a web of limited-liability companies") do not have to report make public financial statements, so that observers can only estimate its revenue and profits.&lt;ref name=nyt-7-9-2018/&gt;

Prior to 2013, Jones focused on building a "media empire".&lt;ref name="nym-brown-4-5-17"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Brown |first1=Seth |title=Alex Jones’s Media Empire Is a Machine Built to Sell Snake-Oil Diet Supplements |url=http://nymag.com/selectall/2017/05/how-does-alex-jones-make-money.html |accessdate=9 September 2018 |work=[[New York (magazine)|''New York'' (magazine)]] |date=May 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2013,  Alex Seitz-Wald of ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' estimated that Jones was earning as much as [[USD|USD$]]10 million a year between subscriptions, web and radio advertising, and sales of DVDs, T-shirts, and other merchandise.&lt;ref name="salon"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sietz-Wald |first1=Alex |title=Alex Jones: Conspiracy Inc. |url=https://www.salon.com/2013/05/02/alex_jones_conspiracy_inc/ |website=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |accessdate=9 September 2018 |date=May 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That year, Jones changed his business model to incorporate selling proprietary dietary supplements, including one that promises to "supercharge" cognitive functions.&lt;ref name="nym-brown-4-5-17"/&gt;  

Unlike most talk radio shows, InfoWars itself does not directly generate income. It gets no  syndication fees from its syndicater GCN, no cut of the advertising that GCN sells, and it does not sell its three minutes per hour of national advertising time. The show no longer promotes its video service  (though it still exists), and has not made any documentary films since 2012.&lt;ref name="nym-brown-4-5-17"/&gt;  Virtually all money is made by selling Jones' dietary supplements to viewers and listeners.&lt;ref name="nym-brown-4-5-17"/&gt;

The diet supplement products sold on Infowars are "largely produced by Dr. Edward F. Group III, a Houston [[chiropractor]] and founder of dietary-supplement-maker Global Healing Center".&lt;ref name="nym-brown-4-5-17"/&gt;

A lesser source of revenue for InfoWars are its "money bomb" [[telethons]], which resemble "public-radio fund drives", except that InfoWars is a for-profit institution. Charlie Warzel reports that "three former Infowars "employees told BuzzFeed News that a money bomb could easily raise $100,000 in a day".&lt;ref name="warzel-buzz-2017"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Warzel |first1=Charlie |title=Alex Jones Just Can't Help Himself |url=https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/charliewarzel/alex-jones-will-never-stop-being-alex-jones |website=[[BuzzFeed News]] |publisher=[[BuzzFeed]] |accessdate=9 September 2018 |date=May 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2014, "operations were bringing in more than $20 million a year in revenue ... according to testimony Mr. Jones gave in a court case". Most of his revenue in 2014 "came from the sale of products like supplements", according to records "viewed by ''[[The New York Times]]''".&lt;ref name=nyt-7-9-2018/&gt;  2014 court proceedings also show that InfoWars was successful enough for Jones and his wife at that time to be planning to "build a swimming pool complex ... featuring a waterfall and dining cabana with a stone fireplace. Mr. Jones bought four Rolex watches in one day in 2014, and spent $40,000 on a saltwater aquarium. Assets of Jones and his wife at the time "included a $70,000 grand piano, $50,000 in firearms and $752,000 in silver, gold and precious metals".&lt;ref name=nyt-7-9-2018/&gt;

The loss of social media platforms from being banned by Facebook, YouTube, Apple, Spotify and Pinterest may have led to appeals by Jones to viewers: "The enemy wants to cut off our funding to destroy us. If you don't fund us, we'll be shut down."&lt;ref name=nyt-7-9-2018/&gt;

== Controversies ==
=== Promotion of conspiracy theories and fake news ===
InfoWars disseminates various conspiracy theories, such as speaking against the [[HPV vaccine]]&lt;ref name=vox&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/4/6/15160486/alex-jones-vaccines-autism-gates-fungus-health-conspiracy-theories |title=I watched Alex Jones give his viewers health advice.

InfoWars advocates [[New World Order conspiracy theories]], [[9/11 conspiracy theories]], [[chemtrails]], conspiracy theories involving [[Bill Gates]], supposed covert government [[weather control]] programs, claims of rampant domestic [[false flag]] operations by the US Government (including 9/11) and the unsupported claim that millions voted illegally in the 2016 US presidential election.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/lists/alex-jones-mis-infowars-7-bat-sht-conspiracy-theories-w467509/former-fox-news-host-glenn-beck-is-a-cia-operative-w468041 |title=Alex Jones' Mis-Infowars: 7 Bat-Sh*t Conspiracy Theories |access-date=December 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.newsweek.com/who-alex-jones-his-top-five-conspiracy-theories-ahead-nbc-megyn-kelly-626633 |title=Alex Jones says 9/11, the Sandy Hook shooting and the Boston Marathon bombing were "false flag" operations |date=June 16, 2017 |work=Newsweek |access-date=December 30, 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones frequently uses InfoWars to assert that new high-profile mass shootings are conspiracies or "false flag" operations, claims which are often then spread.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/09/business/media/las-vegas-massacre-infowars-conspiracy.html |title=Las Vegas Massacre Gives InfoWars More Conspiracy Fodder |last=Grynbaum |first=Michael M. |date=October 9, 2017 |work=The New York Times |access-date=December 30, 2017 |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/donald-trump-and-the-amazing-alex-jones |title=Donald Trump and the "Amazing" Alex Jones |last=Finnegan |first=William |date=June 23, 2016 |work=The New Yorker |access-date=December 30, 2017 |issn=0028-792X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been characterized as [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] "fan fiction".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/news/2014-03-12/no-armed-protests-are-not-normal-in-austin/ |title=No, Armed Protests Are Not Normal in Austin |access-date=December 30, 2017 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From May 2014 to November 2017, InfoWars [[Plagiarism|republished articles from multiple sources without permission]], including over 1,000 from Russian state-sponsored news network [[RT (TV network)|RT]], as well as a smaller number of stories{{how many|date=September 2018}} from news outlets such as [[CNN]], the [[BBC]], and ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lytvynenko |first=Jane |title=InfoWars Has Republished More Than 1,000 Articles From RT Without Permission |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/janelytvynenko/infowars-is-running-rt-content/ |publisher=[[BuzzFeed News]] |date=November 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Link |first1=Taylor |title=Infowars peddled stories from a Russian propaganda outlet for years |url=https://www.salon.com/2017/11/09/infowars-peddled-stories-from-a-russian-propaganda-outlet-for-years/ |accessdate=September 16, 2018 |work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |date=November 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Claims of false flag school shootings ===
InfoWars has regularly accused mass shootings of being false flags and survivors of them as crisis actors by the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]]. InfoWars host Alex Jones has promoted the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting conspiracy theories]]. Jones was widely criticized for claiming that the Sandy Hook massacre was "completely fake" and "manufactured".&lt;ref name="nydailynews"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/alex-jones-doubles-completely-fake-sandy-hook-claims-article-1.2878305 |title=Alex Jones doubles down on 'completely fake' Sandy Hook claims |website=Daily News |location=New York |accessdate=December 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018, six families of victims of the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]] as well as an FBI agent who responded to the attack filed a defamation lawsuit against Jones for his role in spreading conspiracy theories about the shooting.&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/23/us/alex-jones-sandy-hook-suit/index.html |title= Alex Jones, 'InfoWars' host, sued by 6 more Sandy Hook families |author= Aaron Cooper |work= [[CNN]] |date= 24 May 2018 |accessdate= 26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Independent&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/alex-jones-sued-sandy-hook-victims-families-defamation-infowars-a8368346.html |title= US shock jock Alex Jones sued by six more families of Sandy Hook victims |author= Emily Shugerman |work = [[The Independent]] |date= 25 May 2018 |accessdate= 26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=USATodaySH&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/05/24/sandy-hook-families-sue-infowars-alex-jones-over-conspiracy-theory/641159002/ |title= Sandy Hook families suing Alex Jones aren't the only ones to threaten conspiracy theorist |author= Josh Hafner |work =  [[USA Today]] |date= 23 May 2018 |accessdate= 26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CTT&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-sandy-hook-alex-jones-lawsuit-20180523-story.html |title= More families of Sandy Hook victims, FBI agent sue Infowars' Alex Jones |author= Dave Collins |work = [[Associated Press]] [[Chicago Tribune]] |date= 23 May 2018 |accessdate= 26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones has also accused [[David Hogg (activist)|David Hogg]] and other survivors of the [[Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School|Stoneman Douglas High School]] shooting of being [[crisis actor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://fortune.com/2018/02/24/youtube-pulls-alex-jones-infowars-video/ |title=YouTube Pulls Alex Jones Video Saying Parkland Victims Were Actors |work=Fortune|access-date=2018-02-28 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Harassment by InfoWars viewership ===
InfoWars promoted fabricated [[Pizzagate]] claims. The fake claims led to harassment of the owner and employees of [[Comet Ping Pong]], a Washington, D.C. pizzeria targeted by the conspiracy theories, including threatening phone calls, online harassment, and [[death threat]]s. The owner sent a letter to Jones in February 2017 demanding a retraction or apology. (Such a letter is required before a party may seek [[punitive damages]] in an action for libel under [[Texas law]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act |title= Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code |type=Chapter |number=73. Libel |date=June 14, 2013 |article=4. Liability in Tort |article-type=Title |page= |url=https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/CP/htm/CP.73.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After receiving the letter, Jones issued an apology in March 2017. Alex Jones said that "I want our viewers and listeners to know that we regret any negative impact our commentaries may have had on Mr. Alefantis, Comet Ping Pong, or its employees. We apologize to the extent our commentaries could be construed as negative statements about Mr. Alefantis or Comet Ping Pong, and we hope that anyone else involved in commenting on Pizzagate will do the same thing." InfoWars also issued a correction on its website.&lt;ref name="npr"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/03/26/521545788/conspiracy-theorist-alex-jones-apologizes-for-promoting-pizzagate |title=Conspiracy Theorist Alex Jones Apologizes For Promoting Comet Ping Pong 'Pizzagate' Fabrication |author=James Doubek |date=March 26, 2017 |publisher=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

InfoWars reporter Owen Shroyer also targeted East Side Pies, a group of pizza restaurants in Austin, Texas, with similar fake "Pizzagate" claims. Following the claims, the pizza business was targeted by phone threats, vandalism, and harassment, which the co-owners called "alarming, disappointing, disconcerting and scary."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mystatesman.com/news/crime--law/how-austin-east-side-pies-became-target-fake-pizzagate/jQJtrr2xVIMNmpWc0IOW5O/ |title=How Austin's East Side Pies became target of fake #pizzagate |author=Matthew Odam |date=December 7, 2017 |website=Austin American-Statesman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chobani retraction ===
In 2017, InfoWars (along with similar sites) published a fake story about U.S. yogurt manufacturer [[Chobani]], with headlines including "Idaho yogurt maker caught importing migrant rapists" and "Allegations that Chobani's practice of hiring refugees brought crime and tuberculosis to [[Twin Falls, Idaho|Twin Falls]]". Chobani ultimately filed a federal lawsuit against Jones, which led to a [[Settlement (law)|settlement]] on confidential terms in May 2017. Jones offered an apology and retraction, admitting that he had made "certain statements" on InfoWars "that I now understand to be wrong".&lt;ref name=wattles/&gt;&lt;ref name=Montero/&gt;

=== Sexual harassment and antisemitism claims ===
In February 2018, Alex Jones was accused by former employees of [[antisemitism]] and [[Sexual harassment|sexual harassment of women staff members]]''.'' Jones denied the allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/alex-jones-infowars-employees-complaint-about-sexual-harassment-2018-2 |title=Former Infowars staffers filed a formal complaint against conspiracy theorist Alex Jones alleging anti-Semitism, racism, and sexual misconduct |work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/alex-jones-accused-of-sexual-harassment-bullying-at-infowars |title=Alex Jones Accused of Sexual Harassment, Bullying at InfoWars |date=2018-02-28 |website=The Daily Beast |language=en|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two former employees filed complaints against Jones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/alex-jones-accused-sexual-harassment-racism-anti-semitism-article-1.3848193|title=Alex Jones accused of sexual harassment, racism and anti-Semitism|work=NY Daily News|access-date=2018-03-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Removals from other websites ===
On July 27, 2018, [[Facebook]] suspended the official page of [[pundit]] and political commentator Alex Jones for 30 days. The website claims that Jones participated in [[hate speech]] against [[Robert Mueller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/27/facebook-suspends-us-conspiracy-theorist-alex-jones|title=Facebook suspends US conspiracy theorist Alex Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was swiftly followed by action from other bodies- on August 6, Facebook, [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[YouTube]] and [[Spotify]] all removed content by Alex Jones and InfoWars from their platforms for violating their policies. YouTube removed channels associated with Infowars, including The Alex Jones Channel, which had gained 2.4 million subscriptions prior to its removal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=August 14, 2018 |title=Facebook, Apple, YouTube and Spotify ban Infowars' Alex Jones  |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/06/apple-removes-podcasts-infowars-alex-jones |work=The Guardian |access-date=August 14, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On Facebook, four pages associated with InfoWars and Alex Jones were removed due to repeated violations of the website's policies. Apple removed all podcasts associated with Jones from its [[iTunes]] platform and its podcast app.&lt;ref name="CNNMoney2018"/&gt; On August 13, [[Vimeo]] removed all of Jones' videos because they "violated our terms of service prohibitions on discriminatory and hateful content".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Zhao |first=Christina |date=August 14, 2018 |title=Vimeo Removes Alex Jones's InfoWars Content: 'Discriminatory and Hateful' |url=https://www.newsweek.com/vimeo-removes-alex-jones-infowars-profit-discriminatory-hateful-1070036 |work=Newsweek |access-date=August 14, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones' accounts have also been removed from [[Pinterest]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Morse |first=Jack |date=August 6, 2018 |title=InfoWars' Pinterest page goes offline after Mashable inquiry |url=https://mashable.com/2018/08/06/infowars-pinterest-site-offline/ |work=Mashable |access-date=August 14, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[MailChimp]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lomas |first=Natasha |date=August 7, 2018 |title=MailChimp bans Alex Jones for hateful conduct |url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/07/mailchimp-bans-alex-jones-for-hateful-conduct/ |work=Techcrunch |access-date=August 14, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[LinkedIn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Zhou |first=Marrian |date=August 7, 2018 |title=Alex Jones' Infowars removed from LinkedIn and MailChimp |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/alex-jones-infowars-removed-linkedin-pinterest-still-up-on-instagram-twitter/ |work=CNET |access-date=August 14, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of early August, Jones still had active accounts on [[Instagram]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Frej |first=Willa |date=August 7, 2018 |title=Alex Jones' Infowars Still Not Banned On App Stores, Instagram And Twitter |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/alex-Jones-infowars-app-apple-google_us_5b694ec3e4b0de86f4a4bc1d |work=Huffington Post |access-date=August 14, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Twitter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Chan |first=Kelvin |date=August 8, 2018 |title=Twitter CEO defends decision not to ban Alex Jones, Infowars |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-twitter-alex-jones-infowars-20180808-story.html |work=Chicago Tribune |location= |access-date=August 14, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Darcy |first=Oliver |date=August 10, 2018 |title=Twitter admits InfoWars violated its rules, but says it will remain on the platform |url=https://money.cnn.com/2018/08/10/media/infowars-twitter-alex-jones/index.html |work=CNN |access-date=August 14, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Twitter, however, ultimately decided to permanently deactivate Jones' account as well as the InfoWars account in September 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Liao |first1=Shannon |title=Twitter permanently suspends Infowars and Alex Jones |url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/6/17829188/twitter-permanently-suspension-infowars-alex-jones |accessdate=September 16, 2018 |work=[[The Verge]] |publisher=Vox Media |date=September 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones tweeted a [[Periscope (app)|Periscope]] video calling on others "to get their battle rifles ready against antifa, the mainstream media, and Chicom operatives".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/5944zn/alex-jones-twitter-ban-infowars|title=Alex Jones responds to his Twitter ban by posting a 13-minute video to Twitter|publisher=Vice News|date=August 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the video he also says, "Now is time to act on the enemy before they do a false flag." Twitter cited this as the reason to suspend his account for a week on August 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://money.cnn.com/2018/08/14/media/twitter-alex-jones/index.html|title=Twitter suspends conspiracy theorist Alex Jones for one week|publisher=CNN Money|date=August 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 6, Twitter permanently banned InfoWars and Alex Jones for repeated violations of the site's terms and conditions. Twitter cited abusive behavior, namely a video that "shows Jones shouting at and berating CNN journalist Oliver Darcy for some 10 minutes during congressional hearings about social media."&lt;ref name=CBSNews/&gt; On September 7, 2018, the Infowars app was removed from the [[App Store (iOS)|Apple App Store]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-infowars/apple-inc-bans-alex-jones-app-for-objectionable-content-idUSKCN1LO04G|title=Apple Inc bans Alex Jones app for 'objectionable content'|last=Whitcomb|first=Dan|work=Reuters|date=September 8, 2018|access-date=September 8, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 20, 2018, PayPal informed InfoWars that they would cease processing payments in 10 days. The reason cited was that Infowars' "promotion of hate and discrimination runs counter to our core value of inclusion."&lt;ref name=PayPalTermination&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/21/technology/paypal-blocks-infowars.html|title=PayPal Cuts Off Alex Jones’s Infowars, Joining Other Tech Giants|last=Popper|first=Nathaniel|work=New York Times|date=September 21, 2018|access-date=September 26, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alex Jones is the main host, and operator of InfoWars. The show is a platform for other hosts as well.

=== Owen Shroyer ===
Owen Shroyer (born 1989) is an American political activist and commentator from St. Louis who now lives and works in Texas. He is considered to be part of the US [[alt-right]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/london-life/from-milo-yiannopoulos-to-tomi-lahren-meet-the-faces-of-americas-young-altright-pack-a3415301.html |title=Milo Yiannopoulos to Tomi Lahren: the faces of America's young alt-Right pack |work=London Evening Standard |date=December 8, 2016 |accessdate=December 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shroyer previously worked as an AM radio host in [[St. Louis]] on [[KXFN]] and later [[KFNS (AM)|KFNS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/radio-host-protests-police-state-in-ferguson/article_3bcf8feb-8e2e-5f9e-abad-36f3de24425e.html |title=Radio host protests 'police state' in Ferguson |publisher=St. Louis Post-Dispatch |date=August 13, 2014 |access-date=December 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stltoday.com/sports/other/media-views-no-kidding-comedy-is-key-in-new-kfns/article_e3e22388-3166-5ea7-a2ed-93b5191c82e3.html |title=Media Views: No kidding — comedy is key in new KFNS lineup |first=Dan |last=Caesar |website=StLToday.com|access-date=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began hosting a [[podcast]] and posting YouTube videos of his views.

Shroyer has been quoted as supporting conspiracy theories about the [[List of conspiracy theories#The Clintons|Clinton family]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/08/29/in-one-corner-of-the-internet-the-2016-democratic-primary-never-ended/ |title=Analysis – In one corner of the Internet, the 2016 Democratic primary never ended |first=David |last=Weigel |date=August 29, 2017 |access-date=December 28, 2017 |via=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, Shroyer stopped [[CNN]] presenter [[Van Jones]] in the streets of Cleveland and attempted to engage him in an unscheduled on-camera debate. Van Jones participated willingly, and put forward well-constructed arguments, leading Shroyer to admit his opinion of Van Jones had changed favorably following the encounter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/gregory-mengel/van-jones-schools-us-all_b_11126010.html |title=Van Jones Schools Us All |first=Gregory |last=Mengel |date=July 22, 2016 |website=HuffPost|access-date=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rawstory.com/2016/07/watch-rising-right-wing-star-tries-to-take-down-van-jones-but-gets-taught-an-epic-lesson-instead/ |title=Rising right-wing star tries to take down Van Jones — but gets taught an epic lesson instead |publisher=Raw Story |date=July 24, 2016 |access-date=December 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jason Jay, Gabriel Grant (2017). ''Breaking Through Gridlock: The Power of Conversation in a Polarized World'', Berrett-Koehler Publishers. {{ISBN|1626568952}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 2, 2017, while covering a pro-immigrant rally that took place in Austin, Texas, for InfoWars, Shroyer repeatedly put questions to protesters. He started to question a teenager, Olivia Williams, about her views. She, in return, called him a "fucking idiot", leading to international coverage of the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.salon.com/2017/09/07/girl-swears-out-infowars-reporter/ |title=Girl Swears Out InfoWars Reporter |work=Salon |date=September 7, 2017 |access-date=December 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, Shroyer was quoted as saying that Trump supporters outnumbered anti-Trump protesters at an [[Antifa (United States)|antifa]] rally held in Austin on November 4, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/875799/Antifa-protests-flop-Anti-Donald-Trump-protests-USA-outnumbered-supporters |title=Antifa rally a 'COMPLETE FLOP': Anti-Trump protestors OUTNUMBERED by supporters |first=Vickiie |last=Oliphant |date=November 5, 2017 |website=Daily Express|access-date=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infowars headlines had previously supported a conspiracy theory that the event would be the beginning of a planned "insurgency" against Trump, although Shroyer had said he did not believe antifa was a real threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kang |first1=Inkoo |title=Antifa Is Clickbait for Conspiracy Theorists |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2017/11/conspiracy_theorists_are_obsessed_with_nov_4_and_antifa_because_it_s_clickbait.html |accessdate=24 February 2018 |work=Slate |date=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WeaponsInspector.JPG|thumb|right|300px|A UN weapons inspector in Iraq.]]

The '''Iraq disarmament crisis''' was claimed as one of primary issues that led to the [[Multinational force in Iraq|multinational]] [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion]] of [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]] on 20 March 2003. Since the 1980s, Iraq was widely assumed to have been producing and extensively running the programs of [[Iraqi biological weapons program|biological]], [[Iraqi chemical weapons program|chemical]] and [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|nuclear weapons]]. During the heights of [[Iran–Iraq War]], Iraq had used its offensive [[Iraqi chemical weapons program|chemical program]] [[Halabja poison gas attack|against]] [[Iran]] and [[Al-Anfal Campaign|Kurdish civilians]], also in the 1980s. With the [[France|French]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] assistance given to Iraqi nuclear program, its [[Osirak Nuclear Reactor|primary facility]] was [[Operation Opera|secretly destroyed]] by [[Israel]] in 1981.

After the [[Gulf War]] in 1990, the [[UNSCOM|United Nations]] located and destroyed large quantities of Iraqi chemical weapons and related equipment and materials with varying degrees of Iraqi cooperation and obstruction, but the Iraqi cooperation later diminished in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Cleminson, Ronald. [http://www.armscontrol.org/act/2003_09/Cleminson_09 What Happened to Saddam's Weapons of Mass Destruction?] Arms Control Association. September 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The disarmament issue remained tense throughout the [[Iraq disarmament timeline 1990–2003|1990s]] with U.S. at the UN, repeatedly demanding Iraq to allow inspections teams to its facilities. Finally, this disarmament crises reached to its climax in [[Iraq disarmament crisis timeline 2001-2003|2002-2003]], when [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]] demanded a complete end to what he alleged was Iraqi production of [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]], and reasoned with [[President of Iraq|Iraqi President]] [[Saddam Hussein]] to comply with [[List of United Nations Security Council resolutions concerning Iraq|UN Resolutions]] requiring [[UN weapons inspectors]] unfettered access to areas those inspectors thought might have weapons production facilities.

Since the [[Gulf War]] in 1991, Iraq had been [[United Nations actions regarding Iraq|restricted]] by the [[United Nations]] (UN) from developing or possessing such weapons. It was also required to permit inspections to confirm Iraqi compliance. Bush repeatedly backed demands for unfettered inspection and disarmament with threats of invasion. On 20 March 2003, a [[Multinational force in Iraq|multinational alliance]] containing the armed forces of the [[United States armed forces|United States]] and [[British forces|United Kingdom]] launched an [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion]] of Iraq in 2003. After the [[withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq]] in 2011, a number of [[failed Iraqi peace initiatives]] were revealed.

==Background==
In the decade following the 1991 Gulf War, the [[United Nations]] passed 16 [[United Nations Security Council Resolution|Security Council resolutions]] calling for the complete elimination of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. [[United Nations member states|Member states]] communicated their frustration over the years that Iraq was impeding the work of the [[United Nations Special Commission|special commission]] and failing to take seriously its disarmament obligations. Iraqi security forces had on several occasions physically prevented weapons inspectors from doing their job and in at least one case, took documents away from them.

On 29 September 1998, the [[United States Congress]] passed the ''[[Iraq Liberation Act]]'' supporting the efforts of [[Iraqi anti-Saddam groups|Iraqi opposition groups]] to remove Saddam Hussein from office. The Act was signed by President Clinton on 31 October 1998. On the same day, Iraq announced it would no longer cooperate with United Nations weapons inspectors.

The UN, under [[Kofi Annan]], brokered a deal wherein Iraq would allow weapons inspectors back into the country. Iraq ceased cooperating with inspectors only days later. The inspectors left the country in December. Inspectors returned the following year as part of The [[United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission]] (UNMOVIC).

[[Paul Wolfowitz]], the military analyst for the [[United States Department of Defense]] under [[Ronald Reagan]], had formulated a new [[United States foreign policy|foreign policy]] with regard to Iraq and other "potential aggressor states", dismissing "containment" in favor of "[[Preemptive war|preemption]]", with the goal of striking first to eliminate threats.

This policy was short-lived, however, and Clinton, along with [[George H. W. Bush]], [[Colin Powell]], and other former Bush administration officials, dismissed calls for preemption in favor of continued containment. This was the policy of George W. Bush as well for his first several months in office. The [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] brought to life Wolfowitz's and other "hawks'" advocacy for [[pre-emptive war|preemptive action]]; Iraq was widely agreed to be a likely subject of this new policy. Powell continued to support the philosophy behind containment.

Following the Gulf War, the [[Iraqi Army]] was reduced to 23 divisions with a total of about 375,000 troops. The [[Iraqi Air Force]] was reduced to less than 300 aircraft. The [[Iraqi Navy]] was almost completely destroyed, and its few remaining operational vessels were in a poor state of repair, the crews were estimated to be in a poor state of readiness, and its capabilities were reduced to that of limited mining and raiding missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iraq/navy.htm |title=Iraqi Navy |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any rebuilding that was done went into the [[Republican Guard (Iraq)|Republican Guard]], and the formation of the [[Special Republican Guard]].

{{Main|United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441}}
{{Expand section|date=September 2007}}
During most of 2002 and into 2003, the [[United States government]] continued to call for "[[regime change]]" in [[Iraq]] and threatened to use military force to overthrow the Iraqi government unless Iraq rid itself of all [[weapons of mass destruction]] (WMD) it supposedly possessed and convinced the UN that it had done so.

US diplomatic pressure to bring Iraq to compliance quickly created a diplomatic crisis in the UN, where some members were in agreement with the U.S. position, while others dissented, notably the permanent Security Council members [[France]], [[Russia]] and the [[People's Republic of China]], and fellow [[NATO]] members [[Germany]] and [[Belgium]].

The [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] began a military buildup in the region, and after pushing hard gained passage of [[UN Security Council Resolution 1441]]. Led by [[Hans Blix]], Head of the [[United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission]] (UNMOVIC) and [[Mohamed ElBaradei]] [[Director General]] of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA), the Resolution brought weapons inspectors back to Iraq in November 2002.

Inspectors began visiting sites where WMD production was suspected, but found no evidence of such activities, except for 18 undeclared empty 122&amp;nbsp;mm chemical rockets that were destroyed under UNMOVIC supervision. [https://www.un.org/Depts/unmovic/new/documents/quarterly_reports/s-2003-580.pdf P. 30] Inspectors also found that the Al-Samoud-2 and Al-fatah missiles violated the UN range restrictions, the former also being partially destroyed under UNMOVIC supervision.

On March 7, 2003 Hans Blix reported accelerated cooperation throughout the month of February but it was still not "immediate" and "unconditional" as called for by UN Security Council Resolution 1441.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WO0303/S00109.htm Blix welcomes accelerated cooperation by Iraq] [[Scoop (news website)|Scoop]] March 7, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; He informed the UN security council that "it will not take years, nor weeks, but months" to verify whether Iraq had complied with its disarmament obligations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/2829213.stm Blix: Inspectors 'need months'] [[BBC News]] March 7, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/03/07/sprj.irq.un.transcript.blix/index.html Transcript of Blix's U.N. presentation] [[CNN]] March 7, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] met in the [[Azores]] islands for an "emergency summit" over the weekend of March 15–16, 2003, after which Bush declared that, despite Blix's report, "diplomacy had failed" to compel Iraq to comply with UN Resolution inspection requirements, and stated his intention to use military force to attack Iraq in what was, according to the Bush administration, compliance with the threat of "serious consequences" in UN 1441.

==UNSC disagreement==
[[File:Bush 2002 UNGA.jpg|thumb|250px|[[George W. Bush]] addressed the [[General Assembly of the United Nations]] on 12 September 2002 to outline the complaints of the United States government against the Iraqi government]]

Several close allies of the U.S. (e.g. [[Germany]], [[Belgium]] and [[France]]) opposed a [[military intervention]] because they asserted it would increase rather than decrease the risk of [[terrorist]] attacks. Although the [[British government]] and some governments of other members of the [[European Union|EU]] and [[NATO]] supported the US position, opinion polls show that in general their populations were against an attack, especially an attack without clear UN Security Council support. Millions of people in the major cities of [[Europe]], and hundreds of thousands in major cities of [[North America]], participated in [[February 15, 2003 anti-war protest|peace marches]] on 15 February 2003.

===Statements by President Bush===
On 7 October 2002 President Bush stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Eleven years ago, as a condition for ending the Persian Gulf War, the Iraqi regime was required to destroy its weapons of mass destruction, to cease all development of such weapons, and to stop all support for terrorist groups. The Iraqi regime has violated all of those obligations. It possesses and produces chemical and biological weapons. It is seeking nuclear weapons. It has given shelter and support to terrorism, and practices terror against its own people. The entire world has witnessed Iraq's eleven-year history of defiance, deception and bad faith.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/10/20021007-8.html |title=President Bush Outlines Iraqi Threat |publisher=Georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 17 March 2003 Bush stated in an address to the nation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Intelligence gathered by this and other governments leaves no doubt that the Iraq regime continues to possess and conceal some of the most lethal weapons ever devised. This regime has already used weapons of mass destruction against Iraq's neighbors and against Iraq's people.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/03/20030317-7.html |title=President Says Saddam Hussein Must Leave Iraq Within 48 Hours |publisher=Georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Two days later on March 19, 2003, as the invasion of Iraq began, Bush stated in an address to the nation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"My fellow citizens, at this hour, American and coalition forces are in the early stages of military operations to disarm Iraq, to free its people and to defend the world from grave danger.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/03/20030319-17.html |title=President Bush Addresses the Nation |publisher=Georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Statement by Russian President Vladimir Putin===
On October 11, 2002, [[Russian President]] [[Vladimir Putin]] met with then British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]]. At a news conference, he said:

: ''[[Russia]] does not have in its possession any trustworthy data that supports the existence of nuclear weapons or any weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and we have not received any such information from our partners as yet.''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,2763,810093,00.html Russian rebuff for Blair over Iraq] The Guardian October 11, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statements by French President Jacques Chirac===
In a February 2003 joint declaration by Russia, Germany and France, [[Jacques Chirac]] remarked:

: ''As far as France is concerned, we are ready to envisage everything that can be done under UNSCR 1441. ... But I repeat that every possibility offered by the present resolution must be explored, that there are a lot of them and they still leave us with a lot of leeway when it comes to ways of achieving the objective of eliminating any weapons of mass destruction which may exist in Iraq. I'd like nevertheless to note that, as things stand at the moment, I have, to my knowledge, no indisputable proof in this sphere.''&lt;ref&gt;[https://pastel.diplomatie.gouv.fr/editorial/actual/ael2/bulletin.gb.asp?liste=20030211.gb.html JOINT DECLARATION BY RUSSIA, GERMANY AND FRANCE ON IRAQ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512001853/https://pastel.diplomatie.gouv.fr/editorial/actual/ael2/bulletin.gb.asp?liste=20030211.gb.html |date=2011-05-12 }} France Diplomatie February 10, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality==
{{Main|Legality of the Iraq War}}

===Authority under International Law===
The position of whether the invasion was legal under [[international law]] is unclear. Article 2 of the [[United Nations Charter]] forbids UN members from employing "the threat or use of force" against other states in a manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations. Two exceptions exist to the rule: self-defense (Article 51) or an authorization by the Security Council to protect international peace and security (Chapter VII).

The government of the United States said publicly, and the British pledged privately, that they were willing to invade Iraq with or without Security Council authorization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://politics.guardian.co.uk/iraq/story/0,,1700881,00.html Blair-Bush deal before Iraq war revealed in secret memo] [[The Guardian]] February 3, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been two military actions carried out with the approval of the Security Council. These two instances were the [[Korean War]] and the [[1991 Gulf War]].

The United States does not recognize the jurisdiction of any international court over its citizens or military, holding that the [[United States Supreme Court]] is its final authority. One example of this policy is that the United States did not ratify the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC) treaty, and on 6 May 2002 it informed the UN that it has no intention to do so.

As of 24 February 2005 neither Iraq nor the United States have ratified the ICC treaty, and therefore neither the US attack on Iraq nor subsequent actions in Iraq fall under the jurisdiction of the ICC. The actions of signatories such as the United Kingdom and [[Spain]] could however fall under the ICC jurisdiction.

On March 17, 2003, [[Peter Goldsmith, Baron Goldsmith|Peter Goldsmith]], [[Attorney General for England and Wales]], set out his government's legal justification for an invasion of Iraq. He said that the 1990 [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 678|Security Council Resolution 678]] authorised force against Iraq, which was suspended but not terminated by the 1991 [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 687|Resolution 687]], which imposed continuing obligations on Iraq to eliminate its weapons of mass destruction. A material breach of resolution 687 would revive the authority to use force under resolution 678. In Resolution 1441 the Security Council determined that Iraq was in material breach of resolution 687 because it had not fully carried out its obligations to disarm, and in early 2003 sent teams of weapons inspectors to verify the [[facts on the ground]].

Most member governments of the United Nations Security Council made clear that in their view, after resolution 1441 there was still no authorization for the use of force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldpress.org/specials/iraq/ |title=International Law - War in Iraq - United Nations - Iraq |publisher=Worldpress.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the US and its allies argued that no resolution authorizing the invasion would be necessary anyway as they acted in self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter and by [[customary international law]]. The exercise of that right could not be banned by ceasefire. Since Iraq was not actively disarming themselves and hid WMDs from UN inspectors many times, the US and its allies had every right to assume that Iraq was holding WMDs. If the UN failed to force compliance, the US and the UK - as parties of the 1991 conflict - would invade Iraq without the UN, as they had already done in their intervention in the [[Kosovo War]]. [[Yoram Dinstein]] equates this to [[police officers]] cornering a convicted violent felon and saying "put your hands on your head", but instead he pulls something small and black (whether a gun or not) out of his pocket. Officers would have been justified in shooting him because he could have possessed something that is dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=War, Aggression and Self-Defence |pages=298–299 |date=December 12, 2011 |author=Yoram Dinstein |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Authority under US Constitution===
The [[US Constitution|Constitution]] grants the power to declare war exclusively to the [[United States Congress]], but declares the President to be [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the [[US military]]. Because of this division of power, there has long been controversy regarding the authority of the President outside of a declared war. Nonetheless, of the many instances the United States has exercised force outside its borders, only five have been as part of a [[Declaration of war by the United States|declared war]].

In 1973, amid increasing domestic controversy about the [[Vietnam War]], Congress passed the [[War Powers Resolution]] to limit the ability of the president to undertake prolonged military action without Congressional authority. No president since has recognized the constitutionality of this act, and most legal scholars believe it would not survive a challenge in court.

To avoid initiating a crisis under the War Powers Resolution, the Bush administration sought explicit approval from the Congress to exercise force in Iraq. On October 9, 2002, the Congress passed the [[Iraq Resolution]] which explicitly authorized the President to use the Armed Forces of the United States as he determines to be necessary and appropriate. This raises the issue of whether or not Congress has the authority to delegate legislative power to the executive branch.  However, in a recent [[United States Supreme Court]] case, ''[[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]],'' the Supreme Court ruled that the [[military commissions]] that the President had established, (and defended by arguing that he was given the power to create military courts by this resolution), were unconstitutional because they were unauthorized by Congress.

The Constitution also provides that international treaties ratified by the United States are among the highest law of the land ([[US Constitution]], Article VI). The UN Charter is a treaty ratified by the US, which forbids member states, including the US, from attacking fellow member states, including Iraq, except in two carefully circumscribed situations (see [[UN Charter]]).

==Aftermath==
After the invasion of Iraq, the [[Iraq Survey Group]], headed by [[David Kay]] was formed to find the alleged weapons of mass destruction. Apart from a small quantity of degraded pre-1991 shells, nothing was found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hanley |first=Charles J. |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2005-09-02-WMD-indepth_x.htm |title=Piecing together the story of the weapons that weren't |publisher=Usatoday.Com |date=2005-09-06 |accessdate=2013-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''iron pipe scandal''' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]: ''järnrörsskandalen'') was a [[political scandal]] in [[Sweden]] involving individuals related to the [[Sweden Democrats]] ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]: ''Sverigedemokraterna'', SD). It occurred in 2010 but was only brought to mainstream public attention in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/sd-toppens-attack-skit-i-den-lilla-horan&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/almqvist-och-ekeroth-bevapnar-sig-med-jarnror/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/sa-forklarar-sd-topparna-att-de-bevapnade-sig-med-jarnror/&lt;/ref&gt;

==The events==
[[Erik Almqvist]], [[Kent Ekeroth]] and [[Christian Westling]], all high-ranking members of the Sweden Democrats (the first two were members of parliament when the incident was uncovered, Ekeroth as their candidate as Attorney General), had been involved in a verbal altercation with comedian [[Soran Ismail]]. Footage from the incident, captured by Ekeroth, shows that Erik Almqvist had told Ismail, who is of Kurdish descent, that he "acts like a wog", argues "like a little pussy" and that Sweden is "my country, not yours". He also called a woman "little whore" and a man "''[[wikt:blatte#Swedish|blatte]]'' lover". Ekeroth was also shown to shove a woman into the side of a car, and finally, the three politicians armed themselves with [[pipe (fluid conveyance)|iron pipes]] from a nearby construction site after receiving a threat from a witness.

==Reactions from the party==
Erik Almqvist initially denied any involvement in the scandal, but later confessed when the footage was released.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.svd.se/nyheter/inrikes/erik-almqvist-lamnar-riksdagen_7788940.svd&lt;/ref&gt; The Sweden Democrats and Erik Almqvist justified the trio's actions by stating that Ismail had insulted them in his comedy routine, and that the man who had threatened them had claimed to belong to a criminal organization.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article15773265.ab&lt;/ref&gt; Footage released later on proved that Almqvist hadn't at all believed the man's statement, and after talking to the police about the incident, casually remarked to the other two that "sucking up always helps".&lt;ref name="expressen.se"&gt;http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/sa-forklarar-sd-topparna-att-de-bevapnade-sig-med-jarnror/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sweden Democrats has also criticized [[Expressen]], who released the initial story, for [[cherry picking]] only certain parts of the footage.&lt;ref&gt;http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=1637&amp;artikel=5348477&lt;/ref&gt; Expressen responded by publishing the unedited footage, proving that the incident had indeed occurred as stated.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.expressen.se/tv/nyheter/inrikes/expressen-dokumentar-hela-sd-filmen/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
After the events were uncovered, Erik Almqvist resigned from all of his party duties except for his parliamentary seat on November 14, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=83&amp;artikel=5345592&lt;/ref&gt; On December 30, 2012, he resigned from his parliamentary seat and also rescinded his party membership.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.svd.se/nyheter/inrikes/almqvist-fran-riksdag-till-mediejobb_7788940.svd&lt;/ref&gt; He later relocated to [[Hungary]] and has continued to manage the Sweden Democrat paper ''Samtiden''.

Kent Ekeroth resigned from his assignment as spokesperson for justice policy on November 21, 2012 and took a two-month leave from his party duties. He has since filed copyright claims regarding the footage used and is highly active within the party again.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.journalisten.se/nyheter/ekeroth-kan-ha-ratt&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Jewel v. National Security Agency''''' is a [[United States]] [[class action lawsuit]] filed by the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF) against the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) and several high-ranking officials in the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|administration of 43rd U.S. president George W. Bush]],&lt;ref name=digjourn1&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/260075 | title = ''Jewel v.

== History ==
The case was filed on behalf of Carolyn Jewel and several other [[AT&amp;T]] customers on September 18, 2008, and is based on documentation provided by former AT&amp;T technician [[Mark Klein]].&lt;ref name=wired1&gt;{{ cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2009/07/jewel/ | title = Obama Claims Immunity, As New Spy Case Takes Center Stage |first=David |last=Kravets |date=July 15, 2009 | publisher = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |accessdate=December 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case was dismissed on January 21, 2010, by U.S. District Court Chief Judge [[Vaughn Walker]], who concluded that the plaintiffs lacked [[legal standing]] because their claims amounted to a "general grievance" against the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/01/nsa-spy-cases-tossed/ |title=Judge Tosses NSA Spy Cases |first=David |last=Kravets |authorlink= |date=January 22, 2010 |publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |accessdate=December 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On appeal, the [[Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] reinstated the case on December 29, 2011.&lt;ref name=talkleft1&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.talkleft.com/story/2011/12/29/175456/67 | title = 9th Circuit Allows Wiretap Suit Against NSA to Proceed | author = Jeralyn | authorlink = | date = December 29, 2011 | publisher = talkleft.com |accessdate=December 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; NSA [[whistleblower]] [[William Binney (U.S. intelligence official)|William Binney]] testified in July 2012 in support of the EFF that the NSA was "purposefully violating the Constitution".&lt;ref name="binney"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sworn Declaration of Whistleblower William Binney on NSA Domestic Surveillance Capabilities|publisher= Public Intelligence|date=July 16, 2012|url=https://publicintelligence.net/binney-nsa-declaration/}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 8, 2013, Judge [[Jeffrey White]] of the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California]] declined to dismiss the lawsuit under the [[state secrets privilege]].&lt;ref name=NoStateSecrets&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57592742-38/judge-lawsuit-alleging-illegal-nsa-spying-may-continue/ | title = Judge: Lawsuit alleging illegal NSA spying may continue | first = Declan | last = McCullagh | date = July 8, 2013 | publisher = [[CNET]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2013 the court ordered the government to explain the effects of [[2013 NSA leaks|intelligence leaks about the NSA's surveillance activities]], primarily by [[Edward Snowden]], on the [[national security]] impact of the case. The NSA reasserted the state secrets privilege on December 20, 2013, and declassified portions of its assertions of the state secrets privilege the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/22/us/white-house-tries-to-prevent-judge-from-ruling-on-surveillance-efforts.html|title=White House Tries to Prevent Judge From Ruling on Surveillance Efforts|newspaper=''[[The New York Times]]''|date=December 21, 2013|first1=Charlie|last1=Savage|first2=David.

On March 10, 2014, Judge White imposed a Temporary Restraining Order, requiring the NSA and other parties to halt the destruction of evidence until a final resolution of the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://images.politico.com/global/2014/03/10/jewelunitshorttroord.html|title=Order Granting Temporary Restraining Order|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 5, 2014, the EFF filed a motion for an emergency hearing requesting that the court enforce this Temporary Restraining Order after discovering that the Government had continued the destruction of evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://images.politico.com/global/2014/06/05/jewel702tro.pdf|title=Plaintiff's Emergency Request to Enforce the Court's Temporary Restraining Order|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A motion filed by the government claimed that doing so would have severe consequences "including the possible suspension of the Section 702 program and potential loss of access to lawfully collected signals intelligence information on foreign intelligence targets".&lt;ref name="eff.org"&gt;https://www.eff.org/files/2014/06/05/govtemergencymotion.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 10, 2015, Judge White dismissed a challenge by the plaintiffs of the constitutionality of the UPSTREAM data collection program. The court ruled that the challenge would require the "impermissible disclosure of state secret information",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/policy/technology/232385-court-upholds-nsa-snooping|title=Court upholds NSA snooping|newspaper=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|date=February 10, 2015|first=Julian|last=Hattern}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also ruled that the plaintiffs did not have standing to pursue their claims. The court did not rule on the constitutionality of the NSA's collection of Internet and phone content. Judge White also wrote that some of the EFF's factual allegations about the program were not correct, but did not identify any specific inaccuracies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.nationaljournal.com/tech/judge-dismisses-challenge-to-nsa-internet-surveillance-20150210 |title= Judge Dismisses Challenge to NSA Internet Surveillance |newspaper=''[[National Journal]]'' |date=February 10, 2015 |first=Dustin |last=Volz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Murray Last''' {{post-nominals|OC}} (born 1926) is an [[Emeritus Professor]] at the [[University of Ottawa]], is a preeminent Canadian [[public health]] scholar, prolific author, scientist and teacher whose reference texts are used by schools of public health as well as community medicine and [[epidemiology]] practitioners throughout the world.  He has also been an outspoken advocate for change, especially on the need for a stronger and more effective voice for public health, and the need for political action on [[climate change]].

== Education ==
Born in [[Australia]] in 1926, John Last obtained his [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery|MB BS]] in 1949 and his [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] (by thesis) in 1968, from the [[University of Adelaide]]. In the interim he undertook 5 years of hospital-based training, 5 years in general practice, and served as a [[ship's surgeon]]. In 1960 he obtained a [[Professional degrees of public health|DPH]] from the [[University of Sydney]], and was then appointed [[Visiting Fellow]], [[Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)|Medical Research Council]] Social Medicine Research Unit, [[London Hospital Medical College]], England (1961–62).  He earned specialty recognition in [[Australasia]] ([[Fellow of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians|FRACP]] 1973; FRACPHM 1990), the United States ([[American College of Preventive Medicine|FACPM]] 1980; [[American College of Epidemiology|FACE]] 1981), the United Kingdom ([[Faculty of Public Health|FFCM]] 1982), and Canada ([[FRCPC]] 1987).

== Career ==
Last has made substantive contributions to public health higher education, especially in the public health reference literature, including the dissemination of methods for public health research, and to clarifying related ethical issues. He has held academic posts at the [[University of Sydney]], the [[University of Vermont]], and the [[University of Edinburgh]], and has been professor of [[epidemiology]] and community medicine at the University of Ottawa since 1969.

Last’s initial research emphasis was on primary medical care, as reflected in work conducted mainly during the 1960s; this substantial body of work (approximately 30 published papers over the decade, selections cited here) includes observations on the health of immigrants,&lt;ref&gt;Last JM: The health of immigrants; observations from general practice. Med J Aust, 1960, 1:159-163.&lt;/ref&gt; maternal and child health,&lt;ref&gt;Last JM: Maternal and child health; the role of the general practitioner.

N Engl J Med, 1965,272:293-297.&lt;/ref&gt; He published also on issues of measurement,&lt;ref&gt;Last JM: Measurement of medical care in general practice. Med J Aust, 1965, 1:280-283.&lt;/ref&gt; record keeping,&lt;ref&gt;Last JM: Primary medical care, 1; record-keeping.

Perhaps his most enduring contribution to the health care research literature of the 1960s was a description of the "iceberg": a common phenomenon in the [[natural history of disease]] where only a relatively small proportion of cases of a given disease, "the tip of the iceberg", comes to the attention of the health care system. The "submerged part" goes undiagnosed and unreported. The proportion of missed cases varies with the disease and its severity.&lt;ref&gt;Last JM. The Iceberg: completing the clinical picture in general practice. Lancet. 1963;2:28–31.&lt;/ref&gt; This contribution (including a table on clinical and subclinical disease) was incorporated (and duly referenced) by [[Jerry Morris]], a long-standing colleague of Last, in his textbook on Uses of Epidemiology.&lt;ref&gt;Reference 54 in: Chapter V Completing the Clinical Picture. In: Morris JN. Uses of Epidemiology. 2nd Edition. Edinburgh: Livingstone, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

His main scholarly interests today are the interactions of [[ecosystem health]] with human health: he has served in related advisory capacities, including as a reviewer (1998–99) for the Health Sector Working Group of the [[United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]].

== Philosophical Reflections ==
In a 2014 interview, in his 88th year, John Last was asked: ''"What are some key lessons you’ve learned over your career?"''  In reply, this is what he said:&lt;ref&gt;Graham R. Lessons learned and public health’s political role:
An interview with John Last. Canadian Journal of Public Health 2014; 105, 6: 460-461&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"I’ve been in public health for over 50 years, and I’ve learned a lot. And I’m still a student. I learn something new every day. I think of myself as a perpetual learner. I believe it’s helped to keep me youthful: I am an old man in years of life lived, but I’ve preserved my youthful enthusiasm for learning, and that has kept me young in spirit. In terms of key lessons, avoid getting locked into rigid positions. Tolerate ambiguity. Conditions are changing and they’re going to go on changing. It’s absolutely essential to keep an open mind, keep your options open, and of course, keep your skills up-to-date. And be prepared to defend controversial issues. Remain flexible, so you can adapt to changing conditions. A species that over-specializes to cope with a particular set of conditions is in danger of extinction when conditions change. Over-specialized professional people likewise risk extinction (i.e., becoming redundant) when conditions change. That’s why it’s essential to remain flexible and adaptable."''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later in the same interview, he stated: &lt;blockquote&gt;''"...our duty as public health officials is to assemble, assess and evaluate the evidence on public health problems affecting the population we serve. We must show leadership in presenting this evidence to elected officials to whom we are answerable, and must be prepared also to communicate this evidence to the general public, along with actions needed to control the public health problems that we identify. We must be prepared to defend our decisions, which are sometimes opposed by eloquent representatives of powerful vested interest groups. To be effective in this role, we need political savvy – sometimes the most important of the skills we possess."''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Honours and awards==
John Last's honors include an [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorate]] from the Faculty of Medicine at [[Uppsala University]], [[Sweden]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uu.se/en/about-uu/traditions/prizes/honorary-doctorates/&lt;/ref&gt; 1993, and MD Honoris Causa of Edinburgh University, 2003. He was [[Wade Hampton Frost]] lecturer, [[American Public Health Association]], 1989; Scholar in Residence, [[Rockefeller Foundation]]'s Villa Serbelloni Study and Conference Center, Bellagio, 1992.  In recognition of lifetime achievements, he received the Duncan Clark Award of the Association of Teachers of Preventive Medicine in 1994, the Abraham Lilienfeld Award of the [[American College of Epidemiology]] in 1997, the Defries Award, highest honour of the Canadian Public Health Association in 2006, and the [[Sedgwick Memorial Medal]] of the American Public Health Association in 2008. He is an honorary life member of the International Epidemiological Association, the American College of Epidemiology, the American Public Health Association, the UK [[Society for Social Medicine]], the [[Royal Australasian College of Physicians]] and the [[British Medical Association]].

In 2012 John Last was admitted as an [[Officer of the Order of Canada]] in recognition of his service to public health sciences.

'''Karnataka Janata Paksha''' ('''KJP''') was a political party based in [[Karnataka]] state. It was founded in 2012 and disestablished in 2014, merging with the [[Bharatiya Janta Party]]. It was headed by its founder [[Padmanabha Prasanna Kumar]] and leader was [[Chief Minister of Karnataka|Karnataka Chief minister]] [[B. S. Yeddyurappa]]. 

Although registered by [[Padmanabha Prasanna]] KJP was formally launched by Padmanabha in late 2008. Yeddyurappa had resigned as a [[Member of Legislative Assembly]] and from the primary membership of the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) on 30 November 2012. The party was formally launched in a convention at [[Haveri]] on 9 December 2012, wherein thousands of people participated.

Scores of former and sitting legislators, ministers and senior functionaries of the [[BJP]] joined the party along with Yeddyurappa.

In the [[Karnataka Legislative Assembly election, 2013| 2013 Karnataka Legislative Assembly Elections]], the party under the leadership of Yeddyurappa won 8 of the 203 seats it had contested and secured about 10 % of the total votes polled. Although, the party did not make any significant gains in the elections, it had restricted the BJP to just 40 seats, compared to the 121 it had in the outgoing assembly.&lt;ref name=ShettarresignCNN-IBN&gt;{{cite news|title=Karnataka: Jagadish Shettar resigns as Chief Minister|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/karnataka-jagadish-shettar-resigns-as-chief-minister/390466-37-170.html|newspaper=[[CNN-IBN]]|date=8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013, Yeddyurappa announced that the party would support the BJP-led [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|National Democratic Alliance]] to ensure the victory of [[Narendra Modi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/report/no-merger-with-bjp-but-will-back-nda-under-modi-bsy/20130919.htm |title=No merger with BJP but will back NDA under Modi: BSY – Rediff.com India News |publisher=Rediff.com |date=2013-09-19 |accessdate=2014-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the party had a schism between Padmanabha and Yeddyarupa, with the latter opting to merge with the BJP, and the party being eventually disestablished.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2014-01-01/news/45764663_1_bs-yeddyurappa-ks-eshwarappa-karnataka-janatha-paksha&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.ndtv.com/article/india/bjp-welcomes-karnataka-strongman-bs-yeddyurappa-and-his-party-back-into-its-fold-466291 |title=BJP welcomes Karnataka strongman BS Yeddyurappa and his party back into its fold |publisher=M.ndtv.com |date=2014-01-02 |accessdate=2014-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kapikad|first1=Sathish|title=KJP will not merge with BJP at any cost: Padmanabha Prasanna Kumar|url=https://www.kannadigaworld.com/news/karavali/68689.html|date=12 Feb 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Land reform in Zimbabwe''' officially began in 1980 with the signing of the [[Lancaster House Agreement]], as an effort to more equitably distribute land between black [[subsistence farmer]]s and [[White people in Zimbabwe|white Zimbabweans of European ancestry]], who had traditionally enjoyed [[Dominant minority|superior political and economic status]]. The programme's targets were intended to alter the ethnic balance of land ownership.&lt;ref&gt;SADC newsletter: [http://www.sarpn.org.za/documents/d0000015/index.php Eddie Cross interview, see Q2]&lt;/ref&gt; Inequalities in land ownership were inflated by a growing overpopulation problem, [[Land degradation|depletion of over-utilised tracts]], and escalating poverty in subsistence areas parallel with the under-utilisation of land on commercial farms.&lt;ref name="Cry"&gt;{{cite book|title=Cry Zimbabwe: Independence – Twenty Years On|last=Stiff|first=Peter|location=Johannesburg|publisher=Galago Publishing|date=June 2000|isbn=978-1919854021|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the predominantly white commercial sector also provided a livelihood for over 30% of the paid workforce and accounted for some 40% of exports.&lt;ref name="zimstudy"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nelson|first=Harold|title=Zimbabwe: A Country Study|pages=137–153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its principal crops included [[sugarcane]], [[coffee]], [[cotton]], [[tobacco]] and several varieties of high-yield hybrid [[maize]]. Both the commercial farms and the subsistence sector maintained large cattle herds, but over 60% of domestic beef was furnished by the former.&lt;ref name="zimstudy"/&gt; In sharp contrast, the life of typical subsistence farmers was difficult, and their labour poorly rewarded. As [[erosion]] increased, the ability of the subsistence sector to feed its adherents diminished to an alarming degree.&lt;ref name="Cry"/&gt;

Land hunger was at the centre of the [[Rhodesian Bush War]], and was addressed at Lancaster House, which sought to concede equitable redistribution to the landless without damaging the white farmers' vital contribution to Zimbabwe's economy.&lt;ref name="Security"&gt;{{cite book|title=Mugabe and the Politics of Security in Zimbabwe|last=Alao|first=Abiodun|year=2012|location=Montreal, Quebec and Kingston, Ontario|publisher=[[McGill-Queen's University Press]]|isbn=978-0-7735-4044-6|pages=91–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; At independence from the [[United Kingdom]] in 1980, the Zimbabwean authorities were empowered to initiate the necessary reforms; as long as land was bought and sold on a willing basis, the British government would finance half the cost.&lt;ref name="Security"/&gt; In the late 1990s, Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] terminated this arrangement when funds available from [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s administration were exhausted, repudiating all commitments to land reform. Zimbabwe responded by embarking on a "fast track" redistribution campaign, forcibly confiscating white farms without compensation.&lt;ref name="Security"/&gt;

The government's land distribution is perhaps the most crucial and most bitterly contested political issue surrounding Zimbabwe. It has been criticised for the violence and intimidation which marred several expropriations, as well as the parallel collapse of domestic banks which held billions of dollars' worth of bonds on liquidated properties.&lt;ref name="Cry"/&gt; The [[United Nations]] has identified several key shortcomings with the contemporary programme, namely failure to compensate ousted landowners as called for by the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC), the poor handling of boundary disputes, and chronic shortages of material and personnel needed to carry out resettlement in an orderly manner.&lt;ref name="UN"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150114214750/http://www.undg.org/docs/12123/Zimbabwe-Country-Analysis-2010-Report_05-09-11.pdf Zimbabwe Country Analysis]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2011, 237,858 Zimbabwean households had been provided with access to land under the programme. A total of 10,816,886 hectares had been acquired since 2000, compared to the 3,498,444 purchased from voluntary sellers between 1980 and 1998.&lt;ref name="UN"/&gt; By 2013, every white-owned farm in Zimbabwe had been either expropriated or confirmed for future redistribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm?year=2013&amp;dlid=220176| title = Country Reports on Human Rights Practices  - 2013| publisher = [[U.S. Department of State]]| accessdate = 2014-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The compulsory acquisition of farmland without compensation was discontinued in early 2018.&lt;ref name="Cost"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mugabe's land reform costs Zimbabwe $17 billion: economists|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|url=https://www.news24.com/Africa/Zimbabwe/mugabes-land-reform-costs-zimbabwe-17-billion-economists-20180512|work=News 24|location=Cape Town|date=12 May 2018|accessdate=14 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The foundation for the controversial land dispute in Zimbabwean society was laid at the beginning of European settlement of the region, which had long been the scene of [[Bantu expansion|mass movements]] by various [[Bantu peoples]]. In the sixteenth century, [[Portugal|Portuguese]] explorers had attempted to open up Zimbabwe for trading purposes, but the country was not permanently settled by European immigrants until three hundred years later.&lt;ref name="Nelson2"&gt;{{cite book | first = Harold | last = Nelson| authorlink = | title = Area Handbook for Southern Rhodesia|edition= 1975|pages= 3–16 | publisher = American University| asin= B002V93K7S}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first great Zimbabwean kingdom was the [[Rozwi Empire]], established in the eleventh century. Two hundred years later, Rozwi imperial rule began to crumble and the empire fell to the [[Karanga peoples]], a relatively new tribe to the region which originated north of the [[Zambezi River]].&lt;ref name="Nelson2"/&gt; Both these peoples later came to form the nucleus of the [[Shona people|Shona civilisation]], along with the Zezuru in central Zimbabwe, the Korekore in the north, the Manyika in the east, the Ndau in the southeast, and the Kalanga in the southwest.&lt;ref name="Nelson2"/&gt;

Most Shona cultures had a theoretically communal attitude towards land ownership; the later European concept of officiating individual property ownership was unheard of.&lt;ref name=Shoko&gt;{{cite book|last=Shoko|first=Thabona|title=Karanga Indigenous Religion in Zimbabwe: Health and Well-Being|date=2007|pages=9–12|publisher=Routledge Books|location=Oxforshire|isbn=978-0754658818}}&lt;/ref&gt; Land was considered the collective property of all the residents in a given chiefdom, with the chief mediating disagreements and issues pertaining to its use.&lt;ref name=Shoko/&gt; Nevertheless, male household heads frequently reserved personal tracts for their own cultivation, and allocated smaller tracts to each of their wives. Population growth frequently resulted in the over-utilisation of the existing land, which became greatly diminished both in terms of cultivation and grazing due to the larger number of people attempting to share the same acreage.&lt;ref name=Shoko/&gt;

During the early nineteenth century, the Shona were conquered by the [[Northern Ndebele people|Northern Ndebele]] (also known as the ''Matabele''), which began the process of commodifying Zimbabwe's land.&lt;ref name="Nelson2"/&gt; Although the Ndebele elite were uninterested in cultivation, land ownership was considered one major source of an individual's wealth and power&amp;mdash;the others being cattle and slaves. Ndebele monarchs acquired large swaths of land for themselves accordingly.&lt;ref name="Nelson2"/&gt;

===Legal situation in Southern Rhodesia===

====European settlement patterns====
[[File:BSAC settlers Southern Rhodesia.jpg|thumb|300px|White farmers in [[Southern Rhodesia]], early 1920s.]]
The first white farmers began to immigrate from [[South Africa]] and the [[United Kingdom]] during the late nineteenth century, less than a hundred years after the Ndebele invasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/country_profiles/1831470.stm |title=Zimbabwe profile – Timeline |publisher=BBC News |date=31 May 2012 |accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reflected a larger trend of permanent European settlement in the milder, drier regions of [[Southern Africa]] as opposed to the tropical and sub-tropical climates further north.&lt;ref name=Borstelmann&gt;{{cite book|last=Borstelmann|first=Thomas|title=Apartheid's reluctant uncle: The United States and Southern Africa in the early Cold War |date=1993|pages=11–28|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0195079425}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1889 [[Cecil Rhodes]] and the [[British South Africa Company]] (BSAC) introduced the earliest white settlers to Zimbabwe as prospectors, seeking concessions from the Ndebele for mineral rights.&lt;ref name="Nelson2"/&gt; Collectively known as the ''[[Pioneer Column]]'', the settlers established the city of Salisbury, now [[Harare]].&lt;ref name="Nelson2"/&gt; Rhodes hoped to discover gold and establish a mining colony, but the original intention had to be modified as neither the costs nor the returns on the overhead capital matched the original projections.&lt;ref name=Mosley&gt;{{cite book|last=Mosley|first=Paul|title=The Settler Economies: Studies in the Economic History of Kenya and Southern Rhodesia 1900-1963 |date=2009|pages=13–24|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0521102452}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local gold deposits failed to yield the massive returns which the BSAC had promised its investors, and the military costs of the expedition had caused a deficit.&lt;ref name=Mosley/&gt; An interim solution was the granting of land to the settlers in the hopes that they would develop productive farms and generate enough income to justify the colony's continued administrative costs.&lt;ref name=Mosley/&gt; The region was demarcated as ''[[Southern Rhodesia]]'' after 1898.&lt;ref name="palley742743"&gt;
*{{cite book|title=The Constitutional History and Law of Southern Rhodesia 1888–1965, with Special Reference to Imperial Control|last=Palley|first=Claire|year=1966|edition=First|location=Oxford|publisher=[[Oxford University Press|Clarendon Press]]|oclc=406157|pages=742–743}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1890 and 1896, the BSAC granted an area encompassing 16 million acres&amp;mdash;about one sixth the area of Southern Rhodesia&amp;mdash;to European immigrants.&lt;ref name=Mosley/&gt; By 1913 this had been extended to 21.5 million acres. However, these concessions were strictly regulated, and land was only offered to those individuals able to prove they had the necessary capital to develop it.&lt;ref name=Mosley/&gt; Exceptions were made during the Ndebele and Shona insurrections against the BSAC in the mid-1890s, when land was promised to any European men willing to take up arms in defence of the colony, irrespective of their financial status.&lt;ref name=Njoh&gt;{{cite book|last=Njoh|first=Ambeh|title=Planning Power: Town Planning and Social Control in Colonial Africa |date=2007|pages=159–160|publisher=UCL Press|location=London|isbn=978-1844721603}}&lt;/ref&gt; The settlers of the Pioneer Column were granted tracts of 3,150 acres apiece, with an option to purchase more land from the BSAC's holdings at relatively low prices (up to fifteen times cheaper than comparable land on the market in South Africa).&lt;ref name=Mosley/&gt;

====Creation of the Tribal Trust Lands====

Friction soon arose between the settlers and the Ndebele and Shona peoples, both in terms of land apportionment and economic competition.&lt;ref name=Mosley/&gt; In 1900, Southern Rhodesia's black population owned an estimated 55,000 head of cattle, while European residents owned fewer than 12,000. Most of the pastureland was being grazed by African-owned cattle, accordingly.&lt;ref name="zimstudy"/&gt; However, in less than two decades the Ndebele and Shona came to own over a million head of cattle, with white farmers owning another million as well.&lt;ref name="zimstudy"/&gt; As the amount of available pasture for the livestock quickly dwindled, accompanied by massive amounts of overgrazing and erosion, land competition between the three groups became intense.&lt;ref name="zimstudy"/&gt; A number of successive land commissions were thus appointed to study the problem and apportion the land.&lt;ref name="zimstudy"/&gt;

The colonial government in Southern Rhodesia delineated the country into five distinct farming regions which corresponded roughly to rainfall patterns.&lt;ref name="zimstudy"/&gt; Region I comprised an area in the eastern highlands with markedly higher rainfall best suited to the cultivation of diversified cash crops such as coffee and tea. Region II was [[highveld]], also in the east, where the land could be used intensively for grain cultivation such as maize, tobacco, and wheat. Region III and Region IV endured periodic drought and were regarded as suitable for livestock, in addition to crops which required little rainfall. Region V was [[lowveld]] and unsuitable for crop cultivation due to its dry nature; however, limited livestock farming was still viable.&lt;ref name="Women"&gt;{{cite paper|title=Single women, land, and livelihood vulnerability in a communal area in Zimbabwe |last=Makura-Paradza |first=Gaynor Gamuchirai |url=http://edepot.wur.nl/139210? |location=Wageningen |publisher=Wageningen University and Research Centre |year=2010 |accessdate=27 September 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321010929/http://edepot.wur.nl/139210 |archivedate=21 March 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Land ownership in these regions was determined by race under the terms of the Southern Rhodesian Land Apportionment Act, passed in 1930, which reserved Regions I, II, and III for white settlement.&lt;ref name="Women"/&gt; Region V and a segment of Region II which possessed greater rainfall variability were organised into the Tribal Trust Lands (TTLs), reserved solely for black African ownership and use.&lt;ref name="zimstudy"/&gt; This created two new problems: firstly, in the areas reserved for whites, the ratio of land to population was so high that many farms could not be exploited to their fullest potential, and some prime white-owned farmland was lying idle.&lt;ref name=Mosley/&gt; Secondly, the legislation resulted in enforced overuse of the land in the TTLs due to overpopulation there.&lt;ref name="zimstudy"/&gt;
[[Image:Rhodesialand.png|right|thumbnail|300px|Land apportionment in Rhodesia in 1965.]]
The Southern Rhodesian Land Apportionment Act reserved 49 million acres for white ownership and left 17.7 million acres of land unassigned to either the white preserve or the TTLs.&lt;ref name=Mosley/&gt; While a survey undertaken by the colony's Land Commission in concert with the British government in 1925 found that the vast majority of black Rhodesians supported some form of geographic segregation, including the reservation of land exclusively for their use, many were disillusioned by the manner in which the legislation was implemented in explicit favour of whites.&lt;ref name=Mosley/&gt; The overcrowded conditions in the TTLs compelled large numbers of Shona and Ndebele alike to abandon their rural livelihoods and seek wage employment in the cities or on white commercial farms.&lt;ref name="Women"/&gt; Those who remained on tracts in the TTLs found themselves having to cope with topsoil depletion due to overuse; large amounts of topsoil were stripped of their vegetation cover and rendered unproductive as a consequence.&lt;ref name="zimstudy"/&gt; To control the rate of erosion, colonial authorities introduced voluntary destocking initiatives for livestock. When these met with little success, the destocking programme became mandatory in 1941, forcing all residents of the TTLs to sell or slaughter animals declared surplus.&lt;ref name="zimstudy"/&gt; Another 7.2 million acres were also set aside for sale to black farmers, known as the Native Purchase Areas.&lt;ref name=Mosley/&gt;

During the early 1950s, Southern Rhodesia passed the African Land Husbandry Act, which attempted to reform the communal system in the TTLs by giving black Africans the right to apply for formal title deeds to specific tracts.&lt;ref name="zimstudy"/&gt; This legislation proved so unpopular and difficult to enforce that incoming Rhodesian Prime Minister [[Ian Smith]] ordered its suspension in the mid 1960s. Smith's administration subsequently recognised the traditional leaders of each chiefdom as the final authority on land allocation in the TTLs.&lt;ref name="zimstudy"/&gt;

Following [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence]], land legislation was again amended with the Rhodesian Land Tenure Act of 1969. The Land Tenure Act upended the Land Apportionment Act of 1930 and was designed to rectify the issue of insufficient land available to the rapidly expanding black population.&lt;ref name="zimstudy"/&gt; It reduced the amount of land reserved for white ownership to 45 million acres and reserved another 45 million acres for black ownership, introducing parity in theory; however, the most fertile farmland in Regions I, II, and III continued to be included in the white enclave.&lt;ref name="zimstudy"/&gt; Abuses of the system continued to abound; some white farmers took advantage of the legislation to shift their property boundaries into land formerly designated for black settlement, often without notifying the other landowners.&lt;ref name=Maxey&gt;{{cite book|last=Maxey|first=Kees|title=Fight for Zimbabwe: Armed Conflict in Southern Rhodesia Since UDI|date=1975|pages=102–108|publisher=[[Rex Collings Ltd]]|location=London|isbn=978-0901720818}}&lt;/ref&gt; A related phenomenon was the existence of black communities, especially those congregated around missions, which were oblivious to the legislation and unwittingly squatting on land redesignated for white ownership. The land would be sold in the meantime, and the government obliged to evict the preexisting occupants.&lt;ref name="Raeburn"&gt;{{cite book|title=Black Fire! Narratives of Rhodesian Guerrillas|last=Raeburn|first=Michael |location=New York|publisher=Random House|year=1978|isbn=978-0394505305|pages=189–207}}&lt;/ref&gt; These incidents and others were instrumental in eliciting sympathy among Rhodesia's black population for nationalist movements such as the [[Zimbabwe African National Union]] (ZANU) and the [[Zimbabwe African People's Union]] (ZAPU), which sought to overthrow the Rhodesian government by force of arms.&lt;ref name="Raeburn"/&gt;

The escalation of the [[Rhodesian Bush War]] in the 1970s led to a significant amount of rural displacement and interrupted agricultural activity.&lt;ref name="Women"/&gt; The disruption of veterinary services resulted in massive livestock losses, and the cultivation of cash crops was hampered by guerrilla raids.&lt;ref name="Raeburn"/&gt; The murder of about three hundred white farmers during the war, as well as the conscription of hundreds of others into the [[Rhodesian Security Forces]], also led to a drop in the volume of agricultural production.&lt;ref name="QEH1"&gt;{{cite journal|title=From Open Season to Royal Game: The Strategic Repositioning of Commercial Farmers Across The Independence Transition in Zimbabwe|last=Selby|first=Andy|url=http://www3.qeh.ox.ac.uk/pdf/qehwp/qehwps141.pdf|location=Oxford|publisher=Centre for International Development|year=n.d.|accessdate=4 July 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307053241/http://www3.qeh.ox.ac.uk/pdf/qehwp/qehwps141.pdf|archivedate=7 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1975 and 1976 Rhodesia's urban population doubled as thousands of rural dwellers, mostly from TTLs, fled to the cities to escape the fighting.&lt;ref name="Women"/&gt; A campaign of systematic [[Villagization|villagisation]] followed as the Rhodesian Army shifted segments of the black population into guarded settlements to prevent their subversion by the insurgents.&lt;ref name="Raeburn"/&gt;

In 1977, the Land Tenure Act was amended by the Rhodesian parliament, which further reduced the amount of land reserved for white ownership to 200,000 hectares, or 500,000 acres. Over 15 million hectares were thus opened to purchase by persons of any race.&lt;ref name="zimstudy"/&gt; Two years later, as part of the [[Internal Settlement]], [[Zimbabwe Rhodesia]]'s incoming biracial government under Bishop [[Abel Muzorewa]] abolished the reservation of land according to race.&lt;ref name="zimstudy"/&gt; White farmers continued to own 73.8% of the most fertile land suited for intensive cash crop cultivation and livestock grazing, in addition to generating 80% of the country's total agricultural output.&lt;ref name="zimstudy"/&gt; This was a vital contribution to the economy, which was still underpinned by its agricultural exports.&lt;ref name="Women"/&gt;

Land reform emerged as a critical issue during the [[Lancaster House Agreement|Lancaster House Talks]] to end the Rhodesian Bush War. ZANU leader [[Robert Mugabe]] and ZAPU leader [[Joshua Nkomo]] insisted on the redistribution of land&amp;mdash;by compulsory seizure, without compensation&amp;mdash;as a precondition to a negotiated peace settlement.&lt;ref name=Kriger&gt;{{cite book|last=Kriger|first=Norma|title= Guerrilla Veterans in Post-War Zimbabwe: Symbolic and Violent Politics, 1980-1987|date=2003|pages=41–42|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0521818230}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was reflective of prevailing attitudes in their guerrilla armies, the [[Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army]] (ZANLA) and [[Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army]] (ZIPRA) respectively, and rural support bases, which had high expectations of the redistribution of land.&lt;ref name="Security"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Women"/&gt; The British government, which mediated the talks, proposed a constitutional clause underscoring property ownership as an inalienable right to prevent a mass exodus of white farmers and the economic collapse of the country.&lt;ref name="QEH1"/&gt; This was enshrined in Section 16 of the [[Constitution of Zimbabwe|Zimbabwean Constitution, 1980]].&lt;ref name=Kriger/&gt; To secure Mugabe and Nkomo's support for the constitutional agreement, [[Lord Carrington]] announced that the United Kingdom would be prepared to assist land resettlement with technical assistance and financial aid.&lt;ref name=Kriger/&gt; The Secretary-General of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], [[Shridath Ramphal|Sir Shridath Ramphal]], also received assurances from the American ambassador in London, [[Kingman Brewster]], that the United States would likewise contribute capital for "a substantial amount for a process of land redistribution and they would undertake to encourage the British government to give similar assurances".&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news|last=Plaut |first=Martin |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6958418.stm |title=Africa &amp;#124; US backed Zimbabwe land reform |publisher=BBC News |date=22 August 2007 |accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lancaster House Agreement stipulated that farms could only be taken from whites on a "willing buyer, willing seller" principle for at least ten years.&lt;ref name="Security"/&gt; White farmers were not to be placed under any pressure or intimidation, and if they decided to sell their farms they were allowed to determine their own asking prices.&lt;ref name="Security"/&gt; Exceptions could be made if the farm was unoccupied and not being used for agricultural activity.&lt;ref name=Kriger/&gt;

Southern Rhodesia's independence was finally recognised as the Republic of Zimbabwe on April 18, 1980. As Zimbabwe's first prime minister, Mugabe reaffirmed his commitment to land reform.&lt;ref name="zimstudy"/&gt; The newly created Zimbabwean [[Ministry of Lands and Land Resettlement (Zimbabwe)|Ministry of Lands, Resettlement, and Redevelopment]] announced later that year that land reform would be necessary to alleviate overpopulation in the former TTLs, extend the production potential of small-scale subsistence farmers, and improve the standards of living of rural blacks.&lt;ref name="Women"/&gt; Its stated goals were to ensure abandoned or under-utilised land was being exploited to its fullest potential, and provide opportunities for unemployed, landless peasants.&lt;ref name="Women"/&gt;

==Phases of land reform==

===Willing Seller, Willing Buyer===
Despite extensive financial assistance from the UK, the first phase of Zimbabwe's land reform programme was widely regarded as unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="Women"/&gt; Zimbabwe was only able to acquire 3 million hectares (7.41 million acres) for black resettlement, well short of its intended target of 8 million hectares (19.77 million acres).&lt;ref name=pbs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/africa/land/gp_zimbabwe.html |title=Online NewsHour – Land Redistribution in Southern Africa: Zimbabwe Program |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=18 May 2016 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040501103309/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/africa/land/gp_zimbabwe.html |archivedate=1 May 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This land was redistributed to about 50,000 households.&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt; Many former supporters of the nationalist movements felt that the promises of Nkomo and Mugabe with regards to the land had not been truly fulfilled. This sentiment was especially acute in [[Matabeleland]], where the legacy of the Southern Rhodesian Land Apportionment Act was more disadvantageous to black Zimbabweans than other parts of the country.&lt;ref name="Dzimba"&gt;{{cite book|title=South Africa's Destabilization of Zimbabwe, 1980-89|last=Dzimba|first=John|year=1998|location=Basingstoke|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|isbn=978-0333713693|pages=72–135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Funds earmarked for the purchase of white farms were frequently diverted into defence expenditure throughout the mid 1980s, for which Zimbabwean officials received some criticism.&lt;ref name="Dzimba"/&gt; Reduction of funding posed another dilemma: property prices were now beyond what the Ministry of Lands, Resettlement, and Redevelopment could afford to meet its goals.&lt;ref name="Laakso"&gt;{{cite book | title = Twenty Years of Independence in Zimbabwe: From Liberation to Authoritarianism | last = Laakso | first = Liisa | editor1-last = Darnolf | editor1-first = Staffan | editor2-last = Laakso | editor2-first = Liisa|date=1997|pages=3–9|publisher=Palgrave-Macmillan|location=Basingstoke|isbn=978-0333804537}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also unable to build sufficient roads, clinics, and schools for the large number of people it was resettling in new areas.&lt;ref name="Laakso"/&gt; After 1983, the domestic budget could no longer sustain resettlement measures, and despite British aid the number of farms being purchased gradually declined for the remainder of the decade.&lt;ref name="Fisher"&gt;{{cite book|title=Pioneers, settlers, aliens, exiles: the decolonisation of white identity in Zimbabwe|last=Fisher|first=J L|publisher=[[Australian National University|ANU E Press]]|location=Canberra|year=2010|isbn=978-1-921666-14-8|pages=159–165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, the government of Zimbabwe cited financial restraints and an ongoing drought as the two overriding factors influencing the slow progress of land reform.&lt;ref name=Drinkwater&gt;{{cite book|last=Drinkwater|first=Michael|title=The State and Agrarian Change in Zimbabwe's Communal Areas|date=1991|pages=84–87|publisher=Palgrave-Macmillan|location=Basingstoke|isbn=978-0312053505}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was also clear that within the Ministry of Lands, Resettlement, and Redevelopment itself there was a lack of initiative and trained personnel to plan and implement mass resettlements.&lt;ref name=Drinkwater/&gt; Parliament passed the Land Acquisition Act in 1985, which gave the government first right to purchase excess land for redistribution to the landless. It empowered the government to claim tracts adjacent to the former TTLs (now known simply as "Communal Areas") and mark them for resettlement purposes, provided the owners could be persuaded to sell.&lt;ref name=Drinkwater/&gt;

Between April 1980 and September 1987, the acreage of land occupied by white-owned commercial farms was reduced by about 20%.&lt;ref name=Drinkwater/&gt;

===Compulsory acquisition===

After the expiration of the entrenched constitutional conditions mandated by the Lancaster House Agreement in the early 1990s, Zimbabwe outlined several ambitious new plans for land reform.&lt;ref name="Fisher"/&gt; A National Land Policy was formally proposed and enshrined as the Zimbabwean Land Acquisition Act of 1992, which empowered the government to acquire any land as it saw fit, although only after payment of financial compensation.&lt;ref name="Fisher"/&gt; While powerless to challenge the acquisition itself, landowners were permitted some lateral to negotiate their compensation amounts with the state.&lt;ref name="Security"/&gt; The British government continued to help fund the resettlement programme, with aid specifically earmarked for land reform reaching £91 million by 1996.&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt; Another £100 million was granted for "budgetary support" and was spent on a variety of projects, including land reform.&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt; Zimbabwe also began to court other donors through its Economic Structural Adjustment Policies (ESAP), which were projects implemented in concert with international agencies and tied to foreign loans.&lt;ref name="Women"/&gt;

The diversion of farms for personal use by Zimbabwe's political elite began to emerge as a crucial issue during the mid 1990s.&lt;ref name="Fisher"/&gt; Prime Minister Mugabe, who assumed an executive presidency in 1987, had urged restraint by enforcing a leadership code of conduct which barred members of the ruling party, [[Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front|ZANU-PF]], from monopolising large tracts of farmland and then renting them out for profit.&lt;ref name="Dowden"&gt;{{cite book | author = Dowden, Richard | title = Africa: Altered States, Ordinary Miracles|year= 2010|pages= 144–151 | publisher = Portobello Books| location = London| isbn= 978-1-58648-753-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local media outlets soon exposed huge breaches of the code by Mugabe's family and senior officials in ZANU-PF.&lt;ref name="Dowden"/&gt; Despite calls for accountability, the party members were never disciplined.&lt;ref name="Dowden"/&gt; Instead of being resettled by landless peasants, several hundred commercial farms acquired under the Land Acquisition Act continued to be leased out by politically connected individuals.&lt;ref name="Fisher"/&gt; In 1994, a disproportionate amount of the land being acquired was held by fewer than 600 black landowners, many of whom owned multiple properties.&lt;ref name="Fisher"/&gt; One study of commercial farms found that over half the redistributed land that year went to absentee owners otherwise unengaged in agriculture.&lt;ref name="Fisher"/&gt;

The perceived monopolisation of land by the ruling party provoked intense opposition from the ESAP donor states, which argued that those outside the patronage of ZANU-PF were unlikely to benefit.&lt;ref name="QEH2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Selby|first=Andy|date=|year=n.d.|title=Radical Realignments: The Collapse of the Alliance between White Farmers and the State in Zimbabwe|url=http://www3.qeh.ox.ac.uk/pdf/qehwp/qehwps144.pdf|journal=|location=Oxford|publisher=Centre for International Development|volume=|pages=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170708185433/http://www3.qeh.ox.ac.uk/pdf/qehwp/qehwps144.pdf|archivedate=8 July 2017|accessdate=8 July 2017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, party interests became even more inseparable from the issue of land reform when President Mugabe gave ZANU-PF's central committee overriding powers&amp;mdash; superseding those of the Zimbabwean courts as well as the Ministry of Lands and Agriculture&amp;mdash;to delegate on property rights.&lt;ref name="QEH2"/&gt; That year all farms marked for redistribution were no longer chosen or discussed by government ministries, but at ZANU-PF's annual congress.&lt;ref name="QEH2"/&gt;

In 1997 the government published a list of 1,471 farms it intended to buy compulsorily for redistribution.&lt;ref name="QEH2"/&gt; The list was compiled via a nationwide land identification exercise undertaken throughout the year. Landowners were given thirty days to submit written objections.&lt;ref name="QEH2"/&gt; Many farms were delisted and then re-listed as the Ministry of Lands and Agriculture debated the merits of acquiring various properties,&lt;ref name="Fisher"/&gt; especially those which ZANU-PF had ordered be expropriated for unspecified "political reasons".&lt;ref name="QEH2"/&gt; Of the 1,471 individual property acquisitions, about 1,200 were appealed to the courts by the farmowners due to various legal irregularities.&lt;ref name="QEH2"/&gt; President Mugabe responded by indicating that in his opinion land reform was a strictly political issue, not one to be questioned or debated by the judiciary.&lt;ref name="QEH2"/&gt;

The increasing politicisation of land reform was accompanied by the deterioration of diplomatic relations between Zimbabwe and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="QEH2"/&gt; Public opinion on the Zimbabwean land reform process among British citizens was decidedly mediocre; it was perceived as a poor investment on the part of the UK's government in an ineffectual and shoddily implemented programme.&lt;ref name="QEH2"/&gt; In June 1996, [[Lynda Chalker]], British secretary of state for international development, declared that she could not endorse the new compulsory acquisition policy and urged Mugabe to return to the principles of "willing buyer, willing seller".&lt;ref name="QEH2"/&gt; 

On 5 November 1997, Chalker's successor, [[Clare Short]], described the new Labour government's approach to Zimbabwean land reform. She said that the UK did not accept that Britain had a special responsibility to meet the costs of land purchase in Zimbabwe. Notwithstanding the Lancaster House commitments, Short stated that her government was only prepared to support a programme of land reform that was part of a poverty eradication strategy. She had other questions regarding the way in which land would be acquired and compensation paid, and the transparency of the process. Her government's position was spelt out in a letter to Zimbabwe's Agriculture Minister, Kumbirai Kangai:&lt;ref name=Short/&gt;

:''I should make it clear that '''we do not accept that Britain has a special responsibility to meet the costs of land purchase in Zimbabwe.''' We are a new government from diverse backgrounds without links to former colonial interests. My own origins are Irish and, as you know, we were colonised, not colonisers.''

The letter concluded by stating that a programme of rapid land acquisition would be impossible to support, citing concern about the damage which this might do to Zimbabwe's agricultural output and its prospects of attracting investment.&lt;ref name=Short&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa5391/is_200705/ai_n21288044 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130811072611/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa5391/is_200705/ai_n21288044 |archivedate=11 August 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Greste&gt;{{cite news|last=Greste |first=Peter |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7349166.stm |title=Africa &amp;#124; Why Mugabe is deaf to the West |publisher=BBC News |date=15 April 2008 |accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kenneth Kaunda]], former president of [[Zambia]], responded dismissively by saying "when Tony Blair took over in 1997, I understand that some young lady in charge of colonial issues within that government simply dropped doing anything about it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6728015.stm |title=Africa &amp;#124; Viewpoint: Kaunda on Mugabe |publisher=BBC News |date=12 June 2007 |accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1998, the Zimbabwe government published its "policy framework" on the '''Land Reform and Resettlement Programme Phase II''' (LRRP II), which envisaged the compulsory purchase over five years of 50,000 square kilometres from the 112,000 square kilometres owned by white commercial farmers, public corporations, churches, non-governmental organisations and multinational companies. Broken down, the 50,000 square kilometres meant that every year between 1998 and 2003, the government intended to purchase 10,000 square kilometres for redistribution.

In September 1998, the government called a donors conference in Harare on LRRP II to inform the donor community and involve them in the program: Forty-eight countries and international organisations attended and unanimously endorsed the land program, saying it was essential for poverty reduction, political stability and economic growth. They agreed that the inception phase, covering the first 24 months, should start immediately, particularly appreciating the political imperative and urgency of the proposal.

The Commercial Farmers Union freely offered to sell the government 15,000 square kilometres for redistribution, but landowners once again dragged their feet. In response to moves by the National Constitutional Assembly, a group of academics, trade unionists and other political activists, the government drafted a new constitution.  The draft was discussed widely by the public in formal meetings and amended to include restrictions on presidential powers, limits to the presidential term of office, and an age limit of 70 for presidential candidates.  This was not seen as a suitable outcome for the government, so the proposals were amended to replace those clauses with one to compulsorily acquire land for redistribution without compensation. The opposition mostly boycotted the drafting stage of the constitution claiming that this new version was to entrench Mugabe politically.

Guerrilla veterans of the [[Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army]] (ZANLA) and [[Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army]] (ZIPRA) began to emerge as a radical force in the land issue around this time. The guerrillas forcefully presented their position that white-owned land in Zimbabwe was rightfully theirs, on account of promises made to them during the Rhodesian Bush War.&lt;ref name="Fisher"/&gt; Calls for accelerated land reform were also echoed by an affluent urban class of black Zimbabweans who were interested in making inroads into commercial farming, with public assistance.&lt;ref name="Fisher"/&gt;

===Fast-track land reform and violence===

The government organised a referendum on the new constitution in February 2000, despite having a sufficiently large majority in parliament to pass any amendment it wished. Had it been approved, the new constitution would have empowered the government to acquire land compulsorily without compensation. Despite vast support in the media, the new constitution was defeated, 55% to 45%.

A few days later, the pro-Mugabe [[Zimbabwe National Liberation War Veterans Association]] (ZNLWVA) organised several people (including but not limited to war veterans; many of them were their children and grandchildren) to march on white-owned farmlands, initially with drums, song and dance. This movement was officially termed the "Fast-Track Land Reform Program" (FTLRP). The predominantly white farm owners were forced off their lands along with their workers, who were typically of regional descent. This was often done violently and without compensation. In this first wave of farm invasions, a total of 110,000 square kilometres of land had been seized. Several million black farm workers were excluded from the redistribution, leaving them without employment. According to [[Human Rights Watch]], by 2002 the War Veterans Association had "killed white farm owners in the course of occupying commercial farms" on at least seven occasions, in addition to "several tens of [black] farm workers".&lt;ref name=HRW&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2002/03/08/fast-track-land-reform-zimbabwe |title=Fast Track Land Reform in Zimbabwe &amp;#124; Human Rights Watch |publisher=Hrw.org |date=8 March 2002 |accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first white farmers to die as a direct consequence of the resettlement programme were murdered by Zimbabwean paramilitaries in mid-2000.

Officially the land was divided into small-holder production, so called A1 schemes and commercial farms, called A2 schemes.

The Minister for Lands, Land Reform and Resettlement, John Nkomo, had declared five days earlier that all land, from crop fields to wildlife conservancies, would soon become state property.

Parliament, dominated by [[Zanu-PF]], passed a constitutional amendment, signed into law on 12 September 2005, that nationalised farmland acquired through the "Fast Track" process and deprived original landowners of the right to challenge in court the government's decision to expropriate their land.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2005-09/2005-09-12-voa36.cfm?CFID=18138884&amp;CFTOKEN=35884117 |title=Archived copy |access-date=6 May 2014 |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20051112040534/http://voanews.com/english/archive/2005-09/2005-09-12-voa36.cfm?CFID=53041476&amp;CFTOKEN=35798529 |archive-date=12 November 2005 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Supreme Court of Zimbabwe]] ruled against legal challenges to this amendment.&lt;ref name="zimsupct"&gt;Mike Campbell (Private) Limited v.

In January 2006, Agriculture Minister [[Joseph Made]] said Zimbabwe was considering legislation that would compel commercial banks to finance black peasants who had been allocated formerly white-owned farmland in the land reforms. Made warned that banks failing to lend a substantial portion of their income to these farmers would have their licenses withdrawn.

The newly resettled peasants had largely failed to secure loans from commercial banks because they did not have title over the land on which they were resettled, and thus could not use it as collateral. With no security of tenure on the farms, banks have been reluctant to extend loans to the new farmers, many of whom do not have much experience in commercial farming, nor assets to provide alternative collateral for any borrowed money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Basildon Peta |url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=68&amp;art_id=vn20060110061257518C122253 |title=Harare may force banks to fund black farmers |publisher=IOL.co.za |date=10 January 2006 |accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath and outcomes==

===Land redistribution===
Conflicting reports emerged regarding the effects of Mugabe's land reform programme. In February 2000, the [[African National Congress]] media liaison department reported that Mugabe had given himself 15 farms, while [[Simon Muzenda]] received 13. Cabinet ministers held 160 farms among them, sitting ZANU-PF parliamentarians 150, and the 2,500 war veterans only two. Another 4,500 landless peasants were allocated three.&lt;ref name="Cry"/&gt; The programme also left another 200,000 farmworkers displaced and homeless, with just under 5% receiving compensation in the form of land expropriated from their ousted employers.&lt;ref name="Reconciliation"&gt;{{cite book | last = Brian Raftopoulos &amp; Tyrone Savage| authorlink = | title = Zimbabwe: Injustice and Political Reconciliation|edition= 1 July 2001|pages= 220–239 | publisher = Institute for Justice and Reconciliation| isbn= 0-9584794-4-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Institute of Development Studies]] of the University of Sussex published a report countering that the Zimbabwean economy is recovering and that new business is growing in the rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ids.ac.uk/news/zimbabwe-s-land-reform-ten-years-on-new-study-dispels-the-myths |title=Institute of Development Studies: Zimbabwe's land reform ten years on: new study dispels the myths |publisher=Ids.ac.uk |accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study reported that of around 7 million hectares of land redistributed via the land reform (or 20% of Zimbabwe's area), 49.9% of those who received land were rural peasants, 18.3% were "unemployed or in low-paid jobs in regional towns, growth points and mines," 16.5% were civil servants, and 6.7% were of the Zimbabwean working class. Despite the claims by critics of the land reform only benefiting government bureaucrats, only 4.8% of the land went to business people, and 3.7% went to security services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Scoones,Ian; Marongwe, Nelson; Mavedzenge, Blasio; Mahenehene, Jacob; Murimbarimba, Felix; Sukume, Chrispen|year=2010|title=Zimbabwe's Land Reform: Myths &amp; Realities|publisher=James Currey|ISBN=978-1847010247|pages=272}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 5% of the households (not the same as 5% of the land) went to absentee farmers well connected to ZANU-PF. Masvingo is however a part of the country with relatively poor farming land, and it is possible more farms went to "cell-phone farmers" in other parts of the country, according to the study.&lt;ref name=Scoones2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thezimbabwean.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=35138:zimbabwes-land-reform-challenging-the-myths&amp;catid=69:sunday-top-stories&amp;Itemid=30&amp;q=scoones |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130505075110/http://www.thezimbabwean.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=35138:zimbabwes-land-reform-challenging-the-myths&amp;catid=69:sunday-top-stories&amp;Itemid=30&amp;q=scoones |dead-url=yes |archive-date=5 May 2013 |title=Zimbabwes land reform: challenging the myths |publisher=The Zimbabwean |accessdate=20 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study has been criticised for focusing on detailed local cases in one province ([[Masvingo Province]]) and ignoring the violent nature of resettlement and aspects of international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dore |first=Dale |url=http://www.sokwanele.com/myths_reality_and_the_inconvenient_truth_about_Zimbabwes_land_resettlement_programme_131112 |title=Myths, Reality and The Inconvenient Truth about Zimbabwe's Land Resettlement Programme |date=13 November 2012 |publisher=Sokwanele |accessdate=18 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614152517/http://www.sokwanele.com/myths_reality_and_the_inconvenient_truth_about_Zimbabwes_land_resettlement_programme_131112 |archivedate=14 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics continue to maintain that the primary beneficiaries are Mugabe loyalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/10/robert-mugabe-land-reform|title=Robert Mugabe's land reform comes under fresh scrutiny|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=10 May 2013|accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2011, there were around 300 white farmers remaining in Zimbabwe.&lt;ref name=freeman&gt;{{cite web|last=Freeman |first=Colin |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/zimbabwe/8598458/The-end-of-an-era-for-Zimbabwes-last-white-farmers.html |title=The end of an era for Zimbabwe's last white farmers? |publisher=Telegraph |accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact on production===

Before 2000, land-owning farmers had large tracts of land and used [[economies of scale]] to raise capital, borrow money when necessary, and purchase modern mechanised farm equipment to increase productivity on their land. Because the primary beneficiaries of the land reform were members of the Government and their families, despite the fact that most had no experience in running a farm, the drop in total farm output has been tremendous and has even produced starvation and famine, according to aid agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dancaescu |first=Nick |year=2003 |title=Note: Land reform in Zimbabwe |volume=15 |journal=Florida Journal of International Law |pages=615–644 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Export crops have suffered tremendously in this period. Whereas Zimbabwe was the world's sixth-largest producer of tobacco in 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/tobacco/en/atlas16.pdf |title=Growing Tobacco |publisher=Who.int |accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2005 it produced less than a third the amount produced in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afrol.com/articles/17158 |title=afrol News – Tiny tobacco crop spells doom in Zimbabwe |publisher=Afrol.com |accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zimbabwe was once so rich in agricultural produce that it was dubbed the "bread basket" of Southern Africa, while it is now struggling to feed its own population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|magazine=The Economist |date=27 June 2002 |title=From breadbasket to basket case: Faced with famine, Robert Mugabe orders farmers to stop growing food |url=http://www.economist.com/node/1201137 }}&lt;/ref&gt; About 45 per cent of the population is now considered [[malnutrition|malnourished]].  Crops for export such as tobacco, coffee and tea have suffered the most under the land reform. Annual production of maize, the main everyday food for Zimbabweans, was reduced by 31% during 2002 to 2012, while annual small grains production was up 163% during the same period.&lt;ref name=Scoones /&gt; With over a million hectares converted from primarily export crops to primarily maize, production of maize finally reached pre-2001 volume in 2017 under [[Mnangagwa]]'s "command agriculture" programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Land reform is a Zimbabwe success story – it will be the basis for economic recovery under Mnangagwa |date=29 November 2017 |newspaper=The Conversation |url=https://theconversation.com/land-reform-is-a-zimbabwe-success-story-it-will-be-the-basis-for-economic-recovery-under-mnangagwa-88205 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tobacco====

{{See also|Tobacco in Zimbabwe}}

Land reform caused a collapse in Zimbabwe's tobacco crop, its main agricultural export.  In 2001, Zimbabwe was the world's sixth-largest producer of tobacco, behind only China, Brazil, India, the United States and Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/tobacco/en/atlas16.pdf |title=Growing Tobacco |publisher=Who.int |accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2008, tobacco production had collapsed to 48 million kg, just 21% of the amount grown in 2000 and smaller than the crop grown in 1950.&lt;ref name="bloomberg2013"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marawanyika|first1=Godfrey|title=Mugabe Makes Zimbabwe’s Tobacco Farmers Land Grab Winners|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-11-03/mugabe-makes-zimbabwe-s-tobacco-farmers-land-grab-winners|work=Bloomberg|date=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hodder-williams1983"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hodder-Williams|first1=Richard|title=White Farmers in Rhodesia, 1890–1965: A History of the Marandellas District|date=1983|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781349048953}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|189}}

In 2005, the contract system was introduced into Zimbabwe.  International tobacco companies contracted with small-scale subsistence farmers to buy their crop. In return, the farmers received agricultural products such as seeds and fertiliser, as well as advice and supervision.&lt;ref name="bloomberg2011"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Latham|first1=Brian|title=Mugabe’s Seized Farms Boost Profits at British American Tobacco|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2011-11-30/mugabe-s-seized-farms-boost-british-american-tobacco-profits-in-zimbabwe|work=Bloomberg|date=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="herald2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kawadza|first1=Sydney|title=Contract farming: Future for agriculture|url=http://www.herald.co.zw/contract-farming-future-for-agric/|work=The Herald (Zimbabwe)|date=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Production revived as the small-scale black farmers gained experience in growing tobacco.&lt;ref name=Polgreen&gt;{{cite news|last=Polgreen |first=Lydia |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/21/world/africa/in-zimbabwe-land-takeover-a-golden-lining.html |title=In Zimbabwe Land Takeover, a Golden Lining |location=Zimbabwe |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=20 July 2012 |accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014, Zimbabwe produced 217 million kg of tobacco, the third-largest crop on record.&lt;ref name="xinhua2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Machingura|first1=Gretinah|title=Partnering Chinese, Zimbabwe tobacco farmers embark on road to success|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-07/10/c_135502309.htm|work=Xinhua|date=July 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fao2003"&gt;{{cite book|title=Issues in the Global Tobacco Economy|date=2003|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|chapter=Tobacco in Zimbabwe|chapter-url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/y4997e/y4997e0k.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This increase in production came at the cost of quality as the capacity to produce higher-value cured high-nicotine tobacco was lost being largely replaced by lower-value filler-quality tobacco.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.politicsweb.co.za/news-and-analysis/the-last-white-farmers-of-zimbabwe|title=The last white farmers of Zimbabwe|last=Raath|first=Jan|date=26 October 2015|website=|publisher=Politics Web|access-date=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic consequences===
{{See also|Economy of Zimbabwe}}
[[File:Zimbabwe GDP per cap 2015.png|right|thumb|250px| [[GDP per capita]] in current US dollars from 1980 to 2014. The graph compares Zimbabwe (blue {{color box|#0000FF}}) and all of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]'s (yellow {{color box|#DAA520}}) GDP per capita. Different periods in Zimbabwe's recent economic history such as the land reform period (pink {{color box|#FFC0CB}}), hyperinflation (grey {{color box|#C0C0C0}}), and the dollarisation/government of national unity period (light blue {{color box|#ADD8E6}}) are also highlighted.  It shows that economic activity declined in Zimbabwe over the period that the land reforms took place whilst the rest of Africa rapidly overtook the country in the same period.&lt;ref name="WDI"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://databank.worldbank.org/ddp/home.do?Step=3&amp;id=4 | title=World Development Indicators | publisher=World Bank | accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Critics of the land reforms have contended that they have had a serious detrimental effect on the Zimbabwean economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Richardson |first=Craig J. |year=2004 |title=The Collapse of Zimbabwe in the Wake of the 2000–2003 Land Reforms |location= Lewiston, New York |publisher=Mellen Press |isbn=978-0-7734-6366-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|agency=Agence France-Presse |title=Zimbabwe won't return land to white farmers: Mnangagwa |date=10 February 2018 |newspaper=[[Daily Nation]] |location=Nairobi, Kenya |url=https://www.nation.co.ke/news/africa/Zimbabwe-will-not-return-land-white-farmers-Emmerson-Mnangagwa-/1066-4299558-f7il3p/index.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180210161810/https://www.nation.co.ke/news/africa/Zimbabwe-will-not-return-land-white-farmers-Emmerson-Mnangagwa-/1066-4299558-f7il3p/index.html |archive-date=10 February 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rebound in Zimbabwean GDP following dollarisation is attributable to loans and foreign aid obtained by pledging the country's vast natural resources—including diamonds, gold, and platinum—to foreign powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Richardson |first=Craig J. |year=2013 |title=Zimbabwe Why Is One of the World’s Least-Free Economies Growing So Fast? |journal=Policy Analysis |issue=722 |publisher=Cato Institute |url=http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa722.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sikwila |first=Mike Nyamazana |year=2013 |title=Dollarization and the Zimbabwe’s Economy |journal=Journal of Economics and Behavioural Studies |volume=5 |issue= 6 |pages=398–405 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mike_Sikwila/publication/310152327_Dollarization_and_the_Zimbabwe's_Economy/links/5829b98008aef00c20561ac9.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chigome |first=Joyce |year=2015 |title=A Reflection on Sustainability of Dollarization in Zimbabwe |journal=International Journal of Advanced Research |volume=3 |issue=7 |pages=306–312 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Joyce_Chigome/publication/280732787_A_Reflection_on_Sustainability_of_Dollarization_in_Zimbabwe/links/55c3ba2708aeb97567401bf7/A-Reflection-on-Sustainability-of-Dollarization-in-Zimbabwe.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to what was described as the "fast-track land reform" in Zimbabwe, the United States government put the Zimbabwean government on a credit freeze in 2001 through the [[Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act of 2001]] (specifically Section 4C titled Multilateral Financing Restriction),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=s107-494&amp;version=enr&amp;nid=t0%3Aenr%3A30 |title=Full Text of S. 494 (107th): Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act of 2001 |publisher=GovTrack.us |date=13 December 2001 |accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which collapsed the trade surplus in 2002. Where there was a trade surplus of $322 million in 2001, in 2002 the credit freeze led to a trade deficit of $18 million, to grow rapidly in subsequent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/ai469e/ai469e00.htm |title=Fao Global Information And Early Warning System on Food And Agriculture – World Food Programme |publisher=Fao.org |accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Movement of Socialists''' ({{lang-sr|Покрет социјалиста}}, ''Pokret socijalista'', '''PS''') is a [[Socialism|socialist]] political party in [[Serbia]]. Founded in 2008, it is currently led by [[Aleksandar Vulin]], a former member of [[Yugoslav Left]]. It is a part of the governing coalition with the [[Serbian Progressive Party]] (SNS). It is formed by former members of the [[Socialist Party of Serbia]] because they disagreed with the pro-EU policy of the party. However, It was a member of the pro-EU SNS-led coalitions in the [[Serbian parliamentary election, 2012|2012 parliamentary election]] (as part of [[Let's Get Serbia Moving]] alliance) and in the [[Serbian parliamentary election, 2014|2014 parliamentary election]].

'''Nikolai Andreyevich Ishutin''' ({{lang-ru|Николай Андреевич Ишутин}}; 3 (15) April 1840 &amp;ndash; 5 (17) January 1879) was one of the first [[Russia]]n [[utopian socialist]]s, who combined [[socialism|socialist]] [[propaganda]] with [[conspiracy (political)|conspiratorial]] and [[Terrorism|terrorist]] [[tactic (method)|tactics]].&lt;ref name=GSE&gt;{{cite web|title=Ишутин Николай Андреевич|url=http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/bse/91717/%D0%98%D1%88%D1%83%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BD|website=[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=peoples&gt;{{cite web|title=Nikolay Ishutin|url=http://www.peoples.ru/state/revolutionary/nikolay_ishutin/|website=peoples.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hrono&gt;{{cite web|title=Ишутин Николай Андреевич|url=http://www.hrono.ru/biograf/ishutin.html|website=Hrono.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ishutin was a hereditary noble in his hometown of [[Serdobsk]]. He was raised in [[Penza]] by the family of his [[cousin]] [[Dmitry Karakozov]]. In 1863, he became a lecturer at [[Moscow State University]], where he propagandized among the students. That same year Ishutin organized a secret [[revolutionary]] society, which would come to be known as the [[Ishutin Society]].

On April 8, 1866, he was arrested in connection with his cousin Karakozov's [[assassination]] attempt on Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]]. The Supreme Criminal Court sentenced Ishutin to death by [[hanging]], which was commuted to exile for life shortly before his scheduled execution. Ishutin was placed in solitary confinement in [[Shlisselburg Fortress]] until May 1868, when he was transferred, mentally ill, to [[Algachi prison]] in Eastern Siberia. In 1871, Ishutin's place of exile was changed to [[Nerchinsk]] and, in 1875, to [[Kara katorga]], where he died in 1879.

'''Operation Mississippi Hustle''' is an ongoing federal investigation initiated in 2014 or earlier by the United States Attorney and prosecuted in the United States Court for the Southern District of Mississippi. It has examined the relationship between officials of the [[Mississippi Department of Corrections]] and various for-profit prison contractors and subcontractors who have provided services to the five private prisons in the state. (One has since been closed in September 2016.)

The FBI revealed a long history of corruption and bribery, beginning as early as 1997. The investigation resulted in indictments on November 6, 2014 against [[Chris Epps]], long-serving Commissioner of the Department of Corrections; the previous day he resigned from his state office and as president of the [[American Correctional Association]] (ACA). He had received bribes and kickbacks worth at least $1.47 million, based on contracts of $868 million with private prison operators and related service providers. 

By October 2018, the US Attorney for Southern Mississippi had won indictments against sixteen other officials, consultants, contractors and businessmen, including two former state legislators, and more were expected. Eleven have pleaded guilty, one killed himself, and the identity of another has not yet been made public. The ex-mayor of Walnut Grove, William Grady Sims, finished his sentence. Six other defendants were convicted and are in federal custody. Theresa Malone's ex-legislator husband was not indicted, and died during the proceedings. After a double lung transplant and subsequent serious complications, she has yet to be sentenced. Four Louisiana defendants await trial.

The Mississippi Attorney General announced in February 2017 that he was filing civil suits against 15 prison contractors and several individuals, for damages and punitive damages related to the corruption cases. He said that "state law requires that they must also forfeit and return the entire amount of the contracts paid by the state."&lt;ref name=Hood/&gt;

== Overview ==

In the late 20th century, Mississippi began to enter into contract with private prison management companies to build and operate prisons. It eventually had contracts for six for-profit prisons: [[Walnut Grove Youth Correctional Facility]], for inmates under 18 who had been convicted as adults;[[East Mississippi Correctional Facility]], devoted to treatment of state prisoners with mental illness; [[Marshall County Correctional Facility]]; [[Tallahatchie County Correctional Facility]]; [[Wilkinson County Correctional Facility]], which was converted to maximum security after receiving numerous prisoners transferred from [[Mississippi State Penitentiary]] following settlement of a class-action suit there, and [[Delta Corrrectional Facility]], which closed after an escape. Contracts were also made for related mental and medical health services, education, telecommunications, and food services. In 2002 [[Christopher Epps]] was appointed as Commissioner of [[Mississippi Department of Corrections]]; he served under three governors.

On November 6, 2014, the [[United States Attorney]] for the [[Southern District of Mississippi]] announced indictments he had obtained against the Commissioner [[Chris Epps]] and his associate Cecil McCrory, a consultant and Republican former state house member. The government charged that, beginning as early as 2005, Epps had begun to take bribes from various contractors and subcontractors for the state; they had been passed through McCrory and another consultant, Robert Simmons. Those payments had been [[structuring|structured]] to fall beneath the mandated reporting amount so that bank deposits would not come to the attention of federal banking authorities. Epps resigned as commissioner and as the president of the ACA the day before the indictments were announced. Both defendants entered into plea bargains and became cooperating witnesses; initially they were to assist the government with the identification of the originators of those bribes, who were also to be prosecuted with the help of both men.

Epps had been appointed to the Commissioner post in 2002 by Democratic Governor [[Ronnie Musgrove]], and was retained by his successors, Republican governors [[Haley Barbour]] in 2004, and [[Phil Bryant]] in 2012. In 2011, Epps had told assembled attorneys involved in negotiating lawsuits that had been brought against the [[Walnut Grove Correctional Facility]] and the [[East Mississippi Correctional Facility]], that he could not end the contracts of the for-profit companies operating Mississippi's prisons "because of all the money they spread around Jackson," the state capital.&lt;ref name="money"/&gt; His remarks were made during the period when the U.S. Attorney in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi|Southern District of Mississippi]] has said Epps was receiving more than $700,000 in bribes, including the purchase of a beachfront condo on his behalf.&lt;ref name="money"&gt;[http://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/2014/11/22/lawyers-epps-said-prison-companies-spread-money/19425009/ "Lawyers: Epps said prison companies 'spread' money"], ''[[Clarion Ledger]]'', Jerry Mitchell, November 22, 2014. Retrieved 29 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The government's revised estimates of those alleged bribes to Epps have increased to an estimated total of at least $1.47 million. Over the next two years, the U.S. Attorney filed numerous indictments against persons alleged to have paid the bribes, and he indicated that further indictments would be forthcoming. A year after entering a plea of guilty, McCrory requested that he be allowed to change his plea to one of "not guilty" and go to trial. This request was rejected by the judge. Many other defendants pleaded "guilty;" others "not guilty." One defendant committed [[suicide]] shortly before his arraignment. Numerous corporations were ordered by the presiding Federal judge, [[Henry Travillion Wingate]] to produce business records. Some complied, others ignored the subpoenas, and four requested that the information they were willing to provide be kept under seal, which the judge took under advisement.

On November 1, 2016, while still awaiting sentencing, Epps was arrested for breaking into the home he had forfeited to the federal government as a part of his plea bargain. He had removed light fixtures and other items which he moved to his nearby previous domicile, which he was again occupying.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/2016/11/02/chris-epps-bond/93165460/ Jimmy E. Gates, "Epps may have violated bond terms with burglary charge"], ''[[Clarion Ledger]]'', 2 November 2016. Retrieved 3 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; His bail was revoked and in December 2016, Judge Wingate ruled that he would be held in jail until sentencing. On May 24, 2017, Epps received a sentence of almost 20 years.

==Background==
Mississippi was among the many states that began to rely in the late 20th century and early 21st century on private contractors to build and operate prisons to house its growing number of inmates convicted and sentenced under increased criminalization of drug possession and a variety of mandatory sentencing laws. The private prisons and management included contracts with [[GEO Group]], which purchased [[Cornell Corrections]], the Texas firm that built and operated the [[Walnut Grove Correctional Facility]] in [[Walnut Grove, Mississippi]]. The prison opened in 2001 in an unincorporated area of Leake County, but the town annexed the prison property to increase its population and tax base; it derived 15% of its revenues from the prison corporation's payment in lieu of taxes.&lt;ref name="profits"/&gt; The [[East Mississippi Correctional Facility]] was another private prison, operated by Florida's GEO Group, then by Utah's [[Management and Training Corporation]]. Numerous contractors served other public and for-profit facilities, providing related telecommunications, food services, health, and other services.

According to [[Leake County, Mississippi|Leake County]] Sheriff Greg Waggoner, he initiated the federal investigation into the state Department of Corrections activities. In 2009, he said, Epps' MDOC leased buildings owned by Cecil McCrory in Walnut Grove, Mississippi, for what became the [[Walnut Grove Transition Center]]. MDOC also contracted with McCrory to operate the male and female facilities. Although Walnut Grove's longtime mayor, Sims, had no correctional experience, McCrory appointed him as the warden of the Transition Center. In addition, Sims had a separate contract for revenues from 19 vending machines at the Walnut Grove Youth Correctional Facility.&lt;ref name="profits"&gt;{{cite web | last = Burnett | first = John | title = Town Relies On Troubled Youth Prison For Profits | publisher = NPR | date = March 25, 2011 | url = https://www.npr.org/2011/03/25/134850972/town-relies-on-troubled-youth-prison-for-profits}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walnut Grove was to be a model transition center: a type of halfway house as part of a state effort to support newly released inmates in adjusting to life outside prison. The center charged newly released inmates $20 a day for room and board in dormitories, and was paid a supplement of $6 daily, per bed, by the MDOC. Nearby Walnut Grove residents complained that the center residents were poorly supervised and seemed to be roaming in town without structured activities.&lt;ref name="hustle"/&gt;

According to Waggoner, "It looked like everything new that happened with MDOC, Cecil [McCrory] was involved in... They [residents of the center] were not supposed to be out at all."&lt;ref name="hustle"/&gt; He said, "If I ran my facility like that, Epps would have shut me down, but it seemed like there was no problem when McCrory did it."&lt;ref name="hustle"/&gt; After Sims was reported to have taken a female inmate to a motel in nearby Carthage for sex in November 2009, Sheriff Waggoner became involved. He reported the allegation to MDOC, which assigned an internal investigator to assist the sheriff in an investigation.&lt;ref name="hustle"/&gt;

Investigators from both Leake County and the state jointly talked to the female inmate, gathering evidence to refer the case to the county district attorney. In the spring of 2010, before they could do so, the MDOC investigator came to Waggoner and told him it was over. "We're closing the case down," he told Waggoner, who was "shocked" and asked, "What do you mean?"&lt;ref name="hustle"/&gt; Waggoner told a reporter, "You could tell he wasn't happy about it but that he was given orders."&lt;ref name="hustle"/&gt; Waggoner said firing a man who committed a felony doesn't end an investigation. It ends when the man is indicted and brought to justice; "If you have knowledge of a felony and chose not to pursue it, you're negligent in your duty."&lt;ref name="hustle"/&gt; Stunned by the MDOC's termination of the Sims investigation, Waggoner called U.S. Attorney John Dowdy for advice. Dowdy said he contacted the FBI afterward to report the situation. The FBI launched an investigation against Sims and eventually Epps, and named it, "Mississippi Hustle." &lt;ref name="hustle"&gt;[http://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/2014/11/22/epps-probe-miss-hustle-started-sex-scandal/19425221/ Epps probe, "Mississippi Hustle" started sex scandal], ''[[Clarion Ledger]]'', Emily LeCoz, November 22, 2014.

On November 6, 2014, the [[Federal Government of the United States]] announced that it had indicted Epps on corruption charges;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/8/epps-star-falls-in-miss-after-federal-indictment/?page=all Epps’ star falls in Miss. after federal indictment"], ''[[Washington Times]]'', Emily Wagster Pettus,  November 8, 2014.

''[[The New York Times]]''. 25 February 2015. Retrieved on February 27, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The federal indictment stated that McCrory, a Republican and former Mississippi State House member, was a businessman who served as the chairperson of the [[Rankin County School District]]'s board of education. He had paid Epps with kickbacks and bribes totaling more than $1 million. Those transactions included a $200,000 payment, as part of the mortgage of Epps' primary residence in the Jackson area. Epps leveraged the resulting increased equity together with another bribe payment to buy a condominium; he later traded up the latter for a larger, more expensive condo. In exchange, Epps directed contracts to McCrory-owned companies for prison-services contracts, as well as to related companies that hired McCrory as a paid consultant. Per the indictment, the activity started in 2007 and ended on March 12, 2014. Epps entered an initial plea of not guilty, and he received a bond of $25,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wapt.com/politics/report-corrections-commissioner-resigning-amid-investigation/29560758 Epps pleads not guilty to federal bribery charges], ''[[WAPT]]'', Tammy Estwick, November 7, 2014.

McCrory had previously served as a judge and former Sheriff's investigator. He started a prison commissary company, G.T. Enterprises, selling it at a substantial profit to the Centric Group holding company, which owns the Keefe Commissary Network (KCN). McCrory also had gone to work for [[Correctional Communications Inc.]] "I brought Cecil in,&lt;!--not a mistake--&gt; in 1996, to help me with political connections," said owner and consultant, Sam Waggoner. "I do all the work, and Cecil did the political stuff. I talk to him about twice a year."&lt;ref name="LeCoz"/&gt; Waggoner, of Carthage, said the scandal had affected his business, and he worried he'd lose some of the 40 or so contracts he and McCrory had been given during the past two decades. "Nobody wants to be associated with the company because of the stigma," he said. "But he did no contracts with the county jails, no connections with the sheriffs or anything like that."&lt;ref name="LeCoz"/&gt; Sam Waggoner subsequently pleaded guilty to bribery.&lt;ref name="LeCoz"&gt;[http://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/2014/11/08/alleged-kickback-scheme-mccrorys-connections-vast/18739671/ Alleged kickback scheme: McCrory's connections vast],''[[The Clarion-Ledger]]'', Emily Le Coz, 8 November 2014.

In November 2014 Governor [[Phil Bryant]], formerly the State Auditor, ordered rebids of the four operating contracts for prisons that had been awarded by Epps to Utah-based [[Management and Training Corporation]] (MTC). Bryant directed interim Corrections Commissioner Richard McCarty to stop negotiations with MTC over renewing a $60-million-a-year contract to manage four private prisons, which held 4,000-plus state inmates. MTC had been sued for mistreatment of inmates in two of those prisons.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.wapt.com/politics/bryant-orders-prison-contracts-rebid/29596616 Bryant orders prison contracts rebid]" ([https://www.webcitation.org/6WfwguFgT Archive]).

Cecil McCrory plea bargained to lesser federal charges. He had begun working as a consultant to MTC, [[GEO Group]]'s successor operator in Mississippi for state prison contracts. It had held a $60 million contract to operate three Mississippi prisons: [[Walnut Grove Correctional Facility]], [[East Mississippi Correctional Facility]] and Marshall County Correctional Facility, which had been managed by GEO Group, and a fourth, [[Wilkinson County Correctional Facility]], which had been managed by the [[Corrections Corporation of America]].

In addition, Benjamin was paid at least $862,000 to acquire and maintain ACA accreditation for jails in numerous counties. Passing ACA standards was required if the prisons were to gain contracts to hold state prisoners. Epps had been elected in 2010 as the president of the ACA, and resigned the day before his indictment was announced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://themississippilink.com/2010/05/25/mdoc-commissioner-named-president-of-aca/ MDOC Commissioner named President of the ACA], ''[[Mississippi Link]]'', May 25, 2010.

Benjamin, had represented Alcorn County in the State House from 1976–80 and the State Senate 1984-92. He later worked for Republican Lieutenant Governor [[Eddie Briggs]], who ran as a candidate for the governorship. Alcorn County paid Benjamin, president and lobbyist for Mississippi Correctional Management (MCM), $114,000 a year &lt;!-- for what? is this in total? confusing --&gt;, although he lived more than 200 miles away. The attorney of the Alcorn County Board of Supervisors said the supervisors were not required to seek bids before giving Benjamin the contract as warden, because it was a contract for services, which are exempt from state bid laws. He was also paid $5,000 a month to handle and maintain accreditation by the [[American Correctional Association]] for the Alcorn's Regional Correctional Facility and another $4,500 a month as warden of the jail.

Benjamin had formed his business MCM in 1996, when the state Department of Corrections and counties started hiring private contractors to operate prisons and smaller regional jails. MCM operated the Grenada County Jail for several years. Benjamin said the company also had jail accreditation contracts worth $4,000 or $5,000 per month with other counties, including Chickasaw, Hancock, Holmes, Marion, Pearl River, Washington and Yazoo. In the past, he also worked as a $3,000-a-month jail consultant for DeSoto County. The DeSoto County Board of Supervisors supervisors had approved his contract in December 2008, saying: "Mr. Benjamin was recommended by Commissioner Epps at the state level." On November 25, 2014, Benjamin said that he was not aware of the Epps recommendation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/25/county-pays-ex-lawmaker-thousands-for-jail-work/County pays ex-lawmaker thousands for jail work], ''[[Washington Times]]'', Emily Wagster Pettus (AP), November 25, 2014.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Darren LaMarca had announced in June 2016, that eleven additional subjects of the investigation may face criminal charges in the Epps' bribery cases. Ten more people could face federal indictments; another could face state charges, which had been expected by mid-July. LaMarca estimated that the corruption's net benefit to contractors exceeded $65 million. Investigators have determined that Epps demanded bribes to exercise his influence, not only at the state level, but among county supervisors. Epps controlled where state inmates were placed, giving him influence over local jails. Besides Criminal Chief LaMarca, Assistant U.S. Attorney Patrick Lemon, financial analyst Kim Mitchell, acting U.S. Attorney Harold Brittain and FBI Special Agent in Charge Christopher Freeze, were involved in investigating and prosecuting the case. They estimated a total of $65 million in questionable contracts were involved in the scheme.&lt;ref name=LaMarca /&gt; Given the amount, federal sentencing guidelines recommended that Epps could receive a maximum of 23 years. However, Epps' lawyer asked the judge to sentence Epps based only on the value of the bribes he collected. If the lower amount of $1.47 million had been used, Epps faced a recommended sentence between 14 and 17 1/2 years. Wingate had latitude in sentencing. Because of Epps' cooperation in providing information about those paying the bribes, prosecutors recommended a shorter sentence for the former commissioner.&lt;ref name="blog11"/&gt;

Calculating benefit to 16 contractors necessitated examining their accounts. On June 30, John Colette, Epps' defense attorney, said he had received more than 1,500 pages of documents in the previous week and would require at least 30 days to review them. Four companies asked Wingate to shield their information from public view; four more did not respond to subpoenas. Wingate said he would hold a hearing by July 16, 2016, to consider requests for protective orders, and to consider contempt orders against companies that had failed to respond to disclosure requests.&lt;ref name="blog11"&gt;[http://blog.gulflive.com/mississippi-press-news/2016/06/prosecutor_11_more_to_be_charg.html Prosecutor: 11 more to be charged in Mississippi prison bribery inquiry], ''[[Associated Press]]'', Jeff Amy, June 30, 2016.

==State legal issues==
On February 8, 2017, Mississippi Attorney General [[Jim Hood]] announced he had filed civil cases against 15 corporations and numerous individuals who had engaged in contracts with the MDOC and Epps, seeking damages and punitive damages. Hood said,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The state of Mississippi has been defrauded through a pattern of bribery, kickbacks, misrepresentations, fraud, concealment, money laundering and other wrongful conduct." He continued, "These individuals and corporations that benefited by stealing from taxpayers must not only pay the state's losses, but state law requires that they must also forfeit and return the entire amount of the contracts paid by the state. We are also seeking punitive damages to punish these conspirators and to deter those who might consider giving or receiving kickbacks in the future." Besides Teresa Malone and Carl Reddix, the defendants included Michael Reddix; Andrew Jenkins; Management &amp; Training Corporation; The [[GEO Group]], Inc.; [[Cornell Companies]], Inc.; [[Wexford Health Sources]], Inc.; The Bantry Group Corporation; AdminPros, L.L.C.; CGL Facility Management, LLC; Mississippi Correctional Management, Inc.; Branan Medical Corporation; Drug Testing Corporation; [[Global Tel*Link]] Corporation; Health Assurance, LLC; Keefe Commissary Network, LLC of St. Louis; [[Sentinel Offender Services]], L.L.C. and AJA Management &amp; Technical Services, Inc.&lt;ref name=Hood&gt;[http://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/politics/2017/02/08/epps-bribery-civil-lawsuit/97645586/ Mississippi AG files lawsuits in Epps bribery case], ''[[The Clarion-Ledger]]'', Jimmie E.

On May 18, 2017, Hood announced that the state had made the first settlement, involving  Alere Inc., which had purchased Branan Medical Corporation. Alere paid two million dollars. Eight lawsuits in bribery schemes are pending. They had accused at least 10 individuals and 12 out-of-state corporations of using so-called "consultants" to fix more than $800 million in Mississippi prison contracts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/2017/05/18/2-m-settlement-announced-thursday-10-lawsuits-remain/330041001/ $2M settlement announced in Epps-related lawsuit], ''[[Clarion-Ledger]]'', May 18, 2017.

In November 2017, Sentinel Offender Services LLC, which provides inmate electronic monitoring, settled its case, which had involved a two million dollar contract, for $1.3 million. Hood said his office by that time had retrieved $5.8 million on behalf of Mississippi taxpayers. However, GEO Group, formerly Wackenhut Corrections, which had operated many MDOC prisons between 1994 and 2012, continued to fight the charges.

He said the bill would, "protect crooks and scam artists by gutting the Consumer Protection Act.

[[File:AGAD Stany pruskie oddaja swe ziemie krolowi polskiemu Kazimierzowi Jagiellonczykowi i koronie polskiej.jpg|thumb|266px|Prussian Confederation offered to incorporate Prussia into the Kingdom of Poland, 1454, [[Polish Central Archives of Historical Records]]]]

The '''Prussian Confederation''' ({{lang-de|Preußischer Bund}}, {{lang-pl|Związek Pruski}}) was an organization formed on 21 February 1440 at [[Kwidzyn|Marienwerder]] by a group of 53 nobles and clergy and 19 cities in [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]], to oppose the arbitrariness of the [[Teutonic Knights]]. It was based on the basis of an earlier similar organization, the [[Lizard Union (medieval)|Lizard Union]] established in 1397 by [[Chełmno Land]] nobles. 

In 1454, the leader of the Confederation, [[Johannes von Baysen]] (Jan Bażyński), formally asked King [[Casimir IV Jagiellon]], to incorporate Prussia into the [[History of Poland during the Jagiellon dynasty|Kingdom of Poland]] as a [[Fee (feudal tenure)|fief]]. This marked the beginning of the [[Thirteen Years' War (1454–66)|Thirteen Years' War]] between the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Order's State]] and Poland, with the Prussian cities financing the military costs of the latter.

==Background==
According to the 1411 [[Peace of Thorn (1411)|First Peace of Thorn]] which followed the Teutonic Knights' defeat in the [[Battle of Grunwald]], the Teutonic Order had to pay high reparations to the Kingdom of Poland. The monastic state imposed high taxes on the cities to raise the funds as well as to re-arm for another war against Poland. In the 1420s, Grand Master [[Paul von Rusdorf]] brought stability to the Order and its relations, but fighting with Poland resumed in 1431, when the Knight's invasion into Poland during the [[Lithuanian Civil War (1431–1435)|Lithuanian Civil War]] sparked another [[Polish–Teutonic War (1431–1435)|Polish-Teutonic conflict]]. 

== Establishment ==
After about three decades of growing discontent, the Prussian leaders (see [[Prussian estates]]) organized themselves to oppose the rule of the order more effectively. On 14 March 1440, a group of 53 nobles and clergy and 19 Prussian cities, under the leadership of the [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] cities of [[Danzig]] (Gdańsk), [[Elbing]] (Elbląg), Thorn ([[Toruń]]) and [[Königsberg]] (Królewiec), founded the Prussian Confederation in [[Marienwerder]] (Kwidzyn). Several more towns joined on 3 April, although [[Bütow]] (Bytów) did not. In Danzig, the new members signed a document&lt;ref name="Leba"/&gt; which was kept in the archives of Thorn.

After Grand Master [[Paul von Rusdorf]] died in 1441, his successor, [[Konrad von Erlichshausen]], continued to negotiate a compromise until his own death in 1449. The confederation lobbied for support against the Teutonic Order within the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. [[Ludwig von Erlichshausen]], Grand Master from 1450 to 1467, took a more aggressive stance towards the confederation. He filed a lawsuit at the court of Emperor [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich III (Frederick III)]], whose verdict of 1453 declared the confederation illegal.

==Thirteen Years' War==

In February 1454, the Prussian Confederation rose against the Teutonic Order's rule. [[Gabriel von Baysen]] and [[Johannes von Baysen]], now leading the confederation with the support of [[Jan de Jani]] and [[Mikołaj Szarlejski]], both of the [[Clan of Ostoja]], requested the protection of King Casimir IV Jagiellon of Poland. They also asked for, and received, a guarantee of their continued city rights and privileges for the nobility. 

The resulting [[Thirteen Years' War (1454–66)|Thirteen Years' War]] ended in the defeat of the Teutonic Order and the 1466 [[Second Peace of Thorn (1466)|Second Peace of Thorn]]. The Order lost control of western Prussia. As [[Royal Prussia]], it became a province of Poland, with some local rights of autonomy. [[Stibor de Poniec]] of the [[Clan of Ostoja]] become Lord of tregality of [[Malbork]]. The Teutonic Knights retained [[Ducal Prussia|eastern Prussia]], but only under the overlordship of the Polish king. The Prussian Confederation, with its members now practically divided, ceased to exist as such.

==Aftermath==

Both the Polish and Teutonic sides agreed to seek the confirmation of the Second Peace of Thorn from Emperor Frederick III and [[Pope Paul II]], but they also agreed that this confirmation would not be needed for validation of the treaty. Soon after, however, a dispute about the status of the [[Prince-Bishopric of Warmia]] started a smaller conflict called the [[War of the Priests (Poland)|War of the Priests]].

The '''Rural Party''' was a political party in the United Kingdom that was founded in 1907 as the '''Independent Agriculture Parliamentary Party''', and revived in 1923 as the Rural Party.

The purpose of the party was set out by [[Herbert Matthews (agriculturalist)|Sir Herbert Matthews]] in 1924 "to be the representation in Parliament of the rural population as country people having essentially country interests of all kinds, and not as adherents to any of the existing parties."&lt;ref name=wdp1&gt;{{cite news|title=New Political Body to Represent Rural Interests|url=http://search.findmypast.co.uk/bna/viewarticle?id=bl%2f0000264%2f19240108%2f079|accessdate=19 February 2015|work=Western Daily Press|date=8 January 1924|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The idea of a political party dedicated to rural affairs came about in 1907, when on 25 May the [[Staffordshire]] Chamber of Agriculture passed a resolution urging the Central Chamber of Agriculture to take the idea of an Independent Agricultural Parliamentary Party under serious consideration. The resolution was sent to all the agricultural chambers and was adopted by the [[Canterbury]], Lincolnshire, [[Monmouthshire]], [[Totnes]] and [[Worcestershire]] Chambers as well as the [[Chester]], [[Holderness]], Liverpool and [[Wadhurst]] Farmers' Clubs.

On 26 June 1907, the resolution formed the centre of discussion for a meeting of Secretaries of the various agricultural chambers. They concluded that they were "strongly of opinion that an Independent Agricultural Party is absolutely necessary and could be formed." On 5 November 1907 the Organisational Committee of the Central Chamber of Agriculture produced a report that concluded that they were "strongly of opinion that the value of such a party as that proposed depends far more on its absolute independence and singleness of aim than on its numerical strength, and recommend that the efforts to establish it shall at first be concentrated on those constituencies whence it would be possible to secure a thoroughly compact and reliable body."&lt;ref name="fifty" /&gt; [[Jesse Collings]] supported the report, as in his opinion Parliament was dominated by commercialism and without organisation the representation of agriculture was useless.&lt;ref name=cc&gt;{{cite news|title=An Agricultural Party in the Commons|url=http://search.findmypast.co.uk/bna/viewarticle?id=bl%2f0000518%2f19071109%2f110|accessdate=19 February 2015|work=Cheltenham Chronicle|date=9 November 1907|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Agricultural Representation Committee of the Central Chamber of Agriculture produced a similar report on the matter 5 May 1908, coming to the same conclusion that parliamentary representation was necessary. However, the opposition of a small number of members of the Central Chamber of Agriculture meant that a section of paragraph 9 of the Agricultural Representation Committee's report was deleted. This paragraph detailed how a Special Standing Committee, separate to the Chamber, would work to create an Agricultural Party. Following the deletion of this section, the resolution was passed 49 votes to 6. However, the succeeding years the resolution was all but forgotten as members of the Central Chamber of Agriculture turned their attention to national political happenings.&lt;ref name=fifty&gt;{{cite book|last1=Matthews|first1=A.H.H.|title=Fifty Years of Agricultural Politics: Being the History of the Central Chamber of Agriculture|URL=https://archive.org/details/fiftyyearsofagri00mattrich|date=1915|publisher=P.S. King &amp; Son Ltd|location=London|pages=340–348|edition=First|accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1923, the idea of an agricultural or rural political party was revived by the prominent agriculturalist [[Christopher Hatton Turnor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Rural Party|url=http://search.findmypast.co.uk/bna/viewarticle?id=bl%2f0000577%2f19231012%2f004|accessdate=19 February 2015|work=Aberdeen Journal|date=12 October 1923|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; at a meeting of the [[Grantham]] Farmers' Union.&lt;ref name=ypli&gt;{{cite news|title=Rural Party Suggested|url=http://search.findmypast.co.uk/bna/viewarticle?id=bl%2f0000687%2f19231015%2f287|accessdate=19 February 2015|work=Yorkshire Post and Leeds Intelligencer|date=15 October 1923|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; This revival was continued by [[Herbert Matthews (agriculturalist)|Sir Herbert Matthews]], Secretary of the Central Chamber of Agriculture. It was agreed that the Honorary Secretary of the Party would be Sir Herbert Matthews and the Honorary Treasurer would be Mr George Cooper, a [[Warwickshire]] farmer and agricultural writer.&lt;ref name=yep&gt;{{cite news|title=A New Rural Party|url=http://search.findmypast.co.uk/bna/viewarticle?id=bl%2f0000273%2f19240108%2f140|accessdate=19 February 2015|work=Yorkshire Evening Post|date=8 January 1924|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1924, Sir Herbert Matthews set out the parliamentary programme for the party.&lt;ref name=wmn1&gt;{{cite news|title=The Rural Party: Important New Factor in Politics|url=http://search.findmypast.co.uk/bna/viewarticle?id=bl%2f0000329%2f19240109%2f032|accessdate=19 February 2015|work=Western Morning News|date=9 January 1924|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was announced that the trustees of the party would be [[Christopher Hatton Turnor]] and Colonel C. H. Hoare, a member of a [[C. Hoare &amp; Co|well known banking family]]. The offices of the party were at Westminster Palace Gardens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Political Body to Watch Interests of Farmers and Labourers|url=http://search.findmypast.co.uk/bna/viewarticle?id=bl%2f0000753%2f19240118%2f010|accessdate=20 February 2015|work=Biggleswade Chronicle|date=18 January 1924|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition==

In January 1924, at a meeting of the [[Devon]] Farmers' Union at [[Exeter]], Mr R. R. Robbins, Vice-President of the [[National Farmers Union of England and Wales|National Farmers Union]], conducted an attack on the idea of a rural or [[agrarianism|agrarian]] party. He also disproved the suggestion that landowners, labourers and farmers should unite under a single banner, instead he preferred cooperation when necessary. He asked his audience, "Does the nation want maximum production and maximum employment, or good farming? The two things are not the same; they are essentially different. Good farming is possible without either subsidies or protection. Good farming means farming on safety first principles. It means cutting one's coat according to one's cloth. It means, under existing world conditions, diminished aggregate production and diminished employment."&lt;ref name=wmn2&gt;{{cite news|title=No Rural Party in Politics: Mr Robbins's Advice to Devon Farmers|url=http://search.findmypast.co.uk/bna/viewarticle?id=bl%2f0000329%2f19240112%2f013|accessdate=19 February 2015|work=Western Morning News|date=12 January 1924|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Samuel Phillips Huntington''' (April 18, 1927 – December 24, 2008) was an American political scientist, adviser and academic. He spent more than half a century at [[Harvard University]], where he was director of Harvard's Center for International Affairs and the [[Harvard University Professor|Albert J. Weatherhead III University Professor]]. During the [[presidency of Jimmy Carter]], Huntington was the [[White House]] Coordinator of Security Planning for the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]]. He is best known for his 1993 theory, the "[[Clash of Civilizations]]", of a post-[[Cold War]] [[New world order (politics)|new world order]]. He argued that future wars would be fought not between countries, but between cultures, and that [[Islamic extremism]] would become the biggest threat to world peace. Huntington is credited with helping to shape U.S. views on civilian-military relations, political development, and comparative government.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lewin|first1=Tamar|title=Samuel P.

==Early life and education==
Huntington was born on April 18, 1927, in [[New York City]], the son of Dorothy Sanborn (née Phillips), a short-story writer, and Richard Thomas Huntington, a publisher of hotel trade journals.&lt;ref name=Bloomberg_Hart_20071227&gt;{{Cite news|first=Dan |last=Hart|publisher=[[Bloomberg News]] |title=Samuel Huntington, Harvard Political Scientist, Dies |date=December 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/publications/pointer/journals/2009/v35n1/featured_author.html |title=POINTER - Journals - 2009 - Vol 35 No. 1 - Featured Author: Samuel P Huntington |publisher=Mindef.gov.sg |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; His grandfather was publisher [[John Sanborn Phillips]]. He graduated with distinction from [[Yale University]] at age 18, served in the [[U.S. Army]], earned his [[Master's degree]] from the [[University of Chicago]], and completed his [[Ph.D.]] at [[Harvard University]] where he began teaching at age 23.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=December 27, 2008|url=http://www.gov.harvard.edu/faculty/shuntington/ |title=Samuel Huntington, Albert J.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
He was a member of Harvard's department of government from 1950 until he was denied tenure in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article5408079.ece | location=London | work=The Times | title=Professor Samuel Huntington author of The Clash of Civilizations | date=December 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Along with [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], who had also been denied tenure, he moved to [[Columbia University]] in New York. From 1959 to 1962 he was an associate professor of government at Columbia, where he was also deputy director of their [[Institute of War and Peace Studies]]. Huntington was invited to return to Harvard with tenure in 1963 and remained there until his death. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1965.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780&amp;ndash;2010: Chapter H|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterH.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=22 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huntington and [[Warren Demian Manshel]] co-founded and co-edited ''[[Foreign Policy]]''. Huntington stayed as co-editor until 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2009/02/samuel-huntington-81-political-scientist-scholar/ |title=Samuel Huntington, 81, political scientist, scholar &amp;#124; Harvard Gazette |publisher=News.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His first major book was ''[[The Soldier and the State: The Theory and Politics of Civil-Military Relations]]'' (1957), which was highly controversial when it was published, but presently is regarded as the most influential book on American [[civil-military relations]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael C. Desch. 1998. "Soldiers, States, and Structures: The End of the Cold War and Weakening U.S. Civilian Control." Armed Forces &amp; Society. 24(3): 389&amp;ndash;405.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael C. Desch. 2001. ''Civilian Control of the Military: The Changing Security Environment''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter D. Feaver. 1996. "An American Crisis in Civilian Control and Civil-Military Relations?" ''The Tocqueville Review''. 17(1): 159.&lt;/ref&gt; He became prominent with his ''Political Order in Changing Societies'' (1968), a work that challenged the conventional opinion of [[modernization]] theorists, that economic and social progress would produce stable democracies in recently [[Decolonization|decolonized]] countries.

He also was co-author of ''[[The Crisis of Democracy: On the Governability of Democracies]]'', a report issued by the [[Trilateral Commission]] in 1976. In 1977, his friend Brzezinski &amp;ndash; who had been appointed [[National Security Adviser]] in the administration of [[Jimmy Carter]] &amp;ndash; invited him to become [[White House]] Coordinator of Security Planning for the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]]. He served in this position until the end of 1978.

Huntington continued to teach undergraduates until his retirement in 2007.

==Personal life==
He met his wife, Nancy Arkelyan, when they were working together on a speech for 1956 presidential candidate [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]]. They had two sons, Nicholas and Timothy.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;

After several years of declining health, Huntington died on December 24, 2008, at age 81 on [[Martha's Vineyard]], Massachusetts.&lt;ref name=Bloomberg_Hart_20071227/&gt;

==Notable arguments==

===''Political Order in Changing Societies''===
{{Main|Political Order in Changing Societies}}
During 1968, just as the United States' war in Vietnam was becoming most intense, Huntington published ''Political Order in Changing Societies'', which was a critique of the modernization theory which had affected much U.S. policy regarding the developing world during the prior decade.

Huntington argues that, as societies modernize, they become more complex and disordered. If the process of social modernization that produces this disorder is not matched by a process of political and institutional modernization—a process which produces political institutions capable of managing the stress of modernization—the result may be violence.

During the 1970s, Huntington was an advisor to governments, both democratic and dictatorial. During 1972, he met with [[Emílio Garrastazu Médici|Medici]] government representatives in Brazil; a year later he published the report "Approaches to Political Decompression", warning against the risks of a too-rapid political liberalization, proposing graduated liberalization, and a strong party state modeled upon the image of the Mexican [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] (PRI). After a prolonged transition, Brazil became democratic during 1985.

During the 1980s, he became a valued adviser to the South African regime, which used his ideas on political order to craft its "total strategy" to reform apartheid and suppress growing resistance.  He assured South Africa's rulers that increasing the repressive power of the state (which at that time included police violence, detention without trial, and torture) can be necessary to effect reform. The reform process, he told his South African audience, often requires "duplicity, deceit, faulty assumptions and purposeful blindness."  He thus gave his imprimatur  to his hosts' project of "reforming" apartheid rather than eliminating it.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Lelyveld, Move Your Shadow (New York, 1985), 68-9; Shula Marks and Stanley Trapido, "South Africa Since 1976: an historical perspective," in Shaun Johnson, ed., South Africa: No Turning Back (London, 1988), 28-9&lt;/ref&gt;

Huntington frequently cited Brazil as a success, alluding to his role in his 1988 presidential address to the [[American Political Science Association]], commenting that political science ''played a modest role in this process''. Critics, such as British political scientist Alan Hooper, note that contemporary Brazil has an especially unstable party system, wherein the best institutionalized party, [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]]'s [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]] emerged in opposition to controlled-transition. Moreover, Hooper claims that the lack of civil participation in contemporary Brazil results from that top-down process of political participation transitions.

===''The Third Wave''===
In his 1991 book, ''[[The Third Wave: Democratization in the Late Twentieth Century]]'', Huntington made the argument that beginning with Portugal's revolution during 1974, there has been a [[Third Wave Democracy|third wave of democratization]] which describes a global trend which includes more than 60 countries throughout Europe, Latin America, Asia, and Africa which have undergone some form of democratic transition. Huntington won the 1992 [[University of Louisville]] [[Grawemeyer Award]] for this book.&lt;ref name=grawemeyer.org&gt;{{cite web|title=1992- Samuel Huntington, Herman Daly and John Cobb|url=http://grawemeyer.org/worldorder/previous-winners/1992-samuel-huntington-herman-daly-and-john-cobb.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202231546/http://grawemeyer.org/worldorder/previous-winners/1992-samuel-huntington-herman-daly-and-john-cobb.html|archivedate=2013-12-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="The Clash of Civilizations"===
{{details|Clash of Civilizations}}
[[File:Clash of Civilizations mapn2.png|thumb|right|300px|Map of the nine "civilizations" from Huntington's "Clash of Civilizations."]]
During 1993, Huntington provoked great debate among [[international relations]] theorists with the interrogatively-titled "The Clash of Civilizations?", an influential, oft-cited article published in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' magazine. In the article, he argued that, after the fall of the Soviet Union, Islam would become the biggest obstacle to Western domination of the world. The West's next big war therefore, he said, would inevitably be with Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Haruna, Mohammed|date=26 September 2001|title=Nigeria: September 11 And Huntington's Prophecy|newspaper=Daily Trust|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200109270278.html|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its description of post-Cold War [[geopolitics]] and the "inevitability of instability" contrasted with the influential [[The End of History and the Last Man|End of History]] thesis advocated by [[Francis Fukuyama]].

Huntington expanded "The Clash of Civilizations?" to book length and published it as ''[[The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order]]'' in 1996. The article and the book posit that post-Cold War conflict would most frequently and violently occur because of cultural rather than ideological differences. That, whilst in the Cold War, conflict occurred between the Capitalist West and the Communist Bloc East, it now was most likely to occur between the world's major civilizations—identifying seven, and a possible eighth: (i) Western, (ii) Latin American, (iii) Islamic, (iv) Sinic (Chinese), (v) Hindu, (vi) Orthodox, (vii) Japanese, and (viii) African. This cultural organization contrasts the contemporary world with the classical notion of sovereign states. To understand current and future conflict, cultural rifts must be understood, and culture—rather than the State—must be accepted as the reason for war. Thus, Western nations will lose predominance if they fail to recognize the irreconcilable nature of cultural tensions. Huntington argued that this post-Cold War shift in geopolitical organization and structure requires the West to strengthen itself culturally, by abandoning the imposition of its ideal of democratic universalism and its incessant military interventionism. Underscoring this point, Huntington wrote in the 1996 expansion, "In the emerging world of ethnic conflict and civilizational clash, Western belief in the universality of Western culture suffers three problems: it is false; it is immoral; and it is dangerous."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://contemporarythinkers.org/samuel-huntington/|title=A Guide to the Work of Samuel Huntington|publisher=contemporarythinkers.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The identification of Western Civilization with the [[Western Christianity]] (Catholic-Protestant) was not Huntington's original idea, it was rather the traditional Western opinion and subdivision before the Cold War era.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Harrison (historian)|]], [http://www.abc.net.au/religion/articles/2018/01/17/4790945.htm An Eccentric Tradition: The Paradox of 'Western Values']&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics (for example articles in ''[[Le Monde Diplomatique]]'') call ''The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order'' the theoretical legitimization of American-caused Western aggression against China and the world's Islamic and Orthodox cultures. Other critics argue that Huntington's taxonomy is simplistic and arbitrary, and does not take account of the internal dynamics and partisan tensions within civilizations. Furthermore, critics argue that Huntington neglects ideological mobilization by elites and unfulfilled socioeconomic needs of the population as the real causal factors driving conflict, that he ignores conflicts that do not fit well with the civilizational borders identified by him, and they charge that his new paradigm is nothing but [[Realism (international relations)|realist]] thinking in which "states" became replaced by "civilizations".&lt;ref&gt;see Richard E. Rubenstein and Jarle Crocker (1994): Challenging Huntington, in: Foreign Policy, No. 96 (Autumn, 1994), pp. 113–28&lt;/ref&gt; Huntington's influence upon U.S. policy has been likened to that of British historian [[Arnold J. Toynbee|Arnold Toynbee]]'s controversial religious theories about Asian leaders during the early twentieth century.

The ''[[New York Times]]'' obituary on Samuel Huntington notes, however, that his "emphasis on ancient religious empires, as opposed to states or ethnicities, [as sources of global conflict] gained...more cachet after the [[September 11 attacks|Sept. 11 attacks]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/27/samuel-huntington-foreign-policy-theorist-dies-at-81/ Samuel P. Huntington of Harvard Dies at 81], The New York Times, December 27, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Huntington wrote that [[Ukraine]] might divide along the cultural line between the more Catholic [[western Ukraine]] and Orthodox [[eastern Ukraine]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
While a statist approach highlights the possibility of a Russian-Ukrainian war, a civilizational approach minimizes that and instead highlights the possibility of Ukraine splitting in half, a separation which cultural factors would lead one to predict might be more violent than [[Dissolution of Czechoslovakia|that of Czechoslovakia]] but far less bloody than [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|that of Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.eurotrib.com/story/2014/3/1/204/17909 Testing Huntington in Ukraine]". European Tribune.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Who Are We'' and immigration===
Huntington's last book, ''[[Who Are We? The Challenges to America's National Identity]]'', was published during May 2004. Its subject is the meaning of American [[national identity]] and the possible cultural threat posed to it by large-scale [[Latino]] [[immigration]], which Huntington warns could "divide the United States into two peoples, two [[culture]]s, and two [[language]]s".

===Other===
Huntington is credited with inventing the phrase ''[[Davos Man]]'', referring to [[global elite]]s who "have little need for national loyalty, view national boundaries as obstacles that thankfully are vanishing, and see national governments as residues from the past whose only useful function is to facilitate the elite's global operations". The phrase refers to the [[World Economic Forum]] in [[Davos]], Switzerland, where leaders of the [[economic globalization|global economy]] meet.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/comment/story/0,,1404411,00.html Davos man's death wish], ''The Guardian'', 3 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s, the [[South African apartheid]] government of [[P.W. Botha]] became increasingly preoccupied with security. On Huntington's advice, Botha's government established a powerful state security apparatus to "protect" the state against an anticipated upsurge in political violence that the reforms were expected to cause. The 1980s became a period of considerable political unrest, with the government becoming increasingly dominated by Botha's circle of generals and police chiefs (known as securocrats), who managed the various States of Emergencies.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;Fox, William; Fourie, Marius; Van Wyk, Belinda (1998). Police Management in South Africa. Juta and Company Limited. p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Academy of Sciences controversy==
In 1986, Huntington was nominated for membership to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]]. The entire academy voted on the nomination, although many scientists were unfamiliar with the nominee. Professor [[Serge Lang]], a [[Yale University]] [[mathematician]], disturbed this electoral status quo by challenging Huntington's nomination. Lang campaigned for others to deny Huntington membership, and eventually succeeded; Huntington was twice nominated and twice rejected. A detailed description of these events was published by Lang in "Academia, Journalism, and Politics: A Case Study: The Huntington Case" which occupies the first 222 pages of his 1998 book ''Challenges''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Challenges|author=[[Serge Lang]]|year=1999|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0avTrkyT1VcC&amp;pg=PA560&amp;dq=%22A+case+study%22+intitle:Challenges+inauthor:Serge+inauthor:Lang#PPP10,M1C|isbn=9780387948614}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lang was inspired by the writings of mathematician [[Neal Koblitz]], who accused Huntington of misusing mathematics and engaging in [[pseudo-science]]. Lang claimed that Huntington distorted the historical record and used pseudo-mathematics to make his conclusions seem convincing. As an example he used Huntington's 1968 book ''Political Order in Changing Societies'', in which Huntington argued that South Africa was a "satisfied society" in the 1960s.  Lang didn't believe the conclusion, so he looked at how Huntington justified this claim and concluded that he used a method which was simply not valid. Lang suspected that he was using false pseudo-mathematical argument to give arguments that he wanted to justify greater authority. It was, said Lang, "a type of language which gives the illusion of science without any of its substance." Lang documents his accusations in his book ''Challenges''.

Huntington’s supporters included [[Herbert A. Simon]], a 1978 laureate of the [[Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel]]. The ''[[Mathematical Intelligencer]]'' offered Simon and Koblitz an opportunity to engage in a written debate, which they accepted.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}{{clarify|date=September 2018|reason=Did the debate happen?

Huntington's prominence as a Harvard professor and (as then) director of Harvard's Center for International Affairs led to significant coverage of his defeated nomination to the NAS by the media, including ''The New York Times'' and ''The New Republic''.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

[[File:Justice Antonin Scalia on Separation of Powers and Checks and Balances.webm|thumb|250px|[[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] testified before the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]] about [[separation of powers]] and checks and balances of the U.S. Government]]
'''Separation of powers''' is a [[Politics|political]] [[doctrine]] originating  in the writings of [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu]] in ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]'', in which he argued for a constitutional government with three separate branches, each of which would have defined abilities to check the powers of the others. This philosophy heavily influenced the writing of the United States Constitution, according to which the [[legislature|Legislative]], [[executive (government)|Executive]], and [[judiciary|Judicial]] branches of the United States [[government]] are kept distinct in order to prevent abuse of power. This United States form of [[separation of powers]] is associated with a system of '''checks and balances'''.

During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], [[philosopher]]s such as [[Montesquieu]] advocated the principle in their writings, whereas others, such as [[Thomas Hobbes]], strongly opposed it. [[Baron Montesquieu|Montesquieu]] was one of the foremost supporters of separating the legislature, the executive, and the judiciary. His writings considerably influenced the opinions of the framers of the [[United States Constitution]].

Strict separation of powers did not operate in the [[United Kingdom]], the political structure of which served in most instances as a model for the government created by the U.S. Constitution.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Some U.S. states did not observe a strict separation of powers in the 18th century. In [[New Jersey]], the Governor also functioned as a member of the state's highest court and as the presiding officer of one house of the [[New Jersey Legislature]]. The [[List of Governors of Delaware|President of Delaware]] was a member of the Court of Appeals; the presiding officers of the two houses of the state legislature also served in the executive department as [[List of Vice Presidents of the United States|Vice Presidents]]. In both [[Delaware]] and [[Pennsylvania]], members of the executive council served at the same time as judges. On the other hand, many southern states explicitly required separation of powers. [[Maryland]], [[Virginia]], [[North Carolina]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] all kept the branches of government "separate and distinct."

==Legislative power==
[[File:Seal of the United States Congress.svg|right|100px]]
[[United States Congress|Congress]] has the sole power to [[Legislature|legislate]] for the United States. Under the [[nondelegation doctrine]], Congress may not delegate its lawmaking responsibilities to any other agency. In this vein, the Supreme Court held in the 1998 case ''[[Clinton v. The city of New York]]'' that Congress could not delegate a "[[line-item veto]]" to the President, by powers vested in the government by the Constitution.

Where Congress does not make great and sweeping delegations of its authority, the Supreme Court has been less stringent. One of the earliest cases involving the exact limits of non-delegation was ''[[Wayman v. Southard]]'' 23 U.S. (10 Wet.) 1, 42 (1825). Congress had delegated to the courts the power to prescribe judicial procedure; it was contended that Congress had thereby unconstitutionally clothed the judiciary with legislative powers. While [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[John Marshall]] conceded that the determination of rules of procedure was a legislative function, he distinguished between "important" subjects and mere details. Marshall wrote that "a general provision may be made, and power is given to those who are to act under such general provisions, to fill up the details."

Marshall's words and future court decisions gave Congress much latitude in delegating powers. It was not until the 1930s that the Supreme Court held a delegation of authority unconstitutional. In a case involving the creation of the National Recovery Administration called ''[[A.L.A. Schechtes]]'', 295 U.S. 495 (1935), Congress could not authorize the president to formulate codes of "fair competition." It was held that Congress must set some standards governing the actions of executive officers. The Court, however, has deemed that phrases such as "just and reasonable," "public interest" and "public convenience" suffice.

==Executive power==
[[File:Seal of the President of the United States.svg|right|100px]]
[[Executive (government)|Executive power]] is vested, with exceptions and qualifications,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpoaccess.gov/constitutioicle Two, Section 1.]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[President of the United States|President]]. By law (Section 2.) the president becomes the Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy, Militia of several states when called into service, has power to make treaties and appointments to office "with the Advice and Consent of the Senate," receive Ambassadors and Public Ministers, and "take care that the laws be faithfully executed" (Section 3.) By using these words, the Constitution does not require the president to personally enforce the law; rather, officers subordinate to the president may perform such duties. The Constitution empowers the president to ensure the faithful execution of the laws made by Congress and approved by the President. Congress may itself terminate such appointments, by [[impeachment]], and restrict the president. Bodies such as the [[War Claims Commission]] (created by the [[War Claims Act of 1948]]), the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] ,and the [[Federal Trade Commission]]—all [[Quasi-judicial body|quasi-judicial]]—often have direct Congressional oversight.

Congress often writes legislation to restrain executive officials to the performance of their duties, as laid out by the laws Congress passes. In ''[[Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Chadha]]'' (1983), the Supreme Court decided (a) The prescription for legislative action in Art. I, § 1—requiring all legislative powers to be vested in a Congress consisting of a Senate and a House of Representatives—and § 7—requiring every bill passed by the House and Senate, before becoming law, to be presented to the president, and, if he disapproves, to be repassed by two-thirds of the Senate and House—represents the Framers' decision that the legislative power of the Federal Government be exercised in accord with a single, finely wrought and exhaustively considered procedure. This procedure is an integral part of the constitutional design for the separation of powers. Further rulings clarified the case; even both Houses acting together cannot override Executive vetos without a {{frac|2|3}} majority. Legislation may always prescribe regulations governing executive officers.

==Judicial power==
[[File:Seal of the United States Supreme Court.svg|right|100px]]
{{See also|Article I and Article III tribunals|Judiciary of the United States|Jurisdiction stripping}}

[[Judiciary|Judicial power]]—the power to decide cases and controversies—is vested in the [[US Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] and inferior courts established by Congress. The judges must be appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the Senate, hold office during good behavior and receive compensations that may not be diminished during their continuance in office. If a court's judges do not have such attributes, the court may not exercise the judicial power of the United States. Courts exercising the judicial power are called "constitutional courts."

Congress may establish "legislative courts," which do not take the form of judicial agencies or commissions, whose members do not have the same security of tenure or compensation as the constitutional court judges. Legislative courts may not exercise the judicial power of the United States. In ''[[Murray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land &amp; Improvement Co.]]'' (1856), the Supreme Court held that a legislative court may not decide "a suit at the [[common law]], or in [[Equity (law)|equity]], or [[admiralty law|admiralty]]," as such a suit is inherently judicial. Legislative courts may only adjudicate "public rights" questions (cases between the government and an individual and political determinations).

===Executive===
The president exercises a check over Congress through his power to veto bills, but Congress may override any veto (excluding the so-called "[[pocket veto]]") by a two-thirds majority in each house. When the two houses of Congress cannot agree on a date for adjournment, the president may settle the dispute. Either house or both houses may be called into emergency session by the president. The [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] serves as president of the Senate, but he may only vote to break a tie.

The president, as noted above, appoints judges with the Senate's advice and consent.  He also has the power to issue [[pardon|pardons and reprieve]]s.  Such pardons are not subject to confirmation by either the House of Representatives or the Senate, or even to acceptance by the recipient.  The President is not mandated to carry out the orders of the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court does not have any enforcement power; the enforcement power lies solely with the executive branch.  Thus, the executive branch can place a check on the Supreme Court through refusal to execute the orders of the court.  For example,  in ''[[Worcester v. Georgia]]'', President Jackson refused to execute the orders of the Supreme Court.

The president is the civilian Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States. He has the authority to command them to take appropriate military action in the event of a sudden crisis.&lt;ref&gt;''Campbell v. Clinton'', 203 F.3d 19 (D.C. Cir. 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; However, only the Congress is explicitly granted the power to declare war per se, as well as to raise, fund and maintain the armed forces. Congress also has the duty and authority to prescribe the laws and regulations under which the armed forces operate, such as the [[UCMJ|Uniform Code of Military Justice]], and requires that all [[General (United States)|Generals]] and [[Admiral (United States)|Admirals]] appointed by the president be confirmed by a majority vote of the Senate before they can assume their office.

===Judicial===
Courts check both the executive branch and the legislative branch through [[Judicial review in the United States|judicial review]]. This concept is not written into the Constitution, but was envisioned by many of the Constitution's Framers (for example, ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'' mention it). The Supreme Court established a precedent for judicial review in ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]''. There were protests by some at this decision, born chiefly of political expediency, but political realities in the particular case paradoxically restrained opposing views from asserting themselves. For this reason, precedent alone established the principle that a court may strike down a law it deems unconstitutional.

A common misperception is that the Supreme Court is the only court that may determine constitutionality; the power is exercised even by the inferior courts. But only Supreme Court decisions are binding across the nation. Decisions of a [[United States court of appeals|Court of Appeals]], for instance, are binding only in the circuit over which the court has jurisdiction.

The power to review the constitutionality of laws may be limited by Congress, which has the power to set the jurisdiction of the courts. The only constitutional limit on Congress' power to set the jurisdiction of the judiciary relates to the Supreme Court; the Supreme Court may exercise only appellate jurisdiction except in cases involving states and cases affecting foreign ambassadors, ministers or consuls.

The [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] presides in the Senate during a president's impeachment trial. The rules of the Senate, however, generally do not grant much authority to the presiding officer. Thus, the Chief Justice's role in this regard is a limited one.




McCulloch v. Maryland, decided in 1819, established two important principles. One of which explains that states cannot make actions to impede on valid constitutional exercises of power by the federal government. The other explains that Congress has the implied powers to implement the express powers written in the Constitution to create a functional national government. All three branches of the US government have certain powers and those powers relate to the other branches of government. One of these powers is called the express powers. These powers are expressly given, in the Constitution, to each branch of government. Another power is the implied powers. These powers are those that are necessary to perform expressed powers. There are also inherent and concurrent powers. Inherent powers are those that are not found in the Constitution yet the different branches of government can still exercise them.  Concurrent powers are those that are given to both state and federal governments. There are also powers that are not lined out in the Constitution that are given to the federal government. These powers are then given to the states in a system called federalism. 


Congress is one of the branches of government so it has a lot of powers of its own that it uses to pass laws and establish regulations. These include express, implied, and concurrent powers. It uses its express powers to regulate bankruptcies, business between states and other nations, the armed forces, and the National Guard or militia. They also establish all laws necessary and proper for carrying out other powers. In addition to this Congress makes laws for naturalization. Implied powers are used to keep the regulation of taxes, the draft, immigration, protection of those with disabilities, minimum wage, and outlaw discrimination. Congress’s inherent powers are used to control national borders, deal with foreign affairs, acquire new territories, defend the state from revolution, and decide the exclusion or establishment of aliens. Concurrent powers makes it so that both federal and state governments can create laws, deal with environmental protection, maintain national parks and prisons, and provide a police force. 


The judicial branch of government holds powers as well. They have the ability to use express and concurrent powers to make laws and establish regulations. They use express powers to interpret laws and perform judicial review. Implied powers are used by this branch to declare laws that were previously passed by a lower court unconstitutional. They can also use express powers to declare laws that are in the process of being passed unconstitutional. Concurrent powers are used to make it so that state courts can conduct trials and interpret laws without the approval of federal courts and federal courts can hear appeals form lower state courts. 


The executive branch also has powers of its own that they use to make laws and establish regulations. The powers that are used in this branch are express, implied, and inherent. The President uses express powers to approve and veto bills and to make treaties as well. The President is constitutionally obligated to make sure that laws are faithfully executed and uses their powers to do just this. He uses implied powers to issue executive orders and enter into treaties with foreign nations. The executive branch uses inherent powers to establish executive privilege, which means that they can enforce statutes and laws already passed by Congress. They can also enforce the Constitution and treaties that were previously made by other branches of government. 


	The system of checks and balances makes it so that no one branch of government has more power than another and cannot overthrow another. It creates a balance of power that is necessary for a government to function, if it is to function well. This, in most situations, makes it so that each branch is held to a certain standard of conduct. If a branch of the government thinks that what another branch is doing is unconstitutional, they can “call them out” so to say. Each branch is able to look at the other branches wrong doing and change it to meet the needs of the people whom they serve. Humans as a whole have a history of abusing positions of power but the system of checks and balances makes it so much more difficult to do so. Also the fact that there is more than one person running each branch gives room for debate and discussion before decisions are made within a single branch. Even so, some laws have been made and then retracted because of the fact that they were an abuse of the power given to that particular branch. The people that created these laws had been serving a selfish agenda when forming these laws instead of looking out for the welfare of those people that they were supposed to be protecting by making certain laws. While this is a horrible scenario, it does happen. That does not mean that it cannot be fixed though. Indeed it can be, by another branch of government stepping up to right the wrongs that had been done. 

		
	The federal government is fully capable to intervene in affairs of Native Americans on reservations to some extent. Their ability to create and enforce treaties makes it so that they can interact with the Native Americans and build a treaty that works for both parties and make reservations for the Native Americans to live on and make it so that the people that would live on the reservation not be interrupted by the outside world and be able to live their lives as they please. This responsibility also falls on to the states as well. This happens because the federal government is the one that creates the treaties but the reservations are then put in the jurisdiction of the states. The states are then responsible for maintaining the relationships with the Native Americans on those reservations and to honor the treaties that were previously made by the federal government.

==Equality of the branches==
{{original research section|date=February 2015}}
The Constitution does not explicitly indicate the pre-eminence of any particular branch of government. However, [[James Madison]] wrote in [[Federalist Papers|Federalist]] 51, regarding the ability of each branch to defend itself from actions by the others, that "it is not possible to give to each department an equal power of self-defense. In republican government, the legislative authority necessarily predominates."

One may claim that the judiciary has historically been the weakest of the three branches. In fact, its power to exercise judicial review—its sole meaningful check on the other two branches—is not explicitly granted by the [[United States Constitution|U.S Constitution]]. The [[U.S. Supreme Court]] exercised its power to strike down congressional acts as unconstitutional only twice prior to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]: in ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'' (1803) and ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' (1857). The Supreme Court has since then made more extensive use of judicial review.

Throughout America's history dominance of one of the three branches has essentially been a see-saw struggle between Congress and the president. Both have had periods of great power and weakness such as immediately after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] when republicans had a majority in Congress and were able to pass major legislation and shoot down most of the president's vetoes. They also passed acts to essentially make the president subordinate to Congress, such as the [[Tenure of Office Act (1867)|Tenure of Office Act]]. Johnson's later impeachment also cost the presidency much political power. However the president has also exercised greater power largely during the 20th century. [[Roosevelt family|Both Roosevelts]] greatly expanded the powers of the president and wielded great power during their terms.

The first six presidents of the United States did not make extensive use of the veto power: [[George Washington]] only vetoed two bills, [[James Monroe]] one, and [[John Adams]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[John Quincy Adams]] none. James Madison, a firm believer in a strong executive, vetoed seven bills. None of the first six Presidents, however, used the veto to direct national policy. It was [[Andrew Jackson]], the seventh President, who was the first to use the veto as a political weapon. During his two terms in office, he vetoed 12 bills—more than all of his predecessors combined. Furthermore, he defied the Supreme Court in enforcing the policy of ethnically cleansing Native American tribes ("Indian Removal"); he stated (perhaps apocryphally), "[[John Marshall]] has made his decision. Now let him enforce it!"

Some of Jackson's successors made no use of the veto power, while others used it intermittently. It was only after the Civil War that presidents began to use the power to truly counterbalance Congress. [[Andrew Johnson]], a Democrat, vetoed several [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] bills passed by the "Radical Republicans." Congress, however, managed to override fifteen of Johnson's twenty-nine vetoes. Furthermore, it attempted to curb the power of the presidency by passing the [[Tenure of Office Act (1867)|Tenure of Office Act]]. The Act required Senate approval for the dismissal of senior Cabinet officials. When Johnson deliberately violated the Act, which he felt was unconstitutional (Supreme Court decisions later vindicated such a position), the House of Representatives impeached him; he was acquitted in the Senate by one vote.

[[File:Anders Leonard Zorn - Grover Cleveland - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Grover Cleveland]] worked to restore power to the Presidency after [[Andrew Johnson]]'s impeachment.]]

Johnson's impeachment was perceived to have done great damage to the presidency, which came to be almost subordinate to Congress. Some believed that the president would become a mere figurehead, with the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House of Representatives]] becoming a ''de facto'' [[prime minister]]. [[Grover Cleveland]], the first Democratic President following Johnson, attempted to restore the power of his office. During his first term, he vetoed over 400 bills—twice as many bills as his 21 predecessors combined. He also began to suspend bureaucrats who were appointed as a result of the [[patronage]] system, replacing them with more "deserving" individuals. The Senate, however, refused to confirm many new nominations, instead demanding that Cleveland turn over the confidential records relating to the suspensions. Cleveland steadfastly refused, asserting, "These suspensions are my executive acts ... I am not responsible to the Senate, and I am unwilling to submit my actions to them for judgment." Cleveland's popular support forced the Senate to back down and confirm the nominees. Furthermore, Congress finally repealed the controversial Tenure of Office Act that had been passed during the Johnson Administration. Overall, this meant that Cleveland's Administration marked the end of presidential subordination.

Several 20th-century presidents have attempted to greatly expand the power of the presidency. [[Theodore Roosevelt]], for instance, claimed that the president was permitted to do whatever was not explicitly prohibited by the law—in direct contrast to his immediate successor, [[William Howard Taft]]. [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] held considerable power during the [[Great Depression]]. Congress had granted Franklin Roosevelt sweeping authority; in ''[[Panama Refining v. Ryan]]'', the Court for the first time struck down a Congressional delegation of power as violative of the doctrine of separation of powers. The aforementioned ''[[Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States]]'', another separation of powers case, was also decided during Franklin Roosevelt's presidency. In response to many unfavorable Supreme Court decisions, Roosevelt introduced a [[Judiciary Reorganization Bill of 1937|"Court Packing"]] plan, under which more seats would be added to the Supreme Court for the president to fill. Such a plan (which was defeated in Congress) would have seriously undermined the judiciary's independence and power.

[[Richard Nixon]] used [[national security]] as a basis for his expansion of power. He asserted, for example, that "the inherent power of the President to safeguard the security of the nation" authorized him to order a wiretap without a judge's warrant. Nixon also asserted that "[[executive privilege]]" shielded him from all legislative oversight; furthermore, he [[Impoundment of appropriated funds|impounded federal funds]] (that is to say, he refused to spend money that Congress had appropriated for government programs). In the specific cases aforementioned, however, the Supreme Court ruled against Nixon. This was also because of an ongoing criminal investigation into the [[Watergate]] tapes, even though they acknowledged the general need for executive privilege. Since then, Nixon's successors have sometimes asserted that they may act in the interests of national security or that executive privilege shields them from Congressional oversight. Though such claims have in general been more limited than Nixon's, one may still conclude that the presidency's power has been greatly augmented since the 18th and 19th centuries.

==Views on separation of powers==
Many [[political science|political scientists]] believe that separation of powers is a decisive factor in what they see as a limited degree of [[American exceptionalism]]. In particular, [[John W. Kingdon]] made this argument, claiming that separation of powers contributed to the development of a unique political structure in the United States. He attributes the unusually large number of [[interest group]]s active in the United States, in part, to the separation of powers; it gives groups more places to try to influence, and creates more potential group activity. He also cites its complexity as one of the reasons for lower citizen participation.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

==Judicial independence==
Separation of powers has again become a current issue of some controversy concerning debates about [[judicial independence]] and political efforts to increase the accountability of judges for the quality of their work, avoiding conflicts of interest, and charges that some judges allegedly disregard procedural rules, statutes, and higher court precedents.

Many legislators hold the view that separation of powers means that powers are shared among different branches; no one branch may act unilaterally on issues (other than perhaps minor questions), but must obtain some form of agreement across branches. That is, it is argued that "checks and balances" apply to the Judicial branch as well as to the other branches—for example, in the regulation of attorneys and judges, and the establishment by Congress of rules for the conduct of federal courts, and by state legislatures for state courts. Although in practice these matters are delegated to the Supreme Court, the Congress holds these powers and delegates them to the Supreme Court only for convenience in light of the Supreme Court's expertise, but can withdraw that delegation at any time.

On the other side of this debate, many judges hold the view that separation of powers means that the Judiciary is independent and untouchable within the judicial sphere. In this view, separation of powers means that the Judiciary alone holds all powers relative to the judicial function and that the Legislative and Executive branches may not interfere in any aspect of the Judicial branch. An example of the second view at the state level is found in the Florida Supreme Court holding that only the Florida Supreme Court may license and regulate attorneys appearing before the courts of Florida, and only the Florida Supreme Court may set rules for procedures in the Florida courts.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} The State of New Hampshire also follows this system.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

'''Sodium aluminosilicate''' refers to compounds which contain [[sodium]], [[aluminium]], [[silicon]] and [[oxygen]], and which  may also contain water. These include synthetic [[amorphous sodium aluminosilicate]], a few naturally occurring minerals and synthetic [[zeolite]]s. Synthetic amorphous sodium aluminosilicate is widely used as a food additive, [[E number|E-554]].

== Amorphous sodium aluminosilicate ==
This substance is produced with a wide range of compositions and has many different applications. It is encountered as an additive [[E number|E-554]] in food where it acts as an [[anticaking agent|anticaking]] (free flow) agent. As it is manufactured with a range of compositions it is not strictly a chemical compound with a fixed [[stoichiometry]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chem.unep.ch/irptc/sids/oecdsids/Silicates.pdf United Nations Environment Programme] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331011523/http://www.chem.unep.ch/irptc/sids/oecdsids/Silicates.pdf |date=2010-03-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One supplier quotes a typical analysis for one of their products as 14SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;·Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O·3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O,(Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;32&lt;/sub&gt;·3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rhodia-silicas.com/markets/datasheets/T17.pdf Solvay link no longer works]&lt;/ref&gt;

The FDA has as of April 1, 2012 approved ''sodium aluminosilicate (sodium silicoaluminate)'' for direct contact with consumable items under 21 CFR 182.2727.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sec. 182.2727 Sodium aluminosilicate.|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=182.2727|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=10 December 2012|date=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sodium aluminosilicate is used as [[molecular sieve]] in medicinal containers to keep contents dry and as [[food additive]] having E-number E-554 (anti-caking agents).

Sodium aluminosilicate may also be listed as:
* aluminium sodium salt
* sodium silicoaluminate
* aluminosilicic acid, sodium salt
* sodium aluminium silicate
* aluminum sodium silicate
* sodium silico aluminate
* sasil

== Minerals sometimes called sodium aluminosilicate ==
Naturally occurring minerals that are sometimes given the chemical name, sodium aluminosilicate include [[albite]] (NaAlSi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, an end-member of the [[plagioclase]] series) and [[jadeite]] (NaAlSi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;).

==Synthetic zeolites sometimes called sodium aluminosilicate==
Synthetic zeolites have complex structures and examples (with structural formulae) are:

*Na&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;48&lt;/sub&gt;·27H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, zeolite A (Linde type A sodium form, NaA), used in laundry detergents&lt;ref name = "dyer"&gt;Alan Dyer, (1994),''Encyclopedia of Inorganic Chemistry'', ed R.

{{italic title}}
The '''''Sonderaktion'' 1005''' ({{lang-en|Special Action 1005}}), also called '''''Aktion'' 1005''', or ''Enterdungsaktion'' ({{lang-en|Exhumation Action}}) began in May 1942 during World War II to hide any evidence that people had been murdered by [[Nazi Germany]] in ''[[Aktion Reinhard]]'' in [[General Government|occupied Poland]]. The operation, which was conducted in strict secrecy from 1942–1944, used prisoners to [[exhume]] mass graves and burn the bodies. These work groups were officially called ''Leichenkommandos'' ("corpse units") and were all part of ''[[Sonderkommando]]'' 1005; inmates were often put in chains in order to prevent escape.

In May 1943, the operation moved into occupied territories in Eastern and Central Europe to destroy evidence of the [[Final Solution]]. ''Sonderaktion 1005'' was used to conceal the evidence of massacres committed by ''[[SS]]-[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' Nazi death squads that had massacred millions of people including 1.3 million [[Jews]] according to Historian [[Raul Hilberg]], as well as [[Romani people|Roma]] and [[Slav|local civilians]]. The ''Aktion'' was overseen by selected squads from the ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' and ''[[Ordnungspolizei]]''.

==Operations==
In March 1942, ''[[SS]]-[[Obergruppenführer]]'' [[Reinhard Heydrich]] placed ''SS-[[Standartenführer]]'' [[Paul Blobel]] in charge of the ''Aktion'' 1005, though its start was delayed after Heydrich was assassinated in June 1942. It was after the end of June that ''SS-[[Gruppenführer]]'' [[Heinrich Müller (Gestapo)|Heinrich Müller]], head of the [[Gestapo]] finally gave Blobel his orders.&lt;ref name=Arad_1984/&gt; While the principal aim was to erase evidence of Jewish exterminations, the ''Aktion'' would also include non-Jewish victims of Nazi ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]''.&lt;ref name = Arad_1984&gt;{{Citation |first=Yitzhak |last=Arad |authorlink=Yitzhak Arad |contribution=Operation Reinhard: Extermination Camps of Belzec, Sobibor and Treblinka |contribution-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318073143/http://www1.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/Microsoft%20Word%20-%203576.pdf |title=Yad Vashem Studies&amp;nbsp;XVI |year=1984 |pages=205&amp;ndash;239 (26/30 of current document) |format=Internet Archive |quote=The Attempt to Remove Traces.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blobel began his work experimenting at [[Chełmno extermination camp|Chełmno]] (Kulmhof). Attempts to use [[incendiary bombs]] to destroy exhumed bodies were unsuccessful as the weapons set fire to nearby forests. The most effective way was eventually found to be giant [[pyre]]s on iron grills. The method involved building alternating layers of corpses and firewood on railway tracks. Afterwards remaining bone fragments could be crushed by pounding with heavy dowels or in a grinding machine and then re-buried in pits.&lt;ref name=Arad_1984/&gt; The operation officially began at [[Sobibór extermination camp]]. The ''Leichenkommando'' exhumed the bodies from mass graves around the camp and then burned them, after which task the workers were executed. The process then moved to [[Bełżec extermination camp|Bełżec]] in November 1942.&lt;ref name="nizkor.org"/&gt; The [[Auschwitz]] and [[Majdanek concentration camp|Majdanek]] camps had [[Cremation#World War II|crematoria with furnace rooms]] on site to dispose of the bodies, therefore the ''Aktion'' 1005 commandos were not needed there.&lt;ref name=Arad_1984/&gt; Surplus corpses were burned by their own prisoners ''(pictured)''.&lt;ref name="Berenbaum"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mub823JQrdUC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=snippet&amp;q=pyres&amp;f=false | title=Anatomy of the Auschwitz Death Camp | publisher=Indiana University Press | ISBN=025320884X | date=1998 | accessdate=30 August 2015 | author=[[Yisrael Gutman]], [[Michael Berenbaum]] | pages=161–163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The semi-industrial incineration of corpses at the [[Treblinka extermination camp]] began as soon as the political danger associated with the earlier burials was realized. In 1943, the 22,000 Polish victims of the Soviet [[Katyn massacre]] were discovered near [[Smolensk]] in Russia and reported to Adolf Hitler.&lt;ref name="Davies98"&gt;{{Citation |ref=harv |last=Davies |first=Norman |authorlink=Norman Davies |year=1998 |title=Europe: A History (internal link) |titlelink=Europe: A History |publisher=HarperCollins |isbn=0-06-097468-0 |format=also at [https://books.google.com/books?id=vD7SWb5lXBAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Davies,+Norman+(1998),+Europe:+A+History&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LF-7Uq-iEoTboASQjYKgBw&amp;ved=0CEwQuwUwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Davies%2C%20Norman%20(1998)%2C%20Europe%3A%20A%20History&amp;f=false Google Books preview]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their remains were well preserved underground, attesting to the Soviet mass murder.

The operation also returned to the scenes of earlier mass killings such as [[Babi Yar]], [[Ponary massacre|Ponary]], the [[Ninth Fort]],&lt;ref name=Arad_1984/&gt; as well as [[Bronna Góra]].&lt;ref&gt;AŻIH, [http://www.sztetl.org.pl/en/article/bronna-gora/13,sites-of-martyrdom/23737,bronna-gora-bronnaja-gora-miejsce-masowych-egzekucji/ Bronna Góra (Bronnaja Gora).] Sites of Martyrdom. [[Museum of the History of Polish Jews]] ''[[Virtual Shtetl]]'' 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1944, with Soviet armies advancing, ''SS-Obergruppenführer'' [[Wilhelm Koppe]], head of the ''[[Reichsgau Wartheland]]'' ordered that each of the five districts of [[General Government]] territory set up its own Aktion 1005 commando to begin "cleaning" mass graves. The operations were not entirely successful as the advancing Soviet troops reached some of the sites before they could be cleared.&lt;ref name=Arad_1984/&gt;

==The aftermath==
At the [[Nuremberg Trials]] after World War II, a deputy of [[Adolf Eichmann]], ''SS-[[Hauptsturmführer]]'' [[Dieter Wisliceny]] gave the following testimony regarding ''Aktion'' 1005.&lt;ref name="Stein"/&gt;
{{quote|In November 1942, in Eichmann's office in Berlin, I met Standartenfuehrer Plobel {{sic}}, who was leader of Kommando 1005, which was specially assigned to remove all traces of the final solution of the Jewish problem by ''Einsatz'' Groups and all other executions. Kommando 1005 operated from at least autumn 1942 to September 1944 and was all this period subordinated to Eichmann. The mission was constituted after it first became apparent that Germany would not be able to hold all the territory occupied in the East and it was considered necessary to remove all traces of the criminal executions that had been committed. While in Berlin in November 1942, Plobel {{sic}} gave a lecture before Eichmann's staff of specialists on the Jewish question from the occupied territories. He spoke of the special incinerators he had personally constructed for use in the work of Kommando 1005. It was their particular assignment to open the graves and remove and cremate the bodies of persons who had been previously executed. Kommando 1005 operated in Russia, Poland and through the Baltic area. I again saw Plobel {{sic}} in Hungary in 1944 and he stated to Eichmann in my presence that the mission of Kommando 1005 had been completed. &lt;small&gt;&amp;mdash; ''SS-Hauptsturmführer'' [[Dieter Wisliceny]]&lt;/small&gt; &lt;ref name="Stein"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070810065326/http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/genocide/Wisliceny.htm Prof. Stuart Stein: "Affidavit of Dieter Wisliceny", from ''Nazi Conspiracy and Aggression'', Volume VIII. USGPO, Washington, 1946, pages 606–619.] ''Note:'' ''SS-Hauptsturmführer'' [[Dieter Wisliceny]] in his testimony given before the International Military Tribunal at Nurnberg, 3 January 1946, erroneously identifies the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] complex as the concentration area Sosnowitz (which was one of its dozens of subcamps).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Image:Paul Blobel.jpg|right|thumb|upright|''SS-Standartenführer'' [[Paul Blobel]], beard grown in prison]]

Blobel was sentenced to death by the U.S. [[Nuremberg Military Tribunal]] in the [[Einsatzgruppen Trial|''Einsatzgruppen'' Trial]]. He was hanged at [[Landsberg Prison]] on June 8, 1951. Nearly 60,000 deaths are attributable to Blobel though during testimony at Nuremberg he alleged he only killed between 10,000–15,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,814963,00.html ''Case Closed'', Time Magazine, Jun. 18, 1951]&lt;/ref&gt;

The prosecution at the trial of [[Adolf Eichmann]] in 1961 attempted to prove that Eichmann was Blobel's superior, but the court did not accept it.

'''''The Soldier and the State: The Theory and Politics of Civil-Military Relations''''' is a 1957 book written by [[political scientist]] [[Samuel P. Huntington]]. In the book, Huntington advances the theory of objective [[civilian control of the military|civilian control]], according to which the optimal means of asserting control over the [[armed forces]] is to professionalize them. This is in contrast to subjective control, which involves placing legal and institutional restrictions on the military's autonomy.  [[Edward M. Coffman]] has written that "[a]nyone seriously interested in American military history has to come to terms with Samuel P. Huntington's ''The Soldier and the State."&lt;ref name=coffman&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Long Shadow of The Soldier and the State|author=Edward M. Coffman|pages=69–82|journal=The Journal of Military History|volume=55|number=1|date=January 1991|jstor=1986129|doi=10.2307/1986129}}{{paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outline Summary==
{{Original research|date=May 2009}}

===Part I: “Military Institutions and the State: Theoretical and Historical Perspectives”===

In the first chapter titled "Officership as a Profession", Huntington immediately states his thesis of the book. The purpose is to describe how the "modern officer corps is a professional body and the modern officer a professional man."&lt;ref&gt;Huntington, S. (1981). The Soldier and the State: The Theory and Politics of Civil-Military Relations. New York, NY: Belknap Press. Page 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, "Officership as a Profession", Huntington defines qualities of a [[profession]] and argues that the officer corps conforms to this definition. The qualities of a profession are (1) Expertise, (2) Responsibility, and (3) Corporateness.&lt;ref&gt;Huntington, S. (1981). The Soldier and the State: The Theory and Politics of Civil-Military Relations. New York, NY: Belknap Press. Page 8-10. &lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the [[Officer (armed forces)|officer corps]] display specialized knowledge in the management of violence, maintains a monopoly on education and advancement in their field, and have an overarching responsibility to the society they serve and thus do not 'compete' in the open market. The military profession requires comprehensive study and training, and thus expertise, of an intellectual set of skills: organizing of forces, planning of activities, and executing and directing activities.&lt;ref&gt;Huntington, S. (1981). The Soldier and the State: The Theory and Politics of Civil-Military Relations. New York, NY: Belknap Press. Page 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The military expertise, the management of violence, includes the science of war and combat as well as organizational and administrative skills. The specializations of the military profession expands far and wide since there are engineers, pilots, mechanics, ordinance experts, and more. Huntington argues this 'professional ethic'  differentiates 'officers' from amateur groups engaged in violence (reservists, mercenaries, technical specialists, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Huntington, Samuel. The Soldier and the State: The Theory and Politics of Civil-Military Relations. New York: Belknap Press, 1957. pg 11&lt;/ref&gt; Huntington stresses that 'professionalism' entails a mutually binding relationship between society and its 'professionals.' The military profession requires that military officers fulfill its duties to its country by compliance with political officials running the state and government. It is the responsibility of the military to provide the public good of common defense since it acts as an agent to the principal government and citizenry. However, each step up in the hierarchy within the military profession demands more responsibility and skill because they are authorized to make more strategic decisions. In the case of the officer corps, officers are entrusted with evaluating the security of the state and providing expert advice to its leaders, and society in turn must afford a measure of deference to their professional expertise and institutions. (Huntington highlights the fact that the [[President of the United States|President]] cannot usurp the [[Military organization|military hierarchy]] and appoint a [[lieutenant]] to serve on the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]]).&lt;ref&gt;Huntington, Samuel. The Soldier and the State: The Theory and Politics of Civil-Military Relations. New York: Belknap Press, 1957. pg 14-15&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally Huntington argues the officership displays a decidedly 'corporate character' as the officers  tend to:  live apart from general society, delineate hierarchy by specific uniforms and insignia, and maintain a strict separation (within the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]) from lay people who merely 'administer violence' ([[Reservist|reservists]]).&lt;ref&gt;Huntington, Samuel. The Soldier and the State: The Theory and Politics of Civil-Military Relations. New York: Belknap Press, 1957. pg 16&lt;/ref&gt; Corporateness refers to the distinct and unique features specific to a profession that which separate it from other professions. Entrance to the profession is restricted with high standards and fulfillment, military academia, and ranks.

Chapter two outlines the “rise of the military profession in Western society.” He describes that the officer corps consisted of mercenaries from the breakdown of feudalism until their replacement by aristocratic officers after the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–1648) and why neither the mercenaries nor aristocrats were professionals under his definition. Finally in the 19th century the idea of the aristocratic military genius was replaced by the [[Prussianism|Prussian]] reliance upon “average men succeeding by superior education, organization and experience.”  &lt;ref&gt;pg. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter three discusses the military mind and military professional ethic. He notes misconceptions regarding the military mind and seeks "to elaborate the professional military ethic with respect to (1) basic values and perspectives, (2) national military policy, (3) the relation of the military to the state." &lt;ref&gt;pg. 62&lt;/ref&gt;  He summarizes the ethic as "conservative realism....It exalts obedience as the highest virtue of military men. The military ethic is thus pessimistic, collectivist, historically inclined, power-oriented, nationalistic, militaristic, pacifist, and instrumentalist in its view of the military profession." &lt;ref&gt;pg. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter four is a discussion of civil-military relations in theory. He defines subjective civilian control (where military professionalism is reduced due to co-opting of the military by civilian political groups) and objective civilian control - where military professional thrives as it is far removed from politics. He describes the effect of four ideologies (liberalism, [[fascism]], [[Marxism]], conservatism) on military professionalism and civilian control.

Chapter five analyzes the military professional in the German and Japanese societies where it became dominant as [[militarism]]. He states that, "no country has had a wider variety of experiences in civil-military relations than modern Germany", with its officer corps achieving unmatched "high standards of professionalism" and then being "completely prostituted" under [[Nazism]].&lt;ref name="pg. 98"&gt;pg. 98&lt;/ref&gt;  He details the varying situations of the [[German Empire|imperial]], World War I, [[Weimar Republic|republican]], and Nazi periods. In contrast,  "Japanese civil-military relations remained in a single relatively stable pattern from 1868 to 1945" where the "military played a persistently active role in the politics of their country." &lt;ref name="pg. 98"/&gt;  He argues that "in both countries the disruption of the civil-military balance reflected more basic constitutional disorders" and "that disruption helped undermine the nation's security: distorting the perspective and judgment of soldiers and statesmen." &lt;ref&gt;pg. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part II: “Military Power in America: The Historical Experience: 1789-1940”===

Chapter six describes the military in the traditional liberal American political context in four sections: liberalism and the Constitution as historical constants of American civil-military relations, the prevalence of liberalism in the U.S., the liberal approach to military affairs, and the military hero in liberal politics. He details how "the American liberal approach to military affairs was hostile, static and dominant; the conservative approach of the Federalists and the South sympathetic, constructive and thwarted." &lt;ref&gt;pg. 147&lt;/ref&gt; The elements of American liberalism which influenced international relations "were (1) its indifference to international affairs, (2) its application of domestic solutions to international affairs, and (3) its search for objectivity in international affairs." &lt;ref&gt;pg. 149&lt;/ref&gt; He also states that "the United States, by virtue of its noninvolvement in the balance of power was able to pursue foreign policy objectives defined in terms of universal ideals rather than in terms of national interests." &lt;ref&gt;151&lt;/ref&gt; He discusses the "hostile image of the military profession" and "liberal military policy". He argues that the non-professional military hero was traditionally welcomed in liberal America while the professional military hero was generally not successful politically.

Chapter seven explains the structure of civil-military relations provided by the conservative U.S. constitution and civil control of the military.

Chapter eight outlines the American military tradition up to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].

Chapter nine is “The Creation of the American Military Profession”. It outlines the contributions of key individuals and institutions and describes the origins of the American military mind.

Chapter ten covers the period 1890 to 1920, including “Neo-Hamiltonism”, [[Alfred Mahan]] and [[Leonard Wood]].

Chapter eleven covers interwar civil-military relations and the military ethic of the period.

===Part III: “The Crisis of American Civil-Military Relations 1940-1955”===

Chapter twelve covers World War II.

Chapter thirteen outlines civil-military relations in the first decade after World War II.

Chapter fourteen is “The Political Roles of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff|Joint Chiefs]].”

Chapter fifteen describes the impact of the separation of powers on civil-military relations during the [[Cold War]].

Chapter sixteen analyzes the Cold War structure of the Defense Department in the context of civil-military relations.

Chapter seventeen discusses the challenges faced by the heightened ongoing defense needs of the Cold War versus the tradition of American liberalism and the move “Towards a New Equilibrium” between the two.

'''''Tropico 4''''' is a [[Simulator]] [[video game]] that combines [[City-building game|city management]] and [[Government simulation game|political manipulation]].&lt;ref name="IGN-review"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gallegos |first1=Anthony |title=Tropico 4 Review |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/09/13/tropico-4-review |website=IGN |publisher=Ziff Davis, LLC |accessdate=28 October 2018 |date=13 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was developed by [[Haemimont Games]] and published by [[Kalypso Media]]. Like the first and third games in the series, it centers on a customizable main character titled "El Presidente" – the dictator who runs the island [[banana republic]]. The [[Mac OS X]] version of the game ('''''Tropico 4: Gold Edition''''', which includes the Modern Times expansion pack) was released by [[Feral Interactive]] on July 25, 2013,&lt;ref name="feralinteractive.com"/&gt; as well as [[DLC (video gaming)|DLC]] packs ''Dash for Growth'' and ''Captain of Industry''. DLC pack ''State of Emergency'' was released by Feral on April 3, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.feralinteractive.com/en/news/417/&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tropico 4'' includes added support for Facebook and Twitter.&lt;ref name="GS-review"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Todd |first1=Brett |title=Tropico 4 Review |url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tropico-4-review/1900-6332461/ |website=GameSpot |publisher=CBS Interactive Inc |accessdate=28 October 2018 |date=2 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==Gameplay==

The game has 10 preconfigured maps, but the player can make their own island by choosing "Random Island". Upon choosing a random island, a player may customize the size of the island, vegetation, mineral deposits, and elevation, as well as other game parameters. There are various expansion packs which will also give access to more islands. &lt;!--Note that the map editor don't seems to be available on Xbox360 versions.(Correct me if I'm wrong)--&gt;

After choosing the island, the player may choose an avatar, or they can make their own avatar. In customize characters, players may choose: gender, costumes, skin tone, hat, hairstyle, accessories, mustache, beard, earrings, traits, quality, and rise to power. After completing one mission, the character's current traits will level up.

As El Presidente, the player can see in every citizen's needs, happiness, skills, thoughts and political ideology. The demands of Tropicans include food, health, leisure, and faith. These are fulfilled by erecting specific buildings, for example: If the citizens demand leisure the player must try to build a pub, restaurant, movie theater, or some other form of entertainment.  Each individual citizen has a unique set of characteristics that influences their motivation, priorities and actions.

A citizen unable to satisfy their needs will become unhappy and may protest peacefully, become a criminal or join the rebels. Individual protesters negatively affect nearby citizens' respect for El Presidente, potentially influencing the next election; the player loses the game if El Presidente loses an election.  As a group, rebels will periodically attack and attempt to destroy buildings; if they destroy the palace, the game is lost. Palace guards and an army are needed to defend against rebel attacks. 

There are a variety of factions in Tropico as well, each influencing the player's strategy. Tropicans join factions in different ways: some will fanatically support one faction, some are less fanatical but remain loyal, some switch sides according to situation, and some do not prefer to join certain factions or any faction at all. Appealing to the factions' needs is crucial to keeping the population under control and avoiding being overthrown, be it by a coup d'état or by losing one of the elections held occasionally. However, some factions' policies and demands conflict with those of others.

=== Campaign ===
The game's campaign consists of 20 missions spread over 10 different maps. They start out with the player character, "El Presidente," having seized control of the island of Tropico. Imports can be monitored as well as exports (whereas the previous games in the series only allowed for coverage on exports). ''Tropico 4'' includes more superpowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2010/08/13/tropico-4-announced.aspx|title=Tropico 4 Announced}}&lt;/ref&gt; A council of ministers exists with which the player can consult on a range of different issues. The player will have to deal with natural disasters and the demands of different political factions each with its own ideological outlook.

The game has a variety of humorous elements including running satirical commentary by fictional radio station Tropico News Today, and subtle touches such as liaisons between priests and cabaret girls. The "loading" and "saving" screens have quotes from various dictators, leaders, politicians, and revolutionaries such as [[Che Guevara]], [[Fidel Castro]], [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Karl Marx]], [[John F. Kennedy]], [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], [[Augusto Pinochet]], [[Nikita Khrushchev]], [[Leon Trotsky]], [[Mobutu Sese Seko]], [[Todor Zhivkov]], [[Vladimir Putin]], [[Josip Broz Tito]], [[Muammar Gaddafi]], [[Ferdinand Marcos]], [[Imelda Marcos]] and [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]]. It, like its predecessors, features a Latin soundtrack, this time drawn mainly from the albums ''Elementos'' and ''Oñejo'' by Alex Torres and His Orchestra.

=== Factions ===
Capitalists are the wealthy and enterprising people of the island. Naturally, their agenda pits them against the communists. They respect a low crime rate, charging for housing, and having a diverse and competitive economy. They are led by Antonio Lopez, a wealthy opportunist who promotes the sale of dangerous products and even sells firearms to the rebels for a quick buck. If the Capitalists' demands are not being met, they will resort to thievery to make money and will steal a portion of all income.

Communists are the largest faction more concerned about the quality of housing and healthcare on the island. Comrade Vasquez, their leader, is an eccentric who frequently spouts communist slogans. In the event that the Communists become upset, rebels from Cuba will begin to infiltrate your island and fight against your regime.

Intellectuals are more progressive, contrary to the more conservative Religious faction and the Spartan Militarists. They are led by Miss Pineapple, who is also el Presidente's lover and a cabaret dancer. The Intellectuals prefer edicts that benefit the educational sector, and are easily agitated by some others, especially book burning, which will drive them away. Upsetting the Intellectuals will cause student protests, making it so no Tropicans graduate from High Schools or Colleges.

The Religious are a conservative Catholic faction led by Reverend Estaban, a drunkard who uses rum during his sermons to worship God. They are very concerned about faith among Tropicans, and building churches and cathedrals increase their influence. If the Religious faction is upset, priests and bishops will speak against you, spreading dissent among any who attend sermons on the island.

Militarists are interested in the defense of Tropico. They are quite sizeable, and lack of support might result in rebellions, terrorist attacks or invasions. General Rodriguez leads the militarists. The militarists are mostly detractors of the intellectuals, and are thus mostly illiterate. Low wages for soldiers may cause the Militarists to stage a coup.

Environmentalists strive to preserve the natural beauty of Tropico. Led by the [[hippie]] Sunny Flowers, an anchorwoman and conspiracy theorist, they oppose any efforts to scar the environment, even for economic purposes like logging and mining, and thus are opponents of the Capitalists. Passing anti-pollution laws appeases them. If not appeased, Environmentalists will attempt to blockade your industrial buildings.

Nationalists are in charge of caring for and preserving the Tropican people and their customs. They generally oppose immigrants, who, according to leader el Diablo, a violent  [[skinhead]], take lucrative jobs away from Tropicans. They will oppose any foreign-friendly policies and are at loggerheads with Communists and Capitalists. When ignored, Nationalists will start riots on the island. These riots quickly escalate into battles between Tropicans and immigrants.

Loyalists are a faction who are always loyal to el Presidente. They are led by El Presidente's personal advisor, Penultimo. Most of their members have below average intelligence and have been brainwashed with all the propaganda beautifying el Presidente. They will never rebel; in return they demand that el Presidente act like a "true leader," shun democracy, and cultivate his image through facilities such as a museum dedicated to el Presidente's childhood.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Commented out: [[File:Tropico Flag.svg|thumb|left|The flag of the fictitious country Tropico]] --&gt;
The game follows the protagonist, El Presidente, as he works towards restoring the power that he lost in the Caribbean after averting a [[nuclear war]] perpetrated by the US vice president in order to rise to power. It is divided into three acts:

El Presidente arrives at his new island where he begins his goal to build an ideal nation for his people. To do so, he focuses his administration on several islands, developing the economic potential of each one, until he is ousted from power after being framed for the murder of the current US president. He is then forced to flee his country and heads off to other parts of Tropico.

Forced to take a new identity and flee his republic, El Presidente begins his revenge by establishing a base of power at Isla Oscura. There El Presidente learns that he was victim of a conspiracy involving Keith Preston, the CEO of Fruitas Inc. (a parody of the [[United Fruit Company]]), the rebel leader Marco Moreno (a parody of [[Che Guevara]]), UN Inspector Brunhilde Van Hoof (a parody of [[Margaret Thatcher]]) and his former mentor Generalissimo Santana (a parody of [[Fidel Castro]]). After enacting his revenge on the conspirators and clearing his name, El Presidente regains his position as rightful ruler of Tropico.

Reinstated into power, El Presidente focuses on rebuilding his nation, until his former enemies reappear and sell him information about the true mastermind behind his downfall, the US Vice President Nick Richards (a parody of [[Richard Nixon]]), who had the US president killed to assume his place. Around this time, [[perestroika]] hits the USSR and Tropico offers their assistance to the nation in exchange for evidence incriminating Nick Richards that leads to his demise. El Presidente then puts the final touches to make Tropico a powerful and prosperous nation.

==Development==
The game was announced in the middle of August 2010 in a press release by publisher Kalypso Media. ''Tropico 4'' was released on both Xbox 360 and PC, as was predecessor ''[[Tropico 3]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tim Freund |url=http://www.tropico3.com/ |title=World of Tropico |publisher=Tropico3.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike its predecessors, ''Tropico 4'' can be played through the Onlive platform.

===Expansion===
An expansion, titled ''Modern Times'', was released on March 27, 2012. It features a new single-player campaign which takes place a year after the events of Tropico 4.&lt;ref name=g4/&gt; After El Presidente's success in rebuilding Tropico, he leaves on a well deserved vacation, only to find when he returns that his lackey Penultimo has predictably run the entire nation into the ground amid the [[2008 economic crisis]]. While working to put the country back on track, El Presidente crosses paths with the elusive shadow organization "The Conclave," and it's up to him to help save the world again while lining his pockets.

''Modern Times'' also adds a timeline element, where real-world historical events affect gameplay.  In addition, new buildings are introduced in accordance to the timeline.

On December 15, the first of many DLC packs was released, titled ''Junta''. Since then, several more DLC packs have been released, including ''Plantador'', ''Quick Dry Cement'', ''Pirate Heaven'', ''Megalopolis'', ''Vigilante'', ''Voodoo'', ''Propaganda!'', ''The Academy'' and the most recent DLC, ''Apocalypse''. Each DLC pack includes new buildings, a new island, a new mission, a new trait, and, depending on the DLC, new clothing options for El Presidente and new decor. The DLC ''Modern Times'' also modernizes the gameplay adding in events and such which would have happened slightly earlier or during the present day.&lt;ref name=g4&gt;{{cite web|author=Leah Jackson |url=http://www.g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/post/721322/tropico-4-modern-times-expansion-pack-release-date-and-details-announced/ |title=Tropico 4: Modern Times Expansion Pack Release Date And Details Announced |publisher=[[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] |date=2012-03-01 |accessdate=2013-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''United Farmers of Alberta''' ('''UFA''') is an association of [[Alberta]] farmers that has served different roles in its 100-year history – as a lobby group, a successful political party, and as a farm-supply retail chain. As a political party, it formed the [[government of Alberta]] from 1921 to 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abheritage.ca/abpolitics/people/influ_farmers.html |title=United Farmers of Alberta |website=Alberta Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Heritage Community Foundation |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/2217/20101208163110/http://www.abheritage.ca/abpolitics/people/influ_farmers.html |archivedate=December 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1935, it has primarily been an [[agricultural supply cooperative]] headquartered in [[Calgary, Alberta]]. {{As of|2017}}, UFA operates 35 farm and ranch supply stores in Alberta,{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} over 110 fuel stations in [[British Columbia]], Alberta and [[Saskatchewan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ufa.com/petroleum/Pages/default.aspx |title=Petroleum – UFA Co-operative Ltd. |website=UFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 25 outdoor adventure [[sporting goods]] stores in [[Western Canada]] and the [[Pacific Northwest]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

== Founding as lobby group ==
UFA was founded in 1909 as a government [[lobbying|lobby]] group following a merger between the [[Alberta Farmers' Association]] and Alberta branches of the Canadian Society for Equity. The UFA began as a non-partisan organization whose aim was to be a lobby group promoting the interest of farmers in the province. In 1913, under president [[William John Tregillus]], the UFA successfully pressured Alberta's [[Alberta Liberal Party|Liberal]] government to organize the [[Alberta Farmers' Cooperative Elevator Company]] (AFCEC), which joined with other Prairie elevator companies to eventually become the [[United Grain Growers]].
Tregillus was the first president of the AFCEC.

The UFA was a believer in the co-operative movement and supported [[women's suffrage]]. In 1912 women founded the parallel United Farm Women of Alberta, and in 1914, women were granted full membership rights in UFA itself.

By 1920, UFA had become the most influential lobby group in Alberta with over 30,000 registered members.

===Entry into politics===
Under pressure of losing influence to the upstart [[Alberta Non-Partisan League]] – which ran in four rural constituencies in the [[Alberta general election, 1917|1917 provincial election]], winning two – and dissatisfied with the existing political parties, UFA entered the political arena in 1919. Some prominent UFA members (including its president, [[Henry Wise Wood]]) at first opposed entering into direct politics, as opposed to lobbying, however, because they thought abandoning the UFA's non-partisan policy would cause the UFA to break up.

In 1919, the UFA won a by-election in the [[Cochrane (provincial electoral district)|Cochrane constituency]]. In 1921, [[Robert Gardiner (Canadian politician)|Robert Gardiner]] won a seat in a federal by-election, becoming UFA's first Member of Parliament. 
Encouraged by this, UFA ran in 45 of Alberta's 61 ridings in the [[Alberta general election, 1921|1921 provincial election]]. To the surprise of nearly everyone, including themselves, UFA took 38 seats in the election, winning a majority government, and sweeping the [[Liberal Party of Alberta|Liberals]] out of power after almost 16 years. UFA and Progressive party candidates also captured all but two of the Alberta federal seats in the [[Canadian federal election, 1921|1921 federal election]] (the other two were taken by Labour candidates).

===Majority governments===
As was the case with other United Farmer governments in [[Manitoba]] and [[Ontario]], the UFA was elected unexpectedly and without a leader. To form its cabinet it went outside the Legislature to recruit a [[Premier]], as did the other United Farmer governments. The UFA even approached Liberal leader [[Charles Stewart (Canadian politician)|Charles Stewart]] to remain as premier. Stewart declined, however, not wanting to lead the assembly as a member of the opposition. UFA President [[Henry Wise Wood]] also declined, and Vice-President [[Percival Baker]], an elected MLA, died 24 hours after the election. Ultimately, UFA executive member [[Herbert Greenfield]] was named the first UFA Premier. Among his cabinet were [[Irene Parlby]], the second female cabinet minister in the British Empire, and Calgary [[Labour Party (Canada)|Labour Party]] MLA [[Alex Ross (politician)|Alex Ross]] as Minister of Public Works.

The United Farmers government initiated several reforms, including improving medical care, broadening labour rights and making the tax system fairer. It made good on its promise of electoral reform, bringing in a measure of [[proportional representation]] through the [[Single transferable vote|STV]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book |last=Monto |first=Tom |date=2012 |title=Protest and Progress, Three Labour Radicals in Early Edmonton |publisher=Crang Publishing, Alhambra Books |location=Edmonton |isbn=9781895097122}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923, the government formed the [[Alberta Wheat Pool]] and upset some of its support base by ending [[Prohibition in Canada|Prohibition]], replacing it with open sale of alcohol through government-owned liquor stores and carefully regulated beer parlours, and refusing to establish a provincial bank, a bank owned by the provincial government, despite UFA conventions calling for it.

In 1925, [[John Edward Brownlee|John E. Brownlee]], who was already widely believed to be the "true" leader of the United Farmers, succeeded Greenfield as Premier. Brownlee led the party to a second majority government in the [[Alberta general election, 1926|1926 election]].

In 1929, after years of negotiating, Brownlee gained control over Alberta's natural resources. This was a right other provinces were granted at [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] or upon entry into Confederation, but which Alberta and Saskatchewan were denied when they became provinces in 1905, instead receiving a yearly cash subsidy from the federal government. This deal would later become a critical factor in Alberta's economic success as the province's oil deposits were exploited.

Riding a wave of popularity resulting from this agreement, Brownlee led the United Farmers to a third majority government in the [[Alberta general election, 1930|1930 election]], despite alienating socialists and labour groups as he led the party in a conservative fashion, and despite the quickly deteriorating financial conditions.

===Decline===
The [[Great Depression]] had a critical impact on the United Farmers' fortunes, as the crash in grain prices and simultaneous drought in southern Alberta hurt its support base, farmers. The government, with reduced tax revenue, engaged in cuts in services, staff and wages. The province was in debt after the grandiose spending of the relatively prosperous 1920s. The government also bailed out the hard-pressed [[Alberta Wheat Pool]] in 1929. Banks were repossessing the farms of many farmers who were unable to pay off their loans and interest when grain prices were lower than the cost of production. The governments` Liberal and Conservative opponents grew louder and they hoped to become popular. At the same time, however, the government faced opposition from socialists calling for more interventionist anti-capitalist policies and for radical monetary reform. The latter stance was supported by [[William Aberhart]]'s [[Social Credit Party of Alberta|Social Credit]] movement, which in 1933–35 grew to a potent force among the province's farmers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Henry Wise Wood retired as president of the UFA, more-radical-minded UFA MP [[Robert Gardiner (politician)|Robert Gardiner]], a member of the [[Ginger Group]] became president; the UFA conventions passed increased calls for strong government measures to address the province's widespread poverty; the UFA joined with the [[Canadian Labour Party]] and other political groups to help found the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]], the first Canada-wide farmer/labour political party (other than the revolutionary [[Communist Party of Canada]]). Premier Brownlee on more than one occasion opposed the UFA's leftward slide. The final blow for Brownlee occurred when he was caught up in a [[John Brownlee sex scandal|sex scandal]] as he was accused of seducing a young clerk working in the Attorney General's office. Brownlee resigned in disgrace in July 1934.

[[Richard G. Reid]] succeeded Brownlee as Premier, however with many voters jumping to the new [[Social Credit Party of Alberta|Social Credit Party]], the United Farmers' fall in politics was as rapid as its rise. The party was wiped off the political map in the [[Alberta general election, 1935|1935 election]], losing all of its seats and tallying only 11 percent of the vote.

Of the nine UFA MPs elected in the [[Canadian federal election, 1930|1930 federal election]], eight joined the [[Cooperative Commonwealth Federation]] after it was formed in 1932. All eight ran as CCF candidates in the [[Canadian federal election, 1935|1935 federal election]] and were defeated by a Social Credit landslide. The ninth UFA MP, [[William Thomas Lucas]] of [[Camrose (electoral district)|Camrose]], ran as a [[Conservative Party of Canada (historic)|Conservative]] and was also defeated by the Socreds.

Two years after the UFA government was defeated, the organization withdrew from electoral politics.&lt;ref name=ccf&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abheritage.ca/abpolitics/events/party_nd.html |title=Co-operative Commonwealth Federation |website=Alberta Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Heritage Community Foundation |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/2217/20101208163136/http://www.abheritage.ca/abpolitics/events/party_nd.html |archivedate=December 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938, the CCF committed itself to run candidates in the next provincial and elections, setting up local riding clubs for that purpose.&lt;ref name=ccf/&gt; In 1939, UFA officially disbanded its political arm, still continuing as a farmers supply co-operative. Many of the left-wing members of the UFA organization joined the CCF, though that party would not win the support of most former UFA voters. Many right-wing and centrist members of the UFA joined the [[Independent Citizen's Association|Alberta Unity Movement]], an attempt to form a coalition between United Farmers, Liberals and Conservatives to defeat Social Credit in the [[Alberta general election, 1940|1940 provincial election]].

The CCF was folded into the [[New Democratic Party]] in 1961. Its [[Alberta New Democratic Party|Alberta wing]] claims the Alberta CCF's history as its own, thus making it a linear descendant of the UFA.

==Federal politics==
The United Farmers of Alberta ran candidates in several federal elections in alignment with, but usually to the left of, the [[Progressive Party of Canada]] with a number of UFA MPs sitting in the House of Commons with the [[Ginger Group]] of left wing MPs.

Following Robert Gardiner's election in a federal by-election prior to the 1921 election, Alberta farmer ran 14 candidates (some as UFA, some as Progressive Party candidates) in the 1921 federal election, not running in two Calgary ridings where strong Labour candidates carried the farmer-worker banner. All the UFA candidates (and the two Calgary Labour candidates) were elected, the incumbent Liberal MPs and Conservative contenders not getting one seat. In 1926, the province's Progressive MPs ran for re-election as UFA candidates. Eight of the UFA's 9 remaining MPs joined the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] when it was formed in 1932. All eight ran as CCF candidates in the [[Canadian federal election, 1935|1935 federal election]] and were defeated. The ninth, [[William Thomas Lucas]], ran as a Conservative in 1935 and was also defeated by the Social Credit landslide that were elections in Alberta that year.

==The modern cooperative==
Following the dissolution of its political wing, UFA focused on its commercial operations. UFA entered into a partnership with '''Maple Leaf Fuels''', a subsidiary of [[Imperial Oil]] in 1935 to distribute fuel to its members. The next year it began to open retail stations under the Maple Leaf brand across the province.

The first farm supply store opened in Calgary in 1954, and a second in [[Edmonton]] in 1957. That same year, UFA bought the assets of Maple Leaf Fuels, giving the co-op greater control over the business.

In 1984, UFA opened its first [[cardlock]] [[fuel]] [[retail agent|agency]] in Calgary. Today, UFA has over 100 cardlock facilities across three provinces and was the largest cardlock network in Alberta.

UFA has over 120,000 members and with 2007 revenues of over $1.8 billion, UFA is ranked as the 37th largest business in Alberta by revenue according to Alberta Venture magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.albertaventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/v100_08.pdf |title=The Venture 100 |date=September 2008 |website=Alberta Venture |publisher=Venture Publishing Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2009, UFA purchased Wholesale Sports in western Canada, and 15 [[Sportsman's Warehouse]] locations throughout the Northwest United States, which it then re-branded as Wholesale Sports.

'''''When Smuts Goes''''' is a [[dystopia]]n novel by Dr. [[Arthur Keppel-Jones]]. The novel is [[Setting (narrative)|set]] during a [[future history]] of [[South Africa]], following the ascension of [[National Party (South Africa)|Afrikaner nationalist]]s and their increasingly destructive quest for total [[Apartheid in South Africa|''apartheid'']]. It foreshadowed the fall of [[Jan Christiaan Smuts]] and his [[United Party (South Africa)|United Party]] administration, a rupture in ties with the [[British Commonwealth]], and the declaration of a Second [[South African Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,854382,00.html|title="These Things Happen"|date=June 7, 1948|publisher=Time Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Presiding over the regime which follows is Obadja Bult, a [[Dominion Theology|dominion theologian]] influenced by the ideals of the former ''[[Ossewabrandwag]]''. His blunt authoritarian streak gives spark to racial conflict—culminating in foreign [[Interventionism (politics)|intervention]] and troubled [[majority rule]].

==Background==

As [[World War II]] draws to a close, white politics in the [[Union of South Africa]] are glaringly polarised - reflecting the struggle between [[Daniel Malan]]'s [[Herenigde Nasionale Party|Reunited National Party]], whose followers demand a republic, and the [[United Party (South Africa)|United Party]] of [[Jan Smuts]], who wish to retain their British monarch. Smuts' outstanding electoral victory in 1943 is fast becoming a distant memory; the Nationalists have consolidated by 1948 and go on to win [[Calvinia]], [[Potchefstroom]], [[Springs, Gauteng|Springs]], and [[Caledon, Western Cape|Caledon]]. 

United Prime Minister Oudstryder dissolves parliament in 1952, the tercentenary of [[Jan van Riebeeck]]'s landing at the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. His Nationalist rivals take advantage of the occasion, organising a massive pageant in [[Cape Town]]. Speeches, processions, and gatherings mushroom at famous battlefields. British imperialism is decried as the national enemy. A wave of [[Afrikaner]] patriotism rocks South Africa as the polls are opened: Oudstryder and his pro-English colleagues are doomed. The triumphant Nationalists return 83 seats against the United Party's 56, securing a majority in every province but [[Natal Province|Natal]].

==Accuracy of predictions==

The book correctly predicted the end of the long tenure in power of the [[United Party (South Africa)|United Party]] of [[Jan Smuts]] and the rise to power of the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]], followed by a rupture with the [[British Commonwealth]] and the proclamation of a second "[[South African Republic]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,854382,00.html|title="These Things Happen"|date=June 7, 1948|publisher=Time Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Keppel-Jones' prediction, however, the National Party institutes a totalitarian [[fascist]]-style dictatorship and completely suppresses all dissent—to a far greater degree than the actual [[apartheid]] government was to implement even in its most repressive phases.

Keppel-Jones further predicts a mass exodus of [[British diaspora in Africa|South Africa's British diaspora]]; an uprising led by the [[Zulu people|Zulus]], which is suppressed with much bloodshed; a constant state of overt and guerrilla warfare; a totally intransigent attitude by the [[Afrikaner]] leadership leading to increasing tensions with the rest of the world, culminating with an international military intervention—which leads to the toppling of the regime, followed by the killing or expulsion of the remaining white population, much of it migrating to [[Argentina]]; and an economic collapse and social degeneration, with the inexperienced and incompetent new government proving unable to maintain the political and economic structures which were handed over to them by the international community.

Researcher [[Gary Baines]] compared the book's deeply pessimistic message and its looking forwards to a disastrous future to the tone of [[J.M. Coetzee]]'s ''[[Waiting for the Barbarians]]'' several decades later in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Baines, "Revisiting Urban African Policy and the Reforms of the Smuts Government, 1939-48", Workshop on South Africa in the 1940s, Southern African Research Centre, Kingston, September 2003 [http://www.queensu.ca/sarc/Conferences/1940s/Baines.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;
