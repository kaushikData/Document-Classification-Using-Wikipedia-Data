The '''''Act Zluky''''' ({{lang-uk|Акт Злуки}}, {{IPA-uk|ˈɑkt ˈzlukɪ|IPA}}, "Unification Act") was an agreement signed on January 22, 1919, by the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] and the [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]] on the [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev|St. Sophia Square]] in [[Kiev]]. Since 1999 the '''Day of Unity of Ukraine''', celebrated every year on January 22 to mark the signing of the treaty, is a state holiday;&lt;ref name=Yanyspeech&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/95353/ Yanukovych condemns attempts to undermine unity], [[Kyiv Post]] (January 21, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opinion-times.com/okran2.php The Day of Unity]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, [[opinion-times.com]]&lt;/ref&gt; but not a public holiday.&lt;ref name=CMUArmyDAy&gt;Culture Smart!

[[File:Act Zluky.jpg|thumb|200px|A copy of the Act Zluky, signed on January 22, 1919]]

==History==
The agreement was aimed at creating a unified Ukrainian state, a movement long-awaited by the [[intelligentsia]] on both sides.&lt;ref name="subtelny-362"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ukraine: A History|author=Subtelny, Orest|publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|year=2000|isbn=0-8020-8390-0|pages=362|authorlink=Orest Subtelny}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Act Zluky was regarded as purely symbolic in that both governments still retained their own separate armies, administrations and government structure.&lt;ref name="subtelny-362"/&gt;

The text of the [[Universal (act)|universal]] made by the [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directorate]] of the Ukrainian People's Republic:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The territory of Ukraine, divided over the centuries, including [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], [[Bukovina|Bukovyna]], [[Carpathian Ruthenia]], and [[Dnieper Ukraine]] will now become a great united Ukraine. Dreams, for which the best sons of Ukraine fought and died for, have come true.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the treaty Galicia would become an autonomous part of Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Fj3WXcl_kcoC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=Unification+Act+Ukrainian+People%27s+Republic&amp;hl=nl&amp;ei=HaFtTcXeHsHqOZCshYED&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Unification%20Act%20Ukrainian%20People%27s%20Republic&amp;f=false The Moulding of Ukraine:The Constitutional Politics of State Formation] by [[Kataryna Wolczuk]], [[Central European University Press]], 2001, {{ISBN|978-963-9241-25-1}} (page 44)&lt;/ref&gt;

However Ukraine was unable to gain independence and in December 1920 the [[Ukrainian SSR]] of the [[Soviet Union]] was established comprising most the territory of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]].&lt;ref name=Ukraine/&gt; The territories of the [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]] became mostly part of Poland.&lt;ref name=Ukraine/&gt; In 1939 the territories of both became part of the Ukrainian SSR.&lt;ref name=Ukraine&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gP_-8rXzQs8C&amp;pg=PA4292&amp;dq=Ukrainian+People%27s+Republic&amp;hl=nl&amp;ei=z6NtTe6eEcKw8QPxt-ysBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Ukrainian%20People%27s%20Republic&amp;f=false Europa World Year Book 2-2004 publication], [[Routledge]], 2004, {{ISBN|978-1-85743-255-8}} (page 4292)&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bartlett regarded the word combination "[[sustainable growth]]" as an [[oxymoron]], since even modest annual percentage population increases will inevitably equate to huge exponential growth over sustained periods of time. He therefore regarded [[human overpopulation]] as "The Greatest Challenge" facing humanity.

==Career==
Bartlett received a B.A. in [[physics]] at [[Colgate University]] (1944), and an A.M. (1948) and Ph.D. (1951) in physics at [[Harvard University]]. Bartlett joined the faculty at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]] in September 1950. In 1978 he was national president of the [[American Association of Physics Teachers]]. He was a [[Research fellow|fellow]] of the [[American Physical Society]] and of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]. In 1969 and 1970 he served two terms as the elected chair of the four-campus faculty council at the university. He won the [[Robert A. Millikan award]].&lt;ref name=ObitCU&gt;{{cite web|title=CU-Boulder campus mourns death of longtime, celebrated professor Al Bartlett|url=http://www.colorado.edu/news/releases/2013/09/09/cu-boulder-campus-mourns-death-longtime-celebrated-physics-professor-al|date=9 Sep 2013|access-date=2014-03-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323145655/http://www.colorado.edu/news/releases/2013/09/09/cu-boulder-campus-mourns-death-longtime-celebrated-physics-professor-al|archive-date=2014-03-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Bartlett often explained how sustainable growth is a [[contradiction]].  His view was based on the fact that a modest percentage growth will equate to huge escalations over relatively short periods of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-QA2rkpBSY |title=Arithmetic, Population &amp; Energy, Part I, at youtube, Retrieved July 2011 |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2007-06-16 |accessdate=2013-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bartlett argued that, over time, compound growth can yield enormous increases. For example, an investor earning a constant annual 7% return on their investment would find his or her capital doubling within 10 years. But the same exponential power, so advantageous to patient investors, may be potentially calamitous when applied to human population. A population of 10,000 individuals, if it were to grow at a constant rate of 7% per annum, would reach a population size of 10 million after 100 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Clark |first=Susan |url=http://www.energybulletin.net/node/4153 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717153151/http://www.energybulletin.net/node/4153 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-07-17 |title=Professor talks at an exponential rate, Energy Bulletin article by Todd Neff. Retrieved July 2011 |publisher=Energybulletin.net |date=2005-01-25 |accessdate=2013-11-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bartlett regarded the failure to understand the laws of the exponential equation as "The Greatest Challenge" facing humanity, and promoted [[sustainable living]] and was an early advocate on the topic of overpopulation. He opposed the [[cornucopian]] school of thought (as advocated by people such as [[Julian Lincoln Simon]]), and referred to it as "The New Flat Earth Society"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hubbertpeak.com/bartlett/flatearth.htm |title=Bartlett at hubberpeak.com, Retrieved July 2011 |publisher=Hubbertpeak.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

J. B. Calvert (1999) has proposed that Bartlett's law&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.du.edu/~jcalvert/econ/bartlett.htm |title=Bartlett |publisher=Du.edu |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626160015/http://www.du.edu/~jcalvert/econ/bartlett.htm |archivedate=2007-06-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; will result in the exhaustion of petrochemical resources due to the [[exponential growth]] of the [[world population]] (in line with the [[Malthusian Growth Model]]).

Bartlett made two notable statements relating to sustainability:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The greatest shortcoming of the human race is our inability to understand the exponential function."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and his ''Great Challenge'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Can you think of any problem in any area of human endeavor on any scale, from microscopic to global, whose long-term solution is in any demonstrable way aided, assisted, or advanced by further increases in population, locally, nationally, or globally?"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bartlett died on September 7, 2013.&lt;ref name="ObitCU"/&gt;

==Influence and legacy==
Bartlett's work has been highly influential. As one example, his work on exponential growth and population is referred to in depth in the ''Crash Course'' created by [[Chris Martenson]] and his organisation Peak Prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crash Course|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYyugz5wcrI|website=YouTube|publisher=Peak Prosperity|accessdate=12 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2013 (the month before Prof. Bartlett's death), the Environmental Center at the University of Colorado at Boulder offered training on giving his presentation; the team "came together because they believe so strongly in Dr. Bartlett's message and want to ensure it continues to be delivered well into the future".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_23789895/cu-boulder-plots-extend-life-profs-famous-lecture&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Anti-Rightist Movement.jpg|thumb|right|250px|One of many 1950s Chinese parades showing support for the communist political movement.]]
The '''Anti-Rightist Campaign''' ({{zh|s=反右运动|t=反右運動|p=Fǎn Yòu Yùn dòng}}) in the [[People's Republic of China]], which lasted from roughly 1957 to 1959, was a campaign to purge alleged "[[rightists]]" within the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) and abroad. The definition of rightists was not always consistent, sometimes including critics to the left of the government, but officially referred to those intellectuals who appeared to favor [[capitalism]] and were against [[collectivization]]. The campaigns were instigated by Chairman [[Mao Zedong]] and saw the political persecution of an estimated 550,000 people.&lt;ref name="silence"&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=Uneasy silences punctuate 60th anniversary coverage|url=http://cmp.hku.hk/2009/09/10/1740/|work=|publisher=China Media Project|date=|accessdate=2009-09-30|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611085558/http://cmp.hku.hk/2009/09/10/1740/|archivedate=2010-06-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source needed|date=March 2018}}

==Background==
The Anti-Rightist Campaign was a reaction against the [[Hundred Flowers Campaign]] which had promoted pluralism of expression and criticism of the government, even though initiation of both campaigns was controlled by Chairman Mao and were integrally connected. Going perhaps as far back as the [[Long March]] there had been resentment against "rightists" inside the CPC, for example, [[Zhang Bojun]].&lt;ref name = "ZBJ"&gt;[http://www.zonaeuropa.com/20041102_1.htm  The International PEN Award For Independent Chinese Writing], EastSouthWestNorth, retrieved 2007-01-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==First wave==
The first wave of attacks began immediately following the end of the Hundred Flowers movement in July 1957. By the end of the year, 300,000 people had been labeled as rightists, including the writer [[Ding Ling]]. Future premier [[Zhu Rongji]], then working in the State Planning Commission, was purged in 1958. Most of the accused were intellectuals. The penalties included informal criticism, [[re-education through labour|hard labor]], and in some cases, [[execution]].

One main target was the independent [[legal system]]. Legal professionals were transferred to other jobs; judicial power was exercised instead by political cadres and the police.

==Second wave==
The second part of the campaign followed the [[Lushan Conference]] of July 2 – August 16, 1959. The meeting condemned General [[Peng Dehuai]], who had criticised the [[Great Leap Forward]].

==Historical revisionism after Mao==
After Mao's death, many of the convictions were revoked in 1979. At that time, under leader [[Deng Xiaoping]], the government announced that it needed capitalists' experience to get the country moving economically, and subsequently the guilty verdicts of thousands of counterrevolutionary cases were overturned — affecting many of those accused of rightism and who had been persecuted for that crime the previous twenty two years.&lt;ref name="WuWu2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Harry Wu|author2=George Vecsey|title=Troublemaker: One Man's Crusade Against China's Cruelty|date=December 30, 2002|publisher=Times Books|isbn=0-8129-6374-1|pages=68–}}&lt;/ref&gt; This came despite the fact that Deng Xiaoping had been one of the most enthusiastic prosecutors of the movement during the "First Wave" of 1957.

==Censorship in China==
In 2009, leading up the 60th anniversary of the PRC's founding, a number of media outlets in China listed the most significant events of 1957 but downplayed or omitted reference to the Anti-Rightist Movement.&lt;ref name="silence"/&gt; Websites were reportedly notified by authorities that the topic of the movement was extremely sensitive.&lt;ref name="silence"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13415">The '''Arctic Council Indigenous Peoples Secretariat''' (IPS) is a secretariat for the six international [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] organizations affiliated with the eight-nation [[Arctic Council]]. The IPS does not represent indigenous peoples or their organizations, but assists those organizations in presenting their causes, and helps to disseminate information among them.&lt;ref name="ipsa"&gt;[http://www.arcticpeoples.org/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;layout=item&amp;id=237&amp;Itemid=6 Arctic Council Indigenous Peoples’ Secretariat - IPS]. Accessed January 27, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
IPS was established in 1994 under the auspices of the Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy (AEPS). It was around the same time that the category of Permanent Participants was being developed and applied to the three indigenous peoples’ organizations then observers in the AEPS. When the Arctic Council was established in 1996, both the Permanent Participants and IPS was reinserted into the new intergovernmental framework. Since commencing business in 1994, the role of the secretariat has been to facilitate contributions from the Permanent Participants to the cooperation of the eight Arctic states and to assist the Permanent Participants in performing, mainly communicational task.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arcticpeoples.org/about&lt;/ref&gt;

==The work of IPS==
The Arctic Council Indigenous Peoples’ Secretariat is a support Secretariat for the International Indigenous Peoples’ Organizations that have Permanent Participant status in the Arctic Council. IPS assists with creating opportunities for the Indigenous Peoples’ Organizations to present their causes, and helps provide them with necessary information and materials.
IPS work includes:

• Ensuring that Permanent Participants are sent documents and reports connected to the work of the [[Arctic Council]] and its working groups.

• Helping Permanent Participants to present their views to the [[Arctic Council]] and its Working Groups.

• Collecting and communicating information about the [[Arctic Council]] and its results to the Indigenous Peoples in the various parts of the Arctic.

• Providing co-ordination for the Indigenous Peoples’ Organizations to meet with each other, and to participate in the [[Arctic Council]] Working Groups.

==Governing Board and staff==
A Governing Board, chosen from among the six indigenous peoples' groups that are permanent participants, directs the work of IPS and approves its annual work agenda. Permanent participants choose the Chair of the Governing Board, a position that rotates among the six indigenous groups. The current Chair, [[Ethel Blake]], representing [[Gwich'in Council International]], assumed the two-year post in 2017;&lt;ref name="rodion"&gt;[http://www.arcticpeoples.org/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=401:new-ips-chair&amp;Itemid=2 New IPS Chair], IPS, 24 May 2011. Accessed January 27, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; the previous incumbent was [[Tommy Pedersen]] of the [[Saami Council]], who had held the post since 2009.&lt;ref name="rodion"/&gt;
The [[working language]] for meetings of the IPS is [[English language|English]]; official communications, however, are published in both English and [[Russian language|Russian]]. The Executive Secretary, currently [[Elle Merete Omma]], is responsible for daily operations and for directing IPS staff. Workplace rules and regulations, as well as accounting and auditing procedures, follow [[Nordic model|Danish law]].&lt;ref name="ipsa"/&gt;

==The Indigenous Peoples organizations==
There are six indigenous peoples organizations covering the Arctic, they all have status of permanent participants in the [[Arctic Council]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arcticpeoples.org/organizations&lt;/ref&gt;]

===Aleut International Association - AIA===
The Aleut International Association represents Aleut on the Russian and American Aleutian, Pribilof and Commander Islands. It is an Alaska Native not-for-profit corporation, 501(c)(3), registered in the State of Alaska, United States of America, in 1998. AIA was formed by the Aleutian/Pribilof Islands Association, U.S., one of the thirteen regional not-for-profit Alaska Native corporations created as a result of Alaska Native Settlement Claims Act in 1971, and the Association of the Indigenous Peoples of the North of the Aleut District of the Kamchatka Region of the Russian Federation (AIPNADKR). AIA is governed by a Board of Directors composed of four Alaskan and four Russian Aleuts under the leadership of a president. The current president is Mr. Michael Zacharof of Saint Paul Island, Alaska, U.S. The Executive Director is Victoria Gofman of Anchorage, Alaska, U.S.The organization was formed to address environmental and cultural concerns of the extended Aleut family whose wellbeing has been connected to the rich resources of the Bering Sea for millennia. Russian and American Aleuts are separated by distances, borders and the International Date Line but united by the great Bering Sea and the North Pacific. Today, not only does the Aleut community share the resources of the region but the environmental problems as well. The need to understand global processes, such as trans-boundary contaminants transport, the impacts of climate change, and the effects of commercial fisheries on the ecosystem of the Bering Sea to name a few, was an impetus in joining in the work of international fora where AIA is actively pursuing collaboration with governments, scientists, and other organizations in developing programs and policies that could improve the wellbeing of the Aleut people and their environment. AIA was admitted as a permanent participant of the Arctic Council in 1998 and was granted Special Consultive Status by the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations in 2004. In addition, AIA is an accredited Non Governmental Organization (NGO) with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Global Environment Facility (GEF).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arcticpeoples.org/aleut&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aleut-international.org/Page1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arctic Athabaskan Council - AAC===
The Arctic Athabaskan Council is an international treaty organization established to represent the interests of United States and Canadian Athabaskan member First Nation governments in Arctic Council fora, and to foster a greater understanding of the common heritage of all Athabaskan peoples of Arctic North America.The founding members of AAC include four Alaskan Athabaskan communities (Chickaloon Village Traditional Council, Healy Lake Traditional Council (Mendas Cha~Ag), Steven Village Tribal Government, Council, Northway Tribal Council)-and three Athabaskan representative bodies on the Canadian side-the Council of Yukon First Nations, representing eleven Yukon First Nations, the Dene Nation, representing 30 First Nations in the Northwest Territories and northern Manitoba, and Métis Nation-Northwest Territories, representing 13 communities in the Northwest Territories. In total, Arctic Athabaskan founding member governments represent approximately 32,000 indigenous peoples of Athabaskan descent residing in Arctic and Sub-Arctic North America. As more member governments from both the United States (Alaska) and Canada join, this number is expected to increase to approximately 40,000.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arcticpeoples.org/athabaskan&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arcticathabaskancouncil.com/aac/?q=about&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gwich'in Council International - GCI===
The Gwich'in Council International was established as a non-profit organization in 1999 by the Gwich'in Tribal Council in Inuvik, NWT, to ensure all regions of the Gwich'in Nation in the Northwest Territories, Yukon and Alaska are represented at the Arctic Council, as well as to play an active and significant role in the development of policies that relate to the Circumpolar Arctic. GCI has a number of priorities that relate to the environment, youth, culture and tradition, social and economic development and education.The founding members of GCI includes six Alaskan Gwich'in communities (Arctic Village, Chalkyitsik, Fort Yukon, Birtch, Circle and Venetie) two Gwich'in representative bodies in Canada - Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation representing Vuntut Gwitchin in Old Crow, Yukon, and Gwich'in Tribal Council representing four communities in the Beaufort Delta region in the Northwest Territories. In total, the Gwich'in Council International founding members represent approximately 9,000 indigenous peoples of Gwich'in descent. The GCI Secretariat rotates between the Gwich'in Tribal Council in Inuvik, NWT and the Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation in Old Crow, Yukon.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arcticpeoples.org/gwichin&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gwichin.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inuit Circumpolar Council - ICC===
The [[Inuit Circumpolar Council]] is a transnational non-governmental organization representing 150 000 Inuit across the Circumpolar North. The ICC began originally as an Inuit Circumpolar Conference, first held in 1977, and gradually evolved to become a Council in the 10th General Assembly meeting of the Inuit Circumpolar Conference in 2006 in Utqiagvik, Alaska. The ICC represents today four different Inuit regional organizations in Canada, Alaska, Greenland and Russia. The Russian regional Council in Chukotka was opened 2001 and it operates closely with the Yupik Society, which represents Chukotka's Inuit locally and nationally. The ICC Alaska consists of Inuit from the North Slope Borough, Northwest Arctic Borough, the Bering Straits Region, and the Yukon-Kuskokwim Region and the ICC Canada represents the four land-claim regions, namely Inuvialuit, Labrador, Nunavik, and Nunavut. The ICC Greenland differs from the other regional Councils, representing different organisms of the Greenlandic society instead of representing specific area within the country. Members in the Greenlandic ICC are thus NGOs like the women's association, political entities such as Greenland's parliament and political parties and special-interest groups, e.g. Greenland's workers union (SIK). The principal objective of the ICC is to create unity amongst the Inuit to be able to promote their common agenda on the international level. In addition, the ICC stresses the importance of sustainable environmental management in order to preserve the wildlife and biological diversity and recalls the right of Inuit to the natural resources in their traditional areas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arcticpeoples.org/inuit&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://inuitcircumpolar.com/index.php?auto_slide=&amp;ID=16&amp;Lang=En&amp;Parent_ID=&amp;current_slide_num=&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russian Association of Indigenous Peoples of the North - RAIPON===
[[Russian Association of Indigenous Peoples of the North]] was created in 1990 at the First Congress of Indigenous Peoples of the North. The Association was originally called the "Association of Peoples of the North of the USSR" and united 26 indigenous groups of the North Russia. Today, RAIPON unites 41 indigenous groups whose total population is around 250,000 people. These peoples are represented by 34 regional and ethnic organizations that have the authority to represent these groups both in Russia and in the international community. RAIPON is a permanent participant at the Arctic Council. RAIPON is an observer of UNEP Governing Council/Global Ministerial Environment Forum. RAIPON is an observer of World Intellectual Property Organization's Committee on Intellectual Property and Genetic Resources, Traditional Knowledge and Folklore.Aiming to develop new knowledge about the interaction of actors in the High North, conducted by the Norwegian institute for defence Studies with partners and associates.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arcticpeoples.org/raipon&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://raipon.info/en/raipon.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Saami Council - SC===
The [[Saami Council]] is a non-governmental Saami organization (NGO), with member organizations in Finland, Russia, Norway and Sweden. Since its foundation in 1956 the Saami Council has actively dealt with Saami policy tasks.The primary aims of the Saami Council are the promotion of Saami rights and interests in the four countries having Saami population, to consolidate the feeling of affinity among the Saami people, to attain recognition for the Saami as one nation and to promote economic, social and cultural rights of the Saami in the legislation of the four states, Norway, Sweden, Russia and Finland. Saami Council renders opinions and makes proposals on questions concerning Saami people's rights, language and culture.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arcticpeoples.org/saami&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.saamicouncil.net/?deptid=2178&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Burgage''' is a [[medieval land terms|medieval land term]] used in [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]], well established by the 13th century. 

A burgage was a town ("[[borough]]" or "[[burgh]]") rental property (to use modern terms), owned by a king or lord. The property ("burgage tenement") usually, and distinctly, consisted of a house on a long and narrow plot of land ([[Scots language|Scots]]: ''toft''), with a narrow street frontage. Rental payment ("tenure") was usually in the form of money, but each "burgage tenure" arrangement was unique, and could include services. 

As populations grew, "burgage plots" could be split into smaller additional units. (Amalgamation was not so common, until the second half of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;T. R. Slater, The Analysis of Burgage Patterns in Medieval Towns&lt;/ref&gt;) 

Burgage tenures were usually money based, in contrast to rural tenures which were usually services based. In [[Anglo-Saxon England|Saxon times]] the rent was called a ''landgable'' or ''hawgable''.

==History==
Burgage was the basis of the franchise in many boroughs sending [[Member of Parliament|members]] to the [[unreformed House of Commons]] before 1832. In these boroughs the right to vote was attached to the occupation of particular burgage tenements. These could be freely bought and sold, and the owner of the tenement was entitled to [[conveyancing|convey]] it for the duration of the election to a nominee, who could then vote. Thus by purchasing the majority of the burgages one could acquire the right to nominate the Members of Parliament. Most of the burgage boroughs became [[pocket borough]]s in this way. The practice was abolished by the [[Reform Act 1832|Great Reform Act 1832]] which applied a uniform franchise to all boroughs.

In medieval England and Scotland, and some parts of the [[Welsh Marches]], '''burgage plots''' or '''burgage tenements''' were [[inclosure|inclosed fields]] extending the confines of a town, established by the lord of the manor, as divisions of the 'open' manorial fields. The [[Burgess (word)|burgesses]] (equivalents of "burghers") to whom these tracts were allotted, as tenants of the enclosed lands, paid a cash rent instead of, as previously, feudal service. In 1207, for instance, Maurice Paynell, the Lord of the Manor of Leeds, granted a charter to 'his burgesses of Leeds' to build a 'new town', and so created the first borough of Leeds, Briggate, a street running north from the River Aire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leodis.org/discovery/default.asp Discovering Leeds]&lt;/ref&gt;

These burgesses had to be freemen: those who were entitled to practise a trade within the town and to participate in electing members of the town's ruling council.

In the very earliest chartered foundations, predating the [[Norman Conquest]], the burgage plots were simply the ploughland strips of pre-existing agrarian settlements. In towns like [[Burford]] in Oxfordshire and [[Chipping Campden]] in Gloucestershire, [[Bromyard]] in Herefordshire, and [[Cricklade]] in Wiltshire, the property on the road frontage extends in a very long garden plot behind the dwelling even today, as English property boundaries have remained very stable.{{fact|date=May 2017}} In [[South Zeal]], in Devon, burgage plots were known as "borough acres".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dartmoor-npa.gov.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/42396/laf-szburgage.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic unit of measurement was the [[Pole (length)|perch]] which was 5.5 yards (5.03 m) and the plots can be identified today because they are in multiples of perches: at Cricklade most were 2 by 12 perches (10.1 by 60.4 m), while at Charmouth in Dorset, a charter of the year 1320 provided plots 4 perches wide and 20 perches long (about 20 by 100 m), giving a typical plot size of half an acre (0.2 hectare), held at an annual rent of 6[[penny|d]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wiltshire.gov.uk/community/getfaq.php?id=216 Wiltshire County Council]&lt;/ref&gt;

Burgage grants were also common in Ireland; for example, when the town of [[Wexford]] received its royal charter in 1418, English settlers were encouraged into the town and were given burgage plots at a rent of one [[shilling]] per year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://irishwalledtownsnetwork.ie/page/wexford/wexford-info]&lt;/ref&gt; The term was translated into [[Irish language|Irish]] as ''buiríos'', and the element "[[Borris (disambiguation)|Borris]]"&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt; survives in many Irish place names.

The '''Citizens for Rowling''' campaign was a failed [[Political campaign|campaign]] to stop [[Robert Muldoon]] winning the 1975 New Zealand election. It was named after then [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]] [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]] [[Bill Rowling]] in the lead-up to the [[New Zealand general election, 1975|1975 general election]]. Members of the campaign publicly signed the "Citizens for Rowling" petition warning against a [[New Zealand National Party|National]] government led by Muldoon. The campaign was largely organised by David Exel, a former television producer and current affairs interviewer.

Central to the campaign was a booklet, in the form of a petition, which attacked Muldoon's leadership style, which was stated as being "divisive" and "moving towards factional strife". Ads were run in major papers around New Zealand asking people to 'stand up and be counted' as supporting Bill Rowling and the campaign. Many offshoot groups were formed, such as Lawyers for Rowling and Clergy for Rowling. Rowling's eldest son, Carl, also joined the campaign.

==Prominent members==
Prominent members of the campaign included:

* [[Geoffrey Palmer (politician)|Geoffrey Palmer]]
* Sir [[Sir Jack Wolfred Ashford Harris, 2nd Baronet|Jack Harris]]
* Sir [[Edmund Hillary]]
* [[John Hinchcliff]] &lt;ref&gt;[[New Zealand Listener|The Listener]], ''Ask that Philosopher'', 1–7 May 2004, Volume 193, Number 3338

* Graham Nuthall
* Sir [[Paul Reeves]]
* [[Walter James Scott|Walter J. Scott]]

==Outcome==
Despite gaining a lot of press for Labour, the campaign did not succeed, with Muldoon launching a public denial of the claims and stating, "The average chap doesn't want to be told how to vote."&lt;ref&gt;''Rowling: The man and the myth'' by John Henderson, Australia New Zealand Press, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; Labour went on to lose power after the [[New Zealand general election, 1975|1975 general election]].

The publication came up again after the controversial decision by Muldoon to appoint [[Keith Holyoake]] as Governor-General in 1977. Rowling said that should Labour win the [[New Zealand general election, 1978|1978 general election]], he would remove Holyoake as Governor-General and openly stated that he would have appointed [[Sir Edmund Hillary]] to the post.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; That was criticised by Muldoon's government, as Hillary had notably backed Labour in the "Citizens for Rowling" campaign in 1975.&lt;ref name="doughty"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ross Doughty|title=The Holyoake years|publisher=Feilding|year=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow Citizen Sir [[Paul Reeves]] was appointed Governor-General by the [[Fourth Labour Government of New Zealand|Fourth Labour Government]] in 1985.

A '''condominium''', often shortened to '''condo''', in the [[United States]] and in most [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]]s, is a type of [[living space]] which is similar to an [[apartment]] but which is independently sellable and therefore regarded as [[real estate]]. It is where the condominium [[building structure]] is divided into several units that are each separately owned, surrounded by [[common area]]s that are jointly owned. Similar concepts in other English-speaking countries include: '''[[strata title]]''' in [[Australia]], [[Malaysia]], [[New Zealand]] and the Canadian province of [[British Columbia]]; '''[[commonhold]]''' in the [[United Kingdom]] and; '''sectional title''' in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://huis-huis.co.za/sectional-title.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-02-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110413062240/http://www.huis-huis.co.za/sectional-title.htm |archive-date=2011-04-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Residential condominiums are frequently constructed as [[apartment]] buildings, but there has been an increase in the number of "detached condominiums", which look like [[single-family detached home|single-family homes]] but in which the yards, building exteriors, and streets are jointly owned and jointly maintained by a [[community association]].

Unlike apartments, which are [[lease]]d by their [[leasehold estate|tenants]], condominium units are owned outright. Additionally, the owners of the individual units also collectively own the common areas of the property, such as hallways, walkways, laundry rooms, etc.; as well as common utilities and amenities, such as the [[HVAC]] system, elevators, and so on. Many shopping malls are industrial condominiums in which the individual retail and office spaces are owned by the businesses that occupy them while the common areas of the mall are collectively owned by all the business entities that own the individual spaces.

The common areas, amenities and utilities are managed collectively by the owners through their association, such as a [[homeowner association]].

Scholars have traced the earliest known use of the condominium form of tenure to a document from first century [[Babylon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/02/nyregion/fighting-dog-owners-discourtesy-with-dna-in-brooklyn.html?smid=tw-nytmetro|title=Using DNA to Fight Dog Owners’ Discourtesy in Brooklyn|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''[[Wiktionary:condominium#Latin|condominium]]'' originated in [[Latin]].

[[Italy]] uses ''[[Wiktionary:condominio#Italian|condominio]]'', which is simply the modern Italian form of ''condominium''. Both ''condo'' and ''[[Wiktionary:condominium#French|condominium]]'' are used colloquially in the Canadian Province of [[Quebec]], where the official term is ''[[:fr:Copropriété#La copropriété divise au Québec|divided co-ownership]]''. In [[France]], however, the term is simply ''[[:fr:Copropriété|copropriété]]'', "co-property," and the common areas of these properties are usually managed by a ''[[:fr:Syndicat de copropriété|Syndicat de copropriété]]'' or "co-property union" ("union" in the sense of "association").

[[Hispanidad|Latin American]] nations often use the term ''[[:es:Propiedad horizontal|propiedad horizontal]]'', literally meaning "horizontal property" but abstractly meaning that all owners of the property have equal interest. The word ''[[Wiktionary:condominio#Spanish|condominio]]'' is also used. However, in Spain the term is "comunidad de propietarios" (legal term) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.comunidades.com|title=Comunidades de propietarios y no comunidades de vecinos|website=Comunidades}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madrid.org/cs/Satellite?c=FRAME_Contenido_FA&amp;childpagename=PortalConsumidor%2FFRAME_Contenido_FA%2FPTCS_contenidoReportajes&amp;cid=1354340294830&amp;p=1343064181510&amp;pagename=PTCS_wrapper |title=Comunidades de propietarios: lo que hay que saber - Madrid.org - Portal del Consumidor |publisher=Madrid.org |date= |accessdate=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "comunidad de vecinos" (popular term for the residents). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madrid.org/cs/Satellite?cid=1207574902747&amp;language=es&amp;pagename=PortalVivienda%2FPage%2FPVIV_listado |title=Vivienda &amp;#124; Comunidad de Madrid |language={{es icon}} |publisher=Madrid.org |date=2018-06-27 |accessdate=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
{{Property law}}
"Condominium" is a [[Latin]] word formed by adding the prefix ''con-'' ("together") to the word ''dominium'' ("domain, property, ownership"). Its meaning is therefore "shared property".

Condominia (the plural of condominium in Latin) originally referred to territories over which two or more sovereign powers shared joint dominion. This technique was frequently used to settle border disputes when multiple claimants could not agree on how to partition the disputed territory. For example, from 1818 to 1846, [[Oregon Country]] was a condominium over which both the [[United States]] and [[Great Britain]] shared joint sovereignty until the [[Oregon Treaty]] resolved the issue by splitting the territory along the 49th parallel and each country gaining sole sovereignty of one side.

== Overview ==
The difference between an "apartment" complex and condominium is purely legal. There is no way to differentiate a condominium from an apartment simply by looking at or visiting the building. What defines a condominium is the form of ownership. A building developed as a condominium (and ''sold'' in individual units to different ''owners'') could actually be built at another location as an apartment building (the developers would retain ownership and ''rent'' individual units to different ''tenants'').  As a practical matter, builders tend to build condominiums to higher quality standards than apartment complexes because of the differences between the rental and sale markets.

Technically, a condominium is a collection of individual home units and [[common area]]s along with the land upon which they sit. Individual home ownership within a condominium is construed as ownership of only the air space confining the boundaries of the home. The boundaries of that space are specified by a legal document known as a Declaration, filed on record with the local governing authority. Typically, these boundaries will include the wall surrounding a condo, allowing the homeowner to make some interior modifications without impacting the common area. Anything outside this boundary is held in an undivided ownership interest by a corporation established at the time of the condominium's creation. The corporation holds this property in trust on behalf of the homeowners as a group—it may not have ownership itself.

Condominiums have conditions, covenants, and restrictions, and often additional rules that govern how the individual unit owners are to share the space.

It is also possible for a condominium to consist of single-family dwellings. There are also "detached condominiums" where homeowners do not maintain the exteriors of the dwellings, yards, etc. and "site condominiums" where the owner has more control and possibly ownership (as in a "whole lot" or "lot line" condominium) over the exterior appearance. These structures are preferred by some [[planned neighborhood]]s and [[gated community|gated communities]].

== Homeowners Association (HOA) ==

A [[homeowners association]] (HOA), whose members are the unit owners, manages the condominium through a board of directors elected by the membership. This exists under various names depending on the jurisdiction, such as "unit title", "sectional title", "[[commonhold]]", "strata council", or "[[tenant-owner's association]]", "body corporate", "Owners Corporation", "condominium corporation" or "condominium association". Another variation of this concept is the "time share", although not all time shares are condominiums, and not all time shares involve actual ownership of (i.e., deeded title to) real property. Condominiums may be found in both [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and [[common law]] legal systems as it is purely a creation of [[statute]].  Among other things, the HOA assesses unit owners for the costs of maintaining the common areas, etc.  That is, the HOA decides how much each owner should pay and has the legal power to collect that.

== Condominium unit description ==
[[File:The Cosmopolitan Singapore.jpg|thumb|The Cosmopolitan, a condominium in [[Singapore]]]]

The description of the condominium units and the common areas and any restrictions on their use is established in a document commonly called a "Master Deed" (also known as the "Enabling Declaration", the "Declaration of Conditions", or the "Condominium Document").  Among other things, this document provides for the creation of the HOA. Rules of governance for the association are usually covered under a separate set of bylaws which generally govern the internal affairs of the condominium. Condominium bylaws usually establish the responsibilities of the owners' association; the voting procedures to be used at [[Deliberative assembly|association meetings]]; the qualifications, powers, and duties of the board of directors; the powers and duties of the officers; and the obligations of the owners with regard to assessments, maintenance, and use of the units and common areas. Finally, a set of rules and regulations providing specific details of restrictions on conduct of unit owners and residents are established by the HOA.&lt;ref name="KamanCusimano"&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding the Government of a Community Association|url=http://www.ohiocondolaw.com/articles/governance_community_assn.htm|publisher=Kaman &amp; Cusimano|accessdate=24 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115041050/http://www.ohiocondolaw.com/articles/governance_community_assn.htm|archive-date=2012-01-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are more readily amendable than the declaration or association bylaws, typically requiring only a vote of the HOA board.  Typical rules include mandatory maintenance fees (perhaps collected monthly), pet restrictions, and color/design choices visible from the exterior of the units. Generally, these sets of rules and regulations are made available to residents and or as a matter of public record via a condominium or homeowners association website or through public files, depending on the state and its applicable laws. Condominiums are usually owned in [[fee simple]] [[title]], but can be owned in ways that other [[real estate]] can be owned, such as title held in [[Trust law|trust]]. In some jurisdictions, such as [[Ontario]], Canada or [[Hawaii]] USA, there are "leasehold condominiums" where the development is built on leased land.

In general, condominium unit owners can [[Renting|rent]] their home to [[leasehold estate|tenant]]s, similar to renting out other real estate, although leasing rights may be subject to conditions or restrictions set forth in the declaration (such as a rental cap for the total number of units in a community that can be leased at one time) or otherwise as permitted by local law.

== Non-residential uses ==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2016}}
Condominium ownership is also used, albeit less frequently, for non-residential land uses: offices, hotel rooms, retail shops, private airports, marinas, group housing facilities (retirement homes or dormitories),  bare land (in [[Condominiums in Canada|British Columbia]])) and [[storage condo|storage]]. The legal structure is the same, and many of the benefits are similar; for instance, a nonprofit corporation may face a lower tax liability in an office condominium than in an office rented from a taxable, for-profit company. However, the frequent turnover of commercial land uses in particular can make the inflexibility of condominium arrangements problematic.

== Similar concepts ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}
There are many forms of real estate ownership that are similar to condominiums but not identical.

Classic privately owned detached houses on privately owned lots may be part of a community that has a homeowner's association.  Such an association may administer a common park area, for example, or an access road, or architectural standards for the houses.

In a townhouse complex, multiple physical houses are combined into a single architectural building.  Each unit owner owns an identified plot of land and the building affixed to it, but that building is physically part of a larger building that spans lots.  There is a continuous roof and foundation and a single wall divides adjacent townhouses. If there is an apartment below not owned by owner of townhouse, then it is not a townhouse, just a bi-level apartment/condominium. Legally, this is very similar to detached houses, but because of the intertwining of interests in the single architectural building, a homeowner's association is required.  It would be impractical, for example to replace the roof of just one townhouse.  But unlike the condominium, the townhouse complex's HOA owns none of the building or the land under it.  It is essentially under contract to the townhouse owners to maintain the parts of the building that are hard to divide.  Even the walls between townhouses are usually outside the purview of the HOA, being jointly owned and maintained by the owners of the townhouses on either side.  Like the condominium, the townhouse complex often has common areas for roads, parking, clubhouses, and such.

A rowhouse is like a townhouse except that the houses are not physically connected.  They are independent structures that simply have no space between them.  Technically, they are detached.

A building with multiple residential units may simply be owned in common by multiple people, with each having specific rights to a particular unit and undivided interest in the rest.  This is like a condominium, but there is no HOA with legal powers.  It is much harder to govern, as the individual unit owners often have to agree unanimously or court intervention is required.

California statutes recognize three kinds of "common interest developments": condominium, townhouse, and community apartment, with the latter being the owned-in-common concept described above.

{{Main|Condominiums in Canada}}

=== Denmark ===
Apartments (Danish ''ejerlejlighed'', literally "owner-apartment") comprise some 5% of Danish homes.&lt;ref name="danske-boligmarked"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
They are traded and mortgaged on the same markets as free-standing houses, and are treated legally much like other forms of real estate. Each owner-tenant directly owns his own apartment; the rest of the building and the ground on which it stands is owned jointly by the apartment owners who execute their joint ownership through an ''owner's association''. The expenses of maintaining the joint property is shared ''pro rata'' among the owners.

Another 5% of Danish homes are in [[housing cooperative]]s (Danish ''andelsbolig''), which occupy a legal position intermediate between condominiums and [[housing association]]s. The entire property is legally owned by a non-profit corporation in which the tenants own shares; each share carries the right and duty to lease an apartment from the cooperative. Shares can be bought and sold, but often the cooperative's rules strictly limit the price for which they may change hand. (In contrast, condominiums are traded on a free market). Because the official share prices are often lower than the market value and sellers often retain freedom to select whom to sell to, under-the-table payments are common.&lt;ref name="danske-boligmarked"/&gt;

Current public policy favors condominiums over housing cooperatives, and recent legislation have aimed at making the latter more condominium-like. For example, since 2005, cooperative shares may be used to secure bank loans. (However, Danish [[Danish mortgage market|mortgage banks]] still may not mortgage individual housing cooperative apartments).

=== England and Wales, UK ===
{{Main|Commonhold}}
In [[England and Wales]], the equivalent of condominium is [[commonhold]], a form of ownership introduced in September 2004. As of 3 June 2009, there were 12 commonhold residential developments comprising 97 units in England and one commonhold residential development, comprising 30 units, in Wales.&lt;ref&gt;[[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]], {{UK Parliament |speaker=[[Michael Wills]] | date=9 June 2009 | place=Written Questions | url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2009-06-09c.278364.h |column=792W |title=Commonhold }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Condominium" is not a term that is widely used in England and Wales. The preferred term is "block of flats" with variations for particular circumstances.

Commonhold is a creature of statute and comparatively rare, and condominiums are more likely to be found in the form of leaseholds.

In English law it is not possible to enforce a positive covenant on successive owners of freehold land, other than to maintain a boundary fence, without creating an elaborate trust. A positive covenant is, broadly, one which involves the expenditure of money to perform.

This did not create a significant problem until the 1950s, when "flats" (where ownership is divided horizontally) first began to appear on the market as more affordable particularly for first-time buyers. Until then flats had been confined to short-term unsaleable tenancies, with varying degrees of statutory rent protection and security of tenure.

It was soon learned that freehold flats were an unsatisfactory form of ownership because it was not possible to impose essential maintenance requirements. As such, flats became virtually unmarketable because they were an unacceptable form of security to lenders. Thus solicitors, the principal property lawyers in England and Wales in those days, began to use leases instead, where such limitations did not apply.

Progress was haphazard and piecemeal, but over time things became more standard. Improvements became universal as institutional lenders refused to advance money on the security of flats unless certain basic provisions were included.  This benefited owners whether or not they borrowed money since purchase was invariably conducted through a solicitor or licensed conveyancer trained to reject leases failing to meet the necessary standards.

Despite these standards, the actual form of leasehold systems is variable. Highly favoured are arrangements where the leases are granted out of a freehold owned by a corporation, itself owned by individual leaseholders. This provides an opportunity for them to participate in the proper management of the block.  Again, quality of management is very variable.

The statute creating commonholds was motivated by a desire to eliminate some of the problems and perceived injustices, such as the commercial exploitation of "lessees" by freeholders as their leases began to have too little time left to satisfy lenders. Since most leasehold developments are undertaken by commercial entities, commonholds did not become widespread. There are, however, other statutes in place that give some degree of protection for leaseholders. It is, nevertheless, essential to consider proper legal advice whenever engaged in the purchase of a flat, for the requirements for a fully marketable flat remain complex.

Law of Property Act 1925, s.153, contains provisions for the "enlargement" of leases into freeholds, one of the effects of which is to preserve the enforceability of positive covenants contained in the lease against the resulting freehold. There are clear, but stringent, requirements. Artificial schemes using the provisions to create enforceable positive covenants in freehold blocks of flats were occasionally mooted but never gained currency.

Scotland has a separate legal system from England and Wales and is a separate consideration.

=== Finland ===
In [[Finland]], a condominium-like arrangement where the ownership of the real estate is assigned to specific apartments ({{lang-fi|[[hallinnanjakosopimus]]}}, {{lang-sv|avtal om delning av besittningen}}) is usually used only with [[single-family detached home|detached]] or [[semi-detached]] houses.

A [[housing cooperative]] is a common form of home ownership in Finland. Owning shares that correspond to one apartment in a housing company is generally considered as much ''owning your own home'' as actually directly owning a (single family) house. However, shares are not considered as [[real estate]] but as [[personal property]] and the co-op can take the possession of the apartment for a term time and evict the tenant or owner because of disturbance or unpaid maintenance fees.

Finnish housing cooperatives are incorporated as (non-profit) [[limited liability company|limited-liability companies]] ({{lang-fi|asunto-[[osakeyhtiö]]}}, {{lang-sv|bostadsaktiebolag}}), where one share usually represents one square meter (sometimes ten) of the apartment.

Membership of a condo is obtained by buying the shares on the open market, most often through a real estate agent. No board approval is needed to buy shares. There is usually no requirement for the owner(s) to live in the condo. Owning of apartments for rent is a common form of saving and private investment in Finland.

=== Germany ===
In Germany Condominiums are known as "Eigentumswohnung" and the most important law considering condominiums is the German Condominium Act (WEG). It's the basis for all legal regulations involving individual freehold ownership, the rights, duties of home owner associations and the management of condominiums. The Act dates back to 1951, but it was re-enacted in 2007. Now home owners are invested with partial legal capacity, which means that the [[Homeowner association|home owner association]] represents  an entity with rights and duties that may include contracts. The right of ownership is divided in the first article of the German Condominium Act into homeownership, individual freehold ownership, part ownership and commonhold ownership. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.accentro.co.uk/services/real-estate-glossary/glossary/condominium-act-weg-the-law-governing-all-aspects-of-freehold-ownership-in-germany/ |title=Condominium Act (WEG) |publisher=Accentro.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hong Kong ===
{{main|Private housing estates in Hong Kong}}
Condominiums are known as "private housing estates" (as opposed to "public housing estates") in Hong Kong.

=== Hungary ===
[[File:Társasház alaprajza (részlet).jpg|thumb|Floor plan of a condo - Andrássy avenue, Budapest]]
{{unreferenced section| date = January 2013}}
Condominiums (Hungarian: "társasház") were formally introduced in 1924. Condominium properties are traded and mortgaged on the same markets as free standing houses, and treated much like other forms of real estate. The condominium acts as a non-profit legal entity maintaining the common areas of the property, and is managed by a representative elected by the owners' convention.

Decisions that involve changes to the terms and conditions, or larger common expenses need to be approved by the convention, where voting power is based on the percentage of property owned.&lt;ref&gt;Condominium act, 1997 - http://www.justiceservices.gov.mt/DownloadDocument.aspx?app=lp&amp;itemid=26458&amp;l=1   20180608&lt;/ref&gt;

Actually, condominium is a frequent legal form of housing in Hungarian cities where  privatization of state or municipality-owned flats were effected mainly in the 1990s.

=== India ===
In India, condominiums are known as "Apartment Buildings" or "Flats". Each building consists of multiple floors and flats with different configurations. The most common configurations are "1-BHK", "2-BHK" and "3-BHK" (BHK stands for bedroom-hall-kitchen).

The association of home owners is usually called a Co-operative Housing Society (CHS) which needs to be registered with the municipal authorities.

=== Israel ===
In [[Israel]], condominiums (known ''"בתים משותפים"'', "shared houses" or "cooperative houses") are a common form of home ownership. Public housing has historically been organized as subsidized purchase and mortgages in government-constructed condominiums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peopleil.org/details.aspx?itemID=7464|title=הבית הקבלני המשותף בישראל|access-date=9 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
In [[Italy]], the condominium (''"Condominio"'') is governed by law, last reformed in 2012. Co-ownership of the common parts of the buildings (such as the stairs, main walls, facades, roof, courtyards) is mandatory: a landlord can not give up the right on common parts for not paying the costs. Each owner's quota in the condominium is expressed in thousandths (''"millesimi"'') of the whole; these are used to determine majorities in owners' assemblies (''"assemblee condominiali"'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.condominionews.com/2016/01/italiancondominium.html|title=Italian's condominiums|access-date=21 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Norway ===
{{unreferenced section| date = January 2013}}
Condominiums (Norwegian ''Eierseksjon'') were formally introduced in 1983. Approximately 19% of Norwegian homes are condominiums, as approximately 50% of the owner-occupied flats and duplexes, approximately 30% of the rowhouses and 2.5% of the detached houses are organised as condominiums.

=== Pakistan ===
{{unreferenced section| date = March 2016}}
Title "Condominiums" is not used in Pakistan rather they are called "Flats" for average style building while "Complexes" for sophisticated and larger buildings. Minimum floors for a building to be classified as "Flats" is four, with a requirement for having at least one elevator or lift for buildings upwards of four floors. Almost all have a separate room called the "Drawing Room", used for guest entertainment purposes. However, its use as TV room and dining room is common. Another unique feature is the balcony or "terrace", which are standard for all flats.

=== Philippines ===
In the Philippines, condominiums are classified into three types: low-rise, mid-rise, and high-rise. Condos have a special type of ownership title called a CCT - condominium certificate of transfer. Condominiums usually have amenities, like swimming pools, owned parking, a clubhouse and a building for administration. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mercado|first1=Caren|title=A Guide to Residential Spaces in the Philippines (Part 1)|url=http://kmcmaggroup.com/blog/2014/2/28/a-guide-to-residential-spaces-in-the-philippines/|website=kmcmaggroup.com/|publisher=KMC MAG Group|accessdate=Sep 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Condos and the Singapore Flyer by the Kallang River.jpg|thumb|220px|right|A condominium complex in Singapore next to the [[Kallang River]]]]
In [[Singapore]] and [[Malaysia]], "Condo" or "Condominium" are terms used for housing buildings with some special luxury features like security guards, swimming pools or tennis courts.

In Singapore, most housings without such features are built by the governmental Housing Development Board (HDB), and such HDB units can be possessed for rent or individually bought from the government. Condominiums and HDB flats make up the overwhelming majority of available residential housing in the country.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

=== South Africa ===
In South Africa, condominiums are known as "Sectional Title" properties, and are governed by the Sectional Titles Act No. 95 of 1986.&lt;ref name=SectionalTitlesAct&gt;{{cite web|title=SECTIONAL TITLES ACT NO. 95 OF 1986|url=http://csg.dla.gov.za/act95_86.htm|work=Chief Surveyor General of the South African Government|accessdate=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Town-house complexes and many apartment blocks typically have this form of title. The owners of the complex constitute the Body Corporate, and the Body Corporate elects a group of Trustees to manage the day-to-day management of the complex, who often hire a company specialising in complex management, known as a Managing Agent.

=== Spain ===
In Spain, condominiums are known as "comunidad de propietarios" (legal term) and "comunidad de vecinos" (popular term), and are governed by the Ley de Propiedad Horizontal (L.P.H.) which significantly extends the Spanish Civil Code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Guía práctica: Comunidades de propietarios

=== United States ===
The first condominium law passed in the United States was in the [[Puerto Rico|Commonwealth of Puerto Rico]] in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;Poliakoff, G: ''Law of Condominium Operations'', §1.2. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IR159 /&gt; In 1960, the first condominium in the Continental United States was built in [[Salt Lake City]], Utah. The legal concept had spread to the United States from Europe via the Caribbean (Puerto Rico and Cuba) but throughout the 1960s it was widely and erroneously reported that the concept had arisen in the United States directly based on an Ancient Roman model. In fact the concept of an estate in the air was antithetical to Roman Law and there is no evidence of an ancient Roman "condominio" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Natelson|first1=Robert|title=Comments on the Historiography of Condominium: The Myth of Roman Origin|journal=City of Oklahoma Law Review|date=1987|volume=12|issue=1|url=http://constitution.i2i.org/files/2010/09/Comments-on-the-Historiography-of-Condominium-The-Myth-of-Roman-Origin.pdf|accessdate=12 Feb 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 234 of the [[Housing Act of 1961]] allowed the [[Federal Housing Administration]] to insure mortgages on condominiums, leading to a vast increase in the funds available for condominiums, and to condominium laws in every state by 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kerr|first1=William|title=Condominium - Statutory Implementation|journal=St.John's Law Review|date=2013|volume=38|issue=1|url=http://scholarship.law.stjohns.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4266&amp;context=lawreview|accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Americans' first widespread awareness of condominium life came not from its largest cities but from [[South Florida]], where developers had imported the condominium concept from [[Puerto Rico]] and used it to sell thousands of inexpensive homes to retirees arriving flush with cash from the urban [[Northern United States]].&lt;ref name=IR159&gt;{{cite web|title=Information Report No. 159|url=https://www.planning.org/pas/at60/pdf/report159.pdf|publisher=American Society of Planning Officials|accessdate=27 July 2014|date=June 1962|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130909234758/https://www.planning.org/pas/at60/pdf/report159.pdf|archive-date=9 September 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary attraction to this type of ownership is the ability to obtain affordable housing in a highly desirable area that typically is beyond economic reach. Additionally, such properties benefit from having restrictions that maintain and enhance value, providing control over blight that plagues some neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carter|first1=Charles|last2=Marcus|first2=Allen|title=Pets, Politics, and Condominium Prices|url=http://www.petsincondos.org/PetsAndCondoPrices.pdf|accessdate=27 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727115523/http://www.petsincondos.org/PetsAndCondoPrices.pdf|archive-date=27 July 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the past several decades, the residential condominium industry has been booming in all of the major metropolitan areas such as [[Miami]], [[San Francisco]], [[Seattle]], [[Boston]], [[Chicago]], [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Los Angeles]] and [[New York City]].

An alternative form of ownership, popular in parts of the United States but found also in other [[common law]] jurisdictions, is [[housing cooperative]], also known as "company share" or "co-op". A Housing Cooperative is where the building has an associated legal [[corporation|company]] and ownership of shares gives the right to a [[lease]] for residence of a unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cheung|first1=Maria|title=The Art of Wooing a Co-op/Condo Board|url=http://www.pulversthompson.com/real-estate-blog/art-wooing-co-opcondo-board/|accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another form is [[ground rent]] (''solarium'') in which a single landlord retains ownership of the land (''solum'') but leases the surface rights (''superficies'') which renew in perpetuity or over a very long term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding Ground Rent in Maryland|url=http://www.peoples-law.org/understanding-ground-rent-maryland|website=The People's Law Library of Maryland|accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is comparable to a civil-law [[emphyteusis]], except that emphyteusis shifts the duties of up-keep and making improvements onto the renter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is EMPHYTEUSIS?|url=http://thelawdictionary.org/emphyteusis/|website=The Law Dictationary|accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, there are several different styles of condominium complexes. For example, a garden condominium complex consists of low-rise buildings built with landscaped grounds surrounding them. A [[townhouse]] condominium complex consists of multi-floor semi-detached homes. In condominium townhouses, the purchaser owns only the interior, while the building itself is owned by a condominium corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Condominium vs. Townhouse|url=http://realvaluations.com/CONDOMINIUM%20VS.%20TOWNHOUSE-.pdf|accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The corporation is jointly owned by all the owners, and charges them fees for general maintenance and major repairs. [[Freehold (law)|Freehold]] townhouses are exclusively owned, without any condominium aspects. In the United States this type of ownership is called [[fee simple]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bruce|first1=John|title=Review of Tenure Terminology|url=http://www.minds.wisconsin.edu/bitstream/handle/1793/22013/73_tb1.pdf|website=University of Wisconsin|accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Political corruption|Corruption]] in [[Mauritius]]''' is a widespread and growing problem. In cables leaked from the US embassy the problem with corruption was referred to as "pervasive and ingrained".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.transparency.org/files/content/corruptionqas/Country_Profile_Mauritius_2014.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Independent Commission Against Corruption (Mauritius)|Independent Commission Against Corruption]] (ICAC) investigates offenses and can confiscate the proceeds of corruption and money laundering.&lt;ref name="heritage foundation"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heritage.org/index/country/mauritius|title=Mauritius|publisher=[[The Heritage Foundation]]|accessdate=4 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008, the Director of the Mauritius Customs service stated that, during a meeting on April 11, 2008, with government officials, including the Financial Secretary of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development and Deputy Commissioner of Police, he was told in no uncertain terms that he should remain quiet about the alleged corruption because if it were to become public, it could bring down the current government of Mauritius.&lt;ref&gt;https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/08PORTLOUIS205_a.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Dutch dredging group Boskalis has been fined the equivalent of €1000 by a court in Mauritius for making illicit payments to a port official.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldcargonews.com/htm/w20131030.425720.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2016, the outgoing United States ambassador to Mauritius stated that there is so much turmoil at the Independent Commission Against Corruption that it has lost its credibility.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lexpress.mu/article/276477/icac-has-lost-all-credibility&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2016, the [[Independent Commission Against Corruption (Mauritius)|Independent Commission Against Corruption]] opened an investigation in the recruitment of the director of the [[Independent Broadcasting Authority (Mauritius)]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lexpress.mu/article/279621/recrutement-choomka-licac-en-scene&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 2016, the [[Independent Commission Against Corruption (Mauritius)|Independent Commission Against Corruption]] recommended formal proceedings against the former Minister of the Environment.&lt;ref&gt;http://defimedia.info/affaire-raj-dayal-licac-recommande-des-poursuites-formelles-contre-lancien-ministre&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2016, the representative of Cisco System filed suit against the National Computer Board and executives of the Mauritius Qualifications Authority.  It was alleged that a bribe is required for all government projects.&lt;ref&gt;http://defimedia.info/allegations-de-pot-de-vin-des-cadres-du-ncb-et-de-la-mqa-dans-le-collimateur-de-licac&lt;/ref&gt;

== Corruption levels ==
Some Mauritians are “traceurs” or “magouilleurs” par excellence – familiar examples being falsifying a home address to get a child into a perceived “star school”, bribing whoever it takes to pass a driving test.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lemauricien.com/article/icac-ten-years-%E2%80%93-why-we-are-still-champions-fraud-and-corruption&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Transparency International]], which measure the perceived level of public sector corruption and publish the annual [[Corruption Perception Index]] (CPI), in 2012, Mauritius scored 57 and is ranked 43rd (of 176) and 3rd in Africa.&lt;ref name="cpi"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cpi.transparency.org/cpi2012/results/|title=Full Table And Rankings|publisher=Transparency International|accessdate=4 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CPI rates countries from 0 ("highly corrupt") to 100 ("highly clean"), reflecting perceived levels of corruption.....

== Cases ==

In 2003, the former Housing and Lands Minister was arrested and charged with conspiracy to accept bribes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aljazeera.com/archive/2003/11/2008410134513839344.html&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007, a municipal councilor was stopped on suspicion of trading in influence.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lexpress.mu/article/la-conseill%C3%A8re-municipale-arr%C3%AAt%C3%A9e-licac-enqu%C3%AAte&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Alentaris selected the candidates for the job of director of the Independent Broadcasting Authority.

'''Cyrus S. Ching''' (May 21, 1876 &amp;ndash; December 27, 1967) was a [[Canadian-American]] who became an [[United States|American]] industrialist, federal civil servant, and noted [[trade union|labor union]] [[mediation|mediator]]. He was the first director of the [[Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (USA)|Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service]] (FMCS) and the [[Wage Stabilization Board]].

==Early life==
Ching was born on his father's farm in [[Prince Edward Island]], [[Canada]] on May 21, 1876.  The Chings were of [[Wales|Welsh]] heritage (the family name was originally spelled Chynge). He was the only boy in a family with eight children.&lt;ref name="Raskin"&gt;Raskin, "Cyrus S. Ching:  Pioneer in Industrial Peacemaking," ''Monthly Labor Review,'' August 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dies"&gt;"Cyrus Ching Dies," ''New York Times,'' December 28, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ching was educated in a [[one-room school]]house.  When he was 16, he was a spectator in a local courtroom, and the experience inspired him to become a lawyer. He attended [[Prince of Wales College]], a college preparatory academy, after a well-off uncle paid for his high school education.  He transferred to a local business college and studied [[bookkeeping]] and [[shorthand|stenography]].  In 1895, he left Prince Edward Island to work for an [[Alberta]]n [[grain elevator]] company.&lt;ref name="Raskin" /&gt;

On October 31, 1899, Ching moved to [[Boston, Massachusetts]], and took a job as a clerk with the [[Boston Elevated Railway|West End Street Railway]].&lt;ref name="Dies" /&gt; He became an instructor, teaching [[motorman|motormen]] how to operate the new [[rapid transit|elevated rail cars]]. In 1901, Ching was nearly electrocuted on the job while repairing a rail car.  Although he was expected to be blind and his face heavily scarred for life, he left the hospital after two months with only minimal scar damage to his hands. Since [[Massachusetts]] had yet to enact [[worker's compensation]] protection, Ching was fired by the company during his hospitalization. Afterward, however, the company rehired him—this time as a manager, training motormen on the city's [[tram|streetcars]].&lt;ref name="Raskin" /&gt; 

Ching became a [[naturalization|naturalized]] American citizen in 1909.&lt;ref name="Dies" /&gt;  In 1912, he obtained his [[Juris Doctor|law degree]] from the Evening Institute for Younger Men (now [[Northeastern University]]).&lt;ref name="Raskin" /&gt; The same year, he married the former Anna MacIntosh. After her death, Ching married Mildred Vergosen.&lt;ref name="Dies" /&gt;

==Industrial relations career==
While working for the public transit system, Ching witnessed the [[1912 Boston streetcar strike]]. Ching had warned management that 11 years of frozen wages, lack of communication and general disregard for workers' issues would lead to a [[strike action|strike]]. Management refused to heed his warnings. In June 1912, the [[Amalgamated Association of Street Car Employees]] struck the transit system. The [[Mayor]] of Boston, [[John "Honey Fitz" Fitzgerald]], and the [[Governor of Massachusetts]], [[Eugene Foss]], accused the president of the company of [[bribery|bribing]] state legislators to obtain favorable treatment. The president resigned, leading to an end to the strike in August 1912. The system's new president appointed Ching as company negotiator. Ching promised to end the use of [[labor spies|management spies]], which quickly led to a labor agreement. When the [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL) forced the Amalgamated to give up jurisdiction over 34 separate job titles to various [[craft unionism|craft unions]], Ching consented to the change—and negotiated another 34 labor contracts.&lt;ref name="Raskin" /&gt;

When the United States entered [[World War I]] in 1918, Ching attempted to enlist but was turned down because the military refused to induct anyone taller than 6'4" (Ching was 6'7").&lt;ref name="Dies" /&gt;  Rather than continue to work for the transit company, Ching went to work for the [[United States Rubber Company]] in 1919 as director of industrial relations.&lt;ref name="Dies" /&gt;  U.S. Rubber had 34 subsidiary units, most of which were independent. When employees assisted by the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW) engaged in a [[recognition strike]] at the company's Dominion Rubber unit in [[Montreal]], Ching convinced both Dominion and U.S. Rubber officials to agree to [[arbitration|binding arbitration]]. The workers subsequently rejected the IWW in favor of affiliating with the AFL.  Ching later secured company acquiescence in the formation of workers' councils in every U.S. Rubber factory. Yet Ching opposed widespread unionization of U.S. Rubber due to the AFL's insistence on [[craft unionism]].&lt;ref name="Raskin" /&gt;

Unions began forming in the American rubber industry after passage of the [[National Industrial Recovery Act]] in June 1933. [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]], [[Goodrich Corporation|B. F. Goodrich]], and [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]] all were quickly organized by the AFL. But workers at U.S. Rubber remained by and large satisfied with working conditions, and unionization made little inroad among company employees.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, ''American Rubber Workers and Organized Labor, 1900–1941,'' 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Ching, however, saw unionization coming.  Although the [[United Rubber Workers]] (URW) had made few inroads among the company's workers, Ching met with URW and [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (CIO) organizers and arranged for [[card check]] elections at U.S. Rubber factories. Unionization of the company proceeded without the acrimony observed at other rubber manufacturers, and contracts were quickly signed.&lt;ref name="Raskin" /&gt;

==Federal service==
Ching's career as a mediator began in 1941.  [[William S. Knudsen]], chairman of the [[National Defense Advisory Commission]], asked Ching to mediate a dispute at a [[Bethlehem Steel]] factory in upstate [[New York (state)|New York]]. When the union struck in February 1941, Bethlehem Steel executives demanded that the [[governor]] crush the strike using the [[New York Army National Guard]]. Ching not only refused to ask for military intervention, he demanded that Bethlehem Steel executives meet with him in [[Washington, D.C.]] At a meeting a few days later, Ching surprised the company by having [[Philip Murray]], president of the [[United Steelworkers of America]], and [[Sidney Hillman]], associate director of the [[Office of Production Management]] and a former CIO leader, at the meeting. Ching had won Murray's consent to a quick election at the plant. When the employer claimed the union effort was led by a mere handful of agitators, Ching demanded that the company prove its claim by holding a snap [[National Labor Relations Board]] election.  Management, its bluff called, reluctantly agreed. An election was held 10 days later which the union won by a vote of 75 percent to 25 percent. The strike ended, and a contract was  signed.&lt;ref name="Raskin" /&gt;

[[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] named Ching to the [[National Defense Mediation Board]] (NDMB) in early 1941.&lt;ref name="Raskin" /&gt;  The Board collapsed shortly before the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] after Ching and a majority of the Board's members voted against imposing the [[union shop]] on the "captive mines".&lt;ref&gt;The term "captive mines" referred to coal mines owned by steel companies, and whose coke and coal were sold solely to their owners for use in steelmaking.&lt;/ref&gt; A later panel overturned the ruling in 1942, but Ching continued to espouse a philosophy of consensual collective bargaining rather than government imposition in employer-union relations.&lt;ref&gt;Dubofsky and Van Tine, ''John L. Lewis: A Biography,'' 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

President Roosevelt then named Ching to the [[National War Labor Board (1942–1945)|War Labor Board]], the NDMB's successor.  He served from February 1942 to September 1943, then returned to U.S. Rubber. Ching retired from the company in August 1947.&lt;ref&gt;"Ching Made WLB Member," ''New York Times,'' November 11, 1942; "Resigns From War Labor Board," ''New York Times,'' September 2, 1943.&lt;/ref&gt;

Passage of the [[Taft-Hartley Act]] over President [[Harry S. Truman]]'s veto on June 23, 1947, established the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service as an independent agency. [[John R. Steelman]], [[Assistant to the President of the United States]] (the office later became the [[White House Chief of Staff]]), asked Ching to head up the new agency.  Ching initially refused, but Truman himself asked Ching to direct the new agency in order to forestall [[Congress of the United States|congressional]] opposition to funding the new agency.&lt;ref&gt;"C.S. Ching Is Sworn In as Mediation Chief," ''New York Times,'' September 6, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt; Ching served until the end of the Truman administration. During his time in office, Ching advised Truman to invoke the Taft-Hartley Act during a strike at the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] in December 1947, and mediated several important strikes—including the 1949 steel strike, the 1949 Hawaii dockworkers' strike, and several coal strikes.&lt;ref name="Raskin" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stark, "Union Postpones Oak Ridge Strike," ''New York Times,'' December 9, 1947; "Bargaining Averts Atom Plant Tie-Up," ''Associated Press,'' June 14, 1948; "Ching Offers Ideas for Hawaii Accord," ''New York Times,'' September 9, 1949; "Hawaii Walkout Resists Mediator," ''New York Times,'' September 11, 1949; Loftus, "Lewis, Here, Shuns Mediation In Coal," ''New York Times,'' November 11, 1949; Stark, "Coal Dispute Goes to President," ''New York Times,'' June 19, 1948; Loftus, "Steelman, Ching to Review Strikes," ''New York Times,'' October 25, 1949.&lt;/ref&gt; He also spent much of his time fighting off attempts to put FMCS back under the authority of the [[United States Department of Labor]].&lt;ref&gt;Stark, "Ching Assails Plan to Shift Mediation," ''New York Times,'' February 2, 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ching took a leave of absence from FMCS in October 1950 to head the [[Wage Stabilization Board]], a [[Korean War]]-era agency created in September 1950 to limit wage increases and help stabilize the economy as defense mobilization ramped upward. He was the agency's first director. He quit the Board in April 1951 when President Truman reconstituted the panel, and returned to FMCS.&lt;ref&gt;Loftus, "Ching Named Head of New Wage Unit," ''New York Times,'' October 11, 1950; Loftus, "Ching Quits Post In Pay Stabilizing," ''New York Times,'' April 21, 1951; Marcus, ''Truman and the Steel Seizure Case: The Limits of Presidential Power,'' 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

After departing FMCS in September 1952,&lt;ref&gt;"President Accepts Ching Resignation," ''New York Times,'' September 16, 1952.&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] asked Ching to lead a panel which would arbitrate labor disputes at Oak Ridge.&lt;ref&gt;"Ching Due to Head Atom Labor Panel," ''United Press International,'' May 24, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt; Ching agreed, and remained head of the arbitration panel until his death.&lt;ref name="Raskin" /&gt;

==Retirement, honors, death==
Cyrus Ching published his memoirs, ''Review and Reflection: A Half Century of Labor Relations,'' in 1953.  He received an honorary degree from [[Bowdoin College]] the same year.&lt;ref&gt;"Nine Honored At Bowdoin," ''New York Times,'' June 21, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt; A partial scholarship was endowed in 1956 in honor of Ching at the [[Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations]].

In 1961, the Dept. of Labor presented Ching with its Award of Merit for his service in labor-management relations.&lt;ref&gt;"Ching Honored At 85," ''New York Times,'' May 21, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ching died at his home in Washington, D.C., of a heart attack on December 27, 1967. At his death, [[AFL-CIO]] president [[George Meany]] noted, "He contributed as much to the cause of industrial peace and labor-management understanding as any man of his generation."&lt;ref name="Dies" /&gt;

Ching was inducted into the Labor Department's [[Labor Hall of Honor]] in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;"Labor Department Dedicates Hall of Fame," ''Associated Press,'' January 11, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2304">'''Democrats for Responsibility, Solidarity and Tolerance''' ({{lang-bg|Демократи за отговорност, свобода и толерантност}}, '''ДОСТ/DOST''') is a [[liberalism|liberal]] and [[centrism|centrist]] [[list of political parties in Bulgaria|political party in Bulgaria]], mainly representing the [[Bulgarian Turks|Turkish minority]]. The party is led by [[Lyutvi Mestan]].

Mestan, a long-time politician and member of the [[National Assembly (Bulgaria)|National Assembly of Bulgaria]] for [[9th MMC – Kardzhali|Kardzhali]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://openparliament.net/deputies/view-1677 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503083652/http://openparliament.net/deputies/view-1677 |archivedate=2014-05-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; served as chairman of the [[Movement for Rights and Freedoms]] (DPS), the main Turkish party in Bulgaria, from January 2013 to 24 December 2015. He was removed as party leader by the DPS central council and expelled from the party for what was considered an excessively pro-Turkish government stance following the [[2015 Russian Sukhoi Su-24 shootdown|downing of a Russian bomber jet by the Turkish Air Force]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novinite.com/articles/172378/Bulgaria%27s+%3Cb%3EDPS%3C/b%3E+Party+Expels+Chairman+Lyutvi+Mestan|title=Bulgaria's DPS Party Expels Chairman Lyutvi Mestan|publisher=Sofia News Agency|website=novinite.com|date=24 December 2015|accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mestan and his followers within the DPS subsequently founded a new party, DOST.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=173311 |title= Ousted Leader of Bulgaria’s DPS Lyutvi Mestan Launches DOST Political Project| publisher=Novinite |date=2016-02-27|accessdate=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Bulgarian parliamentary election, 2017|2017 parliamentary election]] the party obtained 2.9% of the vote (21.6% in Kardzhali) and no seat as it failed to meet the 4% [[electoral threshold]].

The agreements followed a 30-year conflict known as [[the Troubles]], which claimed over 3,500 lives. During the conflict, republican paramilitary groups such as the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] waged a campaign to bring about a [[united Ireland|united Irish republic]]. Peace negotiations in the 1990s led to an IRA ceasefire in 1994 and to the [[Good Friday Agreement]] of 1998. Mainstream republicans, represented by [[Sinn Féin]], supported the Agreement as a means of achieving Irish unity peacefully. 'Dissidents' saw this as an abandonment of republican ideals and acceptance of [[partition of Ireland|partition]] and British rule. They hold that the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] and [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] (PSNI) are illegitimate and see the PSNI as a "British paramilitary police force".

Some dissident republican political groups, such as [[Republican Sinn Féin]] (which was established by a split from Sinn Féin, and no longer has a connection to the party) and the [[32 County Sovereignty Movement]], support [[political violence]] against the British security forces. Thus, they oppose the Provisional IRA's 1994 ceasefire.

However, other groups, such as [[éirígí]] and the [[Republican Network for Unity]], wish to achieve their goals only through peaceful means.

Since the IRA called a ceasefire, splinter groups have [[Dissident Irish Republican campaign|continued an armed campaign]] against the British security forces in Northern Ireland. Like the Provisional IRA, each of these groups sees itself as the only rightful successor of the [[Irish Republican Army (1919–22)|original IRA]] and each calls itself simply "the IRA", or ''[[Óglaigh na hÉireann]]'' in Irish (see also [[Irish republican legitimism]]).

'''Farakka Barrage''' is a [[Barrage (dam)|barrage]] across the [[Ganges River]], located in [[Murshidabad district|Murshidabad]] district in the [[India]]n state of [[West Bengal]], roughly {{convert|16.5|km|mi}} from the border with [[Bangladesh]] near Chapai [[Nawabganj District]]. [[Farakka Barrage Township]] is located in [[Farakka (community development block)]] in Murshidabad district. Construction was started in 1961 and completed in 1975 at a cost of {{INRConvert|156.49|c|to=USD}}. Operations began on 21 April 1975. The barrage is about {{convert|2240|m}} long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Farakka Barrage Project Farakka |url=http://mowr.gov.in/index3.asp?sslid=296&amp;subsublinkid=714&amp;langid=1 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428204901/http://mowr.gov.in/index3.asp?subsublinkid=714&amp;langid=1&amp;sslid=296 |archivedate=2012-04-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Feeder Canal (Farakka)]] from the barrage to the [[Hooghly River|Bhagirathi-Hooghly River]] is about {{convert|25|mi|km}} long.&lt;ref name="SalmanUprety2002"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Salman|first1=Salman M.

== Purpose ==
The barrage was constructed by [[Hindustan Construction Company]]. Out of 109 gates, 108 are over the river and the 109th one over the low-lying land in [[English Bazar|Malda]], as a precaution. The Barrage serves water to the [[Farakka Super Thermal Power Station]]. There are also sixty small canals which can divert some water to other destinations for drinking purposes etc.

The purpose of the barrage is to divert {{convert|40000|cuft/s|m3/s|order=flip}} of water from the Ganges to the Hooghly River for flushing out the sediment deposition from the [[Port of Kolkata|Kolkata harbour]] without the need of regular mechanical dredging. After commissioning the project, it was found that the diverted water flow from the Farakka barrage was not adequate to flush the sediment from the river satisfactorily. In addition, there are regular land/bank collapses in to the Ganga river due to the high level back waters of the Farakka barrage. Substantial high land is already converted into low level river bed causing displacement of huge population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gangapedia.iitk.ac.in/sites/default/files/Rudra.pdf |title=The Encroaching Ganga and Social Conflicts: The Case of West Bengal, India. |accessdate=23 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140523010822/http://gangapedia.iitk.ac.in/sites/default/files/Rudra.pdf |archivedate=23 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The water diverted from the Farakka barrage is less than 10% of Ganga river water available at Farakka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.compositerunoff.sr.unh.edu/html/Polygons/P2846800.html |title=  Ganga river water flow data at Farakka, India.|accessdate=26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian government is contemplating to cement line/widen/deepen the Farakka feeder canal to increase the flow.

==Farakka water sharing treaty==
As per the treaty between India and Bangladesh, signed in 1996, for sharing of the Ganges water at Farakka, the division is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ssvk.org/koshi/reports/treaty_on_farakka_india_bangladesh_4_ganga_river_water.pdf | title = Treaty between the Government of the Republic of India and the Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh on sharing of the Ganga/ Ganges waters at Farakka | publisher = ssvk| accessdate = 12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
The [[Ganges]] is one of the major rivers of the world. It rises at an elevation of about {{convert|12,769|ft|m}} in Gangotri on the southern slope of the Himalayan range. About one third of the total population of Bangladesh and about 50% of the Indian population live in the Ganges basin; 43% of the total irrigated area in the country{{which|date=October 2018}} is also in the Ganges basin and there are about 100 urban settlements with a total population of about 120 million on its banks. As a result, [[Bangladesh]] and [[India]] have had many debates about how the Farakka Barrage cuts off Bangladesh's water supply and how to [[sharing the water of the Ganges|share the water]]. Right from the beginning, this created a concern for Bangladesh as it constitutes the low-lying part of Gangotri. After the completion of the barrage at the end of 1975, it was agreed to run it with specified discharges for a period of 41 days from 21 April to 31 May during the remaining period of the dry season of 1975 under an accord announced as a joint press release on 18 April 1975. But after the assassination of [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] on 15 August 1975, relations between the two countries became greatly strained and India continued to withdraw water even after the agreed period. The diversions led to a crisis situation in Bangladesh in the dry season of 1976. In 1977, Bangladesh went to the [[United Nations]] and lodged a formal protest against India with the General Assembly of The United Nations, which adopted a consensus statement on 26 November 1976. Talks between the two countries were resumed in December 1976. No consensus was reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Abbas |first=B. M. |date=1984 |orig-year=First published 1982 |title=The Ganges Water Dispute |edition=2nd |location=Dhaka |publisher=University Press |pages=5, 9, 10 |oclc=20820859}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twenty years later, in 1996, a 30-year agreement was signed. It did not contain any guarantee clause for unconditional minimum amounts of water to be supplied to Bangladesh or India, nor could the future hydrological parameters taken into account as is always the case when water resources are planned on historic data series. As a result, the agreement is sometimes perceived to be failed by some sections in Bangladesh to provide the expected result.&lt;ref&gt;Nurul Kobir, a journalist of Bangladesh on first day of India-Bangladesh dialogue held 7–8 November on Dhaka&lt;/ref&gt;  Constant monitoring of the implementation of Negotiations in lean season continue to the present today. In Bangladesh, it is perceived that the diversion has raised salinity levels, contaminated fisheries, hindered navigation, and posed a threat to water quality and public health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wolf |first=Aaron T. |date=2001 |title=Water and Human Security |url=http://ucowr.org/files/Achieved_Journal_Issues/V118_A5Water%20and%20Human%20Security.pdf |journal=Journal of Contemporary Water Research and Education |volume=118 |page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lower levels of soil moisture along with increased salinity have also led to desertification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Islam |first=Nahid |date=1992 |title=Indo-Bangladesh Common Rivers: The Impact on Bangladesh |journal=Contemporary South Asia |publisher= |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=203–225 |doi=10.1080/09584939208719682}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this barrage still has significant effect on the mutual relation of these two neighboring countries.

Farakka barrage has been criticized for the [[floods in Bihar]] as it is causing excessive siltation in the Ganga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scroll.in/article/815066/over-50-years-ago-bengals-chief-engineer-predicted-that-the-farakka-dam-would-flood-bihar|title=Over 50 years ago, Bengal’s chief engineer predicted that the Farakka dam would flood Bihar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Fatherland League''' ({{lang-no|Fedrelandslaget}}) was a Norwegian [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]], [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] political organisation in the [[interwar period]]. Founded in 1925, the movement aimed to unite all centre-to-right forces against the rise of the [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary Marxist labour movement]]. At its peak of popular support and political influence around 1930 it was the single largest mass movement ever organised on the political right in Norway, with an estimated 100,000 members.&lt;ref name=snl/&gt; The movement began to decline through the 1930s, followed by some unsuccessful attempts to gain direct influence as a political party. The Fatherland League was banned and dissolved after the [[German occupation of Norway]] in 1940.

==History==

===Mass movement===
[[File:Fridtjof Nansen on a lecturing tour for Fedrelandslaget.jpg|thumb|Nansen on his 1929 campaign tour on the ship ''Stella Polaris'', with rallies held from [[Bergen]] to [[Nordkapp]].]]
[[File:Haukeliseter, Fridtjof Nansen på talerstolen, Kyrkeneset - no-nb digifoto 20150121 00225 NB MIT FNR 19772.jpg|thumb|Rally in rural [[Haukeli]]seter, with speech by Nansen ("N"). It was often the first centre-right group to establish local activity in more remote places.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = Norland, Andreas | authorlink= Andreas Norland|year = 1973 | title = Hårde tider: Fedrelandslaget i norsk politikk | isbn = 8209011065 | publisher = Dreyer | url = http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2012050208007 | page = 86|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
By the initiative of young industrialist [[Joakim Lehmkuhl]], the organisation was co-founded with national hero [[Fridtjof Nansen]] and Norway's first Prime Minister [[Christian Michelsen]].&lt;ref name="Garau"/&gt;&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite web|first1=Daniel|last1=Sjulseth|first2=Francis|last2=Sejersted|authorlink2=Francis Sejersted|url=http://www.snl.no/Fedrelandslaget|work=[[Store norske leksikon]]|title=Fedrelandslaget|date=13 April 2015|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Prime Minister [[Jens Bratlie]] also joined the organisation.&lt;ref name="Blinkhorn"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norland (1973) p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The Fatherland League's goal was a national coalition of all centre-to-right "bourgeoise" (''borgerlige'') and nationally minded forces, in opposition to the emerging revolutionary Marxist labour movement.&lt;ref name=snl/&gt;&lt;ref name="krigsleksikon"&gt;{{Cite web |first=Øystein |last=Sørensen|authorlink=Øystein Sørensen |title=Fedrelandslaget |work=Norsk krigsleksikon 1940-45 |year=1995 |language=Norwegian |url=http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2010113005006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation gained particular support from the [[Free-minded Liberal Party]] and the [[Centre Party (Norway)|Farmers' Party]], while it was met with scepticism by the [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]], and largely rejection by the [[Liberal Party (Norway)|Liberal Party]].&lt;ref name=snl/&gt; The labour movement in turn saw the organisation as a "seeding ground" for a [[Fascism|fascist]] movement.&lt;ref name=snl/&gt;

After the government crisis of 1926 and continued division among the centre-right parties, a "Nansen-petition" was launched by several influential people of different political backgrounds for a [[national unity government]] to be led by Nansen, an idea that was eventually endorsed by Nansen himself and by Lehmkuhl.&lt;ref name="Norland52"&gt;Norland (1973) pp. 52–62.&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal fell through as Conservative and Liberal politicians reacted coldly to the idea, and quickly came to a new government agreement.&lt;ref name="Norland52"/&gt;

Following a strong surge of support and victory for the [[Labour Party (Norway)|Labour Party]] (which had adopted a [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary ideology]] in 1918) in the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 1927|1927 parliamentary election]], the Fatherland League launched a "thousand day's election campaign" towards the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 1930|1930 parliamentary election]], a period which is considered the most important and successful in the history of the movement.&lt;ref name=snl/&gt; The 1930 election resulted in Labour Party setbacks amid record voter turnouts, which the League assigned to its own credit, a view that was echoed by the Labour Party's [[Haakon Lie]] and [[Halvard Lange]].&lt;ref&gt;Norland (1973) p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation peaked the same year with around 100,000 members and more than 400 local chapters.&lt;ref name=capx&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caplex.no/Web/ArticleView.aspx?id=9310142|work=Caplex|title=Fedrelandslaget|accessdate=26 February 2011|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=arblex&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Fedrelandslaget |encyclopedia=[[Arbeidernes Leksikon]]|editor1=[[Jakob Friis|Friis, Jacob]] |editor2=[[Trond Hegna|Hegna, Trond]] |publisher=Arbeidermagasinets forlag |location=Oslo |volume=2 |year=1933|language=Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Party attempt and decline===
Increasingly seen as a political rival rather than a unifying force by the centre-right parties,&lt;ref&gt;Norland (1973) p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; the organisation effectively reorganised into a political party in 1933 after pressure from its young activists.&lt;ref&gt;Norland (1973) pp. 226–228.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time it launched a more radical political program titled "A Norwegian program", and entered into secret, eventually unsuccessful negotiations of a "national block" with the Farmers' Party and the Free-minded People's Party (and briefly [[Nasjonal Samling]] which dropped out as it did not consider itself a ''borgerlig'' party).&lt;ref name=snl/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norland (1973) pp. 232–259.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the onset of the [[Great Depression]], Lehmkuhl and the party developed an economic ideology in part inspired by the American [[New Deal]] social program, emphasising a more [[planned economy]].&lt;ref name="Garau"/&gt;&lt;ref name=snl/&gt; For the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 1936|1936 parliamentary election]] the party contested electoral lists in a few districts, both independently and together with the Free-minded, but did not win any representation.&lt;ref name=snl/&gt;

The group declined in the late 1930s, partly due to the Labour Party abandoning its revolutionary ideology dating from 1918, and partly as an effect of the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]]-friendly attitude exhibited by several of its leading members as segments of the movement came under the influence of Italian fascism and German national socialism.&lt;ref name=snl/&gt;&lt;ref name="krigsleksikon"/&gt; In 1933, in response to the labour movement's long-standing use of uniforms, some of its young members marched in "greyshirts" for the first time at a local rally after the uniform had been launched by the party newspaper ''ABC''.&lt;ref name="Norland216"&gt;Norland (1973) pp. 216–217.&lt;/ref&gt; While the labour movement's uniforms had been tolerated for years, political use of uniforms was swiftly banned by the Liberal government the day after the rally.&lt;ref name="Norland216"/&gt; After the [[Norwegian Campaign|German invasion of Norway]] in April 1940, the remnants of the organisation attempted to establish a political alternative against the [[Quisling regime]]. The new chairman, [[Victor Mogens]]' secret talks and negotiations with the Germans remained unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="krigsleksikon"/&gt; The organisation, like all other parties but Nasjonal Samling, was banned by Reichskommissar [[Josef Terboven]] on 25 September 1940.&lt;ref name=snl/&gt;

The Fatherland League was not reorganised after the war.&lt;ref name=snl/&gt; As the archives of the organisation were burned after its dissolution, limited historical material remains of it despite being the single largest mass movement ever organised on the political right in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;Norland (1973) p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anders Lange]], founder of the modern [[Progress Party (Norway)|Progress Party]] was active as the secretary of the organisation in [[Kristiansand]] and in [[Oslo]] until 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Anders Lange|url=https://nbl.snl.no/Anders_Lange|work=Norsk biografisk leksikon|date=13 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16399">The '''[[American Revolutionary War]]''' inflicted great '''financial costs''' on all of the combatants, including the United States of America, France, Spain and Great Britain. France and Great Britain spent 1.3 billion ''[[French livre|livres]]'' and 250 million [[Pound sterling|pounds]], respectively. The United States spent $400 million in wages for its troops. Spain increased its military spending from 454 million ''[[Spanish real|reales]]'' in 1778 to over 700 million ''reales'' in 1779.

==Economic warfare and financing==
[[File:Boston Tea Party w.jpg|left|thumb|350 px|The [[Boston Tea Party]], an early American boycott of British goods which resulted in increased tensions prior to the Revolution.]]

===Initial boycotts===
The economic warfare between Great Britain and the colonists began well before the colonies declared their independence in 1776. Regulations from the crown were met with fierce opposition from the colonists.  After lobbies and petitions proved ineffective, the colonists turned to boycotting imported English goods.  Boycotting proved to be successful in crippling British trade.&lt;ref&gt;Baack, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;   After the first colonial boycott in 1765, Parliament overturned the Sugar and Stamp Acts, and after a second boycott in 1768 Parliament overturned all of the Townshend duties except for the tax on tea.&lt;ref&gt;Baack, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The colonists persisted, and the American boycott on tea ultimately culminated in the Boston Tea Party of 1773. Despite the Revolution's widespread association with the colonists' aversion to higher taxes, it has been claimed that the colonists actually paid far less tax compared to their British counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

===British isolation tactics===
British efforts to weaken the colonies included isolating their economy from the rest of the world by cutting off trade.  With a navy that was many times more powerful than its American counterpart, the English had complete  control over the American ports.&lt;ref&gt;Baack, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;   The British took control of major port cities along the colonial east coast, and as a result British warships were able to drastically reduce the number of ships that could successfully travel from the colonies.  Consequently, the U.S. saw a fall in exported goods due to the relentless British blockade.&lt;ref&gt;"Economic Conditions During the War."&lt;/ref&gt;   Furthermore, England’s naval strength was great enough to intimidate other nations and scare them away from exporting goods to the colonies, so smuggled and inexpensive imports became costly and rare.&lt;ref&gt;"Economic Conditions During the War."&lt;/ref&gt;

===The American response===
The Continental Army under the direction of George Washington sought to engage in a war of attrition.&lt;ref&gt;Baack, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;   Because the fight was on colonial soil, Washington aimed to take advantage of the lack of trade with Great Britain by cutting them off from necessary resources, hoping that eventually the redcoat army in North America would grow sick and tired.  Under the Articles of Confederation, however, the Continental Congress did not have the power to impose taxes or regulate commerce in the colonies, and thus could not generate the sufficient funds for a war of attrition.&lt;ref&gt;Baack, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

To solve this problem, the Continental Congress sent diplomats including Benjamin Franklin to Europe in search of foreign support for the American cause.  For the first two years of war, the colonists received secretive private and public loans from the French, who held a lingering resentment for the British after the Seven Years' War.&lt;ref&gt;"Economic Conditions During the War."&lt;/ref&gt;   After the British defeat at Saratoga, however, foreign support for the Continental Army increased, and in 1778 the colonies signed a treaty with France, officially bringing them into the war with England.&lt;ref&gt;Elson, 1904.&lt;/ref&gt;   By the end of the war, the colonies had received loans from several different European nations, including significant contribution from France, Spain and the Netherlands.  In addition, the colonies received much private funding, most notably from the Marquis de Lafayette and the Baron of Kalb, both Frenchmen.&lt;ref&gt;Elson, 1904.&lt;/ref&gt;   This funding ultimately enabled them to fight the war of attrition that General Washington hoped for.

===The American Revolution's effect on Great Britain===
[[File:BattleOfVirginiaCapes.jpg|thumb|right|350 px|French warships during the American Revolutionary War.]]
Because the French possessed a powerful navy, their entrance into the war weakened the British blockade on colonial ports and further cut off the British army from its Atlantic supply route.&lt;ref&gt;Conway, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;   The British forces recognized that they would not last long without shipping in supplies, so in retaliation, the British redeployed some of their forces to the French Caribbean.  Their hope was to capture French sugar islands and cut the French financial supply line.&lt;ref&gt;Conway, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;   The new war in the Caribbean added to England’s already large financial costs, yet unlike the colonies, the British were not successful in their attempts to garner foreign loans or armaments.  Without economic assistance from other nations, the financial strain on Parliament and British taxpayers became increasingly burdensome, and ultimately had a hand in wearing down the British forces and ending the war for independence.

===American financing===
As the war progressed, the Americans’ deteriorating financial stability quickly became Britain’s greatest asset.  Because it did not possess the power to tax the colonists, the Continental Congress printed money at a rapid rate to fund the army’s expenses and pay off its loans from foreign nations.&lt;ref&gt;Baack, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;   As a result, the colonies experienced severe inflation and depreciation of the Continental dollar.  The colonists also had great difficulty in financing a wartime effort against the British southern campaign, not effectively halting the British destruction until the battle of Yorktown in 1781.  When war ended in 1783, American negotiations, monetary policies and government restructuring all contributed to paying off the American national debt.&lt;ref&gt;Baack, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Belligerents==

===Great Britain===
The American Revolutionary War took a heavy toll on Great Britain. The average cost for the war was [[Pound sterling|£]]12 million a year. The British ended the war with a [[national debt]] of £250 million, which generated a yearly interest of over £9.5 million (3.8 percent). This debt piled on to the already outstanding debt from the [[Seven Years' War]]. Taxes on the British population increased over the years and duties on some items such as glass and lead were also added, the average tax for the British public being four [[shilling]]s in every [[Pound sterling|pound]] (20 percent).&lt;ref&gt;Conway (1995) p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the [[Royal Navy]] was not able to 'rule the waves' as it had done in the Seven Years' War.&lt;ref&gt;Marston (2002) p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;

Great Britain's trade with the thirteen American colonies fell apart once the [[American Revolution]] started, causing British businessmen, especially from the tobacco industry, to suffer. Income from the sale of woolen and metal products dropped sharply and export markets dried up. British merchant sailors also felt the pinch: it is estimated that 3,386 British merchant ships were seized by enemy forces during the war.&lt;ref&gt;Conway (1995) p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; However, Royal Navy warships did make up these losses somewhat, due to their own [[privateer]]ing efforts on enemy shipping, particularly Spanish and French merchant ships.

===France===
During the war, France shouldered a financial burden similar to that of Great Britain, as debt from the American Revolutionary War was piled upon already existing debts from the [[Seven Years' War]]. The French spent 1.3 billion ''[[French livre|livres]]'' on war costs. When the war ended, France had accumulated a debt of 3,315.1 million ''livres'',&lt;ref&gt;Conway (1995) p. 242&lt;/ref&gt; a fortune at the time.

The debt caused major economic and political problems for France, and, as the country struggled to pay its debts, eventually led to the Financial Crisis of 1786&lt;ref&gt;Marston (2002) p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[French Revolution]] in 1789.&lt;ref&gt;Tombs (2007) p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain===
Spain's economic losses were not as great as those of the other belligerents in the American Revolutionary War. This was because Spain paid off her debts quickly and efficiently. However, Spain had nearly doubled her military spending during the war, from 454 million ''[[Spanish real|reales]]'' in 1778 to over 700 million ''reales'' in 1779.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch (1989) p. 326&lt;/ref&gt; Spain's revenue loss was similar to Britain's, since she lost a lot of income from her American colonies due to the war. To make up for the shortfall, Spanish governors introduced higher tax rates in the South American colonies, with little success.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} Spain's next move was to issue royal bonds to her colonies, also with limited success.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} Finally, in 1782 the first national bank of Spain – the [[Banco San Carlo]] – was created to improve and centralize the economic situation.{{Vague|date=January 2012}}&lt;!-- how does one centralize a situation? --&gt;

===United States of America===
''For more details on the impact on the United States, see [[Economic history of the United States#The American Revolution and the new nation|Economic history of the US]]''.

The thirteen American states flourished economically at the beginning of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Marston (2002) p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; The colonies could trade freely with the [[West Indies]] and other European nations, instead of just Britain. Due to the abolition of the British Navigation Acts, American merchants could now transport their goods in European and American ships rather than only British ships. British taxes on expensive wares such as tea, glass, lead and paper were forfeit, and other taxes became cheaper. Plus, American privateering raids on British merchant ships provided more wealth for the [[Continental Army]].

As the war went on however, America's economic prosperity began to fall. British warships began to prey on American shipping, and the increasing upkeep costs of the Continental Army meant that wealth from merchant ships decreased. As cashflow declined, the United States of America had to rely on European loans to maintain the war effort; France, Spain and the Netherlands lent the United States over $10 million during the war, causing major debt problems for the fledgling nation. Coin circulation had also begun to wane. Because of this, the United States began to print paper money and bills of credit to raise income. This proved unsuccessful, inflation skyrocketed, and the new paper money's value diminished. A popular saying circulated the colonies because of this: anything of little value became "not worth a [[continental dollar|continental]]."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://myloc.gov/Exhibitions/creatingtheus/Constitution/RoadtotheConstitution/ExhibitObjects/NotWorthAContinental.aspx Not worth a continental] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120709095712/http://myloc.gov/Exhibitions/creatingtheus/Constitution/RoadtotheConstitution/ExhibitObjects/NotWorthAContinental.aspx |date=2012-07-09 }}", "Creating the United States", Library of Congress. Retrieved 14 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2010 [[Congressional Research Service]] report on the "Costs of Major U.S. Wars", the Revolution cost the United States the 2011 equivalent of $2.4 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RS22926.pdf|title=Costs of Major U.S. Wars|author=Stephen Daggett|publisher=Congressional Research Service|date=June 29, 2010|accessdate=April 25, 2017|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Inflation ====
By 1780, the United States Congress had issued over $400 million in paper money to troops. Eventually, Congress tried to stop the inflation by imposing economic reforms. These failed, and only further devalued the American currency.&lt;ref&gt;Marston (2002) p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; There is, however, some disagreement over the amount of currency issued.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grubb|first=Farley|year=2007|title=The Continental Dollar: How Much Was Really Issued?|url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/6708312.pdf|journal=National Bureau of Economic Research.|volume=No. w13047|pages=|quote=The story of the Continental Dollar is familiar to all -- a lot were issued and hyper-inflation ensued. However, the details of this story are less well known. Scholars even disagree over how much was issued -- disagree by over 50 percent.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between [[American Revolutionary War|1775 and 1783]] the colonies experienced an average annual inflation rate of approximately 4.3%. The rate of inflation peaked at 29.78% in 1778.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.measuringworth.com/calculators/inflation/index.php|title=Annual Inflation Rates in the United States, 1775 - 2016, and United Kingdom, 1265 - 2016|last=Williamson|first=Samuel H.|date=|website=www.measuringworth.com|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.in2013dollars.com/1775-dollars-in-1783?amount=100|title=In 2013 Dollars|last=|first=|date=|website=www.in2013dollars.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous food riots were recorded as discontent grew over rapidly rising prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Barbara Clark|date=1994-01-01|title=Food Rioters and the American Revolution|jstor=2947003|journal=The William and Mary Quarterly|volume=51|issue=1|pages=3–38|doi=10.2307/2947003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The destruction of property and the continued issuing of Continentals by the Congress was another cause of currency devaluation. In addition, counterfeiting of American dollars was carried out by the British Government as an intentional means of sabotaging the war effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eh.net/encyclopedia/the-economics-of-the-american-revolutionary-war/|title=The Economics of the American Revolutionary War|website=eh.net|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in the war, Congress asked individual colonies to equip their own troops, and pay upkeep for their own soldiers in the Continental Army. When the war ended, the United States had spent $37 million at the national level and $114 million at the state level. The United States finally solved its debt problems in the 1790s when [[Alexander Hamilton]] founded the [[First Bank of the United States]] in order to pay off war debts and establish good national credit.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen (2004) p. 379&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Global Reach''' refers to a business initiative to increase the access between a company and their current and potential customers through the use of the [[Internet]]. The Internet allows the company to market themselves and attract new customers to their website where they can provide product information and better customer service.  Customers can place orders electronically, therefore reducing expensive long distant phone calls and postage costs of placing orders, while saving time on behalf of the customer and company.

A company striving to obtain Global Reach should provide a [[code of ethics]], a company purchasing policy, additional contact information, adequate product information and price.  The website itself should be multi-lingual, easy-to-use, and have the ability to secure customer information.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haag|first1=Steven|last2=Cummings|first2=Maeve|last3=J. McCubbrey|first3=Donald|last4=Pinsonneault|first4=Alain|last5=Donovan|first5=Richard|title=Management Information Systems for the Information Age, 3/e|date=2006|publisher=McGraw-Hill Ryerson Higher Education|page=163|edition=3rd Canadian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact of Globalisation ==

The prominence of global reach comes as a result of [[globalisation]] which has seen the indefinite increase in worldwide communication. The term ‘global reach’ which refers to this communication is suggestive of the fact that firms are increasingly looking to expand overseas by connecting with customers that they may otherwise have been unable to.&lt;ref name="The Impact of Globalisation on Cross-Cultural Communication" group=The Impact of Globalisation on Cross-Cultural Communication&gt;{{cite journal|last1=C. Matthews|first1=Lowell|last2=S. Thakkar|first2=Bhakar|title=The Impact of Globalisation on Cross-Cultural Communication}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relentless innovation of [[technology]] is allowing companies to become “more global in their activities…as capital moves more freely across borders".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Porter|first1=Michael|title=On Competition: Updated and Extended Edition|date=2013|publisher=Harvard Business Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now, many companies have adapted their online forums such as websites to appeal to their growing global [[customer base]]. The internet has been key in growing [[advertising]] for firms. The online forum has often proven to be cheaper for establishments than billboard or television advertising as was common before the substantial increase in technology as a means of business expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=23 Ways Your Business Can Use the Internet|url=http://www.skipechert.com/23ways.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to statistics, global internet usage has increased from c.8 in 2001 to c40.4 inhabitants per 100 in 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Telecommunication/ICT Indicators Database|url=http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Pages/stat/default.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that the market reachable by companies via the internet has grown.

== A Means of Business Growth ==

Global Reach acts as a medium through which firms can expand beyond the region of their setup. The concept has meant that smaller firms are able to use the internet to reach markets that would only have been available to the larger firms before. The modern ability and desire of companies to grow globally means that [[management]] teams are tasked with monitoring teams and employees who may be based abroad. Global Reach refers to the growing need for communication between these firm factions. While telephone calls are common, firms are increasingly turning to emails namely for time [[efficiency]] which allows business to grow as it becomes faster to carry out requests of customers and executives within the company. The time efficiency involved in online [[communication]] between the firm and customers and transactions allows for business to move faster and for companies to concentrate their energy in other sectors. With the economic environment constantly altering, businesses need to find ways to move forward alongside new technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Global Reach Development|url=http://global-reach.co.uk/about/}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, failing to keep up with technological advances can cause firms to lose out to competitors which may use these technical benefits more efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vitez|first1=Osmond|title=The Effect of the Internet on Modern Businesses &amp; Corporations|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/effect-internet-modern-businesses-corporations-896.html|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wider Benefits ==

Whilst the above improvements have proven vital and beneficial to firms, consumers have also enjoyed the rewards of such expansion through cheaper pricing due to increased [[competition]], access to a wider array of goods and better quality products due to the ability of firms to contact a bigger range of suppliers. Popular online sale sites which have become a staple of the internet due to Global Reach initiatives has also allowed the general public to access foreign markets, most commonly those of small home-run firms. The economic concept of the multiplier affect applies in some such cases as domestic markets can prosper directly through the opportunities provided by Global Reach. Firms have also embraced the internet to enabling the user to access their websites in several languages and in cases of [[online retail]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ramanathan|first1=Arundhati|last2=Dhanjal|first2=Swaraj|last3=Joshi|first3=Malvika|title=Surviving the online retail boom|url=http://www.livemint.com/Industry/RHgMBJlKHTiJDMNK5hjmLK/Surviving-the-online-retail-boom.html|website=live mint|publisher=live mint|date=28 October 2014|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing the customer to view the products with the price tag in the appropriate currency. Businesses can use the internet to come closer to their customers. Most firm websites provide contact information for its users allowing consumers unprecedented access into the firm, helping the business to establish a loyal consumer base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=C. Kooser|first1=Amanda|title=How Does Technology Improve a Business?|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/technology-improve-business-2188.html|website=Chron|publisher=Demand Media|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Other small businesses can also benefit from one firm’s decision to move forward technologically. The internet allows businesses to publish its information to be available on a public front, potentially aiding start-up firms to review potential aims and target market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Benkler|first1=Yochai|title=Change: 19 Key Essays on How the Internet Is Changing Our Lives|date=1 February 2014|publisher=Turner Publicaciones, S.L.|location=Distributed Innovation and Creativity, Peer Production, and Commons in Networked Economy|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Especially relevant in the face of emerging concerns for [[climate change]], businesses are under pressure to look forward to more environmentally [[sustainable]] means of growth, for example the availability of [[email]] as a means of contact reduces the environmental strain on paper use.

[[Image:GPWSMode2.svg|thumb]]
A '''Ground Proximity Warning System''' ('''GPWS''') is a system designed to alert [[aircraft pilot|pilots]] if their aircraft is in immediate danger of [[controlled flight into terrain|flying into the ground]] or an obstacle. The United States [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) defines GPWS as a type of [[terrain awareness warning system]] (TAWS).&lt;ref name="faa-ac23-18"&gt;http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgAdvisoryCircular.nsf/0/7ca84861d31651a5862569b2006dbcfe/$FILE/ATTOVW46/AC23-18.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; More advanced systems, introduced in 1996,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www51.honeywell.com/aero/technology/key-technologies2/avionics3/egpws.html?c=23 |title=Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS) – Honeywell Aerospace Engineering |publisher=1.honeywell.com |accessdate=October 17, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002025011/http://www51.honeywell.com/aero/technology/key-technologies2/avionics3/egpws.html?c=23 |archivedate=October 2, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; are known as '''enhanced ground proximity warning systems'''  ('''EGPWS'''), although sometimes called ''terrain awareness warning systems''.

==History==
{{main article|Terrain awareness warning system#History}}

In the late 1960s, a series of [[controlled flight into terrain]] (CFIT) accidents took the lives of hundreds of people. A CFIT accident is one where a properly functioning airplane under the control of a fully qualified and certified crew is flown into terrain, water or obstacles with no apparent awareness on the part of the crew.&lt;ref name="faa-historical-ac23-18"&gt;Note: Original text copied from U.S. FAA Circular AC23-18 [http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgAdvisoryCircular.nsf/0/7CA84861D31651A5862569B2006DBCFE?OpenDocument]. As a work of the U.S. Government, there is no copyright on the work, and it may be freely copied, and is thus included here. Additional or reduced text and formatting, not included in the original, have been added here for clarity and emphasis.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the early 1970s, a number of studies examined the occurrence of CFIT accidents.&lt;ref name="faa-historical-ac23-18" /&gt; Findings from these studies indicated that many such accidents could have been avoided if a warning device called a ground proximity warning system (GPWS) had been used.  As a result of these studies and recommendations from the [[National Transportation Safety Board|U.S. National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB), in 1974 the FAA required all large turbine and turbojet airplanes to install [[Technical Standard Order|TSO]]-approved GPWS equipment.&lt;ref name="faa-historical-ac23-18" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(§§ 121.360 and 135.153) (39 FR 44439, December 18, 1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICAO recommended the installation of GPWS in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1999/1999%20-%201940.html Personality ''Flight'' Aerospace Industry Awards 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[C. Donald Bateman]], a Canadian-born engineer, developed and is credited with the invention of GPWS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.invent.org/hall_of_fame/231.html |title=Invent Now &amp;#124; Hall of Fame &amp;#124; Search &amp;#124; Inventor Profile |publisher=Invent.org |date=March 8, 1932 |accessdate=October 17, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927041453/http://www.invent.org/hall_of_fame/231.html |archivedate=September 27, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2000, the U.S. FAA amended operating rules to require that all U.S. registered turbine-powered airplanes with six or more passenger seats (exclusive of pilot and copilot seating) be equipped with an FAA-approved TAWS.&lt;ref name="faa-historical-ac23-18" /&gt; The mandate affects aircraft manufactured after March 29, 2002.&lt;ref name="FAR"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library%5CrgFAR.nsf/0/465764AB441B0864862568C8006451A9?OpenDocument |title=Sec. 121.354 – Terrain awareness and warning system |accessdate=April 29, 2007 |publisher=[[Federal Aviation Administration]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects and statistics ==
Prior to the development of GPWS, large passenger aircraft were involved in 3.5 fatal CFIT accidents per year, falling to 2 per year in the mid-1970s. A 2006 report stated that from 1974, when the U.S. FAA made it a requirement for large aircraft to carry such equipment, until the time of the report, there had not been a single passenger fatality in a CFIT crash by a large jet in U.S. airspace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Sabatini | first = Nicholas | title = Downward Pressure on the Accident Rate | publisher=[[Federal Aviation Administration]] | url = http://www.faa.gov/news/speeches/news_story.cfm?newsId=7170 | accessdate =March 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1974, there were still some CFIT accidents that GPWS was unable to help prevent, due to the "blind spot" of those early GPWS systems.  More advanced systems were developed.

Older TAWS, or deactivation of the EGPWS, or ignoring its warnings when airport is not in its database, or even the entire EGPWS altogether&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.tvn24.pl/12690,1653907,0,1,lotniska-w-smolensku-moglo-nie-byc-w-bazie-gpws,wiadomosc.html |title="Lotniska w Smoleńsku mogło nie być w bazie GPWS" – Polska – Informacje – portal TVN24.pl – 27.04.2010 |publisher=Tvn24.pl |date=April 27, 2010 |accessdate=October 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; still leave aircraft vulnerable to possible CFIT incidents.

== Commercial aircraft ==
[[Image:Faa-tso-c151b-sink-rate.png|thumb|right|The FAA specifications&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library%5CrgTSO.nsf/0/CC60D6B4C807869586256DC700717E5F?OpenDocument|title=Historical Technical Standard Order|website=rgl.faa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; have detailed requirements for when certain warnings should sound in the cockpit.]]

The system monitors an aircraft's height above ground as determined by a [[radar altimeter]]. A computer then keeps track of these readings, calculates trends, and will warn the flight crew with visual and audio messages if the aircraft is in certain defined flying configurations ("modes").

The modes are:
#Excessive descent rate ("SINK RATE" "PULL UP")
#Excessive terrain closure rate ("TERRAIN" "PULL UP")
#Altitude loss after take off or with a high power setting ("DON'T SINK")
#Unsafe terrain clearance ("TOO LOW – TERRAIN" "TOO LOW – GEAR" "TOO LOW – FLAPS")
#Excessive deviation below [[glideslope]] ("GLIDESLOPE")
#Excessively steep bank angle ("BANK ANGLE")
#[[Microburst#Danger to aircraft|Windshear]] protection ("WINDSHEAR")

The traditional GPWS does have a blind spot. Since it can only gather data from directly below the aircraft, it must predict future terrain features. If there is a dramatic change in terrain, such as a steep slope, GPWS will not detect the aircraft closure rate until it is too late for evasive action.

In the late 1990s improvements were developed and the system is now named ''"Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System"'' (EGPWS/[[TAWS]]). The system is combined with a worldwide digital terrain database and relies on [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) technology. On-board computers compare current location with a database of the Earth's terrain. The Terrain Display gives pilots a visual orientation to high and low points nearby the aircraft.

EGPWS software improvements are focused on solving two common problems; no warning at all, and late or improper response.

===No warning===
The primary cause of CFIT occurrences with no GPWS warning is landing short. When the landing gear is down and landing flaps are deployed, the GPWS expects the airplane to land and therefore, issues no warning. EGPWS introduces the Terrain Clearance Floor (TCF) function, which provides GPWS protection even in the landing configuration.

===Late warning or improper response===
The occurrence of a GPWS alert typically happens at a time of high workload and nearly always surprises the flight crew. Almost certainly, the aircraft is not where the pilot thinks it should be, and the response to a GPWS warning can be late in these circumstances. Warning time can also be short if the aircraft is flying into steep terrain since the downward looking radio altimeter is the primary sensor used for the warning calculation. The EGPWS improves terrain awareness and warning times by introducing the Terrain Display and the Terrain Data Base Look Ahead protection.

== Incidents ==
In commercial and airline operations there are legally mandated procedures that must be followed should an EGPWS caution or warning occur. Both pilots must respond and act accordingly once the alert has been issued. An Indonesian captain has been charged with manslaughter for not adhering to these procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thomas |first=Geoffrey |url=http://atwonline.com/operations/jakarta-crash-captain-arrested-charged-manslaughter |title=ATW: jakarta crash captain arrested, charged with manslaughter |publisher=Atwonline.com |date=February 6, 2008 |accessdate=October 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== General aviation ==
{{main article|TAWS#TAWS Types}}
TAWS equipment is not required by the U.S. FAA in piston-engined aircraft, but optional equipment categorized as '''TAWS Type C''' may be installed. Depending on the type of operation, TAWS is only required to be installed into turbine-powered aircraft with six or more passenger seats.

A smaller and less expensive version of EGPWS was developed by [[AlliedSignal]] (now merged with [[Honeywell]]) for general aviation and private aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aeroworldnet.com/3tw05179.htm |title=AeroWorldNet(tm) – AlliedSignal Develops New EGPWS, Display for General Aviation Market [May 17, 1999&amp;#93; |publisher=AeroWorldNet |date=May 17, 1999 |accessdate=October 17, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106021157/http://www.aeroworldnet.com/3tw05179.htm |archivedate=January 6, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fast military aircraft ==
For fast military aircraft, the high speed and low altitude that may frequently be flown make traditional GPWS systems unsuitable, as the blind spot becomes the critical part. Thus, an enhanced system is required, taking inputs not only from the [[radar altimeter]], but also from [[inertial navigation system]] (INS), [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS), and [[flight control system]] (FCS), using these to accurately predict the flight path of the aircraft up to {{Convert|5|mi|km}} ahead. [[Digital mapping|Digital maps]] of terrain and obstacle features are then used to determine whether a collision is likely if the aircraft does not pull up at a given pre-set [[G-force|g-level]]. If a collision is predicted, a cockpit warning may be provided. This is the type of system deployed on aircraft such as the [[Eurofighter Typhoon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurofighter.com/news/article61.asp Eurofighter Typhoon – BAE SYSTEMS delivers first Eurofighter Typhoon Ground Proximity Warning] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080203123456/http://www.eurofighter.com/news/article61.asp |date=February 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The U.S. FAA has also conducted a study about adapting 3-D military thrust vectoring to recover civil jetliners from catastrophes.&lt;ref&gt;"Multiaxis Thrust Vectoring Flight Control Vs Catastrophic Failure Prevention", Reports to U.S. Dept. of Transportation/FAA, Technical Center, ACD-210, FAA X88/0/6FA/921000/4104/T1706D, FAA Res.

On May 5, 2016 a military GPWS called Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System (Auto-GCAS) equipped aboard an F-16 made a dramatic save after a trainee pilot lost consciousness from excessive G forces during basic fighter maneuver training. In an approximately 55 degree nose down attitude at 8,760&amp;nbsp;ft and 652 [[Indicated airspeed|KIAS]] (750&amp;nbsp;mph), the Auto-GCAS detected the aircraft was going to strike the terrain and executed an automatic recovery and saved the pilot's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aviationweek.com/technology/auto-gcas-saves-unconscious-f-16-pilot-declassified-usaf-footage|title=Auto-GCAS Saves Unconscious F-16 Pilot—Declassified USAF Footage|website=aviationweek.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gulam Kaderbhoy Noon, Baron Noon''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|MBE}} (24 January 1936 – 27 October 2015) was a British businessman originally from [[Mumbai, India]]. Known as the "Curry King", Noon operated a number of food product companies in [[Southall]], London. He was a member of the [[Dawoodi Bohra]] Ismaili Shia community

==Early life==
Noon was born in 1936, into a [[Dawoodi Bohra]] Muslim family which operated a sweet shop in [[Bombay]]. His father died when he was 7, and a relative ran the business until Noon took over its management at the age of 17. He renamed the shop "Royal Sweets", and expanded its clientele and size until it was capable of exporting internationally.&lt;ref name=teleobit&gt;{{cite news|title=Lord Noon, businessman - obituary|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11958112/Lord-Noon-businessman-obituary.html|accessdate=27 October 2015|work=The Telegraph|date=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, Noon travelled to Britain and emigrated permanently in 1972. He established a sweet shop in Southall, producing such products as [[Bombay mix]].&lt;ref name=teleobit /&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Noon, 25 Queen Anne's Gate.JPG|thumbnail|Noon group offices at [[Queen Anne's Gate]], London.]]
Noon founded and operated a number of food product companies in [[Southall]], London, specialising in Indian cuisine. His main business was Noon Products which he established in September 1987, manufacturing chilled and frozen Indian and Thai ready meals, predominantly for UK supermarkets. Whilst he didn't invent the dish, Noon is credited with the popularity of [[chicken tikka masala]] in Britain.&lt;ref name=teleobit /&gt;

In 1994, the company experienced a serious factory fire which destroyed much of its manufacturing capability, however within ten weeks of this fire the company had begun selling its products again. Noon kept all his staff in employment during this period.&lt;ref name=mantoday&gt;{{cite news|last1=Davidson|first1=Andrew|title=The MT Interview: Sir Gulam Noon|url=http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/news/865052/MT-Interview-Sir-Gulam-Noon/|accessdate=27 October 2015|work=Management Today|date=27 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Noon Products was taken over by Irish food conglomerate [[Kerry Group]].&lt;ref name=ftkerry&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Peter|title=Noon Products sold to Kerry Group for £125m|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c609549e-0615-11da-883e-00000e2511c8.html|accessdate=27 October 2015|work=Financial Times|date=6 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2006 he came to wider notice as one of the businessmen embroiled in the "[[Cash for Peerages]]" scandal when it emerged that he had loaned £250,000 to the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5167140.stm |title=Levy's advice to donor revealed |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=11 July 2006 |accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was given an MBE for services to the food industry in 1994 (under a Conservative government) and [[knighthood|knighted]] in 2002. Labour MP [[Jeremy Corbyn]] said that awarding knighthoods to party donors, like Noon, would devalue the whole honours system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2045417.stm |title=Donor's knighthood 'undermines system' |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=17 June 2002 |accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Noon was a declared backer of the [[Britain in Europe]] group, a [[pro-European]] [[pressure group]] and as a former [[trustee]] of the [[Maimonides Foundation]], a charitable organisation promoting dialogue between [[Jew]]s and [[Muslim]]s.&lt;ref name="maimonides"&gt;{{cite web|title=Maimonides Foundation|url=http://www.maimonides-foundation.org/home.html|accessdate=28 September 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926092051/http://maimonides-foundation.org/home.html|archivedate=26 September 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was awarded an Honorary Degree from the [[University of East London]] on 12 November 2009.&lt;ref name="James Caan, Sir Gulam Noon MBE and West Ham United celebrate Business School graduates success"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.uel.ac.uk/news/stories/business-grad-09.htm|title= James Caan, Sir Gulam Noon MBE and West Ham United celebrate Business School graduates success}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2013, Lord Noon was appointed as the chancellor of the [[University of East London]].&lt;ref name="University of East London"&gt;{{cite web|title=UEL new chancellor|url=http://www.uel.ac.uk/news/press-releases/2013/01/LordNoon.htm|accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
A "castaway" on the [[BBC Radio 4]] programme ''[[Desert Island Discs]]'' in 2004, in [[Sunday Times Rich List|''The Sunday Times'' Rich List 2006]] he was placed in 888th position with an estimated fortune of £65 million. He died of cancer on 27 October 2015.&lt;ref name="thestatesman.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestatesman.com/news/latest-headlines/britain-s-%C3%A7urry-king-lord-gulam-noon-passes-away/99640.html|title=The Statesman: Britain’s Curry King Lord Gulam Noon passes away|work=thestatesman.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on extremist imams===
Noon was among those trapped in the [[Taj Mahal Palace &amp; Tower|Taj Mahal Palace Hotel]] by terrorists, during the [[November 2008 Mumbai attacks]], but was rescued and later appeared on BBC News to describe his experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article5245365.ece|publisher=[[The Times]]|title=Sir Gulam Noon, British 'Curry King': how I escaped bombed hotel|accessdate=28 November 2008 | location=London | date=27 November 2008 | first1=Alice | last1=Thomson | first2=Rachel | last2=Sylvester}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently praised the response by India's [[Islam in India|Muslim community]] to the attacks, saying:
{{quote|"Indian Muslims have refused to bury the nine dead terrorists. They are still in the mortuary. It is a good symbolic message for the rest of secular India." "Now Britain needs to get tough with the radical imams. We have the power to do something."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ptinews.com/news/399148_Noon-lauds-Indian-Muslim-response-to-Mumbai-attacks|title=Noon lauds Indian Muslim response to 26/11|publisher=[[Press Trust of India]]|date=29 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He also called for Britain to toughen measures against extremist Muslim preachers, and said that the door was open for foreign [[imam]]s to radicalise young Muslims in mosques across Britain:
{{quote|"Having seen what I saw at close quarters, the indiscriminate violence and pain inflicted in the name of my religion, I am astounded that I hear from friends in the community that radical preachers are still coming to this country and praising attacks by [[Al-Qaeda]] and suicide missions. There is a limit to free speech. Extremists who preach their approval of suicide bombers should be sent back to their country of origin."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/29/ghulam-noon-extremist-imams-curbs|title=British Muslim tycoon Sir Gulam Noon calls for curbs on extremist imams|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=29 November 2009 | location=London | accessdate=4 May 2010 | first=Rajeev | last=Syal}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He died of cancer on 27 October 2015.&lt;ref name="thestatesman.com"/&gt;

==Honours==
Noon was made a [[Member of the Order of the British Empire]] (MBE) in the [[1996 New Year Honours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=54255 |supp=y |page=22 |date=29 December 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later made a [[Knight Bachelor]] in the [[2002 Birthday Honours]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=56595 |supp=y |page=1 |date=15 June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; having the honour conferred in December that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=57030 |date=15 August 2003 |page=10217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Noon was Chancellor of the University of East London - a titular position - where he presided over the degree ceremonies.

On 27 January 2011, he was created a [[life peer]] as '''Baron Noon''', of [[St John's Wood]] in the [[London Borough of Camden]]&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=59687 |date=1 February 2011 |page=1657}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was [[Introduction (House of Lords)|introduced]] in the [[House of Lords]] on 31 January 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201011/minutes/110131/ldordpap.htm|title=House of Lords Business|work=parliament.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he sat on the Labour benches.

On 26 April 2012, Noon was made a [[Fellow]] of [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck]], a constituent college of the [[University of London]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7035">The '''Heishan bandits''' or '''Black Mountain bandits''' ({{zh|c=黑山賊|p=Hēishān zéi}}) was a bandit confederacy in the [[Taihang Mountain]] range during the later years of the [[Eastern Han dynasty]] in China. They played a part in the internecine feuds that followed the Eastern Han dynasty's descent into chaos, and eventually surrendered to the warlord [[Cao Cao]].

==History==
Following the loosening of central government control due to the repercussions of the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]], bandits and rebels sprung up everywhere. One such bandit group under [[Zhang Niujue]] (張牛角, aka Oxhorn Zhang), unrelated to the Yellow Turban movement, rose to power in the hill countries of the Taihang Mountains by plundering the western areas of the [[North China Plain]]. In 185, Zhang Niujue and fellow bandit [[Zhang Yan (Han dynasty)|Chu Yan]] (褚燕) joined forces to raid the town of Yingtao (癭陶). Zhang Niujue was killed in the skirmish, and his followers followed his last order to join Chu Yan. Chu Yan changed his surname to Zhang to honour his fallen colleague, so he became known as Zhang Yan.&lt;ref&gt;de Crespigny (1989), p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, he became the nominal chief of all bandits east of the [[Taihang range]], forming a confederacy of bandits known as the Heishan bandits. His ranks grew steadily in number until they were said to reach a million. They conducted raids in the commanderies of Changshan (常山), Zhao (趙), Zhongshan (中山), Shangdang (上黨) and Henei (河內). Unable to control the situation, the government accepted a nominal surrender and offered the bandits official positions.&lt;ref&gt;de Crespigny (2007), p. 1083&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the central government fell under [[Dong Zhuo]]'s chaotic control in 189, the Heishan bandits went back to their former activities.

In the civil wars that followed the unsuccessful [[campaign against Dong Zhuo]], Zhang Yan and the Heishan bandits apparently sided with [[Gongsun Zan]] and thus attacked commanderies that were in the possession of Gongsun Zan's enemies. In 191 the Heishan bandits raided Dong commandery (東郡), under the control of [[Yuan Shao]]'s associate [[Cao Cao]], but were driven back. Early in 193, the bandits and a contingent of the Southern [[Xiongnu]] under [[Yufuluo]] aided Yuan Shu, who was driven out of his original territory of Nanyang (南陽) by Yuan Shao's ally [[Liu Biao]], in Chenliu (陳留). As Chenliu was also within Cao Cao's territories, he swiftly defeated the allies and chased Yuan Shu away to the south. Later, the Heishan bandits under [[Yu Du]] (于毒), joined by local rebels, stormed Yuan Shao's [[Ye, China|Ye]] city, capital of Wei commandery (魏郡), and killed its Grand Administrator (太守) Li Cheng (栗成).&lt;ref&gt;de Crespigny (1996), p.113&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;de Crespigny (2007), p.408&lt;/ref&gt; This last attack drew Yuan Shao's furious retaliation; he led a suppression campaign to crush the bandits, slaying Yu Du and many other Heishan leaders, but Yuan Shao was ultimately unable to defeat Zhang Yan, who had the backing of various Xiongnu and [[Wuhuan]] groups. With heavy casualties on both sides, the opposing armies made a swift withdrawal from the area.&lt;ref&gt;de Crespigny (2010), p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

Yuan Shao's campaign might have diminished the Heishan bandits' prospects in the south, but Zhang Yan and his people continued to hold out in the northern Changshan commandery. In 199, Zhang Yan answered Gongsun Zan's call for help as he made his last stand in the [[Battle of Yijing]], but his bandit army could not penetrate Yuan Shao's besieging army and thus could not save Gongsun Zan from his demise. In 205, as Cao Cao drove out the Yuan family from the region, Zhang Yan led his men to submit to Cao Cao.&lt;ref&gt;de Crespigny (1996), p. 340&lt;/ref&gt;

==Names of the bandits==
As the members of the confederacy were outlaws, many of them used nicknames, named after their defining traits. While some of these names may be genuine names, there had been some efforts to translate the names and determine the possible logic behind them.&lt;ref&gt;de Crespigny (1989), p. 193 and pp. 567-8 note 12; de Crespigny (1996), p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''In re Application of the United States for Historical Cell Site Data''''', 724 F.3d 600 (5th Cir. 2013), was a case in which the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] held that the government can access [[cell site]] records without a [[Warrant (law)|warrant]]. Specifically, the court held that [[court order]]s under the [[Stored Communications Act]] compelling cell phone providers to disclose historical cell site information are not ''per se'' [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]].{{R|fifthCircuitRulingText}}

Section 2703(d) of the Stored Communications Act allows law enforcement agents to obtain court orders for cell site information without a warrant.{{R|SCA}} Privacy advocates argued that the Act was unconstitutional because it violated callers' [[reasonable expectation of privacy]] under the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]]. The court held that cell site information is a "business record" that callers voluntarily convey to their phone service providers. Since information voluntarily conveyed to third parties receives weaker protection under the Fourth Amendment, the court held that section 2703(d) of the Stored Communications Act is not per se unconstitutional.

The ''New York Times'' called the case "a significant victory for law enforcement."{{R|nytimes}} The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] wrote that the opinion was based on a "misguided belief that a user understands and voluntarily chooses to reveal their location to the cell phone provider and ultimately the government through the user's own free will."{{R|eff-article}}

== Background ==

=== Facts ===

In early October 2010, law enforcement agents in Texas applied for three court orders under section 2703(d) of the Stored Communications Act, seeking to compel cell phone service providers to disclose cell site information for three phones for the past 60 days.{{R|districtCourtOpinionText}} According to the district court:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Among other things, each application sought "records or other information pertaining to subscriber(s) or customer(s), including historical cell site information and call detail records (including any two-way radio feature mode) for the sixty (60) days prior to the date the Order is signed by the Court (but not including the contents of communications)." Each application identically defined the requested information as "the antenna tower and sector to which the cell phone sends its signal," specifically including "the cellsite/sector(s) used by the mobile telephone to obtain service for a call or when in an idle state." In other words, the Government seeks continuous location data to track the target phone over a two-month period, whether the phone was in active use or not.{{R|districtCourtOpinionText}}{{rp|829}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Procedural history ===

Magistrate Judge Stephen William Smith of [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas]] issued an opinion on October 29, 2010 denying the government's applications on the grounds that such a disclosure violates the Fourth Amendment.{{R|districtCourtOpinionText}}{{R|aclu-article}}

The district court adopted the magistrate judge's decision in a single-page ruling on November 11, 2011, stating "the standard under the Stored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C . §2703(d), is below that required by the Constitution".{{R|districtCourtOrder}}

The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] reversed the district court in an opinion issued on July 30, 2013.{{R|fifthCircuitRulingText}}

=== District court opinion ===

The district court held that compelled disclosure of [[cell site]] information violates the Fourth Amendment.{{R|districtCourtOpinionText}}{{rp|846}}

The opinion began by noting that the court has typically granted similar government requests for historical cell site information.{{R|districtCourtOpinionText}}{{rp|829}} "However," the court noted, "recent months have brought to light important developments in both technology and caselaw raising serious constitutional doubts about such rulings."{{R|districtCourtOpinionText}}{{rp|829}} In particular, the court pointed to ''[[United States v. Maynard]]'', which held that constitutionally unprotected location data can receive protection when aggregated over time.{{R|districtCourtOpinionText}}{{rp|830}} The court also cited an opinion from the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]] directing a lower court to determine whether cell site records could encroach upon citizens' reasonable expectations of privacy.{{R|districtCourtOpinionText}}{{rp|830}}

Next, the opinion surveyed recent developments in cell phone technology. It noted that in 2010, when the opinion was published, there were over 251,000 cell sites in the U.S., compared to just 913 in 1986, the year the Stored Communications Act became law.{{R|districtCourtOpinionText}}{{rp|832}} The court pointed out that "knowing the base station (or sector ID) is tantamount to knowing the user's location to within a relatively small geographic area."{{R|districtCourtOpinionText}}{{rp|833}} The court found that the differences in accuracy between [[GPS]] location data and cell site data are "increasingly obsolete, and will soon be effectively meaningless."{{R|districtCourtOpinionText}}{{rp|834}}

The court reached three legal conclusions. First, it held that cell site information reveals non-public information about constitutionally protected spaces. Specifically, it held that cell site information could reveal whether an item or a person was in an individual's home at a particular time, which the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] held in ''[[United States v. Karo]]'' to be protected under the Fourth Amendment.{{R|districtCourtOpinionText}}{{rp|835–38}}

Second, it held that Fourth Amendment protections apply to cell site information because it can reveal sensitive personal information over time. The court based this ruling on ''[[United States v. Maynard]]'', in which the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] held that "[p]rolonged surveillance reveals types of information not revealed by short-term surveillance, such as what a person does repeatedly, what he does not do, and what he does ensemble."{{R|districtCourtOpinionText}}{{rp|838–40}} (The Supreme Court later affirmed ''Maynard'' on narrower grounds in ''[[United States v. Jones]]'', 565 U.S. ___ (2012).)

Third, it held that users do not voluntarily convey cell site information to their mobile providers. The government argued that cell site information is not entitled to Fourth Amendment protections, citing Supreme Court cases holding that law enforcement does not need a warrant to access information voluntarily disclosed to third parties.{{R|districtCourtOpinionText}}{{rp|840–45}} The court disagreed, holding that cell phone users' disclosure of location information is "unknowing" and "inadvertent."{{R|districtCourtOpinionText}}{{rp|840–45}}

== Fifth circuit opinion ==

The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] reversed the district court, holding that cell site information is not constitutionally protected because callers voluntarily convey the data to their mobile providers.

First, the court addressed whether the magistrate judge had discretion to require the government to seek a warrant.{{R|fifthCircuitRulingText}}{{rp|606}} The [[ACLU]] (in an [[amicus brief]] filed jointly with the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]]) argued that Section 2703(d) of the Stored Communications Act gives magistrate judges the authority to require the government to obtain a warrant to obtain historical cell site information.{{R|fifthCircuitRulingText}}{{rp|606}} Section 2703(d) states than an order "shall issue only if the governmental entity offers specific and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the contents of a wire or electronic communication, or the records or other information sought, are relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation."{{R|SCA}} Relying on a Third Circuit opinion reaching the same conclusion, the ACLU argued that the phrase "only if" created a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the court to issue an order.{{R|fifthCircuitRulingText}}{{rp|606}} In other words, if the government shows "specific and articulable facts," a judge ''may'' issue an order, but she may also decide to require a warrant.

However, the Fifth Circuit here disagreed with the ACLU's reading of the statute. Under the court's interpretation, the word "shall" is "the language of command." The court held that "the 'shall issue' term ''directs'' the court to issue the order if all the necessary conditions in the statute are met" (emphasis added).{{R|fifthCircuitRulingText}}{{rp|607}} Thus a magistrate judge ''must'' issue an order for cell site information if the government meets the "specific and articulable facts" standard. "If these three conditions are met," the Fifth Circuit held, "the court does not have the discretion to refuse to grant the order."{{R|fifthCircuitRulingText}}{{rp|607}}

Moreover, the court held even if the ACLU's argument were correct, the issue of magistrate judges' discretion "would be beside the point here."{{R|fifthCircuitRulingText}}{{rp|608}} The lower court held that "all § 2703(d) orders for cell site information were unconstitutional". Thus the court here was forced to confront whether 2703(d) orders are constitutional.

The ACLU's argument focused on the potential of cell site data to reveal sensitive information about a person's location.{{R|fifthCircuitRulingText}}{{rp|608}} It argued that cell site data information can track people while they are inside their homes, which the Supreme Court has held to be a constitutionally protected space.{{R|fifthCircuitRulingText}}{{rp|608}} It also cited five justices' concurring opinions in ''[[United States v. Jones]]'', which suggested that higher constitutional protections might apply to location information aggregated over time.{{R|fifthCircuitRulingText}}{{rp|608}}

In contrast, the government's argument focused on who is gathering the data. It argued that the government itself does not collect cell site location data.{{R|fifthCircuitRulingText}}{{rp|610}} Rather, cell phone users generate this data in the course of doing business with their phone service providers.{{R|fifthCircuitRulingText}}{{rp|610}} Several Supreme Court opinions have established that the Fourth Amendment does not protect so-called "business records."{{R|fifthCircuitRulingText}}{{rp|610}} Since the information is not constitutionally protected, the government argued that it does not need a warrant to compel phone companies to turn over the data to investigators.{{R|fifthCircuitRulingText}}{{rp|610}}

The court held that "cell site information is clearly a business record."{{R|fifthCircuitRulingText}}{{rp|611}} The data is the result of a business transaction between the caller and the phone company. The ACLU nonetheless argued that callers do not voluntarily convey location information.{{R|fifthCircuitRulingText}}{{rp|612}} The government disagreed, arguing that phone users are aware that location information may be transmitted to their phone company when they place calls.{{R|fifthCircuitRulingText}}{{rp|612}} The court agreed with the government:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Because a cell phone user makes a choice to get a phone, to select a particular service provider, and to make a call, and because he knows that the call conveys cell site information, the provider retains this information, and the provider will turn it over to the police if they have a court order, he voluntarily conveys his cell site data each time he makes a call.{{R|fifthCircuitRulingText}}{{rp|614}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In conclusion, the court held that "Section 2703(d) orders to obtain ''historical'' cell site information for specified cell phones at the points at which the user places and terminates a call are not categorically unconstitutional.{{R|fifthCircuitRulingText}}{{rp|615}} It did not rule on other forms of mobile location tracking, like GPS tracking or the collection of data from all phones using a given cell tower.

== Subsequent developments ==

The [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]] disagreed with the Fifth Circuit's ruling in this case. In ''Commonwealth v. Augustine,'' the court concluded "that although the CSLI [Cell Site Location Information] at issue here is a business record of the defendant's cellular service provider, he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in it," and therefore the government must seek a warrant to obtain long term cell site data.{{R|supremeJudicialCourtOpinion}}{{R|augustine-eff-article}}{{R|augustine-aclu-article}} The court recognized that "GPS data and historical CSLI are linked at a fundamental level", as they both implicate a person's reasonable expectation of privacy in the same manner, by tracking the person's movements.{{R|supremeJudicialCourtOpinion}}{{rp|254}} The court decided that tracking a person's location in the urban Boston area for two weeks was "more than sufficient to intrude upon the defendant's expectation of privacy safeguarded by art."{{R|supremeJudicialCourtOpinion}}{{rp|254-55}} The court did not consider what the time boundaries are for such an order to not implicate a person's reasonable privacy interest.

'''Jovita Idár''' (September 7, 1885, &amp;ndash; June 15, 1946) was an American journalist, political activist and civil rights worker, who fought for the rights of Mexican Americans and women. She worked as a teacher but turned to journalism and worked at her father's newspaper, ''La Crónica''.&lt;ref&gt;“Texas Originals.” Jovita Idár | Humanities Texas, [http://www.humanitiestexas.org/programs/tx-originals/list/jovita-idar www.humanitiestexas.org/programs/tx-originals/list/jovita-idar]. Retrieved 02 April 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early Years ==
Jovita Idár was born in [[Laredo, Texas]] in 1885.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Handbook of Texas Online - Idar, Jovita.
http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fid03. Retrieved on 2009-07-23.&lt;/ref&gt; She was one of eight children of Jovita and Nicasio Idár &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Nancy Baker|title=IDAR JOVITA|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fid03|website=TSHA|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; who strove to advance the civil rights of Mexican-Americans. All eight Idar children grew up in an atmosphere where rights, responsibilities and the circumstances of the Chicano community were consistently discussed. In the book ''Marching to a Different Drummer,'' Robin Kadison Berson explains “Growing up Jovita was an imaginative, spirited girl; eager student, she won prizes for her poetry and enjoyed reciting before an audience.”&lt;ref&gt;Berson, Robin Kadison.Marching to a Different Drummer: Unrecognized Heroes of American History.Greenwood Publishing Group,1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

Idár and two of her brothers, Eduardo and Bobby Brown, worked for the newspaper ''La Crónica'' [The Chronicles]. The paper, edited and published by their father Nicasio Idár, advocated for civil rights and social justice for [[Mexican-American]]s.

== Career ==
Idár earned her teaching certificate in 1903 from the [[Holding Institute]] in Laredo.&lt;ref&gt;Pouwels, ''Political Journalism by Mexican Women''.&lt;/ref&gt; She taught in a school in [[Los Ojuelos]], located approximately 40 miles east of Laredo.&lt;ref&gt;Handbook of Texas - Idar, Joavita&lt;/ref&gt; The reality of her first years teaching was frustrating, “There was never enough textbooks for her pupils, nor enough paper, pens or pencils; if all her students came to class, there were not enough chairs or desk for them.”.&lt;ref&gt;Berson, Robin Kadison.Marching to a Different Drummer: Unrecognized Heroes of American		 History.Greenwood Publishing Group,1994.&lt;/ref&gt; The schooling for Chicano students, much like African American students in the south at that time, was inadequate. Chicanos paid taxes to support decent schooling for their children yet, they were denied from entering. By this time Idar realized that her teaching efforts were making little impact on student lives due to the ill-equipped segregated schools. She decided that journalism offered more of a meaningful change that would be effective and she returned to Laredo to write for ''La Cronica''. In 1910 La Cronica criticized the different social relations between the Hispanic communities and the Anglo people, “Featuring stories on educational and social discrimination against Mexican Americans, poor economic conditions, decreasing use of the Spanish language, the loss of Mexican culture and lynching of Hispanics.”&lt;ref&gt;JONES, NANCY BAKER."IDAR, JOVITA."JONES, NANCY BAKER. June 14, 2010.Accessed February 12, 2018. https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fid03.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1911 La Cronica had shifted towards supporting revolutionary forces, “the newspaper called a convention of the Orden Caballeros de Honor, a fraternal order to discuss the troubling social issues at the time”

== Movements ==
'''La Liga Femenil (League of Mexican Women)'''

Idár served as the first president of the League of Mexican Women (La Liga Femenil Mexicanista). It was founded in October 1911 in Laredo to offer free education to Mexican children.&lt;ref&gt;Villegas de Magnón, Leonor. ''The Rebel''. Arte Publico Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Additional goals of the organization were to "unify the Mexican intellectuals of Texas around the issues of protection of civil rights, bilingual education, the lynching of Mexicans, labor organizing and women's concerns."&lt;ref&gt;Lomas, Clara. "Historical Newspapers". In ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Latinos and Latinas in the United States''. (Eds. Suzanne Oboler and Deena J. González). Oxford University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The women within this league worked to transform these injustices into a plan of action and focused on relieving social problems through actively making changes within their communities. Women who participated in this organization were highly influential. “Some league members were trained educators and professionals, and the education of youth remained the organization's primary focus.”&lt;ref&gt;Ramos, Raĺul A., and Monica Perales. Recovering the U.S Hispanic Literary Heritage Series:		 Recovering the Hispanic History of Texas. Arte Publico Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It developed into a social, political and charitable organization for women that, in part, provided food and clothes to those in need.&lt;ref&gt;Handbook of Texas Online - Liga Femenil Mexicanista.

'''Primer Congreso Mexicanista'''

Idar also participated in the Primer Congreso Mexicanista,&lt;ref&gt;Meier, Matt S. and Margo Gutierrez. ''Encyclopedia of the Mexican American Civil Rights Movement''. Greenwood Press, 2000, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; an organization dedicated to fighting inequality and racism.&lt;ref&gt;Pardo, Mary S. "Latina Labor and Community Organizers". In The Oxford Encyclopedia of Latinos and Latinas in the United States." (Eds. Suzanne Oboler and Deena J. González). Oxford University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; These associations actively worked for the advancement of their members, “by holding studying and learning sessions, sessions where culture is acquired and talent is developed without orgies and unhealthy ambitions.”&lt;ref name="Turner, Elizabeth Hayes 2015"&gt;Turner, Elizabeth Hayes, Stephanie Cole, and Rebecca Sharpless. Texas women: their histories, their lives. Athens, GA: The University of Georgia Press, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Idar promoted the values of the "gente decente," self-identified decent, honest and respectable people, as the solution to the social problems faced by marginalized communities, “Idar promoted the idea that education elevated women and by extension men”&lt;ref name="Turner, Elizabeth Hayes 2015"/&gt; she reflected an ideal of feminism that was not completely against Victorian concepts, but she did challenge ideas and broke boundaries of the patriarchal society of her time.

In 1913 during the [[Mexican Revolution]] Idár and a friend entered Mexico to help care for the wounded along the border region. She later joined a medical group called the White Cross ([[La Cruz Blanca]]) which was similar to the Red Cross relief organization.&lt;ref&gt;Handbook of Texas - Idar, Jovita.&lt;/ref&gt; After returning to Laredo Idár worked for the newspaper ''El Progreso'' where she protested against the dispatch of U.S troops to border through a written editorial. This offended the U.S Army and [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]], causing the rangers to force the shutdown of ''El Progreso''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Nancy Baker|title=IDAR, JOVITA|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fid03|website=TSHA|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; After her father's death in 1914, she eventually returned to operate ''La Crónica'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Nancy Baker|title=Jovita Idar|url=https://www.womenintexashistory.org/audio/idar/|website=Women in Texas History|publisher=Venue Communications, Inc|accessdate=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; where she continued to expose the conditions that Mexican-Americans and Mexican immigrants were living under at the time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She also founded the weekly paper ''Evolución'' in November 1916 which lasted four years.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

In May 1917 Idár married Bartolo Juárez, who worked as a plumber and tinsmith.&lt;ref&gt;''Laredo Times''. May 27, 1917, page 7.&lt;/ref&gt; She moved with her husband to [[San Antonio]] in 1921.

'''Kantano Habimana''', commonly referred to as '''''Kantano''''', was a presenter (''animateur'') on the Rwandan radio station [[Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines]] (RTLM), which played a significant role in promoting the [[Rwandan Genocide]]. Like the station's [[RTLM#Individuals_associated_with_the_station|other broadcasters]], Habimana incited violence against [[Tutsi]] and moderate [[Hutu]] on the air.&lt;ref&gt;The Prosecutor v.

At a pre-genocide court hearing on March 15, 1994, for "the incitement of citizens against each other", Habimana described RTLM broadcasters as "small fish" compared to RTLM executives such as [[Ferdinand Nahimana]].&lt;ref&gt;The Prosecutor v.

The '''Kisan Mazdoor Praja Party''' was a political party of India. Established in 1951, it  merged with the [[Socialist Party (India)|Socialist Party]] to form the [[Praja Socialist Party]] in the following year.

==History==
In June, 1951 [[Indian National Congress]] dissidents led by [[Jivatram Kripalani]] founded the KMPP. Its 2 leaders : [[Prafulla Chandra Ghosh]] and [[Tanguturi Prakasam]], had been chief ministers of [[West Bengal]] and [[Madras Province|Madras]] respectively.&lt;ref name="Chandra" /&gt; It contested the very first parliamentary elections in 1951 in India. The party contested in 16 states and won nine seats in the [[Lok Sabha]], including six in [[Mysore state]],&lt;ref&gt;http://parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/lok01/state/01lsmd.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and one in [[Madras state]], Delhi and [[Vindhya Pradesh]] province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eci.gov.in/StatisticalReports/ElectionStatistics.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218010942/http://www.eci.gov.in/StatisticalReports/ElectionStatistics.asp |archivedate=18 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.assembly.tn.gov.in/archive/Resumes/review_01assly/table01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and 5.8% of the votes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48027">The '''Latin American and Caribbean Feminist Encuentros''' ({{lang-es|Encuentros Feministas Latinoamericanas y del Caribe}}) are a series conferences which began in 1981 to develop transnational networks within the region of [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]]. The main focus of the conferences was to discuss and evaluate how women's marginalization and oppression could be eliminated given the existing economic and political systems by forming networks and strategies to create alternatives to existing norms. At times contentious, the various conferences explored what feminism meant—whether it was an inclusive movement or limited by social class, racial make-up, or sexuality; whether it was militant or passive; whether it was political, social, or economic; whether it was designed to work within patriarchal systems or needed to create new systems; and even whether accepting funding invalidated being feminist. Numerous initiatives recognizing diverse groups of women, such as Black and indigenous women, lesbian women, and various cultural and economic groups were spawned by the dialogues. The conferences are an ongoing attempt to negotiate strategies in an attempt to change region-wide policy agendas toward women.

==History==
In 1975, the United Nations approved the celebration of [[International Women's Year]]. As part of the celebrations they held the [[First World Conference on Women]] in 1975 in [[Mexico City]]. At that meeting, it was proposed that the following decade be proclaimed UN Decade for Women and follow-up meetings to assess progress be held in 1980 and 1985. The General Assembly adopted a [[World Plan of Action]] with recommended targets for governments to integrate women's equality, development and participation in peace initiatives.{{sfn|Earth Summit|2002}} For the first time, institutional collection within the UN evaluated the extent of problems and conditions of women in varying nations, specifically separating data by sex to bring to light the level of inequality and discrimination towards women.{{sfn|Pietilä|2007|p=43}} It was also one of the first international meetings of organized lesbians from multiple countries and cultures.{{sfn|Bunch|Hinojosa|2000|p=5}} Attitudes within the member nations and the UN itself began to change as a result of the focus on women brought about by the conference.{{sfn|Pietilä|2007|p=45}} The conference connected women to other women in their struggles,{{sfn|Martin|2015}} as well as increasing governmental understanding of the needs of their constituent women. In turn, this led to a surge in women's activists coming together across the globe{{sfn|Maier|Lebon|2010|pp=21, 143}}{{sfn|Fraser|2013}} and the development of the Latin American and Caribbean Feminist Encuentros.{{sfn|Shayne|2007|p=1687}}

The diverse struggles of women throughout Latin America and the Caribbean had led by the 1970s to a rejection of feminism and the dubbing of women's movements as ''bourgeois'' outcropping of imperialists.{{sfn|Lavrin|2008}}{{sfn||Alvarez et al.|2002|p=543}} The abuse of women by the military regimes in Latin America through the decade between 1970 and 1980 as well as a shared [[Colonialism|colonial]] and [[Neocolonialism|neocolonial]] experience made women aware that gender issues needed to be re-examined as human rights challenges. The ''Encuentro''s were conceived as a means for women to share their diverse perspectives and create alternative strategies for coping with the [[marginalization]] which they experienced in the predominant [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] and [[Masculism|masculinist]] societal structures in which they lived.{{sfn|Lavrin|2008}}{{sfn||Alvarez et al.|2002|p=539}} The conferences were devoted to developing strategy to address economic inequality, fallout of colonialism and neocolonialism, political suppression, racism, and sexism,{{sfn|Anzaldúa|Keating|2013|p=441}} in the hopes of creating new collective methods to deal with health, political representation, poverty, violence and the invisibility of women's voices.{{sfn||Alvarez et al.|2002|p=539}} Ideologically, there was a recognition that women's rights were curtailed in both capitalistic and socialistic systems. The question became whether one should try to work within an existing system to improve women's agency, or advocate for change outside any existent political sphere.{{sfn|Stephen|1997|p=15}}

==First Encounter, Bogotá, Colombia 1981==
The First ''Encuentro'' was held in [[Bogotá]] in 1981 with 200 feminists and representing fifty [[NGO]]s from [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Curaçao]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Ecuador]], [[Panama]], [[Peru]], [[Puerto Rico]], and [[Venezuela]].{{sfn|Stephen|1997|p=15}} At this foundational meeting it was important for the women to discuss how they would define feminism. On the one hand were groups dismissing ''feministas'' as elites with no understanding of the political and social reality of middle- and lower-class women, and on the other hand, there were ''políticas'' or political militants, who were seen as radical leftists intent on continuing the revolutionary upheavals from which the various countries had so recently emerged.{{sfn||Alvarez et al.|2002|p=543}} Feminists argued that they were not focused on obtaining ''practical'' (feminine) goals, but rather wanted relevant, ''strategic'' (feminist) focus.{{sfn|Shayne|2007|p=1687}} The militants stressed that the only way to reach all women was with "leftist party organizing and revolutionary mobilization".{{sfn||Alvarez et al.|2002|p=543}}

The divide, in many ways mirrored the [[Cold War]] [[geopolitical]] divides of whether [[economics]], [[racism]], or [[sexism]] was the more important factor in the subordination of women.{{sfn|Bunch|2012|p=215}} This in turn led to discussion of whether existing systems needed reform, by institutionalizing feminist ideals, or whether women's issues needed to remain outside the political realm and maintain their autonomy and focus,{{sfn|De Cicco|2011}} instead of focusing on converting male leftists' policies to include women.{{sfn|Shayne|2007|p=1687}} The polarized positions were not resolved at the conference, leading to additional controversy in Peru; however, the conference attendees made a pledge to honor the [[Mirabal sisters]] and mark November 25 as a day to rally against violence toward women, which would later be adopted by the [[United Nations]] as the [[International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women]] in 1995.{{sfn|Gasa|2011}}

==Second Encounter, Lima, Peru, 1983==
The Second ''Encuentro'' was held in [[Lima]] from 19 to 22 July 1983. Expecting a crowd of 300 participants, organizers were stunned when over 600 women arrived. The group contained representatives from Argentina, Brazil, [[Bolivia]], Chile, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, [[Mexico]], and Puerto Rico, as well as many women living in exile in [[England]], [[Spain]], [[Switzerland]] and the United States.{{sfn|Campos Carr|1984|pp=26, 28}} Based on the theme "Patriarchy in Latin America", topics included economic development; empowerment; family; feminist history, literature and research; health; sexual violence; and sexuality.{{sfn|Campos Carr|1984|p=26}} Though no specific program to address lesbian issues and [[lesbophobia]] was planned, a group of lesbians organized a workshop, which was attended by around 200 participants. It was one of the first region-wide forums where issues were openly discussed and created the foundations of bonding Latina lesbians into support networks to work for their inclusion.{{sfn|Anzaldúa|Keating|2013|p=441}} Another unplanned topic emerged with the participation of the exiles and a letter read from a political prisoner from [[Bolivia]]. The discussion broadened to encompass women who were harassed and arrested for attempting to organize workers.{{sfn|Campos Carr|1984|pp=28-29}}

As with the previous conference, the polarization between whether women should create their own spaces or integrate with male-dominated spaces sparked debate and there was discussion on whether [[classism]] and the need to eliminate the struggle in social hierarchy was more important that gender struggle.{{sfn|Campos Carr|1984|p=26}} Because the perception lingered that feminists represented white and [[mestiza]], middle-class values, conflicts erupted with those who made up the majority of women working in the movement, i.e. poor, working-class, and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]], [[Afro-Caribbean]] or [[Afro-Latin Americans|Afro-Latina]]. State oppression and rampant poverty, had politicized many women who had previously been ignored in the fight for women's rights. In response to their dire economic situation, human rights abuses, and political repression, these more radical constituencies demanded to be heard and included in strategies.{{sfn|Alvarez et al.|2002|p=544}}

==Third Encounter, Bertioga, Brazil, 1985==
The Third ''Encuentro'' was held in [[Bertioga]], a municipality in the state of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] in 1985.{{sfn|Alvarez et al.|2002|p=545}} Representatives came from fourteen Latin American countries, as well as from Canada, Europe, the [[Netherland Antilles]] and the United States with over 850 women in attendance.{{sfn|Blasius|2001|p=82}} Coming in the midst of the [[Latin American debt crisis]], [[Central Intelligence Agency#Abuses of CIA authority, 1970s–1990s|CIA interference]] and U. S. military involvement in Latin America and the Caribbean, tensions at the conference were high.{{sfn|Sanatan|2016}} The question of inclusion was brought to the fore when a group of [[shanty town]] women from [[Rio de Janeiro]] arrived and asked to be admitted without paying the registration fee. Some thought they had been commandeered to attend to make a political statement about exclusion.{{sfn|Alvarez et al.|2002|p=545}}

In spite of the controversies, there were inclusionary programs added to the overall agenda such as workshops for the first time held on racism and one held to discuss [[Nicaragua]] and the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front|Sandinista Revolution]].{{sfn|Blasius|2001|p=82}} Lesbianism was included as part of the official conference programs and a series of workshops were held on lesbian issues. Out of the conference, the idea for the [[First Latin American and Caribbean Lesbian Feminist Encuentro]] was born. The event was planned to take place in [[Cuernavaca, Mexico]], one week before the Fourth ''Encuentro''.{{sfn|Anzaldúa|Keating|2013|p=441}}

==Fourth Encounter, Taxco, Mexico, 1987==
The Fourth ''Encuentro'' was held in [[Taxco]], in Mexico's [[Guerrero]] state in 1987 and was attended by over 1,500 women, many of whom came from adjoining Central America and were new to the concepts of feminism. Debate over who was a feminist intensified with those who had a long history in the movement frustrated at the lack of understanding of the grassroots activists who had recently joined in the dialogue.{{sfn|Alvarez et al.|2002|p=545}} Those on the opposite side of the debate drew up a document outlining the "myths of the feminist movement", which became an important tool in the ongoing discussions of inclusion. The ten myths included: 1. feminists are uninterested in power, 2. feminists practice politics in other ways, 3. all feminists are the same, 4. women are naturally united because of their gender, 5. feminism is only a policy of women towards women, 6. the movement is only small groups of women, 7. having specified spaces for women guarantees processes will be positive, 8. feminists apologize for being woman, 9. personal feminism is automatically political, and 10. consensus is democracy.{{sfn|D'Atri|2004}} By reiterating their differences and discussing them, there was recognition that the myths were the source of frustration and that their diversity did not necessarily divide their purpose. By acknowledging that it was not necessary for them to select a [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] path nor a [[homogeneous]] one,{{sfn|Gargallo|2009}} they were able to resolve the differences between them and recognize that feminism wasn't a concept that could be possessed or owned by any one group and that greater inclusion expanded their reach.{{sfn|D'Atri|2004}}{{sfn|Alvarez et al.|2002|p=546}}

==Fifth Encounter, San Bernardo, Argentina, 1990==
The Fifth ''Encuentro'' was held in [[San Bernardo del Tuyú]] in 1990 with around 3,200 participants. There was a marked increase in the number of networks throughout the region confirming that identity strategies had replaced the previous discussion of whether feminism should move forward in autonomous groups. The lesbian feminist network which had formed at an earlier conference and the Latin American and Caribbean Black Women’s Network formed in San Bernardo, were two of the organizations striving to build solidarity with the feminist movement through addressing the specific areas of marginalization.{{sfn|Alvarez et al.|2002|p=546}} Organized by a committee of Argentines and Uruguayans, the event was planned to take place at the union hall of the Argentine Federation of Light and Power Workers [[:es:Federación Argentina de Trabajadores de Luz y Fuerza|(es)]] ({{lang-es|Federación Argentina de Trabajadores de Luz y Fuerza}}), but the venue was canceled abruptly for political reasons. Instead the community opened doors to malls, gyms, cafés, hotel lobbies and meeting rooms to facilitate the women.{{sfn|Rodríguez|1990|p=33}}{{sfn|"Quinto encuentro"|2013}}

The focus of the meeting were the challenges and responses to those challenges for feminism in the 1990s, with an acknowledgement that diversity enriched the movement, but in turn caused complexity and conflicts. Specific topics on building bridges with other social actors, and political perspectives and strategies.{{sfn|"Quinto encuentro"|2013}} These main topics led to discussion on a variety of issues, including culture, daily life, education, economics, health, identity, labor, power, sexuality and other issues. One of the most central challenges addressed was violence against women and a march was held on September 24 supporting an anti-violence stance.{{sfn|Rodríguez|1990|p=33}} Four days later, a second march with more than five thousand women participants mobilized to declare September 28 as the Day of the Right to Abortion. They called not only for the decriminalization of abortion, but also for abolishing laws which punished women who had abortions.{{sfn|Ortiz|2016}}

==Sixth Encounter, Costa del Sol, El Salvador, 1993==
The Sixth ''Encuentro'' was held in Costa del Sol, [[El Salvador]] in 1993{{sfn|Alvarez et al.|2002|p=547}} and was plagued by attempts from conservative factions in El Salvador to shut down the conference.{{sfn|Stephen|1997|p=17}} A right-wing magazine called ''Gente'' claimed that all of the participants were lesbian and "possibly infected with AIDs" and several participants received death threats. The 1,500 participants showed up anyway and there were no violent incidents.{{sfn|Stephen|1997|p=18-19}} The attempt to stop the ''encuentro'' had the opposite effect, bringing publicity and recognition to the women's struggle for equality and a life free from violence.{{sfn|Stephen|1997|p=82}} For the first time, [[Afro-Caribbean]] women attended as did Andean indigenous women.{{sfn|Stephen|1997|p=19}} Through the various workshops, the women focused on methods to incorporate women’s diversity in building the movement and avenues to work inside and outside patriarchal systems.{{sfn|Stephen|1997|p=20}}

Having thought the issue of whether feminism was an elitist movement was behind them, participants reminded of the divide when women from poverty-stricken, rural environments complained about the posh accommodations. In addition, coming just after the end of the [[Salvadoran Civil War]], revolutionary dogmatism resurfaced and organizers worked to regain ground about inclusiveness.{{sfn|Alvarez et al.|2002|p=550}} A major development at the conference was the discussion of preparation for the [[World Conference on Women, 1995]] to be held in [[Beijing]]. Many of the participant at the ''encuentro'' were unaware of the UN Decade for Women and were fearful of accepting money from [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) to attend, given the inverntionist US policies in Latin America of the past.{{sfn|Alvarez et al.|2002|pp=551-552}} They were in agreement that the NGO Forum leader should not be the conservative Chilean businesswoman who had been appointed to head the Latin discussion in Beijing, but were not in agreement with the way that some members had gone about replacing the Chilean with a feminist without bringing nominations to the group at large. Overall, enthusiasm to participate in Beijing was high and participants left the conference making plans to attend.{{sfn|Alvarez et al.|2002|p=552}}

==Seventh Encounter, Cartagena, Chile, 1996==
The Seventh ''Encuentro'' was held in [[Cartagena, Chile]] in 1996 and was best by internal struggles. A small group of autonomist feminists, as opposed to women working within institutions, were in charge, as a broader range of Chilean feminists had been unwilling to work with the organizing committee.{{sfn|Waterman|2001|p=172}}{{sfn|Alvarez et al.|2002|p=554}} The conference was boycotted by the majority of Chilean feminists and attendance was significantly lower than previous events. Estimates vary on the participation, but generally agree there were less than 700 delegates,{{sfn|Waterman|2001|p=172}} principally because the organizing group refused to include anyone they deemed to be insufficiently feminist,{{sfn|Ríos Tobar|2006|p=118}} branding those who had integrated with government organizations or formalized their organization as sell-outs to patriarchy and capitalism.{{sfn|Alvarez et al.|2002|p=555}}

Three themes had been selected, political  and  philosophical  frameworks; invisibility and discrimination; and strategies for change; however, the rigidity of the organizers, allowing only prepared papers to be read without discussion or participation were seen by many as violating the spirit of the ''encuentros''.{{sfn|Alvarez et al.|2002|p=556}} A group of 300-400 women split off from the designated discussion sessions, forming a third group calling themselves "neither one or the other" and tried to find a way to solve the polarization. To this group, whether an NGO did or did not have funding, was or was not official or was grassroots, was irrelevant, if they could forward the transformation of women's lives and society.{{sfn|Alvarez et al.|2002|p=557}} The combative style of the autonomists and their personal attacks, prohibited discussion on issues with which the majority of participants were concerned.{{sfn|Beckman|2015}} Despite the divides, planning was set for another conference three years hence.{{sfn|Alvarez et al.|2002|p=557}}

==Eighth Encounter, Juan Dolio, Dominican Republic, 1999==
The Eighth ''Encuentro'' was held in [[Juan Dolio]] in the [[Dominican Republic]] in November 1999.{{sfn|Alvarez et al.|2002|p=557}} Organizers pushed the dissension of the previous conference into the background, focusing instead on building feminist camaraderie. Focusing on feminine values and a dynamic cultural interaction, including theater, dance and art, Dominican organizers were able to bridge divides.{{sfn|Beckman|2015}}{{sfn|Alvarez et al.|2002|p=558}} In addition, the conference, the first one with wide participation of non-Hispanic Caribbean women{{sfn|Beckman|2015}} brought together nearly 1,300 participants to discuss the themes of domination of women, the dynamics of power relationships, and forging regional alliances.{{sfn|Alvarez et al.|2002|p=558}}

The sharing of "herstories" and the Dominican organizers' goal of creating space for both those who wanted to experience shared time with other women and those who wanted to strategize served as a healing process for participants.{{sfn|Alvarez et al.|2002|p=559}} The conference was not without conflict, as the relationship between Dominican and Haitian women and the intense racism faced by Haitians living in the Dominican Republic spilled into the conference. Some Haitian participants felt they were marginalized because of inadequate translation services at the conference. But in the tone of reconciliation, petitions were circulated to protest deportation of Haitian immigrants.{{sfn|Beckman|2015}} The ''encuentro'' also pointed to the divide between members of the Anglo-, Fracophone and Hispanic Caribbean, not only in terms of language, but in terms of inclusion and the diaspora, as it opened conversation on whether Caribbeans living abroad were seen as elites.{{sfn|Alvarez et al.|2002|pp=568-569}}

==Ninth Encounter, Playa Tambor, Costa Rica, 2002==
The Ninth ''Encuentro'' was held in Playa Tambor, [[Costa Rica]] from 1–5 December 2002 on the theme of "Active Resistance in the Face of Neoliberal Globalization".{{sfn|Feminist International Radio Endeavour|2002}} The event was attended by 820 women representing 20 countries from throughout the region.{{sfn|Latin American and Caribbean Women's Health Network|2002}} As had been seen in the previous ''encuentro'' there was little participation from the Anglo- and Franco-Caribbean and surprisingly little attendance by indigenous women; however, the organizers learned from the previous conference and provided translation services at all group sessions from Spanish into English, French and Portuguese.{{sfn|Curiel|2003|p=3}} A novel approach had been taken to financing the conference and for the first time, fees were not the main source of revenues and constituted only one-third of the revenues. For the first time, funds from such organizations as the [[Global Fund for Women]], [[Mama Cash]], [[UNIFEM]] and other funding organizations were utilized to make up a third of the cost with the final one-third coming from fundraising.{{sfn|Feminist International Radio Endeavour|2002}}

The women evaluated both the negative and positive aspects of globalization, providing greater opportunities to women and simultaneously harming them.{{sfn|Latin American and Caribbean Women's Health Network|2002}} For example, mproved communications technologies have allowed women to have greater communication with others in the movement and expand their message and yet, it is difficult for women to find funding for initiatives.{{sfn|Feminist International Radio Endeavour|2002}} Economically and politically, they noted the double standard using financial resources to simultaneously support conflict and social improvement, the problem of policies which reinforce patriarchy and the continued effects of poverty and violence,{{sfn|Latin American and Caribbean Women's Health Network|2002}} which spiraling national debt caused by [[neoliberalism]] has acerbated.{{sfn|Tompkins|2008|p=8}}

==Tenth Encounter, Serra Negra, Brazil, 2005==
The Tenth ''Encuentro'' was held in [[Serra Negra]] in 2005{{sfn|Tompkins|2008|p=11}} and was made up of more than 1,250 participants from 26 countries. The theme of the event was "Radicalization of feminism, radicalization of democracy" and evaluated whether democracy could eliminate discrimination and inequalities with its patriarchal structure. There was discussion of how taking on identities such as Black, mestiza, lesbian, among others is a political statement, challenging the cultural norms. Acknowledging the identity is both empowering and leads to anguish. Recognizing that the promise of democracy was government by the people, which left women out, created a disproportionate impoverishment and led to discrimination, which can only be expunged if women actively participate and demand their autonomy.{{sfn|Pizarro|2005}}

It was the first of the conferences to discuss in-depth the diversity of age, ethnicity, race and sexual identity and how those differences alter the complexities involved in developing a feminist strategy. Debate included evaluating feminist racism, power, and representation of research subjects and their objectification.{{sfn|Blackwell|2012|p=724}} There was also a recognition that women's rights, or even human rights, as defined by the dominant culture, are practiced in the realm of exclusion. Because of the patriarchal nature of rights and law, only men have been fully legally protected. The challenge for feminists is to develop means that their own autonomy and collective rights are protected and valued.{{sfn|Blackwell|2012|p=725}}

==Eleventh Encounter, Mexico City, Mexico, 2009==
The Eleventh Encuentro was held in [[Mexico City]] from March 16 to 20, 2009,{{sfn|''Cimac Noticias''|2009}} with approximately 1,600 participants.{{sfn|Ruiz|2009}} Many of the issues from the previous ''encuentro'' were brought to the fore, including a session in which indigenous women discussed their objectification,{{sfn|Meckesheimer|2013|p=86}} as well as the issues of autonomy and accepting funding from governmental type agencies which are patriarchal.{{sfn|Falquet|2013|p=50}}

New issues at the conference were the inclusion of trans-women which some felt had been included without input from the collective group{{sfn|Falquet|2013|p=50}} and the issue of using sexual violence to subdue opposition in armed conflict. Repudiation of [[femicide]] and ongoing violence against women was not a new theme, but developing strategies to protect women in conflict situations and keeping the situation from being buried became a focal point.{{sfn|Ruiz|2009}}

==Twelfth Encounter, Bogotá, Colombia, 2011==
The Twelfth ''Encuentro'' was held in [[Bogotá]], from 23 to 26 November 2011{{sfn|De Cicco|2011}} with around 1,200 in attendance.{{sfn|Huamán Andía|2012|p=2}} For the first time, the group was split with autonomous feminists attending sessions from the 18 to 21 November and then the traditional ''encuentro'' occurring at the later date with institutional feminists as well as autonomists.{{sfn|Martín|2011}} Topics discussed included inclusion of trans-women,{{sfn|Huamán Andía|2012|pp=3-4}} abortion, armed conflict, social class, ecology, race, refugees, and sexuality, among others.{{sfn|Martín|2011}} The contentious discussions of whether utilizing funds from patriarchal institutions undermined feminism were discussed again. Many felt that as long as there is transparency, the use of such funding sources did not compromise the struggles.{{sfn|Huamán Andía|2012|p=7}}

==Thirteenth Encounter, Lima, Peru, 2014==
The Thirteenth ''Encuentro'' was held in Lima, from 22 to 25 November 2014. The topics of the three main sessions were interculturality and intersectionality, sustainable life, and the body and territory. For each session a seminar was organized and discussion followed. The sessions discussed a multitude of issues, such as how to maintain one's identity and economic productivity when patriarchal systems devalue women's contributions, whether binary categories of sexuality are limiting to a full discussion of feminism, finding balance between men and women as well as between humans and nature, marginalization, political participation, among others. The discussion surrounding the intersectionality showed how feminism and creating strategy for policy overlaps and affects peasants, intellectuals, diverse sexualities, different classes, races, making it imperative that all diversity have a place in the discussion.{{sfn|Domínguez|2015}} At this conference, there was a full incorporation of trans-women for the first time{{sfn|Friedman|2014|p=24}} and a discussion on the recognition of sex workers.{{sfn|Domínguez|2015}}

Tensions were present, in that Afro-Latina and Afro-Caribbean women felt left out of the discussions. Another polarizing issue was whether the next ''encuentro'' should take place in [[Bolivia]] or [[Uruguay]]. Both sides had supporters and detractors, one side saying that Bolivia would serve to emphasize the marginalization of indigenous women and the other with the view that all women are marginalized and one group should not be given more emphasis than another. Another question concerning the location was the cost and preparedness. In the final vote, Uruguay won the nod.{{sfn|Domínguez|2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2243">The '''League of Nations Society''' was a political group devoted to campaigning for an international organisation of nations, with the aim of preventing war.

The society was founded in 1915 by [[Leonard Courtney, 1st Baron Courtney of Penwith|Baron Courtney]] and [[Willoughby Dickinson, 1st Baron Dickinson|Willoughby Dickinson]], both members of the British [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], and [[Charles Cripps, 1st Baron Parmoor|Baron Parmoor]], a member of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].  The group campaigned for the establishment of the [[League of Nations]], its interest mostly motivated by pacifism, and opposition to [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="cline"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cline |first1=Catherine Ann |title=Recruits to Labour |date=1963 |publisher=Syracuse University Press |location=Syracuse, New York |page=16&amp;ndash;17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The society was influenced by the proposals of the [[Bryce Group]], and many of that group's members also held membership of the society.  However, it differed from the Bryce Group in proposing that the future international league should be able to impose sanctions in order to enforce arbitration decisions, not just to compel nations to take disputes into arbitration.&lt;ref name="cline" /&gt;

The society grew quickly, appointing [[Margery Spring Rice]] as its secretary,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Working_class_Wives.html?id=tt2EGwAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Working-class Wives: Their Health and Conditions|last=Spring Rice|first=Margery Garrett|date=1 January 1939|publisher=Penguin Books|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and within a couple of years had several thousand members.&lt;ref name="cline" /&gt;  By 1917, [[Woodrow Wilson]] supported the principle of a League of Nations, and less radical supporters of the idea formed the League of Free Nations Association.  In 1918, the two organisations merged, forming the [[League of Nations Union]].&lt;ref name="cline" /&gt;

The party is led by [[Emma Bonino]], leader of the [[Italian Radicals]] and former minister.

==History==
More Europe was launched in November 2017, seeking to participate in the [[Italian general election, 2018|2018 general election]] within the [[centre-left coalition]] centred on the [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]] (PD).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.it/2017/11/13/pd-radicali-incontro-al-nazareno-in-vista-delle-elezioni_a_23275409 Pd-Radicali, incontro al Nazareno in vista delle elezioni]&lt;/ref&gt; The founding members were two liberal and distinctively pro-Europeanist parties: the [[Italian Radicals]] (RI), whose leading members included [[Emma Bonino]] (a former minister of International Commerce and Foreign Affairs), [[Riccardo Magi]] and [[Marco Cappato]], and [[Forza Europa (2017)|Forza Europa]] (FE), led by [[Benedetto Della Vedova]], a former Radical elected in [[Italian general election, 2013|2013]] with [[Future and Freedom]] (FLI) and later transitated through [[Civic Choice]] (SC). The RI and FE were joined by individual members of the [[Civics and Innovators]] (CI) sub-group in the [[Chamber of Deputies (Italy)|Chamber of Deputies]], formed by former SC members (two CI deputies, [[Andrea Mazziotti]] and [[Stefano Dambruoso]], were already involved with FE).

[[Angelo Bonelli]], coordinator of the [[Federation of the Greens]], had earlier proposed to the Radicals a joint list together with [[Giuliano Pisapia]]'s [[Progressive Camp]] (CP) named "Ecology, Europe, Rights".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.repubblica.it/politica/2017/11/23/news/radicali_italiani_lista_europeista-181892110/ Radicali italiani, ecco la lista europeista di Bonino e Della Vedova]&lt;/ref&gt; However, Pisapia announced that he would not run in the election and declared CP's experience over, while the Radicals organised +E.

In early January 2018 Bonino and Della Vedova announced that +E would run as a stand-alone list, due to technical reasons associated with the new electoral laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corriere.it/politica/18_gennaio_01/elezioni-2018-bonino-la-lista-europa-costretta-correre-sola-elezioni-03d7e7d8-ef22-11e7-97e1-31c2bf5f7cef.shtml Bonino: «La lista +Europa costretta a correre da sola alle elezioni»]&lt;/ref&gt; While the PD leadership was trying to find a solution to those problems,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ildubbio.news/ildubbio/2018/01/03/elezioni-renzi-speriamo-di-risolvere-problemi-con-piu-europa Elezioni, Renzi: Speriamo di risolvere I problemi con Più Europa]&lt;/ref&gt; on 4 January, [[Bruno Tabacci]], leader of the [[Centrism|centrist]], mostly [[Christian democracy|Christian-democratic]] and also pro-Europeanist [[Democratic Centre (Italy)|Democratic Centre]] (CD), announced that his party would join the coalition +E, in alliance with the PD, in order to overcome those issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corriere.it/politica/18_gennaio_04/tabacci-salva-lista-bonino-il-4-marzo-europa-ci-sara-20c7f420-f15f-11e7-b33d-56f05ccceb4d.shtml Tabacci salva la lista di Bonino: «Il 4 marzo +Europa ci sarà»]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lastampa.it/2018/01/04/italia/politica/elezioni-bonino-grazie-tabacci-europa-sar-lunica-lista-pienamente-europeista-GJWpji62WisnrGz7MmSEMP/pagina.html Elezioni, Tabacci salva la lista di Emma Bonino: “Niente firme, il 4 marzo ci saremo”]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.repubblica.it/politica/2018/01/04/news/rosatellum_bonino_imbroglio_battaglia_giurisdizionale_elezioni_2018_legge_elettorale-185796021 Rosatellum, Tabacci: "Esenzione simbolo Centro Democratico a disposizione per lista Bonino"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in January, +E was enlarged also to the [[Progressive Area]] (AP), a small left-wing party emerged from the dissolution of the [[Progressive Camp]] (CP),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.piumezzogiorno.it/8944/politica/centrosinistra-area-progressista-europa.html Centrosinistra, intesa raggiunta tra Area Progressista e +Europa]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazzettinodisalerno.it/joomla/politica/item/16788-elezioni-area-progressista-a-sostegno-di-europa Elezioni, Area Progressista a sostegno di +Europa]&lt;/ref&gt; a would-be party launched by [[Giuliano Pisapia]] (Pisapia did not join and AP itself would never be a full member of +E). Also in January, Bonino officially announced the alliance with the centre-left.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.repubblica.it/politica/2018/01/20/news/gentiloni_correra_nel_collegio_uninominale_roma_1_-186907642/?ref=RHPPLF-BH-I0-C8-P2-S1.8-T1 Il centrosinistra al voto con una coalizione a 4: Pd con +Europa, Civica Popolare e Insieme]&lt;/ref&gt;

The list won 2.6% of the vote in the election, falling short of the 3% threshold, but had three elects in single-seat constituencies (Bonino to the Senate, Magi and Tabacci to the Chamber) and one among Italians abroad ([[Alessandro Fusacchia]], a Radical, in the European constituency).

In July 2018 +E started to organise itself as a full-fledged party. It was decided that a committee, presided by [[Gianfranco Spadaccia]] (a long-time Radical), would lead +E until the founding congress, scheduled for January 2019. The newly-formed committee appointed Della Vedova as coordinator.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.forzaeuropa.it/europa-e-ripartita&lt;/ref&gt;

Mosler (1997-98) "Full Employment and Price Stability" ''[[Journal of Post Keynesian Economics]]'', 20(2), 167-182&lt;/ref&gt; and advocated by [[Modern Money Theory]] as replacement for [[NAIRU|NAIRU (non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment)]]. The concept of NAIBER is related to the idea of a [[Job Guarantee]] aimed to create [[full employment]] and price stability, by having the state promise to hire unemployed workers as an [[employer of last resort]] (ELR).&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;[[L. Randall Wray]], [http://neweconomicperspectives.blogspot.com/2009/08/job-guarantee.html "Job Guarantee"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.it/books?id=tdQMAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA328&amp;lpg=PA328&amp;dq=wray+%22naiber%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fisPFxi1W3&amp;sig=BUpG2T-YLizR6AlhHR1Y9LwKFuQ&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwivqYSpuezZAhWGtxQKHbjhCBkQ6AEINjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=wray%20%22naiber%22&amp;f=false Phil Lawn: “Globalisation, Economic Transition and the Environment -Forging a Path to Sustainable Development”, Edward Elgar Publishing, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
If the [[Phillips curve]] displays [[hysteresis#Economics|hysteresis]] - that is, if episodes of high unemployment raise the NAIRU - the NAIRU analysis is especially problematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

|title=Hysteresis in Unemployment: Old and New Evidence
|url = http://www.nber.org/papers/w14818.pdf
|year=2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt;   This could happen, for example, if unemployed workers lose skills so that employers prefer to bid up of the wages of existing workers when demand increases, rather than hiring the unemployed. Economists as [[Abba Lerner]] and [[Hyman Minsky]] have argued that a similar effect can be achieved without the human costs of unemployment via a [[Job Guarantee]] (JG), where rather than being unemployed, those who cannot find work in the private sector should be employed by the government. This theory, and the policy of the JG replaces the NAIRU with the NAIBER (non-accelerating inflation buffer employment ratio).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''buffer employment ratio'' (BER) is the ratio of JG employment to total employment. The BER conditions the overall rate of wage demands. When the BER is high, real wage demands will be correspondingly lower. If inflation exceeds the government’s announced target, tighter fiscal and monetary policy would be triggered to increase the BER, which entails workers transferring from the inflating sector to the fixed price JG sector. Ultimately this attenuates the inflation spiral. So instead of a buffer stock of unemployed being used to discipline the distributional struggle, the JG policy achieves this via compositional shifts in employment. Replacing the current ''non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment'' ([[NAIRU]]), the BER that results in stable inflation is called the ''non-accelerating inflation buffer employment ratio'' (NAIBER). It is a full employment steady state JG level, which is dependent on a range of factors including the path of the economy.&lt;ref&gt;W.F. Mitchell and J. Muysken (2008).

'''National Planning Commission''' (NPC) of Nepal is advisory body for formulating development plans and policies of the country under the directives of the National Development Council of the government of [[Nepal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhrcnepal.org/nhrc_about.html |title=Introduction::NHRC |publisher=Nhrcnepal.org |date= |accessdate=2015-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gdnet.org/~organizations/National%20Planning%20Commission%20(NPC),%20Government%20of%20Nepal |title=GDN :: GDNet :: GDN's Knowledge Services Portal |publisher=GDNet.org |date= |accessdate=2015-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pustakalaya.org/list.php?cat=quick_filter&amp;search_keys%5B0%5D=National+Planning+Commission |title=National Planning Commission |publisher=Pustakalaya.org |accessdate=2015-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the apex advisory body of the Government of Nepal for formulating a national vision, periodic plans and policies for development. It is headed by the Right Honorable Prime Minister. The NPC assesses resource needs, identifies sources of funding, and allocates budget for socio-economic development. It serves as a central agency for monitoring and evaluating development plans, policies and programs. The NPC also serves as an intellectual hub for the exchange of new development ideas and proposals from scholars, private sector, civil society, and development partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.npc.gov.np/en|title=National Planning Commission|website=www.npc.gov.np|access-date=2017-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Planning Commission was first created in Nepal in 1956. It was soon renamed in accordance with the Yojana Mandal Act of 1957. Following the introduction of the partyless Panchayat system in 1961, the National Planning Council was formed under the then king. In 1963, the Council was dissolved and a new planning body, with an identical name, was constituted under the Chairman of the Council of Ministers. All the Ministers became [[ex-officio]] members of the Council; and the Ministry of Economic Affairs was renamed the Ministry of Economic Planning.

In 1968, all tasks related to development budget and foreign aid hitherto carried out by the Ministry of Economic Planning were assigned to the Ministry of Finance. The National Planning Council then morphed into the National Planning Commission (NPC) under the Chairmanship of the Prime Minister. A 1972 study on the functions and responsibilities of the central planning agency resulted in the reconstitution of the NPC.

After the historic restoration of multiparty democracy in 1990, the newly elected government reconstituted the NPC again with the Prime Minister as Chair, a full-time Vice-Chairman, five Members, and a Member-Secretary. The current organization and functions of the NPC draw on the Executive Order issued by the cabinet in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.npc.gov.np/en/page/2/about_us/introduction_history|title=Introduction &amp; History : National Planning Commission|website=www.npc.gov.np|access-date=2017-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Partido Galeguista''' ('''Galicianist Party''') was a [[Galician nationalism|Galician nationalist]] party founded in December 1931. It achieved notoriety during the time of the [[Spanish Second Republic]]. The PG grouped a number of historical [[Galicia (Spain)|Galician]] intellectuals, and was fundamental in the elaboration of the [[Galician Statute of Autonomy (1936)|Galician Statute of Autonomy]].

==Origins==
In December 1931 the ''{{ill|Partido Galeguista de Pontevedra|gl|Partido Galeguista de Pontevedra}}'' (Galicianist Party of Pontevedra), directed by [[Castelao]] and [[Alexandre Bóveda]], called for a General Nationalist Assembly in order to create an all-Galician nationalist party. A total of 32 [[Galicianism (Galicia)|Galicianist]] organizations attended, including the ''[[Irmandades da Fala]]'' (Brotherhoods of the Language) and the ''[[Partido Nazonalista Republicán de Ourense]]'' (Republican Nationalist Party of Ourense), among others.

The PG was a plural party hosting different political tendencies, and where internal tensions were not uncommon. The PG initially embraced:

* Right-wing conservatives, who rejected the idea of forming alliances with left-wing parties. These were individuals such as [[Vicente Risco]], [[Antón Vilar Ponte|Vilar Ponte]], [[Xosé Filgueira Valverde|Filgueira Valverde]]
* Liberals, such as [[Otero Pedrayo]], [[Ramón Plácido Castro|Plácido Castro]]
* Left-wing sympathizers, such as [[Alexandre Bóveda]], [[Castelao]], [[Carvalho Calero]], [[Ramón Suárez Picallo|Suárez Picallo]], [[Johán Vicente Viqueira]], [[Álvaro das Casas]], [[Ramón Vilar Ponte]], 
* Supporters of the Galician [[secession]], such as [[Fuco Gómez]] or the [[Buenos Aires]] organization ''Sociedade Nazionalista Gallega Pondal'' 
* Non-aligned: [[Álvaro Cunqueiro]], [[Florentino López Cuevillas|López Cuevillas]]

==Political ideas==
The political programme of the PG revolved around the ideals established by the ''[[Irmandades da Fala]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Beramendi and Núñez Seixas (1996:148)&lt;/ref&gt; that is, considering Galicia as a cultural unit entitled to political [[self-determination]]. In order to achieve this the minimum required was forming a Galician Parliament and a Galician Government. It also aimed at eliminating [[clientelism]], supporting [[anti-imperialism]] and equal rights for the women. Furthermore, the PG claimed for the suppression of the provincial governments (perceived as a redundant administrative structure) and the establishment of the parish as an official territorial tier. Official status for the [[Galician language]] and [[agrarian reform]] were also in the agenda.

Independence was never a priority for the PG, as independentists were a minority within the party. It was thought that Galicia could operate within the framework of a Spanish [[federal republic]]. Yet, War and the impossibility to establish such a federal republic led to disappointment. In a later stage, around 1944, PG's president and intellectual leader, Castelao, began to consider the option of full independence.&lt;ref&gt;See full article on [[Castelao]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the PG expressed a strong [[pro-Europeanism]],&lt;ref&gt;Castelao often commented on his wish to "one day see the emergence of a 'United States of Europe' " (''Sempre en Galiza'', 1944).&lt;/ref&gt; situating the party ahead of its time on this issue. They also supported the strengthening of the [[League of Nations]] (predecessor of the UN) as a tool to solve international conflicts. In 1933, the PG successfully requested the admission of Galicia into the League as a [[stateless nation]]. Those negotiations were conducted by [[Ramón Plácido Castro|Plácido Castro]].[http://www.vieiros.com/nova/69052/setembro-de-1933-galiza-unha-nacion-en-europa][http://www.igadi.org/fundacion_placido_castro/placido_ramon_castro_del_rio_us.htm]

==Consolidation==
In 1932 the PG works alongside the ''Partido Republicano Gallego'' (Galician Republican Party) and ''Acción Republicana'' (Republican Action) in the drafting and promotion of the [[Galician Statute of Autonomy (1936)|Statute of Autonomy]]. The PG negotiates a number of pacts with local parties and in 1933 it takes part in the local elections, obtaining a single local deputy for [[Ourense]]. This issue opens the debate in the PG, as some wanted to seek alliances with republican parties (left-wing), something which was frontally rejected by the conservatives.

The conservative pressure within the party forces PG to take part at the [[Spanish general election, 1933|1933 general Spanish elections]] on its own. The 106,000 votes obtained are not enough to grant a seat at the [[Spanish Parliament]]. Furthermore, the new conservative Spanish government halts the development of the Statute of Autonomy, bans PG's newspaper ''A Nosa Terra'', and relocates [[Castelao]] and [[Alexandre Bóveda|Bóveda]] far from Galicia (they were civil servants).

In its Third Assembly, January 1934, the PG eventually decides to ally with left-wing republican parties, with the opposition of [[Vicente Risco]]. This decision is ratified in the Fourth Assembly, April 1935, this time with the opposition of [[Otero Pedrayo]]. Thus, the conservative sector leaves the PG to found ''[[Dereita Galeguista]]'' (Galicianist Right-Wing). The PG then openly becomes a left-wing party.

==''Frente Popular''==
In June 1935 the PG initiates negotiations with [[Republican Left (Spain)|''Izquierda Republicana'']] (Republican Left), and in January 1936 the PG decides to integrate itself in the [[Popular Front (Spain)|''Frente Popular'']] (Popular Front). Hence, the PG presented five Galicianist candidates to the [[Spanish general election, 1936|Spanish general election of 1936]], namely: Castelao, Bóveda, Xerardo Álvarez Gallego, Ramón Suárez Picallo and Antón Villar Ponte.

In the province of [[Lugo (province)|Lugo]] the PG ran on its own, since specific pacts for that province could not be formalized, thus obtaining no representatives. However, out of the five candidates the PG obtains three seats in the Spanish Parliament. These are Castelao, Súarez Picallo and Vilar Ponte, with a combined total of some 287,000 votes. As a consequence, in June 1936 the Statute of Autonomy is put to the vote with the help of the ''Frente Popular'', and the "yes" wins with an overwhelming majority.

==Civil War==
Following the revolt of general [[Francisco Franco]] in July 1936, and the start of the [[Spanish Civil War]], normal political life comes to an end. Galicia soon falls under the control of Franco's [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist]] troops and PG members are prosecuted. Some of them are captured and executed, such as Johán Carballeira, Ánxel Casal, Manuel Lustres Rivas, Camilo Díaz Baliño, Víctor Casas or one of the main leaders of the party, [[Alexandre Bóveda]]. Others are forced into exile, like the president of the party, [[Castelao]], who was in [[Madrid]] when the war started and managed to flee.

In 1937 the PG establishes a delegation in [[Barcelona]], still a republican area, and publishes the magazine ''Nova Galicia'' between April 1937 and July 1938. Castelao and Suárez Picallo call for the unity of all democratic forces in Spain to preserve the Republic, while maintaining the Galicianist ideals. In 1938, after the fall of Barcelona, the Galicianists in the area move to France and from there to South America.

==The underground==
As soon as the Civil War ended in 1939, Galicianists tried to get in touch again in order to rebuild the party in Galicia. The PG appeared in the underground in July 1943, when 19 members meet in Coruxo and decide to form a temporary executive committee, including Manuel Gómez Román, Otero Pedrayo and Plácido Castro. Yet, in this new period, [[Francisco Fernández del Riego]] and [[Ramón Piñeiro]] had the most active role.

One of the priorities was to establish contacts with the rest of the Galician opposition to the [[Spain under Franco|Francoist regime]], and also with [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque]] and [[Catalonia|Catalan]] nationalists. In 1944 the PG forms together with the [[Spanish Socialist Party]], [[Confederacion Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]], [[Union General de Trabajadores|UGT]], and other trade unions, the ''Junta Gallega de Alianza Democrática'' (Galician Union for the Democratic Alliance).

Ramón Piñeiro was detained in 1946. Fermín Penzol took responsibility for keeping contact with the other organizations. With the release of Piñeiro in 1949, and in the light that the underground activity did not produce any palpable results,&lt;ref&gt;Fernández del Riego (1990:190)&lt;/ref&gt; the PG led by Piñeiro decides to prioritise the defence of Galician culture, gradually abandoning the political activity. This was severely criticised by the Galicianists in exile. Hence, the foundation of the ''{{ill|Galaxia publishing house|lt=Galaxia|gl|Editorial Galaxia}}'' publishing house, in 1950 marks the self-dissolution of the PG in Galicia. From that date militants in Galicia take part in the new cultural strategy, which revolved around ''Galaxia''.

==The PG in the Americas==
In 1932 a branch of the PG was created in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina. This was the ''Organizacion Nazionalista Repubricana Galega'' (Galician Republican Nationalist Organization). It had 150 members and was led by Rodolfo Prada. At the time of the Civil War it changes its name to ''Grupo Galeguista de Bos Aires'' (Galicianist Group of Buenos Aires). In 1941 it takes the name of ''Irmandade Galega'' (Galician Brotherhood). In 1942, with the massive arrival or Galician expatriates to Buenos Aires (including Castelao), this same group relaunches the PG newspaper ''A Nosa Terra''. In 1944, ''Irmandade Galega'', with the support of Castelao, establish the ''Consello de Galiza'', a sort of Galician government in exile.

There was also a branch of the PG in [[Uruguay]], named ''Irmandade Galeguista do Uruguai'', led my Manuel Meilán. In 1949 the PG only had a total of some 200 active militants scattered around Buenos Aires and other Argentinian cities, [[Montevideo]] (Uruguay), [[Mexico]] and [[Havana]] (Cuba). With the cessation of the political activities of the PG in Galicia, the PG abroad quickly faded out, especially after the death of Castelao, the historical leader of the party, in 1950.

A '''prime suspect''' or '''key suspect''' is a person who is considered by the [[law enforcement agency]] investigating a crime to be the most likely [[suspect]].&lt;ref name=dictcom&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/prime%20suspect "Prime suspect"]. ''Dictionary.com's 21st Century Lexicon''. [[Dictionary.com]], LLC. 06 Aug. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/p/prime-suspect/ |title=prime suspect |work=USLegal.com |author= |date= |accessdate=August 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idiom "prime suspect" believed to have originated in 1931.&lt;ref name=dictcom/&gt; "Key suspect" is seen as early as 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GQpF3IvhAK8C&amp;q=%22key+suspect%22 |title=Congressional Record Volume 94, Part 9|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |author= |year=1948 |page= A-695 |accessdate=August 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various reasons a person may be considered a prime suspect. These include:
*Being positively identified as the only person seen at or near the scene of the crime around the time the crime occurred
*Being linked by some form of [[forensic evidence]], such as [[DNA evidence|DNA]]
*Being named by [[witness]](es)
*Having the most likely [[Motive (law)|motive]] to commit the crime
*Having knowledge that only one who committed the crime would have
*Having a history of committing crimes with some resemblance to the crime being investigated
*Having [[Confession (law)|confessed]] to the act

==Introduction==
Push Video is an active [[notification system]] with the function of sending video. The technology enables notifications show up on [[mobile phone]]s when uncommon events occurs. It works with [[Surveillance|surveillance system]] like [[IP camera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avtech.com.tw/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=225&amp;Itemid=446 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023183202/http://www.avtech.com.tw/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=225&amp;Itemid=446 |archivedate=2013-10-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The notification allows people to check the video playback on their devices, includes Galaxy, [[iPhone]], [[iPad]] and other [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices.&lt;ref&gt;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=push.lite.avtech.com&lt;/ref&gt; The Push Video is triggered by the [[EagleEyes]]  and IPmotion applications; being one of their main functions. It has been applied to [[Avtech Corp.|AVTECH’s]] and Hunt Electronic full range products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avtech.com.tw/index.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724051638/http://www.avtech.com.tw/index.php |archivedate=2013-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hunt.com.tw&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The naming of Push Video starts from the "Push mail" of [[BlackBerry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://event.taiwanmobile.com/blackberry/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605064310/http://event.taiwanmobile.com/blackberry/ |archivedate=2013-06-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The functions between them are similar. Users do not have to log into the server to check if there is incoming messages. The server will send the notifications automatically to the users to notify them.

==Functions==
The function works base on [[IP camera]]. Once the built-in or external sensor of IP cameras is triggered, it will set up the alarm. The system can automatically send the video through [[WiFi|Wifi]], [[2G]], [[3G]], [[4G]] to the devices of the users once the alarm is triggered. The video clip will be sent no later than five seconds, starting from the previous three seconds of the occurred events and ends at the next forty seconds after the event occurs.

The '''Scottish Crop Research Institute''' more commonly known as the '''SCRI''' was a scientific institute located in [[Invergowrie]] near [[Dundee]], [[Scotland]]. As of April 2011, when SCRI  merged with the [[Macaulay Institute|Macaulay Land Use Institute]] it is now part of The [[James Hutton Institute]].

==History==

The institute was opened in 1951 in Invergowrie under the name '''Scottish Horticultural Research Institute''' (SHRI). In 1981, the SHRI merged with the [[Scottish Plant Breeding Station]] (SPBS), which at the time was located near [[Edinburgh]]. Operations of the SPBS moved to the institute's site at Invergowrie and became the Scottish Crop Research Institute.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scri.ac.uk/aboutus/history |title=SCRI - History |accessdate=12 April 2009 |last= |first= |year=2009 |work= |publisher=Scottish Crop Research Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987 the institute accepted managerial responsibility for Biomathematics &amp; Statistics Scotland, formerly the Scottish Agricultural Statistics Service.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bioss.ac.uk/ Biomathematics &amp; Statistics Scotland Homepage]&lt;/ref&gt; The commercial arm of the SCRI, Mylnefield Research Services, was launched in 1989.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mrsltd.com/ MRS ltd Homepage]&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2011 SCRI  merged with the [[Macaulay Institute|Macaulay Land Use Institute]] to form a new body, The [[James Hutton Institute]]. The [[chief executive]] of the new institute is Professor Iain Gordon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scri.ac.uk/newinstitute |title=New Institute, SCRI Macaulay merger |accessdate=29 October 2010 |last= |first= |year=2009 |work= |publisher=Scottish Crop Research Institute |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722105727/http://www.scri.ac.uk/newinstitute/ |archivedate=22 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

The SCRI has both staff and [[PhD]] students who do research into several different aspects of [[plant science]]. Research facilities include [[laboratories]], office space, [[glasshouses]], growth chambers and 172 [[hectares]] of land which is used for field work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scri.ac.uk/aboutus/facilities |title=SCRI Facilities |accessdate=12 April 2009 |last= |first= |year=2009 |work= |publisher=SCRI}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research at SCRI is organised into four programmes: environment plant interactions, [[plant pathology]], [[genetics]] and plant products and food quality.&lt;ref name="current"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scri.ac.uk/research |title=Research Programmes at SCRI |accessdate=12 April 2009 |last= |first= |year=2009 |work= |publisher=Scottish Crop Research Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institute carries out research funded by the [[Scottish Government]]'s "Programme 1" for profitable and sustainable agriculture and the co-ordinator of Programme 1 is staff member Professor Howard Davies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.programme1.net/ |title=Programme 1 |accessdate=12 April 2009 |last= |first= |work= |publisher=SCRI and The Scottish Government}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institute is also undertaking research into how [[climate change]] in Scotland will affect crop production,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scri.ac.uk/scri/file/cross%20cutting%20themes/Climate_change.pdf |title=Climate Change Research at the SCRI|accessdate=12 April 2009 |last=Newton |first=AC |author2=Gregory, PJ  |year=2007 |work= |publisher=SCRI}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the institute is involved with the Scottish Government's Agriculture and Climate Change Stakeholder Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://openscotland.gov.uk/Publications/2008/05/15115150/11 |title=Annex B - Agriculture and Climate Change Stakeholder Group: Membership |accessdate=12 April 2009 |last= |first= |date=May 2008 |work= |publisher=Agriculture and Climate Change Stakeholder Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10555">'''Short food supply chain''' ('''SFSCs''') is a broad range of food production-distribution-consumption configurations, such as [[farmers' markets]], [[farm shop]]s, collective farmers' shops, [[Community supported agriculture|community-supported agriculture]], solidarity purchase groups. More in general, a food [[supply chain]] can be defined as "short" when it is characterized by short distance or few intermediaries between producers and consumers.

== Origin of the concept ==
SFSCs were originally identified as examples of "resistance" of farmers to modernization of the food system, characterized by the development of supply chains based on long-distance trade.&lt;ref name="Ploeg"&gt;Van Der Ploeg, Jan Douwe, Henk Renting, Gianluca Brunori, Karlheinz Knickel, Joe Mannion, Terry Marsden, and others, “Rural Development: From Practices and Policies Towards Theory,” Sociologia Ruralis, 40 (2000), 391–408 &lt;doi:10.1111/1467-9523.00156&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Resistance consists in the fact that, by selling directly to consumers, farmers bypass intermediaries and thus can develop autonomous marketing strategies based on differentiation. These strategies give farmers the possibility of keeping a bigger share of the value added within the farm and within the local economies. Given these characteristics, short food supply chains are increasingly taken into consideration by rural and food policies as a driver of change in the food system and a policy tool for [[rural development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/events/small-farmers-conference-2012_en.htm |title=Conference "Local agriculture and short food supply chains" (Brussels, 20/04/2012) - Agriculture and rural development |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2012-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The analysis of short food supply chains has fed a broader debate on "alternative food chains",&lt;ref name="Ilbery"&gt;Ilbery, B., and D. Maye. 2005. «Alternative(shorter) food supply chains and specialist livestock products in the Scottish- English borders». Environment and planning A 37 (5): 823–844.&lt;/ref&gt; "alternative food networks",&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, D., and M. Goodman. 2008. «Alternative food networks». International encyclopedia of human geography, pp.(Oxford: Elsevier).&lt;/ref&gt; and "sustainable food chains".&lt;ref&gt;Roep, D., and H. Wiskerke. 2006. Nourishing networks: fourteen lessons about creating sustainable food supply chains. Reed Business Information, Wageningen University.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Specificity ===
SFSCs are considered the most appropriate channels for organic and locally specific products and for small farmers. In fact, a closer relation between producers and consumers gives producers the opportunity to develop a richer communication, and to identify market niches. Ilbery and Maye state, “the crucial characteristic of SFSCs is that foods which reach the final consumer have been transmitted through an SC that is 'embedded' with value-laden information concerning the mode of production, provenance, and distinctive quality assets of the product”.&lt;ref name="Ilbery" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Renting H. 2003 pages 393 - 411"&gt;Renting H., Marsden T. , Banks J. (2003) Understanding alternative food networks: exploring the role of short food supply chains in rural development. Environment and Planning A 2003, volume 35, pages 393 - 411&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Marsden et al. (2000) state that “a common characteristic, however, is the emphasis upon the type of relationship between the producer and the consumer in these supply chains, and the role of this relationship in constructing value and meaning, rather than solely the type of product itself”.&lt;ref&gt;Marsden, T., J. Banks, e G. Bristow. 2000. «Food supply chain approaches: exploring their role in rural development». Sociologia ruralis 40 (4): 424–438.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dimensions of proximity ===
In order to develop a definition of SFSCs, there are a number of candidate criteria that may be used. SFSCs have been conceptualized in terms of Dimensions of Proximity. Kebir and Torre (2012) were perhaps some of the first to propose such a conceptualization, classifying SFSCs based on two dimensions: Geographical Proximity and "Organized" Proximity, the latter of which incorporates social notions of Belonging and Similarity.&lt;ref name="kebir"&gt;Kebir, L. and Torre A. (2012) Geographical proximity and new short food supply chains. In: Lazzeretti, Luciana (ed.) 2012. Creative Industries and Innovation in Europe: Concepts, Measures and Comparative Case Studies. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Other dimensions have been proposed, including [citations needed]: 
* '''Geographical proximity''': physically close, and is measured as a distance between producers and consumers
* '''Social proximity''': expression is direct (with very few intermediaries) and trustful relations between a producer and consumer who know each other and the product, solidarity between producers and consumers, civic engagement in local food system, (re)connection with local food traditions and identities
* '''Economic proximity''': market exchanges happen and money circulates within a community or a certain locality (owned and governed locally, transparent, and traceable)
==Classification==
SFSCs are classified by Renting et al.&lt;ref name="Renting H. 2003 pages 393 - 411" /&gt; into face-to-face, proximate, extended. '''Face to face''' are characterized by physical encounters between producers and consumers (as in the case of farmers' markets). In the '''proximate''' short food supply chains producers are not necessarily managing product distribution (as in the case of consumers' cooperatives). In the '''extended''' short food supply chains, although [[geographical distance]]s between producers and consumers may be long, consumers are aware of the identity of the producers and of the products (such as in the case of [[fair trade]] and protected denominations of origin).

== Regulations ==
An action plan developed in 2009 at the [[Ministry of Agriculture (France)|Ministry of Agriculture, Agrifood, and Forestry]] of France was aimed at supporting the development of short food chains.  According to the [https://web.archive.org/web/20130207121841/http://agriculture.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/100809-lettreCircuitsCourts.pdf plan], short food chains are defined on the base of the number of actors involved; precisely : SFSC are considered as « ''commercialisation of agricultural products through direct selling or indirect selling when only one intermediary is involved'' ». (« ''Un circuit court est un mode de commercialisation des produits agricoles qui s'exerce soit par la vente directe du producteur au consommateur, soit par la vente indirecte à condition qu'il n'y ait qu'un seul intermédiaire''. » .

However, there have been discussions at the senate and at regional levels that short-ness should not be reduced to the number of intermediaries but also geographical distance should be considered (f.i., one can buy vine directly, but what if it travels 1,000&amp;nbsp;km?). Following the national action plan (or maybe prior to it in some cases), regional SFSC plans have been developed. Regional action plans refer to the definition above, but they also complement or precise it.  F.i. Aquitaine region also adds short or reduced geographical distance between producers and consumers  [https://web.archive.org/web/20120404130325/http://agri-agro.aquitaine.fr/uploads/media/Plan_Regional_Circuits_courts.pdf (link)].
The French Law on modernisation of agriculture and fishing, updated in 2010 (n° 2010-874), among its many other intervention actions also states «''the development of short food chains and facilitation of geographical proximity between producers and processors''. »

==Examples==

[[Farmers' market]]s, are physical retail markets featuring foods sold directly by farmers to consumers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2504">The '''South Tyrolean Liberation Committee''' ({{lang-de|Befreiungsausschuss Südtirol}}, abbreviated ''BAS'') was an underground secessionist organisation founded by [[Sepp Kerschbaumer]] and several combatants in the mid-1950s which aimed to achieve the right for [[self-determination]] for [[South Tyrol]] and the related [[secession]] from [[Italy]] via bomb attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fasser | first = Manuel | title = Ein Tirol – zwei Welten.

On 12 June 1961, the BAS organized the bombing of 37 electricity pylons supplying power to the industrial zone of [[Bolzano]], later known as the [[Night of Fire]] (''Feuernacht''). After the subsequent imprisonment of almost all leading members, a second, more violent phase began. This second phase was characterised by an increasing infiltration of Austrian and German [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazis]] and intensified [[secret service]] activities which culminated in several assassinations and ambushes on Italian security forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Steurer| first = Leopold| author-link = | contribution = Propaganda im „Befreiungskampf“ | editor-last = Obermair| editor-first = Hannes| title = Regionale Zivilgesellschaft in Bewegung – Cittadini innanzi tutto | isbn = 978-3-85256-618-4 | pages = 386–400 | publisher = Folio Verlag | place = Vienna–Bozen| year = 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the progression of negotiations concerning South Tyrolean autonomy in the late 1960s, the BAS became less active.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Steininger | first = Rolf | title = Südtirol – Vom Ersten Weltkrieg bis zur Gegenwart | publisher = Studienverlag | location=Innsbruck | year = 2003 | isbn = 3-7065-1348-X | pages=82–86 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Squat Milada''' was one of the Czech Republic's best known squats, located in the [[Libeň]] district of [[Prague]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Milada was intended to be demolished in the 1980s and thus deleted from the Land Registry, becoming a house which officially did not exist. The squat was occupied in 1997, evicted in 2009, then reoccupied for a day in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Occupation==
Left derelict in 1988, Milada was occupied in 1997, along with the neighbouring villa, Miluška.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The villa was used as an infoshop, a bicycle repair workshop, a cafe, a meeting space and a venue for punk gigs and experimental music. In October 1988, the police attempted to evict the building but were repelled, with squatters remaining on the roof for several days.

==Eviction==

A '''State Procession''' is a formal display of the [[monarch|Sovereign]], dignified by a sizeable entourage made up of [[Great Officers of State]], members of the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]] and of the [[Royal Household]]. The [[State Opening of Parliament]] is one of the few occasions when a State Procession is to be seen; the [[List of participants in Queen Elizabeth II coronation procession|Coronation Procession]] is another. The State Procession is now confined to the interior of the [[Palace of Westminster]], but in earlier centuries it followed an outdoor route to and from [[Westminster Abbey]].
[[File:State_Opening_of_Parliament_(18129547086).jpg|right|thumb|320px|The Queen passes the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office in a State coach to the Palace of Westminster for the State Opening of Parliament, 27 May 2015]]

== Historical Background ==
{{double image|right|Parliament Roll 1512 Henry VIII Procession.jpg|200|Earls Procession to Parliament.jpg|218|King Henry VIII, preceded by the Sword of State and Cap of Maintenance, in procession from Westminster Abbey for the State Opening of Parliament, 4 February 1512. ''Parliament Procession Roll, 1512'', detail from 17th century copy, British Library, Add MS 22306}}
An account of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VII]] opening Parliament on 7 November 1485 includes a description of the processions which preceded it. By this time the pattern had become established whereby the [[Peer of the realm|Peers of the Realm]] would assemble at the Palace of Westminster (which was the King's principal residence). They would then go in procession on foot to nearby Westminster Abbey for Mass, prior to returning in procession to the Palace for the Opening of Parliament itself. (During the Mass, the [[Knights and Burgesses]] who had been elected to represent the Commons would gather in the Parliament Chamber for a roll-call, overseen by the [[Lord Steward]] who would leave the Abbey early for this purpose.)&lt;ref&gt;Cobb H.S. 'The Staging of Ceremonies in the House of Lords' in ''The Houses of Parliament: History, Art, Architecture''. London: Merrell 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

In due course, the [[heralds]], who had the responsibility (under the [[Earl Marshal]]'s direction) for marshaling the procession, began to keep detailed records of the event, the earliest of which dates from [[Henry VIII]]'s first Opening of Parliament in 1510. The 1512 account includes an illustration of the Procession depicting participants together with their [[armorial bearings]]. It shows the [[Lords Spiritual]] at the front of the procession, accompanied by Heralds and [[Gentlemen Ushers]]; the [[Serjeant-at-Arms|Serjeants-at-Arms]] follow with their maces, just ahead of [[Garter King of Arms]]. The King is preceded by the [[Cap of Maintenance]], borne by the [[Lord High Constable of England|Lord High Constable]] and the [[Sword of State]], borne by his son. The King himself carries a scepter and walks beneath a richly-decorated canopy supported by four monks. His train is borne by the [[Lord Great Chamberlain]], who is assisted by the [[Lord Chamberlain]] (with his white wand of office). The [[Lords Temporal]] follow, among whom can be seen the Lord Steward (carrying his white wand of office).

Change was necessitated after the Palace of Westminster was severely damaged by fire in 1514. In both 1523 and 1529, the Opening of Parliament took place in [[Bridewell Palace]], following a service in nearby [[Blackfriars, London|Blackfriars]] Church. At around this time, Westminster ceased to be a royal residence, becoming instead the fixed abode of Parliament itself. In 1536, the procession set off from the new royal residence of [[Whitehall Palace|Whitehall]]. Three years later, the King, Peers and attendants were to be seen riding in procession from Whitehall to the Abbey, in their [[Privilege of peerage#Robes|robes]] and on horseback. This precedent was followed in subsequent years; [[Elizabeth I]] rode on occasion or else was carried in a horse-borne [[Litter (vehicle)|litter]] (as had been her sister Queen [[Mary I of England|Mary]], a practice that would also be followed by Queen Anne over a century later). On occasion (and especially in times of plague) the King would travel by river from Whitehall to Westminster, using a State Barge.

For the 1679 State Opening, there was no procession and no service in the Abbey (for fear of a [[Popish Plot]]). The service was not reinstated, so subsequent processions went directly from the [[Palace of Whitehall]] to the Palace of Westminster. At about this time, the practice of all Peers taking part in the procession ceased (due in no small part to the increasing size of the Peerage). In 1698, Whitehall Palace burned down; thereafter [[St James's Palace|St James's]] became the usual point of departure. In the Georgian period, [[carriage]]s began regularly to be used for the procession to Westminster (though this was not entirely new - both Elizabeth I (on occasion) and [[Oliver Cromwell]] had used carriages to get to the State Opening). Under [[George IV]], the Palace of Westminster was remodeled by [[Sir John Soane]] to provide space for the carriages, a robing room, and a grand interior processional route to the House of Lords.

The Old Palace of Westminster was largely destroyed by fire in 1834. The new Palace was purpose built (among other things) to accommodate the ceremonial of a State Opening.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine, D. 'The Palace of Westminster as Palace of Varieties'&lt;/ref&gt; Thus in Victoria's reign, the long-established ceremonial of the State Opening was married to its now-familiar architectural setting of [[Sir Charles Barry|Barry]] and [[Pugin]]'s grand parliamentary interiors. The pattern of events then was much as it is now: the monarch, members of the Royal Family and members of the Household arrive in a Carriage Procession from Buckingham Palace (preceded by the items of royal [[regalia]] with their attendants); after a time of preparation, the monarch proceeds in State from the [[Queen's Robing Room]], through the [[Royal Gallery]] and [[Prince's Chamber]], to the Throne in the [[House of Lords]].

== Present-day Participants in the Procession ==
The Procession falls into four main sections:
* The [[Officers of arms]], the Serjeants-at-Arms and the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod
* The Great Officers of State
* The Queen and her Consort (immediately preceded by the Sword of State and Cap of Maintenance)
* Members of the Royal Household
It should be noted that the latter contingent includes a combination of royal officials and attendants, plus others who are there by virtue of holding honorary positions in the Royal Household (namely several Government Whips and the professional heads of the Armed Services).

As of 2016, the Procession is constituted as follows:

The [[Lord Chamberlain]] of the Household always used to take part (as one of the three great officers of the Household), but since the time of Charles II he has remained instead at the monarch's residence where he holds a Member of Parliament 'hostage' pending the monarch's safe return.

Until 1998 two Gentleman Ushers were in the procession, in addition to the [[Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod]] and the [[Gentleman Usher to the Sword of State]] (who conveys the sword to and from the Palace of Westminster). Gentleman Ushers have been in attendance at State Openings since at least the 15th century.

Until 1998 the Queen was attended by three Ladies in Waiting: a Woman of the Bedchamber, a Lady of the Bedchamber and the [[Mistress of the Robes]]; subsequently only two of the three have attended.

In the first year of her reign the [[Groom of the Robes]] attended, and walked immediately behind the Queen; since then no new appointment has been made; one of the Equerries is instead designated 'Acting Groom of the Robes' for the occasion.

Until 1998 the executive senior officers of the various corps on duty were in the procession (the Lieutenant of the Gentleman at Arms, the Lieutenant of the Yeomen of the Guard, [[Silver Stick]] and the [[Field Officer in Brigade Waiting]]) as well as the [[Crown Equerry]] (the executive head of the [[Royal Mews]]). They do not now take part in the procession, but are still in attendance elsewhere in and around the Palace.

==Other members of the Royal Family==
On some occasions, other senior members of the Royal Family have walked in the procession and occupied positions on the dais either side of the throne (sometimes accompanied by their spouses). The Princess Royal attended on eleven occasions in this capacity (between 1967 and 1985) though in recent years she has attended in her official capacity as [[Gold Stick-in-Waiting]]. The Prince of Wales attended on sixteen occasions between 1967 and 1996 (on four of those occasions he was escorting The Queen in The Duke of Edinburgh's absence).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/LatestNewsandDiary/Pressreleases/2013/StatementregardingtheStateOpeningofParliamentinMay.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621002111/http://www.royal.gov.uk/LatestNewsandDiary/Pressreleases/2013/StatementregardingtheStateOpeningofParliamentinMay.aspx |archivedate=21 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }} Press release&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2013 the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall have been in regular attendance.

Prior to the passing of the [[House of Lords Act 1999]], other members of the Royal Family who were Peers or Peeresses (including Dowagers) often used to attend the State Opening; they, however, were seated on the benches of the chamber with their peers and did not form part of the Procession.

'''''State of Fear''''' is a 2004 [[techno-thriller]] novel by [[Michael Crichton]], in which [[eco-terrorism|eco-terrorists]] plot [[mass murder]] to publicize the danger of [[global warming]]. Despite being a work of fiction, the book contains many graphs and footnotes, two appendices, and a 20-page bibliography in support of Crichton's beliefs about global warming. Many [[Scientific opinion on climate change|Climate scientists]], [[Science journalism|science journalists]], environmental groups, and science advocacy organisations dispute Crichton's views on the science as being error-filled and distorted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.climateprediction.net/wp-content/publications/nature_StateOfFear.pdf|format=PDF| author=Allen, Myles  |title=A novel view of global warming — Book Reviewed: State of Fear |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=433 |page=198 |doi=10.1038/433198a |date=2005-01-20 |issue=7023 |bibcode=2005Natur.433..198A}} PDF version from climateprediction.net site&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Weather Underground|url=http://www.wunderground.com/education/stateoffear.asp|title= Review of Michael Crichton's ''State of Fear ''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Doran, Peter |title=Cold, Hard Facts |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/27/opinion/27doran.html |work=The New York Times |date=July 27, 2006  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hansen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/global_warming/solutions/fight-misinformation/crichton-thriller-state-of.html|website= Union of Concerned Scientists |title=Crichton's Thriller ''State of Fear'': Separating Fact from Fiction}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Borenstein | first = Seth | title = Novel on global warming gets some scientists burned up | work = The Seattle Times | date = 2005-02-10 | url = http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002170342_warming04.html | accessdate = 2008-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The novel had an initial print run of 1.5 million copies and reached the #1 bestseller position at [[Amazon (website)|Amazon]] and #2 on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]] for one week in January 2005. The novel itself has garnered mixed reviews, with some literary reviewers stating that the book's presentation of facts and stance on the [[global warming controversy|global warming debate]] detracted from the book's plot.

== Overview ==
''State of Fear'' is, like many of Crichton's books, a fictional work that uses a mix of speculation and real world data, plus technological innovations as fundamental storyline devices. The [[global warming controversy|debate over global warming]] serves as the backdrop for the book. Crichton supplies a personal afterword and two appendices that link the fictional part of the book with real examples of his thesis.

The main villains in the plot are environmental extremists. Crichton does place blame on "industry" in both the plot line and the appendices. Various assertions appear in the book, for example:

* The science behind global warming is speculative and incomplete, meaning no concrete conclusions can be drawn regarding human involvement in climate change.
* Elites in various fields use either real or artificial crises to maintain the existing [[social order]], misusing the "science" behind global warming.
* As a result of potential [[Conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]], the scientists conducting research on topics related to global warming may subtly change their findings to bring them in line with their funding sources. Since [[climatology]] can not incorporate double-blind studies, as are routine in other sciences, and climate scientists set experiment parameters, perform experiments within the parameters they have set, and analyze the resulting data, a phenomenon known as "[[Systemic bias|bias]]" is offered as the most benign reason for climate science being so inaccurate.
* A key concept, delivered from the eccentric Professor Hoffman, suggests, in Hoffman's words, the existence of a "[[Politico-media complex|politico-legal-media]]" complex, comparable to the "[[Military–industrial complex|military-industrial complex]]," of the [[Cold War]] era. Hoffman insists climate science began using more extreme, fear-inducing terms such as "crisis," "catastrophe," and, "disaster," shortly after the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], in order to maintain a level of fear in citizens, for the purpose of [[social control]], since the specter of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Communism]] was gone. This "state of fear" gives the book its title.

Numerous charts and quotations from real world data, including footnoted charts which strongly suggest mean global temperature is, in this era, lowering. Where local temperatures show a general rise in mean temperature, mostly in major world cities, Crichton's characters infer it is due to urban sprawl and deforestation, not carbon emissions.

Crichton argues for removing politics from science and uses global warming and real-life historical examples in the appendices to make this argument. In a 2003 speech at the [[California Institute of Technology]], he expressed his concern about what he considered the "emerging crisis in the whole enterprise of science—namely the increasingly uneasy relationship between hard science and public policy."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crichton-official.com/speech-alienscauseglobalwarming.html Aliens Cause Global Warming a speech give at the California Institute of Technology January 17, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
Peter Evans is a lawyer for a millionaire philanthropist, George Morton. Evans' main duties are managing the legal affairs surrounding Morton's contributions to an environmentalist organization, the National Environmental Resource Fund (NERF) (modeled after the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] [NRDC]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=  Barcott, Bruce|  title = 'State of Fear': Not So Hot| work =  The New York Times | date = 2005-01-30 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/30/books/review/30BARCOTT.html | accessdate =2010-09-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morton becomes suspicious of NERF's director, Nicholas Drake, after he discovers that Drake has misused some of the funds Morton had donated to the group. Soon after, Morton is visited by two men, John Kenner and Sanjong Thapa, who appear on the surface to be researchers at MIT, but, in fact, are international law enforcement agents on the trail of an [[eco-terrorism|eco-terrorist group]], the Environmental Liberation Front (ELF) (modeled on the [[Earth Liberation Front]]). The ELF is attempting to create "natural" disasters to convince the public of the dangers of global warming.  All these events are timed to happen during a NERF-sponsored climate [[Academic conference|conference]] that will highlight the "catastrophe" of global warming. The eco-terrorists have no qualms about how many people are killed in their manufactured "natural" disasters and ruthlessly assassinate anyone who gets in their way (their preferred methods being ones few would recognize as murder; the venom of a rare Australian [[blue-ringed octopus]] which causes paralysis, and "lightning attractors" which cause their victims to get electrocuted in electrical storms). Kenner and Thapa suspect Drake of involvement with the ELF to further his own ends (garnering more donations to NERF from the environmentally-minded public).

Evans joins Kenner, Thapa, and Morton's assistant, Sarah Jones, on a globe-spanning series of adventures to thwart various ELF-manufactured disasters before these disasters kill thousands of people.  Kenner's niece, Jennifer Haynes, joins the group for the final leg as they travel to a remote island in the [[Solomon Islands]] to stop the ELF's ''pièce de résistance'', a tsunami that will inundate the coastline of [[California]] just as Drake is winding up the international conference on the "catastrophe" of global warming. Along the way they battle man-eating crocodiles and cannibalistic tribesmen (who feast on Ted Bradley, an environmentalist TV actor whom Drake had sent to spy on Kenner and his team). The rest of the group are rescued in the nick of time by Morton, who had previously faked his own death to throw Drake off the trail so that he could keep watch on the ELF's activities on the island while he waited for Kenner and his team to arrive. 

The group has a final confrontation with the elite ELF team on the island during which Haynes is almost killed, and Evans kills one of the terrorists who had previously tried to kill both him and Jones in [[Antarctica]]. The rest of the ELF team is killed by the [[Backwash (physical phenomenon)|backwash]] from their own tsunami, which Kenner and his team have sabotaged just enough to prevent it from becoming a full-size tsunami and reaching California. 

Morton, Evans, and Jones return to [[Los Angeles]].  Evans quits the firm to work for Morton's new (unnamed) organization, which will practice environmental activism as a business, free from potential [[Conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]]. He hopes Evans and Jones will take his place in the new organization after his death.

== Allegorical characters ==

Several critics have suggested that Crichton uses the major characters as proxies for differing viewpoints on the topic of global warming in order to allow the reader to clearly follow the various positions portrayed in the book.

* [[Joseph J. Romm|Joseph Romm]] suggests that Kenner is a stand-in for Crichton himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Romm, Joseph |title=Greenhouse Gas&lt;br/&gt;Michael Crichton's new novel fingers the wrong villains in global warming |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/Infotech/14441/?a=f |agency= |work= |publisher=Technology Review |date=May 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* David Roberts suggests that Evans is the stand-in for the reader (who Crichton presumes accepts most of the tenets of global warming without any detailed study of it, but not unquestioningly) and also that Ted Bradley is a stand-in for people who accept the "[[Environmentalism|environmentalist]]" party line without question.&lt;ref name="grist.org"&gt;http://www.grist.org/advice/books/2005/02/01/roberts-fear/&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ronald Bailey suggests that Drake is a stand-in for the environmental movement "professional" activist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opinionjournal.com/la/?id=110006022 Wall Street Journal Review]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bruce Barcott suggests that Sarah,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Barcott, Bruce |title='State of Fear': Not So Hot |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/30/books/review/30BARCOTT.html?_r=1&amp;oref=login&amp;oref=slogin |work=Sunday Book Review |publisher=New York Times |date=January 30, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and Michael B. McElroy and Daniel P. Schrag suggest that Jennifer&lt;ref name="Harvard Magazine Review"&gt;{{cite news |author=McElroy MB, Schrag DP |title= Overheated Rhetoric&lt;br/&gt;A new novel misrepresents global warming and distorts science |url=http://harvardmagazine.com/2005/03/overheated-rhetoric.html |publisher=Harvard Magazine |date=March–April 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are stand-ins for the [[academy|academic community]] (intelligent enough to follow the debate but undecided until the evidence is presented) with Sarah being the portion of the community likely to believe in global warming on less than undeniable evidence (they will accept "Likely, but not proven" as sufficient proof) and Jennifer representing the part of the community that accepts undeniable evidence only.
* Michael B. McElroy and Daniel P. Schrag also suggest that Jennifer is simultaneously a stand-in for [[Conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]] created by how the research is funded (i.e. her "official" story changes based on who is paying the bills but in private she makes her true feelings known).&lt;ref name="Harvard Magazine Review"/&gt;
* Gregory Mone suggests that Sanjong is a stand-in for the local university library/reputable Internet source verification, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2005-04/science-friction Popular Science's Review]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Author's afterword/appendices ==
Crichton included a statement of his views on global [[climate change]] as an afterword. In the "Author's message", Crichton states that the cause, extent, and threat of climate change are largely unknown. He finishes by endorsing the management of wilderness and the continuation of research into all aspects of the [[Earth]]'s environment.

In Appendix I, Crichton warns both sides of the [[global warming]] debate against the [[politicization of science]]. Here he provides two examples of the disastrous combination of [[pseudoscience]] and politics: the early 20th-century ideas of [[eugenics]] (which he directly cites as one of the theories that allowed for the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]]) and [[Lysenkoism]].

This appendix is followed by a [[bibliography]] of 172 books and journal articles that Crichton presents "...''to assist those readers who would like to review my thinking and arrive at their own conclusions.''" (''State of Fear'', pp, 583).

===Literary reviews===

The novel has received mixed reviews from professional literary reviewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/books/authors/crichtonmichael/stateoffear |publisher = Metacritic.com |title=State of Fear.

''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s [[Ronald Bailey]] gave a favorable review, calling it "a lightning-paced technopolitical thriller" and the "novelization of a speech that Mr. Crichton delivered in September 2003 at San Francisco's Commonwealth Club."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= Ronald Bailey|  title = A Chilling Tale.

In ''[[The New Republic]]'', Sacha Zimmerman gave a mixed review. Zimmerman criticized Crichton's presentation of data as condescending to the reader but concluded that the book was a "globe-trotting thriller that pits man against nature in brutal spectacles while serving up just the right amount of international conspiracy and taking digs at fair-weather environmentalists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= Sacha Zimmerman|  title = Review-A-Day: State of Fear.

Much criticism was given to Crichton's presentation of global warming data and the book's portrayal of the global warming debate as a whole. In the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'', [[John Birmingham]] criticized the book's usage of real world research and said it was "boring after the first lecture, but mostly in the plotting... It's bad writing and it lets the reader ignore the larger point Crichton is trying to make."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= John Birminghamn|  title = Books: State of Fear | publisher =  [[Sydney Morning Herald]] | date = 2005-01-15 | url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/Books/State-of-Fear/2005/01/14/1105582703308.html | accessdate =2008-09-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Peter Guttridge]] wrote that the charts and research in the book got "in the way of the thriller elements" and stated the bibliography was more interesting than the plot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= Peter Guttridge|  title = Well, the bibliography sings | publisher =  The Guardian | date = 2005-01-16 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/jan/16/crime.michaelcrichton | accessdate =2008-09-13 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Bruce Barcott]] criticized the novel's portrayal of the global warming debate heavily, stating that it only presented one side of the argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= Bruce Barcott|  title = 'State of Fear': Not So Hot| publisher =  The New York Times | date = 2005-01-30 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/30/books/review/30BARCOTT.html | accessdate =2008-09-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'', Allan Walton gave a mostly favorable review and offered some praise for Crichton's work. Walton wrote that Crichton's books, "as meticulously researched as they are, have an amusement park feel. It's as if the author channels one of his own creations, "Jurassic Park's" John Hammond, and spares no expense when it comes to adventure, suspense and, ultimately, satisfaction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= Allan Walton|  title = 'State of Fear': 'State of Fear' by Michael Crichton| publisher =  [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] | date = 2004-12-24 | url = http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/04361/431541.stm | accessdate =2009-11-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Myles Allen]], Head of the Climate Dynamics Group, Department of Physics, University of Oxford, wrote in ''Nature'' in 2005: &lt;blockquote&gt;Michael Crichton's latest blockbuster, ''State of Fear'', is also on the theme of global warming and is, ...likely to mislead the unwary....

===AAPG 2006 Journalism Award===

The novel received the [[American Association of Petroleum Geologists]] (AAPG) 2006 Journalism Award. AAPG Communications director Larry Nation told the ''[[New York Times]]'', "It is fiction, but it has the absolute ring of truth". The presentation of this award has been criticized as a promotion of the politics of the [[Petroleum industry|oil industry]] and for blurring the lines between fiction and journalism.&lt;ref name="agu.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DeanNYT"&gt;{{cite news  | last = Dean  | first = Cornelia  | title = Truth?

[[Daniel P.

As for the book, he added "I think it is unfortunate when somebody who has the audience that Crichton has shows such profound ignorance".&lt;ref name="DeanNYT" /&gt;

'''Sir Thomas Wentworth Russell''' (1879&amp;ndash;1954), better known as '''Russell Pasha''', was a police officer in the Egyptian service. He was the fourth child and third son of the Rev. Henry Charles Russell, the grandson of the sixth duke of Bedford, and his wife, Leila Louisa Millicent Willoughby, the daughter of the eighth Baron Middleton.&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;P. J. V. Rolo, 'Russell, Sir Thomas Wentworth (1879–1954)', rev. ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2007 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/35886, accessed 3 Oct 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

As the director of the Central Narcotics Intelligence Bureau (CNIB), Russell Pasha became an anti-drug campaigner when he realized that opium, heroin, cocaine and hashish were being smuggled into Egypt in great and increasing quantities.&lt;ref name="Straits Times"&gt;HE CRUSADED AGAINST DRUGS, ''The Straits Times'', 23 May 1954, Page 24&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Studies==
He was educated at Cheam School, Haileybury College, and Trinity College, Cambridge between the years 1899 and 1902. In 1902, he was awarded a [[B.A.]]. His choice of career was settled when he was invited to visit Cairo by a distant cousin, then adviser to the Egyptian minister of the interior. He went back home to graduate, entering the Egyptian service in October 1902.&lt;ref name="oxford" /&gt; An apprenticeship of ten years gave him a good understanding of the Egyptian society as well as the conditions and customs that drove the lives of the Egyptian [[fellah]]in.&lt;ref name="oxspectator"&gt;SYMES, STEWART. "Russell Pasha » 12 May 1949 » The Spectator Archive." ''The Spectator Archive''. N.p., n.d. Web. 03 Oct. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early days==
After an apprenticeship with the Alexandria coastguards, he was appointed provincial sub-inspector in the Ministry of Interior, in January 1902. He served later as inspector, in every Egyptian province, acquiring great knowledge of local officials, while directing police activities of all kind. In 1911 he was appointed assistant commandant of police in [[Alexandria]]. He was transferred to [[Cairo]] as assistant commandant in 1913.&lt;ref name="oxford" /&gt;

In 1911 he married Evelyn Dorothea Temple (d.1968), with whom he had one son, [[Sir John Wriothesley Russell]] (who was to become British ambassador to Spain in 1969) and one daughter, Camilla Georgiana, who married the writer [[Christopher Sykes (author)|Christopher Sykes]].&lt;ref name="oxford" /&gt;

==Becoming commandant==
In 1917 he was appointed commandant of the Cairo city police with rank of major-general and title of [[Pasha]].&lt;ref name="oxford" /&gt;
After 1922 he served under twenty-nine different Egyptian ministers of interior.&lt;ref name="oxford" /&gt; However, his talents were gradually focused on fighting the spread of drugs and drug addiction in Egypt. In 1929 the Egyptian Central Narcotics Intelligence Bureau (CNIB) was formed, with him as the director.&lt;ref name="oxford" /&gt; He remained in this position until 1946. There he gained an even more profound understanding of Egyptian society that routine police work could ever have provided.&lt;ref name="muslim world"&gt;MALONE, /JOSEPH J. » "The Muslim World" » 57 no 4 Oct 1967, p 338&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the formation of the Egyptian Central Narcotics Intelligence Bureau, Russell Pasha writes in his memoirs:&lt;ref name="Egyptian service"&gt;Russell, Thomas W., ''Egyptian Service, 1902–1946''. London: Murray, 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|At the beginning of 1929 Muhammad Mahmud Pasha, then Prime Minister, had become as alarmed as myself at the devastating effect that heroin addiction was having, not only in the cities, but also in every village in the country. The peaceful, happy villages of my inspector days were being rotted with dope and nothing serious was being done to prevent it. Had the damage been confined to the upper and educated classes of the cities I don't think that I should have been so stirred, but when I had collected what reliable figures I could obtain and calculated that out of a total population of fourteen million possibly half a million were now slaves to the drug habit, and they the backbone of the land, I realized that here was a job worth doing and one that, with the Prime Minister's support I felt capable of tackling&lt;ref&gt;Russell, ''Egyptian Service, 1902–1946'', p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

While his main focus was on drug related crimes, in his 44 years of police work he also dealt with a large collection of other crimes. They included: many common murders (happening an average of eight times a day in Egypt, mostly committed by [[fellah]]in in compensation of their business or personal feuds), as well as the clarification of some big political assassinations in [[Cairo]].&lt;ref name="trove"&gt;"Russell Pasha—Enemy Of World's Dope Ring." ''The Sunday Herald'' 24 Jul 1949: 9 Supplement: Sunday Herald Features. Web. 6 Oct 2015 &lt;http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article28668178&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==War on drugs==

In his memoirs, Russell Pasha describes hashish and opium as "black drugs", and cocaine, morphine and heroin as "white drugs". It's the latter, chemical ones that he determined as a "major danger to the country"&lt;ref name="Egyptian service" /&gt;  and expresses his decision to "for a time ignore the black drug traffic, if doing so would get us on to the white".&lt;ref name="Egyptian service" /&gt; 
 
Russell Pasha’s view on the drug and ideas of how to deal with the drug problem were undoubtedly inspired by Britain’s hashish policy in India. The cultivation of cannabis in India was monopolized and its cultivation and sale were taxed and licensed. The possibility of implementing this same policy in India was constantly considered by British officials in Egypt. Three prominent British diplomats in Egypt, in the years preceding the CNIB, had called for policies similar to the one in India to be implemented in Egypt. They were: Alfred Caillard Pasha, the British general director of customs in Egypt; and [[Evelyn Baring, 1st Earl of Cromer|Evelyn Barring (Lord Cromer)]] and [[Herbert Kitchener|Lord Herbert Kitchener]], both British Consul Generals. They saw that, like in India, hashish was so widely consumed that it would be difficult to completely eradicate its consumption and instead it should be regulated. A law based on that of India’s to regulate, register, and license the manufacturing, selling, and import of hashish was drafted, but never put into effect.&lt;ref name="Kozma, Liat" /&gt;

=== Formation of the Central Narcotics Intelligence Bureau (CNIB)===

Russell Pasha states in his memoirs that his request to form the CNIB was approved after he provided evidence to the Prime Minister that almost half a million Egyptians, out of a population of fourteen million, were drug addicts.&lt;ref name="Egyptian service" /&gt;

 {{Quote|The terms of reference were wide. I was to be the Director, with the right of selecting my own specialized police staff, with direct access to all Egyptian Government Departments and foreign public security authorities, and to have at my disposal a budget of £E10.000 a year for which I need account to no one.&lt;ref name="ES226"&gt;Russell, ''Egyptian Service, 1902–1946'', p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

He also declares a feeling of fortune about the "exceptionally efficient team of officers and constables from the Egyptian Police"&lt;ref name="Egyptian service" /&gt; that he was able to select. The objects of the Bureau, described in his memoirs, were the following:

{{Quote|
# To trace to their source, in Europe or elsewhere, the imported drugs that were now ruining Egypt,
# To present the facts to the League of Nations, 
# To pursue and prosecute drug traffickers in Egypt,
# To put, by every possible means, such difficulties in the way of the traffic that retail prices in Egypt would rise to a height beyond the reach of the fellahin.&lt;ref name="ES226"/&gt;|}}

===Hashish===
During the brief French occupation of Egypt in 1798–1801, Napoleon banned hashish preparation and consumption because of the spread of its use among the French military, with little success, however. [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Mahammed Ali Pasha]]’s Egyptian government (starting in 1803) was focused on modernizing the state, especially in the area of health. This idea of modernizing medicine could have influenced the hostile attitudes towards hashish as it was an unregulated consumption of drugs.&lt;ref name="Mills, James H., Colonial Africa"&gt;Mills, James H. "Colonial Africa and the International Politics of Cannabis: Egypt, South Africa and the Origins of Global Control." Drugs and Empires: Essays in Modern Imperialism and Intoxication, C.1500–c.1930. Ed. James H. Mills and Patricia Barton. Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Hashish was banned in Egypt between 1868 and 1884. Muhammad Ali Bey, an important medical doctor (who was going to be later  the head of the medical school and the editor of Egypt's first medical journal, ''Ya'sub al-Tibb''), published a detailed report in 1868 that led to the ban on cultivation, use and importation of hashish. In 1874 hashish was imported under the payment of duty, but in November 1877 an imperial order from Istanbul stipulated that all hashish brought into Egypt was to be destroyed. On March 1879 the Egyptian government banned the cultivation, distribution and importation of the drug in Egypt.&lt;ref name="Kozma, Liat"&gt;Kozma, Liat (2001) 'Cannabis Prohibition in Egypt, 1880–1939: From Local Ban to League of Nations Diplomacy', ''Middle Eastern Studies'', 47:3 443–460.&lt;/ref&gt;

This prohibition of hashish in Egypt can be seen as a response to an image that started to become popular among European travelers and local Egyptian westernized intellectuals: of the Egyptian lower classes as demented, lethargic, irrational and unproductive hashish smokers and of Egyptian streets carrying the sweet and debilitating smell of hashish smoke. Banning hashish was a step in the direction to becoming a civilized society and a way to discipline the lower classes into rationality.&lt;ref name="Kozma, Liat" /&gt; Historically, Egyptians had recourse to the drug as an alternative to wine. Wine, even though prohibited in Islam, was known as the substance for the rich as it was more expensive, while the less expensive hashish was known as a substance for the poor.&lt;ref name="Kozma, Liat" /&gt;

The trafficking of hashish into Egypt in the later part of the nineteenth century and early twentieth century came mostly from Greece.&lt;ref name="Kozma, Liat" /&gt; In response to British pressure, Greece increased their prohibition efforts and Syrian and Lebanese suppliers took over the trafficking of hashish, moving it to Egypt through Palestine.&lt;ref name="Ram, Haggai"&gt;Ram, Haggai. "Traveling Substances and Their Human Carriers: Hashish-Trafficking in Mandatory Palestine." ''A Global Middle East: Mobility, Materiality and Culture in the Modern Age, 1880–1940''. Ed. Liat Kozma, Cyrus Schayegh, and Avner Wishnitzer. p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;

====Russell Pasha's view on Hashish====

Russell Pasha considered hashish consumption as a relatively innocuous habit, in comparison to the "plague" of heroin and cocaine consumption, which became popular after the First World War. Baron Harry D'Erlanger, Russell's associate, similarly declared that hashish was no more than a 'pet failing of many members of the poorer classes'.&lt;ref name="Kozma, Liat" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Harry D'Erlanger"&gt;B.H. D'Erlanger, ''The Last Plague of Egypt'' (London: L. Dickson &amp; Thompson, 1936), p.12; quoted in Kozma, Liat (2001) 'Cannabis Prohibition in Egypt, 1880–1939: From Local Ban to League of Nations Diplomacy', ''Middle Eastern Studies'', 47:3 443–460&lt;/ref&gt; According to D'Erlanger, Russell considered legalizing the drug, turning it into a revenue-producing good, thus preserving national funds, which would be spent on home-grown products rather than importing from abroad.&lt;ref name="Kozma, Liat"/&gt; This consideration echoes those of Caillard, Cromer, and Kitchener, based on the Indian policy. Nahas writes that British officials, and particularly Russell, did not care enough about the drug because they saw hashish intoxication as "one expression of oriental languid and dreamy temperament".&lt;ref name="Kozma, Liat" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nahas"&gt;Nahas, 'Hashish in Egypt'; quoted in Kozma, Liat (2001) 'Cannabis Prohibition in Egypt, 1880–1939: From Local Ban to League of Nations Diplomacy', ''Middle Eastern Studies'', 47:3 443–460&lt;/ref&gt; Even though several British officials supported the legalization of the drug, they continued to enforce the ban and guarded Egyptian borders, ports and shores to get a hold on the small percentage of the hashish that eventually found its way to Egyptian consumers.&lt;ref name="Kozma, Liat" /&gt;

===Heroin, "the drug that nearly killed Egypt"&lt;ref name="Egyptian service" /&gt;===

Russell Pasha writes in his memoirs:

{{Quote|It was in 1916 that cocaine began to make its first appearance in Cairo, to be followed later by the pleasanter and more potent heroin, but there was little that we could do at that time when trafficking or possession was a mere contravention with a maximum penalty of £EI fine or a week's imprisonment.&lt;ref name="ES223"&gt;Russell, ''Egyptian Service, 1902–1946'', p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

Writing about those early days he states:

{{Quote|Prices in those days were comparatively low, a shot only cost a few shillings and the trade, wise in its generation, kept the price down until the vice had spread and caught large numbers of the population in its grip. We even had instances of contractors paying their labourers in heroin.&lt;ref name="ES223"/&gt;|}}

But then, the situation started to become alarming:

{{Quote|About 1928 I began to realize that something was happening which was producing a new slum population in Cairo, the like of which we had not seen before. For the first time we heard of the method of intravenous injection of heroin and soon came across its victims. Within a short time we found a new element in our Bulaq [Cairo] slums. In the past the population of this teeming quarter of Cairo had been largely composed of the rough Upper Egypt labourer type who had got left behind in Cairo after his annual migration from his southern village (where there was no work during the Nile flood) to Alexandria and the Delta for seasonal work. They were a rough class but healthy and strong.
Now we began to find human wreckage lying about in the Bulaq lanes, pale-faced semi-corpses evidently not of the Bulaq type who when spoken to replied in educated Arabic or even English and admitted that it was the heroin habit that had got them there. The heroin on the market was still fairy pure and therefore strong, and the Bulaq settling-pit quickly filled with the human debris of every class of Egyptian society.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, ''Egyptian Service, 1902–1946'', p. 223–224.&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

====Curing addicts====

As described by Russell Pasha in his memoirs, one of the traits of the drug addiction in Egypt was the pitiful desire of many addicts to be cured:

{{Quote|I had hopes in the early days of our campaign of persuading the Government to establish treatment centres outside Cairo on the lines of the Lexington Farm in America, but I was not successful and one can understand hesitation to attempt the reformation of, literally, thousands of sufferers from a disease which could only be cured by the ministrations of a specialist in each individual case. All one could do was to consider addiction and possession as a penal offence and condemn the victims to terms of imprisonment sufficiently long to break them completely of the habit before they returned again to their old life and temptation. We were often criticized by the medical authorities in England and Geneva for this apparently brutal treatment of what is really a mental and not a criminal condition, but I feel that, under the circumstances, this treatment was inevitable and even justified by the results it produced.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, ''Egyptian Service, 1902–1946'', p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

===Progress made by the year 1931===

The international trafficking of hashish (Indian hemp) was made illegal to countries that had criminalized it at the League of Nations' 1925 Opium Convention, after a suggestion made by Egypt. The League of Nations made this 'humanitarian effort' thinking that with international collaboration they could help heal the world's physical and social ills.&lt;ref name="Kozma, Liat, source 2"&gt;Kozma, Liat. "The League of Nations and the Debate over Cannabis Prohibition." History Compass 9.1 (2011): 61–70.&lt;/ref&gt; Russell Pasha’s reports on drugs and hashish to the Home Office in London were passed around the League of Nations Advisory Committee in 1929. Realizing the importance of examining the facts in those reports, Russell Pasha appeared at the Committee in Geneva as the Egyptian representative.&lt;ref name="Mills, James H."&gt;Mills, James H. "Cannabis Nation: Control and Consumption in Britain, 1928–2008", OUP Oxford, Nov 29, 2012, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1931, in a Communication to the League of Nations Special Committee Meeting in Geneva, where Russell Pasha was representing "the Kingdom of Egypt",&lt;ref name="British Journal"&gt;PASHA, T. W. R. (1931), "Drug addiction in Egypt", British Journal of Inebriety. Substance of a Communication to the League of Nations Special Committee Meeting in Geneva, January, 1931, the author representing the Kingdom of Egypt.&lt;/ref&gt; he writes:

{{Quote|In my last year's report I painted, in colours strong but true, the ghastly state of thousands of the inhabitants of Egypt as a result of the introduction into the country of the vice of the taking of narcotics. A year has passed since then. True, a very small time in history or in the life of a country, but a twelve-month of vital value when we are dealing with the narcotic poisoning of a nation. I am in the happy position of being able to report progress. It is easy to be carried away by optimism and to see things as one wants to see them, but still, under the coldest douche of strict reality, I am convinced that drug addiction among the fellahin of Egypt has fallen by 50 per cent. If my last year's figure of half a million addicts out of fourteen million inhabitants was true, it is still a sufficiently terrible fact that 250.000 people should be the slaves and victims of drug addiction.&lt;ref name="British Journal" /&gt;|}}

According to his observations, the majority of the big traffickers in Egypt at that time were the "Greeks, Turks and Palestinian Jews".&lt;ref name="British Journal" /&gt; He states:
{{Quote| Luckily for us, many of these Greeks are local subjects as regards criminal jurisdiction, as also are the Turks and Palestinians, and as much are amenable to the Egyptian criminal courts.&lt;ref name="British Journal" /&gt;|}}

It was lucky for Russell Pasha because if these traffickers were not local subjects, they would have been subject to capitulations, meaning that they were tried in consular courts and were exempt from Egyptian law.&lt;ref name="Kozma, Liat" /&gt;
Regarding the imprisonment of the traffickers, he writes in his memoirs that even if the Egyptian prison code states that a prisoner sentenced for a crime can be released under good conduct after three-quarters of time served, the grace is always denied to these.&lt;ref name="Egyptian service" /&gt;

==Personality==

In an obituary written following Russell Pasha’s death in 1954, it is said of him:

{{Quote|For everybody connected with the control of narcotics, Russell Pasha was not only a legendary figure but a man well known from the days of the Advisory Committee of the League of Nations where, ever since his first appearance in January 1930, he impressed all those who had the honour and the pleasure of working with him with his great intelligence, his profound knowledge of everything connected with narcotics and his keen sense of humour which showed a deep understanding of human nature.&lt;ref name="UNODC"&gt;"Sir Thomas Wentworth Russell", UNODC - Bulletin on Narcotics, 1954 Issue 3 - 007, Page 76&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

==Books written by Russell Pasha==

==Retirement and later years of life==

Russell Pasha retired in 1946 and dedicated the rest of his life to salmon fishing.&lt;ref name="Singapour free press"&gt;"Russell Pasha will chase salmon—not drug gangs", ''The Singapore Free Press'', 24 April 1953, Page 6&lt;/ref&gt; He died in London on April 10, 1954.&lt;ref name="UNODC" /&gt;

[[File:Sennaia-1900.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Saviour Church on Sennaya Square]] in Leningrad was one of many notable church buildings destroyed during [[Khrushchev Thaw|The Thaw]]]]
'''[[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s anti-religious campaign''' was the last large-scale anti-religious campaign undertaken in the [[Soviet Union]]. It succeeded a comparatively tolerant period towards [[religion]] which had lasted from 1941 until the late 1950s. As a result, the [[Christian Church|church]] had grown in stature and membership, provoking concerns from the Soviet government. These concerns resulted in a new campaign  of persecution. The aim of anti-religious campaigns was to achieve the [[atheist]] society that [[communism]] envisioned.

Khrushchev had long held radical views regarding the abolition of religion, and this campaign resulted largely from his own leadership rather than from pressure in other parts of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU]]. In 1932 he had been the First Moscow City Party Secretary and had demolished over 200 [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] churches including many that were significant heritage monuments to [[Russia]]'s history. He was initiator of the July 1954 [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU Central Committee]] resolution hostile to religion. He was not able to implement his ideas in practice until he achieved greater consolidation of his control in the late 1950s.&lt;ref name="autogenerated122"&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pg 122&lt;/ref&gt;

The anti-religious campaign of the Khrushchev era began in 1959, coinciding with the [[21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|twenty first Party Congress]] in the same year. It was carried out by mass closures of churches&lt;ref name="demokratizatsiya1"&gt;Daniel, Wallace L. "Father Aleksandr men and the struggle to recover Russia's heritage." Demokratizatsiya 17.1 (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="regels1"&gt;Letters from Moscow, Gleb Yakunin and Lev Regelson, http://www.regels.org/humanright.htm&lt;/ref&gt; (reducing the number from 22,000 in 1959&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V.

ME Sharpe inc., 2002 pp187&lt;/ref&gt;), monasteries, and convents, as well as of the still-existing seminaries (pastoral courses would be banned in general). The campaign also included a restriction of parental rights for teaching religion to their children, a ban on the presence of children at church services (beginning in 1961 with the Baptists and then extended to the Orthodox in 1963), and a ban on administration of the [[Eucharist]] to children over the age of four. Khrushchev additionally banned all services held outside of church walls, renewed enforcement of the 1929 legislation banning [[pilgrimage]]s, and recorded the personal identities of all adults requesting church [[baptism]]s, [[wedding]]s or [[funeral]]s.&lt;ref name="autogenerated377"&gt;Olga Tchepournaya.

(4690 words)&lt;/ref&gt; He also disallowed the ringing of [[church bell]]s and services in daytime in some rural settings from May to the end of October under the pretext of field work requirements.&lt;ref name="autogenerated84"/&gt; Non-fulfillment of these regulations by [[clergy]] would lead to disallowance of state registration for them (which meant they could no longer do any pastoral work or [[liturgy]] at all, without special state permission). The state carried out forced retirement, arrests and prison sentences to clergymen who criticized atheism&lt;ref name="autogenerated84"&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 1: A History of Marxist-Leninist Atheism and Soviet Anti-Religious Policies, St Martin's Press, New York (1987) pg 84&lt;/ref&gt; or the anti-religious campaign, who conducted Christian charity or who made religion popular by personal example.&lt;ref name="autogenerated84"/&gt;

==Education==

Khrushchev claimed that communist education intends to free consciousness from religious prejudices and superstitions.&lt;ref&gt;Tatiana A. Chumachenko. Edited and Translated by Edwad E. Roslof. Church and State in Soviet Russia: Russian Orthodoxy from World War II to the Khrushchev years. ME Sharpe inc., 2002 pp188&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first manifestations of the campaign, like as occurred in the 1920s, was the removal of practicing believers from the teaching profession. In 1959, reports appeared 'unmasking' secret believers in faculties of education. In one case a Christian student was asked how she would teach in an atheistic school system, and she replied "I'll give all answers in accordance with [[Marxism]]. What are my personal convictions is no one's business."&lt;ref name="autogenerated102"&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pg 102&lt;/ref&gt; The same article also took concern that atheist students felt that they could not win in a discussion with believers.&lt;ref name="autogenerated102"/&gt;

The press called for more aggressively atheistic curriculum at pedagogical institutions.

In 1959 a mandatory course was introduced called 'The Foundations of Scientific Atheism' in all higher learning institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 1: A History of Marxist-Leninist Atheism and Soviet Anti-Religious Policies, St Martin's Press, New York (1987) pg 76&lt;/ref&gt; [[Evolution]] and the [[origin of life|origins of life]] began to be taught intensively in the school system beginning in 1959-1960, and all [[natural sciences]] were subordinated to the purpose of giving students a scientific-materialistic (i.e. atheistic) attitude towards nature.

Believers could be denied graduation at institutions of higher learning on account of their religion.&lt;ref name="demokratizatsiya1"/&gt;

The school system was criticized in a 1960 open letter to the Russian Minister of Education for failing to perform its duty to eliminate religious belief among its students. The letter claimed that believing parents were fanatics and that active believers as well as clergy were swindlers.&lt;ref name="autogenerated79"&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 1: A History of Marxist-Leninist Atheism and Soviet Anti-Religious Policies, St Martin's Press, New York (1987) pg 79&lt;/ref&gt; The minister responded by outlining what the education system had been doing and reaffirming that he regarded religious belief as a very serious social epidemic.

The atheist position was not simply concerned with trying to teach a worldview without religion, but a worldview that was hostile to religion: 

{{quote|Should theologians explain the Universe even from the scientific [materialistic] point of view but in the name of religion and even God Himself... we shall not stop our fight against religion [because] religion will never cease to be a reactionary social force, an opiate for the people...|Evgraf Duluman, Kiriushko and Yarotsky, Nauchnoteknicheskaia revolutsiia...&lt;ref name="autogenerated98"&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pg 98&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Anti-religious propaganda==

The 21st Congress brought in a new, radical program of anti-religious propaganda that would stay in place for the next twenty-five years.&lt;ref&gt;Tatiana A. Chumachenko. Edited and Translated by Edwad E. Roslof. Church and State in Soviet Russia: Russian Orthodoxy from World War II to the Khrushchev years. ME Sharpe inc., 2002 pp x&lt;/ref&gt;

A new anti-religious periodical appeared in 1959 called Science and Religion (Nauka i Religiia), which followed in the tradition of Bezbozhnik in aggressiveness and vulgarness, but was much less vicious.&lt;ref name="autogenerated98"/&gt;

Due to the memory among many citizens of the patriotic role that the Church had played in war with [[Germany]], the loyalty it had shown during the war and the supportiveness of the institution in post-war peace campaigns, and the failure of the regime to rewrite history in order to remove these memories,&lt;ref name="regels1"/&gt; the antireligious propaganda therefore avoided attacking the Church leadership or its institutional political reliability.

The church leadership also cooperated with the state's propaganda campaign by denying any persecution by the state at international peace and theological conferences,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1986"&gt;Edward Derwinski. Religious persecution in the Soviet Union. (transcript). Department of State Bulletin 86 (1986): 77+.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to foreign press.&lt;ref name="autogenerated99"&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pg 99&lt;/ref&gt; The upper orthodox church hierarchy during these years largely remained unscathed by the persecution directed at the rest of the church, which the hierarchy refused to speak out about and which even made statements to justify.&lt;ref&gt;Christel Lane. Christian religion in the Soviet Union: A sociological study. University of New York Press, 1978, pp34&lt;/ref&gt;

The propaganda, unlike in the 1930s, made no promises about liquidating the church in the near future or that the word 'God' would disappear from Russian vocabulary. There was also less artistic talent in printed antireligious cartoons and posters as there had been in the pre-war years. 'Science and Religion' even found itself having to rely on foreign atheist artists to draw their anti-religious cartoons, such as the French communist cartoonist Maurice Henry.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pg 100&lt;/ref&gt;

The propaganda, like in the 1930s, lost its originality after its enhancement in 1958 as anti-religious periodicals adopted lifeless routines in their propaganda. Every newspaper was supposed to have a plan governing their anti-religious content, but few adhered to this systematically. A number had regular columns dedicated to religion and atheism which had names such as 'The Atheist Corner' or 'The Militant Atheist'. Very often they simply reprinted articles that had been originally printed by [[Pravda]], [[Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union|TASS]] and other newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;David E. Powell, ''Antireligious Propaganda in the Soviet Union: A Study of Mass Persuasion'' (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1975) p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

As in the pre-war period, lies and incitements against religion were considered permissible only if they pragmatically served the purpose of eliminating rather than hardening religious convictions.

Very often official policies to criticize religion without insulting believers' feelings were ignored in practice, and this widespread violation caused some to even doubt the authenticity of the policy.&lt;ref&gt;David E. Powell, ''Antireligious Propaganda in the Soviet Union: A Study of Mass Persuasion'' (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1975) p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; These attacks became even more unrestrained as a result of influence from the CPSU Central Committee.

Examples of article names that appeared in this time period are: 'The Howls of the Obscurantists', 'The Vultures', 'The Wolfish Fangs of "God's Harmless Creatures"', 'Swindlers in the guise of Holy Fathers', 'A Theologian-Fomenter, and 'Hysteria on the March'. Believers were called 'toadstools', 'swindlers', 'a horde', 'anti-Soviet subhumans' (liudishki), 'wicked enemy of all that lives', and 'the rot'. Secret monks were called 'milksops', theologians of the [[True Orthodox Church]] were called 'malignant', and Levitin-Krasnov who spoke out against the persecution was called 'Smerdiakov' (the despicable bastard in [[The Brothers Karamazov]]) and a hypocrite par excellence.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pg 101&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most commonly repeated antireligious arguments of this period was that the [[cosmonaut]]s had not seen [[God]] when they went into space.&lt;ref name="autogenerated122"/&gt; Khrushchev claimed that [[Yuri Gagarin]] said that he did not see God when he went into orbit&lt;ref name="secularization35"&gt;Paul Froese. Forced Secularization in Soviet Russia: Why an Atheistic Monopoly Failed. Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, Vol. 43, No. 1 (Mar., 2004), pp. 35-50&lt;/ref&gt; (although later evidence suggests that Gagarin himself was religious&lt;ref name="ir8361"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.interfax-religion.com/?act=news&amp;div=8361 |title=Gagarin's family celebrated Easter and Christmas, Korolev used to pray and confess |work=Interfax-religion.com |accessdate=11 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and soviet leaders saw the space programme as a tool with which to attack religion.&lt;ref name="secularization35"/&gt;

The press always accused believers of immorality, and blamed this supposed immorality on their religious beliefs. Practicing believers were libelled as lechers, demoralized weaklings, drunks, vicious criminals and parasites who did no socially useful work, just as in the pre-war period. Similarly also to the pre-war period, accusations and hate propaganda in the press often preceded arrests of clergy.

The testimony of ex-priests who denounced their former fellow clergymen for lechery, luxury, pilfering and materialistic greed, were used when available. These 'confessions' often ended with appeals to still practicing clergy to stop fooling credulous believers and to stop enriching themselves by exploiting their ignorance'.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pg 103&lt;/ref&gt;

Some, such as former professor of [[theology]], [[Alexander Osipov]], warned that this image was oversimplified and that religion did in fact attract intellectuals sometimes. He claimed that the church was not a senile institution ready to fall, but had great flexibility and adaptability. He also notably criticized the atheistic propaganda for being bureaucratic routine and that atheist propagandists were often ignorant of religion (e.g. confusing [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] with [[Old Believers]], general ignorance of [[Christian]] doctrines&lt;ref name="secularization35"/&gt;). Osipov also said that 'Science and Religion' should focus on educational material since the journal was largely unread by lay believers, but that such attacks should rather occur in the general mass media.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pg 104&lt;/ref&gt;

This claim may have been incorrect, however. Believers did subscribe to 'Science and Religion' in order to make clippings of all the quotations from Scriptures, diverse theological writings or lives of the saints, that were reprinted in the journal and criticized, as this was one of the few sources available that believers could find such material within.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pg 104-105&lt;/ref&gt;

Tolerant attitudes of children to believing parents or grandparents were criticized.

Pilgrims and pilgrimages were maligned in the press for [[charlatanism]], clerical swindles to extract donations, and distraction of people from socially useful work. One of the most vicious examples of these was written by a woman named Trubnikova entitled 'Hysteria on the March' that described a pilgrimage to a spring in the village of {{Interlanguage link multi|Velikoroetskoe|ru|3=Великорецкое}} in the diocese of [[Kirov, Kirov Oblast|Kirov]], where there was supposedly an apparition of [[St. Nicholas]] centuries earlier. Trubnikova claimed that she disguised herself as a pilgrim and went with them. She claimed that they were alcoholics, hysterics, hypocrites and swindlers who faked trances and miracles (there were people who dipped themselves into the spring and then shed their crutches, which she assumed was a deceitful act). The story ended with robberies, sexual orgies and a drunken murder. Trubnikova claimed that she was rescued by a voluntary police aide in the middle of the night who claimed that these anti-Soviet sub-human Christians would have no hesitation in murdering her.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pg 106&lt;/ref&gt; She ended the article by appealing for a ban on all such pilgrimages, which were taking place right before the eyes of the Soviet public.

The rites of all religious faiths were claimed to be linked with spreading diseases. Jewish and Muslim [[circumcision]] was claimed to cause [[gangrene]], leading to fatalities. The Orthodox tradition of mass kissing of icons, crucifixes and relics was treated with long discourses on how this spread infectious diseases. Communion using a shared [[chalice]] was also given such treatment. The same was true with regard to the sacrament of baptism. Full immersion baptism was alleged to lead to colds, [[influenza]]s and [[pneumonia]]s, especially in infants and especially in the winter months, which sometimes led to fatalities. The overcrowding of churches was also alleged to result in spreading infectious diseases (never, however, did the propaganda also admit in the same context that the mass Soviet closure of churches or other institutions had resulted in the overcrowding).&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pg 107&lt;/ref&gt;

The anti-religious propaganda was largely unconcerned with objectivity and truth, but rather to build up a negative image of believers as fanatics, disseminators of disease, social pests or criminals, in order to justify the persecution to the public.

The Marxist doctrine that religion would inevitably disappear was increasingly questioned and re-interpreted. A new interpretation held that religion was forced down upon people somehow through coercive tactics of believers. For example, in a supposedly true story printed in the press on the [[True Orthodox Christian Wanderers]] (an outlawed Old Believer sect) a monastic priest with a bony predatory nose, who was hiding from the law, wandered through the woods and came upon a group of sectarians who agree to hide him while assuring him that he could have a life without working. They then produce [[samizdat]] literature that breathes hatred against everything human and to the Soviet Union especially. A college student from the city of [[Novokuznetsk]] then met this priest and had a conversation with him, in which the student expressed some thoughts that maybe there was something beyond this world. The priest then seized the opportunity and talked him into coming to a [[skete]] in [[Siberia]]. On the way, in the middle of the night, the priest grabbed the frightened student and forcibly baptized him. Then he ordered him to destroy his papers and passport, but not his money, which the priest took for himself. The article then concluded that all religious believers, who were reportedly properly characterized in this fashion, are malicious enemies of all living things.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pg 107-108&lt;/ref&gt;

This story in the press was followed with mass arrests of believers who were supposedly running a kidnapping network as well as these supposed secret Siberian sketes and underground theological schools. Their victims were 'rescued' and brought back into the secular world, and their conversion was explained as a result of their own foolishness that was taken advantage of by the manipulative clergy.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pg 108&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviet press on occasion criticized the campaign for senseless destruction of the built heritage of the country, such as the dynamiting of the [[Ufa Cathedral]] in 1956.&lt;ref name="autogenerated126"&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pg 126&lt;/ref&gt; However, rarely did the brutality of the persecutions themselves find criticism in this time period. To the contrary, in the publication 'Soviet Ethnography' produced by the Soviet Academy of Sciences, for example, it wrote in one article: 'The Party has never reconciled itself and never will, with ideological reaction of any kind… The struggle against religion must not only be continued, but it ought to be enhanced by all possible means'.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pg 124=7&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'rightist' view that religion would disappear on its own and no efforts were needed re-appeared in these years, and was criticized in the official press.

There were some admissions of the growth of interest in youth in religion during these years in the official press.

Two special 'universities of atheism' began in [[Leningrad]] and several more in its province. One of these universities was run by Znanie and other by the [[Leningrad Museum of History of Religion and Atheism]]. These universities trained lecturers, propagadanists and other agitators for 'individual work'.&lt;ref name="autogenerated79"/&gt;

Clubs of atheism were formed for average people at local 'Palaces of Culture', followed by special atheist film clubs.&lt;ref name="autogenerated80"&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 1: A History of Marxist-Leninist Atheism and Soviet Anti-Religious Policies, St Martin's Press, New York (1987) pg 80&lt;/ref&gt;

Many conferences were held in this period on anti-religious propaganda and the issue of how to best combat religion.&lt;ref name="autogenerated81"&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 1: A History of Marxist-Leninist Atheism and Soviet Anti-Religious Policies, St Martin's Press, New York (1987) pg 81&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foreign reaction==

Many unofficial and semi-official reports were available in the West about what was occurring with regard to brutalities and terror, but these were largely ignored for lack of being authoritative. When reports of anti-religious persecution reached the West, the state referred to them as 'malicious slander'.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1986"/&gt;

Among the reasons for why the campaign drew little attention were i) the regime did not attack the clerical leadership specially, as had occurred in the 1920s or 1930s ii) the clerical leadership repeatedly denied the presence of persecution or suppression of religion to international conferences as well as to foreign media iii) the campaign was not as vicious as had occurred under [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] or [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]], and iv) masses of people had not been mobilized for this campaign as they had been in the 1930s.  Khrushchev's campaign, while being the most brutal episode of persecution after Stalin's death in Soviet history, largely went unnoticed in the Western world, partly as a result of poor coverage in the Western media, which often instead attempted to portray Khrushchev as a more liberal figure, and partly also as a result of a lack of resemblance between this campaign and the campaigns under Lenin or Stalin.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. ''A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory and Practice, and the Believer'', vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pg 99&lt;/ref&gt;

Khrushchev and his regime fostered a false image of himself as being [[Religious tolerance|tolerant]] towards religion to foreigners. In an interview with American journalists in 1957 he stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt; if clergymen were to combine their religious activities with political agitation against the Soviet state this would be in violation of the constitution. And the Soviet state will not tolerate such interference.
We still have people who believe in God. Let them believe. To believe or not to believe in God is the personal affair of each individual, a matter for his conscience. All this does not, however, prevent the Soviet people from living in peace and friendship. And it often happens that there are believers and atheists in one family. But those who believe in God are becoming fewer. The vast majority of young people growing up today do not believe in God. Education, scientific knowledge, and the study of the laws of nature leave no room for belief in God.&lt;ref&gt;John Anderson, Religion, State and Politics in the Soviet Union and Successor States, Cambridge University Press, 1994, pp 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Foreigners who travelled to the USSR had their visits tightly controlled so that they did not see anything that would have led to bad press for the regime.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1986"/&gt;

==Official policies and the CPSU Central Committee==

Much of the 'Old Guard' of the anti-religious work pre-[[World War II]] had died or they were no longer in condition to help with the new campaign.

The Central Committee issued anti-religious measures with carefully worded euphemisms. In 1958 Khrushchev published his Theses on Educational Reform that called for the development of a materialistic (i.e. atheism) world-view in youth.

The Soviet Council of Ministers issued an instruction on 16 October 1958 that cancelled the tax exemptions on monasteries and which also instructed local governments to cut the sizes of land plots being owned by monasteries and to work towards closing open monasteries. The tax rates on Monasteries were raised to 4000 roubles per hectare (400 roubles after the 1961 devaluation). Another instruction issued on 6 November of that year introduced a very high tax on monasteries.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 1: A History of Marxist-Leninist Atheism and Soviet Anti-Religious Policies, St Martin's Press, New York (1987) pg 82&lt;/ref&gt; Monasteries had for years served an important spiritual function in the Orthodox church as centres of pilgrimage, confessions, spiritual consoluations and for strengthening lay people in their faith; thus, shutting them down was meant to weaken the spiritual life of the church. Monasteries also had an ambiguous status under Soviet law, which made these measures easier to pass.

There were rumours, never refuted, that the 21st congress of the CPSU in 1959 had adopted a secret resolution for the annihilation of all religious institutions in the country during the implementation of the seven-year plan.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 1: A History of Marxist-Leninist Atheism and Soviet Anti-Religious Policies, St Martin's Press, New York (1987) pg 74&lt;/ref&gt; That conference declared that the communist society was inseparable from an atheistic upbringing of its members.&lt;ref name="autogenerated16"&gt;John Anderson, Religion, State and Politics in the Soviet Union and Successor States, Cambridge University Press, 1994, pp 16&lt;/ref&gt; The new persecution that emerged was partly justified on the success that religion had achieved in the post-war era.

The January 9th 1960 Central Committee Plenum Resolution 'On the Tasks of Party Propaganda in Modern Times' called for an escalation of anti-religious persecution and criticized party organizations that were being too lax. It did not include any measures calling for moderation or avoiding insults to believers, but it reiterated the pre-war view that religion was hostile to communism. It called for the introduction, beginning in 1961-62 of special courses of basic political education in senior high school grades (which included atheistic instruction). This set off a large volume of anti-religious articles in Soviet periodicals, which for several years had been producing very few anti-religious pieces.

The CC plenum resolution brought back 'individual work' among believers, which was a concept used in the 1930s. This was a practice of atheist tutors (appointed by different public institutions including the CP, Komsomol, Znanie and trade unions) visiting known religious believers at their homes to try to convince them to become atheists. In most cases the tutors were workmates of the believers. If the believer was not convinced, the tutor would bring it to the attention of their union or professional collectives, and the backwardness and obstinacy of the specific believers were presented in public meetings before the believer's colleagues. If this did not work, administrative harassment would follow at work or school, and the believers would often be subject to lower-paid jobs, blocking of promotion, or expulsion from college if the believer was in college. Teachers commonly physically punished believing schoolchildren.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 1: A History of Marxist-Leninist Atheism and Soviet Anti-Religious Policies, St Martin's Press, New York (1987) pg 78&lt;/ref&gt;

Special schools had been set up in Leningrad in 1958 for the purpose of training tutors for 'individual work', which implies that the resurrection of this practice had been planned for years.

In 1961 a decree was passed that reconfirmed the ban on group pilgrimages. This was followed by campaigns of character assassination in the media against pilgrims and monasteries. This measure forbade believers from visiting monuments or graves of persons they considered to be saints. Boris Talantov reported such a ban coming even earlier in Kirov diocese in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pg 134-5&lt;/ref&gt; Reforms were introduced in 1961 to exert tight control over church operations.

The [[22nd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|22nd CPSU congress]] in 1961 re-affirmed the need to eliminate religion in order to build true communism&lt;ref name="autogenerated16"/&gt; and the need for true anti-religious education. The congress proclaimed that the current generation would come to live under true communism, which was interpreted to mean that religion needed to be vanquished within that timeframe.&lt;ref name="regels1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated81"/&gt; The 1962 14th Komsomol congress called for a more concrete attack on religion and that it was the duty of every Komsomol member to resolutely struggle against religion.&lt;ref name="autogenerated80"/&gt; This congress also declared that freedom of consicence did not apply to children and that parents should not cripple children spiritually.&lt;ref name="autogenerated84"/&gt; On a similar note, the top Soviet legal journal declared that parental rights over children was a right given by the society and which could be withdrawn by the state if this right was abused.

The CPSU Central Committee issued two resolutions on July 6, 1962, directed at the leadership in [[Belarus]] and [[Samara Oblast|Kuibyshev Oblast]] that called for an end to the dissemination of religious ideas, especially among the young, and it criticized the party leadership for failing in the anti-religious struggle. It allowed for direct persecution of believers. This was re-printed in the press and followed by the whole country (as was the usual paradigm when a resolution was directed at a specific region).&lt;ref name="autogenerated81"/&gt;

In June 1963, Leonid Il'ichev made a speech at the ideological plenum of the Central Committee. In it he called people who persisted in religious beliefs as amoral, and that religion was one of the extreme forms of [[bourgeois]] ideology. He advised a merciless war against religion, claimed that if they did nothing the Church would grow and that they needed a militantly aggressive assault on religion. He criticized Stalin for not holding true to Lenin's legacy in his tolerant policies towards religion after 1941&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 1: A History of Marxist-Leninist Atheism and Soviet Anti-Religious Policies, St Martin's Press, New York (1987) pg 81-82&lt;/ref&gt; (Khrushchev also criticized Stalin's attempt to turn the site of the former [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]] in Moscow into a great Soviet monument, which Khrushchev decided instead would be a swimming pool&lt;ref&gt;Haskins, Ekaterina V. "Russia's postcommunist past: the Cathedral of Christ the Savior and the reimagining of national identity." History and Memory: Studies in Representation of the Past 21.1 (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;). Il'ichev, claimed that believers were 'political rascal and opportunists…[who] cheat, dissemble, hiding their hostility towards our political system under a mask of religion'.&lt;ref name="autogenerated99"/&gt;

==Orthodox Church==

The two state organizations for overseeing religion in the country (one for the Orthodox, the other for everyone else), changed their functions between 1957-1964. Originally Stalin had created them in 1943 as liaison bodies between religious communities and the state; however, in the Khrushchev years their function was re-interpreted as dictatorial supervisors over the religious activities in the country. This control was not officially legislated, but it was created by secret instructions.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 1: A History of Marxist-Leninist Atheism and Soviet Anti-Religious Policies, St Martin's Press, New York (1987) pg 91&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to this campaign, the famous [[St. Basil's Cathedral]] in [[Moscow]] had been turned into a museum.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1961"&gt;Kolarz, Walter. Religion in the Soviet Union. St Martin's Press, New York (1961) pp80&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, only 38 Orthodox churches were open in Moscow.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1961"/&gt;

[[Patriarch Alexy I of Moscow|Patriarch Alexii]] made a speech in the [[Kremlin]] at a Soviet peace conference in 1960 in which he openly admitted persecutions, praised the role of the Church in Russia's history especially in times of crisis, and warned the Soviet government that the gates of [[hell]] shall not prevail against the Church. This was the high point of the church hierarchy's resistance to the campaign, and it resulted in the forced retirement of the speech writer ([[Nicholas (Yarushevich)|Bishop Nikolai]]) and his mysterious death a few months later, as well as the Patriarchate's later submission to the new pressures.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pg 128&lt;/ref&gt;  The hierarchy in Russia was often criticized in Samizdat documents by people suffering persecution for its cooperation with the authorities.

The Orthodox hierarchy found itself in alliance with the state on different issues including the establishment of world peace, the abolition of race and class differences, condemning US aggression in Vietnam, and the abolition of the exploitation of the colonial system. At international conferences such as relations with other Orthodox communities outside of Russia, at the [[World Council of Churches]], and the Prague Peace conference, the Orthodox hierarchy emphasized the religious tolerance and humanitarianism of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="autogenerated35"&gt;Christel Lane. Christian religion in the Soviet Union: A sociological study. University of New York Press, 1978, pp35&lt;/ref&gt; After Khrushchev the hierarchy would also lend its support to the state on the invasion of Czechoslovakia and denunciation of the right-wing military government in Greece.&lt;ref name="autogenerated35"/&gt;

In 1961 the government explicitly forbade clergy from applying any kind of disciplinary measures to those under their care.&lt;ref name="demokratizatsiya1"/&gt; The Orthodox church was forced to let go of many of its regulations in conflict with the Leninist legality. Parish priests became legally the employees of the 'twenty persons' (after the church was deprived of its status of legal person, different parishes were considered to be owned by groups of at least twenty [[layperson]]s who applied) who were registered as the owners of the parish, and the priest was deprived of any administrative controls over the parish.&lt;ref name="autogenerated377"/&gt; These 'twenties' also found themselves being increasingly penetrated by soviet agents who thereby hijacked control of different parishes. There was a campaign in the early 1960s to acquire more defections of priests and theologians to atheism, but the defections produced little result among the communities and the campaign was abandoned.

Very few Orthodox clergy ever became atheists in the whole history of the state.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 1: A History of Marxist-Leninist Atheism and Soviet Anti-Religious Policies, St Martin's Press, New York (1987) pg 63&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of official harassment as well as practical difficulties, many believers had religious funeral rites performed 'by correspondence' wherein believers would mail some earth from deceased person's grave to a priest, and the priest would then bless the earth and return it to the believers in some fashion. In 1963 these types of funerals fell roughly between a range of 45-90% in different parts of the country in their portion of the total funeral rites.&lt;ref&gt;Christel Lane. Christian religion in the Soviet Union: A sociological study. University of New York Press, 1978 pp41&lt;/ref&gt;

CROCA ([[Council for Russian Orthodox Church Affairs]]) relentlessly and arbitrarily appointed and removed priests through abuse of its registration and de-registration function. This led to the removal of the most popular and spiritually most influential priests from parishes, and it usually involved refusing to register any priests that were selected by popular choice of the congregation. Bishops were cowed and cooperated with CROCA, by instructing the priests under them to fulfill all of the government's instructions. Priests thereby ceased or reduced making topical or uplifting sermons as well as sermons that criticized atheism and the state ideology, but instead found themselves often simply making abstract sermons on Christian ethics. Under state pressure priests even found themselves coerced into making sermons against the presence of beggars on church steps (since the 1929 legislation had made Christian charitable efforts to be illegal).&lt;ref name="autogenerated130"&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pg 130&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1960, CROCA began to forbid churches to provide temporary housing to people who came long distances to services. In compliance, church councils expelled such people. Some churches that secretly continued to do this were often visited by militia who would expel such people forcibly (even including elderly people on cold days in the winter). This measure effectively made it impossible for people from afar to attend services any longer, which further reduced church attendance (and thereby contributed to the propaganda that people were losing interest in religion). It also helped reduce income that parishes received. The lack of funds and attendance could be further used as excuses to close more parishes.&lt;ref name="autogenerated130"/&gt;

In Kirov diocese after the end of 1959, priests began to receive oral orders from plenipotentiaries that forbade them to administer confessions, communion, baptisms, extreme unctions and other private religious services at private homes, even to the terminally ill, without explicit permission to do so for each case from the local soviet. It is known that a similar unpublished measure two years later was given to Moscow priests who were forced to sign it.&lt;ref name="autogenerated130"/&gt; This measure when implemented could be used by the antireligious propaganda who could then claim that priests were lazy selfish people who would let a sick person die without coming to him; the fact that these instructions were unpublished meant that no priest was able to prove them to be true in the face of such criticism.&lt;ref name="autogenerated131"&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pg 131&lt;/ref&gt; The authorities in Moscow denied that such a measure existed, which could further be used to allege that the priests were liars trying to slander the Soviet government.

==Activities==

At the third Znanie congress, it was reported that there were 15 inter-republican and republican as well as 150 provincial, conferences and seminars for promoting atheism in the year 1959, with the total participation of 14,000 propagandists. At one conference organized at the [[Soviet Academy of Sciences]], up to 800 scholars and atheist propagandists participated. The congress also criticized the lack of education among many atheist propagandists, and cited an example of a cartoon in Nauka i religii ('Science and Religion') of [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]] praying before a religious icon as well as another example of an article in the same paper that referred to the Talmud as a Hebrew prayer book that believers held in their hands during Synagogue services. It also called for publication of a basic textbook on scientific atheism, which soon appeared and by 1964 had a circulation of 50,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 1: A History of Marxist-Leninist Atheism and Soviet Anti-Religious Policies, St Martin's Press, New York (1987) pg 77-78&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1960, a high level Znanie conference on atheism, encouraged attacks on the church and returning to [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]]'s legacy that had been discarded in World War II.

[[Pentecostalism|Pentecostals]] were accused of causing serious mental and physical stress in their members by their practice of severe [[fasting]] and states of [[Religious ecstasy|ecstasy]] as well as [[trance]]s during their services. Their clergy were tried and sentenced to hard labour periodically. For example, Pentecostal presbyter, Kondrakov, in the Donets Basin mining area was accused of causing reactive psychosis in his parishioners and was sentenced to eight years of imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pg 144&lt;/ref&gt;

It was made illegal in 1960 for children and youth to attend services in the Baptist church. Similar measures to other denominations followed later. This may have been a result of the Baptists success in attracting much Soviet youth to their religion.&lt;ref name="autogenerated131"/&gt; The Baptists cooperated with the state and the central leadership of their community called on its membership to try to reduce the baptism of young people between the ages of 18-30, and forbade children from attending services. This type of interference, by the state in this instance, was technically illegal under Soviet law.&lt;ref name="autogenerated689"&gt;John Anderson.  The Council for Religious Affairs and the Shaping of Soviet Religious Policy. Soviet Studies, Vol. 43, No. 4 (1991), pp. 689-710&lt;/ref&gt; This cooperation between the baptist leadership and the state led to a massive split in the Baptist community, when in 1962 the Initiative Baptists (Initsiativkniki) illegally formed as a community. The state engaged in massive persecutions against this new group and tried to treat the official Baptist church with many rights and privileges in contrast.&lt;ref name="autogenerated132"&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pg 132&lt;/ref&gt;

The experience with the Baptist community prompted the state to be more cautious when it attempted similar measures against the Orthodox Church by banning priests from conducting services in the presence of children or youths. This instruction was never published but was usually given orally by local plenipotentiaries and involved threats of deregistration if it was not carried out.

In Kirov diocese these measures came into place in the summer of 1963, and the first attempts to implement the measure failed when mothers bringing their children to church physically assaulted the policemen and Komsomol who had gathered in order to stop them, who were overpowered. After this occurred CROCA plenipotentiaries phoned priests by telephone and ordered them not to give the sacraments to children or youths, and the priests largely complied.&lt;ref name="autogenerated132"/&gt;

These measures were not applied uniformly, and numerous priests in the country continued to administer the Eucharist to children and even conduct special Te Deums for schoolchildren on the eve of the first school day in September. The authorities had much difficulty implementing these measures, due to resistance from the Patriarch who otherwise cooperated with them on most other subjects, as well as the resistance of parents. The state attempted other means to implement this.&lt;ref name="autogenerated142"&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pg 142&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic|Georgia]], where there had been 2455 churches before 1917, only a hundred remained by 1962 (with 11 in Tbilisi).&lt;ref&gt;Kolarz, Walter. Religion in the Soviet Union. St Martin's Press, New York (1961) pp105&lt;/ref&gt;

Many priests were imprisoned as a result of attracting youths to their services. In [[Orenburg]] diocese, for example, 46 priests were imprisoned in 1960. Clergy were harassed for working with youths down to the fall of the regime. Seminary candidates who left employment in order to go to seminary were arrested, and priests who helped them were deprived of registration.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pg 133&lt;/ref&gt;

Parents of children who openly demonstrated their faith at school or of children who did not join the Pioneers or wear their [[kerchief]]s for religious reasons were prosecuted by the courts. These court cases resulted in the deprival of parental rights and their children were sent to boarding schools. Parents who tried to raise their children in their faith could be also prosecuted and have their children removed from them.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pg 142-143&lt;/ref&gt;

Seminaries began to be closed down in 1960. This was often done under the official pretext that they were not being used, while at the same time the Soviet authorities took measures to prevent students from coming (e.g. at the Volhynia seminary, the state ordered the institution to provide a list of names of their candidates, and afterwards it then registered the students for mandatory military service or refused their residence permits in [[Lutsk]], which allowed them to shut down the institution in 1964 under the pretext that it was not being used).&lt;ref name="autogenerated84"/&gt; The Soviet media reported that this was a natural decline of those willing to enroll and it was a sign of the decline of religious beliefs. Five of the eight seminaries in the country were shut down during this period, and in the surviving seminaries (Moscow, Leningrad and Odessa&lt;ref&gt;Nathaniel Davis, A Long Walk to Church: A Contemporary History of Russian Orthodoxy, Westview Press, 2003, 182&lt;/ref&gt;) student numbers were reduced. At the surviving Leningrad seminary, for example, the population of the seminary was reduced to 70 (from 396 in 1953).&lt;ref name="autogenerated135"&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pg 135&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of seminary candidates, therefore also meant a lack of priests being produced which therefore meant that more parishes could be shut down for lack of use.

Despite being deprived of their funds, the monasteries were able to hold on to their existence, until they were closed in later years directly following a massive anti-monastic campaign in the press, which depicted the funds-deprived monasteries as parasitic institutions with fields and gardens tilled by exploited peasants while the consecrated religious enjoyed themselves. The monasteries were accused of black-market dealings, sexual relations of the monks with nuns and female pilgrims, and drunkenness. The administrators of the communities were also accused of collaboration with the [[Nazi]]s. The actual shutting down of the monasteries was presented in the press as being voluntarily done by the consecrated religious who were happy to join the working world. The Old Believer sect of True Orthodox Wanderers was also attacked for supposed harbouring of criminals and deserters from the war.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 1: A History of Marxist-Leninist Atheism and Soviet Anti-Religious Policies, St Martin's Press, New York (1987) pg 90&lt;/ref&gt; Monasteries had traditionally been the greatest centres of pilgrimage in Orthodoxy, which may have prompted the government's great interest in eliminating them. Their number was reduced from 69 in 1959 to 17 by 1965 (there were over 1000 before 1917).&lt;ref name="autogenerated136"&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pg 136&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1961, the [[Soviet Council of Ministers]] forbade parishes to engage in any form of [[charity (practice)|charity]] or offering financial aid to other parishes or monasteries. Further methods were used to limit funds for churches, including banning sales of candles according to 1929 legislation that forbade obligatory payments to religious organizations. This allowed for even more churches to be closed. The depopulation of rural areas in Siberia, the Urals and Northern Russia as the people moved to the cities was used as a pretext to close their churches (new churches were not simultaneously opened in the cities though).&lt;ref name="autogenerated89"&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 1: A History of Marxist-Leninist Atheism and Soviet Anti-Religious Policies, St Martin's Press, New York (1987) pg 89&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Soviet government reconfirmed its ban on group pilgrimages in 1961, it then began a campaign to destroy grave-sites and monuments of people who were considered to be saints. Some of these sites included nationally revered sites that attracted thousands of pilgrims since as early as the 14th and 15th centuries.

In 1962, 'Administrative Commissions Attached to the Executive Committees of the City Soviets of Workers Deputies' were set up as disciplinarian supervisors over religious bodies. They were made up of state employees and members of local ''Soviets'', and they kept religious societies under observation. They studied ways to weaken and limit the activities of religious groups, and to expose any attempts by clergy to violate soviet law. At the same time, local ''Soviet'' executives were charged with making sure that the 'groups of twenty' that held legal rights over churches were filled with reliable people who would not care for the spiritual life of the parish. Since the priests had been made the employees of these groups, this legislation allowed for the state to take control of parishes.&lt;ref name="autogenerated377"/&gt; This situation often bred discontent in parishes, and led to confrontation between the executive group of twenty and the priest.&lt;ref name="autogenerated89"/&gt;

According to reports from Boris Talantov in Kirov diocese, the campaign was primarily directed at liquidating churches and religious associations, and that it was being fulfilled by CROCA (later CRA) and its local plenipotentiaries with support from local governments. He said that usually the provincial CROCA plenipotentiary would de-register the priest serving a church earmarked for liquidation or move the priest to another parish. Then for six to eleven months he would permit no new priest to occupy the vacant post while ignoring the petitions by parishioners. This happened to 21 out of the 80 priests in Kirov diocese between 1960-1963. While the church continued to be vacant, the local government would then attempt to intimidate the believers to quit the religious association ('the twenty') that registered the church, after which the it was declared that the religious association no longer existed. Then the Provincial Executivee Committee would declare the church closed and hand over the building to the local collective farm or town soviet for other uses, often without informing the religious association, which would then be officially de-registered. He claimed that many reports and delegations were sent to CROCA in Moscow that gave evidence that the religious association still existed or that the collective farm in question did not require the church building for any purposes. Never would the text of de-registration decisions be shown to believers (which Soviet law in fact required), and the liquidations themselves often took place with the protection of militia and in the middle of the night. Believers would not be permitted to enter the churches and the contents were confiscated without any inventory.&lt;ref name="autogenerated124"&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pg 124&lt;/ref&gt;

In his description icons were broken up and burned, service books and scriptures were destroyed, and the Communion wine was consumed by the militia. The church building would sometimes be wrecked or burned (in the case of wooden structures), including the famous 18th-century church of Zosima and Savvatii in the village of Korshik. That church had been protected by the state, which had promised it would be protected as cultural heritage, but in 1963 it was destroyed and transformed into a collective farm club. Talantov reported that it would have cost less simply to build a new club.&lt;ref name="autogenerated124"/&gt;

Talantov recorded a story about a popular priest TG Perestoronin, who was arbitrarily deprived of his registration in 1961 which was followed by the arbitrary closure of his church soon after. He moved to Kirov to work as a reader in the local church, while leaving his family in the closed church back home. The local village boss decided to evict his family in the middle of winter in 1962, with legal court backing. The local schoolmistress hired the priest's wife as a charwoman to save her prosecution for parasitism, but the local boss then fired the schoolmistress from her post. Perestoronin, having heard this, was forced to leave his post in Kirov and take up a job as a plumber, which the authorities rewarded by ending the harassment against his family and they were allowed to go back to their old house.&lt;ref name="autogenerated134"&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pg 134&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, a beautiful 18th century Transfiguration Chapel near Kirov built on a site with a pool of water that traditionally was held to have miraculous powers, was closed. A year later it was demolished. Pilgrims continued to go to the site afterwards, but the authorities reacted by filling the pool and blocking the spring.&lt;ref name="autogenerated136"/&gt; The local bishop gave his support to the Soviet authorities to accomplish this, and on May 20, 1964 he forbade pilgrimages in his diocese. In 1966 believers in Kirov even requested from the Moscow Patriarchate to remove him, but they were given a negative answer with the reason that the Soviet government insisted he remain in place and the Patriarch had to cooperate.&lt;ref name="autogenerated136"/&gt;

Talantov reported that the number of functioning Orthodox churches in Kirov diocese were reduced from 75 in 1959 to 35 by 1964 through these methods (before 1917 there were over 500 churches in the diocese). Many protests and pleas to the authorities followed these events, but were ignored, and the believers who made them were subject to intimidation, shouts, insults, beatings, and other methods that resulted in some physical injuries, several deaths and nervous breakdowns.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pg 124-125&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign that Talantov reported for Kirov diocese is one of the best recorded local campaigns, and other campaigns around the country may have followed similar patterns. The antireligious press presented these liquidations as being done at the request of the local population. For example, in a church in Yastrebino, the official press reported:

{{quote|Conversations went around the village: Will the church remain, or won't it?... The church had no business to be standing next door to the school. Moreover, in summer there was usually a pioneer camp in the school. Finally, before the war… there was a café there, with a snack bar in the chapel. The church at Yastrebino was opened by the Germans during the occupation. So, 'it's an echo of the war', ran the argument in the village… But the weightiest argument which had an effect even on believers, was this: the children…

They all argued about religion, but finally arrived at the same conclusion- a club… You could argue about a church, but not about a club…

… By now in surrounding villages they were already gathering signatures beneath an application to the village soviet requesting the closure of the church.&lt;ref name="autogenerated125"&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pg 125&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Moscow Patriarchate]] continued to cooperate with the state by declaring that almost all such churches were closed as a result of a decline in religious belief and were mostly just amalgamations with other churches. Talantov described some such 'amalgamations' in Kirov diocese of churches that were 40 kilometres apart. Some parts of the Soviet establishment admitted to the massive closures being done against believers' wills and criticized the arbitrariness of the closures for promoting dissatisfaction and bitterness among believers as well as giving ammunition to foreign critics of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="autogenerated125"/&gt;

In the entire region of [[Sakha Republic|Sakha]]-[[Yakutia]] (about half the size of the continental United States) there was only one functioning church left open after Khrushchev until the fall of communism, which meant that many believers needed to travel up to 2000 kilometres in order to get the nearest church.&lt;ref&gt;Nathaniel Davis, A Long Walk to Church: A Contemporary History of Russian Orthodoxy, Westview Press, 2003, xi&lt;/ref&gt;

A Soviet law that had invalidated all legislation passed under the Nazi occupation was used in order to justify the closures of churches that had been re-opened during the war; this constituted most of the re-opened churches, while churches in other parts of the country were closed with other legal justification (such as the law that forced employers to make sure that their employees had a residence in their area, which was used to make missionary priests illegal). Sometimes churches were closed as a result of the priest shortage produced by the closure of seminaries, wherein a priest would not be found for a church for six months and the authorities would then permanently close the church on grounds of its lack of use. Sometimes they were closed by refusing to give permits for the church to make repairs, and then closing the buildings on grounds of safety once they deteriorated.&lt;ref name="autogenerated689"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 1: A History of Marxist-Leninist Atheism and Soviet Anti-Religious Policies, St Martin's Press, New York (1987) pg 86&lt;/ref&gt;

None of these churches opened during the war were actually opened by the Germans, however. In [[Odessa]] diocese 210 religious congregations of various denominations were shut down by this method. The total number of Orthodox churches in Belarus was similarly reduced by the same method from 1200 to less than 400. The Dnepropetrovsk diocese was reduced from 180 to 40 in the same way and the diocese of the Crimea was reduced to 15 churches.&lt;ref name="autogenerated126"/&gt;

This law could not be applied to areas that had been captured by the USSR during the war period, wherein the churches had been open before the war began (e.g. The Baltic republics, or eastern Poland). However, these areas were also treated with mass closure of churches. Only 75 [[Roman Catholic]] churches remained open in Latvia in 1964 from an original 500 and 180 parishes were liquidated in Volhynia.&lt;ref name="autogenerated126"/&gt;

Many churches could be legally closed simply for being in proximity to a school and thereby endangering children with exposure to religious propaganda.&lt;ref name="autogenerated689"/&gt; This in effect meant that masses of churches could be closed, since many schools were in existence before the revolution and had been run by the Orthodox Church which commonly built them side by side with the local church building. This particular pretext may have continued to be used after Khrushchev left office.&lt;ref name="autogenerated126"/&gt;

In the north Russian autonomous republic of [[Komi Republic|Komi]] where there had been 150 churches before 1917, there were only 3 remaining by 1964, but they were accompanied by 20 underground parishes as well as a few 'catacomb' communities of the True Orthodox.&lt;ref name="autogenerated124"/&gt;

The number of functioning orthodox churches was reduced from over 20,000 prior to 1960 to 6850 by 1972, and a similar decrease in the same period of Orthodox priests from 30,000 to 6180. The Soviet media claimed that this was a natural decline in religion, but contradictorily reported at other times that only 200 priests had resigned in the same period.&lt;ref name="autogenerated135"/&gt;

The growing number of interfaith marriages in the traditionally Muslim regions of Central Asia may have reflected a breaking-down of traditional Islamic customs and culture.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"&gt;Froese, Paul. "'I am an atheist and a Muslim': Islam, communism, and ideological competition." Journal of Church and State 47.3 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 3567 mosques were closed under Khrushchev in Uzbekistan alone.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt;

==Notable atrocities and victims==

Boris Talantov, a mathematics teacher in Kirov diocese in the north-eastern part of [[European Russia]] was one of the first voices to sound the alarm of the mass closures of churches. He sent reports to Soviet newspapers and the central government in Moscow, all of which ignored them, and then he resorted to secret illegal literature sent to the West, for which he was caught and imprisoned.  Talantov lost his job as a teacher, and he died in 1971 in prison.&lt;ref name="autogenerated124"/&gt;

A layperson named Levitin-Krasnov spoke out against the persecution during its height in [[samizdat]] tracts. He lost his job as a high-school teacher in 1959. He had been imprisoned from 1949–1956 and he was imprisoned again from 1969-1972. He had taken monastic vows in secret, but lived 'in the world'.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Wynot. Monasteries without walls: secret monasticism in the Soviet Union, 1928-39. Church History 71.1 (March 2002): p63(17). (7266 words)&lt;/ref&gt; He was painted as a hypocrite by the press for teaching Russian literature at school while publishing theological articles under a pseudonym that the press claimed were 'full of spite and arrogance'.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pg 101-102&lt;/ref&gt; He was made out to be a scion of a wealthy Russian aristocratic family and was bitter over the loss of its estate. In actuality, Levitin-Krasnov was a Christian Marxist; he was also an opponent of some Russian nationalists who wanted to turn the USSR into a Christian theocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Suslov, Mikhail D. The fundamentalist utopia of Gennady Shimanov from the 1960S-1980s.(Report). Demokratizatsiya 17.4 (Fall 2009): p324(26). (13568 words)&lt;/ref&gt; He was expelled in 1974 and he went to Switzerland.

Archbishop Iov of Kazan was arrested in 1960 after libellous articles written against him in the press. He had lived under the German occupation and was accused of anti-Soviet activities. He was accused of [[lechery]] and misappropriating church funds. It was alleged he was hated by his parishioners for a luxurious lifestyle. The press calculated his salary, but failed to mention the upwards of 81% tax rate on clerical salaries. His case was very similar to Archbishop Andrei of Chernigov. He resisted the closure of churches and he was sentenced to three years' hard labour for tax evasion.&lt;ref name="autogenerated134"/&gt; After Iov was released he became archbishop of Ufa (by this fact the charges were likely false, because if he had really been evading taxes neither the church nor the state would have allowed this).&lt;ref name="autogenerated134"/&gt;

Archbishop Andrei of Cernigov had been arrested under Stalin after he completed his theological studies. He had lived under the German occupation and was accused of anti-Soviet activities, with his arrest under Stalin used as evidence to support this allegation. He was accused of lechery and misappropriating church funds. It was alleged he was hated by his parishioners for a luxurious lifestyle. The press calculated his salary, but failed to mention the upwards of 81% tax rate on clerical salaries. He resisted the closure of a monastery in his diocese and he was arrested in 1961 after libellous articles written against him in the press, and sentenced to eight years' hard labour. Both the Chernigov monastery and the Chernigov cathedral were shut down shortly after his arrest. He was reappointed diocesan bishop after his release, but found that he had to retire to a monastery because his mental health had been wrecked from his experience in the camp.&lt;ref name="autogenerated134"/&gt;

Bishop Ermogen of Tashkent was forced into retirement after he tried to resist the closure of churches. After his arrest, the authorities closed down many churches in his diocese.

The very popular Archbishop Veniamin (Novitsky) of Irkutsk underwent a campaign of character assassination in the Soviet press in connection with a church warden who had accidentally killed a juvenile thief. Veniamin was too popular for the Soviet establishment to tolerate, and so he was removed to the diocese of Chuvashia.

Archbishop Venedikt was arrested and died in prison in 1963 in connection with resisting the closure of churches.&lt;ref name="autogenerated134"/&gt;

Feodosia Varavva was a doctor's aide who had volunteered for military service in the war and worked in front-line hospitals. She was a believer and after the war she was forced to work as a junior nurse in the most infectious sections of hospitals. Her family was given poor living quarters and she petitioned for a better apartment. One of her neighbour's reported that she was a religious believer with icons in her apartment and that she took her children to church. After this report, her husband was told to divorce her and take the children, and then they would be given better housing; he refused to comply. Mrs. Varavva was told to give up her faith if she wanted a better apartment, and she refused. In 1959 the school headmaster saw her children going to church, and he then contacted her and told her to let her son join the Pioneers. She refused on the grounds that it was an antireligious organization. She finally found an apartment in Lvov (she came from Minsk), but the school teachers had reported her and she was being investigated. Her case was notable because when the Soviets began to expel children from church services, Varavva petitioned all the way to the chief CROCA plenipotentiary in Belarus to whom she argued that she had a constitutional right to educate her children as Christians. The chief plenipotentiary then personally phoned the Minsk cathedral and instructed them to give the sacraments to Varavva's children in the sanctuary so that others would not see it. Varavva was not satisfied with this, however, but she fought on principle for other children to be able to take the Sacraments as well. This caused her to be noticed in the Soviet press where she underwent character assassination. She was presented as an intolerant, aggressive woman who was bullying the school and teachers, and that her son was an atheist being forced by his mother to go to church. The Soviet press also reported on parent-teacher meetings in which they voted to deprive Varavva of her parental rights.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pg 143-144&lt;/ref&gt;

The famous Pochaev Lavra monastery, which had been on the territory that the USSR annexed from Poland, underwent considerable persecution in this period and afterwards. It began to be troubled in 1959 when the local soviet tried to deprive the monastery of its livelihood by confiscating its ten hectares of agricultural fields and buildings used for its harvest. Then they deprived it of an apiary containing over 100 beehives. The monastery continued to receive financial support from pilgrims and the local community, which kept it functional, however. In 1960 the authorities forbade restoration work to be carried out on the premises, as well as any overnight visits of pilgrims anywhere on the premises. In order to enforce this, the militia began to raid the monastery at night, throwing out pilgrims sleeping in the yard or the main cathedral which the monks had kept open for devotions 24 hours. The police at the same time began raiding private homes in the vicinity for pilgrims. The pilgrims were both insulted verbally and often beaten severely, which produced several fatalities. In 1961 the authorities confiscated the Bishop's palace, which had been used to house pilgrims. Monks from other monasteries that had been closed had come to live at the Pochaev Lavra, but they were expelled by the militia at the time of the confiscation of the Bishop's palace.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pg 138&lt;/ref&gt;

Many methods were used to empty the monastery. Some monks who were reported to be completely healthy by the monastery, were found by the Pochaev District Military Board to be mentally ill, and were forcefully incarcerated in a mental hospital and 'treated' for their supposed illness in such a way that one of them, a healthy 35-year-old, died after only a few months of 'treatment'. Another commission diagnosed six healthy monks with infectious diseases, which allowed for their removal.&lt;ref name="autogenerated140"&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pg 140&lt;/ref&gt; Thirteen monks were conscripted into military service and sent to fell trees in the north, and were not allowed to return to Pochaev. A novice came to the rescue of women pilgrims who were being beaten by the militia one night, and the militia beat him savagely in response, while the KGB later expelled him from the monastery.

In 1962 the authorities reduced the number of monks from 146 to 36. It began in March 1962 when the authorities informed the monks that they planned to close the monastery and that they should return to their place of birth. The monks refused this, and the authorities then began to threaten them with death if they did not comply. They took away residence permits from some of the monks and applied pressure to the elders of the monastery to expel more. The elders also did not comply. By September the militia began to kidnap monks off the premises into trucks and then drive them back to their native villages where they were left.&lt;ref name="autogenerated139"&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pg 139&lt;/ref&gt;
The official propaganda claimed that the monks left the monastery voluntarily.

It underwent a vicious campaign in the press where its inhabitants were depicted as a nest of fat, greedy, lustful loafers that were raping young female pilgrims and robbing people of their money. Its history was also maligned and it was described as being a nest of traitors who aided forces attacking Russia from the Middle Ages to the Second World War. It was even accused of disloyalty for condemning Ivan the Terrible.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pg 105&lt;/ref&gt; The authorities tried very hard to close the Pochaev Lavra through continual harassment and indirect persecutions, but failed. This case received much publicity that went beyond the Soviet Union (including to the United Nations), much information of the events escaped the USSR (hence there is an excellent record in comparison with many other things that occurred in Khrushchev's campaign), and the monastery also received much support from the local population, who even sometimes physically defended the monks from the militia; these factors contributed to its continued survival.

Petitioners tried to reach the Patriarch, but he was powerless to do anything to solve the situation. Petitioners who complained of abuses were accused of slandering the Soviet government, and monks who went to petition to Moscow, were expelled from the monastery upon their return. A public official in Moscow commented to the petitioners, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;In my opinion all believers are psychologically abnormal people and it is entirely natural for them to be sent into mental hospitals… it is our aim to liquidate religion as quickly as possible; for the time being we partially tolerate it for political reasons, but when a favourable opportunity arises we shall not only close down your monastery but all churches and monasteries.&lt;ref name="autogenerated142"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 12 June 1964 a 33-year-old woman who had sworn an oath of [[virginity]] named Marfa Gzhevskaia was attacked by the militia, who [[rape]]d her and gave her injuries that resulted in her death the following day. The doctors, under police instruction, diagnosed that she had died from acute lung trouble. The police would wait by the public lavatories at night and capture people who came to it, confiscate their money, beat them and rape them if they were women.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pg 141&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 November 1964 four monks were attacked in their cells by police and sent to prison on false charges. One of the monks was sent to a mental institution where he was given injections that made him an invalid for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name="autogenerated140"/&gt;

The persecutions of the monastery stopped in 1964 at the time of Khruschev's removal from power. A report existed that a mysterious circumstance concerning the leader of the persecutors may have affected this, in that his daughter had burned to death in strange circumstances and the father then took her bones to the Monastery for burial, and then moved away.&lt;ref name="autogenerated139"/&gt; His replacement persecuted the monastery even more viciously, but also mysteriously, he committed suicide suddenly and the campaign against the monastery ended. Expelled monks returned afterward, although some could not return as a result, reportedly, of dying in strange circumstances while they were away.

Some persecution continued to exist after 1964, however. Several monks died after being tortured in 1965, and a few arrests were made in 1966.

==Outcome==

People continued to convert to religion to the frustration of the government, and it tenaciously remained widespread among the Soviet population. Some scholars have speculated that the Soviet attempt to eliminate religion was unachievable because religion was an intrinsic need of humans and communism was not a viable substitute.&lt;ref&gt;Nathaniel Davis, A Long Walk to Church: A Contemporary History of Russian Orthodoxy, Westview Press, 2003, xix&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that 50,000 clergy had been executed by the end of the [[Nikita Khrushchev]] era since 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Ostling, Richard. "Cross meets Kremlin", ''Time'' Magazine. June 24, 2001. http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,150718,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; The number of laity killed likely greatly exceed this figure. Members of the church hierarchy were jailed or forced out, their places taken by docile clergy, many of whom had ties with the [[KGB]].

Khrushchev was removed from office in 1964 and [[Brezhnev]] took power. The anti-religious campaign was questioned, not on moral grounds, but on the principle that it did not appear to be producing desired results and it was greatly reduced in intensity in the following years.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4529">The '''Ukrainian Social Democratic Party''' (USDP), originally called the '''Federation of Ukrainian Social Democrats''' (FUSD), was a [[Ukrainian Canadian]] [[socialist]] political party that existed from 1910 to 1918.

==Origins==
In the first decade of the twentieth century, many recent Ukrainian immigrants to Canada who were on the left wing of the political spectrum joined the [[Socialist Party of Canada]] (SPC). Ukrainian branches of the SPC were founded in [[Winnipeg]], [[Portage la Prairie]], and [[Nanaimo, British Columbia|Nanaimo]] in 1907, and four more followed in early 1908. There was also an unsuccessful attempt to launch a '''Ukrainian Socialist Alliance''' within the SPC during the same period.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Krawchuk, ''The Ukrainian Socialist Movement in Canada (1907–1918)'', (Toronto: Progress Books, 1979), pp. 3-5).&lt;/ref&gt; Relations with the SPC's predominantly anglophone leadership were sometimes difficult, and on some occasions Ukrainian party members accused their English comrades of chauvinism.&lt;ref&gt;Krawchuk, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; The SPC leadership was, for its part, reluctant to sanction official networks for cultural communities in the party.

In November 1909, several Ukrainian members of the SPC convened a special Socialist Convention of Canadian Ukrainians in Winnipeg. Delegates advocated for a new organization that would facilitate effective communication among Ukrainian branches of the SPC, while also threatening to withdraw from the party if the Ukrainian community's requests for autonomy were not recognized.&lt;ref&gt;Krawchuk, pp. 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt; The FUSD was formally constituted shortly thereafter and held its first convention in [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]] in August 1910. At this meeting, the party formally severed its ties to the SPC and aligned itself with the newly formed [[Social Democratic Party of Canada]] (SDPC).&lt;ref&gt;Krawchuk, pp. 15, 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The FUSD fielded one candidate in the [[Canadian federal election, 1911|1911 Canadian federal election]]: Wasil Holowacky in the Manitoba division of [[Selkirk (electoral district)|Selkirk]].&lt;ref&gt;Krawchuk, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared on the ballot as an independent and received 234 votes for a third-place finish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parl.gc.ca/About/Parliament/FederalRidingsHistory/hfer.asp?Language=E&amp;Search=Gres&amp;genElection=12&amp;ridProvince=3&amp;submit1=Search History of Federal Ridings since 1867: General Elections, 12th Parliament, Manitoba], [[Parliament of Canada]], accessed 4 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The FUSD changed its name to the USDP in early 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Krawchuk, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==World War I and aftermath==
The USDP was strongly opposed to participation in [[World War I]], which it identified as an imperialist conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Krawchuk, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; At a special conference in April 1915, the party passed a resolution that censured "all socialists who support the war in principle" and called for "the world proletariat to establish a [[Third International|Third Revolutionary International]] on the ruins of the [[Second International]].&lt;ref&gt;Krawchuk, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Several party members were subsequently arrested and placed in internment camps by the [[Canadian government]].&lt;ref&gt;Krawchuk, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

The USDP strongly supported the [[February Revolution]] in [[Russia]] and some of its members welcomed the subsequent [[Bolshevik Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Krawchuk, pp. 68-69, 81.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Canadian government arrested several of the USDP's leaders in 1918, and year it banned the party outright on September 25 of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Krawchuk, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of its prohibition, the USDP had more than two thousand members across Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Krawchuk, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Several members of the party's left wing later joined the [[Communist Party of Canada]] after the CPC's formation in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;''Canada's Party of Socialism'', (Toronto: Progress Books, 1982), pp. 6, 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Uta Ranke-Heinemann by Stuart Mentiply.jpg|thumb|Uta Ranke-Heinemann]]

'''Uta Ranke-Heinemann''' (born 2 October 1927) is a German theologian, academic, and author. She holds the (nondenominational) chair of [[History of Religion]] at the [[University of Duisburg-Essen]] in [[Essen]], her birthplace.

== Early life ==
Ranke-Heinemann's parents were Protestants ([[Calvinism|Calvinistic]]). Her father [[Gustav Heinemann]] was an [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] politician and [[president of Germany]] 1969–1974.&lt;ref name="BeliefnetInterview" /&gt;

== Career ==

After nearly seven years' study of Protestant theology in [[University of Bonn|Bonn]], [[University of Basel|Basel]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], and [[University of Montpellier|Montpellier]], she converted to [[Catholic church|Catholicism]] in 1953 and was promoted to [[Doctor (title)#Germany|doctor]] in 1954 in [[University of Munich|Munich]]. Before 1954 no doctorate in Catholic theology for women was possible.&lt;ref name="BeliefnetInterview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beliefnet.com/Faiths/Catholic/2005/04/A-Humble-Intellect.aspx|title=&gt;Interview with Uta Ranke-Heinemann about Joseph Ratzinger|publisher=Beliefnet.com|accessdate=21 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969 Ranke-Heinemann became the first woman to hold a chair of theology at a German university.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1991-02-11/news/vw-813_1_roman-catholic-church Getlin, Josh. "Clashing With Her Church", ''Los Angeles Times'', February 11, 1991]&lt;/ref&gt; She subsequently held the Essen University chair of ancient church history and the New Testament. In 1987 Bishop of Essen [[Franz Hengsbach]] withdrew her license to teach Catholic theology for disputing the virgin birth of Jesus. This effectively disqualified her from the post she had held for three years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1987-06-20/news/mn-8505_1_church-history "Church Bars 1st Woman Theologian", ''Reuters'', June 20, 1987]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beliefs ==
Ranke-Heinemann's sevenfold farewell to traditional Christianity contains the following:&lt;ref&gt;''Nein und Amen. Mein Abschied vom traditionellen Christentum'', page 417&lt;/ref&gt;

# The Bible is not the [[Biblical inspiration|word of God]] but the [[authors of the Bible|word of men]].
# That [[Trinity|God exists in three persons]] is the imagination of men.
# Jesus is [[Psilanthropism#Modern_psilanthropism|man and not God]].
# [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] is the mother of Jesus and not the [[mother of God]].
# God created [[heaven]] and earth, but [[Hell in Christian beliefs|hell]] is a product of human fantasy.
# The [[devil]] and [[original sin]] do not exist.
# A [[Substitutionary atonement|bloody redemption]] at [[Crucifixion of Jesus|the Cross]] is a pagan [[human sacrifice|sacrificial slaughtering of a human being]], based on a model from the [[prehistoric religion|religious Stone Age]].

It was founded on May 15, 1929 on the example of the [[Sturmabteilung]] by [[Hans Krebs (SS general)|Hans Krebs]] and [[Paul Illing]] under the guise of a sporting organization.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bohemistik.de/sudetistikdaten.html&lt;/ref&gt;

It was banned on 22 February 1932 by Czechoslovak authorities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23542">'''WE ACT for Environmental Justice''' (formerly known as '''West Harlem Environmental Action''') is a [[Nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] [[environmental justice]] organization based in [[Harlem, New York City]]. The organization was founded in March 1988 to mobilize community opposition to the city's operation of the North River Sewage Treatment Plant, and the siting of the sixth bus depot in Northern Manhattan.  [[File:Harlem NYC.JPG|thumb|Bird's Eye view of Harlem, New York City]]

WE ACT is dedicated to fighting environmental justice issues in the Northern Manhattan community.The organization focuses on urban quality of life issues such as [[climate justice]], clean air, access to good jobs,  [[public health]], [[pollution]], and sustainable and equitable land use. It works through citizen empowerment, lobbying, litigation, education, and community outreach to accomplish its goals.

Currently, WE ACT is one of several groups engaged in negotiations for a [[Community Benefits Agreement]] with [[Columbia University]] as part of the school's [[Manhattanville, Manhattan|Manhattanville]] expansion plan. It is also renovating an abandoned [[brownstone]] for conversion into the WE ACT Environmental Justice Center, which will house office and program space as well as serve as a demonstration of various [[Environmental technology|green building technologies]].

== History and organization ==
In April 1986, the North River Sewage Treatment Plant began its operations on eight blocks of riverside property in [[Harlem|West Harlem, New York]].&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Noxious New York: The Racial Politics of Urban Health and Environmental Justice|last=Sze|first=Julie|publisher=MIT Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after its opening, local residents from the predominantly African American and Latino neighborhood complained of noxious odors emitting from the plant and increased exposures to health hazards.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shepard|first=Peggy|date=July–August 2007|title=BUILDING COMMUNITY POWER FOR CHANGE|url=|journal=The Crisis|volume=114|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peggy Shepard]], a local resident, who was elected as a political district leader in 1985, pressured local and state authorities to perform a study on the health effects of exposure to the treatment plant's emissions.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; The study found that the fumes may cause respiratory problems at high levels of exposure, triggering public backlash from West Harlem residents, demanding repairs be made on the facility.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thigpen|first=David|last2=Kuznik|first2=Frank|date=October 1993|title=People who make a difference|url=|journal=National Wildlife|volume=31|issue=6|pages=44–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988 the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) attempted to construct a second bus depot in West Harlem, adjacent to an intermediary school. The MTA was met with strong community opposition, in the form of protests, lawsuits, and scientific research.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

During this period, the attention and discontent surrounding the operation of the North River Sewage Treatment Plant and the construction of a second bus depot in West Harlem, presented the need for a unified movement to address the unequal impact of environmental hazards on the minority community. Therefore, in March 1988 Peggy Shepard, Vernice Miller-Travis, and Chuck Sutton launched WE ACT to "institutionalize resources in the community" to build and educate a community dedicated to fighting environmental injustice and improving environmental health.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

WE ACT emphasizes the importance of citizen involvement in its campaigns and partnerships.It utilizes community-based participatory research to address environmental justice issues and improve the environmental health and quality of life of the Northern Manhattan community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Shepard |first=PM|date=2017-05-06|title=Advancing Environmental Justice through Community-Based Participatory Research|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=110|issue=Suppl 2|pages=139|issn=0091-6765|pmc=1241155|doi=10.1289/ehp.02110s2139}}&lt;/ref&gt; WE ACT strives to educate community members and raise public awareness on issues effecting the health and quality of life of the community.

== Early work  ==

=== North River Sewage Treatment Plant  ===
The construction of the North River Sewage Treatment Plant, was initially proposed for a site along the [[Hudson River]] at 72nd Street, a primarily white and affluent community; however, the site was rejected due to community opposition and logistical problems.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.umich.edu/~snre492/ny.html|title=New York Justice Page|website=www.umich.edu|access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Thus, the site relocated to 137th Street in West Harlem, a predominantly Latino and African-American neighborhood. Local residents were outraged by the new sitting of the sewage plant in their community, concerned it would worsen preexisting pollution problems.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Despite community resistance, construction of the plant started in 1972 and was completed in 1985. When the plant began its operations in 1986, community members further voiced their concerns over noxious odors emanating from the plant effecting an area of almost two miles. Local residents remained indoors to escape the fumes, partly due to their fear of developing adverse health effects resulting from exposure to the fumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/06/opinion/the-editorial-notebook-the-foul-mystery-of-north-river.html|title=The Editorial Notebook; The Foul Mystery of North River|last=Purnick|first=Joyce|authorlink=Joyce Purnick|date=1989-12-06|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-05-05|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by the New York Department of Energy Conservation (DEC), found the plant's emissions contained hydrogen sulfide levels 28% higher than the standard.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Community discontent shifted into activism and in 1988 on [[Martin Luther King Jr. Day|Martin Luther King Day]], WE ACT co-founders Peggy Shepard and Chuck Sutton, along with several others were arrested for blocking traffic around the treatment facility, as an act of protest against the poor operation and management of  the plant.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Due to lawsuits filed by community organizations, resistance from West Harlem residents, and pressure from WE ACT, city officials addressed the plant's operating issues in 1991 and located a design flaw that was causing the excess air pollution.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; After a prolonged court battle with the city and the [[New York City Department of Environmental Protection|Department of Environmental Protection]] (DEP), WE ACT came to a settlement regarding the operations of the sewage plant in December 1993.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shepard|first=Peggy|date=2005-01-01|title=Breathe At Your Own Risk: Transit Justice in West Harlem|jstor=41555237|journal=Race, Poverty &amp; the Environment|volume=12|issue=1|pages=51–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, $1.1 million was set aside in a fund for communal environmental initiatives in West Harlem and WE ACT was made "a monitor of the city's $55 million consent agreement to fix the plant".&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

In an act of appeasement to the West Harlem community for the faulty operating of the sewage plant and occupation of limited open space, the state constructed a 28-acre state park known as the [[Riverbank State Park]] on top of the sewage plant in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/17/nyregion/atop-a-harlem-waste-plant-a-park-grows.html|title=Atop a Harlem Waste Plant, a Park Grows|last=Dunlap |first=David W.|date=1989-05-17|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-05-06|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, fumes and odors continued to seep out of the plant affecting local neighborhoods.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ejatlas.org/conflict/north-river-sewage-treatment-plant|title=North River Sewage Treatment Plant, USA {{!}} EJAtlas|last=EJOLT|website=Environmental Justice Atlas|language=en|access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the North River Sewage Treatment Plant is continuing to improve their facility and upgrade to meet higher air quality standards. In their most recent endeavors the facility has installed new duct work and fans to optimize odor control and reported air issues.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/dep/html/dep_projects/cp_north_river_plant.shtml|title=North River Wastewater Treatment Plant|website=www.nyc.gov|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dirty Diesel  ===
Northern Manhattan is home to one-third of "the largest diesel bus fleet (4,000 vehicles) in the country" operated by the New York [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] (MTA).&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; WE ACT deemed the high concentration of bus depots had negative impacts on air quality and the subsequent health of Northern Manhattan community members.The organization associated the high rates of asthma in Northern Manhattan with concentrated levels of [[Particulates|particulate matter]] (PM), an air pollutant released during diesel fuel combustion, emanating from the bus depots, major transportation routes, and heavy traffic throughout West Harlem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Northridge|first=M. E.|last2=Yankura|first2=J.|last3=Kinney|first3=P. L.|last4=Santella|first4=R.

In November 2000, WE ACT, filed a complaint with the [[United States Department of Transportation|U.S. Department of Transportation]] claiming that bus depots were disproportionately located in minority communities in Northern Manhattan, which houses six of the eight total bus depots in Manhattan, thus elevating the health risks associated with high exposure to harmful diesel exhaust.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ejatlas.org/print/west-harlem-and-the-metropolitan-transportation-authority-usa|title=Environmental Justice Atlas|last=EJOLT|website=ejatlas.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Department of Transportation found that the MTA violated Title IV of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and failed to meet the federal environmental impact analysis involving the construction, rehabilitation, and operation of bus depots and other facilities. This campaign led to the MTA's modification of bus depots and investment in clean-fuel buses, as well as increased public awareness pertaining to the dangers of fuel fumes and poor air quality.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.weact.org/Portals/7/NYTEnvironGroupFilesComplaintAgainstMTA.pdf|title=Environmental Group Files Complaint Against M.T.A.|last=Cardwell|first=Diane|date=16 November 2000|work=New York Times|access-date=28 March 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission  ==
WE ACT states its mission is "to build healthy communities by ensuring that people of color and/or low income residents participate meaningfully in the creation of sound and fair environmental health and protection policies and practices."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.weact.org/whoweare/ourstory/ |title=Our Story|last=|first=|date=|website=WE ACT|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization serves as an "educational resource" to galvanize citizen participation and activism on matters of "environmental health and quality of life issues".&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Asthma ===
In the United States the number of people suffering from [[Asthma]] has grown steadily every year.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns/asthma/ |title=Asthma in the US|last=|first=|date=May 2011|website=Center for Disease Control and Prevention|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=5/4/17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Healthcare professionals have referred to the alarming rise in asthma cases as "a new epidemic".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Phil|last2=Mayer|first2=Brian|last3=Zavestoski|first3=Stephen |last4=Luebke|first4=Theo |last5=Mandelbaum |first5=Joshua|last6=McCormick|first6=Sabrina|date=2003|title=The health politics of asthma: environmental justice and collective illness experience in the United States|url=|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|volume=57|issue=3|pages=453–464 |doi=10.1016/s0277-9536(02)00375-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[respiratory disease]] is characterized by [[Chronic inflammation|chronic]] lung inflammation and episodes of airway constriction.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boehlke |first=Paul |last2=Huang |first2=Shih-Wen|last3=Small|first3=Caroline|date=January 2017|title=Asthma|url=|journal=Magill’s Medical Guide (Online Edition). |volume= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there is uncertainty on the exact cause of the disease, it is believed that "genetic and environmental factors interact to cause asthma, most often early in life".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/asthma/causes|title=What causes asthma?|last=|first=|date=|website=NIH National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=5/4/17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, the focus has turned to the impact of environmental conditions, most notably the exposure to indoor and outdoor air pollutants or allergens.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; WE ACT states that a racial divide exists in air pollution, resulting in the disproportionate exposure of minority or low income communities to high levels of air pollutants.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.weact.org/whatwedo/areasofwork/cleanair/|title=Clean Air {{!}} WE ACT for Environmental Justice|work=WE ACT for Environmental Justice|access-date=2017-05-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; WE ACT works to improve the air quality of Northern Manhattan communities and reduce the incidence of asthma and other respiratory problems by addressing the sources and environmental risks producing harmful [[Air pollution|air pollutants]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

WE ACT focuses on asthma or [[clean air]] as one of its primary areas of concern, because of exceptionally high rates of asthma found in Northern Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/about/press/pr2016/pr088-16.page|title=Health Department Launches Asthma Campaign "Your Child’s Asthma Is Always There, Even When They Seem Perfectly Fine"|last=|first=|date=November 3, 2016|website=NYC Health|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=5/4/17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization highlights the connection between environmental risks in the predominantly Latino and African-American neighborhoods, such as the disproportionate exposure to diesel exhaust and the ubiquitous odors from municipal facilities, and the highest asthma mortality and morbidity rates in New York.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; WE ACT the challenges the city and state to recognize and address air quality problems.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rootsofhealthinequity.org/|title=A Neighborhood Fights Back|last=|first=|date=April 24, 2017|website=National Association of County &amp; City Health Officials|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently WE ACT, is collaborating with several [[Community-Based Organization|community-based]] environmental organizations, such as the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice (DSCEJ), Green Door Initiative (GDI), and Jesus People Against Pollution (JPAP), on the ''National Asthma Disparities Project''.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.weact.org/campaigns/national-asthma-disparities-project/|title=National Asthma Disparities Project - WE ACT for Environmental Justice|work=WE ACT for Environmental Justice|access-date=2017-05-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project aims to study the disparities in asthma treatment across four different communities in the United States, by assessing the effectiveness of the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]]'s (EPA) ''Coordinated Federal Action Plan to Reduce Racial and Ethnic Asthma Disparities (Action Plan)''.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; ''The Action Plan'' was introduced in May 2012, to review federal efforts addressing asthma issues and develop a more effective collaboration among federal programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ashley|first=Peter|last2=Freemer|first2=Michelle|last3=Garbe|first3=Paul|last4=Rowson|first4=David|date=March–April 2017|title=Coordinated Federal Actions Are Needed to Reduce Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Childhood Asthma|url=http://journals.lww.com/jphmp/Fulltext/2017/03000/Coordinated_Federal_Actions_Are_Needed_to_Reduce.21.aspx|journal=Journal of Public Health Management &amp; Practice|volume=23|pages=207–209|doi=10.1097/phh.0000000000000541}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Partnerships ==

=== Community Outreach and Engagement Core (COEC) ===
The Community Outreach and Engagement Core (COEC) is a collaborative program between the [[National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences|NIEHS]] Center for Environmental Health in Northern Manhattan, WE ACT, and other community stakeholders, working to understand and prevent the environmental aspects of diseases such as Parkinson's, Cancer, Asthma, and ALS through policy and legislation.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ccceh.org/our-research/community-outreach-and-research-translation/community-outreach|title=Community Outreach and Engagement - CCCEH.org|work=CCCEH.org|access-date=2017-05-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/programs/niehs-center-environmental-health-northern-manhattan/community-outreach|title=Community Engagement Core {{!}} Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health|website=www.mailman.columbia.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The operations of the COEC focus on four Northern Manhattan communities: Central Harlem, West Harlem, Washington Heights, and Inwood.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Other members of the program include organizations within a close proximity to Northern Manhattan, such as The Columbia Center for Children's Environmental Health (CCCEH) of Columbia University, The Harlem Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention, and the Harlem Hospital Center.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; One of the biggest accomplishments of COEC and WE ACT is the development of an Environmental Health Report Card.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; The report card assigns a grade to New York City communities based on measurements of indoor/outdoor air quality, recreational water quality, solid waste, open space, and the availability of healthy food. By communicating scientific and health research findings through initiatives such as family events and fairs, conferences, forums, and the Environmental Health Report Card, the COEC members seek to increase community awareness of environmental dangers and establish a consistent local involvement in environmental issues.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

WE ACT's involvement in Northern Manhattan communities allows COEC members to acquire information about local environmental health concerns. In turn, WE ACT acts as a bridge for the passing of information between research groups and low-income communities in Northern Manhattan.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Faith Leaders for Environmental Justice ===
WE ACT has collaborated with members of diverse Northern Manhattan churches in an effort to raise public awareness of environmental issues.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.weact.nyc/Coalitions/FaithLeadersforEnvironmentalJustice/tabid/360/Default.aspx|title=faith leaders for environmental justice|last=WEACT.org|website=www.weact.nyc|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the partnership is to encourage people of faith to care about environmental issues and to educate religious figures so that they can inspire environmental justice activism throughout diverse communities that, traditionally, have not engaged in environmental justice issues.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.innerself.com/content/social/democracy/activism/8646-working-with-faith-leaders-for-environmental-justice.html|title=Working With Faith Leaders For Environmental Justice|last=Shepard|first=Peggy M.|website=www.innerself.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Faith Leaders for Environmental Justice]] focuses on three key points: Climate Justice, Food Justice, and Energy Consumption. The Climate Justice work group seeks to promote awareness surrounding the dangers of climate change and the behavioral alterations that can be made to mitigate the effects. In coordination with the Energy Consumption work group, one of the main points of the Climate Justice group is to teach people how to reduce their energy consumption and carbon emissions.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The Food Justice work group aims to educate people about the barriers to healthy eating and the importance of purchasing healthy food, while bringing healthful food initiatives to low-income communities.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Some of these initiatives include Community Sponsored Agriculture (CSA) projects, community and rooftop gardens, food drives, and food stamp outreach.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

=== Healthy Home Healthy Child Campaign ===
The Healthy Homes Project is a joint research initiative between the Columbia University Center for Children's Environmental Health (CCCEH). The project targets the unequal exposure of environmental hazards faced by children in minority or low-income communities and works to educate families on a number of known risk factors such as "cigarettes, lead poisoning, drugs and alcohol, air pollution, garbage, pesticides, and poor nutrition".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Toxic Exposures: Contested Illnesses and the Environmental Health Movement|last=Brown|first=Phil|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2007
