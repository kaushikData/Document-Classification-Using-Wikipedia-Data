'''{{mp|(388188) 2006 DP|14}}''', provisional designation ''{{mp|2006 DP|14}}'', is a sub-kilometer sized, peanut-shaped [[asteroid]] on a highly eccentric orbit, classified as [[near-Earth object]] and [[potentially hazardous asteroid]] of the [[Apollo asteroid|Apollo group]]. This [[Contact binary (small Solar System body)|contact binary]] was discovered on 23 February 2006, by astronomers of the [[Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research|LINEAR]] program at the [[Lincoln Laboratory's Experimental Test Site]] near Socorro, New Mexico, in the United States.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt; On 10 February 2014, it passed 6.25 [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|lunar distances]] from Earth.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Radar-Goldstone" /&gt; The asteroid is approximately 400 meters in diameter and has a [[rotation period]] of 5.77 hours.&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt;{{efn|name=lightcurve-plot-Warner}}

== Classification and orbit ==

''{{mp|2006 DP|14}}'' is a member of the [[Apollo asteroid|Apollo group]], which are [[Earth-crossing asteroid]]s and the largest group of [[near-Earth asteroid]]s.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;

It orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.3–2.4&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] once every 19 months (583 days; [[semi-major axis]] of 1.37&amp;nbsp;AU). Its orbit has a high [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.78 and an [[orbital inclination|inclination]] of 12[[Degree (angle)|°]] with respect to the [[ecliptic]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; As no [[precoveries]] were taken, the body's [[observation arc]] begins with its discovery observation in 2006.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;

=== Close approaches ===

The asteroid has an Earth [[minimum orbit intersection distance]] (MOID) of {{convert |0.0163 |AU |km |abbr=on |lk=off |sigfig=3 |order=flip}},&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; which corresponds to 6.4 [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|lunar distances]] (LD). On 10 February 2014, it passed Earth close to this theoretical minimum distance at 6.25&amp;nbsp;LD, or {{convert |0.016032 |AU |km |abbr=on |lk=off |sigfig=3 |order=flip}}.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Radar-Goldstone" /&gt; This makes is a [[potentially hazardous asteroid]] (PHA), a body with a threatening close approach to the Earth, due to its low MOID and large size ([[absolute magnitude]] of 18.9). PHAs are defined as objects with an absolute magnitude of 22 or brighter – which generically corresponds to a diameter of approximately 140 meters – and a MOID that is smaller than 0.05&amp;nbsp;AU or 19.5&amp;nbsp;LD. 

== Physical characteristics ==
[[File:Asteroid2006DP14.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Radar-imaging of ''{{mp|2006 DP|14}}'']]

''{{mp|2006 DP|14}}'' is an assumed stony [[S-type asteroid]].&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt; This asteroid is a typical [[contact binary]], with two distinctive lobes on either end that appear to be in contact, giving it a peanut-like shape.&lt;ref name="Radar-Goldstone" /&gt; 
 
=== Diameter, shape and albedo ===

On the night of 11 February 2014, NASA scientists conducted a radar imaging session using the 70-meter dish at [[Goldstone Observatory]].&lt;ref name="Radar-Goldstone" /&gt; These observations, using [[Radar altimeter#Delay-Doppler (or SAR) Altimetry|delay-Doppler radar]] imaging, revealed a 400&amp;thinsp;×&amp;thinsp;200 meters sized body,&lt;ref name="Radar-Goldstone" /&gt; while the ''Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link'' calculates a diameter of almost 500 meters, based on an assumed standard [[astronomical albedo|albedo]] for stony asteroids of 0.20 and an absolute [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] of 18.9.&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt;

Amateur and professional [[astronomer]]s helped track ''{{mp|2006 DP|14}}'' in the preceding days, so they would know just where to point the large antenna.&lt;ref name="Radar-Goldstone" /&gt;

=== Rotation period ===

Goldstone's [[radiometric]] observations also gave a [[rotation period]] of approximately 6 hours.&lt;ref name="Radar-Goldstone" /&gt; [[Photometry (astronomy)|Photometric]] follow-up observations led to two [[light-curve]]s that gave a refined period of 5.77 and 5.78 hours with a high brightness variation of 1.05 and 0.9, respectively ({{small|[[LCDB quality code|U=3/3]]}}).&lt;ref name="Warner-2014i" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hicks-2014b" /&gt;{{efn|name=lightcurve-plot-Warner}} Its high brightness amplitude is also indicative for its elongated shape. 

== Naming ==

As of 2018, this [[minor planet]] remains unnamed.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;

'''Agarwood''', '''aloeswood''' or '''gharuwood''' is a fragrant dark [[resin]]ous wood used in incense, perfume, and small carvings. It is formed in the [[heartwood]] of  [[aquilaria]] trees when they become infected with a type of [[mold|mould]] (''Phialophora parasitica''). Prior to infection, the heartwood is odourless, relatively light and pale coloured; however, as the infection progresses, the tree produces a dark aromatic resin, called '''aloes''' or '''agar'''(not to be confused with the edible, algae-derived [[agar]] used in microbiology, medicine and desserts - (as well as ''gaharu'', ''jinko'', ''oud'', or ''oodh''; not to be confused with [[bukhoor]]), in response to the attack, which results in a very dense, dark, resin embedded heartwood. The resin embedded wood is valued in many cultures for its distinctive fragrance, and thus is used for [[incense]] and [[perfume]]s. The aromatic qualities of agarwood are influenced by the species, geographic location, its branch, trunk and root origin, length of time since infection, and methods of harvesting and processing &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=López-Sampson|first=Arlene|last2=Page|first2=Tony|date=2018-03-20|title=History of Use and Trade of Agarwood|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12231-018-9408-4|journal=Economic Botany|language=en|pages=1–23|doi=10.1007/s12231-018-9408-4|issn=0013-0001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Agarwood.jpg|thumb|Uninfected aquilaria wood lacking the dark resin]]

One of the main reasons for the relative rarity and high cost of agarwood is the depletion of the wild resource.&lt;ref name="Broad"&gt;Broad, S. (1995) "Agarwood harvesting in Vietnam" ''TRAFFIC Bulletin'' 15:96&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 1995, ''[[Aquilaria malaccensis]]'', the primary source, has been listed in [[Appendix II|Appendix II (potentially threatened species)]] by the [[CITES|Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora]].&lt;ref name="CITES1"&gt;[http://www.cites.org/eng/notif/2005/025.pdf CITES (25 April 2005) "Notification to the Parties" No. 2005/0025]. (PDF) . Retrieved on 2013-07-22.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2004, all ''Aquilaria'' species were listed in Appendix II; however, a number of countries have outstanding reservations regarding that listing.&lt;ref name="CITES1"/&gt;

First-grade agarwood is one of the most expensive natural raw materials in the world,{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} with 2010 prices for superior pure material as high as US$100,000/kg, although in practice adulteration of the wood and oil is common, allowing for prices as low as US$100/kg.&lt;ref name="chem-rev"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Naef|first1=Regula|title=The volatile and semi-volatile constituents of agarwood, the infected heartwood of Aquilaria species: a review|journal=Flavour and Fragrance Journal|date=March 2010|volume=26|issue=2|pages=73–87|doi=10.1002/ffj.2034}}&lt;/ref&gt; A whole range of qualities and products are on the market, varying in quality with geographical location, botanical species, the age of the specific tree, cultural deposition and the section of the tree where the piece of agarwood stems from.&lt;ref name="archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de"&gt;Dinah Jung, [http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/volltextserver/12039/ ''The Value of Agarwood: Reflections upon its use and history in South Yemen''], Universitätsbibliothel, Universität Heidelberg, 30 May 2011, (PDF) p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Oud oil is distilled from agarwood, and fetches high prices depending on the oil's purity. The current global market for agarwood is estimated to be in the range of US$6 – 8 billion and is growing rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ijlsbd.com/010403.pdf#page=1&amp;zoom=auto,0,792. International Journal of Pharmaceutical and Life Sciences], ISSN 2305-0330, Volume 2, Issue 1: January 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The odour of agarwood is complex and pleasing,&lt;ref&gt;International Journal of Pharmaceutical and Life Sciences, ISSN 2305-0330, Volume 2, Issue 1: January 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; with few or no similar natural analogues. In the perfume state, the scent is mainly distinguished by a combination of "oriental-woody" and "very soft fruity-floral" notes. The incense smoke is also characterized by a "sweet-balsamic" note and "shades of vanilla and musk" and amber (not to be confused with [[ambergris]]).&lt;ref name="archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de"/&gt; As a result, agarwood and its [[essential oil]] gained great cultural and religious significance in ancient civilizations around the world, being described as a fragrant product as early as 1400 BCE in one of the world's oldest written texts – the [[Sanskrit]] [[Vedas]] from [[India]].  Agarwood is highly revered in the seminal texts of Hinduism, Christianity, Buddhism, and Islam &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

Dioscorides in his book Materia Medica (65 CE) described several medical qualities of agarwood (Áγαλλοχου) andmentioned its use as an incense. Even though Dioscorides describes agarwood as having an astringent and bitter taste, it was used to freshen the breath when chewed or as a decoction held in the mouth. He also writes that a root extract was used to treat stomach complaints and dysentery as well as pains of the lungs and liver&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Agarwood’s use as a  medicinal product was also recorded in the [[Sahih Muslim]], which dates back to approximately the eighth century, and in the [[Ayurvedic]] medicinal text the [[Susruta Samhita]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Barden |first1=Angela |last2=Anak |first2=Noorainie Awang |last3=Mulliken |first3=Teresa |last4=Song |first4=Michael |year=2000 |title=Heart of the Matter: Agarwood Use and Trade and CITES Implementation for ''Aquilaria malaccensis'' |location=Cambridge, England |publisher=Traffic International |page=7 |isbn=978-1-85850-177-2 |url=http://www.traffic.org/forestry-reports/traffic_pub_forestry7.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123123800/http://www.traffic.org/forestry-reports/traffic_pub_forestry7.pdf |archive-date=23 November 2008 |dead-url=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as the third century CE in ancient Viet Nam, the [[chronicle]] ''Nan zhou yi wu zhi'' (Lĩnh nam chích quái) (Strange things from the South) written by Wa Zhen of the Eastern [[Wu (state)|Wu Dynasty]] mentioned agarwood produced in the Rinan commandery, now Central [[Vietnam]], and how people collected it in the mountains.
[[File:Qing-Agarwood-Rosary.jpg|thumb|Antique agarwood rosary with inlaid gold, late Qing dynasty, China. Adilnor Collection, Sweden.]]
During the sixth century CE in Japan, in the recordings of the ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'' (The Chronicles of Japan) the second oldest book of classical Japanese history, mention is made of a large piece of fragrant wood identified as agarwood. The source for this piece of wood is claimed to be from [[Pursat Province|Pursat, Cambodia]] (based on the smell of the wood). The famous piece of wood still remains in Japan today and is showcased less than 10 times per century at the [[Nara National Museum]].

Starting in 1580 after [[Nguyễn Hoàng]] took control over the central provinces of modern Vietnam, he encouraged trade with other countries, specifically China and Japan. Agarwood was exported in three varieties: Calambac (kỳ nam in Vietnamese), trầm hương (very similar but slightly harder and slightly more abundant), and agarwood proper. A pound of Calambac bought in [[Hội An]] for 15 [[taels]] could be sold in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] for 600 taels. The [[Nguyễn Lords]] soon established a [[Legal monopoly|Royal Monopoly]] over the sale of Calambac. This monopoly helped fund the Nguyễn state finances during the early years of the Nguyen rule.&lt;ref&gt;Li, Tana (1998) ''Nguyễn Cochinchina: southern Vietnam in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries'', Southeast Asia Program Publications, Ithaca, New York, p. 79, {{ISBN|0-87727-722-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Xuanzang]]'s travelogues and the ''[[Harshacharita]]'', written in seventh century AD in Northern India, mentions use of agarwood products such as 'Xasipat' (writing-material) and 'aloe-oil' in ancient [[Assam]] (Kamarupa). The tradition of making writing materials from its bark still exists in [[Assam]].

==Etymology==
[[File:Aquilaria crassna.jpg|thumb|right|Aquilaria tree showing darker agarwood. Poachers had scraped off the bark to allow the tree to become infected by the [[ascomycetous]] mould.]]
Agarwood is known under many names in different cultures:
* In [[Cambodia]], it is called "chann crassna". The fragrance from this wood is called "khloem chann" (ខ្លឹមចាន់) or "khloem chann crassna". "khloem" is hard wood, "chann crassna" is the tree species ''Aquilaria crassna'' in khmer language.
* In [[Hindustani language|Hindi i]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;t is known as ''agar'', which is derived originally from the  [[Sanskrit]] ''aguru'' .&lt;ref&gt;Pusey, Edward Bouverie (1885) ''Daniel the Prophet: Nine Lectures, Delivered in the Divinity School of the University of Oxford'' Funk &amp; Wagnalls, New York, [https://books.google.com/books?id=COo2AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA515 p. 515], {{OCLC|5577227}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://vedabase.net/a/aguru "Aguru"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100607130524/http://vedabase.net/a/aguru |date=7 June 2010 }} in Sanskrit Dictionary from Bhaktivedanta VedaBase Network&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Bengali language|Bengali]], agarwood is known as "''agor/agoro gach'' (আগর গাছ)" and the agarwood oil as "''agor/agoro attor'' (আগর আতর)".
* It is known by the same Sanskrit name in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and [[Kannada]] as ''Aguru''.
* It is known as ''chénxiāng'' ([[wikt:沉香|沉香]]) in [[Chinese language|Chinese]], "Cham Heong" in [[Cantonese]], ''[[wikt:trầm hương|trầm hương]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tuoitre.com.vn/Tianyon/Index.aspx?ArticleID=159942 Thứ Hai (9 April 2006) "kỳ nam và trầm hương" Tuổi Trẻ Online]. Tuoitre.com.vn. Retrieved on 2013-07-22.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], and ''jinkō'' ([[wikt:沈香|沈香]]) in [[Japanese language|Japanese]]; all meaning "deep scent" and alluding to its intense scent.  In Japan, there are several grades of ''jinkō'', the highest of which is known as ''kyara'' (伽羅).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Book of Incense: Enjoying the Traditional Art of Japanese Scents|last=Morita|first=Kiyoko|publisher=Kodansha USA|year=1999|isbn=4770023898}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Both agarwood and its resin distillate/extracts are known as ''oud'' (عود) in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] (literally "rod/stick") and used to describe agarwood in Arab countries.&lt;ref&gt;Burfield, Tony (2005) [http://www.cropwatch.org/agartrading.htm "Agarwood Trading"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401082004/http://www.cropwatch.org/agartrading.htm |date=1 April 2010 }} ''The Cropwatch Files'', Cropwatch&lt;/ref&gt; Western perfumers also often use agarwood essential oil under the name "oud" or "oudh".&lt;ref&gt;Branch, Nathan (30 May 2009) [http://www.nathanbranch.com/2009/05/dawn-spencer-hurwitz-oude-arab.html "Dawn Spencer Hurwitz Oude Arabique (extrait)"] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120906064107/http://www.nathanbranch.com/2009/05/dawn-spencer-hurwitz-oude-arab.html |date=6 September 2012 }} (fashion and fragrance reviews)&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Europe it was referred to as ''Lignum aquila'' (eagle-wood) or ''Agilawood'', from similarity to Tamil-Malayalam ''aghil'', deriving from Sanskrit ''agaru''.&lt;ref name="Palmer"&gt;Palmer, A. Smythe (1882) ''Folk Etymology''&lt;/ref&gt;
* Another name is ''Lignum aloes'' or Aloeswood, unrelated to the familiar genus, ''[[Aloe]]''. Also from ''aghil'', via Hebrew and Greek.&lt;ref name="Palmer" /&gt;
* In [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] it is known as ཨ་ག་རུ་ (a-ga-ru). There are several varieties used in Tibetan Medicine: unique eaglewood: ཨར་བ་ཞིག་ (ar-ba-zhig); yellow eaglewood: ཨ་ག་རུ་སེར་པོ་ (a-ga-ru ser-po), white eaglewood: ཨར་སྐྱ་ (ar-skya), and black eaglewood: ཨར་ནག་(ar-nag).&lt;ref&gt;Parfionovitch, Yuri; Dorje, Gyurme and Meyer, Fernand (1992) ''Tibetan medical paintings: illustrations to the Blue beryl treatise of Sangye Gyamtso (1653–1705)'' (English edition of Tibetan text &amp; paintings) (2 volumes) Serindia, London, {{ISBN|0-906026-26-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Aromatics, an encyclopedia|year=2010|postscript=. Please note: due to the method of assigning names to medicinal botanicals used in Tibet, it must be considered that woods with similar medicinal properties are named as varieties of the same medicine, and not according to anything akin to the nomenclature of Western botany. Tibetan botanical taxonomy is still in the earliest stage: "white aloeswood" actually refers to the non-aromatic portions of the Indian sandalwood tree; "yellow aloeswood" refers to the scented heartwood of Santalum album. Unique aloeswood is the highest grade of ''Aquilaria agallocha'' resin, known in English as ''Agallochum'', while "black aloeswood" is the resin infused wood of the same tree;  "brown aloeswood" is the scented wood of several ''Dalbergia'' species from India and Bhutan.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
There are seventeen species in the genus ''[[Aquilaria]]'', large evergreens native to [[southeast Asia]], and nine are known to produce agar wood.&lt;ref name="Ng1"&gt;{{cite journal|author =Ng, L.T. |author2=Chang Y.S. |author3=Kadir, A.A. |year=1997|title=A review on agar (gaharu) producing Aquilaria species|journal=Journal of Tropical Forest Products|volume=2|issue=2|pages=272–285}}&lt;/ref&gt; In theory agarwood can be produced from all members; however, until recently it was primarily produced from  ''A. malaccensis''. ''A. agallocha'' and ''A. secundaria'' are synonyms for ''A. malaccensis''.&lt;ref name="Broad"/&gt;  ''A. crassna'' and ''A. sinensis'' are the other two members of the genus that are usually harvested. The [[gyrinops]] tree can also produce agarwood&lt;!-- not checked, just moved from lead --&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;''The genus Gyrinops, is closely related to Aquilaria and in the past all species were considered to belong to Aquilaria.'' Blanchette, Robert A. (2006) [http://forestpathology.cfans.umn.edu/Papua%20New%20Guinea%20Agarwood%20Research.htm "Cultivated Agarwood – Training programs and Research in Papua New Guinea"], Forest Pathology and Wood Microbiology Research Laboratory, Department of Plant Pathology, University of Minnesota&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:condensers.jpg|thumb|right|[[Steam distillation]] process used to extract agarwood essential oils]]

Formation of agar wood occurs in the trunk and roots of trees that have been penetrated by an insect feeding on wood and oily resin, the [[Ambrosia beetle]]  (''Dinoplatypus chevrolati'' by&lt;/ref&gt; Gen.Sc.Prof. Stephan-Alexander Ebu Can Peter, 2017). A mold infection may then occur, and in response, the tree produces a salutary self-defense material to conceal damages or infections. While the unaffected wood of the tree is relatively light in color, the resin dramatically increases the mass and density of the affected wood, changing its color from a pale beige to yellow, orange, red, dark brown or black. In natural forests, only about 7 out of 100 Aquilaria trees of same species are infected and produce aloes/agar wood. A common method in artificial forestry is to [[inoculate]] trees with the fungus. It produces a "damage sap" and is referred to as "fake" aloes/agar wood.&lt;ref name="Ng1" /&gt; Gen.Sc.Prof. Stephan-Alexander Ebu Can Peter, 2017

Oud oil can be distilled from agar wood using steam; the total yield of oil for 70&amp;nbsp;kg of wood will not exceed 20 ml.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=April 2018}}

===Composition===
The composition of agarwood oil is exceedingly complex with more than 150 chemical compounds identified.&lt;ref name=chem-rev /&gt; At least 70 of these are [[terpenoids]] which come in the form of [[sesquiterpenes]] and [[chromones]]; no [[monoterpenes]] have been detected at all. Other common classes of compounds include [[agarofuran]]s, [[Cadalene|cadinane]]s, [[eudesmane]]s, [[Valencene|valencane]]s and [[eremophilane]]s, [[Guaiene|guaiane]]s, [[prezizane]]s, [[vetispirane]]s, simple volatile aromatic compounds as well as a range of miscellaneous compounds.&lt;ref name=chem-rev /&gt; The exact balance of these materials will vary depending on the age and species of tree as well as the exact details of the oil extraction process.

Sri Lankan "agarwood" is known as [[Wala Patta]] and is of the [[Gyrinops walla]] species.

==Conservation of agarwood-producing species==
[[Overharvesting]] and [[habitat loss]] threatens some populations of agarwood-producing species.  Concern over the impact of the global demand for agarwood has thus led to the inclusion of the main taxa on [[CITES]] Appendix II, which requires that international trade in agarwood be monitored. Monitoring is conducted by London-based [[Traffic (conservation programme)|TRAFFIC]] (a joint [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] and [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] programme). CITES also provides that international trade in agarwood be subject to controls designed to ensure that harvest and exports are not to the detriment of the survival of the species in the wild.

In addition, agarwood plantations have been established in a number of countries, and reintroduced into countries such as Malaysia and Sri Lanka as commercial plantation crops. The success of these plantations depends on the stimulation of agarwood production in the trees.  Numerous inoculation techniques have been developed, with varying degrees of success.&lt;ref name="Ng1" /&gt;

Amphitrite was a daughter of [[Nereus]] and [[Doris (mythology)|Doris]] (and thus a [[Nereid]]), according to [[Hesiod]]'s ''Theogony'', but of [[Oceanus]] and [[Tethys (mythology)|Tethys]] (and thus an [[Oceanid]]), according to the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'', which actually lists her among both the Nereids&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-[[Apollodorus of Athens|Apollodorus]], ''Bibliotheca'' i.2.7&lt;/ref&gt; ''and'' the [[Oceanid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''Bibliotheke'' i.2.2 and i.4.6.&lt;/ref&gt; Others called her the personification of the sea itself ([[Seawater|saltwater]]). Amphitrite's offspring included seals&lt;ref&gt;"''...A throng of seals, the brood of lovely Halosydne."'' (Homer, ''[[Odyssey]]'' iv.404).&lt;/ref&gt; and dolphins.&lt;ref&gt;[[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]], ''On Animals'' (12.45) ascribed to [[Arion]] a line "Music-loving dolphins, sea-nurslings of the Nereis maids divine, whom Amphitrite bore."&lt;/ref&gt; Poseidon and Amphitrite had a son, [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]] who was a merman, and a daughter, [[Rhodos]] (if this Rhodos was not actually fathered by Poseidon on [[Halia]] or was not the daughter of [[Asopus]] as others claim). ''Bibliotheca'' (3.15.4) also mentions a daughter of Poseidon and Amphitrite named [[Benthesikyme]].

[[File:Amphitrite Penteskouphia Louvre MNC208.jpg|thumb|left|Amphitrite bearing a [[trident]] on a ''[[pinax]]'' from [[Corinth]] (575–550 BC)]]
Amphitrite is not fully personified in the [[Odyssey|Homeric epics]]: "out on the open sea, in Amphitrite's breakers" (''[[Odyssey]]'' iii.101), "moaning Amphitrite" nourishes fishes "in numbers past all counting" (''Odyssey'' xii.119&lt;!--is this the exact line number? pls check and delete this notice--&gt;). She shares her [[Homer]]ic epithet ''Halosydne'' ("sea-nourished")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vollmer-mythologie.de/halosydne/ Wilhelm Vollmer, ''Wörterbuch der Mythologie'', 3rd ed. 1874]:&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Thetis]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Odyssey]]'' iv.404 (Amphitrite), and ''[[Iliad]]'', xx.207.&lt;/ref&gt; in some sense the sea-nymphs are doublets.

==Representation and cult==
Though Amphitrite does not figure in Greek ''[[Cult (religion)|cultus]]'', at an archaic stage she was of outstanding importance, for in the [[Homeric Hymn]] to Delian Apollo, she appears at the birthing of Apollo among, in Hugh G. Evelyn-White's translation,  "all the chiefest of the goddesses, [[Dione (mythology)|Dione]] and [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]] and [[Ichnaea]] and [[Themis]] and loud-moaning Amphitrite;"  more recent translators&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Jules Cashford, Susan C. Shelmerdine, Apostolos N. Athanassakis.&lt;/ref&gt; are unanimous in rendering "Ichnaean Themis" rather than treating "Ichnae"  as a separate identity. [[Theseus]] in the submarine halls of his father Poseidon saw the daughters of Nereus dancing with liquid feet, and "august, ox-eyed Amphitrite", who wreathed him with her wedding wreath, according to a fragment of  [[Bacchylides]].  [[Jane Ellen Harrison]] recognized in the poetic treatment an authentic echo of Amphitrite's early importance: "It would have been much simpler for Poseidon to recognize his own son... the myth belongs to that early stratum of mythology when Poseidon was not yet god of the sea, or, at least, no-wise supreme there—Amphitrite and the Nereids ruled there, with their servants the Tritons. Even so late as the ''[[Iliad]]'' Amphitrite is not yet 'Neptuni uxor'" [Neptune's wife]".&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, "Notes Archaeological and Mythological on Bacchylides"''The Classical Review'' '''12'''.1 (February 1898, pp. 85–86), p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:House of the Neptune Mosaic (7254082844).jpg|thumb|A [[Roman mosaic]] on a wall in the House of Neptune and Amphitrite, [[Herculaneum]], Italy]]
Amphitrite, "the third one who encircles [the sea]",&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Graves]]. ''[[The Greek Myths]] (1960)''&lt;/ref&gt; was so entirely confined in her authority to the sea and the creatures in it that she was almost never associated with her husband, either for purposes of worship or in works of art, except when he was to be distinctly regarded as the god who controlled the sea. An exception may be the [[cult image]] of Amphitrite that [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] saw in the temple of Poseidon at the [[Isthmus of Corinth]] (ii.1.7).

[[Pindar]], in his sixth Olympian Ode, recognized Poseidon's role as "great god of the sea, husband of Amphitrite, goddess of the golden spindle."  For later poets, Amphitrite became simply a metaphor for the sea: Euripides, in ''Cyclops'' (702) and [[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'', (i.14).

[[Eustathius of Thessalonica|Eustathius]] said that Poseidon first saw her dancing at [[Naxos, Greece|Naxos]] among the other Nereids,&lt;ref&gt;[[Eustathius of Thessalonica]], ''Commentary on Odyssey'' 3.91.1458, line 40.&lt;/ref&gt; and carried her off.&lt;ref&gt;The ''Wedding of Neptune and Ampitrite'' provided a subject to [[Poussin]]; the painting is at Philadelphia.&lt;/ref&gt; But in another version of the myth, she fled from his advances to [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]],&lt;ref&gt;''ad Atlante'', in Hyginus' words.&lt;/ref&gt; at the farthest ends of the sea; there the dolphin of Poseidon sought her through the islands of the sea, and finding her, spoke persuasively on behalf of Poseidon, if we may believe Hyginus&lt;ref&gt;''"...qui pervagatus insulas, aliquando ad virginem pervenit, eique persuasit ut nuberet Neptuno...''" [[Oppian]]'s ''Halieutica'' I.383–92 is a parallel passage.&lt;/ref&gt; and was rewarded by being placed among the stars as the constellation [[Delphinus]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Catasterismi]]'', 31; [[Hyginus]], ''Poetical Astronomy'', ii.17, .132.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the arts of vase-painting and mosaic, Amphitrite was distinguishable from the other [[Nereid]]s only by her queenly attributes. In works of art, both ancient ones and post-Renaissance paintings, Amphitrite is represented either enthroned beside Poseidon or driving with him in a chariot drawn by sea-horses (''[[hippocamp]]s'') or other fabulous creatures of the deep, and attended by [[Triton (god)|Tritons]] and [[Nereids]]. She is dressed in queenly robes and has nets in her hair. The pincers of a crab are sometimes shown attached to her temples.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

'''Calabrian''' is a subdivision of the [[Pleistocene]] [[epoch (geology)|Epoch]] of the [[geologic time scale]], defined as ~1.8 Ma.—781,000 years ago ± 5,000 years, a period of ~{{Mya|1.8-0.781|million years}}.

The end of the stage is defined by the last [[geomagnetic reversal|magnetic pole reversal]] (781 ± 5 Ka) and plunge into an ice age and global drying possibly colder and drier than the late Miocene ([[Messinian]]) through early Pliocene ([[Zanclean]]) cold period.&lt;ref&gt;A chronology of Pliocene sea-level fluctuations, U.S. Atlantic Coastal Plain: Quaternary Science Reviews, v. 10, p. 163–174.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally the Calabrian was a European [[faunal stage]] primarily based on mollusk fossils.  It has become the second geologic age in the Early Pleistocene.  Many of the [[mammal]]ian faunal assemblages of the Early Pleistocene start in the [[Gelasian]]. For example, the [[Platygonus]] and other [[Blancan]] fauna appear first in the Gelasian.

==History of the definition of the Calabrian==
Because sea shells are much more abundant as fossils, 19th- and early-20th-century geo-scientists used the plentiful and well-differentiatable [[Mollusca]] (mollusks) and [[Brachiopod]]s to identify [[Stratigraphy|stratigraphic]] boundaries. Thus the Calabrian was originally defined as an assemblage of mollusk fossils, most brachiopods being extinct by then.  Efforts were then made to find the best representation of that assemblage in a [[stratigraphic section]]. By 1948 scientists used the initial appearance of cool-water (northern) invertebrate faunas in [[Mediterranean]] marine sediments as the beginning marker for the Calabrian. The 18th International Geological Congress in London (1948) placed the base of the Pleistocene at the base of the marine strata of the Calabrian Faunal Stage and denominated a [[Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point|type section]] in [[Mezzogiorno|southern Italy]].  However, it was discovered that the original type section was discontinuous at that point and that the base of the Calabrian Stage as defined by fauna assemblages extended to earlier levels within the Pleistocene. A new type section was chosen, several miles from the original one, at Vrica, 4&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Crotone]] in [[Calabria]], southern Italy. Analysis of [[strontium]] and [[oxygen]] [[isotope]]s as well as of [[plankton]]ic [[foraminifera]] has confirmed the viability of the current type section.  The 27th International Geological Congress in Moscow in 1984 formally ratified the type section.  The starting date was originally thought to be about 1.65 million years ago, but has been recalculated as 1.806 Mya.&lt;ref name="GeoW1"&gt;{{GeoWhen|Early_Pleistocene}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present formal definition==
The Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point, [[GSSP]], for the former&lt;ref&gt;In 2009 the [[Gelasian]] was included within the Pleistocene, making the Calabrian the second stage in the Pleistocene. {{Cite journal|first1=Philip L.|last1=Gibbard|first2=Martin J.|last2=Head|first3=Michael J. C.|last3=Walker|year=2009|title=Formal ratification of the Quaternary System/Period and the Pleistocene Series/Epoch with a base at 2.58 Ma|journal=Journal of Quaternary Science|volume=25|issue=2|page=96|doi=10.1002/jqs.1338}} [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jqs.1338/abstract abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; start of the Pleistocene is in a reference section at Vrica, 4&amp;nbsp;km south of Crotone in Calabria, [[Southern Italy]], a location whose exact dating has recently been confirmed by analysis of strontium and oxygen isotopes as well as by planktonic foraminifera.&lt;ref name="Lourens"&gt;Lourens, L., Hilgen, F., Shackleton, N.J., Laskar, J., Wilson, D., (2004) “The Neogene Period”. In: Gradstein, F., Ogg, J., Smith, A.G. (Eds.), Geologic Time Scale Cambridge University Press, Cambridge;&lt;/ref&gt;

The beginning of the Calabrian hence is defined as:  Just above top of magnetic polarity chronozone C2n (Olduvai) and the extinction level of calcareous nannofossil ''[[Discoaster]] brouweri'' (base Zone CN13).  Above the boundary are the lowest occurrence of calcareous nannofossil medium ''[[Gephyrocapsa]] spp.'' and the extinction level of the planktonic foraminifer ''[[Globigerinoides]] extremus''.&lt;ref name="GeoW1"/&gt;

The end of the Calabrian is defined as the [[Brunhes–Matuyama reversal|Brunhes–Matuyama magnetic reversal]] event.&lt;ref name="Lourens"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Cita, Maria Bianca|authorlink=Maria Bianca Cita|year=2008|title=The Calabrian stage redefined|journal=Episodes|volume=31|issue=4|pages=408&amp;ndash;419|url=http://www.episodes.co.in/www/Backissues/314/408-419%20%20calabrian.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221080700/http://www.episodes.co.in/www/Backissues/314/408-419%20%20calabrian.pdf#|archivedate=2013-12-21|deadurl=yes|display-authors=etal|access-date=2013-12-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Carnarvon xeric shrublands''' is a [[deserts and xeric shrublands]] [[ecoregion]] of [[Western Australia]], contiguous with the '''Carnarvon''' [[Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia]] (IBRA) bioregion.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=aa1301|name=Carnarvon xeric shrublands}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location and description==
The ecoregion covers an area of 90,500 square kilometers (34,900 square miles) from the bounded by the [[Indian Ocean]] to the west from the [[Peron Peninsula]] in [[Shark Bay]] up to the [[North West Cape]]. The [[Pilbara shrublands]] lie to the northeast, the [[Western Australian Mulga shrublands]] to the east, and the [[Southwest Australia savanna]] to the south. The region is named for the coastal town of [[Carnarvon, Western Australia|Carnarvon]] and includes a number of coastal towns and tourist resorts. 

The terrain is generally low, and the vegetation varies with the underlying geology, which consists mostly of recent alluvial, aeolian, and marine sediments over [[cretaceous]] strata. This is a very dry region with less than 250mm of rainfall per year.

==Flora==
Low samphire and saltbush shrublands cover the saline alluvial plains, [[Acacia xiphophylla|snakewood]] scrublands cover the clay flats, [[Bowgada]] low woodland covers sandy ridges and plains, red sand dune fields are interspersed or overlain with tree to shrub steppe over hummock grasslands, and ''[[Acacia]] startii/A. bivenosa'' shrublands cover limestone outcrops in the north. Other trees in the area include limestone wattle (''[[Acacia sclerosperma]]'') with an undergorwth of dead finish (''[[Acacia tetragonophylla]]''). The sheltered embayments and extensive tidal flats along the coast support [[mangrove]]s.

==Fauna==
Wildlife of the area includes birds such as the [[thick-billed grasswren]] and the [[red-tailed black cockatoo]]. This is also the area where it is possible that there may be a surviving population of the [[lesser stick-nest rat]] which is thought to be extinct.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6076">'''Dispatchable generation''' refers to sources of electricity that can be used ''on demand'' and  dispatched at the request of power grid operators, according to market needs. Dispatchable generators can be turned on or off, or can adjust their power output according to an order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.johnson.cornell.edu/Center-for-Sustainable-Global-Enterprise/News-Events/CSGE-Student-Article-Detail/ArticleId/1791/Johnson-s-Energy-Club-Competes-in-Renewable-Energy-Case-Competition.aspx |title=Johnson’s Energy Club Competes in Renewable Energy Case Competition |first=Duncan |last=Cooper|publisher= Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management |date= 22 March 2012
|accessdate=29 August 2012 |quote=Most conventional energy sources are dispatchable, meaning that they can be turned on or off according to the demand for electricity.  The amount of electricity they produce can also be turned up or down so that supply of electricity matches the amount demanded by users.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
This is in contrast with non-dispatchable renewable energy sources such as [[wind power]] and [[Photovoltaics|solar PV]] power which cannot be controlled by operators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visionofearth.org/industry/electricity-grid-key-terms-and-definitions/ Electricity Grid: Key Terms and Definitions]&lt;/ref&gt; 
The only types of renewable energy that are dispatchable without separate energy storage are [[biomass]], [[geothermal energy|geothermal]] and [[ocean thermal energy conversion]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.nl/books?id=MZ3DklIQuT0C&amp;pg=PA860&amp;dq=dispatchable+otec&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KY2bVaGsDsKvsQGbl6fgCQ&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=dispatchable%20otec&amp;f=false Global Energy Assessment: Toward a Sustainable Future]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dispatchable plants have different speed at which they can be dispatched.
The fastest plants to dispatch are [[hydroelectric power plants]] and [[natural gas power plant]]s. 
For example, the 1,728 MW [[Dinorwig Power Station|Dinorwig pumped storage power plant]] can reach full output in 16 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iprplc-gdfsuez.com/~/media/Files/I/IPR-Plc/Attachments/presentations-pdfs/2009/hydro_09.pdf Welcome to First Hydro]&lt;/ref&gt;
Although theoretically dispatchable, certain thermal plants such as nuclear or coal are designed to run as [[base load power plant]]s and may take hours or sometimes days to cycle off and then back on again.&lt;ref&gt; https://www.thestar.com/business/economy/2013/08/13/blackout_2003_how_ontario_went_dark.html "three to four days"&lt;/ref&gt;  

The attractiveness of [[Grid energy storage|utility-scale energy storage]] is that it can compensate for the indeterminacy of wind power and solar PV power. 
During 2017, [[concentrated solar power|solar thermal storage power]] has become cheaper and a bulk dispatchable source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://helioscsp.com/dispatchable-solar-concentrated-solar-power-broke-price-records-in-2017/ |title=Dispatchable Concentrated Solar Power Broke Price Records in 2017 |accessdate= 22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://helioscsp.com/uaes-push-on-concentrated-solar-power-should-open-eyes-across-world/|title=UAE’s push on concentrated solar power should open eyes across world|accessdate= 26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/articles/print/volume-18/issue-110/features/thermal-renewable-energy/commercializing-standalone-thermal-energy-storage.html|title=Commercializing Standalone Thermal Energy Storage |accessdate= 1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/apr/06/salt-silicon-or-graphite-energy-storage-goes-beyond-lithium-ion-batteries|title=Salt, silicon or graphite: energy storage goes beyond lithium ion batteries  |accessdate= 1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Earlier, affordable large-scale storage technologies other than hydro were not available. 

The main reasons why dispatchable power plants are needed are:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visionofearth.org/industry/renewable-energy/renewable-energy-review/how-can-renewables-deliver-dispatchable-power-on-demand/ How can renewables deliver dispatchable power on demand?]&lt;/ref&gt;
# to provide spinning reserves (frequency control),
# to balance the electric power system (load following),
# to optimize the economic generation dispatch (merit order), and
# to contribute to clear grid congestion (redispatch).
 
Use cases for dispatchable generators comprise:
* Load matching - slow changes in power demand between, for example, night and day, require changes in supply too, as the system needs to be balanced at all times (see also [[Electricity]]).
* Peak matching - short periods of time during which demand exceeds the output of load matching plants; generation capable of satisfying these peaks in demand is implemented through quick deployment of output by flexible sources.
* Lead-in times - periods during which an alternative source is employed to supplement the [[lead time]] required by large [[coal]] or [[natural gas]] fueled plants to reach full output; these alternative power sources can be deployed in a matter of seconds or minutes to adapt to rapid shocks in demand or supply that cannot be satisfied by peak matching generators.
* Frequency regulation or intermittent power sources - changes in the electricity output sent into the system may change quality and stability of the [[Electric power transmission|transmission]] system itself because of a change in the frequency of electricity transmitted;  renewable sources such as wind and solar are intermittent and need flexible power sources to smooth out their changes in energy production.
* Backup for base-load generators - Nuclear power plants, for example, are equipped with [[nuclear reactor safety systems]] that can stop the generation of electricity in less than a second in case of emergency.

'''Eco-sufficiency''' requires a reduction in the consumption of energy and natural resources and in the generation of waste (among which [[GHG emissions]]) in absolute terms.

This goes beyond the goal of increasing [[eco-efficiency]], which focuses on increasing output per unit of input to foster [[Eco-economic_decoupling|decoupling]]. Given a very loose relation in rich countries between [[GDP]] and human well-being, pursuing eco-sufficiency may be possible without reducing the latter by, for example, increasing leisure and communal activities.

== History ==

In 1993, [[Wolfgang Sachs]] summarised sufficiency with "four Ds"&lt;ref&gt;[[Wolfgang Sachs]], "Die vier E’s: Merkposten für einen maßvollen Wirtschaftsstil", ''Politische Ökologie'', 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;:
* Decelerate (going slower and less far);
* De-clutter (accumulate fewer things);
* Decentralize (choosing local and regional) ;
* Decommercialization (leaving less room for the [[Market economy|market]] in your life).

== Description and examples ==

There are potentials to substantially reduce the use of [[natural resources]] without compromising human wealth. However, many studies show that [[economic growth]] “eats up” these gains at least partially; if the economy grows by 2% per annum, we need an increase in [[resource productivity]] of 4% in order to achieve a 2% reduction in absolute resource use. While [[eco-efficiency]] aims to improve the effectiveness of material, energy, and land use, eco-sufficiency aims at reducing negative environmental consequences through a reduction of the demand for consumer goods.

Eco-sufficiency is closely to related  issues of [[quality of life]] and [[work-life balance]]. It can to some extent be achieved on the individual level, e.g. through energy savings, reduction of transport and change in diets (less meat). However, it also requires a change in social frameworks, provided on the national or European level, including measures such as [[ecotax|environmental tax]]es, [[environmental planning]] and new concepts of labour.

Eco-sufficiency is largely associated with the idea of altruism – the sober lifestyle adopted by its advocates is a manifestation of their concern for the well-being of future generations – and thus to date is endorsed by only a small minority of members of industrialised societies. A wide spread of eco-sufficiency will only occur, if people find the new lifestyles sufficiently attractive. It needs to be shown that less material wealth can bring increased well-being or [[happiness]] to individuals and societies. For example, it has been shown that downsizing or relocating consumers can be motivated by purely selfish reasons such as improving one’s health, avoiding stress, the nostalgia for a “good old time” and so on.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sapiens.revues.org/index1022.html Boulanger, P.M. (2010) “Three strategies for sustainable consumption”. ''S.A.P.I.EN.S.'' '''3''' (2) ]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
An important aspect here is related to the so-called work-and-spend cycle. If [[leisure]] and forms of work other than [[employment]] (incl. [[self-employment]]), such as caring, [[do it yourself]] and community work gain relevance, income - and therefore consumption - would be reduced.

'''Enamtila''' ({{cuneiform|É.NAM.TI.LA, E-nam-ti-la}}) is a [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] term meaning "house of life" or possibly "house of creation".&lt;ref name="George1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=A.

'''Energy in Jordan''' describes [[World energy resources and consumption|energy]] and [[Electricity generation|electricity]] production, consumption and import in [[Jordan]]. Jordan is among the highest in the world in dependency on foreign energy sources, with 96% of the country's energy needs coming from imported oil and natural gas from neighboring Middle Eastern countries. This complete reliance on foreign oil imports consumes a significant amount of Jordan's GDP. This led the country to plan investments of $15 billion in renewable and nuclear energy. To further address these problems, the National Energy Strategy for 2007-2020 was created which projects to boost reliance on domestic energy sources from 4 per cent to 40 per cent by the end of the decade.

Moreover, multiple attacks on the [[Arab Gas Pipeline]] from 2011-2014 which supplies 88% of the country's electricity generation needs - forced the country’s power plants onto diesel and [[heavy fuel oil]], costing the treasury millions of dinars and pushing the national energy bill to record highs, over JD4 billion.

Primary energy use in Jordan was, in 2009, 87 TWh and 15 TWh per million persons and, in 2008, 82 TWh and 14 TWh/million persons.&lt;ref name=IEA2011a2010&gt;[http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2011/key_world_energy_stats.pdf IEA Key energy statistics 2011] [http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2010/key_stats_2010.pdf Statistics 2010] Page: Country specific indicator numbers from page 48&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural gas==
Natural gas is increasingly being used to fulfill the country’s domestic energy needs, especially with regard to electricity generation. Jordan was estimated to have only modest natural gas reserves (about 6&amp;nbsp;billion cubic meters in 2002), but new estimates suggest a much higher total. In 2003 the country produced and consumed an estimated 390&amp;nbsp;million cubic meters of natural gas. The primary source is located in the eastern portion of the country at the Risha gas field. In the past, the country imported the bulk of its natural gas via the [[Arab Gas Pipeline]] that stretches from the Al Arish terminal in Egypt underwater to [[Aqaba|Al Aqabah]] and then to northern Jordan, where it links to two major power stations. This Egypt–Jordan pipeline supplied Jordan with approximately 1&amp;nbsp;billion cubic meters (BCM) of natural gas per year.&lt;ref name=cp&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Jordan.pdf "Country Profile: Jordan"]. [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (September 2006). {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jordan has developed one gas field, at Risha in the eastern desert near the border with [[Iraq]]. The current output of around 30 million cubic feet per day (Mmcf/d) from the Risha field is used to fuel one nearby power plant, which generates about 10% of Jordan's electricity.&lt;ref name="MBendi"&gt;[http://www.mbendi.com/indy/oilg/gas_/as/jo/p0005.htm MBendi: Natural Gas Liquid Extraction in Jordan]&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2001, a 30-year agreement had been concluded with Egypt for gas sales to begin at a rate of 100 Mmcf/d beginning in 2003. Construction of the section of the pipeline in Egypt began in late 2001, starting from the existing pipeline terminus at El-Arish in Sinai. This section was completed in mid-2003, allowing deliveries to begin to one power plant at Aqaba.

In August 2003, Jordan began imports of natural gas from Egypt.&lt;ref name="MBendi"/&gt; The second phase of the project, which connected to the Rihab power plant approximately 70&amp;nbsp;km north of the capital Amman, was completed in early 2006. The plant site is approximately 835 meters above sea level and located within a rural area surrounded by extensive agricultural land. The Rihab power plant comprises 2 simple cycle gas turbines which are nominally rated at 30 MW gross and a 297 MW combined-cycle gas turbine which comprises 2 gas turbines with 100 MW and 1 steam turbine with 97 MW.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cegco.com.jo/?q=en/node/77 CEGCO Rehab Gas Turbine Power Station]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gas supplies from Egypt were halted in 2013 due to insurgent activities in the Sinai and domestic gas shortages in Egypt. In light of this, a [[liquified natural gas]] terminal was built in the Port of Aqaba to facilitate gas imports. In 2017, a low-capacity gas pipeline from Israel was completed which supplies the [[Arab Potash]] factories near the Dead Sea. As of 2018, a large capacity pipeline from Israel is under contstruction in northern Jordan which is expected to begin operating by 2020 and will supply the kingdom with 3 BCM of gas per year, thereby satisfying the bulk of Jordan’s natural gas consumption needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ghazal |first1=Mohammad |title=Israeli gas to Jordan expected in 2020 — official |url=http://jordantimes.com/news/local/israeli-gas-jordan-expected-2020-—-official |accessdate=6 July 2018 |publisher=[[The Jordan Times]] |date=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although oil shale was utilized in northern Jordan prior to and during [[World War I]], intensive exploration and studies of Jordan's oil shale resource potential started in the 1970s and 1980s, being motivated by higher oil prices, modern technology and better economic potential. As of 2011, no [[oil shale industry]] exists in Jordan, but several companies are considering both [[shale oil extraction]] and oil shale [[combustion]] for [[thermal power station|thermal power generation]].&lt;ref name=jordantimes2&gt;

Plans are in place to construct two 1,000MW reactors, nearly doubling the Kingdom's electricity generation capacity, by 2022. Jordan plans to get 60% of its energy needs from nuclear energy by 2035. According to the JAEC, all evaluations took into account the highest safety requirements, including lessons from the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima incident]]. The plants will be used for electricity generation and desalination.&lt;ref name="jordan"&gt;{{cite web | work= [[Haaretz]] | author=Yoav Stern |url= http://www.haaretz.com/news/jordan-announces-plans-to-build-nuclear-power-plant-by-2015-1.217260 | title = Jordan announces plans to build nuclear power plant by 2015 | date = 2007-06-12 | accessdate=2007-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government first chose a site 25 kilometers south of the [[Red Sea]] port of [[Aqaba]]&lt;ref name="wnn140409a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wnn200808"/&gt; but shifted the tentative location to the [[Mafraq]] area, 40 kilometers northeast of [[Amman]], citing the proximity to the Khirbet Al Samra power plant for using its wastewater to cool the reactor. The decision to relocate the site was taken by the Belgian contractor, Tractabel, which has concluded that the seismic padding required to build on the original site near Aqaba would have led to additional costs of about 15 percent according to [[Jordan Atomic Energy Commission|JAEC]] officials.&lt;ref name="arabnews"/&gt;

In December 2009, [[Jordan Atomic Energy Commission]] (JAEC) in cooperation with a consortium headed by the [[Korean Atomic Energy Research Institute]] signed an agreement with [[Daewoo Heavy Industries]] to build a its first 5&amp;nbsp;MW research reactor by 2015 at the [[Jordan University of Science and Technology]].&lt;ref name=wnn270410&gt;

== Renewable ==
The National Energy Strategy includes ambitious targets to increase the contribution of [[renewable energy]] sources to the national energy supply. The share of renewable energy in the total energy mix is anticipated to reach 7% by 2015 and 10% by 2020. Plans are in place for up to 2,000&amp;nbsp;MW in [[solar energy|solar]] and [[wind energy]] projects by the end of the decade, with 64 international firms expressing interest in various projects across the country. The government is looking to generate 30–50&amp;nbsp;MW of biomass by 2020.&lt;ref name=wind&gt;[http://www.menafn.com/menafn/1093278395/Negotiations-stalling-Jordans-first-wind-power-plant Negotiations-stalling-Jordans-first-wind-power-plant]&lt;/ref&gt; The passage of the ''Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Law'', which aims to streamline investment procedures and paves the way for citizens to sell electricity back to the national grid, would go a long way into breathing life into the alternative energy sector.&lt;ref name=bawaba&gt;[http://www.albawaba.com/%E2%80%98unstable%E2%80%99-gas-supplies-highlight-potential-energy-crisis-402863 'Unstable’ gas supplies highlight potential energy crisis in Jordan']&lt;/ref&gt; By November 2014 Jordan had 10&amp;nbsp;MW of installed capacity from renewable energy, and had over 15 renewable energy power plants in progress to be completed by the end of 2015, raising the installed capacity to 500&amp;nbsp;MW, representing 14% of the overall installed capacity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iqtisadjordan.com/2014/11/jordan-will-achieve-14-of-electricity.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Jordan lies within the solar belt of the world with average solar radiation ranging between 5 and 7&amp;nbsp;[[kilowatt-hour]] (kWh) per square metre. [[Decentralized generation]] from [[photovoltaic system]]s in rural and remote villages is currently used for lighting, water pumping and other social services of up to 1000&amp;nbsp;kW of peak capacity. In addition, about 15% of all households are equipped with [[solar water heating]] systems.&lt;ref name=solarjordan&gt;[http://www.ecomena.org/solar-energy-jordan/?goback=.gde_2144331_member_118073788 Solar Energy in Jordan]&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2012, a 280&amp;nbsp;kW solar electricity system was inaugurated to be used at El Hassan Science City.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.petra.gov.jo/Public_News/Nws_NewsDetails.aspx?Site_Id=1&amp;lang=2&amp;NewsID=71966&amp;CatID=13&amp;Type=Home&amp;GType=1 Princess Sumaya inaugurates 280kw solar electricity system]&lt;/ref&gt;

As per the Energy Master Plan, 30 percent of all households are expected to be equipped with solar water heating system by the year 2020.&lt;ref name=solarjordan /&gt; The government is hoping to construct the first [[concentrated solar power]] (CSP) demonstration project in the short to medium term and is considering Aqaba and the south-eastern region for this purpose.

The initial key to his proposal, the complementary shapes of the continental masses, had been observed as early as  the 16th century by [[Abraham Ortelius]], but had lacked a credible driving force.  His own proposition was that the moon was captured by the Earth's gravity during the [[Cretaceous]] period 100 million years ago, and came so close to the earth that its tidal pull dragged the continents toward the Equator.  This lacked evidence, thus undermining the credibility of the continental drift observation. He had proposed that the continents ploughed through the ocean floors towards the equator, wrinkling their Equator-facing fronts to produce the Himalayas and Alps. Although his proposed mechanism was wrong, he was the first to come to the insight that one of the effects of continental motion would be the formation of mountains due to the collision of continental plates.&lt;ref name=Powell2015 /&gt;

In [[signal processing]], '''group delay''' is the time delay of the amplitude [[Envelope (waves)|envelopes]] of the various [[Sine wave|sinusoid]]al [[Fourier series|components]] of a signal through a [[device under test]], and is a function of frequency for each component.  '''Phase delay''', in contrast, is the time delay of the ''phase'' as opposed to the time delay of the ''amplitude envelope''.

All frequency components of a signal are delayed when passed through a device such as an amplifier, a loudspeaker, or propagating through space or a medium, such as air. This signal delay will be different for the various frequencies unless the device has the property of being [[linear phase]] ("Linear phase" and [[minimum phase|"minimum phase"]] are often used interchangeably, but are actually quite different.) The delay variation means that signals consisting of multiple frequency components will suffer distortion because these components are not delayed by the same amount of time at the output of the device. This changes the shape of the signal in addition to any constant delay or scale change. A sufficiently large delay variation can cause problems such as poor [[High fidelity|fidelity]] in audio or [[intersymbol interference]] (ISI) in the [[demodulation]] of [[digital information]] from an [[analog signal|analog]] [[carrier signal]].  High speed [[modem]]s use [[adaptive equalizer]]s to compensate for non-constant group delay.

== Introduction ==
Group delay is a useful measure of time distortion, and is calculated by [[Derivative|differentiating]], with respect to frequency, the [[phase response]] of the device under test (DUT): the group delay is a measure of the slope of the phase response at any given frequency. Variations in group delay cause signal distortion, just as deviations from linear phase cause distortion.

In [[LTI system theory|linear time-invariant (LTI) system theory]], [[control theory]], and in [[digital signal processing|digital]] or [[analog signal processing|analog]] [[signal processing]], the relationship between the input signal, &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle x(t)&lt;/math&gt;, to output signal, &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle y(t)&lt;/math&gt;, of an LTI system is governed by a [[convolution]] operation:

: &lt;math&gt; y(t)  = (h*x)(t) \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(u) h(t-u) \, du  &lt;/math&gt;

Or, in the [[frequency domain]],

: &lt;math&gt; Y(s) = H(s) X(s)  \, &lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt; X(s)  =  \mathcal{L}\left \{ x(t) \right \} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \int_{0}^{\infty} x(t) e^{-st}\, dt  &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; Y(s)  =  \mathcal{L}\left \{ y(t) \right \} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \int_{0}^{\infty} y(t) e^{-st}\, dt &lt;/math&gt;

and

: &lt;math&gt; H(s)  =  \mathcal{L}\left \{ h(t) \right \} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \int_{0}^{\infty} h(t) e^{-st}\, dt &lt;/math&gt;.

Here &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle h(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the time-domain [[impulse response]] of the LTI system and &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle X(s)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle Y(s)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle H(s)&lt;/math&gt;, are the [[Laplace transform]]s of the input &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle x(t)&lt;/math&gt;, output &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle y(t)&lt;/math&gt;, and impulse response &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle h(t)&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.  &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle H(s)&lt;/math&gt; is called the [[transfer function]] of the LTI system and, like the impulse response &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle h(t)&lt;/math&gt;, ''fully'' defines the input-output characteristics of the LTI system.

Suppose that such a system is driven by a quasi-sinusoidal signal, that is, a [[Sine wave|sinusoid]] whose amplitude envelope &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle a(t)&lt;/math&gt; is slowly-changing relative to the frequency &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \omega&lt;/math&gt; of the sinusoid. Mathematically, this means that the driving signal has the form

: &lt;math&gt; x(t) = a(t) \cos(\omega t + \theta) \ &lt;/math&gt;

subject to the assumption

: &lt;math&gt; \left| \frac{d \log \left( a(t) \right)}{dt} \right| \ll \omega\;.&lt;/math&gt;

Then the output of such an LTI system is very well approximated as

: &lt;math&gt; y(t) = |H(i \omega)| \ a(t - \tau_g) \cos \left( \omega (t - \tau_\phi) + \theta \right) \; .&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \tau_g&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \tau_\phi&lt;/math&gt;, the '''group delay''' and '''phase delay''' respectively, are given by the expressions below (and potentially are functions of the [[angular frequency]] &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \omega&lt;/math&gt;).

In a [[linear phase]] system (with non-inverting gain), both &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \tau_g&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \tau_\phi&lt;/math&gt; are constant (i.e. independent of &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \omega&lt;/math&gt;) and equal, and their common value equals the overall delay of the system; and the unwrapped [[Phase (waves)|phase shift]] of the system (namely &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle -\omega \tau_\phi&lt;/math&gt;) is negative, with magnitude increasing linearly with frequency &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \omega&lt;/math&gt;.

More generally, it can be shown that for an LTI system with transfer function &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle H(s)&lt;/math&gt; driven by a [[phasor|complex sinusoid]] of unit amplitude,

: &lt;math&gt; x(t) = e^{i \omega t} \ &lt;/math&gt;

the output is

: &lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
 y(t) &amp; = H(i \omega) \ e^{i \omega t} \ \\
      &amp; = \left( |H(i \omega)| e^{i \phi(\omega)} \right) \ e^{i \omega t} \ \\
      &amp; = |H(i \omega)| \ e^{i \left(\omega t + \phi(\omega) \right)} \ \\
\end{align} \ &lt;/math&gt;

where the phase shift &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \phi&lt;/math&gt; is

: &lt;math&gt; \phi(\omega) \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ \arg \left\{ H(i \omega) \right\}  \;. &lt;/math&gt;

Additionally, it can be shown that the group delay, &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \tau_g&lt;/math&gt;, and phase delay, &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \tau_\phi&lt;/math&gt;, are frequency-dependent, and they can be computed from the phase shift &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \phi&lt;/math&gt; by

: &lt;math&gt; \tau_g(\omega) = - \frac{d \phi(\omega)}{d \omega} \ &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \tau_\phi(\omega) = - \frac{\phi(\omega)}{\omega} \ &lt;/math&gt; .

== Group delay in optics ==
In [[physics]], and in particular in [[optics]], the term '''group delay''' has the following meanings:

:'''1.'''  The rate of change of the total phase shift with respect to [[angular frequency]], 
::&lt;math&gt; \tau_g = -\frac{d\phi}{d\omega}&lt;/math&gt;
:through a device or [[transmission medium]], where &lt;math&gt; \phi \ &lt;/math&gt; is the total phase shift in [[radian]]s, and &lt;math&gt;\omega \ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[angular frequency]] in [[radian]]s per unit time, equal to &lt;math&gt;2 \pi f \ &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; f \ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[frequency]] ([[hertz]] if group delay is measured in seconds).

:'''2.'''  In an [[optical fiber]], the transit [[time]] required for optical [[Power (physics)|power]], traveling at a given [[Transverse mode|mode]]'s [[group velocity]], to travel a given distance.

:''Note:''  For optical fiber [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] measurement purposes, the quantity of interest is group [[Propagation delay|delay]] per unit length, which is the reciprocal of the group velocity of a particular mode. The measured group delay of a [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] through an optical fiber exhibits a [[wavelength]] dependence due to the various [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] mechanisms present in the fiber.

It is often desirable for the group delay to be constant across all frequencies; otherwise there is temporal smearing of the signal.  Because group delay is &lt;math&gt; \tau_g(\omega) = -\frac{d\phi}{d\omega}&lt;/math&gt;, as defined in (1), it therefore follows that a constant group delay can be achieved if the [[transfer function]] of the device or medium has a [[linear]] phase response (i.e., &lt;math&gt;\phi(\omega) = \phi(0) - \tau_g \omega \ &lt;/math&gt; where the group delay &lt;math&gt;\tau_g \ &lt;/math&gt; is a constant).
The degree of nonlinearity of the phase indicates the deviation of the group delay from a constant.

== Group delay in audio ==
Group delay has some importance in the audio field and especially in the sound reproduction field. Many components of an audio reproduction chain, notably [[loudspeakers]] and multiway loudspeaker [[Audio crossover|crossover networks]], introduce group delay in the audio signal. It is therefore important to know the threshold of audibility of group delay with respect to frequency, especially if the audio chain is supposed to provide [[high fidelity]] reproduction. The best thresholds of audibility table has been provided by {{Harvtxt|Blauert|Laws|1978}}.

{| class="wikitable"
! Frequency !! Threshold !! Periods (Cycles)
|-
| 500 [[hertz|Hz]] || 3.2 [[millisecond|ms]] || 1.6
|-
| 1 [[kilohertz|kHz]] || 2 ms || 2
|-
| 2&amp;nbsp;kHz || 1 ms || 2
|-
| 4&amp;nbsp;kHz || 1.5 ms || 6
|-
| 8&amp;nbsp;kHz || 2 ms || 16 
|}

Flanagan, Moore and Stone conclude that at 1, 2 and 4&amp;nbsp;kHz, a group delay of about 1.6 ms is audible with headphones in a non-reverberant condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Flanagan |first1=Sheila |last2=Moore |first2=Brian C.

==True time delay==
A transmitting apparatus is said to have '''true time delay''' ('''TTD''') if the time delay is independent of the [[frequency]] of the electrical signal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=True Time Delay |publisher=Microwaves101, [[IEEE]] |url=http://www.microwaves101.com/microwave-encyclopedia/752-true-time-delay }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Phase Delay and Group Delay |booktitle=Music 320 Background Reader |author=Julius O. Smith III |publisher=Department of Electrical Engineering, [[Stanford University]] |url=http://www.technick.net/public/code/cp_dpage.php?aiocp_dp=guide_dft_phase_delay_group }}&lt;/ref&gt; TTD is an important characteristic of lossless and low-loss, dispersion free, transmission lines. TTD allows for a wide instantaneous signal [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] with virtually no signal distortion such as pulse broadening during pulsed operation.

Much of the information in the image come from a single remote-sensing modevice—[[NASA]]'s Moderate Resolution Imaging [[Spectroradiometer]], or MODIS, flying over 700 km above the Earth on board the [[Terra satellite]] in 2001.]]

The [[prehistory of the Americas]] ([[North America|North]], [[South America|South]], and [[Central America]], and the [[Caribbean]]) begins with people migrating to these areas from Asia during the height of an [[Ice Age]]. These groups are generally believed to have been isolated from peoples of the "[[Old World]]" until the coming of Europeans in the 10th century from Norway and with the [[voyages of Christopher Columbus]] in 1492.

The ancestors of today's [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indigenous peoples]] were the [[Paleo-Indians]]; they were [[hunter-gatherer]]s who migrated into North America. The most popular theory asserts that migrants came to the [[Americas]] via [[Beringia]], the land mass now covered by the ocean waters of the [[Bering Strait]]. Small [[lithic stage]] peoples followed [[megafauna]] like bison, mammoth (now extinct), and caribou, thus gaining the modern nickname "big-game hunters." Groups of people may also have traveled into North America on shelf or sheet ice along the northern Pacific coast.

Cultural traits brought by the first immigrants later evolved and spawned such cultures as [[Iroquois]] on North America and [[Pirahã people|Pirahã]] of South America. These cultures later developed into [[civilization]]s. In many cases, these cultures expanded at a later date than their Old World counterparts. Cultures that may be considered{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} advanced or civilized include [[Norte Chico civilization|Norte Chico]], [[Cahokia]], [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]], [[Toltec]], [[Olmec]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Aztec]], [[Chimor]], [[Mixtec]], [[Moche (culture)|Moche]], [[Mississippian culture|Mississippian]], [[Puebloan]], [[Totonac]], [[Teotihuacan]], [[Huastec people]], [[Purépecha people|Purépecha]], [[Izapa]], [[Mazatec people|Mazatec]], [[Muisca people|Muisca]], and the [[Inca]].{{Human history}}After the [[voyages of Christopher Columbus]] in 1492, [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]], [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] and later [[British Empire|English]], [[French Colonial Empire|French]] and [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] colonial expeditions arrived in the New World, conquering and settling the discovered lands, which led to a transformation of the cultural and physical landscape in the Americas. Spain colonized most of the Americas from present-day [[Southwestern United States]], [[Florida]] and the [[Caribbean]] to the southern tip of South America. Portugal settled in what is mostly present-day [[Brazil]] while England established colonies on the [[Thirteen Colonies|Eastern coast of the United States]], as well as the [[Northwestern United States|North Pacific coast]] and in most of [[Canada]]. France settled in [[Quebec]] and other parts of Eastern [[Canada]] and claimed an area in what is today the central United States. The Netherlands settled New Netherland (administrative centre New Amsterdam - now New York), some Caribbean islands and parts of Northern South America.

European colonization of the Americas led to the rise of new cultures, civilizations and eventually states, which resulted from the fusion of Native American and European traditions, peoples and institutions. The transformation of American cultures through colonization is evident in architecture, religion, gastronomy, the arts and particularly languages, the most widespread being [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (376 million speakers), [[English language|English]] (348 million) and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (201 million). The colonial period lasted approximately three centuries, from the early 16th to the early 19th centuries, when [[Brazil]] and the larger [[Hispanic America]]n nations declared independence. The [[United States]] obtained independence from England much earlier, in 1776, while Canada formed a federal dominion in 1867. Others remained attached to their European parent state until the end of the 19th century, such as [[Cuba]] and [[Puerto Rico]] which were linked to Spain until 1898. Smaller territories such as [[Guyana]] obtained independence in the mid-20th century, while certain Caribbean islands and [[French Guiana]] remain part of a European power to this day.

New studies shed light on the founding population of indigenous Americans, suggesting that their ancestry traced to both east Asian and western Eurasians who migrated to North America directly from Siberia. A 2013 study in the journal [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] reported that DNA found in the 24,000-year-old remains of a young boy in Mal’ta Siberia suggest that up to one-third of the indigenous Americans may have ancestry that can be traced back to western Eurasians, who may have "had a more north-easterly distribution 24,000 years ago than commonly thought"&lt;ref name=Raghavan&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1038/nature12736 |last1= Raghavan |first1= Maanasa |author2=Pontus Skoglund, Kelly E.

===Lithic stage (before 8000 BCE)===

The [[Lithic stage]] or ''[[Paleo-Indians|Paleo-Indian period]]'', is the earliest classification term referring to the first stage of human habitation in the Americas, covering the [[Late Pleistocene]] epoch. The time period derives its name from the appearance of "[[Lithic flake]]d" stone tools. [[Stone tool]]s, particularly [[projectile point]]s and [[Scraper (archaeology)|scrapers]], are the primary evidence of the earliest well known human activity in the [[Americas]]. [[Lithic reduction]] stone tools are used by [[archaeologists]] and [[anthropologist]]s to classify cultural periods.

===Archaic stage (8000 BCE – 1000 BCE)===
{{see also|Pre-Columbian era|History of Mesoamerica (Paleo-Indian)}}
Several thousand years after the first migrations, the first complex civilizations arose as hunter-gatherers settled into semi-agricultural communities. Identifiable sedentary settlements began to emerge in the so-called Middle [[Archaic stage|Archaic period]] around 6000 BCE. Particular [[archaeological culture]]s can be identified and easily classified throughout the Archaic period.

In the late Archaic, on the north-central coastal region of Peru, a complex civilization arose which has been termed the [[Norte Chico civilization]], also known as Caral-Supe. It is the oldest known civilization in the Americas and one of the [[Cradle of civilization|five sites]] where civilization originated independently and indigenously in the ancient world, flourishing between the 30th and 18th centuries BC. It pre-dated the Mesoamerican [[Olmec]] civilization by nearly two millennia. It was contemporaneous with the Egypt following the unification of its kingdom under [[Narmer]] and the emergence of the first [[Egyptian hieroglyphics]].

Monumental architecture, including earthwork platform mounds and sunken plazas have been identified as part of the civilization. Archaeological evidence points to the use of textile technology and the worship of common god symbols. Government, possibly in the form of theocracy, is assumed to have been required to manage the region. However, numerous questions remain about its organization. In archaeological nomenclature, the culture was pre-ceramic culture of the pre-Columbian Late Archaic period. It appears to have lacked ceramics and art.

Ongoing scholarly debate persists over the extent to which the flourishing of Norte Chico resulted from its abundant maritime food resources, and the relationship that these resources would suggest between coastal and inland sites.

The role of seafood in the Norte Chico diet has been a subject of scholarly debate. In 1973, examining the Aspero region of Norte Chico, [[Michael E. Moseley]] contended that a maritime subsistence (seafood) economy had been the basis of society and its early flourishing. This theory, later termed "maritime foundation of Andean Civilization" was at odds with the general scholarly consensus that civilization arose as a result of intensive grain-based agriculture, as had been the case in the emergence of civilizations in northeast Africa (Egypt) and southwest Asia (Mesopotamia).

While earlier research pointed to edible domestic plants such as [[Squash (plant)|squash]], [[beans]], [[lucuma]], [[guava]], [[pacay]], and [[camote]] at Caral, publications by Haas and colleagues have added [[avocado]], [[Canna (plant)|achira]], and [[corn]] (Zea Mays) to the list of foods consumed in the region. In 2013, Haas and colleagues reported that maize was a primary component of the diet throughout the period of 3000 to 1800 BC.&lt;ref name=HaasPNAS2013&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Haas | first1= Jonathan | author2= Winifred Creamer, Luis Huamán Mesía, David Goldstein, Karl Reinhard, and Cindy Vergel Rodríguez | year = 2013 | title = Evidence for maize (Zea mays) in the Late Archaic (3000–1800 B.C.) in the Norte Chico region of Peru |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 110 | issue = 13 |pages = 4945–4949 | doi= 10.1073/pnas.1219425110 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1073%2Fpnas.1219425110 |accessdate = 2013-11-20 | publisher = National Academy of Sciences of the United States |quote=New data drawn from coprolites, pollen records, and stone tool residues, combined with 126 radiocarbon dates, demonstrate that maize was widely grown, intensively processed, and constituted a primary component of the diet throughout the period from 3000 to 1800 B.C. | pmid=23440194 | pmc=3612639}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cotton]] was another widespread crop in Norte Chico, essential to the production of fishing nets and textiles. Jonathan Haas noted a mutual dependency, whereby "The prehistoric residents of the Norte Chico needed the fish resources for their protein and the fishermen needed the cotton to make the nets to catch the fish."

In the 2005 book ''[[1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus]]'', journalist Charles C. Mann surveyed the literature at the time, reporting a date "sometime before 3200 BC, and possibly before 3500 BC" as the beginning date for the formation of Norte Chico. He notes that the earliest date securely associated with a city is 3500 BC, at [[Huaricanga]] in the (inland) Fortaleza area.

The Norte Chico civilization began to decline around 1800 BC as more powerful centers appeared to the south and north along its coast, and to the east within the Andes Mountains.

After the decline of the Norte Chico civilization, several large, centralized civilizations developed in the Western Hemisphere: [[Chavín culture|Chavin]], [[Nazca]], [[Moche (culture)|Moche]], [[Huari culture|Huari]], [[Quitus]], [[Cañari]]s, [[Chimu]], [[Pachacamac]], [[Tiahuanaco]], [[Aymara people|Aymara]] and [[Inca]] in the Central [[Andes]] (Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia); [[Muisca people|Muisca]] in Colombia ; [[Taínos]] in Dominican Republic (Hispaniola, Española) and part of Caribbean; and the [[Olmec]]s, [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Toltec]]s, [[Mixtec]]s, [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotecs]], [[Aztec]]s and [[Purépecha people|Purepecha]] in southern North America (Mexico, Guatemala).

The [[Olmec]] civilization was the first Mesoamerican civilization, beginning around 1600-1400 BC and ending around 400 BC. Mesoamerica is considered one of the [[Cradle of civilization|six sites]] around the globe in which civilization developed independently and indigenously. This civilization is considered the mother culture of the Mesoamerican civilizations. The Mesoamerican calendar, numeral system, writing, and much of the Mesoamerican pantheon seem to have begun with the Olmec.

Some elements of agriculture seem to have been practiced in Mesoamerica quite early. The [[Maize#Origin|domestication of maize]] is thought to have begun around 7,500 to 12,000 years ago. The earliest record of lowland maize cultivation dates to around 5100 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scienceblog.com/community/older/2003/I/20035654.html |title=Agriculture's origin may be hidden in 'invisible' clues |publisher=Scienceblog.com |date=2003-02-14 |accessdate=2009-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agriculture continued to be mixed with a hunting-gathering-fishing lifestyle until quite late compared to other regions, but by 2700 BC, Mesoamericans were relying on maize, and living mostly in villages. Temple mounds and classes started to appear. By 1300/ 1200 BC, small centres coalesced into the Olmec civilization, which seems to have been a set of city-states, united in religious and commercial concerns. The Olmec cities had ceremonial complexes with earth/clay pyramids, palaces, stone monuments, aqueducts and walled plazas. The first of these centers was at San Lorenzo (until 900 bc). La Venta was the last great Olmec centre. Olmec artisans sculpted jade and clay figurines of Jaguars and humans. Their iconic giant heads - believed to be of Olmec rulers - stood in every major city.

The Olmec civilization ended in 400 BC, with the defacing and destruction of San Lorenzo and La Venta, two of the major cities. It nevertheless spawned many other states, most notably the Mayan civilization, whose first cities began appearing around 700-600 BC. Olmec influences continued to appear in many later Mesoamerican civilizations.

Cities of the Aztecs, Mayas, and Incas were as large and organized as the largest in the Old World, with an estimated population of 200,000 to 350,000 in [[Tenochtitlan]], the capital of the [[Aztec empire]]. The market established in the city was said to have been the largest ever seen by the [[conquistador]]s when they arrived. The capital of the Cahokians, [[Cahokia]], located near modern [[East St. Louis, Illinois]], may have reached a population of over 20,000. At its peak, between the 12th and 13th centuries, Cahokia may have been the most populous city in North America. [[Monk's Mound]], the major ceremonial center of Cahokia, remains the largest earthen construction of the prehistoric New World.

These civilizations developed agriculture as well, breeding [[maize]] (corn) from having ears 2–5&amp;nbsp;cm in length to perhaps 10–15&amp;nbsp;cm in length. [[Potato]]es, [[tomato]]es, [[pumpkin]]s, [[bean]]s, [[avocado]]s, and [[chocolate]] are now the most popular of the pre-Columbian agricultural products. The civilizations did not develop extensive livestock as there were few suitable species, although [[alpaca]]s and [[llama]]s were domesticated for use as beasts of burden and sources of wool and meat in the [[Andes]]. By the 15th century, maize was being farmed in the [[Mississippi River]] Valley after introduction from [[Mexico]]. The course of further agricultural development was greatly altered by the arrival of [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]].

The [[Iroquois|Iroquois League of Nations]] or "People of the Long House", based in present-day upstate and western [[New York (state)|New York]], had a [[Confederation|confederacy]] model from the mid-15th&amp;nbsp;century.  It has been suggested that their culture contributed to political thinking during the development of the later United States government. Their system of affiliation was a kind of federation, different from the strong, centralized European monarchies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=33 questions about American history you're not supposed to ask |first=Thomas E |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dCMcnBRKR-0C&amp;pg=PA62 |last= Woods |page=62|publisher=Crown Forum |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-307-34668-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wright |first=R |year=2005 |title=Stolen Continents: 500 Years of Conquest and Resistance in the Americas |publisher=Mariner Books |isbn=0-618-49240-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tooker"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Clifton JA |title=The Invented Indian: Cultural Fictions and Government Policies |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ARbVmr941TsC&amp;pg=PA107|publisher=Transaction Publishers |location=New Brunswick, N.J. |year=1990 |pages=107–128 |chapter=The United States Constitution and the Iroquois League |isbn=1-56000-745-1|author=Tooker E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leadership was restricted to a group of 50 [[sachem]] [[Tribal chief|chief]]s, each representing one [[clan]] within a tribe; the [[Oneida people|Oneida]] and [[Mohawk people]] had nine seats each; the [[Onondaga people|Onondagas]] held fourteen; the [[Cayuga nation|Cayuga]] had ten seats; and the [[Seneca nation|Seneca]] had eight. Representation was not based on population numbers, as the Seneca tribe greatly outnumbered the others. When a sachem chief died, his successor was chosen by the senior woman of his tribe in consultation with other female members of the clan; property and hereditary leadership were passed [[matrilineality|matrilineally]]. Decisions were not made through voting but through consensus decision making, with each sachem chief holding theoretical [[Veto|veto power]]. The Onondaga were the "[[firekeeper]]s", responsible for raising topics to be discussed. They occupied one side of a three-sided fire (the Mohawk and Seneca sat on one side of the fire, the Oneida and Cayuga sat on the third side.)&lt;ref name="Tooker"/&gt;

Elizabeth Tooker, an [[anthropologist]], has said that it was unlikely the US founding fathers were inspired by the confederacy, as it bears little resemblance to the system of governance adopted in the United States. For example, it is based on inherited rather than elected leadership, selected by female members of the tribes, consensus decision-making regardless of population size of the tribes, and a single group capable of bringing matters before the legislative body.&lt;ref name="Tooker"/&gt;

Long-distance trading did not prevent warfare and displacement among the indigenous peoples, and their oral histories tell of numerous migrations to the historic territories where Europeans encountered them. The Iroquois invaded and attacked tribes in the Ohio River area of present-day Kentucky and claimed the hunting grounds. Historians have placed these events as occurring as early as the 13th&amp;nbsp;century, or in the 17th&amp;nbsp;century [[Beaver Wars]].&lt;ref name="Burns"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/O/OS001.html |title=Osage |publisher=Oklahoma Encyclopedia of History and Culture |accessdate=2010-11-29 |last=Burns |first=LF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102050914/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/O/OS001.html |archivedate=2011-01-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through warfare, the Iroquois drove several tribes to migrate west to what became known as their historically traditional lands west of the Mississippi River. Tribes originating in the Ohio Valley who moved west included the [[Osage Nation|Osage]], [[Kaw people|Kaw]], [[Ponca]] and [[Omaha people]]. By the mid-17th century, they had resettled in their historical lands in present-day [[Kansas]], [[Nebraska]], [[Arkansas]] and [[Oklahoma]]. The Osage warred with [[Caddo]]-speaking Native Americans, displacing them in turn by the mid-18th century and dominating their new historical territories.&lt;ref name="Burns"/&gt;

The [[Toltec]] were a nomadic people, dating from the 10th - 12th century, whose language was also spoken by the Aztecs.

;Teotihuacan
[[Teotihuacan]] (4th century BCE - 7/8th century CE) was both a city, and an empire of the same name, which, at its zenith between 150 and the 5th century, covered most of Mesoamerica.

;Aztec
The [[Aztec]] having started to build their empire around 14th century found their civilization abruptly ended by the Spanish conquistadors. They lived in Mesoamerica, and surrounding lands. Their capital city Tenochtitlan was one of the largest cities of all time.

;Norte Chico
The oldest known civilization of the Americas was established in the [[Norte Chico (Peruvian region)|Norte Chico]] region of modern Peru. Complex society emerged in the group of coastal valleys, between 3000 and 1800 BCE. The [[Quipu]], a distinctive recording device among Andean civilizations, apparently dates from the era of Norte Chico's prominence.

;Chavín
The [[Chavín]] established a trade network and developed agriculture by as early as (or late compared to the Old World) 900 BCE according to some estimates and archaeological finds. Artifacts were found at a site called Chavín in modern [[Peru]] at an elevation of 3,177 meters. Chavín civilization spanned from 900 BCE to 300 BCE.

;[[Inca]]
Holding their capital at the great city of [[Cusco]], the [[Inca civilization]] dominated the Andes region from 1438 to 1533.
Known as ''Tahuantinsuyu'', or "the land of the four regions", in [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], the Inca culture was highly distinct and developed. Cities were built with precise, unmatched stonework, constructed over many levels of mountain terrain. [[Terrace farming]] was a useful form of agriculture. There is evidence of excellent metalwork and even successful [[Trepanning|trepanation]] of the skull in Inca civilization.

Around 1000, the [[Vikings]] established a short-lived settlement in [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], now known as [[L'Anse aux Meadows]]. Speculations exist about other Old World discoveries of the New World, but none of these are generally or completely accepted by most scholars.

Spain sponsored a major exploration led by Italian explorer [[Christopher Columbus]] in 1492; it quickly led to extensive [[European colonization of the Americas]]. The Europeans brought Old World diseases which are thought to have caused catastrophic epidemics and a huge decrease of the native population. Columbus came at a time in which many technical developments in sailing techniques and communication made it possible to report his voyages easily and to spread word of them throughout Europe. It was also a time of growing religious, imperial and economic rivalries that led to a competition for the establishment of colonies.

===Colonial period===
{{see also|Colonial history of the United States|Former colonies and territories in Canada}}
15th to 19th century colonies in the New World:
*[[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] (1492)
*[[Viceroyalty of New Spain]] (1535 to 1821)
*[[Viceroyalty of Peru]] (1542–1824)
*[[Spanish Main]]
*[[Spanish West Indies]]
*[[Captaincy General of Guatemala]]
*[[British America]] / [[Thirteen Colonies]] (1497/1584/1607 to 1776/20th century)
*[[Danish West Indies]]
*[[New Netherland]]
*[[New France]]
*[[Captaincy General of Venezuela]]
*[[Portuguese colonization of the Americas]] (1499 to 1822)
*[[Colonial Brazil]] (1500 to 1815)

===Decolonization===
{{details|Decolonization of the Americas}}
The formation of sovereign states in the New World began with the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] of 1776. The [[American Revolutionary War]] lasted through the period of the [[Siege of Yorktown]] — its last major campaign — in the early autumn of 1781, with peace being achieved [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|in 1783]].
 
The Spanish colonies won their independence in the first quarter of the 19th century, in the [[Spanish American wars of independence]]. [[Simón Bolívar]] and [[José de San Martín]], among others, led their independence struggle. Although Bolivar attempted to keep the Spanish-speaking parts of Latin America politically allied, they rapidly became independent of one another as well, and several further wars were fought, such as the [[Paraguayan War]] and the [[War of the Pacific]]. (See [[Latin American integration]].) In the Portuguese colony [[Pedro I of Brazil|Dom Pedro I]] (also Pedro IV of Portugal), son of the Portuguese [[monarch|king]] [[Dom João VI]], proclaimed the country's independence in 1822 and became Brazil's first [[Emperor]]. This was peacefully accepted by the crown in Portugal, upon compensation.

===Effects of slavery===
{{further|Slavery in the Spanish New World colonies|Slavery in the British and French Caribbean|History of slavery in Brazil |Slavery in Canada|History of slavery in the United States}}
Slavery has had a significant role in the economic development of the [[New World]] after the colonization of the Americas by the Europeans. The [[cotton]], [[tobacco]], and [[sugar cane]] harvested by slaves became important exports for the United States and the Caribbean countries.

[[File:New Names Canadian WW1 recruiting poster.jpg|thumb|A Canadian World War I recruiting poster - (1914–1918)]]

As a part of the [[British Empire]], Canada immediately entered World War I when it broke out in 1914. Canada bore the brunt of several major battles during the early stages of the war, including the use of [[Poison gas in World War I|poison gas]] attacks at [[Second Battle of Ypres|Ypres]]. Losses became grave, and the government eventually brought in [[conscription]], despite the fact this was against the wishes of the majority of [[French Canadians]]. In the ensuing [[Conscription Crisis of 1917]], riots broke out on the streets of [[Montreal]]. In neighboring Newfoundland, the new dominion suffered a devastating loss on July 1, 1916, the [[First day on the Somme]].

The United States stayed out of the conflict [[American entry into World War I|until 1917]], when it joined the Entente powers. The United States was then able to play a crucial role at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference of 1919]] that shaped [[interwar]] Europe. Mexico was not part of the war, as the country was embroiled in the Mexican Revolution at the time.

{{further|Roaring Twenties|Great Depression|Cristero War}}

The 1920s brought an age of great prosperity in the United States, and to a lesser degree Canada. But the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] combined with [[dust bowl|drought]] ushered in a period of economic hardship in the United States and [[Great Depression in Canada|Canada]]. From 1936 to 1949, there was a popular uprising against the anti-Catholic Mexican government of the time, set off specifically by the anti-clerical provisions of the [[Mexican Constitution of 1917]].

{{further|Military history of Canada during World War II|Military history of the United States during World War II|United States home front during World War II|SS Potrero del Llano|Faja de Oro|Escuadrón 201}}

Once again, Canada found itself at war before its neighbors, however even Canadian contributions were slight before the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. The entry of the United States into the war helped to tip the balance in favour of the [[Allies of World War II|allies]]. Two Mexican tankers, transporting oil to the United States, were attacked and sunk by the Germans in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] waters, in 1942. The incident happened in spite of Mexico's neutrality at that time. This led Mexico to enter the conflict with a declaration of war on the Axis nations. The destruction of Europe wrought by the war vaulted all North American countries to more important roles in world affairs, especially the United States, which emerged as a "[[superpower]]".

{{further|History of the United States (1945–64)|History of Canada (1945–60)|Civil rights movement}}

The early Cold War era saw the United States as the most powerful nation in a Western coalition of which Mexico and Canada were also a part. In Canada, Quebec was transformed by the [[Quiet Revolution]] and the emergence of [[Quebec nationalism]]. Mexico experienced an era of huge economic growth after World War II, a heavy industrialization process and a growth of its middle class, a period known in Mexican history as ''"El Milagro Mexicano"'' (the Mexican miracle). The Caribbean saw the beginnings of [[decolonization]], while on the largest island the [[Cuban Revolution]] introduced Cold War rivalries into Latin America.

{{further|History of the United States (1964–80)|History of Canada (1960–81)}}

The [[civil rights movement]] in the U.S. ended [[Jim Crow]] and empowered black voters in the 1960s, which allowed black citizens to move into high government offices for the first time since Reconstruction. However, the dominant [[New Deal coalition]] collapsed in the mid 1960s in disputes over race and the [[Vietnam War]], and the conservative movement began its rise to power, as [[Modern liberalism in the United States|the once dominant liberalism weakened and collapsed]]. Canada during this era was dominated by the leadership of [[Pierre Elliot Trudeau]]. In 1982, at the end of his tenure, Canada enshrined a new constitution.

{{further|History of the United States (1980–91)|History of Canada (1982–92)}}

Canada's [[Brian Mulroney]] not only ran on a similar platform but also favored closer trade ties with the United States. This led to the [[Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement]] in January 1989. Mexican presidents [[Miguel de la Madrid]], in the early 1980s and [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari]] in the late 1980s, started implementing liberal economic strategies that were seen as a good move. However, Mexico experienced a strong economic recession in 1982 and the Mexican peso suffered a devaluation. In the United States president [[Ronald Reagan]] attempted to move the United States back towards a hard anti-communist line in foreign affairs, in what his supporters saw as an attempt to assert moral leadership (compared to the Soviet Union) in the world community. Domestically, Reagan attempted to bring in a package of [[privatization]] and [[regulation]] to stimulate the economy.

{{further|History of the United States (1991–present)|History of Canada (1992–present)}}

The end of the Cold War and the beginning of the era of sustained economic expansion coincided during the 1990s. On January 1, 1994, Canada, Mexico and the United States signed the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]], creating the world's largest free trade area. In 2000, [[Vicente Fox]] became the first non-[[Partido Revolucionario Institucional|PRI]] candidate to win the Mexican presidency in over 70 years. The optimism of the 1990s was shattered by the [[9/11]] attacks of 2001 on the United States, which prompted military intervention in [[Afghanistan]], which also involved Canada. Canada did not support the United States' later move to [[Iraq War|invade Iraq]], however.

In the U.S. the [[Reagan Era]] of conservative national policies, deregulation and tax cuts took control with the election of [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1980. By 2010, political scientists were debating whether the election of [[Barack Obama]] in 2008 represented an end of the Reagan Era, or was only a reaction against the bubble economy of the 2000s (decade), which burst in 2008 and became the [[Late-2000s recession]] with prolonged unemployment.

{{see also|History of Belize|History of Costa Rica|History of El Salvador|History of Guatemala|History of Honduras|History of Nicaragua|History of Panama}}
Despite the failure of a lasting political union, the concept of Central American reunification, though lacking enthusiasm from the leaders of the individual countries, rises from time to time. In 1856&amp;ndash;1857 the region successfully established a military coalition to repel an invasion by United States adventurer [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker]]. Today, all five nations fly [[flag]]s that retain the old federal motif of two outer blue bands bounding an inner white stripe. (Costa Rica, traditionally the least committed of the five to regional integration, modified its flag significantly in 1848 by darkening the blue and adding a double-wide inner red band, in honor of the French tricolor).

In 1907, a [[Central American Court of Justice]] was created. On December 13, 1960, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua established the [[Central American Common Market]] ("CACM"). Costa Rica, because of its relative economic prosperity and political stability, chose not to participate in the CACM. The goals for the CACM were to create greater political unification and success of [[import substitution industrialization]] policies. The project was an immediate economic success, but was abandoned after the 1969 "[[Football War]]" between El Salvador and Honduras. A [[Central American Parliament]] has operated, as a purely advisory body, since 1991. Costa Rica has repeatedly declined invitations to join the regional parliament, which seats deputies from the four other former members of the Union, as well as from [[Panama]] and the [[Dominican Republic]].

===South America===
{{see also|History of South America}}
In the 1960s and 1970s, the governments of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay were overthrown or displaced by U.S.-aligned military dictatorships. These dictatorships detained tens of thousands of [[political prisoner]]s, many of whom were tortured and/or killed (on inter-state collaboration, see [[Operation Condor]]). Economically, they began a transition to [[neoliberal]] economic policies. They placed their own actions within the United States [[Cold War]] doctrine of "National Security" against internal subversion. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Peru suffered from an [[Internal conflict in Peru|internal conflict]] (see [[Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement]] and [[Shining Path]]). Revolutionary movements and right-wing military dictatorships have been common, but starting in the 1980s a wave of democratization came through the continent, and democratic rule is widespread now. Allegations of corruption remain common, and several nations have seen crises which have forced the resignation of their presidents, although normal civilian succession has continued.

[[Developing countries' debt|International indebtedness]] became a notable problem, as most recently illustrated by [[Argentina]]'s [[Argentine economic crisis (1999&amp;ndash;2002)|default]] in the early 21st century. In recent years, South American governments have drifted to the left, with [[socialist]] leaders being elected in Chile, [[Bolivia]], Brazil, [[Venezuela]], and a leftist president in Argentina and [[Uruguay]]. Despite the move to the left, South America is still largely capitalist. With the founding of the [[Union of South American Nations]], South America has started down the road of economic integration, with plans for political integration in the [[European Union]] style.

[[File:Icecore 4.jpg|thumb|Ice core sample taken from drill. Photo by [[Lonnie Thompson]], [[Byrd Polar Research Center]]|alt=An ice core being slid out of a drill barrel sideways]]
An '''ice core''' is a [[core sample]] that is typically removed from an [[ice sheet]] or a high mountain [[glacier]].  Since the ice forms from the incremental buildup of annual layers of snow, lower layers are older than upper, and an ice core contains ice formed over a range of years.  Cores are [[Ice drilling|drilled]] with hand [[Auger (drill)|augers]] (for shallow holes) or powered drills; they can reach depths of over two miles (3.2&amp;nbsp;km), and contain ice up to 800,000 years old.

The physical properties of the ice and of material trapped in it can be used to reconstruct the climate over the age range of the core.  The proportions of different oxygen and hydrogen [[isotope]]s provide information about [[Paleothermometer|ancient temperatures]], and the air trapped in tiny bubbles can be analysed to determine the level of atmospheric gases such as [[carbon dioxide]].  Since [[Heat transfer|heat flow]] in a large ice sheet is very slow, the borehole temperature is another indicator of temperature in the past.  These data can be combined to find the [[climate model]] that best fits all the available data.

Impurities in ice cores may depend on location.  Coastal areas are more likely to include material of marine origin, such as sea salt [[ion]]s.  [[Greenland]] ice cores contain layers of [[Loess|wind-blown dust]] that correlate with cold, dry periods in the past, when cold deserts were scoured by wind.  [[Radioactivity|Radioactive]] elements, either of natural origin or created by [[Nuclear weapons testing|nuclear testing]], can be used to date the layers of ice.  Some volcanic events that were sufficiently powerful to send material around the globe have left a signature in many different cores that can be used to synchronise their time scales.

Ice cores have been studied since the early 20th century, and several cores were drilled as a result of the [[International Geophysical Year]] (1957–1958).  Depths of over 400 m were reached, a record which was extended in the 1960s to 2164 m at [[Byrd Station]] in Antarctica.  [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] ice drilling projects in Antarctica include decades of work at [[Vostok Station]], with the deepest core reaching 3769 m.  Numerous other deep cores in the Antarctic have been completed over the years, including the [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]] project, and cores managed by the [[British Antarctic Survey]] and the [[ITASE|International Trans-Antarctic Scientific Expedition]].  In Greenland, a sequence of collaborative projects began in the 1970s with the [[Greenland Ice Sheet Project]]; there have been multiple follow-up projects, with the most recent, the [[East Greenland Ice-Core Project]], expected to complete a deep core in east Greenland in 2020.

[[File:Taku glacier firn ice sampling.png|thumb|Sampling the surface of [[Taku Glacier]] in Alaska.  There is increasingly dense [[firn]] between surface snow and blue glacier ice.|alt=A scientist in a pit of snow]]

An ice core is a vertical column through a glacier, sampling the layers that formed through an annual cycle of snowfall and melt.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; As snow accumulates, each layer presses on lower layers, making them denser until they turn into [[firn]]. Firn is not dense enough to prevent air from escaping; but at a density of about 830&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; it turns to ice, and the air within is sealed into bubbles that capture the composition of the atmosphere at the time the ice formed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The depth at which this occurs varies with location, but in Greenland and the Antarctic it ranges from 64&amp;nbsp;m to 115&amp;nbsp;m.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{harvnb|Talalay|2016}}, p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the rate of snowfall varies from site to site, the age of the firn when it turns to ice varies a great deal. At [[Summit Camp]] in Greenland, the depth is 77 m and the ice is 230 years old; at [[Dome C]] in Antarctica the depth is 95 m and the age 2500 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Paleoclimatology: Reconstructing Climates of the Quaternary|last=Bradley|first=Raymond S.|publisher=Academic Press|year=2015|isbn=978-0-12-386913-5|location=Amsterdam|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; As further layers build up, the pressure increases, and at about 1500&amp;nbsp;m the [[crystal structure]] of the ice changes from hexagonal to cubic, allowing air molecules to move into the cubic crystals and form a [[clathrate]]. The bubbles disappear and the ice becomes more transparent.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{harvnb|Alley|2000}}, pp. 48–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two or three feet of snow may turn into less than a foot of ice.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The weight above makes deeper layers of ice thin and flow outwards. Ice is lost at the edges of the glacier to [[icebergs]], or to summer melting, and the overall shape of the glacier does not change much with time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alley|2000}}, pp. 35-36.&lt;/ref&gt; The outward flow can distort the layers, so it is desirable to drill deep ice cores at places where there is very little flow. These can be located using maps of the flow lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Glaciers|last=Knight|first=Peter G.|publisher=Stanley Thornes|year=1999|isbn=0-7487-4000-7|location=Cheltenham, UK|page=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Impurities in the ice provide information on the environment from when they were deposited. These include soot, ash, and other types of particle from [[Wildfire|forest fires]] and [[volcano]]es; isotopes such as [[beryllium-10]] created by [[cosmic ray]]s;
[[micrometeorite]]s; and [[pollen]].&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{harvnb|Alley|2000}}, pp. 71–73.&lt;/ref&gt;  The lowest layer of a glacier, called basal ice, is frequently formed of subglacial meltwater that has refrozen. It can be up to about 20 m thick, and though it has scientific value (for example, it may contain subglacial microbial populations),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report|url=https://websites.pmc.ucsc.edu/~tulaczyk/Report_I_V.pdf|title=FASTDRILL: Interdisciplinary Polar Research Based on Fast Ice-Sheet Drilling|last1=Tulaczyk|first1=S. |last2=Elliot|first2=D. |last3=Vogel|first3=S.W. |last4=Powell|first4=R.D. |last5=Priscu|first5=J.C. |last6=Clow|first6=G.D. |year=2002|publisher=2002 FASTDRILL Workshop|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; it often does not retain stratigraphic information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Environmental Contaminants: Using Natural Archives to Track Sources and Long-Term Trends of Pollution|last=Gabrielli|first=Paolo|last2=Vallelonga|first2=Paul|publisher=Springer|year=2015|isbn=978-94-017-9540-1|editor-last=Blais|editor-first=Jules M.|location=Dordrecht, Netherlands|page=395|pages=|chapter=Contaminant Records in Ice Cores|display-editors=et al.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cores are often drilled in areas such as Antarctica and central Greenland where the temperature is almost never warm enough to cause melting, but the summer sun can still alter the snow. In polar areas, the sun is visible day and night during the local summer and invisible all winter. It can make some snow [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimate]], leaving the top inch or so less dense. When the sun approaches its lowest point in the sky, the temperature drops and [[hoar frost]] forms on the top layer. Buried under the snow of following years, the coarse-grained hoar frost compresses into lighter layers than the winter snow. As a result, alternating bands of lighter and darker ice can be seen in an ice core.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alley|2000}}, pp. 43–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Brooks ice auger patent drawings 1932-retouched.png|alt=Drawing of a cylinder with two helical flanges around it and cutting teeth at the bottom|left|thumb|Ice auger patented in 1932; the design is very similar to modern augers used for shallow drilling.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{harvnb|Talalay|2016}}, pp. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Ice cores are collected by cutting around a cylinder of ice in a way that enables it to be brought to the surface.  Early cores were often collected with hand [[Auger (drill)|augers]] and they are still used for short holes. A design for ice core augers was patented in 1932 and they have changed little since.  An auger is essentially a cylinder with [[helix|helical]] metal ribs (known as flights) wrapped around the outside, at the lower end of which are cutting blades.  Hand augers can be rotated by a [[T-handle|T handle]] or a [[Brace (tool)|brace handle]], and some can be attached to handheld [[electric drill]]s to power the rotation.  With the aid of a [[tripod]] for lowering and raising the auger, cores up to 50&amp;nbsp;m deep can be retrieved, but the practical limit is about 30&amp;nbsp;m for engine-powered augers, and less for hand augers.  Below this depth, electromechanical or thermal drills are used.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The cutting apparatus of a drill is on the bottom end of a drill barrel, the tube that surrounds the core as the drill cuts downward.  The [[Drill cuttings|cuttings]] (chips of ice cut away by the drill) must be drawn up the hole and disposed of or they will reduce the cutting efficiency of the drill.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{harvnb|Talalay|2016}}, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;  They can be removed by compacting them into the walls of the hole or into the core, by air circulation (dry drilling),&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Talalay 2016"&gt;{{harvnb|Talalay|2016}}, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; or by the use of a [[drilling fluid]] (wet drilling).&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{harvnb|Talalay|2016}}, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;  Dry drilling is limited to about 400&amp;nbsp;m depth, since below that point a hole would close up as the ice deforms from the weight of the ice above.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iceandclimate.nbi.ku.dk/research/drill_analysing/drilling_techniques/deep_drilling/|title=Deep drilling with the Hans Tausen drill|last=|first=|date=2 October 2008|website=|publisher=Niels Bohr Institute Centre for Ice and Climate|language=en|access-date=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drilling fluids are chosen to balance the pressure so that the hole remains stable.&lt;ref name="Talalay 2016"/&gt;  The fluid must have a low kinematic [[viscosity]] to reduce [[Tripping (pipe)|tripping]] time (the time taken to pull the drilling equipment out of the hole and return it to the bottom of the hole).  Since retrieval of each segment of core requires tripping, a slower speed of travel through the drilling fluid could add significant time to a project—a year or more for a deep hole.  The fluid must contaminate the ice as little as possible; it must have low [[toxicity]], for safety and to minimize the effect on the environment; it must be available at a reasonable cost; and it must be relatively easy to transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sheldon|first1=Simon G.|last2=Popp|first2=Trevor J.|last3=Hansen|first3=Steffen B.|last4=Steffensen|first4=Jørgen P.|title=Promising new borehole liquids for ice-core drilling on the East Antarctic high plateau|journal=Annals of Glaciology|date=26 July 2017|volume=55|issue=68|pages=260–270|doi=10.3189/2014AoG68A043}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Historically, there have been three main types of ice drilling fluids: two-component fluids based on [[kerosene]]-like products mixed with [[fluorocarbon]]s to increase density; alcohol compounds, including aqueous [[ethylene glycol]] and [[ethanol]] solutions; and [[ester]]s, including [[N-Butyl acetate|n-butyl acetate]].  Newer fluids have been proposed, including new ester-based fluids, low-molecular weight [[Dimethylsiloxane|dimethyl siloxane]] oils, [[Fatty acid ester|fatty-acid esters]], and kerosene-based fluids mixed with foam-expansion agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Talalay|2016}}, pp. 259–263.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rotary drilling is the main method of drilling for minerals and it has also been used for ice drilling. It uses a [[Drill string|string of drill pipe]] rotated from the top, and drilling fluid is pumped down through the pipe and back up around it.  The cuttings are removed from the fluid at the top of the hole and the fluid is then pumped back down.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  This approach requires long trip times, since the entire drill string must be hoisted out of the hole, and each length of pipe must be separately disconnected, and then reconnected when the drill string is reinserted.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{harvnb|Talalay|2016}}, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;  Along with the logistical difficulties associated with bringing heavy equipment to ice sheets, this makes traditional rotary drills unattractive.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  In contrast, [[Wireline (cabling)|wireline]] drills allow the removal of the core barrel from the drill assembly while it is still at the bottom of the borehole.  The core barrel is hoisted to the surface, and the core removed; the barrel is lowered again and reconnected to the drill assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Talalay|2016}}, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another alternative is flexible drill-stem rigs, in which the [[drill string]] is flexible enough to be coiled when at the surface.  This eliminates the need to disconnect and reconnect the pipes during a trip.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;[[File:Drilling mechanical-drill-head.jpg|thumb|Mechanical drill head, showing cutting teeth|alt=The bottom of an ice drill]]The need for a string of drillpipe that extends from the surface to the bottom of the borehole can be eliminated by suspending the entire downhole assembly on an armoured cable that conveys power to the downhole motor.  These cable-suspended drills can be used for both shallow and deep holes; they require an anti-torque device, such as [[Leaf spring|leaf-springs]] that press against the borehole, to prevent the drill assembly rotating around the drillhead as it cuts the core.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Talalay|2016}}, pp. 109–111.&lt;/ref&gt;  The drilling fluid is usually circulated down around the outside of the drill and back up between the core and core barrel; the cuttings are stored in the downhole assembly, in a chamber above the core.  When the core is retrieved, the cuttings chamber is emptied for the next run.  Some drills have been designed to retrieve a second annular core outside the central core, and in these drills the space between the two cores can be used for circulation.  Cable-suspended drills have proved to be the most reliable design for deep ice drilling.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Talalay|2016}}, pp. 173–175.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Talalay|2016}}, pp. 252–254.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thermal drills, which cut ice by electrically heating the drill head, can also be used, but they have some disadvantages.  Some have been designed for working in cold ice; they have high power consumption and the heat they produce can degrade the quality of the retrieved ice core.  Early thermal drills, designed for use without drilling fluid, were limited in depth as a result; later versions were modified to work in fluid-filled holes but this slowed down trip times, and these drills retained the problems of the earlier models.  In addition, thermal drills are typically bulky and can be impractical to use in areas where there are logistical difficulties.  More recent modifications include the use of [[antifreeze]], which eliminates the need for heating the drill assembly and hence reduces the power needs of the drill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zagorodnov|first1=V.|last2=Thompson|first2=L.G.|title=Thermal electric ice-core drills: history and new design options for intermediate-depth drilling|journal=Annals of Glaciology|date=26 July 2017|volume=55|issue=68|pages=322–330|doi=10.3189/2014AoG68A012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hot-water drills use jets of hot water at the drill head to melt the water around the core. The drawbacks are that it is difficult to accurately control the dimensions of the borehole, the core cannot easily be kept sterile, and the heat may cause [[thermal shock]] to the core.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Exploration of Antarctic Subglacial Aquatic Environments: Environmental and Scientific Stewardship|last=National Research Council of the National Academies|publisher=National Academies Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-309-10635-1|location=Washington DC|pages=82–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When drilling in temperate ice, thermal drills have an advantage over electromechanical (EM) drills: ice melted by pressure can refreeze on EM drill bits, reducing cutting efficiency, and can clog other parts of the mechanism.  EM drills are also more likely to fracture ice cores where the ice is under high stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schwikowski|first1=Margit|last2=Jenk|first2=Theo M.|last3=Stampfli|first3=Dieter|last4=Stampfli|first4=Felix|title=A new thermal drilling system for high-altitude or temperate glaciers|journal=Annals of Glaciology|date=26 July 2017|volume=55|issue=68|pages=131–136|doi=10.3189/2014AoG68A024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When drilling deep holes, which require drilling fluid, the hole must be [[Casing (borehole)|cased]] (fitted with a cylindrical lining), since otherwise the drilling fluid will be absorbed by the snow and firn.  The casing has to reach down to the impermeable ice layers.  To install casing a shallow auger can be used to create a pilot hole, which is then [[Reaming|reamed]] (expanded) until it is wide enough to accept the casing; a large diameter auger can also be used, avoiding the need for reaming.  An alternative to casing is to use water in the borehole to saturate the porous snow and firn; the water eventually turns to ice.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Ice cores from different depths are not all equally in demand by scientific investigators, which can lead to a shortage of ice cores at certain depths.  To address this, work has been done on technology to drill replicate cores: additional cores, retrieved by drilling into the sidewall of the borehole, at depths of particular interest.  Replicate cores were successfully retrieved at WAIS divide in the 2012-2013 drilling season, at four different depths.&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous (30 June 2017), Ice Drilling Design and Operations: Long Range Technology Plan, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Large coring projects ===
The logistics of any coring project are complex because the locations are usually difficult to reach, and may be at high altitude.  The largest projects require years of planning and years to execute, and are usually run as international consortiums.  The [[East Greenland Ice-Core Project|EastGRIP]] project, for example, which as of 2017 is drilling in eastern Greenland, is run by the [[Centre for Ice and Climate]], in [[Denmark]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eastgrip.org/|title=EastGrip – The East Greenland Ice-core Project|last=Petersen|first=Sandra|date=23 February 2016|website=East Greenland Ice Core Project|language=en|access-date=17 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and includes representatives from 12 countries on its steering committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eastgrip.org/partners/|title=Partners|last=Madsen|first=Martin Vindbæk|date=14 April 2016|website=East Greenland Ice Core Project|language=en|access-date=17 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the course of a drilling season, scores of people work at the camp,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dahl-Jensen|Kirk|Larsen|Sheldon|Steffensen|2016}}, pp. 17–19.&lt;/ref&gt; and logistics support includes airlift capabilities provided by the [[Air National Guard|US Air National Guard]], using [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|Hercules transport planes]] owned by the [[National Science Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eastgrip.org/about/|title=About EastGRIP|last=Petersen|first=Sandra|date=23 February 2016|website=East Greenland Ice Core Project|language=en|access-date=17 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015 the EastGRIP team moved the camp facilities from [[North Greenland Eemian Ice Drilling|NEEM]], a previous Greenland ice core drilling site, to the EastGRIP site.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dahl-Jensen|Kirk|Larsen|Sheldon|Steffensen|2016}}, pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt;  Drilling is expected to continue until at least 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/10/24/greenland-is-melting|title=When a Country Melts|last=Kolbert|first=Elizabeth|date=24 October 2016|website=The New Yorker|access-date=17 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Core processing ==
[[File:Gripsaw.jpg|thumb|Sawing the [[Greenland ice core project|GRIP]] core|alt=Scientist standing at a bench, sawing an ice core]]

With some variation between projects, the following steps must occur between drilling and final storage of the ice core.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://icecores.org/icecores/drilling.shtml|title=About Ice Cores :: Drilling Ice Cores|last=UNH|first=Joe Souney|publisher=National Ice Core Laboratory|language=en|access-date=21 May 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170504192232/http://icecores.org/icecores/drilling.shtml|archivedate=4 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The drill removes an annulus of ice around the core but does not cut under it. A spring-loaded lever arm called a core dog can break off the core and hold it in place while it is brought to the surface.  The core is then extracted from the drill barrel, usually by laying it out flat so that the core can slide out onto a prepared surface.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  The core must be cleaned of drilling fluid as it is slid out; for the [[WAIS Divide]] coring project, a vacuuming system was set up to facilitate this.  The surface that receives the core should be aligned as accurately as possible with the drill barrel to minimise mechanical stress on the core, which can easily break.  The ambient temperature is kept well below freezing to avoid thermal shock.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{harvnb|Souney et al.|2014}}, pp. 16–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

A log is kept with information about the core, including its length and the depth it was retrieved from, and the core may be marked to show its orientation.  It is usually cut into shorter sections, the standard length in the US being one metre.   The cores are then stored on site, usually in a space below snow level to simplify temperature maintenance, though additional refrigeration can be used.  If more drilling fluid must be removed, air may be blown over the cores.  Any samples needed for preliminary analysis are taken.  The core is then bagged, often in [[polythene]], and stored for shipment.  Additional packing, including padding material, is added.  When the cores are flown from the drilling site, the aircraft's flight deck is unheated to help maintain a low temperature; when they are transported by ship they must be kept in a refrigeration unit.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

There are several locations around the world that store ice cores, such as the [[National Ice Core Laboratory]] in the US. These locations make samples available for testing.  A substantial fraction of each core is archived for future analyses.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hinkley|first=Todd|date=9 December 2003|title=International ice core community meets to discuss best practices for ice core curation|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2003EO490006/pdf|journal=Eos Trans AGU|volume=84|issue=49|page=549|doi=10.1029/2003EO490006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over a depth range known as the [[brittle ice]] zone, bubbles of air are trapped in the ice under great pressure.  When the core is brought to the surface, the bubbles can exert a stress that exceeds the tensile strength of the ice, resulting in cracks and [[spall]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;  At greater depths, the air disappears into clathrates and the ice becomes stable again.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Uchida|first1=Tsutomu|last2=Duval |first2=P. |last3=Lipenkov |first3=V.Ya. |last4=Hondoh |first4=T. |last5=Mae |first5=S. |last6=Shoji |first6=H.|date=|year=1994|title=Brittle zone and air-hydrate formation in polar ice sheets|url=http://ci.nii.ac.jp/els/contents110000010337.pdf?id=ART0000331825|journal=Memoirs of National Institute of Polar Research|volume=|issue=49|page=302}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the WAIS Divide site, the brittle ice zone was from 520&amp;nbsp;m to 1340&amp;nbsp;m depth.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{harvnb|Souney et al.|2014}}, pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The brittle ice zone typically returns poorer quality samples than for the rest of the core.  Some steps can be taken to alleviate the problem.  Liners can be placed inside the drill barrel to enclose the core before it is brought to the surface, but this makes it difficult to clean off the drilling fluid.  In mineral drilling, special machinery can bring core samples to the surface at bottom-hole pressure, but this is too expensive for the inaccessible locations of most drilling sites.  Keeping the processing facilities at very low temperatures limits thermal shocks.  Cores are most brittle at the surface, so another approach is to break them into 1&amp;nbsp;m lengths in the hole.  Extruding the core from the drill barrel into a net helps keep it together if it shatters. Brittle cores are also often allowed to rest in storage at the drill site for some time, up to a full year between drilling seasons, to let the ice gradually relax.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Talalay|2016}}, pp. 265–266.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many different kinds of analysis are performed on ice cores, including visual layer counting, tests for [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|electrical conductivity]] and physical properties, and assays for inclusion of gases, particles, [[radionuclide]]s, and various molecular [[Chemical species|species]].  For the results of these tests to be useful in the reconstruction of [[Paleoenvironment|palaeoenvironments]], there has to be a way to determine the relationship between depth and age of the ice.  The simplest approach is to count layers of ice that correspond to the original annual layers of snow, but this is not always possible.  An alternative is to model the ice accumulation and flow to predict how long it takes a given snowfall to reach a particular depth.  Another method is to correlate radionuclides or trace atmospheric gases with other timescales such as periodicities in the earth's [[orbital parameter]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://ww2.valdosta.edu/~dmthieme/Geomorph/Walker_2005_QuaternaryDatingMethods.pdf|title=Quaternary Dating Methods|last=Walker|first=Mike|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2005|isbn=978-0-470-86927-7|location=Chichester|page=150|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714195126/http://ww2.valdosta.edu/~dmthieme/Geomorph/Walker_2005_QuaternaryDatingMethods.pdf|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A difficulty in ice core dating is that gases can [[Diffusion|diffuse]] through firn, so the ice at a given depth may be substantially older than the gases trapped in it.  As a result, there are two chronologies for a given ice core: one for the ice, and one for the trapped gases.  To determine the relationship between the two, models have been developed for the depth at which gases are trapped for a given location, but their predictions have not always proved reliable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bazin|first1=L.|last2=Landais|first2=A.|last3=Lemieux-Dudon|first3=B.|last4=Toyé Mahamadou Kele|first4=H.|last5=Veres|first5=D.|last6=Parrenin|first6=F.|last7=Martinerie|first7=P.|last8=Ritz|first8=C.|last9=Capron|first9=E.|last10=Lipenkov|first10=V.|last11=Loutre|first11=M.-F.|last12=Raynaud|first12=D.|last13=Vinther|first13=B.|last14=Svensson|first14=A.|last15=Rasmussen|first15=S.

The density and size of the bubbles trapped in ice provide an indication of crystal size at the time they formed.  The size of a crystal is related to its growth rate, which in turn depends on the temperature, so the properties of the bubbles can be combined with information on accumulation rates and firn density to calculate the temperature when the firn formed.&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;{{harvnb|Alley|2010}}, p. 1098.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Radiocarbon dating]] can be used on the carbon in trapped {{chem|C|O|2}}.  In the polar ice sheets there is about 15–20&amp;nbsp;µg of carbon in the form of {{chem|C|O|2}} in each kilogram of ice, and there may also be [[carbonate]] particles from wind-blown dust ([[loess]]).  The {{chem|C|O|2}} can be isolated by subliming the ice in a vacuum, keeping the temperature low enough to avoid the loess giving up any carbon.  The results have to be corrected for the presence of [[carbon-14|{{Chem|14|C}}]] produced directly in the ice by cosmic rays, and the amount of correction depends strongly on the location of the ice core.  Corrections for {{Chem|14|C}} produced by nuclear testing have much less impact on the results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=A.T.|last2=Donahue|first2=D.J.|date=|year=1992|title=AMS radiocarbon dating of ice: validity of the technique and the problem of cosmogenic ''in-situ'' production in polar ice cores|url=https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/radiocarbon/article/viewFile/1487/1491|journal=Radiocarbon|volume=34|issue=3|pages=431–435|doi=

The very small quantities typically found require at least 300 g of ice to be used, limiting the ability of the technique to precisely assign an age to core depths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Uglietti|first1=Chiara|last2=Zapf|first2=Alexander|last3=Jenk|first3=Theo Manuel|last4=Sigl|first4=Michael|last5=Szidat|first5=Sönke|last6=Salazar|first6=Gary|last7=Schwikowski|first7=Margit|title=Radiocarbon dating of glacier ice: overview, optimisation, validation and potential|journal=The Cryosphere|date=21 December 2016|volume=10|issue=6|pages=3091–3105|doi=10.5194/tc-10-3091-2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Timescales for ice cores from the same hemisphere can usually be synchronised using layers that include material from volcanic events.  It is more difficult to connect the timescales in different hemispheres.  The [[Laschamp event]], a [[geomagnetic reversal]] about 40,000 years ago, can be identified in cores;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://phys.org/news/2012-10-extremely-reversal-geomagnetic-field-climate.html|title=An extremely brief reversal of the geomagnetic field, climate variability and a super volcano |work=Phys.org |date= 16 October 2012 |publisher=ScienceX network |access-date=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blunier et al.|2007}}, p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt; away from that point, measurements of gases such as {{chem|C|H|4}} ([[methane]]) can be used to connect the chronology of a Greenland core (for example) with an Antarctic core.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landais|Dreyfus|Capron|Pol|2012}}, pp. 191–192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blunier et al.|2007}}, pp. 325–327.&lt;/ref&gt;  In cases where volcanic [[tephra]] is interspersed with ice, it can be dated using [[Argon–argon dating|argon/argon dating]] and hence provide fixed points for dating the ice.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{harvnb|Landais|Dreyfus|Capron|Pol|2012}}, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Quaternary Science|publisher=Elsevier|year=2013|editor-last=Elias|editor-first=Scott|location=Amsterdam|pages=|title=Volcanic Tephra Layers|editor-last2=Mock|editor-first2=Cary|isbn=9780444536426}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Uranium series dating|Uranium decay]] has also been used to date ice cores.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aciego|first=S.|displayauthors=et al.|date=15 April 2010|title=Toward a radiometric ice clock: U-series of the Dome C ice core|url=http://www.earth-prints.org/bitstream/2122/7786/1/mmc1.pdf|journal=TALDICE-EPICA science meeting|location=Rome|volume=|pages=1–2}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Another approach is to use [[Bayesian probability]] techniques to find the optimal combination of multiple independent records.

The boundary between the [[Quaternary extinction event|Pleistocene]] and the [[Holocene]], about 11,700 years ago, is now formally defined with reference to data on Greenland ice cores.  Formal definitions of stratigraphic boundaries allow scientists in different locations to correlate their findings. These often involve fossil records, which are not present in ice cores, but cores have extremely precise [[Paleoclimatology|palaeoclimatic]] information that can be correlated with other climate proxies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Walker|first1=Mike|last2=Johnsen|first2=Sigfus|last3=Rasmussen|first3=Sune Olander|last4=Popp|first4=Trevor|last5=Steffensen|first5=Jørgen-Peder|last6=Gibbard|first6=Phil|last7=Hoek|first7=Wim|last8=Lowe|first8=John|last9=Andrews|first9=John|last10=Björck|first10=Svante|last11=Cwynar|first11=Les C.|last12=Hughen|first12=Konrad|last13=Kershaw|first13=Peter|last14=Kromer|first14=Bernd|last15=Litt|first15=Thomas|last16=Lowe|first16=David J.|last17=Nakagawa|first17=Takeshi|last18=Newnham|first18=Rewi|last19=Schwander|first19=Jakob|author-link10=Svante Björck|title=Formal definition and dating of the GSSP (Global Stratotype Section and Point) for the base of the Holocene using the Greenland NGRIP ice core, and selected auxiliary records|journal=Journal of Quaternary Science|date=January 2009|volume=24|issue=1|pages=3–17|doi=10.1002/jqs.1227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dating of ice sheets has proved to be a key element in providing dates for palaeoclimatic records.  According to [[Richard Alley]], "In many ways, ice cores are the ‘rosetta stones’ that allow development of a global network of accurately dated paleoclimatic records using the best ages determined anywhere on the planet".&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;

=== Visual analysis ===

Cores show visible layers, which correspond to annual snowfall at the core site.  If a pair of pits is dug in fresh snow with a thin wall between them and one of the pits is roofed over, an observer in the roofed pit will see the layers revealed by sunlight shining through.  A six-foot pit may show anything from less than a year of snow to several years of snow, depending on the location.  Poles left in the snow from year to year show the amount of accumulated snow each year, and this can be used to verify that the visible layer in a snow pit corresponds to a single year's snowfall.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alley|2000}}, pp. 44–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

In central Greenland a typical year might produce two or three feet of winter snow, plus a few inches of summer snow.  When this turns to ice, the two layers will make up no more than a foot of ice.  The layers corresponding to the summer snow will contain bigger bubbles than the winter layers, so the alternating layers remain visible, which makes it possible to count down a core and determine the age of each layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alley|2000}}, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;  As the depth increases to the point where the ice structure changes to a clathrate, the bubbles are no longer visible, and the layers can no longer be seen.  Dust layers may now become visible.  Ice from Greenland cores contains dust carried by wind; the dust appears most strongly in late winter, and appears as cloudy grey layers.  These layers are stronger and easier to see at times in the past when the earth's climate was cold, dry, and windy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alley|2000}}, pp. 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Any method of counting layers eventually runs into difficulties as the flow of the ice causes the layers to become thinner and harder to see with increasing depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alley|2000}}, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;  The problem is more acute at locations where accumulation is high; low accumulation sites, such as central Antarctica, must be dated by other methods.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;  For example, at Vostok, layer counting is only possible down to an age of 55,000 years.&lt;ref name=Ruddiman&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ruddiman|first=William F.|date=|year=2003|title=Core handling and processing for the WAIS Divide ice-core project|url=http://moraymo.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2003_ruddimanraymo.pdf|journal=Quaternary Science Reviews|volume=22|pages=141&amp;ndash;142|via=|last2=Raymo|first2=Maureen E.|doi=10.3189/2014AoG68A008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When there is summer melting, the melted snow refreezes lower in the snow and firn, and the resulting layer of ice has very few bubbles so is easy to recognise in a visual examination of a core.  Identification of these layers, both visually and by measuring density of the core against depth, allows the calculation of a melt-feature percentage (MF): an MF of 100% would mean that every year's deposit of snow showed evidence of melting.  MF calculations are averaged over multiple sites or long time periods in order to smooth the data.  Plots of MF data over time reveal variations in the climate, and have shown that since the late 20th century melting rates have been increasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jouzel|2013}}, p. 2533.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fisher|first=David|year=2011|title=Recent melt rates of Canadian arctic ice caps are the highest in four millennia|url=http://arctic.eas.ualberta.ca/downloads/Fisheretal2011onlineGPC.pdf|journal=Global and Planetary Climate Change|volume=84–85|pages=1–4|doi=10.1016/j.gloplacha.2011.06.005|via=|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to manual inspection and logging of features identified in a visual inspection, cores can be optically scanned so that a digital visual record is available.  This requires the core to be cut lengthwise, so that a flat surface is created.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Souney et al.|2014}}, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

===  Isotopic analysis ===
The isotopic composition of the oxygen in a core can be used to model the temperature history of the ice sheet.  Oxygen has three stable isotopes, {{chem|link=oxygen-16|16|O}}, {{chem|link=oxygen-17|17|O}} and {{chem|link=oxygen-18|18|O}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://environmentalchemistry.com/yogi/periodic/O-pg2.html|last=Barbalace |first=Kenneth L.|title=Periodic Table of Elements: O – Oxygen |publisher=EnvironmentalChemistry.com|language=en-US|access-date=20 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ratio between {{chem|18|O}} and {{chem|16|O}} indicates the temperature when the snow fell.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{harvnb|Lowe |Walker|2014}}, pp. 165–170.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because {{chem|16|O}} is lighter than {{chem|18|O}}, water containing {{chem|16|O}} is slightly more likely to turn into vapour, and water containing {{chem|18|O}} is slightly more likely to condense from vapour into rain or snow crystals.  At lower temperatures, the difference is more pronounced.  The standard method of recording the {{chem|18|O}}/{{chem|16|O}} ratio is to subtract the ratio in a standard known as [[Standard Mean Ocean Water|standard mean ocean water]] (SMOW):&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{\delta ^{18}O} = \Biggl( \mathrm{\frac{\bigl( \frac{^{18}O}{^{16}O} \bigr)_{sample}}{\bigl( \frac{^{18}O}{^{16}O} \bigr)_{SMOW}}} -1 \Biggr) \times 1000\ ^{o}\!/\!_{oo},&lt;/math&gt;

where the ‰ sign indicates [[parts per thousand]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  A sample with the same {{chem|18|O}}/{{chem|16|O}} ratio as SMOW has a {{delta|18|O}} of 0‰; a sample that is depleted in {{chem|18|O}} has a negative {{delta|18|O}}.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Combining the {{delta|18|O}} measurements of an ice core sample with the borehole temperature at the depth it came from provides additional information, in some cases leading to significant corrections to the temperatures deduced from the {{delta|18|O}} data.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alley|2000}}, pp. 65–70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  Not all boreholes can be used in these analyses. If the site has experienced significant melting in the past, the borehole will no longer preserve an accurate temperature record.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alley|2010}}, p. 1097.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydrogen ratios can also be used to calculate a temperature history. [[Deuterium]] ({{chem|2|H}}, or D) is heavier than hydrogen ({{chem|1|H}}) and makes water more likely to condense and less likely to evaporate.  A {{delta|D}} ratio can be defined in the same way as {{delta|18|O}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iceandclimate.nbi.ku.dk/research/past_atmos/past_temperature_moisture/isotopes_delta_notation/|title=Isotopes and the delta notation|last=|first=|date=8 September 2009|publisher=Centre for Ice and Climate|language=en|access-date=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-are-past-temperatures/|first=Robert |last=Mulvaney|title=How are past temperatures determined from an ice core?|date=20 September 2004|publisher=Scientific American|access-date=25 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is a linear relationship between {{delta|18|O}} and {{delta|D}}:&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{harvnb|Jouzel|2013}}, pp. 2533–2534.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{\delta D} = 8 \times \mathrm{\delta ^{18} O} + \mathrm{d},&lt;/math&gt;

where d is the deuterium excess. It was once thought that this meant it was unnecessary to measure both ratios in a given core, but in 1979 Merlivat and [[Jean Jouzel|Jouzel]] showed that the deuterium excess reflects the temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed of the ocean where the moisture originated. Since then it has been customary to measure both.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

Water isotope records, analyzed in cores from [[Camp Century]] and [[Dye 3]] in Greenland, were instrumental in the discovery of [[Dansgaard–Oeschger event|Dansgaard-Oeschger events]]—&lt;nowiki/&gt;rapid warming at the onset of an [[interglacial]], followed by slower cooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jouzel|2013}}, p. 2531.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other isotopic ratios have been studied, for example, the ratio between {{chem|13|C}} and {{chem|12|C}} can provide information about past changes in the [[carbon cycle]].  Combining this information with records of carbon dioxide levels, also obtained from ice cores, provides information about the mechanisms behind changes in {{chem|C|O|2}} over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bauska|first1=Thomas K.|last2=Baggenstos|first2=Daniel|last3=Brook|first3=Edward J.|last4=Mix|first4=Alan C.|last5=Marcott|first5=Shaun A.|last6=Petrenko|first6=Vasilii V.|last7=Schaefer|first7=Hinrich|last8=Severinghaus|first8=Jeffrey P.|last9=Lee|first9=James E.|title=Carbon isotopes characterize rapid changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide during the last deglaciation|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=29 March 2016|volume=113|issue=13|pages=3465–3470|doi=10.1073/pnas.1513868113|pmc=4822573}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was understood in the 1960s that analyzing the air trapped in ice cores would provide useful information on the [[paleoatmosphere]], but it was not until the late 1970s that a reliable extraction method was developed.  Early results included a demonstration that the {{chem|C|O|2}} concentration was 30% less at the [[Last Glacial Maximum|last glacial maximum]] than just before the start of the industrial age.  Further research has demonstrated a reliable correlation between {{chem|C|O|2}} levels and the temperature calculated from ice isotope data.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{harvnb|Jouzel|2013}}, p. 2534.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because {{chem|C|H|4}} (methane) is produced in lakes and [[wetland]]s, the amount in the atmosphere is correlated with the strength of [[monsoon]]s, which are in turn correlated with the strength of [[tropics|low-latitude]] summer [[Solar irradiance|insolation]].  Since insolation depends on [[Milankovitch cycles|orbital cycles]], for which a timescale is available from other sources, {{chem|C|H|4}} can be used to determine the relationship between core depth and age.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ruddiman/&gt;  {{chem|N|2|O}} (nitrous oxide) levels are also correlated with glacial cycles, though at low temperatures the graph differs somewhat from the {{chem|C|O|2}} and {{chem|C|H|4}} graphs.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Schilt|first1=Adrian|first2=Matthias|last2=Baumgartner|first3=Thomas|last3=Blunierc|first4=Jakob|last4=Schwander|first5=Renato|last5=Spahni|first6=Hubertus|last6=Fischer|first7=Thomas F.|last7=Stocker|date=|year=2009|title=Glacial-interglacial and millennial-scale variations in the atmospheric nitrous oxide concentration during the last 800,000 years|url=https://ic.ucsc.edu/~acr/ocea285/articles/Schiltetal2010.pdf|journal=Quaternary Science Reviews|volume=29|pages=182–192|doi=10.1016/j.quascirev.2009.03.011|access-date=2 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808205625/https://ic.ucsc.edu/~acr/ocea285/articles/Schiltetal2010.pdf#|archive-date=8 August 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, the ratio between {{chem|N|2}} (nitrogen) and {{chem|O|2}} (oxygen) can be used to date ice cores: as air is gradually trapped by the snow turning to firn and then ice, {{chem|O|2}} is lost more easily than {{chem|N|2}}, and the relative amount of {{chem|O|2}} correlates with the strength of local summer insolation.  This means that the trapped air retains, in the ratio of {{chem|O|2}} to {{chem|N|2}}, a record of the summer insolation, and hence combining this data with orbital cycle data establishes an ice core dating scheme.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landais|Dreyfus|Capron|Pol|2012}}, p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Diffusion]] within the firn layer causes other changes that can be measured.  Gravity causes heavier molecules to be enriched at the bottom of a gas column, with the amount of enrichment depending on the difference in mass between the molecules.  Colder temperatures cause heavier molecules to be more enriched at the bottom of a column.  These [[fractionation]] processes in trapped air, determined by the measurement of the {{chem|15|N}}/{{chem|14|N}} ratio and of [[neon]], [[krypton]] and [[xenon]], have been used to infer the thickness of the firn layer, and determine other palaeoclimatic information such as past mean ocean temperatures.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{harvnb|Jouzel|2013}}, p. 2532.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some gases such as [[helium]] can rapidly diffuse through ice, so it may be necessary to test for these "fugitive gases" within minutes of the core being retrieved to obtain accurate data.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  [[Chlorofluorocarbon]]s (CFCs), which contribute to the [[greenhouse effect]] and also cause [[Ozone depletion|ozone loss]] in the [[stratosphere]],&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Climate Change and Climate Modeling|last=Neelin|first=J.

=== Glaciochemistry ===
Summer snow in Greenland contains some sea salt, blown from the surrounding waters; there is less of it in winter, when much of the sea surface is covered by pack ice.  Similarly, [[hydrogen peroxide]] appears only in summer snow because its production in the atmosphere requires sunlight.  These seasonal changes can be detected because they lead to changes in the electrical conductivity of the ice.  Placing two [[electrode]]s with a high voltage between them on the surface of the ice core gives a measurement of the conductivity at that point. Dragging them down the length of the core, and recording the conductivity at each point, gives a graph that shows an annual periodicity.  Such graphs also identify chemical changes caused by non-seasonal events such as forest fires and major volcanic eruptions.  When a known volcanic event, such as the [[Laki#1783 eruption|eruption of Laki]] in Iceland in 1783, can be identified in the ice core record, it provides a cross-check on the age determined by layer counting.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alley|2000}}, pp. 51–55.&lt;/ref&gt;  Material from Laki can be identified in Greenland ice cores, but did not spread as far as Antarctica; the 1815 eruption of [[Mount Tambora|Tambora]] in Indonesia injected material into the stratosphere, and can be identified in both Greenland and Antarctic ice cores.  If the date of the eruption is not known, but it can be identified in multiple cores, then dating the ice can in turn give a date for the eruption, which can then be used as a reference layer.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;  This was done, for example, in an analysis of the climate for the period from 535 to 550 AD, which was thought to be influenced by an otherwise unknown tropical eruption in about 533 AD; but which turned out to be caused by two eruptions, one in 535 or early 536 AD, and a second one in 539 or 540 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sigl|first1=M.|last2=Winstrup|first2=M.|last3=McConnell|first3=J.

Many other elements and molecules have been detected in ice cores.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;  In 1969, it was discovered that [[lead]] levels in Greenland ice had increased by a factor of over 200 since pre-industrial times, and increases in other elements produced by industrial processes, such as [[copper]], [[cadmium]], and [[zinc]], have also been recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Legrand|Mayewski|1997}}, pp. 231–232.&lt;/ref&gt;  The presence of nitric and sulfuric acid ({{chem|link=nitric acid|H|N|O|3}} and {{chem|link=Sulfuric acid|H|2|S|O|4}}) in precipitation can be shown to correlate with increasing fuel [[combustion]] over time.  [[Mesylate|Methanesulfonate]] (MSA) ({{chem|C|H|3|S|O|3|-}}) is produced in the atmosphere by marine organisms, so ice core records of MSA provide information on the history of the oceanic environment.  Both hydrogen peroxide ({{chem|link=hydrogen peroxide|H|2|O|2}}) and formaldehyde ({{chem|link=formaldehyde|H|C|H|O}}) have been studied, along with organic molecules such as [[carbon black]] that are linked to vegetation emissions and forest fires.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{harvnb|Legrand|Mayewski|1997}}, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some species, such as [[calcium]] and [[ammonium]], show strong seasonal variation.  In some cases there are contributions from more than one source to a given species: for example, Ca&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt; comes from dust as well as from marine sources; the marine input is much greater than the dust input and so although the two sources peak at different times of the year, the overall signal shows a peak in the winter, when the marine input is at a maximum.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Legrand|Mayewski|1997}}, p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt;  Seasonal signals can be erased at sites where the accumulation is low, by surface winds; in these cases it is not possible to date individual layers of ice between two reference layers.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{harvnb|Legrand|Mayewski|1997}}, p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the deposited chemical species may interact with the ice, so what is detected in an ice core is not necessarily what was originally deposited.  Examples include HCHO and {{chem|H|2|O|2}}.  Another complication is that in areas with low accumulation rates, deposition from fog can increase the concentration in the snow, sometimes to the point where the atmospheric concentration could be overestimated by a factor of two.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Legrand|Mayewski|1997}}, pp. 227–228.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Galactic cosmic rays]] produce {{chem|10|Be}} in the atmosphere at a rate that depends on the solar magnetic field.  The strength of the field is related to the intensity of [[solar radiation]], so the level of {{chem|10|Be}} in the atmosphere is a [[Proxy (climate)|proxy]] for climate.

===  Other inclusions ===
Meteorites and micrometeorites that land on polar ice are sometimes concentrated by local environmental processes.  For example, there are places in Antarctica where winds evaporate surface ice, concentrating the solids that are left behind, including meteorites.  Meltwater ponds can also contain meteorites.  At the [[South Pole Station]], ice in a well is melted to provide a water supply, leaving micrometeorites behind. These have been collected by a robotic "vacuum cleaner" and examined, leading to improved estimates of their flux and mass distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alley|2000}}, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;  The well is not an ice core, but the age of the ice that was melted is known, so the age of the recovered particles can be determined. The well becomes about 10 m deeper each year, so micrometeorites collected in a given year are about 100 years older than those from the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last1=Taylor|first1=Susan |last2=Lever |first2=James H. |last3=Harvey |first3=Ralph P. |last4=Govoni |first4=John|date=May 1997 |title=Collecting micrometeorites from the South Pole Water Well|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a327829.pdf |publisher=Cold Regions Research and Engineering Lab, Hanover, NH |pages=1&amp;ndash;2 |docket=97-1 |access-date=14 September 2017 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pollen]], an important component of sediment cores, can also be found in ice cores.

In addition to the impurities in a core and the isotopic composition of the water, the physical properties of the ice are examined.

{{See also|History of scientific ice drilling}}

=== Early years ===
[[File:2000 core-repository02 hg.jpg|thumb|A store of core samples|alt=A man on a walkway between two high shelf racks loaded with ice core samples]]

In 1841 and 1842, [[Louis Agassiz]] drilled holes in the [[Unteraargletscher]] in the [[Alps]]; these were drilled with iron rods and did not produce cores.  The deepest hole achieved was 60&amp;nbsp;m.  On [[Erich von Drygalski]]'s Antarctic expedition in 1902 and 1903, 30&amp;nbsp;m holes were drilled in an iceberg south of the Kerguelen Islands and temperature readings were taken.  The first scientist to create a snow sampling tool was [[James E. Church]], described by Pavel Talalay as "the father of modern snow surveying".  In the winter of 1908–1909, Church constructed steel tubes with slots and cutting heads to retrieve cores of snow up to 3&amp;nbsp;m long.  Similar devices are in use today, modified to allow sampling to a depth of about 9&amp;nbsp;m.  They are simply pushed into the snow and rotated by hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Talalay|2016}}, pp. 9–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first systematic study of snow and firn layers was by Ernst Sorge, who was part of the [[Alfred Wegener]] Expedition to central Greenland in 1930–1931.  Sorge dug a 15&amp;nbsp;m pit to examine the snow layers, and his results were later formalized into Sorge's Law of Densification by Henri Bader, who went on to do additional coring work in northwest Greenland in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Langway|2008}}, pp. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early 1950s, a [[SIPRE]] expedition took pit samples over much of the Greenland ice sheet, obtaining early oxygen isotope ratio data.  Three other expeditions in the 1950s began ice coring work: a joint [[Norwegian-British-Swedish Antarctic Expedition]] (NBSAE), in [[Queen Maud Land]] in Antarctica; the [[Juneau Ice Field Research Project]] (JIRP), in [[Alaska]]; and [[Expéditions Polaires Françaises]], in central Greenland.  Core quality was poor, but some scientific work was done on the retrieved ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Langway|2008}}, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Geophysical Year]] (1957–1958) saw increased [[glaciology]] research around the world, with one of the high priority research targets being deep cores in polar regions.  SIPRE conducted pilot drilling trials in 1956 (to 305 m) and 1957 (to 411 m) at Site 2 in Greenland; the second core, with the benefit of the previous year's drilling experience, was retrieved in much better condition, with fewer gaps.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Langway|2008}}, pp. 9–11.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Antarctica, a 307&amp;nbsp;m core was drilled at [[Byrd Station]] in 1957–1958, and a 264&amp;nbsp;m core at [[Little America V]], on the [[Ross Ice Shelf]], the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Langway|2008}}, pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;  The success of the IGY core drilling led to increased interest in improving ice coring capabilities, and was followed by a [[CRREL]] project at Camp Century, where in the early 1960s three holes were drilled, the deepest reaching the base of the ice sheet at 1387&amp;nbsp;m in July 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Langway|2008}}, pp. 17–20.&lt;/ref&gt;  The drill used at Camp Century then went to Byrd Station, where a 2164&amp;nbsp;m hole was drilled to bedrock before the drill was frozen into the borehole by sub-ice meltwater and had to be abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Langway|2008}}, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

French, Australian and Canadian projects from the 1960s and 1970s include a 905&amp;nbsp;m core at [[Dome C]] in Antarctica, drilled by [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|CNRS]]; cores at [[Law Dome]] drilled by [[Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions|ANARE]], starting in 1969 with a 382&amp;nbsp;m core; and [[Devon Ice Cap]] cores recovered by a Canadian team in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] ice drilling projects began in the 1950s, in [[Franz Josef Land]], the [[Urals]], [[Novaya Zemlya]], and at [[Mirny Station|Mirny]] and Vostok in the Antarctic; not all these early holes retrieved cores.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ueda|Talalay|2007}}, pp. 3–5.&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the following decades work continued at multiple locations in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ueda|Talalay|2007}}, pp. 50–58.&lt;/ref&gt; Drilling in the Antarctic focused mostly on Mirny and Vostok, with a series of deep holes at Vostok begun in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ueda|Talalay|2007}}, pp. 3–26.&lt;/ref&gt;  The first deep hole at Vostok reached 506.9&amp;nbsp;m in April 1970; by 1973 a depth of 952&amp;nbsp;m had been reached.  A subsequent hole, Vostok 2, drilled from 1971 to 1976, reached 450&amp;nbsp;m, and Vostok 3 reached 2202&amp;nbsp;m in 1985 after six drilling seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ueda|Talalay|2007}}, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  Vostok 3 was the first core to retrieve ice from the previous glacial period, 150,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;  Drilling was interrupted by a fire at the camp in 1982, but further drilling began in 1984, eventually reaching 2546&amp;nbsp;m in 1989. A fifth Vostok core was begun in 1990, reached 3661&amp;nbsp;m in 2007, and was later extended to 3769&amp;nbsp;m.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{harvnb|Jouzel|2013}}, p. 2527.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;  The estimated age of the ice is 420,000 years at 3310&amp;nbsp;m depth; below that point it is difficult to interpret the data reliably because of mixing of the ice.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{harvnb|Jouzel|2013}}, p. 2529.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EPICA delta D plot.svg|thumb|The EPICA Dome C and Vostok ice cores compared|400px]]

[[EPICA]], a European ice coring collaboration, was formed in the 1990s, and two holes were drilled in East Antarctica: one at Dome C, which reached 2871&amp;nbsp;m in only two seasons of drilling, but which took another four years to reach bedrock at 3260 m; and one at [[Kohnen Station]], which reached bedrock at 2760&amp;nbsp;m in 2006.  The Dome C core had very low accumulation rates, which mean that the climate record extended a long way; by the end of the project the usable data extended to 800,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Other deep Antarctic cores included a Japanese project at [[Dome F]], which reached 2503&amp;nbsp;m in 1996, with an estimated age of 330,000 years for the bottom of the core; and a subsequent hole at the same site which reached 3035&amp;nbsp;m in 2006, estimated to reach ice 720,000 years old.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  US teams drilled at [[McMurdo Station]] in the 1990s,  and at [[Taylor Dome]] (554&amp;nbsp;m in 1994) and [[Siple Dome]] (1004&amp;nbsp;m in 1999), with both cores reaching ice from the last glacial period.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bentley|first=Charles R.|last2=Koci|first2=Bruce R.|date=|year=2007|title=Drilling to the beds of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets: a review|url=https://www.igsoc.org/annals/47/a47a011.pdf|journal=Annals of Glaciology|volume=47|pages=3–4|doi=

In 2016, cores were retrieved from the [[Allan Hills]] in Antarctica in an area where old ice lay near the surface.  The cores were dated by potassium-argon dating; traditional ice core dating is not possible as not all layers were present.  The oldest core was found to include ice from 2.7 million years ago—by far the oldest ice yet dated from a core.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/08/record-shattering-27-million-year-old-ice-core-reveals-start-ice-ages|title=Record-shattering 2.7-million-year-old ice core reveals start of the ice ages|last=|first=|date=14 August 2017|work=Science |publisher= AAAS|access-date=30 August 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Greenland deep cores ===
In 1970, scientific discussions began which resulted in the [[Greenland Ice Sheet Project]] (GISP), a multinational investigation into the Greenland ice sheet that lasted until 1981.  Years of field work were required to determine the ideal location for a deep core; the field work included several intermediate-depth cores, at Dye 3 (372&amp;nbsp;m in 1971), Milcent (398&amp;nbsp;m in 1973) and Crete (405&amp;nbsp;m in 1974), among others.  A location in north-central Greenland was selected as ideal, but financial constraints forced the group to drill at Dye 3 instead, beginning in 1979.  The hole reached bedrock at 2037&amp;nbsp;m, in 1981.  Two holes, 30&amp;nbsp;km apart, were eventually drilled at the north-central location in the early 1990s by two groups: [[Greenland Ice Core Project|GRIP]], a European consortium, and GISP-2, a group of US universities.  GRIP reached bedrock at 3029&amp;nbsp;m in 1992, and GISP-2 reached bedrock at 3053&amp;nbsp;m the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Langway|2008}}, pp. 27–28.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both cores were limited to about 100,000 years of climatic information, and since this was thought to be connected to the topography of the rock underlying the ice sheet at the drill sites, a new site was selected 200&amp;nbsp;km north of GRIP, and a new project, [[North Greenland Ice Core Project|NorthGRIP]], was launched as an international consortium led by Denmark.  Drilling began in 1996; the first hole had to be abandoned at 1400&amp;nbsp;m in 1997, and a new hole was begun in 1999, reaching 3085&amp;nbsp;m in 2003.  The hole did not reach bedrock, but terminated at a subglacial river.  The core provided climatic data back to 123,000 years ago, which covered part of the last interglacial period.  The subsequent North Greenland Eemian ([[NEEM Camp|NEEM]]) project retrieved a 2537&amp;nbsp;m core in 2010 from a site further north, extending the climatic record to 128,500 years ago;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{harvnb|Jouzel|2013}}, p. 2528.&lt;/ref&gt; NEEM was followed by [[East Greenland Ice-Core Project|EastGRIP]], which began in 2015 in east Greenland and is expected to be complete in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eastgrip.org/documentation/|title=Documentation|last=Madsen|first=Martin Vindbæk|date=15 March 2016|publisher=East Greenland Ice Core Project|language=en|access-date=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-polar cores ===
Ice cores have been drilled at locations away from the poles, notably in the [[Himalayas]] and the [[Andes]].  Some of these cores reach back to the last glacial period, but they are more important as records of [[El Niño]] events and of [[monsoon season]]s in south Asia.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;  Cores have also been drilled on [[Mount Kilimanjaro]],&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; in the Alps,&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; and in Indonesia,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|MacKinnon|1980}}, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|MacKinnon|1980}}, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Iceland,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|MacKinnon|1980}}, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Scandinavia,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|MacKinnon|1980}}, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Canada,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|MacKinnon|1980}}, p. 26-29.&lt;/ref&gt; and the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|MacKinnon|1980}}, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Future plans ==
[[IPICS]] (International Partnerships in Ice Core Sciences) has produced a series of white papers outlining future challenges and scientific goals for the ice core science community.  These include plans to:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://pastglobalchanges.org/ini/end-aff/ipics/white-papers|title=IPICS White Papers|last=|first=|date=|publisher=PAGES – Past Global Changes|access-date=17 June 2017|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Retrieve ice cores that reach back over 1.2 million years, in order to obtain multiple iterations of ice core record for the 40,000-year long climate cycles known to have operated at that time.  Current cores reach back over 800,000 years, and show 100,000-year cycles.
* Improve ice core chronologies, including connecting chronologies of multiple cores.
* Identify additional proxies from ice cores, for example for sea ice, marine biological productivity, or forest fires.
* Drill additional cores to provide high-resolution data for the last 2,000 years, to use as input for detailed climate modelling.
* Identify an improved drilling fluid
* Improve the ability to handle brittle ice, both while drilling and in transport and storage
* Find a way to handle cores which have pressurised water at bedrock
* Come up with a standardised lightweight drill capable of drilling both wet and dry holes, and able to reach depths of up to 1000 m.
* Improve core handling to maximise the information that can be obtained from each core.

The '''International Facility for Food Irradiation Technology''' (IFFIT) was a research and training centre at the Institute of Atomic Research in Agriculture in [[Wageningen]], [[Netherlands]],&lt;ref name="Gould1995"/&gt; sponsored by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) of the [[United Nations]], the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) and the [[Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality (Netherlands)|Dutch Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries]].&lt;ref name="Gould1996"/&gt;

==Aims==
The organisation's aim was to address food loss and [[food safety]] in developing countries by speeding up the practical introduction of the [[food irradiation]] process. They achieved this by training initiatives, research and feasibility studies.&lt;ref name="Gould1995"/&gt;

It was founded in 1978 and was operational until 1990, and during those twelve years over four hundred key personnel from over fifty countries were trained in aspects of food irradiation,&lt;ref name="Gould1995"/&gt; making a significant contribution to the development and use of the radiation process.&lt;ref name="Kumar2008"/&gt; The Facility also co-ordinated research into the technology, economics and implementation of food irradiation, assisted in the assessment of the feasibility of using radiation to preserve foodstuffs, and evaluated trial shipments of irradiated material.&lt;ref name="RPAC"/&gt;

==Facilities==
The Facility had a pilot plant with a [[cobalt-60]] source whose activity was {{convert|100000|Ci|TBq|lk=on}}, which was stored underwater.&lt;ref name="Laka"/&gt; Drums or boxes containing products were placed on rotating tables or [[conveyor belt]]s, and irradiation took place by raising the source out of the pool.

==Details==
During IFFIT's first five years of operation, 109 scientists from 40 countries attended six training courses, five of them being general training courses on food irradiation and the sixth being a specialised course on public health aspects. IFFIT also evaluated shipments of irradiated [[mangoes]], [[spices]], [[avocado]], [[shrimp]], [[onions]] and [[garlic]], and produced 46 reports.&lt;ref name="IAEA26"/&gt;

One trainee noted that Professor D. A. A. Mossel (1918–2004) assisted with the training courses with what he described as "remarkably suggestive lectures and his phenomenal foreign language abilities".&lt;ref name="Farkas"/&gt; From 1988 onwards, [[Ari Brynjolfsson]] was director of IFFIT.&lt;ref name="Timinn88"/&gt;

'''Joseph Pitty Couthouy''' (6 January 1808 &amp;ndash; 4 April 1864) was an American [[naval officer]], [[conchologist]], and invertebrate [[palaeontologist]]. Born in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], he entered the [[Boston Latin School]] in 1820.  He married Mary Greenwood Wild on 9 March 1832.

Couthouy applied to President [[Andrew Jackson]] for a position on the Scientific Corps of the U.S. Navy's [[United States Exploring Expedition|Exploring Expedition]] of 1838.&lt;ref name=Stanton&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stanton|first1=William|title=The Great United States Exploring Expedition|date=1975|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0520025571|pages=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He sailed with the expedition on 18 August 1838, but was sent to the [[Hawaiian Islands|Sandwich Islands]] for sick leave.  Eventually, he dismissed according to [[Charles Wilkes]] for attempting to "promote dissension, bring me into disrepute, and destroy the harmony and efficiency of the Squadron."&lt;ref name=Stanton/&gt;{{rp|137,147,180,219}} 

Although he meticulously labeled all of his specimens from the expedition, Dall recounts how "The authorities in Washington had appointed a reverened gentleman who knew nothing of science, with a fat salary, to unpack and take care of the specimens sent home by the expedition."{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}  This gentleman then separated the specimens from the tags thus rendering many of them useless. Couthouy returned to Washington and tried to work up what he could of the collection and was then informed, "to crown all of his misfortunes", that his pay was to be reduced by forty-four percent.  He then returned to his profession as a master in the [[merchant marine]], visiting South America and the Pacific. 

In 1854, he took command of an expedition to the Bay of [[Cumaná]], where he spent three unsuccessful years in search of the wreck of the Spanish treasure ship ''San Pedro'', lost there in the early part of the century.&lt;ref name=Stanton/&gt;{{rp|379}} 

A good [[Translator|linguist]], he spoke fluent Spanish, French, Italian, and Portuguese, and had mastered several dialects used in the [[Pacific Islands]]. 

In the [[American Civil War]], Couthouy was ordered to command {{USS|Columbia|1862|6}} on 31 December 1862, which was wrecked, and Couthouy made prisoner.  He later commanded {{USS|Osage|1863|6}}.

Finally, he commanded {{USS|Chillicothe|1862|6}} during the [[Red River Campaign]]. On 2 April 1864, he was shot by a sniper and died the following day.&lt;ref name=Stanton/&gt;{{rp|370}}

The 1993 '''Journey to the Center of the Earth''' is a TV film first aired on NBC. It stars [[Carel Struycken]], [[Tim Russ]], and [[Jeffrey Nordling]], John Neville, [[F. Murray Abraham]], [[Fabiana Udenio]], and [[Kim Miyori]]. A TV series was originally planned after its release but it was cancelled.

== Plot ==
A team of explorers sets on a voyage to the earth's core, following an earlier attempt years before. Their ship, ''Avenger'', enters the lava chamber of an active volcano and uses an energy ray called a "sonic blaster"  to blast through the flow. They enter in a subterranean world over 100 kilometers below the Earth's surface. The place is filled with many strange creatures. As they explore deeper into the underground caverns they encounter a [[yeti]] which the crew named Dallas that serves as their guide. Meanwhile, an unknown malevolent entity is attempting to recover the missing pieces of an [[Atlantis|Atlantean]] artifact known as the "book of knowledge" one of which a crew member of the Avenger brought with him, that will supposedly give massive powers to whomever possesses it.

The abbreviation '''kyr''' means "thousand years".

Kyr was formerly common in some [[English language]] works, especially in [[geology]] and [[astronomy]], for the [[physical unit|unit]] of 1,000 years or [[millennium]]. The "k" is the [[SI prefix|unit prefix]] for [[kilo-]] or thousand with the suffix "yr" simply an abbreviation for "year".

Occasionally, the "k" is shown in [[upper case]], as in "100 Kyr"; this is an incorrect usage.  "kyr" itself is often considered incorrect, with some preferring to use "ky".

[[ISO 80000-3]] recommends usage of ka (for [[kiloannum]]), which avoids the implicit English bias of "year" by using a [[Latin]] root.

The [[British Overseas Territory]] of [[Bermuda]] has a long history of encounters with [[Atlantic hurricane|Atlantic tropical cyclones]], many of which inflicted significant damage and influenced the territory's development. A small [[archipelago]] comprising about 138 islands and islets, Bermuda occupies {{convert|21|sqmi|sqkm}} in the North Atlantic Ocean, roughly {{convert|650|mi|km}} east of [[Cape Hatteras, North Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The World Factbook: Bermuda|date=January 20, 2016|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|accessdate=February 4, 2016|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bd.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The islands are situated far outside the main development region for Atlantic hurricanes,&lt;ref name="elsner233"&gt;Elsner and Kara, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt; but within the typical belt of [[Westerlies#Interaction with tropical cyclones|recurving]] tropical cyclones.&lt;ref name="list"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Mark Guishard |author2=James Dodgson |author3=Michael Johnston |date=April 2016|title=Hurricanes – General Information for Bermuda|publisher=Bermuda Weather Service|url=http://www.weather.bm/tropicalArchiveDocuments/Summary%20And%20Miscellaneous/Tropical%20Climatology%20-%20Timeline.docx|accessdate=October 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most storms form in the central Atlantic or western Caribbean Sea before approaching Bermuda from the southwest; storms forming north of 28°N are unlikely to impact the territory.&lt;ref name="elsner234"&gt;Elsner and Kara, p. 234&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Bermuda Weather Service]], the islands of Bermuda experience a damaging tropical cyclone once every six to seven years, on average.&lt;ref name="list"/&gt; Due to the small area of the island chain, [[landfall]]s and direct hits are rare.&lt;ref name="list"/&gt; Strictly speaking, only nine landfalls have occurred during years included in the official [[HURDAT|Atlantic hurricane database]], starting in 1851.{{hurdat}} When hurricanes [[Hurricane Fay (2014)|Fay]] and [[Hurricane Gonzalo|Gonzalo]] struck Bermuda just days apart in October 2014, that season became the first to produce two landfalls. Two damaging storms impacted Bermuda in September 1899, but the center of the first storm narrowly missed the islands.&lt;ref name="gonzalotcr"/&gt; Tropical cyclones, and their antecedent or remnant weather systems, have affected the territory in all seasons, most frequently in the late summer months.&lt;ref name="list"/&gt; A study of recorded storms from 1609 to 1996 found that direct hits from hurricanes were most common in early September and late October, with an intervening relative lull creating two distinct 'seasons'.&lt;ref name="elsner236"/&gt;

Hurricanes late in the year are often in the process of undergoing [[extratropical cyclone|extratropical transition]] and receiving [[baroclinicity|baroclinic enhancement]].&lt;ref name="elsner236"&gt;Elsner and Kara, p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; Bermuda is less likely to be impacted during years when the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico, and southeastern United States are favored targets.&lt;ref name="list"/&gt; Even in intense hurricanes, the islands tend to fare relatively well; ever since a cyclone in 1712 destroyed many wooden buildings, most structures have been built with stone walls and roofs, and are able to withstand severe winds. As a result, hurricane-related deaths have been uncommon since the early 18th century.&lt;ref name="list"/&gt; Ten storms have collectively caused 129 fatalities; 110 of them, or 85%, were the result of shipwrecks along the shore in [[1926 Havana–Bermuda hurricane|Hurricane "Ten"]] of 1926. [[Hurricane Fabian]] in 2003 was the only system in the [[weather satellite]] era to cause storm-related deaths.

In total, 186 events are listed,&lt;!-- FIGURE LAST UPDATED AFTER BERYL--&gt; with widely varying degrees of damage. A hurricane in 1609 was responsible for the first permanent settlement on Bermuda: in late July, the [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]]-bound, British ship ''[[Sea Venture]]'' nearly foundered in the storm and sought refuge on the islands, which the passengers found surprisingly hospitable. Hurricane Fabian was the most intense storm to impact the territory in modern times, though officially it did not make landfall, and was the only storm to have its name [[list of retired Atlantic hurricanes|retired]] for effects in Bermuda. The costliest storms were Fabian and Gonzalo, which caused about $300 million and $200–400 million in damage respectively (2003 and 2014 [[United States Dollar|USD]]). Accounting for inflation and continued development, Fabian would have likely wrought around $650 million in damage had it struck in 2014.&lt;ref name="air"&gt;{{cite news|title=Modellers estimate $200m–$400m in insured losses from Gonzalo|date=October 22, 2014|newspaper=The Royal Gazette|accessdate=May 15, 2015|url=http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20141022/BUSINESS/141029866}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent tropical cyclone to affect the islands was [[2018 Atlantic hurricane season#Hurricane Chris|Tropical Storm Chris]] in July 2018.

==List of storms==

===1543–1699===
*1543 – The year 1543 and indistinct initials are carved on a rock in the modern-day [[Spittal Pond Nature Reserve]], likely by the occupants of a Portuguese vessel that became separated from her fleet and driven aground in the summer months. Thirty sailors survive on Bermuda for about 60 days, during which time they construct a seaworthy craft from recovered timbers of their wrecked ship. Given the time of year, a tropical hurricane may be responsible for this incident.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;
*July 24, 1609 – A hurricane sets the stage for the British colonization of Bermuda when a ship bound for [[Jamestown, Virginia]], is caught in the storm and forced to steer aground. When a fleet of [[Virginia Company]] ships tasked with resupplying the failing Jamestown colony encounters the hurricane, the flagship, ''[[Sea Venture]]'', becomes separated from the other vessels and begins to take on water. The increasingly waterlogged ''Sea Venture'' battles the rough seas until July 28, when, just as the crew becomes resigned to their fate, Admiral [[George Somers|Sir George Somers]] spots the uninhabited rocky shores of Bermuda. To prevent the ship from sinking, Somers deliberately drives her onto the reefs about a half mile off the eastern coast. Using the ship's [[longboat]], all 150 settlers, as well as the crew, make it safely ashore.&lt;ref name="tucker20"&gt;Tucker, pp. 20–23&lt;/ref&gt; The so-called "Isle of Devils" proves far more hospitable than initially feared, with abundant food and resources. Two new ships, the ''Deliverance'' and the ''Patience'', are constructed, and nearly all of the ''Sea Venture's'' original occupants set sail for Jamestown. The Virginia Company administers the islands until the formation of the [[Somers Isles Company]] in 1615.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1609- Colonization of Bermuda|publisher=University of Rhode Island|accessdate=December 11, 2015|url=http://www.hurricanescience.org/history/storms/pre1900s/1609/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tale of the ''Sea Venture'' inspired [[William Shakespeare]] to write ''[[The Tempest]]'', and the [[coat of arms of Bermuda]] features a prominent representation of the shipwreck.&lt;ref name="tucker20"/&gt;
*July (?) 1612 – A hurricane destroys a recently constructed church.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;
*September 1615 – A severe hurricane strikes Bermuda &lt;ref&gt;Tucker, pp. 23–25&lt;/ref&gt;
*November 1619 – Two hurricanes strike Bermuda during the month, sinking at least one ship, uprooting large trees, ruining the entire winter corn crop, and destroying a wooden watchtower constructed seven years earlier.&lt;ref name="list"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TuckerNovember1619"&gt;Tucker, pp. 25–26&lt;/ref&gt; The rapid succession of two hurricanes leaves the colony with a severe food shortage.&lt;ref name="Tucker1620"/&gt;
*1620 – A hurricane flattens hastily built shacks, while two fishermen are lost at sea.&lt;ref name="Tucker1620"&gt;Tucker, pp. 26&lt;/ref&gt;
*September 13, 1621 – The arrival of a supply ship into port is delayed by stormy conditions; by the time the vessel wrecks along the coast, some of her passengers have died of a rampant illness.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, pp. 26–27&lt;/ref&gt;
*August 16, 1629 – The most damaging hurricane thus far in the colony's history destroys crops, several forts, a prison, and the rebuilt watchtower.&lt;ref name="list"/&gt;
*October 20, 1639 – Two Spanish ships ground out in a hurricane; the occupants are brought ashore, and charged monthly accommodation fees until their departure the following February. The sailors claim that the Governor had prevented them from leaving the colony except by means of purchasing their own ship.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, pp. 30–33&lt;/ref&gt;
*October 16, 1664 – A British ship blows aground in the midst of a storm.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, pp. 33–34&lt;/ref&gt;
*August 24, 1669 – One ship is wrecked by a hurricane along the shore of [[Castle Island, Bermuda|Castle Island]], with five men lost, and another capsizes roughly {{convert|20|mi|km|abbr=on}} off [[Ireland Island, Bermuda|Ireland Island]].&lt;ref name="tucker34"/&gt;
*1686 – Hurricane season leaves the Government House in a state of disrepair.&lt;ref name="tucker34"&gt;Tucker, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

===1700–1799===
*September 8, 1712 – A severe hurricane buffets Bermuda for eight hours, destroying most of the churches. The storm highlights the necessity of ongoing efforts to shift from wood construction to stone.&lt;ref name="tucker36"&gt;Tucker, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;
*1713 – By November, the effects of two hurricanes are evident, though the collective impact is less severe than that of the 1712&amp;nbsp;hurricane.&lt;ref name="tucker36"/&gt;
*1715 – A disastrous hurricane destroys the rest of the wooden churches left standing after the 1712&amp;nbsp;hurricane.&lt;ref name="tucker36"/&gt;
*1726 – A season of stormy weather includes two hurricane strikes in rapid succession. Private and public buildings alike are damaged by the hurricanes, and the persistent bad weather leads to a stream of stricken ships entering [[St. George's Harbour, Bermuda|St. George's Harbour]] for repairs. Without the support of the [[Somers Isles Company]], which was dissolved in 1684, impoverished colonists grow disillusioned; they are often unable to repair storm-related damage, the crops in 1726 are a complete loss, and the small supply of gunpowder is compromised.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, pp. 36–37&lt;/ref&gt;
*1728 – The newly appointed [[Governor of Bermuda]], [[John Pitt (soldier)|John Pitt]], arrives to find the island in distress from a recent hurricane impact. The official residence requires repair once more.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;
*October 18, 1780 – After emerging from the [[Lesser Antilles]], where it establishes itself as the deadliest Atlantic hurricane on record, the [[Great Hurricane of 1780]] devastates Bermuda,&lt;ref name="list"/&gt; likely passing southeast of the islands.&lt;ref name="pr"&gt;{{cite web|author=Orlando Pérez|year=1970|title=Notes on the Tropical Cyclones of Puerto Rico|publisher=San Juan, Puerto Rico National Weather Service|accessdate=December 2, 2015|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/data_sub/perez_11_20.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some fifty ships are driven ashore with the [[storm surge]], and vast swaths of trees are uprooted; the town of St. George's is left with a "completely denuded air." Many homes are demolished. Famine and a [[smallpox]] epidemic take hold in the aftermath of the hurricane.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, pp. 37–39&lt;/ref&gt;
*September 1786 – Houses are damaged and trees are uprooted by a hurricane, and the cotton crop is largely destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, pp. 39–40&lt;/ref&gt;
*October 23, 1793 – A violent hurricane passes near the islands, causing "inconceivable" damage to homes and public buildings, many of them being totally destroyed. The storm topples several thousand trees and wreaks havoc on shipping; every vessel in St. George's Harbour is driven aground, many ships being wrecked or heavily damaged, and numerous wharves are lost. Most of the 40 or so [[fish pond]]s along the north shore of [[St. David's Island, Bermuda|St. David's Island]], with a cumulative capacity of about 5,000 fish, are destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, pp. 40–42&lt;/ref&gt;

===1800–1849===
*September 9–10, 1800 – The sloop ''John'' founders amid rough seas from a tropical storm or hurricane; her entire crew is rescued.&lt;ref name="Tucker1800"&gt;Tucker, pp. 42–43&lt;/ref&gt; Bermuda is subjected to a period of [[gale]]s but suffers no damage.&lt;ref name="list"/&gt;
*November 4–5, 1800 – A hurricane brings strong winds to the islands, "destroying every shrub in its direction."&lt;ref name="Tucker1800"/&gt; Damage to trees and crops is substantial, and multiple vessels are driven ashore. This hurricane prompts a change in attitude toward the need for a lighthouse in Bermuda, and the establishment of a Marine Society is sought to aid families of sailors lost along the rocky coasts.&lt;ref name="Tucker1800"/&gt;
*August 4–5, 1813 – Prior to this storm, St. George's Harbour becomes congested with numerous warships due to a [[War of 1812|war between Great Britain and the United States]]. Additionally, the economic aspect of this war leads to merchant vessels being detained within the harbour, further crowding the waters. A complete record of the number of ships does not exist, though at least 30&amp;nbsp;are believed to be present at the time of the hurricane. Around noon on August&amp;nbsp;4, a heavy squall affects the islands and winds steadily increase through the night. By early the following morning, winds roared at {{convert|90|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, tearing roofs from homes and ships from their moorings. There are violent collisions between vessels, described as a "horde of ships" by Master Joseph Hinson of the schooner Chapman, in the crowded harbour.&lt;ref name="Tucker1813"/&gt; Nearly every vessel is driven ashore or wrecked. Untold quantities of cargo are lost, with little to salvage. Despite the damage, only one life is lost aboard the [[ketch]] ''General Doyle''. In the storm's wake, construction begins on a new breakwater and other coastal installations.&lt;ref name="Tucker1813"&gt;Tucker, pp. 44–46&lt;/ref&gt;
*October 15–19, 1814 – A hurricane strikes the islands "head-on," with persistent gale-force winds. Roads are clogged with debris and some homes are flooded, though damage is generally minor.&lt;ref name="list"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt;
*1815 – A slow-moving hurricane on an unspecified date batters the islands, altering the configuration of the coastline.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;
*August 1818 – A hurricane unroofs the Town Hall building on Front Street in Hamilton.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;
*September 19, 1828 – A hurricane to the northwest produces gale-force winds.&lt;ref name="list"/&gt;
*June 6–7, 1832 – The center of a tropical cyclone passes over or very close to the islands.&lt;ref name="list"/&gt; Two schooners in St. George's Harbour are driven aground, and several houses are partially or totally unroofed. Tree damage is extensive.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, pp. 50–51&lt;/ref&gt;
*September 11–12, 1839 – One of the worst storms in Bermuda's history strikes the islands from the south with an exceptional {{convert|11|ft|m|abbr=on}} storm surge.&lt;ref name="list"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Edward Harris|title=Bermuda: To the hurricane born|date=February 10, 2011|newspaper=The Royal Gazette|accessdate=December 1, 2015|url=http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20100925/ISLAND/309259981}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boats along the southern shore are carried ashore and deposited in fields,&lt;ref name="reid443"&gt;Reid, p. 443&lt;/ref&gt; while various species of fish are seen hundreds of yards inland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Violent hurricane at Bermuda|date=October 9, 1839|newspaper=Public Ledger|accessdate=December 1, 2015|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3742120/public_ledger/|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hurricane-force winds uproot many thousands of trees and level numerous homes; few structures escape damage. Roadways are left impassable by debris from trees, walls, and fences. Many families are left homeless, some forced to abandon their homes in the middle of the night and endure the storm in the open. Sea spray renders nearly all residential wells brackish. Despite the destruction, no lives are reported lost.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, pp. 53–56&lt;/ref&gt;  The storm is typically known as ''Reid's Hurricane'', after the newly appointed Bermuda Governor [[William Reid (British Army officer)|William Reid]] who studied and documented Atlantic hurricanes with great interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Celia Palmer Curtis|title=Reid's Hurricane of September 1839|date=June 15, 2000|newspaper=The Royal Gazette|accessdate=December 1, 2015|url=http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20000615/ISLAND/306159966}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*October 21, 1841 – Hurricane-force winds from a nearby cyclone destroy a couple houses and damage several more, as well as destroying trees and food crops. Potato plants are left "as black and withered as if destroyed by a severe frost."&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;
*October 8–9, 1842 – Winds increase to [[Beaufort scale|Force 9]] as a hurricane passes to the north.&lt;ref&gt;Ludlum, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;
*August 18, 1843 – A small hurricane is distantly felt in the form of gusty winds.&lt;ref name="list"/&gt;
*October 27, 1845 – The islands experience gale-force winds from a tropical cyclone to the east.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;
*September 17–18, 1846 – Squally weather and pounding surf indicate the passage of a hurricane to the south and west. Aside from damage to trees, no major destruction is reported.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, pp. 58–59&lt;/ref&gt;
*October 15, 1848 – Violent winds and tides {{convert|3|to|4|ft}} from a nearby hurricane batter the islands. Many wharves are submerged or entirely washed away, while stone walls and part of a breakwater collapse from the force of the surge. Roadways and homes in [[Flatts Village, Bermuda|Flatts Village]] are also flooded.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, pp. 59–60&lt;/ref&gt;

===1850–1899===
*September 6–8, 1853 – The outer fringes of a [[1853 Atlantic hurricane season#Hurricane Three|major hurricane]] are felt in the islands, but no damage is reported.&lt;ref name="tucker61"/&gt;
*September 26–27, 1853 – A [[1853 Atlantic hurricane season#Hurricane Six|tropical cyclone]] to the east produces gale-force winds and heavy rainfall.&lt;ref name="tucker61"&gt;Tucker, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;
*October 21, 1854 – A [[1854 Atlantic hurricane season#Tropical Storm Five|tropical storm]] passes a short distance to the southeast with Force 11 winds. "Great" property damage is reported, particularly at [[Spanish Point, Bermuda|Spanish Point]], and numerous boats are destroyed. Observers witness two possible tornadoes: one that passes over [[Boaz Island, Bermuda|Boaz Island]], scouring the ground, and another in eastern [[Paget Parish]] that topples trees and unroofs a home.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;
*October 23–24, 1858 – The center of a [[1858 Atlantic hurricane season#Hurricane Six|moderate hurricane]] passes near the islands with powerful winds and flooding tides. The storm damages many homes and churches, and uproots a large number of trees.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, p. 62–63&lt;/ref&gt;
*October 4, 1866 – Force 11 winds are reported on the outer fringes of a distant [[1866 Atlantic hurricane season#Hurricane Six|hurricane]]. Buildings sustain roof and wall damage, trees are toppled, and several boats are damaged or wrecked.&lt;ref name="Tucker, p. 64"&gt;Tucker, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;
*September 10, 1870 – A [[1870 Atlantic hurricane season#Hurricane Four|major hurricane]] to the northwest blows down a large number of banana trees.&lt;ref name="Tucker, p. 64"/&gt;
[[File:Floating Dock BERMUDA Tafel3.jpg|right|thumb|The floating dry dock ''Bermuda'', heavily damaged in an August 1878 hurricane, is shown being towed to Bermuda in 1869|alt=A large, U-shaped vessel, on the high seas, being towed by a sailing ship.]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31618">The following is a list of [[bolide]]s and fireballs seen on Earth in recent times. These are small asteroids (known as [[meteoroid]]s) that regularly impact the Earth. Although most are so small that they burn up in the atmosphere before reaching the surface, some larger objects may reach the surface as fragments, known as [[meteorite]]s. A few of these are detected by [[NASA]]'s [[Sentry (monitoring system)|Sentry system]], in which case the [[Asteroid_impact_prediction|impact is predicted in advance]].

Meteors with a recorded [[absolute magnitude]] are then converted to an asteroidal absolute magnitude under (M&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = M&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; + 31) and then converted to a diameter assuming that meteoroids brighten by approximate 10 magnitudes when entering the atmosphere. Objects reported only to the [[American Meteor Society]] are only listed if observed by at least 100 people, and are cross-referenced with [https://fireballs.ndc.nasa.gov https://fireballs.ndc.nasa.gov] if possible, to determine further physical characteristics. The fourth and third to last parameters are calculated from http://convertalot.com/asteroid_impact_calculator.html , assuming a density of 1.5 g/cm^3, an impact angle of 45°, and a velocity of 17&amp;nbsp;km/s (if not provided). The actual values for both may vary by as much as the value itself, so be aware that these values are only estimates.

The bolide on 2015/09/07 is the [[2015 Thailand bolide]], and the bolide on 2015/02/26 May be related to the [[2015 Kerala meteorite]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25968">Many elm (''Ulmus'') trees of various kinds have attained great size or otherwise become particularly noteworthy; among these are the following.

==American Elm ''Ulmus americana''==

[[File:Treaty of Penn with Indians by Benjamin West.jpg|thumb|right|William Penn and Indians with treaty under a large elm in 1683, as shown in the painting by Benjamin West]]
Most of North America's notable elms are ''[[Ulmus americana]]'', a fast-growing and long-lived species capable of attaining great size in a few centuries, especially when open-grown.&lt;ref name=Werthner&gt;{{cite book |last=Werthner |first=William B. |title=Some American Trees:  An intimate study of native Ohio trees |year=1935 |publisher=The Macmillan Company |location=New York |pages=xviii + 398}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Treaty Elm, [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. In what is now [[Penn Treaty Park]], the founder of Pennsylvania, [[William Penn]], is said to have entered into a treaty of peace in 1683 with the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|native]] [[Lenape|Lenape Turtle Clan]] under a picturesque elm tree immortalized in a painting by [[Benjamin West]]. West made the tree, already a local landmark, famous by incorporating it into his painting after hearing legends (of unknown veracity) about the tree being the location of the treaty. No documentary evidence exists of any treaty Penn signed beneath a particular tree. On 6 March 1810 a great storm blew the tree down. Measurements taken at the time showed it to have a circumference of {{convert|24|ft|m}}, and its age was estimated to be 280 years. Wood from the tree was made into furniture, canes, walking sticks and various trinkets that Philadelphians kept as relics.
* The [[Washington Elm]], [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. [[George Washington]] is said to have taken command of the American [[Continental Army]] under the Washington Elm in Cambridge on 3 July 1775.

* The Tabletop Elm in [[Provo, Utah]]. Immediately south of the Utah County Administration Building and just east of the Historic Utah County Courthouse in downtown Provo resides possibly a one-of-a-kind elm tree. Officially it is a specimen of ''[[Ulmus americana]]'', but is unusual because it grows sideways, making it a "tabletop" elm tree. The tree was planted in 1927, and currently its several branches are supported by specialized braces to allow movement and growth. Every fall seven dump truck loads are required to remove all the leaves. Both reproduction and cloning efforts have been unsuccessful; the tree's seeds do not mature into the tabletop shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.utahcounty.gov/CountyInfo/HistoricTree.html |title=Historic Tree |website=utahcounty.gov|publisher=[[Utah County, Utah|Utah County Government]] |accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ksl.com/?nid=148&amp;sid=11859799&amp;hl=2|title=Utah County working to protect one-of-a-kind tree|last=Cabrero|first=Alex|work=[[KSL-TV|ksl.com]]|publisher=[[Deseret Digital Media]]|location=Salt Lake City|date=4 August 2010|accessdate=15 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wych Elm ''Ulmus glabra''==

* "Joe Pullen's Tree", a wych elm (''[[Ulmus glabra]]'') in [[Oxford]], was planted in about 1700 by the Rev. Josiah Pullen, vice president of Magdalen Hall. Josiah Pullen "used to Walk to that place every day, sometimes twice a day", according to diarist Thomas Hearne. The famous essayist [[Richard Steele]] (1672–1729) said his regular walks as an undergraduate to the elm with Pullen helped him to reach a "florid old age". The elm became famous at Oxford and its fame grew with its age. In November 1795, ''[[Gentleman's Magazine]]'' reported that "Joe Pullen, the famous elm, upon Headington hills, had one of its large branches torn off and carried to a great distance." When new parliamentary district boundaries were drawn after the [[Reform Act 1832]], the tree was named as a landmark helping to mark the boundary of the Parliamentary Borough of Oxford. In early 1847, the owner of the property arranged to have the tree torn down, and work started on it before protests put an end to the plan. By 1892, however, rot had set in, and the tree was torn down to its (large and tall) "stump". Early in the morning of 13 October 1909, vandals set fire to the stump. A plaque was soon after installed on the side wall of Davenport House in Cuckoo Lane, marking the spot. It reads: Near this spot stood the famous elm planted by the Rev. Josiah Pullen about 1680 and known as Jo Pullen's Tree. Destroyed by fire on 13 October 1909.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.headington.org.uk/history/pullens_lane/jo_pullen_tree.htm Joe Pullen's Tree, Headington, Oxford] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305190536/http://www.headington.org.uk/history/pullens_lane/jo_pullen_tree.htm |date=2016-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==English Elm ''Ulmus procera''==

[[File:World Champion English elm.JPG|thumb|The 'Preston Twins', English elms in Brighton, England]]
* The Preston Twins in [[Preston Park, Brighton|Preston Park]], [[Brighton]], England, are the two oldest English elms in the world. Both trees are aged over 400 years and exceed 6 metres in girth. They have been regularly [[Pollarding|pollarded]] for many years and both trunks are hollow. The smaller, nearer the A23 London Road, can be entered from the east side; two people can stand comfortably inside it. The trees may be associated with the Medieval Manorial Scrolls kept in the County Records Office in [[Lewes]].

== Notes ==

Data values are sourced from the individual articles, where available, for each nebula. Please see the article of the nebula in question for data references.

Many distances are estimates (denoted by the ''approx.'' suffix), as true distances are difficult to infer for planetary nebulae. Please see main article, [[Planetary nebulae]], for more details on distance estimates.

{{Greek myth (nymph)}}

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Minthe''' (also '''Menthe''', '''Mintha''' or '''Mentha'''; {{lang-el|Μίνθη}} or Μένθη) was a [[naiad]] associated with the river [[Cocytus]]. 

== Etymology ==
The ''-nth-'' element in ''menthe'' is characteristic of a class of words borrowed from a [[Pre-Greek]] language: compare ''[[Acanthus (plant)|acanthus]]'', [[labyrinth]], [[Corinth]], etc.

== Mythology ==
Minthe was dazzled by [[Hades]] and made an attempt to seduce him, but Queen [[Persephone]] intervened and metamorphosed Minthe, in the words of [[Strabo]]'s account, "into the garden [[mentha|mint]], which some call ''hedyosmon'' (lit. 'sweet-smelling')".&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], ''[[Geographica]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Strab.+8.3.14&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0198 VIII.3.14.]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;''"Mint (Mintha), men say, was once a maid beneath the earth, a Nymphe of Kokytos (Cocytus), and she lay in the bed of Aidoneus [Hades]; but when he raped the maid Persephone from the Aitnaian hill [Mount Etna in Sicily], then she complained loudly with overweening words and raved foolishly for jealousy, and Demeter in anger trampled upon her with her feet and destroyed her. For she had said that she was nobler of form and more excellent in beauty than dark-eyed Persephone and she boasted that Aidoneus would return to her and banish the other from his halls : such infatuation leapt upon her tongue. And from the earth spray the weak herb that bears her name."''&lt;ref&gt;[[Oppian]]'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Oppian/Halieutica/3*.html#482 Halieutica 3. 485 ff]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Culture ==
In ancient Greece, mint was used in funerary rites, together with [[rosemary]] and [[Myrtus|myrtle]], and not simply to offset the smell of decay; mint was an element in the fermented [[barley]] drink called the ''[[kykeon]]'' that was an essential preparatory [[entheogen]] for participants in the [[Eleusinian mysteries]], which offered hope in the [[afterlife]] for initiates.&lt;ref&gt;Kerenyi 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[multiphase flow]] system is one characterized by the simultaneous presence of several [[phase (matter)|phases]], the two-phase system being the simplest case. The term ‘two-component’ is sometimes used to describe flows in which the phases consist of different chemical substances. For example, steam-water flows are two-phase, while air-water flows are two-component. Some two-component flows (mostly liquid-liquid) technically consist of a single phase but are identified as two-phase flows in which the term “phase” is applied to each of the components. Since the same mathematics describes two-phase and two-component flows, the two expressions can be treated as synonymous.

==Multiphase flow versus heat transfer==
The analysis of multiphase systems can include consideration of [[multiphase flow]] and multiphase heat transfer. When all of the phases in a multiphase system exist at the same temperature, multiphase flow is the only concern. However, when the temperatures of the individual phases are different, interphase heat transfer also occurs. 

==Phase-change heat transfer==
If different phases of the same pure substance are present in a multiphase system, interphase heat transfer will result in a change of phase, which is always accompanied by interphase mass transfer. The combination of heat transfer with mass transfer during phase change makes multiphase systems distinctly more challenging than simpler systems. Based on the phases that are involved in the system, phase change problems can be classified as: (1) solid–liquid phase change ([[melting]] and [[solidification]]), (2) solid–vapor phase change ([[Sublimation (chemistry)|sublimation]] and [[Deposition (phase transition)|deposition]]), and (3) liquid–vapor phase change ([[boiling]]/[[evaporation]] and [[condensation]]). Melting and sublimation are also referred to as fluidification because both liquid and vapor are regarded as fluids.

In [[Greek mythology]], the '''Naiads''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|aɪ|æ|d|z|,_|-|ə|d|z}}; [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: Ναϊάδες) are a type of female spirit, or [[nymph]], presiding over fountains, wells, springs, streams, brooks and other bodies of [[fresh water]].

They are distinct from [[river god]]s, who embodied rivers, and the very ancient spirits that inhabited the still waters of marshes, ponds and lagoon-lakes, such as pre-Mycenaean [[Lerna]] in the Argolis.

Naiads were associated with fresh water, as the [[Oceanid|Oceanids]] were with saltwater and the [[Nereid]]s specifically with the [[Mediterranean]], but because the [[ancient Greeks]] thought of the world's waters as all one system, which percolated in from the sea in deep cavernous spaces within the earth, there was some overlap. [[Arethusa (mythology)|Arethusa]], the nymph of a spring, could make her way through subterranean flows from the [[Peloponnesus]], to surface on the island of [[Sicily]].

== Etymology ==
The Greek word is Ναϊάς (''Naiás'', {{IPA-el|na͜a.i.ás|pron}}), plural Ναϊάδες (''Naiades'', {{IPA-el|na͜a.i.ád.es|}}) It derives from νάειν (''náein''), "to flow", or νᾶμα (''nãma''), "running water". "Naiad" has several English pronunciations: {{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|eɪ|æ|d}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|eɪ|ə|d}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|aɪ|æ|d}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|aɪ|ə|d}}.

==Mythology==
{{Greek myth (aquatic nymphs)}}
[[File:John William Waterhouse - Undine.JPG|thumb|left|''[[Ondine (mythology)|Undine]]'', by [[John William Waterhouse]]]]
They were often the object of archaic local cults, worshipped as essential to humans. Boys and girls at coming-of-age ceremonies dedicated their childish locks to the local naiad of the spring. In places like Lerna their waters' ritual cleansings were credited with magical medical properties. Animals were [[sacrifice|ritually drowned]] there. Oracles might be situated by ancient springs.

Naiads could be dangerous: [[Hylas]] of the [[Argo|''Argo'''s]] crew was lost when he was taken by naiads fascinated by his beauty (''see [[#illustration|illustration]]''). The naiads were also known to exhibit jealous tendencies. [[Theocritus]]' story of naiad jealousy was that of a shepherd, [[Daphnis]], who was the lover of [[Nomia (mythology)|Nomia]] or Echenais; Daphnis had on several occasions been unfaithful to Nomia and as revenge she permanently blinded him. [[Salmacis]] forced the youth [[Hermaphroditus]] into a carnal embrace and, when he sought to get away, fused with him.

The water nymph associated with particular springs was known all through Europe in places with no direct connection with Greece, surviving in the [[Celt]]ic wells of northwest Europe that have been rededicated to Saints, and in the medieval [[Melusine]].

Walter Burkert points out, "When in the ''[[Iliad]]'' [xx.4–9] [[Zeus]] calls the gods into assembly on Mount Olympus, it is not only the well-known [[Twelve Olympians|Olympians]] who come along, but also all the nymphs and all the rivers; [[Oceanus|Okeanos]] alone remains at his station",&lt;ref name = Berkert&gt;Burkert, III, 3.3, [https://books.google.com/books?id=sxurBtx6shoC&amp;pg=PA174 p. 174].&lt;/ref&gt; Greek hearers recognized this impossibility as the poet's [[hyperbole]], which proclaimed the universal power of Zeus over the ancient natural world: "the worship of these deities," Burkert confirms, "is limited only by the fact that they are inseparably identified with a specific locality."&lt;ref name = Berkert/&gt;

==Interpretation==
[[Robert Graves]] offered a sociopolitical reading of the common myth-type in which a mythic king is credited with marrying a naiad and founding a city: it was the newly arrived [[Hellenes]] justifying their presence. The loves and rapes of Zeus, according to Graves' readings, record the supplanting of ancient local cults by Olympian ones (Graves 1955, ''passim''). 

So, in the back-story of the myth of [[Aristaeus]], Hypseus, a king of the [[Lapiths]], married Chlidanope, a naiad, who bore him [[Cyrene (mythology)|Cyrene]]. Aristaeus had more than ordinary mortal experience with the naiads: when his bees died in [[Thessaly]], he went to consult them. His aunt Arethusa invited him below the water's surface, where he was washed with water from a perpetual spring and given advice.

'''Radiation pressure''' is the [[pressure]] exerted upon any surface due to the exchange of [[momentum]] between the object and the [[electromagnetic field]]. This includes the momentum of light or [[electromagnetic radiation]] of any [[wavelength]] which is [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorbed]],  [[Reflection (physics)|reflected]], or otherwise emitted (e.g. [[black body radiation]]) by matter on any scale (from macroscopic objects to dust particles to gas molecules).&lt;ref&gt;Stellar Atmospheres, D. Mihalas (1978), Second edition, W H Freeman &amp; Co&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eddington, A. S., &amp; Eddington, A. S. (1988). The internal constitution of the stars. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chandrasekhar, S. (2013). Radiative transfer. Courier Corporation.&lt;/ref&gt;

The forces generated by radiation pressure are generally too small to be noticed under everyday circumstances; however, they are important in some physical processes. This particularly includes objects in [[outer space]] where it is usually the main force acting on objects besides gravity, and where the net effect of a tiny force may have a large cumulative effect over long periods of time. For example, had the effects of the sun's radiation pressure on the spacecraft of the [[Viking program]] been ignored, the spacecraft would have missed Mars orbit by about {{cvt|15000|km|mi}}.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Hecht, "Optics", 4th edition (p. 57)&lt;/ref&gt; Radiation pressure from starlight is crucial in a number of [[astrophysical]] processes as well. The significance of radiation pressure increases rapidly at extremely high temperatures, and can sometimes dwarf the usual [[Kinetic theory of gases|gas pressure]], for instance in [[Stellar structure|stellar interiors]] and [[thermonuclear weapons]].

Radiation pressure can equally well be accounted for by considering the momentum of a classical electromagnetic field or in terms of the momenta of [[photons]], particles of light. The interaction of electromagnetic waves or photons with matter may involve an exchange of [[momentum]]. Due to the law of [[conservation of momentum]], any change in the total momentum of the waves or photons must involve an equal and opposite change in the momentum of the matter it interacted with ([[Newton's third law of motion]]), as is illustrated in the accompanying figure for the case of light being perfectly reflected by a surface. This transfer of momentum is the general explanation for what we term radiation pressure.

== Discovery ==
[[Johannes Kepler]] put forward the concept of radiation pressure back in 1619 to explain the observation that a tail of a [[comet]] always points away from the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Johannes Kepler|author-link=Johannes Kepler|title=[[De Cometis Libelli Tres]]|date=1619}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The assertion that light, as [[electromagnetic radiation]], has the property of [[momentum]] and thus exerts a [[pressure]] upon any surface it is exposed to was published by [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in 1862, and proven experimentally by Russian physicist [[Pyotr Nikolaevich Lebedev|Pyotr Lebedev]] in 1900&lt;ref&gt;P. Lebedev, 1901, "Untersuchungen über die Druckkräfte des Lichtes", Annalen der Physik, 1901&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Ernest Fox Nichols]] and [[Gordon Ferrie Hull]] in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, E.F &amp; Hull, G.F. (1903) [https://books.google.com/books?id=8n8OAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA5-PA327&amp;dq=torsion+balance+radiation The Pressure due to Radiation], ''The Astrophysical Journal'',Vol.17 No.5, p.315-351&lt;/ref&gt; The pressure is very feeble, but can be detected by allowing the radiation to fall upon a delicately poised vane of reflective metal in a [[Nichols radiometer]] (this should not be confused with the [[Crookes radiometer]], whose characteristic motion is ''not'' caused by radiation pressure but by impacting gas molecules).

== Theory ==
{{See also|Electromagnetic radiation|Speed of light}}
Radiation pressure can be viewed as a consequence of the [[conservation of momentum]] given the momentum attributed to electromagnetic radiation. That momentum can be equally well calculated on the basis of electromagnetic theory or from the combined momenta of a stream of photons, giving identical results as is shown below.

=== Radiation pressure from momentum of an electromagnetic wave ===
{{Main|Poynting vector}}
According to Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism, an electromagnetic wave carries momentum, which will be transferred to an opaque surface it strikes.

The energy flux (irradiance) of a plane wave is calculated using the [[Poynting vector]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S} = \mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{H}&lt;/math&gt;, whose magnitude we denote by S. S divided by the [[speed of light]] is the density of the linear momentum per unit area (pressure) of the electromagnetic field. That pressure is experienced as radiation pressure on the surface:

:&lt;math&gt;    P_\text{incident}=\frac{\langle S\rangle}{c} = \frac{I_f}{c}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is pressure (usually in [[Pascals]]), &lt;math&gt;I_f&lt;/math&gt; is the incident [[irradiance]] (usually in W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light]] in vacuum.

If the surface is planar at an angle &amp;alpha; to the incident wave, the intensity across the surface will be geometrically reduced by the cosine of that angle and the component of the radiation force against the surface will also be reduced by the cosine of &amp;alpha;, resulting in a pressure:

:&lt;math&gt; P_\text{incident} = \frac{I_f}{c} \cos^2 \alpha &lt;/math&gt;

The momentum from the incident wave is in the same direction of that wave.  But only the component of that momentum normal to the surface contributes to the pressure on the surface, as given above.  The component of that force tangent to the surface is not called pressure.&lt;ref name="Wright"&gt;

=== Radiation pressure from reflection ===
The above treatment for an incident wave accounts for the radiation pressure experienced by a black (totally absorbing) body. If the wave is [[specularly reflected]], then the recoil due to the reflected wave will further contribute to the radiation pressure. In the case of a perfect reflector, this pressure will be identical to the pressure caused by the incident wave:

:&lt;math&gt;    P_\text{emitted}= \frac{I_f}{c}&lt;/math&gt;

thus ''doubling'' the net radiation pressure on the surface:

:&lt;math&gt;    P_\text{net}=   P_\text{incident} +  P_\text{emitted}= 2 \frac{I_f}{c}&lt;/math&gt;

For a partially reflective surface, the second term must be multiplied by the reflectivity (also known as reflection coefficient of intensity), so that the increase is less than double. For a [[Diffuse reflection|diffusely reflective]] surface, the details of the reflection and geometry must be taken into account, again resulting in an increased net radiation pressure of less than double.

===Radiation pressure by emission===
Just as a wave reflected from a body contributes to the net radiation pressure experienced, a body that emits radiation of its own (rather than reflected) obtains a radiation pressure again given by the irradiance of that emission ''in the direction normal to the surface'' ''I&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'':

:&lt;math&gt;    P_\text{emitted}= \frac{I_e}{c}&lt;/math&gt;

The emission can be from [[black body radiation]] or any other radiative mechanism. Since all materials emit black body radiation (unless they are totally reflective or at absolute zero), this source for radiation pressure is ubiquitous but usually very tiny. However, because black body radiation increases rapidly with temperature (according to the fourth power of temperature as given by the [[Stefan–Boltzmann law]]), radiation pressure due to the temperature of a very hot object (or due to incoming black body radiation from similarly hot surroundings) can become very significant. This becomes important in stellar interiors which are at millions of degrees.

=== Radiation pressure in terms of photons ===
{{See also|Photons|Momentum}}
Electromagnetic radiation can be [[wave–particle duality|viewed]] in terms of particles rather than waves; these particles are known as [[photons]]. Photons do not have a rest-mass, however photons are never at rest (they move at the speed of light) and acquire a momentum nonetheless which is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;
p = \dfrac{h}{\lambda} = \frac{E_p}{c},
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''p'' is momentum, ''h'' is [[Planck's constant]], &amp;lambda; is [[wavelength]], and ''c'' is speed of light in vacuum. And ''E&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the energy of a single photon given by: 
:&lt;math&gt;
E_p = h \nu =\frac{h c}{\lambda}
&lt;/math&gt;

The radiation pressure again can be seen as the transfer of each photon's momentum to the opaque surface, plus the momentum due to a (possible) recoil photon for a (partially) reflecting surface. Since an incident wave of irradiance ''I&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' over an area ''A'' has a power of  ''I&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;A'', this implies a flux of ''I&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;/E&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' photons per second per unit area striking the surface. Combining this with the above expression for the momentum of a single photon, results in the same relationships between irradiance and radiation pressure described above using classical electromagnetics. And again, reflected or otherwise emitted photons will contribute to the net radiation pressure identically.

===Compression in a uniform radiation field===

In general, the pressure of electromagnetic waves can be obtained from the [[Electromagnetic_stress–energy_tensor#Algebraic_properties|vanishing of the trace of the electromagnetic stress tensor]]: Since this trace [[Stress–energy_tensor#Stress–energy_of_a_fluid_in_equilibrium|equals 3''P'' - ''u'']], we get
:&lt;math&gt;P = \frac{u}{3}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''u'' is the radiation density per unit volume. 

This can also be shown in the specific case of the pressure exerted on surfaces of a body in [[thermal equilibrium]] with its surroundings, at a temperature ''T'': The body will be surrounded by a uniform radiation field described by the [[Planck law|Planck black body radiation law]], and will experience a compressive pressure due to that impinging radiation, its reflection, and its own black body emission. From that it can be shown that the resulting pressure is equal to one third of the total radiant energy per unit volume in the surrounding space.&lt;ref&gt;Shankar R., ''Principles of Quantum Mechanics'', 2nd edition.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, Bradley W.  &amp; Dale A. Ostlie, ''An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics'', 2nd edition.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, John David, (1999) ''Classical Electrodynamics''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kardar, Mehran. "Statistical Physics of Particles".&lt;/ref&gt;

By using [[Stefan–Boltzmann law]], this can be expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;P_\text{compress} = \frac{u}{3} = \frac{4\sigma}{3c} T^4 &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Stefan–Boltzmann constant]].

==Solar radiation pressure==

Solar radiation pressure is due to the sun's radiation at closer distances, thus especially within the [[solar system]].  While it acts on all objects, its net effect is generally greater on smaller bodies since they have a larger ratio of surface area to mass.  All spacecraft experience such a pressure except when they are behind the shadow of a larger [[Orbiting body | orbiting body]].

Solar radiation pressure on objects near the earth may be calculated using the sun's [[irradiance]] at 1&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]], known as the [[solar constant]] or ''G&lt;sub&gt;SC&lt;/sub&gt;'', whose value is set at '''1361&amp;nbsp;[[Watt|W]]/[[Metre|m]]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''' as of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All stars have a [[spectral energy distribution]] that depends on their surface temperature.  The distribution is approximately that of [[black-body radiation]].  This distribution must be taken into account when calculating the radiation pressure or identifying reflector materials for optimizing a [[solar sail]] for instance.

===Pressures of absorption and reflection===

Solar radiation pressure at the earth's distance from the sun, may be calculated by dividing the [[solar constant]] ''G&lt;sub&gt;SC&lt;/sub&gt;'' (above) by the [[speed of light]] c.  For an absorbing sheet facing the sun, this is simply:&lt;ref name="RMG"&gt;Georgevic, R. M. (1973) "The Solar Radiation Pressure Forces and Torques Model", ''The Journal of the Astronautical Sciences'', Vol. 27, No. 1, Jan–Feb. First known publication describing how solar radiation pressure creates forces and torques that affect spacecraft.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; P  = \frac{G_\text{SC}}{c}  \approx  4.5 \cdot 10^{-6}  \textsf{ Pa} = 4.5 \mu \textsf{Pa} &lt;/math&gt;

This result is in the [[S.I.]] unit [[Pascals]], equivalent to N/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ([[Newtons]] per square meter). For a sheet at an angle α to the sun, the effective area ''A'' of a sheet is reduced by a geometrical factor resulting in a force ''in the direction of the sunlight'' of:

:&lt;math&gt; F = \frac{G_\text{SC}}{c } (A \cos \alpha)&lt;/math&gt;

To find the component of this force normal to the surface, another cosine factor must be applied resulting in a pressure ''P'' on the surface of:

:&lt;math&gt; P  =  \frac{F}{A} = \frac{G_\text{SC}}{c} \cos^2 \alpha &lt;/math&gt;

Note, however, that in order to account for the net effect of solar radiation on a spacecraft for instance, one would need to consider the ''total'' force (in the direction away from the sun) given by the preceding equation, rather than just the component normal to the surface that we identify as "pressure".

The solar constant is defined for the sun's radiation at the distance to the earth, also known as one [[astronomical unit]] (AU). Consequently, at a distance of ''R'' astronomical units (''R'' thus being dimensionless), applying the [[inverse square law]], we would find:

:&lt;math&gt; P  = \frac{G_\text{SC}}{c R^2} \cos^2 \alpha&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, considering not an absorbing but a perfectly reflecting surface, the pressure is ''doubled'' due to the reflected wave, resulting in:

:&lt;math&gt; P  = 2\frac{G_\text{SC}}{c R^2} \cos^2 \alpha&lt;/math&gt;

Note that unlike the case of an absorbing material, the resulting force on a reflecting body is given exactly by this pressure acting normal to the surface, with the tangential forces from the incident and reflecting waves canceling each other. In practice, materials are neither totally reflecting nor totally absorbing, so the resulting force will be a weighted average of the forces calculated using these formulae.

===Radiation pressure perturbations===
{{See also|Yarkovsky effect|YORP effect|Poynting–Robertson effect}}

Solar radiation pressure is a source of [[Perturbation (astronomy)|orbital perturbations]].  It significantly affects the orbits and trajectories of small bodies including all spacecraft.

Solar radiation pressure affects bodies throughout much of the Solar System.  Small bodies are more affected than large because of their lower mass relative to their surface area.  Spacecraft are affected along with natural bodies (comets, asteroids, dust grains, gas molecules).

The radiation pressure results in forces and torques on the bodies that can change their translational and rotational motions.  Translational changes affect the orbits of the bodies.  Rotational rates may increase or decrease.  Loosely aggregated bodies may break apart under high rotation rates.  Dust grains can either leave the Solar System or spiral into the Sun.

A whole body is typically composed of numerous surfaces that have different orientations on the body.  The facets may be flat or curved.  They will have different areas.  They may have optical properties differing from other aspects.

At any particular time, some facets will be exposed to the Sun and some will be in shadow.  Each surface exposed to the Sun will be reflecting, absorbing, and emitting radiation.  Facets in shadow will be emitting radiation.  The summation of pressures across all of the facets will define the net force and torque on the body.  These can be calculated using the equations in the preceding sections.&lt;ref name="Wright" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RMG" /&gt;

The [[Yarkovsky effect]] affects the translation of a small body.  It results from a face leaving solar exposure being at a higher temperature than a face approaching solar exposure.  The radiation emitted from the warmer face will be more intense than that of the opposite face, resulting in a net force on the body that will affect its motion.

The [[YORP effect]] is a collection of effects expanding upon the earlier concept of the Yarkovsky effect, but of a similar nature.  It affects the spin properties of bodies.

The [[Poynting–Robertson effect]] applies to grain-size particles.  From the perspective of a grain of dust circling the Sun, the Sun's radiation appears to be coming from a slightly forward direction ([[aberration of light]]). Therefore, the absorption of this radiation leads to a force with a component against the direction of movement. (The angle of aberration is tiny since the radiation is moving at the speed of light while the dust grain is moving many orders of magnitude slower than that.)  The result is a gradual spiral of dust grains into the Sun.  Over long periods of time, this effect cleans out much of the dust in the Solar System.

While rather small in comparison to other forces, the radiation pressure force is inexorable.  Over long periods of time, the net effect of the force is substantial.  Such feeble pressures can produce marked effects upon minute particles like [[gas]] [[ion]]s and [[electron]]s, and are essential in the theory of electron emission from the Sun, of [[comet]]ary material, and so on.

Because the ratio of surface area to volume (and thus mass) increases with decreasing particle size, dusty ([[micrometre]]-size) particles are susceptible to radiation pressure even in the outer solar system.  For example, the evolution of the [[Rings of Saturn#Outer rings|outer rings of Saturn]] is significantly influenced by radiation pressure.

As a consequence of light pressure, [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Einstein, A.|title=On the development of our views concerning the nature and constitution of radiation. Translated in: The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, vol. 2 (Princeton University Press, Princeton, 1989)|date=1909|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=391}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1909 predicted the existence of "radiation friction" which would oppose the movement of matter. He wrote, “radiation will exert pressure on both sides of the plate. The forces of pressure exerted on the two sides are equal if the plate is at rest. However, if it is in motion, more radiation will be reflected on the surface that is ahead during the motion (front surface) than on the back surface. The backward acting force of pressure exerted on the front surface is thus larger than the force of pressure acting on the back. Hence, as the resultant of the two forces, there remains a force that counteracts the motion of the plate and that increases with the velocity of the plate. We will call this resultant 'radiation friction' in brief.”

===Solar sails===
{{main|Solar sail}}
Solar sailing, an experimental method of [[spacecraft propulsion]], uses radiation pressure from the Sun as a motive force. The idea of interplanetary travel by light was mentioned by [[Jules Verne]] in ''From the Earth to the Moon''.

A sail reflects about 90% of the incident radiation.  The 10% that is absorbed is radiated away from both surfaces, with the proportion emitted from the unlit surface depending on the thermal conductivity of the sail.  A sail has curvature, surface irregularities, and other minor factors that affect its performance.

The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency ([[JAXA]]) has successfully unfurled a solar sail in space which has already succeeded in propelling its payload with the [[IKAROS]] project.

==Cosmic effects of radiation pressure==

Radiation pressure has had a major effect on the development of the cosmos, from the birth of the universe to ongoing formation of stars and shaping of clouds of dust and gasses on a wide range of scales.

===The early universe===

The [[photon epoch]] is a phase when the energy of the universe was dominated by photons, between 10 seconds and 380,000 years after the [[Big Bang]].

===Galaxy formation and evolution===

The process of [[galaxy formation and evolution]] began early in the history of the cosmos. Observations of the early universe strongly suggest that objects grew from bottom-up (i.e., smaller objects merging to form larger ones). As stars are thereby formed and become sources of electromagnetic radiation, radiation pressure from the stars becomes a factor in the dynamics of remaining [[Circumstellar disc|circumstellar]] material.

===Clouds of dust and gases===
[[File:Pillars 2014 HST denoise 0.6 12.jpg|thumb|The ''Pillars of Creation'' clouds within the [[Eagle Nebula]] shaped by radiation pressure and stellar winds.]]
The [[gravitational compression]] of clouds of dust and gases is strongly influenced by radiation pressure, especially when the condensations lead to star births.  The larger young stars forming within the compressed clouds emit intense levels of radiation that shift the clouds, causing either dispersion or condensations in nearby regions, which influences birth rates in those nearby regions.

===Clusters of stars===
&lt;!--[[File:M92 arp 750pix.jpg|thumb|250px|Star cluster [[Messier 92]].]]--&gt;
Stars predominantly form in regions of large clouds of dust and gases, giving rise to [[star cluster]]s.  Radiation pressure from the member stars eventually disperses the clouds, which can have a profound effect on the evolution of the cluster.

Many [[open cluster]]s are inherently unstable, with a small enough mass that the [[escape velocity]] of the system is lower than the average [[velocity]] of the constituent stars. These clusters will rapidly disperse within a few million years. In many cases, the stripping away of the gas from which the cluster formed by the radiation pressure of the hot young stars reduces the cluster mass enough to allow rapid dispersal.

===Star formation===

[[Star formation]] is the process by which dense regions within [[molecular cloud]]s in [[interstellar space]] collapse to form [[star]]s. As a branch of [[astronomy]], star formation includes the study of the [[interstellar medium]] and [[giant molecular cloud]]s (GMC) as precursors to the star formation process, and the study of [[protostar]]s and [[young stellar object]]s as its immediate products.  Star formation theory, as well as accounting for the formation of a single star, must also account for the statistics of [[binary star]]s and the [[initial mass function]].

===Stellar planetary systems===
[[File:David A. Aguilar's Red Dwarf Stars.jpg|thumb|A protoplanetary disk with a cleared central region (artist's conception).]]
[[Planetary system]]s are generally believed to form as part of the same process that results in [[star formation]]. A [[protoplanetary disk]] forms by gravitational collapse of a [[molecular cloud]], called a [[solar nebula]],  and then evolves into a planetary system by collisions and gravitational capture. Radiation pressure can clear a region in the immediate vicinity of the star. As the formation process continues, radiation pressure continues to play a role in affecting the distribution of matter.  In particular, dust and grains can spiral into the star or escape the stellar system under the action of radiation pressure.

===Stellar interiors===

In [[star|stellar]] interiors the temperatures are very high. Stellar models predict a temperature of 15&amp;nbsp;MK in the center of the [[Sun]], and at the cores of [[supergiant]] stars the temperature may exceed 1&amp;nbsp;GK. As the radiation pressure scales as the fourth power of the temperature, it becomes important at these high temperatures. In the Sun, radiation pressure is still quite small when compared to the gas pressure. In the heaviest non-degenerate stars, radiation pressure is the dominant pressure component.&lt;ref&gt;Dale A. Ostlie and Bradley W. Carroll, ''An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics'' (2nd edition), page 341, Pearson, San Francisco, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comets===
[[File:Comet Hale-Bopp 1995O1.jpg|thumb|[[Comet Hale–Bopp]] (C/1995 O1). Radiation pressure and solar wind effects on the dust and gas tails are clearly seen.]]
Solar radiation pressure strongly affects [[comet tail]]s.  Solar heating causes gases to be released from the [[comet nucleus]], which also carry away dust grains.  Radiation pressure and [[solar wind]] then drive the dust and gases away from the Sun's direction.  The gases form a generally straight tail, while slower moving dust particles create a broader, curving tail.

== Laser applications of radiation pressure==

=== Optical tweezers===

Lasers can be used as a source of monochromatic light with wavelength &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;. With a set of lenses, one can focus the laser beam to a point that is &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; in diameter (or &lt;math&gt;r = \frac{\lambda}{2}&lt;/math&gt;). 

The radiation pressure of a 30 mW laser of 1064 nm can therefore be computed as follows: 

&lt;math&gt;A_{rea} = \pi\left(\frac{\lambda}{2}\right)^2 \approx 10^{-12} \text{ m}^2 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;F_{orce} = \frac{P_{ower}} {c} = \frac{30 \text{ mW}} {299792458 \text{ m/s}} \approx 10^{-10} \text{ N}  &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;P_{ressure} = \frac{F_{orce}} {A_{rea}} \approx \frac{10^{-10} \text{ N}} {10^{-12} \text{ m}^2} = 100 \text{ Pascal}&lt;/math&gt;

This is used in [[optical tweezers]]. 

=== Other examples===
[[Laser cooling]] is applied to cooling materials very close to absolute zero.  Atoms traveling towards a laser light source perceive a [[doppler effect]] tuned to the absorption frequency of the target element. The radiation pressure on the atom slows movement in a particular direction until the Doppler effect moves out of the frequency range of the element, causing an overall cooling effect.

Large lasers operating in space have been suggested as a means of propelling sail craft in [[beam-powered propulsion]].

The reflection of a laser pulse from the surface of an elastic solid gives rise to various types of elastic waves that propagate inside the solid. The weakest waves are generally those that are generated by the radiation pressure acting during the reflection of the light. Recently, such light-pressure-induced elastic waves were observed inside an ultrahigh-reflectivity [[dielectric mirror]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Požar |first1=T. |last2=Možina |first2=J. |title=Measurement of Elastic Waves Induced by the Reflection of Light. |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=111 |issue=18 |page=185501 |doi=10.1103/Physrevlett.111.185501}}&lt;/ref&gt; These waves are the most basic fingerprint of a light-solid matter interaction on the macroscopic scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Požar |first1=T. |last2=Laloš |first2=J. |last3=Babnik |first3=A. |last4=Petkovšek |first4=R. |last5=Bethune-Waddell |first5=M. |last6=Chau |first6=K.

Thus, it lies above or under the current [[sea level]], depending on the time of its formation.&lt;ref name="Strahler2005"&gt;Strahler AH; Strahler AN (2005): ''Physische Geographie.''

A raised beach is an [[emergent coastline|emergent coastal]] [[landform]]. Raised beaches and marine terraces are [[beach]]es or [[wave-cut platform]]s raised above the shoreline by a relative fall in the [[Past sea level|sea level]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdnhm.org/research/paleontology/sdshoreline.html|title=The Nat -|author=|date=|website=www.sdnhm.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the world, a combination of tectonic coastal uplift and [[Quaternary]] [[eustacy|sea-level fluctuations]] has resulted in the formation of marine terrace sequences, most of which were formed during separate interglacial highstands that can be correlated to [[marine isotope stage]]s (MIS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Johnson | first1 = ME | last2 = Libbey | first2 = LK | year = 1997 | title = Global review of Upper Pleistocene (Substage 5e) Rocky Shores: tectonic segregation, substrate variation and biological diversity | url = | journal = Journal of Coastal Research | volume =  | issue = | page =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A marine terrace commonly retains a shoreline angle or inner edge, the slope inflection between the marine abrasion platform and the associated paleo sea-cliff. The shoreline angle represents the maximum shoreline of a transgression and therefore a paleo-sea level.

The platform of a marine terrace usually has a gradient between 1°{{ndash}}5° depending on the former [[Tide|tidal]] range with, commonly, a linear to concave profile. The width is quite variable, reaching up to {{convert|1000|m|ft}}, and seems to differ between the [[Northern Hemisphere|northern]] and [[Southern Hemisphere|southern hemisphere]]s.&lt;ref name="pethic1984"&gt;Pethick, J (1984): ''An Introduction to Coastal Geomorphology.''

Arnold&amp;Oxford University Press Inc., London, 354p.&lt;/ref&gt; At the intersection of the former [[Wave-cut platform|shore (wave-cut/abrasion-) platform]] and the rising cliff face the platform commonly retains a shoreline angle or inner edge (notch) that indicates the location of the shoreline at the time of maximum sea ingression and therefore a paleo-[[sea level]].&lt;ref name="Cantalamessa2003"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cantalamessa | first1 = G | last2 = Di Celma | first2 = C | year = 2003 | title = 'Origin and chronology of Pleistocene marine terraces of Isla de la Plata and of flat, gently dipping surfaces of the southern coast of Cabo San Lorenzo (Manabí, Ecuador)' | url = | journal = Journal of South American Earth Sciences | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 633–648 | doi = 10.1016/j.jsames.2003.12.007 | bibcode = 2004JSAES..16..633C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sub-horizontal platforms usually terminate in a low tide cliff, and it is believed that the occurrence of these platforms depends on tidal activity.&lt;ref name="Masselink2003" /&gt; Marine terraces can extend for several tens of kilometers parallel to the [[coast]].&lt;ref name="Strahler2005" /&gt;

Older terraces are covered by marine and/or [[Alluvium|alluvial]] or [[Colluvium|colluvial]] materials while the uppermost terrace levels usually are less well preserved.&lt;ref name="Ota1991"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ota | first1 = Y | last2 = Hull | first2 = AG | last3 = Berryman | first3 = KR | year = 1991 | title = 'Coseismic Uplift of Holocene Marine Terraces in the Pakarae River Area, Eastern North Island, New Zealand' | url = | journal = Quaternary Research | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 331–346 | doi = 10.1016/0033-5894(91)90049-B | bibcode = 1991QuRes..35..331O }}&lt;/ref&gt; While marine terraces in areas of relatively rapid uplift rates (&gt;&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;mm/year) can often be correlated to individual [[interglacial]] periods or stages, those in areas of slower uplift rates may have a polycyclic origin with stages of returning [[sea level]]s following periods of exposure to [[weathering]].&lt;ref name="Pirazzoli2005a" /&gt;

Marine terraces can be covered by a wide variety of [[soil]]s with complex histories and different ages. In protected areas, [[Allochthon|allochtonous]] sandy parent materials from [[tsunami deposit]]s may be found. Common soil types found on marine terraces include [[planosols]] and [[solonetz]].&lt;ref name="Finkl2005"&gt;Finkl, CW (2005): 'Coastal Soils' in Schwartz, ML (ed) ''Encyclopedia of Coastal Science.''

== Formation ==

It is now widely thought that marine terraces are formed during the separated highstands of [[interglacial]] stages correlated to [[marine isotope stage]]s (MIS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = James | first1 = N.P. | last2 = Mountjoy | first2 = E.W. | last3 = Omura | first3 = A. | year = 1971 | title = An early Wisconsin reef Terrace at Barbados, West Indies, and its climatic implications | url = | journal = Geological Society of America Bulletin | volume = 82 | issue = | pages = 2011–2018 | doi=10.1130/0016-7606(1971)82[2011:aewrta]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chappell | first1 = J | year = 1974 | title = Geology of coral terraces, Huon Peninsula, New Guinea: a study of Quaternary tectonic movements and sea Level changes | url = | journal = Geological Society of America Bulletin | volume = 85 | issue = | pages = 553–570 | doi=10.1130/0016-7606(1974)85&lt;553:gocthp&gt;2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bull, W.B., 1985.

[[Image:Phanerozoic Sea Level.png|thumb|right|300px|alt=Sea Level Reconstruction|Comparison of two [[Sea-level curve|sea level reconstructions]] during the last 500{{nbsp}}Ma. The scale of change during the last glacial/interglacial transition is indicated with a black bar.]]

The formation of marine terraces is controlled by changes in environmental conditions and by [[Tectonics|tectonic activity]] during recent [[Geologic time scale|geological times]]. [[Climate change|Changes in climatic conditions]] have led to eustatic sea-level oscillations and isostatic movements of the [[Crust (geology)|Earth’s crust]], especially with the changes between [[Glacial period|glacial]] and [[interglacial]] periods.

Processes of [[eustasy]] lead to glacioeustatic sea level fluctuations due to changes of the water volume in the oceans and hence to [[Marine regression|regressions]] and [[Marine transgression|transgressions]] of the shoreline. At times of maximum glacial extent during the [[last glacial period]], the [[sea level]] was about {{convert|100|m|ft}} lower compared to today. [[Eustasy|Eustatic]] [[Sea-level curve|sea level changes]] can also be caused by changes in the void volume of the oceans, either through sedimento-eustasy or tectono-eustasy.&lt;ref name="Ahnert1996"&gt;Ahnert, F (1996) – ''Einführung in die Geomorphologie.'' Ulmer, Stuttgart, 440 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

Processes of [[isostasy]] involve the uplift of [[continental crust]]s along with their shorelines. Today, the process of [[Post-glacial rebound|glacial isostatic adjustment]] mainly applies to [[Pleistocene]] glaciated areas.&lt;ref name="Ahnert1996" /&gt; In [[Scandinavia]], for instance, the present rate of uplift reaches up to {{convert|10|mm|in}}/year.&lt;ref name="Lehmkuhl2007"&gt;Lehmkuhl, F; Römer, W (2007): 'Formenbildung durch endogene Prozesse: Neotektonik', in Gebhardt, H; Glaser, R; Radtke, U; Reuber, P (ed) ''Geographie, Physische Geographie und Humangeographie.'' Elsevier, München, pp. 316-320&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, eustatic marine terraces were formed during separate [[sea level]] highstands of [[interglacial]] stages&lt;ref name="Ahnert1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="James1971"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = James | first1 = NP | last2 = Mountjoy | first2 = EW | last3 = Omura | first3 = A | year = 1971 | title = 'An Early Wisconsin Reef Terrace at Barbados, West Indies, and ist Climatic Implications' | url = | journal = Geological Society of America Bulletin | volume = 82 | issue = | pages = 2011–2018 | doi = 10.1130/0016-7606(1971)82[2011:AEWRTA]2.0.CO;2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be correlated to [[Marine isotope stage|marine oxygene isotopic stages (MIS)]].&lt;ref name="Johnson1997"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Johnson | first1 = ME | last2 = Libbey | first2 = LK | year = 1997 | title = Global Review of Upper Pleistocene (Substage 5e) Rocky Shores: Tectonic Segregation, Substrate Variation, and Biological Diversity | url = | journal = Journal of Coastal Research | volume = 13 | issue = 2| pages = 297–307 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Muhs1990"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Muhs | first1 = D | last2 = Kelsey | first2 = H | last3 = Miller | first3 = G | last4 = Kennedy | first4 = G | last5 = Whelan | first5 = J | last6 = McInelly | first6 = G | year = 1990 | title = 'Age Estimates and Uplift Rates for Late Pleistocene Marine Terraces' Southern Oregon Portion of the Cascadia Forearc' | url = | journal = Journal of Geophysical Research | volume = 95 | issue = B5| pages = 6685–6698 | doi=10.1029/jb095ib05p06685 | bibcode=1990JGR....95.6685M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glacioisostatic marine terraces were mainly created during stillstands of the isostatic uplift.&lt;ref name="Ahnert1996" /&gt; When [[eustasy]] was the main factor for the formation of marine terraces, derived [[sea level]] fluctuations can indicate former [[climate change]]s. This conclusion has to be treated with care, as [[Post-glacial rebound|isostatic adjustment]]s and [[Tectonics|tectonic activities]] can be extensively overcompensated by a eustatic sea level rise. Thus, in areas of both [[Eustasy|eustatic]] and [[Isostasy|isostatic]] or [[Tectonics|tectonic]] influences, the course of the relative sea level curve can be complicated.&lt;ref name="Worsley1998"&gt;Worsley, P (1998): 'Altersbestimmung - Küstenterrassen', in Goudie, AS (ed) ''Geomorphologie, Ein Methodenhandbuch für Studium und Praxis.'' Springer, Heidelberg, pp. 528-550&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, most of today's marine terrace sequences were formed by a combination of tectonic coastal uplift and [[Quaternary]] sea level fluctuations.

Jerky [[Tectonics|tectonic]] uplifts can also lead to marked terrace steps while smooth relative [[sea level]] changes may not result in obvious terraces, and their formations are often not referred to as marine terraces.&lt;ref name="Cantalamessa2003" /&gt;

=== Processes ===

Marine terraces often result from [[Erosion#Shoreline|marine erosion]] along rocky coast lines&lt;ref name="Pirazzoli2005a" /&gt; in [[temperate region]]s due to wave attack and [[sediment]] carried in the waves. [[Erosion]] also takes place in connection with [[weathering]] and [[cavitation]]. The speed of erosion is highly dependent on the shoreline material (hardness of rock&lt;ref name="Masselink2003" /&gt;), the [[bathymetry]], and the [[bedrock]] properties and can be between only a few millimeters per year for [[Granite|granitic]] rocks and more than {{convert|10|m|ft}} per year for [[Volcanic rock|volcanic ejecta]].&lt;ref name="Masselink2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Anderson1999"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Anderson | first1 = RS | last2 = Densmore | first2 = AL | last3 = Ellis | first3 = MA | year = 1999 | title = 'The Generation and degradation of Marine Terraces' | url = | journal = Basin Research | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 7–19 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2117.1999.00085.x | bibcode = 1999BasR...11....7A }}&lt;/ref&gt; The retreat of the sea [[cliff]] generates a [[Wave-cut platform|shore (wave-cut/abrasion-) platform]] through the process of [[Abrasion (geology)|abrasion]]. A relative change of the [[sea level]] leads to [[Marine regression|regressions]] or [[Marine transgression|transgressions]] and eventually forms another terrace (marine-cut terrace) at a different altitude while notches in the cliff face indicate short stillstands.&lt;ref name="Anderson1999" /&gt;

It is believed that the terrace gradient increases with [[Tide|tidal]] range and decreases with rock resistance. In addition, the relationship between terrace width and the strength of the rock is inverse, and higher rates of uplift and subsidence as well as a higher slope of the [[hinterland]] increases the number of terraces formed during a certain time.&lt;ref name="Trenhaile2002"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Trenhaile | first1 = AS | year = 2002 | title = 'Modeling the development of marine terraces on tectonically mobile rock coasts' | url = | journal = Marine Geology | volume = 185 | issue = | pages = 341–361 | doi = 10.1016/S0025-3227(02)00187-1 | bibcode = 2002MGeol.185..341T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, [[Wave-cut platform|shore platforms]] are formed by [[denudation]] and marine-built terraces arise from accumulations of materials removed by [[Erosion#Shoreline|shore erosion]].&lt;ref name="Pirazzoli2005a" /&gt;  Thus a marine terrace can be formed by both [[erosion]] and accumulation. However, there is an ongoing debate about the roles of [[Erosion#Shoreline|wave erosion]] and [[weathering]] in the formation of [[Wave-cut platform|shore platforms]].&lt;ref name="Masselink2003" /&gt;

[[Reef flat#Reef flat|Reef flats]] or uplifted coral reefs are another kind of marine terrace found in intertropical regions. They are a result of biological activity, shoreline advance and accumulation of [[reef]] materials.&lt;ref name="Pirazzoli2005a" /&gt;

While a terrace sequence can date back hundreds of thousands of years, its degradation is a rather fast process. On the one hand a deeper transgression of cliffs into the shoreline may completely destroy previous terraces; on the other hand older terraces might be decayed&lt;ref name="Anderson1999" /&gt; or covered by deposits, [[colluvium|colluvia]] or [[alluvial fan]]s.&lt;ref name="Strahler2005" /&gt;  Erosion and backwearing of slopes caused by incisive streams play another important role in this degradation process.&lt;ref name="Anderson1999" /&gt;

=== Land and sea level history ===
The total displacement of the shoreline relative to the age of the associated interglacial stage allows calculation of a mean uplift rate or the calculation of eustatic level at a particular time if the uplift is known.

In order to estimate vertical uplift, the eustatic position of the considered paleo sea levels relative to the present one must be known as precisely as possible. Our chronology relies principally on relative dating based on geomorphologic criteria but in all cases we associated the shoreline angle of the marine terraces with numerical ages. The best-represented terrace worldwide is the one correlated to the last interglacial maximum (MISS 5e) (Hearty and Kindler, 1995; Johnson and Libbey, 1997, Pedoja et al., 2006 a,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pedoja | first1 = K. | last2 = Bourgeois | first2 = J. | last3 = Pinegina | first3 = T. | last4 = Higman | first4 = B. | year = 2006 | title = Does Kamchatka belong to North America?

Age of MISS 5e is arbitrarily fixed to range from 130 to 116 ka (Kukla et al., 2002&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kukla | first1 = G.J. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2002 | title = Last Interglacial Climates | url = | journal = Quaternary Research | volume = 58 | issue = | pages = 2–13 | doi=10.1006/qres.2001.2316| bibcode = 2002QuRes..58....2K }}&lt;/ref&gt;) but is demonstrated to range from 134 to 113 ka in Hawaii and Barbados (Muhs et al., 2002) with a peak from 128 to 116 ka on tectonically stable coastlines (Muhs, 2002). Older marine terraces well represented in worldwide sequences are those related to MIS 9 (~303-339 ka) and 11 (~362-423 ka) (Imbrie et al., 1984&lt;ref&gt;Imbrie, J. et al., 1984. The orbital theory of Pleistocene climate: support from revised chronology of the marine 18O record. In: A. Berger, J. Imbrie, J.D. Hays, G. Kukla and B. Saltzman (Editors), Milankovitch and Climate. Reidel, Dordrecht, pp. 269–305.&lt;/ref&gt;). Compilations show that sea level was 3 ± 3 meters higher during MISS 5e, MIS 9 and 11 than during the present one and –1 ± 1 m to the present one during MIS 7 (Hearty and Kindler, 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hearty | first1 = P.J. | last2 = Kindler | first2 = P. | year = 1995 | title = Sea-Level Highstand Chronology from Stable Carbonate Platforms (Bermuda and the Bahamas) | url = | journal = Journal of coastal research | volume = 11 | issue = 3| pages = 675–689 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Zazo, 1999&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zazo | first1 = C | year = 1999 | title = Interglacial sea levels | url = | journal = Quaternary International | volume = 55 | issue = | pages = 101–113 | doi=10.1016/s1040-6182(98)00031-7| bibcode = 1999QuInt..55..101Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Consequently, MIS 7 (~180-240 ka; Imbrie et al., 1984) marine terraces are less pronounced and sometimes absent (Zazo, 1999). When the elevations of these terraces are higher than the uncertainties in paleo-eustatic sea level mentioned for the Holocene and Late Pleistocene, these uncertainties have no effect on overall interpretation.

Sequence can also occurs where the accumulation of ice sheets have depressed the land so that when the ice sheets melts the land readjusts with time thus raising the height of the beaches (glacio-isostatic rebound)and in places where co-seismic uplift occur. In the latter case, the terrace are not correlated with sea level highstand even if co-seismic terrace are known only for the Holocene.

== Mapping and surveying ==

[[Image:Coast south of Wellington by Phillip Capper Flickr.jpg|thumb|right|200px|alt=Tongue Point New Zealand|Aerial photograph of lowest marine terrace at Tongue Point, [[New Zealand]]]]

For exact interpretations of the morphology extensive datings, surveying and mapping of marine terraces is applied. This includes [[Stereoscopy|stereoscopic]] [[Aerial photographic and satellite image interpretation|aerial photographic interpretation]] (ca. 1 : 10,000 - 25,000&lt;ref name="Cantalamessa2003" /&gt;), on-site inspections with [[topographic map]]s (ca. 1 : 10,000) and analysis of eroded and accumulated material. Moreover, the exact altitude can be determined with an [[Aneroid barometer#Aneroid barometers|aneroid barometer]] or preferably with a levelling instrument mounted on a tripod. It should be measured with the accuracy of {{Convert|1|cm||abbr=on}} and at about every {{Convert|50-100|m|}}, depending on the topography. In remote areas technics of [[photogrammetry]] and [[tacheometry]] can be applied.&lt;ref name="Worsley1998" /&gt;

== Correlation and dating ==

Different methods for dating and correlation of marine terraces can be used and combined.

=== Correlational dating ===

The morphostratigraphic approach focuses especially in regions of [[marine regression]] on the altitude as the most important criterion to distinguish coast lines of different ages. Moreover, individual marine terraces can be correlated based on their size and continuity. Also paleo-soils as well as [[Glacial landform|glacial]], [[Fluvial landform#Fluvial landforms|fluvial]], [[Eolian landforms|eolian]] and [[periglacial]] landforms and [[sediment]]s may be used to find correlations between terraces.&lt;ref name="Worsley1998" /&gt;  On [[New Zealand - North Island|New Zealand’s North Island]], for instance, [[tephra]] and [[loess]] were used to date and correlate marine terraces.&lt;ref name="Berryman1992"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Berryman | first1 = K | year = 1992 | title = 'A stratigraphic age of Rotoehu Ash and late Pleistocene climate interpretation based on marine terrace chronology, Mahia Peninsula, North Island, New Zealand' | url = | journal = New Zealand Journal of Geology and Geophysics | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 1–7 | doi = 10.1080/00288306.1992.9514494 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the terminus advance of former [[glacier]]s marine terraces can be correlated by their size, as their width decreases with age due to the slowly thawing glaciers along the coast line.&lt;ref name="Worsley1998" /&gt;

The [[Lithostratigraphy|lithostratigraphic]] approach uses typical sequences of [[sediment]] and [[rock strata]] to prove [[sea level]] fluctuations on the basis of an alternation of terrestrial and [[marine sediments]] or littoral and shallow marine sediments. Those strata show typical layers of transgressive and regressive patterns.&lt;ref name="Worsley1998" /&gt;  However, an [[unconformity]] in the sediment sequence might make this analysis difficult.&lt;ref name="Bhattacharya2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bhattacharya | first1 = JP | last2 = Sheriff | first2 = RE | year = 2011 | title = 'Practical problems in the application of the sequence stratigraphic method and key surfaces: integrating observations from ancient fluvial–deltaic wedges with Quaternary and modelling studies' | url = | journal = Sedimentology | volume = 58 | issue = | pages = 120–169 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-3091.2010.01205.x | bibcode = 2011Sedim..58..120B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Biostratigraphy|biostratigraphic]] approach uses remains of organisms which can indicate the age of a marine terrace. For that often [[mollusc shell]]s, [[foraminifera]] or [[pollen]] are used. Especially [[Mollusca]] can show specific properties depending on their depth of [[sedimentation]]. Thus they can be used to estimate former water depths.&lt;ref name="Worsley1998" /&gt;

Marine terraces are often correlated to [[Marine isotope stage|marine oxygene isotopic stages (MIS)]] (e.g. Johnson, M. E.; Libbey, L. K. 1997&lt;ref name="Johnson1997" /&gt;) and can also be roughly dated using their stratigraphic position.&lt;ref name="Worsley1998" /&gt;

=== Direct dating ===

There are various methods for the direct dating of marine terraces and their related materials including &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C [[radiocarbon dating]], which is the most common one.&lt;ref name="Schellmann2005"&gt;Schellmann, G; Brückner, H (2005): 'Geochronology', in Schwartz, ML (ed) ''Encyclopedia of Coastal Science.'' Springer, Dordrecht, pp. 467-472&lt;/ref&gt;  E.g. this method has been used on the [[New Zealand - North Island|North Island of New Zealand]] to date several marine terraces.&lt;ref name="Ota1992"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ota | first1 = Y | year = 1992 | title = Holocene marine terraces on the northeast coast of North Island, New Zealand, and their tectonic significance | url = | journal = New Zealand Journal of Geology and Geophysics | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 273–288 | doi = 10.1080/00288306.1992.9514521 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It utilizes terrestrial [[Biogenic substance|biogenic materials]] in coastal [[sediment]]s such as [[mollusc shell]]s analyzing the &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C [[isotope]].&lt;ref name="Worsley1998" /&gt;  In some cases dating based on the &lt;sup&gt;230&lt;/sup&gt;Th/&lt;sup&gt;234&lt;/sup&gt;U ratio was applied though in case of [[Detritus (geology)|detrital]] contamination or low [[uranium]] concentrations a high resolution dating was found to be difficult.&lt;ref name="Garnett2003"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Garnett | first1 = ER | last2 = Gilmour | first2 = MA | last3 = Rowe | first3 = PJ | last4 = Andrews | first4 = JE | last5 = Preece | first5 = RC | year = 2003 | title = 230Th/234U dating of Holocene tufas: possibilities and problems | url = | journal = Quaternary Science Reviews | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 947–958 | doi = 10.1016/j.quascirev.2003.06.018 | bibcode = 2004QSRv...23..947G }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a study in southern [[Italy]] [[paleomagnetism]] was used to carry out paleomagnetic datings&lt;ref name="Brückner1980"&gt;Brückner, H (1980): 'Marine Terrassen in Süditalien.

In order to calculate the eustatic [[sea level]] for each dated terrace it is assumed that the eustatic sea-level position corresponding to at least one marine terrace is known and that the uplift rate has remained essentially constant in each section.&lt;ref name="Pirazzoli2005a" /&gt;

== Relevance for other research areas ==

[[file:Terraza marina choapa.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Marine terraces south of [[Choapa River]] in Chile. These terraces have been studied among others by [[Roland Paskoff]].]]
Marine terraces play an important role in the research on [[tectonics]] and [[earthquakes]]. They may show patterns and rates of tectonic uplift&lt;ref name="Grove2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Saillard2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Saillard2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Saillard | first1 = M | last2 = Hall | first2 = SR | last3 = Audin | first3 = L | last4 = Farber | first4 = DL | last5 = Regard | first5 = V | last6 = Hérail | first6 = G | year = 2011 | title = Andean coastal uplift and active tectonics in southern Peru: &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Be surface exposure dating of differentially uplifted marine terrace sequences (San Juan de Marcona, ~15.4°S) | doi = 10.1016/j.geomorph.2011.01.004 | journal = Geomorphology | volume = 128 | issue = | pages = 178–190 | bibcode = 2011Geomo.128..178S }}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus may be used to estimate the [[Tectonics|tectonic activity]] in a certain region.&lt;ref name="Kim2011" /&gt;  In some cases the exposed secondary landforms can be correlated with known seismic events such as the [[1855 Wairarapa earthquake]] on the [[Wairarapa Fault]] near [[Wellington]], [[New Zealand]] which produced a {{Convert|2.7|m||adj=on}} uplift.&lt;ref name="Crozier2010"&gt;Crozier, MJ; Preston NJ (2010): 'Wellington's Tectonic Landscape: Astride a Plate Boundary' in [[Piotr Migoń|Migoń, P.]] (ed) ''Geomorphological Landscapes of the World.'' Springer, New York, pp. 341-348&lt;/ref&gt;  This figure can be estimated from the vertical offset between [[raised shorelines]] in the area.&lt;ref name="McSaveney2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McSaveney | first1 =  | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2006 | title = 'Late Holocene uplift of beach ridges at Turakirae Head, south Wellington coast, New Zealand' | url = | journal = New Zealand Journal of Geology &amp; Geophysics | volume = 49 | issue = | pages = 337–358 | doi = 10.1080/00288306.2006.9515172 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, with the knowledge of eustatic [[sea level]] fluctuations the speed of isostatic uplift can be estimated&lt;ref name="Press2008"&gt;Press, F; Siever, R (2008):  ''Allgemeine Geologie.'' Spektrum&amp;Springer, Heidelberg, 735 p.&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually the change of relative sea levels for certain regions can be reconstructed. Thus marine terraces also provide information for the research on [[Global warming|climate change]] and trends in future [[sea level]] changes.&lt;ref name="Masselink2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Schellmann2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schellmann | first1 = G | last2 = Radtke | first2 = U | year = 2007 | title = Neue Befunde zur Verbreitung und chronostratigraphischen Gliederung holozäner Küstenterrassen an der mittel- und südpatagonischen Atlantikküste (Argentinien) – Zeugnisse holozäner Meeresspiegelveränderungen | url = | journal = Bamberger Geographische Schriften | volume = 22 | issue = | pages = 1–91 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When analyzing the morphology of marine terraces it must be considered, that both [[eustasy]] and [[isostasy]] can have an influence on the formation process. This way can be assessed, whether there were changes in sea level or whether [[Tectonics|tectonic activities]] took place.

== Prominent examples ==

[[Image:Tongue-Point-by-John-Steedman-Flickr-edited.jpg|thumb|right|200px|alt=Tongue Point New Zealand|[[Quaternary]] marine terraces at Tongue Point, [[New Zealand]]]]

Raised beaches are found in a wide variety of coast and geodynamical background such as subduction on the pacific coast of South America (Pedoja et al., 2006), of North America, passive margin of the Atlantic coast of South America (Rostami et al., 2000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rostami | first1 = K. | last2 = Peltier | first2 = W.R. | last3 = Mangini | first3 = A. | year = 2000 | title = Quaternary marine terraces, sea-level changes and uplift history of Patagonia, Argentina: comparisons with predictions of the ICE-4G (VM2) model for the global process of glacial isostatic adjustment | url = | journal = Quaternary Science Reviews| volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 1495–1525 | doi=10.1016/s0277-3791(00)00075-5| bibcode = 2000QSRv...19.1495R}}&lt;/ref&gt;), collision context on the Pacific coast of Kamchatka (Pedoja et al., 2006), Papua New Guinea, New Zealand, Japan (Ota and Yamaguchi, 2004), passive margin of the South China sea coast (Pedoja et al., in press), on west-facing Atlantic coasts, such as [[Donegal Bay]], [[County Cork]] and [[County Kerry]] in [[Ireland]]; [[Bude]], [[Widemouth Bay]], [[Crackington Haven]], [[Tintagel]], [[Perranporth]] and [[St Ives, Cornwall|St Ives]] in [[Cornwall]], the [[Vale of Glamorgan]], [[Gower Peninsula]], [[Pembrokeshire]] and [[Cardigan Bay]] in [[Wales]], the [[Isle of Jura]] and [[Isle of Arran]] in [[Scotland]], [[Finistère]] in [[Brittany]] and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] in Northern Spain and at Squally Point in [[Eatonville, Nova Scotia]] within the [[Cape Chignecto Provincial Park]].

Other important sites include various coasts of [[New Zealand]], e.g. [[Turakirae Head]] near [[Wellington]] being one of the world’s best and most thoroughly studied examples.&lt;ref name="Crozier2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McSaveney2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wellman1969"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wellman | first1 = HW | year = 1969 | title = Tilted Marine Beach Ridges at Cape Turakirae, N.Z. | url = | journal = Tuatara | volume = 17 | issue = 2| pages = 82–86 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also along the [[Cook Strait]] in [[New Zealand]] there is a well-defined sequence of uplifted marine terraces from the late [[Quaternary]] at Tongue Point. It features a well preserved lower terrace from the last [[interglacial]], a widely eroded higher terrace from the penultimate interglacial and another still higher terrace, which is nearly completely decayed.&lt;ref name="Crozier2010" /&gt;  Furthermore, on [[New Zealand - North Island|New Zealand’s North Island]] at the eastern [[Bay of Plenty]] a sequence of seven marine terraces has been studied.&lt;ref name="Ota1991" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ota1992" /&gt;

Along many coasts of mainland and islands around the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], marine terraces are typical coastal features. An especially prominent marine terraced coastline can be found north of [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]], near [[Davenport, California|Davenport]], [[California]], where terraces probably have been raised by repeated slip earthquakes on the [[San Andreas Fault]].&lt;ref name="Grove2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pirazzoli2005b"&gt;Pirazzoli, PA (2005b.): 'Tectonics and Neotectonics', Schwartz, ML (ed) ''Encyclopedia of Coastal Science.'' Springer, Dordrecht, pp. 941-948&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Hans Jenny (pedologist)]] famously researched the [[pygmy forest]]s of the Mendocino and Sonoma county marine terraces.  The marine terrace's "ecological staircase" of [[Salt Point State Park]] is also bound by the San Andreas Fault.

Along the coasts of [[South America]] marine terraces are present,&lt;ref name="Saillard2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Saillard2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Saillard | first1 = M | last2 = Riotte | first2 = J | last3 = Regard | first3 = V | last4 = Violette | first4 = A | last5 = Hérail | first5 = G | last6 = Audin | first6 = A | last7 = Riquelme | first7 = R | year = 2012 | title = 'Beach ridges U-Th dating in Tongoy bay and tectonic implications for a peninsula-bay system, Chile' | doi = 10.1016/j.jsames.2012.09.001 | journal = Journal of South American Earth Sciences | volume = 40 | issue = | pages = 77–84 | bibcode = 2012JSAES..40...77S }}&lt;/ref&gt; where the highest ones are situated where [[Plate tectonics#Types of plate boundaries|plate margins]] lie above subducted oceanic ridges and the highest and most rapid rates of uplift occur.&lt;ref name="Goy1992"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goy | first1 = JL | last2 = Macharé | first2 = J | last3 = Ortlieb | first3 = L | last4 = Zazo | first4 = C | year = 1992 | title = Quaternary shorelines in Southern Peru: a Record of Global Sea-level Fluctuations and Tectonic Uplift in Chala Bay | doi = 10.1016/1040-6182(92)90039-5 | journal = Quaternary International | volume = 15–16 | issue = | pages = 9–112 | bibcode = 1992QuInt..15...99G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Saillard2011" /&gt;  At Cape Laundi, [[Sumba|Sumba Island]], [[Indonesia]] an ancient [[Coral reef#Types|patch reef]] can be found at {{Convert|475|m||abbr=on}} above [[sea level]] as part of a sequence of coral reef terraces with eleven terraces being wider than {{Convert|100|m||abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Pirazzoli1991"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pirazzoli | first1 = PA | last2 = Radtke | first2 = U | last3 = Hantoro | first3 = WS | last4 = Jouannic | first4 = C | last5 = Hoang | first5 = CT | last6 = Causse | first6 = C | last7 = Borel Best | first7 = M | year = 1991 | title = 'Quaternary Raised Coral-Reef Terraces on Sumba Island, Indonesia' | url = | journal = Science | volume = 252 | issue = | pages = 1834–1836 | doi=10.1126/science.252.5014.1834 | pmid=17753260| bibcode = 1991Sci...252.1834P }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The coral marine terraces at [[Huon Peninsula]], [[New Guinea]], which extend over {{Convert|80|km||abbr=on}} and rise over {{Convert|600|m||abbr=on}} above present [[sea level]]&lt;ref name="Chappell1974"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chappell | first1 = J | year = 1974 | title = 'Geology of Coral Terraces, Huon Peninsula, New Guinea: A Study of Quaternary Tectonic Movements and Se-Level Changes' | url = | journal = Geological Society of America Bulletin | volume = 85 | issue = | pages = 553–570 | doi=10.1130/0016-7606(1974)85&lt;553:gocthp&gt;2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; are currently on [[UNESCO]]’s tentative list for [[UNESCO World Heritage Site|world heritage sites]] under the name ''Houn Terraces - Stairway to the Past.''&lt;ref name="UNESCO2006"&gt;UNESCO (2006): ''Huon Terraces - Stairway to the Past.'' from http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5066/ [13/04/2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related coastal geography ==

Uplift can also be registered through tidal notch sequences. Notches are often portrayed as lying at sea level; however notch types actually form a continuum from wave notches formed in quiet conditions at sea level to surf notches formed in more turbulent conditions and as much as {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level (Pirazzoli et al., 1996 in Rust and Kershaw, 2000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rust | first1 = D. | last2 = Kershaw | first2 = S. | year = 2000 | title = Holocene tectonic uplift patternes in northeastern Sicily: evidence from marine notches in coastal outcrops | url = | journal = Marine Geology | volume = 167 | issue = | pages = 105–126 | doi=10.1016/s0025-3227(00)00019-0| bibcode = 2000MGeol.167..105R }}&lt;/ref&gt;). As stated above, there was at least one higher sea level during the Holocene, so that some notches may not contain a tectonic component in their formation.

The Hindu god [[Shiva]] shares several features with the Rudra: the [[theonym]] ''Shiva'' originated as an epithet of Rudra, the adjective ''shiva'' ("kind") being used euphemistically of Rudra, who also carries the epithet ''Aghora, Abhayankar'' ("{{sic|extremely calm}}  non terrifying").&lt;ref name="Zimmer, p. 181" /&gt; Usage of the epithet came to exceed the original theonym by the post-Vedic period (in the [[Sanskrit Epics]]), and the name ''Rudra'' has been taken as a synonym for the god Shiva and the two names are used interchangeably.

==Etymology==
The etymology of the theonym ''Rudra'' is somewhat uncertain.&lt;ref name="Chakravarti, p. 4"&gt;Chakravarti, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually derived from the root ''rud-'' which means "to cry, howl."&lt;ref name="Chakravarti, p. 4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kramrisch, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this etymology, the name Rudra has been translated as "the roarer".&lt;ref&gt;Majumdar, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; A Rigvedic verse ''rukh draavayathi, iti rudraha'' where ''rukh'' means “sorrow/misery”, ''draavayathi'' means “drive out/eliminate” and ''iti'' means “that which” (or “the one who”) implies that ''Rudra'' is the eliminator of evil and usherer of peace. An alternative etymology suggested by Prof. Pischel derives ''Rudra'' as the “red one”, the “brilliant one” from a lost root ''rud-'', “red”&lt;ref name="Griffith, p. 75, note 1"&gt;Griffith (1973), p. 75, note 1.&lt;/ref&gt; or “ruddy”, or alternatively (according to Grassman) “shining”.&lt;ref name="Chakravarti, p. 4"/&gt;

Stella Kramrisch notes a different etymology connected with the adjectival form ''raudra'', which means “wild”, i.e. of ''rude'' (untamed) nature, and translates the name ''Rudra'' as “the wild one” or “the fierce god”.&lt;ref&gt;Kramrisch, p. 5. cites M. Mayrhofer, ''Concise Etymological Sanskrit Dictionary'', s.v. “rudra”.&lt;/ref&gt; R. K. Sharma follows this alternate etymology and translates the name as “the terrible” in his glossary for the [[Shiva Sahasranama]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt; The commentator [[Sayana|{{IAST|Sāyaṇa}}]] suggests six possible derivations for ''rudra''.&lt;ref&gt;Chakravarti, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; However, another reference states that Sayana suggested ten derivations.&lt;ref&gt;Sri Rudram and Purushasukram, by Swami Amiritananda, pp. 9-10, Sri Ramakrishna Math.&lt;/ref&gt;

The adjective ''shivam'' in the sense of “propitious” or “kind” is applied to the name ''Rudra'' in [[Mandala 10|RV 10]].92.9.&lt;ref&gt;Kramrisch, p. 7. For the text of RV 10.92.9, see: Arya and Joshi, vol. 4, p. 432.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Rudra is called “the archer” (Sanskrit: ''{{IAST|Śarva}}'')&lt;ref name="Apte, p. 910"&gt;Apte, p. 910.&lt;/ref&gt; and the arrow is an essential attribute of Rudra.&lt;ref&gt;For archer and arrow associations, see: Kramrisch, chapter 2; for the arrow as an "essential attribute" of Rudra's, see: Kramrisch, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; This name appears in the [[Shiva Sahasranama]], and R. K. Sharma notes that it is used as a name of [[Shiva]] often in later languages.&lt;ref name="Sharma, p. 306"&gt;Sharma, p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt; The word is derived from the Sanskrit root ''{{IAST|śarv}}-'' which means "to injure" or "to kill"&lt;ref name="Apte, p. 910"/&gt; and Sharma uses that general sense in his interpretive translation of the name {{IAST|Śarva}} as "One who can kill the forces of darkness".&lt;ref name="Sharma, p. 306"/&gt; The names {{IAST|Dhanvin}} ("bowman")&lt;ref name="Chidbhavananda, p. 33"&gt;Chidbhavananda, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; and {{IAST|Bāṇahasta}} (“archer”, literally “Armed with a hand-full of arrows”)&lt;ref name="Chidbhavananda, p. 33"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For translation of {{IAST|Bāṇahasta}} as “Armed with arrows in his hands”, see: Sharma, p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt; also refer to archery.

In other contexts the word ''rudra'' can simply mean “the number eleven”.&lt;ref name="Apte, p. 804"&gt;Apte, p. 804.&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''[[rudraksha]]'' (Sanskrit: ''{{IAST|rudrākşa}}'' = ''rudra'' and ''{{IAST|akşa}}'' “eye”), or “eye of Rudra”, is used as a name both for the berry of the [[Elaeocarpus ganitrus|Rudraksha tree]], and a name for a string of the prayer beads made from those seeds.&lt;ref name="Apte, p. 804"/&gt;

==Rigvedic hymns==
The earliest mentions of Rudra occur in the [[Rigveda]], where three entire hymns are devoted to him.&lt;ref&gt;For the three Rigvedic hymns devoted to Rudra, see: Chakravarti, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For citation of the four Rigvedic hymns (1.43, 1.114, 2.33, and 7.46) see: Michaels, p. 216 and p. 364, note 50.&lt;/ref&gt; There are about seventy-five references to Rudra in the Rigveda overall.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., Rudra is included in a litany given in RV 7.40.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epithets of fierceness and fright===
In the Rigveda Rudra's role as a frightening god is apparent in references to him as ''ghora'' ("extremely terrifying"), or simply as ''asau devam'' ("that god").&lt;ref name="Flood 2003, p. 73"&gt;Flood (2003), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; He is "fierce like a formidable wild beast" (RV 2.33.11).&lt;ref&gt;Arya and Joshi, vol. 2, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;  Chakravarti sums up the perception of Rudra by saying: "Rudra is thus regarded with a kind of cringing fear, as a deity whose wrath is to be deprecated and whose favor curried."&lt;ref&gt;Chakravarti, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

RV 1.114 is an appeal to Rudra for mercy, where he is referred to as "mighty Rudra, the god with braided hair."&lt;ref&gt;Doniger, pp. 224-225.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Mandala 7|RV 7]].46, Rudra is described as armed with a bow and fast-flying arrows. As quoted by R. G. Bhandarkar, the hymn says Rudra discharges "brilliant shafts which run about the heaven and the earth" (RV 7.46.3), which may be a reference to lightning.&lt;ref name=Bhandarkar&gt;{{cite book|last=Bhandarkar|first=Ramkrishna Gopal|title=Vaisnavism, Saivism and Minor Religious Systems|date=1995|publisher=Asian Educational Services|location=India|isbn=9788120601222|page=146|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C5zKrCIBmBwC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rudra was believed to cure diseases, and when people recovered from them or were free of them, that too was attributed to the agency of Rudra.&lt;ref name=Bhandarkar/&gt;  He is asked not to afflict children with disease (RV 7.46.2) and to keep villages free of illness (RV 1.114.1). He is said to have healing remedies (RV 1.43.4), as the best physician of physicians (RV 2.33.4), and as possessed of a thousand medicines (RV 7.46.3). This is described in Shiva's alternative name '''Vaidyanatha''' (Lord of Remedies).

===Epithets of supreme rule===


{{clear|left}}

A verse from the Rig Veda ([[Mandala 2|RV 2]].33.9) calls Rudra "The Lord or Sovereign of the Universe" (''īśānādasya bhuvanasya''):
&lt;poem style="margin-left:2em; float:left;"&gt;
''sthirebhiraṅghaiḥ pururūpa ughro babhruḥ śukrebhiḥ pipiśehiraṇyaiḥ''
''īśānādasya bhuvanasya bhūrerna vā u yoṣad rudrādasuryam'' (RV 2.33.9)
&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem style="margin-left:2em; float:left;"&gt;
With firm limbs, multiform, the strong, the tawny adorns himself with bright gold decorations:
The strength of Godhead never departs from Rudra, him who is Sovereign of this world, the mighty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv02033.htm ''The Hymns of the Rig Veda,''] trans. [[Ralph T. H. Griffith]] (1896)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;

{{clear|left}}

A verse of Śrī Rudram (= Yajurveda 16.18) speaks of Rudra as Lord of the Universe: &lt;br&gt;
{{quote| '''जगताम् पतये नमः ।''' &lt;br&gt;
''jagatăm pataye namaha'' । &lt;br&gt;
Homage to the Lord of the Universe.}}

Another verse (Yajurveda 16.46) locates Rudra in the heart of the gods, showing that he is the inner Self of all, even the gods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sacred-texts.com/hin/wyv/wyvbk16.htm "The Texts of the White Yajurveda, tr. [[Ralph T.H. Griffith]], &amp;#91;1899&amp;#93;"]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br&gt;
{{quote| '''देवानां हृदयभ्यो नमो ।''' &lt;br&gt;
''devănăm hridayebhyo namo'' &lt;br&gt;
Salutations to him who is in heart of the gods.}}

In a verse popularly known as the [[Mahamrityunjaya Mantra]], both Rig Veda (7.59.12) and Yajur Veda (3.60) recommend worshipping Rudra to attain moksha (liberation):

{{quote| 
{{IAST|''tryambakaṃ yajāmahe sugandhiṃ puṣṭivardhanam |''}}&lt;br&gt;
{{IAST|''urvārukamiva bandhanān mṛtyormukṣīya mā'mṛtāt ||''}}

We worship Tryambaka, sweet augmenter of prosperity. As from its stem a cucumber, may I be freed from the bonds of death, not reft of immortality.}}

In the Taittiriya Aranyaka of [[Yajur Veda]](10.24.1)&lt;ref name="sanskritweb.net"&gt;Taittiriya Aranyaka, Subramania Sarma: http://www.sanskritweb.net/yajurveda/ta-deva.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;http://www.sanskritweb.net/yajurveda/ta-01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Rudra is identified as the universal existent ("all this") and thus as the [[Purusha]] (Supreme Person or inner Self) of the Vedas:

{{quote| 
{{IAST|''sarvo vai rudrastasmai rudrāya namo astu |''}}&lt;br&gt;
{{IAST|''puruṣo vai rudraḥ sanmaho namo namaḥ |''}}&lt;br&gt;
{{IAST|''viśvaṃ bhūtaṃ bhuvanaṃ citraṃ bahudhā jātaṃ jāyamānaṃ ca yat |''}}&lt;br&gt;
{{IAST|''sarvo hyeṣa rudrastasmai rudrāya namo astu ॥ 1॥ |''}}

All this verily is Rudra. To Rudra who is such we offer our salutation. We salute again and again that Being, Rudra, who alone is the Purusha and the Soul of creatures. The material universe, the created beings, and whatever there is manifoldly and profusely created, in the past and in the present, in the form of the world—all that is indeed this Rudra. Salutations be to Rudra who is such. }}

The Taittiriya Aranyaka of [[Yajur Veda]]&lt;ref name="sanskritweb.net"/&gt; 1.10.1&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; identifies Rudra and [[Brihaspati]] as Sons of Bhumi (Earth) and Heaven:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.srihayagrivan.org/ebooks/038_ap_v2.pdf SriHayagrivan – AruNa praSnam, vol. 2]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relation to other deities===
Rudra is used both as a name of Shiva and collectively ("the [[Rudras]]") as the name for the [[Maruts]].&lt;ref&gt;For the terms "Maruts" and "Rudras" as equivalent, see: Flood (1996), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Maruts are "storm gods", associated with the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;Flood (1996), pp. 45-46.&lt;/ref&gt; They are a group of gods, whose number varies from two to sixty, sometimes also rendered as eleven, thirty-three&lt;ref&gt;Macdonell, p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt; or a hundred and eighty in number (i. e. three times sixty, see RV 8.96.8.).

The Rudras are sometimes referred to as "the sons of Rudra",&lt;ref&gt;Flood (1996), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Rudra is referred to as "Father of the Maruts" (RV 2.33.1).&lt;ref&gt;Arya and Joshi, vol. 2, p. 78. For Shiva as the head or father of the group see: Apte, p. 804. For Rudra as the head of a host of "storm spirits, the Maruts" see: Basham (1989), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rudra is mentioned along with a litany of other deities in [[Mandala 7|RV 7]].40.5. Here is the reference to Rudra, whose name appears as one of many gods who are called upon:

{{cquote|This ''{{IAST|Varuṇa}}'', the leader of the rite, and the royal ''Mitra'' and ''Aryaman'', uphold my acts, and the divine unopposed ''Aditi'', earnestly invoked: may they convey us safe beyond evil. I propitiate with oblations the ramifications ({{IAST|vayāḥ}}) of that divine attainable ''{{IAST|Viṣṇu}}'', the showerer of benefits. ''Rudra'', bestow upon us the magnificence of his nature.  The ''{{IAST|Aśvins}}'' have come down to our dwelling abounding with (sacrificial) food.&lt;ref&gt;RV 7.40.4–5 as translated in Arya and Joshi, pp. 243-244.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

One scholiast{{Clarify|date=January 2010}} interpretation of the Sanskrit word ''{{IAST|vayāḥ}}'', meaning "ramifications" or "branches", is that all other deities are, as it were branches of [[Vishnu]],&lt;ref&gt;For the scholiast interpretation of ''{{IAST|vayāḥ}}'' as "ramifications" or "branches" see: Arya and Joshi, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; but Ralph T. H. Griffith cites Ludwig as saying "This [...] gives no satisfactory interpretation" and cites other views which suggest that the text is corrupt at that point.&lt;ref&gt;The citation continues as follows: "This, Ludwig remarks, gives no satisfactory interpretation; but I am unable to offer anything better at present. Grassman alters {{IAST|vayāḥ}} into {{IAST|vayāma}}: 'we with our offering approach the banquet of this swift-moving God, the bounteous {{IAST|Viṣṇu}}; i. e. come to offer him sacrificial food.'" in: Griffith, p. 356, note 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-Rigvedic hymns==

In the various recensions of the [[Yajurveda]] is included a litany of stanzas praising Rudra: (''Maitrāyaṇī-Saṃhitā'' 2.9.2, ''Kāṭhaka-Saṃhitā'' 17.11, ''Taittirīya-Saṃhitā'' 4.5.1, and ''Vājasaneyi-Saṃhitā'' 16.1–14).  This litany is subsequently referred to variously as the ''[[Rudram Chamakam|Śatarudriyam]]'', the ''Namakam'' (because many of the verses commence with the word ''namaḥ'' [`homage`]), or simply the ''[[Rudram]]''.  This litany was recited during the ''[[Agnicayana]]'' ritual ("the piling of Agni"), and it later became a standard element in Rudra liturgy.

A selection of these stanzas, augmented with others, is included in the ''Paippalāda-Saṃhitā'' of the [[Atharvaveda]] (PS 14.3—4).  This selection, with further PS additions at the end, circulated more widely as the ''Nīlarudram'' (or ''Nīlarudra Upaniṣad'').&lt;ref name="Kramrisch pp. 71-74"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Lubin 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sri Rudram===

The President of the [[Ramakrishna Mission]], at [[Chennai]], in commentating on the foreword to [[Swami Amritananda]]'s translation of ''Sri Rudram and Purushasuktam'', stated that "Rudra to whom these prayers are addressed is not a sectarian deity, but the [[Supreme Being]] who is omnipresent and manifests Himself in a myriad forms for the sake of the diverse spiritual aspirants." Sri Rudram occurs in the fourth Kanda of the Taittirya Samhita in the Yajur Veda.
It is a preeminent Vedic hymn to Lord [[Shiva]] as the God of dissolution, chanted daily in Shiva temples throughout India."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4hLtzCeVds|title=SHRI RUDRAM FROM YAJURVEDA (Full)|first=|last=Karthik Satchitanandam|date=9 July 2011|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prayer depicts the diverse aspects of the Almighty. The Shri Rudram hymn is unique in that it shows the presence of divinity throughout the entire universe. We cannot confine the qualities of the divine to those that are favorable to us. The Lord is both garden and graveyard, the slayer and the most benevolent one. The Almighty is impartial and ubiquitous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQjBQJqi0Ak|title=Sri Rudram|first=|last=Vasudev R|date=1 January 2012|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In it Rudra is described as the most dreaded terroriser (frightening).Sri Rudram describes Rudra the vedic deity as the personification of 'terror'. Rudra comes from 'Ru' meaning '"Roar or Howl" (the words 'dreaded' or 'fearsome' could only be used as adjectives to Rudra and not as Rudra, because Rudra is the personification of terror); 'dra' is a superlative meaning 'the most'. So Rudra, depending on the poetic situation, can be meant as 'the most severe roarer/howler' - could be a hurricane or tempest - or 'the most frightening one'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sssbpt.org/sri-rudram/instructions-to-user.htm|title=Sri Sathya Sai Books &amp; Publication Trust|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://sanskritdictionary.com/?iencoding=iast&amp;q=Rudra&amp;lang=sans&amp;action=Search&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rudra and Shiva==

[[File:ThreeHeadedShivaGandhara2ndCentury.jpg|upright|thumb|Three-headed Shiva, Gandhara, 2nd century AD]]
[[Shiva]] as we know him today shares many features with Rudra,&lt;ref name="Michaels, p. 316"&gt;Michaels, p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt; and Shiva and Rudra are viewed as the same personality in [[Hindu texts|Hindu scriptures]]. The two names are used synonymously. Rudra, the god of the roaring storm, is usually portrayed in accordance with the element he represents as a fierce, destructive deity.&lt;ref&gt;Flood (2003), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest surviving text of Hinduism is the [[Rigveda|Rig Veda]], which is dated to between 1700 and 1100 BC based on [[Linguistics|linguistic]] and [[philology|philological]] evidence.&lt;ref&gt;For dating based on "cumulative evidence" see: Oberlies, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; A god named Rudra is mentioned in the Rig Veda. The name Rudra is still used as a name for Shiva. In RV 2.33, he is described as the "Father of the [[Rudras]]", a group of storm gods.&lt;ref&gt;Doniger, pp. 221–223.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hymn 10.92 of the Rigveda states that deity Rudra has two natures, one wild and cruel (rudra), another that is kind and tranquil (shiva).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stella Kramrisch|title=The Presence of Siva|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O5BanndcIgUC |year=1993|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-01930-4|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vedic texts do not mention bull or any animal as the transport vehicle (''vahana'') of Rudra or other deities. However, post-Vedic texts such as the Mahabharata and the Puranas state the Nandi bull, the Indian zebu, in particular, as the vehicle of Rudra and of Shiva, thereby unmistakably linking them as same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stella Kramrisch|title=The Presence of Siva|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O5BanndcIgUC |year=1993|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-01930-4|pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Sikhism==

The 10th Sikh Guru, [[Guru Gobind Singh]] describes the [[incarnation]] of Rudra in his book the [[Dasam Granth]], the [[canto]] is titled Rudra [[Avatar]].

The '''San Joaquin Wildlife Sanctuary''' is a {{convert|300|acre|ha sqmi}} [[constructed wetland]] in [[Irvine, California]], in the flood plain of [[San Diego Creek]] just above its outlet into the [[Upper Newport Bay]].

The site is owned by the [[Irvine Ranch Water District]]; it was used for farmland in the 1950s and 1960s, and (prior to its reconstruction) as a duck hunting range. Restoration of the wetlands began in 1988 and was completed in 2000.&lt;ref name="times00"&gt;{{citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11949">'''Soil health''' is a state of a [[soil]] meeting its range of [[ecosystem]] functions as appropriate to its environment. Soil health testing is an assessment of this status.&lt;ref&gt;[[Natural Resources Conservation Service|NRCS]] 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Soil health depends on [[soil biodiversity]] (with a robust [[soil biology|soil biota]]), and it can be improved via [[soil conditioning]] (soil amendment).

== Aspects==
The term soil health is used to describe the state of a soil in: 
*Sustaining plant and animal productivity and [[biodiversity]] ([[Soil biodiversity]]);
*Maintaining or enhance [[water quality|water]] and [[air quality]];
*Supporting [[human health]] and [[Human settlement|habitation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detailfull/co/home/?cid=nrcs144p2_063020 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2018-03-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170123141240/https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detailfull/co/home/?cid=nrcs144p2_063020 |archivedate=2017-01-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soil Health has partly if not largely replaced the expression "Soil Quality" that was extant in the 1990s. The primary difference between the two expressions is that soil quality was focused on individual traits within a functional group, as in "quality of soil for [[maize]] production" or "quality of soil for [[roadbed]] preparation" and so on. The addition of the word "health" shifted the perception to be integrative, [[holistic]] and systematic.  The two expressions still overlap considerably.

The underlying principle in the use of the term “soil health” is that soil is not just an inert, lifeless growing medium, which modern farming tends to represent, rather it is a living, dynamic and ever-so-subtly changing whole environment. It turns out that soils highly [[soil fertility|fertile]] from the point of view of crop productivity are also lively from a biological point of view. It is now commonly recognized that soil [[microbial]] [[biomass]] is large: in temperate grassland soil the bacterial and fungal biomass have been documented to be 1–{{convert|2|t|abbr=on}}/[[hectare]] and 2–{{convert|5|t|abbr=on}}/ha, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Microbial diversity and soil functions|journal=European Journal of Soil Science|date=December 2003|volume=54|pages=655–670|url=http://aulavirtual.agro.unlp.edu.ar/pluginfile.php/11015/mod_resource/content/0/Europ_J_Soil_Sci.pdf|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2389.2003.00556.x|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160412190901/http://aulavirtual.agro.unlp.edu.ar/pluginfile.php/11015/mod_resource/content/0/Europ_J_Soil_Sci.pdf |archivedate=2016-04-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Some microbiologists now believe that 80% of [[soil nutrient]] functions are essentially controlled by microbes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conservationwebinars.net/webinars/role-of-soil-biology-in-improving-soil-quality The Role of Soil Biology in Improving Soils] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312211918/http://www.conservationwebinars.net/webinars/role-of-soil-biology-in-improving-soil-quality |date=2014-03-12 }} [[Webinar]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://explogrow.com/agri-beneficial-microbes-and-effects-of-organic-bio-fertiliser-on-soil-plant-and-disease|title= Listing 17 microbes and their effects on the soil and plant health functions|date= 22 December 2016|publisher= Explogrow, Dr Malherbe, BSc, BSc Hons., MSc, Pr.Sci.Nat.|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160625142933/http://explogrow.com/agri-beneficial-microbes-and-effects-of-organic-bio-fertiliser-on-soil-plant-and-disease|archivedate= 25 June 2016|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
If this is consistently true, than the prevailing [[Liebig's law of the minimum|Liebig nutrient theory]] model, and Mitscherlich modifications of it, all which exclude biology, are perhaps dangerously incorrect for managing soil fertility sustainably for the future.

Using the human health analogy, a healthy soil can be categorized as one:
*In a state of composite well-being in terms of biological, chemical and physical properties;
*Not diseased or infirmed (i.e. not [[soil degradation|degraded]], nor degrading), nor causing negative off-site impacts; 
*With each of its qualities cooperatively functioning such that the soil reaches its full potential and resists degradation;
*Providing a full range of functions (especially nutrient, [[carbon cycle|carbon]] and [[water cycling]]) and in such a way that it maintains this capacity into the future.

== Conceptualisation ==
[[Image:SoilHealthConcept.jpg]]

Soil health is the condition of the soil in a defined space and at a defined scale relative to a set of benchmarks that encompass healthy functioning. It would not be appropriate to refer to soil health for soil-roadbed preparation, as in the analogy of soil quality in a functional class. 
The definition of soil health may vary between users of the term as alternative users may place differing priorities upon the multiple functions of a soil.
Therefore, the term soil health can only be understood within the context of the user of the term, and their aspirations of a soil, as well as by the boundary definition of the soil at issue.

== Interpretation ==
Different soils will have different benchmarks of health depending on the “inherited” qualities, and on the geographic circumstance of the soil.
The '''generic''' aspects defining a healthy soil can be considered as follows:
*“Productive” options are broad;
*Life diversity is broad;
*Absorbency, storing, recycling and processing is high in relation to limits set by [[climate]];
*[[Water runoff]] quality is of high standard;
*Low [[entropy]]; and,
*No damage to, or loss of the fundamental components.

This translates to:
*A comprehensive cover of [[vegetation]];
*Carbon levels relatively close to the limits set by [[soil type]] and climate;
*Little leakage of nutrients from the ecosystem;
*Biological and [[agricultural productivity]] relatively close to the limits set by the soil environment and climate;
*Only geological rates of [[erosion]];
*No accumulation of [[contaminant]]s; and,
*The ecosystem does not rely excessively on inputs of [[fossil energy]]

An unhealthy soil thus is the simple converse of the above.

== Measurement ==
On the basis of the above, soil health will be measured in terms of individual [[ecosystem services]] provided relative to the benchmark.  Specific benchmarks used to evaluate soil health include CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; release, humus levels, microbial activity, and available calcium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbrixgardens.com/garden-restoration/start-here-for-healthy-soil.html|title=Healthy Soil|author=|date=|website=www.highbrixgardens.com|accessdate=26 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161219091942/http://www.highbrixgardens.com/garden-restoration/start-here-for-healthy-soil.html|archivedate=19 December 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soil health testing is spreading in the United States, Australia and South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.farmanddairy.com/news/new-soil-test-measures-soil-health/175574.html|title=New soil test measures soil health - Farm and Dairy|first=Chris|last=Kick|date=18 February 2014|website=farmanddairy.com|accessdate=26 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201082319/https://www.farmanddairy.com/news/new-soil-test-measures-soil-health/175574.html|archivedate=1 December 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cornell University, a land-grant college in NY State, has had a Soil Health Test since 2006. Woods End Laboratories, a private soil lab founded in Maine in 1975, has offered a soil quality package since 1985 that contains physical (aggregate stability) chemical (mineral balance) and biology (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; respiration) which today are prerequisites for soil health testing. {{when|Presently|date=November 2017}} in the United States, six commercial soil labs are registered for "Soil Health" testing under the NRCS website. The approach of all the labs is to add into common chemical nutrient testing a biological set of factors not normally included in routine soil testing. The best example is adding biological [[soil respiration]] ("CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Burst") as a test procedure; this has already been adapted to modern commercial labs {{when|in the past 10 years|date=November 2017}}.

There is resistance among soil testing labs and university scientists to adding new biological tests, primarily since interpretation of soil fertility is based on models from "crop response" studies which match yield to test levels of specific chemical nutrients. These soil test methods have evolved slowly over the past 40 years and are backed by considerable effort. However, in this same time USA soils have also lost up to 75% of their carbon ([[humus]]), causing biological fertility to drop drastically. Many critics of the current system say this is sufficient evidence that the old soil testing models have failed us, and need to be replaced with new approaches. These older models have stressed "maximum yield" and " yield calibration" to such an extent that related factors have been overlooked. Thus, surface and [[groundwater pollution]] with excess nutrients ([[nitrate]]s and [[phosphate]]s) has grown enormously, and is reported presently{{when|date=June 2018}} (in the United States) to be the worst it has been since the 1970s, before the advent of environmental consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bernard T.

A '''thermal power station''' is a [[power station]] in which [[heat energy]] is converted to [[electric power]]. In most of the places in the world the [[turbine]] is [[steam]]-driven. Water is heated, turns into steam and spins a [[steam turbine]] which drives an [[electrical generator]]. After it passes through the turbine, the steam is [[condensation|condensed]] in a [[Surface condenser|condenser]] and recycled to where it was heated; this is known as a [[Rankine cycle]]. The greatest variation in the design of thermal power stations is due to the different heat sources; [[fossil fuel]] dominates here, although nuclear heat energy and solar heat energy are also used. Some prefer to use the term ''energy center'' because such facilities convert forms of [[heat]] [[energy]] into electrical energy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indianpowersector.com/2010/10/electricity/ Electricity]&lt;/ref&gt; Certain thermal power stations are also designed to produce heat energy for industrial purposes, or [[district heating]], or [[desalination]] of water, in addition to generating electrical power.

==Types of thermal energy==
Almost all [[coal]], petroleum, [[nuclear power plant|nuclear]], [[geothermal power|geothermal]], [[solar thermal electric]], and [[incineration|waste incineration plants]], as well as many natural gas power stations are thermal. [[Natural gas]] is frequently [[flue-gas emissions from fossil-fuel combustion|combusted]] in [[gas turbine]]s as well as [[boiler]]s. The [[waste heat]] from a gas turbine, in the form of hot exhaust gas, can be used to raise steam, by passing this gas through a [[heat recovery steam generator]] (HRSG) the steam is then used to drive a steam turbine in a [[combined cycle]] plant that improves overall efficiency. Power stations burning coal, [[fuel oil]], or natural gas are often called ''[[fossil fuel power station]]s''. Some [[biomass]]-fueled thermal power stations have appeared also. Non-nuclear thermal power stations, particularly fossil-fueled plants, which do not use [[cogeneration]] are sometimes referred to as ''conventional power stations''.

Commercial [[electric utility]] power stations are usually constructed on a large scale and designed for continuous operation. Virtually all Electric power stations use [[three-phase]] [[electrical generator]]s to produce alternating current (AC) electric power at a [[utility frequency|frequency]] of 50&amp;nbsp;Hz or 60 [[Hertz|Hz]]. Large companies or institutions may have their own power stations to supply [[heating]] or electricity to their facilities, especially if steam is created anyway for other purposes. Steam-driven power stations have been used to drive most ships in most of the 20th century until recently. Steam power stations are now only used in large nuclear [[navy|naval]] ships. Shipboard power stations usually directly couple the turbine to the ship's propellers through gearboxes. Power stations in such ships also provide steam to smaller turbines driving electric generators to supply electricity. [[Nuclear marine propulsion]] is, with few exceptions, used only in naval vessels. There have been many [[turbo-electric]] ships in which a steam-driven turbine drives an electric generator which powers an [[electric motor]] for [[marine propulsion|propulsion]].

[[Cogeneration]] plants, often called combined heat and power (CH&amp;P) facilities, produce both electric power and heat for process heat or space heating, such as steam and hot water.

==History==
The initially developed [[steam engine|reciprocating steam engine]] has been used to produce mechanical power since the 18th Century, with notable improvements being made by [[James Watt]]. When the first commercially developed central electrical power stations were established in 1882 at [[Pearl Street Station]] in New York and [[Holborn Viaduct power station]] in London, reciprocating steam engines were used. The development of the [[steam turbine]] in 1884 provided larger and more efficient machine designs for central generating stations. By 1892 the turbine was considered a better alternative to reciprocating engines;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=ZMw7AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA175&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=the early days of the power station industry|publisher=CUP Archive|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; turbines offered higher speeds, more compact machinery, and stable speed regulation allowing for parallel synchronous operation of generators on a common bus. After about 1905, turbines entirely replaced reciprocating engines in large central power stations.

The largest reciprocating engine-generator sets ever built were completed in 1901 for the [[Manhattan Elevated Railway]]. Each of seventeen units weighed about 500 tons and was rated 6000 kilowatts; a contemporary turbine set of similar rating would have weighed about 20% as much.&lt;ref&gt;Maury Klein, ''The Power Makers: Steam, Electricity, and the Men Who Invented Modern America'' Bloomsbury Publishing USA, 2009 {{ISBN|1-59691-677-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thermal power generation efficiency==
[[File:feedwater-heating.png|thumb|right|354px|A [[Rankine cycle]] with a two-stage [[steam turbine]] and a single feed water heater.]]
The energy efficiency of a conventional thermal power station, considered salable energy produced as a percent of the [[heating value]] of the fuel consumed, is typically 33% to 48%.&lt;ref name="energy.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fossil.energy.gov/programs/powersystems/turbines/turbines_howitworks.html |title=DOE – Fossil Energy: How Turbine Power Plants Work |publisher=Fossil.energy.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527095840/http://fossil.energy.gov/programs/powersystems/turbines/turbines_howitworks.html |archivedate=May 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=May 2018}} As with all heat engines, their efficiency is limited, and governed by the laws of [[thermodynamic]]s. Other types of power stations are subject to different efficiency limitations, most [[hydroelectricity|hydropower stations]] in the United States are about 90 percent efficient in converting the energy of falling water into electricity&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.c2es.org/docUploads/Hydropower10%2009_FINAL_cleanPDF.pdf Climate TechBook, Hydropower], [[Pew Center on Global Climate Change]], October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; while the efficiency of a [[wind turbine]] is limited by [[Betz's law]], to about 59.3%.

The energy of a thermal power station not utilized in power production must leave the plant in the form of heat to the environment. This [[waste heat]] can go through a [[surface condenser|condenser]] and be disposed of with [[cooling water]] or in [[cooling tower]]s. If the waste heat is instead utilized for [[district heating]], it is called [[cogeneration]]. An important class of thermal power station are associated with [[desalination]] facilities; these are typically found in desert countries with large supplies of [[natural gas]] and in these plants, freshwater production and electricity are equally important co-products.

The [[Carnot efficiency]] dictates that higher efficiencies can be attained by increasing the temperature of the steam. Sub-critical fossil fuel power stations can achieve 36–40% efficiency. [[Supercritical fluid|Supercritical]] designs have efficiencies in the low to mid 40% range, with new "ultra critical" designs using pressures of 4400 psi (30.3 MPa) and multiple stage reheat reaching about 48% efficiency. Above the [[critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]] for [[Water (data page)|water]] of {{convert|705|F|C}} and 3212 psi (22.06 MPa), there is no [[phase transition]] from water to steam, but only a gradual decrease in [[density]].

Currently most of the nuclear power stations must operate below the temperatures and pressures that coal-fired plants do, in order to provide more conservative safety margins within the systems that remove heat from the nuclear fuel rods. This, in turn, limits their thermodynamic efficiency to 30–32%. Some advanced reactor designs being studied, such as the [[very-high-temperature reactor]], [[Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor]], and [[supercritical water reactor]], would operate at temperatures and pressures similar to current coal plants, producing comparable thermodynamic efficiency.

==Electricity cost==
{{See also|Cost of electricity by source}}
The direct cost of electric energy produced by a thermal power station is the result of cost of fuel, capital cost for the plant, operator labour, maintenance, and such factors as ash handling and disposal. Indirect, social or environmental costs such as the economic value of environmental impacts, or environmental and health effects of the complete fuel cycle and plant decommissioning, are not usually assigned to generation costs for thermal stations in utility practice, but may form part of an environmental impact assessment.

For units over about 200 [[megawatt|MW]] capacity, redundancy of key components is provided by installing duplicates of the forced and induced draft fans, air preheaters, and fly ash collectors. On some units of about 60&amp;nbsp;MW, two boilers per unit may instead be provided. The [[list of coal power stations]] has the 200 largest power stations ranging in size from 2,000MW to 5,500MW.

==Boiler and steam cycle==
In the [[nuclear power|nuclear plant]] field, ''[[steam generator (nuclear power)|steam generator]]'' refers to a specific type of large [[heat exchanger]] used in a [[pressurized water reactor]] (PWR) to thermally connect the primary (reactor plant) and secondary (steam plant) systems, which generates steam. In a nuclear reactor called a [[boiling water reactor]] (BWR), water is boiled to generate steam directly in the reactor itself and there are no units called steam generators.

In some industrial settings, there can also be steam-producing heat exchangers called ''[[heat recovery steam generator]]s'' (HRSG) which utilize heat from some industrial process, most commonly utilizing hot exhaust from a gas turbine. The steam generating boiler has to produce steam at the high purity, pressure and temperature required for the steam turbine that drives the electrical generator.

[[Geothermal power|Geothermal plants]] do not need boilers because they use naturally occurring steam sources. Heat exchangers may be used where the geothermal steam is very corrosive or contains excessive suspended solids.

A fossil fuel steam generator includes an [[economizer]], a [[steam drum]], and the [[furnace]] with its steam generating tubes and superheater coils. Necessary [[safety valve]]s are located at suitable points to relieve excessive boiler pressure. The air and [[flue gas]] path equipment include: forced draft (FD) [[centrifugal fan|fan]], [[air preheater]] (AP), boiler furnace, induced draft (ID) fan, fly ash collectors ([[electrostatic precipitator]] or [[dust collector#Fabric filters|baghouse]]), and the [[flue-gas stack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=British Electricity International|title=Modern Power Station Practice: incorporating modern power system practice|edition=3rd Edition (12 volume set)|publisher=Pergamon|year=1991|isbn=0-08-040510-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Babcock&gt;{{cite book|author=Babcock &amp; Wilcox Co.|title=Steam: Its Generation and Use|edition=41st|year=2005|isbn=0-9634570-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Elliott&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas C. Elliott, Kao Chen, Robert Swanekamp (coauthors)|title=Standard Handbook of Powerplant Engineering|edition=2nd|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|year=1997|isbn=0-07-019435-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feed water heating and deaeration===
The [[boiler feedwater]] used in the [[steam]] boiler is a means of transferring heat energy from the burning fuel to the mechanical energy of the spinning [[steam turbine]]. The total feed water consists of recirculated ''condensate'' water and purified ''makeup water''. Because the metallic materials it contacts are subject to [[corrosion]] at high temperatures and pressures, the makeup water is highly purified before use. A system of [[water softener]]s and [[ion exchange]] demineralizers produces water so pure that it coincidentally becomes an electrical [[electrical insulation|insulator]], with [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]] in the range of 0.3–1.0 [[Siemens (unit)#Definition|microsiemens]] per centimeter. The makeup water in a 500&amp;nbsp;MWe plant amounts to perhaps 120 US gallons per minute (7.6 L/s) to replace water drawn off from the boiler drums for water purity management, and to also offset the small losses from steam leaks in the system.

The feed water cycle begins with condensate water being pumped out of the [[surface condenser|condenser]] after traveling through the steam turbines. The condensate flow rate at full load in a 500&amp;nbsp;MW plant is about 6,000 US gallons per minute (400 L/s).
[[File:Deaerator.png|thumb|391 px|right|Diagram of boiler feed water deaerator (with vertical, domed aeration section and horizontal water storage section).]]
The water is pressurized in two stages, and flows through a series of six or seven intermediate feed water heaters, heated up at each point with steam extracted from an appropriate duct on the turbines and gaining temperature at each stage. Typically, in the middle of this series of feedwater heaters, and before the second stage of pressurization, the condensate plus the makeup water flows through a [[deaerator]]&lt;ref name=Spirax&gt;[http://www.spiraxsarco.com/resources/steam-engineering-tutorials/the-boiler-house/pressurised-deaerators.asp#head5 Pressurized deaerators]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usfilter.com/NR/rdonlyres/27278F1E-8378-404B-B0F2-1C9CDCAABB20/0/trey_deaerator_brochure.pdf|title=Evoqua Water Technologies|website=www.usfilter.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; that removes dissolved air from the water, further purifying and reducing its corrosiveness. The water may be dosed following this point with [[hydrazine]], a chemical that removes the remaining [[oxygen]] in the water to below 5 [[parts per billion]] (ppb).{{Vague|by what?--follow the link|date=February 2010}} It is also dosed with [[pH]] control agents such as [[ammonia]] or [[morpholine]] to keep the residual [[acid]]ity low and thus non-corrosive.

===Boiler operation===
The boiler is a rectangular [[furnace]] about {{convert|50|ft|m}} on a side and {{convert|130|ft|m}} tall. Its walls are made of a web of high pressure steel tubes about {{convert|2.3|in|mm}} in diameter.

[[Coal dust|Pulverized coal]] is air-blown into the furnace through burners located at the four corners, or along one wall, or two opposite walls, and it is ignited to rapidly burn, forming a large fireball at the center. The [[thermal radiation]] of the fireball heats the water that circulates through the boiler tubes near the boiler perimeter. The water circulation rate in the boiler is three to four times the throughput. As the water in the [[boiler]] circulates it absorbs heat and changes into steam. It is separated from the water inside a drum at the top of the furnace. The saturated steam is introduced into [[superheater|superheat]] pendant tubes that hang in the hottest part of the combustion gases as they exit the furnace. Here the steam is superheated to {{convert|1000|F|C|sigfig=2}} to prepare it for the turbine.

Plants designed for [[lignite]] (brown coal) are increasingly used in locations as varied as [[Germany]], [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]], Australia, and [[North Dakota]]. Lignite is a much younger form of coal than black coal. It has a lower energy density than black coal and requires a much larger furnace for equivalent heat output. Such coals may contain up to 70% water and [[coal ash|ash]], yielding lower furnace temperatures and requiring larger induced-draft fans. The firing systems also differ from black coal and typically draw hot gas from the furnace-exit level and mix it with the incoming coal in fan-type mills that inject the pulverized coal and hot gas mixture into the boiler.

Plants that use gas turbines to heat the water for conversion into steam use boilers known as [[heat recovery steam generator]]s (HRSG). The exhaust heat from the gas turbines is used to make superheated steam that is then used in a conventional water-steam generation cycle, as described in the [[fossil fuel power station#Gas turbine plants|gas turbine combined-cycle plants]] section.

===Boiler furnace and steam drum===
The water enters the boiler through a section in the convection pass called the [[economizer]]. From the economizer it passes to the [[steam drum]] and from there it goes through downcomers to inlet headers at the bottom of the water walls. From these headers the water rises through the water walls of the furnace where some of it is turned into steam and the mixture of water and steam then re-enters the steam drum. This process may be driven purely by [[natural circulation]] (because the water is the downcomers is denser than the water/steam mixture in the water walls) or assisted by pumps. In the steam drum, the water is returned to the downcomers and the steam is passed through a series of [[steam separator]]s and dryers that remove water droplets from the steam. The dry steam then flows into the superheater coils.

The boiler furnace auxiliary equipment includes [[coal]] feed nozzles and igniter guns, [[soot blower]]s, water lancing, and observation ports (in the furnace walls) for observation of the furnace interior. Furnace [[explosion]]s due to any accumulation of combustible gases after a trip-out are avoided by flushing out such gases from the combustion zone before igniting the coal.

The steam drum (as well as the [[superheater]] coils and headers) have air vents and drains needed for initial start up.

===Superheater===
Fossil fuel power stations often have a [[superheater]] section in the steam generating furnace.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The steam passes through drying equipment inside the steam drum on to the superheater, a set of tubes in the furnace. Here the steam picks up more energy from hot flue gases outside the tubing, and its temperature is now superheated above the saturation temperature. The superheated steam is then piped through the main steam lines to the valves before the high-pressure turbine.

Nuclear-powered steam plants do not have such sections but produce steam at essentially saturated conditions. Experimental nuclear plants were equipped with fossil-fired superheaters in an attempt to improve overall plant operating cost.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

===Steam condensing===
The condenser condenses the steam from the exhaust of the turbine into liquid to allow it to be pumped. If the condenser can be made cooler, the pressure of the exhaust steam is reduced and efficiency of the [[Rankine cycle|cycle]] increases.

[[File:Surface Condenser.png|thumb|354px|Diagram of a typical water-cooled surface condenser.&lt;ref name="Babcock"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Elliott"/&gt;&lt;ref name="epa.gov"&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/oar/oaqps/eog/course422/ce6b3.html Air Pollution Control Orientation Course] from website of the Air Pollution Training Institute&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Energy savings in steam systems"&gt;[http://kolmetz.com/pdf/ENERGY%20EFFICIENCY%20IMPROVEMENT.pdf Energy savings in steam systems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927225000/http://kolmetz.com/pdf/ENERGY%20EFFICIENCY%20IMPROVEMENT.pdf |date=2007-09-27}} ''Figure 3a, Layout of surface condenser'' (scroll to page 11 of 34 pdf pages)&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The surface condenser is a [[shell and tube heat exchanger]] in which cooling water is circulated through the tubes.&lt;ref name="Babcock"/&gt;&lt;ref name="epa.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Energy savings in steam systems"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Robert Thurston Kent]] (Editor in Chief)|title=Kents’ Mechanical Engineers’ Handbook|edition=Eleventh edition (Two volumes)|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons (Wiley Engineering Handbook Series)|year=1936|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhaust steam from the low-pressure turbine enters the shell, where it is cooled and converted to condensate (water) by flowing over the tubes as shown in the adjacent diagram. Such condensers use [[injector|steam ejectors]] or [[rotary motor]]-driven exhausts for continuous removal of air and gases from the steam side to maintain [[vacuum]].

For best efficiency, the temperature in the condenser must be kept as low as practical in order to achieve the lowest possible pressure in the condensing steam. Since the condenser temperature can almost always be kept significantly below 100&amp;nbsp;°C where the [[vapor pressure]] of water is much less than atmospheric pressure, the condenser generally works under [[vacuum]]. Thus leaks of non-condensible air into the closed loop must be prevented.

Typically the cooling water causes the steam to condense at a temperature of about {{convert|25|C|F}} and that creates an [[absolute pressure]] in the condenser of about {{convert|2|-|7|kPa|inHg|abbr=on|lk=on}}, i.e. a [[vacuum]] of about {{convert|-95|kPa|inHg|abbr=on}} relative to atmospheric pressure. The large decrease in volume that occurs when water vapor condenses to liquid creates the low vacuum that helps pull steam through and increase the efficiency of the turbines.

The limiting factor is the temperature of the cooling water and that, in turn, is limited by the prevailing average climatic conditions at the power station's location (it may be possible to lower the temperature beyond the turbine limits during winter, causing excessive condensation in the turbine). Plants operating in hot climates may have to reduce output if their source of condenser cooling water becomes warmer; unfortunately this usually coincides with periods of high electrical demand for [[air conditioning]].

The condenser generally uses either circulating cooling water from a [[cooling tower]] to reject waste heat to the atmosphere, or once-through water from a river, lake or ocean.
[[File:A Marley industrial cooling tower.jpg|thumb|150px|right|A Marley mechanical induced draft cooling tower]]

The heat absorbed by the circulating cooling water in the condenser tubes must also be removed to maintain the ability of the water to cool as it circulates. This is done by pumping the warm water from the condenser through either natural draft, forced draft or induced draft [[cooling tower]]s (as seen in the adjacent image) that reduce the temperature of the water by evaporation, by about 11&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;17&amp;nbsp;°C (20&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;30&amp;nbsp;°F)—expelling [[waste heat]] to the atmosphere. The circulation flow rate of the cooling water in a 500 [[megawatt|MW]] unit is about 14.2 m³/s (500&amp;nbsp;ft³/s or 225,000 US gal/min) at full load.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/ostwater/presentations/maulbetsch.pdf |title=Cooling System Retrofit Costs |last1=Maulbetsch |first1=John |last2=Zammit |first2=Kent |date=2003-05-06 |website=Cooling Water Intakes |publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency |location=Washington, DC |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309155008/http://www.epa.gov/waterscience/presentations/maulbetsch.pdf |archivedate=March 9, 2008 |access-date=2006-09-10}} EPA Workshop on Cooling Water Intake Technologies, Arlington, Virginia.&lt;/ref&gt;

The condenser tubes are made of [[brass]] or [[stainless steel]] to resist corrosion from either side. Nevertheless, they may become internally fouled during operation by bacteria or algae in the cooling water or by mineral scaling, all of which inhibit heat transfer and reduce [[thermodynamic efficiency]]. Many plants include an automatic cleaning system that circulates sponge rubber balls through the tubes to scrub them clean without the need to take the system off-line.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

The cooling water used to condense the steam in the condenser returns to its source without having been changed other than having been warmed. If the water returns to a local water body (rather than a circulating cooling tower), it is often tempered with cool 'raw' water to prevent thermal shock when discharged into that body of water.

Another form of condensing system is the air-cooled condenser. The process is similar to that of a [[radiator]] and fan. Exhaust heat from the low-pressure section of a steam turbine runs through the condensing tubes, the tubes are usually finned and ambient air is pushed through the fins with the help of a large fan. The steam condenses to water to be reused in the water-steam cycle. Air-cooled condensers typically operate at a higher temperature than water-cooled versions. While saving water, the efficiency of the cycle is reduced (resulting in more carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour of electricity).

From the bottom of the condenser, powerful [[condensate pump]]s recycle the condensed steam (water) back to the water/steam cycle.

===Reheater===
Power station furnaces may have a reheater section containing tubes heated by hot flue gases outside the tubes. Exhaust steam from the high-pressure turbine is passed through these heated tubes to collect more energy before driving the intermediate and then low-pressure turbines.

===Air path===
External fans are provided to give sufficient air for combustion. The Primary air fan takes air from the atmosphere and, first warms the air in the air preheater for better economy. Primary air then passes through the coal pulverizers, and carries the coal dust to the burners for injection into the furnace. The Secondary air fan takes air from the atmosphere and, first warms the air in the air preheater for better economy. Secondary air is mixed with the coal/primary air flow in the burners.

The induced draft fan assists the FD fan by drawing out combustible gases from the furnace, maintaining a slightly negative pressure in the furnace to avoid leakage of combustion products from the boiler casing.

==Steam turbine generator==
{{Main|Turbo generator}}

[[File:Dampfturbine Laeufer01.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Rotor of a modern steam turbine, used in a power station]]
The turbine generator consists of a series of steam [[turbine]]s interconnected to each other and a generator on a common shaft. There is usually a high-pressure turbine at one end, followed by an intermediate-pressure turbine, and finally one, two, or three low-pressure turbines, and the generator. As steam moves through the system and loses pressure and thermal energy, it expands in volume, requiring increasing diameter and longer blades at each succeeding stage to extract the remaining energy. The entire rotating mass may be over 200 metric tons and {{convert|100|ft|m|sigfig=1}} long. It is so heavy that it must be kept turning slowly even when shut down (at 3 [[revolutions per minute|rpm]]) so that the shaft will not bow even slightly and become unbalanced. This is so important that it is one of only six functions of blackout emergency power batteries on site. (The other five being [[emergency lighting]], [[communication]], station alarms, generator hydrogen seal system, and turbogenerator lube oil.)

For a typical late 20th-century power station, superheated steam from the boiler is delivered through {{convert|14|-|16|in|mm|adj=on}} diameter piping at {{convert|2400|psi|MPa atm|abbr=on}} and {{convert|1000|F|C|-1}} to the high-pressure turbine, where it falls in pressure to {{convert|600|psi|MPa atm|abbr=on}} and to {{convert|600|F|C|-1}} in temperature through the stage. It exits via {{convert|24|-|26|in|mm|adj=on}} diameter cold reheat lines and passes back into the boiler, where the steam is reheated in special reheat pendant tubes back to {{convert|1000|F|C|-1}}. The hot reheat steam is conducted to the intermediate pressure turbine, where it falls in both [[temperature]] and [[pressure]] and exits directly to the long-bladed low-pressure turbines and finally exits to the condenser.

The generator, typically about {{convert|30|ft|m|sigfig=1}} long and {{convert|12|ft|m}} in diameter, contains a stationary [[stator]] and a spinning [[Rotor (electric)|rotor]], each containing miles of heavy [[copper]] conductor. There is generally no permanent [[magnet]], thus preventing [[black start]]s. In operation it generates up to 21,000 [[ampere]]s at 24,000 [[volt]]s [[alternating current|AC]] (504&amp;nbsp;MWe) as it spins at either 3,000 or 3,600 [[revolutions per minute|rpm]], synchronized to the [[power grid]]. The rotor spins in a sealed chamber cooled with [[hydrogen]] gas, selected because it has the highest known [[heat transfer coefficient]] of any gas and for its low [[viscosity]], which reduces [[windage]] losses. This system requires special handling during startup, with air in the chamber first displaced by [[carbon dioxide]] before filling with hydrogen. This ensures that a highly [[explosive]] hydrogen–[[oxygen]] environment is not created.

The [[utility frequency|power grid frequency]] is 60 [[Hertz|Hz]] across [[North America]] and 50&amp;nbsp;Hz in [[Europe]], [[Oceania]], [[Asia]] ([[Korea]] and parts of [[Japan]] are notable exceptions), and parts of [[Africa]]. The desired frequency affects the design of large turbines, since they are highly optimized for one particular speed.

The electricity flows to a distribution yard where [[transformer]]s increase the voltage for transmission to its destination.

The [[turbo generator|steam turbine-driven generators]] have auxiliary systems enabling them to work satisfactorily and safely. The steam turbine generator, being rotating equipment, generally has a heavy, large-diameter shaft. The shaft therefore requires not only supports but also has to be kept in position while running. To minimize the frictional resistance to the rotation, the shaft has a number of [[bearing (mechanical)|bearings]]. The bearing shells, in which the shaft rotates, are lined with a low-friction material like [[Babbitt metal]]. Oil lubrication is provided to further reduce the friction between shaft and bearing surface and to limit the heat generated.

==Stack gas path and cleanup==
{{See also|Flue-gas emissions from fossil-fuel combustion|Flue-gas desulfurization}}

As the combustion [[flue gas]] exits the boiler it is routed through a rotating flat basket of metal mesh which picks up heat and returns it to incoming fresh air as the basket rotates. This is called the [[air preheater]]. The gas exiting the boiler is laden with [[fly ash]], which are tiny spherical ash particles. The flue gas contains [[nitrogen]] along with combustion products [[carbon dioxide]], [[sulfur dioxide]], and [[NOx|nitrogen oxides]]. The fly ash is removed by [[dust collector#Fabric filters|fabric bag filters]] in [[baghouse]]s or [[electrostatic precipitator]]s. Once removed, the fly ash byproduct can sometimes be used in the manufacturing of [[concrete]]. This cleaning up of flue gases, however, only occurs in plants that are fitted with the appropriate technology. Still, the majority of coal-fired power stations in the world do not have these facilities.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Legislation in Europe has been efficient to reduce flue gas pollution. Japan has been using flue gas cleaning technology for over 30 years and the US has been doing the same for over 25 years. China is now beginning to grapple with the pollution caused by coal-fired power stations.

Where required by law, the sulfur and nitrogen oxide [[pollutant]]s are removed by [[flue-gas desulfurization|stack gas scrubbers]] which use a pulverized [[limestone]] or other [[alkaline]] wet slurry to remove those pollutants from the exit stack gas. Other devices use [[catalytic converter|catalysts]] to remove nitrous oxide compounds from the flue-gas stream. The gas travelling up the [[flue-gas stack]] may by this time have dropped to about {{convert|50|C|F|-1}}. A typical flue-gas stack may be {{convert|150|-|180|m|ft|sigfig=2}} tall to disperse the remaining flue gas components in the atmosphere. The tallest flue-gas stack in the world is {{convert|419.7|m|ft|sigfig=4}} tall at the [[Ekibastuz GRES-2 Power Station]] in [[Kazakhstan]].

In the United States and a number of other countries, [[atmospheric dispersion modeling]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The United States also requires the height of a flue-gas stack to comply with what is known as the "[[good engineering practice]]" (GEP) stack height.&lt;ref&gt;''Guideline for Determination of Good Engineering Practice Stack Height (Technical Support Document for the Stack Height Regulations), Revised'', 1985, EPA Publication No. EPA–450/4–80–023R, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (NTIS No. PB 85–225241)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, Jr., R. E. and W. H. Snyder, 1983. ''Determination of Good Engineering Practice Stack Height: A Demonstration Study for a Power Plant'', 1983, EPA Publication No. EPA–600/3–83–024. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (NTIS No. PB 83–207407)&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of existing flue gas stacks that exceed the GEP stack height, any air pollution dispersion modeling studies for such stacks must use the GEP stack height rather than the actual stack height.

===Fly ash collection===
[[Fly ash]] is captured and removed from the flue gas by electrostatic precipitators or fabric bag filters (or sometimes both) located at the outlet of the furnace and before the induced draft fan. The fly ash is periodically removed from the collection hoppers below the precipitators or bag filters. Generally, the fly ash is pneumatically transported to storage silos for subsequent transport by trucks or railroad cars.

===Bottom ash collection and disposal===

At the bottom of the furnace, there is a hopper for collection of [[bottom ash]].  This hopper is kept filled with water to quench the ash and clinkers falling down from the furnace.  Arrangements are included to crush the [[clinker (waste)|clinkers]] and convey the crushed clinkers and bottom ash to a storage site.  Ash extractors are used to discharge ash from municipal solid waste–fired boilers.

==Auxiliary systems==
===Boiler make-up water treatment plant and storage===
Since there is continuous withdrawal of steam and continuous return of [[condensation|condensate]] to the boiler, losses due to [[boiler blowdown|blowdown]] and leakages have to be made up to maintain a desired water level in the boiler steam drum. For this, continuous make-up water is added to the boiler water system. Impurities in the raw water input to the plant generally consist of [[calcium]] and [[magnesium]] salts which impart [[water hardness|hardness]] to the water. Hardness in the make-up water to the boiler will form deposits on the tube water surfaces which will lead to overheating and failure of the tubes. Thus, the salts have to be removed from the water, and that is done by a water demineralising treatment plant (DM). A DM plant generally consists of cation, anion, and mixed bed exchangers. Any ions in the final water from this process consist essentially of hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions, which recombine to form pure water. Very pure DM water becomes highly corrosive once it absorbs oxygen from the atmosphere because of its very high affinity for oxygen.

The capacity of the DM plant is dictated by the type and quantity of salts in the raw water input. However, some storage is essential as the DM plant may be down for maintenance. For this purpose, a storage tank is installed from which DM water is continuously withdrawn for boiler make-up. The storage tank for DM water is made from materials not affected by corrosive water, such as [[polyvinyl chloride|PVC]]. The piping and valves are generally of stainless steel. Sometimes, a steam blanketing arrangement or stainless steel doughnut float is provided on top of the water in the tank to avoid contact with air. DM water make-up is generally added at the steam space of the [[surface condenser]] (i.e., the vacuum side). This arrangement not only sprays the water but also DM water gets deaerated, with the dissolved gases being removed by a de-aerator through an ejector attached to the condenser.

===Fuel preparation system===
[[File:Coal Conveyors at Salem Harbor Station.jpg|thumb|right|Conveyor system for moving coal (visible at far left) into a power station.]]
In coal-fired power stations, the raw feed coal from the coal storage area is first crushed into small pieces and then conveyed to the coal feed hoppers at the boilers. The coal is next [[pulverizers|pulverized]] into a very fine powder. The pulverizers may be [[ball mill]]s, rotating drum [[mill (grinding)|grinders]], or other types of grinders.

Some power stations burn [[fuel oil]] rather than coal. The oil must kept warm (above its [[pour point]]) in the fuel oil storage tanks to prevent the oil from congealing and becoming unpumpable. The oil is usually heated to about 100&amp;nbsp;°C before being pumped through the furnace fuel oil spray nozzles.

Boilers in some power stations use [[natural-gas processing|processed natural gas]] as their main fuel. Other power stations may use processed natural gas as auxiliary fuel in the event that their main fuel supply (coal or oil) is interrupted. In such cases, separate gas burners are provided on the boiler furnaces.

===Barring gear===
[[Barring engine|Barring gear]] (or "turning gear") is the mechanism provided to rotate the turbine generator shaft at a very low speed after unit stoppages. Once the unit is "tripped" (i.e., the steam inlet valve is closed), the turbine coasts down towards standstill. When it stops completely, there is a tendency for the turbine shaft to deflect or bend if allowed to remain in one position too long. This is because the heat inside the turbine casing tends to concentrate in the top half of the casing, making the top half portion of the shaft hotter than the bottom half. The shaft therefore could warp or bend by millionths of inches.

This small shaft deflection, only detectable by eccentricity meters, would be enough to cause damaging vibrations to the entire steam turbine generator unit when it is restarted. The shaft is therefore automatically turned at low speed (about one percent rated speed) by the barring gear until it has cooled sufficiently to permit a complete stop.

===Oil system===
An auxiliary oil system pump is used to supply oil at the start-up of the steam turbine generator. It supplies the hydraulic oil system required for steam turbine's main inlet steam stop valve, the governing control valves, the bearing and seal oil systems, the relevant hydraulic relays and other mechanisms.

At a preset speed of the turbine during start-ups, a pump driven by the turbine main shaft takes over the functions of the auxiliary system.

===Generator cooling===
While small generators may be cooled by air drawn through filters at the inlet, larger units generally require special cooling arrangements. [[Hydrogen]] gas cooling, in an oil-sealed casing, is used because it has the highest known [[heat transfer coefficient]] of any gas and for its low [[viscosity]] which reduces [[windage]] losses. This system requires special handling during start-up, with air in the generator enclosure first displaced by [[carbon dioxide]] before filling with hydrogen. This ensures that the highly [[flammable]] hydrogen does not mix with [[oxygen]] in the air.

The hydrogen pressure inside the casing is maintained slightly higher than [[atmospheric pressure]] to avoid outside air ingress. The hydrogen must be sealed against outward leakage where the shaft emerges from the casing. Mechanical seals around the shaft are installed with a very small annular gap to avoid rubbing between the shaft and the seals. Seal oil is used to prevent the hydrogen gas leakage to atmosphere.

The generator also uses water cooling. Since the generator coils are at a potential of about 22 [[kilovolt|kV]], an insulating barrier such as Teflon is used to interconnect the water line and the generator high-voltage windings. Demineralized water of low conductivity is used.

===Generator high-voltage system===
The generator voltage for modern utility-connected generators ranges from {{nowrap|11 kV}} in smaller units to {{nowrap|30 kV}} in larger units. The generator high-voltage leads are normally large aluminium channels because of their high current as compared to the cables used in smaller machines. They are enclosed in well-grounded aluminium bus ducts and are supported on suitable insulators. The generator high-voltage leads are connected to step-up [[transformer]]s for connecting to a high-voltage [[electrical substation]] (usually in the range of 115 kV to 765 kV) for further transmission by the local power grid.

The necessary [[power-system protection|protection]] and metering devices are included for the high-voltage leads. Thus, the steam turbine generator and the transformer form one unit. Smaller units may share a common generator step-up transformer with individual circuit breakers to connect the generators to a common bus.

===Monitoring and alarm system===
Most of the power station operational controls are automatic. However, at times, manual intervention may be required. Thus, the plant is provided with monitors and alarm systems that alert the plant operators when certain operating parameters are seriously deviating from their normal range.

===Battery-supplied emergency lighting and communication===
A central battery system consisting of [[lead–acid battery|lead–acid cell]] units is provided to supply emergency electric power, when needed, to essential items such as the power station's control systems, communication systems, generator hydrogen seal system, turbine lube oil pumps, and emergency lighting. This is essential for a safe, damage-free shutdown of the units in an emergency situation.

===Circulating water system===
{{See also|Circulating water plant}}
To dissipate the thermal load of main turbine exhaust steam, condensate from gland steam condenser, and condensate from Low Pressure Heater by providing a continuous supply of cooling water to the main condenser thereby leading to condensation.

The consumption of cooling water by inland power stations is estimated to reduce power availability for the majority of thermal power stations by 2040–2069.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v6/n4/full/nclimate2903.html |title=Power-generation system vulnerability and adaptation to changes in climate and water resources |date=4 January 2016 |accessdate=28 March 2016 |author= Michelle T.

==Transport of coal fuel to site and to storage==
&lt;!-- this section too specific for [thermal power station] - is there a cleanup template for that? --&gt;
{{Main|Fossil fuel power station#Fuel transport and delivery}}

Most thermal stations use coal as the main fuel. Raw coal is transported from [[coal mining|coal mines]] to a power station site by [[truck]]s, [[barge]]s, [[collier (ship type)|bulk cargo ships]], or [[tender (rail)|railway cars]]. Generally, when shipped by railway, the coal cars are sent as a full train of cars. The coal received at site may be of different sizes. The railway cars are unloaded at site by rotary dumpers or side tilt dumpers to tip over onto conveyor belts below. The coal is generally conveyed to crushers which crush the coal to about {{convert|3/4|in}} size. The crushed coal is then sent by belt conveyors to a storage pile. Normally, the crushed coal is compacted by bulldozers, as compacting of highly volatile coal avoids spontaneous ignition.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

The crushed coal is conveyed from the storage pile to silos or hoppers at the boilers by another belt conveyor system.

'''Ukrainian Optical Facilities for Near-Earth Space Surveillance Network''', the '''UMOS''' (from [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] [[acronym]]: '''УМОС''' = ''Українська мережа оптичних станцій дослідження навколоземного космічного простору'') is an alliance of Ukrainian institutional research [[Observatory|observatories]] and optical facilities of [[State Space Agency of Ukraine|State Space Agency]]. Its strategic tasks include near-Earth space
research (from [[Low Earth orbit|LEO]] to [[High Earth orbit|HEO]]), and the studies of motion of selected objects by development and improvement of theory, models and algorithms. Also it is aimed at addressing tactical problems like
assistance in Ukrainian or international space launches. The UMOS's field of view covers large area of
space, its facilities arrangement allows to carry out the observations of 3-4 consecutive passes of [[Low Earth orbiting satellite|LEO satellites]], as well as synchronous and complementing observations.

The UMOS has conducted the ground-based surveillance of Near-Earth objects since the establishment of the network. The results of data processing earned positive feedbacks from customers in Ukraine: [[State Space Agency of Ukraine|the State Space Agency]], [[:uk:Головна астрономічна обсерваторія НАН України|the Main Astronomical Observatory]] as well as our partners abroad. In particular, since 2011 the UMOS (some of the observatories since 2005) has conducted maintenance the first circuits after launching into orbit ([[Sun-synchronous orbit|Sun-synchronous]]) with [[Dnepr (rocket)|Dnepr]] to identify and/or refine orbits of space objects (e.g. [[RapidEye]], [[EgyptSat 1|EgyptSat‑1]], [[CryoSat-2|CryoSat‑2]], [[:uk:Січ-2|Sich‑2]], corresponding R/B of [[Space launch vehicle|launcher]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

Also the UMOS carries out optical observations of active [[satellite]]s and [[space debris]] on a single joint list to produce independent [[Two-line element set|TLE]] catalog and to estimate the probabilities of [[Satellite collision|satellite orbital conjunction]] for priority satellites, which meets the requirements of national Control Systems and Space Environment Analysis&lt;ref&gt;[http://spacecenter.gov.ua/proekti/skako Система контролю і аналізу космичної обстановки] (in Ukrainian).&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e. similar to Space Situational Awareness). During just 2012 over 130,000 of [[Equatorial coordinate system|position estimates]] for 194 LEO space objects (including series [[RapidEye]], [[Orbcomm (satellite)|Orbcomm]], [[CubeSat]]), 37 [[MEO]] objects, 29 [[Geostationary orbit|GEO]] and [[Geosynchronous orbit|GSO]] objects and also [[High Earth orbit|HEO]] [[space observatory]] [[RadioAstron|Radioastron]] were obtained. As a result, the observation-based database was created, which had comprised 1509 sets of [[Two-line element set|TLE]] for 183 space objects until the end of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

Recently, due to the increase in number of [[space debris]] and [[solar activity]] maximum, the operational failures at satellites are much more frequent. [[Photometry (astronomy)|Photometric]] observations can aid in satellite in-orbit status analysis and provide with necessary data for the assessment of feasibility of their recovery.

The [[Photometry (astronomy)|photometric]] observations and data analysis for five tumbling satellites have been made since 2010. Among these five satellites were: two launch failures&lt;ref&gt;[[2011 in spaceflight#Launch failures|Launch failures in 2011.]]&lt;/ref&gt; - [[Express AM4 Russian Satellite|Express-AM4]] (5,775&amp;nbsp;kg mass at altitude of 1,000&amp;nbsp;km),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All these satellites, except [[Phobos-Grunt]], are non-resolved objects, thus photometry has been the only source of in-orbit status information. Over 50,000 photometric brightness estimates were obtained for the satellites both in the integral light and broadband [[UBV photometric system|BVR Johnson system]] [[Optical filter|filters]]. The UMOS is proven capable to run the whole study, from primary observations to analysis of the [[light curve]]s and further determination of satellite orientation variations and origin of its possible damage.

The '''Walters Shoals''' is a group of [[Seamount|submerged mountains]] off the coast of [[Madagascar]]. Despite being {{convert|700|km|abbr=out}} from the coast, the tips of some of the mountains are only {{convert|18|m|abbr=out}} below the surface. The Walters Shoals is home to many species of fish, crustaceans, and mollusks.
It was discovered in 1963 by the South African Hydrographic Frigate [[HMSAS Natal (K10)|SAS ''Natal'']] captained by [[Johan Charl Walters|Cmdr Walters]]. When found it had a huge population of [[Galápagos shark]]s but they have since been fished out.
