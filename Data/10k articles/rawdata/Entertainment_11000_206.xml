'''''100,000 Cobbers''''' is a 1942 dramatised documentary made by director [[Ken G. Hall]] for the Australian Department of Information during World War II to boost recruitment into the armed forces. [[Grant Taylor (actor)|Grant Taylor]], [[Joe Valli]] and [[Shirley Ann Richards]] play fictitious characters.

==Plot==
Five men enlist in the AIF – laid back Bill; World War I veteran Scotty, who pretends to be 37 years old; an "old school tie" businessman Peter, who is running his dead father's business, and whose secretary Miss Lane leaves for overseas service as a [[Voluntary Aid Detachment|VAD]]; the rebellious "Bluey" William Baker; and Jim, who leaves behind his new wife, Jean.

Bluey and Bill almost get in a fight when Bluey tries to cut into the line during enlistment but the five soon become friends. The five soldiers go through basic training and become good soldiers. Bill falls for a female chiropodist working at the camp.

Bluey, Bill, Jim and Peter get leave and spend a day at Luna Park in Sydney with their women (Bluey has a girl called "Blondie"), then go to a cabaret. They all toast to the future.

The men then go to a pub before disembarking for overseas. Scotty tells his four mates that he has been kicked out the army for being too old at 48 years old.

The other four go on board while Scotty works in a munitions factory. The final scene is of the four cobbers going into action, Jim, Peter and Bill thinking of their women.

The movie ends with a quote from [[Henry Lawson]], "I tell you the star of the south shall rise... in the lurid clouds of war".

==Cast==
Some of the cast were billed with their military rank:
*Sgt [[John Fleeting]], AIF as Peter Montgomery
*[[Joe Valli]], ex-AIF as Scotty
*Sig. Barry Ross, AIF as William "Bluey" Baker
*Pvte [[Grant Taylor (actor)|Grant Taylor]], AMF as Bill
*Gilbert Ellis as Jim
*[[Aileen Britton|Aileen Britten]] as Miss Lane
*[[Shirley Ann Richards]]
*[[Lorna Westbrook]] as Blondie
*[[Patricia Firman]] as Jean

==Production==
Cinesound Productions were commissioned to make the film by the Department of Information and its Minister [[Harry Foll]]. Director Ken G. Hall said he wanted to make a featurette as opposed to a documentary film. The theme of it was to "show that a man may not have a friend in the world, but from the moment he joins the Army he has "cobbers" in plenty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article134080809 |title=CURRENT TOPICS. |newspaper=[[Newcastle Morning Herald and Miners' Advocate]] |date=13 September 1941 |accessdate=14 March 2015 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Filming began on 15 September 1941 and took 14 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article27945947 |title=FILM OF ARMY LIFE. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=13 September 1941 |accessdate=12 February 2012 |page=12 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various members of the cast were granted leave from the army to appear in the film, including Grant Taylor, John Fleeting and Barry Ross.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17767008 |title=Women's News— AT STUDIO ARMY LEAVE FOR FILM PLAYERS. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=3 October 1941 |accessdate=14 March 2015 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fleeting, Taylor, Joe Vallie, Lorna Westbrook, Aileen Britton and Shirley Ann Richards had all appeared in films for Ken G. Hall previously. A number of amateurs were also used in the cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article54894412 |title=Men of Services In New Film. |newspaper=[[The Mail (Adelaide)|The Mail]] |location=Adelaide |date=11 October 1941 |accessdate=14 March 2015 |page=6 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barry Ross was an experienced stage actor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article97188689 |title=Experienced Artists Behind New Revue. |newspaper=[[Port Lincoln Times]] |location=SA |date=9 October 1952 |accessdate=14 March 2015 |page=1 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''100,000 Cobbers'' was mostly filmed at Liverpool Military camp using national servicemen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17767008 |title=Women's News— AT STUDIO ARMY LEAVE FOR FILM PLAYERS. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=3 October 1941 |accessdate=12 February 2012 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also location shooting at Luna Park.

[[Shirley Ann Richards]] plays a chiropractor. It was her last role in Australia before leaving for Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article55766777 |title=Australian Girl Wins Metro Role. |newspaper=[[The Mail (Adelaide)|The Mail]] |location=Adelaide |date=14 March 1942 |accessdate=14 March 2015 |page=11 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ken Hall later recalled in his memoirs:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It [the film] provided a much bigger snag to make than we had expected: there were next to no troops available to make it with. The army had a few hundred militiamen in camp at Liverpool. They had been called up for national service and home defence, were raw and as yet untrained. Eighteen-year-olds formed a big percentage, and they were out to prove their manhood by stacking their own normal conversation with every four-letter word in the language. As soldiers they had a long way to go, but they were all we had. The veteran NCOs got stuck into them and soon had them in at least rough shape. There was an AIF officers' training school also in the area, with keen young men aspiring to leadership. We were mighty glad to have them, and they provided the front (close-to-camera) people we needed. I'm sure those militiamen were turned into good soldiers eventually and indeed some of them could have been among those originals at Kokoda.&lt;ref&gt;Ken G Hall, ''Directed by Ken G Hall'', Lansdowne Press 1977&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Roden Cutler]] was a liaison officer at Liverpool.

==Release==
While the film was originally made to increase recruitment for the AIF, after Japan entered the war additional footage was shot and the film recut to also appeal to the [[Australian Militia Force]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17790021 |title=NEW ARMY FILM. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=27 February 1942 |accessdate=14 March 2015 |page=9 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was previewed to the Department of Information on 29 January 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17785697 |title=NEW WAR FILMS. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=30 January 1942 |accessdate=14 March 2015 |page=9 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released throughout Australia as a supporting featurette in Greater Union cinemas.

===Critical===
''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' called it "a fine film call to the fighting youth of Australia in this grave hour... the best film Ken Hall as made and it will have particularly nostalgic appeal for old diggers... It is often a quietly moving story."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17791516 |title=NEW FILMS. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=9 March 1942 |accessdate=14 March 2015 |page=7 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The News (Adelaide)|The News]]'' of Adelaide called it "probably the best documentary film Australia has produced... well acted, neatly produced and its action scenes are authentic and moving."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article131950091 |title=A.I.F. Trains For Battle. |newspaper=[[The News (Adelaide)|The News]] |location=Adelaide |date=9 March 1942 |accessdate=14 March 2015 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury]]'' of Hobart wrote that Joe Valli was "outstanding".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article132573629 |title=100,000 COBBERS. |newspaper=[[Illawarra Mercury]] |location=Wollongong, NSW |date=2 April 1942 |accessdate=14 March 2015 |page=8 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The West Australian]]'' wrote that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is a film for everybody, a picture everyone should see and one that no Australian can view without a feeling of pride and genuine emotion...  From the time the recruits reach the enlistment depot every phase of their lives and training is presented with a realism hitherto lacking in some of our propaganda films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article47184467 |title=A FILM FOR EVERYBODY. |newspaper=[[The West Australian]] |location=Perth |date=12 March 1942 |accessdate=14 March 2015 |page=7 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The film was distributed in England and the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article47179063 |title=A.I.F.

==Later release==
In 1947 the army was worried about running short of men to serve in Japan and the islands. They used the film as a recruiting tool in conjunction with the British documentary ''[[The True Glory]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article158245371 |title=Australian Army Seeks Recruits: Campaign Opens. |newspaper=[[The Newcastle Sun]] |location=NSW |date=14 January 1947 |accessdate=14 March 2015 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article161310205 |title=CINEMA RECRUITING UNIT. |newspaper=[[The National Advocate]] |location=Bathurst, NSW |date=22 January 1947 |accessdate=14 March 2015 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''''Angry Brides''''' is an online [[Adobe Flash|flash]]-based [[browser game]] on [[Facebook]].  It was launched by the matchmaking site [[Shaadi.com]] to help raise awareness of [[dowry]] harassment in India.&lt;ref name="mirrorab"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/technology-science/technology/angry-brides-indian-dating-site-173010 | title=Angry Brides: Indian dating site launches anti-dowry Facebook game based on Angry Birds | date=17 January 2012 | agency=[[Daily Mirror]] | accessdate=4 April 2012 | location=UK | pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
In India, [[dowry]]&lt;ref name="jagruti"&gt;[http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/godrej-%E2%80%98nupur-jagruti%E2%80%99dahej-ke-khilaf-ek-awaz_270666.html Moneycontrol.com - Jagruti Ke Khilaf]&lt;/ref&gt; is the payment in cash or other valuable property given to a bridegroom's family along with the bride. A typical dowry may include cash and jewellery.&lt;ref name="tribunerecovery"&gt;{{cite news |title=Dowry death: Police recovers Payal’s items |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2011/20110205/cth2.htm|newspaper=Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Requests for, and payment of, dowry were prohibited under the [[Dowry law in India#The Dowry Prohibition (DP) Act|Dowry Prohibition Act (1961)]] in [[Law of India|Indian civil law]] and subsequently by Sections 304B and 498a of the [[Indian Penal Code]] (IPC), but the practice still continues, illegally.&lt;ref name="illegalpractice"&gt;{{cite news |title=A satire on weddings, dowry and 'match-making aunties' |url=http://www.sify.com/news/a-satire-on-weddings-dowry-and-match-making-aunties-news-national-lfsvPBbghai.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a demanded payment is not made, the groom's family might harass or even kill the bride, often by setting her clothing on fire.  The [[Indian police]] report that every year they receive over 2,500 reports of [[bride-burning]].&lt;ref name="brideburning"&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9608/18/bride.burn/ Bride-burning claims hundreds in India: Practice sometimes disguised as suicide or accident] ''[[CNN]]'', 18 August 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Crime Records Bureau]] of the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (India)|Ministry of Home Affairs]], [[Government of India]], reports that there were about 8,172 [[dowry death]] cases registered in India in 2008.&lt;ref name="ncrbfigures"&gt;[http://ncrb.nic.in/cii2008/cii-2008/figure%20at%20a%20glance.pdf Figures at a Glance] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307222554/http://ncrb.nic.in/cii2008/cii-2008/figure%20at%20a%20glance.pdf |date=7 March 2012 }} [[National Crime Records Bureau]]&lt;/ref&gt; This represents an increase of 14.4% over the 1998 level (7,146).&lt;ref name="ncrbdowry"&gt;[http://ncrb.nic.in/cii2008/Statistics2008.pdf&amp;Page=17 Point No.17, Dowry Deaths] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628215223/http://ncrb.nic.in/cii2008/Statistics2008.pdf |date=28 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ram Bhamidi, senior vice president of [[Shaadi.com]], the Facebook game was developed to raise awareness of the issue.&lt;ref name="reutersref"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/01/16/india-dowry-idINDEE80F08620120116|title="Angry Brides" game targets Indian dowry demands|last=Bhalla|first=Nita|date=16 November 2011|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=6 April 2012|location=New Delhi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Game ==
The landing page of the game shows an eight-armed woman, clad in red and resembling the powerful female Hindu goddess [[Durga]].&lt;ref name="dcref"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/channels/sci-tech/others/%E2%80%98angry-brides%E2%80%99-game-targets-indian-dowry-demands-363|title=‘Angry Brides’ game targets Indian dowry demands|date=17 January 2012|publisher=[[Deccan Chronicle]]|accessdate=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Underneath her is a caption: "A woman will give you strength, care and all the love you need&amp;nbsp;...

Each hit lowers the amount demanded and if the player manages to bring the dowry to zero, they can proceed to the next level.&lt;ref name="rediff"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rediff.com/getahead/slide-show/slide-show-1-gadgets-and-gaming-forget-angry-birds-now-you-can-play-angry-brides/20120216.htm|title=Forget Angry Birds. Now you can play Angry Brides|date=17 January 2012|publisher=Rediff.com|accessdate=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The dowry-demanding grooms are portrayed as a doctor, an engineer or a [[Aviator|pilot]]. The dowry demand starts at {{INR}} 1.5&amp;nbsp;millions (about US$30,000 or GBP18,000) and goes down with each successful hit.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/9019871/Angry-Brides-online-game-in-India-targets-illegal-dowry-demands.html|title='Angry Brides' online game in India targets illegal dowry demands |date=17 January 2012|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|accessdate=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reaction ==
The game was originally meant to be played on [[Facebook]], but Shaadi.com announced its intentions of bringing it out on other platforms citing its success.&lt;ref name="nytimesndtv"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/world/angry-brides-taking-a-swing-at-the-practice-of-dowry-168128|title=Angry Brides: Taking a swing at the practice of dowry|last=Gottipati|first=Sruthi |date=8 January 2012|publisher=[[NDTV]], [[The New York Times]]|accessdate=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''''Balloon Fight'''''|バルーンファイト|Barūn Faito}} is an [[Action game|action]]  video game developed by [[Nintendo]]. The original [[Arcade game|arcade]] version was released for the [[Nintendo VS. System]] as '''''Vs. Balloon Fight''''', and its [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] counterpart was internationally released in 1986. The gameplay is similar to the 1982 game ''[[Joust (video game)|Joust]]'' from [[Williams Electronics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Balloon Fight NES Review|url=http://www.retronintendoreviews.com/balloon-fight-nes-review/|website=Retro Nintendo Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gilbert|first1=Henry|title=A closer look at 10 of the 20 free games current 3DS owners will receive|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/a-closer-look-at-10-of-the-20-free-games-current-3ds-owners-will-receive/|website=Games Radar|date=July 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The home Nintendo Entertainment System version was ported to the [[NEC PC-8801]] in October 1985, the [[Sharp X1]] in November 1985, the [[Game Boy Advance]] as ''Balloon Fight-e'' for the [[Nintendo e-Reader|e-Reader]] in the United States on September 16, 2002, and as part of the [[Classic NES Series|Famicom Mini Series]] in Japan on May 21, 2004.

==Gameplay==
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2018}}
The player controls an unnamed Balloon Fighter with two [[balloon]]s attached to his [[helmet]]. Repeatedly pressing the A button or holding down the B button causes the Balloon Fighter to flap his arms and rise into the air. If a balloon is popped, the player's flotation is decreased, making it harder to rise. A life is lost if both balloons are popped by enemy Balloon Fighters, if the player falls in the [[water]], gets eaten by the large [[piranha]] near the surface of the water, or is hit by lightning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=epNcvgAACAAJ&amp;dq=playing+with+power+nes+classics&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi05ISKoYXaAhWCb1AKHfMEBMkQ6AEIJzAA|title=Playing with Power: Nintendo NES Classics|first1=Garitt|last1=Rocha|first2=Nick von|last2=Esmarch|date=1 November 2016|publisher=DK Games|accessdate=24 March 2018|page=30|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two modes of play: the 1-player/2-player game where the goal is to clear the screen of enemies, and Balloon Trip where the goal is to avoid obstacles in a side-scrolling stage. The original arcade game does not include Balloon Trip, but all the level layouts are completely different so as to take advantage of vertical scrolling in addition to some minor gameplay differences.

===1-player/2-player game===
Defeat all of the enemies on screen to clear the stage. This mode can be played alone or co-operatively with a second player. Each player starts with three extra lives. The 3DS ''Balloon Fight'' port comes with the Download Play option, that allows you to play along with a friend that has another 3DS system.

Enemy Balloon Fighters float around the screen and the player must hit their balloons to defeat them. The enemy can also fall into the water or be eaten by the fish while flying close to the water's surface. If an enemy is defeated or falls into the water, a bubble will rise up the screen which can be hit for extra points. As play progresses through the stages, the number of enemies and platforms increases.

Every three stages is a bonus stage, where the goal is to burst all of the balloons that float up the screen from the chimneys at the bottom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=epNcvgAACAAJ&amp;dq=playing+with+power+nes+classics&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi05ISKoYXaAhWCb1AKHfMEBMkQ6AEIJzAA|title=Playing with Power: Nintendo NES Classics|first1=Garitt|last1=Rocha|first2=Nick von|last2=Esmarch|date=1 November 2016|publisher=DK Games|accessdate=24 March 2018|page=32|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Balloon Trip===
A single-player game where the goal is to avoid the lightning sparks and collect the balloons, aiming to move up the ranks and compete for the high score. The player starts with one life.

Nintendo released a [[Game &amp; Watch]] version of the same name, based on the NES version's Balloon Trip mode. The protagonist is "a Balloon Man". Unlike Balloon Fighters, Balloon Men use rocket suits instead of flapping their hands to elevate while holding balloons.

A sequel to ''Balloon Fight'' called ''[[Balloon Kid]]'' was released on October 1990 in North America and on January 31, 1991 in Europe for the [[Game Boy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Balloon Kid' |url=http://www.nindb.net/game/balloon-kid.html |accessdate=May 28, 2006 |work=NinDB |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723223256/http://www.nindb.net/game/balloon-kid.html |archivedate=July 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which expands from the game's roots and revamped it into a full platforming adventure. This title was not released in Japan on the Game Boy, but colorized versions titled as ''[[Hello Kitty World]]'' (published by ''Character Soft'') for the Famicom and ''Balloon Fight GB'' for the Game Boy Color were later released only in Japan.

In September 2001, the game was ported to the [[Sharp Zaurus]] series of PDAs.&lt;ref name=sharpzaurus/&gt;

Balloon Fighter and Flipper trophies are obtainable in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'', and the Flipper is also a usable item, replacing the Bumper from [[Super Smash Bros.|the previous game]]. The Balloon Fighter was considered for a playable role during the development of ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'', but the [[Ice Climbers]] were chosen instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thomas|first1=Lucas M.|title=SMASH IT UP! - THE "LEAKED" LISTS|url=http://ign.com/articles/2008/01/26/smash-it-up-the-leaked-lists|website=IGN|accessdate=23 November 2014|date=January 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original background music for the Balloon Trip in ''Balloon Fight'' can be heard in ''Melee''{{'}}s [[Ice Climber|Icicle Mountain]] stage as alternate music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Balloon Fight Series'|url=http://www.nindb.net/series/balloon-fight.html|accessdate=Jan 9, 2008|work=NinDB|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619080854/http://nindb.net/series/balloon-fight.html|archivedate=June 19, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The giant fish makes a cameo appearance in ''[[Super Smash Bros.

Stickers of the Balloon Fighter and the Balloon Fight Enemy can be collected in ''Brawl''. In addition, the Villager from the ''[[Animal Crossing]]'' series uses the Balloon Fighter's helmet as one of his special moves in ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U]]''. In the 3DS version of the same game, a stage based on ''Balloon Fight'' appears with the original 8-bit graphics; the same stage returns in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]''.

In the ''[[WarioWare (series)|WarioWare, Inc.]]'' series, some of [[List of recurring WarioWare characters#9-Volt|9-Volt]]'s games are based on ''Balloon Fight''. In ''[[WarioWare: Smooth Moves]]'', there is also a minigame functioning as a three-dimensional version of Balloon Trip; players use the [[Wii Remote]] only for the microgame version, and also use the [[Wii Remote#Nunchuk|Nunchuk]] in the complete 3D Balloon Trip.

The original tech demo for ''[[Yoshi Touch &amp; Go]]'' was called ''Yoshi's Balloon Trip''. ''Balloon Fight'' is the theme for Touch Mode in ''[[Tetris DS]]'', although the mode itself has almost  nothing to do with the game other than the music and decorative graphics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GameSpy Tetris DS Preview|publisher=[[GameSpy]]| url=http://gba.gamespy.com/nintendo-ds/tetris/690722p1.html|accessdate=March 4, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060305204714/http://gba.gamespy.com/nintendo-ds/tetris/690722p1.html| archivedate= March 5, 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 12, 2007, [[Club Nintendo]] released ''Tingle's Balloon Fight'' for the [[Nintendo DS]], an exclusive game featuring [[Tingle]], a Nintendo character who originated from ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'' series. The game is a remake of the home version, featuring the "Balloon Fight" and "Balloon Trip" modes. The levels are expanded slightly to utilize both screens, similar to the arcade game except based entirely around the NES levels. A gallery that contained concept art was also included, where each piece could be unlocked by completing specific in-game tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zeldainmypocket.com/tingles-balloon-fight/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130210035318/http://www.zeldainmypocket.com/tingles-balloon-fight/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=February 10, 2013|title=Zelda in my Pocket's Tingle's Balloon Fight Page|quote=A gallery of concept art was also included in the game. As specific events are completed, greater levels are reached, and the top scores grow higher, more of the gallery images will be unlocked.|accessdate=January 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Balloon Fighter appears in ''[[Super Mario Maker]]'' as an unlockable Mystery Mushroom costume as part of an update.

''Balloon Fight'' has been re-released as part of Nintendo's [[Virtual Console]]. On June 8, 2007, ''Balloon Fight'' was released in Europe, followed by a release in North America on July 16, 2007, and Japan on November 12, 2007. The game was released on Virtual Console for [[Nintendo 3DS]] as part of that system's Ambassador Program in September 2011.

In ''[[Nintendo Land]]'', there is an attraction called Balloon Trip Breeze, that is very similar to Balloon Trip from the original ''Balloon Fight''. 

The game was released on the Wii U Virtual Console service on January 23, 2013 in North America until February 23, 2013 as part of a promotion celebrating the 30th anniversary of the release of the original Nintendo Famicom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goldfarb|first=Andrew|date=2013-01-23|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/01/23/wii-u-virtual-console-os-upgrades-announced|title=Wii U Virtual Console, OS Upgrades Announced|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Balloon Fight'' became the first [[Wii U]] Virtual Console title to be released. 
On November 11, 2016, the game (alongside 29 other games) was included in the [[NES Classic Edition]] (Nintendo Classic Mini in Europe).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/3095790/hardware/nintendos-releasing-a-miniature-nes-console-packed-with-30-classic-games.html|title=Nintendo's releasing a miniature NES console packed with 30 classic games|website=Pcworld.com|accessdate=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Balloon Fight along with ''[[Dr. Mario]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' is offered for those who subscribe to the [[Nintendo Switch]] online service for free which also includes added online play.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/nintendo-switch-online-service-price-features-2017-6|title=Nintendo's new online service offers subscription access to classic games for $20 a year|website=Businessinsider.com|accessdate=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Best Buy Comics''''' is a [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] [[comic book]] by [[Robert Crumb]] and [[Aline Kominsky]] (Later Crumb), published by [[Apex Novelties]] in 1979. All the stories in the book except one were first published by ''[[CoEvolution Quarterly]]''.&lt;ref name=indicia&gt;''Best Buy Comics" indicia: "''Best Buy Comics'', February 1979 — copyright c 1977, 1978, 1979 by R. Crumb. All stories and strips first published in ''[[CoEvolution Quarterly|Coevolution Quarterly]]'', except 'Aline and Bob Go To the Whole Earth Jamboree', which was rejected by the magazine and appears here for the first time.  Published by [[Apex Novelties]]  — 353 Frederick St., San Francisco, California, 94117".&lt;/ref&gt;

''Best Buy Comics'' tackles more "serious" subjects than typical Crumb or others [[underground comix]].  Subjects include the [[aerospace]] program, the eventual fate of humanity, attitudes toward life, death, nuclear war, and [[historical fiction]] set at the dawn of the [[Jazz Age]].

''Best Buy Comics'' was the last title published by [[Apex Novelties]]. It was republished in 1988 by [[Last Gasp]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/issue/264238/ "Best Buy Comics" entry], Grand Comics Database. Accessed Oct. 3, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Block and Sully''' were an American husband and wife [[vaudeville]] team who performed during the years 1926 to 1948.

==Vaudeville==
Jesse Block started performing in vaudeville as a child, getting his first break as a member of [[Gus Edwards (songwriter)|Gus Edwards']] ''Song Revue of 1915''. Later, he developed a song-and-dance act and toured for four years as "Block and Dunlap". In 1926, he was introduced to Eve Sully by [[Bert "The Mad Russian" Gordon|Bert Gordon]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Bill: The Vaudevillians p.75&lt;/ref&gt; Sully was touring in a song-and-dance act with [[Blossom Rock|Blossom MacDonald]], sister of [[Jeanette MacDonald]], but she soon joined Block to form a crosstalk comedy act. The couple married in 1930.

Block and Sully toured together for three years before they played the [[Palace Theatre (Broadway)|Palace Theatre]] for the first time in 1929, and headlined there both in April and October 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Slide, Anthony: The Vaudevillians, A Dictionary of Vaudeville Performers. p.14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==

In the early 1930s, Block and Sully ventured into radio and had their own program. One of the cast members was a young [[Arlene Francis]]. The couple also appeared in a number of film shorts, and were featured in the 1934 feature ''[[Kid Millions]]'' starring their good friend [[Eddie Cantor]]. During [[World War II]], they toured with the [[USO]]. In 1948, Block and Sully played their last vaudeville engagement at Loew's State.

After leaving show business in 1946, Block became a stockbroker with Bache and Company, retiring in 1973. The couple remained happily married until Block died at age 82 on March 27, 1983, at home in [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', March 25, 1983 :https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/25/obituaries/jesse-block.html&lt;/ref&gt; Eve Sully Block died of cardiovascular collapse on August 20, 1990, at Tisch Hospital in Manhattan. She was 88 years old.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', August 11, 1990 :https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/11/obituaries/eva-sully-block-vaudevillian-88.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Festival Juste pour rire de Montréal, Québec.jpg|thumb|right|[[Just for Laughs Festival]] in Montreal, Québec at the [[Théâtre Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis Theatre]]]]
'''Canadian humour''' is an integral part of the [[Canadian culture|Canadian Identity]]. There are several traditions in Canadian humour in both [[Canadian English|English]] and [[Quebec French|French]].  While these traditions are distinct and at times very different, there are common themes that relate to Canadians' shared [[Canadian history|history]] and [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] situation in [[North America]] and the [[world]]. Though neither universally kind nor moderate, humorous Canadian literature has often been branded by author Dick Bourgeois-Doyle as "gentle satire," evoking the notion embedded in humorist [[Stephen Leacock]]'s definition of humour as "the kindly contemplation of the incongruities of life and the artistic expression thereof."&lt;ref&gt;Bourgeois-Doyle, Dick, What's So Funny?: Lessons from Canada's Leacock Medal for Humour Writing. General Store Publishing House, 2015. {{ISBN|978-1-77123-342-2}}. p.57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LynchDavies1988"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gerald Lynch|author2=Alan T. Davies|title=Stephen Leacock: Humour and Humanity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SmxRWqcExpUC&amp;pg=PA26|date=November 1988|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP|isbn=978-0-7735-0652-7|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary characteristics of Canadian humour are irony, parody, and satire.&lt;ref name="Nieguth2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tim Nieguth|title=The Politics of Popular Culture: Negotiating Power, Identity, and Place|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wMjMCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA188|year=2015|publisher=MQUP|isbn=978-0-7735-9685-6|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Various trends can be noted in Canadian comedy. One thread is the portrayal of a "typical" Canadian family in an ongoing radio or television series.  Examples include ''[[La famille Plouffe]]'', with its mix of drama, humour, politics and religion and [[sitcoms]] such as ''[[King of Kensington]]'' and ''[[La Petite Vie]]''. Another major thread tends to be political and cultural [[satire]]: television shows such as ''[[CODCO]],'' ''[[Royal Canadian Air Farce]]'', ''[[La Fin du monde est à 7 heures]]'' and ''[[This Hour Has 22 Minutes]],'' monologuists such as [[Yvon Deschamps]] and [[Rick Mercer]] and writers, including [[Michel Tremblay]], [[Will Ferguson]] and [[Eric Nicol]] draw their material from Canadian and [[Quebec|Québécois]] society and politics. Other comedians portray absurdity; these include the television series ''[[The Kids in the Hall]]'' and ''[[The Frantics (comedy)|The Frantics]],'' and musician-comedians such as [[Arrogant Worms|The Arrogant Worms]], [[Three Dead Trolls in a Baggie]] and [[Bowser and Blue]].  Elements of satire are to be found throughout Canadian humour, evident in each of these threads, and uniting various genres and regional cultural differences.

As with other countries, humour at the expense of regional and ethnic stereotypes can be found in Canada. Examples are '[[Newfie]]' jokes (with 'Newfie' being a colloquial term for a person from the island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]) and jokes revolving around English-speaking Canadians' stereotype of French Canadians,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thetoque.com/canadian_jokes/ |title=Canadian Joles {Archived copy) |work=The Toque|accessdate=2009-01-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091214081704/http://www.thetoque.com/canadian_jokes/ |archivedate=2009-12-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and vice versa.

[[Humber College]] in [[Toronto]] and the École nationale de l'humour in [[Montreal]] offer post-secondary programs in comedy writing and performance. [[Montreal]] is also home to the bilingual ([[Canadian English|English]] and [[Quebec French|French]]) [[Just for Laughs]] festival and to the [[Just for Laughs museum]], a bilingual, international museum of comedy.

==Literature==
{{see also|Literature of Canada}}
According to author Stephen Scobie, Canadian humorous writing has tended more towards prose than poetry.&lt;ref name = Scobie&gt;Scobie, Stephen [http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/humorous-writing-in-english/ "Humorous Writing in English"]. ''The Canadian Encyclopedia.'' Retrieved on: March 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  An early work of Canadian humour, [[Thomas McCulloch]]'s ''Letters of Mephibosheth Stepsure'' (1821–23) appeared in the Halifax weekly ''[[Acadian Recorder]]''.  [[Northrop Frye]]  described McCulloch's satirical letters as "quiet, observant, deeply conservative in a human sense"; he  asserted that McCulloch's persona, the "conventional, old-fashioned, homespun" farmer, was an extension of a centuries-old satiric tradition, and that the letters set the tone for later comedic writing in Canada.&lt;ref name="Frye2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Northrop Frye|title=Northrop Frye on Canada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PPZF8OZflu8C&amp;pg=PA312|year=2003|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-0-8020-3710-7|pages=308, 312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to McCulloch's dry and understated style, [[Thomas Chandler Haliburton]] showed the same conservative social values in the brash, overstated character of [[Sam Slick]], the Yankee Clockmaker. Haliburton's Sam Slick persona in ''The Clockmaker'' (1836), as Arthur Scobie notes in ''The [[Canadian Encyclopedia]]'', "proved immensely popular and, ironically, has influenced American humour as much as Canadian."&lt;ref name = Scobie /&gt;

Authors responded with folk humour and satire to the domination of 19th-century [[French Canadian]] culture by the [[Catholic Church]].  [[Napoléon Aubin]] satirized Quebec public life in his journals ''Le Fantasque'' (1837–45) and ''Le Castor'' (1843), and through his theatre troupe, ''Les Amateurs typographiques, '' established in 1839.  He was imprisoned during that same year for his views.&lt;ref name="Project2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=History of the Book in Canada Project|title=History of the Book in Canada: Beginnings to 1840|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c-tL5pWvq-kC&amp;pg=PA391|year=2004|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-0-8020-8943-4|page=391}}&lt;/ref&gt; This cosmopolitan tradition is also seen in the journalism of Arthur Buies, editor of ''La Lanterne canadienne'' (1868–69), a highly satirical journal of that era.&lt;ref name = Lacombe&gt;Lacombe, Michelle [http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/humorous-writing-in-french/ "Humorous Writing in French"].

Light comedy that mocked local customs was typical of 19th-century [[theatre]] in Quebec.  Examples include [[Joseph Quesnel]]'s ''L'Anglomanie, ou le dîner à l'angloise'' (1803), which criticized the imitation of English customs,&lt;ref name="Grutmanquébécoises1997"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rainier Grutman|author2=Université de Montréal. Centre d'études québécoises|title=Des langues qui résonnent: l'hétérolinguisme au XIXe siècle québécois|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jceulY_PD-kC&amp;pg=PA48|year=1997|publisher=Les Editions Fides|isbn=978-2-7621-1905-3|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pierre Petitclair]]'s ''Une partie de campagne'' (1865). More serious [[drama]]s attacked specific targets: the anonymous ''Les Comédies du status quo'' (1834) ridiculed local politics, and ''Le Défricheteur de langue'' (1859) by Isodore Mesplats, (pseudonym of Joseph LaRue and Joseph-Charles Taché), mocked [[Paris]]ian manners.  Other examples of theatrical satire were Félix-Gabriel Marchand's comedy, ''Les faux brillants'' (1885) and Louvigny de Montigny's ''Les Boules de neige'' (1903), which took aim at [[Montreal]]'s [[bourgeoisie]].&lt;ref name = Lacombe/&gt; Humorous magazines in French included ''La Guêpe'', "journal qui pique", published in [[Montreal]] 1857-1861.

By the early 20th century, the satirical tradition was well developed in [[English Canada]] as exemplified in the writing of Stephen Leacock.  In ''[[Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town]]'' (1912), Leacock, already known for his satirical wit, used tragic irony and astute insight in examining day-to-day, small-town life.  The book remains a classic of Canadian literature,&lt;ref name="Nischik2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Reingard M. Nischik|title=The Canadian Short Story: Interpretations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LLwj_ZQBkhwC&amp;pg=PA53|year=2007|publisher=Camden House|isbn=978-1-57113-127-0|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was followed by ''[[Arcadian Adventures with the Idle Rich]]'' in 1914. An annual Canadian literary award, the [[Stephen Leacock Memorial Medal for Humour]], is named in his memory.&lt;ref name = Scobie/&gt; The award is presented to the year's best work of humorous literature by a Canadian. [[Donald Jack]], three-time winner of the Leacock Medal, wrote a number of comedies for the stage, radio, and television, but is best known for his nine-part series of novels about aviator [[Bartholomew Bandy]].&lt;ref name="Wilson1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joyce Wilson|title=Canadian Book Review Annual|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dFMWAQAAMAAJ|year=1996|publisher=Peter Martin Associates.|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the ''[[Quiet Revolution|Révolution tranquille]]'' in Quebec, theatrical satire reappeared in 1968 with [[Michel Tremblay]]'s play ''[[Les Belles Soeurs|Les Belles sœurs]],'' written in Québécois [[joual]].  The controversial play picked apart the myth of a stable bourgeois Quebec society with a mix of realistic comedy and allegorical satire.&lt;ref name="Constantinidis2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stratos E. Constantinidis|title=Text &amp; Presentation, 2005|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UHR3r8N5CgwC&amp;pg=PA70|date=30 December 2005|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-5540-9|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following Tremblay's lead, Jean Barbeau exposed Quebec popular culture in ''La Coupe stainless'' (1974).  Tremblay and Barbeau set the stage for reviews such as ''Broue'' (1979), a collective production, which toured English-speaking Canada as ''Brew'' (1982).&lt;ref name = Lacombe/&gt;

Humorous fiction in French Canada draws from the oral tradition of [[folk songs]] and [[Folklore|folktales]] which were the common coin of humour in the 19th century. Only a few of these folk tales surfaced in writing prior to the 20th century.  However, contemporary writers such as [[Jacques Ferron]] (''Contes du pays incertain,'' 1962) in Quebec&lt;ref name="Patry2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Patry|title=À contre-langue et à courre d'idées: Étude du vocabulaire étranger francisé et du discours polémique dans l'œuvre de Jacques Ferron|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c489DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT454|date=2013-12-01|publisher=Les Presses de l'Université de Montréal|isbn=978-2-7606-3279-0|page=454}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Antonine Maillet]] in [[Acadian]] [[New Brunswick]] (''La Sagouine,'' 1974, and ''Pélagie-la-Charette,'' 1979), rely extensively on folk humour and popular culture. Other Quebec writers noted for their humour include [[Roger Lemelin]],&lt;ref name="Morton2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Suzanne Morton|title=At Odds: Gambling and Canadians, 1919-1969|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gRGNBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP90|date=15 December 2003|publisher=University of Toronto Press, Scholarly Publishing Division|isbn=978-1-4426-5895-0|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gérard Bessette]], [[Jacques Godbout]], [[Roch Carrier]] and [[Yves Beauchemin]].&lt;ref name = Lacombe/&gt;  Beauchemin's [[picaresque novel]] ''Le Matou'' (1981) is the all-time best-selling novel in Quebec literature.

The plain talking alter-ego as an instrument of satire continued with [[Robertson Davies]]' series of [[Samuel Marchbanks]] books (1947–67) and [[John Metcalf (writer)|John Metcalf]]'s James Wells in ''[[General Ludd]]'' (1980).&lt;ref name = Scobie/&gt; Davies is one of many Canadian writers of "serious" literature who were also known for humour in their work.&lt;ref name="Maes2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicholas Maes|title=Robertson Davies: Magician of Words|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MviL-j_hCScC&amp;pg=PA68|date=23 March 2009|publisher=Dundurn|isbn=978-1-77070-374-2|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Margaret Atwood]], [[Farley Mowat]], [[Paul Quarrington]], [[Mordecai Richler]], [[Raymond Fraser]], [[Carol Shields]], [[W. O. Mitchell]], [[Ray Guy]], [[Pierre Berton]], [[M.A.C. Farrant]] and [[Miriam Toews]] are all well-known writers of mainstream literature who have also been acknowledged for using humour and wit in their writing. Many other writers of Canadian humour have been published as newspaper or magazine commentators, including [[Gary Lautens]], [[Richard J. Needham]], [[Eric Nicol]], [[Joey Slinger]], [[Will Ferguson]], [[Marsha Boulton]] and [[Linwood Barclay]].

Humour is also central to the work of Canadian children's writers such as [[Gordon Korman]], [[Dennis Lee (author)|Dennis Lee]] and [[Robert Munsch]].

==Music==

Particularly in recent years, Canada has produced a number of musical groups who have been described as "comedy rock". Bands such as [[Barenaked Ladies]], [[Odds (band)|Odds]], [[Crash Test Dummies]], [[The Awkward Stage]] and [[Rheostatics]] are sometimes misunderstood as being strictly novelty bands, but in fact many of their songs use humour to illuminate more serious themes. A number of other acts, such as [[Corky and the Juice Pigs]], [[Arrogant Worms]], [[Three Dead Trolls in a Baggie]] and [[Bowser and Blue]] write specifically comedic songs.

[[Nancy White (singer-songwriter)|Nancy White]] is a noted Canadian musical satirist, whose comedic [[folk music|folk]] songs about Canadian culture and politics have regularly appeared on [[CBC Radio One|CBC Radio]] programs.

In addition to more serious material on his primary albums, folk musician [[Geoff Berner]] — who has also run for political office as a candidate of the [[Rhinoceros Party of Canada (1963–1993)|Rhinoceros Party]] — frequently releases pointedly satirical songs, such as "Official Theme Song for the 2010 Vancouver / Whistler Olympic Games (The Dead Children Were Worth It!)", as free downloads from his website.

Don Ast, a stand-up comedian who performed in character as befuddled Ukrainian immigrant [[Nestor Pistor]], had his greatest popular success with an album in which he sang [[country music|country]] songs in character as Pistor.&lt;ref&gt;"Nestor Pistor, Winestoned Plowboy". ''Ontario Library Review'', Volumes 62-63 (1978). p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; His single "Winestoned Plowboy", a parody of [[Glen Campbell]]'s "[[Rhinestone Cowboy]]", was a hit on Canada's country music charts in 1977;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/films-videos-sound-recordings/rpm/Pages/image.aspx?Image=nlc008388.4463&amp;URLjpg=http%3a%2f%2fwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca%2fobj%2f028020%2ff4%2fnlc008388.4463.gif&amp;Ecopy=nlc008388.4463 "RPM Country Playlist"]. ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'', February 12, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; Pistor returned to more conventional standup comedy thereafter, but received three [[Juno Award]] nominations for [[Juno Award for Comedy Album of the Year|Comedy Album of the Year]] in the next three years.

[[Jann Arden]], a singer-songwriter renowned for writing sad love songs, is also paradoxically known as one of Canada's funniest live performers, whose witty, unpretentious stage [[patter]] about herself and her family is as much a part of her relationship with her audience as her music is. Hip hop musician [[Shad (rapper)|Shad]] is also known for using comedy and humour in his music; for one of his most successful singles to date, "The Old Prince Still Lives at Home", he filmed a video in which he essentially played [[Will Smith]] in a parody of the opening credits to ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel Air]]''.

Another noted Canadian musical comedian is [[Mary Lou Fallis]], an [[opera]] singer who performs both in classical opera roles and as the comedic character "Primadonna", a touring stage show in which she parodies popular stereotypes of opera [[diva]]s.

Canadian heavy metal frontman [[Devin Townsend]] is known for using humour in his music. Projects such as [[Punky Bruster]] and [[Ziltoid the Omniscient]] are heavily comedy driven, and Devin's heavy metal band, [[Strapping Young Lad]], use satire and sarcastic tongue in cheek lyrics as well.

==Radio==

Many of Canada's comedy acts and performers have started out on radio, primarily on the national [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC) network.

While individual comedy show and segments have been around almost as long as the network, the focus has tended be more on specific shows featuring particular groups of comedians. The real beginnings of Canadian radio comedy began in the late 1930s with the debut of ''[[The Happy Gang]]'', a long-running weekly variety show that was regularly sprinkled with corny jokes in between tunes. It debuted in 1938 and ran until 1959. The ''[[Wayne &amp; Shuster]]'' show debuted on CBC radio in 1946, their more literate and classy humour regularly appearing on the airwaves well into the early 1960s.
[[Max Ferguson]]'s long-running shows ''After Breakfast Breakdown'' and ''the Max Ferguson Show'' featured short satirical skits based on current events, with a variety of characters voiced by Ferguson.

The ''[[Royal Canadian Air Farce]]'' started as a radio show debuting in 1973 featuring mainly political and some character-based comedy sketches. It ran for 24 years before making a permanent transition to television. It started a tradition of topical and politically satirical radio shows that inspired such programs as ''[[Double Exposure (comedy series)|Double Exposure]]'', ''The Muckraker'' and ''[[What a Week]]''.

A zanier, more surreal brand of radio comedy was unveiled in the early 1980s with the debut of [[The Frantics (comedy)|The Frantics]]' ''Frantic Times'' radio show, which ran from 1981 to 1986. Its smart and surreal style fostered a new take on Canadian radio comedy that was followed by the likes of successor shows as ''[[The Norm (radio)|The Norm]]'', ''[[Radio Free Vestibule]]'' and ''[[The Irrelevant Show]]''.

Another enduring radio comedy program is ''[[The Vinyl Cafe]]'', hosted by [[Stuart McLean]]. The show is centred around McLean's [[List of Dave and Morley stories|Dave and Morley stories]], a series of narrated short stories about a Toronto family and their friends and neighbours; many of the stories have been compiled in book form, and the books have often won or been nominated for the [[Stephen Leacock Memorial Medal for Humour]].

By the 1990s the satirical and zany elements merged into two of the more notable CBC radio comedy shows of the 1990s: ''[[The Dead Dog Cafe Comedy Hour]]'', a show that offered bitingly satirical pieces from a [[First Nations]] perspective mixed in with general silliness; and ''[[Great Eastern (radio show)|Great Eastern]]'', a show set in a fictitious Newfoundland "national" radio station featuring improbable news stories, fictitious archival recordings and unlikely archeological findings played straight.

CBC Radio continues to play an important part in developing comedy performers on radio. ''[[Madly Off In All Directions]]'' became a weekly national forum for regional sketch and stand-up comics, a practice that continues in the more recent series ''[[The Debaters]]'' and ''[[Laugh Out Loud (radio)|Laugh Out Loud]]''.

[[Laugh Attack]], a channel programmed by [[XM Radio Canada]] and broadcast by [[XM Satellite Radio]] to Canada and the United States, features predominantly Canadian comedy.

==Television==
CBC Television's first Canadian-produced television series was ''[[Sunshine Sketches]]'', an adaptation of Stephen Leacock's iconic humour book ''Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town''.

Original Canadian television comedy begins with [[Wayne and Shuster]], a sketch comedy duo who performed as a comedy team during the [[World War II|Second World War]], and moved their act to radio in 1946 before moving on to television. They became one of Canada's most enduring comedy teams on Canadian television and in the [[United States]] as well: they appeared on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' 67 times, a record for any performer. Their [[Julius Caesar]] sketch, ''Rinse the Blood off My Toga'', with its legendary [[catchphrase]], "I told him, Julie, don't go!", was particularly noted.

Wayne and Shuster continued to appear on [[CBC Television]] until the late 1980s, with specials that mixed new sketches with their classic material.

''[[La famille Plouffe]]'', the first regularly scheduled television drama in Canada, was produced in 1953 by [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|Radio-Canada]], in French. The program was broadcast on both English and French networks of CBC TV from 1954 to 1959, (in English as ''The Plouffe Family''). It was a mix of drama, humour and social commentary about a working-class Quebec family in the post-[[World War II]] era. Another of the CBC's earliest productions was a television adaptation of one of the enduring classics of Canadian humour writing, [[Stephen Leacock]]'s ''[[Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town]]''.

Another pioneer in Canadian television comedy was, oddly, a news series. ''[[This Hour Has Seven Days]],'' which debuted in 1964, was primarily meant as a [[newsmagazine]], but its segments included political satire as well as serious news reports. Later series such as ''[[Royal Canadian Air Farce]]'', ''[[This Hour Has 22 Minutes]]'' and ''[[Rick Mercer Report]]'' have all drawn on the tradition of political satire established by ''Seven Days'', and have been among Canadian television's most popular comedy series in recent years.

Canadian born [[Lorne Michaels]], who had moved from Toronto to Los Angeles in 1968 to work on Rowan and Martin's ''[[Laugh-In]]'', launched the [[NBC]] comedy show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in 1975.  Over the years, several Canadians were part of the SNL cast, including [[Dan Aykroyd]], [[Martin Short]], and [[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]]. Michaels also produced ''[[The Kids in the Hall]]'' for Canadian TV in the 1980s.

Many Canadian comedy shows, while not directly about politics per se, have made profound political statements by satirizing society and [[popular culture|pop culture]]. This includes shows such as ''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]'', ''[[Buzz (TV series)|Buzz]]'' and ''[[CODCO]]''. ''CODCO'', in particular, was intensely controversial at times for its use of comedy in tackling sensitive subjects; founding member [[Andy Jones (comedian)|Andy Jones]] quit CODCO in protest after the CBC refused to air a sketch that made a very explicit political statement about the [[Mount Cashel Orphanage]] child abuse scandal. The series ''[[History Bites]]'' was ostensibly a show presenting history in a sketch comedy, but frequently used the historic setting to satirize current political events and social trends.

Other shows, such as ''[[The Kids in the Hall]]'', ''[[The Frantics (comedy)|4 on the Floor]]'', ''[[Bizarre (TV series)|Bizarre]]'' and ''[[Puppets Who Kill]]'', revelled in absurdist humour, making household names out of characters such as [[Chicken Lady]], [[Mr. Canoehead]] and [[Super Dave Osborne]].

Other notable sketch series have included ''[[Zut! (TV series)|Zut!]]'', ''[[The Gavin Crawford Show]]'' and ''[[The Holmes Show]]''. Canadian television also frequently showcases stand-up comedians. The popular series ''[[Comics (TV series)|Comics]]'', based around one comedian each week, has been the first national television exposure for many of Canada's current comedy stars. Another series, ''[[Just for Laughs]]'', has for many years presented comedians appearing at the [[Montreal Comedy Festival]]. That series has also spawned the more recent ''[[Just For Laughs Gags]]'', a practical joke show similar to ''[[Candid Camera]]''.

Although several notable Canadian sitcoms have been produced, such as ''[[King of Kensington]]'', ''[[Hangin' In]]'', ''[[Corner Gas]],'' ''[[Little Mosque on the Prairie]]'', and ''[[Kim's Convenience (TV series)|Kim's Convenience]]'', many other sitcoms, including ''[[Material World (TV series)|Material World]]'', ''[[Mosquito Lake (TV series)|Mosquito Lake]]'', ''[[Snow Job (TV series)|Snow Job]]'', ''[[Check It Out! (Canadian TV series)|Check it Out!]]'', ''[[The Trouble with Tracy]]'', ''[[Rideau Hall (TV series)|Rideau Hall]]'', ''[[Excuse My French (1974 TV series)|Excuse My French]]'' and ''[[Not My Department]]'', have generally fared poorly with critics and audiences. Critic [[Geoff Pevere]] has pointed out, however, that American television has produced a lot of bad sitcoms as well. The difference, according to Pevere, is that the economics of television production in Canada mean that whereas an unpopular American sitcom may be cancelled and largely forgotten after just a few weeks, Canadian television networks can rarely afford to lose their investment — meaning that a Canadian sitcom almost always airs every episode that was produced, ''regardless'' of its performance in the ratings.

On the other hand, Canadian television comedy fares much better when it breaks the sitcom form, especially with [[dramedy]]. Unconventional comedy series such as ''[[The Beachcombers]]'', ''[[Due South]]'', ''[[Made in Canada]]'', ''[[Chilly Beach]]'', ''[[The Newsroom (Canadian TV series)|The Newsroom]]'', ''[[Primetime Glick]]'', ''[[The Red Green Show]]'', ''[[La Petite Vie]]'', ''[[Seeing Things (TV series)|Seeing Things]]'', ''[[Trailer Park Boys]]'', ''[[Supertown Challenge]]'', ''[[Les Bougon]]'' and ''[[Twitch City]]'' have been much more successful than most of Canada's conventional sitcoms, both in Canada and as international exports.

Canada has a national television channel, [[The Comedy Network]], devoted to comedy. Its programming includes some of the classic Canadian comedy series noted above, repeats of several hit American and [[Great Britain|British]] series such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[South Park]]'' and ''[[Absolutely Fabulous]]'', and original series such as ''[[Kevin Spencer (TV series)|Kevin Spencer]]'', ''[[Odd Job Jack]]'', ''The Devil's Advocates'', ''[[Improv Heaven and Hell]]'' and ''[[Puppets Who Kill]]''.

[[Rick Mercer]] began his career in 1990 with a touring one-man show, ''Show Me the Button, I'll Push It'', about Canadian life in the immediate aftermath of the failed [[Meech Lake Accord]]. That show was a sellout success; in 1993, he made his television debut as one of the writers and performers on ''This Hour Has 22 Minutes''. Mercer's "rants", short op-ed pieces on Canadian politics and culture, quickly became the show's signature segment. When he published a collection of rants in 1998 as ''Streeters'', the book quickly became a bestseller. Mercer left ''22 Minutes'' in 2000 to devote more time to his other series, ''[[Made in Canada]]''. When that series ended its run, he launched the new ''[[Rick Mercer Report]]''.

Another famous comedic export in the same era was [[Tom Green]], whose surreal and sometimes grotesque humour on ''[[The Tom Green Show]]'' began as a community cable show in [[Ottawa]] before becoming a hit on [[MTV]].

As with many other genres, Canadian television comedy also frequently plays with the topic of [[Canada-United States relations|Canada's relationship with the United States]]. Mercer turned another ''22 Minutes'' segment, ''[[Talking to Americans]]'', into a 2001 television special, which was a ratings smash. In ''Talking to Americans'', Mercer, in his ''22 Minutes'' guise as reporter "J.B. Dixon", visited American cities to ask people on the street for their opinion on a Canadian news story — the joke for Canadians was that the news story was always fabricated, and either inherently ridiculous (e.g. a border dispute between [[Quebec]] and [[Chechnya]] or an annual [[Toronto]] [[polar bear]] hunt) or blatantly out of context (e.g. wishing Canadians a "Happy [[Stockwell Day]]".)

Another notable show, the sitcom ''[[An American in Canada]]'', reversed that formula, finding comedy in the [[culture shock]] of an American television reporter taking a job with a Canadian TV station. Tom Green once played with this staple of Canadian comedy as well, during a controversial segment in which he burned a Canadian flag.

==Web==
In the same vein as ''Air Farce'' and ''22 Minutes'', a number of notable web sites have emerged to publish articles that either satirize real events or wholly invent stories that lampoon aspects of Canadian culture. [[Frank (magazine)|Frank]] magazine, which originated as a printed publication, has been joined in recent years by The Lapine, [[The Beaverton]] and Mooseclean's, the latter of which are modeled after [[The Onion]] and [[Maclean's]], respectively.

==Comedy clubs==
Notable Canadian comedy clubs and showcases include [[The Second City]] branch in Toronto (originally housed at [[The Old Fire Hall]]), the [[Yuk Yuk's]] chain, and [[The ALTdot COMedy Lounge]]. The top clubs in Canada are Rumor's Comedy Club in Winnipeg, The Comic Strip in Edmonton, The Comedy Mix in Vancouver, and Absolute Comedy in Toronto.

==The Canadian Comedy Awards==

[[The Canadian Comedy Awards]] were founded by [[Tim Progosh]] and Higher Ground Productions in 1999.  Over the past eight years they have given out more than 160 awards in three categories - live comedy, film and television.

The '''Charles W. Eisemann Center for Performing Arts and Corporate Presentations''' is a [[performing arts|performance]] hall which opened in September 2002 in [[Richardson, Texas]]. The center is named for local philanthropist, Charles W. Eisemann, in recognition of a US$2,000,000 gift&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eisemanncenter.com/PR/html/PRCandAEisemannGift.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210110131/http://eisemanncenter.com/PR/html/PRCandAEisemannGift.htm |archivedate=2009-02-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; from the Eisemann Foundation Fund of The Communities Foundation of Texas.

==Facility==
The Eisemann Center is designed to meet the needs of both the performing arts and corporate worlds. The Center features the Margaret and Al Hill Performance Hall, the Bank of America Theatre and the Bank of America Hall. All venues are supported by a generous lobby on three levels. Designed by architect Eurico R. Francisco, AIA, the building was honored with design awards from the American Institute of Architects in 2001 ("Unbuilt Honor Award") and again in 2003 ("Built Honor Award"){{citation needed|date=March 2015}}, in addition to receiving a "Best of Texas Award" for buildings over $50 million from McGraw Hill in 2002.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} David Dillon, the late architecture critic for the Dallas Morning News and Architecture Record, described the Eisemann Center as "...bold, contemporary and every bit the civic showpiece that city officials have been hoping for. (...) Architect Eurico Francisco has based his design on classic modernist principles: light, transparency, clean details and honest use of materials. Not a faux column or cornice anywhere. Although the Eisemann does not break new ground, it covers familiar territory with grace and assurance. (...) Collectively, (these details) make the difference between a static building and a dynamic one. They force us to look at things a second time, to question and to explore, which is what good architecture is supposed to do."{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Margaret and Al Hill Performance Hall===
The Margaret and Al Hill Performance Hall is a 1,563-seat venue, and is noted as one of the largest stage areas in the DFW Metroplex. The construction of this hall was designed to meet the production needs for any performing arts group producing dance, opera, musical theatre as well as other events.

====Seven Muses artwork====
The City of Richardson and supporters of the Charles W. Eisemann Center celebrated the completion and unveiling of the lightpainting “Seven Muses” by artist Stephen Knapp in April 2006. The commission of the lightpainting was made possible by a gift to the City from Jim and Gayla Von Ehr of Richardson.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

In an interview with Adrienne Garnett in Art of the Times, Knapp, when asked about “Seven Muses” said, “I want people to see and feel the energy that is emanating from the center of it. I want people to see the subtleties, not just the bright colors that are associated with my work. A lot of time is dedicated to making this about discovering extraordinary possibilities with light.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eisemanncenter.com/tickets/PublicArt.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710173523/http://www.eisemanncenter.com/tickets/PublicArt.html |archivedate=2011-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Courage Under Fire''''' is a 1996 American [[war film]] directed by [[Edward Zwick]], and starring [[Denzel Washington]] and [[Meg Ryan]]. It is the second collaboration between Washington and director Zwick. The film was released in the United States on July 12, 1996.

==Plot==

While serving in the [[Gulf War]], Lieutenant Colonel Serling ([[Denzel Washington]]) accidentally destroys one of his own tanks during a confusing night-time battle, killing his friend, Captain Boylar. The [[US Army]] covers up the details and transfers Serling to a desk job.

Later, Serling is assigned to determine if Captain Karen Emma Walden ([[Meg Ryan]]) should be the first woman to receive a ([[Posthumous recognition|posthumous]]) [[Medal of Honor]]. She was the commander of a [[Medevac]] [[UH-1 Iroquois|Huey]] that was sent to rescue the crew of a shot-down [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk|Black Hawk]]. When she encountered a [[T-54]], her crew destroyed it by dropping a fuel bladder onto the tank and igniting it with a [[flare gun]]. However, her own helicopter was shot down soon after. The two crews were unable to join forces, and when the survivors were rescued the next day, Walden was reported dead.

Serling notices inconsistencies between the testimonies of Walden's crew. Specialist Andrew Ilario ([[Matt Damon]]), the medic, praises Walden strongly. However, Staff Sergeant John Monfriez ([[Lou Diamond Phillips]]) claims that Walden was a coward and that he led the crew in combat and improvised the fuel bladder weapon. Sergeant Altameyer, who is dying in a hospital, complains about a fire. Warrant Officer One Rady, the co-pilot, was injured early on and unconscious throughout. Furthermore, the crew of the Black Hawk claim that they heard firing from an [[M16 rifle|M16]], but Ilario and Monfriez deny they had one.

Under pressure from the [[White House]] and his commander, Brigadier General Hershberg ([[Michael Moriarty]]), to wrap things up quickly, Serling leaks the story to a newspaper reporter, Tony Gartner ([[Scott Glenn]]), to prevent another [[cover-up]]. When Serling grills Monfriez during a car ride, Monfriez forces him to get out of the vehicle at gunpoint, then commits suicide by driving into an oncoming train.

Serling tracks Ilario down, and Ilario finally tells him the truth. Monfriez wanted to flee, which would mean abandoning Rady. When Walden refused, he pulled a gun on her. Walden then shot an enemy who appeared behind Monfriez, but Monfriez thought Walden was firing at him and shot her in the stomach, before backing off. The next morning, the enemy attacked again as a rescue party approached. Walden covered her men's retreat, firing an M16. However, Monfriez told the rescuers that Walden was dead, so they left without her. [[Napalm]] was then dropped on the entire area. Altameyer tried to expose Monfriez's lie at the time, but was too injured to speak, and Ilario was too scared of the court-martial Walden had threatened them with and remained silent.

Serling presents his final report to Hershberg. Walden's young daughter receives the Medal of Honor at a White House ceremony. Later, Serling tells the truth to the Boylars about the manner of their son's death and says he cannot ask for forgiveness. The Boylars tell Serling he must release his burden at some point and grant him their forgiveness.

In the last moments, Serling has a flashback of when he was standing by Boylar's destroyed tank and a medevac Huey was lifting off with his friend's body. Serling suddenly realises Walden was the Huey pilot.

==Production==

[[File:Centurion like M1A1 Abrams 2.jpg|thumb|250px|A Centurion tank modified to look like an M1A1 Abrams used in the film, located at the Russell Military Museum]]
The [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] withdrew its cooperation for the film so the tanks Serling commanded early in the film were British [[Centurion tank|Centurions]] shipped from [[Australia]] with sheet metal added to make them resemble [[M1A1 Abrams]]. These [[vismod|visually modified]] tanks were subsequently used to simulate the Abrams in several other motion pictures.

[[Reserve Officers' Training Corps|ROTC Cadets]] from [[Texas A&amp;M University]] were used as extras in the background in some of the training camp scenes.

The film draws reference to Walden and her crew assisting the crew of a downed [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk|Black Hawk]] helicopter. However, the scene shows the wrecked fuselage of a [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois|Huey]]. This is due to the Department of Defense withdrawing its cooperation. There were no privately owned Black Hawk fuselages available to acquire for the film. The parts of the script making reference to the Black Hawk had already been shot, so rather than change the whole film to adapt it to a Huey, the producers left it as Black Hawk and used a wrecked fuselage of a Huey for the desert shots in the hope not many viewers would notice the discrepancy.

The Iraqi battle scenes were filmed at the Indian Cliffs Ranch just outside [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], [[Texas]]. Many of the props were left there and became a tourist attraction. The [[White House]] Rose Garden set was destroyed twice: once by a tornado, and once by a sandstorm.

In order to lose 40 pounds (18 kilograms) for the later scenes, Matt Damon went on a strict regimen of food deprivation and [[physical training]]. On ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'', Damon said that the regimen consisted of six and a half miles of running in the morning and again at night, a diet of chicken breast, egg whites, and one plain baked potato per day, and a large amount of coffee and cigarettes. His health was affected to the extent that he had to have medical supervision for several months afterwards. His efforts, however, did not go unnoticed; director [[Francis Ford Coppola]] was so impressed by Damon's dedication to [[method acting]] that he offered him the leading role in ''[[The Rainmaker (1997 film)|The Rainmaker]]'' (1997). [[Steven Spielberg]] was also impressed by his performance, but thought he was too skinny and discounted him from casting considerations for ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'' until he met Damon during the filming of ''[[Good Will Hunting]]'', by which time he was back at his normal weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/saving-private-ryan-classic-feature/ |title=Classic Feature: The Making of Saving Private Ryan |magazine=Empire |date=October 1998 |issue=112 |last=Nathan |first=Ian |accessdate=10 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical response===
&lt;!-- Please note, when updating Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic ratings, you should also update the "accessdate" field within the citation tags to reflect the date on which you have updated them. --&gt;
The film received mostly positive reviews. As of January 14, 2013, the review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that 85% of critics gave the film a positive review based upon a sample of 53 reviews with an average rating of 7.3/10. The critical consensus states that the film is "an emotional and intriguing tale of a military officer who must review the merits of a fallen officer while confronting his own war demons. Effectively depicts the terrors of war as well as its heartbreaking aftermath."&lt;ref name="RTFresh"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/courage_under_fire/ |title=Courage Under Fire Movie Reviews |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=''IGN Entertainment'' |accessdate=2009-08-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327142327/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/courage_under_fire/ |archivedate=March 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the website [[Metacritic]], which uses a weighted average rating system, the film earned a generally favorable rating of 77/100 based on 19 mainstream critic reviews.&lt;ref name="MetaCritic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/video/titles/courageunderfire?q=courage%20under%20fire|title=Courage Under Fire Reviews|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=2009-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movie was commended by several critics. [[James Berardinelli]] of the website ReelViews wrote that the film was, "As profound and intelligent as it is moving, and that makes this memorable motion picture one of 1996's best."&lt;ref name="BerardinelliReview"&gt;{{cite news|last=Berardinelli|first=James|authorlink=James Berardinelli |title=Courage under Fire|url=http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/c/courage_under.html|work=[[ReelViews]]|date= July 1996 |accessdate=2008-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' spoke positively of the film saying that while the ending "…lays on the emotion a little heavily" the movie had been up until that point "…a fascinating emotional and logistical puzzle—almost a courtroom movie, with the desert as the courtroom."&lt;ref name="EbertReview"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ebert|first=Roger|authorlink=Roger Ebert|title=Courage Under Fire|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19960712/REVIEWS/607120301/1023|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=July 12, 1996|accessdate=2009-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Denzel Washington's acting was specifically lauded, as [[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' wrote, "In Washington's haunted eyes, in the stunning cinematography of Roger Deakins (''[[Fargo (film)|Fargo]]'') that plunges into the mad flare of combat, in the plot that deftly turns a whodunit into a meditation on character and in Zwick's persistent questioning of authority, ''Courage Under Fire'' honors its subject and its audience."&lt;ref name="TraversReview"&gt;{{cite news|last=Travers|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter Travers |title=Courage under Fire|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/5948783/courage_under_fire|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date= July 12, 1996 |accessdate=2008-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally Peter Stack of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' wrote that "Denzel Washington is riveting."&lt;ref name="StackReview"&gt;{{cite news|last=Stack|first=Peter |title=Fired-Up Over `Courage'|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1996/07/12/DD61444.DTL|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=July 12, 1996|accessdate=2009-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accolades===
Denzel Washington was nominated for Best Actor at the [[Chicago Film Critics Association Awards 1996|1996 Chicago Film Critics Association Awards]], but lost to [[Billy Bob Thornton]] in ''[[Sling Blade (film)|Sling Blade]]''.

==Criticism==
===Historical accuracy===
The [[Medal of Honor]] had previously been awarded to a woman, [[Mary Edwards Walker]], an [[American Civil War]] physician, but not for valor in combat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/06/11/archives/highest-medal-restored-to-war-heroine.html|title=Highest Medal Restored to War Heroine|date=1977-06-11|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-03|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Walker's award had been revoked in 1917 and was restored in 1977.

are a wide variety of [[Game of skill|games of skill]] generally played with a [[cue stick]], which is used to strike [[billiard ball]]s and thereby cause them to move around a [[Baize|cloth]]-covered [[billiards table]] bounded by elastic bumpers known as {{Cuegloss|Cushion|cushions}}.

Historically, the umbrella term was '''billiards'''. While that familiar name is still employed by some as a generic label for all such games, the word's usage has splintered into more exclusive competing meanings in various parts of the world. For example, in [[British English|British]] and [[Australian English]], "billiards" usually refers exclusively to the game of [[English billiards]], while in [[American English|American]] and [[Canadian English]] it is sometimes used to refer to a particular game or class of games, or to all cue games in general, depending upon [[List of dialects of the English language|dialect]] and context. In colloquial usage, the term "billiards" may be used colloquially to refer to [[pocket billiards]] games, such as [[pocket billiards|pool]], [[snooker]], or [[Russian pyramid]].

There are 3 major subdivisions of games within cue sports:

*[[Carom billiards]], referring to games played on tables without {{Cuegloss|Pocket|pockets}}, typically 10 feet in length, including [[balkline and straight rail]], [[cushion caroms]], [[carom billiards#Three-cushion billiards|three-cushion billiards]], [[artistic billiards]] and [[Four-ball billiards|four-ball]]
*[[Pool (cue sports)|Pool]], covering numerous pocket billiards games generally played on six-pocket tables of 7-, 8-, or 9-foot length, including among others [[eight-ball]] (the world's most widely played cue sport), [[nine-ball]] (the dominant professional game), [[ten-ball]], [[straight pool]] (the formerly dominant pro game), [[one-pocket]], and [[bank pool]]
*[[Snooker]], [[English billiards]] and [[Russian pyramid]], games played on a billiards table with six pockets called a [[snooker table]] (which has dimensions just under 12&amp;nbsp;ft by 6&amp;nbsp;ft), all of which are classified entirely separately from pool based on a separate historical development, as well as a separate culture and terminology that characterize their play.

There are other variants that make use of obstacles and targets, and table-top games played with disks instead of balls.

Billiards has a long and rich history stretching from its inception in the 15th century, to the wrapping of the body of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], in her billiard table cover in 1586, through its many mentions in the works of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]],&lt;!--Michael Phelan's 1850 book has an entire chapter devoted to mentions in Shakespeare works; which might be useful.--&gt; including the famous line "let's to billiards" in ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'' (1606–07), and through the many famous enthusiasts of the sport such as: [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Louis XIV of France]], [[Marie Antoinette]], [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Napoleon]], [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Mark Twain]], [[George Washington]], French president [[Jules Grévy]], [[Charles Dickens]], [[George Armstrong Custer]], [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[Lewis Carroll]], [[W.

All cue sports are generally regarded to have evolved into indoor games from outdoor stick-and-ball [[lawn game]]s (retroactively termed [[ground billiards]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Victor | last = Stein and Rubino, Paul | year = 1996 | title = The Billiard Encyclopedia: An Illustrated History of the Sport (2nd ed.) | publisher = Blue Book Publications, June 1996 | isbn = 1-886768-06-4  }}{{Page needed|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as such to be related to the historical games [[jeu de mail]] and [[palle-malle]], and modern [[trucco]], [[croquet]] and golf, and more distantly to the stickless [[bocce]] and [[bowls (sport)|bowls]].
The word "billiard" may have evolved from the French word ''billart'' or ''billette'', meaning "stick", in reference to the {{Cuegloss|Mace|mace}}, an implement similar to a [[Golf club (equipment)|golf club]], which was the forerunner to the modern [[Cue stick|cue]]; the term's origin may have also been from French ''bille'', meaning "ball".&lt;ref name="Everton 1986"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern term "cue sports" can be used to encompass the ancestral mace games, and even the modern cueless variants, such as finger billiards, for historical reasons. "Cue" itself came from ''queue'', the French word for a [[tail]]. This refers to the early practice of using the tail of the mace to strike the ball when it lay against a {{Cuegloss|Cushion|rail cushion}}.&lt;ref name="Everton 1986" /&gt;
[[File:Cabanès, Éducation de Princes031 Les trois fils du Grand Dauphin, jouant au Jeu des Fortifications.jpg|thumb|left|The sons of [[Louis, Grand Dauphin]] playing the ''royal game of fortifications'', early form of obstacle billiard.]]  
A recognizable form of billiards was played outdoors in the 1340s, and was reminiscent of croquet. King [[Louis XI of France]] (1461–1483) had the first known indoor billiard table.&lt;ref name="Everton 1986" /&gt; [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] further refined and popularized the game, and it swiftly spread among the French nobility.&lt;ref name="Everton 1986" /&gt; While the game had long been played on the ground, this version appears to have died out in the 17th century, in favor of croquet, golf and bowling games, while table billiards had grown in popularity as an indoor activity.&lt;ref name="Everton 1986" /&gt; [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], claimed that her "table de billiard" had been taken away by those who eventually became her executioners (and who covered her body with the table's cloth).&lt;ref name="Everton 1986" /&gt; Billiards grew to the extent that by 1727, it was being played in almost every Paris café.&lt;ref name="Everton 1986" /&gt; In England, the game was developing into a very popular activity for members of the gentry.&lt;ref name="Everton 1986" /&gt;

By 1670, the thin butt end of the mace began to be used not only for shots under the cushion (which itself was originally only there as a preventative method to stop balls from rolling off), but players increasingly preferred it for other shots as well. The cue as it is known today was finally developed by about 1800.&lt;ref name="Everton 1986" /&gt;

Initially, the mace was used to push the balls, rather than strike them. The newly developed striking cue provided a new challenge. Cushions began to be stuffed with substances to allow the balls to rebound, in order to enhance the appeal of the game. After a transitional period where only the better players would use cues, the cue came to be the first choice of equipment.&lt;ref name="Everton 1986" /&gt;

The demand for tables and other equipment was initially met in Europe by John Thurston and other furniture makers of the era. The early balls were made from wood and [[clay]], but the rich preferred to use [[ivory]].&lt;ref name="Everton 1986" /&gt;

Early billiard games involved various pieces of additional equipment, including the "arch" (related to the croquet hoop), "port" (a different hoop) and "king" (a pin or skittle near the arch) in the 1770s, but other game variants, relying on the cushions (and eventually on pockets cut into them), were being formed that would go on to play fundamental roles in the development of modern billiards.&lt;ref name="Everton 1986" /&gt;

[[Image:Studenten Billard.JPG|thumb|left|280px|Illustration of a three-ball [[pocket billiards]] game in early 19th century [[Tübingen]], Germany, using a table much longer than the modern type.]]
The early croquet-like games eventually led to the development of the '''[[carom billiards|carom or carambole billiards]]''' category – what most non-[[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] and non-US speakers mean by the word "billiards". These games, which once completely dominated the cue sports world but have declined markedly in many areas over the last few generations, are games played with three or sometimes four balls, on a table without holes (and without obstructions or targets in most cases), in which the goal is generally to strike one {{Cuegloss|Object ball|object ball}} with a {{Cuegloss|Cue ball|cue ball}}, then have the cue ball rebound off of one or more of the cushions and strike a second object ball. Variations include [[three-cushion]], [[Balkline and straight rail|straight rail and the balkline variants]], [[cushion caroms]], [[five-pins]], and [[Four-ball billiards|four-ball]], among others.

Over time, a type of obstacle returned, originally as a hazard and later as a target, in the form of [[Billiards table#Pocket billiards tables|pockets]], or holes partly cut into the table bed and partly into the cushions, leading to the rise of [[pocket billiards]], including "pool" games such as eight-ball, nine-ball, straight pool and [[one-pocket]]; [[Russian pyramid]]; [[snooker]]; [[English billiards]] and others.

In the United States pool and billiards had died out for a bit, but between 1878 and 1956 pool and billiards became very popular. Players in annual championships began to receive their own [[cigarette card]]s. This was mainly due to the fact that it was a popular pastime for troops to take their minds off from battle. However, by the end of World War II pool and billiards began to die down once again. It was not until 1961 when the film "The Hustler" came out that sparked a new interest in the game. Now the game is generally a well-known game and has many players of all different skill levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thebilliardshop.com/poolhistory.php |title=Pool History |publisher=The Pool Shop |access-date=1 December 2011 |dead-url=yes |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20111119012508/http://www.thebilliardshop.com/poolhistory.php |archive-date=November 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a sport==
The games with regulated international professional competition, if not others, have been referred to as "sports" or "sporting" events, not simply "games", since 1893 at the latest.&lt;ref name="NYTBig"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1893/12/10/archives/meeting-of-the-champions-the-big-billiard-tournament-to-begin.html "Meeting of the Champions; The Big Billiard Tournament to Begin To-morrow – What Ives, Schaefer, and Slosson Have Been Doing in Practice – The Older Players Not Afraid of the Big Runs Made by Ives – Something About the Rise and Progress of the Young 'Napoleon' of the Billiard World"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316051135/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40613FF3A5F1A738DDDA90994DA415B8385F0D3 |date=2014-03-16 }}, no byline, ''[[The New York Times]]'', 1893-12-10, p. 10; [[The New York Times Company]], [[New York City|New York, NY]], USA.&lt;/ref&gt; Quite a variety of particular games (i.e., sets of rules and equipment) are the subject of present-day competition, including many of those already mentioned, with competition being especially broad in nine-ball, snooker, three-cushion and eight-ball.

Snooker, though technically a pocket billiards variant and closely related in its equipment and origin to the game of English billiards, is a professional sport organized at the international level, and its rules bear little resemblance to those of modern pool, pyramid and other such games.&lt;!-- There are other places where we need to "respect" snooker as a separate sport; it's really a global tour-de-force and had a WikiProject before "WikiProject Cue sports", so let's see how we can help them and not step on their toes but also remain historically/logically accurate. -SMcCandlish--&gt;

A "Billiards" category encompassing pool, snooker and carom was featured in the 2005 [[World Games]], held in [[Duisburg]], Germany, and the 2006 [[Asian Games]] also saw the [[Cue sports at the 2006 Asian Games|introduction of a "Cue sports" category]].

Billiard balls vary from game to game, in size, design and quantity.

[[Russian pyramid]] and [[Kaisa (billiards)|kaisa]] have a size of 68&amp;nbsp;mm ({{frac|2|11|16}}&amp;nbsp;in).  In Russian pyramid there are sixteen balls, as in pool, but fifteen are white and numbered, and the {{cuegloss|cue ball|cue ball}} is usually red.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.billiardsvillage.com/russian-pyramid.html |title=Russian Billiards |publisher=BilliardsVillage.com |access-date=August 14, 2008 |year=2007 |author=editors |dead-url=yes |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080613002125/http://www.billiardsvillage.com/russian-pyramid.html |archive-date=June 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In kaisa, five balls are used: the yellow {{Cuegloss|object ball|object ball}} (called the ''kaisa'' in Finnish), two red object balls, and the two white cue balls (usually differentiated by one cue ball having a dot or other marking on it and each of which serves as an object ball for the opponent).

Carom billiards balls are larger than pool balls, having a diameter of 61.5&amp;nbsp;mm ({{frac|2|7|16}}&amp;nbsp;in), and come as a set of two cue balls (one colored or marked) and an object ball (or two object balls in the case of the game [[Four-ball billiards|four-ball]]).

American-style pool balls are 57&amp;nbsp;mm ({{frac|2|1|4}}&amp;nbsp;in), are used in many pool games found throughout the world, come in sets of two {{Cuegloss|Suit|suits}} of object balls, seven {{Cuegloss|Solids|solids}} and seven {{Cuegloss|Stripes|stripes}}, an {{Cuegloss|8 ball|8 ball}} and a {{Cuegloss|Cue ball|cue ball}}; the balls are racked differently for different games (some of which do not use the entire ball set). Blackball (English-style eight-ball) sets are similar, but have unmarked {{Cuegloss|Group|groups}} of {{Cuegloss|Red ball|red}} (or {{Cuegloss|Blue ball|blue}}) and {{Cuegloss|Yellow ball|yellow}} balls instead of solids and stripes, and at 56&amp;nbsp;mm ({{frac|2|3|16}}&amp;nbsp;in) are smaller than the American-style; they are used principally in Britain, Ireland, and some [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, though not exclusively, since they are unsuited for playing nine-ball.

Snooker balls are smaller than American-style pool balls with a diameter of 52.5&amp;nbsp;mm ({{frac|2|1|15}}&amp;nbsp;in), and come in sets of 22 (15 reds, 6 "{{Cuegloss|Colour balls|colours}}", and a cue ball). English billiard balls are the same size as snooker balls and come in sets of three balls (two cue balls and a red, an object ball). Other games, such as [[bumper pool]], have custom ball sets.

Billiard balls have been made from many different materials since the start of the game, including clay, [[bakelite]], [[celluloid]], [[crystallite]], [[ivory]], plastic, steel and wood. The dominant material from 1627 until the early 20th century was ivory. The search for a substitute for ivory use was not for environmental concerns but based on economic motivation and fear of danger for elephant hunters. It was in part spurred on by a New York billiard table manufacturer who announced a prize of $10,000 for a substitute material. The first viable substitute was [[celluloid]], invented by [[John Wesley Hyatt]] in 1868, but the material was volatile, sometimes exploding during manufacture and was highly flammable.&lt;ref name="IEOB"&gt;{{cite book | last = Shamos | first = Michael Ian | year = 1993 | title = The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Billiards | publisher = Lyons &amp; Burford | location = [[New York City|New York, NY]] | isbn = 1-55821-219-1 | nopp = true}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The New York Times Company (September 16, 1875).

===Tables===
{{main|Billiard table}}
[[Image:PoolTablewithEquipment-non.jpg|left|thumb|265px|Pool table with equipment.]]
There are many sizes and styles of pool and [[billiards table|billiard table]]s. Generally, tables are [[rectangle]]s twice as long as they are wide. Most pool tables are known as 7-, 8-, or 9-footers, referring to the length of the table's long side.  Full-size snooker and English billiard tables are {{convert|12|ft|m|1}} long on the longest side. [[Pool hall]]s tend to have {{convert|9|ft|m|1|sing=on}} tables and cater to the serious pool player. [[Public house|Pubs]] will typically use {{convert|7|ft|m|1|sing=on}} tables which are often coin-operated. Formerly, {{convert|10|ft|m|0|sing=on}} tables were common, but such tables are now considered antique collectors items; a few, usually from the late 19th century, can be found in pool halls from time to time. Ten-foot tables remain the standard size for carom billiard games. The slates on modern carom tables are usually heated to stave off moisture and provide a consistent playing surface.

The length of the pool table will typically be a function of space, with many homeowners purchasing an {{convert|8|ft|m|1|sing=on}} table as a compromise. Full-size pool tables are 4.5 by {{convert|9|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} (interior dimensions). High-quality tables have a {{cuegloss|bed}} made of thick slate, in three pieces to prevent warping and changes due to temperature and humidity. Smaller bar tables are most commonly made with a single piece of slate. Pocket billiards tables of all types normally have six pockets, three on each side (four corner pockets, and two side or middle pockets).{{clear}}

===Cloth===
{{Main|Baize}}
[[Image:Early-1880s-billiards-ladies-JMBB.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Women playing on an elaborately decorated green-covered table in an early 1880s advertising poster.]]
All types of tables are covered with billiard cloth (often called "felt", but actually a woven wool or wool/nylon blend called [[baize]]). Cloth has been used to cover billiards tables since the 15th century.

Bar or tavern tables, which get a lot of play, use "slower", more durable cloth. The cloth used in upscale [[pool halls|pool (and snooker) halls]] and home [[billiard room]]s is "faster" (i.e., provides less friction, allowing the balls to roll farther across the table {{Cuegloss|Bed|bed}}), and competition-quality pool cloth is made from 100% [[worsted|worsted wool]]. Snooker cloth traditionally has a nap (consistent fiber directionality) and balls behave differently when rolling against versus along with the nap.

The cloth of the billiard table has traditionally been green, reflecting its origin (originally the grass of ancestral lawn games), and has been so colored since the 16th century, but it is also produced in other colors such as red and blue.&lt;ref name="Shamos 1991"&gt;{{cite book | last = Shamos | first = Michael Ian | year = 1991 | title = Pool | publisher = Hotho &amp; Co., June 1991 | isbn = 99938-704-3-9 }}{{Page needed|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cloth was earlier said to be the most important part of the game, most likely because of the reflection of the game's origin. The players were determined that the cloth should not be ripped – women were made to continue to use maces after cues were invented, for fear that they would rip the cloth with the sharper cues.

===Rack===
{{main|Rack (billiards)}}
[[Image:Billiard Rack.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Aluminium billiard rack that is used for 8-ball, 9-ball, and straight pool.]]

A [[Rack (billiards)|rack]] is the name given to a frame (usually wood, plastic or aluminium) used to organize billiard balls at the beginning of a game. This is traditionally triangular in shape, but varies with the type of billiards played. There are two main types of racks; the more common triangular shape which is used for eight-ball and straight pool and the diamond-shaped rack used for nine-ball.

There are several other types of less common rack types that are also used, based on a "template" to hold the billiard balls tightly together.  Most commonly it is a thin plastic sheet with diamond-shaped cut-outs that hold the balls that is placed on the table with the balls set on top of the rack.  The rack is used to set up the "break" and removed before the "break shot" occurs.

===Cues===
{{main|Cue stick}}
Billiards games are mostly played with a stick known as a cue. A cue is usually either a one piece tapered stick or a two piece stick divided in the middle by a joint of metal or phenolic resin. High quality cues are generally two pieces and are made of a hardwood, generally maple for billiards and ash for snooker.

The {{Cuegloss|Butt|butt}} end of the cue is of larger circumference and is intended to be gripped by a player's hand. The {{Cuegloss|Shaft|shaft}} of the cue is of smaller circumference, usually tapering to an {{convert|0.4|to|0.55|in|mm}} terminus called a {{Cuegloss|Ferrule|ferrule}} (usually made of fiberglass or brass in better cues), where a rounded leather {{Cuegloss|Tip|tip}} is affixed, flush with the ferrule, to make final contact with balls. The tip, in conjunction with chalk, can be used to impart [[Cue sports techniques#Sidespin (english)|spin]] to the cue ball when it is not hit in its center.

Cheap cues are generally made of pine, low-grade maple (and formerly often of [[Gonystylus|ramin]], which is now endangered), or other low-quality wood, with inferior plastic ferrules. A quality cue can be expensive and may be made of exotic woods and other expensive materials which are artfully inlaid in decorative patterns. Many modern cues are also made, like [[Golf club (equipment)|golf club]]s, with high-tech materials such as woven graphite. Skilled players may use more than one cue during a game, including a separate generally lighter cue for the opening break shot (because of cue speed gained from a lighter stick) and another, shorter cue with a special tip for {{Cuegloss|Jump shot|jump shots}}.

===Mechanical bridge===
&lt;span id="The mechanical bridge" &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!--Orig. section name; may be linked-to somewhere.--&gt;The mechanical bridge, sometimes called a "rake", "crutch", "bridge stick" or simply "bridge", and in the UK a "rest", is used to extend a player's reach on a shot where the cue ball is too far away for normal hand bridging. It consists of a stick with a grooved metal or plastic head which the cue slides on. Many amateurs refuse to use the mechanical bridge based on the perception that to do so is unmanly.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} However, many aficionados and most professionals employ the bridge whenever the intended shot so requires.

Some players, especially current or former snooker players, use a screw-on cue butt extension instead of or in addition to the mechanical bridge.

Bridge head design is varied, and not all designs (especially those with cue shaft-enclosing rings, or wheels on the bottom of the head), are broadly tournament-approved.

In Italy a longer, thicker cue is typically available for this kind of tricky shot.

For snooker they are normally available in three forms, their use depending on how the player is hampered; the standard rest is a simple cross, the 'spider' has a raised arch around 12&amp;nbsp;cm with three grooves to rest the cue in and for the most awkward of shots, the 'giraffe' (or 'swan' in England) which has a raised arch much like the 'spider' but with a slender arm reaching out around 15&amp;nbsp;cm with the groove.

===Chalk===
[[Image:Billiard Chalk and Cue.jpg|thumb|240px|Billiard chalk is applied to the tip of the cue.]]Chalk is applied to the tip of the cue stick, ideally before every shot, to increase the tip's friction coefficient so that when it impacts the cue ball on a non-center hit, no {{Cuegloss|Miscue|miscue}} (unintentional slippage between the cue tip and the struck ball) occurs. Cue tip chalk is not actually the substance typically referred to as "[[chalk]]" (generally [[calcium carbonate]]), but any of several proprietary compounds, with a [[silicate]] base. It was around the time of the Industrial Revolution that newer compounds formed that provided better grip for the ball. This is when the English began to experiment with side spin or applying curl to the ball. This was shortly introduced to the American players and is how the term "putting English on the ball" came to be. "Chalk" may also refer to a cone of fine, white {{Cuegloss|Hand chalk|hand chalk}}; like [[talc]] (talcum powder) it can be used to reduce friction between the cue and bridge hand during shooting, for a smoother stroke. Some brands of hand chalk actually are made of compressed talc. (Tip chalk is not used for this purpose because it is abrasive, hand-staining and difficult to apply.) Many players prefer a slick pool glove over hand chalk or talc because of the messiness of these powders; buildup of particles on the cloth will affect ball behavior and necessitate more-frequent cloth cleaning.

==Major games==
There are two main varieties of billiard games: '''carom''' and '''pocket'''.

The main carom billiards games are [[straight rail]], [[balkline and straight rail|balkline]] and especially [[three cushion]] billiards. All are played on a pocketless table with three balls; two cue balls and one object ball. In all, players shoot a cue ball so that it makes contact with the opponent's cue ball as well as the object ball.  Others of multinational interest are [[Four-ball billiards|four-ball]] and [[five-pins]].

The most globally popular of the large variety of pocket games are [[pool (cue sports)|Pool]] and [[snooker]]. A third, [[English billiards]], has some features of carom billiards. English billiards used to be one of the two most-competitive cue sports along with the carom game balkline, at the turn of the 20th century and is still enjoyed today in [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries. Another pocket game, [[Russian pyramid]] and its variants like [[kaisa (billiards)|kaisa]] are popular in the former [[Eastern bloc]].

===Games played on a carom billiards table===
{{Main|Carom billiards}}

====Straight rail or straight billiards====
{{Main|Balkline and straight rail}}
In straight rail, a player scores a point and may continue shooting each time his cue ball makes contact with both other balls.

Although a difficult and subtle game, some of the best players of straight billiards developed the skill to {{Cuegloss|Gather shot|gather}} the balls in a corner or along the same rail for the purpose of playing a series of {{Cuegloss|Nurse|nurse shots}} to score a seemingly limitless number of points.

The first straight rail professional tournament was held in 1879 where [[Jacob Schaefer, Sr.]] scored 690 points in a single turn&lt;ref name="Shamos 1991"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2011}} (that is, 690 separate strokes without a miss). With the balls repetitively hit and barely moving in endless "nursing", there was little for the fans to watch&lt;!--, though the matches were popular anyway and the subject of major press coverage **Dig up some good NYTimes 1800s articles and cite them here first.** --&gt;.

====Balkline====
{{Main|Balkline and straight rail}}
In light of these phenomenal skill developments in straight rail, the game of balkline soon developed to make it impossible for a player to keep the balls gathered in one part of the table for long, greatly limiting the effectiveness of nurse shots. A {{Cuegloss|Balkline|balkline}} (not to be confused with {{Cuegloss|Baulk line|baulk line}}, which pertains to the game of [[English billiards]]) is a line parallel to one end of a billiards table. In the ''games'' of balkline – 18.1 and 18.2 (pronounced "eighteen-point-two") balkline, among other more obscure variations – the players have to drive at least one object ball past a balkline set at {{convert|18|in|mm}} from each rail, after one or two points have been scored, respectively.

====Three-cushion billiards====
{{main|Three-cushion billiards}}
A more elegant solution was three-cushion billiards, which requires a player to make contact with the other two balls on the table ''and'' contact three rail cushions in the process. This is difficult enough that even the best players can only manage to average one to two points per turn.
This is sometimes described as "hardest to learn" and "require most skill" of all billiards. Even quite good Pool or Snooker players may attempt an hour or more to score a single three cushion point, without even managing an accidental score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.quora.com/Which-requires-more-skill-Snooker-or-Pool-and-why|title=Which requires more skill, Snooker or Pool, and why? - Quora|author=|date=|website=www.quora.com|accessdate=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Games played on a pool table===
{{Main|Pool (cue sports)}}

There are many variations of games played on a standard pool table. Popular pool games include [[eight-ball]], [[nine-ball]], [[straight pool]] and [[one-pocket]]. Even within games types (e.g. [[eight-ball]]), there may be variations, and people may play recreationally using relaxed or local rules.  A few of the more popular examples of pool games are given below.

In eight-ball and nine-ball, the object is to sink object balls until one can legally pocket the winning [[:wikt:eponym|eponym]]ous "{{Cuegloss|Money ball|money ball}}". Well-known but waning in popularity is straight pool, in which players seek to continue sinking balls, rack after rack if they can, to reach a pre-determined winning score (typically 150). Related to nine-ball, another well-known game is [[Rotation (pool)|rotation]], where the lowest-numbered object ball on the table must be struck first, although any object ball may be pocketed (i.e., combination shot). Each pocketed ball is worth its number, and the player with the highest score at the end of the rack is the winner. Since there are only 120 points available (1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;⋯&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;15&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;120), scoring 61 points leaves no opportunity for the opponent to catch up. In both one-pocket and bank pool, the players must sink a set number of balls; respectively, all in a particular {{Cuegloss|Pocket|pocket}}, or all by {{Cuegloss|Bank shot|bank shots}}. In snooker, players score points by alternately potting {{Cuegloss|Red ball|red balls}} and various special "{{Cuegloss|Colour ball|colour balls}}".

====Two-player or -team games====
*[[Eight-ball]]: The goal is to {{cuegloss|pocket}} ({{cuegloss|pot}}) all of one's designated {{cuegloss|group}} of balls (either {{cuegloss|stripes}} vs. {{cuegloss|solids}}, or {{cuegloss|red ball|reds}} vs. {{cuegloss|yellow ball|yellows}}, depending upon the equipment), and then pocket the {{cuegloss|8 ball}} in a {{cuegloss|call shot|called}} pocket.
*[[Nine-ball]]: The goal is to pocket the 9 ball; the initial contact of the {{cuegloss|cue ball}} each turn must be with the lowest-numbered {{cuegloss|object ball}} remaining on the table; there are numerous variants such as [[seven-ball]], [[six-ball]], and the older forms of three-ball and ten-ball, that simply use a different number of balls and have a different {{cuegloss|money ball}}.
*[[Straight pool]] (a.k.a. 14.1 continuous pool): The goal is to reach a predetermined number of {{cuegloss|point|points}} (e.g. 100); a point is earned by pocketing any called ball into a designated pocket; game play is by {{cuegloss|rack|racks}} of 15 balls, and the last object ball of a rack is not pocketed, but left on the table with the opponent re-racking the remaining 14 before game play continues.
*[[Bank pool]]: The goal is to reach a predetermined number of points; a point is earned by pocketing any called ball by {{cuegloss|bank shot|banking}} it into a designated pocket using one or more {{cuegloss|cushion}}.

====Speed pool====
[[Speed pool]] is a standard billiards game where the balls must be pocketed in as little time as possible. Rules vary greatly from tournament to tournament. The [[International Speed Pool Challenge]] has been held annually since 2006.

===Games played on a snooker table ===

====English billiards====
{{Main|English billiards}}
Dating to approximately 1800, English billiards, called simply billiards&lt;ref name="Everton 1986 other"&gt;{{cite book|last = Everton|first = Clive|authorlink = Clive Everton|title = The History of Snooker and Billiards|year=1986|location=[[Haywards Heath|Haywards Heath, UK]]|publisher=[[Transworld (company)|Partridge Pr]]|isbn=1-85225-013-5|edition=rev. ver. of ''The Story of Billiards and Snooker'', 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; in many [[Commonwealth of Nations|former British colonies]] and in the UK where it originated, was originally called the ''winning and losing carambole game'', folding in the names of three predecessor games, ''the winning game'', ''the losing game'' and ''the carambole game'' (an early form of [[straight rail]]), that combined to form it.&lt;ref name="Shamos 1999"&gt;{{Shamos 1999|46, 61–62, 89, 244}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game features both {{Cuegloss|cannon|cannons}} (caroms) and the pocketing of balls as objects of play. English billiards requires two {{Cuegloss|Cue ball|cue balls}} and a red {{Cuegloss|Object ball|object ball}}. The object of the game is to score either a fixed number of points, or score the most points within a set time frame, determined at the start of the game.

Points are awarded for:
*Two-ball cannons: striking both the object ball and the other (opponent's) cue ball on the same shot (2 points). 
*&lt;!--{{Cuegloss|Winning hazard|--&gt;Winning hazards&lt;!--}}--&gt;: {{Cuegloss|Pot|potting}} the red ball (3 points); potting the other cue ball (2 points).
*{{Cuegloss|Losing hazard|Losing hazards}} (or "in-offs"): potting one's cue ball by cannoning off another ball (3 points if the red ball was hit first; 2 points if the other cue ball was hit first, or if the red and other cue ball were "{{Cuegloss|Split|split}}", i.e., hit simultaneously).

====Snooker====
{{main|Snooker}}

Snooker is a pocket billiards game originated by [[History of the British Army|British officers]] stationed in [[Colonial India|India]] during the 19th century, based on earlier pool games such as black pool and life pool. The name of the game became generalized to also describe one of its prime strategies: to "{{Cuegloss|Snooker|snooker}}" the opposing player by causing that player to foul or leave an opening to be exploited.

In the United Kingdom, snooker is by far the most popular cue sport at the competitive level, and major national pastime along with association football and [[cricket]]. It is played in many [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries as well, especially in Asia. Snooker is uncommon in North America, where pool games such as eight-ball and nine-ball dominate, and Latin America and [[Continental Europe]], where carom games dominate. The first [[World Snooker Championship]] was held in 1927, and it has been held annually since then with few exceptions. The [[World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association]] (WPBSA) was established in 1968 to regulate the professional game, while the [[International Billiards and Snooker Federation]] (IBSF) regulates the amateur games.

'''Czechoslovak Television (ČST)''' was founded on 1 May 1953 in [[Czechoslovakia]]. It was known by three names over its lifetime: {{lang-cs|Československá televize}}, {{lang-sk|Československá televízia (until 1990), Česko-slovenská televízia (from 1990 until 1992).}}

== History ==
[[File:Československá televize, 1971 (03).jpg|thumb|Color television broadcasting studio]]
[[File:Česká televize.jpg|thumb|Česká televize building in [[Prague]]]]
ČST started life as a single programme, airing for a short amount of time each day. The first public broadcasting was a short performance by [[František Filipovský]] on 1 May 1953. In 1955 was held the first live broadcast (a hockey match). 

Like all other media in the Communist Czechoslovakia, the station was subject to heavy censorship. However, as part of the process of social liberation in 1968, for a few days ČST aired broadcasts about the [[Prague Spring]]. However, in 1969, it became part of the normalisation efforts on the national media.

===Launch of second channel===
On May 10, 1970, Czechoslovak Television began broadcasting a second channel, ČST TV2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/vse-o-ct/historie/ceskoslovenska-televize/prehistorie/ |title= Ceska Televize Prehistorie |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher= Česka Televize |accessdate= 21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Move to colour===
Further technical improvements were made on May 9, 1973, when the first regular broadcasts in colour started on TV2, followed two years later by colour transmission on the first channel as well.

At the end of the decade, in 1979, a building and a studio based in [[Prague]]'s Kavčí hory was opened, which became the home of ČST's news department.

===Division of ČST TV2===
After November 1989, lineup changes were made, with the first program being renamed F1 for the federal district, and the second program being split into the Czech ČTV and the Slovak S1, the first such division of channels by ČST. A third channel for Czech audiences, previously used by Soviet broadcasting was launched on 14 May 1990, called OK3 (Czech: Otevřený kanál tři, English: Open Channel three). A similar channel for Slovak audiences called TA 3 was created on 6 June 1991 (broadcasting from August 1991 until July 1992).

===Velvet Revolution===
During the Velvet Revolution, ČST staff very quickly joined the side of the protesters and allowed them to spread important messages and broadcasts of the demonstrations.

== Velvet divorce ends Czechoslovak Television ==

ČST disappeared along with [[Czechoslovakia]] on the 31st December 1992. Its successor in the Czech Republic is [[Česká televize|Czech television]], and in Slovakia [[Slovenská televízia]].

Around its dissolution into the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]] in the end of 1992, ČST was abolished, and the new companies, public service broadcasters, emerged:

* Czech Television, [[Česká televize]] (ČT)
* Slovak Television, [[Radio and Television Slovakia|Slovenská televízia]] (STV).

==Plot==
17 year old Mary Katherine, or M.K., moves in with her eccentric [[scientist]] father Professor Bomba, who has been searching for tiny humanoid soldiers called Leafmen. They protect the forest that Bomba lives near from wicked creatures called Boggans and their malevolent leader Mandrake. An independent young soldier named Nod decides to quit, much to the ire of the no-nonsense Leafmen leader Ronin.

The queen of the forest, Queen Tara, must choose an heir to her throne and goes out to a field of leaf pods, guarded by a laid-back [[slug]] named Mub and a wannabe Leafman [[snail]] named Grub. Immediately after she chooses a pod, the Boggans attack. Tara flees the area with the pod, and though her bodyguards do their best to protect her, they are soon overwhelmed by the sheer number of Boggans. Eventually, Ronin arrives for her and the pair fly off on his [[hummingbird]] mount. They are then attacked by Mandrake and his son Dagda. Dagda is killed by Ronin, but the former shoots Tara beforehand.

Meanwhile, M.K. decides to leave after having an argument with Bomba about his research. Before she can leave, Bomba's dog Ozzy runs into the woods. While looking for Ozzy, M.K. sees Tara falling. Dying, Tara gives her the pod and uses her magic to shrink her. She tells M.K. to take the pod to a [[Glowworm]] named Nim Galuu before she dies, and M.K. joins Ronin and the Leafmen, along with Mub and Grub. Ronin discovers that Nod has entered a race against other creatures and bugs on birds. Nod goes back on a deal with a tough [[American toad|toad]] named Bufo to [[Match fixing|throw the race]]. Before Bufo and his two henchmen can feed Nod to a snake, Ronin intervenes and orders them to leave. A reluctant Nod joins him, M.K., Mub, and Grub after hearing about Queen Tara's death, which Bufo overhears.

Ronin, Nod, M.K., Mub, and Grub eventually track Nim Galuu down. He then leads them down to the scroll library, where M.K. discovers Tara's brief message before shrinking her, and a message that will get her back to normal size. When Ronin leaves, Nod takes M.K. on a [[deer]] ride and they begin to fall in love. Meanwhile, Mandrake has had the Boggans bring Bufo to him, finding out the location of the pod. Mandrake goes to Nim Galuu's place to steal the pod, which, if it blooms in darkness, will help Mandrake destroy the forest. He takes the pod and kidnaps Mub and Grub. Ronin scolds Nod for not being there to protect the pod. To get into Boggan territory undiscovered, M.K., Nod, and Ronin set out to Bomba's house to get some disguises, where M.K. learns that the Leafmen have deliberately been leading Bomba off their trail. Bomba sees that he has visitors and captures M.K., fainting when he sees her. M.K. marks the location of Moonhaven on a map Bomba has made of the forest before rejoining Nod and Ronin.

When they reach the Boggan land Ronin distracts the Boggans while M.K. and Nod rescue Mub, Grub, and the pod. Mandrake discovers them and orders the Boggans to stop them. M.K., Nod, Mub, and Grub escape alive, but Ronin sacrifices himself to ensure their escape. Before the [[full moon]] can sprout the pod at Moonhaven, Mandrake's [[bat]]s block the light, causing the pod to begin sprouting in darkness. The Leafmen set out to fight the Boggans; M.K. tries to get help from her father by visiting his various cameras he had set in the forest. However, upon regaining consciousness, Bomba believes that he didn't really see M.K. and that he has been insane all these years, and shuts down all his cameras. He changes his mind when he sees the red push-pin that M.K. had put on his map.

Bomba is overjoyed to see that he has been right and he follows M.K. to Moonhaven. M.K. uses Bomba's [[iPod]] to make bat sounds, luring Mandrake's bats away. Meanwhile, Mub and Nim Galuu try to stop Mandrake from reaching the pod, but are unsuccessful. Just then, Ronin appears, bearing scars and bruises from the Boggans. Mandrake manages to outdo him, but is defended by Nod, who finally realizes the importance of teamwork. Before Mandrake can obtain his victory, the pod blooms in moonlight, defeating the Boggans, and sealing Mandrake into the burl of a nearby tree.

The chosen heir is the flower child who helped save Tara earlier in the film. Grub becomes a Leafman, Nod and Ronin reconcile, and Nod and M.K. kiss before M.K. is returned to her original size. After reuniting with Bomba and becoming his assistant, the human family still keeps regular contact with their small friends as they continue the research of their world.

==Production==
In 2006, it was reported that Chris Wedge would be directing an animated feature film based on [[William Joyce (writer)|William Joyce]]'s book, ''The Leaf Men and the Brave Good Bugs'' for Fox Animation. Joyce, who had already collaborated with Wedge as a designer and producer on the 2005 film ''[[Robots (2005 film)|Robots]]'', was set to produce the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ball |first=Ryan |title=Fox Falls for Joyce's Leaf Men |url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/features/fox-falls-for-joyces-leaf-men |accessdate=June 4, 2012 |newspaper=Animation Magazine |date=August 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one point, Wedge got permission to find a new home for the film and turned to [[Pixar]], led by [[John Lasseter]], a close friend that Wedge knew from working on ''[[Tron]]''. When Pixar tried to close the rights for the film and start development, Fox changed their mind, and the film returned to Fox. The film was officially greenlit in 2009, under the title ''Leaf Men''.&lt;ref name="Variety1" /&gt; In May 2012, Fox announced the final title for the film (''Epic''), its first cast details, and a plot.&lt;ref name="Deadline1" /&gt; According to Wedge, he was not satisfied with the renaming, which was decided by the marketing department. He also expressed dissatisfaction with subtitles given to the film in some non-English countries, including the French subtitle, ''The Battle of the Secret Kingdom''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=(INTERVIEW) A PROPOS D’EPIC AVEC CHRIS WEDGE|url=http://www.focusonanimation.com/interview-propos-depic-chris-wedge-18393/|accessdate=October 8, 2013|publisher=Focus on Animation|date=October 8, 2013|author=Nbu|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the film is based on and borrows many characters from Joyce's book, its plot has been significantly changed. Wedge explained: "[W]hile Bill wrote a wonderful book, it is a quaint story. We wanted to make a gigantic action-adventure movie." To address online speculations about whether the film is similar to other films, like ''[[FernGully: The Last Rainforest]]'' or ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'', Wedge said: "I hate to associate it with other movies. It is adventure on the scale of ''[[Star Wars]]''. And it does immerse the audience completely in a world like ''Avatar''. But it has its own personality."&lt;ref name="USATodaySneak" /&gt;

==Release==
The film was released publicly on May 16, 2013, in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Germany, Peru, Puerto Rico, and Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=EpicINTL Release Dates in Facebook |url=https://www.facebook.com/EpicTheMovie/app_151503908244383 |title=Epic - INTL Release Dates |publisher=Facebook |date=|accessdate=May 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was released in the United States on May 24, 2013.&lt;ref name="USATodaySneak" /&gt;

===Box office===
Produced on a budget of $93 million,&lt;ref name="VarietyWeekend" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DeadlineWeekend" /&gt; ''Epic'' grossed $107,518,682 in North America, and $160,907,952 in other countries, for a worldwide total of $268,426,634.&lt;ref name="mojo" /&gt; In North America, the film earned $9.3 million on its opening day,&lt;ref name=DeadlineWeekend /&gt; and opened to number four in its first weekend, with $33,531,068, behind ''[[Fast &amp; Furious 6]]'', ''[[The Hangover Part III]]'', and ''[[Star Trek Into Darkness]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=2013&amp;wknd=21&amp;p=.htm |title=Weekend Box Office Results for May 24-26, 2013 |publisher=IMDB | work = [[Box Office Mojo]] |date=|accessdate=May 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its second weekend, the film dropped to number five, grossing an additional $16,616,310.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=2013&amp;wknd=22&amp;p=.htm |title=Weekend Box Office Results for May 31-June 2, 2013 |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date=June 2, 2013 |accessdate=January 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its third weekend, the film stayed at number five, grossing $11,876,003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=2013&amp;wknd=23&amp;p=.htm |title=Weekend Box Office Results for June 7-9, 2013 |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date= |accessdate=January 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its fourth weekend, the film dropped to number seven, grossing $6,284,905.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=2013&amp;wknd=24&amp;p=.htm |title=Weekend Box Office Results for June 14-16, 2013 |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date= |accessdate=January 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the film was overshadowed by other animated films that summer including ''[[Monsters University]]'' and ''[[Despicable Me 2]]'', the film finished in third out of six family films that summer, and became a moderate box office success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/showdowns/chart/?id=animationsummer13.htm |title=Summer 2013 Family Movies |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date= |accessdate=September 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===
''Epic'' received mixed reviews from critics. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a score of 64% based on 119 reviews, with an average rating of 5.9/10. The site's critical consensus reads: "Though its narrative themes are all too familiar, ''Epic'' is beautifully animated and crafted with just enough flair to make for solid family entertainment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/epic_2013/ |title=Epic |publisher=[[Flixster]] | work=Rotten Tomatoes |date=August 20, 2012 |accessdate=May 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another review aggregation website, [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[Normalization (statistics)|normalized]] rating out of 100 top reviews from mainstream critics, calculated a score of 52 out of 100 based on 30 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/epic-2013 |title=Epic Reviews |publisher=CBS Interactive | work = Metacritic |date=|accessdate=May 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by the market research firm [[CinemaScore]] gave ''Epic'' an "A" grade on average and an "A+" among kids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/box-office-report-fast-6-558677|title=Box Office Report: 'Fast 6' Earns $122 Million-Plus, Runs 'Hangover III' Off Course|work=The Hollywood Reporter|last=McClintock |first=Pamela|date=May 27, 2013|accessdate=May 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephan Lee of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film a B+, saying "The story lacks the specialness of a [[Pixar]] movie—it retreads the same eco-battle archetypes as ''[[FernGully: The Last Rainforest|FernGully]]'' and ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]—''but it's a perfectly appealing explosion of color for a lazy summer day."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee |first=Stephan |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20687762,00.html |title=Epic Movie Review Review |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=May 22, 2013 |accessdate=May 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Rechtshaffen of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' gave the film a mixed review, saying "Where the animated film comes up short is on the inspiration front—despite the intriguing terrain, its stock inhabitants lack the sort of unique personality traits that would prevent them from feeling overly familiar."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rechtshaffen |first=Michael |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movie/epic/review/525671 |title=Epic Review |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=May 17, 2013 |accessdate=May 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Phillips of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' gave the film two stars, saying "It's difficult to keep its story and characters, or even its visual design, in your mind's eye, in part because the five credited screenwriters overload the narrative with incident and threatening complication."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Phillips |first=Michael |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-epic-movie-review-20130523,0,1430441.column |title='Epic' can't see the forest for the plot |work=Chicago Tribune |date=May 23, 2013 |accessdate=May 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kyle Smith of the ''[[New York Post]]'' gave the film one-and-a-half stars out of four, saying "It’s not that the plot of ''Epic'' is complex; it’s just untidy. There’s a lot going on that goes nowhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith |first=Kyle |url=https://nypost.com/2013/05/23/do-not-go-out-on-a-limb-for-epic/ |title=Do not go out on a limb for ‘Epic’ |work=New York Post |date=May 23, 2013 |accessdate=May 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moira Macdonald of ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, saying "The story's simple enough to appeal to young kids (the 8-year-old with me pronounced the movie "awesome"), but adults will enjoy the beautiful animation, whether 3D or 2D."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Macdonald |first=Moira |url=http://seattletimes.com/html/movies/2021037423_movieepicxml.html |title=‘Epic’: Wee warriors in a grand adventure |work=The Seattle Times |date=May 23, 2013 |accessdate=May 24, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714152912/http://seattletimes.com/html/movies/2021037423_movieepicxml.html |archivedate=July 14, 2014 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Holden of ''[[The New York Times]]'' gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of five, saying "As beautiful as it is, ''Epic'' is fatally lacking in visceral momentum and dramatic edge."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Holden |first=Stephen |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/24/movies/epic-directed-by-chris-wedge.html?_r=0 |title=Tiny Folk in a Big War of Good Versus Evil |work=The New York Times |date=May 23, 2013 |accessdate=May 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Euro Truck Simulator 2''''' (commonly abbreviated as '''''ETS2''''') is a [[vehicle simulation game]] developed and published by [[SCS Software]] for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Linux]] and [[macOS]] and was initially released as open development on 19 October 2012&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.scssoft.com/2012/10/the-time-is-now.html&lt;/ref&gt;. The game is a direct sequel to the 2008 game ''[[Euro Truck Simulator]]'' and it is the second video game in the ''[[Truck Simulator]]'' series. The player can drive one of a choice of [[Articulated vehicle|articulated]] trucks across a depiction of [[Europe]], picking up cargo from various locations and delivering it. As the game progresses, it is possible for the player to buy more vehicles, depots, and hire other drivers to work for them.

The game has sold over 5 million units on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] as of November 2018, according to the metrics website [[Steam Spy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://steamspy.com/app/227300 |title=Euro Truck Simulator 2 |last= |first= |date= |website=Steam Spy |publisher=|access-date=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Euro Truck Simulator 2 driver view screenshot.jpg|thumb|right|Driver's view from a [[DAF XF]] during game play]]
Players choose their HQ's location in any of the game map's cities. At first, the player can only take what are known as Quick jobs—these jobs involve making hired driver deliveries while employed by a delivery company, with a provided truck and all expenses (fuel, road tolls, ferry crossings) covered. As the player earns money or takes bank loans, they can eventually afford to buy themselves a truck, acquire a home garage, and start making more money by delivering cargo using their own truck instead of just being a driver for hire. Money earned in the game can be spent on upgrading or purchasing new trucks, hiring [[Non-player character|NPC]] drivers to take on deliveries, buying more garages and expanding the home garage to accommodate more trucks and drivers. The skills of the drivers hired by the player also grow with experience and the player can create a huge fleet of the trucks and drivers expanding the business across Europe. 

As players progress and earn money, they are also to purchase their own trailers, which can be fully customized in the same way as trucks. Player-owned trailers can be used to receive and deliver cargo at existing storage locations. Like trucks, trailers can also be allocated to company employees, resulting in higher income.  

The player gains experience points after each delivery. A skill point is awarded after each level-up. Skill points can be used to unlock deliveries that require different [[European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road|ADR]] classes, longer distance deliveries, special cargo loads, fragile cargo loads, deliveries that are urgent and eco-driving. This progression allows the player to take on better paid jobs.

The base game features 71 cities in twelve different countries, over twenty different types of cargo and over fifteen fictional European companies. There are four map DLCs that expand the game to more countries and locations, and multiple other truck and trailer DLCs.

The game also features a "Radio" feature, which allows players to play MP3 and [[Ogg|OGG]] files. It also allows the player to listen to [[Internet radio]].

The game includes two new truck companies, [[Scania AB|Scania]] and [[Renault Trucks|Renault]], with [[MAN SE|MAN]] returning from the [[German Truck Simulator|original game]]. [[DAF Trucks|DAF]], [[Iveco]], [[Mercedes-Benz]] and [[Volvo Trucks|Volvo]] trucks were not officially licensed and had their names changed to DAV, Ivedo, Majestic and Valiant respectively. Later updates included the official branding for the [[DAF XF]],&lt;ref name="DAF"&gt;{{cite web |title=DAF Trucks coming to Euro Truck Simulator 2! |url=http://blog.scssoft.com/2012/10/daf-trucks-coming-to-euro-truck.html |work=SCS Software's Blog |publisher=SCS Software |accessdate=25 January 2013 |date=27 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Volvo FH]], [[Iveco Stralis]]&lt;ref name="Volvo"&gt;{{cite web |title=A New ETS2 Patch Almost Here |url=http://blog.scssoft.com/2013/01/a-new-ets2-patch-almost-here.html |work=SCS Software's Blog |publisher=SCS Software |accessdate=25 January 2013 |date=25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mercedes-Benz Actros]].

In July 2013 a large update was released, fixing various graphical glitches, improving the toll booths and included the ability to switch off the trucks' speed limiter from within the gameplay options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2013/07/25/euro-truck-simulator-2-receives-a-truckload-of-fixes/ |title=Euro Truck Simulator 2 receives a truckload of fixes |publisher=Future Publishing Limited |website=PC Gamer |first=Perry |last=Vandell |date=25 July 2013 |accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
{{Video game reviews
| MC = 79/100&lt;ref name="MC"/&gt;
| Destruct = 8.5/10&lt;ref name="Destructoid"/&gt;
| PCGUS = 85/100&lt;ref name="PC Gamer"/&gt;
}}

The game was generally well received by critics, holding a score of 79/100 on [[Metacritic]], indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref name="MC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/euro-truck-simulator-2 |title=Euro Truck Simulator 2 for PC Reviews |publisher=CBS Interactive |website=Metacritic |date=18 January 2013 |accessdate=18 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review for ''[[Destructoid]]'', Jim Sterling praised the game's accessibility, noting how easy the GPS and map features were to use, as well as the option to stream European internet radio, and the multitude of control options available. He also praised the graphics, stating that "[f]rom the shape of the traffic lights to the atmosphere of the backdrops, there's a sense of individuality to each new territory you uncover, and the trucks themselves are lovingly recreated with an intricate level of detail", although he did criticise the [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|AI]] of the other vehicles on the road.&lt;ref name="Destructoid"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.destructoid.com/review-euro-truck-simulator-2-243592.phtml |title=Euro Truck Simulator 2 |website=Destructoid |first=Jim |last=Sterling |date=31 January 2013 |accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similarly favourable review, Tim Stone of ''[[PC Gamer]]'' called it "unexpectedly engrossing", praising the size of the map and the variation of the roads and scenery available. He did however have reservations about the accuracy of the surroundings, commenting "no one seems to have told SCS’s countryside crafters that rural Britain features long green things called hedges. Cities are often depicted with the shortest of visual shorthand – a few warehouses, the odd landmark if you’re lucky."&lt;ref name="PC Gamer"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/review/euro-truck-simulator-2-review/ |title=Euro Truck Simulator 2 review |publisher=Future Publishing Limited |website=PC Gamer |first=Tim |last=Stone |date=6 December 2012 |accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Awards ===
''PC Gamer'' awarded the game "Sim of the Year 2012" in its end-of-year awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2012/12/27/the-sim-of-the-year-2012-euro-truck-simulator-2/ |title=The Sim of the Year 2012: Euro Truck Simulator 2 |publisher=Future Publishing Limited |website=PC Gamer |first=Tim |last=Stone |date=27 December 2012 |accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]'' listed ''Euro Truck Simulator 2'' ninth on their list of "The 25 Best Simulation Games Ever Made".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/05/15/best-simulation-games/5/ |title=The 25 Best Simulation Games Ever Made |publisher=Rock, Paper, Shotgun |accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''Internet band''', also called an '''online band''', is a [[musical group]] whose members collaborate online through broadband by utilizing a content management system and local [[digital audio workstation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/virtual-band.htm|title=What is a virtual band?|author=|date=2 July 2008|website=HowStuffWorks.com|access-date=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is sometimes released under a [[Creative Commons]] license, so musicians can share their "samples" to create collaborative musical expressions for noncommercial purposes without ever meeting face to face.

==History==

=== Cathedral ===
In March 1996, Nora Farrell and [[William Duckworth (composer)|William Duckworth]] began to develop Cathedral, one of the first interactive works of music and art on the World Wide Web.  Their aim was to create an interactive website with web-based musical instruments that anyone could play.  Also in the preliminary stages of the system, they determined that they wanted to make a place on the Web for acoustic music through a series of live webcasts and performances online.

In June 1997, Cathedral went live online.  The first build of this system included streaming audio, streaming video, animation, images, and text.  At the time, there were fewer than one million sites on the World Wide Web and fewer than 2% of those made any sounds.

According to the creators of Cathedral, their goals at that point were:
* To create an imaginative, ongoing artistic experience that builds community.
* To blur the distinctions that separate composers, performers, and audiences.
* To offer each individual listener the ability to create his or her own unique work online.
By 2003, Cathedral consisted of three primary components:
* A website that featured a variety of interactive musical, artistic, and text-based experiences.
* A group of virtual instruments that allowed listeners to participate actively and creatively.
* An Internet band that gave periodic live performances and offered listeners focused moments in which to come together and play music in community online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Perceptual and Structural Implications of "Virtual" Music on the Web|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1196/annals.1284.036/abstract|journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|date = 2003-11-01|issn = 1749-6632|pages = 254–262|volume = 999|issue = 1|doi = 10.1196/annals.1284.036|first = William|last = Duckworth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current scenario==
Social networking sites have gained a large number of users because many aspects of society revolve around computers and the Internet. The music industry itself has undergone this change as well. People are using iTunes, YouTube and MySpace Music to share the music and communicate with others. Adaptively, artists and record labels can utilize Web sites and file sharing sites to spread their music.  Musicians who use the Internet can also form bands online.

Internet bands became popular in the early 2000s when music technology, file sharing and collaboration software became more prevalent on the Internet. While the extent of collaboration between bands may vary, an Internet band identifies as a band whose members collaborate on music projects via the Internet.

A growing number of websites offer people the opportunity to compose music online. They marry social networking with music mixing and uploading technology. Users decide what projects they wish to add their special touches to and how actively they want to get involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/virtual-band.htm/|title=What is a virtual band?|author=|date=2 July 2008|website=HowStuffWorks.com|access-date=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deadclowns.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadclowns.com/index.php?page=/about.php|title=The Dead Clowns|author=|date=|website=The Dead Clowns|access-date=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==
The advantages of joining an [[online band]] include the ability to collaborate with musicians, vocalists, [[audio engineers]], etc. who reside in any part of the world with [[Internet access]]. Also, since many online bands do not perform or record in "real-time", it allows members to record their track (their part of a collaboration) at their leisure.&lt;ref name="deadclowns.com"/&gt;

=== Education through online music collaboration ===
In addition to setting a platform to creatively collaborate with other musicians, online music collaboration gives opportunities to educators and students that were not possible before its conception.  This platform provides an alternative to the traditional 1:1 music lesson, but its effectiveness on a higher scale is questionable.

Research conducted in 2007 at [[Boston University]] led by [[musicologist]] and comparative educationist [[David G. Hebert]] provided five key challenges for online music education programs:
# Prejudice regarding the legitimacy of online degrees
# Coordination between distance education and music departments
# Pressure to maximize profits at the expense of educational quality
# Management of adjunct music instructors
# Management of student behavior and provision of student services
To address these challenges, Hebert pointed out the importance of expert mentors, outstanding research theses completed online, a strong record of graduate job placement from online programs, detailed planning between instructors and music departments, and the implementation of assessment moderation systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ814926.pdf|title = Five Challenges and Solutions in Online Music Teacher Education|last = Hebert|first = David G.|date = September 2007|journal = Research and Issues in Music Education|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collaboration==
Online music collaboration is an Internet-based system designed to help coordinate online music projects. Most platforms provide a virtual space to upload recorded music files, a community forum where members can offer feedback or make alterations to the uploaded music.

Each musician usually needs to record to a click track or metronome and upload the instrument or vocals for the song independently. Then a designated Internet music producer can edit for timing and tightness between all tracks, arrange, optimize and mix all instruments together and do a final mastering process to get a complete song out of single tracks.

== Related phenomenon ==
Internet-based music collaboration can be done by individuals who never form one permanent band. The [[Playing for Change]] Foundation is a musical charity that releases music recorded by musicians from all around the globe, only some of whom have gone on to play together live.  Even more decentralized collaboration happens between YouTube users; one ''[[Cracked (magazine)|Cracked]]'' columnist praised the cover of the ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' theme performed by violinist Jason Yang and guitarist and sound engineer Roger Lima and directed by Paolo Dy.{{quote|And these people have never met. The Internet isn't just causing collaborations between people who would otherwise never have got together, it's creating collaborations between people who still haven't got together. There's just so much creativity being uploaded that we've reached collaboration critical-mass, where mixes can be generated across the world with nothing but HTTP.  The result is a "super-feit" -- a copy superior to the original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cracked.com/blog/5-music-videos-that-justify-existence-internet/#ixzz2AWxUYQCe|title=5 Music Videos That Justify the Existence of the Internet|author=|date=|website=Cracked.com|access-date=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Internet band communities ==
Internet bands develop online and base the foundations their work within various communities.  The systems below are examples of communities which support the formation and maintenance of online bands:

'''''It's Magic, Charlie Brown''''' is the 21st [[prime-time]] [[animation|animated]] [[TV special]] based upon the [[comic strip]] ''[[Peanuts]],'' by [[Charles M. Schulz]]. It originally aired on April 28, 1981. The special was later released on DVD on September 2, 2008 as a bonus feature on [[Warner Home Video]]'s remastered deluxe DVD of ''[[It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Charlie-Brown-Peanuts-Specials-Great-Pumpkin/9890 Charlie Brown/Peanuts Specials DVD news: Rear Box Art for It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown: Remastered Deluxe Edition | TVShowsOnDVD.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016212655/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Charlie-Brown-Peanuts-Specials-Great-Pumpkin/9890 |date=2008-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot summary ==
Charlie Brown decides that Snoopy needs to educate himself, and gives him his library card to check out a few books. Snoopy decides to take out one book, a book about magic, which after reading, influences him to hold a Vaudeville show (under the stage name "The Great [[Harry Houdini|Houndini]]"). During the opening, Snoopy practices magic with Woodstock by his side. Charlie Brown warns both of them that the cat next door will get upset if he and Woodstock get really loud. However, Snoopy and Woodstock continue to perform more magic tricks and the cat next door angrily rips Snoopy's doghouse apart.

He recruits Marcie as one assistant and announcer, and Sally as his silent assistant. In the show, he pulls a rabbit out of his hat (actually Woodstock with rabbit ears), then does a ring trick that goes wrong. Both of these tricks raise the ire of one heckler who demands their money back and does not see the humor the others see, but Snoopy quickly shuts him up both times. He also does the "stick-in-the-hole" trick to Franklin, the "amputation-decapitation" trick to Peppermint Patty, cutting Linus's trademark security blanket into strips (which appears to fail), the levitation trick to Lucy van Pelt, and biggest of all, making Charlie Brown literally disappear.

A sudden rainstorm ends the show early, and Charlie Brown is left invisible. Convinced he is going to remain that way for the rest of his life, he prepares to roam the world as a lost soul, and Sally begins moving her stuff into his room. Before Charlie starts roaming, he decides to feed Snoopy to show him what has happened. When Snoopy realizes he cannot yet reverse the trick, he tries a couple of different ideas to make Charlie Brown somewhat visible again, including draping a sheet over his head and scaring Sally, and when Charlie Brown looks in the mirror and sees that Snoopy made him a ghost, he faints. Despite this shortcoming, Charlie Brown realizes he has a golden opportunity to kick Lucy's infamous football without her usual prank of pulling it away at the last second. Taking advantage of his invisibility, Charlie Brown finally kicks the ball out of a bewildered Lucy's hand and then taunts her about it.

Furious over Charlie Brown succeeding in kicking the ball, Lucy gets the magic book back to give to Snoopy, threatening that if he doesn't make Charlie Brown visible again, she'll pound him. After starting out by entering his doghouse lab and working with chemicals so volatile, they explode and start a chain reaction of explosions that chase him out of the house, Snoopy continues to study the book, and tests a number of counterspells on Woodstock (making his feet bigger, then head bigger, then making him disappear, but successfully reversing each spell), he goes about casting his counterspell in all directions, unsure just where Charlie Brown is. As Snoopy wanders into a vicinity where Lucy is setting up another place-kick, Charlie Brown happens to run by where Snoopy is practicing. Just as he is about to kick the ball again, Snoopy casts the counterspell in Charlie Brown's direction, causing him to unknowingly become visible again. Lucy witnesses his reappearance and pulls the ball away for the eleventh time as Charlie Brown winds up to kick it, then promptly falls on his back.

However, Charlie Brown fails to display embarrassment and says that he finally kicked the ball, though Lucy considers this a false statement, saying no one will believe him. When Lucy scoffs at Snoopy's magic abilities, the insulted beagle magically levitates Lucy into the sky like he levitated her during the magic show earlier, and leaves her stuck there as payback. Snoopy and Charlie Brown laugh and happily dance away to conclude a satisfying day, ignoring Lucy's pleas to get her down.

Linus eventually pulls Lucy down with his blanket during the closing credits, and Lucy, angry and embarrassed about what happened, gives up and stomps away.

[[File:KotD Illustrated 01 cover.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Cover of the 1st issue.]]
'''Knights of the Dinner Table Illustrated''' (a.k.a. ''K.ILL'') is a [[comic book]] created by [[Jolly R. Blackburn]] and is published by [[Kenzer &amp; Company]]. It portrays many of the same stories as [[Knights of the Dinner Table]] (KODT) but from the point of view of the player characters themselves.

The first monthly issue was published in June 2000.

The comic was suddenly cancelled seemingly mid-story with issue #41 when suddenly (in strip) the "set" which the characters were "acting" on was knocked over. The "director" then informs the "cast" that the series was cancelled due to a lack of sales. There was no other explanation listed within the book other than the movie set parody listed in strip.

==Characters==
The comic centers on the ''Untouchable Trio (plus one)'': the battlemage '''Teflon Billy''', the fighter '''El Ravager''' and the thief '''Knuckles, King of the Wallclimbers'''. Initially the ''plus one'' was the barbarian '''Zayre''', who eventually departed and was replaced by '''Thorina'''.

The comic occasionally follows the adventures the Black Hands and other characters from KODT, sometimes in other universes (e.g. Cyberhack).

K.ILL is strictly and humorously faithful to the concept that its characters are experiencing reality, and are not merely characters in a role-playing game. Some of the humor stems from the explanations that the characters give for events that, in KODT, stem from the gameplayers' mundane commitments or, in reality, from the comic's business decisions. For example, when Bob (in KODT) is unable to game for a while, Knuckles (in K.ILL) is unavailable due to commitments to his Guild. When K.ILL's artists changed in issue 4, the characters experience and comment on the alteration in their appearance as the result of a ''[[Werner Heisenberg|Hazenberg]]'s Dimension Shifting Portal of Chaos''.
K.ILL is noticeably more graphically violent than KODT, even while depicting the same event, since in the latter the in-game violence is represented only by dialogue.

'''Galerie Lambiek''' is a  Dutch [[direct market|comic book store]] and art gallery in [[Amsterdam]], founded on November 8, 1968&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/dutchcomics/1968.htm|title=Dutch Comics 1968 -1979|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by {{Interlanguage link multi|Kees Kousemaker|nl}}. From 1968 to 2015 it was located in the Kerkstraat, but in November 2015 the store moved to the Koningsstraat 27.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/news/284/comicshop_lambiek_moves_from_kerkstraat_132_to_koningsstraat_27.html#.VotTiFLxuNI|title=Comicshop Lambiek moves from Kerkstraat 132 to Koningsstraat 27|work=Lambiek Comic Shop}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As of 2018, Lambiek is the oldest comics store in Europe &lt;ref&gt;http://www.comicon.com/2018/10/11/happy-50th-to-europes-oldest-comic-shop-lambiek-in-amsterdam/&lt;/ref&gt; and the oldest worldwide still in existence. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.valiseetparapluie.com/2016/12/lambiek-the-worlds-oldest-comics-shop/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/memories-are-made-of-these/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lambiek website is one of the longest-running resources about comics and cartoonists on the Internet. The website features a web shop for comic books, eComics, and original art,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/webshop.html|title=Comic books for sale in Lambiek's webshop - Lambiek Comic Shop|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a news page with articles of interest to comics fans&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/news/comic_fan_news.html|title=News overview|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and online art exhibitions. The flagship of the site is the ''Comiclopedia'', an illustrated compendium of over 13,700 international comic artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/comiclopedia.html|title=Comiclopedia - Illustrated artist compendium - Lambiek Comiclopedia|work=lambiek.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name= "lambiek.net8" &gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/comics/lambiek_online_1.htm|title=The History of Lambiek - Lambiek at Lambiek.net (1999-2004) |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site also features a history of [[Dutch comics]], mostly researched and written by Kees Kousemaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/infomenu/faq.html?fcategory=Comiclopedia&amp;fid=127|title=Lambiek Comic Shop|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/dutchcomics/|title=Introduction|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Lambiek" originated as a misspelling of the name of the comics character [[Lambik]], from the popular [[Suske &amp; Wiske]] comic book series created by [[Belgium|Belgian]] artist [[Willy Vandersteen]].&lt;ref name="lambiek.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/v/vandersteen.htm|title=Willy Vandersteen|date=1 January 1970|work=lambiek.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; The logo of the shop is an image from the ''Suske en Wiske'' album ''Prinses Zagemeel'' (''Princess Sawdust'').&lt;ref name="lambiek.net"/&gt;

The store has held art exhibitions and book signings by comic creators, including [[Gilbert Shelton]], [[Will Eisner]] &lt;ref name= "lambiek.net4" &gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/comics/lambiek_kerkstraat78_1.htm|title=The History of Lambiek (1980-1985)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name= "lambiek.net6" &gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/comics/lambiek_kerkstraat78_3.htm|title=The History of Lambiek (1990-1995)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Tanino Liberatore]], [[Joost Swarte]], [[Peter Pontiac]] &lt;ref name= "lambiek.net5" &gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/comics/lambiek_kerkstraat78_2.htm|title=The History of Lambiek (1986-1989)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name= "lambiek.net11" &gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/comics/lambiek_kerkstraat132_2.htm|title=The History of Lambiek (2010-2015)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;., [[Don Lawrence]] &lt;ref name= "lambiek.net6" &gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/comics/lambiek_kerkstraat78_3.htm|title=The History of Lambiek (1990-1995)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name= "lambiek.net7" &gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/comics/lambiek_kerkstraat78_4.htm|title=The History of Lambiek (1996-2003)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[André Franquin]], [[Robert Crumb]] &lt;ref name= "lambiek.net6" &gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/comics/lambiek_kerkstraat78_3.htm|title=The History of Lambiek (1990-1995)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Lorenzo Mattotti]] &lt;ref name= "lambiek.net6" &gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/comics/lambiek_kerkstraat78_3.htm|title=The History of Lambiek (1990-1995)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name= "lambiek.net7" &gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/comics/lambiek_kerkstraat78_4.htm|title=The History of Lambiek (1996-2003)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Charles Burns (cartoonist)|Charles Burns]] &lt;ref name= "lambiek.net7" &gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/comics/lambiek_kerkstraat78_4.htm|title=The History of Lambiek (1996-2003)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Daniel Clowes]]&lt;ref name= "lambiek.net7" &gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/comics/lambiek_kerkstraat78_4.htm|title=The History of Lambiek (1996-2003)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; , [[Jim Woodring]] &lt;ref name= "lambiek.net7" &gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/comics/lambiek_kerkstraat78_4.htm|title=The History of Lambiek (1996-2003)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Chris Ware]] &lt;ref name= "lambiek.net7" &gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/comics/lambiek_kerkstraat78_4.htm|title=The History of Lambiek (1996-2003)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Judith Vanistendael]] &lt;ref name= "lambiek.net10" &gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/comics/lambiek_kerkstraat132_1.htm|title=The History of Lambiek (2005-2010)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Marc Bell (cartoonist)|Marc Bell]] &lt;ref name= "lambiek.net10" &gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/comics/lambiek_kerkstraat132_1.htm|title=The History of Lambiek (2005-2010)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Jillian Tamaki]] and [[Mariko Tamaki]] &lt;ref name= "lambiek.net11" &gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/comics/lambiek_kerkstraat132_2.htm|title=The History of Lambiek (2010-2015)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[David Collier (cartoonist)|David Collier]] &lt;ref name= "lambiek.net11" &gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/comics/lambiek_kerkstraat132_2.htm|title=The History of Lambiek (2010-2015)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Glen Baxter (cartoonist)|Glen Baxter]] &lt;ref name= "lambiek.net11" &gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/comics/lambiek_kerkstraat132_2.htm|title=The History of Lambiek (2010-2015)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Jaromír Švejdík]]&lt;ref name= "lambiek.net11" &gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/comics/lambiek_kerkstraat132_2.htm|title=The History of Lambiek (2010-2015)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Scott McCloud]] &lt;ref name= "lambiek.net11" &gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/comics/lambiek_kerkstraat132_2.htm|title=The History of Lambiek (2010-2015)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Dave Cooper]] &lt;ref name= "lambiek.net12" &gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/comics/lambiek_koningsstraat27_1.htm|title=The History of Lambiek (2015-present)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Turtel Onli]] &lt;ref name= "lambiek.net12" &gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/comics/lambiek_koningsstraat27_1.htm|title=The History of Lambiek (2015-present)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and  [[Derf Backderf]] &lt;ref name= "lambiek.net11" &gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/comics/lambiek_kerkstraat132_2.htm|title=The History of Lambiek (2010-2015)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name= "lambiek.net12" &gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/comics/lambiek_koningsstraat27_1.htm|title=The History of Lambiek (2015-present)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==
Kees Kousemaker (1942-2010) was a Dutch comics expert, born in [[Steenbergen]], [[Netherlands]]. He first arose to prominence when he opened Lambiek in November 1968, the first specialized comic book store in Europe and the second oldest worldwide after [[Gary Arlington]]'s San Francisco Comic Book Company which was established earlier that year in April, according to the Lambiek website.&lt;ref name="lambiek.net1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/infomenu/about_us.html|title=About the store - Lambiek Comic Shop|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/comics/underground.htm |title=Comics History: Underground comix and the underground press |work=lambiek.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name= "lambiek.net2" &gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/comics/lambiek_kerkstraat104_1.htm|title=The History of Lambiek (1968-1975)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actually, an even older comic book store is known to have opened its doors in May 1967, George Henderson's Canadian, Toronto-based Memory Lane Books&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookdaily.com/championing_comics/progressive-shops/canadas-first-comic-shop/ |title=Canada’s 1st Comic Shop? |first=Scott | last=VanderPloeg |date=14 September 2011 |work=comicbookdaily.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; (itself a continuation of the Viking Bookshop he had already opened on another location in the spring of 1966&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://torontoist.com/2015/09/vintage-toronto-ads-memory-lane/ | title=Vintage Toronto Ads: Memory Lane &amp;ndash; The story of "Captain George" Henderson, Toronto's first retailer to specialize in comic books. | first=Jamie |last=Bradburn | work=torontoist.com |date=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;), making Lambiek the third oldest store. All three stores had a  strong focus on underground comics in common. With Memory Lane Books no longer in existence since the 1980s and the closure of Arlington's store in 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://laughingsquid.com/gary-arlington-1938-2014-owner-of-the-first-comic-book-store-in-the-united-states/ |title=Gary Arlington (1938-2014), Owner of the First Comic Book Store in the United States |first=Lori | last=Dorn |date=6 February 2014 |work=laughingsquid.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lambiek therefore has become the oldest comic book store still in existence as of 2017. &lt;ref name= "lambiek.net2" /&gt;

As a result of his exhibitions and attention to the early work of young cartoonists such as [[Peter Pontiac]] and [[Joost Swarte]], he established collaborations and friendships with many Dutch and international artists, such as [[Will Eisner]]. &lt;ref name= "lambiek.net4" &gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/comics/lambiek_kerkstraat78_1.htm|title=The History of Lambiek (1980-1985)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986 Lambiek established its famous [[Art museum|gallery]], where many comics artists could come and have heavily mediatized exhibitions of their work. The first expo revolved around the magazine ''[[RAW (magazine)|RAW]]'' and was co-organized by [[Joost Swarte]]. &lt;ref name= "lambiek.net5" &gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/comics/lambiek_kerkstraat78_2.htm|title=The History of Lambiek (1986-1989)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;Kousemaker also published books about Dutch comic culture, such as ''Strip voor Strip'' (1970) &lt;ref name= "lambiek.net2" /&gt; and ''Stripleksikon der Lage Landen'' (1979). &lt;ref name= "lambiek.net3" &gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/comics/lambiek_kerkstraat104_2.htm|title=The History of Lambiek (1975-1980)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also responsible for a special [[Yiddish]] edition of [[Will Eisner]]'s ''[[A Contract with God]]'' (1984), which was presented to the press in the presence of Eisner himself. &lt;ref name= "lambiek.net4" /&gt; 

Kees Kousemaker was also the instigator behind the ''Stripheldenbuurt'' in [[Almere]], a district where all the street names were named after famous cartoonists and comics characters. &lt;ref name= "lambiek.net9" &gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/comics/lambiek_kerkstraat119.htm|title=The History of Lambiek (2003-2005)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 May 2006 he was knighted in the [[Order of Orange-Nassau]]. &lt;ref name= "lambiek.net10" &gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/comics/lambiek_kerkstraat132_1.htm|title=The History of Lambiek (2005-2010)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kousemaker died April 27, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/k/kousemaker.htm|title=Kees Kousemaker|date=1 January 1970|work=lambiek.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name= "lambiek.net10" &gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/comics/lambiek_kerkstraat132_1.htm|title=The History of Lambiek (2005-2010)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name= "lambiek.net11" &gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/comics/lambiek_kerkstraat132_2.htm|title=The History of Lambiek (2010-2015)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lambiek website==
===History===
Although '''lambiek.net''' is the store's main domain name, Lambiek started a website '''www.lambiek.com''' in 1994&lt;ref name="lambiek.net1"/&gt; when Kees started to store historical comic book info online. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s the site kept its original blue design, until Kousemaker's death in 2010. From August 2012 on, Kees Kousemaker's son Boris ordered a complete remake of the site, converting all existing information into databases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/news/155/lambiek_s_revamped_website_kicks_off_.html#.VotcvFLxuNI|title=Lambiek's revamped website kicks off!|work=Lambiek Comic Shop}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comiclopedia===
The ''Comiclopedia'' is an online encyclopedia which features biographical information and illustrations, comic strip images, album covers, frame grabs, and memorabilia about every individual comics artist whose name can be identified by signature. &lt;ref name= "lambiek.net8" &gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/comics/lambiek_online_1.htm|title=The History of Lambiek - Lambiek at Lambiek.net (1999-2004) |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; All artists are alphabetized and can both be looked up by name or by their nationality. The emphasis is mostly on comics artists, though [[cartoonist]]s, [[caricaturist]]s, [[animator]]s, [[illustrator]]s and/or celebrities who once drew comics themselves are also listed. Visitors can mail suggestions for new names, additions or corrections. &lt;ref name= "lambiek.net8" &gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/comics/lambiek_online_1.htm|title=The History of Lambiek - Lambiek at Lambiek.net (1999-2004) |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018 more than 13.700 names have a page. &lt;ref name= "lambiek.net8" &gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/comics/lambiek_online_1.htm|title=The History of Lambiek - Lambiek at Lambiek.net (1999-2004) |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of comics sections===
The history section also includes an in-depth examination of [[Bulgarian comics]], researched and written by Vladimir Nedialkov, with additions by Stiliana Thepileva .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/infomenu/faq.html?fcategory=Comiclopedia&amp;fid=132|title=Lambiek Comic Shop|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/comics/bulgarian.htm|title=History of Bulgarian Comics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site also features a historical overview of the comics magazines ''[[Spirou (magazine)|Spirou]]'', ''[[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin]]'', ''[[Pif gadget]]'', ''[[Pilote]]'', and ''[[Wimmen's Comix]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/magazines/index.htm|title=Comic Magazines|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lambiek also features separate articles about the [[Comics Code]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/comics/code.htm|title=The Comics Code|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frederic Wertham]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/comics/wertham_fredric.htm|title=Dr. Fredric Wertham|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Disney comics]] artists around the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/comics/disneyartists.htm|title=Disney comic artists in the Comiclopedia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rolf Kauka]] artists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/comics/kauka.htm|title=Kauka artists in the Comiclopedia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[erotic comics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/comics/erotic_comics.htm|title=Erotic Comics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[newspaper strips]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/strips/index.htm|title=Early US Newspaper Comics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[underground comics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/comics/underground.htm|title=Underground comix and the underground press|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[webcomics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/comics/webcomics.htm|title=Webcomics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a column for thus unidentified comics where the site's owners ask visitors for help with identification of the anonymous artists or with providing more biographical info and/or illustrations about them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/comics/help.htm|title=The Comiclopedia needs your help!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Livestation''' was a platform for distributing live television and radio broadcasts over a data network.&lt;ref name="channels"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.livestation.com/channels | title = Live television and radio | accessdate = 2008-03-09 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091007225144/http%3A//www.livestation.com/channels | archivedate = 2009-10-07 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally developed by Skinkers Ltd. and is now an independent company called Livestation Ltd. The service was originally based on peer-to-peer technology acquired from [[Microsoft Research]].&lt;ref name="technology"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.livestation.com/broadcast_platform?tracker=main_menu | title = Scalable High Quality Solution | accessdate = 2008-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between mid-June 2013 and mid-July Livestation was unavailable to some subscribers due to technical issues.

In late 2016, the service closed down without notice.&lt;ref name="N/A"&gt;{{cite web|last1=N/A|first1=N/A|title=N/A|url=http://www.livestation.com|website=LiveStation|publisher=Livestation|accessdate=23 November 2016|ref=N/A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Livestation aggregated international news channels online and offered them in a number of ways:

* '''Free to watch:''' a number of channels could be watched for free on the Livestation website or on their desktop player, a freely downloadable video application that presented all the channels through one interface.
* '''Premium service:''' some of the free channels were also available on a subscription basis both in higher quality (800kbit/s) and in lower (256kbit/s) delivered via an international content distribution network for higher reliability. 
* '''Mobile:''' Livestation launched BBC World News on the iPhone in 16 European countries and Al Jazeera English globally. The apps were available in the iPhone AppStore and stream the live TV channel 24/7 on both Wi-Fi and 3G connections.

Livestation broadcast streams encoded in [[VC-1]] format (Livestation is not currently using peer-to-peer). Playback controls were overlaid on top of the video stream. Unlike services such as [[Joost]] which offer video on demand channels, Livestation streams live broadcasts.&lt;ref name="Demo"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://soapbox.msn.com/video.aspx?vid=4da4263c-68a0-411f-8eec-58dc81bf22da | title = Livestation demonstration | accessdate = 2007-07-05 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070707053000/http://soapbox.msn.com/video.aspx?vid=4da4263c-68a0-411f-8eec-58dc81bf22da | archivedate = 2007-07-07 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Livestation provided a website, mobile website and native applications for iOS, Android, Nokia and Blackberry handsets. Early models of Samsung TV were also supported. They also provided desktop software available for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Mac OS|Mac]] (including PowerPC) and [[Linux]]. The cross-platform compatibility of the desktop software was facilitated by the [[Qt (toolkit)|Qt]] framework. Social networking features were later added that include the ability to chat with other viewers and also find out what others are watching through a user generated rating system. You could search and select the available channels either from the website, or from within the software.

In the first quarter of 2011 by 1047 percent, resulting in the first profitable quarter in its history.&lt;ref name="press"&gt;[http://blog.livestation.com/index.php/2011/04/the-livestation-revolution/ The Livestation revolution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110416014305/http://blog.livestation.com/index.php/2011/04/the-livestation-revolution/ |date=2011-04-16 }}. Livestation Blog. 11 April 2011. Retrieved on 21 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between mid-June and mid-July 2013, Livestation suffered a prolonged series of technical issues and was unavailable to some users.

In early 2015, Livestation re-branded their entire site changing what channels were offered and bringing in an interactive feature.  Some stations on the app were not on the mainsite and vice versa.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3415">'''Mutual knowledge''' in [[game theory]] is information known by all participatory agents. However, unlike [[Common knowledge (logic)|common knowledge]], a related topic, mutual knowledge does not require that all agents are aware that this knowledge is mutual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|edition = Spring 2014|title = Common Knowledge|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/common-knowledge/|date = 2014-01-01|first = Peter|last = Vanderschraaf|first2 = Giacomo|last2 = Sillari|editor-first = Edward N.|editor-last = Zalta}}&lt;/ref&gt; All common knowledge is mutual knowledge, but not all mutual knowledge is common knowledge. Mutual knowledge can arise accidentally, due to a failure to design the game properly, so all players independently discover this mutual knowledge, or deliberately, due to the expected course of the game.

== The difference between mutual knowledge and common knowledge ==

The difference is crucial in a co-operation game. For example, in the game depicted below, with a random event determining the payoff matrix, both players, being fully rational, presume the more likely option to have occurred. However, suppose each player separately finds out that the random number, which was created privately and which determines the payoff matrix, was 1. However, neither are told that the other player is also aware of this.  

Player A presumes Player B is not aware the random number is 1. They then observe that if the random number is 2-100, the best choice for B is always b1. So they choose a2, which would give them the best possible payoff in this matrix. Symmetrically, Player B presumes Player A expects the random numbers 2-100 and chooses a1, so B chooses b2. As a result, the players had a final result of (1, a2, b2), with a payoff of 1 for both - the lowest possible payoff (total or individual).  

Now suppose that it is common knowledge that the random number is 1 - that is, both players are also aware that the other player knows the random number is 1, in addition to knowing this themselves. Given this, the best choice for A is a1, with an average of 6.5, and the best choice for B is b1, with an average of 6.5 also, giving an outcome of (1, a1, b1) with a payoff of 8 for both - the highest possible total payoff.   

Common knowledge tends to lead to co-operative behavior more often than purely mutual knowledge, which can often lead to anti-cooperative behavior as shown in the example above, as the participants are aware that the knowledge is mutual knowledge and can all decide on behalf of this knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The psychology of coordination and common knowledge.|url = http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0037037|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|pages = 657-676|volume = 107|issue = 4|doi = 10.1037/a0037037|first = Kyle A.|last = Thomas|first2 = Peter|last2 = DeScioli|first3 = Omar Sultan|last3 = Haque|first4 = Steven|last4 = Pinker}}&lt;/ref&gt; This works best in a symmetric game, like the left matrix below.

The term '''panel operator''' generally relates to any person who is employed to operate a broadcast console.  This term is more often used in the radio industry.  In the U.S., insiders refer to a broadcast console as a 'board', and in turn, refer to those operating it as a '''board operator'''.

Panel operators usually do not have on-air speaking roles, and focus only on presenting the program to air technically. People who operate the panel as well as having a speaking role on a show are often known as [[anchors]]. Most music announcers these days operate the panel as well as presenting their shift to air.

Panel operators are usually responsible for (but not limited to) the following duties:

* Keeping talent informed of the show's progress
* Keeping the show on time, and timing out to news and other programming elements
* Playing music, [[Radio commercial|commercial]]s and programming elements at appropriate times
* Operating the on-air telephone system
* Co-ordinating and inserting elements such as [[traffic report]]s
* Ensuring that talent [[microphone]] levels are acceptable, and switching microphones on and off

Panel operators need to be technically able, good at working under pressure and dealing with talent egos, conscious of time constraints and able to think quickly when something goes wrong. The entire on-air presentation of the show is reliant upon their ability.

==Plot==
In [[Antarctica]], three young penguin brothers—Skipper, Kowalski, and Rico—defy the laws of nature to save an egg the other penguins believe to be doomed. After saving it from a pack of [[leopard seals]] and accidentally setting themselves adrift on an iceberg, the egg hatches into their new member, Private.

Ten years later (after the events of the [[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted|previous film]]), the penguins decide to leave the circus to celebrate Private's birthday by breaking into the [[United States Bullion Depository|United States Gold Depository]] at [[Fort Knox]] in order to treat him to a discontinued snack called "Cheezy Dibbles" in the vending machine of their break room. Despite this, Private begins to feel out of place with the team, as he is constantly described as being the "secretary/mascot". Suddenly, they are abducted by the machine and sent to [[Venice]], [[Italy]] by Dr. Octavius Brine, a renowned geneticist who removes his human disguise and reveals he is actually an octopus named Dave, who has grown resentful of penguins after their cuteness had him shunned from every zoo and aquarium across the globe.

Rico swallows Dave's collection of [[snowglobes]] along with a canister of a green substance called the Medusa Serum before the four escape and are chased through the canals and streets of Venice by Dave's henchmen. When cornered, they are rescued by a group of animals from an [[Arctic]] elite undercover interspecies task force agency called "The North Wind" consisting of their leader, a [[gray wolf]] whose name is classified (in which Skipper mistakenly calls him "Classified" throughout the film), a [[harp seal]] demolitionist named Short Fuse, a [[polar bear]] named Corporal, and an intelligent [[snowy owl]] named Eva, who Kowalski instantly falls in love with. Their mission is to help animals who can't help themselves and have been fighting Dave to protect the penguin population.

At their hideout, their communication systems are hacked by Dave, who reveals that he has an enormous supply of the Medusa Serum and that he intends to capture the penguins out of every zoo he was kicked out of. Viewing the penguins as a hindrance to their mission, Classified tranquilizes the group and sends the group to their most remote base (which happens to be on [[Madagascar]]) but the penguins awaken mid-flight and crash land in the [[Sahara Desert]] before making their way to [[Shanghai, China]], which they mistake for [[Dublin, Ireland]]. Discovering Dave's next target in Shanghai using Dave's snowglobe collection, the penguins ship themselves to the same current location and make their way to the zoo. Skipper disguise Private as a mermaid-tailed penguin (a tourist attraction) to distract Dave from his real target, Private himself is captured along with the Shanghai penguins after the North Wind arrives to put a stop to Dave's plan. The penguins take the North Wind's high-tech plane to give chase, but inadvertently self-destruct the machine. They manage to track Private to an island base, using a tracking device planted on him when Classified darted them before planting them in a flight to Madagascar. 

Meanwhile, on the island, Dave demonstrates his way to use the medusa serum (most likely gotten from the islands plants) to genetically mutate the penguins into hideous monsters as an effort to make humans disgusted by them as revenge.

Skipper and Classified argue on the best means to rescue the captives and stop Dave, finally settling on Classified's plan of a frontal assault and Skipper agrees to act as a diversion. The North Wind manages to corner Dave in his lair only to be captured by Dave's henchmen as well as the other penguins. Dave demonstrates his mutation ray at full power on Private, apparently disintegrating him with the beam, but unbeknownst to them he escapes at the last minute by using a paper clip he swallowed earlier. Private rescues the North Wind members, who want to [[tactical formation|regroup]] due to lack of equipment, but Private, not wanting to leave anyone behind goes to stop Dave. As Dave's submarine docks at [[New York City|New York]] with the promise of returning the penguins he found to the zoo, he turns the ray on the rest of the penguins, mutating them all into hideous monsters. The city erupts into chaos as the brainwashed, mutated penguins run amok on the terrified human crowd. Getting Skipper, Kowalski and Rico back to their senses, Private decides to connect himself into the ray to return them to normal. After fending off Dave and his henchman, they manage to turn all the penguins back to normal in one huge blast.

Private is left partially mutated from the machine while the rest of the penguins are restored to normal. Despite his strange new look, the Penguins show their gratitude and new-found respect for Private. Dave (who was caught in the blast) has been turned into a pipsqueak version of himself and is trapped in a snow globe where he is admired by a little girl. Finally seeing one another as equals, Classified promises to grant the Penguins anything they want. In addition to Kowalski getting a kiss from Eva, the Penguins are given their own jet packs and they then fly off above the clouds looking for their new adventures.

In a [[mid-credits scene]], the Penguins return to the circus and plug Mort into the ray and use him to revert Private back to normal. Mort does not appear to show any side effects from the ray until he manages to swallow King Julien whole.

On May 20, 2014, the film's release date was moved up to November 26, 2014, from its initial March 27, 2015, date, switching places with DreamWorks Animation's other film ''[[Home (2015 animated film)|Home]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2014/05/the-penguins-of-madagascar-release-date-home-dreamworks-animation/ |title=DreamWorks Animation Moves Up 'Penguins Of Madagascar' Bow, Bumps 'Home' To 2015 |work=Deadline.com |date=May 20, 2014 |accessdate=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], DreamWorks Animation's CEO, reasoned that the film, coming from one of DWA's most successful franchises, would have an easier task to stand out around the [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] holiday season, while ''Home'' was to try to take advantage of a less competitive spring release window and repeat successful spring launches of some of DWA's original films including ''[[The Croods]]'' and ''[[How to Train Your Dragon (film)|How to Train Your Dragon]]''.&lt;ref name=SAQ22014&gt;{{cite web|title=DreamWorks Animation SKG's (DWA) CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg on Q2 2014 Results - Earnings Call Transcript|url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/2355535-dreamworks-animation-skgs-dwa-ceo-jeffrey-katzenberg-on-q2-2014-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single|publisher=Seeking Alpha|accessdate=July 30, 2014|date=July 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was released two weeks earlier in China, on November 14, 2014.&lt;ref name=DeadlineHitChina&gt;{{cite web|last=Robb|first=David|url=http://deadline.com/2014/10/penguins-of-madagascar-will-hit-china-before-opening-stateside-857265/|title=‘Penguins Of Madagascar’ Will Hit China Before Opening Stateside|date=October 21, 2014|work=Deadline|accessdate=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical response===
The film has a 73% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 107 reviews, with an average rating of 6.2/10. The site's consensus was "''Penguins of Madagascar'' is fast and brightly colored enough to entertain small children, but too frantically silly to offer real filmgoing fun for the whole family."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/penguins_of_madagascar/ | title=Penguins of Madagascar | work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | publisher=[[Flixster]] | accessdate=October 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film achieved a score of 53 out of 100 based on 31 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/penguins-of-madagascar | title=Penguins of Madagascar Reviews | work=[[Metacritic]] | publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] | accessdate=July 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Rechtshaffen of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' gave the film a negative review, saying "While there are plenty of madcap antics to fill a feature, all that manic energy ultimately proves to be more exhausting than exhilarating."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/penguins-madagascar-film-review-748219|title='Penguins of Madagascar': Film Review|author=Michael Rechtshaffen|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=November 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth Weitzman of the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' gave the film three out of five stars, saying "Granted, it's no classic, but a sassy script and good-natured voice work from Benedict Cumberbatch and John Malkovich should keep kids and grownups entertained over the holidays."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/penguins-madagascar-movie-review-article-1.2022223|title=‘Penguins of Madagascar,’ movie review|work=NY Daily News|accessdate=November 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave the film a B, saying "Frenetic and frequently funny, ''Penguins Of Madagascar'' represents the DreamWorks Animation franchise style—which boils down to self-aware, but naïve, talking animals who learn kid-friendly life lessons—at its most palatable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/review/penguins-madagascar-dreamworks-animation-its-most--212233|title=Review: Penguins Of Madagascar is DreamWorks Animation at its most amusingly energetic |publisher=''[[The A.V. Club]]''|accessdate=November 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ben Kenigsberg of ''[[The New York Times]]'' gave the film a positive review, saying "The lack of originality is offset by sheer silliness, including Classified and Skipper's Abbott and Costello-style argument over whether there's a long I in 'diversion.' The word fits the movie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/26/movies/penguins-of-madagascar-with-voice-of-benedict-cumberbatch.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss|title=‘Penguins of Madagascar,’ With Voice of Benedict Cumberbatch|author=Ben Kenigsberg|work=The New York Times|accessdate=November 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Renaissance Man'''" is the 170th episode of ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'', and the last standard-length episode of the [[Star Trek: Voyager (season 7)|seventh season]] (and series). The succeeding episode, [[Endgame (Star Trek: Voyager)|"Endgame"]], is a double-length episode and the [[series finale]].

==Plot==
En route from a medical conference back to ''Voyager'', the ''Delta Flyer'' carrying Captain Janeway and the holographic Doctor is captured by Zet and Nar, members of the Hierarchy. They keep Janeway in captivity and force the Doctor to return to ''Voyager'' using disguises enabled by his holo-emitter to get the crew to turn over the warp core and several gel-paks. Zet inserts programming into the Doctor's program to allow them to directly monitor and communicate with him. As the Doctor leaves, Janeway begins to talk with Nar in secret away from Zet, hoping to gain his trust.

The Doctor, disguised as Janeway, returns along in the ''Delta Flyer'' and creates a fake transmission from a race called the R'Kaal; the R'Kaal transmission describes the area of space they are in as highly unstable to warp fields, and demand ''Voyager'' turn over the warp core, while allowing the crew to settle on a nearby class-M planet. The Doctor — as Janeway — has the ''Delta Flyer'' modified to be able to tractor the warp core away should it become unstable. The crew are uneasy at Janeway's willingness to give over the core so easily, forcing the Doctor to try to hide his tracks, including sedating Chakotay and Kim when they come too close to discovering his identity.

Eventually, Tuvok succeeds in discovering the Doctor's deception, and goes to the Sick Bay to stop him. They find the Doctor listening to "[[The Blue Danube]]", which the Doctor has been using to mask his communications to Zet from the ship's internal sensors. The Doctor flees via hologram, triggers the ejection of the warp core, and escapes with it via the modified ''Delta Flyer'', leaving no trail that the crew can follow. Shortly afterwards, all the computer systems across the ship begin playing "The Blue Danube", and Seven of Nine recognizes that some of the notes are not correct. They discover the Doctor secretly left a coded message within the recording, and use it to find a warp signature that they can trace. Tuvok and Paris leave in a separate shuttle to follow it.

The Doctor returns to the Hierarchy fleet, and is recaptured despite Janeway's orders to not give over the warp core. With the mission considered a success, Zet decides to use the Doctor to similarly infiltrate the Hierarchy's command structure as to gain valuable information and begins to program the Doctor with a Hierarchy holo-profile; the nature of the profile causes the Doctor's matrix to begin to destabilize. Just then, Tuvok and Paris arrive and begin firing on Zet's ship. Zet tries to eject the warp core with the intent of destroying it, and the ''Voyager'' shuttle, but the Doctor struggles with Zet to prevent him from firing upon it. In the meantime Janeway succeeds in beaming out the warp core to where Tom Paris in the ''Delta Flyer'' could tractor it back to ''Voyager''. Zet orders Nar to help him fend off the Doctor but Nar, now seeing Zet's recklessness, helps the Doctor to subdue Zet.

With Nar's help, Janeway, the Doctor, and the warp core are recovered and they return quickly to ''Voyager'' to help fix the Doctor's destabilizing program. Though the Doctor bemoans that he will soon die, Torres is able to fix his matrix. The Doctor isolates himself in the Sick Bay for a week, believing that the crew will come to hate him for his deception. Janeway visits him and tells him that no one has any ill will towards him, and invites him for coffee at the holodeck.

[[Image:Love in a Tub.png|thumb|Refinement meets burlesque in Restoration comedy. In this scene from [[George Etherege]]'s ''Love in a Tub'', musicians and well-bred ladies surround a man who is wearing a tub because he has lost his trousers.]]

"'''Restoration comedy'''" is English [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]] written and performed in the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] period from 1660 to 1710. [[Comedy of manners]] is used as a synonym of Restoration comedy.&lt;ref&gt;George Henry Nettleton, Arthur [https://books.google.com/books?id=TD8xG2Jnc10C&amp;pg=PA149 ''British dramatists from Dryden to Sheridan''] p.149&lt;/ref&gt; After public stage performances had been banned for 18 years by the [[Puritan]] regime, the re-opening of the theatres in 1660 signalled a renaissance of [[English drama]].&lt;ref&gt;see also [[Antitheatricality]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Sexually explicit language was encouraged by  [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] (1660–1685) personally and by the rakish style of his court. Historian [[George Norman Clark]] argues:

{{quote|The best-known fact about the Restoration drama is that it is immoral. The dramatists did not criticize the accepted morality about gambling, drink, love, and pleasure generally, or try, like the dramatists of our own time, to work out their own view of character and conduct. What they did was, according to their respective inclinations, to mock at all restraints. Some were gross, others delicately improper....The dramatists did not merely say anything they liked: they also intended to glory in it and to shock those who did not like it.&lt;ref&gt;George Clark, ''The Later Stuarts, 1660-1714'' (1956) p 369.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The socially diverse audiences included both aristocrats, their servants and hangers-on, and a substantial middle-class segment. These playgoers were attracted to the comedies by up-to-the-minute topical writing, by crowded and bustling plots, by the introduction of the first professional actresses, and by the rise of the first celebrity actors. This period saw the first professional female playwright, [[Aphra Behn]].

==Theatre companies==

===Original patent companies, 1660–1682===
[[Image:Settle-Morocco.png|thumb|The sumptuously decorated Dorset Gardens playhouse in 1673, with one of the sets for [[Elkannah Settle]]'s ''The Empress of Morocco''. The [[thrust stage|apron stage]] at the front which allowed intimate audience contact is not visible in the picture (the artist is standing on it).]] Charles II was an active and interested patron of the drama. Soon after his restoration, in 1660, he granted exclusive play-staging rights, so-called [[letters patent|Royal patents]], to the [[King's Company]] and the [[Duke's Company]], led by two middle-aged [[Charles I of England|Caroline]] playwrights, [[Thomas Killigrew]] and [[William Davenant]]. The patentees scrambled for performance rights to the previous generation's [[James I of England|Jacobean]] and Caroline plays, which were the first necessity for economic survival before any new plays existed. Their next priority was to build new, splendid [[patent theatre]]s in [[Drury Lane]] and [[Dorset Gardens]], respectively. Striving to outdo each other in magnificence, Killigrew and Davenant ended up with quite similar theatres, both designed by [[Christopher Wren]], both optimally provided for music and dancing, and both fitted with moveable scenery and elaborate machines for thunder, lightning, and waves.&lt;ref&gt;Hume, 19–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dramatists of the Restoration renounced the tradition of satire, as recently embodied by [[Ben Jonson]], and devoted themselves to the [[comedy of manners]], which uncritically accepted the social code of the upper class.&lt;ref name="Hodgart2009p194"&gt;Hodgart (2009) [https://books.google.com/books?id=dGrCooK63TsC&amp;pg=PA194 pp.194, 189]&lt;/ref&gt;

The audience of the early Restoration period was not exclusively [[noble court|courtly]], as has sometimes been supposed, but it was quite small and could barely support two companies. There was no untapped reserve of occasional playgoers. Ten consecutive performances constituted a smash hit. This closed system forced playwrights to be extremely responsive to popular taste. Fashions in the drama would change almost week by week rather than season by season, as each company responded to the offerings of the other, and new plays were urgently sought. The King's Company and the Duke's Company vied with one another for audience favour, for popular actors, and for new plays, and in this hectic climate the new [[genre]]s of [[heroic drama]], [[she-tragedy|pathetic drama]], and Restoration comedy were born and flourished.&lt;ref&gt;Hume, 17, 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Company, 1682–1695===
Both the quantity and quality of the drama suffered when in 1682 the more successful Duke's Company absorbed the struggling King's Company, and the amalgamated ''United Company'' was formed. The production of new plays dropped off sharply in the 1680s, affected by both the monopoly and the political situation (see [[Restoration comedy#Decline of comedy, 1678–90|Decline of comedy]] below). The influence and the incomes of the actors dropped, too.&lt;ref&gt;Milhous, 38–48.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 80s, predatory investors ("Adventurers") converged on the United Company, while management was taken over by the lawyer [[Christopher Rich (theatre manager)|Christopher Rich]]. Rich attempted to finance a tangle of "farmed" shares and sleeping partners by slashing salaries and, dangerously, by abolishing the traditional perks of senior performers, who were stars with the clout to fight back.&lt;ref&gt;Milhous, 51–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

===War of the theatres, 1695–1700===
The company owners, wrote the young United Company employee [[Colley Cibber]], "who had made a monopoly of the stage, and consequently presum'd they might impose what conditions they pleased upon their people, did not consider that they were all this while endeavouring to enslave a set of actors whom the public were inclined to support."&lt;ref&gt;Milhous, 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Performers like the legendary [[Thomas Betterton]], the tragedienne [[Elizabeth Barry]], and the rising young comedian [[Anne Bracegirdle]] had the audience on their side and, in the confidence of this, they walked out.&lt;ref&gt;Milhous, 68–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

The actors gained a Royal "licence to perform", thus bypassing Rich's ownership of both the original Duke's and King's Company patents from 1660, and formed their own cooperative company. This unique venture was set up with detailed rules for avoiding arbitrary managerial authority, regulating the ten actors' shares, the conditions of salaried employees, and the sickness and retirement benefits of both categories. The cooperative had the good luck to open in 1695 with the première of [[William Congreve (playwright)|William Congreve]]'s famous ''Love For Love'' and the skill to make it a huge box-office success.&lt;ref&gt;Milhous, 52–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

London again had two competing companies. Their dash to attract audiences briefly revitalised Restoration drama, but also set it on a fatal downhill slope to the lowest common denominator of public taste. Rich's company notoriously offered [[Bartholomew Fair]]-type attractions – high kickers, jugglers, ropedancers, performing animals – while the co-operating actors, even as they appealed to snobbery by setting themselves up as the only legitimate theatre company in London, were not above retaliating with "prologues recited by boys of five, and epilogues declaimed by ladies on horseback".&lt;ref&gt;Dobrée, xxi.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Actors==
===First actresses===
[[File:Nell gwyn peter lely c 1675.jpg|thumb|[[Nell Gwynn]] was one of the first actresses and the mistress of Charles II.]]
Restoration comedy was strongly influenced by the introduction of the first professional actresses. Before [[London theatre closure 1642|the closing of the theatres]], all female roles had been taken by [[boy player]]s, and the predominantly male audiences of the 1660s and 1670s were curious, censorious, and delighted at the novelty of seeing real women engage in risqué repartee and take part in physical seduction scenes. [[Samuel Pepys]] refers many times in his famous diary to visiting the playhouse to watch or re-watch the performance of particular actresses, and to how much he enjoys these experiences.

Daringly suggestive comedy scenes involving women became especially common, although of course Restoration actresses were, just like male actors, expected to do justice to all kinds and moods of plays. (Their role in the development of Restoration tragedy is also important, compare [[She-tragedy]].)

A new speciality introduced almost as early as the actresses was the [[breeches role]], which called for an actress to appear in male clothes (breeches being tight-fitting knee-length pants, the standard male garment of the time), for instance to play a witty heroine who disguises herself as a boy to hide, or to engage in escapades disallowed to girls. A quarter of the plays produced on the London stage between 1660 and 1700 contained breeches roles. Playing these [[cross-dressing]] roles, women behaved with the freedom society allowed to men, and some feminist critics, such as Jacqueline Pearson, regard them as subversive of conventional [[gender roles]] and empowering for female members of the audience. Elizabeth Howe has objected that the male disguise, when studied in relation to playtexts, prologues, and epilogues, comes out as "little more than yet another means of displaying the actress as a sexual object" to male patrons, by showing off her body, normally hidden by a skirt, outlined by the male outfit.&lt;ref&gt;see also [[Antitheatricality#Restoration theatre]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Successful Restoration actresses included Charles II's mistress [[Nell Gwyn]], the tragedienne [[Elizabeth Barry]] who was famous for her ability to "move the passions" and make whole audiences cry, the 1690s comedian [[Anne Bracegirdle]], and Susanna Mountfort (a.k.a. [[Susanna Verbruggen]]), who had many breeches roles written especially for her in the 1680s and 90s. Letters and memoirs of the period show that both men and women in the audience greatly relished Mountfort's swaggering, roistering impersonations of young women wearing breeches and thereby enjoying the social and sexual freedom of the male [[Rake (character)|Restoration rake]].

===First celebrity actors===
[[Image:Thomas Betterton.gif|thumb|upright|[[Thomas Betterton]] played the irresistible Dorimant in [[George Etherege]]'s ''[[Man of Mode]].'' Betterton's acting ability was praised by [[Samuel Pepys]], [[Alexander Pope]], and [[Colley Cibber]].]]
During the Restoration period, both male and female actors on the London stage became for the first time public personalities and [[celebrity|celebrities]]. Documents of the period show audiences being attracted to performances by the talents of particular actors as much as by particular plays, and more than by authors (who seem to have been the least important draw, no performance being advertised by author until 1699). Although the playhouses were built for large audiences—the second Drury Lane theatre from 1674 held 2000 patrons – they were of compact design, and an actor's charisma could be intimately projected from the [[thrust stage]].

With two companies competing for their services from 1660 to 1682, star actors were able to negotiate star deals, comprising company shares and [[Benefit concert|benefit nights]] as well as salaries. This advantageous situation changed when the two companies were amalgamated in 1682, but the way the actors rebelled and took command of a new company in 1695 is in itself an illustration of how far their status and power had developed since 1660.

The greatest fixed stars among Restoration actors were Elizabeth Barry ("Famous Mrs Barry" who "forc 'd Tears from the Eyes of her Auditory") and [[Thomas Betterton]], both of them active in organising the actors' revolt in 1695 and both original patent-holders in the resulting actors' cooperative.

Betterton played every great male part there was from 1660 into the 18th century. After watching ''[[Hamlet]]'' in 1661, Samuel Pepys reports in his diary that the young beginner Betterton "did the prince's part beyond imagination." Betterton's expressive performances seem to have attracted playgoers as magnetically as did the novelty of seeing women on the stage. He was soon established as the leading man of the Duke's Company, and played Dorimant, the seminal irresistible [[Rake (character)|Restoration rake]], at the première of [[George Etherege]]'s ''Man of Mode'' (1676). Betterton's position remained unassailable through the 1680s, both as the leading man of the United Company and as its stage manager and ''de facto'' day-to-day leader. He remained loyal to Rich longer than many of his co-workers, but eventually it was he who headed the actors' walkout in 1695, and who became the acting manager of the new company.

==Comedies==
Variety and dizzying fashion changes are typical of Restoration comedy. Even though the "Restoration drama" unit taught to college students is likely to be telescoped in a way that makes the plays all sound contemporary, scholars now have a strong sense of the rapid evolution of English drama over these forty years and of its social and political causes. The influence of theatre company competition and playhouse economics is also acknowledged.

[[File:John Lacy by John Michael Wright 1668-70.png|thumb|upright|[[John Lacy (playwright)|John Lacy]] was the favourite comic of King Charles II.]]
Restoration comedy peaked twice. The genre came to spectacular maturity in the mid-1670s with an extravaganza of [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] comedies. Twenty lean years followed this short golden age, although the achievement of [[Aphra Behn]] in the 1680s is to be noted. In the mid-1690s a brief second Restoration comedy renaissance arose, aimed at a wider audience. The comedies of the golden 1670s and 1690s peak times are extremely different from each other. An attempt is made below to illustrate the generational taste shift by describing ''The Country Wife'' (1675) and ''The Provoked Wife'' (1697) in some detail. These two plays differ from each other in some typical ways, just as a Hollywood movie of the 1950s differs from one of the 1970s. The plays are not, however, offered as being "typical" of their decades. Indeed, there exist no typical comedies of the 1670s or the 1690s; even within these two short peak-times, comedy types kept mutating and multiplying.

===Aristocratic comedy, 1660–1680===
The drama of the 1660s and 1670s was vitalised by the competition between the two patent companies created at the Restoration, as well as by the personal interest of Charles II, and the comic playwrights rose to the demand for new plays. They stole freely from the contemporary French and Spanish stage, from English [[James I of England|Jacobean]] and [[Charles I of England|Caroline]] plays, and even from [[Greek theatre|Greek]] and [[Theatre of ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Classics|classical]] comedies, and combined the looted plotlines in adventurous ways. Resulting differences of tone in a single play were appreciated rather than frowned on, as the audience prized "variety" within as well as between plays. Early Restoration audiences had little enthusiasm for structurally simple, well-shaped comedies such as those of [[Molière]]; they demanded bustling, crowded multi-plot action and fast pace. Even a splash of high heroic drama might be thrown in to enrich the comedy mix, as in [[George Etherege]]'s ''Love in a Tub'' (1664), which has one heroic verse "conflict between love and friendship" plot, one urbane wit comedy plot, and one burlesque pantsing plot. (''See illustration, top right''.) Such incongruities contributed to Restoration comedy being held in low esteem in the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries, but today the early Restoration total theatre experience is again valued on the stage, as well as by [[postmodern]] academic critics.

The unsentimental or "hard" comedies of [[John Dryden]], [[William Wycherley]], and [[George Etherege]] reflected the atmosphere at Court, and celebrated with frankness an aristocratic [[machismo|macho]] lifestyle of unremitting sexual intrigue and conquest. The [[John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester|Earl of Rochester]], real-life Restoration rake, courtier and poet, is flatteringly portrayed in Etherege's ''[[The Man of Mode]]'' (1676) as a riotous, witty, intellectual, and sexually irresistible aristocrat, a template for posterity's idea of the glamorous Restoration rake (actually never a very common character in Restoration comedy). Wycherley's ''[[The Plain Dealer (play)|The Plain Dealer]]'' (1676), a variation on the theme of [[Molière]]'s ''[[Le Misanthrope]]'', was highly regarded for its uncompromising satire and earned Wycherley the appellation "Plain Dealer" Wycherley or "Manly" Wycherley, after the play's main character Manly. The single play that does most to support the charge of [[obscenity]] levelled then and now at Restoration comedy is probably Wycherley's ''[[The Country Wife]]'' (1675). [[Image:William Wycherley.png|thumb|[[William Wycherley]], ''[[The Country Wife]]'': "O Lord, I'll have some china too. Good Master Horner, don't think to give other people china, and me none. Come in with me too."]]

====Example. William Wycherley, ''The Country Wife'' (1675)====
''[[The Country Wife]]'' has three interlinked but distinct plots, which each project sharply different moods:

1. Horner's [[impotence]] trick provides the main plot and the play's organising principle. The upper-class town rake Horner mounts a campaign for seducing as many respectable ladies as possible, first spreading a false rumour of his own impotence, to be allowed where no complete man may go. The trick is a great success and Horner has sex with many married ladies of virtuous reputation, whose husbands are happy to leave him alone with them. In one famously outrageous scene, the "China scene", sexual intercourse is assumed to take place repeatedly just off stage, where Horner and his mistresses carry on a sustained [[double entendre]] [[dialogue]] purportedly about Horner's china collection. ''The Country Wife'' is driven by a succession of near-discoveries of the truth about Horner's sexual prowess (and thus the truth about the respectable ladies), from which he extricates himself by quick thinking and good luck. Horner never becomes a reformed character, but keeps his secret to the end and is assumed to go on merrily reaping the fruits of his planted misinformation, past the last act and beyond.

2. The married life of Pinchwife and Margery is based on Molière's ''[[School for Wives]]''. Pinchwife is a middle-aged man who has married an ignorant young country girl in the hope that she will not know to cuckold him. However, Horner teaches her, and Margery cuts a swathe through the sophistications of London marriage without even noticing them. She is enthusiastic about the virile handsomeness of town gallants, rakes, and especially theatre actors (such self-referential stage jokes were nourished by the new higher status of actors), and keeps Pinchwife in a state of continual horror with her plain-spokenness and her interest in sex. A running joke is the way Pinchwife's [[pathological jealousy]] always leads him into supplying Margery with the very type of information he wishes her not to have.

3. The courtship of Harcourt and Alithea is a comparatively uplifting love story in which the [[wit]]ty Harcourt wins the hand of Pinchwife's sister Alithea from the hands of the Upper-class town snob Sparkish, to whom she was engaged until discovering he loved her only for her money.

===Decline of comedy, 1678–1690===
When the two companies were amalgamated in 1682 and the London stage became a monopoly, both the number and the variety of new plays being written dropped sharply. There was a swing away from comedy to serious political drama, reflecting preoccupations and divisions following on the [[Popish Plot]] (1678) and the [[Exclusion Crisis]] (1682). The few comedies produced also tended to be political in focus, the [[British Whig Party|Whig]] dramatist [[Thomas Shadwell]] sparring with the [[Tory|Tories]] [[John Dryden]] and [[Aphra Behn]]. Behn's unique achievement as an early professional woman writer has been the subject of much recent study.

===Comedy renaissance, 1690–1700===
During the second wave of Restoration comedy in the 1690s, the "softer" comedies of [[William Congreve (playwright)|William Congreve]] and [[John Vanbrugh]] reflected mutating cultural perceptions and great social change. The playwrights of the 1690s set out to appeal to more socially mixed audiences with a strong middle-class element, and to female spectators, for instance by moving the war between the sexes from the arena of intrigue into that of marriage. The focus in comedy is less on young lovers outwitting the older generation, more on marital relations after the wedding bells. [[Thomas Southerne]]'s dark ''[[The Wives' Excuse]]'' (1691) is not yet very "soft": it shows a woman miserably married to the [[fop]] Friendall, everybody's friend, whose follies and indiscretions undermine her social worth, since her honour is bound up in his. Mrs Friendall is pursued by a would-be lover, a matter-of-fact rake devoid of all the qualities that made Etherege's Dorimant charming, and she is kept from action and choice by the unattractiveness of all her options. All the humour of this "comedy" is in the subsidiary love-chase and fornication plots, none in the main plot.

In Congreve's ''[[Love for Love]]'' (1695) and ''[[The Way of the World]]'' (1700), the  "wit duels" between lovers typical of 1670s comedy are underplayed. The give-and-take set pieces of couples still testing their attraction for each other have mutated into witty prenuptial debates on the eve of marriage, as in the famous "Proviso" scene in ''The Way of the World'' (1700). Vanbrugh's ''[[The Provoked Wife]]'' (1697) follows in the footsteps of Southerne's ''Wives' Excuse'', with a lighter touch and more humanly recognisable characters.

====Example. John Vanbrugh, ''The Provoked Wife'' (1697)====
[[Image:John Vanbrugh.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Vanbrugh]], ''[[The Provoked Wife]]'': "These are good times. A woman may have a gallant and a separate maintenance too."]]
''The Provoked Wife'' is something of a Restoration [[problem play]] in its attention to the subordinate legal position of married women and the complexities of "divorce" and separation, issues that had been highlighted in the mid-1690s by some notorious cases before the [[House of Lords]] (see Stone).

Sir John Brute in ''The Provoked Wife'' is tired of matrimony. He comes home drunk every night and is continually rude and insulting to his wife. She is meanwhile being tempted to embark upon an affair with the witty and faithful Constant. Divorce is not an option for either of the Brutes at this time, but forms of legal separation have recently come into existence, and would entail a separate maintenance to the wife. Such an arrangement would not allow remarriage. Still, muses Lady Brute, in one of many discussions with her niece Bellinda, "These are good times. A woman may have a gallant and a separate maintenance too."

Bellinda is at the same time being grumpily courted by Constant's friend Heartfree, who is surprised and dismayed to find himself in love with her. The bad example of the Brutes is a constant warning to Heartfree to not marry.

''The Provoked Wife'' is a talk play, with the focus less on love scenes and more on discussions between female friends (Lady Brute and Bellinda) and male friends (Constant and Heartfree). These exchanges are full of jokes, but are also thoughtful and have a dimension of melancholy and frustration.

After a forged-letter complication, the play ends with marriage between Heartfree and Bellinda and stalemate between the Brutes. Constant continues to pay court to Lady Brute, and she continues to shilly-shally.

===End of comedy===
The tolerance for Restoration comedy even in its modified form was running out at the end of the 17th century, as public opinion turned to respectability and seriousness even faster than the playwrights did. Interconnected causes for this shift in taste were [[demographic]] change, the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, [[William III of England|William]]'s and [[Mary II of England|Mary]]'s dislike of the theatre, and the lawsuits brought against playwrights by the [[Society for the Reformation of Manners]] (founded in 1692). When [[Jeremy Collier]] attacked Congreve and Vanbrugh in his ''[[Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage]]'' in 1698, he was confirming a shift in audience taste that had already taken place. At the much-anticipated all-star première in 1700 of ''The Way of the World'', Congreve's first comedy for five years, the audience showed only moderate enthusiasm for that subtle and almost melancholy work. The comedy of sex and wit was about to be replaced by the drama of obvious sentiment and exemplary morality.

==After Restoration comedy==
===Stage history===
During the 18th and 19th centuries, the sexual frankness of Restoration comedy ensured that theatre producers cannibalised it or adapted it with a heavy hand, rather than actually performed it. Today, Restoration comedy is again appreciated on the stage. The classics, Wycherley's ''The Country Wife'' and ''The Plain-Dealer'', Etherege's ''The Man of Mode'', and Congreve's ''Love For Love'' and ''The Way of the World''  have competition not only from Vanbrugh's ''The Relapse'' and ''The Provoked Wife'', but from such dark, unfunny comedies as [[Thomas Southerne]]'s ''The Wives Excuse''. Aphra Behn, once considered unstageable, has had a major renaissance, with ''The Rover'' now a repertory favourite.

===Literary criticism===
Distaste for sexual impropriety long kept Restoration comedy not only off the stage but also locked in a critical poison cupboard. Victorian critics like [[William Hazlitt]], although valuing the linguistic energy and "strength" of the [[wiktionary:canon|canonical]] writers Etherege, Wycherley, and Congreve, always found it necessary to temper aesthetic praise with heavy moral condemnation. Aphra Behn received the condemnation without the praise, since outspoken sex comedy was considered particularly offensive coming from a woman author. At the turn of the 20th century, an embattled minority of academic Restoration comedy enthusiasts began to appear, for example the important editor [[Montague Summers]], whose work ensured that the plays of Aphra Behn remained in print.

"Critics remain astonishingly defensive about the masterpieces of this period", wrote Robert D. Hume as late as 1976. It is only over the last few decades that that statement has become untrue, as Restoration comedy has been acknowledged a rewarding subject for high theory analysis and Wycherley's ''[[The Country Wife]]'', long branded the most obscene play in the English language, has become something of an academic favourite. "Minor" comic writers are getting a fair share of attention, especially the post-Aphra Behn generation of women playwrights which appeared just around the turn of the 18th century: [[Delarivier Manley]], [[Mary Pix]], [[Catharine Trotter]], and [[Susannah Centlivre]]. A broad study of the majority of never-reprinted Restoration comedies has been made possible by Internet access (by subscription only) to the first editions at the [[British Library]].

'''''Shade: Wrath of Angels''''' is a 2004 video game for [[Microsoft Windows]], developed by [[Black Element Software]] and published by [[Cenega]]. The original name was ''Nefandus'', but later was changed to ''Shade: Wrath of Angels'' before its release. The history revolves around an ancient war between [[angel]]s and [[god]]s.

==Gameplay==
''Shade: Wrath of Angels'' is a third-person RPG with over 30 hours of gameplay. The game consists of action/adventure elements with hidden secrets and twists.
The game includes four different chapters traveling through different times and dimensions.
There are 30 different levels with a tutorial included. The player has the ability to wield both weapons or cast spells on 20 different types of enemies. The player also holds the ability to transform into a demon over a limited period  of time. The player can upgrade his health and magic charm by collecting the golden drops, which are available throughout the game.

==Plot==
The plot revolves around the player receiving an invitation from his brother 'B'. In his letter, 'B' has claimed to have discovered an important archaeological site, which appears to be a very primitive one. But on reaching the town, the player is amazed to find out that all its residents are missing. He reaches the Hotel where his brother has written to be boarded. But on reaching the Hotel, he finds nothing but a pistol left by his brother for him. He decides to check the Church but on his way downstairs, he is stunned to see a zombie, in the lobby. He however shoots the zombie and goes to the Church, only to encounter two more zombies therein. After dealing with them, he finds a secret passage and moves into it to descend down and finds an orb. After the player comes out of the room with the orb, a misty figure appears and reveals to him a fearful secret. The figure reveals to the player that she is the Angel of Faith, and the orb he is carrying is her heart. The Angel of Faith asks the player to release the three other angels to bring his brother back. When the player agrees, the Angel gives him her loyal servant, an immortal red demon to help him on his quest. The player is teleported by the Angel to each of the three worlds where the pieces of the hearts of the other three angels are kept, the first being in the world of undead knights (themed on a medieval period with walking dead, the zombies and undead knights), the second being in the Pyramid of Egyptian God Seth (themed on pyramids, with living statues, mummies and undead worshippers of mighty Seth) and the third being in the world of eternal darkness, the 'Shadowland' (themed on a shadowy plain with creatures of darkness everywhere). But on collecting the three hearts of the angels and reunifying them, the Angel of Faith reappears and reveals her true horrifying form. She turns out to be the Dark Angel, who opposed the Gods and set the war between the four worlds. The player vows to stop the evil by breaking all the hearts of the angels, but the other three noble angels appear and ask the player to destroy the demon, who helped him on his quests. The player kills the demon with his magic sword, and the noble angels trap the Angel of Faith. The angels then reveal to him that his brother's soul is sealed and can not be made to live again. The angels then transform the player to an immensely powerful guardian, to protect all the four hearts of the angels with his magic sword till the end of time, or (if you charged the sword with power, instead of the demon, during the middle of the game) the main character will wake up in the train and his brother is seen on the railway platform.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9073">'''Shinjuku Ni-chōme''' (新宿二丁目), referred to colloquially as ''' Ni-chōme''' or simply '''Nichō''', is Area 2 in the Shinjuku District of the [[Shinjuku|Shinjuku Special Ward]] of [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]. With Tokyo home to 13 million people, and Shinjuku known as the noisiest and most crowded of its 23 [[special ward]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Sandra Buckley, ed., Encyclopedia of Contemporary Japanese Culture (New York: Routledge, 2002), 165, 409, 453-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Ni-chōme further distinguishes itself as Tokyo's hub of gay [[subculture]], housing the world's highest concentration of [[gay bar]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Mc Lelland, Ktsuhiko Suganuma, and James Welker, Queer Voices from Japan: First-Person Narratives from Japan’s Sexual Minorities (Maryland: Lexington Books, 2007), 248, 262, 320-323.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within close walking distance from three train stations (Shinjuku San-chōme Station, Shinjuku Gyoenmae Station, and Japan's busiest train station, [[Shinjuku Station]]),&lt;ref&gt;Beth Reiber, Frommer’s Tokyo, 6th ed. (Chicago: IDG Books Worldwide, Inc., 2000), 37, 212.&lt;/ref&gt; the Shinjuku Ni-chōme neighborhood provides a specialized blend of bars, restaurants, cafes, [[sauna]]s, [[love hotel]]s, [[gay pride]] boutiques, [[Cruising for sex|cruising]] boxes ([[hattenba]]), [[host club]]s, [[nightclub]]s, [[massage parlor]]s, parks, and gay book and video stores. In fact within the five blocks centering on street Naka-Dōri between the BYGS building at the Shinjuku San-chōme Station and the small Shinjuku park three blocks to the east, an estimated 300 [[gay bar]]s and [[nightclub]]s provide entertainment.&lt;ref name="search.japantimes.co.jp"&gt;McNeill, David, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20100224f1.html Shinjuku gay enclave in decline but not on the surface]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', February 24, 2010, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The history of Ni-chōme as a [[gay village|gay neighborhood]] generally begins around the time of the American [[Occupation of Japan]] (1945-1952) and ties strongly to the fall of its [[red-light district]]s ([[akasen]]).&lt;ref name="Bonnie Zimmerman 2000"&gt;Bonnie Zimmerman, ed., ''Lesbian Histories and Cultures: An Encyclopedia'' (New York: Garland, 2000), 412.&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1948, there is mention of a gay Shinjuku tea shop, and by the 1950s [[gay bar]]s publicly emerged both in name and form in Ni-chōme.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory M. Pflugfelder, ''Cartographies of Desire: Male-male Sexuality in Japanese Discourse, 1600-1950'' (London: University of California, 1959).&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 1957, Tokyo’s red-light districts had flourished as legally-licensed centers for [[sex worker]]s but, armed with a new [[Constitution of Japan|constitution]] and an Equal Rights amendment, post-occupation Japanese women's Christian groups and the like successfully lobbied the [[Diet of Japan|Diet]] to pass the Prostitution Prevention Law in 1956.&lt;ref name="Bonnie Zimmerman 2000"/&gt; For the first time, [[prostitution in Japan]] became illegal.&lt;ref&gt;Sandra Buckley, ed., ''Encyclopedia of Contemporary Japanese Culture'' (New York: Routledge, 2002), 165, 409, 453-4.&lt;/ref&gt; As the traditional sex industry left Ni-chōme, a gay subculture began to fill its place.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Bornoff, ''Pink Samurai: Love, Marriage, and Sex in Contemporary Japan'' (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1991), 219, 423.&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1950s Ni-chōme was known for its popularity in the gay subculture, and a club scene began to emerge.

More recent years have seen the establishment of a counseling room for young gay men in 1976, the first AIDS candlelight vigil in 1986, the 1992 inauguration of [http://www.tokyo-lgff.org/e Tokyo’s annual International Lesbian and Gay Film Festival], Japan’s first lesbian and [[gay pride parade]] in 1994, and the founding of its first gay community center, [https://web.archive.org/web/20081219003242/http://www.rainbowring.org/akta/ AKTA]. Today Shinjuku Ni-chōme continues to provide a home base for many milestones in the history of Japan’s [[LGBT]] community.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Mc Lelland, Katsuhiko Suganuma, and James Welker, ''Queer Voices from Japan: First-Person Narratives from Japan’s Sexual Minorities'' (Maryland: Lexington Books, 2007), 248, 262, 320-323.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Japan Times]]'' reported in February 2010 that the area was in decline, with the number of gay-oriented clubs and bars having declined by one-third.  The decline was attributed to the construction of the nearby [[Tokyo Metro Fukutoshin Line]], which has pushed up property values in the area, and the rise of the Internet.&lt;ref name="search.japantimes.co.jp"/&gt;

As of August 17, 2012, dancing has been banned in a number of popular clubs in Ni-chome, including Arty Farty, Annex, Arch, and Aisotope.

==Scene specialization==
The lifeblood of the gay neighborhood, the majority of Nichōme's hundreds of night clubs typically seat fewer than a dozen customers, who preferably represent a club's specialized subset of the gay subculture. In a society where traditionally most of the population was expected to marry, many [[LGBT]] Japanese choose to privately express their sexuality within the anonymity of specialty clubs in areas like Ni-chōme. To achieve this specialization, clubs are typically segregated by "scene." There are bars that cater specifically to the [[bear community]], [[BDSM]], muscular men, young men, [[butch and femme]] lesbians, etc.&lt;ref name="utopia-asia.com"&gt;http://www.utopia-asia.com/tipsjapn.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Club owners called “masters” or “[[mama-san]]s” try to attract the unique crowds that characterize their clubs, going so far as to deny service or charge additional fees to less-desired customers. For example, Nichōme nightclub [http://x23.peps.jp/baravanti Avanti] charges a ¥1000 entrance fee to women and gay men, and ¥1500 to “typical” men; club [http://www5.ocn.ne.jp/~kusuo/ Kusuo], ¥1000 to men, ¥1500 to women; and club [http://www.shinjuku-2.com/bar/mens/koimo/main.html Koimo], ¥1500 to gay men, and ¥2000 to everyone else.

While most bar owners do accommodate new and non-Japanese customers, the scene is primarily geared toward regular customers who are Japanese. Some venues discourage or prohibit non-Japanese from entering, regardless of Japanese language ability. At most bars in Shinjuku Ni-chōme, patrons sit at a counter and chat with the bartender. Karaoke is popular, and gay magazines are often available. Most bars offer a “[[bottle keep]]” (ボトルキープ) system, so many regular customers choose to keep their own bottles of liquor at their favorite bars. This loyalty is then repaid by bar-organized outings to [[onsen]], [[hanami]] parties, picnics, and gay sporting events. Bars maintain large commemorative photo albums of these outings. In contrast, a handful of establishments specifically target foreigners with English advertising. Five clubs — Advocates, Arty Farty, Dragon, GB, and Rehab — are particularly popular amongst foreign men and their admirers, but they do not offer bottle-keep services. Advocates, though very small, is especially known for large weekend crowds of natives and foreigners that spill out onto the sidewalk and adjacent street.&lt;ref name="utopia-asia.com"/&gt;

==Neighborhood events==
Although there are no gay clubs in Ni-chōme that can hold more than 100 customers, large gay events held throughout the year attract up to several thousand people to the area.

'''TVBully''' ({{zh|一台獨大}}) refers to the [[Monopoly|monopolistic]] [[Dominance (economics)|market dominance]] of [[free-to-air]] television in [[Hong Kong]]. [[TVB|Television Broadcasts Limited]] (TVB) was blamed for this monopolization and this phenomenon had been a huge challenge for the operation of TVB. ATV has also complained about TVB's monopoly abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kays-entertainment.blogspot.com/2010/09/atv-complains-monopoly-abuse-ba-to.html|title=ATV Complains Monopoly Abuse, BA to Conduct Thorough Investigation On TVB|date=2010-09-10|website=ATV Complains Monopoly Abuse, BA to Conduct Thorough Investigation On TVB ~ KAY'S ENTERTAINMENT|access-date=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term '''TVBully''' was created by Hong Kong citizens, using the name of the television station "TVB" in the beginning, adding "Bully" at the end of the term. The low quality of programmes are one of the main reasons of the complains.

== Background ==

The free-to-air television services in Hong Kong began with [[Television Broadcasts]] ([[TVB]]) in November 19, 1967. The second free-to-air broadcaster [[Asia Television]] (ATV) launched as [[Rediffusion Television]] (RTV) in December 1, 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Broadcasting Authority. (2012).''The Hong Kong Broadcasting Scene''.Retrieved November 3, 2015, from http://ba_archives.ofca.gov.hk/annual2011/03eng/scene_01history.html&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The brilliant time of the market is in the 1970s to 1980s, with the launch of the third broadcaster, [[Commercial Television]] (CTV).&lt;ref&gt;Hong Kong.Hong Kong Government.(1974).''Hong Kong 1974,Report for the year 1973(p.149)''.&lt;/ref&gt; It first went on air on September 9, 1975 but ceased transmissions on August 22, 1978 due to financial pressure.&lt;ref&gt;Hong Kong.Hong Kong Government.(1978).''Hong Kong 1977''(p.143-144)..&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, [[Asia Television|ATV]] was unable to recover from setbacks due to a variety number of internal operation problems.&lt;ref&gt;South Morning China.(2015).''ATV shareholder says only a fool would invest more in station''.Retrieved November 3, 2015, from http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1675836/atv-shareholder-says-only-fool-would-invest-more-station&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Standard.(2013).''Coach firm chases ATV over unpaid bills''.Retrieved November 3, 2015, from {{cite web |url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&amp;art_id=134781&amp;sid=39839930&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20130620&amp;isSearch=1&amp;sear_year=2013 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705183206/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&amp;art_id=134781&amp;sid=39839930&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20130620&amp;isSearch=1&amp;sear_year=2013 |archivedate=July 5, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ejinsight.(2015).''Unpaid ATV staff offered loans by top shareholder''.Retrieved November 3, 2015, from http://www.ejinsight.com/20150122-unpaid-atv-staff-offered-loans-by-top-shareholder/&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chief Executive in Council]] rejected the license renewal application of [[Asia Television|ATV]] on April 1, 2015, which the services will cease transmissions on April 1, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;News.Gov.Hk.(2015).''ATV licence not renewed''.Retrieved November 2, 2015, from http://www.news.gov.hk/en/categories/finance/html/2015/04/20150401_155912.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

The closure of CTV and having the lower hand of [[Asia Television|ATV]] probably helps [[TVB]] to gain the greatest market share for over 48 years.&lt;ref&gt;The Broadcasting Authority. (2002).''Broadcasting Services Survey 2002(section 4.6,p.7)[Data file]''.(2002).Retrieved November 2, 2015, from http://ba_archives.ofca.gov.hk/en/doc/survey_bxservices2002_e.doc&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, [[TVB]] channels captured an overall 81% audience share against all TV channels in Hong Kong during weekday primetime.&lt;ref&gt;Television Broadcasts Limited. (2015). ''TVB 2014 Annual Report(p.7)[Data file]''.Retrieved November 3, 2015, from http://img.tvb.com/corporate/_upload_/article/en/f6d973d95f4aa24cce36e351fe8eeb63.pdf
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Platinum Broking. (October 24, 2013). ''Television Broadcasts Ltd[Data file]''.Retrieved November 4, 2015, from http://www.platinum-asia.com/eng/pdf/research/2013-10-24-Television-Broadcasts-Limited.pdf
&lt;/ref&gt; According to CSM Media Research, [[TVB Pearl]] gained over 90% share in 2012 by comparing with its one and the only competitor, [[ATV World]].&lt;ref&gt;CSM Media Research.(2012).''2012 Top Ten English Programmes''. Retrieved November 4, 2015,from http://img.b.tvb.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/whatsnew/files/2013/01/top-10-english-channel-programmes-in-2012_chin-page-001.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;
                                                                                                                                              
However, in the 2010s, many Hong Kongers are unsatisfied with the current television services. Many have discontented towards the monopoly structure probably leads to deteriorate the quality of programmes of TVB, the main programmes producer in Hong Kong, which is superficial and usual, undiversified programmes choice and monopolized the resources in the [[cultural industry]]. Some netizens organized an internet concern group,&lt;ref&gt;''TV Bully No More''.(2015).Retrieved November 2, 2015, from https://www.facebook.com/TVBullyNoMore/timeline?ref=page_internal&lt;/ref&gt; which held activities to express their discontents, such as the "switch-off incident" of "[[TVB Anniversary Awards|TVB Anniversary 2013]]".

== Cause ==

The cause of monopolization of [[TVB]] has been probably found that restriction of issuing the license is the main reason resulting this phenomenon. In 1965, the [[Hong Kong Government|government]] aimed to issue one license of operating free-to-air [[analog television]] broadcasting service and six tycoon groups such as [[Shaw Brothers Studio|Shaw Brothers (HK) Ltd.]] and [[Fuji Television]] of Japan were attracted to bid.&lt;ref&gt;Broadcasting Authority.

&lt;/ref&gt; There was a great competition between [[TVB]], [[Rediffusion Television|Rediffusion]] and [[Commercial Television]] in 70s to 80s. Because of the rapid development of [[Commercial Television]] and headhunting by [[Rediffusion Television|Rediffusion]], TVB confronted with various challenges including turnover of staff and cancellation of programs. However, [[TVB]] maintained its competitive edge during the period whereas other two had declined in broadcast popularity or one of them even closed down within three years.&lt;ref&gt;''Report on the Public Consultation Exercise for the renewal of the Domestic Free Television Programme Service Licences Asia Television Limited Television Broadcasts Limited(section 11.4,p.86)''.(2015).Retrieved November 4, 2015, from http://www.coms-auth.hk/filemanager/en/content_955/Public_Report_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This situation and popularity of [[TVB]] resulted in TV viewing habit of Hong Kong citizens and the market position of [[TVB]] was difficult to be altered.&lt;ref&gt;''Report on the Public Consultation Exercise for the renewal of the Domestic Free Television Programme Service Licences Asia Television Limited Television Broadcasts Limited(section 13,p.91)''.(2015).Retrieved November 4, 2015, from http://www.coms-auth.hk/filemanager/en/content_955/Public_Report_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects ==

=== Deteriorating Quality of Programmes ===

[[TVB]] has been accused of producing programs of low quality in the recent decades.&lt;ref&gt;''Broadcasting Services Survey 2007(section 18(b),p.8)''.(2007).Retrieved November 4, 2015, from http://ba_archives.ofca.gov.hk/en/doc/BSS2007ExeSum_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In the Reports of public consultation on the services of free-to-air broadcasters released by the [[Communications Authority]] in 2015, most of the attended public reflected that the programs from [[TVB]] are being deficient in quality as a tendency and some of them are even below acceptable standard because of lacking competition.&lt;ref&gt;''Report on the Public Consultation Exercise for the Mid-term Domestic Free Television Programmes Services Licences(section 10.3)''.(2010).Retrieved November 4, 2015, from http://ba_archives.ofca.gov.hk/en/doc/report_2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; For example, some audiences discontent the mistakes, which can be easily spotted within a soap opera due to the scarce research done on the show,&lt;ref&gt;''Report on the Public Consultation Exercise for the Mid-term Domestic Free Television Programmes Services Licences(section 5.46)''.(2010).Retrieved November 4, 2015, from http://ba_archives.ofca.gov.hk/en/doc/report_2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; because [[TVB]] is not necessary to focus on programmes quality as she is the monopolist.&lt;ref&gt;''Report on the Public Consultation Exercise for the renewal of the Domestic Free Television Programme Service Licences Asia Television Limited Television Broadcasts Limited(section 6.12,p.60)''.(2015).Retrieved November 4, 2015, from http://www.coms-auth.hk/filemanager/en/content_955/Public_Report_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Also, some reflected that it is condemned to have the same background setting and actors are repeated among many different shows in which the audiences thought that TVB lacks of sincerity in terms of the use of resources.&lt;ref&gt;''Report on the Public Consultation Exercise for the Mid-term Domestic Free Television Programmes Services Licences(section 5.44)''.(2010).Retrieved November 4, 2015, from http://ba_archives.ofca.gov.hk/en/doc/report_2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, the Report stated that TVB is perceived copying the ideas from other countries instead of creating their own ones, not to mention its lack of creativity that,&lt;ref&gt;''Report on the Public Consultation Exercise for the renewal of the Domestic Free Television Programme Service Licences Asia Television Limited Television Broadcasts Limited(section 6.11, p.60)''.(2015).Retrieved November 4, 2015, from http://www.coms-auth.hk/filemanager/en/content_955/Public_Report_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, the "[[Super Trio Series]]" had been broadcast from 1995 till 2014 without changing most of the elements in the show.&lt;ref&gt;''Report on the Public Consultation Exercise for the renewal of the Domestic Free Television Programme Service Licences Asia Television Limited Television Broadcasts Limited(section 6.13,p.60)''.(2015).Retrieved November 4, 2015, from http://www.coms-auth.hk/filemanager/en/content_955/Public_Report_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a [[University of Hong Kong|HKU]] POP survey released in 2013, a slight decline is shown on the appreciation index of the TV program provided by TVB, which implies that there may be need to retain the dropping quality of the TV program.&lt;ref&gt;HKU PoP Site.(2013).''Public Opinion Programme''.Retrieved November 2, 2015, from https://www.hkupop.hku.hk/english/columns/columns154.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Affecting the Development of Hong Kong Cultural Industry ===

The monopoly power of TVB inhabits and affects the development of Hong Kong Cultural Industry such as Performing Arts Industry, Music Industry and Television Industry.  By December 2009, the [[Communications Authority]] launched an investigation into TVB after rival ATV's complaint,&lt;ref&gt;''Sections 13 and 14 of the Broadcasting Ordinance (Cap. 562) Report of the Communications Authority''.(2013).Retrieved November 3, 2015, from http://www.coms-auth.hk/filemanager/statement/en/upload/221/20130919TVB_final_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; alleging that TVB had violated the Broadcasting Ordinance.&lt;ref&gt;''Television Programme Service Licences''.(2012).Retrieved November 3, 2015, from http://ba_archives.ofca.gov.hk/en/faq/tv_licences_ans.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Report by the Communications Authority Regarding Asia Television Limited's Complaint Against Television Broadcasts Limited's Alleged Violations of the Competition Provisions of the Broadcasting Ordinance.''(2013).Retrieved November 4, 2015, from http://www.coms-auth.hk/filemanager/statement/en/upload/222/20130919TVB_summary_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; TVB was then fined HK$900,000 by the city’s communications watchdog for engaging in anti-competition practices including "harsh and unreasonable" terms in contracts with some singers and artistes, and a "No Cantonese Policy" that prohibits contract artistes from speaking Cantonese on other Hong Kong TV stations’ programmes.&lt;ref&gt;South Morning China Post.(2013).''TVB fined HK$900,000 for anti-competition practices''.Retrieved November 3, 2015, from http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1313111/tvb-fined-hk900000-anti-competition-practices&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Report on the Public Consultation Exercise for the Mid-term Domestic Free Television Programmes Services Licences(section 10.4)''.(2010).Retrieved November 4, 2015, from http://ba_archives.ofca.gov.hk/en/doc/report_2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Report on the Public Consultation Exercise for the Mid-term Domestic Free Television Programmes Services Licences(section 10.18–10.22)''.(2010).Retrieved November 4, 2015, from http://ba_archives.ofca.gov.hk/en/doc/report_2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  
    	
On June 12, 2014, the [[Communications Authority]] received [[Hong Kong Television Network]] (HKTVN)'s complaint against TVB, alleging that TVB had executed in anti-competition conduct by abusing trade mark law and procedures to prevent HKTVN from obtaining a domestic free-to-air television programme services licence ("FTV licence") in order to strengthen TVB's dominance in Hong Kong television programme service market.&lt;ref&gt;''DECISION OF THE COMMUNICATIONS AUTHORITY PRELIMINARY ENQUIRY INTO THE ALLEGED ANTI-COMPETITIVE CONDUCT OF TELEVISION BROADCASTS LIMITED IN RELATION TO THE FORECLOSURE OF HONG KONG TELEVISION NETWORK LIMITED FROM ENTERING THE TELEVISION PROGRAMME SERVICE MARKET''.(2015).Retrieved November 3, 2015, from http://www.coms-auth.hk/filemanager/statement/en/upload/341/HKTVN_TVB_Decision_20150924_e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Meanwhile, due to dominance, the quality of the product of TVB declines with times. The exporting local series production line once being hot in 70s to 80s such as [[The Kung Fu Master (TV series)|Hong Hei Gun]], was then closed down which greatly affects the development of Performing Arts Industry, Television Industry and Cultural Industry in Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;''Report on the Public Consultation Exercise for the Mid-term Domestic Free Television Programmes Services Licences(section 10.16)''.(2010).Retrieved November 4, 2015, from http://ba_archives.ofca.gov.hk/en/doc/report_2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Talking Band''' is an American [[Off-Off-Broadway]] theatre company specializing in [[experimental theatre]], based in [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]].

The company consists of a core group of artists: artistic director [[Paul Zimet]]; actor, writer and composer [[Ellen Maddow]]; and actor and director [[Tina Shepard (actor)|Tina Shepard]]. The Talking band has collaborated with numerous performers and artists including: [[Taylor Mac]], [[Louise Smith (theatre artist)|Louise Smith]], [[Marcus Gardley]], and [[Lizzie Olesker]].

The company is known for producing original works of theater that combine music, language, and choreographed movement in unconventional ways to create unique audience perspective on a wide range of subject material. Since its founding, the group has produced 46 original plays, and has performed its plays at theater venues around New York City and throughout the world.

== History ==
The group was founded in 1974 by Maddow and Shepard and Zimet, along with Sybille Hayn, Mark Samuels, Margo Lee Sherman, Charles Stanley and Arthur Strimling. It has its roots in the work of [[The Open Theatre]], where company members Maddow and Shepard and Zimet worked as core company members. The Open Theatre had been founded by director, actor and writer [[Joseph Chaikin]], and after Chaikin disbanded The Open Theatre in 1973, Maddow, Shepard and Zimet joined with the other Talking Band founding members to start the new company. Along with starting The Talking Band, Zimet, Maddow and Shepard continued to perform with Chaikin as part of his new company [[The Winter Project]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Donn.

== Productions ==
Its first production, ''The Kalevala''{{spaced ndash}}based on the [[Kalevala]], a 19th-century work of [[epic poetry]] compiled by [[Elias Lönnrot]] from [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Karelian language|Karelian]] oral [[folklore]] and [[Finnish mythology]]&lt;ref name="Overview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://finland.fi/public/default.aspx?contentid=160078&amp;contentlan=2&amp;culture=en-US|accessdate=August 15, 2010|title=Kalevala: The Finnish National Epic|author1=Asplund, Anneli |author2=Mettom, Sirkka-Liisa |date=October 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{spaced ndash}}featured music by [[Elizabeth Swados]], and used minimal staging. The piece centered on the use of actor voices and the rhythms and melodies of the language. It received critical praise from ''[[The Village Voice]]'', which said, "it is as if the almost formal sense of using the breath opens the performers to the depths of an innerness that is sometimes like Alice in its sense of wonder and sometimes like [[Dante]] in its terribleness".&lt;ref&gt;[http://talkingband.org/our-work/the-kalevala/ ''The Kalevala'' Show Page].  The Talking Band.&lt;/ref&gt;

Its productions evolved over the years, incorporating poetry, dialog, and multi-media elements, alongside music and choreographed movement. The group's pieces have focused on a wide range of subjects, from the travails of a housewife, to [[Christianity]] and [[nuclear disarmament]].

The group has been regularly praised by critics for its creative and innovative productions. ''[[American Theatre (magazine)|American Theatre]]'' referred to it as "...one of the most exceptional but unsung theatre companies in the country".&lt;ref&gt;(October 2008).  "Falling Light".  ''[[American Theatre (magazine)|American Theatre]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 four playwrights wrote a serial play, ''The Necklace'', based on themes and structures that they would develop over a year's time. [[Ellen Maddow]], in an interview in ''[[The Brooklyn Rail]]'', says of the experience: "I’ve worked in collaborative theatre all my life but to work collaboratively with other playwrights is something unusual. It’s a kind of tug and pull of four different peoples minds and ways of thinking. And the ways you are pushed in a certain direction by someone else’s aesthetic is very interesting."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Babb|first=Roger|title=In Dialogue: Talking Band’s The Necklace: A serial mystery in eight episodes|journal=The Brooklyn Rail|date=May 2006|url=http://brooklynrail.org/2006/05/theater/talking-bands-the-necklace-a-serial-mystery-in-eight-episodes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{other uses2|Time Machine}}
'''''Time Machine''''' is a series of children's novels published in the United States by [[Bantam Books]] from 1984 to 1989, similar to their more successful ''[[Choose Your Own Adventure]]'' line of "[[interactive]]" novels. Each book was written in the [[second-person narrative|second person]], with the reader choosing how the story should progress. They were designed by [[Byron Preiss Visual Publications]]. 

The main difference between the ''Choose Your Own Adventure'' series and the ''Time Machine'' series was that ''Time Machine'' books featured only one ending, forcing the reader to try many different choices until they discovered it. Also, the series taught children basic history about many diverse subjects, from [[dinosaur]]s to [[World War II]]. Only the sixth book in the series, ''The Rings of Saturn'', departed from actual history; it is set in the future, and features educational content about the solar system. Some books gave the reader their choice from a small list of equipment at the beginning, and this choice would affect events later in the book (e.g. "If you brought the pen knife, turn to page 52, if not turn to page 45.&lt;ref&gt;Mueller, Richard; ''World War I Flying Ace'' (''Time Machine'', No. 24); page 32&lt;/ref&gt;"). Another main difference between the ''Time Machine'' novels and the ''Choose Your Own Adventure'' counterparts was hints offered at certain junctures, where the reader was advised to look at hints at the back of the book. An example was in ''Mission to World War II'' about the [[Warsaw Ghetto]] uprising, where the reader was given the choice of starting the mission in the Jewish ghetto or the Aryan part of Warsaw, in which the hint read "Hitler may have had Jewish family members", suggesting the reader should begin in the Jewish section of the city, but not ordering it, or it was possible for the hint to be missed.

The line spawned a brief spin-off series for younger readers,  the ''[[Time Traveler (novel series)|Time Traveler]]'' novels.

'''1&amp;nbsp;inch type B''' [[VTR]] (designated Type B by [[Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers|SMPTE]]) is a [[reel-to-reel]] [[analog recording]] [[video tape]] format developed by the Bosch [[Fernseh]] division of [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] in Germany in 1976. The [[magnetic tape]] format became the broadcasting standard in continental Europe, but adoption was limited in the United States and United Kingdom, where the [[Type C videotape]] VTR was met with greater success.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journal.smpte.org/content/90/5/385.full.pdf SMPTE Motion Imaging Journal page 289-299, 1981]&lt;/ref&gt;

The tape speed allowed 96 minutes on a large reel (later 120 minutes), and used 2 record/playback (R/P) heads on the drum rotating at 9000 RPM with a 190 degree wrap around a very small head drum, recording 52 video lines per head segment.  Video is recorded on an FM signal with a bandwidth of 5.5&amp;nbsp;MHz. Three longitudinal audio tracks are recorded on the tape as well: two audio and one [[Linear timecode]] (LTC) track.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7WrCSCqMk5gC&amp;pg=PA174&amp;lpg=PA174&amp;dq=Bosch+Fernseh+BCN++specifications&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=F2mYXhslpc&amp;sig=-azdOkAdRgRTq-FJXlHup7T2CHc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3AUzT6OlO6OMigLLrtWFCg&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Bosch%20Fernseh%20BCN%20%20specifications&amp;f=false Magnetic recording: the first 100 years, page 174-175, By Eric D.

The format required an optional, and costly, digital framestore in addition to the normal analog [[timebase corrector]] to do any "trick-play" operations, such as slow motion/variable-speed playback, frame step play, and visible shuttle functions. This was because, unlike [[Type C videotape|1 inch type C]] which recorded one field per [[helical scan]] track on the tape, Type B segmented each field to 5 or 6 tracks per field according to whether it was a 525 ([[NTSC]]) or 625 ([[PAL]]) line machine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journal.smpte.org/content/88/12/823.abstract Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers, The BCN System for Magnetic Recording of Television Programs by Heinrich L. Zahn1]&lt;/ref&gt;

The picture quality was excellent, and standard R/P machines, digital frame store machines, reel-to-reel portables, random access cart machines (for playback of short-form video material such as [[television commercial]]s), and portable cart versions were marketed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TOMOmmrvwCcC&amp;pg=PA196&amp;lpg=PA196&amp;dq=Bosch+Fernseh+BCN+VTR+SPECS&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WvvHKar_xy&amp;sig=p3yswjBVDqVUANjEa9MaHpvYNY8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mv8yT9r-A8ijiQL99oWOCg&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Bosch%20Fernseh%20BCN%20VTR%20SPECS&amp;f=false The History of Television, 1942 to 2000, page 196, By Albert Abramson, Christopher H.

Echo Science Corporation, a United States company, made units like a BCN 1 for the U.S. military for a short time in the 1970s. Echo Science models were Pilot 1, Echo 460, Pilot 260.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.labguysworld.com/PrecisionEcho-521.htm labguysworld.com Arvin/Echo]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fernsehmuseum.info/vtr-review-1975.html fernsehmuseum.info 1975&amp;nbsp;– Bosch-Fernseh BCN 20 / BCN 40/50 1" tape]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Echo Science Corp., located in Mountain View, California was a subsidiary of Arvin Industries, Inc., based in Columbus, Indiana, from 1974 to 1981. It was also known as "Arvin/Echo" for short.  http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history2/15/Arvin-Industries-Inc.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special BCN units==
*Ruxton Video in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] (1970–1980s) used modified BCNs for [[Film frame|24 Frame]] playback to TVs used on [[movie studio]] sets. Thus the [[TV]]s had no [[flicker (screen)|flicker]] when seen on film, due to the film-compatible [[frame rate]]. Bill Hogan of Ruxton Ltd received in 1981 an [[Academy Award for Technical Achievement]] for his 24frame TV  work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spudcentral.com/lahs/1981.html Oscar Technical Achievement Award], Bill Hogan (II) (Ruxton, Ltd); Richard J. Stumpf (Universal City Studios' Production Sound Department); Daniel R. Brewer (Universal City Studios' Production Sound Department)- For the engineering of a 24-frame color video system.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000003/1982 imdb.com] Academy Awards, Technical Achievement Award, Bill Hogan (II) (Ruxton, Ltd), March 29, 1982, Los Angeles, California&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Image Transform]] in [[Universal City, California|Universal City]], co-founded by Ken Holland, in 1970,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dv.com/article/70868 NewBay Media] The Top Guns of Digital Intermediate, January 28, 2004, Ken Holland&lt;/ref&gt; used specially modified BCNs to record 24-frame video also, but for their "Image Vision" system. The BCN would record and play back 24-frame video at 10&amp;nbsp;MHz bandwidth, with twice the standard 525-line [[NTSC]] resolution. To record this the headwheel and [[capstan (tape recorder)|capstan]] ran at twice normal speed. Modified 24 frame/s 10&amp;nbsp;MHz Bosch Fernseh KCK-40 [[professional video camera]]s were used on the set. This was a custom pre-[[HDTV]] video system. This Image Vision recording could then be recorded to [[film out|film]] on a modified 3M Electron Beam film recorder (EBR). Image Transform had modified other gear for this process. At its peak, this system was used to make "[[Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl]]" in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084352/technical mdb.com Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl]&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first major use of early electronic cinema technology (using wideband high-resolution analog video technology, predating [[Information Technology|IT]]-based DI ([[digital intermediate]]) [[post production]] for film nowadays) using a film recorder for Film out. [[Electronovision]] was also a pre-process like Image Vision. Merlin Engineering also worked on the BCN's Wide bandwidth, 10 MHZ, BCN modification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amiaconference.com/techrev/V10_01/sturm_sargent.htm Tech Review with Al Sturm, April 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dave.zfx.com/hist.html 24frame dave.zfx.com BCN history at Image Transform]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Bell and Howell]] (later Rank Video Services) used special BCNs for mass [[VHS]] duplication. These specially-modified BCN VTRs could play back movies at two times the normal speed. In addition, the sync signals were also were at two times speed as well.  For proper playback, the headwheel and capstan also ran at twice normal speed. Specially modified VHS [[Videocassette recorder|recorders]] could record this [[video]]. In doing this, the duplication [[Factory|plant]] could output twice the product than normal videocassette duplicating systems.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CyUEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT113&amp;lpg=PT113&amp;dq=Bell+and+Howell+mass+VHS+duplication.+northbrook+illinois&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tVbyaiSo68&amp;sig=N-KuCgmpkTFT5NRvS8QfuTw-ae0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VQNET-7bJOWOiAKI8IjWDg&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Bell%20and%20Howell%20mass%20VHS%20duplication.%20northbrook%20illinois&amp;f=false Billboard Nov 17, 1979] VHS duplication&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epatents.gov.sg/pe/DisGazette.asp?AppNo=1997905673&amp;ImgID=I000096876 epatents.gov] SYSTEM FOR DUPLICATING INFORMATION RECORDED IN SLANTED TRACKS, RANK VIDEO SERVICES AMERICA&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://audiosystemsgroup.com/AESConsumerVideotapeDup.pdf audiosystemsgroup.com] Page 129, CONSUMER VIDEO TAPE DUPLICATION TECHNIQUES, A TUTORIAL, by Jim Brown, SOUND ENGINEERING ASSOCIATES

* Bell and Howell's Data Tape division in [[Pasadena, California]] modified BCNs to record high speed [[Data#Uses of data in computing|data]] for [[instrumentation]] purposes. These instrumentation recordings were mostly used by US government agencies, such as for [[NASA]] on the [[Space Shuttle]]. This unit could record data from up to 800 sensors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sypris.com/sypris-electronics/recording-products Sypris Company] on Bell and Howell's Data Tape division&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2otFgtEgfiEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Computerworld] Nov. 12, 1975 on Bell and Howell's Data Tape division&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DvQKQf66qosC&amp;pg=PT18&amp;lpg=PT18&amp;dq=Bell+and+Howell+Data+Tape+division+in+#v=onepage&amp;q=Bell%20and%20Howell%20Data%20Tape%20division%20in&amp;f=false Computerworld] May 7, 1975 on Bell and Howell's Data Tape division&lt;/ref&gt;
*Because of the small scanner, BCNs could record even at high [[g-force|''g''-forces]]. Hand picked BCN20 VTRs could record at low [[temperatures]], down to -40&amp;nbsp;°C (-40&amp;nbsp;°F). This was done at the [[Olympic Winter Games]] in [[1980 Winter Olympics|Lake Placid (1980)]] and in [[1984 Winter Olympics|Sarajevo (1984)]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.docstoc.com/docs/95071492/PAGE-TWO SMPTE] Page two on the [[1980 Winter Olympics|Lake Placid (1980)]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some users modified BCNs to fit 2-hour reels of tape on the BCN, so complete 2-hour movies could fit on one reel of tape. Bosch later made this a factory option, and was designated as BCN LP.
* Bosch also offered SLP BCN, a "long-play" variant of the format.  It moved the tape at 1/3 speed so that up to 6 hours could be recorded one reel. The unit has a special [[Slant azimuth#Slant azimuth recording|head wheel]] with [[Azimuth recording|azimuth head]]. This was mostly used for [[time zone]] tape delay by television networks. With a head wheel change and a switch the unit could be returned to normal play.
* One of the first [[Digital data|Digital]] [[SDTV]] [[VTR]]s was a non-production [[prototype]] BCN deck that could record and play back early type of [[CCIR 601]] [[Digital data|digital]] signals. These three Bosch VTRs paved the way for the later [[SMPTE]] [[D1 (Sony)|D1 VTR]] standard. In 1985 and 1986 in a [[Rennes]] experimental digital studio in [[France]], an experimental all-digital television center was made, it used the two all digital BCN units.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journal.smpte.org/content/95/1/13.abstract journal.smpte.org] An Experimental All-Digital Television Center, by D.

'''Vansploitation''' is a term used for a genre of American [[independent film]]s from the 1970s in which [[van]]s are a "key element to the plot", and that often feature comedic stories about college-age people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gutterfilms.com/post/64745417723/vansploitation|title=Gutterfilms.com: Article about vansploitation films.|accessdate=May 27, 2016}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The "short-lived"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blog.hemmings.com/index.php/2011/02/28/a-solar-powered-van-with-lasers/|title=Hemming's Daily: Note about the film "supervan".|accessdate=May 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/now-she-can-wake-take-you-hand-and-love-you-your-s-230695|title=AV Club: Article about the film "supervan".|accessdate=May 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; genre emerged in the United States in the early 1970s, exploiting the popularity of vans with young people, was very popular in the mid to late 1970s, and disappeared in the early 1980s. Vansploitation films were originally made mostly for young audiences. ''Blue Summer'' (1973) is credited as the first film of the genre which continued with films like ''[[The Van (1977 film)|The Van]]'' (1977)&lt;ref name=Coffman1&gt;{{cite web|title=Jason Coffman: A brief guide to vansploitation cinema, page 1|url=https://medium.com/@rabbitroom/freedom-fun-and-fine-transportation-a-brief-guide-to-vansploitation-cinema-part-1-8c655db4bdb#.y3i26rs5k}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Van Nuys Blvd. (film)|Van Nuys Blvd.]]'' (1979), the latter having been called "the most technically competent Vansploitation film".&lt;ref name=Coffman2&gt;{{cite web|title=Jason Coffman: A brief guide to vansploitation cinema, page 2|url=https://medium.com/@rabbitroom/freedom-fun-and-fine-transportation-a-brief-guide-to-vansploitation-cinema-part-2-56654e5b3a09#.eino3uye8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defining qualities of the genre==

Coffman argues that the mere appearance of a van in a film does not make it a vansploitation film. The van has to serve a special purpose in the story, which is summed up in the trailer of ''Van Nuys Blvd.'': "Freedom, fun and fine transportation".&lt;ref name=Coffman1&gt;{{cite web|title=Jason Coffman: A brief guide to vansploitation cinema, page 1|url=https://medium.com/@rabbitroom/freedom-fun-and-fine-transportation-a-brief-guide-to-vansploitation-cinema-part-1-8c655db4bdb#.y3i26rs5k}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, vans were highly customized, up to the extent of having an entirely custom body in ''Supervan''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://chromjuwelen.com/network/228-blog-hemmings/199791-the-ultimate-in-rolling-comfort-george-barriss-super-van-now-restored-makes-its-way-to-auction|title=Chromjuwelen: Article about the van used in Supervan, mentioning it was a "Vansploitation" film.|accessdate=May 27, 2016}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the van itself, van culture (wardrobe, magazines, meetings of van drivers) is also often featured prominently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ballsacademy.blogspot.de/2011/07/van-1977.html|title=Balls Academy: Review of "The Van", talking about vansploitation.|accessdate=May 27, 2016}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=The van (or vans) must provide the engine that drives the plot forward and/or provide the stage in which the action of the plot actually takes place. (...) The characters in Vansploitation films generally have goals oriented toward spending as much time in their van as possible, or in putting money into improving their van's performance and/or appearance via customization. (...) In short, most van movies are about getting laid (in a van) and winning road games or other competitions (also in a van).|sign=Jason Coffman|source=article about the Vansploitation genre.&lt;ref name=Coffman1&gt;{{cite web|title=Jason Coffman: A brief guide to vansploitation cinema, page 1|url=https://medium.com/@rabbitroom/freedom-fun-and-fine-transportation-a-brief-guide-to-vansploitation-cinema-part-1-8c655db4bdb#.y3i26rs5k}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quote|text=Most vansploitation movies were about harmlessly rebellious young people outwitting the stodgy authority figures bent on stopping them from having a good time.|sign=Scott Ashlin|source=review of the film ''Twister's Revenge''.}}

{{Quote|text=''The Van'' was one of those typical American exploitation movies.

}}

The genre follows two earlier ones that also dealt with car-related topics popular in youth culture at their respective times: In the 1950s, films featuring [[Hot Rod]]s became very popular, and they were followed by [[motorcycle]] films in the 1960s (for example, ''[[The Wild Angels]]'' and ''[[Easy Rider]]''). As the popularity of vans in youth culture increased in the early 1970s, the first vansploitation films were created.&lt;ref name=Coffman1&gt;{{cite web|title=Jason Coffman: A brief guide to vansploitation cinema, page 1|url=https://medium.com/@rabbitroom/freedom-fun-and-fine-transportation-a-brief-guide-to-vansploitation-cinema-part-1-8c655db4bdb#.y3i26rs5k}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple factors are credited with creating the "customized van craze".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Moviefone: Review of the film "Supervan"|url=http://www.moviefone.com/2010/03/30/sci-fi-dvds-you-should-own-supervan-1977/}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 1975, the song "[[Chevy Van (song)|Chevy Van]]" by [[Sammy Johns]] sold about three million copies, and is credited for an increase in van sales the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= |last= |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p25248|pure_url=yes}} |title=Biography of Sammy Johns, written by Linda Seida |publisher=Allmusic.com |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song (among others by Sammy Johns) was used prominently in the soundtrack of ''The Van'' (1977).

[[File:The GreatLester 1904 - Wielki Lester 1904.png|thumb|right|Ventriloquist [[The Great Lester]] with Frank Byron, Jr. on his knee, c. 1904]]
'''Ventriloquism''', or '''ventriloquy''', is an act of [[stagecraft]] in which a person (a '''ventriloquist''') changes his or her voice so that it appears that the voice is coming from elsewhere, usually a puppeteered prop, known as a "dummy". The act of ventriloquism is '''ventriloquizing''', and the ability to do so is commonly called in English the ability to "throw" one's voice.

==History==

===Origins===
Originally, ventriloquism was a religious practice.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, Ryan (2013). ''Punch and Judy in 19th Century America: A History and Biographical Dictionary''. McFarland. p. 101. {{ISBN|0-7864-7270-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name comes from the Latin for ''to speak from the stomach'', i.e. ''venter'' (belly) and ''loqui'' (speak).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Concise Oxford English Dictionary| year = 1984|page = 1192|isbn = 0-19-861131-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greeks called this gastromancy ({{lang-el|εγγαστριμυθία}}). The noises produced by the stomach were thought to be the voices of the unliving, who took up residence in the stomach of the ventriloquist. The ventriloquist would then interpret the sounds, as they were thought to be able to speak to the dead, as well as foretell the future. One of the earliest recorded group of [[prophet]]s to use this technique was the [[Pythia]], the priestess at the temple of [[Apollo]] in [[Delphi]], who acted as the conduit for the Delphic Oracle.

One of the most successful early gastromancers was Eurykles, a prophet at [[Athens]]; gastromancers came to be referred to as ''Euryklides'' in his honour.&lt;ref name=EB11&gt;''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]'', 1911, ''Ventriloquism''.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the [[Middle Ages]], it was thought to be similar to witchcraft. One of the uses was by people pretending to be mediums or those claiming to be able to cast out evil spirits, and throwing the voice added to their credibility. Unfortunately, it was not unusual for (particularly) women doing this to be accused and burnt as witches. As [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|Spiritualism]] led to [[Magic (illusion)|stage magic]] and [[escapology]], so ventriloquism became more of a performance art as, starting around the 19th century, it shed its mystical trappings.

Other parts of the world also have a tradition of ventriloquism for ritual or religious purposes; historically there have been adepts of this practice among the Zulu, Inuit, and [[Māori people|Māori]] peoples.&lt;ref name="EB11"/&gt;

===Emergence as entertainment===
[[File:Sadlers Wells Theatre edited.jpg|thumb|left|275px|[[Sadler's Wells Theatre]] in the early 19th century, at a time when ventriloquist acts were becoming increasingly popular.]]
The shift from ventriloquism as manifestation of spiritual forces toward ventriloquism as entertainment happened in the eighteenth century at the [[travelling funfair]]s and market towns. An early depiction of a ventriloquist dates to 1754 in England, where [[Sir John Parnell, 1st Baronet|Sir John Parnell]] is depicted in the painting ''[[Humours of an Election|An Election Entertainment]]'' by [[William Hogarth]] as speaking via his hand.&lt;ref&gt;Baldini, Gabriele, and Gabriele Mandel (1967). ''L'opera completa di Hogarth pittore''. Milano: Rizzoli. p. 112. {{OCLC|958953004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1757, the Austrian Baron de Mengen performed with a small doll.&lt;ref name=Baron&gt;{{cite web|title=The Art of Improving the Voice and Ear|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZT1aL2-XQBgC&amp;pg=PA40|work=Book|accessdate=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 18th century, ventriloquist performances were an established form of entertainment in England, although most performers threw their voice to make it appear that it emanated from far away, rather than the modern method of using a puppet. A well known ventriloquist of the period, Joseph Askins, who performed at the [[Sadler's Wells Theatre]] in [[London]] in the 1790s advertised his act as "curious ad libitum Dialogues between himself and his invisible familiar, Little Tommy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.erudit.org/revue/ron/1999/v/n16/005878ar.html|title=An Other Voice: Ventriloquism in the Romantic Period|author=John A. Hodgson|publisher=Erudit}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other performers were beginning to incorporate dolls or puppets into their performance, notably the Irishman James Burne who "...&amp;nbsp;carries in his pocket, an ill-shaped doll, with a broad face, which he exhibits&amp;nbsp;... as giving utterance to his own childish jargon," and Thomas Garbutt.

The entertainment came of age during the era of the [[music hall]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[vaudeville]] in the [[United States]]. George Sutton began to incorporate a puppet act into his routine at [[Nottingham]] in the 1830s, but it is [[Fred Russell (ventriloquist)|Fred Russell]] who is regarded as the father of modern ventriloquism. In 1886, he was offered a professional engagement at the [[Palace Theatre, London|Palace Theatre]] in [[London]] and took up his stage career permanently. His act, based on the cheeky-boy dummy "Coster Joe" that would sit in his lap and 'engage in a dialogue' with him was highly influential for the entertainment format and was adopted by the next generation of performers. (A blue plaque has been embedded in a former residence of Russell by the British Heritage Society which reads 'Fred Russell the father of ventriloquism lived here').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rk0sX1reV30C&amp;dq=father+of+modern+ventriloquism&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Gender and Ventriloquism in Victorian and Neo-Victorian Fiction: Passionate Puppets|author=Davies, Helen|year=2012|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|accessdate=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:EdgarBergenandCharlieMcCarthyStageDoorCanteen1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Ventriloquist [[Edgar Bergen]] and his best-known sidekick, Charlie McCarthy, in the film ''[[Stage Door Canteen (film)|Stage Door Canteen]]'' (1943)]]
Fred Russell's successful comedy team format was applied by the next generation of ventriloquists. It was taken forward by the British [[Arthur Prince (ventriloquist)|Arthur Prince]] with his dummy Sailor Jim, who became one of the highest paid entertainers on the music hall circuit, and by the Americans [[The Great Lester]], Frank Byron, Jr., and [[Edgar Bergen]]. Bergen popularised the idea of the comedic ventriloquist.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Bergen, together with his favourite figure, Charlie McCarthy, hosted a radio program that was broadcast from 1937 to 1956. It was the #1 program on the nights it aired. Bergen continued performing until his death in 1978, and his popularity inspired many other famous ventriloquists who followed him, including [[Paul Winchell]], [[Jimmy Nelson (ventriloquist)|Jimmy Nelson]], [[David Strassman]], [[Jeff Dunham]], [[Terry Fator]], [[Ronn Lucas]], [[Wayland Flowers]], [[Shari Lewis]], [[Willie Tyler]], [[Jay Johnson (ventriloquist)|Jay Johnson]], [[Nina Conti]], and [[Darci Lynne Farmer]]. Another ventriloquist popular in the United States in the 1950s and 1960s was [[Señor Wences]].

The art of ventriloquism was popularised by [[Y. K. Padhye]] in North India and M. M. Roy in South India, who are believed to be the pioneers of this field in India. Y. K. Padhye's son [[Ramdas Padhye]] borrowed from him and made the art popular amongst the masses through his performance on television. Ramdas Padhye's son [[Satyajit Padhye]] is also a ventriloquist. Similarly, Indusree a female ventriloquist from Bangalore has contributed a lot to the art. She performs with 3 dummies simultaneously. [[Venky Monkey]] and Mimicry Srinivos, the disciples of M. M. Roy, popularized this art by giving shows in India and abroad. Mimicrist Srinivos, in particular, did several experiments in ventriloquism. He has popularized this art, calling it "Sound illusion." He goes into the audience without a microphone and entertains with point blank sound illusion in addition to entertaining on stage with dummies.{{clarify|date=November 2015}}

Ventriloquism's popularity waned for a while, probably because of modern media's electronic ability to convey the illusion of voice,{{cn|date=November 2015}} the natural special effect that is the heart of ventriloquism. In the U.K. in the 2000s there were only 15 full-time professional ventriloquists, down from around 400 in the 50s and 60s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/8702845.stm BBC. Magazine. Ventriloquism: Return of the dummy run]&lt;/ref&gt; A number of modern ventriloquists have developed a following as the public taste for live comedy grows. In 2007, [[Zillah &amp; Totte]] won the first season of [[Talang (TV series)|Sweden's Got Talent]] and became one of [[Sweden]]'s most popular family/children entertainers. A feature-length documentary about ventriloquism, ''I'm No Dummy'', was released in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://digitalcinemareport.com/node/1165#.W2u0QX7_qEI&lt;/ref&gt; Two different ventriloquists won seasons 10 and 12 of ''[[America's Got Talent]]''. Respectively, they were [[Paul Zerdin]] on September 16, 2015, and [[Darci Lynne Farmer]] on September 20, 2017.

==Making the right sounds==
[[File:Swedish ventriloquist act Zillah &amp; Totte.png|thumbnail|left|Swedish ventriloquist act [[Zillah &amp; Totte]]]]
One difficulty ventriloquists face is that all the sounds that they make must be made with lips slightly separated. For the [[Labial consonant|labial]] sounds ''f'', ''v'', ''b'', ''p'', and ''m'', the only choice is to replace them with others. A widely parodied example of this difficulty is the "gottle o' gear", from the reputed inability of less skilled practitioners to pronounce "bottle of beer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Ventriloquist's dummy==
[[File:Ventriloquist by David Shankbone-Cropped.jpg|thumb|A ventriloquist entertaining children at the [[Pueblo, Colorado]], Buell Children's Museum]]
Modern ventriloquists use a variety of different types of puppets in their presentations, ranging from soft cloth or foam puppets (Verna Finly's work is a pioneering example), flexible latex puppets (such as Steve Axtell's creations) and the traditional and familiar hard-headed knee figure ([[Tim Selberg]]'s mechanized carvings). The classic dummies used by ventriloquists (the technical name for which is '''ventriloquial figure''') vary in size anywhere from twelve inches tall to human-size and larger, with the height usually falling between thirty-four and forty-two inches. Traditionally, this type of puppet has been made from [[papier-mâché]] or wood. In modern times, other materials are often employed, including [[fiberglass]]-reinforced [[resin]]s, [[polyurethane|urethane]]s, filled (rigid) [[latex]], and [[neoprene]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yt0DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA154 "Look Inside A Dummy's Head."] ''Popular Mechanics'', December 1954, pp.&amp;nbsp;154–157.&lt;/ref&gt;

The McElroy brothers' figures are still considered by many ventriloquists as the apex of complex movement mechanics, with as many as fifteen facial and head movements controlled by interior finger keys and switches. Jeff Dunham referred to his McElroy figure Skinny Duggan as "the [[Stradivarius]] of dummies."{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

'''Wayang kulit''' is a traditional performing arts of [[shadow puppetry|puppet-shadow play]] found in the cultures of [[Java]], [[Bali]], and [[Lombok]], in [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=HdVkAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=wayang+kulit&amp;dq=wayang+kulit&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiq1MucpLLXAhWIo5QKHR8qC7gQ6AEINzAC|title=Javanese Wayang Kulit: an introduction|last=Ness|first=Edward C. Van|last2=Prawirohardjo|first2=Shita|date=1980|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195804140|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[wayang]] kulit performance, the puppet figures are rear-projected on a taut linen screen with a coconut-oil (or electric) light. The [[Dalang (puppeteer)|Dalang]] (shadow artist) manipulates carved leather figures between the lamp and the screen to bring the shadows to life. 

Wayang kulit is one of the many different forms of wayang theatre found in Indonesia, the other being ''[[wayang Beber#Wayang beber|wayang beber]], [[wayang#Wayang karucil or wayang klitik|wayang klitik]], [[wayang golek]], [[Topeng|wayang topeng]]'', and ''[[wayang wong]]''. Wayang kulit is among the best known, offering a unique combination of ritual, lesson and entertainment. On November 7, 2003, [[UNESCO]] designated ''wayang kulit'' from Indonesia as one of the [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/wayang-puppet-theatre-00063|title=Wayang puppet theatre - intangible heritage - Culture Sector - UNESCO|website=ich.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The term ''wayang'' is the [[Javanese language|Javanese word]] for [[shadow]],&lt;ref&gt;Mair, Victor H. ''Painting and Performance: Picture Recitation and Its Indian Genesis''. Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 1988. p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; or ''bayang'' in standard [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]; the word also means "imagination". 

In modern daily Javanese and Indonesian vocabulary, ''wayang'' can refer to the puppet itself or the whole puppet theatre performance. While ''kulit'' means [[skin]] or [[leather]], the material from which the figures are carved.

== History ==
[[Hinduism]] arrived in Indonesia from [[India]] before the [[Islam|Islamic]] and [[Christianity|Christian]] era. Sanskrit became the literary and court language of [[Java]] and later of [[Bali]].

The [[Hinduism|Hindus]] changed the ''Wayang'' (as did [[Muslim|Muslims]], later) to spread their religion, mostly telling stories from the [[Mahabharata]] or the [[Ramayana]]. This mixture of religion and ''wayang'' play was later praised as harmony between Hinduism and traditional [[Culture of Indonesia|Indonesian culture]].

When [[Islam]] began spreading in Indonesia, the display of God or gods in human form was prohibited, and thus this style of painting and shadow play was suppressed. King [[Raden Patah]] of Demak, Java, wanted to see the ''wayang'' in its traditional form, but failed to obtain permission from [[Muslim]] religious leaders.

Religious leaders attempted to skirt the Muslim prohibition by converting the ''[[Wayang Golek|wayang golek]]'' into ''[[Wayang|wayang purwa]]'' made from leather and displayed only the shadow instead of the puppets themselves&lt;ref&gt;[[Inna Solomonik]]. ''Wayang Purwa Puppets: the Language of the Silhouette'' - in: “Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde”, 136 (1980), no: 4, Leiden, hlm. 482-497&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Wayang puppet figures==
[[File:Wayang kulit lit.jpg|thumb|The puppet figures of a Javanese wayang kulit.]]
The wayang comes in sizes from 25&amp;nbsp;cm to 75&amp;nbsp;cm. The important characters are usually represented by several puppets each. The wayang is usually made out of [[water buffalo]] hide and goat hide and mounted on bamboo sticks. However, the best wayang is typically made from young female buffalo parchment, cured for up to ten years. The carving and punching of the [[Rawhide (material)|rawhide]], which is most responsible for the character's image and the shadows that are cast, are guided by this sketch.  A mallet is used to tap special tools, called ''tatah'', to punch the holes through the rawhide. Making the wayang sticks from horn is a complicated process of sawing, heating, hand-molding, and sanding until the desired effect is achieved.  When the materials are ready, the artist attaches the handle by precisely molding the ends of the horn around the individual wayang figure and securing it with thread. A large character may take months to produce.

There are '''important differences''', between the 3 Islands where Wayang Kulit is played (due to local religious canon) :
&lt;ref&gt;Art in Indonesia, Continuities and Changes - Claire Holt - Cornell University Press&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Das Indonesische Schattenspiel - Guenter Spitzing-  Dumont Taschenbuecher&lt;/ref&gt;

* in '''[[Java]]''' (where [[Islam]] is predominant), the puppets (named "ringgit") are elongated, the play lasts all night and the lamp (named blencong) is, nowadays, almost always electric. A full [[Gamelan]] with (pe)sinden is typically used.&lt;ref&gt;On thrones of Gold, Javanese Shadow Plays - James R. Brandon - Harvad University Press&lt;/ref&gt;
* In '''[[Bali]]''' (where [[Hinduism]] is predominant), the puppets look more real, the play last a few hours and, if at night, the lamp uses coconut oil. Music is mainly by the four "[[Gamelan gender wayang|Gender]]" wayang, with drums only if the story is from the [[Ramayana]] . There are no sinden. The Dalang does the singing.&lt;br&gt;Balinese dalangs are often also priests (amangku dalang). As such, they may also perform during daylight, for religious purposes (''exorcism''), without lamp and without screen (wayang sakral, or "lemah")&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qbz-WGBustUC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;lpg=PA14&amp;dq=amangku+dalang&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_5wDGcDzB5&amp;sig=5nRimy7vrYKohV-xCrX7OQSlZcE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiO-tjXlKPOAhWLHB4KHbt-AdcQ6AEIKDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=amangku%20dalang&amp;f=false Religion in Bali, by C. Hooykaas, University of Leiden]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In '''[[Lombok]]''' (where [[Islam]] is predominant and Bali's influence is strong), vernacular Wayang Kulit is known as '''Wayang Sasak''', with puppets similar than Javanese ringgits, a small orchestre with no sinden, but flutes, [[metallophones]] and drums. The repertoire is unique to the Island and is based on the [[Muslim]] Menak Cycle (adventures of [[Amir Hamzah]]).

==Performance==
[[File:INDRA-SWARA-UNAM-CCU-9-681x453.jpg |250px|thumb|Wayang kulit Grup [[Indra Swara]] Mexico in Spanish language]]
The stage of a wayang performance includes several components. A stretched linen canvas (''kelir'') acted as a canvas, dividing the dalang (puppeteer) and the spectator. A coconut-oil lamp (Javanese ''blencong'' or Balinese ''damar'') – which in modern time usually replaced with electric light – casts shadow onto the screen. A banana trunk (Javanese ''gedebog'', Balinese ''gedebong'') lies on the ground between the screen and the dalang, where the figures are stuck to hold them in place. To the right of the dalang sits the puppet chest, which the dalang uses as a drum during the performance, hitting it with a wooden mallet. In a Javanese wayang kulit performance, the dalang may use a cymbal-like percussion instrument at his feet to cue the musicians. The musicians sit behind the dalang in a [[gamelan]] orchestra setting. [[Gamelan]] orchestra is an integral part of the Javanese wayang kulit performance. The performance are accompanied with female singers (''pesinden'') and male singers (''wirasuara''). 

The setting of the banana trunk on the ground and canvas on the sky symbolizes each the earth and the sky, the whole composition symbolizes the entire cosmos. When the dalang animates the puppet figures and moves it across the screen, divine forces are acting in his hands with which he directs the happening. The lamp is a symbol of the sun as well as the eye of the dalang.&lt;ref&gt;Kathy Foley: ''My Bodies: The Performer in West''. In: ''TDR (1988-)'', Bd. 34, Nr. 2, Sommer 1990, S. 62–80, hier S. 75f&lt;/ref&gt;

A traditional wayang kulit performance begins after dark. The first of the three phases, in which the characters are introduced and the conflict is launched, lasts until midnight. The battles and intrigues of the second phase are about three hours. The third phase of reconciliation and friendship is finished at dawn.&lt;ref&gt;Constantine Korsovitis: ''Ways of the Wayang''. In: ''India International Centre Quarterly,'' Bd. 28, Nr. 2 (The Everyday The Familiar and the Bizarre) Sommer 2001, S. 59–68, hier S. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

''Wayang'' shadow plays are usually tales from the two major Hindu epics, the ''[[Ramayana]]'' and ''[[Mahabharata]]''. The puppet master contextualizes stories from the plays, making them relevant to current community, national or global issues. Gamelan players respond to the direction of the Dalang.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6596">On June 13, 1938 the United States Senate adopted Resolution 294, "Limitation of Power of Radio Broadcast Stations", commonly known as the '''Wheeler resolution'''. Introduced by Senator [[Burton K. Wheeler]] (D-Montana), it recommended that the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) fix the maximum power used by AM broadcasting stations at 50,000 watts. Shortly thereafter the FCC formally adopted the suggested 50,000 watt cap, which still remains the limit.
==Background==
On June 9, 1938, Senator Wheeler submitted a resolution for consideration by the full body:
{{Quote
|title="Limitation of Power of Radio Broadcast Stations" (U.S. Senate Resolution 294 (1938))&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015087659424;view=1up;seq=511 "Limitation of Power of Radio Broadcast Stations"] (Senate Resolution 294), ''Journal of the Senate of the United States of America'' (Seventy-Fifth Congress, Third Session), June 9, 1938, page 507.&lt;/ref&gt;
|text=&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''Resolved'', That it is the sense of the Senate of the United States of America that the operation of radio broadcast stations in the standard broadcast band (550 to 1600 kilocycles) with power in excess of 50 kilowatts is definitely against the public interest, in that such operation would tend to concentrate political, social, and economic power and influence in the hands of a very small group, and is against the public interest for the further reason that the operation of broadcast stations with power in excess of 50 kilowatts has been demonstrated to have adverse and injurious economic effects on other stations operating with less power, in depriving such stations of revenue and in limiting the ability of such stations to adequately or efficiently serve the social, religious, educational, civic, and other like organizations and institutions in the communities in which such stations are located and which must and do depend on such stations for the carrying on of community welfare work generally.
&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''Resolved further'', That it is, therefore, the sense of the Senate of the United States of America that the Federal Communications Commission should not adopt or promulgate rules to permit or otherwise allow any station operating on a frequency in the standard broadcast band (550 to 1600 kilocycles) to operate on a regular or other basis with power in excess of 50 kilowatts.}}

At the time this resolution was introduced, FM and TV stations did not yet exist, and there were fewer than 700 AM stations, many struggling economically due to the effects of the [[Great Depression]]. In 1928, under the provisions of the [[Federal Radio Commission]]'s (FRC) [[General Order 40]], broadcasting stations had been divided into three main categories: "local", limited to 100 watts, "regional", limited to 1,000 watts, and "clear", generally capped at 50,000 watts. Subsequently the daytime maximum for local stations had been raised to 250 watts, and to 5,000 watts for regional stations. Wheeler's resolution was related to the fact that the FCC was preparing to hold a series of hearing reviewing the future of the AM broadcating band, including transmitting power levels. 

In 1938 there already was one station, [[WLW (AM)|WLW]] in Cincinnati, Ohio, operating with significantly higher power than 50,000 watts. Beginning in 1934 WLW received a series of temporary authorizations to use 500,000 watts, moreover, the FCC had received applications from more than a dozen additional stations to start using powers above 50,000 watts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/broadcasting11unse#page/n86/mode/1up/ "Four Stations File For 500 kw. Power"], ''Broadcasting'', July 1, 1936, page 77.&lt;/ref&gt; The prospect of numerous "superpower" stations made many lower powered stations concerned that they would be "drowned out" and unable to compete economically, which would lead to a reduction in the number of operating stations. Wheeler, an avid anti-monopolist, also warned that domination of the airwaves by high-powered stations could lead to the rise of a dictator like  [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] in Italy, [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] in Germany or [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] in the Soviet Union, each of whom used control of radio broadcasting to aid their seizures of power.&lt;ref&gt;[https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045462/1938-12-11/ed-1/seq-1/ "Advertising on Radio Must Be Limited, Wheeler Warns"], ''Washington Evening Star'', December 11, 1938, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wheeler's Resolution 294 was adopted by the full senate on June 13. Although Senator [[Robert J. Bulkley]] (D-Ohio) entered a motion to reconsider the vote,&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015087659424;view=1up;seq=543 "Radio Stations Broadcasting in Standard Band"], ''Journal of the Senate of the United States of America'' (Seventy-Fifth Congress, Third Session), June 13, 1938, page 539.&lt;/ref&gt; he withdrew the motion the next day.&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015087659424;view=1up;seq=566 "Limitation of Power of Radio Broadcast Stations"], ''Journal of the Senate of the United States of America'' (Seventy-Fifth Congress, Third Session), June 14, 1938, page 562.&lt;/ref&gt; A resolution, unlike a law, was not binding on the FCC, however it was seen as having an important influence on the outcome of its hearings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/broadcasting15unse#page/n22/mode/1up/ "Revision of FCC Regulations Is Unlikely Before Next Year"], ''Broadcasting'', July 1, 1938, page 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
After concluding the hearings, in early 1939 the FCC announced its new regulations, which narrowed the power differences between low and high-powered stations. Local stations could now use up to 250 watts at night, and regional stations 5,000 watts. On the other hand, in language that largely echoed the financial arguments of the Wheeler resolution, clear channel stations were still limited to 50,000 watts, and WLW's authorization to use 500,000 watts, except experimentally during early morning hours, was terminated.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/broadcasting16unse#page/n184/mode/1up/ "Proposed New FCC Rules Well Received"], ''Broadcasting'', February 1, 1939, pages 16-17, 70-73.&lt;/ref&gt; Although subsequently many AM stations in other countries, especially in Europe and Asia, would use far greater powers, in the United States the Wheeler resolution's 50,000 watt cap has remained in place.

'''Worzel Gummidge''' is a walking, talking [[scarecrow]] character in British children's fiction  who originally appeared in a series of books by the English novelist [[Barbara Euphan Todd]].&lt;ref name="ScrOl"&gt;[http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/956561/index.html "Worzel Gummidge (1979-81)"] ''ScreenOnline.org.uk''&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first story book published by [[Puffin Books]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Hahn (2015). "The Oxford Companion to Children's Literature". p. 479. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The books were adapted for radio and television a number of times, most successfully with former ''[[Doctor Who]]'' actor [[Jon Pertwee]] taking the lead role from 1979 to 1981 in the [[Southern Television]] series ''[[Worzel Gummidge (TV series)|Worzel Gummidge]]'', originally produced in the UK (this series was ranked among the top [[50 Greatest Kids TV Shows|50 greatest British children's programmes]]) and later in New Zealand (1987&amp;ndash;1989). For the [[TV series]] Gummidge had a set of interchangeable [[turnip]], [[mangelwurzel]] and [[Rutabaga|swede]] heads, each of which suited a particular occasion or endowed him with a specific skill.

==Outline==
Worzel Gummidge is a scarecrow that can come to life on Scatterbrook Farm. Worzel stands in ten acre field. He befriended John and Susan who came to stay during the School holidays on the Braithwaites Farm. Worzel normally lands John and Susan in trouble when he is being mischievous, as he goes into a sulk and becomes a normal lifeless scarecrow. This leads others to blame the two children for the trouble Worzel causes.

The Worzel Gummidge books differ from the television adaption; one difference being that in the books Worzel was married to Earthy Mangold. In the first book, Aunt Sally (his [[Femme fatale]] in the TV series) is only mentioned in one chapter and the character is an antagonistic bully to Worzel. For the television adaptation, Worzel has a collection of interchangeable heads. In the books, the maker of Worzel Gummidge and other scarecrows is not named the Crowman, but is described as mysterious figure.

[[File:Xinhua_Bookstore_1,_China.jpg|200px|right|thumb|The main Xinhua Bookstore in [[Dalian]], [[Liaoning]], for example, is housed in a 9-story building, with a basement for CDs, DVDs and computer software.]]

== History ==
Xinhua Bookstore (in {{zh|新华书店}}) was originally established as Guanghua Bookstore (in {{zh|光华书店}}) in 1937 in [[Yan'an]] under the Propaganda Department of the [[Communist Party of China]].  In 1942, Guanghua Bookstore changed its name to Xinhua Bookstore.  

The four Chinese letter "Xin-hua Shu-dian" logo was made in brush writing in 1948 by Chairman [[Mao Zedong]].  In 1951, during the First All-China Publishing Administration Conference, it was decided to divide  the vertically integrated operation into the People's Publishing House, Xinhua Publishing Plant, and the Xinhua Bookstore. 

In 2003, Xinhua Bookstore was reorganized, coming under the [[China Publishing Group]] (in {{zh|中国出版集团}}), and owns the largest chain of bookstores in [[China]].  As China's only country-wide distribution channel for magazines, and CDs and DVDs, it plays an important role in mass media, in addition to its dominant position as a bookstore.

In 2006, there were 14,000 Xinhua bookstores in China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://baike.baidu.com/view/23355.htm Xinhua Bookstore (Baidu Encyclopedia)] in Chinese&lt;/ref&gt;  Its main store is now in [[Xicheng District]] in [[Beijing]].

Xinhua Bookstore has overseas subsidiaries in [[New York City]], [[San Diego]], [[London]], and in [[Binondo]], [[Manila]], which caters to the needs of Chinese schools in the Metropolis.

== Multiple distribution channels ==

In the larger cities in China, Xinhua Bookstore has opened "Foreign Language Bookstores" (in {{zh|外文书店}}) which sell books and CDs for learning foreign languages.  Books published in foreign countries are not sold in China because of the price reasons, and magazine from foreign countries are prohibited for distribution for political reasons.

Xinhua Bookstore's Provincial Publishing Companies have recently begun opening different distribution channels, such as the Northern Book Town (in {{zh|北方图书城}}) in [[Liaoning Province]] and Boku Book Town {{zh|博库书城}} in [[Zhejiang Province]].
