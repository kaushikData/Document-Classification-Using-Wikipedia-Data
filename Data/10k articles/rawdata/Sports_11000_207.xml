The final of the [[2007 ICC Cricket World Cup]] was played on 28 April 2007 at the [[Kensington Oval]], [[Barbados]]. Australia defeated Sri Lanka by 53 runs (under the [[Duckworth–Lewis method]]) to win their 4th World Cup and 3rd in succession.

==Road to the Final==

Australia reached the final by defeating [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]] by 7 wickets, while Sri Lanka reached the final by defeating [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] by 81 runs in the [[2007 Cricket World Cup#Semi-finals|semi-finals]].

==Details==
This was the first World Cup final to be a repeat – the sides previously met in the [[1996 Cricket World Cup Final|1996 World Cup Final]], which Sri Lanka won. Australia has won every World Cup match against Sri Lanka apart from that loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.cricinfo.com/link_to_database/STATS/BY_OPPONENT/AUS-SL/WC/AUS-SL_ODI_SERIES_SUMMARY.html|title=Australia v Sri Lanka: World Cup Series Summary|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=2007-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The match was Sri Lanka's second World Cup final appearance and Australia's sixth, their fourth in a row.
[[Ricky Ponting]] won the toss and elected to bat. However, the start of play was delayed due to rain, and the match was reduced to 38 overs per side. [[Adam Gilchrist|Adam Gilchrist's]] score of 149 – the highest in a World Cup final – helped give Australia an imposing total of 281.&lt;ref name="final"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/292681.html|title=Gilchrist leads Australia to World Cup treble|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=2007-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Australian World Cup treble.jpg|thumb|200px|A large crowd of over 10,000 fans welcome the Australian team on completing the first World Cup hat-trick – Martin Place, Sydney.]] Sri Lankan batsmen [[Kumar Sangakkara]] and [[Sanath Jayasuriya]] added 116 for the second wicket, before falling with the score at 123 and 145 respectively.&lt;ref name="final" /&gt; Despite the regular loss of wickets, Sri Lanka managed to maintain a run rate of over 6 an over. Further rain forced the reduction of Sri Lanka's innings to just 36 overs, with the target revised to 269. At the culmination of the 33rd over, with Sri Lanka still trailing the adjusted [[Duckworth-Lewis]] target by 37 runs, the umpires suspended the game due to bad light. While Australia's players began to celebrate their victory (since the minimum 20 overs had been reached), the umpires incorrectly announced that because the match was suspended due to light and not rain, the final three overs would have to be bowled the following day. With Sri Lanka needing 61 runs from 18 deliveries, Mahela Jayawardene agreed there was no need to return the following day, and instructed his team to resume batting, with Ricky Ponting agreeing to play only spinners.

The '''All-Ireland Senior Football Championship''' (SFC) ({{lang-ga|Craobhchomórtas Sinsear na hÉireann sa Pheil}}), the premier competition in [[Gaelic football]], is an annual series of games played in [[Ireland]] and organised by the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] (GAA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Newest All Ireland Minor Football Final Information |url=https://dailyhottrends.com/tag/all-ireland-minor-football-final/ |website=dailyhottrends}}&lt;/ref&gt; The All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final is played on the third or fourth Sunday in September at [[Croke Park]] in [[Dublin]], with the winning team receiving the [[Sam Maguire Cup]].

Contested by the top inter-county football teams in Ireland, the tournament has taken place every year since 1887, except in 1888, when the competition was not played due to a tour of the [[United States]] by would-be competitors.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==History==

The [[1887 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|first Championship]] to be held featured club teams who represented their respective counties after their county championship. The 21 a-side final was between Commercials of Limerick and Young Irelands of Louth. The final was played in Beech Hill, Clonskeagh (not Bird Avenue) on 29 April 1888 with Commercials winning by 1–4 to 0–3. Unlike later All-Ireland competitions, there were no provincial championships, and the result was an open draw.

The [[1888 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|second Championship]] was unfinished owing to the [[American Invasion Tour]]. The 1888 provincial championships had been completed (Tipperary, Kilkenny and Monaghan winning them; no Connacht teams entered) but after the Invasion tour returned, the All-Ireland semi-final and final were not played. English team [[London GAA|London]] reached the final four times in the early years of the competition (1900–1903).

In 1892, inter-county teams were introduced to the All-Ireland Championship. Congress granted permission for the winning club to use players from other clubs in the county, thus the inter-county teams came into being. The rules of hurling and football were also altered: goals were made equal to five points, and teams were reduced from 21 to 17 a-side.

The [[1903 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1903 Championship]] brought [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]]'s first All-Ireland title. They went on to become the most successful football team in the history of the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gaa.ie/about-the-gaa/gaa-history/rolls-of-honour |title=GAA Roll of Honour |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130811031721/http://www.gaa.ie/about-the-gaa/gaa-history/rolls-of-honour/ |archivedate=11 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first half of the twentieth century brought the rise of several teams who won two or more All-Ireland titles in that period, such as Kildare, Mayo, Cavan, Wexford and Roscommon. In the 1990s, a significant sea change took place, as the All-Ireland was claimed by an [[Ulster]] team in four consecutive years (1991–1994). Since then Ulster has produced more All-Ireland winning teams than any other province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Seán|last=Moran|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/sport/gaelic-games/gaelic-football/donegal-hoping-to-avoid-being-fifth-all-ireland-champions-in-20-years-to-fall-at-first-hurdle-in-ulster-1.1406722?page=1|title=Donegal hoping to avoid being fifth All-Ireland champions in 20 years to fall at first hurdle in Ulster: Uneasy lies the head that wears the northern crown|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|publisher=Irish Times Trust|date=26 May 2013|accessdate=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The All-Ireland Qualifiers were introduced in 2001. Later that year, [[2001 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|the 2001 final]] brought victory for Galway who became the first football team to win an All-Ireland by springing through "the back door." In 2013, [[Hawk-Eye]] was introduced for Championship matches at Croke Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/football/2013/0515/392343-gaa-hope-hawkeye-will-stop-contentious-points/|title=GAA hopes Hawk-Eye will eliminate contentious points|work=RTÉ Sport|date=15 May 2013|accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first used to confirm that [[Offaly GAA|Offaly]] substitute [[Peter Cunningham (Gaelic footballer)|Peter Cunningham]]'s attempted point had gone wide 10 minutes into the second half of a game against [[Kildare GAA|Kildare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hoganstand.com/ArticleForm.aspx?ID=193535|title=Hawkeye makes successful debut|work=Hogan Stand|date=2 June 2013|accessdate=2 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2013 also brought the first Friday night game in the history of the Championship - a first round qualifier between [[Carlow GAA|Carlow]] and [[Laois GAA|Laois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/football/2013/0617/457027-derry-and-sligo-to-clash-in-football-qualifiers/|title=Qualifiers include first ever Friday night game|work=RTÉ Sport|date=17 June 2013|accessdate=17 June 2013|quote=Carlow will play Laois on 28 June in Dr Cullen Park, the first time a Championship game will take place on a Friday night.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2018 saw the introduction of the All Ireland Super 8s.

==Format==
{{Main|GAA county}}

===Current format===
The county is a geographical region in Ireland, and each of the [[Counties of Ireland|thirty-two counties]] in Ireland organise their own [[gaelic games]] affairs through a County Board. The county teams play in their respective Provincial Championships (reflective of the four [[Provinces of Ireland|Irish provinces]]) in [[Connacht GAA|Connacht]] (which also includes teams from [[London GAA|London]] and [[New York GAA|New York]]), [[Leinster GAA|Leinster]], [[Munster GAA|Munster]], and [[Ulster GAA|Ulster]]. Kilkenny is currently unique among the 32 Irish county associations in not participating in the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship. The Provincial Championships operate through a [[knockout tournament|knock-out cup competition]] format. They take place during the months of May and June. The winners of each of the four Provincial Championships earn a place in the All-Ireland Super 8s, a round robin group stage new to the 2018 Championship, which takes place in the months of July and August.

Each provincial championship match is played as a single leg. If a match is drawn [[extra time]] is played. However, if both sides are still level at the end of extra time a replay takes place. In the case of a provincial final if matches end level a replay takes place without extra time.

The twenty-nine teams that fail to win their respective Provincial Championships receive a second opportunity to reach the All-Ireland Series via the All Ireland Qualifiers (also known as the '[[Wild card (sports)|back door]]'). The qualifiers series takes place in the months of June and July and operates as follows:
[[File:Croke Park fans on the hill.jpg|thumb|250px|Fans of [[Sligo GAA|Sligo]] (in black) are visible in the crowd among supporters of [[Cork GAA|Cork]], [[Meath GAA|Meath]] and [[Tyrone GAA|Tyrone]]. The introduction of the All-Ireland Qualifiers in 2001 has provided weaker counties with opportunities to play big games at [[Croke Park]].]]
*'''Qualifiers'''
**'''Round 1:''' All teams that fail to reach the semi-finals of their respective Provincial Championships (16 in total) compete in round one. An open draw system is used to divide the teams into eight individual match-ups. The winning eight teams progress to Round 2, while the losing eight teams are eliminated from the All Ireland Championship.
**'''Round 2:''' Each of the eight winning teams of Round 1 are drawn against the eight losing teams from the semi-finals of the four Provincial Championships. The winning eight teams progress to Round 3, while the losing eight teams are eliminated from the All Ireland Championship.
**'''Round 3:''' The eight winning teams from Round 2 are divided into four individual match-ups. An open draw is made to determine the four pairings. The winning four teams progress to Round 4, while the losing four teams are eliminated from the All Ireland Championship.
**'''Round 4:''' Each of the four winning teams of Round 3 are drawn against the four losing teams from the finals of the four Provincial Championships. The winning four teams proceed to the All-Ireland Series, joining the four Provincial Champions, while the losing four teams are eliminated from the All Ireland Championship.
*'''The All-Ireland Championship'''
**{{anchor|Super 8s}}&lt;!-- [[All-Ireland Super 8s]] redirects here--&gt;'''All-Ireland Super 8s:''' The four Provincial Champions and the winning four teams from Round 4 of the All-Ireland Qualifiers take part in a group stage that takes place in the months of July and August. The group stage is organised on a league basis with two groups of four teams, with each team playing the other three teams once. Each group consists of two Provincial Champions and two Round 4 Qualifier Winners. Each team plays one game in [[Croke Park]], one home game and one away game. (In the case of [[Dublin GAA|Dublin]], Croke Park is treated as the home stadium so they would play two games in Croke Park). The top two teams in both groups qualify for the All Ireland Semi Finals.
**'''All-Ireland Semi Finals:''' The winner of group one plays the runner-up of group two and the winner of group two plays the runner-up of group one in two All-Ireland Semi Finals played over the course of one weekend. 
**'''All-Ireland Final:''' The two remaining teams meet in the All-Ireland Final, to take place in August. The winning team is crowned All-Ireland Champions and presented with the [[Sam Maguire Cup]].

Significant changes to the format of the Championship were made at GAA's Annual Congress in February 2017. The most significant change is the creation of The All-Ireland Quarter-Final Group Stage (known as the Super 8s), which replaced the previous Quarter-Final stage of the Championship. Additionally the All-Ireland Final was moved to August and replays will only be held for drawn provincial finals and drawn All-Ireland Finals, with extra time to be played in all other Championship matches. The changes will be trialled for three years before being reviewed by the GAA in late 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rte.ie/sport/football/2017/0225/855359-ga-congress-super-8-replays/|title='Super 8' system to replace Senior Football Championship quarter-finals after GAA vote|work=RTÉ Sport|date=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quarter-finals format (2001–17)===
From 2001-17, the Championship was played using the Quarter-finals format. Under this format Provincial matches would take place during the months of May, June and July. The winners of each of the four Provincial Championships would earn a place in the All-Ireland Quarter-Finals, which would take place in the month of August. Replays would be played for all drawn matches, not just drawn Provincial Finals and drawn All-Ireland Finals. Extra-time would only be used for Replays and Qualifier Matches. If the teams were still level after extra time, the qualifier match would go to a replay or in the case of replays, another replay would take place.

The qualifiers series would take place in the months of June and July with the winning four teams of Round 4 playing the four Provincial Champions in the All-Ireland Quarter Finals.

**'''All-Ireland Quarter Finals:''' The four Provincial Champions would be drawn against the winning four teams from Round 4 of the All-Ireland Qualifiers. If a match finished with both teams level, a replay would take place. The four winning teams qualify for the All-Ireland Semi-Finals.
**'''All-Ireland Semi Finals:''' The All-Ireland Semi Finals would take place in August and be contested by the four winners of the All-Ireland Quarter Finals. If a match ended with both teams level, a replay would take place. The two winning teams qualify for the All-Ireland Final.
**'''All-Ireland Final:''' The two remaining teams would meet in the All-Ireland Final, usually on the third Sunday in September. The winning team is crowned All-Ireland Champions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gaa.ie/plugins/newsfeed.cgi?rm=content&amp;plugin_data_id=15367 GAA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926224857/http://www.gaa.ie/plugins/newsfeed.cgi?rm=content&amp;plugin_data_id=15367 |date=26 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historic format (1888–2000)===
For the first All-Ireland championship in 1887, the competition was played on an open draw knockout basis. From 1888, the provincial system was introduced, whereby the counties in each of Ireland's four provinces would play each other on a knockout basis to find provincial champions. These four champions would meet in the All-Ireland semi-finals. The structure outlined above was adopted in 2001 to allow more games to be played, but still retain provincial championships and the knockout structure, resulting in every game continuing to be a meaningful fixture, with no dead-rubber league format matches being played out.

==All-Ireland finals==

[[File:Croke Park from the hill.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Croke Park]] kitted out in the green and red of [[Mayo GAA|Mayo]] fans at the [[2004 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final]].]]
Typically, over the four Sundays of September, All-Ireland Finals in men's football, ladies' football, hurling and camogie take place at [[Croke Park]], the national stadium of the GAA. Two grades are played on each final day, the ''senior'' team and the ''minor'' team (consisting of younger players, under the age of 18, who have participated in that year's [[All-Ireland Minor Football Championship]]). Guests who attend these events include the [[President of Ireland]], the [[Taoiseach]] and other important dignitaries. The football final is considered the pinnacle event of this period.

The final game of the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship takes place on the third Sunday of September. The men's decider regularly attracts crowds of over 80,000. The winning team captain receives the [[Sam Maguire Cup]]. The current champions are [[Dublin GAA|Dublin]].

==Records and statistics==
{{main|All-Ireland Senior Football Championship records and statistics}}
Although [[Wexford GAA|Wexford]] were the first county to win four consecutive All-Ireland Senior Football Finals (1915–18), historically [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]] have been the most successful football team in the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship. As of 2015, Kerry have won the competition on 37 occasions, winning in four consecutive years twice (1929–1932 and 1978–1981) and for three consecutive years twice as well (1939–1941 and 1984–1986). Dublin have joined the four in a row club winning the competition consecutively since 2014. No team has yet conquered the five in a row. [[Galway GAA|Galway]] were the first team from the western province of [[Connacht]] to win an All-Ireland title, doing so in 1925. [[1933 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|The 1933 final]] brought victory for [[Cavan GAA|Cavan]], who became the first team from the northern province of [[Ulster]] to win an All-Ireland title.

Two teams have won the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship as part of [[The Double (Gaelic games)|a double]] with that year's [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship]], namely [[Cork GAA|Cork]] (1890 and 1990) and [[Tipperary GAA|Tipperary]] (1895 and 1900). The championship has never been won by a team from outside Ireland, though [[London GAA|London]] have played in five finals.

[[Dublin GAA|Dublin]] are the reigning champions, having defeated [[Tyrone GAA|Tyrone]] in the [[2018 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final]].

'''{{lang|it|Bocce volo}}''' ("flying boules"), or '''{{lang|fr|boule lyonnaise}}''' ("Lyonnais boules"), is a [[boules]]-type game.

In ''{{lang|it|bocce volo}}'', the balls are thrown overhand (palm down) and are metal.&lt;ref&gt;Petanque vs. Bocce at [http://petanque-america.com/game.html Petanque America]&lt;/ref&gt; In standard ''{{lang|it|bocce}}'', the wooden or plastic balls are tossed underhand (palm up) and rolled.

''{{lang|it|Volo}}'', as it is called for short by the Italians, derives its name from the Italian verb ''{{lang|it|volare}}'' meaning 'to fly', and refers to the technique of throwing a ball through the air in an attempt to knock away an opponent's ball. 

''{{lang|it|Bocce volo}}'' is similar to ''{{lang|fr|pétanque}}'' in that the ball is thrown rather than rolled or bowled. It is similar to traditional ''{{lang|it|bocce}}'' (and different from ''{{lang|fr|pétanque}}'') in that the ball is delivered with a run-up.  A ''{{lang|it|volo}}'' players' run-up is athletic, even theatrical, as in ''{{lang|fr|[[jeu provençal]]}}''.&lt;ref&gt;Petanque vs. Bocce at [http://petanque-america.com/game.html Petanque America]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bowen Field House''' is a 5,400 seat multi-purpose [[arena]] in [[Ypsilanti, Michigan]] on the [[Eastern Michigan University]] campus.  It opened in 1955 and was home to the [[Eastern Michigan Eagles]] [[Eastern Michigan Eagles men's basketball|men's]] and women's [[basketball]] teams until the [[Convocation Center (Eastern Michigan University)|Convocation Center]] opened in 1997. It currently serves as the home of [[Eastern Michigan Eagles track and field]], [[Eastern Michigan Eagles wrestling]], and [[Eastern Michigan Eagles gymnastics]].

The last regular season basketball game at the Field House was against the [[University of Toledo]] on February 25, 1998, though EMU hosted Toledo again three days later in the Field House in the opening round of the [[1998 MAC Men's Basketball Tournament|Mid-American Conference tournament that year]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=74IUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kAMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3496,3663593&amp;dq=bowen-field-house |work=Toledo Blade |title=Boykins gets last word against UT |accessdate=2009-09-10 |date=1998-02-26 |last=Hackenberg |first=Dave}}&lt;/ref&gt; EMU brought basketball back to the Field House in November 2013, where the men's team played local rival [[Concordia University (Michigan)|Concordia University]] as well as [[Robert Morris University|Robert Morris]], while the women's team hosted [[Butler University|Butler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emueagles.com/news/2013/8/28/MBB_0828130329.aspx |work=EMUeagles.com |title=EMU Basketball Heads Back to Bowen |accessdate=2013-10-10 |date=2013-08-31 |last=Athletics |first=EMU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 4, 1995, during halftime of a basketball game against [[San Francisco State]], more than 50 EMU students took the court for an hour to protest the arrest a month earlier of a black student by a white police officer at a residence hall. Approximately 1,300 spectators were ushered out of the Field House, and the second half of the game was played in the empty arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NF0RAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=v4cDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5180,3411717&amp;dq=bowen-field-house |title=Protest delays EMU game |accessdate=2009-09-10 |date=1995-12-05 |work=The Bryan Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Thursday, October 31, 1996, President [[Bill Clinton]] used a conference on women and business and a speech at the Field House to announce the expansion of a [[Small Business Administration]] program to help women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/31/us/clinton-opens-hard-charge-in-drive-for-majority-of-vote.html |accessdate=2009-09-10 |date=1996-10-31 |title=Clinton Opens Hard Charge In Drive for Majority of Vote |last=Purdum |first=Todd S. |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ETSU/Mountain States Health Alliance Athletic Center''', previously known as the '''Memorial Center''', and popularly referred to as the "Mini-Dome", is an 8,539-seat multi-purpose [[arena]] on the campus of [[East Tennessee State University]] in [[Johnson City, Tennessee]]. Until 2014, it hosted [[East Tennessee State Buccaneers men's basketball|ETSU's men's]] and women's basketball teams. It also serves as the indoor venue for tennis and track. At one time, the facility also hosted [[East Tennessee State Buccaneers football|ETSU's football]] team, but the school discontinued its [[American football|football]] program at the end of the 2003 season as a cost-cutting measure. The football team was reinstated in 2015, but did not return to the facility; the Buccaneers played the 2015 and 2016 seasons at [[Kermit Tipton Stadium]], a local high school facility, before opening the new [[William B. Greene Jr. Stadium]] in 2017. It was the host of the 2006 and 2007 [[Atlantic Sun Conference]] men's basketball tournaments, and the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]] Indoor Track and Field Championships from 2001 to 2011.   The Mini-Dome has also hosted non-athletic events that could not be housed in an indoor setting on most American college campuses, such as national indoor championships for [[Free flight (model aircraft)|free flight]] [[model aircraft]].

In December 2009, the [[Tennessee Board of Regents]] approved the renaming of Memorial Center to ETSU/Mountain States Health Alliance Athletic Center, adding the name of the hospital system headquartered in Johnson City to the official name of the Mini-Dome.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johnsoncitypress.com/News/article.php?ID=72670 Johnson City Press: Mini-Dome has new name. 3 December 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 16, 2010, the ETSU/MSHA Athletic Center hosted a [[National Basketball Association]] exhibition game between the [[New Orleans Pelicans|New Orleans Hornets]] and [[Atlanta Hawks]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etsubucs.com/sports/mbball/release.asp?RELEASE_ID=12102 ETSU Athletics, International Storytelling Center set to host NBA exhibition game Oct. 16, 2010. 3 December 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Dominating the campus skyline, the building was opened in 1977 largely as an attempt to increase attendance at the university's struggling [[college football|football]] program and to help its recruiting, but also as a large, multi-purpose campus building.  The contract ran both well over budget and the allotted time, with the eventual opening occurring two football seasons later than had been planned.

The building has had its successes but never truly put the Buccaneer football program on the map, despite being one of very few on-campus domed stadiums in the United States.  The decision was made by ETSU president Dr. Paul Stanton for ETSU to drop football following the conclusion of the 2003 season.

For the 2006–2007 academic year and basketball season, the Mini-Dome's occupancy was decreased to around 6,800 due to fire code restrictions.  Efforts are underway to build a true basketball arena on campus, but the Mini-Dome will likely remain intact due to the large number of offices and training facilities it contains, as well as the enormous cost of demolition.

In 2006–2007, ETSU made an attempt to bring back the football program, but it failed when the student body voted down an increase in the athletic fee that was needed to fund it.  The Mini-Dome was not considered as a possible venue for the new program. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://basketballninja.com/best-indoor-basketball/| title=indoor basketball  }} Wednesday, 11 January 2017 &lt;/ref&gt;

The interior of the Mini-Dome is pictured briefly in the ending moments of the film ''[[We Are Marshall]]'' during a sequence of highlights of the [[Marshall University]] football team.

An '''eight-ender''', also called a '''snowman''', is a perfect score within a single end of [[curling]]. In an end, both sides throw eight rocks, and in an eight-ender, all eight rocks from one team score points.

Eight-enders are extremely rare in competitive curling and are analogous to a [[Perfect game|perfect game in baseball]] or a [[Perfect game (bowling)|perfect game in bowling]] (300). Eight-enders are so rare that the [[Canadian Curling Association]] has an eight-ender award to recognize any eight-ender scored in [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.curling.ca/about-the-organization/awards-and-certificates/eight-ender-awards/|title=About the CCA – Awards and Certificates – Eight Ender Awards|publisher=[[Canadian Curling Association]]|accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 Asham Curling Supplies awarded an $8000 prize randomly to one of the 145 teams that registered an eight-ender in the [[2005–06 curling season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://curlnews.blogspot.com/2007/01/8000-for-curling-8-ender.html|title=$8,000 for a curling 8-ender|date=19 January 2007|publisher=''The Curling News'' Blog Archive|accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The eight-ender in team curling is analogous to the six-ender in [[mixed doubles curling]], as there is a total of six rocks in play per team instead of eight.

There has never been an eight-ender in [[Olympics|Olympic]] competition, the closest being a 'seven-ender' scored by Scotland's [[Eve Muirhead]] at the [[2014 Winter Olympics]], in a 10-3 [[round-robin tournament|round-robin]] stage victory over the [[USA Curling|USA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/blogs/eh-game/curling-rarity-eve-muirhead-great-britain-hang-seven-181426735.html|title=A curling rarity: Eve Muirhead and Great Britain hang a ‘seven-ender’ on the United States in Olympic curling|publisher=[[Yahoo|Yahoo Sports]]|accessdate=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mixed doubles curling, the maximum score of six has been achieved at the Olympics, with Switzerland's [[Jenny Perret]] and [[Martin Rios]] doing so against the United States in the last end of their 9-4 round-robin win at the [[Curling_at_the_2018_Winter_Olympics_–_Mixed_doubles_tournament|2018 Winter Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Curling - Results|url=https://www.pyeongchang2018.com/en/game-time/results/OWG2018/en/curling/results-mixed-doubles-prel-000302-.htm|website=PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympic Games|publisher=PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympic Games|accessdate=24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occurrences==

===Consecutive eight-enders===
In 1993, the team of Kim Gellard, Corie Beveridge, Lisa Savage, and Sandy Graham recorded two consecutive eight-enders. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weeks|first=Bob|title=Curling, Etcetera: A Whole Bunch of Stuff About the Roaring Game|year=2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Canada, Ltd.|location=Mississauga|isbn=9780470156131|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scott vs King===
{{No refs|date=August 2018}}
Perhaps the most famous eight-ender occurred at the [[2006 Players' Championships]] in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]] on April 15, 2006. The tournament was the final Grand Slam event in the 2005-06 [[Capital One Grand Slam of Curling|Grand Slam of Curling]] and had a [[Canadian dollar|CAD]]$100,000 purse – one of the largest in women's curling.

The match between [[Kelly Scott]], who at the time was the reigning [[Scotties Tournament of Hearts|Canadian women's champion]] and went on to become a [[World Curling Championships|world champion]], and [[Cathy King]] a former world bronze medalist. In the 6th end of their match, King and her rink played rather poorly, while Scott and her rink capitalized on King's mistakes. King ricocheted her final stone out the side of a crowded house, leaving Scott a draw for 8. Although her shot was heavy, Scott's rock came to a stop eighteen inches from the back of the house, enough to score her eighth point.

===Leskiw vs Hamblin===
Another notable eight-ender occurred on January 22, 2011 at the [[MCA Bonspiel]], the world's largest [[bonspiel]]. In this match Leskiw ''stole'' his eight points. In curling, when the team that does not have last rock in the end scores, the points scored are termed as stolen points. In this game, Leskiw managed an eight-ender even though Hamblin had the last rock, which gave him the opportunity to score or prevent Leskiw from scoring eight. In fact, Hamblin knocked Leskiw's eighth rock into the house with his final shot, turning a seven-point end into an eight-ender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.winnipegsun.com/sports/curling/2011/01/23/16997816.html|title=Historic eight-ender a showstopper at the Granite|date=12 January 2011|publisher=[[Winnipeg Sun]]|accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jacobs vs. Phillips===
2014 Olympic champion [[Brad Jacobs (curler)|Brad Jacobs]] scored an eight-ender in the sixth end of the semi final of [[The Dominion 2012 Northern Ontario Men's Curling Championship]] against [[Tim Phillips (curler)|Tim Phillips]] in [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario]]. Jacobs had been leading 6-3 at the time, and had the hammer. After allowing the eight points, the Phillips rink conceded the game. On his last rock, Phillips ricocheted off two Jacobs stones, and out the rings, exposing one of his rocks that had been buried. Jacobs still had to make a delicate hit to ensure the Philips stone was removed, and he had to stick it to score his eight, which he did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dev.curlingzone.com/event.php?eventid=2665&amp;view=Scores&amp;showdrawid=14|title=2012 The Dominion Provincial Championship: Brad Jacobs vs Tim Phillips|publisher=CurlingZone|accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Einarson vs. McLean===
Winnipeg's [[Kerri Einarson]] scored an eight-ender in the seventh end of her first round robin game at the [[2015 Manitoba Scotties Tournament of Hearts]] against [[Tiffany McLean]] of [[Brandon, Manitoba|Brandon]] in [[Winkler, Manitoba|Winkler]] on January 21, 2015. Einarson's rink stole the eight points, after having scored five points the previous end. Einarson won the game by a total score of 16-3. The feat was the first time an eight-ender had been scored at the Manitoba Scotties in recorded history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/sports/curling/Einarson-scores-first-eight-ender-in-Scotties-history-289346401.html|title=Einarson scores first eight ender in Scotties history|date=21 January 2015|publisher=[[Winnipeg Free Press]]|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia vs. Hong Kong===
The Australian men's team (skipped by [[Ian Palangio]]) scored an eight-ender in the first end of their match against Hong Kong ([[John Li]]) at the [[2015 Pacific-Asia Curling Championships]]. The Aussies went on to win the match 16-3, after Hong Kong conceded after seven ends. It was the first international event for Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldcurling.org/pacc2015/session6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prince Edward Island vs. Nunavut===
The Prince Edward Island women's team (skipped by [[Lisa Jackson (curler)|Lisa Jackson]]) scored an eight-ender in the first end of their match against Nunavut (Angela Dale) at the [[2015 Travelers Curling Club Championship]], Canada's national curling club championship. P.E.I. went on to win the match 21-0, with Nunavut conceding after 6 ends (games at the Travelers are 8 ends in length).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.curling.ca/scoreboard/#!/competitions/1680/draws/3770&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first eight-ender ever scored at a national championship in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;http://cornwallcurling.com/2015/11/26/curling-canada-confirms-that-team-peis-eight-ender-is-first-ever-for-a-canadian-chship/&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Korea vs. Qatar===
The South Korean's women's national team skipped by [[Kim Eun-jung (curler)|Kim Eun-jung]] scored an eight-ender in the first end of their match against Qatar (skipped by Mubarkah Al-Abdulla) at the [[2016 Pacific-Asia Curling Championships]]. The Koreans went on to win the match 30-0 with Qatar conceding after six ends. It was the first international event for Qatar.&lt;ref&gt;http://live.ktgsports.com/data/CUR_PACC2016P/Women's_Teams/06~Session_6/C73~~Game_Results_KOR-QAT.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===USA vs. Brazil===
The United States women's national team skipped by [[Nina Roth]] scored an eight-ender in the sixth end of their first match against Brazil (skipped by [[Aline Gonçalves]]) at the [[2017 Americas Challenge]]. The Americans went on to win the game 16-2 with the Brazilians immediately conceding after the 6th end. It was the first international event for the Brazilian women's team.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.teamusa.org/USA-Curling/Features/2017/January/27/USA-women-score-eight-ender-as-Americas-Challenge-begins-in-Duluth&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tardi vs. Schneider===
[[Tyler Tardi]] and his team from [[Langley, British Columbia (city)|Langley]] scored an eight-ender in the second end of their game against Team Stephen Schneider of [[Vancouver]] in their final round robin game at the 2018 [[King Cash Spiel]], an event on the [[World Curling Tour]]. Even though it was just the second end, Team Schneider conceded, losing the game 10-0. Tardi went on to win the event.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldcurl.com/events.php?eventid=5357&amp;view=Scores&amp;showdrawid=9&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Estadio Gaspar Mass''' is an [[artificial turf]] [[stadium]] in [[San Nicolás de los Garza]], Mexico, a city in the [[Monterrey metropolitan area]]. It is primarily used for [[American football]] and is the home field for the [[Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León]] (UANL) [[Auténticos Tigres]]. It has a seating capacity of approximately 16,000.

==History==
The stadium was inaugurated on 24 August 1979&lt;ref name="terra"/&gt; and originally had a capacity of 10,000.{{r|dan}} It is named in honor of [[Gaspar Mass Martínez]] (1916–1999), considered "one of the pioneers of American football in [[Nuevo León]]" and coach of several different UANL teams over the years.&lt;ref name="terra"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.terra.com.mx/deportes/futbol-americano/onefa/onefa-liga-mayor-quien-fue-gaspar-mass,e0eae26621c4d05f1864b2f275425bdbz84sl5ve.html|work=ONEFA (Terra)|date=24 November 2016|accessdate=13 May 2017|title=¿Y quién fue Gaspar Mass?}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the stadium's capacity was expanded to 16,000 with the addition of seats in the south end zone, a project that cost 11 million pesos.&lt;ref name="dan"&gt;{{cite news|work=El Norte|date=14 June 2005|first=Sebastián|last=Moreno|title=Dan más espacio al deporte}}&lt;/ref&gt; Renovations took place prior to the Universiada Nacional in 2015, an event hosted by the UANL, adding improved lighting and a new artificial turf surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=El Norte|date=6 August 2015|title=Mandan Clásico al Gaspar Mass}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has primarily served as the home venue of the Auténticos Tigres, though larger matches, including playoff games and contests against the Tigres' local rival [[Borregos Salvajes]] from the [[Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education]], have traditionally been played at the [[Estadio Universitario (UANL)|Estadio Universitario]]. After a multi-year hiatus due to the split of Mexican college football into two leagues, the city's derby—known as the ''Clásico Regio—''was played again in 2016, but at Gaspar Mass instead of the Estadio Universitario, where it had been held in prior years and attracted attendance figures surpassing 40,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reforma.com/aplicacioneslibre/articulo/default.aspx?id=930012&amp;md5=256a1cfa390446ae84909f0133e9a2b0&amp;ta=0dfdbac11765226904c16cb9ad1b2efe&amp;po=1|date=1 September 2016|work=Reforma|title=Agarrón en el Gaspar Mass|first=Marco|last=Almaraz|accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium also hosted the 2016 ONEFA Championship owing to a schedule conflict with the [[Tigres UANL]] football club that prevented the use of the Estadio Universitario.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reforma.com/aplicacioneslibre/articulo/default.aspx?id=990215&amp;md5=c75a7d403ad5be2b84c17472448d4616&amp;ta=0dfdbac11765226904c16cb9ad1b2efe&amp;po=1|work=Reforma|first=Jesús|last=Carvajal|date=22 November 2016|title=Les gusta en el Gaspar|accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Games between the various preparatory schools operated by the university are also held at the Estadio Gaspar Mass. In 2016, a brawl broke out between fans from rival prep schools after a game in the stadium, resulting in 20 arrests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.multimedios.com/telediario/en-alerta/rina-al-terminar-juego-gaspar.html |date=16 November 2016 |accessdate=13 May 2017 |title=Riña al terminar juego en el Gaspar Mass deja 20 detenidos |work=Multimedios |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119154607/http://www.multimedios.com/telediario/en-alerta/rina-al-terminar-juego-gaspar.html |archivedate=19 November 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, field hockey is generally restricted to spring, summer and early autumn seasons, except in southwestern [[British Columbia]], where it can be played year-round. It is principally a girls' sport in schools, but is played by both men and women in adult leagues across the country. In the late 1990s, registered membership was just over 10,000 (8,200 women and 1,200 men) and the estimated total playing population, including school players, was 30,000.

The modern form of field hockey was first played in Canada in British Columbia. In 1896, the first recorded match in Canada was played by Vancouver girls, and the Vancouver Ladies Club was formed. Men were also playing at the turn of the century in [[Vancouver]] and [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], and a Vancouver League came into existence in 1902. The first women's organization in Canada was formed in Vancouver in 1927.

After [[World War II]], the immigration of players to Canada from all parts of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] influenced the establishment of field hockey across the country, and by 1959 the game was being played in the Maritimes, Ontario and Alberta. The Canadian (men's) Field Hockey Association was founded in 1961; the Canadian Women's FHA a year later. In 1992 the CFHA and the CWFHA merged to form [[Field Hockey Canada]].

International contests have increased markedly since the 1950s. The [[Canada women's national field hockey team|Canadian women's team]] participated in the women's international tournament for the first time in 1956. In 1979 Canada hosted 18 countries in Vancouver for that world event; Canada placed 8th. The 1978 Canadian team was the first to enter the Women's World Cup, placing 5th.

[[File:Fingerhakeln.JPG|thumb|Fingerhakeln without strap]]
'''Fingerhakeln''' is an old athletic sports practiced in many regions, among them the Alps, predominantly Bavaria and Austria&lt;ref&gt;Peter, Ilka: ''Das Ranggeln im Pinzgau.''  Salzburg: Verlag der Salzburger Druckerei 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;, Scandinavia and Finland.

When practicing Fingerhakeln, both opponents are sitting at a table opposite to each other and try to pull the opponent to himself on the finger over the table border. By physical force, overcoming the stretching pain and an appropriate technique, the opponent can be defeated. Usually, the opponents hook the middle fingers in a leather strap, in principle, however, every finger is allowed (except the thumb). Sometimes, also only the index fingers without strap are hooked into each other. Behind both hookers, two ''Auffänger'' (person who catches the opponent) are sitting. Additionally, there is a referee, a chairman and two assessors.

Allegedly, disputes were settled in this way in former times in countries of the Alps. Therefore, it becomes part in the tradition of European forms of sports before a wide standardization took place by gymnastics and sport.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnd Krüger]]: Incorporating traditional games into modern sports. The German Experience. In: E. De Vroede, R. Renson (Hrsg.): ''Proceedings of the 2nd European Seminar on Traditional Games''. Leuven 12 - 16 Sept. 1990. Vlaamse Volkssport Centrale, Löwen 1991, S. 45–54.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Fingerhakeln is an organized sport in its present form. Leather straps (about 10&amp;nbsp;cm long and 6 to 8&amp;nbsp;mm strong), table (79&amp;nbsp;cm high, 74&amp;nbsp;cm wide and 109&amp;nbsp;cm long), stool (40 by 40&amp;nbsp;cm, 48&amp;nbsp;cm high) and distance between the middle line and the sideways lines (32&amp;nbsp;cm) are standardized. Every year, Bavarian, Austrian, German and Alpine championships in different weight and age classes are held.

The proverb ''Jemanden über den Tisch ziehen'' - with the meaning “to defeat, play off against someone” - has its origin in this popular sport in which not the force alone but especially the technique can decide.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5107">[[The Conservation Volunteers]]' '''Green Gym''' programme aims to provide people with a way to enhance their fitness and health while taking action to improve the outdoor environment. It can be seen as enabling people to get fit who would not normally attend a conventional gym or sports centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Green Gym?|url=http://www.tcv.org.uk/greengym/what-green-gym|publisher=The Conservation Volunteers|accessdate=21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Organization==
As of 2006 the majority of Green Gym groups are run directly by The Conservation Volunteers, the community volunteering charity. The rest are either self-supporting or run under licence by other organisations. A Green Gym Licence Agreement provides the framework for an organisation to run a Green Gym project. The Conservation Volunteers provides a high level of support to help start up and run a Green Gym project to The Conservation Volunteers standards. Under the Licence Agreement, organisations have the right to use the Green Gym name, and receive guidance and, if necessary, training on how to run a Green Gym group. The Licence Agreement may be renewed annually by mutual agreement.

==Origins and development==
The Green Gym concept was originally developed in the late 1990s by Dr [[William Bird (doctor)|William Bird]] an [[Oxford]]-based [[general practitioner]] and The Conservation Volunteers (then BTCV). The first pilot was held in 1997. By 2006 there were 55 projects across the [[United Kingdom]] with an estimated 6,000 people taking part. The programme has received support from central government,&lt;ref&gt;Department for Communities and Local Government - Special Grants Programme  [http://www.communities.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1127922]&lt;/ref&gt; and won a Charity Award in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charityawards.co.uk/previous/2005/winners/animals/ Charity Awards 2005, Animals and the Environment]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Green Gym sessions==

===What happens===
Green Gym groups meet at least once a week and do between 1 and 4 hours practical conservation or gardening work. All participants are Volunteers.  Over two-thirds have never taken part in [[environmental conservation]] work before.  Examples of the types of work undertaken include [[coppicing]], clearing [[scrubland]], path building, tree-planting or digging on an [[Allotment (gardening)|allotment]].

The group usually meets at the project site. Sessions include a refreshment break and a chance to socialise. Activities are led by a qualified leader, and a session will typically run as follows:

# 'Tool Talk' - the safe handling and correct use of tools are discussed
# Warm up - exercises to prepare muscles for activity and reduce the risk of injury
# Work session
# Refreshments
# Work session
# Gather up tools
# Cool down - exercises to prevent stiffness

===Health benefits===
Both physical and psychological benefits are claimed for people who attend Green Gym sessions regularly.&lt;ref&gt;''Natural Fit:
Can Green Space and Biodiversity Increase Levels of Physical Activity?'' A Report by Dr William Bird for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, 2004 [http://www.rspb.org.uk/Images/natural_fit_full_version_tcm5-60619.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 and 2001, The School of Health and Social Care at [[Oxford Brookes University]] independently evaluated the Green Gym projects in [[Oxfordshire]]&lt;ref&gt;''The Green Gym: An Evaluation of a Pilot Project in Sonning Common, Oxfordshire'' Reynolds, Veronica, Oxford Brookes University, 1999, Research Report No. 8, ISBN No: 1 902606 05 1&lt;/ref&gt; and [[East Sussex]],&lt;ref&gt;''Well-being Comes Naturally: An Evaluation of the BTCV Green Gym at Portslade, East Sussex'' Reynolds, Veronica, Oxford Brookes University, 2002, Research Report no: 17, ISBN No: 1 902606 15 9&lt;/ref&gt; England and identified the following benefits from Green Gym tasks:

* significant improvements in cardiovascular fitness, provided that they are performed regularly.
* improved muscular strength (as measured by handgrip strength) leading to increased coping ability and reduced risk of functional limitations in later life.
* almost a third more calories can be burnt in an hour of some Green Gym activities than in doing a step aerobics class.
* a significant improvement in the Mental Health Component Score in the first 3 months of participation (as measured by the SF-12 health-related quality of life instrument).
* a strong trend in the decrease in depression scores during the same time period.
* waist-to-hip ratio decrease in the first three months.
* The Green Gym is viewed by participants as being beneficial to their mental health and wellbeing.

'''Head N.V.''' is an American-Dutch sports and clothing company, which sells [[alpine skiing|alpine]] [[skiing]] and [[tennis]] equipment. The company includes parts of several previously independent companies, including Head Ski Company, founded in [[Delaware]], United States, in 1950; Tyrolia, an Austrian ski-equipment manufacturer; and Mares, an Italian manufacturer of diving equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/head-n-v-history/|title=Head N.V. History|accessdate=March 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Head Ski Company produced one of the first successful metal-wood [[composite material|composite]] [[Ski#Alpine|downhill ski]], the [[Head Standard]], and one of the first oversized metal tennis rackets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amhistory.si.edu/sports/exhibit/removers/tennis/index.cfm|title=Howard Head: Ski and Racquet Revolutionary|accessdate=March 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company is headquartered in Amsterdam, Netherlands.

==History==

{{Refimprove section|date=August 2017}}

Head N.V. was founded in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], United States, in 1950 by aeronautical engineer [[Howard Head]], after he took a ski trip and was astonished to see his skis were made of wood in an era when metals and plastics were replacing wood in many product designs. Head worked at the [[Glenn L. Martin Company]] where they used a form of aluminum and plastic laminate to build the fuselages of aircraft, and he felt the same material would make an ideal ski. After two years of constantly breaking skis, by the winter of 1950 they had a design that not only stayed together, but made turning dramatically easier.

The [[Head Standard]] would rapidly grow in sales through the 1950s, until it and other Head designs were capturing over 50% of the US market during the 1960s, making them the leading ski manufacturer in the U.S. and the UK. Head resisted the change to fibreglass construction. In 1967, Howard Head hired Harold Seigle as company president, and became the [[Chair (official)|Chairman of the Board]] and [[CEO]]. Bored of the results, in 1969 Head sold the company to the [[American Machinery and Foundry|AMF]], and took up tennis. He later bought a controlling interest in [[Prince Sports]].

In the late 1960s, a [[tennis]] division was created when Howard Head figured out a way of strengthening the [[tennis racket]] by introducing the [[aluminium]] frame. The idea became a success and was first introduced in the 1969 [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]]. After Howard Head's departure, one of the tennis players that Head sponsored, [[Arthur Ashe]], won [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], defeating favored [[Jimmy Connors]] in 1975. Also during the 1970s, Head acquired a diving manufacturer, Mares, and a [[ski binding]] company, Tyrolia. While under AMF ownership, Head manufactured tennis racquets in [[Boulder, Colorado]], and Kennelbach, Austria. Also in 1969, Head signed [[Alpine skiing at the 1968 Winter Olympics|Olympic]] champion ski racer [[Jean-Claude Killy]] to endorse a new metal and [[fiberglass]] ski, the Killy 800. Head subsequently developed an entire product line of Killy skis.

In 1985, [[Minneapolis]]-based Minstar Inc. acquired Head through hostile takeover of AMF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= AMF Agrees to Offer By Jacobs of $24 a Share |first= Lee A. |last= Daniels |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/15/business/amf-agrees-to-offer-by-jacobs-of-24-a-share.html |newspaper= The New York Times |date= 15 June 1985 |accessdate=27 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, Head started making athletic footwear, and introduced the "Radial Tennis Shoes". The following year, Head opened a new plant in Austria in order to produce more tennis rackets. In 1989, management bought out Head, Tyrolia, and Mares, to form HTM. The takeover was backed by private equity firm [[Freeman Spogli &amp; Co.]] In 1993, HTM was sold to tobacco conglomerate Austria Tabak. [[Johan Eliasch]], the current chairman, took over the company in 1995, which in 2014 was a Netherlands Antilles corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.head.com/fileadmin/user_upload/Corporate/Head_-_Annual_Report_2014_bw.pdf|title=http://www.head.com/fileadmin/user_upload/Corporate/Head_-_Annual_Report_2014_bw.pdf|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Head created the first [[titanium]] and [[graphite]] tennis racket. Over the next two years, Head acquired three more companies, [[Dacor (scuba diving)|DACOR]], BLAX, and [[Penn Racquet Sports]]. Penn tennis balls are used in many high-profile tournaments worldwide, while Penn racquetballs are the official balls of the IRT and U.S. Racquetball Association. Penn once produced tennis balls and racquetballs in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. In March 2009, Head shut down the Penn ball manufacturing factory. Now all tennis balls are produced in China.

Head also licenses its brand to makers of clothing apparel (including shoes), accessories, bicycles, skates, watches, balls and fitness Equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.head.com/corporate/licenses.php|title=About|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Head proved to be successful in [[2012 in tennis|2012]], with three Major winners during the year: [[Novak Djokovic]] at the [[2012 Australian Open|Australian Open]], [[Maria Sharapova]] at the [[2012 French Open|French Open]] and [[Andy Murray]] at the [[2012 US Open (tennis)|US Open]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.head.com/tennis/news/?region=us&amp;id=2632|title=Tennis|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''heptathlon''' is a [[track and field]] combined events contest made up of seven events.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/heptathlon |title=Heptathlon – Definition|publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name derives from the Greek ''hepta'' (seven) and ἄθλος (áthlos, or ἄθλον, áthlon, meaning "feat"). A competitor in a heptathlon is referred to as a heptathlete.

There are two heptathlons – the women's heptathlon and the men's – composed of different events. The men's heptathlon is older and is held indoors, while the women's is held outdoors and was introduced in the 1980s, first appearing in the [[Olympics]] in 1984.

==Women's heptathlon==
[[File:JessicaEnnis 800m Heptatlon London2012 3.JPG|thumb|350px |[[Tatyana Chernova]], [[Jessica Ennis-Hill|Jessica Ennis]] and [[Lilli Schwarzkopf]] racing in the final 800&amp;nbsp;m event at the [[Athletics at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Women's heptathlon|2012 Olympic heptathlon]]]]
Women's heptathlon is the combined event for women contested in the [[Athletics at the Summer Olympics|athletics programme]] of the Olympics and at the [[IAAF World Championships in Athletics|IAAF World Championships]]. The [[IAAF Combined Events Challenge]] determines a yearly women's heptathlon champion. The women's outdoor heptathlon consists of the following events, with the first four contested on the first day, and the remaining three on day two:

* [[100 metres hurdles]]
* [[High jump]]
* [[Shot put]]
* [[200 metres]]
* [[Long jump]]
* [[Javelin throw]] 
* [[800 metres]]

The heptathlon has been contested by female athletes since the early 1980s, when it replaced the [[Women's pentathlon|pentathlon]] as the primary women's combined event contest (the javelin throw and 800 m were added).{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}  It was first contested at the Olympic level in the [[1984 Summer Olympics]]. In recent years some women's [[decathlon]] competitions have been conducted, consisting of the same events as the men's competition in a slightly different order, and the IAAF has begun keeping records for it, but the heptathlon remains the championship-level combined event for women. [[Nafissatou Thiam]], representing Belgium, is the [[Athletics at the 2016 Summer Olympics|2016 Olympic Gold Medallist]] and the [[2017 World Championships in Athletics|2017 World Champion]].

There is also a [[Tetradecathlon]], which is a double heptathlon, consisting of 14 events, seven events per day.

===Points system===
The heptathlon scoring system was devised by Dr Karl Ulbrich, a Viennese mathematician. The formulae are constructed so that, for each event, a designated "standard" performance (for example, approximately 1.82&amp;nbsp;m for the high jump) scores 1000 points.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/03/london-2012-jessica-ennis-heptathlon "London 2012: Jessica Ennis leads heptathlon after first day"], ''The Guardian'',  3 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Each event also has a minimum recordable performance level (e.g. 0.75&amp;nbsp;m for the high jump), corresponding to zero points. The formulae are devised so that successive constant increments in performance correspond to gradually increasing increments in points awarded.

|}
The events are split into three groups, and the scores are calculated according to the three formulae:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:Running events (200 m, 800 m and 100 m hurdles):
::&lt;math&gt;P = a \cdot (b - T)^c&lt;/math&gt;
:Jumping events (high jump and long jump):
::&lt;math&gt;P = a \cdot (M - b)^c&lt;/math&gt;
:Throwing events (shot put and javelin):
::&lt;math&gt;P = a \cdot (D - b)^c&lt;/math&gt;

'''P''' is for points, '''T''' is for time in seconds, '''M''' is for height or length in centimeters and '''D''' is length in meters. '''a''', '''b''' and '''c''' have different values for each of the events (see table).

The other version is an indoor competition, normally contested by men only. It is the men's combined event in the [[IAAF World Indoor Championships in Athletics]]. The men's indoor heptathlon consists of the following events, with the first four contested on the first day, and remaining three on day two:

* [[60 metres]]
* [[long jump]]
* [[shot put]]
* [[high jump]]
* [[60 metres hurdles]]
* [[pole vault]]
* [[1000 metres]]

The scoring is similar for both versions. In each event, the athlete scores points for his/her performance in each event according to scoring tables issued by the [[International Association of Athletics Federations]] (IAAF).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaaf.org/mm/Document/Competitions/TechnicalArea/ScoringTables_CE_744.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910115455/http://www.iaaf.org/mm/Document/Competitions/TechnicalArea/ScoringTables_CE_744.pdf |date=September 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The athlete accumulating the highest number of points wins the competition.

In [[baseball]], a '''hitting streak''' is the number of consecutive official games in which a player appears and gets at least one [[hit (baseball)|base hit]]. According to the [[Official Baseball Rules]], such a streak is not necessarliy ended when a player has at least 1 plate appearance and no hits. A streak shall not be terminated if all official plate appearances result in a base on balls, hit by pitch, defensive interference or a sacrifice bunt. The streak shall terminate if the player has a [[sacrifice fly]] and no hit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://mlb.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/mlb/official_info/official_rules/official_scorer_10.jsp | title= Official Rules: 10.00 The Official Scorer | publisher=[[Major League Baseball]] | accessdate=August 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joe DiMaggio]] holds the [[Major League Baseball]] record with a streak of 56 consecutive games in 1941 which began on May 15 and ended July 17. DiMaggio [[Batting average#Major League Baseball|hit]] .408 during his streak (91-for-223), with 15 [[home run]]s and 55 [[runs batted in]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/feats/feats3.shtml | title=Joe DiMaggio Hitting Streak by Baseball Almanac | work=[[Baseball Almanac]] | accessdate=August 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major League Baseball records==
{{see also|List of Major League Baseball records considered unbreakable}}
There have been 55 occurrences in [[Major League Baseball]] where a player had a hitting streak of at least 30 games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/feats/feats-streak.shtml|title=Consecutive Games Hitting Streaks: 30+ Game Hitting Streaks in Baseball|author=|date=|website=www.baseball-almanac.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple streaks in the same season have occurred in 1922 ([[George Sisler]] and [[Rogers Hornsby]]), 1987 ([[Paul Molitor]] and [[Benito Santiago]]), 1997 ([[Nomar Garciaparra]] and [[Sandy Alomar, Jr.]]), 1999 ([[Vladimir Guerrero]] and [[Luis Gonzalez (outfielder)|Luis Gonzalez]]), 2006 ([[Chase Utley]] and [[Willy Taveras]]), and 2011 ([[Andre Ethier]] and [[Dan Uggla]]). In addition, 1924 included one whole streak ([[Sam Rice]]) and the beginning of another ([[George Sisler]]). A similar event occurred in 2006 with two whole streaks ([[Chase Utley|Utley]] and [[Willy Taveras|Taveras]]) and the end of another ([[Jimmy Rollins]]).

Keeler's streak started in his final game of the 1896 season, and continued through the first 44 games of the 1897 season. Rollins ended the 2005 season with a 36-game streak and extended it through the first two games of the 2006 season. Sisler had a hit in the last game of 1924 and the first 34 games of 1925.  Major League Baseball recognizes two hitting streak records: Longest hitting streak in one season, and longest hitting streak over multiple seasons (e.g. Rollins 2005–2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/mlb/news/story?id=2178924|title=Phillies' Rollins extends streak to 36 games|author=|date=2 October 2005|website=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keeler's, Sisler's, and Rollins' streaks are listed as 44, 34, and 36 games when discussing ''single-season'' streaks, and 45, 35, and 38 games when discussing ''multiple-season'' streaks.

This list omits [[Denny Lyons]] of the 1887 [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] [[Philadelphia Athletics (American Association)|Philadelphia Athletics]], who had a 52-game hitting streak.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=Hitting Streaks, 30 Games or More | accessdate=August 7, 2011| url=http://www.thebaseballpage.com/stats/lists_feats/30game_hit_streaks.htm | archive-url=https://archive.is/20060409094305/http://www.thebaseballpage.com/stats/lists_feats/30game_hit_streaks.htm | dead-url=yes | archive-date=April 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[1887 in baseball|1887]], the major leagues adopted a new rule which counted [[base on balls|walks]] as hits, a rule which was dropped after that season. Lyons hit in 52 consecutive games that season, but his streak included two games (#22 and #44) in which his only "hits" were walks. In [[1968 in baseball|1968]], MLB ruled that walks in 1887 would not be counted as hits, so Lyons' streak was no longer recognized, though it still appears on some lists. In 2000 Major League Baseball reversed its 1968 decision, ruling that the statistics which were recognized in each year's official records should stand, even in cases where they were later proven incorrect. Paradoxically, the ruling affects only hit ''totals'' for the year; the batting champion for the year is not recognized as the all-time leader despite having the highest single-season average under the ruling, and Lyons' hitting streak is not recognized.

Ty Cobb, Sam Rice, and George Sisler are the only players with multiple streaks of 30 games or longer.

There have been 129 single-season streaks of 25 games or more. The lowest [[batting average]] ever recorded during a hitting streak of 25 games or more was .304 by [[Bruce Campbell (baseball)|Bruce Campbell]] in [[1938 in baseball|1938]]. The highest was .486 during [[Chuck Klein]]'s streak in [[1930 in baseball|1930]]. Joe DiMaggio hit .408 during his record-holding 56 game streak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/07/sports/baseball/for-the-braves-uggla-luck-is-not-a-statistic.html|title=For the Braves’ Uggla, Luck Is Not a Statistic|first=Rob|last=Neyer|date=6 August 2011|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In probability theory, every baseball game is a [[Bernoulli trial]] in which a hitter either does or does not get a hit.  DiMaggio's streak of 56 consecutive games with hits awaits an equal streak: "The probability is .0003 that a .350 hitter will have a hitting streak of at least 56 games in a season. If there are about 4 such seasons per year in the future, we would expect to see such a streak, assuming the Bernoulli trials model, every 1/(.0003 x 4) = 833 years."&lt;ref&gt;C.M. Grinstead, W.P. Peterson &amp; [[J. Laurie Snell]] (2011) ''Probability Tales'', page 37, [[American Mathematical Society]] {{ISBN|978-0-8218-5261-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major League Baseball records by franchise==

'''Horseed FC''' is a [[Somalia|Somali]] [[football (soccer)|football]] club based in [[Horseed]], [[Somalia]]. It is seven times champion of the [[Somalia League]]. A team of the Armed Forces of Somalia, Horseed SC was among the most formidable and recognized football clubs in the country. After the civil war broke out, it discontinued operations, but has been revived in 2013 by Gen Dahir Aden elmi Commander of the Somalia Armed Forces. Gen Elmi revived all the different teams of Horseed Sports Club with emphasis on the Football Team which again began to compete in the Somalia Serie A league.
In 2017, Col Ahmed Mohamed Hassan, a young energetic officer of the Somalia General Staff Officer Corps was appointed as its chairman, and since then the club has seen positive changes and developments which have catapulted the club to regain its former glory.

'''Ice yachting''' is the sport of sailing and racing [[iceboat]]s, also called [[ice]] [[yacht]]s.

== International popularity ==
Ice yachting is practiced in Austria, Germany, Great Britain, Poland, Norway and Sweden, to some extent, and is very popular in the Netherlands and on the [[Gulf of Finland]], but its highest development is in the United States and Canada. The Dutch ice yacht is a flat-bottomed boat resting crosswise upon a [[Plank (wood)|plank]]ing about three feet wide and sixteen long, to which are affixed four steel runners, one each at [[bow (ship)|bow]], [[stern]] and each end of the planking. The [[rudder]] is a fifth runner fixed to a tiller. Heavy [[mainsail]]s and [[jib]]s are generally used and the boat is built more for safety than for speed. The iceboat of the Gulf of Finland is a V-shaped frame with a heavy plank running from bow to stern, in which the [[Mast (sailing)|mast]] is stepped. The stern or steering runner is worked by a tiller or wheel. The [[sail]] is a large [[lug sail|lug]] and the [[Boom (sailing)|boom]] and [[Spar (sailing)|gaff]] are attached to the mast by travelers. The passengers sit upon planks or [[rope]] netting. The Russian boats were faster than the Dutch-built ice yachts.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Ice-Yachting |volume=14 |pages=241–242 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== 18th century ===
Ice Yachting was born in Europe, but by 1790 the sport was in vogue on the [[Hudson River]], its headquarters being in [[Poughkeepsie (city), New York|Poughkeepsie, New York]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hvmag.com/core/pagetools.php?pageid=10755&amp;url=/Hudson-Valley-Magazine/December-2013/A-History-of-Ice-Yachting-in-the-Hudson-Valley/&amp;mode=print|title={{!}} A History of Ice Yachting in the Hudson Valley|website=www.hvmag.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boat was a square box on three runners, the two forward runners being nailed to the box and the third acting as a rudder operated by a tiller. This type of boat was first built in 1790 by Oliver Booth of Poughkeepsie. At this time, during the early days of the sport, it was an activity for the masses and not only for the wealthy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

=== 19th century ===
The above primitive style was in general use until 1853, when triangular frames with boxes for the crew aft and jib and mainsail rig were introduced. Also at this time, the 1850s, ice yacht clubs were formed in [[Newburgh, New York|Newburgh]], [[New Hamburg, New York|New Hamburg]], Poughkeepsie, and [[Hyde Park, New York|Hyde Park]]. Members of the various clubs competed to win races such as the Ice yacht Challnge Pennant of America and the Captain William Drake Flag. They also raced against the newly introduced trains that began running along the Hudson River. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

A heavy, hard-riding type soon developed, with short gaffs, low sails, large jibs and booms extending far over the stern. It was over-[[canvas]]sed and the mast was stepped directly over the runner plank, bringing the centre of sail-balance so far aft that the boats were apt to run away, and the [[Over-canvassed sailing|over-canvass]]ing frequently caused the windward runner to swing up into the air to a dangerous height. The largest and fastest example of this type, which prevailed until 1879, was Commodore John. E. Roosevelt's first ''Icicle'', which measured {{convert|69|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} overall and carried {{convert|1070|sqft|m2|0|abbr=on}} of canvas. The ''Icicle'' once beat the Chicago Express on its run from Poughkeepsie to [[Ossining (village), New York|Ossining]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

J.E. Roosevelt founded the Hudson River Ice Yacht Club in 1869. A 46-foot version of the ''Icicle'' recorded a speed of over 100 miles per hour.&lt;ref name="Forbes:As The Hudson River Freezes, Classic Ice Yachts Emerge" /&gt; 

In 1879, H. Relyea built the ''Robert Scott'', which had a single backbone and [[guy wire]]s, and it became the model for all Hudson River ice yachts. Masts were now stepped farther forward, jibs were shortened, booms were cut down, and the center of sail-balance was brought more inboard and higher up, causing the centers of effort and resistance to come more in harmony. The shallow steering-box became [[elliptical]]. 

The first race for the American Challenge Pennant occurred in 1881, which represents the championship of the Hudson River. The clubs that competed included the [[Hudson River]], North Shrewsbury, [[Orange Lake (New York)|Orange Lake]], [[Newburgh, New York|Newburgh]] and [[Carthage, New York|Carthage]] Ice Yacht Clubs. The races are usually sailed five times round a triangle of which each leg measures one mile, at least two of the legs being to windward. 

=== 20th century ===
In 1911 modern ice yachts were made of a single-piece backbone the entire length of the boat, and a runner-plank upon which it rests at right angles, the two forming a [[kite (geometry)|kite]]-shaped frame. The best woods for these pieces are [[basswood]], [[butternut (tree)|butternut]], and [[pine]]. They are cut from the log in such a way that the heart of the timber expands, giving the planks a permanent curve, which, in the finished boat, is turned upward. The two forward runners, usually made of soft [[cast iron]] and about {{convert|2.7|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}. long and {{convert|24|in|cm|0}} high, are set into oak frames a little over 5&amp;nbsp;feet long and 5&amp;nbsp;inches high. The runners have a cutting edge of 90%, though a V-shaped edge is often preferred for racing. The rudder is a runner about {{convert|3.7|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}. long, worked by a tiller, sometimes made very long, 7½&amp;nbsp;feet not being uncommon. This enables the [[helmsman]] to lie in the box at full length and steer with his feet, leaving his hands free to tend the sheet. Masts and spars are generally made hollow for racing-yachts and the rigging is pliable steel wire. The sails are of 10-ounce duck for a boat carrying {{convert|400|sqft|m2|-1|abbr=on}} of canvas. They have very high peaks, short hoists and long booms. The mainsail and jib rig is general, but a double-masted lateen rig has been found advantageous. The foremost ice-yacht builder of America was G. E. Buckhout of Poughkeepsie.&lt;ref name="EB1911" /&gt;

[[File:icesailing.jpg|300px|right|thumb| Ice sailing on Lake Balaton]]

An ice yacht is about {{convert|40|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} in length and can carry six or seven passengers or crew, who are distributed in such a manner as to preserve the balance of the boat. In a good breeze the crew lie out on the windward side of the runner-plank to balance the boat, and reduce the [[pressure]] on the leeward runner. A course of {{convert|20|mi|km|0}} with many turns has been sailed on the Hudson in less than 48 minutes, the record for a measured mile with flying start being at the rate of about {{convert|72|mi|km|0}} an hour. In a high wind, however, ice yachts often move at the rate of 85 and even {{convert|90|mi|km|0}} an hour.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

On the [[headlands and bays|bays]] near New York, a peculiar kind of iceboat has developed, called scooter, which may be described as a toboggan with a sail. A typical scooter is about {{convert|15|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} long with an extreme beam of {{convert|5|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}, perfectly oval in form and flat. It has mainsail and jib carried on a mast 9 or 10&amp;nbsp;feet long and set well aft, and is provided with two long parallel metal runners. There is no rudder, the scooter being steered entirely by trimming the sails, particularly the jib. As the craft is flat and [[buoyant]], it sails well in water, and can thus be used on very thin ice without danger. A speed of {{convert|50|km/h|abbr=on}} has been attained by a scooter.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

== Classes of ice yachts ==
In the early 20th century ice yachts were divided into four classes, carrying respectively {{convert|600|sqft|m2|-1|abbr=on}} of canvas or more, between 450 and 600, between 300 and 450, and less than {{convert|300|sqft|m2|-1|abbr=on}}. In the 1930s the Detroit News held a competition to design an inexpensive iceboat for ordinary (not wealthy) citizens. A new type of boat, known at the DN, resulted.&lt;ref name="Forbes:As The Hudson River Freezes, Classic Ice Yachts Emerge"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fisher|first1=Daniel|title=As The Hudson River Freezes, Classic Ice Yachts Emerge|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielfisher/2014/03/07/as-the-hudson-river-freezes-over-classic-ice-yachts-emerge/#604ec0391212|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=21 February 2018|date=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prevalent yachts used today are known as "stern-steerers" because of the skate in the back which is used to steer them. They have a long central beam, often hollow, clamped to large runner planks close to the mast that carry the forward skates. The sailors ride in an oval pod at the stern, which often has elegant varnished rails and turned stiles. One sailor steers and the other works the sheets, or control lines for the sails. &lt;ref name="Forbes:As The Hudson River Freezes, Classic Ice Yachts Emerge" /&gt;

== North American ice yachting ==
Ice yachting is very popular on the [[Great Lakes]], both in the United States and Canada, the [[Kingston, Ontario]] Club having a fleet of over 25 sail. Other important centers of the sport are the Lake Geneva, Wisconsin area, with an average of twenty-five sailing days a season for the last five years, Lakes [[Lake Minnetonka|Minnetonka]] and [[White Bear Lake, Minnesota|White Bear]] in [[Minnesota]], Lakes [[Lake Winnebago|Winnebago]] and [[Lake Pepin|Pepin]] in [[Wisconsin]], Bar Harbor Lake in [[Maine]], the [[St. Lawrence River]], Quinte Bay and [[Lake Champlain]].&lt;ref name="EB1911" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2650">In [[chess]], '''International Arbiter''' is a title awarded by [[FIDE]] to individuals deemed capable of acting as arbiter in important chess matches. The arbiters are responsible for ensuring the rules and laws of chess are adhered to. The title was established in 1951.

Requirements for the title to be awarded are detailed in section B.06 of the FIDE Handbook. As well as thorough knowledge of the [[rules of chess|laws of chess]] and a proved impartiality, they include the ability to speak a FIDE-approved language and previous experience as an arbiter in important tournaments. The [[FIDE]] World Chess Federation displays the list of International Arbiters with their ID numbers, name, and title on its official web site.

Some individuals have had careers as strong players and later become International Arbiters. Notable examples include:
* [[Albéric O'Kelly de Galway]], [[Grandmaster (chess)|Grandmaster]] who was third [[correspondence chess]] world champion before becoming an International Arbiter in 1962 and acting as Chief Arbiter at the [[World Chess Championship 1966|1966]] and [[World Chess Championship 1969|1969]] [[over-the-board]] [[World Chess Championship|World Championship]] matches;
* [[Lothar Schmid]], Grandmaster who finished joint second with the then [[World chess champion|World Champion]] [[Tigran Petrosian]] at Bamberg 1968 and was also a strong correspondence player before becoming an International Arbiter in 1975 and acting as Chief Arbiter in the [[World Chess Championship 1972|1972]], [[World Chess Championship 1978|1978]], and [[World Chess Championship 1986|1986 World Championship]] matches.

'''James Love''' (1721–1774) was the [[pseudonym]] of British poet, playwright and actor '''James Dance'''. He is best known for his poem ''Cricket: An Heroic Poem'' (1744).
  
==Life and work==
Son of [[George Dance the Elder]], who worked as an architect and city surveyor, Love was himself a cricketer, being a member of [[Richmond Cricket Club (18th century)|Richmond Cricket Club]]. Richmond was a leading club in the 1740s and Love may have represented [[Surrey county cricket teams|Surrey]] too. However, no details have survived of his playing career.&lt;ref name=ASW35&gt;{{cite book |last=Ashley-Cooper |first=F. S. |authorlink=F. S. Ashley-Cooper |title=At the Sign of the Wicket: Cricket 1742–1751  |publisher=''Cricket'' magazine |date=20 March 1900 |page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also likely the founder of the Theatre Royal in [[London Borough of Richmond upon Thames|Richmond upon Thames]], which he managed from 1766 to 1773.  In 1763, at [[Drury Lane]] in London, he played the role of [[Falstaff]], for which he became best known as an actor, his authorial pseudonym serving also as his stage name. In 1766 he played his signature role in a new play, [[William Kenrick (writer)|William Kenrick]]'s ''[[Falstaff's Wedding]]'', intended as a sequel to ''[[Henry IV, Part 2]]''. He performed, too, in both [[Dublin]] and [[Edinburgh]], of which he was a sometime manager.  Invited to [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]], in 1762, he retained a connection to it for the rest of his life.

As a writer, Love met success with such Rome-inspired Pantomimes as ''The Witches; or, Harlequin Cherokee'' ([[1762 in literature|1762]]), ''The Rites of Hecate; or, Harlequin from the Moon'' ([[1763 in literature|1763]]) and ''The Hermit; or, Harlequin at Rhodes'' ([[1766 in literature|1766]]), in addition to ''Cricket''.  His earliest work was ''Pamela'' ([[1742 in literature|1742]]).

{{wikisource|Cricket: An Heroic Poem}}
He is famous within sporting circles for his ''Cricket: An Heroic Poem'' (1744), whose line "The strokes re-echo o'er the spacious ground" has been quoted in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.  Its subtitle reads thus: "Illustrated with the Critical Observations of Scriblerus Maximus. To which is Added an Epilogue, call'd 'Bucks Have at Ye All'. Spoken by Mr. King, at the Theatre Royal in Dublin, in the Character of Ranger, in the Suspicious Husband."

On 4 July 1745, the ''Daily Advertiser'' advertised it at 1/-.  A footnote to the publication adds that it was "[p]rinted for W Bickerton at the Gazette in the Temple Exchange near the Inner Temple Gate, Fleet Street."

==Family==
Love was also the brother of [[George Dance the Younger]], who took on the same occupation as his father.  It is probable that both the Younger and the Elder helped to construct the Richmond Theatre.  According to Dorothy Stroud, "references to the building are vague and two of them, while agreeing as to sponsors, differ as to the name of the designer.  A third gives it to [David] [[David Garrick|Garrick]] and it is evident that there was a good deal of confusion as to the various participants."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''Performances at Richmond's Theatre Royale: 15th June 1765'' 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Malta]]''' competed at the '''[[2008 Summer Paralympics]]''' in [[Beijing]], [[China]]. This was the first time in twenty-four years that Malta competed in the games; the last time was at the [[1984 Summer Paralympics]]. The country's delegation consisted of a single competitor, 18-year-old sprinter Antonio Flores. He was a member of [[Pembroke Athleta]] and trained under the club's coach, Jivko Jetchev. Flores left for Beijing on September 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Maltese aspirations at the Paralympics |publisher=DI-VE |date=2008-08-27 |url=http://www.di-ve.com/Default.aspx?ID=65&amp;PID=11&amp;NewsID=53891&amp;Action=1&amp;newscategory=23 |accessdate=2008-08-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
Flores entered only one event - the 100m sprint in the T44 category. He finished 5th out of 6 in his heat, and did not advance to the final.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paralympic.org/Sport/Results/search.html?npc=MLT&amp;gender=all&amp;medal=all&amp;sport=all&amp;games=all Malta at the Paralympics], [[International Paralympic Committee]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2967">'''Marathon mountain bike races''', often referred to as '''[[cross-country cycling|cross-country]] marathon''' ('''XCM'''), are a very demanding form of [[mountain bike racing]] covering at least {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=off}} usually in mountainous terrain. Events held in Europe are typically just a little longer than the average cross country mountain bike race.  Marathon events in the USA and Canada are typically longer than {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=off}} and are very different from cross country races.

==UCI events==

The [[Union Cycliste Internationale|UCI]] has established a championship series for such events, the Marathon World Cup.   The 2014 UCI rules limit events to distances between {{convert|60|km|mi|abbr=on}} and {{convert|160|km|mi|abbr=on}}.  Almost all of the participants are elite professional mountain bike racers. There is an annual [[world championship]] event, the [[UCI Mountain Bike Marathon World Championships]]. The races can be run over as a single or multi-lap course, however, the course cannot cover the same lap more than three times.  

[[File:JMajors900.png|thumb|right|A racer in the Wilderness 101]]

==Non-UCI events==
Non-UCI events routinely cover much longer distances.  The typical event in the USA is either based on time, typically 12 or 24 hours, or distance, the most common being {{convert|100|mi|km}}. Events based on hours typically allow either people to compete individually or as part of the team.  Distance events are almost all solo events. The number of these events and those taking part in them have grown greatly. The first such events began to be held routinely in the early 1990s typically had less than 50 racers. In 2006 nearly 100 events were held and most had more than 150 racers.

The world's largest mountain bike marathon race by the number of participants is the [[Birkebeinerrittet]], {{convert|95|km|mi}}, held annually in Norway. While the distance is short for a marathon mountain bike event, the number of participants and history make it noteworthy.

'''Peaks Ice Arena''' is an indoor [[ice hockey and figure skating]] [[arena]] in [[Provo, Utah|Provo]], [[Utah]], [[United States]], located {{convert|43|mi|km}} south of [[Salt Lake City]]. 
It was built, along with the [[Maverik Center]] (originally known as the E Center) in [[West Valley City, Utah|West Valley City]], to serve as an ice hockey and figure skating practice venue for the [[2002 Winter Olympics]]. It currently serves as the home of the [[BYU Cougars men's ice hockey]] team, Peaks Youth Hockey Association, several high school teams, the Peaks Figure Skating Club, as well as a Learn-to-Skate USA program for beginning skaters of all ages.

==History==
Provo was chosen as the site for an Olympic venue because the leaders of [[Utah County, Utah|Utah County]] refused to support Utah's 1989 Olympic referendum unless they were promised at least one Olympic event would be held in the county. Originally county leaders wanted a speed skating oval built somewhere in Provo or on the campus of [[Utah Valley University]]; others suggested the game's Closing Ceremony could be held at [[Brigham Young University]]'s [[LaVell Edwards Stadium|football stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/52993/UTAH-COUNTY-WONT-BACK-GAMES-UNLESS-IT-CAN-HOST-AN-EVENT.html|title=Utah County won't back games unless it can host and event|last=Morris|first=Michael|newspaper=[[Deseret News]]|publisher=[[Deseret Digital Media]]|location=Salt Lake City|date=28 Jun 1989|accessdate=7 Dec 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the 1989 Olympic referendum passed, and Salt Lake City lost its 1991 bid to host the [[1998 Winter Olympics]], the Utah Sports Authority and Provo City decided to wait until Salt Lake City bid again for the 2002 Winter Olympics before any venue planning would start.

After Salt Lake City won the 2002 Olympic bid in 1995, planning began again for what venue Utah County could host. It was decided that the city of Provo would host the venue, but that it would only be a practice ice sheet, mostly like to be built in the planned [[Provo Towne Centre]] mall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/423329/CITIES-GREET-THE-NEWS-WITH-JUBILATION-WARNING.html|title=Cities greet the news with jubilation, warning|last1=Romboy|first1=Dennis|last2=Edwards|first2=Alan|newspaper=[[Deseret News]]|publisher=[[Deseret Digital Media]]|location=Salt Lake City|date=17 Jun 1995|accessdate=7 Dec 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually plans changed and a larger, yet still only a practice ice facility, was planned to be constructed near Provo's East Bay Golf Course. Utah County, Provo, and [[Salt Lake Organizing Committee for the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games of 2002|SLOC]] all okayed the plans and committed to building the $7.7 million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|7.7|1996|r=2}}&amp;nbsp;million in {{Inflation-year|US}}) facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Utah County to Receive Ice Sheet|author=&lt;!--Staff article, no byline--&gt;|newspaper=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]|location=Salt Lake City|page=D2|date=22 Mar 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in July 1996, before construction had started, the owners of Provo's Seven Peaks Waterpark approached the city and asked that the arena be built on the park's property, and Seven Peaks would pay for an additional ice sheet to be constructed in the same building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/502324/PROVO-TASK-FORCE-AND-7-PEAKS-HAVE-OLYMPIC-DREAMS.html |title=Provo Task Force and 7 Peaks have Olympic dreams|last=Rayburn|first=Jim|newspaper=[[Deseret News]]|publisher=[[Deseret Digital Media]]|location=Salt Lake City|date=18 Jul 1996 |accessdate=7 Dec 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was approved by county officials October 14, 1996, with Provo paying $2 million, Utah County $2 million, SLOC $3 million, and Seven Peaks donating land for the arena and parking spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/519283/SEVEN-PEAKS-RESORT-SKATES-AWAY-WITH-7-MILLION-OLYMPIC-ICE-ARENA.html|title=Seven Peaks Resort skates away with $7 million Olympic Ice Arena |last=Rayburn|first=Jim|newspaper=[[Deseret News]]|publisher=[[Deseret Digital Media]]|location=Salt Lake City|date=15 Oct 1996|accessdate=7 Dec 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Valentiner, Crane, Brunjes, Onyon Architecture was chosen to design the arena.
[[File:Peaks Ice Arena (35890064815).jpg|thumb|left|The additional ice sheet at the Peaks Ice Arena, June 2017]]

On September 17, 1997 ground was broken for construction next to Seven Peaks Waterpark. It was to be {{convert|84000|sqft|m2|sigfig=2}} in size, with two ice sheets side by side. One ice sheet would have seating for about 2,000 spectators while the other would seat 300. By the time ground was broken the price had increased to $8.5 million, $1.5 million more than originally planned; the extra cost would be paid for by Seven Peaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/583542/Big-stink-finally-leads-to-Provo-ice-rinks.html|title=`Big stink' finally leads to Provo ice rinks|last=Romboy|first=Dennis|newspaper=[[Deseret News]]|publisher=[[Deseret Digital Media]]|location=Salt Lake City|date=17 Sep 1997|accessdate=7 Dec 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after construction had begun SLOC decided to host competitive hockey events in the new arena, versus the original plan to use the arena for practices, and using Utah Valley University's [[UCCU Center]] (then known as the McKay Events Center) for the competitions. SLOC would contribute $5.25 million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|5.25|1997|r=3}}&amp;nbsp;million in {{Inflation-year|US}}) towards the project, the cost of which had just jumped to $10.75 million, with the addition of 12 locker rooms instead of four, extra seating, and other minor additions to the original plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/591673/Expansion-of-Peaks-rinks-OKd-for-Games.html|title=Expansion of Peaks rinks OK'd for Games|last=Romboy|first=Dennis|newspaper=[[Deseret News]]|publisher=[[Deseret Digital Media]]|location=Salt Lake City|date=29 Oct 1997|accessdate=7 Dec 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arena opened November 20, 1998 in what was considered a "soft opening", and following the completion of minor work, the arena was supposed to have a grand opening in January or February 1999. But in December 1998 allegations of a scandal involving SLOC members, and members of the [[International Olympic Committee]] concerning the [[2002 Winter Olympic bid scandal|2002 Olympic bid]] surfaced, pushing back the grand opening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/673860/Ice-Sheet-Authority-putting-grand-opening-plans-on-ice-Seven-Peaks-gala-postponed-due-to-SLOC.html|title=Ice Sheet Authority putting grand opening plans on ice|last=Haddock|first=Sharon|newspaper=[[Deseret News]]|publisher=[[Deseret Digital Media]]|location=Salt Lake City|date=12 Jan 1999|accessdate=7 Dec 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the grand opening celebration was held September 29, 1999, and the venue hosted its first event, a hockey game between the [[University of Minnesota]] Duluth Bulldogs and the [[University of Calgary]] Oval Extremes, two days later. The completed arena cost $12.4 million to build, included two ice sheets, had seating for over 2,000 spectators, and was {{convert|110000|sqft|m2|sigfig=2}} in size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/720240/Arena-skates-toward-debut-Provo-facilitys-grand-opening-runs-through-weekend-BR.html|title=Arena skates toward debut Provo facility's grand opening runs through weekend|last=Curreri|first=Frank|newspaper=[[Deseret News]]|publisher=[[Deseret Digital Media]]|location=Salt Lake City|date=29 Sep 1999  |accessdate=7 Dec 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 20, 2008 Provo City took control of the arena from Seven Peaks owner Max Rabner, resolving a lawsuit that had been on going for years over the original construction and management agreements. The arena is now operated by the Parks and Recreation Department of Provo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705264766/Provo-takes-helm-of-Peaks-Ice-Arena.html|title=Provo takes helm of Peaks Ice Arena|last=Dana|first=Jens|newspaper=[[Deseret News]]|publisher=[[Deseret Digital Media]]|location=Salt Lake City|date=21 Nov 1998|accessdate=7 Dec 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2002 Winter Olympics==
[[File:Olympic hockey game peaks arena.jpg|thumb|right|February 2002 Olympic ice hockey game between Austria and Lavia inside the arena]]
During the 2002 games both men's and women's [[Ice hockey at the 2002 Winter Olympics|ice hockey games]] and practices were held in the arena. Because of its original size over 6,000 temporary seats had to be installed to boost the ice center's capacity to 8,400, including press members. 93 percent of tickets were sold, for a total 131,067 of spectators witnessing events in the arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/2002/2002v1.pdf|title=Official Report of the XIX Olympic Winter Games|author=[[Salt Lake Organizing Committee for the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games of 2002|Salt Lake Organizing Committee]]|year=2002|isbn=0-9717961-0-6|page=91|format=PDF|accessdate=7 Dec 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The arena today==
The arena is home to the Peaks Figure Skating Club.  The arena also serves as home ice for the [[American Collegiate Hockey Association|ACHA]] collegiate hockey team of [[Brigham Young University]], and high school teams including Timpanogos, Utah County Independent, Lehi, Payson, Spanish Fork and Springville, as well as the Peaks Youth Hockey Association. The arena is open to the public for ice skating, skating lessons, and can even be used for indoor soccer games.

[[Image:Pelerun3.jpg|right|250px]]
The '''Pelé runaround move''' is a [[association football|football]] move designed to get around an opponent.&lt;ref name=roger&gt;Roger Kenneth Macdonald, Scientific Soccer of the Seventies, Pelham: 1971, pp. 8-47&lt;/ref&gt; The move requires split-second timing and speed in execution - letting a pass from a teammate approach but allowing it run past the opponent, then sprinting around the opposing player to continue the attack. It relies on speed for its execution in situations where there is little time or space. The "Pelé variant" was demonstrated by Brazilian [[Pelé]] during the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]] match against [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]].&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/29/sports/29iht-soccer.2.t_24.html "The Greatest? For Century, Pelé Eclipses Muhammad Ali"]. The New York Times. Retrieved 6 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In the second half, Brazilian centre-forward [[Tostão]] played a through pass to Pelé as a counter-attack started. Sprinting up the middle, Pelé was immediately confronted with the Uruguayan goalkeeper [[Ladislao Mazurkiewicz]] who came off his line quickly. Pelé got there first and fooled Mazurkiewicz by not touching the ball, causing it to roll to the goalkeeper's left, while Pelé went to the goalkeepers right.&lt;ref name="skysports"/&gt; Circling the goalkeeper to collect, Pelé shot while turning towards the goal, but he turned in excess as he shot, and the ball drifted just wide of the far post.&lt;ref name="skysports"&gt;[http://www.skysports.com/football/world-cup-2010/story/0,27032,17286_5688110,00.html "Mexico 1970: Brazilians show all how beautiful game should be played"]. Sky Sports. Retrieved 5 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pelé's move is a variant of the "selling the dummy" [[Dummy (football)|feint]] - letting the ball go ''around'' a defender then also circling the opponent, rather than following the straight path of a pass or loose ball, and can be useful in tight situations. It is discussed in such books as Scientific Soccer of the Seventies by soccer historian Kenneth MacDonald, who also discusses Pelé's contribution in Brazil's 1970 World Cup victory in detail.&lt;ref name=roger/&gt; This "runaround" move is mentioned in official FIFA World Cup Technical Reports as ''"audaciously executed, and called for immense skill, timing, judgment and speed."''&lt;ref&gt;World Championship - Jules Rimet Cup 1970 Final Competition.  FÉDÉRATION INTERNATIONALE DE FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION, FIFA Technical Study Group, London: (FIFA) 1970), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Blomqvist shuffle==

Swedish player [[Jesper Blomqvist]] managed to perform a variant of the Pele runaround move with more success, adding a fake, that resulted in a goal when his [[IFK Göteborg]] played [[Helsingborgs IF]] in the [[Allsvenskan]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;As seen on Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXJhyqEinXY)&lt;/ref&gt; Blomqvist relied more on deception than Pelé. Whereas the Brazilian had to move with utmost speed to avoid Mazurkiewicz, Blomqvist had more time and used a deceptive shuffling of the feet. Receiving an excellent through pass, the Swede confused the approaching keeper - letting the ball run - and ''faking left'', while sprinting right, around his opponent. He collected the ball on the other side and finished with an easy goal. As demonstrated by both Blomqvist and Pelé, the runaround move can thus work in "emergency" situations where speed and split-second timing is all, or where there is more time and space to fake out an opponent. In both scenarios, it can lead to spectacular results.

The '''Petach Tikva Pioneers''' ({{lang-he|'''פתח תקווה פיונירס'''}}) was an [[Israel]]i [[baseball]] team from [[Petah Tikva]] in the [[Israel Baseball League]].

They finished the inaugural 2007 regular season in last place (9-32; .220), and lost to the [[Modi'in Miracle]] in the quarterfinals of the 2007 championship.

==History==
[[Image:Petach Tikva Pioneers shirt logo.jpg|thumb|left]]
The name for the Pioneers was chosen in recognition that [[Petah Tikva]] was founded in 1878 by religious pioneers from [[Jerusalem]], who were led by [[Yehoshua Stampfer]], Yoel Moshe Salomon, Zerach Brant, and David Gutmann, as well as [[Lithuania]]n Rabbi [[Aryeh Leib Frumkin]].

The first player selected by the Pioneers in the inaugural draft was [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] outfielder Reynaldo Cruz,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.israelbaseballleague.com/news/pressreleases/index.html?article_id=24 |title=First Player Draft in IBL History Yields Bumper Crop |accessdate=2007-04-29 |publisher=IsraelBaseballLeague.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; who later suffered a [[concussion]] and did not play for the rest of the season.

[[Ken Holtzman]] managed the Pioneers in the 2007 inaugural season of the Israel Baseball League, up until the last week of the season.  Holtzman in his major league career was the only pitcher since the 1880s to throw 2 no-hitters for the Cubs, and his 174 career victories are the most in the major leagues by a [[Jewish]] pitcher.  He also held the record for most pitching appearances by a Jewish pitcher until 1998.

[[Private (rank)|Soldadu]] '''Muhammad Razimie bin Ramlli''' (born 6 August 1990) is a [[Brunei]]an international [[football]]er who plays for [[MS ABDB]] and the [[Brunei national football team]] as a [[Striker (association football)|striker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bt.com.bn/sports-national/2016/04/24/ms-abdb-clinch-6-1-win-continue-domination|title=MS ABDB clinch 6-1 win, continue domination|publisher=The Brunei Times|date=24 April 2016|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506055649/http://www.bt.com.bn/sports-national/2016/04/24/ms-abdb-clinch-6-1-win-continue-domination|archivedate=6 May 2016|accessdate=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==

Razimie is a soldier with the [[Royal Brunei Armed Forces]] who began playing with its [[MS ABDB|sports council's]] football department in 2015, scoring 12 goals in his debut season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bt.com.bn/sports-national/2015/07/06/ms-abdb-coach-confident-winning-dst-super-league|title=MS ABDB coach confident of winning DST Super League|publisher=The Brunei Times|date=31 May 2014|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711103755/http://www.bt.com.bn/sports-national/2015/07/06/ms-abdb-coach-confident-winning-dst-super-league|archivedate=11 July 2015|accessdate=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won the [[Brunei Super League]] twice in a row and also the 2015 [[Brunei FA Cup]].

On 29 September 2017, Razimie scored a hat-trick in the 4-1 win over title contenders [[Kota Ranger FC]], who were unbeaten before the match took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=MS ABDB SNAP KOTA RANGER’S UNBEATEN RUN|url=https://www.brusports.com/2017/09/30/ms-abdb-snap-kota-rangers-unbeaten-run/|date=30 September 2017|publisher=BruSports News|accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
After another solid season in [[2016 Brunei Super League|2016]], Razimie was selected for the [[Brunei national football team|Brunei national team]] in October for the [[2016 AFF Suzuki Cup qualification]] matches and the [[2016 AFC Solidarity Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brunei to ‘treat each match like final’|url=http://borneobulletin.com.bn/brunei-treat-match-like-final/|date=1 November 2016|publisher=Borneo Bulletin|accessdate=18 November 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161105004003/http://borneobulletin.com.bn/brunei-treat-match-like-final/|archivedate=5 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He, along with [[Baharin Hamidon]], was a surprise addition to the squad that usually relies heavily on [[Brunei DPMM FC]] and [[Tabuan Muda]] players. He made his debut on 21 October against [[Laos national football team|Laos]] and scored the final goal of the game in a 4-3 defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Laos 4-3 Brunei: Laos finish in second place|url=http://www.affsuzukicup.com/news/laos-4-3-brunei-laos-finish-in-second-place|date=21 October 2016|publisher=Asean Football Federation|accessdate=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made one further appearance at the Solidarity Cup held two weeks later in [[Malaysia]].

In April 2018, he was selected as an overage player for the [[Brunei national under-21 football team|Brunei under-21 team]] competing for the [[2018 Hassanal Bolkiah Trophy]] held in his home country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hassanalbolkiahtrophy.gov.bn/team/brunei-darussalam/|title=BRU - 2018 Hassanal Bolkiah Trophy|publisher=Information Department, Prime Minister's Office of Brunei|date=|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He came on in the second half of the opening game which ended 0-1 against [[Timor-Leste national under-21 football team|Timor-Leste]]. Later that year, he appeared for the full national team as a second-half substitute in a 1-0 win against [[Timor-Leste national football team|Timor-Leste]] at the [[Hassanal Bolkiah National Stadium]] on 8 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tirto.id/piala-aff-2018-singkirkan-brunei-timor-leste-masuk-grup-indonesia-cXPT|title=Piala AFF 2018: Singkirkan Brunei, Timor Leste Masuk Grup Indonesia|publisher=tirto.id|date=8 September 2018|accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Rugby union]] in [[Laos]]''' is a minor but growing sport.

==Governing body==
The governing body is the Lao Rugby Federation, which was founded in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irb.com/unions/union=11000114/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928052844/http://www.irb.com/unions/union%3D11000114/index.html |archivedate=28 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.laorugby.com/Lao_Rugby_Federation/Home.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Rugby was originally introduced when Laos was part of [[French Indochina]], but this was mainly by French expatriates. After independence there was a long hiatus, as financial and political forces, from famine to the [[Vietnam War]] meant it was impossible for the game to be played.

The Indochinese Cup was established in 1999, as a four sided tourname between Vietnamese teams from [[Saïgon]] and [[Hanoi]], [[Vientiane]] ([[Laos]]) and [[Phnom Penh]] in Cambodia.&lt;ref name=CFRhist&gt;http://www.cambodiarugby.org/content.php?secid=10&amp;catid=16&amp;id=12 Cambodian Federation of Rugby, history, accessed 28 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Laos takes part in the South East Asia region of the [[Asian Five Nations]]

'''Sociology of sport''', alternately referred to as '''sports sociology''', is a sub-discipline of [[sociology]] which focuses on [[sport]]s as social phenomena. It is an area of study concerned with various socio-cultural structures, patterns, and [[organization]]s or groups involved with sport.

There are many perspectives through which [[sport]] can be viewed. Therefore, very often some binary divisions are stressed, such as: professional vs. amateur, mass vs. top-level, active vs. passive/spectator, men vs. women, sports vs. play (as an antithesis to organized and [[Institutionalisation|institutionalized]] activity). Following [[feminist]] or other reflexive and tradition-breaking [[paradigms]] sports are sometimes studied as contested activities, i.e. as activities in the centre of various people/groups interests (connection of [[sports]] and [[gender]], [[mass media]], or state-politics).

In most premodern societies, the gender role for females and males in sports was reinforced at a young age. The sociology that formed surrounding sports enforced the idea that sports were too masculine for women and are encouraged to play noncompetitive games while men were able to compete.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, David C, and William N. Thompson. “Sociology of sports.” Encyclopædia Britannica, Encyclopædia Britannica, inc., 10 Mar. 2017, www.britannica.com/topic/sports/Sociology-of-sports.&lt;/ref&gt; The impact of sports and games was to prepare young children for adulthood. The separation between the roles of men and women in a society of sports is expressed through media and gender identity. On media, the sports viewership varies by gender. Men's sports are more prominent in the media versus women's sports and the sports broadcast vary. On NCAA news, the text and text space greater than 2:1 coverage of men’s sports over women’s, the pictures are around 2:1 male athletes over female athletes.&lt;ref&gt;Shifflett, Bethany, and Rhonda Revelle. “Gender Equity In Sports Media Coverage: A Review Of The Ncaa News.” Journal of Sport and Social Issues, vol. 18, no. 2, 1994, pp. 144–150., doi:10.1177/019372394018002004.&lt;/ref&gt; For males the sports typically include football, hockey, baseball, soccer, basketball, pro wrestling and boxing,&lt;ref&gt;Messner, Michael A., et al. “The Televised Sports Manhood Formula.” Journal of Sport and Social Issues, vol. 24, no. 4, 2000, pp. 380–394., doi:10.1177/0193723500244006.&lt;/ref&gt; while women's sports covers figure skating, gymnastics, skiing, and diving.&lt;ref&gt;Sargent, Stephanie L, et al. “The Gender Gap in the enjoyment of televised sports.” Sage Journals, Feb. 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a contrast in the sports for each gender: the men's sports include confrontative, combative coordination and the women's sports are less aggressive and more individual and stylish. Participation in “masculine” sports creates gender identity conflict for females, likewise participation in “feminine” sports creates gender identity conflict for males.

The emergence of the sociology of sport (though not the name itself) dates from the end of the 19th century, when first [[social psychology|social psychological]] experiments dealing with group effects of competition and pace-making took place. Besides [[cultural anthropology]] and its interest in games in the human culture, one of the first efforts to think about sports in a more general way was [[Johan Huizinga]]'s ''Homo Ludens'' or [[Thorstein Veblen]]'s ''Theory of the Leisure Class''.&lt;ref&gt;Lueschen, G. 1980. Sociology of Sport: Development, Present State, and Prospects. ''Annual Review of Sociology'', 6: 315 — 347.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, sports sociology gained significant attention as an organized, legitimate field of study.  The North American Society for the Sociology of Sport was formed in 1978 with the objective of studying the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nasss.org/about/about-nasss/| title=About NASSS| publisher=North American Society for the Sociology of Sport| accessdate=February 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its research outlet, the ''Sociology of Sport Journal'', was formed in 1984.

Today, most sports sociologists identify with at least one of four essential theories that define the relationship between sports and society, namely [[structural functionalism]], [[Conflict theories|conflict theory]], [[critical theory]], and [[symbolic interactionism]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2674">The '''Soviet School of Chess''' was asserted to be a national style of play by Soviet chess players and journalists.  Although chess had been a game of the bourgeois and upper classes before the revolution, its popularity among Bolshevik leaders, including [[Lenin]], contributed to its being supported by state leaders in the [[USSR]] as a national pastime. References to a Soviet School of Chess only occurred after [[World War II]], when a generation of Soviet chess players, led by soon-to-be world champion [[Mikhail Botvinnik]], began a string of victories over international competitors that surprised the world.

Generally speaking, chess experts in the USSR described the Soviet School of Chess as a fast-paced, daring style of play best exemplified by the young generation of postwar players like [[David Bronstein]].  Not all Soviet players used this playing style, though.  The most notable exception was Botvinnik, whom [[grandmaster (chess)|grandmaster]] [[Mark Taimanov]] compared to the methodical [[Wilhelm Steinitz]].  The main contribution of the Soviet School of Chess was not the style of players but their emphasis on rigorous training and study of the game, i.e. considering chess a sport rather than an art or science.

'''Stade Henri-Jooris''' was a sports [[stadium]] in [[Lille]], [[France]]. The stadium, used mostly for [[football (soccer)|football]] matches was able to hold 15,000 people and was home stadium of [[Olympique Lillois]] and [[Lille OSC]].

Originally it was known as ''Stade de l'avenue de Dunkerque''; from 1907 to 1943, the stadium's name was the ''Stade Victor Boucquey''. That year it was renamed after the former president of Olympique Lillois Henri-Jooris (who died four years before).

During the [[1938 World Cup]], it hosted one game.

Morrison claimed that the original idea for a flying disc toy came to him in 1937, while throwing a popcorn can lid with his girlfriend, Lu, whom he later married. The popcorn can lid soon dented which led to the discovery that cake pans flew better and were more common. Morrison and Lu developed a little business selling "Flyin' Cake Pans" on the beaches of [[Santa Monica, California]]. 

During [[World War II]] he learned something of aerodynamics flying his [[P-47 Thunderbolt]] in Italy. He was shot down and was a [[prisoner of war]] for 48 days. 

In 1946, he sketched out a design (called the Whirlo-Way) for the world's first flying disc. In 1948 an investor, Warren Franscioni, paid for molding the design in plastic.  They named it the Flyin-Saucer. After disappointing sales, Fred &amp; Warren parted ways in early 1950. In 1954, Fred bought more of the Saucers from the original molders to sell at local fairs, but soon found he could produce his own disc more cheaply. In 1955, he and Lu designed the Pluto Platter, the archetype of all modern flying discs. On January 23, 1957, they sold the rights for the Pluto Platter to the [[Wham-O]] toy company. Initially Wham-O continued to market the toy solely as the "Pluto Platter", but by June 1957 they also began using the name ''Frisbee'' after learning that college students in the Northeast were calling the Pluto Platter by that name. Morrison also invented several other products for Wham-O, but none were as successful as the Pluto Platter.

Morrison and his wife, Lu Nay Morrison had three children. Lu died in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/technology-obituaries/7223147/Fred-Morrison.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Fred Morrison | date=2010-02-12 | accessdate=2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a [[disc golf]] course in [[Holladay, Utah]] named in his honor.

Morrison died in his home at the age of 90 on February 9, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/US/02/12/frisbee.morrison.obit/index.html?hpt=T2 | work=CNN | title=Frisbee inventor dies at 90 – CNN.com | accessdate=2010-05-27 | date=2010-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
