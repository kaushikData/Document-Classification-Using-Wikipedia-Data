The '''2011 Nairobi pipeline fire''' was caused by an [[explosion]] secondary to a [[oil spill|fuel spill]] in the [[Kenya]]n capital [[Nairobi]] on 12 September 2011.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/13/world/africa/13kenya.html | author=Jeffrey Gettleman |title=Scores Dead in Kenyan Pipeline Fire |newspaper=The New York Times | date=12 September 2011 |accessdate=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 100 people were killed in the fire and at least 116 others were hospitalized with varying degrees of [[burn]]s.&lt;ref name=hospital/&gt; The incident was not the first such [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]] accident in Kenya,&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; with the [[Molo fire]] of 2009 resulting in at least 133 fatalities and hundreds more injured.

==Causes==
A fuel tank, located in the industrial Lunga Lunga area of Nairobi and part of a pipeline system operated by the state owned [[Kenya Pipeline Company]] (KPC), had sprung a leak.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14879401 | work=BBC News | title=Kenya fire: Nairobi pipeline blaze 'kills 100' | date=12 September 2011 | accessdate=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; People in the adjacent densely populated [[shanty town]] of Sinai had started to collect leaking fuel when at about 10 a.m. a massive explosion occurred at the scene. Fire spread to the Sinai area.

The cause of the explosion has not yet been determined but some reports indicate that the fire might have started from a discarded cigarette&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Another disaster waiting to happen in Kenya|url=http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/InsidePage.php?id=2000042798&amp;cid=4 |date= 14 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=denyblame/&gt; or when the wind changed, bringing embers from nearby garbage fires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Scores killed as slum pipeline bursts again |url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/scores-killed-as-slum-pipeline-bursts-again-20110913-1k7to.html |date=14 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy Minister [[Kiraitu Murungi]] is reported as saying that the disaster began when a pipeline valve failed under pressure allowing the oil to leak into the sewer.&lt;ref name=blame/&gt; [[Selest Kilinda]], the managing director of KPC, is reported to have said the spill occurred from two pipelines, and that engineers had already depressurised the Sinai pipeline but not in time to prevent fuel leaking into the sewer.&lt;ref name=blame/&gt;

==Casualties==
Early police estimates have the number of fatalities to be above one hundred;&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; in addition, at least 116 other people were hospitalized with burn injuries.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; The exact death toll remains uncertain due to some bodies being badly charred or lost in the murky waters of a nearby river.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=120 burned to death in Kenya pipeline fire|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/kenya/8758340/120-burned-to-death-in-Kenya-pipeline-fire.html|date=12 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Kenya's [[Red Cross]] Disaster Risk Reduction Officer said that the Red Cross would counsel the victims and also would attempt to reconcile the casualty figures with those reported missing. He also reported that most bodies taken to the mortuary were burnt beyond recognition and would require [[DNA]] tests to confirm their identities.&lt;ref name=Moon/&gt;
In November 2011, The Kenya Pipeline Company funded the delivery to the Ministry of Public Health and Sanitation a computer and software system to facilitate forensic DNA identification of victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=M-FISys software, used for 9/11, to identify victims of Sinai fire|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201111220161.html|date=21 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=KPC Donates DNA Testing Software to Government's Chemist|url=http://www.genecodesforensics.com/news/KPC%20Acquires%20M-FISys%20and%20Donates%20to%20Kenyan%20Ministry%20of%20Public%20Health.pdf|date=20 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
The system, called M-FISys (pronounced like "emphasis," an acronym for the Mass-Fatality Identification System), was developed to identify victims of the [[World Trade Center Disaster]] of [[September 11, 2001]].

&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Development Under Extreme Conditions (Proceedings of Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing, 2003)|url=http://www.genecodesforensics.com/news/CashHoyleSutton.pdf|date=January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

City hospitals were hard pressed by the surge of the need for care provisions, food and a strained medicare staff complement.&lt;ref name=hospital&gt;{{Cite news|title=116 pipeline fire survivors in hospital|url=http://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/2011/09/12/116-pipeline-fire-survivors-in-hospital/ |date=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=report&gt;{{Cite news|title=Report warns hospitals not equipped for fire disasters |url=http://www.nation.co.ke/News/Report+warns+hospitals+not+equipped+for+fire+disasters+/-/1056/1235938/-/et2xk9z/-/ |date =13 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Kenyatta National Hospital]] has only 22 burn unit beds&lt;ref name=report/&gt; and considers any more than 60 casualties as a 'disaster', requiring them to put disaster plans into action. At least 112 people&lt;ref name=hospital/&gt; were admitted with burns, many critical or severe. The long-term treatment required for burns patients means that extra tents have been erected for blood donations.
The nearer Mater Hospital admitted three casualties with less than 30% burns into the normal ward and one other casualty with 80–90% burns into the intensive care unit.&lt;ref name=hospital/&gt;

==Responsibility==
Neither the managing director of the KPC, which operates the pipeline, nor the energy minister Kiraitu Murungi have given any indication of accepting responsibility.&lt;ref name=denyblame&gt;{{cite news|title=Nairobi slum fire: Kenya officials deny blame| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14904634|date=13 September 2011 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kiraitu Murungi initially said that the KPC would compensate the victims, but later the KPC stated it would not do so as it was "not responsible".&lt;ref name=NEMA/&gt;

In 2008 the KPC had issued an eviction order to nearby residents, but they refused to leave.&lt;ref name="Mary Kimonye"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kimonye|first=Mary|title=Why slum disaster was avoidable|url=http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/Opinion+++Analysis/Why+slum+disaster+was+avoidable/-/539548/1236376/-/8ctqw5/-/index.html|accessdate=15 September 2011|newspaper=Business Daily|date=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to protests by students, an inter-ministerial committee was tasked with gathering names to arrange relocation when funds became available.&lt;ref name="Daily Nation 2009"&gt;{{cite news|title=The fire next time: Slum courts doom|url=http://www.nation.co.ke/News/-/1056/523822/-/u1ulyg/-/index.html|accessdate=15 September 2011|newspaper=Daily Nation|date=2 February 2009|author=Jami Makan|author2=John Ngirachu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  KPC sent representatives to inform the residents of the danger and to make sure holes were not dug.&lt;ref name="Daily Nation 2009"/&gt;

==Political impact==
[[Prime Minister of Kenya|Prime minister]] [[Raila Odinga]] and [[Vice-President of Kenya|vice-president]] [[Kalonzo Musyoka]] have visited the scene and various hospitals to console injured victims and to condole bereaved families. [[List of heads of state of Kenya|President]] [[Mwai Kibaki]] visited the main [[Kenyatta National Hospital]] to empathize with the injured.&lt;ref name=hospital/&gt;
The [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|secretary-general of the United Nations]], [[Ban Ki Moon]], expressed sorrow and sympathy for the victims, wishing a full and speedy recovery to the survivors,&lt;ref name=Moon/&gt; while the [[United States Ambassador to Kenya|United States ambassador to Kenya]], [[Scott Gration]], lauded the rescue workers and the personal heroism of the locals.&lt;ref name=Moon&gt;{{Cite news|title=UN chief expresses sadness over Kenya's tragedy|url=http://www.arabstoday.net/en/un-chief-expresses-sadness-over-kenyas-tragedy.html|date=13 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Amnesty International]]-Kenya said that the failure to relocate people puts the majority of the blame on government officials.&lt;ref name=blame/&gt;

==Enforcement after the event==
The [[National Environment Management Authority of Kenya|National Environment Management Authority]] (NEMA) said it will act against the KPC for failing to enforce EMCA 1999—and suggests that if the required spill containment measures were in place at the facility the oil would not have run off into the drains.&lt;ref name=NEMA/&gt; NEMA dismissed KPC claims that they had acted sufficiently, saying they had not received the Environmental audit that is obligatory under the 2003 Environmental Impact Assessment and Environmental Audit Regulations.&lt;ref name=NEMA&gt;{{Cite news|title=Sinai: NEMA puts Pipeline on the spot |url=http://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/2011/09/15/sinai-nema-puts-pipeline-on-the-spot/ |date= 15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The slum has been in that place for approximately 20 years despite the requirement for KPC to keep those areas clear of settlement.&lt;ref name=NEMA/&gt;
NEMA said it would also require KPC to deal with the pollution in the environment, particularly regarding the flora and fauna&lt;ref name=NEMA/&gt; along the [[Nairobi River|Ngong River]] into which the storm drain flows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=100 killed in Nairobi fuel fire |url=http://www.freedominspeech.org/component/content/article/318-100-killed-in-nairobi-fuel-fire.html |date=13 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Warnings before the event==
In 2009 journalist John Ngirachu wrote&lt;ref name=blame&gt;{{Cite news|title=Blame-Game Follows Nairobi Pipeline Blast |url=http://www.voanews.com/english/news/africa/Blame-Game-Follows-Nairobi-Pipeline-Blast-129753688.html |date=13 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the local newspaper ''[[Daily Nation]]'' and reported that the slums in Sinai being located so near to the pipeline were a disaster waiting to happen.&lt;ref name=allafrica/&gt; The permanent secretary to the Ministry of Energy, Patrick Nyoike,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Office of public communications:Partick Nyoike |url=http://www.communication.go.ke/ministry.asp?personid=77 |accessdate=16 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100921165128/http://communication.go.ke/ministry.asp?personid=77 |archivedate=21 September 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; had asked the KPC to refurbish the pipelines but it was reported that the Ministry of Finance declined.&lt;ref name=allafrica&gt;{{Cite news|title=What Government and KPC Should Do to Avert Future Tragedies in the Wake of Mukuru-Sinai Slum Disaster|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201109160143.html |date=16 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Association des pays non producteurs de pétrole.svg|thumb|Member states]]
The '''APNPP''', an acronym of "l’association des pays non producteurs de pétrole"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanfinna.com/ARCHIVES/Archives375/questionsorales.htm this site]&lt;/ref&gt; (in English: the '''"Pan-African Non-Petroleum Producers Association"'''), is an association of 15 African nations that signed a treaty in July, 2006.

Their stated aim is to work together to promote biofuel production and reduce the effects of high oil prices.

The APNPP, which was first proposed by [[Abdoulaye Wade]], is being led by the Ministry of Energy and Mines of Senegal. At the moment, the acting head is Mr [[Madické Niang]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seneweb.com/news/engine/print_article.php?artid=4233 Ministry of Energy and Mines leading the organisation of the APNPP]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gouv.sn/ministeres/mmindustrie/contacts.cfm Madické Niang as head of Ministry of Mines] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080310011107/http://www.gouv.sn/ministeres/mmindustrie/contacts.cfm |date=March 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aluminum powder''' is powdered [[aluminum]]. This was originally produced by mechanical means using a [[stamp mill]] to create flakes. Subsequently, a process of spraying molten aluminum to create a powder of droplets was developed by [[E. J. Hall]] in the 1920s. The resulting powder might then be processed further in a [[ball mill]] to flatten it into flakes for use as a coating or pigment. Aluminum powder is non-toxic and is not harmful unless injected directly in a major blood vessel such as the [[Aorta|aorta]]{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}. Aluminum powder, if breathed in, is not particularly harmful and will only cause minor irritation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lskj5k3PSIcC&amp;pg=PA275 |chapter=Powder Metallurgy Processing |page=275 |title=Aluminum and Aluminum Alloys |author=Joseph R.

[[Image:Avebury Avenue.jpg|thumb|[[Avebury]] Avenue.]]

British [[Archaeologist]]s refine the general archaeological use of '''avenue''' to denote a long, parallel-sided strip of land, measuring up to about 30m in width, open at either end and with edges marked by stone or timber alignments and/or a low earth bank and ditch. The term is used for such features all over the [[British Isles]] but they are concentrated in the centre and south of [[England]].

Most are either short and straight (Type I, less than 800m long), or long and curving (Type II, up to 2.5&amp;nbsp;km). It has been noted that they often link [[stone circle]]s with rivers. They are a common element to [[Bronze Age]] [[ritual landscape]]s.

Avenues are identified through their earthworks or using [[aerial archaeology]] as their parallel side features can be seen stretching over some distance. In most examples, it is the association of the avenue with other contemporary monuments that provides diagnosis. Avenues differ from [[cursus]] monuments, in that the latter also have earthworks at their terminal ends and have no upright stone or timber alignments.

Avenues are thought to have been ceremonial or processional paths and to be of early Bronze Age date. They seem to have been used to indicate the intended route of approach to a particular monument.

Examples include the [[Stonehenge Avenue]], the [[Beckhampton Avenue]] at [[Avebury]], [[West Kennet Avenue]] and that at [[Thornborough Henges|Thornborough]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2143">The '''Bheema lift irrigation project''' or '''Rajiv Bheema Project''' is a lift [[irrigation]] canal project located in [[Mahbubnagar district]] in [[Telangana]], [[India]]. Water is lifted at Panchdev Pahad from the back waters of [[Jurala Project|Jurala Dam]]. Under the same project, another lift canal originates separately from the Ramanpahad balancing reservoir ( {{Coord|16|22|04|N|77|52|20|E|type:landmark_region:IN-AP}} ) under Jurala left bank to irrigate the uplands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2004/06/14/stories/2004061409520300.htm |title=Andhra Pradesh News : Work on Bheema project to begin in a year, says MP |publisher=The Hindu |date=2004-06-14 |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Project==
The Bheema Lift irrigation project would irrigate over {{convert|203000|acre|km2}}, would benefit 180 villages that fall in Makthal, Atmakur, Wanaparthy, and Kollapur [[Taluk]]s of Mahabubnagar District utilising 20 [[Tmcft|TMC]] ({{convert|20|e9cuft|m3}})
of water.

===Details of Proposals===
            
The lifts are proposed at two points.
 
'''Lift I''' is from the Krishna river from the point near Panchadevpad (V) in Atmakur taluk to irrigate an extent of {{convert|111,000| acre| ha}}.   
 
'''Lift II''' is from existing Ookachettivagu Project pondage near Ramanpad (V) in Wanaparthy [[Taluk]] to irrigate an extent of {{convert|92,000| acre| ha}}.

Benefitted [[Mandal]]s:-  The Mandals that would be benefited under the project are Magnur, Makthal, Narva, Atmakur, Chinnachintakunta, Wanaparthy, Peddamandadi, Pebbair, Pangal, Veepanagandla, Kollapur, Kothakota and Devarakadra of Mahabubnagar district.

'''Breathing''' (or '''respiration''', or '''ventilation''')  is the process of moving air into and out of the [[lung]]s to facilitate [[gas exchange]] with the [[Milieu intérieur|internal environment]], mostly by bringing in [[oxygen]] and flushing out [[carbon dioxide]].

All aerobic creatures need oxygen for [[cellular respiration]], which uses the oxygen to break down foods for energy and produces carbon dioxide as a waste product. Breathing, or "external respiration", brings air into the lungs where gas exchange takes place in the [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]] through [[diffusion]]. The body's [[circulatory system]] transports these gases to and from the cells, where "cellular respiration" takes place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hall|first1=John|title=Guyton and Hall textbook of medical physiology|date=2011|publisher=Saunders/Elsevier|location=Philadelphia, Pa.|isbn=978-1-4160-4574-8|page=5|edition=12th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pocock2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pocock|first1=Gillian|last2=Richards|first2=Christopher D.|title=Human physiology : the basis of medicine|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-856878-0|page=311|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The breathing of all [[vertebrate]]s with lungs consists of repetitive cycles of [[inhalation]] and [[exhalation]] through a  highly branched system of tubes or [[Respiratory tract|airways]] which lead from the nose to the alveoli.&lt;ref name="Pocock"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pocock|first1=Gillian|last2=Richards|first2=Christopher D.|title=Human physiology : the basis of medicine|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-856878-0|page=320|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of respiratory cycles per minute is the breathing or [[respiratory rate]], and is one of the four primary [[vital signs]] of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vital Signs 101|url=http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/healthlibrary/conditions/cardiovascular_diseases/vital_signs_body_temperature_pulse_rate_respiration_rate_blood_pressure_85,P00866/|website=www.hopkinsmedicine.org|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under normal conditions the breathing depth and rate is automatically, and unconsciously, controlled by several [[Homeostasis|homeostatic mechanisms]] which keep the [[partial pressure]]s of [[carbon dioxide]] and [[oxygen]] in the arterial blood constant. Keeping the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the arterial blood unchanged under a wide variety of physiological circumstances, contributes significantly to [[Acid-base homeostasis|tight control of the pH]] of the [[extracellular fluids]] (ECF).  Over-breathing ([[hyperventilation]]) and under-breathing ([[hypoventilation]]), which decrease and increase the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide respectively, cause a rise in the pH of ECF in the first case, and a lowering of the pH in the second. Both cause distressing symptoms.

Breathing has other important functions. It provides a mechanism for [[speech]], [[laughter]] and similar expressions of the emotions. It is also used for [[reflex]]es such as [[yawning]], [[cough reflex|coughing]] and [[sneezing]]. Animals that cannot [[Thermoregulation|thermoregulate]] by [[perspiration]], because they lack sufficient [[sweat gland]]s, may lose heat by evaporation through panting.

| image2 = Forceful breathing.jpg
| caption2 = The muscles of forceful breathing (inhalation and exhalation). The color code is the same as on the left. In addition to a more forceful and extensive contraction of the diaphragm, the intercostal muscles are aided by the accessory muscles of inhalation to exaggerate the movement of the ribs upwards, causing a greater expansion of the rib cage. During exhalation, apart from the relaxation of the muscles of inhalation, the abdominal muscles actively contract to pull the lower edges of the rib cage downwards decreasing the volume of the rib cage, while at the same time pushing the diaphragm upwards deep into the thorax.

| image1 = Quiet breathing.jpg
| caption1 = The muscles of breathing at rest: inhalation on the left, exhalation on the right. Contracting muscles are shown in red; relaxed muscles in blue. Contraction of the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] generally contributes the most to the expansion of the chest cavity (light blue). However, at the same time, the intercostal muscles pull the ribs upwards (their effect is indicated by arrows) also causing the [[rib cage]] to expand during inhalation (see diagram on other side of the page). The relaxation of all these muscles during exhalation cause the rib cage and abdomen (light green) to elastically return to their resting positions.  Compare these diagrams with the MRI video at the top of the page.
}}

The lungs are not capable of inflating themselves, and will expand only when there is an increase in the volume of the thoracic cavity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pocock|first1=Gillian|last2=Richards|first2=Christopher D.|title=Human physiology : the basis of medicine|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-856878-0|page=316|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Levitzky2013_1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Levitzky|first1=Michael G.|title=Pulmonary physiology|date=2013|publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-179313-1|page=Chapter 1. Function and Structure of the Respiratory System|edition=Eighth}}&lt;/ref&gt; In humans, as in the other [[mammals]], this is achieved primarily through the contraction of the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]], but also by the contraction of the [[intercostal muscles]] which pull the [[Rib cage#Function|rib cage]] upwards and outwards as shown in the diagrams on the left.&lt;ref name=tortora1&gt;{{cite book |last1= Tortora |first1= Gerard J. |last2=Anagnostakos|first2=Nicholas P.| title=Principles of anatomy and physiology |pages=556–582|edition= Fifth |location= New York |publisher= Harper &amp; Row, Publishers|publication-date= 1987 |isbn= 0-06-350729-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During forceful inhalation (Figure on the right) the [[accessory muscles of breathing|accessory muscles of inhalation]], which connect the ribs and [[sternum]] to the [[cervical vertebrae]] and base of the skull, in many cases through an intermediary attachment to the [[clavicles]], exaggerate the [[Pump handle movement|pump handle]] and [[bucket handle movement]]s (see illustrations on the left), bringing about a greater change in the volume of the chest cavity.&lt;ref name=tortora1 /&gt; During exhalation (breathing out), at rest, all the muscles of inhalation relax, returning the chest and abdomen to a position called the “resting position”, which is determined by their anatomical elasticity.&lt;ref name=tortora1 /&gt; At this point the lungs contain the [[functional residual capacity]] of air, which, in the adult human, has a volume of about 2.5–3.0 liters.&lt;ref name=tortora1 /&gt;

During heavy breathing ([[hyperpnea]]) as, for instance, during exercise, exhalation is brought about by relaxation of all the muscles of inhalation, (in the same way as at rest), but, in addition, the abdominal muscles, instead of being passive, now contract strongly causing the rib cage to be pulled downwards (front and sides).&lt;ref name=tortora1 /&gt; This not only decreases the size of the rib cage, but also pushes the abdominal organs upwards against the diaphragm which consequently bulges deeply into the thorax. The end-exhalatory lung volume is now less air than the resting "functional residual capacity".&lt;ref name=tortora1 /&gt; However, in a normal mammal, the lungs cannot be emptied completely. In an adult human there is always still at least one liter of residual air left in the lungs after maximum exhalation.&lt;ref name=tortora1 /&gt;

[[Diaphragmatic breathing]] causes the abdomen to rhythmically bulge out and fall back. It is, therefore, often referred to as "abdominal breathing". These terms are often used interchangeably because they describe the same action.

When the accessory muscles of inhalation are activated, especially during [[labored breathing]], the clavicles are pulled upwards, as explained above. This external manifestation of the use of the accessory muscles of inhalation is sometimes referred to as [[clavicular breathing]], seen especially during [[asthma]] attacks and in people with [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]].

==Passage of air==

===Upper airways===

[[File:Nose in cold weather.gif|thumb|200px|Inhaled air is warmed and moistened by the wet, warm nasal mucosa, which consequently cools and dries. When warm, wet air from the lungs is breathed out through the nose, the cold hygroscopic mucus in the cool and dry nose re-captures some of the warmth and moisture from that exhaled air. In very cold weather the re-captured water may cause a "dripping nose".]]
[[File:Bakó Árpád - Milagro (Santana Tribute) együttes, Miskolc, 2015.02.07 (8).JPG|thumb|200px|Following on from the above diagram, if the exhaled air is breathed out through the mouth on a cold and [[humid]] conditions, the [[water vapor]] will [[condense]] into a visible [[cloud]] or [[mist]].]]

Usually air is breathed in and out through the [[nose]]. The [[nasal cavity|nasal cavities]] (between the [[nostril]]s and the [[pharynx]]) are quite narrow, firstly by being divided in two by the [[nasal septum]], and secondly by [[Lateral (anatomy)|lateral]] walls that have several longitudinal folds, or shelves, called
[[nasal concha]]e,&lt;ref name=grays /&gt; thus exposing a large area of [[Mucous membrane of nose|nasal mucous membrane]] to the air as it is inhaled (and exhaled). This causes the inhaled air to take up moisture from the wet [[mucus]], and warmth from the underlying blood vessels, so that the air is very nearly saturated with [[water vapor]] and is at almost body temperature by the time it reaches the [[larynx]].&lt;ref name=tortora1 /&gt; Part of this moisture and heat is recaptured as the exhaled air moves out over the partially dried-out, cooled mucus in the nasal passages, during breathing out. The sticky mucus also traps much of the particulate matter that is breathed in, preventing it from reaching the lungs.&lt;ref name=tortora1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=grays&gt;{{cite book |last1=Williams |first1=Peter L |last2=Warwick |first2=Roger |last3=Dyson|first3=Mary |last4=Bannister |first4=Lawrence H. |title=Gray’s Anatomy| pages=1172–1173, 1278–1282 |location=Edinburgh|publisher=Churchill Livingstone | edition=Thirty-seventh |publication-date=1989|isbn= 0443 041776 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lower airways===
The anatomy of a typical mammalian respiratory system, below the structures normally listed among the "upper airways" (the nasal cavities, the pharynx, and larynx), is often described as a '''respiratory tree'''  or  '''tracheobronchial tree''' (figure on the left). Larger airways give rise to branches that are slightly narrower, but more numerous than the "trunk" airway that gives rise to the branches.  The human respiratory tree may consist of, on average, 23 such branchings into progressively smaller airways, while the respiratory tree of the [[mouse]] has up to 13 such branchings.  Proximal divisions (those closest to the top of the tree, such as the trachea and bronchi) function mainly to transmit air to the lower airways. Later divisions such as the respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts and alveoli are specialized for [[gas exchange]].&lt;ref name=tortora1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=gilroy&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gilroy|first1=Anne M.|last2=MacPherson|first2= Brian R.|last3= Ross|first3=Lawrence M.|title= Atlas of Anatomy|publisher=Thieme|location=Stuttgart|date=2008|pages=108–111|isbn=978-1-60406-062-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trachea and the first portions of the main bronchi are outside the lungs. The rest of the "tree" branches within the lungs, and ultimately extends to every part of the [[lung]]s.

The alveoli are the blind-ended terminals of the "tree", meaning that any air that enters them has to exit via the same route it used to enter the alveoli. A system such as this creates [[Dead space (physiology)|dead space]], a volume of air that fills the airways (the dead space) at the end of inhalation, and is breathed out, unchanged, during the next exhalation, never having reached the alveoli. Similarly, the dead space is filled with alveolar air at the end of exhalation, and is the first air to breathed back into the alveoli, before any fresh air reaches the alveoli during inhalation. The dead space volume of a typical adult human is about 150&amp;nbsp;ml.

==Gas exchange==
{{Main article|Gas exchange}}
The primary purpose of breathing is to bring atmospheric air (in small doses) into the alveoli where [[gas exchange]] with the gases in the blood takes place. The equilibration of the partial pressures of the gases in the alveolar blood and the alveolar air occurs by [[Diffusion#Diffusion vs. bulk flow|diffusion]]. At the end of each exhalation the adult human lungs still contain 2,500–3,000 mL of air, their [[functional residual capacity]] or FRC. With each breath (inhalation) only as little as about 350 mL of warm, moistened atmospheric is added, and well mixed, with the FRC. Consequently, the gas composition of the FRC changes very little during the breathing cycle. Since the pulmonary capillary blood equilibrates with this virtually unchanging mixture of air in the lungs (which has a substantially different composition from that of the ambient air), the partial pressures of the arterial blood gases also do not change with each breath. The tissues are therefore not exposed to swings in oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions in the blood during the breathing cycle, and the [[peripheral chemoreceptor|peripheral]] and [[central chemoreceptors]] do not need to "choose" the point in the breathing cycle at which the blood gases need to be measured, and responded to. Thus the homeostatic control of the breathing rate simply depends on the partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the arterial blood. This then also maintains  [[Acid–base homeostasis|the constancy of the pH]] of the blood.&lt;ref name=tortora1 /&gt;

==Control==

{{Main article|Control of ventilation}}
The rate and depth of breathing is automatically controlled by the [[respiratory center]]s that receive information from the [[peripheral chemoreceptors|peripheral]] and [[central chemoreceptors]]. These [[chemoreceptor]]s continuously monitor the partial pressures of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the arterial blood. The sensors are, firstly, the central chemoreceptors on the surface of the [[medulla oblongata]] of the [[brain stem]] which are particularly sensitive to [[pH]] as well as the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the blood and [[cerebrospinal fluid]].&lt;ref name=tortora1 /&gt; The second group of sensors measure the partial pressure of oxygen in the arterial blood. Together the latter  are known as the peripheral chemoreceptors which are situated in the [[Aortic body|aortic]] and [[carotid body|carotid bodies]].&lt;ref name=tortora1 /&gt; Information from all of these chemoreceptors is conveyed to the [[respiratory center]]s in the [[pons]] and [[medulla oblongata]], which responds to deviations in the partial pressures of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the arterial blood from normal by adjusting the rate and depth of breathing, in such a way as to restore partial pressure of carbon dioxide back to 5.3&amp;nbsp;kPa (40&amp;nbsp;mm&amp;nbsp;Hg), the pH to 7.4 and, to a lesser extent, the partial pressure of oxygen to 13&amp;nbsp;kPa (100&amp;nbsp;mm&amp;nbsp;Hg).&lt;ref name=tortora1 /&gt; For instance, [[Physical exercise|exercise]] increases the production of carbon dioxide by the active muscles. This carbon dioxide diffuses into the venous blood, and ultimately raises the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the arterial blood. This is immediately sensed by the carbon dioxide chemoreceptors on the brain stem. The respiratory centers respond to this information by causing the rate and depth of breathing to increase to such an extent that the  partial pressures of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the arterial blood return almost immediately to the same levels as at rest. The respiratory centers communicate with the muscles of breathing via motor nerves, of which the [[phrenic nerve]]s, which innervate the diaphragm, are probably the most important.&lt;ref name=tortora1 /&gt;

Automatic breathing can be overridden to a limited extent by simple choice, or to facilitate [[Human swimming|swimming]], [[speech]], [[singing]] or other [[vocal]] training. It is impossible to suppress the urge to breathe to the point of hypoxia but training can increase the ability to breath-hold; for example, in February 2016, a Spanish, professional [[Freediving|freediver]] broke the world record for holding the breath under water at just over 24 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/longest-time-breath-held-voluntarily-(male)|title=Longest time breath held voluntarily (male)|newspaper=Guinness World Records|access-date=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other automatic breathing control reflexes also exist. Submersion, particularly of the face, in cold water, triggers a response called the [[diving reflex]].&lt;ref name="pann"&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=3768097|year=2013|author1=Michael Panneton|first1=W|title=The Mammalian Diving Response: An Enigmatic Reflex to Preserve Life?|journal=Physiology|volume=28|issue=5|pages=284–297|doi=10.1152/physiol.00020.2013|pmid=23997188}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Physiology and Pathophysiology"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The physiology and pathophysiology of human breath-hold diving|url=http://jap.physiology.org/content/106/1/284 |journal=Journal of Applied Physiology|volume=106 |issue=1 |date=1 January 2009 |pages=284–292 |doi=10.1152/japplphysiol.90991.2008 |first1=Peter |last1=Lindholm |first2=Claes EG |last2=Lundgren |accessdate=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This firstly has the result of shutting down the airways against the influx of water. The [[metabolic rate]] slows right down. This is coupled with intense vasoconstriction of the arteries to the limbs and abdominal viscera. This reserves the oxygen that is in blood and lungs at the beginning of the dive almost exclusively for the heart and the brain.&lt;ref name="pann" /&gt; The diving reflex is an often-used response in animals that routinely need to dive, such as penguins, seals and whales.&lt;ref name=pmid15233163&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Thornton SJ, Hochachka PW |title=Oxygen and the diving seal |journal=Undersea Hyperb Med |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=81–95 |year=2004 |pmid=15233163 |doi= |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/6520 |accessdate=2008-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid2800051&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zapol WM, Hill RD, Qvist J, Falke K, Schneider RC, Liggins GC, Hochachka PW |title=Arterial gas tensions and hemoglobin concentrations of the freely diving Weddell seal |journal=Undersea Biomed Res |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=363–73 |date=September 1989 |pmid=2800051 |doi= |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/2531 |accessdate=2008-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also more effective in very young infants and children than in adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=21881008|year=2012|author1=Pedroso|first1=F.

==Composition==
{{Further|Atmospheric chemistry}}

Inhaled air is by volume 78.08% [[nitrogen]], 20.95% oxygen and small amounts include [[argon]], carbon dioxide, [[neon]], [[helium]], and [[hydrogen]].&lt;ref name="NASA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Earth Fact Sheet|url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/earthfact.html|website=nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gas exhaled is 4% to 5% by volume of carbon dioxide, about a 100 fold increase over the inhaled amount.  The volume of oxygen is reduced by a small amount, 4% to 5%, compared to the oxygen inhaled. The typical composition is:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Textbook of Biology |author1=P.S.Dhami |author2=G.Chopra |author3=H.N.

*5.0–6.3% water vapor

*1% argon and several [[Parts-per notation|parts per million]] (ppm) of [[hydrogen]] and [[carbon monoxide]], 1 ppm of [[ammonia]] and less than 1 ppm of [[acetone]], [[methanol]], [[ethanol]] and other [[volatile organic compounds]].

In addition to air, [[Underwater diving|underwater divers]] practicing [[technical diving]] may breathe oxygen-rich, oxygen-depleted or helium-rich [[breathing gas]] mixtures. Oxygen and [[analgesic]] gases are sometimes given to patients under medical care. The atmosphere in [[space suit]]s is pure oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Biology|publisher = NCERT|year = 2015|isbn = 81-7450-496-6|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is kept at around 20% of Earthbound atmospheric pressure to regulate the rate of inspiration.

==Effects of ambient air pressure==
===Breathing at altitude===
{{See also|Effects of high altitude on humans}}
[[File:Altitude and air pressure &amp; Everest.jpg|thumb|300 px|Fig. 4 Atmospheric pressure]]
[[Atmospheric pressure]] decreases with the height above sea level (altitude) and since the alveoli are open to the outside air through the open airways, the pressure in the lungs also decreases at the same rate with altitude. At altitude, a pressure differential is still required to drive air into and out of the lungs as it is at sea level. The mechanism for breathing at altitude is essentially identical to breathing at sea level but with the following differences:

The atmospheric pressure decreases exponentially with altitude, roughly halving with every {{convert|5500|m|ft}} rise in altitude.&lt;ref name=altitude&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.altitude.org/calculators/air_pressure.php|title=Online high altitude oxygen calculator|publisher=altitude.org|accessdate=15 August 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120729214053/http://www.altitude.org/calculators/air_pressure.php|archivedate=29 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The composition of atmospheric air is, however, almost constant below 80&amp;nbsp;km, as a result of the continuous mixing effect of the weather.&lt;ref name = tyson /&gt; The concentration of oxygen in the air (mmols O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per liter of air) therefore decreases at the same rate as the atmospheric pressure.&lt;ref name = tyson&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tyson |first1=P.D.|last2=Preston-White|first2=R.A. |title=The weather and climate of Southern Africa. |location=Cape Town |publisher=Oxford University Press |publication-date=2013| pages= 3–10, 14–16, 360|isbn=9780195718065 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At sea level, where the [[ambient pressure]] is about 100&amp;nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|kPa]], oxygen contributes 21% of the atmosphere and the partial pressure of oxygen ({{math|''P''&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;}}) is 21&amp;nbsp;kPa (i.e. 21% of 100&amp;nbsp;kPa). At the summit of [[Mount Everest]], {{convert|8848|m|ft}}, where the total atmospheric pressure is 33.7&amp;nbsp;kPa, oxygen still contributes 21% of the atmosphere but its partial pressure is only 7.1&amp;nbsp;kPa (i.e. 21% of 33.7&amp;nbsp;kPa = 7.1&amp;nbsp;kPa).&lt;ref name = tyson /&gt; Therefore, a greater volume of air must be inhaled at altitude than at sea level in order to breath in the same amount of oxygen in a given period.

During inhalation, air is warmed and saturated with [[Vapour pressure of water|water vapor]] as it passes through the nose and [[pharynx]] before it enters the alveoli. The ''saturated'' vapor pressure of water is dependent only on temperature; at a body core temperature of 37&amp;nbsp;°C it is 6.3&amp;nbsp;kPa (47.0&amp;nbsp;mmHg), regardless of any other influences, including altitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Diem |first1=K. |last2=Lenter| first2= C.|title=Scientific Tables| location=Basle, Switzerland|publisher=Ciba-Geigy |publication-date=1970|edition= Seventh| pages= 257–258 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, at sea level, the ''tracheal'' air (immediately before the inhaled air enters the alveoli) consists of: water vapor ({{math|''P''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;}} = 6.3&amp;nbsp;kPa), nitrogen ({{math|''P''&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;}} = 74.0&amp;nbsp;kPa), oxygen ({{math|''P''&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;}} = 19.7&amp;nbsp;kPa) and trace amounts of carbon dioxide and other gases, a total of 100&amp;nbsp;kPa. In dry air, the {{math|''P''&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;}} at sea level is 21.0&amp;nbsp;kPa, compared to a {{math|''P''&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;}} of 19.7&amp;nbsp;kPa in the tracheal air (21% of [100 – 6.3] = 19.7&amp;nbsp;kPa). At the summit of Mount Everest tracheal air has a total pressure of 33.7&amp;nbsp;kPa, of which 6.3&amp;nbsp;kPa is water vapor,  reducing the {{math|''P''&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;}} in the tracheal air to 5.8&amp;nbsp;kPa (21% of [33.7 – 6.3] = 5.8&amp;nbsp;kPa), beyond what is accounted for by a reduction of atmospheric pressure alone (7.1&amp;nbsp;kPa).

The [[pressure gradient]] forcing air into the lungs during inhalation is also reduced by altitude. Doubling the volume of the lungs halves the pressure in the lungs at any altitude. Halving the sea level air pressure (100&amp;nbsp;kPa) results in a pressure gradient of 50&amp;nbsp;kPa but doing the same at 5500&amp;nbsp;m, where the atmospheric pressure is 50&amp;nbsp;kPa, a doubling of the volume of the lungs results in a pressure gradient of only 25&amp;nbsp;kPa. In practice, because we breathe in a gentle, cyclical manner that generates pressure gradients of only 2–3&amp;nbsp;kPa, this has little effect on the actual rate of inflow into the lungs and is easily compensated for by breathing slightly deeper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Koen |first1=Chrisvan L. |last2=Koeslag |first2=Johan H. | title=On the stability of subatmospheric intrapleural and intracranial pressures |journal= News in Physiological Sciences | publication-date=1995 |volume=10 |pages=176–178 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=West |first1=J.B. |title=Respiratory physiology: the essentials. |location=Baltimore |publisher=Williams &amp; Wilkins |publication-date=1985| pages= 21–30, 84–84, 98–101 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lower [[viscosity]] of air at altitude allows air to flow more easily and this also helps compensate for any loss of pressure gradient.

All of the above effects of low atmospheric pressure on breathing are normally accommodated by increasing the respiratory minute volume (the volume of air breathed in  – ''or'' out – per minute), and the mechanism for doing this is automatic. The exact increase required is determined by the [[Homeostasis#Blood partial pressure of oxygen and carbon dioxide|respiratory gases homeostatic mechanism]], which regulates the arterial {{math|''P''&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''P''&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;}}. This [[Homeostasis|homeostatic mechanism]] prioritizes the regulation of the arterial {{math|''P''&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;}} over that of oxygen at sea level. That is to say, at sea level the arterial {{math|''P''&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;}} is maintained at very close to 5.3&amp;nbsp;kPa (or 40&amp;nbsp;mmHg) under a wide range of circumstances, at the expense of the arterial {{math|''P''&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;}}, which is allowed to vary within a very wide range of values, before eliciting a corrective ventilatory response. However, when the atmospheric pressure (and therefore the atmospheric {{math|''P''&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;}}) falls to below 75% of its value at sea level, oxygen [[homeostasis]] is given priority over carbon dioxide homeostasis. This switch-over occurs at an elevation of about {{convert|2500|m|ft}}. If this switch occurs relatively abruptly, the hyperventilation at high altitude will cause a severe fall in the arterial {{math|''P''&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;}} with a consequent rise in the [[Homeostasis#Extracellular fluid pH|pH of the arterial plasma]] leading to [[respiratory alkalosis]]. This is one contributor to [[Altitude sickness|high altitude sickness]]. On the other hand, if the switch to oxygen homeostasis is incomplete, then [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] may complicate the clinical picture with potentially fatal results.

===Breathing at depth===
[[File:Breathing Resistance.svg|thumb|300px|Typical breathing effort when breathing through a diving regulator]]
Pressure increases with the depth of water at the rate of about one [[Atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]] – slightly more than 100 kPa, or one [[Bar (unit)|bar]], for every 10 metres.  Air breathed underwater by [[underwater diving|divers]] is at the ambient pressure of the surrounding water and this has a complex range of physiological and biochemical implications.  If not properly managed, breathing compressed gasses underwater may lead to several [[diving disorder]]s which include [[Barotrauma#Pulmonary barotrauma|pulmonary barotrauma]], [[decompression sickness]], [[nitrogen narcosis]], and [[oxygen toxicity]].  The effects of breathing gasses under pressure are further complicated by the use of one or more [[Breathing gas|special gas mixtures]].

Air is provided by a [[diving regulator]], which reduces the high pressure in a [[diving cylinder]] to the ambient pressure. The [[breathing performance of regulators]] is a factor when choosing a suitable regulator for the [[Scuba diving#Types of diving|type of diving]] to be undertaken. It is desirable that breathing from a regulator requires low effort even when supplying large amounts of air. It is also recommended that it supplies air smoothly without any sudden changes in resistance while inhaling or exhaling. In the graph, right, note the initial spike in pressure on exhaling to open the exhaust valve and that the initial drop in pressure on inhaling is soon overcome as the [[Venturi effect]] designed into the regulator to allow an easy draw of air. Many regulators have an adjustment to change the ease of inhaling so that breathing is effortless.

==Respiratory disorders==

Abnormal breathing patterns include [[Kussmaul breathing]], [[Biot's respiration]] and [[Cheyne–Stokes respiration]].

Other breathing disorders include [[shortness of breath]] (dyspnea), [[stridor]], [[apnea]], [[sleep apnea]] (most commonly [[obstructive sleep apnea]]), [[mouth breathing]], and [[snoring]]. Many conditions are associated with obstructed airways. [[Hypopnea]] refers to overly [[shallow breathing]]; [[hyperpnea]] refers to fast and deep breathing brought on by a demand for more oxygen, as for example by exercise. The terms [[hypoventilation]] and [[hyperventilation]] also refer to shallow breathing and fast and deep breathing respectively, but under inappropriate circumstances or disease. However, this distinction (between, for instance, hyperpnea and hyperventilation) is not always adhered to, so that these terms are frequently used interchangeably.&lt;ref name="Dorlands"&gt;{{Citation |last1=Andreoli| first1= Thomas E.|last2 = et. al.| publisher = Saunders |title=Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary |edition= 30th |pages= 887, 891, 897, 900 |location= Philadelphia, PA |url=http://dorlands.com/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A range of [[breath test]]s can be used to diagnose diseases such as dietary intolerances.
A [[rhinomanometry|rhinomanometer]] uses acoustic technology to examine the air flow through the nasal passages.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |page=101 |title=Functional Reconstructive Nasal Surgery |author1=E. H. Huizing |author2=J. A. M. de Groot |year=2003 |isbn=978-1-58890-081-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==
The word "spirit" comes from the [[Latin]] ''spiritus'', meaning breath. Historically, breath has often been considered in terms of the concept of life force. The [[Hebrew Bible]] refers to God breathing the breath of life into clay to make Adam a living soul ([[nephesh]]). It also refers to the breath as returning to God when a mortal dies. The terms [[spirit]], [[prana]], the Polynesian [[mana]], the Hebrew [[ruach]] and the [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]] in psychology are related to the concept of breath.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wordinfo.info/words/index/info/view_unit/2730/6/?spage=14&amp;letter=P psych-, psycho-, -psyche, -psychic, -psychical, -psychically + (Greek: mind, spirit, consciousness; mental processes; the human soul; breath of life)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[T'ai chi]], [[aerobic exercise]] is combined with specific breathing exercises to strengthen the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm muscles]], improve posture and make better use of the body's [[Qi]], (energy). Different forms of [[meditation]], and [[yoga]] advocate various breathing methods. A form of [[Buddhist meditation]] called [[anapanasati]] meaning mindfulness of breath was first introduced by [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. Breathing disciplines are incorporated into [[meditation]], certain forms of [[yoga]] such as [[pranayama]], and the [[Buteyko method]] as a treatment for asthma and other conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Swami Saradananda, The Power of Breath, Castle House: Duncan Baird Publishers, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In music, some [[wind instrument]] players use a technique called [[circular breathing]].  [[Singing|Singers]] also rely on [[Singing#Breath control|breath control]].

Common cultural expressions related to breathing include: "to catch my breath", "took my breath away", "inspiration", "to expire", "get my breath back".

===Breathing and mood===
Certain breathing patterns have a tendency to occur with certain moods. Due to this relationship, practitioners of various disciplines consider that they can encourage the occurrence of a particular mood by adopting the breathing pattern that it most commonly occurs in conjunction with. For instance, and perhaps the most common recommendation, is that deeper breathing which utilises the diaphragm and abdomen more can encourage a more relaxed and confident mood. Practitioners of different disciplines often interpret the importance of breathing regulation and its perceived influence on mood in different ways. Buddhists may consider that it helps precipitate a sense of inner-peace, holistic healers that it encourages an overall state of health&lt;ref&gt;Hobert, Ingfried, 'Healthy Breathing – The Right Breathing' in ''Guide to Holistic Healing in the New Millenium'', Munchen: Verlag Peter Erd, 1999, pp. 48–49&lt;/ref&gt; and business advisers that it provides relief from work based stress.

===Breathing and physical exercise===
During physical exercise a deeper breathing pattern is adopted to facilitate greater oxygen absorption. An additional reason for the adoption of a deeper breathing pattern is to strengthen the body’s core. During the process of deep breathing, the thoracic diaphragm adopts a lower position in the core and this helps to generate intra-abdominal pressure which strengthens the lumbar spine.&lt;ref&gt;http://hanslindgren.com/articles/diaphragm-function-for-core-stability/&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, this allows for more powerful physical movements to be performed. As such, it is frequently recommended when lifting heavy weights to take a deep breath or adopt a deeper breathing pattern.

'''Carbon neutrality''', or having a '''net zero carbon footprint''', refers to achieving net zero [[carbon emissions]] by balancing a measured amount of carbon released with an equivalent amount sequestered or offset, or buying enough [[carbon credits]] to make up the difference. It is used in the context of carbon dioxide releasing processes associated with transportation, energy production, and industrial processes such as production of [[carbon neutral fuel]].

The carbon neutrality concept may be extended to include other greenhouse gases (GHG) measured in terms of their carbon dioxide equivalence ([[Carbon dioxide equivalent|{{CO2}}e]]) —the impact a GHG has on the atmosphere expressed in the equivalent amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The term "'''climate neutral'''" reflects the broader inclusiveness of other greenhouse gases in climate change, even if CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the most abundant, encompassing other greenhouse gases regulated by the [[Kyoto Protocol]], namely: [[methane]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), [[nitrous oxide]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), [[hydrofluorocarbons]] (HFC), [[perfluorocarbons]] (PFC), and [[sulphur hexafluoride]] (SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;). Both terms are used interchangeably throughout this article.

The best practice for organizations and individuals seeking carbon neutral status entails reducing and/or avoiding carbon emissions first so that only unavoidable emissions are offset.  Carbon neutral status is commonly achieved in two ways:
*Balancing [[carbon dioxide]] released into the atmosphere from burning [[fossil fuel]]s, with [[renewable energy]] that creates a similar amount of useful energy, so that the carbon emissions are compensated, or alternatively using only renewable energies that don't produce any carbon dioxide (also called a post-carbon economy).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eejitsguides.com/environment/carbon-neutral.html Carbon Neutral - What Does it Mean?], ''eejitsguides.com'', published 2006, accessed 2007-07-03&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Carbon offset]]ting by paying others to remove or sequester 100% of the carbon dioxide emitted from the atmosphere&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/29/weekinreview/29revkin.html?ex=1335499200&amp;en=d9e2407e4f1a20f0&amp;ei=5124 Carbon-Neutral Is Hip, but Is It Green?], ''[[The New York Times]]'', published 2007-04-29, accessed 2007-08-03&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– for example by [[forestation|planting trees]]&amp;nbsp;– or by funding '[[carbon project]]s' that should lead to the prevention of future greenhouse gas emissions, or by buying [[carbon credit]]s to remove (or 'retire') them through [[emissions trading|carbon trading]]. While carbon offsetting is often used alongside [[energy conservation]] measures to minimize energy use, the practice is [[#Offesetting|criticized]] by some.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carbontradewatch.org/pubs/carbon_neutral_myth.pdf |title=The Carbon Neutral Myth |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept may be extended to include other [[greenhouse gas]]es measured in terms of their [[carbon dioxide equivalent|carbon dioxide equivalence]]. The phrase was the ''[[New Oxford American Dictionary]]'''s Word of the Year for 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.oup.com/2006/11/carbon_neutral_/ |title=Carbon Neutral: Oxford Word of the Year |publisher=Blog.oup.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
Carbon neutrality is usually achieved by combining the following steps (although these may vary depending whether the strategy is implemented by individuals, companies, organizations, cities, regions, or countries):

===Commitment===
In the case of individuals, decision-making is likely to be straightforward, but for more complex set-ups, it usually requires political leadership at the highest level and wide popular agreement that the effort is worth making.

===Counting and analyzing===
Counting and analyzing the emissions that need to be eliminated, and the options for doing so, is the most crucial step in the cycle as it enables setting the priorities for action&amp;nbsp;– from the products purchased to energy use and transport&amp;nbsp;– and to start monitoring progress. This can be achieved through a GHG inventory that aims at answering questions such as:
*Which operations, activities, units should be included?
*Which sources should be included (see section Direct and indirect emissions)?
*Who is responsible for which emissions?
*Which gases should be included?
For individuals, carbon calculators simplify compiling an inventory. Typically they measure electricity consumption in kWh, the amount and type of fuel used to heat water and warm the house, and how many kilometres an individual drives, flies and rides in different vehicles. Individuals may also set various limits of the system they are concerned with, e.g. personal GHG emissions, household emissions, or the company they work for.&lt;br /&gt;
There are plenty of carbon calculators available online, which vary significantly in their usefulness and the parameters they measure. Some, for example, factor in only cars, aircraft and household energy use. Others cover household waste or leisure interests as well.
In some circumstances, actually going beyond carbon neutral (usually after a certain length of time taken to reach carbon breakeven) is an objective.

===Action===
In starting to work towards climate neutrality, businesses and local administrations can make use of an environmental (or sustainability) management system or EMS established by the international standard ISO 14001 (developed by the International Organization for Standardization). Another EMS framework is EMAS, the European Eco Management and Audit Scheme, used by numerous companies throughout the EU. Many local authorities apply the management system to certain sectors of their administration or certify their whole operations.

===Reduction===
One of the strongest arguments for reducing GHG emissions is that it will often save money. Energy prices across the world are rising, making it harder to afford to travel, heat and light homes and factories, and keep a modern economy ticking over. So it is both common sense and sensible for the climate to use energy as sparingly as possible.
Examples of possible actions to reduce GHG emissions are:
*Limiting energy usage and emissions from transportation (walking, using bicycles or public transport, avoiding flying, using low-energy vehicles), as well as from buildings, equipment, animals and processes.
*Obtaining electricity and other energy from a renewable energy source, either directly by generating it (installing solar panels on the roof for example) or by selecting an approved green energy provider, and by using low-carbon alternative fuels such as sustainable biofuels.

===Offsetting===
The use of [[Carbon offset]]s aims to neutralize a certain volume of GHG emissions by funding projects which should cause an equivalent reduction of GHG emissions somewhere else, such as tree planting. Under the premise “First reduce what you can, then offset the remainder”, offsetting can be done by supporting a responsible carbon project, or by buying [[carbon offset]]s or [[carbon credit]]s.

Carbon offsetting is also a tool for severals local authorities in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Kebe A., V. Bellassen &amp; A. Leseur (2011) "Voluntary carbon offsetting by local authorities: practices and lessons" Climat report n.29, CDC Climat&lt;/ref&gt;

in 2015, the UNFCCC, following the mandate of the CDM Executive board, launched a dedicated website where organizations, companies, but also private person are able to offset their footprint (https://offset.climateneutralnow.org/) with the aim of facilitating everyone's participation in the process of promoting sustainability.

Offsetting is sometimes seen as a charged and contentious issue. For example, [[James Hansen]] describes offsets as "modern day indulgences, sold to an increasingly carbon-conscious public to absolve their climate sins."

===Evaluation and repeating===
This phase includes evaluation of the results and compilation of a list of suggested improvements, with results documented and reported, so that experience gained of what does (and does not) work is shared with those who can put it to good use.&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, with all that completed, the cycle starts all over again, only this time incorporating the lessons learned. Science and technology move on, regulations become tighter, the standards people demand go up. So the second cycle will go further than the first, and the process will continue, each successive phase building on and improving on what went before.

Being carbon neutral is increasingly seen as good [[corporate social responsibility|corporate]] or state social responsibility and a growing list of corporations and states are announcing dates for when they intend to become fully neutral.
Events such as the [[G8 Summit]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Geoghegan |first=Tom |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4614713.stm |title=The G8 summit promises to be a "carbon-neutral" event |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-06-07 |accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and organizations like the [[World Bank]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=GreenBiz Admin |url=http://www.greenbiz.com/news/news_third.cfm?NewsID=31240 |title=GreenBiz News &amp;#124;World Bank Group Goes Carbon-Neutral |publisher=Greenbiz.com |date=2006-06-04 |accessdate=2013-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080329142043/http://www.greenbiz.com/news/news_third.cfm?NewsID=31240 |archivedate=2008-03-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; are also using offset schemes to become carbon neutral. Artists like [[The Rolling Stones]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=ClimateBiz Staff |url=http://www.greenbiz.com/news/news_third.cfm?NewsID=25589 |title=GreenBiz News &amp;#124;Rolling Stones Pledge Carbon-Neutral U.K. Tour |publisher=Greenbiz.com |date=2003-09-04 |accessdate=2013-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060508230810/http://www.greenbiz.com/news/news_third.cfm?NewsID=25589 |archivedate=2006-05-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pink Floyd]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=76033 |title=Pink Floyd breathe life into new forests |publisher=prnewswire.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; have made albums or tours carbon neutral.

==Direct and indirect emissions==
To be considered carbon neutral, an organization must reduce its [[carbon footprint]] to zero. Determining what to include in the carbon footprint depends upon the organization and the standards they are following.

Generally, direct emissions sources must be reduced and offset completely, while indirect emissions from purchased electricity can be reduced with renewable energy purchases.

Direct emissions include all pollution from manufacturing, company owned vehicles and reimbursed travel, livestock and any other source that is directly controlled by the owner.  Indirect emissions include all emissions that result from the use or purchase of a product.  For instance, the direct emissions of an airline are all the jet fuel that is burned, while the indirect emissions include manufacture and disposal of airplanes, all the electricity used to operate the airline's office, and the daily emissions from employee travel to and from work.  In another example, the power company has a direct emission of greenhouse gas, while the office that purchases it considers it an indirect emission.

==Simplification of standards and definitions==
Carbon neutral fuels are those that neither contribute to nor reduce the amount of carbon into the atmosphere. Before an agency can certify an organization or individual as carbon neutral, it is important to specify whether indirect emissions are included in the Carbon Footprint calculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://standardcarbon.com/resources/?p=25%5D|title=Carbon footprints will decrease in the Future » Standard Carbon|author=|date=|website=standardcarbon.com|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Voluntary Carbon neutral certifiers such as [http://www.standardcarbon.com Standard Carbon] in the US, require both direct and indirect sources to be reduced and offset. As an example, for an organization to be certified carbon neutral by [http://www.standardcarbon.com Standard Carbon], it must offset all direct and indirect emissions from travel by 1&amp;nbsp;lb CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e per passenger mile, and all non-electricity direct emissions 100%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.standardcarbon.com/ecatalog/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=1 Carbon Neutral Certification Guidelines] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071112034949/http://www.standardcarbon.com/ecatalog/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=1 |date=November 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Indirect electrical purchases must be equalized either with offsets, or renewable energy purchase. This standard differs slightly from the widely used World Resource Institute and may be easier to calculate and apply.

Much of the confusion in carbon neutral standards can be attributed to the number of voluntary carbon standards which are available. For organizations looking at which carbon offsets to purchase, knowing which standards are robust, credible and permanent is vital in choosing the right carbon offsets and projects to get involved in. Some of the main standards in the voluntary market include; [http://www.v-c-s.org The Verified Carbon Standard], [http://www.goldstandard.org The Gold Standard], [http://americancarbonregistry.org/ The American Carbon Registry], [http://www.climateactionreserve.org/ The Climate Action Reserve], and [http://www.planvivo.org/ Plan Vivo]. In addition companies can purchase Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) which result from mitigated carbon emissions from [http://www.unfccc.int UNFCCC] approved projects for voluntary purposes. 
The concept of shared resources also reduces the volume of carbon a particular organization has to offset, with all upstream and downstream emissions the responsibility of other organizations or individuals. If all organizations and individuals were involved then this would not result in any double accounting.

Regarding terminology in UK and Ireland, in December 2011 the Advertising Standards Authority (in an ASA decision which was upheld by its Independent Reviewer, Sir Hayden Phillips) controversially ruled that no manufactured product can be marketed as "zero carbon", because carbon was inevitably emitted during its manufacture. This decision was made in relation to a solar panel system whose embodied carbon was repaid during 1.2 years of use and it appears to mean that no buildings or manufactured products can legitimately be described as zero carbon in its jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solartwin.com/zero-carbon-homes-face-imminent-asa-ban |title=Article with references to ASA documentation banning marketing of "Zero Carbon" |publisher=Solartwin.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pledges==
Being carbon neutral is increasingly seen as good corporate or state social responsibility and a growing list of corporations, cities and states are announcing dates for when they intend to become fully neutral.

===Companies and organizations===
The original Climate Neutral Network was an Oregon-based non-profit organization founded by Sue Hall and incorporated in 1999 to persuade companies that being climate neutral was potentially cost saving as well as environmentally sustainable. It developed both the Climate Neutral Certification and Climate Cool brand name with key stakeholders such as the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], [[The Nature Conservancy]], the [[Rocky Mountain Institute]], Conservation International, and the World Resources Institute and succeeded in enrolling the 2002 Winter Olympics to compensate for its associated greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ellison |first=Katherine |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2002/07/08/325856/index.htm |title=Burn Oil, Then Help A School Out; It All Evens Out |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=2002-07-08 |accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The non-profit's web site as of March 2011,  lists the organization as closing its doors and plans to continue the Climate Cool upon transfer to a new non-profit organization, unknown at this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://climateneutralnetwork.org/ |title=www.climateneutralnetwork.org |publisher=www.climateneutralnetwork.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The for-profit consulting firm Climate Neutral Business Network listed the same Sue Hall as CEO and many of the same companies who were participants in the original Climate Neutral Network as consulting clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://climateneutral.com |title=Climate Neutral Business Network |publisher=Climateneutral.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Few companies have actually attained Climate Neutral Certification, applying to a rigorous review process and establishing that they have achieved absolute net zero or better impact on the world's climate. Shaklee Corporation became the first Climate Neutral certified company in April 2000. The company employs a variety of investments, and offset activities, including tree-planting, use of solar energy, methane capture in abandoned mines and its manufacturing processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.greenbiz.com/news/2002/05/16/shaklee-heats-environmental-commitment-going-climate-cool |title=SShaklee Heats Up Environmental Commitment By Going Climate Cool|publisher=Greenbiz.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate Neutral Business Network states that it certified Dave Matthews Band's concert tour as Climate Neutral. The Christian Science Monitor criticized the use of NativeEnergy. a for-profit company that sells offsets credits to businesses and celebrities like Dave Matthews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/2010/0420/Is-Dave-Matthews-carbon-offsets-provider-really-carbon-neutral/(page)/2 |title=Is Dave Matthews' carbon offsets provider really carbon neutral? |publisher=CSMonitor.com |date=2010-04-20 |accessdate=2012-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Salt Spring Coffee]] has become [[carbon neutral]] by lowering emissions through reducing long-range trucking and using [[bio-diesel]] fuel in delivery trucks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Smith |first=Charlie |title= Biodiesel Revolution Gathering Momentum |work= [[The Georgia Straight]] |date=September 9, 2004 |url= https://www.straight.com/article/biodiesel-revolution-gathering-momentum?# |accessdate= July 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; upgrading to energy efficient equipment and purchasing [[carbon offsets]].

Under the leadership of [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]], the [[United Nations]] pledged to work towards climate neutrality in December 2007. The [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) announced it was becoming climate neutral in 2008 and established a Climate Neutral Network to promote the idea in February 2008.

Events such as the G8 Summit and organizations like the World Bank are also using offset schemes to become carbon neutral. Artists like [[The Rolling Stones]] and [[Pink Floyd]] have made albums or tours carbon neutral, while [[Live Earth]] says that its seven concerts held on 7 July 2007 were the largest carbon neutral public event in history.

The Vancouver 2010 [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] and Paralympic Winter Games were the first carbon neutral Games in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.offsetters.ca/about-us/olympic-games/ |title=Offsetting the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Winter Games |publisher=Offsetters.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buildings are the largest single contributor to the production of greenhouse gases. The [[American Institute of Architects]] 2030 Commitment is a voluntary program for AIA member firms and other entities in the built environment that asks these organizations to pledge to design all their buildings to be carbon neutral by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dexigner.com/news/17758 |title=AIA Introduces 2030 Commitment Program to Reach Goal of Carbon Neutrality by 2030 |publisher=Dexigner.com |date=2009-05-05 |accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, architectural firm [[Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum|HOK]] worked with energy and daylighting consultant The Weidt Group to design a {{convert|170735|sqft|m2|adj=on}} net zero carbon emissions Class A office building prototype in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metropolismag.com/pov/20101119/a-net-zero-office-today A Net Zero Office Today] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205002811/http://www.metropolismag.com/pov/20101119/a-net-zero-office-today |date=December 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Countries and communities===

One country has achieved carbon neutrality:
* {{flagicon|Bhutan}} [[Bhutan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/destinations/asia/bhutan/carbon-negative-country-sustainability/|title=Visit the World's Only Carbon-Negative Country|date=2017-10-17|access-date=2018-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several places have pledged carbon neutrality, including:

====Canada====
In June 2011, the Canadian Province of [[British Columbia]] announced they had officially become the first provincial/state jurisdiction in North America to achieve carbon neutrality in public sector operations:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livesmartbc.ca/blog/2011/bc-government-announces-carbon-neutrality.html |title=Carbon Neutral B.C., LiveSmart BC |publisher=Livesmartbc.ca |date=2011-06-30 |accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; every school, hospital, university, Crown corporation, and government office measured, reported and purchased [[carbon offsets]] on all their 2010 [[Greenhouse Gas]] emissions as required under legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/ID/freeside/392_2008 |title=Greenhouse Gas Reduction Targets Act, Carbon Neutral Government Regulation, BC Laws |publisher=Bclaws.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local Governments across B.C. are also beginning to declare Carbon Neutrality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toolkit.bc.ca/resource/climate-action-charter-b-c-communities-commit-carbon-neutrality-2012 |title=B.C.

new natural gas production will come from the [[Horn River Formation|Horn River basin]] where about 500 million tonnes of CO2 will be released into the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bluefuelenergy.com/co2/|title=Blue Fuel Energy - BC's CO2 emissions problem|author=|date=|website=bluefuelenergy.com|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/environment/climate-change/policy-legislation-and-responses/2012-progress-to-targets.pdf pg15&lt;/ref&gt;

====Costa Rica====
[[Costa Rica]] aims to be fully carbon neutral by 2021.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unep.org/CLIMATENEUTRAL/Default.aspx?tabid=235 UNEP Climate Neutral Network: Costa Rica] Retrieved on 2011-10-12.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, 46.7% of Costa Rica's [[primary energy]] came from renewable sources,&lt;ref&gt;Share of Total Primary Energy Supply in 2004, ''[[International Energy Agency]]'', published 2006, accessed 2007-08-06&lt;/ref&gt; while 94% of its [[electricity]] was generated from [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power]], [[wind farm]]s and [[geothermal energy]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e2.org/jsp/controller?docId=13225#costarica President Aims for Carbon Neutrality], ''Environmental Entrepreneurs'', published 2007-06-28, accessed 2007-08-06&lt;/ref&gt; A 3.5% tax on gasoline in the country is used for payments to compensate landowners for growing trees and protecting forests and its government is making further plans for reducing emissions from transport, farming and industry.

====Denmark====
[[Samsø]] island in Denmark is the largest carbon-neutral settlement on the planet, with a population of 4200, based on wind-generated electricity and biomass-based district heating.  They currently generate extra wind power and export the electricity to compensate for petro-fueled vehicles.  There are future hopes of using electric or biofuel vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kolbert |first=Elizabeth |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/07/07/080707fa_fact_kolbert?currentPage=all |title=A Reporter at Large: The Island in the Wind |publisher=The New Yorker |date=2011-08-01 |accessdate=2012-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.climateneutral.unep.org/cnn_members.aspx?m=112 "Participants &gt; Countries &gt; New Zealand"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211191751/http://www.climateneutral.unep.org/cnn_members.aspx?m=112 |date=December 11, 2008 }}. UNEP Climate Neutral Network.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080430164109/http://www.climateneutral.unep.org/cnn_members.aspx?m=130 "Participants &gt; Countries &gt; Iceland"]. UNEP Climate Neutral Network.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Iceland====
Iceland is also moving towards climate neutrality. Over 99% of electricity production and almost 80% of total energy production comes from hydropower and geothermal. No other nation uses such a high proportion of renewable energy resources.
In February 2008, Costa Rica, Iceland, New Zealand and Norway were the first four countries to join the Climate Neutral Network, an initiative led by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) to catalyze global action towards low carbon economies and societies.

====Maldives====
The [[Mohamed Nasheed|ex-president of the Maldives]] has pledged to make his country carbon-neutral within a decade by moving to wind and solar energy. The [[Maldives]], a country consisting of very low-lying islands, would be one of the first countries to be submerged due to [[sea level rise]]. The Maldives presided over the foundation of the [[Climate Vulnerable Forum]].

====New Zealand====
Another nation to pledge carbon neutrality is New Zealand. Its Carbon Neutral Public Sector Initiative aimed to offset the greenhouse gas emissions of an initial group of six governmental agencies by 2012. Unavoidable emissions would be offset, primarily through indigenous forest regeneration projects on conservation land. All 34 public service agencies also needed to have emission reduction plans in place. The Carbon Neutral Public Service programme was discontinued in March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfe.govt.nz/issues/sustainability/public-service-carbon-neutrality.html |title=Public service takes lead in becoming carbon neutral &amp;#124; Ministry for the Environment |publisher=Mfe.govt.nz |date=2009-06-12 |accessdate=2012-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Norway====
On April 19, 2007, Prime Minister [[Jens Stoltenberg]] announced to the [[Norwegian Labour Party|Labour Party]] annual congress that [[Norway]]'s [[greenhouse gas]] emissions would be cut by 10 percent more than its Kyoto commitment by 2012, and that the government had agreed to achieve emission cuts of 30% by 2020. He also proposed that Norway should become carbon neutral by 2050, and called upon other rich countries to do likewise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/smk/primeminister/Prime-Minister-Jens-Stoltenberg/Speeches-and-Articles/2007/Speech-to-the-congress-of-the-Labour-Par.html?id=463749 |title=Speech to the congress of the Labour Party |publisher=regjeringen.no |date=2007-04-19 |accessdate=2012-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This carbon neutrality would be achieved partly by [[carbon offset]]ting, a proposal criticised by [[Greenpeace]], who also called on Norway to take responsibility for the 500m tonnes of emissions caused by its exports of oil and gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=3057439&amp;page=2 |title=Science News &amp;#124; Technology News - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2011-12-04 |accessdate=2012-02-09 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[World Wildlife Fund]] Norway also believes that the purchase of carbon offsets is unacceptable, saying 'it is a political stillbirth to believe that [[China]] will quietly accept that Norway will buy climate quotas abroad'.&lt;ref name="norwaypost.no"&gt;[http://www.norwaypost.no/cgi-bin/norwaypost/imaker?id=71002 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929092923/http://www.norwaypost.no/cgi-bin/norwaypost/imaker?id=71002 |date=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Norwegian environmental activist [[Bellona Foundation]] believes that the prime minister was forced to act due to pressure from anti-[[European Union]] members of the [[coalition]] government, and called the announcement 'visions without content'.&lt;ref name="norwaypost.no"/&gt;
In January 2008 the Norwegian government went a step further and declared a goal of being carbon neutral by 2030.  But the government has not been specific about any plans to reduce emissions at home; the plan is based on buying carbon offsets from other countries, and very little has actually been done to reduce Norway's emissions, apart from a very successful [[Plug-in electric vehicles in Norway|policy for electric vehicles]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosenthal |first=Elisabeth |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/22/world/europe/22norway.html?pagewanted=print |title=Lofty Pledge to Cut Emissions Comes With Caveat in Norway - New York Times |location=Norway |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2008-03-22 |accessdate=2012-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spain====
In Spain, in 2014, the island of [[El Hierro]] became carbon neutral (for its power production).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2014/09/17/349223674/tiny-spanish-island-nears-its-goal-100-percent-renewable-energy|title=Tiny Spanish Island Nears Its Goal: 100 Percent Renewable Energy|author=|date=|website=npr.org|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/20/clean-energy-beacons-of-the-world|title=From Kansas to Copenhagen: clean energy beacons around the world|first=Karl|last=Mathiesen|date=20 May 2015|website=the Guardian|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the city of [[Logroño Montecorvo]] in La Rioja will be carbon neutral once completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inhabitat.com/mvrdv-logrono-motecorvo-eco-city/|title=Spain's Carbon-Neutral Ecotopia Gets the Green Light|author=|date=|website=inhabitat.com|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arch2o.com/carbon-neutral-city-in-la-rioja-spain-mvrdvgras/|title=Carbon-Neutral City in La Rioja, Spain - MVRDV+GRAS - Arch2O.com|author=|date=14 June 2012|website=arch2o.com|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scotland====
The islands of Orkney have significant wind and marine energy resources, and [[Renewable energy in Scotland|renewable energy]] has recently come into prominence. Although Orkney is connected to the mainland, it generates over 100% of its net power from renewables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Llewelyn|first1=Robert|title=Orkney Island of the future|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXe1hBvlylw|website=Fully Charged|publisher=[[Robert Llewelyn]]|accessdate=20 May 2015|ref=Kryten}}&lt;/ref&gt; This comes mainly from wind turbines situated right across Orkney.

====Sweden====
[[Sweden]] aims to become carbon neutral by 2045.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://inhabitat.com/sweden-passes-law-to-become-carbon-neutral-by-2045/|title=Sweden passes law to become carbon neutral by 2045|access-date=2018-01-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vision is that net greenhouse gas emissions should be zero. The overall objective is that the increase in global temperature should be limited to two degrees, and that the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere stabilizes at a maximum of 400 ppm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.naturvardsverket.se/Om-Naturvardsverket/Publikationer/ISBN/8600/978-91-620-8608-4/ |title=2050 Ett koldioxidneutralt Sverige |publisher=naturvardsverket.se |date=2013-02-30 |accessdate=2016-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====South Korea====
[[Jeju Island]] aims to be carbon neutral by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7XSihTbVeM |title=Jeju Island aims to become carbon free by 2030 |publisher=Al Jazeera English \}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vatican City====
In July 2007, [[Vatican City]] announced a plan to become the first carbon-neutral state in the world, following the politics of the Pope to eliminate [[global warming]]. The goal would be reached through the donation of the [[Vatican Climate Forest]] in [[Hungary]]. The forest is to be sized to offset the year's carbon dioxide emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news103554442.html |title=The Vatican to go carbon neutral |publisher=Physorg.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, no trees have actually been planted as of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thompson |first=Kalee |url=http://www.popsci.com/environment/article/2008-07/carbon-discredit?page=3 |title=Carbon Discredit &amp;#124; Popular Science |publisher=Popsci.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company KlimaFa is no longer in existence and hasn't fulfilled its promises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Doug Struck |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/2010/0420/Carbon-offsets-How-a-Vatican-forest-failed-to-reduce-global-warming |title=Carbon offsets: How a Vatican forest failed to reduce global warming |publisher=Csmonitor.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2008, the city state also installed and put into operation 2,400 solar panels on the roof of the Paul VI Centre audience hall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cathnews.com/article.aspx?aeid=10416 Pope's first "green audience", Catholic News Service.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208071648/http://www.cathnews.com/article.aspx?aeid=10416 |date=December 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carbon neutral initiatives==
Many initiatives seek to assist individuals, businesses and states in reducing their carbon footprint or achieving climate neutrality. These include website neutralization projects like [http://www.co2stats.com CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Stats] and, the similar European initiative [http://www.co2neutralwebsite.com CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; neutral website] as well as the Climate Neutral Network, Caring for Climate, and Together campaign.

==Certification==
Although there is currently no international certification scheme for carbon or climate neutrality, some countries have established national certification schemes. Examples include Norwegian Eco-Lighthouse Program and the Australian government's [[National Carbon Offset Standard]] (NCOS).

Certifications are also available from the [[Commodity Exchange Bratislava|CEB]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.en.ver.kbb.sk/|title=  CEB VER Registry}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[British Standards Institute|BSI]] ([[BSI PAS 2060|PAS 2060]]) and [[The Carbon Neutral Company|The CarbonNeutral Company]] (CarbonNeutral).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://us.carbonneutral.com/environmental-standards/carbonneutral/ |title=Environmental Standards: Carbon Neutral |publisher=carbonneutral.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718031527/http://us.carbonneutral.com/environmental-standards/carbonneutral/ |archivedate=2012-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate Neutral Certification===
{{advert|section|date=April 2011}}
Climate Neutral Certification was established and trademarked originally through the [[Climate Neutral Network]], an Oregon-based non-profit organization, not to be confused with the UNEP's Climate Neutral Network. Applications for certification are no longer being accepted according to the non-profit organization's web site, where the organization also states it is closing its doors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://climateneutralnetwork.org/index.htm |title=Climateneutralnetwork.org |publisher=Climate Neutral Network |date= |accessdate=2012-02-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009052555/http://climateneutralnetwork.org/index.htm# |archive-date=2009-10-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first three companies certified as Climate Neutral were [[Shaklee Corporation]], [[Interface, Inc.]], and Saunders Hotels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://climateneutralnetwork.org/press/press_three.php|title=Three US Companies Become Climate Neutral|author=|date=|website=climateneutralnetwork.org|accessdate=2 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307003125/http://climateneutralnetwork.org/press/press_three.php#|archive-date=2016-03-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=August 2014}}
Stakeholders in developing and supporting the Climate Neutral Certification are listed as [[The Nature Conservancy]], [[Conservation International]], [[Rocky Mountain Institute]], and the [[U.S EPA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://climateneutralnetwork.org/background.php|title= Background|publisher= Climate Neutral Network|access-date= 2011-03-28|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090201032638/http://climateneutralnetwork.org/background.php#|archive-date= 2009-02-01|dead-url= yes|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; What is unclear is whether the Climate Neutral certification will be continued by the for-profit consulting firm, Climate Neutral Business Network, or another non-profit organization in the future.

Climate Neutral Network also promoted, trademarked, and licensed the brand Climate Cool, for products certified by the organization's Environmental Review Panel and determined to achieve net zero climate impact, by reducing and offsetting associated emissions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://climateneutralnetwork.org/cc_brand.php "CC Brand"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100123120219/http://climateneutralnetwork.org/cc_brand.php# |date=2010-01-23 }}. Climate Neutral Network.&lt;/ref&gt; The organization's website promises to transfer the Climate Cool branding to another non-profit organization, upon closing the current organization.

In Australia, the government-endorsed carbon neutral certification is the [[National Carbon Offset Standard]] (NCOS).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.climatechange.gov.au/ncos "National Carbon Offset Standard"]. climatechange.gov.au.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the plant's 15-year license expired in 2015,&lt;ref name=BWSC1&gt;{{cite web|title=60 MW Colombo Power Barge|url=http://www.bwsc.com/60-MW-Colombo-Power-Barge.aspx?ID=168|publisher=[[Burmeister and Wain Scandinavian Contractor|BWSC]]|accessdate=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Ceylon Electricity Board]] purchased the powership in a controversial deal. It was previously owned by Colombo Power Private Limited, a 50-50 joint venture by [[Mitsui Engineering &amp; Shipbuilding]] and Kawasho Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nizam|first1=Ifham|title=CEB In The Spotlight Over Power Plant Purchase|url=http://www.thesundayleader.lk/2016/02/21/ceb-in-the-spotlight-over-power-plant-purchase/|accessdate=1 July 2017|publisher=[[The Sunday Leader]]|date=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The powership consists of four {{Nowrap|15 [[Megawatt|MW]]}} units, totalling the plant capacity to {{Nowrap|16 [[Megawatt|MW]]}}. Although the plant is estimated to generate {{Nowrap|420 [[GWh]]}} per annum, the actual average generation is {{Nowrap|494 GWh}}, {{Nowrap|74 GWh}} above initial estimates.

'''Copper(II) chloride''' is the [[chemical compound]] with the [[chemical formula]] CuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This is a light brown solid, which slowly absorbs moisture to form a blue-green [[water of crystallization|dihydrate]].  The copper(II) chlorides are some of the most common copper(II) compounds, after [[copper sulfate]].

Both the anhydrous and the dihydrate forms occur naturally as the very rare minerals '''tolbachite''' and '''eriochalcite''', respectively.&lt;ref name="xray18"&gt;Marlene C. Morris, Howard F. McMurdie, Eloise H. Evans, Boris Paretzkin, Harry S. Parker, and Nicolas C. Panagiotopoulos (1981) ''Copper chloride hydrate (eriochalcite)'', in ''[http://digicoll.manoa.hawaii.edu/techreports/PDF/NBS25-18.pdf Standard X-ray Diffraction Powder Patterns] National Bureau of Standards, Monograph 25, Section 18; page 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
Anhydrous CuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adopts a distorted [[cadmium iodide]] structure. In this motif, the copper centers are [[octahedral molecular geometry|octahedral]].  Most copper(II) compounds exhibit distortions from idealized octahedral geometry due to the [[Jahn-Teller effect]], which in this case describes the localization of one d-electron into a [[molecular orbital]] that is strongly antibonding with respect to a pair of chloride ligands. In CuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, the copper again adopts a highly distorted octahedral geometry, the Cu(II) centers being surrounded by two water ligands and four chloride ligands, which [[bridging ligand|bridge]] asymmetrically to other Cu centers.&lt;ref&gt;Wells, A.F. (1984) Structural Inorganic Chemistry, Oxford: Clarendon Press. {{ISBN|0-19-855370-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Copper(II) chloride is paramagnetic.  Of historical interest, CuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O was used in the first [[electron paramagnetic resonance]] measurements by [[Yevgeny Zavoisky]] in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FldqbSffUMgC&amp;pg=PA167|page=167|title=Mechanochemistry in Nanoscience and Minerals Engineering|author=Peter Baláž|publisher=Springer|year=2008|isbn=3-540-74854-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l3F9yUSk-rgC&amp;pg=PA3|page=3|title=Electron paramagnetic resonance: a practitioner's toolkit|author=Marina Brustolon|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=2009|isbn=0-470-25882-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties and reactions==
[[File:CuCl2 equilibrium.JPG|thumb|left|Aqueous solutions of copper(II) chloride. Greenish when high in [Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;], more blue when lower in [Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;].]]
Aqueous solution prepared from copper(II) chloride contain a range of copper(II) complexes depending on concentration, temperature, and the presence of additional chloride ions. These species include blue color of [Cu(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and yellow or red color of the halide complexes of the formula [CuCl&lt;sub&gt;2+x&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;x−&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood, N. N. and Earnshaw, A. (1997). Chemistry of the Elements (2nd Edn.), Oxford:Butterworth-Heinemann. {{ISBN|0-7506-3365-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydrolysis===
[[Copper(II) hydroxide]] precipitates upon treating copper(II) chloride solutions with base:
:CuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 NaOH   →   Cu(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  2 NaCl

[[File:Copper(II)chloride crystal 01.jpg|thumb|left|Copper(II) chloride [[Water of crystallization|dihydrate]] crystal]]

Partial hydrolysis gives copper [[oxychloride]], Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, a popular fungicide.

===Redox===
CuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a mild oxidant. It decomposes to [[Copper(I) chloride|CuCl]] and [[Chlorine|Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] at 1000&amp;nbsp;°C:
:2 CuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 CuCl + Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
CuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reacts with several metals to produce copper metal or copper(I) chloride with oxidation of the other metal. To convert copper(II) chloride to copper(I) derivatives, it can be convenient to reduce an aqueous solution with [[sulfur dioxide]] as the reductant:
:2 CuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  + SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2 CuCl + 2 HCl  + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

===Coordination complexes===
CuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reacts with HCl or other [[chloride]] sources to form complex ions: the red CuCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (it is a dimer in reality, Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;, a couple of tetrahedrons that share an edge), and the green or yellow CuCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Naida S. Gill |author2=F. B. Taylor |journal=Inorganic Syntheses |year=1967 |volume=9 |pages=136–142 |doi=10.1002/9780470132401.ch37 |title=Tetrahalo Complexes of Dipositive Metals in the First Transition Series |isbn=978-0-470-13240-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these complexes can be crystallized from aqueous solution, and they adopt a wide variety of structures.

Copper(II) chloride also forms a variety of [[complex (chemistry)|coordination complexes]] with [[ligand]]s such as [[pyridine]] and [[triphenylphosphine oxide]]:
:CuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;N → [CuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;N)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (tetragonal)
:CuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P=O → [CuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;((C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P=O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (tetrahedral)
However "soft" ligands such as [[phosphine]]s (e.g., [[triphenylphosphine]]), iodide, and cyanide as well as some tertiary [[amine]]s induce [[Redox|reduction]] to give copper(I) complexes.

==Preparation==
Copper(II) chloride is prepared commercially by the action of [[halogenation|chlorination]] of copper:
: Cu + Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  →   CuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2 &lt;/sub&gt;
Copper metal itself cannot be oxidised by hydrochloric acid, but copper-containing bases such as the hydroxide, oxide, or [[copper(II) carbonate]] can be reacted with [[hydrochloric acid]].

Once prepared, a solution of CuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; may be purified by crystallization. A standard method takes the solution mixed in hot dilute [[hydrochloric acid]], and causes the crystals to form by cooling in a [[Calcium chloride|CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]-ice bath.&lt;ref name = bertz&gt;S. H. Bertz, E. H. Fairchild, in ''Handbook of Reagents for Organic Synthesis, Volume 1: Reagents, Auxiliaries and Catalysts for C-C Bond Formation'', (R. M. Coates, S. E. Denmark, eds.), pp. 220-3, Wiley, New York, 1738.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Purification of Laboratory Chemicals|author1=W. L. F. Armarego |author2=Christina Li Lin Chai |pages = 461|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=PTXyS7Yj6zUC&amp;pg=PA461|format = [[Google Books]] excerpt|edition = 6th|isbn = 1-85617-567-7|publisher = Butterworth-Heinemann|date = 2009-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are indirect and rarely used means of using copper ions in solution to form copper(II) chloride. Electrolysis of aqueous sodium chloride with copper electrodes produces (among other things) a blue-green foam that can be collected and converted to the hydrate. While this is not usually done due to the emission of toxic chlorine gas, and the prevalence of the more general [[chloralkali process]], the electrolysis will convert the copper metal to copper ions in solution forming the compound. Indeed, any solution of copper ions can be mixed with hydrochloric acid and made into copper chloride by removing any other ions.

===Natural occurrence===
Copper(II) chloride occurs naturally as the very rare anhydrous mineral tolbachite and the dihydrate eriochalcite.&lt;ref name="xray18"/&gt; Both are found near [[fumarole]]s. More common are mixed oxyhydroxide-chlorides like [[atacamite]] Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl, arising among Cu ore beds oxidation zones in arid climate (also known from some altered slags).

==Uses==

===Cu-catalyst in Wacker process===
A major industrial application for copper(II) chloride is as a [[co-catalyst]] with [[palladium(II) chloride]] in the [[Wacker process]]. In this process, [[ethene]] (ethylene) is converted to [[ethanal]] (acetaldehyde) using water and air. During the reaction, [[Palladium(II) chloride|PdCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] is [[Redox|reduced]] to [[Palladium|Pd]], and the CuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; serves to re-oxidize this back to PdCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Air can then oxidize the resultant [[Copper(I) chloride|CuCl]] back to CuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, completing the cycle.

# C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + PdCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  → CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CHO  + Pd + 2 HCl
# Pd + 2 CuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  → 2 CuCl + PdCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
# 4 CuCl + 4 HCl + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 4 CuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

The overall process is:
:2 C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CHO

===Catalyst in production of chlorine===
Copper(II) chloride is used as a catalyst in a variety of processes that produce chlorine by [[oxychlorination]]. The [[Deacon process]] takes place at about 400 to 450&amp;nbsp;°C in the presence of a copper chloride:
:4 HCl + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Copper(II) chloride catalyzes the chlorination in the production of  [[vinyl chloride]] and [[dichloroethane]].&lt;ref&gt;H.Wayne Richardson, "Copper Compounds" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a07_567}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copper(II) chloride is used in the [[Copper–chlorine cycle]] in which it splits steam into a copper oxygen compound and hydrogen chloride, and is later recovered in the cycle from the electrolysis of copper(I) chloride. Copper is a metal

===Other organic synthetic applications===
Copper(II) chloride has some highly specialized applications in the [[organic synthesis|synthesis of organic compounds]].&lt;ref name = bertz/&gt; It effects [[halogenation|chlorination]] of [[aromatic hydrocarbons]]- this is often performed in the presence of [[aluminium oxide]]. It is able to chlorinate the alpha position of [[carbonyl]] compounds:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=C. E. Castro |author2=E. J. Gaughan |author3=D. C. Owsley |journal = [[Journal of Organic Chemistry]]|volume = 30|pages = 587|year = 1965|doi = 10.1021/jo01013a069|title = Cupric Halide Halogenations|issue = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:[[File:CuCl2 alpha chlorination.png|400px|Alpha chlorination of an aldehyde using CuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.]]

This reaction is performed in a polar solvent such as [[dimethylformamide]] (DMF), often in the presence of [[lithium chloride]], which accelerates the reaction.

CuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, in the presence of [[oxygen]], can also oxidize [[phenols]]. The major product can be directed to give either a [[quinone]] or a coupled product from oxidative dimerization. The latter process provides a high-yield route to [[1,1-binaphthol]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=J. Brussee |author2=J. L. G. Groenendijk |author3=J. M. Koppele |author4=A. C. A.

:[[File:CuCl2 naphthol coupling.png|400px|Coupling of beta-naphthol using CuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.]]
Such compounds are intermediates in the synthesis of [[BINAP]] and its derivatives

Copper(II) chloride dihydrate promotes the hydrolysis of acetonides, i.e., for deprotection to regenerate diols&lt;ref name="Chandrasekhar2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chandrasekhar|first=M. |author2=Kusum L.

CuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; also catalyses the [[free radical]] addition of [[sulfonyl chloride]]s to [[alkene]]s; the alpha-chlorosulfone may then undergo [[Elimination reaction|elimination]] with base to give a vinyl [[sulfone]] product.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

===Niche uses===
Copper(II) chloride is also used in [[pyrotechnics]] as a blue/green coloring agent.   In a [[flame test]], copper chlorides, like all copper compounds, emit green-blue.

In [[humidity indicator card]]s (HICs), cobalt-free brown to azure (copper(II) chloride base) HICs can be found on the market. In 1998, the [[European Community]] (EC) classified items containing cobalt(II) chloride of 0.01 to 1% w/w as T (Toxic), with the corresponding [[R phrase]] of R49 (may cause cancer if inhaled). As a consequence, new cobalt-free humidity indicator cards have been developed that contain copper.

==Safety==
Copper(II) chloride can be toxic.  Only concentrations below 5 ppm are allowed in drinking water by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|US Environmental Protection Agency]].

]]
The '''Dirac sea''' is a theoretical model of the [[vacuum]] as an infinite sea of particles with [[negative energy]]. It was first postulated by the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[physicist]] [[Paul Dirac]] in 1930&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dirac|1930}}&lt;/ref&gt; to explain the anomalous negative-energy [[quantum state]]s predicted by the [[Dirac equation]] for [[theory of relativity|relativistic]] [[electron]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greiner|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[positron]], the [[antimatter]] counterpart of the [[electron]], was originally conceived of as a [[electron hole|hole]] in the Dirac sea, well before its experimental discovery in 1932.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;This was not the original intent of Dirac though, as the title of his 1930 paper (''A Theory of Electrons and Protons'') indicates. But it soon afterwards became clear that the mass of holes must be that of the electron.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon solving the free Dirac equation,

:&lt;math&gt;i\hbar\frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} = (c\hat \boldsymbol \alpha \cdot \hat \boldsymbol p + mc^2\hat \beta)\Psi,&lt;/math&gt;

one finds&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greiner|2000|pp=107&amp;ndash;109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Psi_{\mathbf p\lambda} = N\left(\begin{matrix}U\\ \frac{(c\hat \boldsymbol \sigma \cdot \boldsymbol p)}{mc^2 + \lambda E_p}U\end{matrix}\right)\frac{\exp[i(\mathbf p \cdot \mathbf x - \varepsilon t)/\hbar]}{\sqrt{2\pi\hbar}^3},&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon = \pm E_p, \quad E_p = +c\sqrt{\mathbf p^2 + m^2 c^2}, \quad \lambda = \sgn \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;

for plane wave solutions with {{math|3}}-momentum {{math|'''p'''}}. This is a direct consequence of the relativistic [[energy-momentum relation]]

:&lt;math&gt;E^2=p^2c^2+m^2c^4&lt;/math&gt;

upon which the Dirac equation is built. The quantity {{mvar|U}} is a constant {{math|2 × 1}} column vector and {{mvar|N}} is a normalization constant. The quantity {{math|''ε''}} is called the ''time evolution factor'', and its interpretation in similar roles in, for example, the [[plane wave]] solutions of the [[Schrödinger equation]], is the energy of the wave (particle). This interpretation is not immediately available here since it may acquire negative values. A similar situation prevails for the [[Klein&amp;ndash;Gordon equation]]. In that case, the ''absolute value'' of {{math|''ε''}} can be interpreted as the energy of the wave since in the canonical formalism, waves with negative {{math|''ε''}} actually have ''positive'' energy {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greiner|2000|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; But this is not the case with the Dirac equation. The energy in the canonical formalism associated with negative {{math|''ε''}} is {{math|–''E''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greiner|2000|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In hole theory, the solutions with negative time evolution factors are reinterpreted as representing the [[positron]], discovered by [[Carl David Anderson|Carl Anderson]]. The interpretation of this result requires a Dirac sea, showing that the Dirac equation is not merely a combination of [[special relativity]] and [[quantum mechanics]], but it also implies that the number of particles cannot be conserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alvarez-Gaume|Vazquez-Mozo|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==

The origins of the Dirac sea lie in the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|energy spectrum]] of the [[Dirac equation]], an extension of the [[Schrödinger equation]] that is consistent with [[special relativity]], that Dirac had formulated in 1928. Although the equation was extremely successful in describing electron dynamics, it possesses a rather peculiar feature: for each quantum state possessing a positive energy ''E'', there is a corresponding state with energy ''-E''. This is not a big difficulty when an isolated electron is considered, because its energy is [[conservation of energy|conserved]] and negative-energy electrons may be left out. However, difficulties arise when effects of the [[electromagnetic field]] are considered, because a positive-energy electron would be able to shed energy by continuously emitting [[photon]]s, a process that could continue without limit as the electron descends into lower and lower energy states. Real electrons clearly do not behave in this way.

Dirac's solution to this was to turn to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]. Electrons are [[fermion]]s, and obey the exclusion principle, which means that no two electrons can share a single energy state within an atom. Dirac hypothesized that what we think of as the "vacuum" is actually the state in which ''all'' the negative-energy states are filled, and none of the positive-energy states. Therefore, if we want to introduce a single electron we would have to put it in a positive-energy state, as all the negative-energy states are occupied. Furthermore, even if the electron loses energy by emitting photons it would be forbidden from dropping below zero energy.

Dirac also pointed out that a situation might exist in which all the negative-energy states are occupied except one. This "hole" in the sea of negative-energy electrons would respond to [[electric field]]s as though it were a positively charged particle. Initially, Dirac identified this hole as a [[proton]]. However, [[Robert Oppenheimer]] pointed out that an electron and its hole would be able to [[annihilation|annihilate]] each other, releasing energy on the order of the electron's rest energy in the form of energetic photons; if holes were protons, stable [[atom]]s would not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dirac|1931}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hermann Weyl]] also noted that a hole should act as though it has the same [[mass]] as an electron, whereas the proton is about two thousand times heavier. The issue was finally resolved in 1932 when the [[positron]] was discovered by [[Carl David Anderson|Carl Anderson]], with all the physical properties predicted for the Dirac hole.

== Inelegance of Dirac sea ==

Despite its success, the idea of the Dirac sea tends not to strike people as very elegant. The existence of the sea implies an infinite positive electric charge filling all of space. In order to make any sense out of this, one must assume that the "bare vacuum" must have an infinite negative charge density which is exactly cancelled by the Dirac sea. Since the absolute energy density is unobservable—the [[cosmological constant]] aside—the infinite energy density of the vacuum does not represent a problem. Only changes in the energy density are observable.  Geoffrey Landis (author of ''Ripples In The Dirac Sea'', a hard science fiction short story) also notes{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} that Pauli exclusion does not definitively mean that a filled Dirac sea cannot accept more electrons, since, as [[Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel|Hilbert]] elucidated, a sea of infinite extent can accept new particles even if it is filled. This happens when we have a [[chiral anomaly]] and a gauge [[instanton]].

The development of [[quantum field theory]] (QFT) in the 1930s made it possible to reformulate the Dirac equation in a way that treats the positron as a "real" particle rather than the absence of a particle, and makes the vacuum the state in which no particles exist instead of an infinite sea of particles. This picture is much more convincing, especially since it recaptures all the valid predictions of the Dirac sea, such as electron-positron annihilation. On the other hand, the field formulation does not eliminate all the difficulties raised by the Dirac sea; in particular the problem of the [[vacuum energy|vacuum possessing infinite energy]].

== Modern interpretation ==

The Dirac sea interpretation and the modern QFT interpretation are related by what may be thought of as a very simple [[Bogoliubov transformation]], an identification between the creation and annihilation operators of two different free field theories.{{citation needed|date=December 2017|reason=phrasing suggestive of original research}} In the modern interpretation, the field operator for a Dirac  spinor is a sum of creation operators and annihilation operators, in a schematic notation:

::&lt;math&gt; \psi(x) = \sum a^\dagger(k) e^{ikx} + a(k)e^{-ikx} &lt;/math&gt;

An operator with negative frequency lowers the energy of any state by an amount proportional to the frequency, while operators with positive frequency raise the energy of any state.

In the modern interpretation, the positive frequency operators add a positive energy particle, adding to the energy, while the negative frequency operators annihilate a positive energy particle, and lower the energy. For a [[Fermionic field]], the [[Creation and annihilation operators|creation operator]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle a^\dagger (k)&lt;/math&gt; gives zero when the state with momentum k is already filled, while the annihilation operator &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle a(k)&lt;/math&gt; gives zero when the state with momentum k is empty.

But then it is possible to reinterpret the annihilation operator as a ''creation'' operator for a [[negative energy]] particle. It still lowers the energy of the vacuum, but in this point of view it does so by creating a negative energy object. This reinterpretation only affects the philosophy. To reproduce the rules for when annihilation in the vacuum gives zero, the notion of "empty" and "filled" must be reversed for the negative energy states. Instead of being states with no antiparticle, these are states that are already filled with a negative energy particle.

The price is that there is a nonuniformity in certain expressions, because replacing annihilation with creation adds a constant to the negative energy particle number. The [[number operator]] for a Fermi field&lt;ref name="Sattler"&gt;{{harvnb|Sattler|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is:

::&lt;math&gt; N = a^\dagger a = 1 - a a^\dagger &lt;/math&gt;

which means that if one replaces N by 1-N for [[negative energy]] states, there is a constant shift in quantities like the energy and the charge density, quantities that count the total number of particles. The infinite constant gives the Dirac sea an infinite energy and charge density. The vacuum charge density should be zero, since the vacuum is [[Lorentz invariance|Lorentz invariant]], but this is artificial to arrange in Dirac's picture. The way it is done is by passing to the modern interpretation.

Dirac's idea is more directly applicable to [[solid state physics]], where the [[valence band]] in a [[solid]] can be regarded as a "sea" of electrons. Holes in this sea indeed occur, and are extremely important for understanding the effects of [[semiconductor]]s, though they are never referred to as "positrons". Unlike in particle physics, there is an underlying positive charge&amp;nbsp;— the charge of the [[Crystal structure|ionic lattice]]&amp;nbsp;— that cancels out the electric charge of the sea.

== Revival in the theory of causal fermion systems ==
Dirac's original concept of a sea of particles was revived in the theory of [[causal fermion system]]s, a recent proposal for a unified physical theory. In this approach, the problems of the infinite [[vacuum energy]] and infinite charge density of the Dirac sea disappear because these divergences drop out of the physical equations formulated via the [[causal action principle]].&lt;ref name="srev"&gt;{{harvnb|Finster|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These equations do not require a preexisting space-time, making it possible to realize the concept that space-time and all structures therein arise as a result of the collective interaction of the sea states with each other and with the additional particles and "holes" in the sea.

A '''distribution board''' (also known as '''panelboard''', '''breaker panel''', or '''electric panel''') is a component of an [[Electrical service|electricity supply system]] that divides an electrical power feed into subsidiary [[Circuit (electricity)|circuits]], while providing a protective [[Fuse (electrical)|fuse]] or [[circuit breaker]] for each circuit in a common [[Enclosure (electrical)|enclosure]]. Normally, a main [[switch]], and in recent boards, one or more [[residual-current device]]s (RCD) or [[Circuit breaker#Other breakers|residual current breakers with overcurrent protection]] (RCBO), are also incorporated.

In the United Kingdom, a distribution board designed for domestic installations is known as a consumer unit.&lt;ref&gt;BS 7671 17th edition definitions&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==North America==
[[File:ElectricalPanel.jpg|thumb|An American circuit breaker panel featuring ''interchangeable'' circuit breakers]]

North American distribution boards are typically housed in [[sheet metal]] enclosures, with the [[circuit breaker]]s positioned in two columns operable from the front. Some panelboards are provided with a door covering the breaker switch handles, but all are constructed with a ''dead front''; that is to say the front of the enclosure (whether it has a door or not) prevents the operator of the circuit breakers from contacting live electrical parts within. [[Busbars]] carry the current from incoming line (''hot'') conductors to the breakers, which are secured to the bus with either a ''bolt-on'' connection (using a threaded screw) or a ''plug-in'' connection using a retaining clip. ''Panelboards'' are more common in commercial and industrial applications and employ bolt-on breakers. Residential and light commercial panels are generally referred to as ''load centers'' and employ plug-in breakers. The neutral conductors are secured to a neutral bus using [[screw terminal]]s. The branch circuit [[electrical bonding|bonding]] conductors are secured to a terminal block attached directly to the panelboard enclosure, which is itself [[ground (electricity)|grounded]].

During servicing of the distribution board, when the cover has been removed and the cables are visible, American panelboards commonly have some live parts exposed. In Canadian service entrance panelboards the main switch or circuit breaker is located in a ''service box'', a section of the enclosure separated from the rest of the panelboard, so that when the main switch or breaker is switched off no live parts are exposed when servicing the branch circuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date=2015 |title=C22.2 No. 29-15 — "Panelboards and enclosed panelboards" |publisher=Canadian Standards Association |isbn=978-1-77139-712-4 |page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Breaker arrangement===
[[File:OpenClosedPanelboardEEUU(GE)CloseupTop.jpg|thumb|Illustration of breaker numbering in a North American type panelboard. Some labels are missing, and some are additional. The numbers on the [[toggle switch|toggles]] indicate the rated [[ampere]]age before tripping. The top right breaker (Rated at 100&amp;nbsp;A) feeds a sub panel.]]

Breakers are usually arranged in two columns. In a U.S.-style board, breaker positions are numbered left-to-right, along each row from top to bottom. This numbering system is universal with numerous competitive manufacturers of breaker panels.

Each row is fed from a different phase (''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' below), to allow 2- or 3-pole common-trip breakers to have one pole on each phase. In North America, it is common to wire large permanently installed equipment line-to-line. This takes two slots in the panel (two-pole) and gives a voltage of 240&amp;nbsp;V for [[split-phase electric power]], or 208&amp;nbsp;V for [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase power]].

====Interior====
[[File:Electrical panel and subpanel with cover removed from subpanel.jpg|thumb|left|Electrical panel and subpanel with cover removed from subpanel]]
[[File:EEUU(GE)BreakerpanelInnards.jpg|thumb]]
The photograph to the right shows the interior of a residential service panelboard manufactured by [[General Electric]]. The three service conductors—two 'hot' lines and one neutral—can be seen coming in at the top. The neutral wire is connected to the neutral [[busbar]] to the left with all the white wires, and the two hot wires are attached to the main breaker. Below it are the two bus bars carrying the current between the main breaker and the two columns of branch circuit breakers, with each respective circuit's red and black hot wires leading off. Three wires (hot black, neutral white, and bare ground) can be seen exiting the left side of the enclosure running directly to a [[NEMA connector#NEMA 5|NEMA 5-15]] [[electrical receptacle]] with a [[power cord]] plugged into it. The incoming bare, stranded ground wire can be seen near the bottom of the neutral bus bar.

The photograph on the left shows a dual panel configuration: a main panel on the right (with front cover in place) and a subpanel on the left (with cover removed). The subpanel is fed by two large hot wires and a neutral wire running through the angled conduit near the top of the panels. This configuration appears to display three violations of the current U.S. National Electric Code: the main panel does not have a grounding conductor (here it is fed through the subpanel instead), the connection between the main and subpanel lacks a grounding conductor (it must have four wires instead of three), and the subpanel neutral bar is bonded to the ground bar (these should be separate bars after the first service disconnect, which in this case is the main panel).

===Fuse boxes===
[[File:Murray-fuse-box.jpg|left|thumb|An older style fuse box of the variety used in the United States]]

A common design of fuse box that was featured in homes built from 1940 to 1965 was the 60-amp fuse box that featured four plug fuses (i.e. Edison base) for branch circuits and one or more fuse blocks containing cartridge fuses for purposes such as major appliance circuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QtVhK6z7mpQC&amp;lpg=PA75&amp;dq=&amp;pg=PA75#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title=Black &amp; Decker The Complete Guide to Wiring |edition=4th |year=2008 |author=The editors of Creative Publishing |publisher=[[Cool Springs Press]] |page=75 |isbn=1589234138 |accessdate=2014-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 1965, the more substantial 100 A panel with three-wire (230 V) service became common; a fuse box could have fuse blocks for the main shut-off and an electric range circuit plus a number of plug fuses (Edison base or Type S) for individual circuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Popular Science |date=January 1966 |publisher=[[Bonnier Corporation]] |page=160 |title=Improving Your Home Wiring |first=Daniels |last=George |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mikDAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA160&amp;dq=&amp;pg=PA160#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=2014-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
[[File:UKDistributionBoard.JPG|thumb|right|One type of UK distribution board.]]
This picture shows the interior of a typical distribution panel in the United Kingdom. The three incoming phase wires connect to the busbars via a main switch in the centre of the panel.  On each side of the panel are two [[busbar]]s, for neutral and earth.  The incoming neutral connects to the lower busbar on the right side of the panel, which is in turn connected to the neutral busbar at the top left. The incoming earth wire connects to the lower busbar on the left side of the panel, which is in turn connected to the earth busbar at the top right.  The cover has been removed from the lower-right neutral bar; the neutral bar on the left side has its cover in place.

Down the left side of the phase busbars are two two-pole [[Residual-current device|RCBO]]s and two single-pole breakers, one unused. The two-pole RCBOs in the picture are not connected across two phases, but have supply-side neutral connections exiting behind the phase busbars. Down the right side of the busbars are a single-pole breaker, a two-pole RCBO and a three-pole breaker.

The illustrated panel includes a great deal of unused space; it is likely that the manufacturer produces 18- and 24-position versions of this panel using the same chassis.

Larger commercial, public, and industrial installations generally use three-phase supplies, with distribution boards which have twin vertical rows of breakers.  Larger installations will often use subsidiary distribution boards.

In both cases, modern boards handling supplies up to around 100&amp;nbsp;A (CUs) or 200&amp;nbsp;A (distribution boards)  use circuit breakers  and RCDs on [[DIN rail]] mountings.  The main distribution board in an installation will also normally provide a main switch (known as an ''incomer'') which switches the phase and neutral lines for the whole supply.  (n.b., an incomer may be referred to, or sold as, an ''[[Isolator switch|isolator]]'', but this is problematic, as it will not necessarily be used as an isolator in the strict sense.)

For each phase, power is fed along a [[busbar]]. In split-phase panels, separate busbars are fed directly from the incomer, which allows RCDs to be used to protect groups of circuits.  Alternatively RCBOs may be used to provide both overcurrent and residual-current protection to single circuits.

Other devices, such as [[transformer]]s (e.g. for bell circuits) and [[contactors]] (relays; e.g. for large motor or heating loads) may also be used.

New British distribution boards generally have the live parts enclosed to [[IP Code|IP2X]], even when the cover has been removed for servicing.

===Consumer units===
{{main|consumer unit}}
In the [[United Kingdom]], [[BS 7671]] defines a [[Consumer unit]] as " A particular type of distribution board comprising a type tested coordinated assembly for the control and distribution of electrical energy, principally in domestic premises..."&lt;ref&gt;BS7671 17th Edition&lt;/ref&gt; These installations usually have single-phase supplies at 230 V (nominal standard) and historically they were known as [[Fuse (electrical)#Fuse boxes|fuse boxes]] as older consumer units used [[Fuse (electrical)|fuses]] until the advent of [[circuit breaker|mini-circuit breakers]] (MCBs).
A normal new domestic CU used as a main panel might have from 6 to 24 ways for devices (some of which might occupy two ways), and will be split into two or more sections (e.g. a non-RCD section for alarms etc., an RCD-protected section for socket outlets, and an RCD-protected section for lighting and other built-in appliances).  Secondary CUs used for outbuildings usually have 1 to 4 ways plus an RCD.

Recent (pre-17th edition wiring regulations) CUs would not normally have RCD protected sections for anything other than socket outlets, though some older CUs featured RCD Incomers. Before 1990, RCDs (and split busbars) were not standard in CUs.

&lt;gallery caption="Old rewirable-fuse boxes" widths="100px" align="centre"&gt;
File:Mem_1957_cu_closed.jpg|1950s MEM rewirable fuse box (covered)
File:MEM_1957_cu_open.jpg|1950s MEM rewirable fuse box (open)
File:Mem_1977_cu_closed.jpg|1970s MEM rewirable fuse box (covered)
File:Mem_1977_cu_open.jpg|1970s MEM rewirable fuse box (open)
&lt;/gallery&gt;
Fuse Boxes normally use cartridge or rewirable fuses with no other protective device, and basic  4-ways boxes are very common. Some older boxes are made of brown-black bakelite, sometimes with a wooden base. Although their design is historic, these were standard equipment for new installs as recently as the 1980s, so they are very common. Fuseholders in these boxes may not provide protection from accidental contact with live terminals.

The popular 4-way fusebox normally had two lighting and two socket circuits, with heavy or sustained loads such as immersion heater and oven on a socket circuit. This arrangement is not recommended practice today, but it is common for existing installations. Larger boxes with more ways will have separate fuses for large loads such as immersion heater, oven and shower.

===Legacy fuseboxes===
A small number of pre-1950 fuseboxes are still in service. These should be treated with caution because exposed live parts are common on these boxes. The installations they supply will not meet modern standards for [[Earthing system#Safety|electrical safety]]. Another characteristic of very old installations is that there may be two fuses for each circuit; one on the [[Live wire (electricity)|live]] and one on the [[Neutral wire|neutral]]. In rare instances, old ring circuits may be encountered with no fewer than 4 15&amp;nbsp;A fuses per ring, one on each of L and N, and this duplicated for each of the two feeds for the ring.

==Manufacturer differences==
Most of the time, the panels and the breakers inserted inside them must be by the same manufacturer. Each manufacturer has one or more "systems", or kinds of breaker panels, that will only accept breakers of that type. In Europe, this is still the case, despite the adoption of a standard [[DIN rail]] for mounting and a standard cut-out shape, as the positions of the busbar connections are not standardized.

Certain panels use seemingly interchangeable {{convert|1|in|mm|adj=mid|-wide}} breakers. However, a given manufacturer will specifically mention exactly which devices may be installed in their equipment. These assemblies have been tested and approved for use by a recognized authority. Replacing or adding equipment which "just happens to fit" can result in unexpected or even dangerous conditions. Such installations should not be done without first consulting knowledgeable sources, including manufacturers.

==Location and designation==
[[File:220v service panel.jpg|thumb|A three-phase [[service drop]] enters through the side of this main service panel consisting of three 100 [[ampere]] [[Fuse (electrical)|fuses]].]]

For reasons of [[aesthetics]] and security, domestic circuit breaker panels and consumer units are normally located in out-of-the-way [[closet]]s, [[attic]]s, [[Garage (house)|garages]], or [[basement]]s, but sometimes they are also featured as part of the aesthetic elements of a building (as an art installation, for example) or where they can be easily accessible. However, current U.S. building codes prohibit installation of a panel in a bathroom (or similar room), in closets intended for clothing, or where there is insufficient space for an electrician to gain access to the panel. Specific situations, such as an installation outdoors, in a hazardous environment, or in other out-of-the-ordinary locations might require specialized equipment and more stringent installation practices.

Distribution boards may be designated for three phase or single phase and normal power or emergency power, or designated by use such as  distribution panels for supplying other panels, lighting panels for lights, power panels for equipment and receptacles and special uses. Panels are located throughout the building in electric closets serving a section of the building.

==Theatre lighting==
In a theatre, a specialty panel known as a ''[[dimmer]] rack'' is used to feed stage lighting instruments. A U.S. style dimmer rack has a 208Y/120 volt 3-phase feed. Instead of just circuit breakers, the rack has a solid state electronic dimmer with its own circuit breaker for each stage circuit. This is known as a ''dimmer-per-circuit'' arrangement. The dimmers are equally divided across the three incoming phases. In a 96 dimmer rack, there are 32 dimmers on phase A, 32 dimmers on phase B, and 32 on phase C to spread out the lighting load as equally as possible. In addition to the power feed from the supply transformer in the building, a control cable from the [[lighting desk]] carries information to the dimmers in a control protocol such as [[DMX-512]]. The information includes lighting level information for each channel, by which it controls which dimmer circuits come up and go out during the lighting changes of the show (light cues), and over what fade time.

Distribution boards may be surface-mounted or flush. The former arrangement provides easier alteration or addition to wiring at a later date, but the latter arrangement might be neater, particularly for a residential application. The other problem with recessing a distribution board into a wall is that if the wall is solid, a lot of brick or block might need to be removed—generally for this reason, recessed boards would only be installed on new-build projects when the required space can be built into the wall.

==Mobile operation==
[[File:Breakerpanel-mechroom136rp.jpg|thumb|upright|A panelboard mounted for temporary construction use]]
Sometimes it is desired to have a portable breaker panel, for example, for special events. In this case, a breaker panel is mounted to a board, together with various sockets. The American one pictured at the right has a cord with an [[NEMA connector#NEMA L21|L21-30]] plug to supply power. Power leaves the board through four three-phase circuits: three 15 [[ampere]] circuits; and one 20&amp;nbsp;A circuit. The 15&amp;nbsp;A circuits each go to a [[Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets#Duplexing and triplexing|triplex box]]. The 20&amp;nbsp;A circuit goes to an L21-20 receptacle, and one leg of it goes to a 20&amp;nbsp;A duplex receptacle shown at the upper left. The neon night-lights on the upper right triplex box are to show the phase presence.

The use of a load center in this type of configuration is dangerous and violates UL and NEC rules for their use. When power distribution is required on movie sets, concert stages and theatrical venues it should be provided via products listed "for portable power distribution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ulstandardsinfonet.ul.com/scopes/scopes.asp?fn=1640.html | title=UL 1640 | website=ULStandardsInfoNet.UL.com | publisher=[[UL (safety organization)|UL]] | accessdate=16 June 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421183610/http://ulstandardsinfonet.ul.com/scopes/scopes.asp?fn=1640.html | archivedate=21 April 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Energy-Quest''' (formerly ''The Hydrogen Expedition'') was an [[organization]] that sought to educate the public about the risks of an impending [[energy crisis]] due to the current worldwide dependence on [[fossil fuels]] and the benefits of [[energy conservation]] and the use of [[Renewable energy|renewable energy sources]]. It intended to do so through a series of three [[World record|record]]-setting ocean voyages:

# The [[Earthrace]]
# The Aurora Expedition
# The Triton Expedition

Started and staffed by [[university]] [[student]]s, the project was endorsed by several organizations and prominent individuals.

==The Earthrace==
The Earthrace will be an attempt to break the speed record for [[circumnavigation|circumnavigating]] the globe in a [[powerboat]] while using only renewable fuels. It is being supported by over 100 [[companies]], and is led by [[New Zealand]]er Pete Bethune. Energy-Quest is providing organizational and [[fundraising]] assistance to the Earthrace in the [[United States]].

==The Aurora Expedition==
The Aurora Expedition will involve an around-the-world voyage in a powerboat which, at 20&amp;nbsp;ft, will be the smallest vessel of its kind to ever complete such a journey. Due to its limited fuel capacity, the ''Aurora'' will rely on advanced [[fuel efficiency|fuel-efficient]] technologies for propulsion. Energy-Quest thus seeks to incorporate highly clean and efficient [[diesel engine]]s, [[solar cell]]s, and [[wind turbine]]s into this design.

''Aurora'' will stop at over forty major ports around the world, where she will showcase the cleanest and most efficient energy technologies available at the time, and her crew will promote the widespread use of such technologies. Ultimately, the Aurora Expedition is intended as a stepping stone towards the completion of the organization's final and most important endeavor &amp;ndash; the Triton Expedition.

==The Triton Expedition==
The Triton Expedition will be the first circumnavigation of the world by a boat powered solely by a [[hydrogen]] [[fuel cell]]. ''Triton'' will stop at major destinations around the world, where her crew will meet with local political and industrial leaders to promote the importance of [[alternative energy]] development. Through ''Triton'''s voyage, Energy-Quest hopes to generate international [[Mass media|media]] attention, and in this way stimulate the development of a renewable energy-based [[hydrogen economy]].

==History==
The project was started in the summer of 2005 by Joseph F. Sahid, a graduate of the [[Phillips Exeter Academy]] and currently a sophomore at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. He soon was joined by other volunteers, and an official team was rapidly assembled. The Energy Quest program has now been discontinued.

An '''energy service company''' ('''ESCO''') is a commercial or non-profit business providing a broad range of energy solutions including designs and implementation of [[energy savings]] projects, [[retrofitting]], [[energy conservation]], energy infrastructure outsourcing, [[power generation]] and [[energy supply]], and risk management.

A newer breed of ESCO evolving in the UK now focuses more on innovative [[financing]] methods.  These include off-balance sheet vehicles which own a range of applicable equipment configured in such a way as to reduce the energy cost of a building.  The building occupants, or landlord, then benefit from the energy savings and pay a fee to the ESCO SPV in return.  At all times, the saving is guaranteed to exceed the fee. The ESCO starts by performing an  analysis of the property, designs an energy efficient solution, installs the required elements, and maintains the system to ensure energy savings during the [[payback period]].&lt;ref name="NAESCO"&gt;"What is an ESCO?" National Association of Energy Service Provides (NAESCO). 15 Jan. 2017 &lt;http://www.naesco.org/what-is-an-esco&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  The savings in energy costs are often used to pay back the capital investment of the project over a five- to twenty-year period, or reinvested into the building to allow for capital upgrades that may otherwise be unfeasible. If the project does not provide returns on the investment, the ESCO is often responsible to pay the difference.&lt;ref name="ESC"&gt;
 "What is Energy Performance Contracting?" Energy Services Coalition. 6 Dec. 2004. 10 Mar. 2008 &lt;http://www.energyservicescoalition.org/resources/whatis.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===The beginning===
The start of the energy services business can be attributed to the [[energy crisis]] of the late 1970s, as entrepreneurs developed ways to combat the rise in energy costs.  One of the earliest examples was a company in Texas, Time Energy, which introduced a device to automate the switching of lights and other equipment to regulate energy use. The primary reason that the product did not initially sell was because potential users doubted that the savings would actually materialize.  To combat this doubt, the company decided to install the device upfront and ask for a percentage of the savings that was accumulated.  The result was the basis for the ESCO model.  Through this process, the company achieved higher sales and more return since the savings were large.&lt;ref name="Bullock"/&gt;

===Industry growth through the 1970s and 1980s===
As more entrepreneurs saw this market grow, more companies came into creation.  The first wave of ESCOs were often small divisions of large energy companies or small, upstart, independent companies.  However, after the energy crisis came to an end, the companies had little leverage on potential clients to perform energy-saving projects, given the lower cost of energy.  This prevented the growth experienced in the late 1970s from continuing.  The industry grew slowly through the 1970s and 1980s,&lt;ref name="Bullock"&gt;Bullock, Cary, and George Caraghaiur. Guide to Energy Services Companies. The Fairmont P, Inc., 2001. 10 Mar. 2008 &lt;https://books.google.com/books?id=8_x3jTzUMpwC&amp;printsec=titlepage&amp;dq=esco&amp;source=gbs_toc_s&amp;cad=1#PPA83,M1&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; spurred by specialist firms such as Hospital Efficiency Corporation (HEC Inc.), established in 1982 to focus on the energy intensive medical sector. HEC Inc., later renamed Select Energy Services, was acquired in 1990 by Northeast Utilities, and sold in 2006 to Ameresco.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nuwnotes1.nu.com/apps/corporatecommunications/empinfo.nsf/1655e8f1972fb0848525668000587994/15e389132ab7a1c285257203006f7893?OpenDocument 2006 Ameresco, Inc. and Northeast Utilities announced that Ameresco has purchased Select Energy Services, Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The 1990s: Utilities and consolidated energy companies become the major players===
With the rising cost of energy and the availability of efficiency technologies in [[lighting]], [[HVAC]] (heating, ventilation and air conditioning), and [[Building Management System|building energy management]], ESCO projects became much more commonplace.  The term ESCO has also become more widely known among potential clients looking to upgrade their building systems that are either outdated and need to be replaced, or for campus and district energy plant upgrades.

With [[deregulation]] in the U.S. energy markets in the 1990s, the energy services business experienced a rapid rise. Utilities, which for decades enjoyed the shelter of monopolies with guaranteed returns on power plant investments, now had to compete to supply power to many of their largest customers. They now looked to energy services as a potential new business line to retain their existing large customers. Also, with the new opportunities on the supply side, many energy services companies (ESCOs) started to expand into the generation market, building district power plants or including cogeneration facilities within efficiency projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenbiz.com/feature/2008/04/14/escos-and-utilities-shaping-future-energy-efficiency-business?page=0%2C0 GreenBiz: ESCOs and Utilities: Shaping the Future of the Energy Efficiency Business]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in November 1996 [[BGA, Inc.]], formerly a privately held, regional energy performance contracting and consulting company was acquired by [[TECO Energy]], and in 2004 was acquired by [[Chevron Corporation]]. In 1998, BGA entered the District Energy Plant business, completing construction on the first 3rd-party owned and operated district cooling plant in Florida.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bgainc.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=31&amp;Itemid=52 BGA Inc. history]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decade of the 2000s: Consolidation, exit of many utilities===
In the wake of the [[Enron]] collapse in 2001, and the sputtering or reverse of [[deregulation]] efforts, many utilities shut down or sold their energy services businesses. There was a significant consolidation among the remaining independent firms. According to the industry group [[NAESCO]], revenues of ESCOs in the U.S. grew by 22% in 2006, reaching $3.6 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naesco.org/resources/industry/documents/2007-05.pdf Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the National Association of Energy Service Companies (NAESCO), "A Survey of the U.S. ESCO Industry Market Growth and Development from 2000 to 2006"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==ESCO operating principles==
[[File:ESCO project.jpg|thumb|300px|The phases of a typical ESCO project&lt;ref name="Motiva1"&gt;Kilpeläinen, H. et al.: ESCO-toiminnnan yleisperiaatteet ja MotivaESCO-konsepti. [http://www.motiva.fi/en Motiva], 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

=== Introduction ===
An energy service company (ESCO) is a company that provides comprehensive energy solutions to its customers, including auditing, redesigning and implementing changes to the ways the customer consumes energy, the main goal being improved efficiency. Other possible services provided include energy infrastructure outsourcing, energy supply, financing and risk management. It is this comprehensiveness of services that differentiates an ESCO from a common energy company, whose main business is solely providing energy to its customers. Typically compensation to the ESCO is performance based so that the benefits of improved energy efficiency are shared between the client and the ESCO.

ESCOs often use performance contracting, meaning that if the project does not provide returns on the investment, the ESCO is responsible to pay the difference, thus assuring their clients of the energy and cost savings. Therefore, ESCOs are fundamentally different from consulting engineers and equipment contractors: the former are typically paid for their advice, whereas the latter are paid for the equipment, and neither accept any project risk. The risk-free nature of the service the ESCOs provide offers a convincing incentive for their clients to invest.&lt;ref name="Motiva1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hosier"&gt;Hosier, R.: Energy Service Industry. Encyclopedia of Energy, Elsevier, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some typical characteristic of ESCOs are as follows:&lt;ref name="Hosier"/&gt;
* '''Ownership''' – ESCOs may be privately owned companies, either independent or part of a large conglomerate, state-owned, nonprofits, joint ventures, manufacturers or manufacturers' subsidiaries.
* '''Clients''' – ESCOs typically specialize on market niches by sector (industries, utilities, real estate, etc.) and by size (large or small projects). 
* '''Technology''' – Some ESCOs have a technological specialization (e.g. lighting, HVAC, a particular industrial process) whereas others are aim for a holistic approach.
* '''Project financing''' – Financing capabilities vary with the financial situation of the ESCO. Some have large parent companies, which allows them to self-finance projects. However, all ESCOs rely to some extent on third-party financing.

===Developing a project===
The energy savings project often begins with the development of ideas that would generate energy savings, and in turn, cost savings.  This task is usually the responsibility of the ESCO.  The ESCO often approaches a potential client with a proposal of an energy savings project and a [[performance contract]].  This ESCO is said to “drive” the project.  Once the owner is aware of the possibility of an energy savings project, he or she may choose to place it out for bid, or just stick with the original ESCO.  During the initial period of research and investigation, an energy auditor from the ESCO surveys the site and reviews the project's systems to determine areas where cost savings are feasible, usually free of charge to the client.  This is the [[energy audit]], and the phase is often referred to as the [[feasibility study]].  A hypothesis of the potential project is developed by the client and the auditor, and then the ESCO’s engineering development team expands upon and compiles solutions.

This next phase is referred to as the engineering and design phase, which further defines the project and can provide more firm cost and savings estimates.  The engineers are responsible for creating cost-effective measures to obtain the highest potential of energy savings.&lt;ref name="Bullock"/&gt;  These measures can range from highly efficient lighting and heating/air conditioning upgrades, to more productive motors with [[variable speed drives]] and centralized [[energy management systems]].&lt;ref name="NAESCO"/&gt;  There is a wide array of measures that can produce large energy savings.

Once the project has been developed and a performance contract signed, the construction or implementation phase begins.  Following the completion of this phase, the monitoring and maintenance or [[Measurement and Verification]] (M &amp; V) phase begins.  This phase is the verification of the pre-construction calculations and is used to determine the actual cost savings.  This phase is not always included in the performance contract.  In fact, there are three options the owner must consider during the performance contract review.&lt;ref name="NAESCO"/&gt; These options are, from least to most expensive:
*No warranty other than that provided on the equipment.
*ESCO provided M &amp; V to show the projected energy savings during the short term following completion.
*ESCO provided M &amp; V to show the projected energy savings during the entire payback period.

A typical transaction involves the ESCO borrowing cash to purchase equipment or to implement energy-savings for its clients.  The client pays the ESCO its regular energy cost (or a large fraction of it), but the energy savings enable the ESCO to pay only a fraction of that to their energy supplier.  The difference goes to pay the interest on the loan and to profit.  Typically, ESCs are able to implement and finance the efficiency improvements better than their client company could by itself.

===Choosing an ESCO===
Once the project has been defined, but before much of the engineering work has been completed, it may be necessary to choose an ESCO by putting the project “out to bid”.  This is usually the case when the client has developed the project on his or her own or is required to allow others to bid on the work as required by the government.  The latter is the case on any state or federally funded project.  The typical process includes a [[Request for qualifications]] (RFQ) in which the interested ESCO’s submit their corporate resumes, business profiles, experience, and initial plan.  Once received, the client creates a “short list” of 3-5 companies.  This list is of the companies whose profile for the project best matches with the owners’ ideas in the RFQ.  The client then asks for a [[Request for Proposal]] (RFP) that is a much more detailed explanation of the project.  This document contains all cost savings measures, products, M &amp; V plans, and the performance contract.  The client often allows a minimum of six weeks to compile the information before having it submitted.  Once submitted, the Proposals are then reviewed by the client, who may conduct interviews with the applicants. The client then selects the ESCO that presents the best possible solution to the energy project, as determined by the client.  A good ESCO will help the owner put all the pieces together from start to finish.  According to the [[Energy Services Coalition]],

“A qualified ESCO can help you put the pieces together:
*Identify and evaluate energy-saving opportunities;
*Develop engineering designs and specifications;
*Manage the project from design to installation to monitoring;
*Arrange for financing;
*Train your staff and provide ongoing maintenance services; and
*Guarantee that savings will cover all project costs.”&lt;ref name="ESC"/&gt;

===Energy savings tracking methods===
[[Image:Table 1 IPMVP Options.svg|thumb|440px|IPMVP Options Table: Determining Energy Savings]]After installing energy conservation measures (ECMs), ESCOs often determine the energy savings resulting from the project and present the savings results to their customers. A common way to calculate energy savings is to measure the flows of energy associated with the ECM, and then to apply spreadsheet calculations to determine savings. For example, a chiller retrofit would require measurements of chilled water supply and return temperatures and kW. The benefit of this approach is that the ECM is isolated, and that only energy flows associated with the ECM itself are considered.

This method is described as Option A or Option B in the International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy02osti/31505.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Table 1 presents the different options. Option A requires some measurement and allows for estimations of some parameters. Option B requires measurement of all parameters. In both options, calculations are done (typically in spreadsheets) to determine what energy savings. Option C uses utility bills to determine energy savings.

There are many situations where Option A or Option B (Metering and Calculating) is the best approach to measuring energy savings, however, some ESCOs insist upon only using Option A or Option B, when clearly Option C would be most appropriate. If the ESCO was a lighting contractor, then Option A should work in all cases. Spot measurements of fixtures before and after, agreed upon hours of operation, and simple calculations can be inserted into a spreadsheet that can calculate savings. The same spreadsheet can be used over and over. However, for ESCOs that offer a variety of different retrofits, it is necessary to be able to employ all options so that the best option can be selected for each individual job. Controls Retrofits, or retrofits to HVAC systems are typically excellent candidates for Option C.&lt;ref name="Utilty Bills"&gt;"Determining Eenergy Savings Using Utility Bills: A Winning Method for ESCOs" 3rd International Congress on Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Sources. 26 Apr. 2007 &lt;http://abraxasenergy.com/pdf/Determining-Energy-Savings-Using-Utility-Bills_A-Winning-Method-for-ESCOs.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

After installing the energy conservation measures (ECMs), the savings created from the project must be determined. This process, termed Measurement and Verification (M&amp;V), is frequently performed by the ESCO, but may also be performed by the customer or a third party. The International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) is the standard M&amp;V guideline for determining actual savings created by an energy management program. Because savings are the absence of energy use, they cannot be directly measured. IPMVP provides 4 methods for using measurement to reliably determine actual savings. A plan for applying the most appropriate of the 4 general methods to a specific project is typically created and agreed upon by all parties before implementation of the ECMs.

'''IPMVP Option A''' – Retrofit Isolation: Key Parameter Measurement
Savings are determined by field measurement of the key performance parameter(s) which define the energy use of the ECM’s affected system(s). Parameters not selected for field measurement are estimated.

'''IPMVP Option B''' – Retrofit Isolation: All Parameter Measurement
Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM-affected system.

'''IPMVP Option C''' – Whole Facility
Savings are determined by measuring energy use at the whole facility or sub-facility level.

'''IPMVP Option D''' – Calibrated Simulation
Savings are determined through simulation of the energy use of the facility, or of a sub-facility. The simulation model must be calibrated so that it predicts an energy pattern that approximately matches actual metered data.

Table 1 provides suggested IPMVP options for different project characteristics. For each project, an M&amp;V approach which balances the uncertainty in achieved savings and the cost of the M&amp;V plan should be selected. Some plans include only short term verification approaches and others include repeated measurements for an extended period. Because the expense of determining the amount of savings achieved erodes the benefit of the savings themselves, IPMVP suggests not spending more than 10% of the expected savings on M&amp;V. Often M&amp;V approaches are bundled with other monitoring, support, or maintenance services that help achieve or ensure the savings performance. These costs should not be considered M&amp;V expenses and depending on the project and services details, may greatly exceed 10% of the savings.

===Utilizing the savings===
[[Image:ESCO Savings Chart.JPG|frame|right|Graphical representation of energy savings.]] Once the project is completed the immediate results of energy savings (often between 15 and 35 percent), and the long term maintenance costs can be put towards the capital investment of upgrading the energy system.&lt;ref name="ESC"/&gt; This is often how ESCOs and performance contracts work.  The initial implementation is done, in a sense, free of charge, with the payment coming from the percentage of the energy savings collected by a financing company or the ESCO.  The client may also wish to use some capital investment money to lower that percentage during the payback period. The payback period can range from five to twenty years, depending on the negotiated contract.  Most state or federally funded projects have a max payback of 15 years.  Once the equipment and project have been paid for, the client may be entitled to the full amount of savings to use at their will.  It is also common to see large capital improvements financed through energy savings projects.  Upgrades to the mechanical/electrical system, new [[building envelope]] components, or even restorations and retrofits may be included in the contract even though they have no effect on the amount of energy savings.  By utilizing the energy savings, the client may be able to put the funds once used to pay for energy towards the capital improvement that would otherwise be unfeasible with the currently allotted funding.

==U. S. Federal Program: "Super-ESPC"==
Since its creation in the 1990s, a single U. S. government program known as "Super-ESPC" (ESPC stands for Energy Savings Performance Contracts) has been responsible for $2.9B in ESCO contracts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.eere.energy.gov/femp/financing/espcs.html U. S. Department of Energy Federal Energy Management Program]&lt;/ref&gt; The program was modified and reauthorized in December 2008, and sixteen firms were awarded [[IDIQ|Indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ)]] contracts for up to $5B each, for total potential energy-savings projects worth $80B.

Grouping the sixteen firms provides a convenient illustration of the industry structure and the ways that each firm generates value through projects that use the ESCO model of energy-savings performance contracts. Equipment-affiliated firms use performance contracting as a sales channel for their products. Utility-affiliated firms offer ESCO projects as a value-added service to attract and retain large customers and generally focus only on their utility footprint. Non-utility energy services companies are product neutral, tend to have a larger geographic footprint, and typically offer a wide range of services from energy retrofits to renewable energy development.

==ESCO 2.0==
In June 2005, the GAO released a report, “[http://www.gao.gov/cgi-bin/getrpt?GAO-05-340 Energy Savings: Performance Contracts Offer Benefits, But Vigilance Is Needed To Protect Government Interests.]” The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Technology, Acquisition, and Logistics agreed with the GAO findings. “While these complicated contracts are structured to ensure that savings will exceed costs,” the DOD noted, “we recognize that our measurement and verification procedures must be improved to confirm estimates with actual data.” Unverified savings, often stipulated rather than proven, do not put more oil in the ground, take CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; out of the air or reduce operating budgets

The GAO ESPC study brings into question whether or not there is sufficient data to prove that the gains delivered by ESCOs are sustainable over time. The study further questions the practice of having ESCOs monitoring and validating the performance of their own projects.

In fact, most buildings and facilities exhibit the same basic limitations with respect to energy conservation and optimum maintenance. US Federal studies show that major and minor building systems routinely fail to meet performance expectations, and these faults often go unnoticed over time. The functions of a building, the number of tenants, and the configuration of the space change over time in unanticipated manners that adversely affect the systems that control building performance.

Surprisingly, almost all buildings, building complexes, and systems inside buildings still operate in a disconnected, stand-alone manner. Proprietary systems result in buildings that needlesly waste energy.  Recent studies have found that roughly 30% of [http://www.newbuildings.org/downloads/Energy_Performance_of_LEED-NC_Buildings-Final_3-4-08b.pdf LEED certified buildings] perform substantially better than anticipated, while 25% perform substantially worse than anticipated.  In general, LEED certified buildings perform 25-30% better than non-LEED certified buildings with regards to energy use.  It is ultimately difficult or impossible for customers to construct a single integrated picture that correlates energy usage and maintenance costs to control system performance, space usage, conservation measures, and the behavior of those using the facility space.

A more recent phenomenon is the concept of combining the benefits of performance contracting with the benefits of green buildings, affectionately described as '''green performance contracting'''.  The reason the concept makes sense is because for green buildings, the costliest pre-requisites to meet are usually the energy efficiency requirements.  The LEED rating system requires buildings to be benchmarked using the EPA EnergyStar system.  The minimum score to meet the LEED prerequisites is a score of 75 or greater (meaning the building is in the top 75 percentile of benchmarked buildings).  Since performance contracting attempts to find all the sources of energy waste, then a building that has gone through the performance contracting process should meet the LEED prerequisite.

Green performance contracting can be used to achieve sustainability goals in new building design and construction as well as in existing buildings.
'''New Buildings:''' Higher-efficiency choices are compared to the modeled performance of the as-designed less-efficient building. Applying performance contracting to buildings being designed and built is the perfect cure for pressure to “value engineer” the efficiency and sustainability out of new buildings as they are designed. In new buildings, performance contracting bridges the gap between the first-cost and life-cycle-cost perspectives by using long-term energy savings to pay for the incremental first-cost of high-efficiency measures.

'''Existing buildings:''' Green performance contracting provides a mechanism for implementing and financing the building’s efficiency and sustainability upgrades, including improved operations.  Achieving sustainable building performance in existing buildings can be done at reasonable costs. If needed, system or building upgrades can be spread out over time and implemented when capital dollars become available.

Green performance contracting provides comprehensive integrated solutions to a wide variety of building, site and infrastructure improvements, and it allows building owners to pay for these building sustainability improvements, including capital improvements or renewable energy, with funds in the organization’s expense budget.

The result is a better performing building along with all the public relations and marketing benefits of green buildings.&lt;ref&gt;http://energyperformancecontracting.org/GreenPC1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retro-commissioning===
Studies show that virtually every building suffers from incompletely installed controls systems, excessive chilling and heating capacity, and an inability to obtain the data needed to let senior decision makers understand how a building is really performing. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) found that an average building lasts only two-thirds of its forecast life before it needs to be replaced or substantially retrofitted. Often the explanation for this cluster of problems is incomplete or improper building commissioning at the beginning of the building’s life cycle. (Building commissioning is the start-up process by which every new building’s systems are initially configured and calibrated to its occupancy loads to get it up and running.)

According to NIST, the time needed to do building commissioning right is rarely available, defects and opportunities are overlooked, and system potential goes unrealized. Over time equipment performance and control sequences naturally degrade, and substandard performance or even failures of systems and components go unrecognized. The ultimate result is almost universal waste of various kinds, including substantial energy and maintenance cost.

===Independent Measurement and Verification===
Few, if any, of these factors are addressable by the Energy Services Companies or through ESPCs because the information needed to define the real problems is not captured. There is a clear need for integrated solutions that offer the kind of accountability and transparency — and plenty of the “actual data” — that is currently lacking in the ESPC process. What is needed in fact is an independent means of continuously monitoring performance so that buildings reach peak performance sooner and maintain peak performance over time (as represented by the yellow field in the figure) despite changes in use, maintenance, energy cost, and user behavior.

===Key components of ESCO 2.0===
*Real-time integration and visibility of building management systems, metering subsystems, and asset management applications.
*Automated, real-time analysis and reporting of key performance indicators associated with subsystem operations, energy use, and equipment maintenance management.
*Recommendations for results-oriented energy usage and maintenance program refinements that will enable energy reduction targets to be met or exceeded.
*On-going monitoring of subsystems to continually expand energy conservation efforts and maintenance management improvements for further cost reductions.
*Independent verification of ESCO and other Energy Conservation Measures (ECM) programs.
US Federal reporting into [[Office of Management and Budget|OMB]] [[Balanced scorecard|Scorecard]]

===UK and European based ESCOs===
A number of firms have started offering ESCO services in Europe.  As in the US, some belong to utilities, some belong to manufacturers and others are independent.

'''Flint Wagon Works''' of [[Flint, Michigan]], manufactured wagons from the early 1880s. One of the world's most successful horse-drawn vehicle makers they formed with their Flint neighbours a core of the American automobile industry. In 1905 Flint was promoting itself as ''Flint the Vehicle City''.

Flint Wagon Works brought the automotive industry to Flint by buying David Buick's Detroit business and moving it to Flint.

Overburdened with debt and litigation Flint Wagon Works shareholders sold their business to [[William C. Durant]] as of October 12, 1911. Durant took the useful parts of the business and began to manufacture [[Little (automobile)|Little]] automobiles. Sales were hindered by poor quality product and their unappealing brandname and Durant put Little into [[Chevrolet#History|Chevrolet]] in 1913.

|Flint Wagon Works began business after [[James H. Whiting]] (1842–1919), the secretary and general manager of the Flint lumber business, Begole Fox &amp; Co, suggested Begole Fox make wagons. The original business partners were: Whiting, [[Josiah W. Begole]], (later governor of Michigan), [[David Spencer Fox|David S. Fox]], George L. Walker (1838-1909) and Allen Beach Sr, the superintendent of the works, who died in 1885.

They named the new business Flint Wagon Works and in the early 1880s set up a building for it on Flint's West Kearsley Street on a vacant Begole Fox lumber yard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://buickman2.wordpress.com/2012/11/25/chevy-in-the-hole-before-chevrolet/ | work = Buick Factory History | title = Chevy in the Hole Before Chevrolet | date = November 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later [[William S. Ballenger Sr.]], [[Charles A. Cummings|Charles A Cumings]] and Josiah Begole's son, Charles Myron Begole (1848-1921) joined the original partnership.&lt;ref name=GHM&gt;George Humphrey Maines, ''Men ... a city ... and Buick ..., 1903-1953''&lt;/ref&gt; Josiah Begole died in his eighties in 1896.

Begole Fox set up their lumber-mills in September 1865. They were among Flint's largest dealers in lumber and they were major manufacturers of lath and shingles.

==Wagons — Flint's Big Three==
[[File:Sloan Museum July 2018 17 (c. 1908 Flint Wagon Works carriage).jpg|thumb|A Flint Wagon Works carriage c.1908]]
Their business became the second of Flint's "Big Three" wagon builders following [[William A. Paterson]]'s founded by Paterson in 1869. The third new business was founded in the mid 1880s, [[William C. Durant]]'s Flint Road Cart Company later renamed [[Durant-Dort Carriage Company]].&lt;ref name=Flint&gt;''Flint, 1890-1960'', Genesee County Historical Society.

*Flint Wagon Works capacity not reported but output was reported to be wagons 75 per cent and farm wagons 25 per cent
*[[Paterson (automobile)|William A. Paterson]] reported capacity 30,000 vehicles annually, current output 75 per cent carriages and 25 per cent spring wagons
*Durant-Dort Carriage Company reported capacity 70,000 vehicles annually, current output types not disclosed)&lt;ref name=WCB&gt;Wholesale Carriage Building in the Western States. ''Motor body, paint and trim'' v. 40 April 1904. Philadelphia&lt;/ref&gt;

==Automobiles==
===Buick===
Believing buyers of their farm wagons would be interested in buying many more Buick stationary engines&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Orin Wood. ''History of Genesee County, Michigan, Her People, Industries and Institutions''. Federal Publishing, Flint, 1916&lt;/ref&gt; Flint Wagon Works bought existing supplier [[buick#Early years|David Buick's business]], Buick Motor Company, in September 1903 for its stationary and marine engines and its plans to manufacture automobile motors and transmissions.&lt;ref&gt;Industrial, Western.''The Iron and Machinery World'', Chicago St Louis, September 19, 1903 Vol XCIV - No. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Flint Wagon Works built a suitable new building on the opposite side of West Kearsley Street. Some cars were built with these engines and sold with the brand name Whiting-Buick (after chairman James H Whiting). The first production Buick cars were built in that building in 1904.&lt;ref name=Flint/&gt; 
[[File:Marr and Tom Buick.jpg|thumb|Buick car on January 8 or July 8, 1904. The driver is engineer Walter L. Marr, the passenger is David Buick's son, Tom]]
Flint Wagon Works dissolved the old Buick Motor Company and incorporated a wholly new entity, [[Buick|The Buick Motor Company]], on January 29, 1904. Its initial capital stock of $37,500 in shares of $10 each was owned by: [[David Buick]], 1,500; James H. Whiting 610 (and 978 as trustee = 1,588); George L. Walker 590; and [[William S. Ballenger Sr.|William S. Ballenger]] 72. James H Whiting to be manager. Reported as 40 per cent to David Buick and 60 per cent to Flint Wagon Works stockholders. Later Charles Cumings and Charles M. Begole joined the other shareholders.&lt;ref name=GHM/&gt;

The first completed car — a Model B — was begun May 20, 1904, on the road by the beginning of July and delivered to a Dr Herbert Hills of Flint 27 July 1904.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Dolnar. The Buick Motor Company's Side-Entrance Tonneau. ''Cycle and Automobile Trade Journal'', October 1, 1904. page 112, Philadelphia and New York&lt;/ref&gt;

====Durant====
The Buick shareholders persuaded William C. Durant to take on its management. The capital was increased to $300,000 at the beginning of November 1904 when Durant took control. Begole replaced Whiting as president, Ballenger was secretary, Whiting remained a director and Durant joined them on the board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;Buick reorganises and adds capital. ''The Motor World. v. 9 ''. Thursday, November 10, 1904, New York, USA&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1905 a further $300,000 of capital was invested in cash and in addition more shares were issued to Durant in payment for $268,000 worth of patentable inventions and other property introduced by him. Durant moved manufacture to the former plant of [[Durant-Dort Carriage Company#Manufacture of own components|Imperial Wheel]] in Jackson, assembly remained in Flint where the bodies were made by Flint Wagon Works.

Durant's friend, [[Sam McLaughlin]] of Canada's [[McLaughlin Motor Car Company]], offshoot of another major carriage manufacturer, was one of the early customers for the engines because McLaughlin's own in-house design was not ready when their car production began. The manufacture of complete Buicks moved to Hamilton's Farm — Oak Park, Flint — but the engines did not follow until some years later. Buick engines continued to be made in the same building until 1908 or 1909.
[[File:1910 Whiting automobiles by Flint Wagon Works.jpg|thumb|1910 Flint Wagon Works' cars]]

===Whiting automobiles===
Demand for Flint Wagon Works' horse-drawn vehicles maintained its steady decline in the face of the rapidly rising automobile trade. Flint Wagon Works let it be known in early 1909 they were developing new automobiles which would be available in 1910. Their Whiting model A and Whiting Model C were displayed at the Detroit Auto Show in January 1910. The Model A was a light four-cylinder two-passenger roadster with an engine rated at 20&amp;nbsp;hp and the Model C was a five-passenger touring car with a four-cylinder motor rated at 40&amp;nbsp;hp. Both were of conventional design.

Flint Wagon Works then fell deep into well-publicised and expensive litigation over their use of [[Selden patent]] designs in their new engines.&lt;ref&gt;New Cars at Detroit. ''Motor Age'', January 27, 1910, Chicago&lt;/ref&gt; At first the Whiting cars were built in Detroit and Flint-made bodies were added to them then the whole production process was moved to Flint . Some 1200 Whiting cars were sold in 1910 but in the fall of 1910 Flint Wagon Works failed to make a loan repayment and their bank took control appointing  a special board of directors. The bank's trusteeship ended in February 1911 when more than half a million dollars more capital was given to Flint Wagon Works which paid off the bank loan.&lt;ref&gt;The Hub, ''The Automotive Manufacturer'', March 1911, Trade News Publishing Co, New York&lt;/ref&gt;
 . . .

====Durant====
Impressed by Durant's success the Flint Wagon Works directors invited Durant to invest in their own company on the condition that he participate in its management. By this time, 1911, Durant had organised General Motors to hold not only Buick but Cadillac, Olds, Oakland and other successful automobile businesses.

==Terminal difficulties==
Flint Wagon Works was in severe financial difficulties by the beginning of 1911. Some months following that offer Durant paid them just $10 and bought Flint Wagon Works from its shareholders along with all its assets and liabilities. Wagon manufacture continued.

===Spin-offs===
[[File:Flint Wagon Works.png|thumb|The former Flint Wagon Works administration block 1912]]

====Little Motor Car Company====
Durant used those assets of Flint Wagon Works that were still useful to manufacture Little cars. William H. Little's [[Little (automobile)|Little Motor Car Company]] was incorporated on October 19, 1911, by Charles M. Begole, William S. Ballenger Sr, William H. Little (1876-1922), and Durant with a capital of $1,200,000.&lt;br&gt; A.B.C. (Alexander Brownell Cullen) Hardy (1869-1946) was appointed to manage the Little plant.

The same week Durant's other project, [[Chevrolet|Chevrolet Motor Co]] of Detroit was incorporated with $100,000 capital stock. Its incorporators were: Louis Chevrolet, William H Little and Durant's business confidant and son-in-law, Dr Edwin R Campbell.&lt;ref&gt;Durant "Shapes Up" Two Companies. ''The Motor World'', November 9, 1911, Motor World Publishing, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mason Motor Co====
Arthur C. Mason, previously manager of the Buick engine plant in conjunction with Charles Byrne, Charles E. Wetherald and Durant set up his Mason Motor Co in 1911 to make Chevrolet engines for Durant's new [[Chevrolet#History|Chevrolet]] enterprise and first occupied a Flint Wagon Works building before moving to the old Buick building.&lt;ref name=Flint/&gt; See [[Mason Truck]]

====Plant====
Ultimately all the buildings became part of the complex known as [[Chevrolet#History|Chevrolet]] Manufacturing.&lt;ref name=Flint/&gt;

'''Gallery forests''' are [[forest]]s that form as corridors along rivers or wetlands and project into landscapes that are otherwise only sparsely treed such as [[savanna]]s, [[grassland]]s, or [[desert]]s.

Gallery forests are able to exist where the surrounding landscape does not support forests for a number of reasons.  The [[riparian]] zones in which they grow offer greater protection from fire which would kill tree seedlings.&lt;ref&gt;J. Biddulph and M. Kellman, 1998. "Fuels and fire at savanna-gallery forest boundaries in southeastern Venezuela", ''Journal of Tropical Ecology'' 14:4, pp. 445–461. {{JSTOR|2559877}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the alluvial soils of the gallery habitat are often of higher fertility and have better drainage than the soils of the surrounding landscape with a more reliable water supply at depth.  As a result, the boundary between gallery forest and the surrounding woodland or grassland is usually abrupt, with the [[ecotone]] being only a few metres wide.&lt;ref&gt;J. S. Beard, 1955. "A Note on Gallery Forests", ''Ecology'' 36:2, pp. 339–340. {{doi|10.2307/1933242}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gallery forests have shrunk in extent worldwide as a result of human activities, including domestic livestock's preventing tree seedling establishment and the construction of dams and weirs causing flooding or interfering with natural stream flow. In addition to these disturbances, gallery forests are also threatened by many of the same processes that [[Savanna#Threats|threaten savannas]].

'''''Global Steak: Demain nos enfants mangeront des criquets''''' is a 2010 French documentary television film directed by [[Anthony Orliange]].

== Plot ==
The film explores the problem of meat consumption by humans and suggests that the increasing demand of meat in the world could lead to a catastrophe.

=== Entomophagy section ===
* [[entomology|Entomologist]] [[Séverin Tchibozo]] suggests the [[larvae]] of the [[rhinoceros beetle]] contain much [[protein]] (40%), more than [[chicken]] (20%) and [[beef]] (approximately 18%) and that larvae could become a [[Entomophagy|protein source for a large [human] population]].
*Professor [[Arnold van Huis]] at [[Wageningen University]] in [[Netherlands]] says that [[locust]] can produce 1&amp;nbsp;kg [[protein]] from 2&amp;nbsp;kg [[fodder]] compared to a cow needing 10&amp;nbsp;kg fodder to produce the same amount protein. Other benefits are that locust does not produce [[greenhouse gas]]es and does not need [[antibiotics]].
*Marian Peters of Bugs Organic Food talks of people's attitudes towards eating insects and suggests separating [[mealworm]]s from their [[exoskeleton]] and repackaging them in the same manner as [[Surimi]].

The '''HVDC Rihand–Delhi''' is a [[HVDC]] connection between [[Rihand]] and [[Dadri]] (near [[Delhi]]) in India, put into service in 1990.
It connects the 3,000&amp;nbsp;MW coal-based [[Rihand Thermal Power Station]] in [[Uttar Pradesh]] to the northern region of India.  The project has an {{convert|814|km}} long bipolar overhead line.  The transmission voltage is 500&amp;nbsp;kV and the maximum transmission power is 1,500&amp;nbsp;megawatts. The project was built by [[ABB Group|ABB]].

On 24 June 1990, during the commissioning of the scheme, a complete quadrivalve of the Rihand [[HVDC converter station|converter station]] was destroyed, and the other two quadrivalves of the same pole badly damaged, by a fire which is believed to have started as a result of a loose connection on a grading [[capacitor]]. The fire was so intense that the [[valve hall]] was structurally damaged, and the affected converter was out of action for 18 months. Similar incidents on the [[HVDC Itaipu|Itaipu]] project in 1989 and the [[Sylmar Converter Station]] of the [[Pacific DC Intertie]] scheme in 1993 led to [[International Council on Large Electric Systems|CIGRÉ]] publishing guidelines on the design of [[thyristor valve]]s in order to reduce fire risks.&lt;ref&gt;Fire aspects of HVDC thyristor valves and valve halls, [[International Council on Large Electric Systems|CIGRÉ]] Technical Brochure No. 136, February 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

HVDC Rihand-Dadri crosses north of E. Manjhpati the HVDC Ballia-Bhiwadi. This is the first crossing of two independent HVDC lines in India and one of the few worldwide.

[[File:Gravestone of Andrew Drake.jpg|thumb|upright|Captain Andrew Drake (1684–1743) sandstone gravestone from the [[Stelton Baptist Church, Edison|Stelton Baptist Church]] [[Edison, New Jersey]]]]

A '''headstone''', '''tombstone''', or '''gravestone''' is a [[stele]] or marker, usually stone, that is placed over a [[grave]].  They are traditional for burials in the [[Christianity|Christian]], [[Judaism|Jewish]] and [[Islam|Muslim]] religions, among others.  In most cases they have the deceased's name, date of birth, and date of death inscribed on them, along with a personal message, or [[prayer]], but they may contain pieces of [[funerary art]], especially details in stone [[relief]].  In many parts of Europe insetting a photograph of the deceased in a frame is very common.

== Use ==
[[File:Garden of remembrance arch headstone.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Marble]] headstone of a couple buried together in [[Singapore]], showing an arched emblem, signifying the reunification with one's partner in heaven. Within the arch is a statue of [[Jesus Christ]]]]

The [[stele]] (plural [[stele|stelae]]), as it is called in an archaeological context, is one of the oldest forms of [[funerary art]].  Originally, a tombstone was the stone lid of a stone [[coffin]], or the coffin itself, and a gravestone was the stone slab that was laid over a [[grave (burial)|grave]]. Now all three terms are also used for markers placed at the head of the grave. Some graves in the 18th century also contained [[footstone]]s to demarcate the foot end of the grave. This sometimes developed into full kerb sets that marked the whole perimeter of the grave. Footstones were rarely annotated with more than the deceased's initials and year of death, and sometimes a memorial mason and plot reference number. Many [[cemetery|cemeteries]] and [[churchyard]]s have removed those extra stones to ease grass cutting by machine mower. Note that in some UK cemeteries the principal, and indeed only, marker is placed at the ''foot'' of the grave.

Owing to soil movement and [[Downhill creep]] on gentle slopes, older headstones and footstones can often be found tilted at an angle. Over time, this movement can result in the stones being sited several metres away from their original location.

Graves, and any related memorials are a focus for [[mourning]] and remembrance. The names of relatives are often added to a gravestone over the years, so that one marker may chronicle the passing of an entire family spread over decades. Since gravestones and a plot in a cemetery or churchyard cost money, they are also a symbol of wealth or prominence in a community. Some gravestones were even commissioned and erected to their own memory by people who were still living, as a testament to their wealth and status. In a [[Christianity|Christian context]], the very wealthy often erected elaborate [[church monument|memorials]] within [[Church (building)|churches]] rather than having simply external gravestones. [[Crematorium|Crematoria]] frequently offer similar alternatives to families who do not have a grave to mark, but who want a focus for their mourning and for [[Memorial|remembrance]]. Carved or cast [[commemorative plaque]]s inside the crematorium for example may serve this purpose.

== Materials ==
A [[cemetery]] may follow national codes of practice or independently prescribe the size and use of certain materials, especially in a conservation area. Some may limit the placing of a wooden memorial to six months after burial, after which a more permanent memorial must be placed. Others may require stones of a certain shape or position to facilitate grass-cutting. Headstones of [[granite]], [[marble]] and other kinds of [[Rock (geology)|stone]] are usually created, installed, and repaired by [[monumental masonry|monumental masons]]. Cemeteries require regular inspection and maintenance, as stones may settle, topple and, on rare occasions, fall and injure people;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/services/localgovernment/cemletter.htm Memorial safety] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611091332/http://www.hse.gov.uk/services/localgovernment/cemletter.htm |date=11 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or graves may simply become overgrown and their markers lost or [[vandalism|vandalised]].

Restoration is a specialized job for a [[monumental masonry|monumental mason]]. Even overgrowth removal requires care to avoid damaging the carving. For example, ivy should only be cut at the base roots and left to naturally die off, never pulled off forcefully.
Many [[building materials|materials]] have been used as markers.

===Stone===
* '''Fieldstones'''. The earliest markers for graves were natural [[fieldstone]],{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} some unmarked and others decorated or incised using a metal [[bradawl|awl]]. Typical motifs for the carving included a symbol and the deceased's name and age.
* '''Granite'''. [[Granite]] is a hard stone and requires skill to carve by hand. Modern methods of carving include using computer-controlled rotary bits and [[sandblasting]] over a rubber stencil. Leaving the letters, numbers and emblems exposed on the stone, the blaster can create virtually any kind of artwork or epitaph.
* '''Marble''' and '''limestone'''. Both [[limestone]] and [[marble]] take carving well. Marble is a recrystallised form of limestone. The mild acid in rainwater can slowly dissolve marble and limestone over time, which can make inscriptions unreadable. [[Portland stone]] was a type of limestone commonly used in England—after weathering, fossiliferous deposits tend to appear on the surface. [[Marble]] became popular from the early 19th century, though its extra cost limited its appeal.
* '''Sandstone'''. [[Sandstone]] is durable, yet soft enough to carve easily. Some sandstone markers are so well preserved that individual chisel marks are discernible, while others have [[delamination|delaminated]] and crumbled to dust. Delamination occurs when moisture gets between the layers of the sandstone. As it freezes and expands the layers flake off. In the 17th century, sandstone replaced field stones in [[Colonial America]]. [[Yorkstone]] was a common sandstone material used in England.
* '''Slate'''. [[Slate]] can have a pleasing texture but is slightly porous and prone to delamination. It takes lettering well, often highlighted with white paint or [[gilding]].

* '''Iron'''. [[Iron]] grave markers and decorations were popular during the [[Victorian era]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and elsewhere, often being produced by specialist [[foundries]] or the local [[blacksmith]]. [[Cast iron]] headstones have lasted for generations while [[wrought iron]]work often only survives in a rusted or eroded state. In eastern [[Värmland]], Sweden, iron crosses instead of stones have been popular since the 18th century.
* '''White bronze'''. Actually sand cast [[zinc]], but called white bronze for marketing purposes. Almost all, if not all, zinc grave markers were made by the Monumental Bronze Company of Bridgeport, CT, between 1874 and 1914. They are in cemeteries of the period all across the U.S. and Canada. They were sold as more durable than marble, about 1/3 less expensive and progressive.
* '''Wood'''. This was a popular material during the [[Georgian era|Georgian]] and [[Victorian era]], and almost certainly before, in [[Great Britain]] and elsewhere. Some could be very ornate, although few survive beyond 50–100 years due to natural decomposition.
* '''Planting'''. Trees or shrubs, particularly roses, may be planted, especially to mark the location of ashes. This may be accompanied by a small inscribed metal or wooden marker.

== Inscriptions ==
Markers sometimes bear [[monumental inscription|inscriptions]]. The information on the headstone generally includes the name of the deceased and their date of birth and death. Such information can be useful to [[genealogy|genealogists]] and [[local history|local historians]]. Larger cemeteries may require a discreet reference code as well to help accurately fix the location for maintenance. The cemetery owner, church, or, as in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], national guidelines might encourage the use of 'tasteful' and accurate wording in inscriptions. The placement of inscriptions is traditionally placed on the forward-facing side of the memorial but can also be seen in some cases on the reverse and around the edges of the stone itself. Some families request that an inscription be made on the portion of the memorial that will be underground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fergus Wessell |url=http://www.stoneletters.com/gallery/photo/headstone-epitaph/|title=Headstone Gallery |date= |accessdate=2013-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, some gravestones also bear [[epitaph]]s in praise of the deceased or quotations from religious texts, such as "''[[requiescat in pace]]''". In a few instances the inscription is in the form of a plea, admonishment, testament of faith, claim to fame or even a curse—[[William Shakespeare]]'s inscription famously declares

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Good friend, for Jesus' sake forbear,
To dig the dust enclosèd here.
Blest be the man that spares these stones,
And cursed be he that moves my bones.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Or a warning about [[Death|mortality]], such as this [[Persian Empire|Persian]] poetry carved on an ancient tombstone in the [[Tajiki]] capital of [[Dushanbe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.independent.co.uk/fisk/article2941871.ece Robert Fisk: "An urge to smash history into tiny pieces"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215021234/http://news.independent.co.uk/fisk/article2941871.ece |date=15 December 2007 }} [[The Independent]], 8 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Moses roberts syllabics.JPG|thumb|Gravestone in Canada with indigenous language inscription in [[Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics]]]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;I heard that mighty Jamshed the King
Carved on a stone near a spring of water these words:
: "Many—like us—sat here by this spring
: And left this life in the blink of an eye.
: We captured the whole world through our courage and strength,
: Yet could take nothing with us to our grave."&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Or a simpler warning of inevitability of death:
[[File:Jewish cemetery Sobědruhy 06.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Hebrew]] inscriptions on gravestones in [[Sobědruhy]].]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Remember me as you pass by,
As you are now, so once was I,
As I am now, so you will be,
Prepare for death and follow me.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Headstone engravers faced their own "[[year 2000 problem]]" when still-living people, as many as 500,000 in the United States alone, pre-purchased headstones with pre-carved death years beginning with 19–.&lt;ref name=reason&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lynch|first1=Michael W.|title=Grave Problem|journal=[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]|date=July 1999|url=http://reason.com/archives/1999/07/01/grave-problem|accessdate=7 September 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811124405/http://reason.com/archives/1999/07/01/grave-problem|archivedate=11 August 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bas-relief]] carvings of a religious nature or of a profile of the deceased can be seen on some headstones, especially up to the 19th century. Since the invention of photography, a gravestone might include a framed [[photograph]] or [[cameo (carving)|cameo]] of the deceased; photographic images or artwork (showing the loved one, or some other image relevant to their life, interests or achievements) are sometimes now [[engraving|engraved]] onto smooth stone surfaces.

Some headstones use lettering made of white metal fixed into the stone, which is easy to read but can be damaged by ivy or frost. Deep carvings on a hard-wearing stone may weather many centuries exposed in graveyards and still remain legible. Those fixed on the inside of [[Church (building)|churches]], on the [[Commemorative plaque|walls]], or on the [[ledger stone|floor]] (often as near the [[altar]] as possible) may last much longer: such memorials were often embellished with a [[monumental brass]].

The choice of language and/or script on gravestones has been studied by [[Sociolinguistics|sociolinguists]] as indicators of language choices and language loyalty. For example, by studying cemeteries used by immigrant communities,&lt;ref&gt;Doris Francis, Georgina Neophytu, Leonie Kellaher. 2005. ''The Secret Cemetery.'' Oxford: Berg.&lt;/ref&gt; some languages were found to be carved "long after the language ceased to be spoken" in the communities.&lt;ref&gt;p. 42. Kara VanDam. 2009. Dutch- American language shift: evidence from the grave. ''LACUS Forum XXXIV'' 33-42.&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, a language used in the inscription may indicate a religious affiliation.

Marker inscriptions have also been used for political purposes, such as the grave marker installed in January 2008 at [[Cave Hill Cemetery]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] by Mathew Prescott, an employee of [[PETA]]. The grave marker is located near the grave of [[KFC]] founder [[Harland Sanders]] and bears the [[acrostic]] message "KFC tortures birds".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bedard |first=Paul |url=https://www.usnews.com/blogs/washington-whispers/2008/01/10/peta-takes-fight-to-col-sanderss-grave.html |title=PETA Takes Fight to Col. Sanders's Grave |publisher=Usnews.com |date=2008-01-10 |accessdate=2012-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group placed its grave marker to promote its contention that KFC is cruel to chickens.

Gravestones may be simple upright slabs with semi-circular, rounded, gabled, pointed-arched, pedimental, square or other shaped tops. During the 18th century, they were often decorated with ''[[memento mori]]'' (symbolic reminders of [[death]]) such as [[Human skull|skull]]s or winged skulls, winged cherub heads, heavenly crowns, urns or the picks and shovels of the grave digger. Somewhat unusual were more elaborate [[Allegorical sculpture|allegorical figures]], such as Old [[Father Time]], or [[emblem]]s of [[trade]] or [[social status|status]], or even some event from the life of the deceased (particularly how they died). Large tomb chests, false [[sarcophagi]] as the actual remains were in the earth below, or smaller coped chests were commonly used by the [[gentry]] as a means of commemorating a number of members of the same family. In the 19th century, headstone styles became very diverse, ranging from plain to highly decorated, and often using crosses on a base or other shapes differing from the traditional slab. They might be replaced by more elaborately carved markers, such as [[cross]]es or [[angels]]. Simple curb surrounds, sometimes filled with glass chippings, were popular during the mid-20th century.

Islamic headstones are traditionally more a rectangular upright shaft, often topped with a carved topknot symbolic of a [[turban]]; but in Western countries more local styles are often used.

Some form of simple decoration may be employed. Special emblems on tombstones indicate several familiar themes in many faiths. Some examples are:

== Safety ==
Over time a headstone may settle or its fixings weaken. After several instances where unstable stones have fallen in dangerous circumstances, some burial authorities "topple test" headstones by firm pressure to check for stability. They may then tape them off or flatten them.

This procedure has proved controversial in the UK, where an authority's [[duty of care]] to protect visitors is complicated because it often does not have any ownership rights over the dangerous marker. Authorities that have knocked over stones during testing or have unilaterally lifted and laid flat any potentially hazardous stones have been criticised, after grieving relatives have discovered that their relative's marker has been moved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cemeteryfriends.org.uk/7.html National Federation of Cemetery Friends] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201143604/http://www.cemeteryfriends.org.uk/7.html |date=1 December 2008 }} Safety in cemeteries guidance&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2007 [[Consistory Court]] and local authority guidance now restricts the force used in a topple test and requires an authority to consult relatives before moving a stone. In addition, before laying a stone flat, it must be recorded for posterity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecclawsoc.org.uk/cases/case47.shtml Ecclesiastical Case Reports] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012150458/http://www.ecclawsoc.org.uk/cases/case47.shtml |date=12 October 2008 }} Re Keynsham Cemetery Gravestones&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lgo.org.uk/pdf/LGO-612-Special-Report-final.pdf Advice and guidance from The Local Government Ombudsmen] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907053910/http://www.lgo.org.uk/pdf/LGO-612-Special-Report-final.pdf |date=7 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23722">{{Flavour quantum numbers}}
In [[nuclear physics]] and [[particle physics]], '''isospin''' ('''''I''''') is a [[quantum number]] related to the [[strong interaction]]. More specifically, isospin symmetry is a subset of the [[flavour symmetry]] seen more broadly in the interactions of [[baryon]]s and [[meson]]s. 

The name of the concept contains the term ''spin'' because its quantum mechanical description is mathematically similar to that of [[angular momentum operator|angular momentum]] (in particular, in the way it [[angular momentum coupling|couples]]; for example, a proton-neutron pair can be coupled either in a state of total isospin 1 or in one of 0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Povh |first1= Bogdan |last2= Klaus |first2= Rith |last3= Scholz |first3= Christoph |last4= Zetsche |first4= Frank | year=2008 | origyear= 1993 | chapter= 2 |title= Particles and Nuclei |page= 21| isbn=978-3-540-79367-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Unlike angular momentum, however, it is a dimensionless quantity, and is not actually any type of [[spin (physics)|spin]].

[[Etymology|Etymologically]], the term was derived from '''isotopic spin''', a confusing term to which nuclear physicists prefer '''isobaric spin''', which is more precise in meaning. Before the concept of quarks were introduced, particles that are affected equally by the strong force but had different charges (e.g. protons and neutrons) were treated as being different states of the same particle, but having isospin values related to the number of charge states.&lt;ref name=Greiner&gt;{{harvnb|Greiner|Müller|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A close examination of isospin symmetry ultimately led directly to the discovery and understanding of [[quark]]s, and of the development of [[Yang–Mills theory]]. Isospin symmetry remains an important concept in particle physics.

== Quark content and isospin ==

In the modern formulation, isospin (''I'') is defined as a vector quantity in which up and down quarks have a value of ''I''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{frac|1|2}}, with the 3rd-component (''I''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) being {{frac|1|2}} for up quarks, and &amp;minus;{{frac|1|2}} for down quarks, while all other quarks have ''I''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. In general, for hadrons&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Palash Baran Pal]]|title=An Introductory Course of Particle Physics |publisher=
CRC Press|page=226 |isbn=978-1-4822-1698-1|date=2014-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, therefore
:&lt;math&gt;I_3=\frac{1}{2}(n_u-n_d)\ &lt;/math&gt;
where ''n''&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; are the numbers of up and down quarks respectively.

In any combination of quarks, the 3rd component of the isospin vector (''I''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) could either be aligned between a pair of quarks, or face the opposite direction, giving different possible values for total isospin for any combination of quark flavours. [[Hadrons]] with the same quark content but different total isospin can be distinguished experimentally, verifying that flavour is actually a vector quantity, not a scalar (up vs down simply being a projection in the quantum mechanical ''z''-axis of flavour-space).

For example, a strange quark can be combined with an up and a down quark to form a [[baryon]], but there are two different ways the isospin values can combine - either adding (due to being flavour-aligned) or cancelling out (due to being in opposite flavour-directions). The isospin 1 state (the Sigma 0) and the isospin 0 state (the Lambda 0) have different experimentally detected masses and half-lives.

===Isospin and symmetry===
{{see also|Representation theory of SU(2)}}

Isospin is regarded as a symmetry of the strong interaction under the [[group action|action]] of the [[Lie group]] [[SU(2)]], the two [[eigenstate|states]] being the up flavour and down flavour. In [[quantum mechanics]], when a [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] has a symmetry, that symmetry manifests itself through a set of states that have the same energy (the states are described as being ''[[degenerate energy level|degenerate]]''). In simple terms, that the energy operator for the strong interaction gives the same result when an up quark and an otherwise identical down quark are swapped around. 

Like the case for regular spin, the isospin [[operator (physics)|operator]] '''I''' is [[vector space|vector]]-valued: it has three components '''I'''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, '''I'''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;, '''I'''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt; which are coordinates in the same 3-dimensional vector space where the '''3''' representation acts. Note that it has nothing to do with the physical space, except similar mathematical formalism. Isospin is described by two [[quantum number]]s: ''I'', the total isospin, and ''I''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, an eigenvalue of the '''I'''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt; [[vector projection|projection]] for which flavor states are [[eigenstate]]s, not an ''arbitrary projection'' as in the case of spin. In other words, each ''I''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; state specifies certain flavor state of a [[multiplet]]. The third coordinate (''z''), to which the "3" subscript refers, is chosen due to notational conventions which relate [[basis (linear algebra)|bases]] in '''2''' and '''3''' representation spaces. Namely, for the spin-{{frac|1|2}} case, components of '''I''' are equal to [[Pauli matrices]] divided by 2 and '''I'''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt; = {{frac|1|2}} ''τ''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, where

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_3 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; -1 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;.

While the forms of these matrices are isomorphic to those of spin, ''these'' Pauli matrices only act within the Hilbert space of isospin, not that of spin, and therefore is common to denote them with '''τ''' rather than '''σ''' to avoid confusion.

Although isospin symmetry is actually very slightly broken, SU(3) symmetry is more badly broken, due to the much higher mass of the strange quark compared to the up and down. The discovery of [[charm (quantum number)|charm]], [[bottomness]] and [[topness]] could lead to further expansions up to [[SU(6)]] flavour symmetry, which would hold if all six quarks were identical. However, the very much larger masses of the charm, bottom and top quarks means that [[SU(6)]] flavour symmetry is very badly broken in nature (at least at low energies) and assuming this symmetry leads to qualitatively and quantitatively incorrect predictions. In modern applications, such as [[lattice QCD]], isospin symmetry is often treated as exact while the heavier quarks must be treated separately.

==History==

===Original motivation for isospin===

Isospin was introduced as a concept in 1932, well before the 1960s development of the [[quark model]]. The man who introduced it, [[Werner Heisenberg]]&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
 |last=Heisenberg |first=W. |authorlink=Werner Heisenberg
 |year=1932
 |title=Über den Bau der Atomkerne
 |journal=[[Zeitschrift für Physik]]
 |volume=77 |issue=1–2 |pages=1–11
 |doi=10.1007/BF01342433
|bibcode = 1932ZPhy...77....1H |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;, did so to explain symmetries of the then newly discovered [[neutron]] (symbol n):
* The [[mass]] of the neutron and the [[proton]] (symbol p) are almost identical: they are nearly degenerate, and both are thus often called [[nucleon]]s. Although the proton has a positive electric charge, and the neutron is neutral, they are almost identical in all other aspects.
* The strength of the strong interaction between any pair of nucleons is the same, independent of whether they are interacting as protons or as neutrons.

This behavior is not unlike the [[electron]], where there are two possible states based on their spin. Other properties of the particle are conserved in this case. Heisenberg introduced the concept of another conserved quantity that would cause the proton to turn into a neutron and vice versa. In 1937, [[Eugene Wigner]] introduced the term "isospin" to indicate how the new quantity is similar to spin in behavior, but otherwise unrelated.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Protons and neutrons were then grouped together as [[nucleon]]s because they both have nearly the same mass and interact in nearly the same way, if the (much weaker) electromagnetic interaction is neglected. In [[particle physics]], the near mass-degeneracy of the neutron and proton points to an approximate symmetry of the Hamiltonian describing the strong interactions. It was thus convenient to treat them as being different states of the same particle. 

Heisenberg's particular contribution was to note that the mathematical formulation of this symmetry was in certain respects similar to the mathematical formulation of [[spin (physics)|spin]], whence the name "isospin" derives. The neutron and the proton are assigned to the [[doublet (physics)|doublet]] (the spin-{{frac|1|2}}, '''2''', or [[fundamental representation]]) of SU(2). The pions are assigned to the [[spin triplet|triplet]] (the spin-1, '''3''', or [[adjoint representation of a Lie group|adjoint representation]]) of SU(2). Though, there is a difference from the theory of spin: the group action does not preserve [[flavor (particle physics)|flavor]] (specifically, the group action is an exchange of flavour).

Similar to a spin {{frac|1|2}} particle, which has two states, protons and neutrons were said to be of isospin {{frac|1|2}}. The proton and neutron were then associated with different isospin projections ''I''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;+{{frac|1|2}} and −{{frac|1|2}} respectively.

Although the neutron does in fact have a slightly higher mass due to isospin [[Symmetry breaking|breaking]] (this is now understood to be due to the difference in the masses of the up and down quarks and the effects of the electromagnetic interaction), the appearance of an approximate symmetry is useful even if it doesn't exactly hold;  the small symmetry breakings can be described by a [[perturbation theory]], which gives rise to slight differences between the near-degenerate states

When constructing a physical theory of [[nuclear force]]s, one could simply assume that it does not depend on isospin, although the total isospin should be conserved.

=== The particle zoo ===

These considerations would also prove useful in the analysis of [[meson]]-nucleon interactions after the discovery of the [[pion]]s in 1947. The three pions ({{SubatomicParticle|pion+}}, {{SubatomicParticle|pion0}}, {{SubatomicParticle|pion-}}) could be assigned to an isospin triplet with ''I''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 and ''I''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;+1, 0 or −1. By assuming that isospin was conserved by nuclear interactions, the new mesons were more easily accommodated by nuclear theory.

As further particles were discovered, they were assigned into [[isospin multiplet]]s according to the number of different charge states seen: 2 doublets ''I''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{frac|1|2}} of [[kaon|K mesons]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Kaon-}}, {{SubatomicParticle|Antikaon0}}),({{SubatomicParticle|Kaon+}}, {{SubatomicParticle|Kaon0}}), a triplet ''I''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 of Sigma baryons ({{SubatomicParticle|Sigma+}}, {{SubatomicParticle|Sigma0}}, {{SubatomicParticle|Sigma-}}), a singlet ''I''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 Lambda baryon ({{SubatomicParticle|Lambda0}}), a quartet ''I''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{frac|3|2}} Delta baryons ({{SubatomicParticle|Delta++}}, {{SubatomicParticle|Delta+}}, {{SubatomicParticle|Delta0}}, {{SubatomicParticle|Delta-}}), and so on. 

The power of isospin symmetry and related methods comes from the observation that families of particles with similar masses tend to correspond to the invariant subspaces associated with the irreducible representations of the [[Lie algebra]] SU(2). In this context, an invariant subspace is spanned by basis vectors which correspond to particles in a family. Under the action of the Lie algebra SU(2), which generates rotations in isospin space, elements corresponding to definite particle states or superpositions of states can be rotated into each other, but can never leave the space (since the subspace is in fact invariant). This is reflective of the symmetry present. The fact that unitary matrices will commute with the Hamiltonian means that the physical quantities calculated do not change even under unitary transformation. In the case of isospin, this machinery is used to reflect the fact that the mathematics of the strong force behaves the same if a proton and neutron are swapped around (in the modern formulation, the up and down quark).


====An example : Delta baryons====

For example, the particles known as the [[Delta baryon]]s—baryons of [[spin (physics)|spin]] {{frac|3|2}} were grouped together because they all have nearly the same mass (approximately {{val|1232|ul=MeV/c2}}), and interact in nearly the same way.

They could be treated as the same particle, with the difference in charge being due to the particle being in different states. Isospin was introduced in order to be the variable that defined this difference of state. In an analogue to spin, an isospin projection (denoted ''I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'') is associated to each charged state; since there were four Deltas, four projections were needed. Like spin, isospin projections were made to vary in increments of 1. Hence, in order to have four increments of 1, an isospin value of {{frac|3|2}} is required (giving the projections ''I''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{frac|3|2}}, {{frac|1|2}}, &amp;minus;{{frac|1|2}}, &amp;minus;{{frac|3|2}}). Thus, all the Deltas were said to have isospin ''I''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{frac|3|2}} and each individual charge had different ''I''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (e.g. the {{SubatomicParticle|Delta++}} was associated with ''I''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;+{{frac|3|2}}). 

In the isospin picture, the four Deltas and the two nucleons were thought to simply be the different states of two particles. The Delta baryons are now understood to be made of a mix of three up and down quarks - uuu (({{SubatomicParticle|Delta++}}), uud ({{SubatomicParticle|Delta+}}), udd ({{SubatomicParticle|Delta0}}), and ddd ({{SubatomicParticle|Delta-}}); the difference in charge being difference in the charges of up and down quarks ((+{{frac|2|3}}&amp;thinsp;''e'' and −{{frac|1|3}}&amp;thinsp;''e'' respectively); yet, they can also be thought of as the excited states of the nucleons.

=== Gauged isospin symmetry ===

Attempts have been made to promote isospin from a global to a local symmetry. In 1954, [[Chen Ning Yang]] and [[Robert Mills (physicist)|Robert Mills]] suggested that the notion of protons and neutrons, which are continuously rotated into each other by isospin, should be allowed to vary from point to point. To describe this, the proton and neutron direction in isospin space must be defined at every point, giving local basis for isospin. A [[gauge connection]] would then describe how to transform isospin along a path between two points.

This [[Yang–Mills theory]] describes interacting vector bosons, like the [[photon]] of electromagnetism. Unlike the photon, the SU(2) gauge theory would contain self-interacting gauge bosons. The condition of [[gauge invariance]] suggests that they have zero mass, just as in electromagnetism.

Ignoring the massless problem, as Yang and Mills did, the theory makes a firm prediction: the vector particle should couple to all particles of a given isospin ''universally''. The coupling to the nucleon would be the same as the coupling to the [[kaon]]s. The coupling to the [[pion]]s would be the same as the self-coupling of the vector bosons to themselves.

When Yang and Mills proposed the theory, there was no candidate vector boson. [[J. J. Sakurai]] in 1960 predicted that there should be a massive vector boson which is coupled to isospin, and predicted that it would show universal couplings. The [[rho meson]]s were discovered a short time later, and were quickly identified as Sakurai's vector bosons. The couplings of the rho to the nucleons and to each other were verified to be universal, as best as experiment could measure. The fact that the diagonal isospin current contains part of the electromagnetic current led to the prediction of rho-photon mixing and the concept of [[vector meson dominance]], ideas which led to successful theoretical pictures of GeV-scale photon-nucleus scattering.

===The introduction of quarks===
[[Image:Baryon-decuplet-small.svg|thumb|200px|Combinations of three u, d or s-quarks forming baryons with [[spin (physics)|spin]]-{{frac|3|2}} form the ''[[Eightfold way (physics)|baryon decuplet]]''.]]
[[Image:Baryon-octet-small.svg|thumb|200px|Combinations of three u, d or s-quarks forming baryons with spin-{{frac|1|2}} form the ''[[Eightfold way (physics)|baryon octet]]'']]

The discovery and subsequent analysis of additional particles, both [[meson]]s and [[baryon]]s, made it clear that the concept of isospin symmetry could be broadened to an even larger symmetry group, now called [[flavor symmetry]]. Once the [[kaon]]s and their property of [[Strangeness (particle physics)|strangeness]] became better understood, it started to become clear that these, too, seemed to be a part of an enlarged symmetry that contained isospin as a subgroup. The larger symmetry was named the [[Eightfold way (physics)|Eightfold Way]] by [[Murray Gell-Mann]], and was promptly recognized to correspond to the adjoint representation of [[SU(3)]]. To better understand the origin of this symmetry, Gell-Mann proposed the existence of up, down and strange [[quark]]s which would belong to the fundamental representation of the SU(3) flavor symmetry.

In the quark model, the isospin projection (''I''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) followed from the up and down quark content of particles; ''uud'' for the proton and ''udd'' for the neutron. Technically, the nucleon doublet states are seen to be linear combinations of products of 3-particle isospin doublet states and spin doublet states. That is, the (spin-up) proton [[wave function]], in terms of quark-flavour eigenstates, is described by&lt;ref name=Greiner/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\vert p\uparrow \rangle = \frac 1{3\sqrt 2}\left(\begin{array}{ccc} \vert duu\rangle &amp; \vert udu\rangle &amp; \vert uud\rangle \end{array}\right) \left(\begin{array}{ccc} 2 &amp; -1 &amp; -1\\ -1 &amp; 2 &amp; -1\\ -1 &amp; -1 &amp; 2 \end{array}\right) \left(\begin{array}{c} \vert\downarrow\uparrow\uparrow\rangle\\ \vert\uparrow\downarrow\uparrow\rangle\\ \vert\uparrow\uparrow\downarrow\rangle \end{array}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

and the (spin-up) neutron by

:&lt;math&gt;\vert n\uparrow \rangle = \frac 1{3\sqrt 2}\left(\begin{array}{ccc} \vert udd\rangle &amp; \vert dud\rangle &amp; \vert ddu\rangle \end{array}\right) \left(\begin{array}{ccc} 2 &amp; -1 &amp; -1\\ -1 &amp; 2 &amp; -1\\ -1 &amp; -1 &amp; 2 \end{array}\right) \left(\begin{array}{c} \vert\downarrow\uparrow\uparrow\rangle\\ \vert\uparrow\downarrow\uparrow\rangle\\ \vert\uparrow\uparrow\downarrow\rangle \end{array}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;\vert u \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is the [[up quark]] flavour eigenstate, and &lt;math&gt;\vert d \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is the [[down quark]] flavour eigenstate, while &lt;math&gt;\vert\uparrow\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vert\downarrow\rangle&lt;/math&gt; are the eigenstates of &lt;math&gt;S_z&lt;/math&gt;. Although these superpositions are the technically correct way of denoting a proton and neutron in terms of quark flavour and spin eigenstates, for brevity, they are often simply referred to as "''uud''" and "''udd''". Note also that the derivation above assumes exact isospin symmetry and is modified by SU(2)-breaking terms.

Similarly, the isospin symmetry of the [[pion]]s are given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \vert \pi^+\rangle &amp;= \vert u\overline {d}\rangle \\
  \vert \pi^0\rangle &amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\vert u\overline {u}\rangle - \vert d \overline{d} \rangle \right) \\
  \vert \pi^-\rangle &amp;= -\vert d\overline {u}\rangle
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Although the discovery of the [[quark]]s led to reinterpretation of mesons as a vector bound state of a quark and an antiquark, it is sometimes still useful to think of them as being the gauge bosons of a hidden local symmetry.&lt;ref&gt;

==Weak isospin==

{{main article|weak isospin}}
Isospin is similar to, but should not be confused with [[weak isospin]]. Briefly, weak isospin is the gauge symmetry of the [[weak interaction]] which connects quark and lepton doublets of left-handed particles in all generations; for example, up and down quarks, top and bottom quarks, electrons and electron neutrinos. By contrast (strong) isospin connects only up and down quarks, acts on both [[chirality (physics)|chiralities]] (left and right) and is a global (not a gauge) symmetry.

The '''Los Cardones National Park''' ({{lang-es|Parque Nacional Los Cardones}}) is a [[national park]] of [[Argentina]], located in the center-west of the [[provinces of Argentina|province]] of [[Salta Province|Salta]], within the San Carlos and Cachi Departments, in the [[Argentine Northwest]].

==Location==

The park protects an area of the [[Argentine Monte]] ecoregion.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Southern South America: Southern Argentina, stretching northward (NT0802)
 |last=Dellafiore |first=Claudia|publisher=WWF: World Wildlife Fund |url=http://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/nt0802|accessdate=2017-04-12}} &lt;/ref&gt;
The park has an area of 650 square kilometres, with hills and ravines at the height levels between 2,700 m and 5,000 m. It gets its name from the prevalence of bush formations of [[Echinopsis terscheckii|cardon grande cactus]]. It features fossil remains of extinct animals, as well as dinosaur tracks.

The protected area was created in 1996, when the National Parks Administration acquired the land from private owners.

==Climate==
Most of the park has an [[arid climate]] that is characterized by a large thermal amplitude (large difference between day and night temperatures).&lt;ref name=parques&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parquesnacionales.gob.ar/areas-protegidas/region-noroeste/pn-los-cardones/ |title=Parque Nacional Los Cardones |publisher=Administración de Parques Nacionales |language=Spanish |accessdate=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The park receives an average rainfall of {{convert|150|mm|in|abbr=on}}; most of it falling between November to March.&lt;ref name=parques/&gt; Snowfall is extremely rare in low-lying areas.&lt;ref name=parques/&gt; Mean temperatures range from {{convert|11|C|1}} in winter to {{convert|18|C|1}} in summer.&lt;ref name=parques/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1732">'''MDMT''' is one of the design conditions for [[pressure vessel]]s engineering calculations, design and manufacturing according to the [[ASME]] Boilers and Pressure Vessels Code. Each pressure vessel that conforms to the ASME code has its own MDMT, and this temperature is stamped on the vessel nameplate. The precise definition can sometimes be a little elaborate, but in simple terms the MDMT is a temperature arbitrarily selected by the user of type of fluid and the temperature range the vessel is going to handle.  The so-called ''arbitrary'' MDMT must be lower than or equal to the CET (which is an environmental or "process" property, see below) and must be higher than or equal to the (MDMT)&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; (which is a material property).

Critical exposure temperature (CET) is the lowest anticipated temperature to which the vessel will be subjected, taking into consideration lowest [[operating temperature]], operational upsets, autorefrigeration, atmospheric temperature, and any other sources of cooling. In some cases it may be the lowest temperature at which significant [[Stress (mechanics)|stresses]] will occur and not the lowest possible temperature.

(MDMT)&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; is the lowest temperature permitted according to the metallurgy of the vessel fabrication materials and the thickness of the vessel component, that is, according to the [[low temperature embrittlement]] range and the [[charpy impact test]] requirements per temperature and thickness, for each one of the vessel's components.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3453">The '''Moscow–Kashira HVDC transmission system''' was an early [[high-voltage direct current]] (HVDC) connection between the town of [[Kashira]] and the city of [[Moscow]] in Russia, where the terminal was at {{coord|55|39|32|N|37|38|16|E|type:landmark|name=Moscow HVDC Static Inverter}}.  The system was built using [[mercury-arc valve]]s and other equipment removed from the [[Elbe Project]] in [[Berlin]] at the end of [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Kimbark, E.W., Direct current transmission, volume 1, Wiley Interscience, 1971, pp 7&amp;ndash;8.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although primarily experimental in nature, the system was the first true static, electronic,  high-voltage DC scheme to enter service.  Earlier DC transmission schemes had either used electromechanical converters based on the [[René Thury|Thury]] system, such as the [[Lyon–Moutiers DC transmission scheme]] or had been at only medium voltage, such as the 12&amp;nbsp;kV frequency converter scheme at [[Mechanicville, New York]] in the United States.

The scheme had a nominal power rating of 30&amp;nbsp;MW and was operated at different times as a bipole at ±100&amp;nbsp;kV or a monopole, with earth return, at 200&amp;nbsp;kV.   For most of the transmission distance of 125&amp;nbsp;km, the transmission conductor was underground [[high-voltage cable|cable]] but some sections were converted to [[overhead line]].&lt;ref&gt;Cory, B.J., Adamson, C., Ainsworth, J.D., Freris, L.L., Funke, B., Harris, L.A., Sykes, J.H.M., High voltage direct current converters and systems, Macdonald &amp; Co. (publishers) Ltd, 1965, p241.&lt;/ref&gt;
The route of the line was between Kashira and Moscow parallel to the existing 110 kV  overhead AC line.

Initial operating experience was gained using three series-connected, single [[anode]] mercury arc valves in each converter arm, but by 1959 experience had been gained with operating with either one or two mercury arc valves in series per arm.&lt;ref&gt;Nekrasov, A.M., Posse, A.V., Work done in the Soviet Union on High-Voltage Long-Distance DC power transmission, A.I.E.E. Transactions, Vol. 78, part 3A, August 1959, pp515&amp;ndash;521.&lt;/ref&gt;

The experience gained with multiple valves in series in each arm was not wholly successful and the little available literature suggests that the reliability of the scheme was poor.  This may have been because the valves, unlike those being developed in Sweden by Dr [[Uno Lamm]], lacked the external anode voltage divider networks which were found necessary to obtain reliable operation at high voltage.

Nevertheless the scheme provided valuable experience for designing the much larger ±400&amp;nbsp;kV [[HVDC Volgograd–Donbass|Volgograd–Donbass]] project which was completed in 1965 using mercury arc valves of entirely Soviet design.

In 1969 the first thyristor valve built in the Soviet Union was installed in the converter [http://erazvitie.org/lib/2013/sp1/index.html?page=62]. The scheme is however today not in use any more, whereby it is unknown when it was shut down. It is unknown, if the cable is still in place and if the converter hall in Kashira is still standing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6774">[[File:Average gasoline prices by country.svg|thumb|250px|Average gasoline prices by country.]]

'''Petroleum pricing in Nova Scotia''' is based on the Petroleum Products Pricing Act which governs the wholesale and minimum and maximum price of [[gasoline]] and [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] fuels that are authorised in [[Nova Scotia]].

==History==
In the spring of 2004, some consumers and an association representing some retailers (the [[Retail Gasoline Dealers Association of Nova Scotia]]) complained about the rising price of gasoline and diesel fuel, and the closure of rural gas stations due to low volumes and low margins. After appearing before an all party committee on petroleum pricing, the Nova Scotia legislature passed Bill 79 ''The Nova Scotia Petroleum Products Pricing Act''. After a year of not proclaiming it law, [[Rodney MacDonald]], the [[List of Nova Scotia premiers|Premier of Nova Scotia]] announced in May 2006 that petroleum prices will be regulated, beginning on 1 July 2006, two weeks following [[New Brunswick]]'s announcement of doing the same.

==Price Structure==
The price of gasoline and diesel fuel are based on the price on the [[New York Mercantile Exchange]] as a benchmark in Canadian funds. This plus a 6 cent per litre wholesale margin, plus a transportation allowance of 0.5 to 2 cents per litre, and a retail margin of 4 to 5.5 cents per litre (or to a maximum of 7.5 cents per litre for full-serve gasoline).

===Zones===
The transportation of the product is calculated based on six zones in Nova Scotia:

*Zone 1 - [[Halifax Regional Municipality]], [[Hants County, Nova Scotia|Hants County]] and southern [[Colchester County, Nova Scotia|Colchester County]] - 0.5 cents per litre
*Zone 2 - [[Lunenburg County, Nova Scotia|Lunenburg]], [[Kings County, Nova Scotia|Kings]] and Eastern [[Annapolis County, Nova Scotia|Annapolis]] counties, - 1 cent per litre.
*Zone 3 - Western Annapolis, [[Digby County, Nova Scotia|Digby]], [[Yarmouth County, Nova Scotia|Yarmouth]], [[Shelburne County, Nova Scotia|Shelburne]], and [[Queens County, Nova Scotia|Queens]] counties - 1.4 cents per litre.
*Zone 4 - [[Cumberland County, Nova Scotia|Cumberland County]] - 1.5 cents per litre
*Zone 5 - Northern Colchester, [[Pictou County, Nova Scotia|Pictou]], [[Antigonish County, Nova Scotia|Antigonish]], and [[Guysborough, Nova Scotia|Guysborough]] counties, and the Port Hastings - [[Port Hawkesbury, Nova Scotia|Port Hawkesbury]] area of [[Inverness County, Nova Scotia|Inverness County]] - 1.5 cents per litre.
*Zone 6 - the remainder of Inverness County, [[Richmond County, Nova Scotia|Richmond County]], [[Victoria County, Nova Scotia|Victoria County]], and [[Cape Breton Regional Municipality]] - 2 cents per litre.

===Taxes===
*Federal Excise Tax     -  10 cents for Gasoline 6 Cents for Diesel
*Nova Scotia Road Tax     - 15.5 cents
*[[Harmonized Sales Tax]]   15% of the total of the above (about 3 cents per 20 cents per litre)

==Notice==
There is no notice of change in prices. Every Friday, prices may go up or down or stay the same, depending on the market price over the past 7 days.

==Interrupter and Price Changes==
Scheduled price changes occur every second Thursday starting 13 July 2006.
The '''interrupter''' is based on a formula that will determine whether the market prices of  fuels have changed enough to warrant a price change . This “interrupter” formula will run every second Wednesday beginning 19 July 2006.
For the interrupter formula to trigger a price change, a 5-day average [[NYMEX]] spot price from the last price change to the current date, will be calculated. If this new average NYMEX spot price changes by ±4 cents per litre over the last NYMEX spot price average, used to set the scheduled price change, the pump price may be adjusted using the new average NYMEX spot price as the baseline. If the interrupter is not triggered on the interruption date, the current pump price will continue until the next price change the following Thursday.
In extreme circumstances, precipitated by a weather or perhaps a geopolitical event, a catastrophic interrupter could initiated whereby international product prices change by significant amounts, say ±15 cents per litre. This interrupter would be initiated on the day of the price change or the next day when rack prices in Nova Scotia would change.

==Controversy==
Many critics argue that this method of controlling the price of petroleum products is not in the public interest; these critics include the [[Liberal Party (Nova Scotia)|Liberal Party of Nova Scotia]], the [[Nova Scotia Chambers of Commerce]], and vocal critics, mainly in the [[Halifax Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia|Halifax Regional Municipality]], from the public at large. When this was first brought about many including in the [[Nova Scotia New Democratic Party|New Democratic Party]] and the [[Retail Gasoline Dealers Association of Nova Scotia]] wanted a system similar to Prince Edward Island for lower prices. The ones opposing this scheme argued that the PEI system not only keeps prices higher but it does not allow for competition. The lower gasoline prices are a result of PEI's not charging the [[Provincial Sales Tax]] of 10% unlike in Nova Scotia where the [[Harmonized Sales Tax]] of 15% is charged. In [[New Brunswick]], the HST is also charged, but they set a maximum price for most of entire province (no zones) without setting a minimum price. As a price comparison, on 1 July 2006, the same day Nova Scotia started its system, the maximum price in New Brunswick was 112.4 cents per litre for regular self serve compared to Nova Scotia's minimum price of 113.3 to 115.2 (depending on the zone) cents per litre.

'''Piracema''' (from [[nheengatu language|tupi]] "pirá", fish + "sema", exit) is the name given to the period of the year when [[fish]] within the [[Paraguay River]] [[drainage basin]]―which includes the [[Pantanal]] region in the [[Brazil]]ian states of [[Mato Grosso]] and [[Mato Grosso do Sul]]―reproduce.

The season lasts from October to March, during which the fish swim upstream to lay their [[Egg (biology)|eggs]] and reproduce. Thus the season is critical for the maintenance of fish populations in the waters of the local [[river]]s and [[lake]]s. Both of the Brazilian states prohibit [[fishing]] during this period.

==Prohibition of Fishing==

Measures have been taken as a way of preventing impacts from [[overfishing]] during the ''piracema'' period.

In the states of [[Mato Grosso]] and [[Mato Grosso do Sul]] it is a crime to fish in any location that has been designated by any environmental institution.

The use of [[explosive]]s, toxic substances, fishing gear such as spears, harpoons, drag nets, and diving equipment are all prohibited by law, since they can affect the life cycles of the fish population.

Some [[species]] of fish are protected and they can only be caught if they are within a certain size range. For example, the [[Golden Dorado|golden dourado]] (''Salminus brasiliensis'') can only be caught if it is no longer than 55&amp;nbsp;cm.

'''Propene''', also known as '''propylene''' or '''methyl ethylene''', is an [[Unsaturated compound|unsaturated]] [[organic compound]] having the [[chemical formula]] &lt;chem&gt;C3H6&lt;/chem&gt;.  It has one [[double bond]], and is the second simplest member of the [[alkene]] class of [[hydrocarbon]]s. It is a colorless gas with a faint petroleum-like odor&lt;ref&gt;https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Propene#section=Top&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Propene is a byproduct of [[oil refining]] and [[natural gas processing]]. During oil refining, [[ethylene]], propene, and other compounds are produced as a result of [[cracking (chemistry)|cracking]] larger hydrocarbons. A major source of propene is [[Naphtha#Paraffinic|naphtha]] [[Cracking (chemistry)#Steam cracking|cracking]] intended to produce ethylene, but it also results from refinery cracking producing other products.&lt;ref name=Dow&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dow.com/productsafety/finder/pro.htm |title=Product Safety Assessment(PSA): Propylene |publisher= Dow Chemical Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Propene can be separated by [[fractional distillation]] from hydrocarbon mixtures obtained from cracking and other refining processes; refinery-grade propene is about 50 to 70%.&lt;ref name=Dow/&gt;

A shift to lighter steam cracker feedstocks with relatively lower propene yields and reduced motor [[gasoline]] demand in certain areas has reduced propene supply.

===Olefin conversion technology===
In the Phillips Triolefin and the [[Olefin conversion technology]] interconverts propylene is interconverted with ethylene and 2-butenes. Rhenium and molybdenum catalysts are used:&lt;ref name="MG"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ghashghaee|first1=Mohammad|title=Heterogeneous catalysts for gas-phase conversion of ethylene to higher olefins|journal=Rev. Chem. Eng.|doi=10.1515/revce-2017-0003}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH=CHCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;   →   2 CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CHCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

The technology is founded on an [[olefin metathesis]] reaction discovered at [[Phillips Petroleum Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Banks | first1 = R. L. | last2 = Bailey | first2 = G. C. | title = Olefin Disproportionation. A New Catalytic Process | journal = Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry Product Research and Development | volume = 3 |issue=3| pages = 170–173 | year = 1964 | doi = 10.1021/i360011a002}}&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref name=KO&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Metathesis|encyclopedia=Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology|authors=Lionel Delaude, Alfred F. Noels|year=2005| doi=10.1002/0471238961.metanoel.a01|place=Weinheim|publisher=Wiley-VCH}}&lt;/ref&gt; Propene yields of about 90 wt% are achieved. 

Related is the Methanol-to-Olefins/Methanol-to-Propene converts [[syngas|synthesis gas (syngas)]] to methanol, and then converts the methanol to ethylene and/or propene. The process produces water as by-product. Synthesis gas is produced from the reformation of natural gas or by the steam-induced reformation of petroleum products such as naphtha, or by gasification of coal.

===Dehydrogenation===
[[Propane]] [[dehydrogenation]] (PDH) converts propane into propene and by-product hydrogen. The propene from propane yield is about 85 m%. Reaction by-products (mainly hydrogen) are usually used as fuel for the propane dehydrogenation reaction. As a result, propene tends to be the only product, unless local demand exists for hydrogen.  This route is popular in regions, such as the [[Middle East]], where there is an abundance of [[propane]] from oil/gas operations.&lt;ref&gt;Ashford’s Dictionary of Industrial Chemicals, Third edition, 2011, {{ISBN|978-0-9522674-3-0}}, pages 7766-9&lt;/ref&gt; In this region, the propane output is expected to be capable of supplying not only domestic needs, but also the demand from China, where many PDH projects are scheduled to go on stream.  However, as natural gas offerings in the United States are significantly increasing due to the rising exploitation of shale gas, [[propane]] prices are decreasing.  Chemical companies are already planning to establish PDH plants in the USA to take advantage of the low price raw material, obtained from shale gas. Numerous plants dedicated to [[propane]] dehydrogenation are currently under construction around the world.  There are already five licensed technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Giovanni Maggini |url=http://www.slideshare.net/intratec/propylene-production-via-propane-dehydrogenation |title=Technology Economics: Propylene via Propane Dehydrogenation |publisher=Slideshare.net |date=2012-06-28 |accessdate=2013-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The propane dehydrogenation process may be accomplished through different commercial technologies. The main differences between each of them concerns the catalyst employed, design of the reactor and strategies to achieve higher conversion rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Giovanni Maggini |url=http://www.slideshare.net/intratec/technology-economics-propylene-via-propane-dehydrogenation-part-3 |title=Technology Economics: Propylene via Propane Dehydrogenation, Part 3 |publisher=Slideshare.net |date=2013-04-17 |accessdate=2013-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High severity [[fluid catalytic cracking]] (FCC) uses traditional FCC technology under severe conditions (higher catalyst-to-oil ratios, higher steam injection rates, higher temperatures, etc.) in order to maximize the amount of propene and other light products. A high severity FCC unit is usually fed with gas oils (paraffins) and residues, and produces about 20–25 m% propene on feedstock together with greater volumes of motor gasoline and distillate byproducts.

===Market and research===
Several companies have explored [[biomanufacturing]] using engineered [[enzyme]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://greenchemicalsblog.com/2012/10/12/global-bioenergies-in-bio-propylene |website= Green Chemicals Blog |title= Global Bioenergies in bio-propylene |first= Doris |last= de Guzman |date= October 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The starting materials for the fermentation could be either sugars or petrochemicals.

Propene production has remained static at around 35 million [[tonnes]] (Europe and North America only) from 2000 to 2008, but it has been increasing in East Asia, most notably Singapore and China.&lt;ref&gt;Organic Chemistry 6th edition, McMurry,J., Brooks/Cole Publishing, Pacific Grove USA (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Total world production of propene is currently about half that of ethylene.

==Uses==
Propene is the second most important starting product in the [[petrochemical]] industry after [[ethylene]]. It is the raw material for a wide variety of products. Manufacturers of the plastic [[polypropylene]] account for nearly two thirds of all demand.&lt;ref name="Ceresana"/&gt; Polypropylene end uses include films, fibers, containers, packaging, and caps and closures. Propene is also used for the production of important chemicals such as propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, cumene, butyraldehyde, and acrylic acid. In the year 2013 about 85 million tonnes of propene were processed worldwide.&lt;ref name="Ceresana"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceresana.com/en/market-studies/chemicals/propylene/|title=Market Study: Propylene (2nd edition), Ceresana, December 2014|publisher=ceresana.com|accessdate=2015-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Propene and [[benzene]] are converted to [[acetone]] and [[phenol]] via the [[cumene process]]. 
[[Image:Cumene-process-overview-2D-skeletal.png|500px|center|Overview of the cumene process]]

Propene is also used to produce [[isopropanol]] (propan-2-ol), [[acrylonitrile]], [[propylene oxide]], and [[epichlorohydrin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| contribution = 8034.

The industrial production of [[acrylic acid]] involves the catalytic partial oxidation of propene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=J.G.L.|first1=Fierro (Ed.)|title=Metal Oxides, Chemistry and Applications|date=2006|publisher=CRC Press|page=414–455}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Propene is also an intermediate in the one-step propane selective oxidation to acrylic acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The reaction network in propane oxidation over phase-pure MoVTeNb M1 oxide catalysts|journal=Journal of Catalysis|date=March 2014|volume=311|pages=369–385|doi=10.1016/j.jcat.2013.12.008|url=http://hdl.handle.net/11858/00-001M-0000-0014-F434-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Multifunctionality of Crystalline MoV(TeNb) M1 Oxide Catalysts in Selective Oxidation of Propane and Benzyl Alcohol|journal=ACS Catalysis|date=7 June 2013|volume=3|issue=6|pages=1103–1113|doi=10.1021/cs400010q|url=http://hdl.handle.net/11858/00-001M-0000-000E-FA39-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Surface chemistry of phase-pure M1 MoVTeNb oxide during operation in selective oxidation of propane to acrylic acid|journal=Journal of Catalysis|date=January 2012|volume=285|issue=1|pages=48–60|doi=10.1016/j.jcat.2011.09.012|url=http://hdl.handle.net/11858/00-001M-0000-0012-1BEB-F}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kinetic studies of propane oxidation on Mo and V based mixed oxide catalysts|pages=3–24, 93|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.14279/depositonce-2972}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In industry and workshops, propene is used as an alternative fuel to acetylene in [[Oxy-fuel welding and cutting]], brazing and heating of metal for the purpose of bending. It has become a standard in [[BernzOmatic]] products and others in MAPP substitutes,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worthingtonindustries.com/getmedia/ff77868e-b526-44ae-9064-e51aaa5ea02f/wc001-map-pro-premium-hand-torch-fuel For example, "MAPP-Pro"]&lt;/ref&gt; now that true [[MAPP gas]] is no longer available.

==Reactions==
Propene resembles other alkenes in that it undergoes [[Electrophilic addition|addition]] reactions relatively easily at room temperature. The relative weakness of its double bond explains its tendency to react with substances that can achieve this transformation.  Alkene reactions include: 1) [[polymerization]], 2) [[oxidation]], 3) [[halogenation]] and [[hydrohalogenation]], 4) [[alkylation]], 5) [[Hydration reaction|hydration]], 6) [[oligomerization]], and 7) [[hydroformylation]].

===Combustion===
Propene undergoes [[combustion]] reactions in a similar fashion to other [[alkenes]]. In the presence of sufficient or excess oxygen, propene burns to form water and [[carbon dioxide]].

:2 C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + 9 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 6 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

When insufficient oxygen is present for complete combustion, incomplete combustion occurs allowing [[carbon monoxide]] and/or soot ([[carbon]]) to be formed as well.

:C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 2 C + CO

==Environmental safety==
Propene is a product of combustion from forest fires, cigarette smoke, and motor vehicle and aircraft exhaust. It is an impurity in some heating gases. Observed concentrations have been in the range of 0.1-4.8 parts per billion ([[Parts per billion|ppb]]) in rural air, 4-10.5 ppb in urban air, and 7-260 ppb in industrial air samples.&lt;ref name=Dow/&gt;

In the United States and some European countries a [[threshold limit value]] of 500 parts per million ([[Parts per million|ppm]]) was established for occupational (8-hour [[Permissible exposure limit|time-weighted average]]) exposure. It is considered a [[volatile organic compound]] (VOC) and emissions are regulated by many governments, but it is not listed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a [[hazardous air pollutant]] under the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]]. With a relatively short half-life, it is not expected to bioaccumulate.&lt;ref name=Dow/&gt;

Propene has low acute toxicity from inhalation. Inhalation of the gas can cause anesthetic effects and at very high concentrations, unconsciousness. However, the asphyxiation limit for humans is about 10 times higher (23%) than the lower flammability level.&lt;ref name=Dow/&gt;

==Storage and handling==
Since propene is volatile and flammable, precautions must be taken to avoid fire hazards in the handling of the gas. If propene is loaded to any equipment capable of causing ignition, such equipment should be shut down while loading, unloading, connecting or disconnecting.
Propene is usually stored as liquid under pressure, although it is also possible to store it safely as gas at ambient temperature in approved containers.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Fourth edition, 1996, {{ISBN|0471-52689-4}} (v.20), page 261&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pharmacology===
Propene acts as a [[central nervous system]] [[depressant]] via [[allosteric]] agonism of the [[GABAA|GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;]] receptor. Excessive exposure may result in [[sedation]] and [[amnesia]], progressing to [[coma]] and death in a mechanism equivalent to [[benzodiazepine overdose]]. Intentional inhalation may also result in death via [[asphyxiation]] (sudden inhalant death).

==Occurrence in nature==
On September 30, 2013, [[NASA]] announced that the Cassini orbiter spacecraft, part of the [[Cassini-Huygens]] mission, had discovered small amounts of naturally occurring propene in the atmosphere of [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] using spectroscopy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Science_News/2013/09/30/Cassini-finds-ingredient-of-household-plastic-on-Saturn-moon/UPI-42881380571911/ |title=Spacecraft finds propylene on Saturn moon, Titan |publisher=UPI.com |date=2013-09-30 |accessdate=2013-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Cassini_finds_ingredient_of_household_plastic_on_Saturn_moon_999.html |title=Cassini finds ingredient of household plastic on Saturn moon |publisher=Spacedaily.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard Handl''' (born 23 May 1980) is a [[Swedes|Swedish]] man who experimented with building a [[breeder reactor]] in his apartment in [[Ängelholm]], [[Sweden]] for six months in 2011 with the intention to create a nuclear reaction.&lt;ref name=abcau&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-08-05/swedish-kitchen-nuke-reactor/2825356 "Man tries to build nuke reactor in kitchen"].

The '''Sahara Solar Breeder Project''' is a joint [[Japan]]ese-[[Algeria]]n universities plan to use the abundant [[solar energy]] and [[sand]] in the [[Sahara desert]] to build silicon manufacturing plants, and solar power plants, in a way that their products are used in a "breeding" manner to build more and more such plants.&lt;ref name="DigInfoTV"&gt;Darren Quick, [http://www.gizmag.com/sahara-solar-breeder-project/17054 "Sahara Solar Breeder Project aims to provide 50 percent of the world’s electricity by 2050"] ''Gizmag'', 24 November 2010. Retrieved: 25 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The project's declared goal is to provide 50% of the world’s electricity by 2050, using [[Superconductivity|superconductors]] to deliver the power to distant locations.

Innovations conventionally associated with terrestrially first appeared in aquatic [[elpistostegalians]] such as ''[[Panderichthys]] rhombolepis'', ''[[Elpistostege]] watsoni'', and ''[[Tiktaalik roseae]]''. Phylogenetic analyses distribute the features that developed along the tetrapod stem and display a stepwise process of character acquisition, rather than abrupt.&lt;ref name=downs2008&gt;Downs, J. P., Daeschler, E. B., Jenkins, F. A., &amp; Shubin, N. H. (2008). The cranial endoskeleton of Tiktaalik roseae. Nature, 455(7215), 925-929.&lt;/ref&gt; The complete transition occurred over a period of 25 million years beginning with the tetrapodomorph diversification in the [[Middle Devonian]] (380 myr).&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the [[Upper Devonian]] period, the fin-limb transition as well as other skeletal changes such as gill arch reduction, opercular series loss, mid-line fin loss, and scale reduction were already completed in many aquatic organisms.&lt;ref name=coates&gt;Coates, M.I., Jeffery, J.E., &amp; Ruta, M.

Evolution and Development 4(5), 390–396. doi:10.1046/j.1525-142X.2002.02026.x&lt;/ref&gt; As aquatic tetrapods began their transition to land, several skeletal changes are thought to have occurred to allow for movement and respiration on land. Some adaptations required to adjust to non-aquatic life include the movement and use of alternating limbs, the use of pelvic appendages as sturdy propulsors, and the use of a solid surface at the organism’s base to generate propulsive force required for walking.&lt;ref name=king&gt;King, H.M., Shubin, N.H., Coates, M.I., &amp; Hale, M.E.

The water-based [[lateral line system]] was used substantially by these aquatic tetrapods to detect danger from predators.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004).

Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719.&lt;/ref&gt; Within the Osteichthyan diversification, there were no changes related to respiration in the transition as can be seen by the nasal region and palatal morphology in elpistostegalid fishes. The primary change from basic ostelepiform ancestors to the first elpistostegalid in the middle Devonian was to the pre-existing roof skulls.&lt;ref&gt;LONG, J. A. (1990).

=== Head changes in prototetrapod ===

[[File:Elginerpeton BW.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Restoration of ''Elginerpeton'']]

In ''[[Elginerpeton pancheni]]'', a prototetrapod from the late [[Frasnian]], basic tetrapod characteristics in the lower jaw and the cranium are observed. The taxon is believed to fill the gap between elpistostegalid fishes and well-preserved Devonian tetrapods. The ''Elginerpeton'' is considered more derived than the elpistostegalid fishes due to presence of paired fangs on the parasymphysial toothplate, a slender shaped anterior coronoid, and in the loss of the intracranial joint and coronoid fossa.&lt;ref name=Ahlberg1998&gt;Ahlberg, P. E., &amp; Clack, J. A. (1998). Lower jaws, lower tetrapods–a review based on the Devonian genus Acanthostega. Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh: Earth Sciences, 89(01), 11-46.&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of the intercranial joint was a direct functional necessity to strengthen the broad and long platybasic skull when the animal was out of the water.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719.&lt;/ref&gt;  The tubular lower jaw of the ''Elginerpeton'', compared to the flat-lamina jaw shape of fishes gave it superior cross-sectional force, required when not supported in an aquatic setting – allowing for opening of the mouth outside of water. The adaptation may also be interpreted as a specialization for buccopharyngeal breathing. It is speculated to be the first step towards aerial respiration in the transition from fish to tetrapod.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Head changes in aquatic tetrapods ===
[[File:Acanthostega BW.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Restoration of ''Acanthostega'']] 
In the tetrapod and higher clades from the lower-middle [[Famennian]] there are several defining changes on the basis of anatomy of ''[[Ichthyostega]]'', ''[[Tulerpeton]]'', and ''[[Acanthostega]]''. In the cranium, there is a stapes derived from the hyomandibular of fishes; a single bilateral pair of nasal bones, and a fenestra ovalis in the otic capsule of the braincase.&lt;ref&gt;Lebedev, O. A., &amp; Coates, M. I. (1995). The postcranial skeleton of the Devonian tetrapod Tulerpeton curtum Lebedev. Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 114(3), 307-348.&lt;/ref&gt;  The opening of the otic wall of the braincase can be considered a paedomorphic feature for tetrapods and is linked to the stapes functionally.&lt;ref name=Clack1994&gt;Clack, J. A. (1994). Earliest known tetrapod braincase and the evolution of the stapes and fenestra ovalis.&lt;/ref&gt; The stapes was thought to be just a structural support between the palate and the stapedial plate of the braincase.&lt;ref name=Clack1994&gt;Clack, J. A. (1994). Earliest known tetrapod braincase and the evolution of the stapes and fenestra ovalis.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Acanthostega'', it is likely that due to the otic capsule of the brain case being mesial to the stapedial plate, sound was picked up from the palate or the otic notch to allow for rudimentary hearing. It was able to perceive vibrations by opening its mouth by way of the palate. Other factors that caused aquatic tetrapods to spend more time on land caused the development of terrestrial hearing with the development of a tympanum within an otic notch and developed by convergent evolution at least three times.&lt;ref&gt;Laurin, M. (1998, March). The importance of global parsimony and historical bias in understanding tetrapod evolution. Part I. Systematics, middle ear evolution and jaw suspension. In Annales des Sciences Naturelles-Zoologie et Biologie Animale (Vol. 19, No. 1, pp. 1-42). Elsevier Masson.&lt;/ref&gt;
There was also a change in the dermal bones of the skull in the aquatic tetrapods.&lt;ref name=clack2002&gt;Clack, J. A. (2002). A revised reconstruction of the dermal skull roof of Acanthostega gunnari, an early tetrapod from the Late Devonian. Earth and Environmental Science Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, 93(02), 163-165.&lt;/ref&gt; It involved the enlargement of the jugal, ceasing the contact of the maxilla with the squamosal and the single bilateral pair of nasal bones. The feature allows for a stronger bite as well as increasing the strength of the skull.&lt;ref name=clack2002&gt;Clack, J. A. (2002). A revised reconstruction of the dermal skull roof of Acanthostega gunnari, an early tetrapod from the Late Devonian. Earth and Environmental Science Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, 93(02), 163-165.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Teeth and feeding mechanisms ===

Feeding on land is a completely different task than feeding in water. Water is much more dense and viscous compared to air, causing hunting techniques adapted in water to be less successful when applied on land.&lt;ref name=Lauder&gt;Lauder, G. V. (1985). Aquatic feeding in lower vertebrates. Functional vertebrate morphology, 210-229.&lt;/ref&gt; The main technique used in water is suction feeding and is used by most aquatic vertebrates. This technique does not function in air so animals use methods of overtaking prey with jaws followed by biting down.&lt;ref&gt;Bramble, D. M., Liem, K. F., &amp; Wake, D. B. (1985). Functional vertebrate morphology (pp. 38-57). Belknap Press of Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Transitional forms prior to fully developed terrestrial tetrapods such as ''Acanthostega'', are thought to have captured prey in the water.&lt;ref name=Clack2002&gt;Clack, J. A. (2002). The dermal skull roof of Acanthostega gunnari, an early tetrapod from the Late Devonian. Earth and Environmental Science Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, 93(01), 17-33.&lt;/ref&gt; Large coronoid fangs are present in the fishes ''Eusthenopteron'', ''Panderichthys'', and ''Tiktaalik'', and the early tetrapod, ''Ventasega''. In ''Acanthostega'', which is more derived, the large teeth are absent. In ''Eusthenopetron'' and ''Panderichthys'', an ossified operculum is exhibited unlike in the ''Tiktaalik'', ''Ventastega'', and ''Acanthostega''. These differences as well as reductions of the gill chamber and changes in the nature of the lower jaw are hypothesized to indicate a reduced reliance on suction feeding in early tetrapods in comparison to osteolepiform fish.&lt;ref name=Ahlberg1998&gt;Ahlberg, P. E., &amp; Clack, J. A. (1998). Lower jaws, lower tetrapods–a review based on the Devonian genus Acanthostega. Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh: Earth Sciences, 89(01), 11-46.&lt;/ref&gt; This morphological data is not enough however to prove that suction feeding was less used as the morphological changes have been found in fish that use the suction feeding mechanism.&lt;ref name=Clack2002&gt;Clack, J. A. (2002). The dermal skull roof of Acanthostega gunnari, an early tetrapod from the Late Devonian. Earth and Environmental Science Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, 93(01), 17-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cranial sutures are indicators of skull function and morphologies can be linked to specific feeding modes.&lt;ref&gt;Herring, S. W., &amp; Mucci, R. J. (1991). In vivo strain in cranial sutures: the zygomatic arch. Journal of morphology, 207(3), 225-239.&lt;/ref&gt; Transitional feeding changes can be observed by examining cross sectional morphology of a suture in taxa of the fish-tetrapod transition.&lt;ref name= Markey2007&gt;Markey, M. J., &amp; Marshall, C. R. (2007). Terrestrial-style feeding in a very early aquatic tetrapod is supported by evidence from experimental analysis of suture morphology. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 104(17), 7134-7138.&lt;/ref&gt;  Comparing positionally comparable sutures in extant fish allows for the creation of a sutural morphospace.&lt;ref&gt;Markey, M. J., Main, R. P., &amp; Marshall, C. R. (2006). In vivo cranial suture function and suture morphology in the extant fish Polypterus: implications for inferring skull function in living and fossil fish. Journal of Experimental Biology, 209(11), 2085–2102.&lt;/ref&gt; The main cause of sutural deformation is caused by strain during feeding activity, most prominent with feeding mechanisms involving sucking a prey into the mouth.&lt;ref&gt;Markey, M. J., Main, R. P., &amp; Marshall, C. R. (2006). In vivo cranial suture function and suture morphology in the extant fish ''[[Polypterus]]'': implications for inferring skull function in living and fossil fish. Journal of Experimental Biology, 209(11), 2085–2102.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a tension anteriorly, and compression posteriorly strain patterns are observed in ''Polypterus'', a prey-sucking predator. In terrestrial tetrapod ''[[Phonerpeton]]'', there is compression between the frontals and parietals and a complex loading between the post parietals. There is no evidence of tensile strain in any sutures. ''Acanthostega'' fossil records demonstrate that no strain pattern was exhibited that relate to prey capture by means of suction. The load compression is similar to extant tetrapods. It is most likely that the organism captured prey by biting in the water or near the edge of the water. This finding indicates that the terrestrial mode of feeding first emerged in an aquatic environment.&lt;ref name= Markey2007&gt;Markey, M. J., &amp; Marshall, C. R. (2007). Terrestrial-style feeding in a very early aquatic tetrapod is supported by evidence from experimental analysis of suture morphology. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 104(17), 7134-7138.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neck ==
The cranial endoskeleton of ''T. roseae'' shares derived features with tetrapods. There was a loss of opercular and extrascapular elements, enhancing head mobility in ''T. roseae'' compared to other tetrapodomorph fish.&lt;ref name=downs2008&gt;Downs, J. P., Daeschler, E. B., Jenkins, F. A., &amp; Shubin, N. H. (2008). The cranial endoskeleton of Tiktaalik roseae. Nature, 455(7215), 925-929.&lt;/ref&gt; The formation of the neck allowed for locomotion in shallow waters. This environment allows for less motility compared to the three-dimensional space that fish are able to orient themselves in. The body of the organism in these environments would be fixed in the shallow pools with appendages planted on a substrate.&lt;ref name=downs2008&gt;Downs, J. P., Daeschler, E. B., Jenkins, F. A., &amp; Shubin, N. H. (2008). The cranial endoskeleton of Tiktaalik roseae. Nature, 455(7215), 925-929.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Acanthostega'' and ''Ichthyostega'', which are considered to be more derived than other basal aquatic tetrapods, the pectoral girdle is decoupled from the skull. There is also a loss of the dorsal pectoral girdle bones, which permits a large degree of movement for the shoulder. This allowed for a greater degree of movement, and is a necessity for improving aquatic maneuveurs and terrestrial locomotion.&lt;ref&gt;Johanson, Z., Ahlberg, P., &amp; Ritchie, A. (2003). The braincase and palate of the tetrapodomorph sarcopterygian Mandageria fairfaxi: morphological variability near the fish–tetrapod transition. Palaeontology, 46(2), 271-293.&lt;/ref&gt; This could have been driven by the need to lift the head to aid aerial respiration by using nostrils and choanae.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limbs ==

Limbs in vertebrates are occasionally organized into stylopod (relating to the humerus and femur), zeugopod (relating to the radius and tibia, along with associated structures) and autopod (relating to digits) categories, although anatomically, the evolutionary differences between these groups in early tetrapods tends to be vague.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gilbert&gt;Gilbert, S.F. (2000). Development of the tetrapod limb. Developmental Biology 6. Retrieved from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9975/&lt;/ref&gt;
	
The transition from fins to limbs occurred once an endoskeleton entered the base of the fin, as seen in today's lungfish.&lt;ref name=hinch&gt;Hinchliffe, R.J. (1994). Evolutionary developmental biology of the tetrapod limb. Developmental 1994 Supplement, 163-168.&lt;/ref&gt; This is thought to have originated in the group [[Sarcopterygians]], including osteolipiforms like ''Eusthenopteron'', due to the homology of the tetrapod forelimb and the osteolepiform fin endoskeleton.&lt;ref name=hinch /&gt;

''Acanthostega'' is a partially aquatic tetrapod with developed limbs that shares features common with the earlier tetrapods, ''Panderichthys'' and ''Eusthenopteron''.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt; Like ''Panderichthys'',  the humerus of ''Acanthostega'' is flattened dorso-ventrally, the intermedium terminates level with the radius, and the endoskeleton can be divided into stylopodium, zeugopodium and autopodium segments.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt; Similar to ''Eusthenopteron'', the radials do not articulate with the radius on the distal end.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt;  ''Acanthostega'' also has a 1:2 ratio of humerus to radius and ulna, a feature seen in all tetrapods higher than ''Acanthostega'' on the phylogeny.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt;

Unlike ''Panderichthys'', ''Acanthostega'' hind limbs are at least the size of its fore limbs, if not larger.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt; This development of larger limbs is required to physically support the organism during emergence from an aquatic setting to land. The humerus and femur of ''Acanthostega'' also contain evidence of greater development of the appendicular muscles compared to more aquatic tetrapods, hinting at the presence of digits.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt;

Similarly, ''Ossinodus'' has two hindlimbs located bilaterally and proximodistally aymmetrical.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the presence of a small femur during juvenile development, this Carboniferous- period tetrapod is thought to be aquatic during juvenile development; only emerging onto land once it reaches adulthood.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ossinodus'' also has a broad, flat tibia, akin to ''Acanthostega'', and is thought to be only partially terrestrial.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pelvis ==
The development of the pelvic region was crucial for the adaptation from water to land, yet some features of tetrapod locomotion are thought to have arose before the origin of digited limbs or the transition from water to land.&lt;ref name=king /&gt; The fossil record of early tetrapods shows evidence of distinct pelvic development occurring in osteolepiforms, further supporting osteolepiform ancestry of terrestrial tetrapods.&lt;ref name=king /&gt;

''Acanthostega'' has a large pelvis, with the iliac region articulating with the axial skeleton and a broad ischial plate.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt; It has a sacrum; a fundamental skeletal feature that allows the organism to transfer force produced in its hindlimbs to its axial skeleton, and move in a terrestrial environment.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt; A pubo-ischiadic symphysis is also observed, uniting the two pelvic halves.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt;

In contrast, ''[[Protopterus]] annectens'' (a member of lungfish, thought to be a sister group to tetrapods) has a small, anatomically simpler pelvis, a derived limb endoskeleton and a lack of digits.&lt;ref name=king /&gt; Yet, it shares the ability to lift itself using a solid surface as a base with its pelvic region with ''Acanthostega'' and is also observed to move with tetrapod-like locomotion in an aquatic environment.&lt;ref name=king /&gt; This illustrates that a fundamental innovation in tetrapods is also found in a lower, sister taxon, in which members lack a sacrum.&lt;ref name=king /&gt;

== Digits and Limb Joints ==

''Acanthostega'' is the earliest example of a digitized tetrapod.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt; The humerus and femur of ''Acanthostega'' contain evidence of greater development of the appendicular muscles compared to more aquatic tetrapods.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt; ''Acanthostega'' has a total lack of dermal fin rays and displays the presence of two or more spool-shaped bones or cartilages articulating individually in antero-posterial sets on the distal end of its limbs.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt; This feature can now be distinguished as digits instead of the endoskeletal radials seen in earlier tetrapods.

''[[Pederpes]]'', a tetrapod from the Early Carboniferous period, also has hindlimbs containing 5 digits that are rotated to face anteriorly.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike previous tetrapods, who have been only partially adapted to land, ''Pederpes'' has the novel ability to bend its limbs and propel itself forwards in a terrestrial setting. This is attributed to the symmetry of the digits and limbs in ''Pederpes'', allowing it to rotate its hindlimbs to an anteriorly facing position and propel itself from the edge of the foot when moving forward.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719.&lt;/ref&gt; This morphological development of bendable wrists and ankles can distinguish ''Pederpes'' the first true terrestrial tetrapod.

[[File:Tesla's Turbine.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Tesla turbine at [[Nikola Tesla Museum]].]]
[[File:Tesla turbine.png|thumb|right|250px|Tesla turbine]]

The '''Tesla turbine''' is a bladeless centripetal flow [[turbine]] [[Tesla patents|patented]] by [[Nikola Tesla]] in 1913.&lt;ref name="US patent|1061206"&gt;{{US patent|1061206}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is referred to as a ''bladeless turbine''. The Tesla turbine is also known as the  ''boundary layer turbine'', ''cohesion-type turbine'', and ''Prandtl layer turbine'' (after [[Ludwig Prandtl]]) because it uses the ''[[Boundary layer|boundary layer effect]]'' and not a fluid impinging upon the blades as in a conventional turbine.

== Description ==
The guiding idea for developing Tesla turbine is the fact that in order to attain the highest economy, the changes in the velocity and direction of movement of fluid should be as gradual as possible.&lt;ref name="US patent|1061206"/&gt; Therefore, the propelling fluid of Tesla turbine moves in natural paths or stream lines of least resistance.

A Tesla turbine consists of a set of smooth disks, with [[nozzle]]s applying a moving fluid to the edge of the disk. The fluid drags on the disk by means of [[viscosity]] and the [[adhesion]] of the surface layer of the fluid. As the fluid slows and adds energy to the disks it spirals into the center exhaust. Since the [[Rotor (turbine)|rotor]] has no projections it is very sturdy.

&lt;!-- This image is original--&gt;
[[File:TeslaTurbineOriginal.png|thumb|left|333px|View of Tesla turbine "bladeless" design]]

Tesla wrote, "This turbine is an efficient self-starting prime mover which may be operated as a steam or mixed fluid turbine at will, without changes in construction and is on this account very convenient. Minor departures from the turbine, as may be dictated by the circumstances in each case, will obviously suggest themselves but if it is carried out on these general lines it will be found highly profitable to the owners of the steam plant while permitting the use of their old installation. However, the best economic results in the development of power from steam by the Tesla turbine will be obtained in plants especially adapted for the purpose."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rexresearch.com/teslatur/turbine2.htm Nicola Tesla in British Patent 179,043] on RexResearch - a website dedicated to old inventions and inventors.&lt;/ref&gt;

This turbine can also be applied to condensing plants operating with high vacuum. In such a case, owing to the very great expansion ratio, the exhaust mixture will be at a relatively low temperature and suitable for admission to the condenser.

All the plates and washers are fitted on and keyed to a sleeve threaded at the ends and equipped with nuts and collars for drawing the thick end-plates together or the collars may be simply forced onto it and the ends upset. The sleeve has a hole fitting snugly on the shaft, to which it is fastened as usual.

This construction permits free expansion and contraction of each plate individually under the varying influence of heat and centrifugal force and possesses a number of other advantages which are of considerable practical importance. A larger active plate area and consequently more power is obtained for a given width, improving efficiency. Warping is virtually eliminated and smaller side clearances may be used, which results in diminished leakage and friction losses. The rotor is better adapted for dynamic balancing and through rubbing friction resists disturbing influences thereby ensuring quieter running. For this reason and also because the discs are not rigidly joined it is protected against damage which might otherwise be caused by vibration or excessive speed.

&lt;!-- This image is original --&gt;
[[File:Tesla turbine system.png|thumb|right|330px|View of Tesla turbine system]]

The Tesla turbine has the trait of being in an installation normally working with a mixture of steam and products of combustion and in which the exhaust heat is used to provide steam which is supplied to the turbine, providing a valve governing the supply of the steam so that the pressures and temperatures can be adjusted to the optimum working conditions.

As diagrammed, a Tesla turbine installation is:
# Able to start with steam alone
# A disc type adapted to work with fluids at high temperature.

An efficient Tesla turbine requires close spacing of the disks. For example, a steam-powered type must maintain 0.4 millimeter (.016&amp;nbsp;inch) inter-disk spacing. The disks must be extremely smooth to minimize surface and shear losses. Disks must also be very thin to prevent drag and turbulence at disk edges. Unfortunately, preventing disks from warping and distorting was a major challenge in Tesla's time. It is thought that this inability to prevent the disks distorting contributed to the commercial failure of the turbines, because metallurgical technology at the time was not able to produce disks of sufficient quality and rigidity.

== Pump ==
The device can function as a pump if a similar set of disks and a housing with an [[involute]] shape (versus circular for the turbine) are used. In this configuration a motor is attached to the shaft. The fluid enters near the center, is given energy by the disks, then exits at the periphery. The Tesla turbine does not use friction in the conventional sense;  precisely, it avoids it, and uses adhesion (the [[Coandă effect]]) and [[viscosity]] instead. It uses the [[boundary layer effect]] on the  disc blades.

Smooth rotor disks were originally proposed but these gave poor starting torque. Tesla subsequently discovered that smooth rotor disks with small washers bridging the disks in ~12–24 places around the perimeter of a 10″ disk and a second ring of 6–12 washers at a sub-diameter made for a significant improvement in starting torque without compromising efficiency.

== Applications ==
Tesla's patents state that the device was intended for the use of [[fluid]]s as motive agents, as distinguished from the application of the same for the propulsion or [[compression (physical)|compression]] of fluids (though the device can be used for those purposes as well). As of 2016, the Tesla turbine has not seen widespread commercial use since its invention. The Tesla pump, however, has been commercially available since 1982&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discflo.com/history.htm Discflo Disc Pump Technology] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214220002/http://www.discflo.com/history.htm |date=February 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is used to pump fluids that are abrasive, viscous, shear sensitive, contain solids, or are otherwise difficult to handle with other pumps. Tesla himself did not procure a large contract for production. The main drawback in his time, as mentioned, was the poor knowledge of [[materials science|materials characteristics]] and behaviors at high [[temperature]]s. The best [[metallurgy]] of the day could not prevent the turbine disks from moving and warping unacceptably during operation.

In 2003, [[Scott O’Hearen]] took a patent on the Radial turbine blade system. This invention utilizes a combination of the concepts of a smooth runner surface for working fluid frictional contact and that of blades projecting axially from plural transverse runner faces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://greenif.com/links.html Author, Harikishan Gupta E., &amp; Author, Shyam P. Kodali (2013). Design and Operation of Tesla Turbo machine - A state of the art review. International Journal of Advanced Transport Phenomena, 2(1), 2-3.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, many amateur experiments in the field have been conducted using Tesla turbines which use [[compressed air]], [[steam turbine|steam as its power source]] (the steam being generated with heat from fuel combustion, from a vehicle's [[turbocharger]] or from [[solar energy|solar radiation]]). The issue of the warping of the discs has been partially solved using new materials such as carbon fiber.

One proposed current application for the device is a [[Pump|waste pump]], in factories and mills where normal [[stator|vane]]-type [[turbine]] pumps typically get blocked.

Applications of the Tesla turbine as a multiple-disk centrifugal [[ventricular assist device|blood pump]] have yielded promising results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1109/10.46255 | last1 = Miller | first1 = G.

== Efficiency and calculations ==
{{Expert needed|Technology|section|date=October 2009}}
In Tesla's time, the efficiency of conventional turbines was low because turbines used a direct drive system that severely limited the potential speed of a turbine to whatever it was driving. At the time of introduction, modern ship turbines were massive and included dozens, or even hundreds of stages of turbines, yet produced extremely low efficiency due to their low speed. For example, the turbine on the Titanic weighed over 400 tons, ran at just 165rpm, and used steam at a pressure of only 6 PSI. This limited it to harvesting waste steam from the main power plants, a pair of reciprocating steam engines.&lt;ref&gt;Titanic: Building the World's Most Famous Ship
By Anton Gill, P121&lt;/ref&gt; The Tesla turbine also had the ability to run on higher temperature gasses than bladed turbines of the time contributed to its greater efficiency. Eventually axial turbines were given gearing to allow them to operate at higher speeds, but efficiency of axial turbines remained very low in comparison to the Tesla Turbine.

As time went on, competing Axial turbines became dramatically more efficient and powerful, a second stage of reduction gears was introduced in most cutting edge U.S. naval ships of the 1930s. The improvement in steam technology gave the U.S. Navy aircraft carriers a clear advantage in speed over both Allied and enemy aircraft carriers, and so the proven axial steam turbines became the preferred form of propulsion until the 1973 oil embargo took place. The oil crisis drove the majority of new civilian vessels to turn to diesel engines. Axial steam turbines still had not exceeded 50% efficiency by that time, and so civilian ships chose to utilize diesel engines due to their superior efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;The Design of High-Efficiency Turbomachinery and Gas Turbines, David Gordon Wilson, P.15&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, the comparably efficient Tesla turbine was over 60 years old.
[[File:Tesla-Turbine-Testing.png|right]]

Tesla's design attempted to sidestep the key drawbacks of the bladed axial turbines, and even the lowest estimates for efficiency still dramatically outperformed the efficiency of axial steam turbines of the day. However, in testing against more modern engines, the Tesla Turbine had expansion efficiencies far below contemporary steam turbines and far below contemporary reciprocating steam engines.  It does suffer from other problems such as shear losses and flow restrictions, but this is partially offset by the relatively massive reduction in weight and volume. Some of Tesla turbine's advantages lie in relatively low flow rate applications or when small applications are called for. The disks need to be as thin as possible at the edges in order not to introduce turbulence as the fluid leaves the disks. This translates to needing to increase the number of disks as the flow rate increases. Maximum efficiency comes in this system when the inter-disk spacing approximates the thickness of the boundary layer, and since boundary layer thickness is dependent on viscosity and pressure, the claim that a single design can be used efficiently for a variety of fuels and fluids is incorrect. A Tesla turbine differs from a conventional turbine only in the mechanism used for transferring energy to the shaft. Various analyses demonstrate the flow rate between the disks must be kept relatively low to maintain efficiency. Reportedly, the efficiency of the Tesla turbine drops with increased load. Under light load, the spiral taken by the fluid moving from the intake to the exhaust is a tight spiral, undergoing many rotations. Under load, the number of rotations drops and the spiral becomes progressively shorter.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}  This will increase the shear losses and also reduce the efficiency because the gas is in contact with the discs for less distance.

Efficiency is a function of power output. A moderate load makes for high efficiency. Too heavy a load increases the slip in the turbine and lowers the efficiency; with too light a load, little power is delivered to the output, which also decreases efficiency (to zero at idle). This behaviour is not exclusive to Tesla turbines.

[[File:Tesla-Turbine-Small.png|left]]
The [[turbine efficiency]] of the gas Tesla turbine is estimated to be above 60, reaching a maximum of 95 percent {{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}. Keep in mind that turbine efficiency is different from the cycle efficiency of the engine using the turbine. Axial turbines which operate today in steam plants or jet engines have efficiencies of about 60–70% (Siemens Turbines Data).{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} This is different from the cycle efficiencies of the plant or engine which are between approximately 25% and 42%, and are limited by any irreversibilities to be below the [[Carnot cycle]] efficiency. Tesla claimed that a steam version of his device would achieve around 95 percent efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Stearns, E. F., "''[http://www.lindsaybks.com/arch/turbine/ The Tesla Turbine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040409144851/http://www.lindsaybks.com/arch/turbine/ |date=2004-04-09 }}''". Popular Mechanics, December 1911.

The [[thermodynamic efficiency]] is a measure of how well it performs compared to an [[Isentropic process|isentropic case]]. It is the ratio of the ideal to the actual work input/output. Turbine efficiency is defined as the ratio of the ideal change in [[enthalpy]] to the real enthalpy for the same change in [[pressure]].

In the 1950s, [[Warren Rice (engineer)|Warren Rice]] attempted to re-create Tesla's experiments, but he ''did not'' perform these early tests on a pump built strictly in line with the Tesla's patented design (it, among other things, was not a Tesla multiple staged turbine nor did it possess Tesla's nozzle).&lt;ref name="Lancaster"&gt;"''[http://www.teslaengine.org/images/teba15p17.pdf Debunking the Debunker, Don Lancaster Again Puts His Foot In]''", Tesla Engine Builders Association.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rice's experimental single stage system's working fluid was air. Rice's test turbines, as published in early reports, produced an overall measured efficiency of 36–41% for a ''single stage''.&lt;ref name="Lancaster"/&gt; Higher percentages would be expected if designed as originally proposed by Tesla.

In his final work with the Tesla turbine and published just prior to his retirement, Rice conducted a bulk-parameter analysis of model laminar flow in ''multiple disk'' turbines. A very high claim for rotor efficiency (as opposed to overall device efficiency) for this design was published in 1991 titled "Tesla Turbomachinery".&lt;ref&gt;"''Interesting facts about Tesla''" Q&amp;A: [http://www.tfcbooks.com/teslafaq/q&amp;a_033.htm I've heard stories about the Tesla turbine that cite a figure of 95% efficiency.  Do you have any information regarding this claim?  And, why haven't these devices been utilized in the mainstream?]. 21st Century Books.&lt;/ref&gt; This paper states:
{{Quote|''With proper use of the analytical results, the rotor efficiency using laminar flow can be very high, even above 95%. However, in order to attain high rotor efficiency, the flowrate number must be made small which means high rotor efficiency is achieved at the expense of using a large number of disks and hence a physically larger rotor.  For each value of flow rate number there is an optimum value of Reynolds number for maximum efficiency.  With common fluids, the required disk spacing is dismally small causing'' [rotors using] ''laminar flow to tend to be large and heavy for a prescribed throughflow rate.''

''Extensive investigations have been made of Tesla-type liquid pumps using laminar-flow rotors.  It was found that overall pump efficiency was low even when rotor efficiency was high because of the losses occurring at the rotor entrance and exit earlier mentioned.''&lt;ref name="Rice"&gt;Rice, Warren, "[http://www.gyroscope.com/images/teslaturbine/TeslaTurboMachinery.pdf  Tesla Turbomachinery]". Conference Proceedings of the IV International Tesla Symposium, September 22–25, 1991. Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts, Belgrade, Yugoslavia. ([[PDF]])&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}}}}
Modern ''multiple stage'' bladed turbines typically reach 60–70% efficiency, while large steam turbines often show turbine efficiency of over 90% in practice. [[volute (pump)|Volute]] rotor matched Tesla-type machines of reasonable size with common fluids (steam, gas, and water) would also be expected to show efficiencies in the vicinity of 60–70% and possibly higher.&lt;ref name="Rice"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3426">'''Tianjin Climate Exchange''' (TCX) is a domestic [[carbon market]] [[cap-and-trade]] scheme [[exchange (organized market)|exchange]]. Jeff Huang is assistant chairman of Tianjin Climate Exchange and vice-president of [[Chicago Climate Exchange]].

It is China’s first integrated exchange for trading of environmental financial instruments 

TCX is a joint venture between Chicago Climate Exchange, the municipal government of [[Tianjin]] and the [[asset management]] [[division (business)|unit]] of [[PetroChina]], the country’s largest oil and gas producer.

Cap-and-trade schemes are programs under which member companies commit to lowering their greenhouse gas emissions by a certain amount in a certain period of time and trade carbon credits generated by this. As China does not have a national cap on emissions, any such scheme would be voluntary, similar to the situation in the US when the Chicago Climate Exchange launched in 2003.

==History==
On September 25 2008, Tianjin Climate Exchange, co-established by CNPC Assets Management Co., Ltd. (holding a 53% stake), [http://www.cqjy.cn/english/index.htm Tianjin Property Rights Exchange] (北方产权交易市场) (holding a 22% stake), and Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX) (holding a 25% stake), was unveiled in the Tianjin Binhai New Area. 

At the request of the State Council, Tianjin Climate Exchange is established as China's  first comprehensive platform for trading carbon credits under the Clean Development Mechanism, and will promote environmental protection and emission reduction by means of market and financial measures. 

Tianjin Climate Exchange has the following goals: to help enterprises cost-effectively reduce emissions of pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide, chemical oxygen demand, etc.; to help enterprises achieve maximum energy efficiency at minimum cost; to help enterprises manage environmental risks and meet increasing disclosure requirements; and to provide enterprises with integrated international emissions market access and experience. 

In 2006, [[Tianjin Binhai New Area]] was designed by the State Council of the PRC as the national experimental zone for comprehensive reforms related to financial innovation, land and administrative management.

China's [[Eleventh Five-Year Plan (People's Republic of China)|Eleventh Five-Year Plan]] (2006-10) called for cutting energy consumption per unit of GDP up to 20 percent by 2010 while reducing major pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide (SO2) by 10 percent.[3]

==Tianjin Property Rights Exchange==
TPRE was launched in 1994, under government approval. It is a government agent under the charge of Tianjin [[SASAC]] and is the only appointed exchange authorized by Tianjin [[SASAC]] for state-owned assets and equities transaction. It is one of three national institutions permitted by SASAC to transact assets and equities of SOEs under control of central government.[2]

{{Infobox tin}}
'''Tin''' is a [[chemical element]] with the symbol '''Sn''' (from {{lang-la|stannum}}) and [[atomic number]] 50. It is a [[post-transition metal]] in [[group 14]] of the [[periodic table of elements]]. It is obtained chiefly from the [[mineral]] [[cassiterite]], which contains [[tin dioxide|stannic oxide]], SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Tin shows a chemical similarity to both of its neighbors in group 14, [[germanium]] and [[lead]], and has two main [[oxidation state]]s, +2 and the slightly more stable +4. Tin is the 49th most abundant element and has, with 10 stable isotopes, the largest number of stable [[isotope]]s in the periodic table, thanks to its [[magic number (physics)|magic number]] of protons. It has two main [[allotrope]]s: at room temperature, the stable allotrope is β-tin, a silvery-white, [[malleable]] metal, but at low temperatures it transforms into the less dense grey α-tin, which has the [[diamond cubic]] structure. Metallic tin does not easily [[oxidation|oxidize]] in air.

The first tin [[alloy]] used on a large scale was [[bronze]], made of tin and [[copper]], from as early as 3000 BC. After 600 BC, pure metallic tin was produced. [[Pewter]], which is an alloy of 85–90% tin with the remainder commonly consisting of [[copper]], [[antimony]], and lead, was used for [[tableware|flatware]] from the [[Bronze Age]] until the 20th century. In modern times, tin is used in many alloys, most notably tin/lead soft [[solder]]s, which are typically 60% or more tin and in the manufacture of transparent, electrically conducting films of [[indium tin oxide]] in [[optoelectronic]] applications. Another large application for tin is [[corrosion]]-resistant [[tin plating]] of [[steel]]. Because of the low toxicity of inorganic tin, tin-plated steel is widely used for food packaging as [[tin can]]s. However, some [[Organotin chemistry|organotin compounds]] can be almost as toxic as [[cyanide]].

===Physical===
[[File:Tin-2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Drop (liquid)|Droplet]] of solidified molten tin]]
Tin is a soft, [[malleable]], [[ductile]] and highly [[crystal]]line silvery-white [[metal]]. When a bar of tin is bent, a crackling sound known as the "[[tin cry]]" can be heard from the [[Crystal twinning|twinning]] of the crystals.&lt;ref name="Hol1985"&gt;{{cite book|publisher = Walter de Gruyter|date = 1985|edition = 91–100|pages = 793–800|isbn = 3-11-007511-3|title = Lehrbuch der Anorganischen Chemie|first1 = Arnold F.|last1 = Holleman| last2= Wiberg|first2=Egon|last3=Wiberg|first3=Nils|chapter = Tin| language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tin melts at low temperatures of about {{convert|232|C|F}}, the lowest in group 14. The melting point is further lowered to {{convert|177.3|C|F}} for 11&amp;nbsp;nm particles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physorg.com/news/2011-04-ink-tin-nanoparticles-future-circuit.html Ink with tin nanoparticles could print future circuit boards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916090032/http://www.physorg.com/news/2011-04-ink-tin-nanoparticles-future-circuit.html |date=2011-09-16 }}, Physorg, April 12, 2011; {{cite journal|doi=10.1088/0957-4484/22/22/225701|title=Synthesis and characterization of low temperature Sn nanoparticles for the fabrication of highly conductive ink|date=2011|last1=Jo|first1=Yun Hwan|last2=Jung|first2=Inyu|last3=Choi|first3=Chung Seok|last4=Kim|first4=Inyoung|last5=Lee|first5=Hyuck Mo|journal=Nanotechnology|volume=22|issue=22|page=225701|pmid=21454937|bibcode = 2011Nanot..22v5701J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

β-tin (the metallic form, or white tin, BCT structure), which is stable at and above room temperature, is malleable. In contrast, α-tin (nonmetallic form, or gray tin), which is stable below {{convert|13.2|C|F}}, is [[brittle]]. α-tin has a [[diamond cubic]] [[crystal structure]], similar to [[diamond]], [[silicon]] or [[germanium]]. α-tin has no metallic properties at all because its atoms form a covalent structure in which electrons cannot move freely. It is a dull-gray powdery material with no common uses other than a few specialized [[semiconductor]] applications.&lt;ref name="Hol1985"/&gt; These two [[allotrope]]s, α-tin and β-tin, are more commonly known as ''gray tin'' and ''white tin'', respectively. Two more allotropes, γ and σ, exist at temperatures above {{convert|161|C|F}}&amp;nbsp; and pressures above several [[Pascal (unit)|GPa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first = A. M.|last = Molodets|author2=Nabatov, S.

Tin pest was a particular problem in northern Europe in the 18th century as [[organ pipes]] made of tin alloy would sometimes be affected during long cold winters. There are anecdotal claims that tin pest destroyed some of Captain Scott's stores in the ill-fated expedition (see [[tin pest]]). Some unverifiable sources also say that, during [[Napoleon]]'s Russian campaign of 1812, the temperatures became so cold that the tin buttons on the soldiers' uniforms disintegrated over time, contributing to the defeat of the [[Grande Armée]].{{cite book|last = Le Coureur|first = Penny|author2=Burreson, Jay |title = Napoleon's Buttons: 17 Molecules that Changed History|place = New York|publisher = Penguin Group USA|date = 2004}}, a persistent legend that probably has no background in real events. {{cite book|last=Öhrström|first=Lars|title=The Last Alchemist in Paris|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-966109-1}} {{cite journal|last=Cotton|first=Simon|title=Book review: The last alchemist in Paris|journal=Chemistry World|date=2014}}http://rsc.li/CW_140501&lt;/ref&gt; Although the α-β transformation temperature is nominally {{convert|13.2|C|F}}, impurities (e.g. Al, Zn, etc.) lower the transition temperature well below {{convert|0|C|F}} and, on the addition of [[antimony]] or [[bismuth]], the transformation might not occur at all, increasing the durability of the tin.&lt;ref name="Schwartz"&gt;{{cite book|first = Mel|last = Schwartz |title = Encyclopedia of Materials, Parts and Finishes|edition = 2nd|chapter = Tin and Alloys, Properties|publisher = CRC Press|date = 2002|isbn= 1-56676-661-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial grades of tin (99.8%) resist transformation because of the inhibiting effect of the small amounts of bismuth, antimony, lead, and silver present as impurities. Alloying elements such as copper, antimony, bismuth, cadmium, and silver increase its hardness. Tin tends rather easily to form hard, brittle intermetallic phases, which are often undesirable. It does not form wide solid solution ranges in other metals in general, and few elements have appreciable solid solubility in tin. Simple [[Eutectic point|eutectic]] systems, however, occur with [[bismuth]], [[gallium]], [[lead]], [[thallium]] and [[zinc]].&lt;ref name="Schwartz"/&gt;

===Chemical===
Tin resists corrosion from [[water]], but can be attacked by [[acid]]s and [[alkali]]s. Tin can be highly polished and is used as a protective coat for other metals.&lt;ref name="Hol1985"/&gt; A protective oxide ([[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation]]) layer prevents further oxidation, the same that forms on pewter and other tin alloys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KXwgAZJBWb0C&amp;pg=RA1-PT126| page = 126| title = Handbook of corrosion data| isbn = 978-0-87170-518-1| author1 = Craig| first1 = Bruce D.| last2 = Anderson| first2 = David S.| last3 = International| first3 = A.

===Isotopes===
{{Main|Isotopes of tin}}
Tin has ten [[stable isotopes]], with atomic masses of 112, 114 through 120, 122 and 124, the [[List of elements by stability of isotopes|greatest number]] of any element. Of these, the most abundant are &lt;sup&gt;120&lt;/sup&gt;Sn (almost a third of all tin), &lt;sup&gt;118&lt;/sup&gt;Sn, and &lt;sup&gt;116&lt;/sup&gt;Sn, while the least abundant is &lt;sup&gt;115&lt;/sup&gt;Sn. The isotopes with even [[mass number]]s have no [[nuclear spin]], while those with odd have a spin of +1/2. Tin, with its three common isotopes &lt;sup&gt;116&lt;/sup&gt;Sn, &lt;sup&gt;118&lt;/sup&gt;Sn and &lt;sup&gt;120&lt;/sup&gt;Sn, is among the easiest elements to detect and analyze by [[NMR spectroscopy]], and its [[chemical shift]]s are referenced against {{chem|SnMe|4}}.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Only H, F, P, Tl and Xe have a higher receptivity for NMR analysis for samples containing isotopes at their natural abundance.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.nyu.edu/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/aj39/NMRmap.cgi| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110604130629/http://www.nyu.edu/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/aj39/NMRmap.cgi| archivedate = 2011-06-04| title = Interactive NMR Frequency Map| accessdate = 2009-05-05| deadurl = yes| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This large number of stable isotopes is thought to be a direct result of the [[atomic number]] 50, a "[[Magic number (physics)|magic number]]" in nuclear physics. Tin also occurs in 29 unstable isotopes, encompassing all the remaining atomic masses from 99 to 137&lt;!--29 as per [[Isotopes of tin]]; also the inclusive range (99,137) contains 39 integers.--&gt;. Apart from [[Tin-126|&lt;sup&gt;126&lt;/sup&gt;Sn]], with a [[half-life]] of 230,000 years, all the radioisotopes have a half-life of less than a year. The radioactive [[tin-100|&lt;sup&gt;100&lt;/sup&gt;Sn]], discovered in 1994, and [[tin-132|&lt;sup&gt;132&lt;/sup&gt;Sn]] are one of the few nuclides with a "[[Double magic|doubly magic]]" nucleus: despite being unstable, having very lopsided proton–neutron ratios, they represent endpoints beyond which stability drops off rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first = Phil|last = Walker|title = Doubly Magic Discovery of Tin-100|journal = Physics World|volume = 7|issue = June|date = 1994|url = http://physicsworldarchive.iop.org/index.cfm?action=summary&amp;doc=7%2F6%2Fphwv7i6a24%40pwa-xml&amp;qt=|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080430074438/http://physicsworldarchive.iop.org/index.cfm?action=summary&amp;doc=7%2F6%2Fphwv7i6a24%40pwa-xml&amp;qt=|archivedate = 2008-04-30|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another 30 [[metastable isomers]] have been characterized for isotopes between 111 and 131, the most stable being [[Tin-121m|&lt;sup&gt;121m&lt;/sup&gt;Sn]] with a half-life of 43.9 years.&lt;ref name="Audi"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Audi | first = Georges | title = The NUBASE Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties | journal = Nuclear Physics A | volume = 729 | pages = 3–128 | publisher = Atomic Mass Data Center | date = 2003 | doi = 10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001 | bibcode = 2003NuPhA.729....3A | last2 = Bersillon | first2 = O. | last3 = Blachot | first3 = J. | last4 = Wapstra | first4 = A.

The relative differences in the abundances of tin's stable isotopes can be explained by their different modes of formation in [[stellar nucleosynthesis]]. &lt;sup&gt;116&lt;/sup&gt;Sn through &lt;sup&gt;120&lt;/sup&gt;Sn inclusive are formed in the [[s-process|''s''-process]] (slow neutron capture) in most [[star]]s and hence they are the most common isotopes, while &lt;sup&gt;122&lt;/sup&gt;Sn and &lt;sup&gt;124&lt;/sup&gt;Sn are only formed in the [[r-process|''r''-process]] (rapid neutron capture) in [[supernovae]] and are less common. (The isotopes &lt;sup&gt;117&lt;/sup&gt;Sn through &lt;sup&gt;120&lt;/sup&gt;Sn also receive contributions from the ''r''-process.) Finally, the rarest proton-rich isotopes, &lt;sup&gt;112&lt;/sup&gt;Sn, &lt;sup&gt;114&lt;/sup&gt;Sn, and &lt;sup&gt;115&lt;/sup&gt;Sn, cannot be made in significant amounts in the ''s''- or ''r''-processes and are considered among the [[p-nuclei]], whose origins are not well understood yet. Some speculated mechanisms for their formation include proton capture as well as [[photodisintegration]], although &lt;sup&gt;115&lt;/sup&gt;Sn might also be partially produced in the ''s''-process, both directly, and as the daughter of long-lived [[isotopes of indium|&lt;sup&gt;115&lt;/sup&gt;In]].&lt;ref name="Cameron"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Cameron|first1 = A.

==Etymology==
The word ''tin'' is shared among [[Germanic languages]] and can be traced back to [[linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] [[Proto-Germanic]] ''*tin-om''; [[cognate]]s include [[German language|German]] ''{{lang|de|Zinn}}'', [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''{{lang|sv|tenn}}'' and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''{{lang|nl|tin}}''. It is not found in other branches of [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]], except by [[loanword|borrowing]] from Germanic (e.g., [[Irish language|Irish]] ''{{lang|ga|tinne}}'' from English).&lt;ref name="oed"&gt;{{OED|tin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{etymonline|tin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Latin language|Latin]] name ''{{lang|la|stannum}}'' originally meant an alloy of silver and lead, and came to mean 'tin' in the 4th century&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica, 11th Edition'', 1911, ''s.v.'' '[[s:en:1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Tin|tin]]', citing H. Kopp&lt;/ref&gt;—the earlier Latin word for it was ''{{lang|la|plumbum candidum}}'', or "white lead". ''{{lang|la|Stannum}}'' apparently came from an earlier ''{{lang|la|stāgnum}}'' (meaning the same substance),&lt;ref name="oed"/&gt; the origin of the [[Romance language|Romance]] and [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] terms for ''tin''.&lt;ref name="oed"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2009-07-07 |url=http://www.oxleigh.freeserve.co.uk/pt77a.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403092123/http://www.oxleigh.freeserve.co.uk/pt77a.htm |archivedate=2009-04-03 |title=The Ancient Mining of Tin |work=oxleigh.freeserve.co.uk |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of ''{{lang|la|stannum}}''/''{{lang|la|stāgnum}}'' is unknown; it may be pre-[[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[American Heritage Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''{{lang|de|[[Meyers Konversations-Lexikon]]}}'' speculates on the contrary that ''{{lang|la|stannum}}'' is derived from (the ancestor of) [[Cornish language|Cornish]] ''{{lang|kw|stean}}'', and is proof that [[Cornwall]] in the first centuries AD was the main source of tin.

Tin extraction and use can be dated to the beginnings of the Bronze Age around 3000 BC, when it was observed that [[copper]] objects formed of [[polymetallic]] [[ores]] with different metal contents had different physical properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Cierny|given1=J.|surname2=Weisgerber|given2=G.|date=2003|chapter=The "Bronze Age tin mines in Central Asia|editor1-last=Giumlia-Mair|editor1-first=A.|editor2-last=Lo Schiavo|editor2-first=F.|title=The Problem of Early Tin|pages= 23–31|location=Oxford|publisher=Archaeopress|isbn=1-84171-564-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest bronze objects had a tin or arsenic content of less than 2% and are therefore believed to be the result of unintentional [[alloying]] due to trace metal content in the copper ore.&lt;ref name = "pen1986"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Penhallurick|first=R.

[[Arsenical bronze]] objects appear first in the Near East where arsenic is commonly found in association with copper ore, but the [[Arsenic poisoning|health risks]] were quickly realized and the quest for sources of the much less hazardous tin ores began early in the Bronze Age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Charles|first1=J.

[[Cassiterite]] (SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), the tin oxide form of tin, was most likely the original source of tin in ancient times. Other forms of tin ores are less abundant [[sulfide]]s such as [[stannite]] that require a more involved [[smelting]] process. Cassiterite often accumulates in [[alluvial]] channels as [[placer deposits]] because it is harder, heavier, and more chemically resistant than the accompanying [[granite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Penhallurick|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cassiterite is usually black or generally dark in color, and these deposits can be easily seen in [[river banks]]. Alluvial ([[placer deposits|placer]]) deposits could be easily collected and separated by methods similar to [[gold]] [[Gold panning|panning]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

In the great majority of its compounds, tin has the oxidation state II or IV.

===Inorganic compounds===
Halide compounds are known for both oxidation states. For Sn(IV), all four halides are well known: [[Tin(IV) fluoride|SnF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Tin(IV) chloride|SnCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Tin(IV) bromide|SnBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], and [[Tin(IV) iodide|SnI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]]. The three heavier members are volatile molecular compounds, whereas the tetrafluoride is polymeric. All four halides are known for Sn(II) also: [[Tin(II) fluoride|SnF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Tin(II) chloride|SnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Tin(II) bromide|SnBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], and [[Tin(II) iodide|SnI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]. All are polymeric solids. Of these eight compounds, only the iodides are colored.&lt;ref name = "Wiberg&amp;Holleman"&gt;{{Holleman&amp;Wiberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tin(II) chloride]] (also known as stannous chloride) is the most important tin halide in a commercial sense. Illustrating the routes to such compounds, [[chlorine]] reacts with tin metal to give SnCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; whereas the reaction of hydrochloric acid and tin produces SnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and hydrogen gas. Alternatively SnCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and Sn combine to stannous chloride by a process called [[comproportionation]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:SnCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + Sn → 2 SnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Tin can form many oxides, sulfides, and other chalcogenide derivatives. The dioxide SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (cassiterite) forms when tin is heated in the presence of [[air]].&lt;ref name="Wiberg&amp;Holleman" /&gt; SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is [[amphoteric]], which means that it dissolves in both acidic and basic solutions.&lt;ref name = "Sherwood"&gt;''Inorganic &amp; Theoretical chemistry'', F. Sherwood Taylor, Heineman, 6th Edition (1942)&lt;/ref&gt; Stannates with the structure [Sn(OH)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;, like K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[Sn(OH)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;], are also known, though the free stannic acid H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[Sn(OH)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] is unknown.

[[Sulfide]]s of tin exist in both the +2 and +4 oxidation states: [[tin(II) sulfide]] and [[tin(IV) sulfide]] ([[mosaic gold]]).

===Hydrides===
[[Stannane]] (SnH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), with tin in the +4 oxidation state, is unstable. Organotin hydrides are however well known, e.g. [[tributyltin hydride]] (Sn(C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H).&lt;ref name="Hol1985"/&gt; These compound release transient tributyl tin radicals, which are rare examples of compounds of tin(III).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/zaac.19733980109 | title = Organic Derivatives of Tin.

===Organotin compounds===
[[Organotin]] compounds, sometimes called stannanes, are [[chemical compounds]] with tin–carbon bonds.&lt;ref&gt;Elschenbroich, C. "Organometallics" (2006) Wiley-VCH: Weinheim. {{ISBN|978-3-527-29390-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the compounds of tin, the organic derivatives are the most useful commercially.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt; Some organotin compounds are highly toxic and have been used as [[biocide]]s. The first organotin compound to be reported was diethyltin diiodide ((C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SnI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), reported by [[Edward Frankland]] in 1849.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Synthetic aspects of tetraorganotins and organotin(IV) halides|author = Sander H.L. Thoonen|author2 = Berth-Jan Deelman|author3 = Gerard van Koten|journal = [[Journal of Organometallic Chemistry]]|issue = 689|date = 2004|pages = 2145–2157|url = http://igitur-archive.library.uu.nl/chem/2005-0622-182223/13093.pdf|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110807042719/http://igitur-archive.library.uu.nl/chem/2005-0622-182223/13093.pdf|archivedate = 2011-08-07|df = |access-date = 2009-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most organotin compounds are colorless liquids or solids that are stable to air and water. They adopt tetrahedral geometry. Tetraalkyl- and tetraaryltin compounds can be prepared using [[Grignard reagent]]s:&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;
:{{chem|SnCl|4}} + 4 RMgBr → {{chem|R|4|Sn}} + 4 MgBrCl
The mixed halide-alkyls, which are more common and more important commercially than the tetraorgano derivatives, are prepared by [[redistribution reaction]]s:
:{{chem|SnCl|4}} + {{chem|R|4|Sn}} → 2 SnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Divalent organotin compounds are uncommon, although more common than related divalent [[organogermanium]] and [[organosilicon]] compounds. The greater stabilization enjoyed by Sn(II) is attributed to the "[[inert pair effect]]". Organotin(II) compounds include both stannylenes (formula: R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sn, as seen for singlet [[carbene]]s) and distannylenes (R&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which are roughly equivalent to [[alkene]]s. Both classes exhibit unusual reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Peng | first1 = Yang | last2 = Ellis | first2 = Bobby D. | last3 = Wang | first3 = Xinping | last4 = Fettinger | first4 = James C. | last5 = Power | first5 = P.

Tin is generated via the long [[s-process|''s''-process]] in low-to-medium mass stars (with masses of 0.6 to 10 times that of [[Sun]]), and finally by [[beta decay]] of the heavy isotopes of [[indium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=v_6PbAfapSAC&amp;pg=PA119 | pages = 119–121 | title = The physical universe: An introduction to astronomy | isbn = 978-0-935702-05-7 | author1 = Shu | first1 = Frank H. | date = 1982 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160530222732/https://books.google.com/books?id=v_6PbAfapSAC&amp;pg=PA119 | archivedate = 2016-05-30 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tin is the 49th most abundant element in [[Earth]]'s [[crust (geology)|crust]], representing 2&amp;nbsp;[[part per million|ppm]] compared with 75&amp;nbsp;ppm for zinc, 50&amp;nbsp;ppm for copper, and 14&amp;nbsp;ppm for lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Emsley|2001|pp=124, 231, 449 and 503}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tin does not occur as the native element but must be extracted from various ores. [[Cassiterite]] (SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is the only commercially important source of tin, although small quantities of tin are recovered from complex [[sulfide]]s such as [[stannite]], [[cylindrite]], [[franckeite]], [[canfieldite]], and [[teallite]]. Minerals with tin are almost always associated with [[granite]] rock, usually at a level of 1% tin oxide content.&lt;ref name="I230527"&gt;{{cite web|publisher = International Tin Research Institute|title = Tin: From Ore to Ingot|date = 1991|url = http://www.itri.co.uk/pooled/articles/BF_TECHART/view.asp?Q=BF_TECHART_230527|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090322030548/http://www.itri.co.uk/pooled/articles/BF_TECHART/view.asp?Q=BF_TECHART_230527|archivedate = 2009-03-22|accessdate = 2009-03-21|deadurl = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the higher specific gravity of tin dioxide, about 80% of mined tin is from secondary deposits found downstream from the primary lodes. Tin is often recovered from granules washed downstream in the past and deposited in valleys or the sea. The most economical ways of mining tin are by [[dredging]], [[Hydraulic mining|hydraulicking]], or [[open cast mining|open pits]]. Most of the world's tin is produced from [[placer mining|placer]] deposits, which can contain as little as 0.015% tin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=NNlT5of3YikC&amp;pg=PA10 | page = 9 | title = Tin – International Strategic Minerals Inventory Summary Report | isbn = 978-0-941375-62-7 | author1 = Sutphin | first1 = David M. | last2 = Reed | first2 = David M.

About 253,000 tonnes of tin have been mined in 2011, mostly in China (110,000 t), Indonesia (51,000 t), Peru (34,600 t), Bolivia (20,700 t) and Brazil (12,000 t).&lt;ref name="USGS200YB"/&gt; Estimates of tin production have historically varied with the dynamics of economic feasibility and the development of mining technologies, but it is estimated that, at current consumption rates and technologies, the Earth will run out of mine-able tin in 40 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=May 26, 2007|journal = New Scientist|volume = 194|issue = 2605|pages = 38–39|issn = 0262-4079|title = How Long Will it Last?|bibcode = 2007NewSc.194...38R |doi = 10.1016/S0262-4079(07)61508-5|last1=Reilly|first1=Michael }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lester R.

Secondary, or scrap, tin is also an important source of the metal. Recovery of tin through secondary production, or recycling of scrap tin, is increasing rapidly. Whereas the United States has neither mined since 1993 nor smelted tin since 1989, it was the largest secondary producer, recycling nearly 14,000 tonnes in 2006.&lt;ref name="USGS200YB"&gt;{{cite web|publisher = United States Geological Survey|title = Tin: Statistics and Information|url = http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/tin|accessdate = 2008-11-23|first = James F.|last = Carlin, Jr.|format = PDF|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081206004050/http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/tin/|archivedate = 2008-12-06|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[International Tin Council]] was established in 1947 to control the price of tin, until it collapsed in 1985. In 1984, an ''Association of Tin Producing Countries'' was created, with Australia, Bolivia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nigeria, Thailand, and Zaire as members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/treaties/1984/10.html “Agreement establishing the Association of Tin Producing Countries ATS 10 of 1984"]. Australasian Legal Information Institute, Australian Treaties Library. Retrieved on 14 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Price and exchanges==
[[File:SnPrice.png|thumb|World production and price (US exchange) of tin.]]
Tin is unique among other mineral commodities because of the complex agreements between producer countries and consumer countries dating back to 1921. The earlier agreements tended to be somewhat informal and sporadic and led to the "First International Tin Agreement" in 1956, the first of a continuously numbered series that effectively collapsed in 1985. Through this series of agreements, the [[International Tin Council]] (ITC) had a considerable effect on tin prices. The ITC supported the price of tin during periods of low prices by buying tin for its buffer stockpile and was able to restrain the price during periods of high prices by selling tin from the stockpile. This was an anti-free-market approach, designed to assure a sufficient flow of tin to consumer countries and a profit for producer countries. However, the buffer stockpile was not sufficiently large, and during most of those 29 years tin prices rose, sometimes sharply, especially from 1973 through 1980 when rampant inflation plagued many world economies.&lt;ref name=price/&gt;

During the late 1970s and early 1980s, the U.S. Government tin stockpile was in an aggressive selling mode, partly to take advantage of the historically high tin prices. The sharp recession of 1981–82 proved to be quite harsh on the tin industry. Tin consumption declined dramatically. The ITC was able to avoid truly steep declines through accelerated buying for its buffer stockpile; this activity required the ITC to borrow extensively from banks and metal trading firms to augment its resources. The ITC continued to borrow until late 1985 when it reached its credit limit. Immediately, a major "tin crisis" followed — tin was delisted from trading on the London Metal Exchange for about three years, the ITC dissolved soon afterward, and the price of tin, now in a free-market environment, plummeted sharply to $4 per pound and remained at that level through the 1990s.&lt;ref name=price&gt;Carlin, James F., Jr. (1998).

USGS.&lt;/ref&gt; The price increased again by 2010 with a rebound in consumption following the 2008–09 world economic crisis, accompanying restocking and continued growth in consumption by the world's developing economies.&lt;ref name="USGS200YB"/&gt;

In 2006, about half of all tin produced was used in solder. The rest was divided between tin plating, tin chemicals, brass and bronze alloys, and niche uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Tin Use Survey 2007|work = ITRI|url = http://www.itri.co.uk/pooled/articles/BF_TECHART/view.asp?Q=BF_TECHART_297350|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081207093536/http://www.itri.co.uk/pooled/articles/BF_TECHART/view.asp?Q=BF_TECHART_297350|archivedate = 2008-12-07|accessdate = 2008-11-21|deadurl = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solder===
[[File:Ex Lead freesolder.jpg|right|thumb|A coil of lead-free [[solder]] wire]]
Tin has long been used in alloys with lead as [[solder]], in amounts 5 to 70% w/w. Tin with lead forms a [[eutectic system|eutectic mixture]] at the weight proportion of 61.9% tin and 38.1% lead (the atomic proportion: 73.9% tin and 26.1% lead), with melting temperature of 183&amp;nbsp;°C (361.4&amp;nbsp;°F) . Such solders are primarily used for joining [[plumbing|pipes]] or [[electric circuit]]s. Since the European Union [[Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive]] (WEEE Directive) and [[Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive]] came into effect on 1 July 2006, the lead content in such alloys has decreased. Replacing lead has many problems, including a higher melting point, and the formation of [[Whisker (metallurgy)|tin whiskers]] causing electrical problems. [[Tin pest]] can occur in lead-free solders, leading to loss of the soldered joint. Replacement alloys are rapidly being found, although problems of joint integrity remain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1289/ehp.113-a682| author = Black, Harvey|title = Getting the Lead Out of Electronics| journal = Environmental Health Perspectives|volume = 113|issue = 10|date = 2005| pmid = 16203230| pages = A682–5| pmc = 1281311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tin plating===
Tin bonds readily to [[iron]] and is used for coating [[lead]], zinc and steel to prevent corrosion. [[Tin plating|Tin-plated]] steel containers are widely used for [[food preservation]], and this forms a large part of the market for metallic tin. A tinplate canister for preserving food was first manufactured in London in 1812.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last= Childs |first= Peter |date= July 1995 |title= The tin-man's tale |url= http://pubs.rsc.org/historical-collection/products/EIC#!issueid=EIC-1995-32-4 |url-access=subscription |magazine= [[Education in Chemistry]] |volume= 32 |issue= 4 |page= 92 |publisher= [[Royal Society of Chemistry]] |access-date= 19 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2006/02/09/a-canned-history-of-tinned-food-115875-16682285/ https://books.google.com/books?id=EmJRAAAAMAAJ Page 59 https://books.google.com/books?id=qz8rAAAAYAAJ --&gt; Speakers of British English call them "tins", while speakers of American English call them "[[tin cans|cans]]" or "tin cans". One derivation of such use is the slang term "[[tinnie]]" or "tinny", meaning "can of beer" in [[Australia]]. The [[tin whistle]] is so called because it was first mass-produced in tin-plated steel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IpuaAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA13 | pages = 10–15 | title = Tin Under Control | isbn = 978-0-8047-2136-3 | author1 = Control | first1 = Tin Under | date = 1945 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160531012725/https://books.google.com/books?id=IpuaAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA13 | archivedate = 2016-05-31 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qz8rAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA10 | pages = 10–22 | title = Trends in the use of tin | author1 = Panel On Tin, National Research Council (U.S.).

Most metal pipes in a [[pipe organ]] are of a tin/lead alloy, with 50/50 being the most common composition. The proportion of tin in the pipe defines the pipe's tone, since tin has a desirable tonal resonance. When a tin/lead alloy cools, the lead cools slightly faster and produces a mottled or spotted effect. This metal alloy is referred to as spotted metal. Major advantages of using tin for pipes include its appearance, its workability, and resistance to corrosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=cgDJaeFFUPoC&amp;pg=PT426|isbn = 978-0-415-94174-7| page = 411|chapter = Pipe Metal|editor =Robert Palmieri|date = 2006|publisher = Garland|location = New York|title = Encyclopedia of keyboard instruments}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=I0h525OVoTgC&amp;pg=PA501|page=501|title=The Art of Organ Building Audsley, George Ashdown|isbn = 978-0-486-21315-6|chapter = Metal Pipes: And the Materials used in their Construction|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|date=1988|author= George Ashdown Audsley}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- https://books.google.com/books?id=aU6giw-OdyUC&amp;pg=PA32--&gt;

[[File:Punched tin barn lantern.jpeg|thumb|A 21st-century reproduction barn lantern made of punched tin.&lt;!--Barn lanterns were placed over candles and oil lamps to reduce fire hazard when inside barns, and were in use up until the mid-20th century by some farmers.--&gt;]]
Punched tin-plated steel, also called pierced tin, is an artisan technique originating in central Europe for creating housewares that are both functional and decorative. Decorative piercing designs exist in a wide variety, based on local tradition and the artisan's personal creations. Punched tin lanterns are the most common application of this artisan technique. The light of a candle shining through the pierced design creates a decorative light pattern in the room where it sits. Lanterns and other punched tin articles were created in the New World from the earliest European settlement. A well-known example is the Revere lantern, named after [[Paul Revere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nBFmcBMNp4kC | title = Making &amp; decorating picture frames | isbn = 978-0-89134-739-2 | author1 = Bridge | first1 = Janet | date = September 1996 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160520205056/https://books.google.com/books?id=nBFmcBMNp4kC | archivedate = 2016-05-20 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the modern era, in some areas of the Alps, a goat or sheep's horn would be sharpened and a tin panel would be punched out using the alphabet and numbers from one to nine. This learning tool was known appropriately as "the horn". Modern reproductions are decorated with such motifs as hearts and tulips.

In America, [[pie safe]]s and food safes were in use in the days before refrigeration. These were wooden cupboards of various styles and sizes – either floor standing or hanging cupboards meant to discourage vermin and insects and to keep dust from perishable foodstuffs. These cabinets had tinplate inserts in the doors and sometimes in the sides, punched out by the homeowner, cabinetmaker or a tinsmith in varying designs to allow for air circulation while excluding flies. Modern reproductions of these articles remain popular in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tin punching|url=http://www.piercedtin.com/about-us.htm|accessdate=August 15, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811010659/http://www.piercedtin.com/about-us.htm|archivedate=August 11, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Window glass is most often made by floating molten [[glass]] on molten tin ([[float glass]]), resulting in a flat and flawless surface.

===Organotin compounds===
{{Main|Organotin chemistry}}
Of all the [[chemical compound]]s of tin, the organotin compounds are most heavily used. Worldwide industrial production probably exceeds 50,000 [[tonne]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=lAm5e1YVnm4C&amp;pg=PA144 | page = 144 | chapter = Organotin in Industrial and Domestic Products | title = Trace element speciation for environment, food and health | isbn = 978-0-85404-459-7 | author1 = Ebdon | first1 = L. | last2 = Britain) | first2 = Royal Society of Chemistry (Great | date = 2001 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160521055409/https://books.google.com/books?id=lAm5e1YVnm4C&amp;pg=PA144 | archivedate = 2016-05-21 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====PVC stabilizers====
The major commercial application of organotin compounds is in the stabilization of [[PVC]] plastics. In the absence of such stabilizers, PVC would otherwise rapidly degrade under heat, light, and atmospheric oxygen, resulting in discolored, brittle products. Tin scavenges labile [[chloride]] ions (Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), which would otherwise initiate loss of HCl from the plastic material.&lt;ref name=Atkins&gt;{{cite book|pages=343, 345|isbn=0-7167-4878-9|title=Inorganic chemistry|author=Atkins, Peter|author2=Shriver, Duward F.|author3=Overton, Tina|author4=Rourke, Jonathan|last-author-amp=yes|edition=4th|publisher=W.H.

====Organic chemistry====
Some tin [[reagent]]s are useful in [[organic chemistry]]. In the largest application, stannous chloride is a common reducing agent for the conversion of [[nitro compound|nitro]] and [[oxime]] groups to [[amine]]s. The [[Stille reaction]] couples organotin compounds with organic [[halide]]s or [[pseudohalogen|pseudohalides]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = The Stille Reaction|first1=Vittorio|last1=Farina|last2=Krishnamurthy|first2=Venkat|last3=Scott|first3=William J.|journal = Organic Reactions|date = 1997|doi = 10.1002/0471264180.or050.01|isbn = 0-471-31273-8|publisher = Wiley|location = New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Li-ion batteries====
{{main|Lithium-ion battery}}
Tin forms several inter-metallic phases with lithium metal, making it a potentially attractive material for battery applications. Large volumetric expansion of tin upon alloying with lithium and instability of the tin-organic electrolyte interface at low electrochemical potentials are the greatest challenges to employment in commercial cells. The problem was partially solved by Sony. Tin inter-metallic compound with cobalt and carbon has been implemented by Sony in its Nexelion cells released in the late 2000s. The composition of the active material is approximately Sn&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;. Recent research showed that only some crystalline facets of tetragonal (beta) Sn are responsible for undesirable electrochemical activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Electrochemistry Communications|first1 = Ivan|last1 = Lucas|last2=Syzdek|first2=Jaroslaw|date = 2011|doi = 10.1016/j.elecom.2011.08.026|journal = Electrochemistry Communications|volume = 13|issue = 11|page = 1271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Precautions==

A '''variable-frequency drive''' ('''VFD'''; also termed ''adjustable-frequency drive'', “variable-voltage/variable-frequency (VVVF) drive”, ''variable speed drive'', ''AC drive'', ''micro drive'' or ''[[inverter (electrical)|inverter]] drive'') is a type of [[adjustable-speed drive]] used in [[electro-mechanical]] drive systems to control [[AC motor]] [[speed]] and [[torque]] by varying motor input [[frequency]] and [[voltage]].&lt;ref name=Campbell&gt;{{cite book | first=Sylvester J. | last=Campbell | authorlink= | year=1987 | title=Solid-State AC Motor Controls | edition= | publisher=Marcel Dekker, Inc. | location=New York | isbn=0-8247-7728-X | pages= 79–189 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jaeschke&gt;{{cite book | first=Ralph L. | last=Jaeschke | authorlink= | year=1978 | title=Controlling Power Transmission Systems | edition= | publisher=Penton/IPC | location=Cleveland, OH | id= |pages=210–215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Siskind&gt;{{cite book | first=Charles S. | last=Siskind | authorlink= | year=1963 | title=Electrical Control Systems in Industry | edition= | publisher=McGraw-Hill, Inc. | location=New York | isbn= 0-07-057746-3 | page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NEMA-Guide&gt;{{cite book | last=NEMA Standards Publication | title=Application Guide for AC Adjustable Speed Drive Systems | year=2007 | url=http://www.nema.org/stds/acadjustable.cfm | accessdate=Mar 27, 2008 | publisher=National Electrical Manufacturers Association (now The Association of Electrical Equipment and Medical Imaging Manufacturers) | location=Rosslyn, VA USA | page=4 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080428091020/http://www.nema.org/stds/acadjustable.cfm | archive-date=April 28, 2008 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

VFDs are used in applications ranging from small appliances to large compressors. About 25% of the world's electrical energy is consumed by electric motors in industrial applications, which can be more efficient when using VFDs in centrifugal load service;&lt;ref name="ABB-energy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy efficiency makes a difference|url=http://www02.abb.com/db/db0003/db002698.nsf/0/a3881ed5c3dbc647c12575080036dafd/$file/energy_efficiency_makes_difference_191108.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, VFDs' global [[market penetration]] for all applications is relatively small. 
	
Over the last four decades, [[power electronics]] technology has reduced VFD cost and size and has improved performance through advances in semiconductor switching devices, drive topologies, simulation and control techniques, and control hardware and software.

VFDs are made in a number of different low- and medium-voltage [[AC/AC converter|AC-AC]] and DC-AC topologies.

== System description and operation ==

[[File:VFD System.png|right|thumb|320px|VFD system]]
A variable-frequency drive is a device used in a drive system consisting of the following three main sub-systems:  AC motor, main drive [[controller (control theory)|controller]] assembly, and drive/operator interface.&lt;ref name=Jaeschke/&gt;{{rp|210–211}}&lt;ref name=NEMA-Guide/&gt;

=== AC motor ===
The AC electric motor used in a VFD system is usually [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase]] [[induction motor]]. Some types of [[Single-phase electric power|single-phase]] motors or [[synchronous motor]]s can be advantageous in some situations, but generally three-phase induction motors are preferred as the most economical. Motors that are designed for fixed-speed operation are often used. Elevated-voltage stresses imposed on induction motors that are supplied by VFDs require that such motors be designed for definite-purpose inverter-fed duty in accordance with such requirements as Part 31 of [[National Electrical Manufacturers Association|NEMA]] Standard MG-1.&lt;ref&gt;NEMA Guide, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Controller ===
The VFD controller is a [[solid state (electronics)|solid-state]] power electronics conversion system consisting of three distinct sub-systems: a [[rectifier]] bridge converter, a [[direct current]] (DC) link, and an inverter. [[Voltage source|Voltage-source]] inverter (VSI) drives (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below) are by far the most common type of drives. Most drives are [[AC/AC Converter|AC-AC]] drives in that they convert AC line input to AC inverter output. However, in some applications such as common DC bus or [[Solar energy|solar]] applications, drives are configured as DC-AC drives. The most basic rectifier converter for the VSI drive is configured as a three-phase, six-pulse, [[Full-wave rectifier|full-wave]] [[diode bridge]]. In a VSI drive, the DC link consists of a [[capacitor]] which smooths out the converter's DC output [[ripple (electrical)|ripple]] and provides a stiff input to the inverter. This filtered DC voltage is converted to quasi-[[sine wave|sinusoidal]] AC voltage output using the inverter's active switching elements. VSI drives provide higher [[power factor]] and lower [[harmonic distortion]] than [[Phase fired controllers|phase-controlled]] [[current source|current-source]] inverter (CSI) and load-commutated inverter (LCI) drives (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below). The drive controller can also be configured as a [[phase converter]] having single-phase converter input and three-phase inverter output.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, pp. 79-83&lt;/ref&gt;

Controller advances have exploited dramatic increases in the voltage and current ratings and switching frequency of solid-state power devices over the past six decades. Introduced in 1983,&lt;ref name="Bose (2006)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bose|first=Bimal K.|title=Power Electronics and Motor Drives : Advances and Trends|year=2006|publisher=Academic|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-0-12-088405-6|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[insulated-gate bipolar transistor]] (IGBT) has in the past two decades come to dominate VFDs as an inverter switching device.&lt;ref name=Bartos21st&gt;{{cite journal  | last =Bartos | first =Frank J. | title =AC Drives Stay Vital for the 21st Century | journal =Control Engineering | publisher =Reed Business Information | date =Sep 1, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference  | first =Robert E. | last = Eisenbrown | title = AC Drives, Historical and Future Perspective of Innovation and Growth | booktitle = Keynote Presentation for the 25th Anniversary of The Wisconsin Electric Machines and Power Electronics Consortium (WEMPEC) | pages =6–10 | publisher =WEMPEC | date =May 18, 2008   | location = University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last =Jahn   | first =Thomas M. |author2=Owen, Edward L.  | title =AC Adjustable-Speed Drives at the Millennium: How Did We Get Here? | journal =IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages =17–25 | publisher =IEEE | date =Jan 2001  | doi =10.1109/63.903985 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In variable-[[torque]] applications suited for Volts-per-Hertz (V/Hz) drive control, AC motor characteristics require that the voltage magnitude of the inverter's output to the motor be adjusted to match the required load torque in a [[linearity|linear]] V/Hz relationship. For example, for 460&amp;nbsp;V, 60&amp;nbsp;Hz motors, this linear V/Hz relationship is  460/60 = 7.67&amp;nbsp;V/Hz. While suitable in wide-ranging applications, V/Hz control is sub-optimal in high-performance applications involving low speed or demanding, dynamic speed regulation, positioning, and reversing load requirements. Some V/Hz control drives can also operate in [[quadratic function|quadratic]] V/Hz mode or can even be programmed to suit special multi-point V/Hz paths.&lt;ref name=BasicsACDrive&gt;{{cite web|title=Basics of AC drives|url=http://www3.sea.siemens.com/step/flash/STEPACDrives/index.htm|accessdate=Apr 18, 2012|page=Hardware-Part 2: slide 2 of 9|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419103737/http://www3.sea.siemens.com/step/flash/STEPACDrives/index.htm|archive-date=April 19, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bose (1980)"&gt;{{cite book | first=Bimal K. | last=Bose | authorlink= | year=1980 | title=Adjustable Speed AC Drive Systems | edition= | publisher=IEEE Press | location=New York | isbn=0-87942-146-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two other drive control platforms, [[vector control (motor)|vector control]] and [[direct torque control]] (DTC), adjust the motor voltage magnitude, angle from reference, and frequency&lt;ref name="Yano"&gt;{{cite web|last=Yano|first=Masao|title=History of Power Electronics for Motor Drives in Japan|url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/images/4/49/Yano2.pdf|accessdate=18 April 2012|page=13|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; so as to precisely control the motor's magnetic flux and mechanical torque.

Although [[space vector modulation|space vector]] [[pulse-width modulation]] (SVPWM) is becoming increasingly popular,&lt;ref name="Bose (2011)"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bose|first=Bimal K.|title=Energy Scenario and Impact on Power Electronics In the 21st Century|url=http://www.peia2011.com/downloads/Bose_fullpaper.pdf|booktitle=PEIA 2011 - Workshop on Power Electronics for Industrial Applications and Renewable Energy Conversion|page=12|location=Doha,Qatar|accessdate=Feb 8, 2012|year=2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502212901/http://www.peia2011.com/downloads/Bose_fullpaper.pdf|archive-date=May 2, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; sinusoidal PWM (SPWM) is the most straightforward method used to vary drives' motor voltage (or current) and frequency. With SPWM control (see Fig. 1), quasi-sinusoidal, variable-pulse-width output is constructed from intersections of a saw-toothed [[carrier signal]] with a modulating sinusoidal signal which is variable in operating frequency as well as in voltage (or current).&lt;ref name=Bartos21st/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bose 2006, p. 183"&gt;Bose (2006), p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, pp. 82–85&lt;/ref&gt;

Operation of the motors above rated nameplate speed (base speed) is possible, but is limited to conditions that do not require more power than the nameplate rating of the motor. This is sometimes called "field weakening" and, for AC&amp;nbsp;motors, means operating at less than rated V/Hz and above rated nameplate speed. [[Permanent magnet]] synchronous motors have quite limited field-weakening speed range due to the constant magnet [[flux linkage]]. Wound-rotor synchronous motors and induction motors have much wider speed range. For example, a 100&amp;nbsp;HP, 460&amp;nbsp;V, 60&amp;nbsp;Hz, 1775&amp;nbsp;[[revolutions per minute|RPM]] (4-pole) induction motor supplied with 460&amp;nbsp;V, 75&amp;nbsp;Hz (6.134&amp;nbsp;V/Hz), would be limited to 60/75 = 80% torque at 125% speed (2218.75&amp;nbsp;RPM) = 100% power.&lt;ref&gt;Bose (1980), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; At higher speeds, the induction motor torque has to be limited further due to the lowering of the breakaway torque{{efn|NEMA Guide defines a motor's breakaway torque as 'The torque that a motor produces at zero speed when operating on a control', and a motor's breakdown torque as 'The maximum torque that it will develop with rated voltage applied at rated frequency on sinewave power, without an abrupt drop in speed.'}} of the motor. Thus, rated power can be typically produced only up to 130-150% of the rated nameplate speed. Wound-rotor synchronous motors can be run at even higher speeds. In rolling mill drives, often 200-300% of the base speed is used. The mechanical strength of the rotor limits the maximum speed of the motor.

[[File:Pwm.png|right|thumb|240px|Fig. 1: SPWM carrier-sine input &amp; 2-level PWM output]]

An [[embedded system|embedded]] [[microprocessor]] governs the overall operation of the VFD controller. Basic [[Computer programming|programming]] of the microprocessor is provided as user-inaccessible [[firmware]]. User programming of [[display device|display]], variable, and function block parameters is provided to control, protect, and monitor the VFD, motor, and driven equipment.&lt;ref name=Bartos21st/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Basics of AC Drives, p. Programming: slide 3 of 7&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic drive controller can be configured to selectively include such optional power components and accessories as follows: 
* Connected upstream of converter -- [[circuit breaker]] or [[fuse (electrical)|fuse]]s, isolation [[contactor]], [[Electromagnetic compatibility|EMC]] filter, line [[inductor|reactor]], passive filter
* Connected to DC link -- [[braking chopper]], braking [[resistor]]
* Connected downstream of inverter—output reactor, sine wave filter, dV/dt filter.{{efn|The mathematical symbol dV/dt, defined as the [[derivative]] of voltage&amp;nbsp;V with time&amp;nbsp;t, provides a measure of rate of voltage rise, the maximum admissible value of which expresses the capability of capacitors, motors, and other affected circuit elements to withstand high current or voltage spikes due to fast voltage changes; dV/dt is usually expressed in V/microsecond.&lt;ref name=EPCOS&gt;{{cite web|title=Film capacitors - Short Definition of Terms|url=http://www.epcos.com/web/generator/Web/Sections/ProductCatalog/Capacitors/FilmCapacitors/PDF/PDF__DefinitionOfTerms,property=Data__en.pdf;/PDF_DefinitionOfTerms.pdf|accessdate=22 May 2012|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref&gt;Basics of AC Drives, p. Hardware - Part 2: slide 7 of 9&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Operator interface ===
The operator interface provides a means for an operator to start and stop the motor and adjust the operating speed. Additional operator control functions might include reversing, and switching between manual speed adjustment and automatic control from an external [[process control]] signal. The operator interface often includes an [[alphanumeric]] display or indication lights and meters to provide information about the operation of the drive. An operator interface keypad and display unit is often provided on the front of the VFD controller as shown in the photograph above. The keypad display can often be cable-connected and mounted a short distance from the VFD controller. Most are also provided with [[input/output|input and output]] (I/O) terminals for connecting push buttons, switches, and other operator interface devices or control signals. A [[serial communications]] [[Computer port (hardware)|port]] is also often available to allow the VFD to be configured, adjusted, monitored, and controlled using a computer.&lt;ref name=Bartos21st/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cleaveland&gt;{{cite journal | last =Cleaveland | first =Peter | title = AC Adjustable Speed Drives | journal =Control Engineering | publisher =Reed Business Information | date =Nov 1, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, pp. 107-129&lt;/ref&gt;

Referring to the accompanying chart, drive applications can be categorized as single-quadrant, two-quadrant, or four-quadrant; the chart's four quadrants are defined as follows:&lt;ref name=TGN8&gt;{{cite web|title=Technical guide No. 8 - Electrical Braking|url=http://www05.abb.com/global/scot/scot201.nsf/veritydisplay/6866afe6c69df93dc1257888004521e1/$file/abb_technical%20guide%20no.8_revb.pdf|accessdate=Apr 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EnergyRegen&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy Regeneration|url=http://www.freescale.com/files/training_pdf/WBNR_ENERGY_REGENERATION.pdf|accessdate=Apr 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Basics of AC Drives, pp. Hardware - Part 1: slides  9-10 of 11&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Quadrant I - Driving or motoring,&lt;ref&gt;Energy Regeneration, slide 3&lt;/ref&gt; forward [[acceleration|accelerating]] quadrant with positive speed and torque 
* Quadrant II - Generating or braking, forward braking-[[deceleration|decelerating]] quadrant with positive speed and negative torque
* Quadrant III - Driving or motoring, reverse accelerating quadrant with negative speed and torque
* Quadrant IV - Generating or braking, reverse braking-decelerating quadrant with negative speed and positive torque.

Most applications involve single-quadrant loads operating in quadrant I, such as in variable-torque (e.g. centrifugal pumps or fans) and certain constant-torque (e.g. extruders) loads.

Certain applications involve two-quadrant loads operating in quadrant I and II where the speed is positive but the torque changes [[electrical polarity|polarity]] as in case of a fan decelerating faster than natural mechanical losses. Some sources define two-quadrant drives as loads operating in quadrants I and III where the speed and torque is same (positive or negative) polarity in both directions.

Certain high-performance applications involve four-quadrant loads (Quadrants I to IV) where the speed and torque can be in any direction such as in hoists, elevators, and hilly conveyors. Regeneration can occur only in the drive's DC link bus when inverter voltage is smaller in magnitude than the motor back-[[Electromotive force|EMF]] and inverter voltage and back-EMF are the same polarity.&lt;ref&gt;Energy Regeneration, slide 6&lt;/ref&gt;

In starting a motor, a VFD initially applies a low frequency and voltage, thus avoiding high inrush current associated with [[Motor controller|direct-on-line starting]]. After the start of the VFD, the applied frequency and voltage are increased at a controlled rate or ramped up to accelerate the load. This starting method typically allows a motor to develop 150% of its rated torque while the VFD is drawing less than 50% of its rated current from the mains in the low-speed range. A VFD can be adjusted to produce a steady 150% starting torque from standstill right up to full speed.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, pp. 95-102&lt;/ref&gt; However, motor cooling deteriorates and can result in overheating as speed decreases such that prolonged low-speed operation with significant torque is not usually possible without separately motorized fan ventilation.

With a VFD, the stopping sequence is just the opposite as the starting sequence. The frequency and voltage applied to the motor are ramped down at a controlled rate. When the frequency approaches zero, the motor is shut off. A small amount of braking torque is available to help decelerate the load a little faster than it would stop if the motor were simply switched off and allowed to coast. Additional braking torque can be obtained by adding a braking circuit (resistor controlled by a transistor) to dissipate the braking energy. With a four-quadrant rectifier (active front-end), the VFD is able to brake the load by applying a reverse torque and injecting the energy back to the AC line.

== Benefits ==

=== Energy savings ===
Many fixed-speed motor load applications that are supplied direct from AC line power can save energy when they are operated at variable speed by means of VFD. Such energy cost savings are especially pronounced in variable-torque centrifugal fan and pump applications, where the load's torque and power vary with the square and [[cube (algebra)|cube]], respectively, of the speed. This change gives a large power reduction compared to fixed-speed operation for a relatively small reduction in speed. For example, at 63% speed a motor load consumes only 25% of its full-speed power. This reduction is in accordance with [[affinity laws]] that define the relationship between various centrifugal load variables.

In the United States, an  estimated 60-65% of electrical energy is used to supply motors, 75% of which are  variable-torque fan, pump, and compressor loads.&lt;ref name="Bose (2009b)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bose|first=Bimal K.|title=The Past, Present, and Future of Power Electronics|journal=Industrial Electronics Magazine, IEEE|date=June 2009|volume=3|issue=2|page=9|doi=10.1109/MIE.2009.932709}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eighteen percent of the energy used in the 40 million motors in the U.S. could be saved by efficient energy improvement technologies such as VFDs.&lt;ref name="Spear (2005)"&gt;{{cite web|last=Spear|first=Mike|title=Adjustable Speed Drives: Drive Up Energy Efficiency|url=http://www.chemicalprocessing.com/articles/2005/489.html?page=1|publisher=ChemicalProcessing.com|accessdate=Jan 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bose (2009a)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bose|first=B.

Only about 3% of the total installed base of AC motors are provided with AC drives.&lt;ref name="TG4"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://library.e.abb.com/public/d3c711ec2acddb18c125788f002cf5da/ABB_Technical_guide_No_4_REVC.pdf|title=Guide to Variable Speed Drives - Technical Guide No. 4|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|accessdate=Jan 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is estimated that drive technology is adopted in as many as 30-40% of all newly installed motors.&lt;ref name="Motoring Ahead 1/11"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lendenmann|first=Heinz|title=Motoring Ahead|url=http://www.lead-central.com/AssetManager/02427e68-6f15-4f3a-9749-d37abf613741/Documents/APW2012/Low%20Voltage%20Drives%20Motors/ABB-136_WPO_Motoring%20ahead.pdf|accessdate=Apr 18, 2012|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Control performance===
AC drives are used to bring about process and quality improvements in industrial and commercial applications' acceleration, flow, monitoring, pressure, speed, temperature, tension, and torque.&lt;ref&gt;Basics of AC drives, p. Overview: slide 5 of 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Fixed-speed loads subject the motor to a high starting torque and to current surges that are up to eight times the full-load current. AC drives instead gradually ramp the motor up to operating speed to lessen mechanical and electrical stress, reducing maintenance and repair costs, and extending the life of the motor and the driven equipment.

Variable-speed drives can also run a motor in specialized patterns to further minimize mechanical and electrical stress. For example, an [[logistic function|S-curve pattern]] can be applied to a conveyor application for smoother deceleration and acceleration control, which reduces the backlash that can occur when a conveyor is accelerating or decelerating.

Performance factors tending to favor the use of DC drives over AC drives include such requirements as continuous operation at low speed, four-quadrant operation with regeneration, frequent acceleration and deceleration routines, and need for the motor to be protected for a hazardous area.&lt;ref name="ABB (DC vs. AC)"&gt;{{cite web|title=DC or AC Drives?

* '''Voltage-source inverter (VSI) drive topologies''' (see image):  In a VSI drive, the DC output of the [[diode]]-bridge converter stores energy in the capacitor bus to supply stiff voltage input to the inverter. The vast majority of drives are VSI type with PWM voltage output.{{efn|The term PWM is often used to mean VSI-PWM, which is misleading as not only VSI drives are with PWM output.}}
* '''Current-source inverter (CSI) drive topologies''' (see image): In a CSI drive, the DC output of the [[silicon controlled rectifier|SCR]]-bridge converter stores energy in series-[[Inductor]] connection to supply stiff current input to the inverter. CSI drives can be operated with either PWM or six-step waveform output.
* '''Six-step inverter drive topologies''' (see image):{{efn|The term six-step refers strictly speaking to an inverter waveform output alternative to PWM, some drives being configured as combined six-step and PWM options.}}&lt;ref name=McMurray&gt;{{cite journal|last=McMurray|first=William|title=Power Electronic Circuit Topology|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE|date=April 1988|volume=76|issue=4|pages=428–437|doi=10.1109/5.4428}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Now largely obsolete, six-step drives can be either VSI or CSI type and are also referred to as variable-voltage inverter drives, [[pulse-amplitude modulation]] (PAM) drives,&lt;ref name="Carrow (2000)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carrow|first=Robert S.|title=Electrician's Technical Reference: Variable Frequency Drives|year=2000|publisher=Delmar Thomson Learning|location=Albany, NY|isbn=0-7668-1923-X|pages=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[power inverter|square-wave]] drives or [[chopper (electronic)|D.C. chopper]] inverter drives.&lt;ref&gt;Drury, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;  In a six-step drive, the DC output of the SCR-bridge converter is smoothed via capacitor bus and series-reactor connection to supply via [[Darlington Pair]] or [[Insulated gate bipolar transistor|IGBT]] inverter quasi-sinusoidal, six-step voltage or current input to an induction motor.&lt;ref name="Williams (2003)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sandy, Williams|author2=Baillie, Alastair |author3=Shipp, David |title=Understanding VSDs with ESPs - A Practical Checklist|publisher=Society of Petroleum Engineers|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Cycloconverter or matrix converter (MC) topologies''' (see image):  [[Cycloconverter]]s and MCs are [[AC/AC converter|AC-AC converter]]s that have no intermediate DC link for energy storage. A cycloconverter operates as a three-phase current source via three anti-parallel-connected SCR-bridges in six-pulse configuration, each cycloconverter phase acting selectively to convert fixed line frequency AC voltage to an alternating voltage at a variable load frequency. MC drives are IGBT-based. 
* '''Doubly fed slip recovery system topologies''':  A [[doubly fed electric machine|doubly fed]] [[Induction motor#slip|slip]] recovery system feeds rectified slip power to a smoothing reactor to supply power to the AC supply network via an inverter, the speed of the motor being controlled by adjusting the DC current.

===Control platforms===
{{see also|Dqo transformation|Alpha–beta transformation}}
 
Most drives use one or more of the following control platforms:&lt;ref name=Morris/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drury, pp. 6-9&lt;/ref&gt;
* PWM V/Hz [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] control
* PWM [[field-oriented control]] (FOC) or vector control
* [[Direct torque control]] (DTC).

===Load torque and power characteristics===
Variable-frequency drives are also categorized by the following load torque and power characteristics:
* Variable torque, such as in centrifugal fan, pump, and blower applications
* Constant torque, such as in conveyor and positive-displacement pump applications
* Constant power, such as in machine tool and traction applications.

=== Available power ratings ===
VFDs are available with voltage and current ratings covering a wide range of single-phase and multi-phase AC motors. Low-voltage (LV) drives are designed to operate at output voltages equal to or less than 690&amp;nbsp;V. While motor-application LV drives are available in ratings of up to the order of 5&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;6 MW,&lt;ref name=ACS800Catalog&gt;{{cite journal | title = ACS800 Catalog - Single Drives 0.55 to 5600 kW| date =July 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; economic considerations typically favor medium-voltage (MV) drives with much lower power ratings.  Different MV drive topologies (see Table 2) are configured in accordance with the voltage/current-combination ratings used in different drive controllers' switching devices&lt;ref name="Wu05"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wu|first=Bin|title=High-Power Converters and AC Drives|url=http://www.ee.ryerson.ca/~bwu/seminars/pesc05_seminar.pdf|publisher=IEEE PES|year=2005|accessdate=Feb 3, 2012|page=slide 22}}&lt;/ref&gt; such that any given voltage rating is greater than or equal to one to the following standard nominal motor voltage ratings: generally either 2.3/4.16&amp;nbsp;kV (60&amp;nbsp;Hz) or 3.3/6.6&amp;nbsp;kV (50&amp;nbsp;Hz), with one thyristor manufacturer rated for up to 12&amp;nbsp;kV switching. In some applications a step-up [[transformer]] is placed between a LV drive and a MV motor load. MV drives are typically rated for motor applications  greater than between about 375&amp;nbsp;kW (500&amp;nbsp;HP) and 750&amp;nbsp;kW (1000&amp;nbsp;hp). MV drives have historically required considerably more application design effort than required for LV drive applications.&lt;ref name=BartosMV&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bartos | first =Frank J. | title =Medium-Voltage AC Drives Shed Custom Image  | journal =Control Engineering | publisher =Reed Business Information | date =Feb 1, 2000  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lockley (2008)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lockley|first=Bill |author2=Wood, Barry |author3=Paes, Richard |author4=DeWinter, Frank|title=Standard 1566 for (Un)Familiar Hands|journal=IEEE Industry Applications Magazine|date=Jan–Feb 2008|volume=14|issue=1|pages=21–28|doi=10.1109/MIA.2007.909800}}&lt;/ref&gt; The power rating of MV drives can reach 100&amp;nbsp;MW, a range of different drive topologies being involved for different rating, performance, power quality, and reliability requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, slide 159&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Klug (2005)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MVTopology"/&gt;

== Application considerations ==

=== AC line harmonics ===
Note of clarification:.{{efn|The harmonics treatment that follows is limited for simplication reasons to LV VSI-PWM drives.}}

While [[harmonics (electrical power)|harmonics]] in the PWM output can easily be filtered by carrier-frequency-related filter inductance to supply near-sinusoidal currents to the motor load,&lt;ref name="Bose 2006, p. 183"/&gt; the VFD's diode-bridge rectifier converts AC line voltage to DC voltage output by super-imposing [[nonlinear system|non-linear]] half-phase current pulses thus creating harmonic current distortion, and hence voltage distortion, of the AC line input. When the VFD loads are relatively small in comparison to the large, stiff power system available from the [[electric power company]], the effects of VFD harmonic distortion of the [[Electrical grid|AC grid]] can often be within acceptable limits. Furthermore, in low-voltage networks, harmonics caused by single-phase equipment such as computers and TVs are partially cancelled by three-phase diode bridge harmonics because their 5th and 7th harmonics are in counterphase.&lt;ref name="Hansen (2000)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Janssen|first=Hansen|author2=Neilsen, Peter |author3=Blaabjerg, Frede |title=Harmonic Cancellation by Mixing Non-Linear Single-Phase and Three-Phase Loads|journal=IEEE Trans. on Industry Applications|date=Jan–Dec 2000|volume=36|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the proportion of VFD and other non-linear load compared to total load or of non-linear load compared to the stiffness at the AC power supply, or both, is relatively large enough, the load can have a negative impact on the AC power waveform available to other power company customers in the same grid.

When the power company's voltage becomes distorted due to harmonics, losses in other loads such as normal fixed-speed AC motors are increased. This condition may lead to overheating and shorter operating life. Also, [[Electrical substation|substation]] transformers and compensation capacitors are affected negatively. In particular, capacitors can cause resonance conditions that can unacceptably magnify harmonic levels. In order to limit the voltage distortion, owners of VFD load may be required to install filtering equipment to reduce harmonic distortion below acceptable limits. Alternatively, the utility may adopt a solution by installing filtering equipment of its own at substations affected by the large amount of VFD equipment being used. In high-power installations, harmonic distortion can be reduced by supplying multi-pulse rectifier-bridge VFDs from transformers with multiple phase-shifted windings.&lt;ref name="Technical Guide No. 6"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Guide to Harmonics with AC Drives - Technical Guide No. 6| date =May 17, 2002 | url =http://www05.abb.com/global/scot/scot201.nsf/veritydisplay/6dff3290e5f2d651c125788d00393a58/$file/ABB_Technical%20guide%20No.6_REVC.pdf| accessdate =Jul 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also possible to replace the standard diode-bridge rectifier with a bi-directional IGBT switching device bridge mirroring the standard inverter which uses IGBT switching device output to the motor. Such rectifiers are referred to by various designations including active infeed converter (AIC), [[active rectification|active rectifier]], IGBT supply unit (ISU), active front end (AFE), or four-quadrant operation. With PWM control and a suitable input reactor, an AFE's AC line current waveform can be nearly sinusoidal. AFE inherently regenerates energy in four-quadrant mode from the DC side to the AC grid. Thus, no braking resistor is needed, and the efficiency of the drive is improved if the drive is frequently required to brake the motor.

Two other harmonics mitigation techniques exploit use of passive or active filters connected to a common bus with at least one VFD branch load on the bus. Passive filters involve the design of one or more [[low-pass filter|low-pass]] LC filter traps, each trap being tuned as required to a harmonic frequency (5th, 7th, 11th, 13th, . . . kq+/-1, where k=integer, q=pulse number of converter).&lt;ref name="IEEE 519"&gt;{{cite journal|title=IEEE Std 519 - IEEE Recommended Practices and Requirements for Harmonic Control in Electrical Power Systems|year=1992|doi=10.1109/IEEESTD.1993.114370|publisher=IEEE|isbn=978-0-7381-0915-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is very common practice for power companies or their customers to impose harmonic distortion limits based on [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] or [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] standards. For example, IEEE Standard 519 limits at the customer's connection point call for the maximum individual frequency voltage harmonic to be no more than 3% of the fundamental and call for the voltage [[total harmonic distortion]] (THD) to be no more than 5% for a general AC power supply system.&lt;ref&gt;IEEE 519, pp. 69-70&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switching frequency foldback===
One drive uses a default switching frequency setting of 4&amp;nbsp;kHz. Reducing the drive’s switching frequency (the carrier-frequency) reduces the heat generated by the [[IGBT]]s.&lt;ref&gt;https://library.e.abb.com/public/79c9b3a80f5edf728525773e007661d6/ACH550_PHPB01U_EN_REVC.pdf [[ABB]] ACH550 Switching Frequency Foldback&lt;/ref&gt;

A carrier frequency of at least ten times the desired output frequency is used to establish the PWM switching intervals. A carrier frequency in the range of 2,000 to 16,000&amp;nbsp;Hz is common for LV [low voltage, under 600 Volts AC] VFDs. A higher carrier frequency produces a better sine wave approximation but incurs higher switching losses in the IGBT, decreasing the overall power conversion efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;https://selinc.com/api/download/21474837051/ Challenges and Solutions of Protecting Variable Speed Drive Motors | Angelo D’Aversa, Bob Hughes, and Subhash Patel | Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories, Inc. | Page 3, Column 1, next to last paragraph&lt;/ref&gt;

===Noise smoothing===
Some drives have a noise smoothing feature that can be turned on to introduce a random variation to the switching frequency. This distributes the acoustic noise over a range of frequencies to lower the peak noise intensity.

===Long-lead effects===
The carrier-frequency pulsed output voltage of a PWM VFD causes rapid rise times in these pulses, the transmission line effects of which must be considered. Since the transmission-line [[impedance (electrical)|impedance]] of the cable and motor are different, pulses tend to reflect back from the motor terminals into the cable. The resulting reflections can produce [[overvoltage]]s equal to twice the DC bus voltage or up to 3.1&amp;nbsp;times the rated line voltage for long cable runs, putting high stress on the cable and motor windings, and eventual insulation failure.  Insulation  standards for three-phase motors rated 230&amp;nbsp;V or less adequately protect against such long-lead overvoltages.  On 460&amp;nbsp;V or 575&amp;nbsp;V systems and inverters with 3rd-generation 0.1-microsecond-rise-time IGBTs, the maximum recommended cable distance between VFD and motor is about 50&amp;nbsp;m or 150&amp;nbsp;feet. For emerging SiC MOSFET powered drives, significant overvoltages have been observed at cable lengths as short as 3 meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dvdtfilter.com/dv-dt-simulation-scenario-1-sic-drive/|title=dv/dt Simulation Scenario 1: SiC Drive - dv/dt Simulation and Mitigation|date=2018-08-16|work=dv/dt Simulation and Mitigation|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solutions to overvoltages caused by long lead lengths include minimizing cable length, lowering carrier frequency, installing dV/dt filters, using inverter-duty-rated motors (that are rated 600&amp;nbsp;V to withstand pulse trains with rise time less than or equal to 0.1&amp;nbsp;microsecond, of 1,600&amp;nbsp;V peak magnitude), and installing LCR low-pass sine wave filters.&lt;ref&gt;Skibinski, p. 274&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Novak (2009)"&gt;{{cite web|last=Novak|first=Peter|title=The Basics of Variable-Frequency Drives|url=http://ecmweb.com/power_quality/variable-frequency-drives-20090501/|publisher=EC&amp;M|accessdate=Apr 18, 2012|date=May 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Finlayson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Finlayson|first=P.T.|title=Output filters for PWM drives with induction motors|date=Jan–Feb 1998|volume=4|issue=1|pages=46–52|journal=IEEE Industry Applications Magazine|doi=10.1109/2943.644886}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dvdtfilter.com/motor-voltage-waveform-simulation/|title=Motor Voltage Waveform Simulation - dv/dt Simulation and Mitigation|work=dv/dt Simulation and Mitigation|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Selection of optimum PWM carrier frequency for AC&amp;nbsp;drives involves balancing noise, heat, motor insulation stress, common-mode voltage-induced motor bearing current damage, smooth motor operation, and other factors.

===Motor bearing currents===
{{main|Shaft voltage}}

Carrier frequencies above 5&amp;nbsp;kHz are likely to cause bearing damage unless protective measures are taken.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy13osti/56011.pdf Minimize Adverse Motor and Adjustable Speed Drive Interactions | Advanced Manufacturing Office Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy | U.S. Department of Energy]&lt;/ref&gt;

PWM drives are inherently associated with high-frequency common-mode voltages and currents which may cause trouble with motor bearings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.plantservices.com/articles/2007/022.html|pages=1–2| title=Bearings and Electricity Don't Match|year=2007|journal=PlantServices.com [Plant Services]|publisher=PtmanMedia|last=Yung|first=Chuck|location=Itasca, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt; When these high-frequency voltages find a path to earth through a bearing, transfer of metal or [[electrical discharge machining]] (EDM) sparking occurs between the bearing's ball and the bearing's race. Over time, EDM-based sparking causes erosion in the bearing race that can be seen as a fluting pattern. In large motors, the [[stray capacitance]] of the windings provides paths for high-frequency currents that pass through the motor shaft ends, leading to a circulating type of bearing current.  Poor [[Ground (electricity)|grounding]] of motor stators can lead to shaft-to-ground bearing currents. Small motors with poorly grounded driven equipment are susceptible to high-frequency bearing currents.&lt;ref name="Technical Guide No. 5"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Bearing Currents in Modern AC Drive Systems - Technical Guide No. 5| date =Dec 1, 1999 | url =http://www05.abb.com/global/scot/scot201.nsf/veritydisplay/8c253c2417ed0238c125788f003cca8e/$file/abb_technical_guide_no5_revc.pdf | accessdate =June 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prevention of high-frequency bearing current damage uses three approaches: good cabling and grounding practices, interruption of bearing currents, and filtering or damping of common-mode currents for example through soft magnetic cores, the so-called inductive absorbers. Good cabling and grounding practices can include use of shielded, symmetrical-geometry power cable to supply the motor, installation of shaft grounding brushes, and conductive bearing grease.  Bearing currents can be interrupted by installation of insulated bearings and specially designed electrostatic-shielded induction motors.  Filtering and damping high-frequency bearing can be done though inserting soft magnetic cores over the three phases giving a high frequency impedance against the common mode or motor bearing currents.  Another approach is to use instead of standard 2-level inverter drives, using either 3-level inverter drives or matrix converters.&lt;ref name="Technical Guide No. 5"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Swamy&gt;{{cite conference|booktitle=Proceedings of 11th International Conference on Optimization of Electrical and Electronic Equipment, 2008 (OPTIM 2008)|last=Swamy|first=M.|author2=Kume, T. |title=Present State and a Futuristic Vision of Motor Drive Technology|date=May 2008|pages=XLV–LVI, Fig. 16|publisher=IEEE|doi=10.1109/OPTIM.2008.4602333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since inverter-fed motor cables' high-frequency current spikes can interfere with other cabling in facilities, such inverter-fed motor cables should not only be of shielded, symmetrical-geometry design but should also be routed at least 50&amp;nbsp;cm away from signal cables.&lt;ref name="Technical Guide No. 3"&gt;{{cite journal | title = EMC Compliant Installation and Configuration for a Power Drive System - Technical Guide No. 3| date =Apr 11, 2008 | url =http://te-dep-epc.web.cern.ch/te-dep-epc/Infos/Conferences/EMC%20Workshop/ABBTechnicalGuideEMC.pdf| accessdate =Jul 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dynamic braking===
{{see also|Dynamic braking|Regenerative braking}}
Torque generated by the drive causes the induction motor to run at [[Synchronization (alternating current)|synchronous]] speed less the slip. If the load drives the motor faster than synchronous speed, the motor acts as a [[Electric generator|generator]], converting mechanical power back to electrical power. This power is returned to the drive's DC link element (capacitor or reactor). A DC-link-connected electronic power switch or [[braking chopper|braking DC chopper]] controls dissipation of this power as heat in a set of resistors. Cooling fans may be used to prevent resistor overheating.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Dynamic braking wastes braking energy by transforming it to heat. By contrast, regenerative drives recover braking energy by injecting this energy into the AC line. The capital cost of regenerative drives is, however, relatively high.&lt;ref&gt;Technical Guide No. 8, pp. 26-30&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regenerative drives===
[[File:KIMO TRA U2 mL Gruppe.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Line regenerative variable frequency drives, showing capacitors (top cylinders) and inductors attached, which filter the regenerated power.]]
[[File:2010 Prius Regeneration.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Simplified Drive Schematic for a Popular EHV&lt;ref name="Olszewski (2011)"&gt;{{cite web|last=Olszewski|first=Mitch|title=Evaluation of 2010 Toyota Prius Hybrid Electric Drive System|url=http://ecee.colorado.edu/~ecen5017/notes/OakRidge_2010Prius.pdf|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|accessdate=26 September 2012|year=2011|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Regenerative AC drives have the capacity to recover the braking energy of a load moving faster than the designated motor speed (an ''overhauling'' load) and return it to the power system.

Cycloconverter, Scherbius, matrix, CSI, and LCI drives inherently allow return of energy from the load to the line, while voltage-source inverters require an additional converter to return energy to the supply.&lt;ref name="Dubey"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dubey|first=Gopal K.|title=Fundamentals of Electrical Drives|year=2001|publisher=Alpha Science Int.|location=Pangbourne|isbn=1-84265-083-1|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rashid, p. 902, Table 33.13&lt;/ref&gt;

Regeneration is useful in VFDs only where the value of the recovered energy is large compared to the extra cost of a regenerative system,&lt;ref name="Dubey"/&gt; and if the system requires frequent braking and starting. Regenerative VFDs are widely used where speed control of overhauling loads is required.&lt;ref name=Jaeschke/&gt;&lt;ref name=Siskind/&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, pp. 70–190&lt;/ref&gt;

Some examples:
* Conveyor belt drives for manufacturing, which stop every few minutes. While stopped, parts are assembled correctly; once that is done, the belt moves on. 
* A crane, where the hoist motor stops and reverses frequently, and braking is required to slow the load during lowering.
* Plug-in and hybrid electric vehicles of all types (see image and [[Hybrid Synergy Drive]]).

==Historical systems==
Before solid-state devices became available, variable-frequency drives used rotary machines and the [[General Electric Company]] obtained several patents for these in the early 20th century. One example is US patent 949320 of 1910 which states: "Such a generator finds a useful application in supplying current to induction motors for driving cars, locomotives, or other mechanism which are to be driven at variable speeds".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Faccioli|first1=Giuseppe|title=Variable-frequency generator|url=https://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?CC=US&amp;NR=949320A&amp;KC=A&amp;FT=D&amp;ND=3&amp;date=19100215&amp;DB=EPODOC&amp;locale=en_EP#|website=Espacenet|publisher=Espacenet|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another is British patent 7061 of 1911 by [[Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brown Boveri &amp; Cie|title=Improvements in and relating to variable frequency commutator dynamo-electric machines|url=https://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?CC=GB&amp;NR=191107061A&amp;KC=A&amp;FT=D&amp;ND=3&amp;date=19110928&amp;DB=&amp;locale=en_EP#|website=Espacenet|publisher=Espacenet|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44365">'''Vertically aligned carbon nanotube arrays''' ('''VANTAs''') are a unique microstructure consisting of [[carbon nanotubes]] oriented along their longitudinal axes normal to a substrate surface.  These VANTAs effectively preserve and often accentuate the unique anisotropic properties of individual carbon nanotubes and possess a morphology that may be precisely controlled.  VANTAs are consequently widely useful in a range of current and potential device applications.&lt;ref name="Chen et al., 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=Hao|last2=Roy|first2=Ajit|last3=Baek|first3=Jong-Beom|last4=Zhu|first4=Lin|last5=Qu|first5=Jia|last6=Dai|first6=Liming|title=Controlled growth and modification of vertically-aligned carbon nanotubes for multifunctional applications|journal=Materials Science and Engineering: R: Reports|date=22 November 2010|volume=70|issue=3–6|pages=63–91|doi=10.1016/j.mser.2010.06.003|url=http://doi.org/10.1016/j.mser.2010.06.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synthesis ==
There are a handful of experimental technologies available to align a single or an array of CNTs along a pre-determined orientation. The techniques rely on different mechanisms and therefore are applicable to different situations. These techniques are categorized into two groups pertaining to when the alignment is achieved: (a) in-situ techniques where alignment is achieved during the CNT growth process and (b) ex-situ techniques where CNTs are originally grown in random orientations and alignment is achieved afterwards such as during the device integration process.

=== Thermal chemical vapor deposition ===

==== Growth mechanism ====

Thermal [[chemical vapor deposition]] is a common technique to grow aligned arrays of CNTs.  In the CVD process, a hot carbonaceous gas decomposes, *leaving carbon to diffuses into or around the [[catalyst]] particles*, and then nucleates a graphitic nanotube sidewall at one crystallographic face of the catalyst.  The catalyst diameter directly controls the diameter of the nanotubes that are grown.  There are two primary growth models for the CVD growth of VANTAs: “tip-growth model” and the “base-growth model.”&lt;ref name="Yellampalli, 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yellampalli|title=Carbon Nanotubes-Synthesis, Characterization, Applications|journal=INTECH|date=2011|pages=148–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In the case of the tip-growth model, hydrocarbon decomposes on the top surface of the metal, carbon diffuses down through the metal, and CNT precipitates out across the metal bottom, pushing the whole metal particle off the substrate, and continues to grow until the metal is fully covered with excess carbon and its catalytic activity ceases.  In the case of the base-growth model, the initial hydrocarbon decomposition and carbon diffusion take place similar to that in the tip-growth case, but the CNT precipitation emerges out from the metal particle’s apex and forms a hemispherical dome, which then extends up in the form of seamless graphitic cylinder. Subsequent hydrocarbon decomposition takes place on the lower peripheral surface of the metal, and as-dissolved carbon diffuses upward. Most thermal CVD processes grow nanotubes by the root or base growth method.  The morphology of both the individual CNTs and the CNT array is dictated by various CVD growth parameters, which may be tuned to yield vertically aligned arrays of CNTs with various structures.

==== Catalyst ====

The catalyst enables the [[pyrolysis]] of carbon and subsequent growth of VANTA.  Catalysts are typically metals that have high carbon solubility at high temperatures and that exhibit a high carbon diffusion rate, such as [[iron]] (Fe), [[cobalt]] (Co), and [[nickel]] (Ni).  Other transition metals such as [[copper]] (Cu), [[gold]] (Au), [[silver]] (Ag), [[platinum]] (Pt), and [[palladium]] (Pd) are also reported to catalyze CNT growth from various hydrocarbons but have lower carbon solubility and consequently lower growth rates. Solid organometallocenes such as [[ferrocene]], cobaltocene, nickelocene are also common catalysts. It is found that the temperature and time of the thermal and reduction catalyst pre-treatment steps are crucial variables for optimized nanoparticle distribution with different average diameters, depending on the initial film thickness.&lt;ref name="Terrado et al., 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Terrado|first1=E.|last2=Tacchini|first2=I.|last3=Benito|first3=A. M.|last4=Maser|first4=W. K.|last5=Martínez|first5=M. T.|title=Optimizing catalyst nanoparticle distribution to produce densely-packed carbon nanotube growth|journal=Carbon|date=1 July 2009|volume=47|issue=8|pages=1989–2001|doi=10.1016/j.carbon.2009.03.045|url=http://doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2009.03.045}}&lt;/ref&gt;   For CNT growth by CVD, a sputtered thin film of catalyst (e.g. 1&amp;nbsp;nm of Fe) is applied.  During heating, the film de-wets, creating islands of iron that then nucleate nanotubes. As the iron is mobile, islands can merge if left too long at the growth temperature before initiating nanotube growth.  Annealing at the growth temperature reduces the site density #/mm2 and increases the diameter of the nanotubes.  As the nanotubes grow from the catalyst islands, the crowding effects and [[van der Waals forces]] between other CNTs leave them no choice to grow in any direction but vertically to the substrate.

The height of vertically aligned CNTs varies with catalyst particle spacing as well.  Reports have indicated that for vertically aligned arrays of CNT bundles, the CNTs grow longer when there are other CNTs growing near them, indicated by longer CNTs grown on larger catalyst particles or when catalyst particles are spaced close together.&lt;ref name="Bronikowski, 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bronikowski|first1=Michael J.|title=CVD growth of carbon nanotube bundle arrays|journal=Carbon|date=1 November 2006|volume=44|issue=13|pages=2822–2832|doi=10.1016/j.carbon.2006.03.022|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0008622306001667}}&lt;/ref&gt; Choi et al. reported good morphology and dense distribution of VANTAs grown from Ni nano powders and magnetic fluids mixed in polyvinyl alcohol spin-coated on Si and alumina.&lt;ref name="Choi et al., 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Choi|first1=G.

It has also been demonstrated that applying a monolayer of Mo with a Co catalyst suppressed the broadening of the SWNT diameter distribution in the as-grown VANTA, while both the composition and amount of Co and Mo affected the catalytic activity.

==== Support ====
The substrate material, its surface morphology and textural properties greatly affect the resulting VANTA yield.   Some examples of commonly used substrates in CVD are [[quartz]], silicon, silicon carbide, silica, alumina, [[zeolite]], CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and magnesium oxide. Most substrates are coated with an underlayer consisting of 10-20&amp;nbsp;nm of alumina before depositing the catalyst.  This regularizes the dewetting of the catalyst into islands of predictable size, and is a diffusion barrier between the substrate and the metal catalyst.
Li et al. have produced VANTA consisting of Y- shaped carbon nanotubes by the pyrolysis of methane over cobalt- covered magnesium oxide catalyst on branched nanochannel alumina templates.&lt;ref name="Li et al., 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=Jing|last2=Papadopoulos|first2=Chris|last3=Xu|first3=Jimmy|title=Nanoelectronics: Growing Y-junction carbon nanotubes|journal=Nature|date=18 November 1999|volume=402|issue=6759|pages=253–254|doi=10.1038/46214|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v402/n6759/full/402253b0.html|language=en|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alvarez et al. reports the ability to spin-coat an alumoxane solution as a catalyst support for VANTA growths via CVD.

==== Carbon source ====
The carbon source for the CVD of VANTAs is most commonly a carbon gas such as [[methane]], [[ethylene]], [[acetylene]], [[benzene]], [[xylene]], or [[carbon monoxide]].  Other examples of carbon precursors include cyclohexane, fullerene, methanol, and ethanol.  The pyrolysis of these gases into carbon atoms varies based on the decomposition rate at growth temperatures, the carbon content of the gas molecules, and the growth catalyst.   Linear hydrocarbons such as methane, ethylene, acetylene, thermally decompose into atomic carbons or linear dimers/trimers of carbon, and generally produce straight and hollow CNTs. On the other hand, cyclic hydrocarbons such as benzene, xylene, cyclohexane, fullerene, produce relatively curved/hunched CNTs with the tube walls often bridged inside. 
Aligned arrays of MWNTs have been synthesized through the catalytic decomposition of ferrocene-xylene precursor mixture onto quartz substrates at atmospheric pressure and relatively low temperature (~675&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref name="Andrews et al., 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Andrews|first1=R.|last2=Jacques|first2=D.|last3=Rao|first3=A.

Eres et al. found that the addition of ferrocene into the gas stream by thermal evaporation concurrently with acetylene enhanced carbon nanotube growth rates and extend the VANTA thickness to 3.25&amp;nbsp;mm. Ferrocene was introduced into the gas stream by thermal evaporation concurrently with the flow of acetylene.&lt;ref name="Eres et al., 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eres|first1=Gyula|last2=Puretzky|first2=A.

Qu et al. reported a low-pressure CVD process on a SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Si wafer that produces a VANTA  consisting of CNTs with curly entangled ends.  During the pyrolytic growth of the VANTAs, the initially formed nanotube segments from the base growth process grew in random directions and formed a randomly entangled nanotube top layer to which the underlying straight nanotube arrays then emerged.
Zhong et al. studied purely thermal CVD process for SWNT forests without an etchant gas, and demonstrated that acteylene is the main growth precursor, and the conversion of any feedstock to C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is of key importance to SWNT VANTA growth.&lt;ref name="Zhong et al., 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhong|first1=G.|last2=Hofmann|first2=S.|last3=Yan|first3=F.|last4=Telg|first4=H.|last5=Warner|first5=J.

==== Temperature ====
At a too low temperature, the catalyst atoms are not mobile enough to aggregate together into particles to nucleate and grow nanotubes and the catalytic decomposition of the carbon precursor may be too slow for the formation of nanotubes. If the temperature is too high, the catalyst becomes too mobile to form particles small enough to nucleate and grow CNTs.  A typical range of growth temperatures amenable to the CVD growth of VANTA is 600-1200&amp;nbsp;°C.  The individual CNT structure is impacted by the growth temperature; a low-temperature CVD (600–900&amp;nbsp;°C) yields MWCNTs, whereas high-temperature (900–1200&amp;nbsp;°C) reaction favors SWCNT since they have a higher energy of formation.  A critical temperature exists for each CVD system where the growth rate plateaus at a maximum value.&lt;ref name="Vinten et al., 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vinten|first1=P.|last2=Lefebvre|first2=J.|last3=Finnie|first3=P.|title=Kinetic critical temperature and optimized chemical vapor deposition growth of carbon nanotubes|journal=Chemical Physics Letters|date=17 February 2009|volume=469|issue=4–6|pages=293–297|doi=10.1016/j.cplett.2008.12.095|url=http://doi.org/10.1016/j.cplett.2008.12.095}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The temperature dependence of the carbon nanotube growth with ferrocene exhibits a steep drop at high substrate temperatures and a loss of vertical alignment at 900&amp;nbsp;°C.
Zhang et al. conducted VANTA growths on a series of Fe/Mo/vermiculite catalysts and reported that with the increasing growth temperature, the alignment of CNTs intercalated among vermiculites became worse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=Qiang|last2=Zhao|first2=Meng-Qiang|last3=Huang|first3=Jia-Qi|last4=Nie|first4=Jing-Qi|last5=Wei|first5=Fei|title=Mass production of aligned carbon nanotube arrays by fluidized bed catalytic chemical vapor deposition|journal=Carbon|date=1 April 2010|volume=48|issue=4|pages=1196–1209|doi=10.1016/j.carbon.2009.11.043|url=http://doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2009.11.043}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Flow assisted growth ====
A key to high growth yields is a proper introduction of oxidative agents under the gas ambient so that the catalyst particle surfaces remain active for the longest possible period, which is presumably achieved by balancing the competition between amorphous carbon growth and sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; graphitic crystal formation on the catalyst particles. Oxidants can not only remove or prevent amorphous carbon growth, but may also etch into graphite layers when used at higher than favorable concentrations.  Hata et al. reported millimeter-scale vertically aligned 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm long SWCNTs using the water assisted ethylene CVD process with Fe/Al or aluminum oxide multilayers on Si wafers.&lt;ref name="Hata et al., 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hata|first1=Kenji|last2=Futaba|first2=Don N.|last3=Mizuno|first3=Kohei|last4=Namai|first4=Tatsunori|last5=Yumura|first5=Motoo|last6=Iijima|first6=Sumio|title=Water-Assisted Highly Efficient Synthesis of Impurity-Free Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes|journal=Science|date=1 January 2004|volume=306|issue=5700|pages=1362–1364|jstor=3839597|doi=10.1126/science.1104962|pmid=15550668}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was proposed that controlled supply of steam into the CVD reactor acted as a weak oxidizer and selectively removed amorphous carbon without damaging the growing CNTs.

==== Field-assisted growth ====
Since CNTs are all electrically conductive they have a tendency to align with the electric field lines.  Various methods have been developed to apply a strong enough electric field during the CNT growth process to achieve uniform alignment of CNTs based on this principle.  The orientation of the aligned CNTs is mainly dependent on the length of CNTs and the electric field besides the thermal randomization and van der Waals forces. This technique has been employed to grow VANTAs by positively biasing the substrate during CVD growth.&lt;ref name="Avigal et al., 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Avigal|first1=Y.|last2=Kalish|first2=R.|title=Growth of aligned carbon nanotubes by biasing during growth|journal=Applied Physics Letters|date=16 April 2001|volume=78|issue=16|pages=2291–2293|doi=10.1063/1.1365409|url=http://doi.org/10.1063/1.1365409|issn=0003-6951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another modified approach to grow VANTAs is to control the orientation of ferromagnetic catalysts that have one crystallographic magnetic easy axis. The magnetic easy axis tends to be parallel to the magnetic field. As a result, an applied magnetic force can orient these magnetic catalytic nanoparticles, like catalytic iron nanoparticles and Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles. Because only a certain nanocrystalline facet of catalytic nanoparticles is catalytically active and the diffusion rate of carbon atoms on the facet is the highest, the CNTs preferentially grow from the certain facet of the catalytic nanoparticles and the grown CNTs are oriented at a certain angle.

=== Plasma enhanced CVD ===

==== Growth mechanism ====
In [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] enhanced CVD ([[PECVD]]) processes, DC electric fields, radio-frequency electric fields, or [[microwaves]] produce plasmas to primarily lower the synthesis temperature of CNTs. At the same time, an electric field (DC or AC) is also produced over the substrate surface to direct CNT growth propagation.  The DC-PECVD process for vertically aligned CNT arrays includes four basic steps: evacuation, heating, plasma generation, and cooling. A typical procedure is conducted at a pressure of 8 Torr in NH3 and at a growth temperature in the range of 450–600 ◦. As soon as the temperature and pressure are stabilized, a DC bias voltage of 450–650V is applied to the gap between two electrodes to ignite an electrical discharge (plasma) over the sample. The growth time may vary from a couple of minutes to hours depending on the growth rate and desired CNT length. When the end of growth time is reached, the bias voltage is removed immediately to terminate the plasma.

Zhong et al. reported a novel point-arc microwave plasma CVD apparatus employed to SWNTs on Si substrates coated with a sandwich-like nano-layer structure of 0.7&amp;nbsp;nm Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/0.5&amp;nbsp;nm Fe/ 5–70&amp;nbsp;nm Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; by conventional high frequency sputtering.&lt;ref name="Zhong et al., 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhong|first1=Guofang|last2=Iwasaki|first2=Takayuki|last3=Honda|first3=Kotaro|last4=Furukawa|first4=Yukio|last5=Ohdomari|first5=Iwao|last6=Kawarada|first6=Hiroshi|title=Low Temperature Synthesis of Extremely Dense and Vertically Aligned Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes|journal=Japanese Journal of Applied Physics|date=8 April 2005|volume=44|issue=4A|pages=1558–1561|doi=10.1143/jjap.44.1558|url=http://doi.org/10.1143/JJAP.44.1558|language=en|issn=1347-4065}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The growth of extremely dense and vertically aligned SWNTs with an almost constant growth rate of 270&amp;nbsp;mm/h within 40 min at a temperature as low as 600&amp;nbsp;°C was demonstrated for the first time and the volume density of the as-grown SWNT films is as higher as 66&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

==== Catalyst ====
The formation of a dense and relatively uniform layer of catalyst nanoparticles is also essential for vertically aligned SWCNT growth vertically aligned SWCNTs using the PECVD method.   Amaratunga et al. reported the growth of vertically aligned CNTs using a direct current PECVD technique with a Ni and Co catalyst system. Their results show that the alignment of vertically aligned CNTs depends on the electric field and that the growth rate can be changed depending on the CNT diameter, which reaches a maximum as a function of growth temperature. VANTAs consisting of SWNTs have been grown as long as 0.5&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref name="Iwasaki et al., 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Iwasaki|first1=Takayuki|last2=Robertson|first2=John|last3=Kawarada|first3=Hiroshi|title=Growth Kinetics of 0.5 cm Vertically Aligned Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes|journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry B|date=6 February 2007|volume=111|issue=8|pages=1907–1910|doi=10.1021/jp067776s|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jp067776s|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Zhong et al. reported a novel point-arc microwave plasma CVD apparatus employed to SWNTs on Si substrates coated with a sandwich-like nano-layer structure of 0.7&amp;nbsp;nm Al2O3/0.5&amp;nbsp;nm Fe/ 5–70&amp;nbsp;nm Al{{sub|2}}O{{sub|3}} by conventional high frequency sputtering.&lt;ref name="Zhong et al., 2005"/&gt;  The growth of extremely dense and vertically aligned SWNTs with an almost constant growth rate of 270&amp;nbsp;mm/h within 40 min at a temperature as low as 600&amp;nbsp;°C was demonstrated for the first time and the volume density of the as-grown SWNT films is as higher as 66&amp;nbsp;kg/m{{sup|3}}.

==== Support ====
For PECVD processes, the substrate must be chemically stable under the plasma which is rich of H-species. Some weakly bonded oxides such as indium oxide can be quickly reduced in this plasma and is therefore usually not applicable as the substrate or underlayer. The substrate must also be electrically conductive to sustain a continuous DC current flow through its surface where the CNTs grow from. Most metals and semiconductors are very good substrate materials, and insulating substrates can be first coated with a conductive layer to work properly to support PECVD VANTA growth.

==== Carbon source ====
C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is typically introduced to trigger the CNT growth during PECVD of VANTAs. The flow rate ratio of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;:C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is usually around 4:1 to minimize the amorphous carbon formation.  Behr et al. studied the effect of hydrogen on the catalyst nanoparticles during the PECVD of VANTAs, and demonstrated that at H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ratios of about 1 iron catalyst nanoparticles are converted to Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C and well-graphitized nanotubes grow from elongated Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C crystals. H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ratios greater than 5 in the feed gas result in high hydrogen concentrations in the plasma and strongly reducing conditions, which prevents the conversion of Fe to Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C and cause poorly-graphitized nanofibers to grow with thick walls.&lt;ref name="Behr et al., 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Behr|first1=Michael J.|last2=Gaulding|first2=E. Ashley|last3=Mkhoyan|first3=K. Andre|last4=Aydil|first4=Eray S.|title=Effect of hydrogen on catalyst nanoparticles in carbon nanotube growth|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|date=1 September 2010|volume=108|issue=5|pages=053303|doi=10.1063/1.3467971|url=http://doi.org/10.1063/1.3467971|issn=0021-8979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Temperature ====
One of the major advantages of using PECVD growth techniques is the low growth temperature. The ionization of the neutral hydrocarbon molecules inside the plasma facilitates the breaking of the C–H bonds and lowers the activation energy of the CNT growth to be about 0.3eV as opposed to the 1.2eV needed for thermal CVD processes.

=== Electrophoretic deposition ===
CNT solutions can form VANTAs through alignment along DC or AC electric field lines. The CNTs are polarized in the suspension by the electric field because of [[dielectric]] mismatch between CNTs and the liquid. The polarization moment rotates the CNTs toward the direction of electric field lines, therefore aligning them in a common direction. After being aligned, the CNTs are taken out with the substrates and dried to form functional VANTAs.

=== Mechanical strain ===
Randomly oriented CNTs on a substrate can be stretched to straighten and detangle the film by breaking the substrate and pulling the ends apart.  The aligned CNTs are parallel to each other and perpendicular to the crack. The stretching method can macroscopically align the CNTs while not providing deterministic control over individual CNT alignment or position during assembly.

== Current applications ==

=== Field-emission devices ===
CNTs have high aspect ratios (length divided by diameter) and induce very high local electric field intensities around the tips. Field emission in solids occurs in intense electric fields and is strongly dependent on the work function of the emitting material. In a parallel-plate arrangement, the macroscopic field Emacro between the plates is given by E&lt;sub&gt;macro&lt;/sub&gt; = V/d, where d is the plate separation and V the applied voltage. If a sharp object is created on a plate, then the local field Elocal at its apex is greater than Emacro and can be related to:
E&lt;sub&gt;local&lt;/sub&gt;=γ×E&lt;sub&gt;macro&lt;/sub&gt; 
The parameter γ is called the field-enhancement factor and basically determined by the shape of the object.  Typical field-enhancement factors ranging from 30,000 to 50,000 can be obtained from individual CNTs, therefore making VANTAs one of the best electron-emitting materials.

=== [[Blackbody]] absorber ===
{{main|Vantablack}}

VANTAs offer a unique light absorbing surface due to their extremely low [[index of refraction]] and the nanoscale surface roughness of the aligned CNTs.  Yang et al. demonstrated that low-density VANTAs exhibit an ultralow [[diffuse]] reflectance of 1 × 10-7 with a corresponding integrated total [[reflectance]] of 0.045%.&lt;ref name="Yang et al., 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yang|first1=Zu-Po|last2=Ci|first2=Lijie|last3=Bur|first3=James A.|last4=Lin|first4=Shawn-Yu|last5=Ajayan|first5=Pulickel M.|title=Experimental Observation of an Extremely Dark Material Made By a Low-Density Nanotube Array|journal=Nano Letters|date=9 January 2008|volume=8|issue=2|pages=446–451|doi=10.1021/nl072369t|url=http://doi.org/10.1021/nl072369t|language=en|pmid=18181658}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Although VANTA black coatings must be directly transferred or grown on substrates, unlike black coatings consisting of random networks of CNTs that may be processed into [[CNT paints]], they are the considered the blackest man-made material on earth.

VANTA blackbody absorbers are thus useful as stray light absorbers to improve the resolution of sensitive spectroscopes, [[telescopes]], [[microscopes]], and optical sensing devices.   Several commercial optical black coating products such as [[Vantablack]] and adVANTA nanotube optical blacks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nano-lab.com/opblco.html|title=adVANTA Black|publisher=Nano Lab|accessdate=15 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been produced from VANTA coatings.  VANTA absorbers may also increase the absorption of heat in materials used in concentrated solar power technology, as well as military applications such as thermal camouflage.  Visual displays of VANTA absorbers have generated interest by artists as well seeking to benefit from the quenching of shadows from rough surface.

=== Carbon fiber ropes ===
VANTAs can be processed through volatile solutions or twisted to condense into spun CNT yarns or ropes.  Jiang et al demonstrated a spinning and twisting method that forms a CNT yarn from a VANTA that gives rise to both a round cross-section and a tensile strength of around 1 GPa.&lt;ref name="Jiang et al., 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jiang|first1=Kaili|last2=Wang|first2=Jiaping|last3=Li|first3=Qunqing|last4=Liu|first4=Liang|last5=Liu|first5=Changhong|last6=Fan|first6=Shoushan|title=Superaligned Carbon Nanotube Arrays, Films, and Yarns: A Road to Applications|journal=Advanced Materials|date=4 March 2011|volume=23|issue=9|pages=1154–1161|doi=10.1002/adma.201003989|url=http://doi.org/10.1002/adma.201003989|language=en|issn=1521-4095}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The tensile strengths of CNT yarns spun from ultra-long CNT arrays of 1&amp;nbsp;mm height can range from 1.35 to 3.3 GPa.

=== Adhesive films ===
[[Biomimicry]] studies directed towards replicating the adhesion of gecko feet on smooth surfaces have reported success utilizing VANTA as a [[dry adhesive film]].  Qu et al. was able to demonstrate VANTA films that exhibited macroscopic adhesive forces of ~100 newtons per square centimeter, which is almost 10 times that of a gecko foot.&lt;ref name="Qu et al., 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Qu|first1=Liangti|last2=Dai|first2=Liming|last3=Stone|first3=Morley|last4=Xia|first4=Zhenhai|last5=Wang|first5=Zhong Lin|title=Carbon nanotube arrays with strong shear binding-on and easy normal lifting-off|journal=Science|date=10 October 2008|volume=322|issue=5899|pages=238–242|doi=10.1126/science.1159503|pmid=18845750|issn=1095-9203}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This was achieved by tuning the growth conditions of the VANTA to form curls at the end of the CNTs, which provide stronger interfacial interactions even with a smooth surface.

=== Gas sensor ===
VANTAs allow the development of novel sensors and/or sensor chips without the need for direct manipulation of individual nanotubes.&lt;ref name="Wei et al., 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wei|first1=Chen|last2=Dai|first2=Liming|last3=Roy|first3=Ajit|last4=Tolle|first4=Tia Benson|title=Multifunctional Chemical Vapor Sensors of Aligned Carbon Nanotube and Polymer Composites|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|date=13 January 2006|volume=128|issue=5|pages=1412–1413|doi=10.1021/ja0570335|url=http://doi.org/10.1021/ja0570335|language=en|pmid=16448087}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aligned nanotube structure further provides a large well-defined surface area and the capacity for modifying the carbon nanotube surface with various transduction materials to effectively enhance the sensitivity and to broaden the scope of analytes to be detected. Wei et al. reported a gas sensor fabricated by partially covering a VANTA with a polymer coating top-down along their tube length by depositing a droplet of polymer solution (e.g., poly(vinyl acetate), PVAc, polyisoprene, PI) onto the nanotube film, inverting the composite film as a free-standing film , and then sputter-coating two strip electrodes of gold across the nanotube arrays that were protruding from the polymer matrix.&lt;ref name="Wei et al., 2006"/&gt;   The flexible VANTA device was demonstrated to successfully sense chemical vapors through monitoring conductivity changes caused by the charge-transfer interaction with gas molecules and/or the inter-tube distance changes induced by polymer swelling via gas absorption.  To date, CNTs have shown sensitivities toward gases such as NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, CO, SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

=== Biological sensor ===
VANTAs act as forests of molecular wires to allow electrical communication between the underlying electrode and a biological entity.&lt;ref name="Wang et al., 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Joseph|title=Carbon-Nanotube Based Electrochemical Biosensors: A Review|journal=Electroanalysis|date=1 January 2005|volume=17|issue=1|pages=7–14|doi=10.1002/elan.200403113|url=http://doi.org/10.1002/elan.200403113|language=en|issn=1521-4109}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main advantages of VANTAs are the nanosize of the CNT-sensing element and the corresponding small amount of material required for a detectable response. The well-aligned CNT arrays have been employed to work as ribonucleic acid ([[RNA]]) sensors, [[enzymes]] sensors, [[DNA]] sensors, and even [[protein]] sensors. Similar VANTAs of MWNTs, grown on platinum substrates, are useful for amperometric electrodes where the oxygenated or functionalized open-ends of nanotubes are used for the immobilization of biological species, while the platinum substrate provides the signal transduction.  To increase the selectivity and sensitivity of amperometric biosensors, artificial mediators and permselective coatings are often used in the biosensor fabrication. Artificial mediators are used to shuttle electrons between the enzyme and the electrode to allow operation at low potentials.
Gooding et al. demonstrated that shortened SWNTs can be aligned normal to an electrode by self-assembly and act as molecular wires to allow electrical communication between the underlying electrode and redox proteins covalently attached to the ends of the SWNTs.&lt;ref name="Gooding et al., 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gooding|first1=J. Justin|last2=Wibowo|first2=Rahmat|last3=Yang|first3=Wenrong|last4=Losic|first4=Dusan|last5=Orbons|first5=Shannon|last6=Mearns|first6=Freya J.|last7=Shapter|first7=Joe G.|last8=Hibbert|first8=D. Brynn|title=Protein Electrochemistry Using Aligned Carbon Nanotube Arrays|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|date=1 July 2003|volume=125|issue=30|pages=9006–9007|doi=10.1021/ja035722f|url=http://doi.org/10.1021/ja035722f|language=en|pmid=15369344}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The high rate of electron transfer through the nanotubes to redox proteins is clearly demonstrated by the similarity in the rate constant for electron transfer to MP-11 regardless of whether SWNTs are present or not.

=== Thermal interface materials ===
VANTA interfaces are more thermally conductive than conventional thermal interface materials at the same temperatures because phonons propagate easily along the highly thermally conductive CNTs and thus heat is transported in one direction along the alignment of the CNTs. The distribution and alignment of the thermally conductive CNT fillers are important factors to affect the phonon transport.  Huang et al. demonstrated a thermally conductive composite shows an enhancement of 0.65W/m/K with a 0.3wt% loading of VANTA, whereas the enhanced thermal conductivity of a composite with of 0.3 wt% loading of randomly dispersed CNT is below 0.05W/m/K.

=== [[Transistors]] ===
VANTAs of SWNTs with perfectly linear geometries are applicable as high-performance p- and n-channel transistors and unipolar and complementary logic gates.&lt;ref name="Kang et al., 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kang|first1=Seong Jun|last2=Kocabas|first2=Coskun|last3=Ozel|first3=Taner|last4=Shim|first4=Moonsub|last5=Pimparkar|first5=Ninad|last6=Alam|first6=Muhammad A.|last7=Rotkin|first7=Slava V.|last8=Rogers|first8=John A.|title=High-performance electronics using dense, perfectly aligned arrays of single-walled carbon nanotubes|journal=Nature Nanotechnology|date=2007|volume=2|issue=4|pages=230–236|doi=10.1038/nnano.2007.77|url=http://doi.org/10.1038/nnano.2007.77}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The excellent properties of the devices derive directly from a complete absence, to within experimental uncertainties, of any defects in the arrays, as defined by tubes or segments of tubes that are misaligned or have nonlinear shapes.  The large number of SWNTs enables excellent device-level performance characteristics and good device-to-device uniformity, even with SWNTs that are electronically heterogeneous. Measurements on p- and n-channel transistors that involve as many as about 2,100 SWNTs reveal device-level mobilities and scaled [[transconductance]] approaching about 1,000 cm2 V-1 s-1 and $3,000 S m-1, respectively, and with current outputs of up to about 1 A in devices that use interdigitated electrodes.

=== Low-dielectric material ===
The low κ materials with low relative dielectric constants are employed as the insulating layers in integrated circuits to reduce the coupling [[capacitance]].  The relative [[dielectric constant]] of electrically insulating layers can be reduced further by introducing cavities into the low-κ materials. If elongated and oriented pores are used, it is possible to reduce significantly the effective κ value without increasing the proportion of the cavity volume in a dielectric.  The CNTs in VANTAs have a high aspect ratio and can be used to introduce elongated, oriented pores into a low-κ dielectric to further reduce the effective κ value of the dielectric.

=== [[Fuel cell]] ===
Fuel cells are made up of three sandwiched segments: an [[anode]], an [[electrolyte]], and a [[cathode]], in a reaction cell where electricity is produced inside the fuel cells through the reactions between an external fuel and an oxidant in the presence of an electrolyte.  The anode hosts a catalyst that oxidizes the fuel, turning the fuel into positively charged ions and negatively charged electrons. This fuel is typically hydrogen, hydrocarbons, and alcohols.  The electrolyte blocks the transportation of electrons while conducting ions. The ions traveling through the electrolyte are re-united on the cathode with the electrons passing through a load during a reaction with an oxidant to produce water or carbon dioxide.  Ideal anode supports for the deposition of catalytic nanoparticles are porous conductive materials to maximize the electrocatalytic activity.  VANTAs are therefore ideal materials due to their intrinsic high conductivity, high surface area, and stability in most fuel cell electrolytes.  A typical catalyst deposited on VANTA anodes is platinum, which can be electrodeposited on the individual CNTs of the VANTA.  The electrocatalytic activity at the anode is optimal when the Pt particles are uniformly dispersed within the VANTA.

Gong et al. reported that VANTAs doped with nitrogen can act as a metal-free electrode with a much better electrocatalytic activity, long-term operation stability, and tolerance to crossover effect than platinum for oxygen reduction in alkaline fuel cells.&lt;ref name="Gong et al., 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gong|first1=Kuanping|last2=Du|first2=Feng|last3=Xia|first3=Zhenhai|last4=Durstock|first4=Michael|last5=Dai|first5=Liming|title=Nitrogen-Doped Carbon Nanotube Arrays with High Electrocatalytic Activity for Oxygen Reduction|journal=Science|date=6 February 2009|volume=323|issue=5915|pages=760–764|doi=10.1126/science.1168049|url=http://doi.org/10.1126/science.1168049|language=en|issn=0036-8075|pmid=19197058}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In air-saturated 0.1 molar potassium hydroxide, a steady-state output potential of –80 millivolts and a current density of 4.1 milliamps per square centimeter at –0.22 volts was observed, as compared to –85 millivolts and 1.1 milliamps per square centimeter at –0.20 volts for a platinum-carbon electrode. The incorporation of electron-accepting nitrogen atoms in the conjugated nanotube carbon plane appears to impart a relatively high positive charge density on adjacent carbon atoms. This effect, coupled with aligning the nitrogen-doped CNTs, provides a four-electron pathway for the oxygen reduction reactions on VANTAs with a superb performance.

=== [[Supercapacitors]] ===

Like ordinary [[capacitors]], VANTA supercapacitors and electromechanical actuators typically comprise two electrodes separated by an electronically insulating material, which is ionically conducting in electrochemical devices. The capacitance for an ordinary planar sheet capacitor inversely depends on the inter-electrode separation. In contrast, the capacitance for an electrochemical device depends on the separation between the charge on the electrode and the countercharge in the electrolyte. Because this separation is about a nanometer for CNTs in VANTA electrodes, as compared with the micrometer or larger separations in ordinary dielectric capacitors, very large capacitances result from the high CNT surface area accessible to the electrolyte. These capacitances (typically 15 - 200 F/g, depending on the surface area of the nanotube array) result in large amounts of charge injection when only a few volts are applied.&lt;ref name="Baughman, 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baughman|first1=R. H.|title=Carbon Nanotubes--the Route Toward Applications|journal=Science|date=2 August 2002|volume=297|issue=5582|pages=787–792|doi=10.1126/science.1060928}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Futaba et al. reported a technique to form super-capacitors from a VANTA flattened by settling the erect CNTs by wetting them with a liquid.&lt;ref name="Futaba et al., 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Futaba|first1=Don N.|last2=Hata|first2=Kenji|last3=Yamada|first3=Takeo|last4=Hiraoka|first4=Tatsuki|last5=Hayamizu|first5=Yuhei|last6=Kakudate|first6=Yozo|last7=Tanaike|first7=Osamu|last8=Hatori|first8=Hiroaki|last9=Yumura|first9=Motoo|last10=Iijima|first10=Sumio|title=Shape-engineerable and highly densely packed single-walled carbon nanotubes and their application as super-capacitor electrodes|journal=Nature Materials|date=2006|volume=5|issue=12|pages=987–994|doi=10.1038/nmat1782|url=http://doi.org/10.1038/nmat1782|pmid=17128258}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The capacitance of the SWNT solid EDLC was estimated as 20 F g&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; from the discharge curves of cells charged at 2.5V for a two-electrode cell, and corresponds to 80 F g&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; for a three-electrode cell.  The energy density (W = CV&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/2) was estimated to be 69.4 W h kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (from 80 F g&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) when normalized to the single electrode weight.

=== Batteries ===
Unlike in ultracapacitors where the solvent of the electrolyte is not involved in the charge storage mechanism, the solvent of the electrolyte contributes to the solid–electrolyte interphase in batteries. The [[Li-ion batteries]] usually consist of an active carbon anode, a lithium–cobalt oxide cathode, and an organic electrolyte.  In order to obtain better electrode performance than networks of random CNTs and CNT composites, VANTAs are used as to provide better electron transport and higher surface area.

'''''Waterlife''''' is a 2009 [[documentary film]] and [[web documentary]] about the state of the [[Great Lakes]].

==Film==
[[Kevin McMahon (filmmaker)|Kevin McMahon]] began filming ''Waterlife'' in 2007. The film explores the beauty of the Great Lakes as well as their degradation due to [[water pollution]].&lt;ref name="Keenan"&gt;{{cite news|last=Keenan|first=Marney Rich |title=Film paints frightening picture of Great Lakes in jeopardy|url=http://detnews.com/article/20101117/OPINION03/11170342/Film-paints-frightening-picture-of-Great-Lakes-in-jeopardy#ixzz169yQml4g|accessdate=24 November 2010|newspaper=[[The Detroit News]]|date=17 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film looks at the water system from its [[headwater]]s in [[Lake Superior]] to the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]], accompanied by Josephine Mandamin, an [[Anishinabe]] elder from [[Thunder Bay]], who walks along the Great Lakes each spring to protest deteriorating conditions.&lt;ref name="Lacey"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lacey|first=Liam|title=Great Lakes script could have used more filtration|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/waterlife/article1169000/|accessdate=24 November 2010|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=22 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Waterlife'' is co-produced by [[Primitive Entertainment]] and the [[National Film Board of Canada]] (NFB).&lt;ref name="NFB"&gt;{{cite web|title=Waterlife|url=http://www.onf-nfb.gc.ca/eng/collection/film/?id=55963|work=Collection|publisher=[[National Film Board of Canada]]|accessdate=24 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film received the Special Jury Prize for Canadian Feature at the 2009 [[Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival]].&lt;ref name="HD awards"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hot Docs 2009 Awards|url=http://www.hotdocs.ca/index.php/daily/hot_docs_2009_awards_presentation/|work=[[Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Kingdom]] distributor is [[Dogwoof Pictures]].&lt;ref name=Afan&gt;{{cite news|last=Afan|first=Emily Claire|title=Dogwoof acquires NFB docs|url=http://playbackonline.ca/2010/11/19/dogwoof-acquires-nfb-docs/|accessdate=17 December 2011|newspaper=[[Playback (website)|Playback]]|date=19 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Waterproof paper''' is a type of paper that is good for outdoor, marine, field use and general wet environments. Often designed especially for printing [[topographic map]]s. It is normally durable and tear-resistant.

The [[paper]] is created with special [[coatings]] ([[plastic-coated paper]]) and [[Fiber|fibers]] to allow it to stay together and not change shape or texture when exposed to rain, dampness, or immersed in water.

Waterproof paper is difficult to [[Paper recycling|recycle]].

The '''winter of 1886–1887''' was extremely harsh for much of continental North America, especially the United States. Although it affected other regions in the country, it is most known for its effects on the Western United States and its [[ranching|cattle industry]]. This winter marked the end of the [[open range]] era and led to the entire reorganization of [[Ranch|ranching]].

==History==
The summer of 1886 had been unusually hot and dry, with numerous prairie fires, and water sources often dried up. In the fall, signs of a harsh winter ahead began to appear. Birds began flying south earlier than usual, beavers were seen collecting more wood than normal for the winter ahead, and some cattle grew thicker and shaggier coats.&lt;ref name=montanahistoryjournal&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mattison|first=Ray H.|title=The Hard Winter and the Range Cattle Business|journal=The Montana Magazine of History|date=October 1951|volume=1|issue=4|pages=5–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first snows fell earlier than usual, in November, and were reported as some of the worst in memory. Extreme cold killed humans and animals. Some people got lost near their houses and froze to death very near their front doors. The winter weather even reached the West Coast, with snowfall of 3.7 inches in downtown [[San Francisco]] setting an all-time record on February 5, 1887.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thestormking.com/Sierra_Stories/San_Francisco_Snowstorms/san_francisco_snowstorms.html |title=San Francisco Snowstorms |website=TheStormKing.com |publisher=Mic Mac Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The loss of livestock was not discovered until spring, when many cattle carcasses were spread across the fields and washed down streams. The few remaining cattle were in poor health, emaciated and suffering from [[frostbite]]. This resulted in the cattle being sold for much less, in some cases leading to [[bankruptcy]].

Future president [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s cattle ranch near [[Medora, Dakota Territory]] was among those hit hard by that winter. In a letter to his friend, [[Henry Cabot Lodge]], Roosevelt remarked "Well, we have had a perfect smashup all through the cattle country of the northwest. The losses are crippling. For the first time I have been utterly unable to enjoy a visit to my ranch. I shall be glad to get home."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brooks |first1=Chester L. |last2=Mattison |first2=Ray H. |title=Theodore Roosevelt and the Dakota Badlands |date=1958 |url=http://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/hh/thro/throl.htm |website= NPS Historical Handbook: Theodore Roosevelt |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''zud''' or '''dzud''' ({{lang-mn|зуд}}) is a [[Mongolia]]n term for a severe [[winter]] in which large number of livestock die, primarily due to [[starvation]] due to being unable to graze, in other cases directly from the cold. There are various kinds of zud, including white zud, which is an extremely snowy [[winter]] in which livestock are unable to find nourishing foodstuff through the snow cover and starve.

One-third of Mongolia's population depends entirely on [[pastoral farming]] for its livelihood, and harsh zuds can cause economic crises and [[food security]] issues in the country.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; This [[natural disaster]] is unique to [[Mongolia]].&lt;ref name="eurasianet.org"&gt;[http://www.eurasianet.org/node/78061 Mongolia: Harsh Winter Wiping Out Livestock, Stoking Economic Crisis for Nomads], ''Eurasianet'', 1 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="http://www.bbc.com"&gt; [https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-35983912 The slow and deadly dzud in Mongolia], ''[[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]]'', 14 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description and mitigation ==

There are different types of zud:

* ''Tsagaan'' (white) zud results from high snowfall that prevents livestock from reaching the grass.&lt;ref name="Neil Leary 2008 76"&gt;{{cite book|author=Neil Leary|title=Climate Change and Vulnerability|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=bqXln2IgClMC&amp;pg=PA76|year=2008|publisher=The International STAT Secretariat|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a frequent and serious disaster that has caused a great number of deaths.&lt;ref name="J.M. Suttie, Stephen G. Reynolds, Caterina Batello 2005 293"&gt;{{cite book|author1=J.M. Suttie |author2=Stephen G. Reynolds |author3=Caterina Batello |title=Grasslands of the World|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=BBA_HxFizNgC&amp;pg=PA293|year=2005|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|page=293}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* ''Khar'' (black) zud results from a lack of snow in grazing areas, leading to both animals and humans to suffer a lack of water. This type of zud does not occur every year nor does it affect large areas. It mostly happens in the [[Gobi Desert]] region.&lt;ref name="Neil Leary 2008 76"/&gt;
* ''Tumer'' (iron) zud results from a short wintertime warming, followed by a return to sub-freezing temperatures. The snow melts and then freezes again, creating an impenetrable ice-cover that prevents livestock from grazing.&lt;ref name="Neil Leary 2008 76"/&gt;
* ''Khuiten'' (cold) zud occurs when temperature drops to very low levels for several days. The cold temperature and the strong winds prevent livestock from grazing; the animals have to use most of their energy to keep warm.&lt;ref name="Neil Leary 2008 76"/&gt;
* ''Khavsarsan'' (combined) zud is a combination of at least two of the above types of zud.&lt;ref name="Neil Leary 2008 76"/&gt;

Some traditional methods to protect the livestock from such inclement weather conditions include drying and storing cut grass during the summer months, and collecting sheep and goat dung to build dried flammable blocks called "Khurjun" or kizyak. Dried grass can be fed to animals to prevent death from starvation when zud occurs.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} The "Khurjun", or blocks of sheep and goat dung, were stacked to create a wall that protects the animals from the wind chills, and keep them warm enough to withstand the harsh conditions. These blocks can also be burnt as fuel during the winter. These methods are still practiced today in the westernmost parts of [[Mongolia]], and areas formerly part of the [[Dzungaria|Zuun Gar]] nation.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Also because of the semi-permanent structure of the winter shelter for their livestock and the cold, most if not all nomads engage in [[transhumance]] (seasonal migration). They have winter locations to spend the winter that is in a valley protected by mountains on most sides from the wind, while in the summer they move to more open space.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==Man-made factors==
Human factors worsen the situation caused by the harsh winters. Under the [[Mongolian People's Republic|communist regime]], the state regulated the size of the herds to prevent [[overgrazing]]. The 1990s saw a deregulation of Mongolia's economy and a simultaneous growth in worldwide demand for [[cashmere wool]], which is made from goat hair. As a result, the number of [[goat]]s in Mongolia has grown sharply. Unlike [[sheep]], goats tend to damage the grass by nibbling at its roots; their sharp [[hoof|hooves]] also damage the upper layer of the pasture, which is subsequently swept away by the wind. This leads to [[desertification]].&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|last=Jacobs|first=Andrew|title=Winter Leaves Mongolians a Harvest of Carcasses|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/20/world/asia/20mongolia.html|accessdate=5 June 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Extent and history ==
It is not uncommon for zuds to kill over 1 million head of livestock in a winter. The 1944 record of almost 7 million head of livestock lost&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  was shattered in the 21st century. Of note, the [[arctic oscillation]] in both 1944–45 and in 2010 was pushed much deeper into Central Asia bringing prolonged extreme cold weather. In 1999–2000, 2000–2001 and 2001–2002, Mongolia was hit by three ''zuds'' in a row, in which a combined number of 11 million animals were lost.&lt;ref name="adb.org"&gt;, [http://www.adb.org/news/adb-approves-2-million-herders-hit-mongolian-climate-disaster ADB Approves $2 Million for Herders Hit By Mongolian Climate Disaster], ''Asian Development Bank'', April 11, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In winter 2009–2010 80% of the country's territory was covered with a snow blanket of 200–600mm (7-24 inches). &lt;ref name="Report Feb 9 2010"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; But by May 2010, the United Nations reported that eight million, or about 17% of the country's entire livestock, had died.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

In the winter 2015–2016, extreme temperatures were again recorded and the previous summer's drought lead to insufficient hay fodder reserves for many herders which is creating another ongoing loss of livestock.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

==Social consequences==
Some herders who lose all of their animals to ''zud'' have to seek a new life in the cities. Mongolia's capital [[Ulaanbaatar]] is surrounded by clusters of wooden houses without roads, water or sewage systems. Lacking in education and skills to survive in an urban environment, many displaced herders cannot find work and fall into extreme [[poverty]], [[alcoholism]] and [[crime]]. Others risk their lives in dangerous [[illegal mining]] jobs.&lt;ref name="https://newint.org"&gt; [https://newint.org/features/web-exclusive/2016/05/10/mongolias-dzud-disaster/ Mongolia’s dzud disaster], ''The New Internationalist'', May 10, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regional Equivalents ==
In Kazakh, '''zhut''' is a term for a famine due to natural disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://kazakhnomad.wordpress.com/2009/08/24/aminas-grandfather-played-opossum/ |title=Amina's Grandfather Played Opossum | date=2009-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=May 2016}}
