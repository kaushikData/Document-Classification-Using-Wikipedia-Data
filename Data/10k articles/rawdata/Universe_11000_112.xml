The '''1930 Curuçá River event''' was a [[meteor]]ic [[air burst]] that occurred on 13 August 1930 over the area of [[Curuçá River (Javari River)|Curuçá River]] in [[Brazil]].&lt;ref name="Reza" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reza et al" /&gt; It is based on the account of a single investigator who interviewed witnesses to the purported event, who then wrote a letter to the Vatican Observatory.

==Overview==
The event received little attention until 1995, when British astronomer Mark E. Bailey found in the [[Vatican Library]] archives a 1931 issue of ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'', which contained a dispatch from the [[Franciscan monk]] [[Fedele d'Alviano]]. D'Alviano had visited the region five days after the event and interviewed people from the region; they told him they were frightened of what had happened. According to Bailey, the Curuçá event was one of the most important impact events of the 20th century.

Inspired by Bailey's article and based on images from [[Landsat]] satellites, the Brazilian astrophysicist [[Ramiro de la Reza]] was able to identify a potential [[astrobleme]]—the remains of a meteorite impact crater—measuring 1&amp;nbsp;km in diameter, to the southeast of the village of Argemiro.&lt;ref name="Reza et al" /&gt;

In the first week of June 1997, de la Reza led an expedition organized by [[Rede Globo]] and co-financed by [[ABC Television]] of [[Australia]], to the region where the event occurred. A raised circular feature was found, but evidence is still lacking attesting that it came from a meteor impact. A record from the seismological observatory of San Calixto in [[La Paz]] indicated that the crater may have been created on the same date.&lt;ref name="Reza" /&gt; However, the earthquake that was recorded was smaller than what would be expected from the formation of a crater that size (a seismic signal that would have been detected by stations all over the world) and the signal was more consistent with a local event near the seismograph.&lt;ref name="Corderoa2011" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.177.2473&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf#page=160&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial mass of the [[meteor]] has been estimated at between 1,000 and 25,000 tons.&lt;ref name="McFarland" /&gt; Estimates for the energy released have varied from 9 [[TNT equivalent|kiloton]]s,&lt;ref name="Corderoa2011" /&gt; 100 kilotons,&lt;ref name="McFarland" /&gt; and 5 megatons,&lt;ref name="Reza"/&gt; though most estimates place the energy at below 1 megaton.&lt;ref name="McFarland" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Corderoa2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lienhard" /&gt; Regardless, the event was significantly smaller than the 10–15 megaton [[Tunguska event]].

In [[chemistry]] and [[physics]], '''activation energy''' is the energy which must be provided to a chemical or nuclear&lt;ref&gt;http://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~kagan/phy367/Lectures/P367_lec_14.html{{full|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; system with potential reactants to result in: a [[chemical reaction]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chem.fsu.edu/chemlab/chm1046course/activation|title=Activation Energy|website=www.chem.fsu.edu|access-date=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[nuclear reaction]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~kagan/phy367/Lectures/P367_lec_14.html&lt;/ref&gt;, or various other physical phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1151-2916.1990.tb05175.x |title=Estimate of the Activation Energies for Boundary Diffusion from Rate-Controlled Sintering of Pure Alumina, and Alumina Doped with Zirconia or Titania |journal=Journal of the American Ceramic Society |volume=73 |issue=5 |pages=1172 |year=1990 |last1=Wang |first1=Jenqdaw |last2=Raj |first2=Rishi }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00150193.2012.707592 |title=Temperature Dependence of the Raman Frequency, Damping Constant and the Activation Energy of a Soft-Optic Mode in Ferroelectric Barium Titanate |journal=Ferroelectrics |volume=432 |pages=14 |year=2012 |last1=Kiraci |first1=A |last2=Yurtseven |first2=H }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The activation energy (''E''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;) of a reaction is measured in [[joules]] (J) and or [[joule per mole|kilojoules per mole]] (kJ/mol) or [[kilocalorie per mole|kilocalories per mole]] (kcal/mol).&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, Thomas H. "Electrostatic Ignitions of Fires and Explosions" Wiley-AIChE (July 15, 1997) Center for Chemical Process Safety{{pn|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Activation energy can be thought of as the magnitude of the [[potential barrier]] (sometimes called the energy barrier) separating [[minima]] of the [[potential energy]] surface pertaining to the initial and final [[thermodynamic state]]. For a chemical reaction, or [[Diffusing capacity|division]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.combustflame.2017.02.019 |title=Effect of catalytically active Ce 0.8 Gd 0.2 O 1.9  coating on the heterogeneous combustion of methane within MgO stabilized ZrO 2  porous ceramics |journal=Combustion and Flame |volume=180 |pages=32 |year=2017 |last1=Terracciano |first1=Anthony C |last2=De Oliveira |first2=Samuel |last3=Vazquez-Molina |first3=Demetrius |last4=Uribe-Romo |first4=Fernando J |last5=Vasu |first5=Subith S |last6=Orlovskaya |first6=Nina }}&lt;/ref&gt; to proceed at a reasonable rate, the temperature of the system should be high enough such that there exists an appreciable number of molecules with translational energy equal to or greater than the activation energy.

The term Activation Energy was introduced in 1889 by the Swedish scientist [[Svante Arrhenius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://opentextbc.ca/introductorychemistry/chapter/activation-energy-and-the-arrhenius-equation-2/|title=Activation Energy and the Arrhenius Equation – Introductory Chemistry- 1st Canadian Edition|website=opentextbc.ca|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Temperature dependence and the relation to the Arrhenius equation ==
{{Main|Arrhenius equation}}
The [[Arrhenius equation]] gives the quantitative basis of the relationship between the activation energy and the rate at which a reaction proceeds. From the equation, the activation energy can be found through the relation
:&lt;math&gt;k = A e^{{-E_\textrm{a}}/{(RT)}}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''A'' is the [[pre-exponential factor]] for the reaction, ''R'' is the universal [[gas constant]], ''T'' is the absolute temperature (usually in [[kelvin]]s), and ''k'' is the [[Reaction rate constant|reaction rate coefficient]]. Even without knowing ''A'', ''E''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; can be evaluated from the variation in reaction rate coefficients as a function of temperature (within the validity of the Arrhenius equation).

At a more advanced level, the net Arrhenius activation energy term from the Arrhenius equation is best regarded as an experimentally determined parameter that indicates the sensitivity of the reaction rate to temperature. There are two objections to associating this activation energy with the threshold barrier for an elementary reaction. First, it is often unclear as to whether or not reaction does proceed in one step; threshold barriers that are averaged out over all elementary steps have little theoretical value. Second, even if the reaction being studied is elementary, a spectrum of individual collisions contributes to rate constants obtained from bulk ('bulb') experiments involving billions of molecules, with many different reactant collision geometries and angles, different translational and (possibly) vibrational energies—all of which may lead to different microscopic reaction rates.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

== Negative activation energy ==
In some cases, rates of reaction ''decrease'' with increasing temperature. When following an approximately exponential relationship so the rate constant can still be fit to an Arrhenius expression, this results in a negative value of ''E''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;. Elementary reactions exhibiting these negative activation energies are typically barrierless reactions, in which the reaction proceeding relies on the capture of the molecules in a potential well. Increasing the temperature leads to a reduced probability of the colliding molecules capturing one another (with more glancing collisions not leading to reaction as the higher momentum carries the colliding particles out of the potential well), expressed as a reaction [[cross section (physics)|cross section]] that decreases with increasing temperature. Such a situation no longer leads itself to direct interpretations as the height of a potential spot.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

== Catalysts ==
{{Main|Catalysis}}
[[Image:Activation energy.svg|right|thumb|360px|The relationship between activation energy (&lt;math&gt;E_\textrm{a}&lt;/math&gt;) and [[Standard enthalpy of formation|enthalpy of formation]] (Δ''H'') with and without a catalyst, plotted against the [[reaction coordinate]]. The highest energy position (peak position) represents the transition state. With the catalyst, the energy required to enter transition state decreases, thereby decreasing the energy required to initiate the reaction.]]

A substance that modifies the transition state to lower the activation energy is termed a [[catalyst]]; a catalyst composed only of protein and (if applicable) small molecule cofactors is termed an [[enzyme]]. It is important to note that a catalyst increases the rate of reaction without being consumed by it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/101/reactions/faq/examples-of-catalysts.shtml|title=General Chemistry Online: FAQ: Chemical change: What are some examples of reactions that involve catalysts?|website=antoine.frostburg.edu|access-date=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, while the catalyst lowers the activation energy, it does not change the energies of the original reactants or products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bui|first1=Matthew|title=The Arrhenius Law: Activation Energies|url=https://chem.libretexts.org/Core/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry/Kinetics/Modeling_Reaction_Kinetics/Temperature_Dependence_of_Reaction_Rates/The_Arrhenius_Law/The_Arrhenius_Law%3A_Activation_Energies|website=Chemistry LibreTexts|publisher=UC Davis|accessdate=February 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, the reactant energy and the product energy remain the same and only the ''activation energy'' is altered (lowered).

== Relationship with Gibbs energy ==
In the [[Arrhenius equation]], the term activation energy (''E''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;) is used to describe the energy required [[reaction coordinate|to reach the]] [[transition state]].  Likewise, the [[Eyring equation]] is a similar equation that also describes the rate of a reaction.  Instead of also using ''E''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, however, the Eyring equation uses the concept of [[Gibbs energy]] and the symbol *&lt;math&gt;\ \Delta G^\ddagger &lt;/math&gt; to denote the energy of the [[transition state]]. This implies that the equation is similar but not identical to the Arrhenius one, because the Gibbs energy contains an [[entropy|entropic]] term in addition to the enthalpic one.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

[[File:Anakena-Ahu-Ature.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Ahu Ature on Anakena Beach.]]
'''Anakena ''' is a white coral sand beach in [[Rapa Nui National Park]] on [[Rapa Nui]] ([[Easter Island]]), a [[Chile]]an island in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Anakena has two [[Easter Island#Ahu|ahus]]; Ahu-Ature has a single [[moai]] and Ahu Nao-Nao has seven, two of which have deteriorated.&lt;ref&gt;https://easterislandtraveling.com/places-to-visit/anakena/{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has a palm grove and a car park.

Anakena is unusual for Easter Island in that it is one of only two small sandy beaches in an otherwise rocky coastline.

[[Rano Kau]] is at top with [[Hanga Roa]] just below it and [[Terevaka]] prominent above Anakena. A west up photo from [[NASA]].]]

== Legend and History ==
According to island oral traditions, Anakena was the landing place of [[Hotu Matu'a]], a [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] chief who led a two-canoe settlement party here and founded the first settlement on Rapa Nui.

It was later a ceremonial centre where islanders read from [[Rongorongo]] boards.

Anakena featured in the [[Tangata manu]] or Birdman cult as in years when the new Birdman was from the western clans, he would end his celebrations at Anakena.

== Archaeology ==
[[Modern archaeology]] has found traces of human settlement at Anakena as early as 1200 [[Common Era|CE]], though linguistic and other analysis indicates a range of dates for first settlement of Rapa Nui between 300 and 1200 CE.

Anakena has been the site of several archaeological digs including those of [[Katherine Routledge]] in 1914 and both [[William Mulloy]] and [[Thor Heyerdahl]] in the 1950s, and both of its ahus have been restored.

== Popular culture ==
Anakena was used as one of the film locations for the 1994 [[Kevin Reynolds (director)|Kevin Reynolds]] film ''[[Rapa Nui (film)|Rapa Nui]]''.

Balsam (from [[Latin]] balsamum "gum of the balsam tree," ultimately from Semitic, Aramaic ''busma'', Arabic ''basham'' and Hebrew ''basam'', "spice", "perfume") owes its name to the biblical [[Balm of Gilead]].

== Chemistry ==
Balsam is a [[solution]] of plant-specific [[resins]] in plant-specific [[solvent]]s ([[essential oil]]s). Such resins can include resin [[acid]]s, [[ester]]s, or [[alcohol]]s. The exudate is a mobile to highly viscous liquid and often contains crystallized resin particles. Over time and as a result of other influences the exudate loses its liquidizing components or gets chemically converted into a solid material (i.e. by [[autoxidation]]).&lt;ref name="urn"&gt;{{citation | author=Klemens Fiebach | author2=Dieter Grimm | contribution=Resins, Natural | title=[[Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry]] | edition=7th | publisher=Wiley | year=2007 | page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors require balsams to contain [[benzoic acid|benzoic]] or [[cinnamic acid]] or their esters.&lt;ref name="cmp"&gt;{{citation | author=Andrew Pengelly | title=The constituents of medicinal plants | chapter=Essential oils and resins | edition=2nd | year=2004 | publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin | page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Balsam |volume=3 |short=x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plant resins are sometimes classified according to other plant constituents in the mixture, for example as:&lt;ref name="cmp"/&gt;
* pure resins ([[guaiac]], [[hashish]]), 
* gum-resins (containing [[Natural gum|gum]]s/[[polysaccharide]]s), 
* oleo-gum-resins (a mixture of gums, resins and essential oils), 
* [[oleo-resin]]s (a mixture of resins and essential oils, e. g. [[capsicum]], [[ginger]] and [[aspidinol]]), 
* balsams (resinous mixtures that contain [[cinnamic acid|cinnamic]] and/or [[benzoic acid]] or their esters), 
* glycoresins ([[podophyllin]], [[jalap]], [[kava kava]]),
* fossil resins ([[amber]], [[asphaltite]], [[Utah resin]]).

Usually, animal secretions ([[musk]], [[shellac]], [[beeswax]]) are excluded from this definition.

The '''Belene Nuclear Power Plant''' ({{lang-bg|Атомна електроцентрала „Белене“}}) is a planned [[nuclear power plant]] 3&amp;nbsp;km from [[Belene]] and 11&amp;nbsp;km from [[Svishtov]] in [[Pleven Province]], northern [[Bulgaria]], near the [[Danube River]]. It was intended to substitute four [[VVER]]-440 V230 reactors of the [[Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant]] that were decommissioned as a prerequisite for Bulgaria to join the European Union.

On June 11, 2010, the Bulgarian government announced that it would freeze indefinitely the planned construction of the Belene nuclear power plant because it was uncertain when the investment would be returned.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sofiaecho.com/2010/06/11/915612_bulgaria-scraps-bourgas-alexandroupoulis-pipeline-shelves-belene-nuke-pm&lt;/ref&gt; Five months later, on December 2, a non-binding [[memorandum of understanding]] was signed between [[NEK EAD]], [[Rosatom]], [[Altran]] and [[Fortum]], setting up a 6.3 bln. euro price on the power station, after months of unsuccessful talks on the cost and redeemability of the project itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesofiaecho.com/2010/12/02/1004103_shareholder-memoranda-to-build-bulgarias-belene-nuke-signed Shareholder memoranda to build Bulgaria's Belene nuke signed], The Sofia Echo, 2 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Further disagreement and the persistent demands of the Bulgarian government to lower the cost under 5.0 billion euro led to the termination of the project in March 2012. However, in late 2012 the opposition initiated a referendum petition which was supposedly signed by over 600 thousand people and the first national [[Bulgarian nuclear power referendum, 2013|referendum]] in the history of modern Bulgaria was held on January 27, 2013. A majority of the people had voted ′Yes' but despite that, the number of voters who attended the voting was too low for it to pass. The referendum passed the question further to the Parliament, which decided on 27 February 2013 to suspend it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=148250 Bulgarian Parliament Confirms Decision to Scrap Belene N-Plant], Novinite, 27 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Later on 30 May 2013 the newly elected Cabinet Prime Minister [[Plamen Oresharski|Oresharski]] announced there is a possible restart for it.&lt;ref name="novinite.com"&gt;[http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=150823 Bulgaria's New PM Hints of Reviving Belene N-Plant Project], Novinite, May 30, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Early project===
The discussions on constructing a second nuclear power plant started in the early 1970s. The Belene site was approved for the construction of a second Bulgarian NPP by a [[Council of Ministers of Bulgaria|Council of Ministers]] decree on 20 March 1981. The site was handed to the Ministry of Economics on 31 December 1981 and the documentation for the construction site's preparation was prepared in late 1980 and early 1981 by Energoproekt [[Sofia]]. The site's preparation in accordance with the draft projects began in the early 1981.

The foundations of the future power plant were laid in 1987 after the design of Atomenergoproekt [[Kiev]] from the [[USSR]] and Energoproekt Sofia. The design suggested the construction of four VVER-1000/V 320 reactors. Between 1988 and 1990 40% of the construction work of reactor 1 was finished and 80% of the equipment was supplied. The project was abandoned in 1990 due to the restoration of capitalism in Bulgaria and only conservational work was done. Since then, measures have been continuously undertaken to preserve the supplied equipment, the construction site and the buildings; various investigations and assessments have been carried out with respect to the site suitability and the equipment status, all of which yielded positive conclusions. New investigations have been performed in relation to site safety and its compliance with international requirements. There has been particularly extensive research on the seismic safety of the chosen site. A number of missions were carried out by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other bodies of authority. All these came up with positive conclusions and confirmations that the Belene site is suitable for the construction of a nuclear power plant.

===Restart===
In 2002 the Government decided in-principle for a restart of the Belene Project. Fulfillment of all legislative requirements allowed the Government to approve the construction of a nuclear power plant on the Belene site with total rated capacity of 2000 megawatts. The Ministry of Energy began to renew the available equipment and examine the possible construction of the new nuclear plant. In February 2003 Minister [[Milko Kovachev]] sent letters to six leading companies in the sphere of nuclear energy asking them to provide up-to-date technical, economic and financial information regarding the project.

A working group of experts was formed by an order of the Ministry of Energy and Energy Resources of 27 May 2003, which included experts from the Ministry of Energy and Energy Resources, the Ministry of Environment and Waters, the Ministry of Transport and Communication, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Health, the Nuclear Regulatory Agency, the State Energy and Water Regulatory Commission, the State Agency for Civil Protection, the National Electric Company and BulAtom. A programme for the expert commission's work was approved on 4 July 2003.

Pursuant to the above-mentioned decision, on May 10, 2005, the National Electric Company launched a procedure for selection of a Contractor for the engineering, procurement, and commissioning of Belene Nuclear Power Plant, Units 1&amp;2.

In late October 2006 the offer of the [[Russia]]n [[Atomstroyexport]], the [[France|French]] [[Areva|Framatome (Areva)]], and the [[Germany|German]] [[Siemens AG|Siemens]] using third-generation VVER-1000/V-446B reactors was approved by the National Electric Company. The offer was selected due to the highest safety level guaranteed by several new independent active and passive safety systems, as well as the option for Atomstroyexport to buy back the old unit supplied in the 1980s. Another reasons was the 60-year operation term. According to the Atomstroyexport president, the first unit would be in operation by 2013 and the second a year later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.standartnews.com/bg/article.php?d=2006-10-31&amp;article=166254 |title=Дадоха "Белене" на руснаците |date=2006-10-31 |accessdate=2006-10-31 |publisher=Standart News |last=Цанев |first=Белчо |language=Bulgarian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 December 2007 the European Commission gave its favourable opinion to the NPP, saying that it met all requirements of articles 41 to 44 of the Euratom Treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.sofiaecho.com/article/ec-announces-belene-npp-in-line-with-earatom/id_26570/catid_66 | title=EC announces Belene NPP in line with Euratom}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A favourable opinion of the EC is one of the requirements for a Euratom loan.

On 18 January 2008, Atomstroyexport and Bulgaria's [[NEK EAD|National Electric Company (NEC)]] signed the contract for the design, construction and installation of units 1 and 2 of the Belene NPP.&lt;ref name=sofia&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sofiaecho.com/article/belene-contract-signed-between-bulgarias-nec-and-russias-atomstroyexport/id_27138/catid_66 |title=Belene contract signed between Bulgaria's NEC and Russia's Atomstroyexport | author=Rene Beekman| publisher=The Sofia Echo |date=2008-01-18 |accessdate=2008-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sofia2&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.sofiaecho.com/article/bulgaria-and-russia-sign-belene-npp-south-stream-and-bourgas-alexandroupolis/id_27134/catid_66 | title=Bulgaria and Russia sign Belene NPP, South Stream and Bourgas Alexandroupolis | author=Elitsa Savova | publisher=The Sofia Echo | date=2008-01-18 | accessdate=2008-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 September 2008, the construction of the Belene NPP officially started. According to the Minister of Energy Petar Dimitrov, the Belene plant would operate "the most secure reactors existing in the world"; he also asserted that "the chance there would be a failure in those reactors is practically zero". Prime Minister Stanishev and Minister Dimitrov also called the project "a Renaissance for Bulgaria's nuclear energy" and "the largest industrial project in Bulgaria in the last eighteen years". More than 10,000 construction workers would be employed in the project, with the first reactor expected to be operating by the end of 2013, the second by the end of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Тръгна строежът на АЕЦ "Белене" |language=Bulgarian |publisher=News.bg |date=2008-09-03 |accessdate=2008-09-03 |last=Конова |first=Мариана |url=http://news.ibox.bg/news/id_875422405 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://sofiaecho.com/2008/09/05/663338_belene-powers-on |title=Belene powers on |date=2008-09-05 |accessdate=2009-06-02 |publisher=The Sofia Echo }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the schedule, Unit 1 of the A92 design has to be erected for 6.5 years and Unit 2 for 7.5 years with consideration of the specific licensing terms as per the Bulgarian legislation. The longest time consuming activities are related to the design work and equipment delivery (58 months), as well as to the very construction and installation (51 months).

=== Termination of the project ===
The negotiations stalled again after the GERB government decided to add an American or a European contractor to the project, as well as insisting for Atomstroyexport to lower the price to less than five billion euro. As no major European or American investor appeared, the talks continued to yield no results. This led to the official termination of the Belene project in March 2012. A thermal powerplant using gas from the [[South Stream]] pipeline will be built on the site, and the reactor for Unit 1 will be assembled as Unit 7 at the Kozloduy NPP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://novinite.com/view_news.php?id=137961 Bulgaria quits Belene Nuclear Power Plant project], Novinite, 28 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, the [[International Court of Arbitration]] awarded [[Atomstroyexport]] €620 million in compensation for equipment already manufactured for the plant, which will be delivered to Bulgaria following payment.&lt;ref name=nei-20161103&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.neimagazine.com/news/newsbulgaria-weighs-merits-of-belene-npp-or-kozloduy-extension-5658006 |title=Bulgaria weighs merits of Belene NPP or Kozloduy extension |publisher=Nuclear Engineering International |date=3 November 2016 |accessdate=5 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Possible project restart ===
Although the project was cancelled by parliament, the Bulgarian Socialist Party government of [[Plamen Oresharski]] (elected in May 29, 2013) has spoken publicly about restarting the project.

In 2016 discussions took place with [[Rosatom]] about the possibility of installing one of the reactors at [[Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant]] and selling the second one to a third party. An alternative is a privately financed completion of Belene.

On 7 June 2018, the Bulgarian Parliament voted to abolish the moratorium on the construction of the power plant. The aim of the government is to complete the project through funding by a strategic investor, what interest has so far been declared by several companies. Minister of Energy should develop an investor selection procedure and propose options for structuring the project by 31 October 2018. According to the Minister, the plant can be completed within 7-8 years.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.novinite.com/articles/190544/The+Bulgarian+Parliament%27s+Decision%3A+Restart+of+the+Belene+NPP+Project&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical Features==
The AES 92 variant proposed for implementation at the Belene NPP site is a new generation [[VVER]] type reactor that has been licensed by regulatory authorities in Russia. It has been declared to meet all safety requirements as well as recommendations from the IAEA and INSAG and has been also confirmed by a special analysis of leading experts from [[Électricité de France|EDF]] based on the recognized European Utility Requirements. This variant of the AES can make use of the two  partially completed Belene NPP reactors started in the 1980s. The design directly uses a majority of the already built civil structures and facilities related to generic plant needs. Existing foundations and civil structures will be further evaluated with a view to incorporation into the new design.

===AES 92 Reactor===
Belene NPP will be a [[Pressurized Water Reactor]] design with four first-stage coolant circulation loops per reactor. Reactor nominal thermal power is 3010 MWt and electrical net power is 1011 MWe. A typical refueling process takes 14 days with annual outage of between 20-28 and 40–50 days, depending on the scope of ongoing repair works. The AES 92 Reactor Facility has a 60-year lifetime design.

Being a Light Water Reactor of third generation type the AES 92 design has improved safety as well as technical and economic features. Main advantages of the AES 92 design over existing VVER nuclear power plants of the previous generation are:
* Ensuring for fast and sure termination of the nuclear reaction in the reactor core thanks to two individual completely independent reactivity control systems;
* Redundancy for all safety functions provided by the use of both active and passive safety systems (including a Passive Residual Heat Removal System and Passive Filtering System), which require neither operator intervention nor electric power supply;
* Use of a special enclosure to contain potential accidents. This structure is composed of a primary containment of pre-stressed reinforced concrete and a leak tight metal liner, secondary reinforced concrete containment, and cast concrete external structure designed to withstand a large range of internal and external events.

A specific feature of the third generation reactor presented in the AES 92 variant is the provision of a "core catcher" for severe accident cases. This insures against a containment integrity violation and release of highly radioactive substances into the environment.

Improved safety in the AES 92 design accounts for projected improvements in radiation protection parameters during its operation. The calculated individual effective dose of personnel exposure for this design is 1 mSv/a, which is commensurate with the permissible annual effective dose limit for a person in the general population and in compliance with the Bulgarian normative base and European directives. As to the design dose rate per person of the greater population due to radioactive releases by the NPP: this value for the AES 92 variant is lower than 0.05 mSv/a, which represents less than 1/3 of the permissible dose rate as per article 10 of NRA’s regulations ensuring the safety of NPPs. This dose is pertinent to the effect of all sources of releases at the site. The normalized annual radioactive releases are also indicative for the improved environmental impact parameters (for 1000 MW). While target criteria stipulated for the unit design was &lt; 6.7 GBq/a for liquid releases, the design value for AES 92 is lower by one order - 0.11 GBq/a. Similarly, with target criteria below 33.3 TBq/a for the liquid releases, the design value for AES 92 is 2.9 TBq/a.

Spent Nuclear Fuel (SNF) management and the Radioactive Waste (RAW) handling is an important aspect of the environmental impact assessment for the new plant. The fuel envisaged to be used for AES 92 allows for up to 50 years storage of spent fuel assemblies in a storage pool and then an additional 10 years of “dry” storage keeping. The general plan provides for SNF transportation to Russia for reprocessing.

Plasma incineration of solid wastes is envisaged for high-level waste generated during plant operation, with separate processing of liquid wastes depending on radioactivity. The anticipated total amount of conditioned wastes that will require disposal is less than 50 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; per year for one reactor unit.

==Controversy==
There is controversy over the [[Environmental Impact Assessment]] (EIA), which "does not contain adequate information on the seismic conditions, nor does it address [[BDBE|beyond design basis]] accidents or give details of the potential impacts of decommissioning".&lt;ref name=mycle&gt;[http://www.greens-efa.org/cms/topics/dokbin/206/206749.pdf  The World Nuclear Industry Status Report 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625044818/http://www.greens-efa.org/cms/topics/dokbin/206/206749.pdf |date=June 25, 2008 }} pp. 31-32.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, following legal action by environmental groups, the authors of the original EIA confirmed, in court, that it was flawed and would require a new EIA once a designer and builder were appointed. The total cost of the project is now estimated by the operator to be around €7 billion (€4 billion for the power stations plus associated infrastructure development costs).&lt;ref name=mycle/&gt;

Environmental organizations [[Greenpeace]], [[Friends of the Earth]] (Europe), [[Urgewald]], [[Bankwatch]], [[World Information Service on Energy]] and the Bulgarian NGO [[BeleNE!]] oppose the plant's construction, and have expressed the following concerns:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bankwatch.org/project.shtml?apc=---g--1&amp;x=2062712 Environmental Organizations condemn European Commission Decision on Bulgarian Reactor]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mail-archive.com/nuclear-romania@yahoogroups.com/msg00229.html |title=Press release of Greenpeace about the Belene project |accessdate=2006-10-31 |language=Romanian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* negative effect on the tourist industry and the agriculture of northern Bulgaria
* safety concerns over the use of nuclear technology
* location in a seismic active zone
* the expense of the project
* risk of terrorist attack
* problems with the transportation, procession and preservation of the nuclear waste
* complete unnecessity of further nuclear power in the first place, as better options are available.

Concerns regarding the construction of the plant have mainly been felt in nearby [[Romania]], with articles in the newspapers such as ''[[Cotidianul]]'', ''[[România Liberă]]'' and ''[[Ziarul]]'' even going as far as comparing the project with [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] despite a new generation of VVER reactors is to be used, and not the cheaper [[graphite]]-[[Neutron moderator|moderated]] [[RBMK]] series like Chernobyl's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Атака срещу "Белене" |url=http://www.standartnews.com/bg/article.php?d=2006-10-18&amp;article=164641 |date=2006-10-18 |accessdate=2006-10-31 |publisher=Standart News |language=Bulgarian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics say the project is economically flawed, open to corruption and mismanagement, and will cement Russian dominance of Bulgaria's energy sector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/10/30/business/renbulg.php Nuclear ambitions fan controversy in Bulgaria]&lt;/ref&gt;

The family settled near [[Louisiana State University]]. Jindal attended [[Baton Rouge Magnet High School]], graduating in 1988. While in high school, he competed in tennis tournaments, started various enterprises such as a computer newsletter, retail candy business, and a mail-order software company. He spent free time working in the stands at [[LSU Tigers football|LSU football]] games.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Jindal was one of only 50 students nationwide admitted to the [[Program in Liberal Medical Education]] (PLME), guaranteeing him a place at [[Alpert Medical School|Brown Medical School]]. He has been credited with leading [[Brown University]]'s [[College Republicans]] student group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sager|first=Mike|url=http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a4952/bobby-jindal-all-american-1008|title=Bobby Jindal, All American|work=[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]|date=June 25, 2015|accessdate=September 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The subject of his [[thesis]] was "A needs-based approach to health care".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Career==
After completing his studies at Oxford, Jindal turned down an offer to study for a [[D.Phil.]] in politics because his family couldn't afford to pay for his studies. Instead, Jindal joined the consulting firm [[McKinsey &amp; Company]].&lt;ref name="10things"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usnews.com/articles/news/campaign-2008/2008/05/22/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-bobby-jindal.html|title=10 Things You Didn't Know About Bobby Jindal|work=U.S. News &amp; World Report|first=Jill|last=Konieczko|date=May 22, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100623072857/http://www.usnews.com/articles/news/campaign-2008/2008/05/22/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-bobby-jindal.html|archivedate=June 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then [[Internship#United States|interned]] in the office of Rep.

===Foster administration===
In 1993, U.S. Representative [[Jim McCrery]] (whom Jindal had worked for as a summer intern) introduced him to Governor [[Mike Foster (American politician)|Mike Foster]]. In 1996, Foster appointed Jindal as Secretary of the [[Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals]], an agency that represented about 40 percent of the state [[budget]] and employed over 12,000 people. Foster called Jindal a genius who had a great deal of medical knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AD&amp;p_theme=ad&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB47801EBF0A17C&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|title=NewsLibrary Search Results|accessdate=July 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jindal was 24 at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bobby Jindal|url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/j/bobby_jindal/index.html|work=The New York Times|accessdate=July 23, 2012|first=Shaila|last=Dewan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his tenure, Louisiana's [[Medicaid]] program went from [[bankruptcy]] with a $400 million [[Government budget deficit|deficit]] into three years of [[Economic surplus|surpluses]] totaling $220 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zimbio.com/Congressman+Bobby+Jindal/articles/15/Rush+Limbaugh+defends+Bobby+Jindal Rush Limbaugh defends Bobby Jindal – Congressman Bobby Jindal – Zimbio]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707231810/http://www.zimbio.com/Congressman%2BBobby%2BJindal/articles/15/Rush%2BLimbaugh%2Bdefends%2BBobby%2BJindal|date=July 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Jindal was appointed executive director of the [[National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare]], a 17-member panel charged with devising plans to reform [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]]. In 1999, at the request of the Louisiana governor's office and the [[Louisiana State Legislature]], Jindal examined how Louisiana might use its $4.4 billion share of the [[Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement|tobacco settlement]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===2003 election for governor===
Jindal came to national prominence during the [[Louisiana gubernatorial election, 2003|2003 election]] for governor of Louisiana. In what Louisianans call an "[[open primary]]" (but which is technically a [[nonpartisan blanket primary]]), Jindal finished first with 33 percent of the vote. He received endorsements from the largest paper in Louisiana, the ''[[Times-Picayune]]''; the newly elected Democratic [[mayor of New Orleans]], [[Ray Nagin]]; and the outgoing Republican governor, [[Mike Foster (American politician)|Mike Foster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cowan, McGuire|first1=Walter Greaves, Jack B.|title=Louisiana Governors: Rulers, Rascals, and Reformers|date=2010|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|page=293|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y-0-kmu4vk0C&amp;pg=PA293&amp;lpg=PA293&amp;dq=mike+foster+endorse+jindal+2003&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GYu47JUf0w&amp;sig=q_8llOxM3uLVmCR-yPzBOKn2rK4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwB2oVChMIsfqq-9iJyAIVyxs-Ch3r-wts#v=onepage&amp;q=mike%20foster%20endorse%20jindal%202003&amp;f=false|accessdate=September 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second balloting, Jindal faced the outgoing lieutenant governor, [[Kathleen Babineaux Blanco]] of [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]], a Democrat. Despite winning in Blanco's hometown, he lost many normally [[conservative]] parishes in north Louisiana, and Blanco prevailed with 52 percent of the popular vote.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Despite losing the election in 2003, the run for governor made Jindal a well-known figure on the state's political scene and a rising star within the Republican Party.

He defeated eleven opponents in the [[nonpartisan blanket primary]] held on October 20, including two prominent Democrats, [[Louisiana State Legislature|State Senator]] [[Walter Boasso]] of [[Chalmette, Louisiana|Chalmette]] and [[Louisiana Public Service Commission]]er [[Foster Campbell]] of [[Bossier City, Louisiana|Bossier City]], and an [[Independent (politician)|independent]], New Orleans [[business]]man [[John Georges]].

Jindal finished with 699,672 votes (54 percent). Boasso ran second with 226,364 votes (17 percent). Georges finished with 186,800 (14 percent), and Campbell, who is also a former state senator, ran fourth with 161,425 (12 percent). The remaining candidates collectively polled three percent of the vote. Jindal polled [[Plurality (voting)|pluralities]] or [[majority|majorities]] in 60 of the state's 64 parishes (equivalent to counties in other states). He lost narrowly to Georges in [[Orleans Parish]], to Boasso in [[St. Bernard Parish]] (which Boasso represented in the Legislature), and in the two neighboring north Louisiana parishes of [[Red River Parish|Red River]] and [[Bienville Parish|Bienville]] located south of [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]], both historically Democratic and supported Campbell.

==Governor of Louisiana (2008–2016)==
===First term===
As governor-elect, Jindal named a new ethics team, with Democratic [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]] businesswoman [[Virginia Shehee|Virginia Kilpatrick Shehee]], the first woman to have served in the state senate, as the vice chairman of the panel. Jindal assumed the position of governor when he took the [[oath of office]] on January 14, 2008. At thirty-six, he became the youngest sitting governor in the United States. He is also Louisiana's first non-white governor since [[P. B. S. Pinchback]] served for thirty-five days during [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], and the first non-white governor to be elected (Pinchback succeeded to the position of lieutenant governor on the death of [[Oscar Dunn]], then to governor upon the impeachment of [[Henry Clay Warmoth]]).&lt;ref name=WashingtonPost_Whoriskey_20071021&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/20/AR2007102000528.html|title=Jindal Wins Louisiana Race, Becomes First Indian American Governor|first=Peter|last=Whoriskey|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=October 21, 2007|page=A8|accessdate=October 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Jindal became the first [[Indian American]] to be elected governor of any state in the United States.&lt;ref name="First IA gov"&gt;{{cite news|title=1st Indian-American governor in U.S. vows 'fresh start' for La|author=Jan Moller|url=http://www.nola.com/elections/index.ssf/2007/10/1st_indianamerican_governor_in.html|newspaper=The Times-Picayune|date=October 21, 2007|accessdate=March 24, 2012}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite book|title=Asian American chronology: chronologies of the American mosaic|last=Zhao|first=Xiaojian|year=2009|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|isbn=9780313348754|page=147|url=https://books.google.com/?id=SQPRCA9S9WAC&amp;lpg=PA124&amp;dq=Fourth%20Asian%20American%20governor%20jindal&amp;pg=PA124#v=onepage&amp;q=Fourth%20Asian%20American%20governor%20jindal&amp;f=false|accessdate=March 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Jindal was ranked one of the nation's most popular governors with an approval rating of 77%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jenningsdailynews.net/arch_news.php?id=1137] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301131643/http://www.jenningsdailynews.net/arch_news.php?id=1137|date=March 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections2/election_20082/2008_senate_elections/louisiana/election_2008_louisiana_senate|title=Election 2008: Louisiana Senate|publisher=Rasmussen Reports|accessdate=August 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Jindal's first appointments was that of [[Mike Edmonson]] as [[Superintendent (police)|superintendent]] of the [[Louisiana State Police]]. Edmonson had been for twenty preceding years the bodyguard and confidant of [[LSU Tigers football]] coaches. Edmonson was also the deputy secretary of the Department of Public Safety, an agency with more than 2,900 employees and a budget of nearly $500 million.&lt;ref name=lpb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beta.lpb.org/index.php/publicsquare/lps_bio/edmonson_colonel_michael|title=Colonel Michael Edmonson|publisher=[[Louisiana Public Broadcasting]]|accessdate=September 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Jindal was compelled to urge [[repeal]] of a state law that he had earlier signed which provided enhanced retirement benefits to Edmonson and, inadvertently, to one other state trooper. Jindal said that he was unaware that the legislation, called in the media the "Edmonson Act," applied only to two persons. He urged the legislature to rewrite the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theadvocate.com/home/10038115-123/jindal-favors-repeal-of-edmonson|title=Gov.

Another early appointee was that of former state representative [[Frank P.

Faircloth was considered the legal architect of the special 2008 legislative session on ethics reform. He guided the Jindal administration through the aftermath of [[Hurricane Gustav|Hurricanes Gustav]] and [[Hurricane Ike|Ike]]. After leaving the administration, he continued as a periodic legal advisor to Jindal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ww.fed-soc.org/experts/detail/jimmy-r-faircloth|title=Jimmy R.

[[File:Bobby Jindal Christmas 3.jpg|thumb|left|Governor Jindal greets children of deployed Louisiana National Guard Soldiers at the lighting of the State Capitol Christmas tree.]]
On June 27, 2008, Louisiana's Secretary of State confirmed that a [[Recall election|recall petition]] had been filed against Jindal in response to Jindal's refusal to [[veto]] a bill that would have more than doubled the current state legislative pay. During his gubernatorial campaign, Jindal had pledged to prevent legislative pay raises that would take effect during the current term.&lt;ref name=TimesPicayune_Scott_20080627&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nola.com/news/index.ssf/2008/06/recall_petition_filed_against.html|title=Recall petition filed against JindalRecall petition filed against Jindal|author=Scott, Robert Travis|work=The Times-Picayune|date=June 27, 2008|quote=Ryan and Kourtney Fournier of Jefferson submitted paperwork to the Secretary of State's office that allows them to attempt to collect the nearly 1 million signatures needed over the next 180 days to force a recall election of the governor...

Jindal responded by saying that he is opposed to the pay increase, but that he had pledged to let the legislature govern themselves.&lt;ref name=DailyAdvertiser_20080618&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theadvertiser.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080618/NEWS01/806180328/1001/NEWS|title=Gov.

On June 30, 2008, Jindal reversed his earlier position by vetoing the pay raise legislation, stating that he made a mistake by staying out of the pay raise issue. In response, the petitioners dropped their recall effort.&lt;ref name=TimesPicayune_Anderson_20080630&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nola.com/news/index.ssf/2008/06/jindal_vetoes_legislative_rais.html|title=Jindal vetoes legislative raise |date=June 30, 2008|author=Anderson, Ed|work=The Times-Picayune|quote=Gov.

The voters have demanded change... I made a mistake by staying out if it'.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Standard and Poor's]] raised Louisiana's bond rating and credit outlook from stable to positive in 2009. In announcing this change, the organization gave credit to the state's strong management and "commitment to streamlining its government functions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.2theadvocate.com/news/63908172.html|title=State's bond rating upgraded again|publisher=2theadvocate.com|accessdate=August 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jindal met with President [[Barack Obama]] in October 2009 where the governor pushed for increased federal dollars to cover rising Medicaid costs, speeding the construction of hurricane-protection barriers, and financing the proposed Louisiana State University teaching hospital. During a town hall meeting, Obama praised Jindal as a "hard working man who is doing a good job" for the State, and expressed support for the governor's overhaul of the State's educational system in the area of increased charter schools.&lt;ref name="content.usatoday.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/theoval/post/2009/10/68501045/1 | work=USA Today|accessdate=April 26, 2010|title=Obama, live from New Orleans|date=October 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Louisiana state government watchdog [[C.B. Forgotston]], former counsel to the House Appropriations Committee who supported Jindal's election in 2007, has expressed disappointment with the governor in regard to the legislative pay raise and other fiscal issues. Forgotston said he would grade Jindal an A+ in public relations and a D in fiscal performance in office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epaper.americanpress.com/Repository/ml.asp?Ref=QW1QLzIwMDkvMDEvMTEjQXIwMDUwMQ==&amp;Mode=HTML&amp;Locale=english-skin-custom|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227160905/http://epaper.americanpress.com/Repository/ml.asp?Ref=QW1QLzIwMDkvMDEvMTEjQXIwMDUwMQ%3D%3D&amp;Mode=HTML&amp;Locale=english-skin-custom|dead-url=yes|archive-date=February 27, 2009|title=Jindal Becomes Mileage Champion|publisher=''[[Lake Charles, Louisiana|Lake Charles American Press]]''|accessdate=January 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also ordered the state to purchase generators to provide needed power to hospitals and nursing homes without power. Government officials vacated hospitals and nursing homes and put the poor, the ill, and the elderly on buses and trains out of town. The evacuation was credited as one reason that Gustav resulted in only 16 deaths in the U.S. The state's successful response to [[Hurricane Gustav]] was in stark contrast to the failed [[hurricane response]] system for [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005.

White]], the short-term superintendent at the Recovery School District in New Orleans, to the position of state superintendent of education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/opinions/index.ssf/2012/01/john_whites_appointment_as_lou.html|title=John White's appointment as Louisiana education superintendent assures continuity for reforms: An editorial, January 13, 2012|publisher=[[New Orleans Times-Picayune]]|accessdate=October 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012, Jindal declared a statewide [[state of emergency]] due to the threat of subsidence and subsurface instability that threatens the lives and property of the citizens of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Proclamation No. 82 BJ 2012: State of Emergency – Threat of subsidence and subsurface instability|url=http://www.gov.state.la.us/assets/docs/82%20BJ%202012%20State%20of%20Emergency%20-%20Subsidence%20and%20Subsurface%20Instability.pdf|accessdate=July 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of Jindal's second term, he saw a marked drop in his state popularity and problems such as a budget deficit and cuts to public expenditure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=V.V.B.|title=Bobby Jindal bows out|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2015/11/and-then-there-were-fourteen|accessdate=November 19, 2015|work=[[The Economist]]|date=November 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He could not stand for a third term because the governor of Louisiana is subject to term limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://senate.legis.state.la.us/documents/constitution/constitution.pdf|title=Louisiana Constitution of 1974|at=Article IV, section 3, paragraph B|quote=A person who has served as governor for more than one and one-half terms in two consecutive terms shall not be elected governor for the succeeding term.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tax system proposals====
In January 2013, Jindal released a plan that would eliminate the Louisiana [[state income tax]], which he felt would expand business investment in the state, and then raise [[sales taxes]] in order to keep the plan revenue-neutral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/01/gov_bobby_jindal_calls_for_eli.html|first=Jeff|last=Adelson|title=Gov.

Forgotston correctly predicted that Jindal's plan would fail to clear the legislature because of the higher sales taxes, the lack of needed support from Democrats, and the likelihood that the plan would not increase overall state revenues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/louisianas-jindal-details-plan-end-states-income-tax-173706480.html |title=Louisiana's Jindal details plan to end state income tax", March 14, 2013 |publisher=Yahoo! |accessdate=April 18, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130318175415/http://news.yahoo.com/louisianas-jindal-details-plan-end-states-income-tax-173706480.html |archivedate=March 18, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 8, 2013, the first day of the legislative session, Jindal dropped the plan after acknowledging some negative response to the plan from legislators and the public, but said he would still like the legislature to formulate its own plan that could end the state income tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/09/us/gov-bobby-jindal-shelves-tax-plan-in-louisiana.html?nl=todaysheadlines&amp;emc=edit_th_20130409&amp;_r=0|first=Campbell|last=Robertson|title=A Governor Retrenches on a Big Idea|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 8, 2013|accessdate=April 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Energy plan====
Jindal announced, in September 2014, a six-point energy platform that would, among other things, open up energy production on federal land and  eliminated proposed carbon restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-politics-jindal-energy-idUSKBN0HB28720140916|title=Louisiana Governor Jindal, likely White House contender, touts energy plan|date=September 16, 2014|publisher=|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Speculation about 2008 vice presidential nomination===
[[File:BobbyJindalKennerMcCain2008.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Jindal in June 2008, at a [[John McCain]] campaign event in [[Kenner, Louisiana|Kenner]], Louisiana]]

On February 8, 2008, conservative radio host [[Rush Limbaugh]] mentioned on his syndicated show that Jindal could be a possible choice for the Republican [[Vice President of the United States|vice presidential]] nomination in 2008. He said that Jindal might be perceived as an asset to [[John McCain]]'s campaign because he has wide support in the conservative and moderate wings of the Republican Party and his immigrant past offsets McCain's white heritage. If McCain had won the presidency, he would have been the oldest president ever inaugurated to a first term.&lt;ref name=WashingtonTimes_Curl_20080212&gt;{{cite news |url=http://washingtontimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080212/NATION/504804903/1001 |work=The Washington Times |title=Running mate guessing game begins |first=Joseph |last=Curl |date=February 12, 2008 |accessdate=March 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heightening the speculation, McCain invited Jindal, Gov. [[Charlie Crist]] of [[Florida]], Gov. [[Tim Pawlenty]] of [[Minnesota]] and McCain's former rivals [[Mitt Romney]] and [[Mike Huckabee]] to meet at McCain's home in [[Arizona]] on May 23, 2008, according to a Republican familiar with the decision; Romney, Huckabee, and Pawlenty, all of whom were already well acquainted with McCain, declined because of prior commitments.&lt;ref name=NYT_Nagourney_20080521&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24762893/|work=The New York Times |title=McCain to Meet 3 Possible Running Mates|first=Adam |last=Nagourney |date=May 21, 2008|accessdate=May 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting may have served a different purpose, such as consideration of Jindal for the opportunity to speak at the [[2008 Republican National Convention]], in a similar fashion to [[Barack Obama]] at the [[2004 Democratic National Convention]], cementing a place for him in the party and opening the gate for a future run for the presidency.&lt;ref name=Dvorak_20080522&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time-blog.com/real_clear_politics/2008/05/what_about_jindal.html |publisher=Real Clear Politics |title=What About Jindal? |first=Blake |last=Dvorak |date=May 22, 2008|accessdate=May 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speculation was fueled by simultaneous July 21, 2008, reports that McCain was making a sudden visit to Louisiana to confer again with Jindal and that McCain was readying to name his running mate within a week. However, on July 23, 2008, Jindal said that he would not be the Republican vice presidential nominee in 2008.&lt;ref name=foxnews_20080723&gt;{{cite news|url=http://elections.foxnews.com/2008/07/23/jindal-says-hes-not-interested-in-no-2-spot-with-mccain/ |title=Jindal Says He's Not Interested in No. 2 Spot With McCain|work='Fox News

While Jindal was given a prime-time speech slot at the party convention, he was not offered the [[keynote speech]]. During the presidential campaign, Jindal expressed admiration for both Senators McCain and Obama, and maintained that both have made positive contributions to the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swamppolitics.com/news/politics/blog/2009/03/bobby_jindal_obama_greatest_sp.html |title=Bobby Jindal: Obama 'greatest' speaker: The Swamp |publisher=Swamppolitics.com |date=March 3, 2009 |accessdate=August 7, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507171959/http://www.swamppolitics.com/news/politics/blog/2009/03/bobby_jindal_obama_greatest_sp.html |archivedate=May 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Republican response to President Obama's address to Congress===
On February 24, 2009, Jindal delivered the official Republican response to President Obama's [[Barack Obama speech to Joint session of Congress, 2009|address to a joint session of Congress]]. Jindal called the president's economic stimulus plan "irresponsible" and argued against government intervention.&lt;ref name="bjspeech"&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=February 25, 2009|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/24/AR2009022404300.html|title=In GOP Response, Jindal Blasts Stimulus |first=Perry, Jr. |last=Bacon |date=February 25, 2009 |page=A08|work=[[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used [[Hurricane Katrina]] to warn against government solutions to the economic crisis. "Today in Washington, some are promising that government will rescue us from the economic storms raging all around us," Jindal said. "Those of us who lived through Hurricane Katrina, we have our doubts." He praised the late sheriff [[Harry Lee (sheriff)|Harry Lee]] for standing up to the government during Katrina.&lt;ref name=NYT_Transcript_20090224&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=February 25, 2009|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/24/us/politics/24jindal-text.html?pagewanted=all|title=Transcript – The Republican Response by Gov.

Bobby Jindal's volcano remark has some fuming|publisher=CNN |date=February 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The speech met with biting reviews from some members of both the Democratic and the Republican parties. Referring to Jindal as "devoid of substantive ideas for governing the country", political commentator [[Rachel Maddow]] summarized Jindal's Katrina remark as follows: "[Jindal states that] since government failed during Hurricane Katrina, we should understand, not that government should not be allowed to fail again, but that government...never works. That government can't work, and therefore we should stop seeking a functioning government."&lt;ref&gt;The Rachel Maddow Show on msnbc.com.

Jindal's story of meeting Lee in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina was questioned following the speech, as Jindal was not in New Orleans at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2009/02/27/politics/politicalhotsheet/entry4834777.shtml|publisher=CBS News|title=Was Jindal's Katrina Story Accurate?|first=Brian|last=Montopoli|date=February 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 27, 2009, a spokesman for Jindal clarified the timing of the meeting, stating that the story took place days after the storm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Ben|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0209/Jindal_aide_Story_was_set_after_Katrina.html?showall|title=Jindal aides clarify Katrina story – Ben Smith|publisher=Politico.com|date=February 27, 2009|accessdate=August 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Rebuttals to this explanation must be reliably sourced--&gt; The opportunity to give the response to President Obama's speech was compared by some commentators to winning "[[second prize in a beauty contest]]", a reference to the board game [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/The-Vote/2009/0211/one-night-only-barack-obama-vs-bobby-jindal|title=One night only Barack Obama vs. Bobby Jindal|work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|date=February 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2012 presidential election===
[[File:U.S. Governor of Louisiana Bobby Jindal speaking at the 2011 Values Voter Summit in Washington, D.C.jpg|thumb|Governor Jindal speaking at the 2011 Values Voter Summit in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
Jindal had been mentioned as a potential candidate for the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 presidential election]]. On December 10, 2008, Jindal indicated that he would likely not run for president in 2012, saying he will focus on his [[Louisiana gubernatorial election, 2011|re-election in 2011]] and that this would make transitioning to a national campaign difficult, though he did not rule out a possible 2012 presidential bid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/1208/Jindal_says_no.html?showall|title=Jindal says no|author=Ben Smith|publisher=Politico.com|accessdate=December 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Speculation increased when Republicans chose Jindal to deliver the response to President Obama's first address to a joint session of Congress.&lt;ref name=Reuters_Baltimore_20090219&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/usPoliticsNews/idUKTRE51I42K20090219|title=Republicans tap Louisiana governor for big speech|date=February 19, 2009|first=Chris|last=Baltimore|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jindal for President Draft Council Inc. [[Political action committee|PAC]] was formed in 2009 to raise funds for a future presidential run. Jindal has stated that he has no involvement with the PAC.&lt;ref name=NEWSMAX&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsmax.com/insidecover/bobby_jindal_governor/2009/06/15/225488.html|title=Jindal PAC Formed for Presidential Run |date=June 15, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090620000056/http://www.newsmax.com/insidecover/bobby_jindal_governor/2009/06/15/225488.html|archivedate=June 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, while speaking at the [[Southern Republican Leadership Conference]], Jindal ruled out running for the Republican nomination for President in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0410/35621_Page3.html|title=For GOP, no frontrunner and no worries|accessdate=September 24, 2015|last1=Martin|first1=Jonathan|last2=Smith|first2=Ben|date=April 11, 2010|publisher=[[Politico]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[U.S. presidential election, 2012|2012]], Jindal traveled across the country in support of the [[Mitt Romney]]-[[Paul Ryan]] ticket. Because Louisiana and other [[Deep South]] states voted heavily for the GOP, Jindal could hence devote his campaign time elsewhere. In August 2012, ''[[Politico]]'' reported that "Bobby Jindal would be considered [for] and would likely take" appointment as [[United States Secretary of Health and Human Services]] in a potential [[Mitt Romney|Romney]] [[United States Cabinet|cabinet]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/80233.html "Who's on the inside track for a Romney Cabinet"], politico.com, August 28, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the defeat of Romney-Ryan, Jindal called for his party to return to "the basics... If we want people to like us, we have to like them first," he said on the interview program ''[[Fox News Sunday]]''.&lt;ref name=gopleader&gt;"Governor: Liking people key to enlarging GOP base", ''[[Laredo Morning Times]]'', November 19, 2012, p. 6A&lt;/ref&gt;  As the incoming president of the [[Republican Governors Association]], which had thirty members in 2013, Jindal questioned Romney for having criticized President Obama as having provided "extraordinary financial gifts from the government".&lt;ref name=gopleader/&gt; In reply to Romney, Jindal said, "You don't start to like people by insulting them and saying their votes were bought."&lt;ref name=gopleader/&gt; Jindal said that his party must convince a majority of voters that it supports the middle class and the principle of [[upward mobility]]. He also criticized what he termed "stupid" remarks regarding rape and conception made in 2012 by defeated Republican U.S. Senate nominees [[Todd Akin]] in [[Missouri]] and [[Richard Mourdock]] in [[Indiana]].&lt;ref name=gopleader/&gt;

===2016 presidential candidacy===

[[File:U.S. Governor of Louisiana Bobby Jindal at 2015 Southern Republican Leadership Conference, Oklahoma City, OK.jpg|thumb|Governor Jindal at 2015 Southern Republican Leadership Conference, [[Oklahoma City, OK]]]]
In November 2012, after the election, Jindal was featured in a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine article titled "2016: Let's Get The Party Started", where he was listed as a possible Republican candidate for the presidency in 2016. The article cited his fiscal and social conservative policies and his Indian American background, which would bring diversity to the GOP.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=2016: Let's Get The Party Started|pages=118–31|periodical=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=November 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 18, 2015, Jindal formed a presidential exploratory committee to determine whether he would run as a candidate in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]],&lt;ref name=Hunt&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/governor-bobby-jindal-forms-2016-exploratory-committee-n360696|title=Governor Bobby Jindal Forms 2016 Exploratory Committee|publisher=[[NBC News]]|date=May 18, 2015|accessdate=May 20, 2015|author=Hunt, Kasie}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he announced his candidacy on June 24.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bobbyjindal.com/announcement/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626110206/http://www.bobbyjindal.com/announcement|dead-url=yes|archive-date=June 26, 2015|title=A Special Announcement From Bobby Jindal|publisher=BobbyJindal.com|accessdate=June 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his campaign, Jindal called [[Donald Trump]] a "narcissist" and an "egomaniacal madman", but afterward said that he would support Trump because "electing Donald Trump would be the second-worst thing we could do this November, better only than electing Hillary Clinton to serve as the third term for the Obama administration's radical policies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/08/where-republicans-stand-on-donald-trump-a-cheat-sheet/481449|title=Where Republicans Stand on Donald Trump: A Cheat Sheet|work=The Atlantic|date=August 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Jindal stated that he did not object to the use of [[emergency contraception]] in the case of [[rape]] if the victim requests it.&lt;ref name=CapitolWatch_Hill_20031112/&gt; While in the House of Representatives, he supported two bills to prohibit transporting minors across state lines to obtain an abortion; the bills aimed to prevent doctors and others from helping a minor avoid parental notification laws in their home state by procuring an abortion in another state.&lt;ref name=OntheIssues_20080916/&gt; He opposed and voted against expanding public funding of [[embryonic stem cell research]].&lt;ref name=OntheIssues_20080916/&gt;&lt;ref name=TimesPicayne_Alpert_20080521&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nola.com/news/index.ssf/2008/05/report_mccain_to_meet_with_jin.html|author1=Alpert, Bruce|author2=Jan Moller|lastauthoramp=yes|title=Jindal to meet Friday with McCain|work=The Times-Picayune|date=May 21, 2008|quote=Jindal is seen as solid on conservative social issues such as opposition to abortion and embryonic stem cell research.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Same-sex marriage===
Jindal opposed the legalization of [[same-sex marriage]]. In Congress, he voted for the [[Federal Marriage Amendment]] to restrict marriage to a union between one man and one woman. He also voted against the [[Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act|Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2007]].&lt;ref name=OnTheIssues_CivilRights&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/House/Bobby_Jindal_Civil_Rights.htm|title=Bobby Jindal on Civil Rights|publisher=OntheIssues.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2008, Jindal announced the formation of the Louisiana Commission on Marriage and Family,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bayoubuzz.com/News/Louisiana/Government/Louisiana_Gov._Jindal_Picks_Louisiana_Commission_on_Marriage_and_Family__7840.asp Louisiana Gov.

Following the 2013 Supreme Court's rulings on [[United States v. Windsor|DOMA]] and [[Hollingsworth v. Perry|Proposition 8]], he said: "I believe every child deserves a mom and a dad. This opinion leaves the matter of marriage to the states where people can decide. In Louisiana, we will opt for traditional marriage. How about we let the people decide for themselves, via their representatives and via referendum?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Associated Press |url=https://news.yahoo.com/gop-hopefuls-immigration-gay-marriage-080637140.html|title=GOP hopefuls on immigration, gay marriage|publisher=Yahoo!

====Marriage and Conscience Act====
In April 2015, Jindal announced that he would sign into law the Louisiana Marriage and Conscience Act proposed by newly elected Republican state representative [[Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)|Mike Johnson]]. In a guest editorial in ''[[The New York Times]]'', Jindal said that he has been contacted by several corporations who oppose the bill: "They are free to voice their opinions, but they will not deter me."&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theadvocate.com/features/realestate/12184896-70/bobby-jindal-im-holding-firm|title=Bobby Jindal gives his take on gay marriage in New York Times editorial|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=April 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson's bill proposed to bar the state from revoking licenses or refusing to engage in contract with individuals or businesses because they oppose marriage between two persons of the same sex. Johnson's bill was meant to guarantee the tax status of groups that support only traditional marriage.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; In May 2015, the legislature killed the measure. Four Republican members, [[Mike "Pete" Huval|Pete Huval]] of [[Breaux Bridge, Louisiana|Breaux Bridge]], [[Gregory A. Miller]] of [[Norco, Louisiana|Norco]], [[Clay Schexnayder]] of [[Gonzales, Louisiana|Gonzales]], and [[Nancy Landry]] of [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]], joined Democrats in killing the bill. Jindal responded by issuing [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] BJ-2015-8, (the "Marriage and Conscience Order"), which attempted to achieve the goals of the failed legislation.&lt;ref name=Epps&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/05/bobby-jindal-hb-707-and-the-2016-presidential-race/393833|title=What Will Bobby Jindal's 'Marriage and Conscience Order' Actually Do?|work=[[The Atlantic]]|accessdate=May 21, 2015|author=Epps, Garrett}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson said he intended to re-introduce the measure in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/05/louisianas_religious_freedom_b.html|title=Louisiana's religious freedom bill effectively defeated in committee|author=Emily Lane|publisher=New Orleans Times-Picayune|accessdate=May 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government ethics===
He vetoed state legislation to increase pay for state legislators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Morris, Tim|work=The Times-Picayune |url=http://www.nola.com/news/index.ssf/2008/06/jindal_vetoes_legislative_rais.html |title=Jindal vetoes legislative raise |date=June 30, 2008|accessdate=August 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ontheissues.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/House/Bobby_Jindal.htm |title=Bobby Jindal on the Issues |publisher=Ontheissues.org |date=March 14, 2012 |accessdate=August 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Louisiana governor's office was ranked last for transparency in the United States both prior, and subsequent, to Jindal's election, as reported by the WDSU I-Team. At least two legislators, state representatives [[Walker Hines (Louisiana politician)|Walker Hines]] and [[Neil Abramson]], argued that this may be attributed to legislation that removed the governor's records from the public domain; they argued that the legislation was surreptitiously inserted as a last-minute amendment into an education bill by Jindal's office on the last day of the 2008 session, providing no time to properly review it before it passed the legislature and was signed into law by Jindal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wdsu.com/news/16828329/detail.html |title=I-Team: Governor's Office Ranks Last In Transparency |publisher=WDSU |location=New Orleans |date=July 9, 2008 |accessdate=August 7, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224083924/http://www.wdsu.com/news/16828329/detail.html |archivedate=February 24, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Jindal signed into law a bill sponsored by Democratic state representative [[Jeff Arnold]] of New Orleans to permit [[Francis C. Heitmeier]], a Democratic former member of both houses of the Louisiana Legislature and an unsuccessful 2006 candidate for [[Louisiana Secretary of State]], to lobby legislators even though Heitmeier's brother, [[David Heitmeier]], was, at the time, the sitting senator for District 7, which includes the [[Algiers, New Orleans|Algiers]] neighbourhood of New Orleans. The special exemption permitted an immediate family member of an elected official who was a lobbyist for the executive branch of state government for the year prior to 9 January 2012, to be able to lobby the legislature. David Heitmeier abstained from voting on the measure which was written with the intent of benefiting Francis Heitmeier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/05/bobby_jindal_makes_ethics_exce.html|title=Bobby Jindal allows state ethics exception for former Louisiana legislator|date=May 31, 2014|publisher=[[New Orleans Times-Picayune]]|accessdate=April 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gun rights and gun control===
Jindal stated his support of the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]]'s right to bear arms. He opposed efforts to restrict gun rights and received an endorsement from the [[National Rifle Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Comment Cancel |url=http://www.mixx.com/stories/6467968/louisiana_governor_bobby_jindal_speaks_at_the_nra_annual_meetings |title=Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal Speaks at the NRA Annual Meetings |publisher=Mixx |accessdate=August 7, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090803000714/http://www.mixx.com/stories/6467968/louisiana_governor_bobby_jindal_speaks_at_the_nra_annual_meetings |archivedate=August 3, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jindal earned an A rating from [[Gun Owners of America]] while he was in Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gunowners.org/109hrat.htm|archivedate=January 22, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080122040555/http://www.gunowners.org/109hrat.htm|title=GOA House Ratings for the 109th Congress |publisher=GunOwners.org|date=October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a Congressman, he sponsored the [[Disaster Recovery Personal Protection Act of 2006]] with Senator Vitter.

In July 2015, during an interview with CBS, Jindal stated that he supported stricter background checks, and that every state should begin to enact tougher background checks on gun buyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/07/bobby-jindal-gun-control/399683/ |title=Bobby Jindal Calls for Better Mental-Health Reporting to National Background Check System |work=The Atlantic |date=July 27, 2015 |accessdate=November 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/27/us/politics/bobby-jindal-calls-for-states-to-follow-louisianas-example-in-toughening-gun-laws.html|title=Bobby Jindal Calls for States to Follow Louisiana’s Example in Toughening Gun Laws|first=Ashley|last=Southall|date=July 26, 2015|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He hunts.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/from-piyush-to-bobby-how-does-jindal-feel-about-his-familys-past/2015/06/22/7d45a3da-18ec-11e5-ab92-c75ae6ab94b5_story.html|title=From Piyush to Bobby: How does Jindal feel about his family's past?|website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tax policy===
As a private citizen, Jindal voted in 2002 for the Louisiana constitutional amendment known as the [[Stelly Plan]]&lt;ref name=Weekly_Tidmore_20040524&gt;{{cite web|title=The Weekly's inside political track....|author=Tidmore, Christopher |date=May 24, 2004|url=http://www.louisianaweekly.com/weekly/news/articlegate.pl?20040524p|work=Louisiana Weekly|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017040235/http://www.louisianaweekly.com/weekly/news/articlegate.pl?20040524p|archivedate=October 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; which lowered some sales taxes in exchange for higher income taxes. After taking office, Jindal cut taxes a total of six times, including the largest income tax cut in Louisiana's history – a cut of $1.1 billion over five years, along with accelerating the elimination of the tax on business investments.&lt;ref name=WAFB_Moses_20080618&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wafb.com/Global/story.asp?S=8521558&amp;nav=menu57_1|publisher=WAFB Channel 9|location=Baton Rouge, LA|title=Stelly tax ad causing controversy|author=Moses, Caroline|date=June 18, 2008|access-date=July 25, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080623051904/http://www.wafb.com/Global/story.asp?S=8521558&amp;nav=menu57_1|archive-date=June 23, 2008|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2013, Jindal said he wanted to eliminate all Louisiana corporate and personal income taxes, without giving details for his proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Louisiana Governor Jindal proposes ending state income tax |author=Kathy Finn |url=http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE90A02K20130111?irpc=932 |agency=Reuters |date=January 10, 2013 |accessdate=January 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
In 2008, Jindal came out in favour of the [[Common Core State Standards Initiative]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shreveporttimes.com/article/20130930/NEWS0401/309300002|title=Bobby Jindal questions Common Core while John White holds strong|last1=Nash-Wood|first1=Mary|date=September 29, 2013|publisher=shreveporttimes.com|accessdate=October 26, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131001144640/http://www.shreveporttimes.com/article/20130930/NEWS0401/309300002/|archivedate=October 1, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Louisiana adopted in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.louisianabelieves.com/newsroom/news-releases/2013/10/16/bese-passes-policies-to-support-local-curriculum-control-and-student-privacy-in-common-core-transition|title=BESE Passes Policies to Support Local Curriculum Control and Student Privacy in Common Core Transition|date=October 16, 2013|publisher=louisianabelieves.com|accessdate=October 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Jindal wrote that "It has become fashionable in the news media to believe there is a right-wing conspiracy against Common Core."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/04/23/common-core-louisiana-gov-bobby-jindal-editorials-debates/8071863|title=Gov. Jindal: Leave education to local control|last1=Jindal|first1=Bobby|date=April 23, 2014|work=USA Today|accessdate=July 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Jindal said that investments in technology would render Common Core obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2015/02/09/bobby-jindal-makes-the-case-for-why-common-core-wont-work-in-tech-terms/ |title=Bobby Jindal Makes the Case for Why Common Core Won't Work, in Tech Terms|last1=Street|first1=Jon|date=February 9, 2015|publisher=theblaze.com|accessdate=February 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jindal proposed budgets that impose cuts on higher education funding in Louisiana, leading to protests from students and education advocates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.2theadvocate.com/blogs/politicsblog/107123234.html|title=Hundreds rally against higher education cuts|accessdate=September 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jindal proposed several controversial education reforms, including vouchers for low income students in public schools to attend private institutions using [[Minimum Foundation Program]] funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Ted Jackson|author2=The Times-Picayune|url=http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2012/03/bobby_jindal_education_bills_w.html|title=Bobby Jindal education bills whisk through Louisiana Senate panel|publisher=NOLA.com|accessdate=August 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legislation also included controversial changes in teacher evaluations, tenure and pensions. Hundreds of teachers, administrators and public education supporters protested against the legislation at the capital of Louisiana,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=MSNBC|url=http://usnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/03/14/10685511-teacher-protest-closes-schools-in-louisiana|title=Teacher protest closes schools in Louisiana|accessdate=August 7, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120519025916/http://usnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/03/14/10685511-teacher-protest-closes-schools-in-louisiana|archivedate=May 19, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; some of whom cancelled classes to attend demonstrations.

Jindal said he believed that every child learns differently. For him, some will accomplish great things in a public school while some will learn better in an online program, and still others will make waves in charter schools, or in parochial schools and dual-enrollment programmes. However, in all these choices, the parents must be trusted to make the best decisions for their children.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes Magazine "2016 Candidates Want You to Know" series.

====Evolution====
Jindal signed a law that permitted teachers at [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]] to supplement standard evolutionary curricula with analysis and critiques that may include [[intelligent design]].&lt;ref name="second"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1668433,00.html|title=The Second Coming of Bobby Jindal|first=Russell|last=McCulley|date=October 4, 2007|work=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law forbids "the promotion of any religious doctrine and will not discriminate against religion or non-religion".

Hospital officials had previously warned that they couldn't make deep cuts without shuttering facilities. Greenstein said the administration's plan did not call for closures, but asked LSU to make structural changes and create efficiencies. The slashing was tied to a congressional reduction in Louisiana's federal Medicaid financing rate. Other cuts fell on hospitals that cared for Medicaid patients. A state-run mental hospital in Mandeville was closed. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111223847/http://www.wwltv.com/news/LSU-health-care-system-takes-brunt-of-Medicaid-cut-162399466.html |archivedate=November 11, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They have three children: Selia Elizabeth, Shaan Robert, and Slade Ryan. Shaan was born with a congenital heart defect and had surgery as an infant. The Jindals have been outspoken advocates for children with congenital defects, particularly those without insurance. In 2006, he and his wife delivered their third child at home, with him receiving medical coaching by phone to deliver their boy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Konieczko|first=Jill|url=https://www.usnews.com/articles/news/campaign-2008/2008/05/22/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-bobby-jindal.html|title="10 Things You Didn't Know About Bobby Jindal"|publisher=Usnews.com|date=May 22, 2008 |accessdate=August 7, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100623072857/http://www.usnews.com/articles/news/campaign-2008/2008/05/22/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-bobby-jindal.html|archivedate=June 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings==
A list of Jindal's published writings up to 2001 can be found in the hearing report for his 2001 U.S. Senate confirmation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?q=75166+site:finance.senate.gov|title=Nominations of Claude Allen, Thomas Scully, Piyush Jindal, Linnet F. Deily, Peter Allgeier, Peter R. Fisher, and James Gurule|accessdate=September 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They include newspaper columns, law review articles, and first authorships in several scientific and policy articles that have appeared in the prominent ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'', ''Journal of the Louisiana State Medical Association'', and ''Hospital Outlook''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/|title=Home - PubMed - NCBI|first=|last=pubmeddev|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jindal's pre-2001 writings include several articles in the ''[[New Oxford Review]]'', one of which later made news during his 2003 gubernatorial race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://politicalwire.com/archives/2003/11/07/jindal_and_satan.html|work=[[Political Wire]]|title=Jindal and Satan|first=Taegan|last=Goddard|date=November 7, 2003|accessdate=June 12, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080830000055/http://politicalwire.com/archives/2003/11/07/jindal_and_satan.html|archivedate=August 30, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In that 1994 article titled "Physical Dimensions of Spiritual Warfare", Jindal described the events leading up to an apparent exorcism of a friend and how he felt unable to help her at the time. However, Jindal questioned whether what he saw was actually an example of "spiritual warfare".&lt;ref name="demon"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jindal|first=Bobby|date=December 1994|url=http://www.newoxfordreview.org/article.jsp?did=1294-jindal|title=Beating A Demon: Physical Dimensions of Spiritual Warfare|work=[[New Oxford Review]]|accessdate=May 12, 2010|quote=I began to think that the demon would only attack me if I tried to pray or fight back....Did I witness spiritual warfare?

In [[physics]], '''Bragg's law''', or '''Wulff–Bragg's condition''', a special case of [[Laue diffraction]], gives the angles for coherent and incoherent [[scattering]] from a crystal lattice. When [[X-ray]]s are incident on an [[atom]], they make the [[electron|electronic cloud]] move, as does any [[electromagnetic wave]]. The [[Motion (physics)|movement]] of these [[electric charge|charges]] re-radiates [[wave]]s with the same [[frequency]], blurred slightly due to a variety of effects; this phenomenon is known as [[Rayleigh scattering]] (or elastic scattering).  The scattered waves can themselves be scattered but this secondary scattering is assumed to be negligible.

A similar process occurs upon scattering neutron waves from the [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] or by a [[Coherence (physics)|coherent]] [[Spin (physics)|spin]] interaction with an unpaired [[electron]]. These re-emitted wave fields [[Interference (wave propagation)|interfere]] with each other either constructively or destructively (overlapping waves either add up together to produce stronger peaks or are subtracted from each other to some degree), producing a diffraction pattern on a detector or film.  The resulting wave interference [[pattern]] is the basis of [[diffraction]] analysis. This analysis is called ''Bragg diffraction''.

== History ==
[[File:Diffusion rayleigh et diffraction.svg|thumb|450px|X-rays interact with the atoms in a [[crystal]].]]

Bragg diffraction (also referred to as the '''Bragg formulation of X-ray diffraction''') was first proposed by [[Lawrence Bragg]] and his father [[William Henry Bragg]] in 1913&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=W.H.|last=Bragg|first2=W.L.|last2=Bragg|journal=Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A|year=1913|volume=88|pages=428–38|authorlink=William Henry Bragg|authorlink2=Lawrence Bragg|title=The Reflexion of X-rays by Crystals|doi=10.1098/rspa.1913.0040|issue=605|bibcode = 1913RSPSA..88..428B }} (Free access)&lt;/ref&gt; in response to their discovery that [[crystal]]line solids produced surprising patterns of reflected [[X-rays]] (in contrast to that of, say, a liquid).  They found that these crystals, at certain specific wavelengths and incident angles, produced intense peaks of reflected radiation. The concept of Bragg diffraction applies equally to [[neutron diffraction]] and [[electron diffraction]] processes.&lt;ref&gt;John M. Cowley (1975) ''Diffraction physics'' (North-Holland, Amsterdam) {{ISBN|0-444-10791-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[neutron]] and X-ray wavelengths are comparable with inter-atomic distances (~&amp;nbsp;150&amp;nbsp;pm) and thus are an excellent probe for this [[length scale]].

[[Image:Braggs Law.svg|thumb|450px|According to the 2''θ'' deviation, the phase shift causes constructive (left figure) or destructive (right figure) interferences.]]

Lawrence Bragg explained this result by modeling the crystal as a set of discrete parallel planes separated by a constant parameter ''d''.  It was proposed that the incident X-ray radiation would produce a Bragg peak if their reflections off the various planes interfered constructively. The interference is constructive when the phase shift is a multiple of 2{{math|&amp;pi;}}; this condition can be expressed by Bragg's law (see ''Bragg condition'' section below) and was first presented by Lawrence Bragg on 11 November 1912 to the [[Cambridge Philosophical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [http://www.encalc.com/?expr=n%20lambda%20%2F%20(2*sin(theta))%20in%20nanometers&amp;var1=n&amp;val1=1&amp;var2=lambda&amp;val2=620%20nm&amp;var3=theta&amp;val3=45%20degrees&amp;var4=&amp;val4= this example calculation]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710191659/http://www.encalc.com/?expr=n%20lambda%20%2F%20%282%2Asin%28theta%29%29%20in%20nanometers&amp;var1=n&amp;val1=1&amp;var2=lambda&amp;val2=620%20nm&amp;var3=theta&amp;val3=45%20degrees&amp;var4=&amp;val4= |date=July 10, 2011  }} of interatomic spacing with Bragg's law.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;There are some sources, like the ''Academic American Encyclopedia'', that attribute the discovery of the law to both W.L Bragg and his father W.H. Bragg, but the [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1915/present.html official Nobel Prize site] and the biographies written about him ("Light Is a Messenger: The Life and Science of William Lawrence Bragg", Graeme K. Hunter, 2004 and "Great Solid State Physicists of the 20th Century", Julio Antonio Gonzalo, Carmen Aragó López) make a clear statement that Lawrence Bragg alone derived the law.&lt;/ref&gt; Although simple, Bragg's law confirmed the existence of real [[Subatomic particle|particle]]s at the atomic scale, as well as providing a powerful new tool for studying [[crystal]]s in the form of X-ray and neutron diffraction. Lawrence Bragg and his father, William Henry Bragg, were awarded the [[Nobel Prize]] in physics in 1915 for their work in determining crystal structures beginning with [[Sodium chloride|NaCl]], [[Zinc sulfide|ZnS]], and [[diamond]]. They are the only father-son team to jointly win. Lawrence Bragg was 25 years old, making him the youngest physics Nobel laureate.

== Bragg condition ==
[[Image:BraggPlaneDiffraction.svg|thumb|400px|Bragg diffraction. Two beams with identical wavelength and phase approach a crystalline solid and are scattered off two different atoms within it. The lower beam traverses an extra length of 2''d''sin''θ''. Constructive interference occurs when this length is equal to an integer multiple of the wavelength of the radiation.]]

Bragg diffraction occurs when radiation, with a wavelength comparable to atomic spacings, is scattered in a [[specular reflection|specular]] fashion by the atoms of a crystalline system, and undergoes constructive interference. For a crystalline solid, the waves are scattered from lattice planes separated by the interplanar distance ''d''.  When the scattered waves [[Interference (wave propagation)|interfere]] constructively, they remain in phase since the difference between the path lengths of the two waves is equal to an [[integer]] multiple of the wavelength.  The path difference between two waves undergoing interference is given by 2''d''sin{{thinsp}}''θ'', where ''θ'' is the scattering angle (see figure on the right).  The effect of the constructive or destructive interference intensifies because of the cumulative effect of reflection in successive [[crystallographic planes]] of the crystalline lattice (as described by [[Miller index|Miller notation]]). This leads to Bragg's law, which describes the condition on ''θ'' for the constructive interference to be at its strongest:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introductory Solid State Physics|author=H. P. Myers|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2002|isbn=0-7484-0660-3|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;2 d\sin\theta=n\lambda \,,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''n'' is a positive integer and ''λ'' is the [[wavelength]] of the incident wave. Note that moving particles, including [[electron]]s, [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s, have an associated wavelength called ''[[de Broglie wavelength]]''. A diffraction pattern is obtained by measuring the intensity of scattered waves as a function of scattering angle.  Very strong intensities known as Bragg peaks are obtained in the diffraction pattern at the points where the scattering angles satisfy Bragg condition. As mentioned in the introduction, this condition is a special case of the more general [[Laue equations]], and the Laue equations can be shown to reduce to the Bragg condition under additional assumptions.

The phenomena of Bragg diffraction by a crystal lattice shares similar characteristics with that of [[thin film interference]], which has an identical condition in the limit where the refractive indices of the surrounding medium (e.g. air) and the interfering medium (e.g. oil) are equal.

== Heuristic derivation ==
Suppose that a single [[monochromatic]] [[wave]] (of any type) is incident on aligned planes of [[Square lattice|lattice]] points, with separation &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;, at angle &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;.  Points '''A''' and '''C''' are on one plane, and '''B''' is on the plane below.  Points '''ABCC'''' form a quadrilateral.
&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Bragg's law.svg|600px]]&lt;/center&gt;

There will be a path difference between the [[ray (optics)|ray]] that gets reflected along '''AC'''' and the ray that gets transmitted along '''AB''', then reflected along '''BC'''. This path difference is
:&lt;math&gt;(AB + BC) - \left(AC'\right) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The two separate waves will arrive at a point with the same [[Phase (waves)|phase]], and hence undergo [[constructive interference]], if and only if this path difference is equal to any integer value of the [[wavelength]], i.e.
:&lt;math&gt;(AB + BC) - \left(AC'\right) = n\lambda \,,&lt;/math&gt;   

where the same definition of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; apply as above.

Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;AB = BC = \frac{d}{\sin\theta} \text{ and } AC = \frac{2d}{\tan\theta} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

from which it follows that
:&lt;math&gt;AC' = AC\cdot\cos\theta = \frac{2d}{\tan\theta}\cos\theta = \left(\frac{2d}{\sin\theta}\cos\theta\right)\cos\theta = \frac{2d}{\sin\theta}\cos^2\theta \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Putting everything together,
:&lt;math&gt;n\lambda = \frac{2d}{\sin\theta} - \frac{2d}{\tan\theta}\cos\theta = \frac{2d}{\sin\theta}\left(1 - \cos^2\theta\right) = \frac{2d}{\sin\theta}\sin^2\theta&lt;/math&gt;

which simplifies to &lt;math&gt;n\lambda = 2d\sin\theta \,,&lt;/math&gt; which is Bragg's law.

If only two planes of atoms were diffracting, as shown in the pictures, then the transition from constructive to destructive interference would be gradual as a function of angle, with gentle [[maxima and minima|maxima]] at the Bragg angles. However, since many atomic planes are interfering in real materials, very sharp peaks surrounded by mostly destructive interference result.&lt;ref&gt;[http://electrons.wikidot.com/x-ray-diffraction-and-bragg-s-law ''x-ray diffraction, Bragg's law and Laue equation''] on [http://electrons.wikidot.com electrons.wikidot.com].&lt;/ref&gt;

A rigorous derivation from the more general Laue equations is available (see page: [[Laue equations]]).

== Bragg scattering of visible light by colloids ==
A [[colloidal crystal]] is a highly [[Order (crystal lattice)|ordered]] array of particles that forms over a long range (from a few [[millimeters]] to one [[centimeter]] in length); colloidal crystals have appearance and properties roughly [[analogous]] to their atomic or molecular counterparts.&lt;ref name='Pieranski_1983'&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Colloidal Crystals|journal=Contemporary Physics|year=1983|first=P|last=Pieranski|volume=24|issue=|pages=25 |url=|doi=10.1080/00107518308227471 |bibcode = 1983ConPh..24...25P }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been known for many years that, due to [[Coulomb's law|repulsive]] [[Coulombic]] interactions, [[electrically charged]] [[macromolecules]] in an [[aqueous]] environment can exhibit long-range [[crystal]]-like correlations, with interparticle separation distances often being considerably greater than the individual particle diameter. Periodic arrays of spherical particles give rise to [[Vacancy defect|interstitial voids]] (the spaces between the particles), which act as a natural [[diffraction grating]] for [[visible spectrum|visible light waves]], when the interstitial spacing is of the same [[order of magnitude]] as the [[angle of incidence (optics)|incident]] lightwave.&lt;ref name='Hiltner_1969'&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Diffraction of Light by Ordered Suspensions|journal=Journal of Physical Chemistry|year=1969|first=PA|last=Hiltner|author2=IM Krieger|volume=73|issue=|pages=2306 |url=|doi=10.1021/j100727a049}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Aksay_1984'&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Microstructural Control through Colloidal Consolidation|journal=Proceedings of the American Ceramic Society|year=1984|first=IA|last=Aksay|volume=9|issue=|pages=94 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luck, W. et al., Ber. Busenges Phys. Chem. , Vol. 67, p.84 (1963).&lt;/ref&gt; In these cases in nature, brilliant [[iridescence]] (or play of colours) is attributed to the diffraction and [[constructive interference]] of visible lightwaves according to Bragg’s law, in a matter analogous to the [[scattering]] of [[X-rays]] in crystalline solid. The effects occur at visible wavelengths because the separation parameter ''d'' is much larger than for true crystals.

== Volume Bragg gratings ==
Volume Bragg gratings (VBG) or volume holographic gratings (VHG) consist of a volume where there is a periodic change in the [[refractive index]]. Depending on the orientation of the modulation of the refractive index, VBG can be used either to [[Transmission coefficient|transmit]] or [[Reflection (physics)|reflect]] a small bandwidth of [[wavelengths]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barden|first1=S.C.|last2=Williams|first2=J.B.|last3=Arns|first3=J.A.|last4=Colburn|first4=W.S.|title=Tunable Gratings: Imaging the Universe in 3-D with Volume-Phase Holographic Gratings (Review)|journal=ASP Conf. Ser.|date=2000|volume=195|page=552}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bragg's law (adapted for volume hologram) dictates which wavelength will be diffracted:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=C. Kress|first1=Bernard|title=Applied Digital Optics : From Micro-optics to Nanophotonics|date=2009|isbn=978-0-470-02263-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;2n\Lambda\sin(\theta + \varphi)=\lambda_B \,,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''n'' is a positive integer, ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; the diffracted [[wavelength]], ''Λ'' the step of the grating, ''θ'' the angle between the incident beam and the normal ('''N''') of the entrance surface and ''φ'' the angle between the normal and the grating vector ('''K&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;'''). Radiation that does not match Bragg's law will pass through the VBG undiffracted. The output wavelength can be tuned over a few hundred nanometers by changing the incident angle (''θ''). VBG are being used to produce [[Tunable laser#Widely tunable lasers|widely tunable laser]] source or perform global [[Hyperspectral imaging|hyperspectral imagery]] (see [[Photon etc.]]).

== Selection rules and practical crystallography ==
Bragg's law, as stated above, can be used to obtain the lattice spacing of a particular [[cubic system]] through the following relation:

: &lt;math&gt;d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + \ell^2}} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the lattice spacing of the [[cubic crystal]], and ''h'', ''k'', and ''ℓ'' are the [[Miller indices]] of the Bragg plane. Combining this relation with Bragg's law:

: &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\lambda}{2a}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{\lambda}{2d}\right)^2 \frac{1}{h^2 + k^2 + \ell^2}&lt;/math&gt;

{| class="wikitable"

These selection rules can be used for any crystal with the given crystal structure. KCl has a face-centered cubic [[Bravais lattice]].  However, the K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and the Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ion have the same number of electrons and are quite close in size, so that the diffraction pattern becomes essentially the same as for a simple cubic structure with half the lattice parameter.  Selection rules for other structures can be referenced elsewhere, or [[structure factor|derived]]. Lattice spacing for the other [[crystal system]]s can be found [[crystal structure#Interplanar spacing|here]].

'''Central Electricity Regulatory Commission''' ('''CERC'''), a key regulator of power sector in India, is a [[Statutory corporation#India|statutory body]] functioning with [[quasi-judicial]] status under sec – 76 of the [[Electricity Act (2003)|Electricity Act 2003]]. CERC was initially constituted on 24 July 1998 under the [[Ministry of Power (India)|Ministry of Power’s]] Electricity Regulatory Commissions Act, 1998 for rationalization of [[electricity tariff]]s, transparent policies regarding subsidies, promotion of efficient and environmentally benign policies, and for matters connected Electricity Tariff regulation. CERC was instituted primarily to regulate the tariff of [[Power generation|Power Generating]] companies owned or controlled by the government of India, and any other generating company which has a composite scheme for [[power generation]] and interstate [[Power transmission|transmission of energy]], including tariffs of generating companies.

==History==
On 2 July 1998, recognizing the needs for reforms in the electricity sector nationwide, the [[Central government of India]] moved forward to enact the Electricity Regulatory Commission Act of 1998,&lt;ref name="IE"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.indianexpress.com/res/web/pIe/ie/daily/19980727/20850304.html | title= Power regulatory body formed to fix tariff| author= Indian Express (27 July 1998)  | accessdate=14 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which mandated the creation of the Central Electricity Regulation Commission with the charge of setting the tariff of centrally owned or controlled generation companies. Ministry of Power, India, has published the Electricity Regulatory Commissions Act, 1998.&lt;ref name="MOPCERC"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.powermin.nic.in/acts_notification/central_regulatory_preliminary.htm | title= Electricity Regulatory Commissions Act | author= Ministry of Power, Govt of India (2 July 1998) | accessdate= 14 July 2010 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090619092535/http%3A//powermin.nic.in/acts_notification/central_regulatory_preliminary.htm | archivedate= 19 June 2009 | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from CERC, the act also introduced a provision for the states to create the State Electricity Regulation Commission [http://www.emt-india.net/banner/StateElectricityUtilities.htm (SERC)] along with the power to set the tariffs without having to enact separate state laws.

Mr.S.L.Rao was the first Chairman of CERC (1998–2001).&lt;ref name="RP"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.reliancepower.co.in/html/board.html | title= First Chairman of CERC | author= Reliance Power | accessdate= 14 July 2010 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090904171334/http://www.reliancepower.co.in/html/board.html | archivedate= 4 September 2009 | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During March 2004, Indian Institute of Management – Ahmedabad [[Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad|(IIM-A)]] called for the merger of the Central Electricity Authority [[Central Electricity Authority (India) | (CEA)]] and Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) on the grounds that technical and economic regulatory functions need to be carried out in close coordination.&lt;ref name="IIM"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.financialexpress.com/news/power-ministry-says-no-to-iima-idea-of-ceacerc-merger/94168/| title=MoU proposal for CERC and FERC | author= Financial Express (5 March 2004)  | accessdate=14 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the Electricity Act [[Electricity Act (2003)|(EA) 2003]] envisages separate identity for CERC and CEA, and there is a necessity for separation in the short run, the two regulators should be merged eventually, as there are substantial synergies between them. But Ministry of Power rejected IIM-A’s recommendations in this regard and observed that the tariff fixation is in the exclusive domain of electricity regulatory commissions (ERCs), and no other entity or government has any role in this regard.

On 1 September 2009, CERC has entered into an Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with world-renowned USA’s [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]] for Development and regulatory oversight of Power market, Grid Reliability, Energy Efficiency, Transmission and Distribution services in India.&lt;ref name="FERC"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.ferc.gov/legal/maj-ord-reg/mou/mou-india.pdf | title= MoU Between CERC and FERC | author= Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (9 November 2009) | accessdate= 14 July 2010 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100606205031/https://www.ferc.gov/legal/maj-ord-reg/mou/mou-india.pdf | archivedate= 6 June 2010 | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution of Electricity Tariff &amp; Role of CERC==

===Single part tariff===
A system of single-part tariffs was in vogue in India for pricing of thermal power, prior to 1992. The single-part tariff for a station was calculated to cover both the fixed cost as well as the variable (energy) cost at a certain (normative) generation level.

'''Demerit:'''
# Energy production above the normative generation level yielded additional revenue. i.e., a surplus over the fixed and variable cost of the station.
# The incentive and disincentive for power generation got linearly linked to the annual [[Plant Load Factor]] (PLF) of the generating station.

===Two part tariff for Generation as per K.P. Rao Committee (1992)===
Finding that the single-part tariff, particularly for Central generating stations, was conducive neither to economic generation of power as per merit-order, nor to satisfactory operation of the regional grids, the government of India adopted in 1992 a two-part tariff formula for [[National Thermal Power Corporation|NTPC]] stations based on the recommendations of the KP Rao Committee.

Recognizing that there would be no motivation on the part of NTPC (Central generating stations) to maintain a high level of efficiency and availability if it was paid the full fixed cost irrespective of level of generation and variable cost for the quantum of energy actually generated, the K.P. Rao Committee had recommended a scheme of incentive/disincentive, as a variant of a simple two-part tariff. The scheme provided for linking of incentive and disincentive with ''Plant Load Factor (PLF)'' plus ''deemed generation'', which in effect is ''[[Availability factor|Plant availability]]''.&lt;ref name="NTPCFM"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1802/18020480.htm | title= Availability Based Tariff | author = Frontline Magazine,the Hindu (20 January 2001)|accessdate=16 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evolution of Availability Based Tariff (ABT) ===

The serious problems of regional grid operation however continued even after 1992. This was because the K.P. Rao Committee had been able to tackle only one end; the Central generation side. Overdrawals by some State Electricity Board's during peak-load hours and under-drawals during off-peak hours continued unabated, causing serious frequency excursions and peretual operational/commercial disputes.

In the year 1994, M/s ECC of USA were commissioned under a grant from [[Asian Development Bank]] to undertake a comprehensive study of the Indian power system and recommend a suitable tariff structure.ECC submitted their report in February, 1994, recommending Availability Tariff for generating stations, which was accepted in principle by [[Government of India|GOI]] in November, 1994. A National Task Force (NTF) was constituted by the Ministry of Power in February, 1995 to oversee the implementation of ECC’s recommendations. Based on NTF deliberations between 1995 and 1998, Ministry of Power had crystallized the formulation for the so-called [[Availability-based tariff]] (ABT).&lt;ref name="ABTMOP"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.powermin.nic.in/distribution/availability_based_tariff.htm | title= Availability Based Tariff | author= Ministry of Power | accessdate= 16 July 2010 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100928194846/http://powermin.nic.in/distribution/availability_based_tariff.htm | archivedate= 28 September 2010 | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the spirit of the Electricity Regulatory Commissions Act 1998 and consequent upon transfer of relevant powers vested under section 43 A (2) of the Electricity (Supply) Act 1948 to the CERC with effect from 15 May 1999, GOI forwarded the above draft ABT notification to CERC vide OM dated 31.5.1999 for finalization after due deliberation. The draft notification was then issued through a public notice and comments/objections were invited. The Commission in July 1999 held detailed hearings on the above. The ABT order dated 4 January 2000 of the Commission departs significantly from the draft notification as also from the prevailing tariff design

==Standard Tariff Model==
Tariff for supply of electricity shall comprise two parts: 
# Fixed or Capacity Charges (For recovery of Annual Fixed Cost)
# Energy or Variable Charges (For recovery of Primary Fuel Cost wherever applicable)

The annual fixed cost (AFC) of a generating station or a transmission system shall consist of the following components&lt;ref name="nkasdgfn"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.rediff.com/money/2004/mar/29cerc.htm | title=CERC announces new tariff norms | author= Rediff Business (29 March 2004)  | accessdate=14 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Return on equity [[Return on Equity|(RoE)]];
# Interest on loan capital;
# [[Depreciation]];
# Interest on [[Working capital]];
# [[Operation and maintenance]] expenses;
# Cost of secondary fuel oil (for Coal-based &amp; Lignite fired generating stations);
# Special allowance for renovation and modernisation or separate compensation allowance, wherever applicable.

The Energy charge shall cover the primary fuel cost and limestone consumption cost
(where applicable), and shall be payable by every beneficiary for the total energy scheduled to
be supplied to such beneficiary with fuel and limestone price adjustment

==Relation with Other Power Sector Bodies (MoP,CEA, Appellate Tribunal)==

=== Appellate Tribunal and CERC ===
[http://aptel.gov.in/index.htm  Appellate Tribunal] for Electricity has been established by Central Government for those who are not satisfied with the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission order or with a state.&lt;ref name="oydtudgf"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.powermin.nic.in/ministry_of_power/statutory_bodies1.htm| title= APTEL and its Relation with CERC &amp; SERC| author= Ministry of Power, Government of India| accessdate= 15 July 2010| deadurl= yes| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100929024233/http://powermin.nic.in/ministry_of_power/statutory_bodies1.htm| archivedate= 29 September 2010| df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tribunal has the authority to overrule or amend that order, just like the Income-Tax tribunal or the Central Administrative Tribunal.  The tribunal has to be approached within 45 days of the aggrieved person from getting the order.

=== Central Electricity Authority (CEA) and CERC ===
Since 1 April 1999 CEA has entrusted CERC with the task of regulating power tariffs of central government power utilities, inter-state generating companies, inter-state transmission tariffs. Section −76 of [[Electricity Act (2003)|Electricity Act, 2003]] stipulates that CERC shall consist of a Chairperson and three other Members. And one of the CERC members (Ex-Officio) has to be Chairman of CEA.&lt;br&gt;In Indian Power Sector, CEA takes care of: 
# '''Planning Regulation''' where power demand and supply gap has to be regulated.
# '''Construction regulation''' where Construction of thermal-, hydro-, gas-based power plants and power systems are regulated in the right manner.
Whereas CERC take care of third aspect of power sector regulation -&lt;br&gt; 
:3.'''Tariff regulation''', a purely economic exercise.
National electricity policy is normally formulated in consultation with and taking into account the views of the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC), Central Electricity Authority (CEA), and state governments.&lt;ref name="wdtwef"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.powermin.nic.in/indian_electricity_scenario/national_electricity_policy.htm| title= Formulation of National Electricity Policy| author= Ministry of Power, Government of India| accessdate= 15 July 2010| deadurl= yes| archiveurl= http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090619062031/http%3A//powermin.nic.in/indian_electricity_scenario/national_electricity_policy.htm| archivedate= 19 June 2009| df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SERC and CERC===
CERC and State Electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC) are the two electricity regulators – one operating at the central level and the other at various state levels. CERC’s primary function was to regulate the tariffs of central generating stations as well as for all interstate generation, transmission and supply of power. Whereas SERC’s primary function was to determine bulk and retail tariffs to be charged to customers, regulate the operations of intrastate transmission, including those of the State Load Despatch Center (SLDC).
During Parliamentary Standing Committee on Energy in the year 2001,&lt;ref name="PSC"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/cerc8217s-role-needs-to-be-reviewed-panel/170756/| title= Benches of CERC instead of having a SERC in each state | work= Business Standard |date=19 June 2001  | accessdate=15 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; SERC being established in states, for formulating standards relating to quality, continuity and reliability of service for the electricity industry have failed in their efforts. There was a proposal of having benches of the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) in five to six locations instead of having a SERC in each state, but the Committee that has rejected the proposal stating it was not possible unless states were willing to accept such a proposal.

===Ministry of Power and CERC===
MoP entrusts CERC for providing [http://www.cercind.gov.in/08022007/Justification_date_3.5.2006.pdf  escalation rate] for coal and gas, ''[[inflation rate]]'' based on ''[[Wholesale price index|WPI]]'' and ''[[Consumer price index|CPI]]'', ''discount rate'', and ''dollar-rupee [[Tables of historical exchange rates to the USD|exchange variation rate]]'' for the purpose tariff determination.&lt;ref name="vbnqwfC"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.cercind.gov.in/Escalation-rate/Notification-dated-31.3.2010.pdf| title= Notification of Annual Escalation Rates as per Ministry of Power (MOP) instruction| author= Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (31 March 2010)  | accessdate=15 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Power Exchange Companies and CERC===
Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) has issued the Power Market Regulations, 2010&lt;ref name="IEX"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://cercind.gov.in/Regulations/Press_Release_20.01.pdf| title= CERC notifies Power Market Regulations | author= Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (20 January 2010)  | accessdate=15 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which will govern transactions related to ‘'Energy trading'’ by companies like Indian Energy Exchange [http://www.iexindia.com/ (IEX)], Power Exchange India [https://web.archive.org/web/20100329161015/http://www.powerexindia.com/ (PXI)], National Power Exchange [http://www.npex.in/ (NPX)]  in various contracts related to electricity.
The regulations have been issued by the CERC in exercise of its powers under section 66 of the Electricity Act, 2003, which is aimed at taking measures conducive to development of the electricity industry, promoting competition therein, protecting interest of consumers and enhancing supply of electricity.

'''Construction paper''' (also called '''sugar paper''') is a tough, coarse, coloured [[paper]]. The texture is slightly rough, and the surface is unfinished. Due to the source material, mainly [[wood pulp]], small particles are visible on the paper's surface. It is used for projects or crafts.

The origin of the term "sugar paper" lies in its use for making bags to contain sugar. It is related to the "blue paper" used by [[confectionery]] bakers from the 17th century England onwards; for example, in the baking of [[Georgian era|Regency]] [[ratafia]] cakes (or [[macaroons]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Dictionary of Traded Goods and Commodities, 1550-1820| year=2007| publisher=British History online| accessdate=2007-11-24| url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=58889#s6| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107051035/http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=58889#s6| archivedate=2012-11-07| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The animated television series ''[[Blue's Clues]]'' and ''[[South Park]]'' (initially) were made using construction paper and [[stop motion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Driver |first=Dustin |url=https://www.apple.com/pro/profiles/southpark/ |title=South Park Studios: No Walk in the Park |publisher=[[Apple.com]] |date=1999-03-26 |accessdate=2011-11-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017233253/http://www.apple.com/pro/profiles/southpark/ |archivedate=2011-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term "construction paper" was associated with the material in the early 20th century, although the general process for creating the paper began in the late 19th century when industrialized paper production and synthetic dye technology were combined. Around that time, construction paper was primarily advertised for classroom settings as an effective canvas for supporting multiple drawing media. The process for creating the paper involved a machine oriented process that exposed the paper to dyes while it was still pulp, resulting in a thorough distribution and brilliance of colour. The primary dyes involved in producing construction paper were abundant until Germany, the main producer of aniline for dyes at the time, became involved in [[World War I]] and ceased its exports. The shortage marked a period in which construction paper was created using substitute colouring methods.&lt;ref name=Irving&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/v16/bp16-07.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126161429/http://www.cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/v16/bp16-07.html |archivedate=2012-01-26 |df= }} Construction Paper: A Brief History of Impermanence&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dyeing==
One of the defining features of construction paper is the radiance of its colours. Before the methodology behind construction paper's colouring was introduced, most paper was coloured by [[Pigment|pigments]] and [[vegetable oil]], which had weaker staining capabilities. Synthetic dyes were later developed, which provided a wider range of colours, stronger dyeing strength, and had lower costs. However, the colours given by synthetic dyes tend to fade over short periods of time, an effect often seen in construction paper, noted by greying colours and brittleness.&lt;ref name=Irving/&gt;

The '''December 2009 North American blizzard''' was a powerful [[nor'easter]] that formed over the [[Gulf of Mexico]] in December 2009, and became a major snowstorm that affected the [[East Coast of the United States]] and [[Atlantic Canada|Canadian Atlantic provinces]]. The snowstorm brought record-breaking December snowfall totals to [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Baltimore]], and [[Philadelphia]].

The [[blizzard]] disrupted several regions, and in some areas the snowfall rate prevented [[snow plow]]s from maintaining the roads. The blizzard caused flights and trains to be canceled, and left areas without power. Kentucky, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, and [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle]] and [[Kent County, Delaware|Kent]] counties in Delaware declared a [[state of emergency]]. Seven deaths were reported to have been caused by the storm.

==Formation==
On December 16, 2009, [[meteorologist]]s identified a storm forming in the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;ref name="Philly"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/news/homepage/79707747.html |title=Better watch out: Snow looks to reign |last1=Wood |first1=Anthony R. |last2=Colimore |first2=Edward |website=The Philadelphia Inquirer |accessdate=December 19, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091222093235/http://www.philly.com/philly/news/homepage/79707747.html |archivedate=December 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It produced record [[rain]]fall in regions of [[Texas]] and had the potential to strengthen as it moved through [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[Florida]] and further north.

[[Super Saturday]], the last Saturday before Christmas, typically nets $15&amp;nbsp;billion in retail sales.&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704376704574605820236262190?mod=WSJ_hpp_LEFTTopStories|last1=Dodes|first1=Rachel|last2=Zimmerman|first2=Ann|website=The Wall Street Journal|title=Snowstorm Threatens 'Super Saturday' Sales | date=December 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that 30% of this revenue comes from the [[northeastern United States]].&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/feeds/reuters/2009/12/19/2009-12-19T234923Z_01_N19218543_RTRIDST_0_HOLIDAYSALES-SUPERSATURDAY-UPDATE-3-PIX.html |title=Storm threatens U.S. retailers' last holiday push |last1=Baertlein |first1=Lisa |last2=Klayman |first2=Ben |publisher=Forbes |accessdate=December 20, 2009 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stores that managed to open saw reduced traffic.&lt;ref name="LFP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lfpress.com/news/london/2009/12/19/12214646.html|author=Hank Daniszewski|title=Tis the Season of Bargains|publisher=London Free Press|accessdate=December 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The storm resulted in an estimated loss of $2 billion in retail sales.&lt;ref name="Super Saturday Losses"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/12/21/AR2009122103206.html|website=The Washington Post|author=Ylan Q.

Due to widespread accumulation of heavy snow, the storm was ranked as a high-end Category 2 ("significant") winter storm, on the [[Northeast Snowfall Impact Scale]]. The ranking is based on the amount of snowfall, the area, and the population affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/snow-and-ice/nesis.php |title=The Northeast Snowfall Impact Scale (NESIS) |publisher=Ncdc.noaa.gov |accessdate=January 15, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105064938/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/snow-and-ice/nesis.php |archivedate=January 5, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New Jersey ===
New Jersey's major towns and cities were particularly hard hit with snow and some rain coming onshore. During the day, rain inundated the coastline as temperatures were not cold enough for snow. Around 5 P.M, heavy snow pushed the rain offshore, making for blizzard conditions along the coast. In New Jersey, anywhere from 2 to 20 inches of snow fell. During the height of the storm, power was knocked out in places from [[Paterson, New Jersey]] to [[Cape May, New Jersey]].

=== New York City ===
New York City was put under a blizzard warning during the height of the storm. Winds of up to 60&amp;nbsp;mph knocked out power in the NYC Metro. Nearby towns in New Jersey and on Long Island experienced the brunt of the storm along with New York City.

'''Diamond-like carbon''' ('''DLC''') is a class of [[amorphous carbon]] material that displays some of the typical properties of [[diamond]]. DLC is usually applied as coatings to other materials that could benefit from some of those properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0927-796X(02)00005-0| title = Diamond-like amorphous carbon| journal = Materials Science and Engineering: R: Reports| volume = 37| issue = 4–6| pages = 129–281| year = 2002| last1 = Robertson | first1 = J. | authorlink1 = John Robertson (physicist)| citeseerx = 10.1.1.620.3187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DLC exists in seven different forms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ist.fraunhofer.de/english/c-products/tab/complete.html Name Index of Carbon Coatings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070120054517/http://www.ist.fraunhofer.de/english/c-products/tab/complete.html |date=2007-01-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All seven contain significant amounts of sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; [[orbital hybridization|hybridized]] [[carbon]] atoms. The reason that there are different types is that even diamond can be found in two crystalline polytypes. The more common one has its carbon atoms arranged in a [[cubic crystal system|cubic lattice]], while the less common one, [[lonsdaleite]], has a [[hexagonal crystal system|hexagonal lattice]]. By mixing these polytypes in various ways at the nanoscale level of structure, DLC coatings can be made that at the same time are amorphous, flexible, and yet purely sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; bonded "diamond". The hardest, strongest, and slickest is such a mixture, known as '''tetrahedral amorphous carbon''' (ta-C). {{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} For example a coating of only 2 μm thickness of ''ta-C'' increases the resistance of common (e.g., type 304) [[stainless steel]] against abrasive wear, changing its lifetime in such service from one week to 85 years. {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} Such ''ta-C'' can be considered to be the "pure" form of DLC, since it consists only of sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; bonded carbon atoms. Fillers such as [[hydrogen]], graphitic sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; carbon, and metals are used in the other 6 forms to reduce production expenses or to impart other desirable properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.triboint.2008.06.011|title=Tribological behavior of tungsten-doped DLC coating under oil lubrication|author=Kržan, B.|journal=Tribology International|volume=42|year=2009|pages=229–235|issue=2|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|doi=10.1109/IVMC.2001.939770|title=Silicon doped diamond-like carbon films as a coating forimprovement of electron field emission|author=Evtukh, A.A|journal=Proceedings of the 14th International Vacuum Microelectronics Conference|year=2001|page=295|display-authors=etal|isbn=978-0-7803-7197-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The various forms of DLC can be applied to almost any material that is compatible with a vacuum environment. In 2006, the market for outsourced DLC coatings was estimated as about 30,000,000 € in the [[European Union]]. In October 2011, ''Science Daily'' reported that researchers at [[Stanford University]] have created a super-hard amorphous diamond under conditions of ultrahigh pressure, which lacks the [[crystal]]line structure of [[diamond]] but has the light weight characteristic of [[carbon]].&lt;ref name=twsOctU&gt;{{cite news

==Distinction from natural and synthetic diamond==
Naturally occurring diamond is almost always found in the crystalline form with a purely [[cubic crystal system|cubic orientation]] of sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; bonded carbon atoms. Sometimes there are lattice defects or inclusions of atoms of other elements that give color to the stone, but the lattice arrangement of the carbons remains cubic and bonding is purely sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The internal energy of the cubic polytype is slightly lower than that of the [[Hexagonal crystal system|hexagonal form]] and growth rates from molten material in both natural and bulk [[synthetic diamond]] production methods are slow enough that the lattice structure has time to grow in the lowest energy (cubic) form that is possible for sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; bonding of carbon atoms. In contrast, DLC is typically produced by processes in which high energy precursive carbons (''e.g.'' in [[plasma (physics)|plasmas]], in filtered [[cathodic arc deposition]], in [[sputter deposition]] and in [[ion beam deposition]]) are rapidly cooled or quenched on relatively cold surfaces. In those cases cubic and hexagonal lattices can be randomly intermixed, layer by atomic layer, because there is no time available for one of the crystalline geometries to grow at the expense of the other before the atoms are "frozen" in place in the material. [[Amorphous]] DLC coatings can result in materials that have no long-range crystalline order. Without long range order there are no brittle fracture planes, so such coatings are flexible and conformal to the underlying shape being coated, while still being as hard as diamond. In fact this property has been exploited to study atom-by-atom wear at the nanoscale in DLC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nanowerk.com/spotlight/spotid=14827.php|title=Achieving ultralow nanoscale wear of one atom per micrometer|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
[[Image:Ta C structure.jpg|thumb|right|[[Scanning electron microscope|SEM]] image of a gold-coated replica of a ta-C "diamond-like" coating. Structural elements are not crystallites but are nodules of sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-bonded carbon atoms. The grains are so small that the surface appears mirror smooth to the eye.]]

There are several methods producing DLC, which rely on the lower density of sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; than sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; carbon. So the application of pressure, impact, [[catalysis]], or some combination of these at the atomic scale can force sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; bonded carbon atoms closer together into sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; bonds. This must be done vigorously enough that the atoms cannot simply spring back apart into separations characteristic of sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; bonds. Usually techniques either combine such a compression with a push of the new cluster of sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; bonded carbon deeper into the coating so that there is no room for expansion back to separations needed for sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; bonding; or the new cluster is buried by the arrival of new carbon destined for the next cycle of impacts. It is reasonable to envisage the process as a "hail" of projectiles that produce localized, faster, [[Nanotechnology|nanoscale]] versions of the classic combinations of heat and pressure that produce natural and synthetic diamond. Because they occur independently at many places across the surface of a growing film or coating, they tend to produce an analog of a [[cobblestone]] street with the cobbles being nodules or clusters of sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; bonded carbon. Depending upon the particular "recipe" being used, there are cycles of deposition of carbon and impact or continuous proportions of new carbon arriving and projectiles conveying the impacts needed to force the formation of the sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; bonds. As a result, ''ta-C'' may have the structure of a cobblestone street, or the nodules may "melt together" to make something more like a [[sponge]] or the cobbles may be so small as to be nearly invisible to imaging. A classic "medium" morphology for a ''ta-C'' film is shown in the figure.

==Properties==
As implied by the name, diamond-like carbon (DLC), the value of such coatings accrues from their ability to provide some of the properties of diamond to surfaces of almost any material. The primary desirable qualities are hardness, wear resistance, and slickness (DLC film [[friction coefficient]] against polished steel ranges from 0.05 to 0.20 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.richterprecision.com/dlc-coatings.html|title=DLC Coatings - Diamond-Like Carbon Coatings - Titankote - HIPIMS technology|website=www.richterprecision.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;). DLC properties highly depends on [[plasma treatment]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/crat.201300171 | volume=49 | title=Argon plasma treatment on metal substrates and effects on diamond-like carbon (DLC) coating properties | journal=Crystal Research and Technology | pages=55–62| year=2014 | last1=Wasy | first1=Abdul | last2=Balakrishnan | first2=G. | last3=Lee | first3=S.

However, which properties are added to a surface and to what degree depends upon which of the 7 forms are applied, and further upon the amounts and types of diluents added to reduce the cost of production. In 2006 the Association of German Engineers, [[Verein Deutscher Ingenieure|VDI]], the largest engineering association in Western Europe issued an authoritative report VDI2840 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vdi.de/vdi/presse/mitteilungen_details/index.php?ID=1015889|title=Pressemitteilungen|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to clarify the existing multiplicity of confusing terms and trade names. It provides a unique classification and nomenclature for diamond-like-carbon (DLC) and diamond films. It succeeded in reporting all information necessary to identify and to compare different DLC films which are offered on the market. Quoting from that document:&lt;blockquote&gt;These [sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;] bonds can occur not only with crystals - in other words, in solids with long-range order - but also in amorphous solids where the atoms are in a random arrangement. In this case there will be bonding only between a few individual atoms and not in a long-range order extending over a large number of atoms. The bond types have a considerable influence on the material properties of amorphous carbon films. If the sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; type is predominant the film will be softer, if the sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; type is predominant the film will be harder.&lt;/blockquote&gt; A secondary determinant of quality was found to be the fractional content of hydrogen. Some of the production methods involve hydrogen or [[methane]] as a catalyst and a considerable percentage of hydrogen can remain in the finished DLC material. When it is recalled that the soft plastic, [[polyethylene]] is made from carbon that is bonded purely by the diamond-like sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; bonds, but also includes chemically bonded hydrogen, it is not surprising to learn that fractions of hydrogen remaining in DLC films degrade them almost as much as do residues of sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; bonded carbon. The VDI2840 report confirmed the utility of locating a particular DLC material onto a 2-dimensional map on which the X-axis described the fraction of hydrogen in the material and the Y-axis described the fraction of sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; bonded carbon atoms. The highest quality of diamond-like properties was affirmed to be correlated with the proximity of the map [[point plotting]] the (X,Y) coordinates of a particular material to the upper left corner at (0,1), namely 0% hydrogen and 100% sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; bonding. That "pure" DLC material is ''ta-C'' and others are approximations that are degraded by diluents such as hydrogen, sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; bonded carbon, and metals. Valuable properties of materials that are ''ta-C'', or nearly ''ta-C'' follow.

===Hardness===
[[Image:Ta C wear (original).jpg|thumb|right|[[Scanning Tunneling Microscope|STM]] image of surfaces at the edge of a 1 μm thick layer of ''ta-C'' "diamond-like" coating on 304 stainless steel after various durations of tumbling in a slurry of 240 mesh SiC abrasive. The first 100 min shows a burnishing away from the coating of an overburden of soft carbons than had been deposited after the last cycle of impacts converted bonds to sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. On the uncoated part of the sample, about 5 μm of steel were removed during subsequent tumbling while the coating completely protected the part of the sample it covered.]]

Within the "cobblestones", nodules, clusters, or "sponges" (the volumes in which local bonding is sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) bond angles may be distorted from those found in either pure cubic or hexagonal lattices because of intermixing of the two. The result is internal (compressive) stress that can appear to add to the hardness measured for a sample of DLC. Hardness is often measured by [[nanoindentation]] methods in which a finely pointed stylus of natural diamond is forced into the surface of a specimen. If the sample is so thin that there is only a single layer of nodules, then the stylus may enter the DLC layer between the hard cobblestones and push them apart without sensing the hardness of the sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; bonded volumes. Measurements would be low. Conversely, if the probing stylus enters a film thick enough to have several layers of nodules so it cannot be spread laterally, or if it enters on top of a cobblestone in a single layer, then it will measure not only the real hardness of the diamond bonding, but an apparent hardness even greater because the internal compressive stress in those nodules would provide further resistance to penetration of the material by the stylus. [[Nanoindentation]] measurements have reported hardness as great as 50% more than values for natural crystalline diamond. Since the stylus is blunted in such cases or even broken, actual numbers for hardness that exceed that of natural diamond are meaningless. They only show that the hard parts of an optimal ''ta-C'' material will break natural diamond rather than the inverse. Nevertheless, from a practical viewpoint it does not matter how the resistance of a DLC material is developed, it can be harder than natural diamond in usage. One method of testing the coating hardness is by means of the [[Persoz pendulum]].

===Bonding of DLC coatings===
The same internal stress that benefits the hardness of DLC materials makes it difficult to bond such coatings to the substrates to be protected. The internal stresses try to "pop" the DLC coatings off of the underlying samples. This challenging downside of extreme hardness is answered in several ways, depending upon the particular "art" of the production process. The most simple is to exploit the natural chemical bonding that happens in cases in which incident carbon ions supply the material to be impacted into sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; bonded carbon atoms and the impacting energies that are compressing carbon volumes condensed earlier. In this case the first carbon ions will impact the surface of the item to be coated. If that item is made of a [[carbide]]-forming substance such as [[titanium|Ti]] or [[iron|Fe]] in [[steel]] a layer of carbide will be formed that is later bonded to the DLC grown on top of it. Other methods of bonding include such strategies as depositing intermediate layers that have atomic spacings that grade from those of the substrate to those characteristic of sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; bonded carbon. In 2006 there were as many successful recipes for bonding DLC coatings as there were sources of DLC.

===Tribology===
DLC coatings are often used to prevent wear due to their excellent [[tribology|tribological]] properties. DLC is very resistant to abrasive and adhesive wear making it suitable for use in applications that experience extreme contact pressure, both in rolling and sliding contact. DLC is often used to prevent wear on razor blades and metal cutting tools, including lathe inserts and [[milling cutter]]s. DLC is used in [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearing]]s, [[cam]]s, cam followers, and shafts in the automobile industry. The coatings reduce wear during the 'break-in' period, where drive train components may be starved for [[lubrication]].

DLCs may also be used in [[chameleon coating]]s that are designed to prevent wear during launch, orbit, and re-entry of land-launched space vehicles. DLC provides lubricity at ambient atmosphere and at vacuum unlike graphite, which requires moisture to be lubricious. Isolated carbon particles embedded diamond-like carbon coatings are the recent development &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.triboint.2017.04.008 | volume=114 | title=A preliminary wear studies of isolated carbon particles embedded diamond-like carbon coatings | journal=Tribology International | pages=42–47| year=2017 | last1=Zia | first1=Abdul Wasy | last2=Zhou | first2=Zhifeng | last3=Li | first3=Lawrence Kwok-Yan }}&lt;/ref&gt; in this area. The wear rate of amorphous DLC can be reduced up to 60% by embedding isolated carbon nanoparticles embedded simultaneous to DLC deposition. The isolated particles were in-situ created through rapid plasma quenching with Helium pulses&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.diamond.2017.04.014 | volume=76 | title=A new approach to create isolated carbon particles by sputtering: A detailed parametric study and a concept of carbon particles embedded carbon coatings | journal=Tribology International | pages=97–107| year=2017 | last1=Zia | first1=Abdul Wasy | last2=Zhou | first2=Zhifeng | last3=Li | first3=Lawrence Kwok-Yan }}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Despite the favorable tribological properties of DLC it must be used with caution on ferrous metals. If it is used at higher temperatures, the substrate or counter face may [[Carburization|carburize]], which could lead to loss of function due to a change in hardness. The final, end use temperature of a coated component should be kept below the temperature at which a PVC DLC coating is applied.

===Electrical===
If a DLC material is close enough to ''ta-C'' on plots of bonding ratios and hydrogen content it can be an [[Electrical insulation|insulator]] with a high value of resistivity. Perhaps more interesting is that if prepared in the "medium" cobblestone version such as shown in the above figure, electricity is passed through it by a mechanism of hopping [[Electrical conduction|conductivity]]. In this type of conduction of electricity the electrons move by [[quantum mechanical tunneling]] between pockets of conductive material isolated in an insulator. The result is that such a process makes the material something like a [[semiconductor]]. Further research on electrical properties is needed to explicate such conductivity in ''ta-C'' in order to determine its practical value. However, a different electrical property of [[Field electron emission|emissivity]] has been shown to occur at unique levels for ''ta-C''. Such high values allow for electrons to be emitted from ''ta-C'' coated electrodes into vacuum or into other solids with application of modest levels of applied voltage. This has supported important advances in medical technology.

Applications of DLC typically utilize the ability of the material to reduce abrasive wear. Tooling components, such as [[endmill]]s, [[drill bit]]s, [[die (manufacturing)|die]]s and [[mold]]s often use DLC in this manner. DLC is also used in the engines of modern supersport motorcycles, Formula 1 racecars, [[NASCAR]] vehicles, and as a coating on [[hard-disk]] platters and hard-disk read heads to protect against [[head crash]]es. Virtually all of the multi-bladed razors used for wet shaving have the edges coated with hydrogen-free DLC to reduce friction, preventing abrasion of sensitive skin. It is also being used as a coating by some weapon manufacturers/custom gunsmiths. Some forms have been certified in the EU for food service and find extensive uses in the high-speed actions involved in processing novelty foods such as [[Potato chip|potato chips]] and in guiding material flows in packaging foodstuffs with plastic wraps. DLC coats the cutting edges of tools for the high-speed, dry shaping of difficult exposed surfaces of wood and [[aluminium]], for example on automobile dashboards.

The wear, friction, and electrical properties of DLC make it an appealing material for medical applications. Fortunately, DLC has proved to have excellent bio-compatibility as well. This has enabled many medical procedures, such as [[Percutaneous coronary intervention]] employing [[brachytherapy]] to benefit from the unique electrical properties of DLC. At low voltages and low temperatures electrodes coated with DLC can emit enough electrons to be arranged into disposable, micro-X-ray tubes as small as the radioactive seeds that are introduced into arteries or tumors in conventional [[brachytherapy]]. The same dose of prescribed radiation can be applied ''from the inside, out'' with the additional possibility to switch on and off the radiation in the prescribed pattern for the X-rays being used. DLC has proved to be an excellent coating to prolong the life of and reduce complications with replacement hip joints and artificial knees. It also has been successfully applied to coronary artery stents, reducing the incidence of thrombosis. The implantable human heart pump can be considered the ultimate biomedical application where DLC coating is used on blood contacting surfaces of the key components of the device.

The Space Black stainless steel Apple Watch&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/watch/craftsmanship/|publisher=Apple Inc|title=Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt; is coated with diamond-like carbon.

==Environmental benefits of durable products==
The increase in lifetime of articles coated with DLC that wear out because of abrasion can be described by the formula ''f = (g)&lt;sup&gt;µ&lt;/sup&gt;'', where ''g'' is a number that characterizes the type of DLC, the type of abrasion, the substrate material and μ is the thickness of the DLC coating in μm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= C.B. Collins, F. Davanloo |journal=J. Vac. Sci. Technol. B |volume=11|page=1936|year=1993|doi=10.1116/1.586525|title= Noncrystalline films with the chemistry, bonding, and properties of diamond|issue= 5|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; For "low-impact" abrasion (pistons in cylinders, impellers in pumps for sandy liquids, etc.), ''g'' for pure ''ta-C'' on 304 stainless steel is 66. This means that one-μm thickness (that is ~5% of the thickness of a human hair-end) would increase service lifetime for the article it coated from a week to over a year and two-μm thickness would increase it from a week to 85 years. These are measured values; though in the case of the 2 μm coating the lifetime was extrapolated from the last time the sample was evaluated until the testing apparatus itself wore out.

There are environmental arguments that a sustainable economy ought to encourage articles not engineered to lower performance or to fail prematurely. This in turn will reduce the need to support greater production of units and their frequent replacement, which might provide an economic disincentive to manufacturers of such devices.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Currently there are about 100 outsource vendors of DLC coatings that are loaded with amounts of graphite and hydrogen and so give much lower g-numbers than 66 on the same substrates.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1556">'''Double-pair mating''' ('''DPM''') is a mating (crossing) design used in [[plant breeding]]. Each individual is mated with two others.

== Principles ==
[[Image:DPM.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Figure 1: DMP scheme]]
In Fig. 1 a connected variant of DPM is shown. DPM is an efficient mating design in balanced breeding programmes, where equal contribution from each breeding population member is desired.&lt;ref&gt;Rosvall, O. 1999. Enhancing Gain from Long-Term Forest Tree Breeding while Conserving Genetic Diversity. PhD-thesis. Acta Universitatis Agriculturae Sueciae. Silvestria 109 65pp+4 chapters&lt;/ref&gt; With DPM the number of new families created is equal to the number of individuals mated. DPM allows to efficiently utilise positive [[assortative mating]] for more efficient use of the breeding population members for deployment to seed [[orchards]].&lt;ref&gt;Ruotsalainen, S. 2002. Managing breeding stock in the initiation of a long-term tree breeding program. PhD-thesis. Finnish Forest Research Institute, Research Papers 875., 95 + 61 p [http://www.metla.fi/julkaisut/mt/875/]&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison with single pair mating, DPM has the advantages that the genes from the individual are transmitted to next generation even if one of the crosses fails; that safer estimates of breeding values of the parents get possible (useful for [[seed orchard]]s, where tested trees are preferred); and that genes from different ancestors have a better chance to combine.

'''Ecotropism''' or '''ecotropic''' (from ''eco'' – hearth and ''tropic'' – to turn towards) refers to the philosophy that for human culture to be healthy, it must exist as in an ecological niche and thereby relate appropriately with all the fields of forces of nature, organic and inorganic&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cityvision.edu/wiki/node/15849|title=Ecotropism {{!}} City Vision University|website=www.cityvision.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The following form of the term has been used  since 1990 in the publication of "Toward an Ecotropic Poetry"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://worldatuningfork.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Toward-An-Ecotropic-Poetrywidermargins.pdf | title=Toward an Ecotropic Poetry | accessdate=May 23, 2016 |author1=John Campion |author2=John Herndon }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Published by The Open Theatre, Austin Tx 1990, written by John John Campion and John Herndon.

Ecotropism can also indicate that a [[pathogen]], like a [[virus]] or a [[bacterium]], has a narrow [[host range]] and can [[infection|infect]] one or a small group of [[species]] or [[cell culture]] lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/ecotropic | title=Ecotropic | work=Dorland's Medical Dictionary for Health Consumers | accessdate=May 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7619">'''Eimac''' is a trade mark of Eimac Products, part of the Microwave Power Products Division of [[Communications &amp; Power Industries]]. It produces power [[vacuum tube]]s for [[radio frequency]] applications such as [[broadcasting|broadcast]] and [[radar]] [[transmitter]]s.

==History==
The [[San Francisco Bay Area]] was an early center of [[ham radio]] with about 10% of the operators in the United States. William Eitel, Jack McCullough, and [[Charles Litton, Sr.]], who together pioneered vacuum tube manufacturing in the Bay Area, were hobbyists with training in technology gained locally who participated in development of [[shortwave radio]] by the ham radio hobby. [[High frequency]], and especially, [[Very high frequency]], VHF, transmission in the 10 meter band, required higher quality power tubes than were manufactured by the consortium of RCA, Western Electric, General Electric, Westinghouse which controlled vacuum tube manufacture. Litton pioneered the [[Lathe#Glass-working lathes|glass lathe]] which made mass production of reliable high quality power tubes possible.&lt;ref name=MSV13-40&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christophe Lécuyer|title=Making Silicon Valley: Innovation and the Growth of High Tech, 1930-1970|date=August 24, 2007|publisher=The MIT Press|isbn=978-0262622110|pages=13-40|format=trade paperback}}&lt;!--|accessdate=January 28, 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

While employed by the small [[San Francisco]], [[California]] manufacturing firm of Heintz &amp; Kaufman which manufactured custom radio equipment Bill Eitel ([[amateur radio]] [[call sign]] W6UF) and Jack McCullough (W6CHE) convinced company president Ralph Heintz (W6XBB) to allow them to develop a transmitting tube that could operate at lower voltages than those then available to the amateur radio market, such as the [[RCA]] 204A or the 852. Their effort was a success and resulted in production of the HK-354. Shortly after in 1934, Eitel and McCullough left H&amp;K to form Eitel McCullough Corp. in [[San Bruno]] California.&lt;ref&gt;Orr, B (1994). ''Radio FUNdamentals, Do You Want A Kilowatt??'' [sic], CQ p.60&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first product produced under the trade mark "Eimac" was the 150T power triode.  The new company thrived during [[World War II]] by selling tubes to the U.S. military for use in [[radar]] equipment.&lt;ref&gt;Orr, B (1994). ''Radio FUNdamentals, Do You Want A Kilowatt??'' [sic], CQ p.61-62&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mass production===
Contracts to provide transmission tubes for radar and other radio equipment during World War II required adaption of mass production, research to improve the reliability of tubes, and development of standardized manufacturing techniques which could be performed by unskilled workers. The workforce expanded from a few hundred to several thousand.&lt;ref name=MSV38-45&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christophe Lécuyer|title=Making Silicon Valley: Innovation and the Growth of High Tech, 1930-1970|date=August 24, 2007|publisher=The MIT Press|isbn=978-0262622110|pages=38-45|format=trade paperback}}&lt;!--|accessdate=January 28, 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; During the war Eimac produced out hundreds of thousands radar tubes.&lt;ref name="AW-19630603"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/Aviation_Week_1963-06-03#page/n43/mode/2up How science grew such long arms]. // ''Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology'', June 3, 1963, v. 78, no. 22, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Welfare capitalism===
A union organizing drive in 1939-40 by the strong Bay area labor movement was fought off by adoption of a strategy of [[welfare capitalism]] which included pensions and other generous benefits, profit sharing, and such extras as a medical clinic and a cafeteria. An atmosphere of cooperation and collaboration was established,&lt;ref name=MSV40,41&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christophe Lécuyer|title=Making Silicon Valley: Innovation and the Growth of High Tech, 1930-1970|date=August 24, 2007|publisher=The MIT Press|isbn=978-0262622110|pages=40,41|format=trade paperback}}&lt;!--|accessdate=January 28, 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postwar===
[[File:Eimac Tube.jpg|thumb|right|EIMAC 4-250A power tetrode]]
As wartime orders ceased and a large supply of military surplus transmission tubes flooded the market the firm laid off 90% of its workers and closed its plant in Salt Lake City. Reallocation of the FM band by the FCC in 1945, however, provided an opportunity for the firm to market a superior power [[tetrode]] tube which it had developed.&lt;ref name=MSV45-48&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christophe Lécuyer|title=Making Silicon Valley: Innovation and the Growth of High Tech, 1930-1970|date=August 24, 2007|publisher=The MIT Press|isbn=978-0262622110|pages=45-48|format=trade paperback}}&lt;!--|accessdate=January 28, 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1947, Eimac operated [[FM broadcasting|FM]] radio station [[KSBR]] from their plant in [[San Bruno, California]], one of only two FM stations in the United States to test the new Rangertone [[tape recorder]]s (adapted from the German [[Magnetophon]] recorders).&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=KDdQLuRBVW0C&amp;pg=PA198&amp;lpg=PA198&amp;dq=KSBR,+San+Bruno&amp;source=web&amp;ots=oy0c8-ftrX&amp;sig=EgjqmklSrjuR43Jb4pvJ_YXuNmo&amp;hl=en#PPA198,M1&lt;/ref&gt; In need of more space, the company moved to [[San Carlos, California|San Carlos]] in 1959. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/images/1/10/Eitel_Mccullough.jpg]&lt;/ref&gt;  Eimac's San Carlos plant was dedicated on April 16, 1959.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/images/1/10/Eitel_Mccullough.jpg/?layout=metadata&amp;brand=calisphere Eitel-McCullough, Inc. building in San Carlos, 1959&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; By that time, the company had the following [[subsidiaries]]: National Electronics, Inc., [[Geneva, Illinois]], and Eitel-McCullough, S.A., [[Geneva, Switzerland]]. During the [[Cold war era]], Eimac supplied U.S. military with [[klystron tube|klystron power tubes]] and [[Vacuum tube|electron power tubes]] used in the defense communications network, [[navigation radar|navigation]], [[Radio detection and ranging|detection, ranging]] and [[fire-control radar]]s.&lt;ref name="AW-19630603" /&gt;

In the beginning of May 1959, the company announced its newly-produced giant klystron tube powered the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]’s radar which recently established contact with [[planet Venus]]. The super-power klystron, developed under [[Rome Air Development Center]] sponsorship. Eimac klystrons also has been chosen for [[NATO]]'s [[tropospheric scatter]] communications network.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/Aviation_Week_1959-05-04#page/n77/mode/1up Filter Center]. // ''Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology'', May 4, 1959, v. 70, no. 18, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, Eimac merged with [[Varian Associates]] and became known as the Eimac Division. In August 1995, [[Varian Associates]] sold the Electron Device Business to [[Leonard Green &amp; Partners]], a private equity fund, and members of management. Together, they formed [[Communications &amp; Power Industries]].

In January 2004, affiliates of [[The Cypress Group]], a private equity fund, acquired CPI.

In February 2011, an affiliate of Veritas Capital, a private equity investment firm acquired CPI.

In 2006 CPI relocated the Eimac facility from 301 Industrial Way to their operation in Palo Alto.

The '''European Underground Rare Event Calorimeter Array''' ('''EURECA''') is a planned [[dark matter]] search experiment using [[cryogenic detectors]] and an absorber mass of up to 1 tonne. The project will be built in the [[Modane Underground Laboratory]] and will bring together researchers working on the [[Cryogenic Rare Event Search with Superconducting Thermometers|CRESST]] and [[EDELWEISS]] experiments.&lt;ref&gt;

==Dark matter==
{{Main|Dark matter}}
Dark matter is one of the significant [[Unsolved problems in physics|unsolved problems]] in modern science. There is considerable evidence from [[astronomy]] and [[cosmology]] that a significant fraction of the mass of the Universe, and of galaxies is made up of non-luminous material. The nature of dark matter is currently unknown. However a popular hypothesis is that it consists of [[Weakly interacting massive particles|Weakly Interacting Massive Particles]] (WIMPs), particles with a large mass, but which only interact with ordinary matter through the [[weak interaction|weak nuclear force]], so the majority that pass through the Earth do not hit a single atom. The aim of dark matter search experiments such as EURECA is to test this hypothesis by searching for WIMP dark matter interactions. WIMPs are predicted to exist by [[supersymmetry]] theory, which predicts a wide range of scattering cross-sections down to 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt;pb, corresponding to an interaction rate of ~1 event per year in a 1 tonne detector.&lt;ref&gt;R. Trotta, R. Ruiz de Austri and L. Roszkowski, (2007) 'Prospects for direct dark matter detection in the constrained MSSM'  New Astronomy Reviews 51 316 {{doi|10.1016/j.newar.2006.11.059}}&lt;/ref&gt; Existing experiments such as [[Cryogenic Rare Event Search with Superconducting Thermometers|CRESST]]  and [[EDELWEISS]] have already ruled out higher interaction rates, but EURECA will search down to this lower limit.

==Cryogenic dark matter searches==
Cryogenic dark matter experiments use particle detectors operating at millikelvin temperatures to search for the elastic scattering of WIMPs of an atomic nuclei. A particle interaction inside an absorber crystal will create a large number of [[phonons]], these thermalise inside a [[thermometer]] on the crystal surface, which records the rise in temperature. Such cryogenic detectors are used as they combine a high sensitivity with a low energy threshold and excellent resolution.

Dark matter experiments are located in deep underground laboratories, and use extensive shielding to reduce the background radiation levels from [[cosmic rays]]. Early experiments were limited by the remaining background due to radioactive impurities close to the detectors. Therefore the second phase of CRESST and EDELWEISS used new detectors capable of distinguishing electron recoil events from nuclear recoils. Electron recoils are produced by [[alpha particle|alpha]], [[beta particle|beta]] and [[gamma ray|gamma]] particles which account for the vast majority of background events. WIMPs (and also neutrons) produce nuclear recoils. This is done by measuring an additional signal, which is much higher for electron recoils than nuclear recoils. CRESST detectors measure the [[scintillation (physics)|scintillation]] light produced in a CaWO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; or ZnWO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; absorber crystal. EDELWEISS detectors measure the [[ionization]] produced in a semiconducting [[germanium]] crystal.

==EURECA==
EURECA will take this cryogenic detector technology pioneered by CRESST and EDELWEISS  further by building a 1 tonne absorber mass made up from a large number of cryogenic detector modules. The experiment plans to use a range of detector materials. This provides a way to show if a positive signal is due to dark matter, as the event rate is expected to scale with the [[atomic mass]] of the target nuclei. Whereas the event rate from [[neutrons]] will be higher for lighter nuclei.

The EURECA collaboration includes the member institutions of [[Cryogenic Rare Event Search with Superconducting Thermometers|CRESST]], [[EDELWEISS]], and ROSEBUD dark matter experiments, and some new members. These are:

*[[Universität Karlsruhe]]
*[[Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe]]
*[[JINR]]
*[[Universidad de Zaragoza]]
*[http://lpd.kinr.kiev.ua/ INR Kiev]
*[[CERN]]

The collaboration spokesman is Gilles Gerbier. The experiment will be built in the [[Modane]] Underground Laboratory, in the [[Fréjus Road Tunnel|Fréjus road tunnel]] between France and Italy, the deepest underground laboratory in Europe.

==R&amp;D activities==
EURECA researchers are currently involved in data taking and analysis for CRESST and EDELWEISS. In addition, there are various R&amp;D activities under way associated with scaling up the detector technology to a 1-tonne scale. These include:

*[[Cryogenics]]: EURECA will require a one tonne mass to be cooled to millikelvin temperature. This will be done using large scale cryogenic technology, as used to cool [[gravitational wave]] experiments and the 27&amp;nbsp;km [[Large Hadron Collider|LHC]] accelerator ring.
*[[Scintillation (physics)|Scintillators]]: Research is being carried out to develop large radiopure absorber crystals with good scintillation properties at low temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;Proceedings of the 1st International Workshop "Radiopure Scintillators for EURECA" (RPScint'2008) [https://arxiv.org/abs/0903.1539 arxiv:0903.1539]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Detector readout: EURECA will require hardware and software to read-out the signals from 1000+ detector channels.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7181">In [[density functional theory]] (DFT), the '''Harris energy functional''' is a non-self-consistent approximation to the [[Kohn-Sham]] [[density functional theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevB.31.1770 | title = Simplified method for calculating the energy of weakly interacting fragments | year = 1985 | last1 = Harris | first1 = J. | issue=4| journal = Physical Review B | volume = 31 | pages = 1770–1779|bibcode = 1985PhRvB..31.1770H }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It gives the energy of a combined system as a function of the [[electronic density|electronic densities]] of the isolated parts. The energy of the Harris functional varies much less than the energy of the Kohn-Sham functional as the density moves away from the converged density.

==Background==
[[Kohn-Sham equations]] are the [[one-electron]] equations that must be solved in a [[Self-consistency|self-consistent]] fashion in order to find the [[Ground State|ground state]] [[Electron density|density]] of a system of [[Many-body theory|interacting electrons]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \left( \frac{-\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2+v_{\rm H}[n]+v_{\rm xc}[n] +v_{\rm ext}(r)\right)\phi_j(r)=\epsilon_j \phi_j(r). &lt;/math&gt;

The density, &lt;math&gt; n, &lt;/math&gt; is given by that of the [[Slater determinant]] formed by the [[Molecular orbital|spin-orbitals]] of the occupied states:

&lt;math&gt; n(r)=\sum_{j} f_j \vert \phi_j (r)  \vert ^2,&lt;/math&gt;

where the coefficients &lt;math&gt; f_j &lt;/math&gt; are the occupation numbers given by the [[Fermi–Dirac statistics|Fermi-Dirac distribution]] at the temperature of the system with the restriction &lt;math display="inline"&gt; \sum_j f_j =N &lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt; is the total number of electrons. In the equation above, &lt;math&gt; v_{\rm H}[n] &lt;/math&gt; is the Hartree potential and &lt;math&gt; v_{\rm xc}[n] &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Electronic correlation|exchange-correlation potential]], which are expressed in terms of the electronic density. Formally, one must solve these equations self-consistently, for which the usual strategy is to pick an initial guess for the density, &lt;math&gt; n_0(r) &lt;/math&gt;, substitute in the Kohn-Sham equation, extract a new density &lt;math&gt; n_1(r) &lt;/math&gt; and iterate the process until [[Convergence (math)|convergence]] is obtained. When the final self-consistent density &lt;math&gt; n(r) &lt;/math&gt; is reached, the energy of the system is expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt; E[n] = \sum_{j \in \text{occupied}} \epsilon_j -\tfrac{1}{2}\int v_{\rm H}[n]n(r) \, \mathrm{d}r - \int v_{\rm xc}[n]n(r) \, \mathrm{d}r + E_{\rm xc}[n] &lt;/math&gt;.

== Definition ==
Assuming that we have an approximate [[electron density]] &lt;math&gt;n_0( r)&lt;/math&gt;, which is different from the exact electron density &lt;math&gt; n( r) &lt;/math&gt;. We construct exchange-correlation [[Potential energy|potential]] &lt;math&gt; v_{\rm xc}(r) &lt;/math&gt; and the Hartree potential &lt;math&gt; v_{\rm H}(r) &lt;/math&gt; based on the approximate electron density &lt;math&gt;n_0(r)&lt;/math&gt;. Kohn-Sham equations are then solved with the XC and Hartree potentials and [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvalues]] are then obtained; that is, we perform one single iteration of the self-consistency calculation. The sum of eigenvalues is often called the [[Electronic band structure|band structure]] energy:

&lt;math&gt; E_{\rm band}=\sum_i \epsilon_i, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt; loops over all occupied Kohn-Sham orbitals. Harris [[energy functional]] is defined as

:&lt;math&gt; E_{\rm Harris}[n_0] = \sum_i \epsilon_i - \int \mathrm{d}r^3 v_{\rm xc}[n_0](r) n_0(r) - \tfrac{1}{2} \int \mathrm{d}r^3 v_{\rm H}[n_0](r) n_0(r) + E_{\rm xc}[n_0] &lt;/math&gt;

== Comments ==
It was discovered by Harris that the difference between the Harris energy &lt;math&gt; E_{\rm Harris} &lt;/math&gt;  and the exact total energy is to the second order of the error of the approximate [[electron density]], i.e., &lt;math&gt; O((\rho-\rho_0)^2) &lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, for many systems the accuracy of Harris [[energy functional]] may be sufficient. The Harris functional was originally developed for such calculations rather than self-consistent [[Convergence (math)|convergence]], although it can be applied in a self-consistent manner in which the density is changed. Many density-functional [[Tight binding|tight-binding methods]], such as [http://www.dftb-plus.info/ DFTB+], [https://fireball-dft.org/ Fireball],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevB.64.195103 | title = Further developments in the local-orbital density-functional-theory tight-binding method | year = 2001 | last1 = Lewis | first1 = James P. | last2 = Glaesemann | first2 = Kurt R. | last3 = Voth | first3 = Gregory A. | last4 = Fritsch | first4 = Jürgen | last5 = Demkov | first5 = Alexander A. | last6 = Ortega | first6 = José | last7 = Sankey | first7 = Otto F.| journal = Physical Review B | volume = 64 | issue = 19 |pages = 195103|bibcode = 2001PhRvB..64s5103L }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [https://github.com/pekkosk/hotbit Hotbit], are built based on the Harris energy functional. In these methods, one often does not perform self-consistent Kohn-Sham DFT calculations and the total energy is estimated using the Harris energy functional, although a version of the Harris functional where one does perform self-consistency calculations has been used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi =  10.1002/pssb.201147259| title = Advances and applications in the FIREBALL ab initio tight-binding molecular-dynamics formalism | year = 2011 | last1 = Lewis | first1 = James P. | last2 = Ortega | first2 = José | last3 = Jelinek | first3 = Pavel | last4 = Dravold | first4 = D.A. | journal = Physica Status Solidi B  | volume =  | issue =  |pages = n/a|bibcode= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These codes are often much faster than conventional Kohn-Sham DFT codes that solve Kohn-Sham DFT in a self-consistent manner.

While the Kohn-Sham DFT energy is a [[Variational method|variational functional]] (never lower than the ground state energy), the Harris DFT energy was originally believed to be anti-variational (never higher than the ground state energy).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1088/0953-8984/2/10/018 |issue = 10| title = Extremal properties of the Harris energy functional |year=1990 | last1=Zaremba | first1=E. | journal=Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter | volume=2 | pages=2479–2486|bibcode = 1990JPCM....2.2479Z }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was, however, conclusively demonstrated to be incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.66.3265 | issue = 25 | pmid=10043743 | title = Does the Harris energy functional possess a local maximum at the ground-state density? | year = 1991 | last1=Robertson | first1 = I.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8282">The '''Iceland Deep Drilling Project''' (IDDP) is a geothermal project established in 2000 by a consortium of the National Energy Authority of Iceland (Orkustofnun)(OS) and four of Iceland's leading energy companies: Hitaveita Sudurnesja (HS), [[Landsvirkjun]], [[Orkuveita Reykjavíkur]] and [[Mannvit Engineering]]. The consortium is referred to as "Deep Vision".&lt;ref name="iodp.org"&gt;http://www.iodp.org/iodp_journals/5_Progress_Report_on_Iceland_SD4.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iddp.is"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iddp.is/about|title=About «  IDDP|work=iddp.is|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0375650513000217|title=The concept of the Iceland deep drilling project |accessdate=17 February 2015|doi=10.1016/j.geothermics.2013.03.004|volume=49|pages=2–8|journal=Geothermics|date=January 2014 |last1=Friðleifsson |first1=G.Ó. |last2=Elders |first2=W.A. |last3=Albertsson |first3=A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aim is to improve the economics of [[geothermal power|geothermal energy]] production. Its strategy is to look at the usefulness of [[supercritical hydrothermal fluids]] as an economic energy source. This necessitates drilling to depths of greater than {{convert|4000|m|ft}} in order to tap the temperatures of more than {{convert|400|°C|°F|-1}}. The drilling is at a rifted plate margin on the [[mid-oceanic ridge]].&lt;ref name="iddp.is"/&gt; Producing steam from a well in a reservoir hotter than {{convert|450|°C|°F|-1}} — at a proposed rate of around {{convert|0.67|m3/s}} should be sufficient to generate around 45&amp;nbsp;[[Watt#Megawatt|MW]]. If this is correct, then the project could be a major step towards developing high-temperature geothermal resources.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.renewableenergyaccess.com/rea/news/story?id=50526 Deep Vision: Big Energy from Way, Way Down&lt;/ref&gt;

"Deep Vision" recognized at its inception that much research would be needed regarding the poorly understood supercritical environment and as such sought to promote inclusion of the wider scientific community.&lt;ref name="iodp.org"/&gt;

Funding has come from the members of the consortium, the [[International Continental Scientific Drilling Program]] and the US [[National Science Foundation]].&lt;ref name="iddp.is"/&gt;

This project has also been used for purposes such as university research. Researchers from [[UC Davis]], [[UC Riverside]], [[Stanford University]], and the [[University of Oregon]] have taken the opportunity to collaborate with each other and the IDDP. They have aimed their investigation to gain information about extracting energy from hot rocks on land. To do this, they have been gathering important information from the [[borehole]] they sunk where seawater circulates through deep, hot rock. This should give important new clues about [[Hydrothermal vent|black smokers]], hydrothermal vents that spew minerals and [[superheated water]] deep below the ocean. These support unique [[microorganism]] communities living within them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.ucdavis.edu/search/news_detail.lasso?id=8420|title=Deep Drilling for "Black Smoker" Clues|work=UC Davis News &amp; Information|accessdate=17 February 2015|date=2007-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First Well, IDDP-1==
The 49th Volume of the journal ''Geothermics'', released in January 2014, is entirely dedicated to the first well of the IDDP.

The borehole of this well was unintentionally drilled into a [[magma reservoir]] in 2009. The hole was initially planned to drill down to hot rock below {{convert|4000|m}}, but drilling was ceased when the drill struck magma at only {{convert|2100|m|ft}} deep. This same occurrence has only been recorded once, in a Hawaiian geothermal well in 2007, but in that instance, it resulted in the sealing and abandonment of the hole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/01/140123133217.htm|title=World's first magma-enhanced geothermal system created in Iceland|work=ScienceDaily|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In IDDP-1 the decision was made to continue the experimental well, and upon inserting cold water into the well, which was over {{convert|900|°C|°F|-1}}. The resultant well was the first operational Magma-[[Enhanced geothermal system|EGS]], and was at the time the most powerful geothermal well ever drilled. While not producing electricity on the grid, it was calculated that the output of the well would have been sufficient to produce 36 MW of electricity.&lt;ref&gt;http://iddp.is/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/News-in-English-16-01-2014.pdf World's first magma-EGS system created, January 16th 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The well was eventually shut down after a valve failure occurred while attempting to connect the output to a central generator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iddp.is/saga-reports|title=SAGA Reports «  IDDP|work=iddp.is|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Second Well (continuation of an old borehole), IDDP-2 ==
Five years before IDDP-1 was made, a borehole was drilled at [[Reykjanesvirkjun]]. It was named RN-15 or REY H015 (Reykjanes-15) and is just one of many geothermal boreholes drilled in the [[Reykjanes peninsula]] since 1956. It reached a maximum depth of 2.5 km (1.55 mi).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hsveitur.is/images/2007.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

It was always known that RN-15 could be deepened, after a good result of the drilling.&lt;ref&gt;http://iddp.is/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/SAGA_REPORT_2006.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; About 10 years later, IDDP decided to continue drilling under the project name IDDP-2.&lt;ref&gt;http://iddp.is/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SAGA-REPORT-No-10.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The plan is to reach a maximum depth of 5 km (3.11 mi) before the end of 2016, making it by far the deepest borehole in Iceland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ruv.is/frett/bora-dypstu-holu-landsins-a-reykjanesi | title=Bora dýpstu holu landsins á Reykjanesi| date=2016-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists are hoping to reach a temperature of {{convert|500|°C|°F|-1}},&lt;ref&gt;http://iddp.is/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Uppl%C3%BDsingaskilti_rev.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.visir.is/bora-dypstu-holu-islands---hittu-sidast-i-gloandi-kviku/article/2016160429158 | title=Bora dýpstu holu Íslands - hittu síðast í glóandi kviku - Vísir}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would be the hottest blast of any hole in the world, breaking the former record of the IDDP-1 Krafla borehole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.landsvirkjun.is/rannsoknirogthroun/throunarverkefni/djupborun | title=Djúpborun - Orka úr 100% endurnýjanlegum orkugjöfum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotebox|A significant milestone has been reached in the Iceland Deep Drilling Project at the Reykjanes Peninsula in Iceland when drilling of the IDDP-2 well was completed on the 25th of January [2017] at {{convert|4659|m|ft}} depth. All of the initial targets were reached.  These targets were to drill deep, extract drill cores, measure the temperature and search for permeability. Temperature at the bottom of the well has already been measured at {{convert|427|°C|°F|-1}}, with fluid pressure of 340 bars, drill cores were retrieved, and the rocks appear to be permeable at depth. It´s clear that the bottom of the well reached fluids at supercritical conditions, so that the main drilling phase objective of the project has been achieved.  The drilling operation took 176 days since we began the drilling operation 11th August 2016.|source=The IDDP website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://iddp.is|title=The IDDP|accessdate=2017-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Induction heating'''  is the process of [[heating]] an electrically conducting object (usually a [[metal]]) by [[electromagnetic induction]], through heat generated in the object by [[eddy current]]s. An induction heater consists of an [[electromagnet]], and an [[electronic oscillator]] that passes a high-frequency [[alternating current]] (AC) through the electromagnet. The rapidly alternating [[magnetic field]] penetrates the object, generating [[electric current]]s inside the conductor called eddy currents. The eddy currents flowing through the [[electrical resistance|resistance]] of the material heat it by [[Joule heating]]. In [[ferromagnetic]] (and [[ferrimagnetic]]) materials like iron, heat may also be generated by magnetic [[hysteresis]] losses. The [[frequency]] of current used depends on the object size, material type, coupling (between the work coil and the object to be heated) and the penetration depth.

An important feature of the induction heating process is that the heat is generated inside the object itself, instead of by an external heat source via heat conduction. Thus objects can be heated very rapidly. In addition there need not be any external contact, which can be important where contamination is an issue. Induction heating is used in many industrial processes, such as heat treatment in [[metallurgy]], [[Czochralski process|Czochralski crystal growth]] and [[zone refining]] used in the [[semiconductor]] industry, and to melt [[refractory metal]]s which require very high temperatures. It is also used in induction cooktops for heating containers of food; this is called [[induction cooking]].

==Applications==
[[Image:Induction heating of bar.jpg|300px|thumb|Induction heating of 25&amp;nbsp;mm metal bar using 15&amp;nbsp;kW at 450&amp;nbsp;kHz.]]
[[Image:Silicon grown by Czochralski process 1956 closeup.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Melting silicon in crucible at {{convert|2650|°F|°C|abbr=on}} for [[Czochralski process|Czochralski]] crystal growth, 1956]]

Induction heating allows the targeted heating of an applicable item for applications including surface hardening, melting, [[brazing]] and soldering and heating to fit. [[Iron]] and its [[steel|alloys]] respond best to induction heating, due to their [[ferromagnetic]] nature. Eddy currents can, however, be generated in any conductor, and [[magnetic hysteresis]] can occur in any magnetic material. Induction heating has been used to heat liquid conductors (such as molten metals) and also gaseous conductors (such as a gas plasma - see [[Induction plasma technology]]). Induction heating is often used to heat graphite crucibles (containing other materials) and is used extensively in the semiconductor industry for the heating of silicon and other semiconductors. [[Utility frequency]] (50/60&amp;nbsp;Hz) induction heating is used for many lower cost industrial applications as [[power inverter|inverters]] are not required.

===Furnace===
An [[induction furnace]] uses induction to heat metal to its melting point. Once molten, the high-frequency magnetic field can also be used to stir the hot metal, which is useful in ensuring that [[alloy|alloying additions]] are fully mixed into the melt. Most induction furnaces consist of a tube of water-cooled copper rings surrounding a container of [[refractory]] material. Induction furnaces are used in most modern foundries as a cleaner method of melting metals than a [[reverberatory furnace]] or a [[blast furnace|cupola]]. Sizes range from a kilogram of capacity to a hundred tonnes capacity. Induction furnaces often emit a high-pitched whine or hum when they are running, depending on their operating frequency. Metals melted include [[iron]] and [[steel]], [[copper]], [[aluminium]], and [[precious metal]]s. Because it is a clean and non-contact process it can be used in a vacuum or inert atmosphere. Vacuum furnaces make use of induction heating for the production of specialty steels and other alloys that would oxidize if heated in the presence of air.

===Welding===
{{main article|Induction welding}}
A similar, smaller-scale process is used for [[induction welding]]. [[Plastics]] may also be welded by induction, if they are either doped with ferromagnetic ceramics (where magnetic hysteresis of the particles provides the heat required) or by metallic particles.

Seams of tubes can be welded this way. Currents induced in a tube run along the open seam and heat the edges resulting in a temperature high enough for welding. At this point, the seam edges are forced together and the seam is welded. The RF current can also be conveyed to the tube by brushes, but the result is still the same – the current flows along the open seam, heating it.

===Cooking===
{{main article|Induction cooking}}
In [[induction cooking]], an induction coil in the cook-top heats the iron base of cookware by [[Electromagnetic induction|magnetic induction]]. Copper-bottomed pans, aluminum pans and other [[Non-ferrous metal|non-ferrous]] pans are generally unsuitable. The heat induced in the base is transferred to the food by [[heat conduction|conduction]]. The benefits of induction cookers include efficiency, safety (the induction cook-top is not heated itself) and speed. Both permanently installed and portable induction cookers are available.

===Brazing===
{{main article|Induction brazing}}
[[Induction brazing]] is often used in higher production runs. It produces uniform results and is very repeatable. There are many types of industrial equipment where Induction brazing is used. For instance, Induction is used for brazing carbide to shaft.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

===Sealing===
{{main article|Induction sealing}}
Induction heating is used in ''cap sealing'' of containers in the food and pharmaceutical industries. A layer of aluminum foil is placed over the bottle or jar opening and heating by induction to fuse it to the container. This provides a tamper-resistant seal, since altering the contents requires breaking the foil.&lt;ref&gt;Valery Rudnev ''Handbook of Induction Heating''CRC Press, 2003 {{ISBN|0824708482}} page 92&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heating to fit===
{{main|Induction shrink fitting}}
Induction heating is often used to heat an item causing it to expand prior to fitting or assembly. Bearings are routinely heated in this way using [[utility frequency]] (50/60&amp;nbsp;Hz) and a laminated steel transformer type core passing through the centre of the bearing.

===Heat treatment===
Induction heating is often used in the [[heat treatment]] of metal items.
The most common applications are [[induction hardening]] of steel parts, induction [[soldering]]/[[brazing]] as a means of joining metal components and induction [[annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]] to selectively soften an area of a steel part.

Induction heating can produce high power densities which allow short interaction times to reach the required temperature. This gives tight control of the heating pattern with the pattern following the applied magnetic field quite closely and allows reduced thermal distortion and damage.

This ability can be used in hardening to produce parts with varying properties. The most common hardening process is to produce a localised surface hardening of an area that needs wear-resistance, while retaining the toughness of the original structure as needed elsewhere. The depth of induction hardened patterns can be controlled through choice of induction-frequency, power-density and interaction time.

Limits to the flexibility of the process arise from the need to produce dedicated inductors for many applications. This is quite expensive and requires the marshalling of high current densities in small copper inductors, which can require specialized engineering and 'copper-fitting'.

=== Plastic processing===

Induction heating is used in plastic [[injection molding machine]]s. Induction heating improves energy efficiency for injection and extrusion processes. Heat is directly generated in the barrel of the machine, reducing warm-up time and energy consumption. The induction coil can be placed outside thermal insulation, so it operates at low temperature and has a long life. The frequency used ranges from 30&amp;nbsp;kHz down to 5&amp;nbsp;kHz, decreasing for thicker barrels. The reduction in cost of inverter equipment has made induction heating increasingly popular. Induction heating can also be applied to molds, offering more even mold temperature and improved product quality.&lt;ref&gt;Dong-Hwi Sohn, Hyeju Eom and Keun Park, ''Application of high-frequency induction heating to high-quality injection molding'', in ''Plastics Engineering Annual Technical Conference Proceedings ANTEC 2010'', [[Society of Plastics Engineers]], 2010 ''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details==
The basic setup is an [[Alternating current|AC]] power supply that provides electricity with low [[volt]]age but very high [[Electric current|current]] and high [[frequency]]. The workpiece to heat is placed inside an [[electromagnetic coil|air coil]] driven by the power supply, usually in combination with a resonant [[LC circuit|tank capacitor]] to increase the reactive power. The alternating magnetic field induces [[eddy current]]s in the workpiece.

The frequency of the inductive current determines the depth that the induced eddy currents penetrate into the workpiece. In the simplest case of a solid round bar, the induced current decreases exponentially from the surface. An "effective" depth of the current-carrying layers can be derived as &lt;math&gt;d = 5000 \sqrt{\frac{\rho}{\mu f}}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the depth in centimeters, &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|resistivity]] of the workpiece in ohm-centimeters, &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the dimensionless [[Permeability (electromagnetism)#Relative permeability and magnetic susceptibility|relative magnetic permeability]] of the workpiece, and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the frequency of the ac field in Hz.&lt;ref&gt;S. Zinn and S. L. Semiatin ''Elements of Induction Heating'' ASM International, 1988 {{ISBN|0871703084}} page 15&lt;/ref&gt; The equivalent resistance of the workpiece and thus the efficiency is a function of the workpiece diameter &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; over the reference depth &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;, increasing rapidly up to about &lt;math&gt;a/d=4&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;S. Zinn and S. L. Semiatin ''Elements of Induction Heating'' ASM International, 1988 {{ISBN|0871703084}} page 19&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the workpiece diameter is fixed by the application, the value of &lt;math&gt;a/d&lt;/math&gt; is determined by the reference depth. Decreasing the reference depth requires increasing the frequency. Since the cost of induction power supplies increase with frequency, supplies are often optimized to achieve a critical frequency at which &lt;math&gt;a/d=4&lt;/math&gt;. If operated below critical frequency, heating efficiency is reduced because eddy currents from either side of the workpiece impinge upon one another and cancel out. Increasing the frequency beyond the critical frequency creates minimal further improvement in heating efficiency, although it is used in applications that seek to heat treat only the surface of the workpiece.

Relative depth varies with temperature because the resistivities and permeability vary with temperature. For steel, the relative permeability drops to 1 above the [[Curie temperature]]. Thus the reference depth can vary with temperature by a factor of 2-3 for nonmagnetic conductors, and by as much as 20 for magnetic steels.&lt;ref&gt;S. Zinn and S. L. Semiatin ''Elements of Induction Heating'' ASM International, 1988 {{ISBN|0871703084}} page 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Magnetic materials improve the induction heat process because of [[Hysteresis#Magnetic hysteresis|hysteresis]]. Materials with high [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] (100–500) are easier to heat with induction heating. Hysteresis heating occurs below the [[Curie point|Curie temperature]] where materials retain their magnetic properties. High permeability below the Curie temperature in the workpiece is useful. Temperature difference, mass, and specific heat influence the workpiece heating.

The energy transfer of induction heating is affected by the distance between the coil and the workpiece. Energy losses occur through [[heat conduction]] from workpiece to fixture, [[Convective heat transfer|natural convection]], and [[thermal radiation]].

The induction coil is usually made of copper tubing and [[Water cooling|fluid cooled]]. Diameter, shape, and number of turns influence the efficiency and field pattern.

== Core type furnace ==
The furnace consists of a circular hearth which contains the charge to be melted in the form of a ring. The metal ring is large in diameter and is magnetically interlinked with an electrical winding energized by an AC source.
It is essentially a transformer where charge to be heated forms a single turn short circuit secondary and is magnetically coupled to the primary by an iron core.

[[File:Wehrmacht-einheitskanister.jpg|thumb|German containers for 20 litres of fuel. left: former container, right: ''Wehrmacht-Einheitskanister'' of 1941, manufacturer: ''Nirona'']]
A '''jerrycan''' (also written as '''jerry can''' or '''jerrican''') is a robust liquid container made from pressed [[steel]]. It was designed in Germany in the 1930s for military use to hold {{convert|20|L|abbr=out}} of fuel. The development of the jerrycan was a significant improvement on earlier designs, which required tools and [[funnel]]s to use. Today similar designs are used for fuel and water containers, some of which are also produced in plastic. The designs usually emulate the original steel design and are still known as jerrycans.

== Uses ==
[[File:DUKW-and-crane-slapton-sands-1944.jpg|thumb|British fuel jerrycans used in April 1944 during training in England in preparation of the Allied landings in Normandy]]
[[File:jerrycan.JPG|thumb|Jerrycans. The stamped indentations on the sides serve two purposes: firstly to stiffen the side sheet metal; secondly to allow greater surface area for expansion and contraction of the contents with heat and cold. Different colours designate the contents.]]
Uses for the cans have expanded beyond the original intended use of carrying fuel. Today, a can's use is denoted by its colouring, and occasionally, imprinted labelling on the container itself. This is to prevent contamination of the can's contents by mixing different fuels or mixing fuel with water.

The US version of the jerrycan is covered by military specification MIL-C-1283&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=LOGSA |url=http://www.tpub.com/content/fuelpumps/TM-10-7200-200-13/TM-10-7200-200-130013.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022150004/http://www.tpub.com/content/fuelpumps/TM-10-7200-200-13/TM-10-7200-200-130013.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-10-22 |title=CHAPTER 2.

== History ==
[[File:Mitsubishi Type 73 Light Truck rear.jpg|right|thumb|A jerrycan attached to a holder at the rear of a [[Mitsubishi Type 73 Light Truck]].]]
The history of the jerrycan is notable because the German design was [[reverse engineered]] and subsequently copied, with minor modifications, by the Allies during the Second World War. The name of the jerrycan refers to its German origins, [[Jerry (WWII)|Jerry]] being wartime slang for Germans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/jerrycan |title=definition and etymology of "jerrycan" |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== German invention ===
The ''Wehrmacht-Einheitskanister'', as it was known in Germany, was first developed in 1937 by the Müller engineering firm in [[Schwelm]] to a design by their chief engineer Vinzenz Grünvogel.&lt;ref name="amazing" /&gt; A similar design was used in 1936 during the [[Spanish Civil War]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://sdkfz7.free.fr/epreserie_36_serie_37_comparatif.htm | title = Pre-series 1936 / series 1937 | date = 2015-04-03 | accessdate = 2015-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where they had a company logo for Ambi-Budd Presswerk GmbH. Among others, the [[Wehrmacht]] had specified that a soldier should be able to carry either two full containers or four empty ones, which is the reason the triple handles were fitted. To achieve the required filling and draining speed, it was fitted with a large spout and flip top closure. A hole in the closure retainer made it possible to fit a securing pin or wire with a lead seal. The rectangular shape made it stackable. The indentations ensured a full can would not be severely damaged when falling from a vehicle, while a dip coat of paint on the inside protected it from corrosion.

By 1939 the German military had thousands of such cans stockpiled in anticipation of war. Motorised troops were issued the cans with lengths of rubber hose in order to siphon fuel from any available source, as a way to aid their rapid advance through [[Poland]] at the start of the Second World War.&lt;ref name=daniel&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Invention &amp; Technology Magazine]] |publisher=AmericanHeritage.com |author=Richard M.

=== American adaptation ===

In 1939, American engineer Paul Pleiss had built a vehicle to journey to India with his German colleague. After building the car, they realised they did not have any storage for emergency water. The German engineer had access to the stockpile of jerrycans at [[Berlin Tempelhof Airport]] and managed to take three of them. They drove across 11 national borders without incident until [[Hermann Göring|Field Marshal Göring]] sent a plane to take the engineer home. The German engineer also gave Pleiss complete specifications for the manufacture of the can.&lt;ref name = daniel /&gt; Pleiss continued on to [[Calcutta]], put his car in storage, and flew back to [[Philadelphia]], where he told American military officials about the can. He could raise no interest.&lt;ref name = daniel /&gt; Without a sample, he realised he could not get anywhere. He eventually shipped the car to [[New York City|New York]] by a roundabout method, and sent a can to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]. The War Department decided instead to use [[World War I]] {{Convert|10|usgal|adj = on|spell = in}} cans with two screw closures, which required both a spanner and funnel for pouring.&lt;ref name = daniel /&gt;

The one jerrycan in American possession was sent to [[Fort Holabird|Camp Holabird]], [[Maryland]], where it was redesigned. The new design retained the handles, size and shape. The US can could be stacked interchangeably with German or British cans. The weld was replaced with rolled seams which were prone to leakage. For fuel cans, the lining was removed and a wrench and funnel were required.&lt;ref name = daniel /&gt; A similar water can was also adopted, with a flip-top lid and enamel lining. 
 
The US designed jerrycan was widely used by US Army and Marine Corps units. In all overseas theaters, fuel and other petroleum products represented about 50% of all supply needs, measured by weight.&lt;ref name="green"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/books/007/7-3-1/CMH_Pub_7-3-1.pdf|title=Logistical Support of the Armies|accessdate=2010-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the European Theatre of Operations alone, over 19&amp;nbsp;million were required to support US forces by May 1945.&lt;ref name="green"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/books/007/7-3-1/CMH_Pub_7-3-1.pdf|title=Logistical Support of the Armies|accessdate=2010-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The jerrycan played an important role in ensuring fuel supply to Allied operations. A single  standard US 2.5 ton truck could carry {{convert|875|USgal|l}} of fuel loaded in jerrycans. &lt;ref name="green"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/books/007/7-3-1/CMH_Pub_7-3-1.pdf|title=Logistical Support of the Armies|accessdate=2010-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
US logisticians requested over 1.3&amp;nbsp;million per month to replace losses; these cans were provided by US and British manufacturers, but supply could not keep up with demand.&lt;ref name=green/&gt; Loss of jerrycans in units was severe, with 3.5&amp;nbsp;million reported 'lost' in October 1944, for example.&lt;ref name=green/&gt; At one point in August 1944, lack of cans (caused by losses) actually limited the supply of fuel that could be brought forward to combat units, even though the fuel was available in rear areas.&lt;ref name="green"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/books/007/7-3-1/CMH_Pub_7-3-1.pdf|title=Logistical Support of the Armies|accessdate=2010-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the [[Second World War]] the [[British Army]] was equipped with two simple fuel containers: the {{Convert|2|impgal|adj = on}} container made of pressed steel, and the {{Convert|4|impgal|adj = on}} container made from [[tin plate]]. The 2-gallon containers were relatively strong, but were expensive to produce. Manufactured primarily in Egypt, the 4-gallon containers were plentiful and inexpensive, but they had a tendency to leak after minor damage. Early 4-gallon containers were packed in pairs in wooden cases. When stacked, the timber framing protected the tins and prevented the upper layers of tins from crushing the lower. As the war progressed, the wooden case was replaced with either thin plywood or cardboard cases, neither of which provided much protection.&lt;ref name="LRDG, 50"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 4-gallon containers carrying fuel were hazardous to the cargo ships carrying them. The leaking fuel would accumulate in cargo holds. At least one such ship exploded.&lt;ref name="green"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/books/007/7-3-1/CMH_Pub_7-3-1.pdf|title=Logistical Support of the Armies|accessdate=2010-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though adequate for transport along European roads, the 4-gallon containers proved extremely unsatisfactory during the [[North African Campaign]]. The crimped or soldered seams easily split during transport, especially off road over the rock strewn deserts of North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Norris|first=John
 |title=World War II Trucks and Tanks
 |year=2012|publisher=History Press
 |isbn=9780752490731}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the containers were easily punctured by even minor trauma. Because of these problems the troops referred to the 4-gallon containers as ''[[Flimsy|flimsies]]''.  Transport of fuel over rough terrain often resulted in as much as 25% of the fuel being lost through seam failures or punctures.&lt;ref name="LRDG, 50" /&gt;  Fuel leaks gave vehicles a propensity to catch fire.  The containers were routinely discarded after a single use, and severely hampered the operation of the [[British Eighth Army]].&lt;ref name="LRDG, 50" /&gt; A more successful and popular use for the 4-gallon container was to convert it into a cooking stove, referred to as a '[[Benghazi burner]]'.

When the British Army first saw the German fuel cans during the [[Norwegian Campaign]] in 1940, they immediately saw the advantages of the superior design.  The three handles allowed easy handling by one or two people, or movement [[bucket brigade]]-style.  The handle design also allows for two empty cans to be carried in each hand, utilizing the outer handle.

The sides of the can were marked with cross-like indentations that strengthened the can while allowing the contents to expand, as did an air pocket under the handles when the can was filled correctly. This air pocket allowed the container to float if dropped in water. Rather than a [[screw cap]], the containers used a cam lever release mechanism with a short spout secured with a [[flip-top|snap closure]] and an air-pipe to the air pocket which enabled smooth pouring (which was omitted in some copies). The interior was also lined with an impervious plastic, first developed for steel beer barrels that would allow the can to be used for either water or gasoline. The can was welded and had a gasket for a leak-proof mouth. 

The British used cans captured from the "[[Jerry (WWII)|Jerries]]" (Germans) – hence "jerrycans" – in preference to their own containers as much as possible. Later in 1940, Pleiss was in London and British officers asked him about the design and manufacture of the jerrycan. Pleiss ordered the second of his three jerrycans flown to London.&lt;ref name = daniel /&gt; After the [[Operation Crusader|second capture]] of [[Benghazi]] at the end of 1941, large numbers of [[Axis Powers|Axis]] jerrycans were captured, sufficient to equip some units such as the [[Long Range Desert Group]].&lt;ref name="LRDG, 50" /&gt;

=== Russian usage ===
The strength of the ''Wehrmachtskanister'' was determined in the [[Soviet Union]]. Its design was later copied and the [[Soviet Army]] accepted it as the standard container for liquids. This container is still being produced and used in modern Russia. In civilian use this container is used primarily for automotive fuel and lubricants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.molot.biz/product/kan.php |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120907170706/http://www.molot.biz/product/kan.php |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-09-07 |title=Steel containers for automotive fuel and lubricants (in Russian) |publisher=Molot.biz |date= |accessdate=2012-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern usage ===
[[File:Strv 103c a.jpg|thumb|left|A Swedish adaptation of the jerrycan stored on each side of the [[Stridsvagn 103]]]]

The German/British design jerrycan is still a standard fuel and other liquids container in the armies of the [[NATO]] countries.

Finnish designer [[Eero Rislakki]] designed a plastic jerrycan in 1970 with a small screwable stopper on the top side behind the handle to allow air flowing in to ensure smooth fuel outflow. It is lighter than the original design yet almost as sturdy. It was quickly adopted by the Finnish armed forces, and is commercially available.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5387">The '''lever rule''' is a tool used to determine the [[mole fraction]] (''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'') or the [[Mass fraction (chemistry)|mass fraction]] (''w&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'') of each phase of a [[Binary phase diagram|binary]] equilibrium [[phase diagram]]. It can be used to determine the fraction of liquid and solid phases for a given binary composition and temperature that is between the [[liquidus]] and [[Solidus (chemistry)|solidus]] line.&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;{{Citation | last = Smith.h | first = William F. halkias | last2 = Hashemi | first2 = Javad | title = Foundations of Materials Science and Engineering | edition = 4th | year = 2006 | publisher = McGraw-Hill | pages = 318–320 | isbn = 0-07-295358-6 | postscript =.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an alloy or a mixture with two phases, α and β, which themselves contain two elements, A and B, the lever rule states that the mass fraction of the α phase is

:&lt;math&gt;w^\alpha = \frac{w_{\rm B}-w_{\rm B}^\beta}{w_{\rm B}^\alpha-w_{\rm B}^\beta}&lt;/math&gt;

where
* &lt;math&gt;w_{\rm B}^\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the mass fraction of element B in the α phase
* &lt;math&gt;w_{\rm B}^\beta&lt;/math&gt; is the mass fraction of element B in the β phase
* &lt;math&gt;w_{\rm B}&lt;/math&gt; is the mass fraction of element B in the entire alloy or mixture
all at some fixed temperature or pressure.

== Derivation ==

Suppose an alloy at an equilibrium temperature ''T'' consists of &lt;math&gt;w_{\rm B}&lt;/math&gt; mass fraction of element B.  Suppose also that at temperature ''T'' the alloy consists of two phases, α and β, for which the α consists of &lt;math&gt;w_{\rm B}^\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, and β consists of &lt;math&gt;w_{\rm B}^\beta&lt;/math&gt;.  Let the mass of the α phase in the alloy be &lt;math&gt;m_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; so that the mass of the β phase is &lt;math&gt;m^\beta = m - m^\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the total mass of the alloy.

By definition, then, the mass of element B in the α phase is &lt;math&gt;m_{\rm B}^\alpha = w_{\rm B}^\alpha m^\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, while the mass of element B in the β phase is &lt;math&gt;m_{\rm B}^\beta = w_{\rm B}^\beta \left(m -m^\alpha\right)&lt;/math&gt;.  Together these two quantities sum to the total mass of element B in the alloy, which is given by &lt;math&gt;m_{\rm B} = w_{\rm B}m&lt;/math&gt;.  Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt; w_{\rm B}m = m_{\rm B} = m_{\rm B}^\alpha + m_{\rm B}^\beta = w_{\rm B}^\alpha m^\alpha + w_{\rm B}^\beta \left(m - m^\alpha\right)&lt;/math&gt;

By rearranging, one finds that
:&lt;math&gt;w^\alpha \equiv \frac{m^\alpha}{m} = \frac{w_{\rm B}-w_{\rm B}}{w_{\rm B}-w_{\rm B}}&lt;/math&gt;

This final fraction is the mass fraction of the α phase in the alloy.

==Calculations==
[[File:Lever rule.svg|thumb|400px|A phase diagram with tie line (LS). The x dimension defines the mass fraction of elements A and B.]]

===Binary phase diagrams===
Before any calculations can be made, a ''tie line'' is drawn on the phase diagram to determine the mass fraction of each element; on the phase diagram to the right it is [[line segment]] LS. This tie line is drawn horizontally at the composition's temperature from one phase to another (here the liquid to the solid). The mass fraction of element B at the liquidus is given by ''w''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;l&lt;/sup&gt; (represented as ''w''&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; in this diagram) and the mass fraction of element B at the solidus is given by ''w''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt; (represented as ''w''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; in this diagram). The mass fraction of solid and liquid can then be calculated using the following lever rule equations:&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;w^{\rm s} = \frac{w_{\rm B} - w_{\rm B}^{\rm l}}{w_{\rm B}^{\rm s} - w_{\rm B}^{\rm l}}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;w^{\rm l} = \frac{w_{\rm B}^{\rm s} - w_{\rm B}}{w_{\rm B}^{\rm s} - w_{\rm B}^{\rm l}}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''w''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is the mass fraction of element B for the given composition (represented as ''w''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; in this diagram).

The numerator of each equation is the original composition we are interested in +/- the '''opposite''' ''lever arm''. That is if you want the mass fraction of solid then take the difference between the liquid composition and the original composition. And then the denominator is the overall length of the arm so the difference between the solid and liquid compositions. If you're having difficulty realising why this is so, try visualising the composition when ''w''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; approaches ''w''&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;. Then the liquid concentration will start increasing.

===Eutectic phase diagrams===
[[File:Eutectic phase diagram Tie Line.png|thumb|1500px|Tie line in the Alpha plus Liquid two phase region]]

There is now more than one two-phase region. The tie line drawn is from the solid alpha to the liquid and by dropping a vertical line down at these points the mass fraction of each phase is directly read off the graph, that is the mass fraction in the x axis element. The same equations can be used to find the mass fraction of alloy in each of the phases, i.e. w&lt;sup&gt;l&lt;/sup&gt; is the mass fraction of the whole sample in the liquid phase.&lt;ref name="Callister"&gt;{{Citation | last = Callister | first = William D. | last2 = Rethwisch | first2 = David | title = Materials Science and Engineering An Introduction | edition = 8th | year = 2009 | publisher = Wiley | pages = 298–303 | isbn = 978-0-470-41997-7 | postscript =.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Linear density''' is the measure of a quantity of any characteristic value per unit of length.  Linear mass density ('''titer''' in textile engineering, the amount of mass per unit length) and linear charge density (the amount of electric charge per unit length) are two common examples used in science and engineering.

The term linear density is most often used when describing the characteristics of one-dimensional objects, although linear density can also be used to describe the density of a three-dimensional quantity along one particular dimension.  Just as density is most often used to mean mass density, the term linear density likewise often refers to linear mass density.  However, this is only one example of a linear density, as any quantity can be measured in terms of its value along one dimension.



Consider a long, thin rod of mass &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and length &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;.  To calculate the average linear mass density, &lt;math&gt;\bar\lambda_m&lt;/math&gt;, of this one dimensional object, we can simply divide the total mass, &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, by the total length, &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;m = \frac{M}{L}&lt;/math&gt;
If we describe the rod as having a varying mass (one that varies as a function of position along the length of the rod, &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;), we can write:
:&lt;math&gt;m = m(l)&lt;/math&gt;
Each infinitesimal unit of mass, &lt;math&gt;dm&lt;/math&gt;, is equal to the product of its linear mass density, &lt;math&gt;\lambda_m&lt;/math&gt;, and the infinitesimal unit of length, &lt;math&gt;dl&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;dm = \lambda_m dl&lt;/math&gt;
The linear mass density can then be understood as the derivative of the mass function with respect to the one dimension of the rod (the position along its length &lt;math&gt;m = \frac{dm}{dl}&lt;/math&gt;)

The [[SI]] unit of linear mass density is the [[kilogram]] per [[meter]] (kg/m).

Linear density of fibers and yarns can be measured by many methods. The simplest one is to measure a length of material and weigh it. However, this requires a large sample and masks the variability of linear density along the thread, and is difficult to apply if the fibers are crimped or otherwise cannot lay flat relaxed. If the density of the material is known, the fibers are measured individually and have a simple shape, a more accurate method is direct imaging of the fiber with [[Scanning electron microscopy|SEM]] to measure the diameter and calculation of the linear density. Finally, linear density is directly measured with a [[vibroscope]]. The sample is tensioned between two hard points, mechanical vibration is induced and the fundamental frequency is measured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/004051755802800809|title=Findings and Recommendations on the Use of the Vibroscope|journal=Textile Research Journal|volume=28|issue=8|pages=691|year=1958|last1=Patt|first1=D.H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=6703|title=ISO 1973:1995.

==Linear charge density==
Consider a long, thin wire of charge &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; and length &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;.  To calculate the average linear charge density, &lt;math&gt;\bar\lambda_q&lt;/math&gt;, of this one dimensional object, we can simply divide the total charge, &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;, by the total length, &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\bar\lambda_q = \frac{Q}{L}&lt;/math&gt;
If we describe the wire as having a varying charge (one that varies as a function of position along the length of the rod, &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;), we can write:
:&lt;math&gt;q = q(l)&lt;/math&gt;
Each infinitesimal unit of charge, &lt;math&gt;dq&lt;/math&gt;, is equal to the product of its linear charge density, &lt;math&gt;\lambda_q&lt;/math&gt;, and the infinitesimal unit of length, &lt;math&gt;dl&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

:&lt;math&gt;dq = \lambda_q dl&lt;/math&gt;
The linear charge density can then be understood as the derivative of the charge function with respect to the one dimension of the wire (the position along its length, &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;)
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_q = \frac{dq}{dl}&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that these steps were the exact same ones we took before to find :&lt;math&gt;\frac{dm}{dl}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[SI]] unit of linear charge density is the [[coulomb]] per [[meter]] (C/m).

==Other applications==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1162">In mathematics, a '''Listing number''' of a [[topological space]] is one of several [[topological invariant]]s introduced by the 19th-century mathematician [[Johann Benedict Listing]] and later given this name by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]. Unlike the later invariants given by [[Bernhard Riemann]], the Listing numbers do not form a complete set of invariants: two different two-dimensional [[manifold]]s may have the same Listing numbers as each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Reasoning and the Logic of Things: The Cambridge Conferences Lectures of 1898|first=Charles Sanders|last=Peirce|authorlink=Charles Sanders Peirce|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|year=1992|isbn=9780674749672|at=Footnote 70, pp. 279–280|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BWfRF5BAcG0C&amp;pg=PA279}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four Listing numbers associated with a space.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, pp.&amp;nbsp;99–102.&lt;/ref&gt;  The smallest Listing number counts the number of connected components of a space, and is thus equivalent to the zeroth [[Betti number]].&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, p.&amp;nbsp;99.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19435">'''Low molecular-mass organic gelators''' ('''LMOGs''') are a relatively new and dynamic soft materials capable of numerous possible applications; LMOGs are the monomeric sub-unit which form self-assembled fibrillar networks (SAFINs) that entrap solvent between the strands.&lt;ref&gt;Frkanec, L.; Zinic, M.  Chiral bis(amino acid)- and bis(amino alcohol)-oxalamide Gelators. Gelation Properties, Self-Assembly Motifs and Chirality Effects”  '''2010'''  ''Chem. Commun.''  46, 522-537.&lt;/ref&gt;  SAFINs arise from the formation of strong non-covalent interactions between LMOG monomeric sub-units. As SAFINs are forming, the long fibers become intertwined and trap solvent molecules. Once solvent molecules are entrapped within the network, they are immobilized by [[surface tension]] effects.  The stability of a gel is dependent on the [[chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] between the assembled network and the dissolved gelators. One characteristic of an LMOG, that demonstrates its stability, is its ability to contain an organic solvent at the [[boiling point]] of that solvent due to extensive solvent-fibrillar interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Hafkamp, R. J. H.; Feiters, M. C.; Nolte, R. J. '''1999''' ''J. Org. Chem.'' 64, 412.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Gels self-assemble through [[non-covalent]] interactions such as [[stacking (chemistry)|π-stacking]], [[hydrogen-bonding]], or [[Van der Waals interactions]] to form volume-filling 3D networks.  Self-assembly is key to gel formation and dependent upon reversible bond formation.
The propensity of a low molecular weight molecule to form LMOGs is classified by its '''Minimum Gelation Concentration (MGC).''' The MGC is the lowest possible gelator [[concentration]] needed to form a stable gel. A lower MGC is desired to minimize the amount of gelator material needed to form gels.  Super gelators have a MGC of less than 1 wt%.

[[File:Classification of Gels.jpg|thumb|Gels can be organized according to multiple characteristics. The source of the gel (natural/artificial), the gel's medium (organic/aqueous/areo/xero), the constitution of the gel (macromolecular/supramolecular), and the type of crosslinking the gel forms (physical/chemical).]]

==Background and significance==
LMOGs were first reported in the 1930s, but advances in the field were more often than not discoveries of chance; as there existed little theoretical understanding of gel formation. During this time LMOGs found applications in thickening lubricants, printing inks, and napalm.&lt;ref name=Esch&gt;Esch, J. H. We Can Design Molecular Gelators, But Do We Understand Them? '''2009''' ''Langmuir'' 25(''15''), 8392-8394.&lt;/ref&gt;  Interest in the field dwindled for several decades until the mid-1990s when Hanabusa, Shinkai, and Hamilton designed numerous LMOGs which form thermoreversible intermolecular amide-carbonyl hydrogen bonds.&lt;ref&gt;Hanabusa, K.; Tange, J.; Taguchi, Y.; Koyama, T.; Shirai, H.Small Molecular Gelling Agents to Harden Organic Liquids: Alkylamide of N-Benzyloxycarbonyl-L-valyl-L-valine '''1993''' ''J. Chem. Soc. Commun.'', 390.&lt;/ref&gt; The LMOGs developed by Hanabusa ''et. al'' were suitable for forming hard gels, including gels with chloroform, which had been resistant to gelation prior to their discovery. These new LMOGs were rationally designed and represented the first time that scientists had been able to discover new LMOGs based on [[supramolecular chemistry|supramolecular principles]]. From these earliest studies and screening numerous compounds, it was determined that for thermoreversible gels based on the amide-carbonyl hydrogen bond, amino acid structure, [[enantiomer|enantiopurity]], [[hydrophilic]]-[[lypophilic]] ratio, and increasing [[peptide]] substitution greatly affected the gelling ability of various new compounds.

The aforementioned principles that developed in this field's infancy have proved successful in allowing researchers to tune LMOGs for different functions.  Today, LMOGs have been extensively studied for their unique properties.  This newfound functional diversity has led to a wide range of possible applications for LMOGs in agriculture, drug delivery, pollutant/heavy metal remediation, luminescent devices, and chemical sensing.

==Gel formation and morphology==

[[File:Gel Pic.jpg|thumb|A LMOG liquid mixture forming a gel upon heating and cooling.]]
[[File:How to Make a Gel1.ogg|thumb|Making a gel]]
The majority of LMOGs can be triggered to form by manipulating the systems' properties, such as the [[pH]], [[solvent]], exposure to light, or by introducing [[oxidizing agent|oxidizing]] or [[reducing agents|reducing]] reagents.&lt;ref&gt;Bai, H.; Li, C.; Wang, X.; Shi, G.  A pH-Sensitive Graphene Oxide Composite Hydrogel  '''2010''' ''Chem. Commun.''  46, 2376-2378.&lt;/ref&gt;  Researchers have proposed a set of guidelines for successful gel formation&lt;ref name=Esch /&gt;

:1. It is necessary to have the presence of strong self-complementary and unidirectional inter-molecular interactions that can enforce 1D self-assembly.

:2. The solvent-fiber interfacial energy should be manipulated to control solubility and prevent crystallization of the LMOG.

:3. Some other factor must be present that can induce the fiber cross-linking network formation.

Traditionally, gel [[phase transitions]] are strictly temperature dependent.  However, it has recently been shown that non-liquid crystalline gelators, composed of (R)-18-(n-alkylamino)octadecan-7-ols (HSN-n), undergo first order gel-to-gel phase transitions; leading to different morphologies of the gel in [[carbon tetrachloride]] (CCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;Mallia, V.A.; Butler, P. D.; Sarkar, B.; Holman, K. T.; Weiss, R. G.  "Reversible Phase Transitions Within Self-Assembled Fibrillar Networks of (R)-18-(n-alkylamino)octadecan-7-ols in Their Carbon Tetrachloride Gels" '''2011''' ''J. Am. Chem. Soc.'' 133, 15045-15054.&lt;/ref&gt;  The uniqueness of this discovery stems from the idea that it is the solvent molecules entering and exiting the structure which leads to the different structural morphologies.  All other previously known gel phase transitions have occurred as the result of temperature changes and only one previous case documents this type of solvent dependent morphological change.  However, even in the case of N-isopropylacrylamide [[hydrogels]] that underwent conformational changes (folding and unfolding of their polymer chains); it occurred only via a temperature dependent process which resulted in water molecules, near the structure, entering or exiting the structure.&lt;ref&gt;Schild, H. G. '''1992''' ''Prog. Polym. Sci.'' 17, 163–249.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hirokawa, Y.; Tanaka, T. J. '''1984''' ''Chem. Phys.'' 81, 6379–6380.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, X.-Z.; Xu, X.-D.; Cheng, S.-X.; Zhuo, R.-X. '''2008''' ''Soft Matter'' 4, 385–391.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Qiu, Y.; Park, K. '''2001''' ''Adv. Drug Delivery Rev.'' 53, 321–339.&lt;/ref&gt;
The stability of a formed gelation matrix is dependent on the equilibrium between the assembled network and the dissolved gelator assemblies. 
LMOGs are functionally diverse and can be composed of both polar and non-polar regions ([[amphiphiles]]).

===Scanning electron microscopy===
[[File:2PAA (2).tif|thumb|SEM of a Low Molecular Weight Gelator]]

[[Scanning Electron Microscopy]] is a useful means for researchers to determine the structural properties of a low molecular-mass weight gel.  These gels exhibit a wide range of structures; from fibrous strands (of various lengths) to ribbons and tubes.  The structure of these gels is a key factor in their ability to gel solvents or water.  Their tertiary structure determines the critical gelation concentration of the gel.

==Rheological measurements==

Generally, [[rheology]] is used to study the flow of matter within a substance. In order for a substance to be considered a gel it must possess solid-like traits when characterized by rheological measurements. Rheological characterization, tests materials by applying stress to measure the material's resistance to deformation. From rheological measurements, a gel can be classified as either a "strong" or "weak" gel. This classification emphasizes the strength of the interactions between gelator molecules in a particular gel. A "weak" gel is often not considered a true gel because it does not conform to a purely solid-like material's rheological traits. Instead, "weak" gels are generally better classified as [[viscoelasticity|viscoelastic liquids]].

As a result of this distinction, these classes of gels demonstrate different elasticity as calculated by the [[elastic modulus]], a mathematical model for predicting the elasticity of different materials under different stressors. The [[shear modulus]] (G) of a "strong" gel exhibits a smaller dissipation of energy than "weak" gels, and the "strong" gel's G-values plateau for longer periods of time.&lt;ref&gt;Terech, P.; Weiss, R. G. Low Molecular Mass Gelators of Organic Liquids and the Properties of Their Gels "Chem. Rev." '''1997''', ''97'', 3133-3159.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, rheological properties of different gels can occasionally be used to compare naturally occurring biopolymer gels with synthetic LMOGs.&lt;ref&gt;Burchard, W.; Ross-Murphy, S. B. '"Physical Networks, Polymers and Gels'" Elsevier: London, '''1990'''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interactions of gel and solvent==

Researchers have not been able to reliably predict novel LMOGs. A key aspect in predicting new gelator materials is understanding the interaction between the gel molecules and the solvent. The most common solvents for LMOGs are organic in nature and result in [[Gels#Organogels|organogels]]. Much rarer are [[Gels#Hydrogels|hydrogels]], or gels that form with water as the solvent.&lt;ref&gt;Tritt-Goc, J.; Bielejewski, M.; Luboradzki, R. '''2011''' ''Tetrahedron'', 67, 8170-8176&lt;/ref&gt; Several attempts have been made to quantify the gel and solvent interaction using a variety of parameters:
:The '''single or multi-component solubility parameter (δ)''' of a solvent can give insight on how well-suited the solvent will be for gelation. Depending on the gelator/solvent system, a high solubility parameter can indicate high or low thermal stability of the gel.&lt;ref&gt;Hanabasu, K.; Matsumoto, M.; Kimura, M,; Kakehi, A.; Shirai, H. '''1999''' ''Colloid Interface Science'', 224, 231-244&lt;/ref&gt;
:The '''[[dielectric constant|dielectric constant (ε)]]''' reflects the bulk [[chemical polarity|polarity]] of the solvent.&lt;ref&gt;Bielejewski, M.; Lapinski, A.; Luboradzki, R.; Tritt-Goc, J. '''2009''' ''Langmuir'', 25, 8274-8279&lt;/ref&gt;
:The '''[[Dimroth-Reichardt parameter]] (E&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;(30))''' is a measure of ionizing power of a solvent.&lt;ref name=Muller&gt;Muller P. "Glossary of Terms Used in Physical Organic Chemistry" '''1994''' ''Pure and Applied Chemistry'' 66(''5''), 1077-1184&lt;/ref&gt;
:The '''Kamlet-Taft solvent parameters''' establish [[Solvatochromism|solvatochromic]] relationships which measure separately the [[hydrogen bond]] donor (α), hydrogen bond acceptor (β), and [[polarizability]] (π&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;) of solvents.&lt;ref name=Muller /&gt;
:The '''Hildebrand parameter''' measures the energy it takes to create a cavity within a solvent.&lt;ref name=Muller /&gt;

==Applications==

===Agricultural industry===

'''Pheromone release devices'''&lt;ref&gt;Jadhav, S. R.; Chiou, B.; Wood, D. F.; DeGrande-Hoffman, G.; Glenn, G. M.; John, G.  "Molecular Gels-Based Controlled Release Devices for Pheromones" '''2011''' ''Soft Matter'' 7, 864-867.&lt;/ref&gt;  Multiple reservoir-type controlled release devices (CRDs) have been developed to achieve the controlled release of highly volatile [[pheromones]] into an agricultural setting; whereby they could act as [[pesticides]] throughout the growing season.&lt;ref&gt;Shorey, H. H.; Sisk, C. B.; Gerber, R. G. '''1996''' ''Environ. Entomol.'' 25, 446.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, G. M.; Klamczynski, A. P.; Shey, J.; Chiou, B. S.; Holtmann, K. M.; Wood, D. F.; Ludvik, C.; DeGrandi-Hoffman, G.; Orts, W.; Imam, S.  '''2007''' ''Polym. Adv. Technol.'' 18, 636.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yosha, I.; Shani, A.; Magdassi, S.  '''2006''' ''J. Agric. Food Chem.'' 56, 8045.&lt;/ref&gt; There are several draw-backs associated with current CRDs because they involve multi-step preparation protocols, exhibit low pheromone-holding capacities, are not [[biodegradable]], and exhibit leaking of the pheromones when compressed or broken.  To address these functional issues a sugar alcohol-based amphiphilic super-gelator, [[mannitol]] dioctanoate (M8), has been developed that efficiently gelled the pheromones, [[2-heptanone]] and lauryl acetate.  The miticide, 2-heptanone controls the parasitic mite, varroa (''[[Varroa destructor]]''), that are responsible for honey bee (''Apis mellifera L'') colony destruction.&lt;ref&gt;Sammataro, D.; Finley, J.; LeBlanc, B.; Wardell, G.; Ahumada-Segura, F.; Carroll, J. M.  '''2009''' ''J. Agric. Res.'' 48, 256.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gashout, H. A.; Guzman-Novoa, E. '''2009''' ''J. Agric. Res.'' 48, 263.&lt;/ref&gt;  The researchers further developed the application of this supergelator by developing a reservoir-type CRD that consisted of the 2-heptanone gel in a vapor-barrier-film sealed pouch which was then activated by boring a small hole through the vapor barrier.  The CRD had a high loading capacity of 92% wt/wt allowing for the construction of small devices with a high biocompatibility and because, M8 is composed of mannitol and fatty acids it is also biodegradable.

===Drug delivery===

Researchers have been exploring LMOGs belonging to a class of molecules called cyclohexane trisamides due to their ability to form [[Gels#Hydrogels|hydrogels]]. By attaching [[functional groups]] to the gelator molecule, the researchers can adjust the gelation properties. The gels transition to the liquid state upon changes in temperature or [[pH]] &lt;ref&gt;K. J. C. van Bommel, et al., '''2004''' ''Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.'', 43, 1663-1667&lt;/ref&gt; Taking it one step further, the researchers attached an [[amino acid]] and a model drug to the gel molecule and added an [[enzyme]] to the gel matrix. When the temperature or [[pH]] was changed, the gel molecules entered the liquid phase where the [[amino acid]] and drug molecule could be cleaved from the gel molecule by the [[enzyme]]. Researchers believe these LMOGs may some day be used as a fast, two-step release drug delivery system.&lt;ref&gt;K. J. C. van Bommel, M. C. A. Stuart, B. L. Feringa, J. van Esch., '''2005''' ''Org. Biomol. Chem.'', 3, 2917-2920&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pollutant/heavy metal remediation===

In 2010 researchers developed phase-selective gelators toward the containment and treatment of oil spills.  They developed a class of LMOGs that were capable of gelling diesel, gasoline, pump, mineral, and silocone oils. These LMOGs were composed of dialkanoate derivatives of the sugar alcohols, mannitol and [[sorbitol]].  These sugar alcohol derivatives were ideal as they are biodegradable, inexpensive, and non-toxic.  Once the oil was taken up by the gel fibers; it could then be separated from the gel by utilizing [[vacuum distillation]] and furthermore the gelator could be recycled.&lt;ref&gt;Jadhav, S. R.; Vemula, P. K.; Kumar, R.; Raghaven, S. R.; George, J. '''2010''' ''Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.'' 49, 7695-7698.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Luminescent devices===

Some gels can be used in luminescent devices such as [[OLED|OLED's]] and/or fluorescent sensors. One example of an OLED type LMOG is mono-substituted ethynyl-pyrene. This gelator forms a stable gel with DMF, toluene, or cyclohexane while maintaining its luminescence. Another important characteristic of these gels is that they maintain high charge carrier mobility. This means that the gel can pass sufficient current in an electronic luminescent device.&lt;ref&gt;Diring, S.; Camerel, F.; Donnio, B.; Dintzer, T.; Toffanin, S.; Capelli, R.; Muccini, M.; Ziessel, R. "Luminescent Ethynyl-Pyrene Liquid Crystals and Gels for Optoelectronic Devices", '''2009''', ''J. Am. Chem. Soc.'', 131, 18177-18185.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, luminescent gels can also be utilized as sensors. These sensors operate by forming a stable luminescent gel in the presence of different [[analyte]]s. One example of a luminescent gel for sensing fluoride anions is presented by Prasad and Rajamalli. This example utilizes poly(aryl ether) dendrons attached to a core aryl ether with [anthracene] attached. Upon forming a stable yellow gel (under normal gelation conditions), if fluoride is introduced in the presence of the gel, the gel undergoes a gel to sol transition and becomes bright red. Being able to visually detect a color change in the presence of a dilute analyte is a promising field application of LMOG materials.&lt;ref&gt;Rajamalli, P.; Prasad, E. "Low Molecular Weight Fluorescent Organogel for Fluoride Ion Detection", '''2011''', ''Org. Lett.'', 13, 3714-3717.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical sensing===

Molecular gels can be sensitized toward an external stimuli aka light, heat, or chemicals. Also, LMOG's can be sensitized by the incorporation of a receptor
unit or a spectroscopically active unit into the gelator molecule.&lt;ref&gt;Sangeetha, N. M.; Maitra, U.  "Supramolecular Gels: Functions and Uses" '''2005''' ''Chem. Soc. Rev.'' 34, 821-836.&lt;/ref&gt;  A variety of quinoxalinones were recently developed that act as a mercury sensor by forming a gel when these [[ligand]]s complex to mercury.&lt;ref&gt;King, K. N.; McNeil, A.  Chem. Commun. 2010, 46, 3511–3513&lt;/ref&gt;  
A nonplanar dihydropyridine derivative was induced to gel upon oxidizing the molecule with nitric oxide and then dissolving the oxidized ligand in [[Dimethyl Sulfoxide|DMSO]]/water and then heating and cooling the mixture.  This gel has the useful application as it can therefore act as a nitric oxide sensor.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, J.; McNeil, A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2008, 130, 16496–16497&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Detail of millwork and sign, on the driveway side of the station. - Erie Railway, Port Jervis Station, Jersey Avenue, Port Jervis, Orange County, NY HAER NY,36-POJE,1-9.tif|right|thumb|300px|Several examples of different types of external decorative millwork are evident at an [[Erie, Pennsylvania]] train station]]
'''Millwork building materials''' are historically any [[Sawmill|woodmill]]-produced [[Construction#Building construction|building construction]] interior-finish, exterior-finish, or decorative components.  Stock profiled and patterned millwork building components fabricated by [[Milling (machining)|milling]] at a [[Planing (shaping)|planing]] mill can usually be installed with minimal alteration.&lt;ref name="geek"&gt;[http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-millwork.htm#did-you-know ''Did you Know?'']; article at Wise Geek online; retrieved March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, millwork also encompasses items that are made using alternatives to wood, including synthetics, plastics, and wood-adhesive composites.

==Specifics==
Millwork building materials include the ready-made carpentry elements usually installed in any building.&lt;ref name="creative"/&gt;  Many of the specific features of the space are created using different types of architectural millwork: doors, window casings, and cabinets to name just a few.&lt;ref name="geek"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hull"/&gt;  The materials used in millwork items today are most often graded-[[lumber]], [[building code|code compliant]] [[fasteners]], various [[glass]]es, and other decorative coatings and [[Wood finishing|finishes]].  Most millwork building materials can be installed with little or no modification as part of the construction process.&lt;ref name="geek"/&gt;

==Historical context==
[[File:Architect and engineer (1930) (14774970544).jpg|thumb|250px|right|Traditional interior millwork examples. Note the wall covers, as well as the door and window trim, are all custom-styled to complement the central focus point of the room – the fireplace mantle.]]
Historically, the term millwork applied to building elements made specifically from wood.&lt;ref name="creative"&gt;[http://www.creativemillworkllc.com/history-millwork-industry/ ''History of Millwork''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011235130/http://www.creativemillworkllc.com/history-millwork-industry/ |date=2012-10-11 }}; article; Creative Millwork Llc. website; retrieved June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  During the "Golden Age" of millworking (1880–1910), virtually everything in the house was made from wood.&lt;ref name="hull"&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Historic-Millwork-Re-creating-Nineteenth-Mid-Twentieth/dp/0471416223#reader_0471416223 ''Historic Millwork: Re-creating Nineteenth–Mid-Twentieth Century Millwork...'']; Hull, Brent; excerpts online; [[Amazon.com]]; p. xi&lt;/ref&gt;  During this time, the millwork produced in the United States became standardized nationwide.

Today, the increase in the use of synthetic materials has led many professionals to consider any item that is composed of a combination of wood and synthetic elements to also be properly defined as millwork.  This includes products that make use of pressed-wood chips in the design, such as [[melamine]] coated shelving.&lt;ref name="geek"/&gt;

==Fabrication==
There are two types of manufacturers of millwork goods.  In one, referred to as "stock millwork", [[commodity]] fabricators [[prefabrication|mass-produce]] trims and building components—with the end product being low cost, interchangeable items for commercial or home builders.  In another, the product is [[design engineer|custom]] produced for individuals or individual building projects—usually a costlier option&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.circletrim.com/wood-components-articles.aspx ''Wood Components'']; Circle Trim webpage; retrieved March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; which is referred to as "architectural millwork."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionaryofconstruction.com/definition/architectural-millwork.html ''Architectural Millwork'']; Dictionary of Construction online; accessed October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Millwork building materials are used for both decoration and to increase the utility of buildings.&lt;ref name="creative"/&gt;

==Types==
&lt;div style="-moz-column-count:2; column-count:2;"&gt;

*"Built-in" room elements (bookcases, entertainment centers, etc.)

The '''removal of heat from nuclear reactors''' is an essential step in the generation of energy from [[nuclear reactions]]. In [[nuclear engineering]] there are a number of empirical or semi-empirical relations used for quantifying the process of removing heat from a nuclear reactor core so that the reactor operates in the projected temperature interval that depends on the materials used in the construction of the reactor. The effectiveness of removal of heat from the reactor core depends on many factors, including the cooling agents used and the type of reactor. Common coolers for nuclear reactors include: [[heavy water]], the first alkaline metals (such as [[sodium]] and [[lithium]]), [[lead]] or lead-based alloys, and &lt;chem&gt;NaK&lt;/chem&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_reactor_coolant|title=Nuclear reactor coolant|last=|first=|date=|website=Wikipedia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_reactor|title=Nuclear Reactor|last=|first=|date=|website=Wikipedia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theoretical framework ==
The thermal energy produced in [[nuclear fuel]] comes mainly from the kinetic energy of [[Nuclear fission product|fission fragments]]. Therefore, the heat generated per volume unit is proportional to the fraction of nuclear [[Fissile material|fissionable fuel]] burned in the unit of time:

&lt;math&gt;Q=a\phi\Nu_0\sigma_f&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;N_0&lt;/math&gt; represents the number of atoms in a cubic meter of fuel, a is the amount of energy released in the fuel in each fission reaction (~181 MeV),  &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is the neutronic flux, and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_f&lt;/math&gt; is the effective section of the fission.

The total heat produced in the [[nuclear reactor]] is:

&lt;math&gt;Q=a\overline{\phi}\Nu_0\sigma_fV&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\overline{\phi}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Neutron flux|mean neutronic flux]] and V is the fuel volume (normally measured in &lt;math&gt;m^3&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fizica si Tehnologia Materialelor Nucleare|last=Ursu|first=Ioan|publisher=Editura Academiei Republicii Socialiste Romania|year=1982|isbn=|location=Bucuresti, Romania|pages=268–269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recovery of this amount of heat is achieved by using [[Nuclear reactor coolant|cooling fluids]] whose temperature at the entrance to the reactor channel &lt;math&gt;T_{f_0}&lt;/math&gt;  will increase with the distance traveled in the channel. The thermal balance of the channel is expressed by the relationship:

&lt;math&gt;Gc_pdT_f=q(z)n\pi r_0^2dz&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the flow rate of the [[Nuclear reactor coolant|cooling agent]], &lt;math&gt;c_p&lt;/math&gt; is the specific heat at constant pressure, &lt;math&gt;dT_f&lt;/math&gt; is the increase in the temperature of the fluid after passing a distance &lt;math&gt;dz&lt;/math&gt; in the channel, &lt;math&gt;q(z)&lt;/math&gt; is the heat generated per unit volume of the fuel, &lt;math&gt;r_0&lt;/math&gt; is the fuel cell radius and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of channel bars.

Under these conditions, the temperature of the [[Nuclear reactor coolant|cooling agent]] at distance z travelled into the cooling channel inside nuclear reactor is obtained by integrating the previous equation:

&lt;math&gt;T_f(z)=T_{f_0}+n(\pi r_0^2)(Gc_p)^{-1} \textstyle \int\limits_{0}^{z} \displaystyle q(z)dz&lt;/math&gt;

The difference between the temperature of the outer surface of the tube-channel &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and the temperature of the fluid is obtained from the relationship:

&lt;math&gt;\varphi=h(T_s-T_f)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Principles of Solid Mechanics|last=Richards|first=Rowland|publisher=CRC Press LLC|year=2001|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

where  &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is the local heat flow on the casing - cooler contact surface unit and &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the heat transfer agent casing-cooling agent.

The heat discharge from the [[Pressurized water reactor|PWR]] and [[Pressurized heavy-water reactor|PHWR]] reactors is made by pressurized water under forced [[convection]]. The general expression for determining the [[Heat transfer coefficient|transfer coefficient]] is given by the [[Nusselt number|Dittus - Boelter equation]]:

&lt;math&gt;\aleph u=aRe^{0.8}Pr^{0.4}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\aleph u&lt;/math&gt; is [[Nusselt number|Nusselt's number]] ( &lt;math&gt;\aleph u=\tfrac{hd_n}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the heat transfer coefficient, &lt;math&gt;d_n&lt;/math&gt; is the equivalent diameter, &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the thermal conductivity of the fluid); &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is a constant (&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;=0.023);  &lt;math&gt;Re&lt;/math&gt; is the number of Reynolds ( &lt;math&gt;Re=V\tfrac{d_n}{\mu/\rho}&lt;/math&gt;) &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the average velocity of the fluid in the section considered, &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the density of the fluid and &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is its [[Viscosity|dynamic viscosity]]); &lt;math&gt;Pr&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Prandtl number|number of Prandtl]] (&lt;math&gt;Pr=\tfrac{\mu c_p}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;).

If the flow of the fluid is made under conditions of a great difference between its temperature and the contact surface, the [[Heat transfer coefficient|transfer coefficient]] is determined from the relationship:

&lt;math&gt;      \tfrac{hd_n}{\lambda}=0.023 Re^{0.8}Pr^{1/3}(\mu/\mu_s)^{0.14}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mu_s&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Viscosity|dynamic viscosity]] of the [[Nuclear reactor coolant|coolant]] at the temperature of the adhering fluid film at the surface of the casing. The relation presented above is valid in the case of a long channel with &lt;math&gt;L/d_n&gt;60&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is the length of the channel.

The [[Heat transfer coefficient|transfer coefficient]] for cooling the pipes by natural [[convection]]&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; is obtained from:

&lt;math&gt;\aleph u=0.5(Gr\cdot Pr)^{0.25}(\tfrac{\mu}{\mu_s})^{0.25}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;Gr&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Grashof number]] given by the expression:

&lt;math&gt;Gr=\beta\Delta T\tfrac{gd_n^3\rho^2}{\mu^2}&lt;/math&gt;

We use the notation  &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; for the [[Thermal expansion|volume expansion coefficient]] of the fluid, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the gravitational acceleration and &lt;math&gt;\Delta T&lt;/math&gt; is the difference between the average wall temperatures of the casing and the cooling agent.

In [[Boiling water reactor|boiling water cooled reactors]] (BWR) and partly in pressure water cooled reactors ([[Pressurized water reactor|PWR]] and [[Pressurized heavy-water reactor|PHWR]]) the heat transfer is made with a vapor phase in the cooling medium, which is why this type of heat transfer is called heat transfer in a biphasic system. This allows obtaining much higher transfer coefficients than the one-phase heat transfer described in the Dittus-Boelter equation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:PressurizedWaterReactor.gif|thumb|550x550px|Coolant flow]]

Increasing the flow of heat, reducing the agent flow and lowering the pressure can lead to increased temperature of the cooled surface. If the temperature of the fluid in the channel section that we consider is lower than the boiling temperature under local pressure conditions, the [[vaporization]] is limited to the immediate vicinity of the surface and in this case the boiling is called submerged boiling. There is no proportionality between the heat flow and the difference between the surface temperature and the coolant temperature that allows the definition of a heat transfer coefficient similar to the one-phase case. In this situation we can use the equation of Jens and Lottes, which establishes a connection between the difference &lt;math&gt;\Delta T_s&lt;/math&gt; between the surface temperature and the boiling temperature of the cooling agent under local pressure conditions &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; below the thermal flux &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zitek|first=Pavel|title=Solution of heat removal from nuclear reactors by natural convection|url=https://www.epj-conferences.org/articles/epjconf/pdf/2014/04/epjconf_efm-13_02133.pdf|journal=EPJ Web of Conferences |volume=67 |page=02133 |year=2014|bibcode=2014EPJWC..6702133Z|doi=10.1051/epjconf/20146702133}}&lt;/ref&gt;      

&lt;math&gt;\Delta T_s=a\varphi^{1/4}exp(-P/P_0)&lt;/math&gt;  

where &lt;math&gt;a=7.9^\circ C cm^{0.5}W^{-0.25}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_0=6.43 MPa&lt;/math&gt;

If the temperature of the fluid in the channel section considered is slightly higher than the boiling temperature under local pressure conditions, the heat transfer is by boiling with nucleation, forming vapor bubbles trained by the cooling agent (that becomes biphasic throughout its entire volume). However, the vapor content is relatively small and the continuous phase remains the liquid phase. The vapor content of the PHW-CANDU reactor is about 0.03-0.04&amp;nbsp;kg steam / kg of agent, thus increasing the amount of heat transported by the unit mass of agent by over 10%. If the cooled surface temperature far exceeds the boiling temperature of the cooling agent in the channel section, the vapor content of the agent increases considerably, the continuous phase becoming the vapor phase and the liquid phase becoming only a suspension between vapors. The cooled surface remains covered with a liquid film which still provides a very high heat transfer coefficient, &lt;math&gt;\thicksim6\cdot10^4 W/m^2\cdot K&lt;/math&gt; at BWR compared to &lt;math&gt;\thicksim3\cdot10^4 W/m^2\cdot K&lt;/math&gt; at PWR. The film of liquid is continuously fed with drops from the agent [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspension]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

A further increase in surface temperature leads to a temporary interruption of continuity of the liquid film adhering to the cooled surface. Watering of the surface continues, however, by the drops of liquid in the [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspension]] that are present in the cooling agent as long as the heat flow remains below a value that depends on local conditions (value that is called critical flux). Over this flux there is a thermal transfer crisis characterized by a sudden decrease in the transfer coefficient due to the presence of only one-phase transfer. The heat transfer coefficient in the pre-crisis period can be determined from the relationship:

&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\aleph u}{Re^{0.8}Pr^{0.4}}=k_1B_0+k_2(1/\chi)^n&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\chi=((\Delta p)_l/\Delta p_g)_g)^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;

In these formulas the following notations were made: &lt;math&gt;dp&lt;/math&gt; is pressure losses for the two phases (water and vapors), &lt;math&gt;B_0=\varphi/d_n H_{gl}&lt;/math&gt; ( &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; - the thermal flux, &lt;math&gt;H_{gl}&lt;/math&gt;- the enthalpy of the biphasic liquid-gaseous mixture). The heat transfer coefficient during the crisis is related to the critical heat flow &lt;math&gt;\varphi_{cr}(W/m^2)&lt;/math&gt; through a linear relationship, of the equation type &lt;math&gt;\varphi=h(T_s-T_f)&lt;/math&gt; that was presented before:

&lt;math&gt;\varphi_{cr}=h_{cr}(T_s-T_{st})&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;T_s&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature of the surface in thermal transfer crisis, and &lt;math&gt;T_{st}&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature of the vapor at saturation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The critical flow is obtained by using the Kutateladze's formula:

&lt;math&gt;\rho_{cr}=0.14r\rho_v^{1/2}[g\sigma(\rho_l-\rho_v)]^{1/4}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; (J/kg)is the latent heat of vaporization, &lt;math&gt;\rho_l&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\rho_v&lt;/math&gt; are density of the liquid and saturation vapor, &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the superficial tension in N / m and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the gravitational acceleration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The heat transfer to the gas-cooled reactors is carried out by forced convection. For a gaseous thermal agent, the heat transfer coefficient can be deduced from a relation of the type Dittus-Boelter, but taking into account, for the intervening sizes, the values ​​corresponding to the average temperature of the fluid film denoted by the index &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;\aleph u_m=0.0205Re_m^{0.8}Pr_m^{0.4}&lt;/math&gt;

which differs in the use of water by a slightly lower value of the coefficient a.

Forced flow relationships established for fluids are also not valid for liquid metals. The coefficient of heat transfer for circular pipelines with constant heat flux, where the heat evacuation is achieved by the [[Turbulence|turbulent flow]] of the molten metals, can be estimated with a relation of the type:

&lt;math&gt;\aleph u=0.625Pe^{0.4}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;Pe&lt;/math&gt; is the number of Peclet (&lt;math&gt;Pe=Vd_n\rho c_p/\lambda&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{Unreferenced|date=October 2008}}
An '''onium''' (plural: '''onia''') is a [[bound state]] of a [[particle]] and its [[antiparticle]]. They are usually named by adding the suffix ''-onium'' to the name of the constituting particle except for [[muonium]] which, despite its name, is not a bound muon–antimuon onium, but an electron–antimuon bound state, and whose name was assigned by [[IUPAC]]. A muon–antimuon onium would be named [[true muonium]] or muononium.{{fact|date=April 2015}}

==Examples==
[[Positronium]] is an onium which consists of an [[electron]] and a [[positron]] bound together as a long-lived [[metastable]] state. Positronium has been studied since the 1950s to understand bound states in [[quantum field theory]]. A recent development called non-relativistic [[quantum electrodynamics]] (NRQED) used this system as a proving ground&lt;ref&gt;https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.56.8053&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Pionium]], a bound state of two oppositely-charged [[pion]]s, is interesting for exploring the [[strong interaction]]. This should also be true of [[protonium]]. The true analogs of positronium in the theory of strong interactions are the [[quarkonium]] states: they are [[meson]]s made of a heavy quark and antiquark (namely, charmonium and bottomonium). Exploration of these states through non-relativistic [[quantum chromodynamics]] (NRQCD) and [[lattice QCD]] are increasingly important tests of [[quantum chromodynamics]].

Understanding bound states of [[hadron]]s such as [[pionium]] and [[protonium]] is also important in order to clarify notions related to [[exotic hadron]]s such as [[mesonic molecule]]s and [[pentaquark]] states.

== Primary mission ==
The missions in 1964 involved a [[B-52 Stratofortress#B-52D|B-52D]] that left [[Sheppard Air Force Base]], [[Texas]] and flew across the [[United States]] to [[New England]] and headed out to the [[Atlantic Ocean]].  The aircraft refueled over the Atlantic heading north to and around [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]. The bomber changed course and flew northwesterly over [[Baffin Bay]] towards [[Thule Air Base]], [[Greenland]].  At this point it flew west across [[Queen Elizabeth Islands]] of [[Canada]]. Continuing to Alaska, it refueled over the [[Pacific Ocean]] again heading south-east and returned to Sheppard AFB.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nautilus.org/archives/library/security/foia/Denmark/ChromeDome1164n.PDF Nautilus.org: ''Chrome Dome Route Map'']&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1966, three separate missions were being flown - one East over the Atlantic and the Mediterranean, another north to Baffin Bay, and a third over Alaska.

[[File:Phase change - en.svg|thumb|right|340px|This diagram shows the nomenclature for the different phase transitions.]]

The term '''phase transition''' (or '''phase change''') is most commonly used to describe transitions between [[solid]], [[liquid]], and [[gas]]eous [[states of matter]], as well as [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] in rare cases. A phase of a thermodynamic system and the states of matter have uniform [[physical property|physical properties]]. During a phase transition of a given medium, certain properties of the medium change, often discontinuously, as a result of the change of some external condition, such as [[temperature]], [[pressure]], or others. For example, a liquid may become gas upon heating to the [[boiling point]], resulting in an abrupt change in volume. The measurement of the external conditions at which the transformation occurs is termed the phase transition. Phase transitions commonly occur in nature and are used today in many technologies.

==Types of phase transition==
Examples of phase transitions include:
*The transitions between the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of a single component, due to the effects of temperature and/or [[pressure]]:

* A [[eutectic]] transformation, in which a two component single phase liquid is cooled and transforms into two solid phases. The same process, but beginning with a solid instead of a liquid is called a [[eutectoid]] transformation.
* A [[peritectic]] transformation, in which a two component single phase solid is heated and transforms into a solid phase and a liquid phase.
* A [[spinodal decomposition]], in which a single phase is cooled and separates into two different compositions of that same phase.
* Transition to a [[mesophase]] between solid and liquid, such as one of the "[[liquid crystal]]" phases.
* The transition between the [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] and [[paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] phases of [[magnet]]ic materials at the [[Curie point]].
* The transition between differently ordered, [[ANNNI model|commensurate]] or [[commensurability (mathematics)|incommensurate]], magnetic structures, such as in cerium [[antimonide]].
* The [[martensitic transformation]] which occurs as one of the many phase transformations in carbon steel and stands as a model for [[displacive phase transformations]].
* Changes in the [[crystallographic]] structure such as between [[Allotropes of iron|ferrite]] and [[austenite]] of iron.
* Order-disorder transitions such as in alpha-[[titanium aluminide]]s.
* The dependence of the [[adsorption]] geometry on coverage and temperature, such as for [[hydrogen]] on iron (110).
* The emergence of [[superconductivity]] in certain metals and ceramics when cooled below a critical temperature.
* The transition between different molecular structures ([[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphs]], [[allotropy|allotropes]] or [[polyamorphism|polyamorphs]]), especially of solids, such as between an [[amorphous solid|amorphous]] structure and a [[crystal]] structure, between two different crystal structures, or between two amorphous structures.
* Quantum condensation of [[boson]]ic fluids ([[Bose–Einstein condensate|Bose–Einstein condensation]]). The [[superfluidity|superfluid]] transition in liquid [[helium]] is an example of this.
* The [[Symmetry breaking|breaking of symmetries]] in the laws of physics during the early history of the universe as its temperature cooled.
* [[Isotope fractionation]] occurs during a phase transition, the ratio of light to heavy isotopes in the involved molecules changes. When [[water vapor]] condenses (an [[equilibrium fractionation]]), the heavier water isotopes (18O and 2H) become enriched in the liquid phase while the lighter isotopes (16O and 1H) tend toward the vapor phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Phase transitions occur when the [[thermodynamic free energy]] of a system is [[analytic function|non-analytic]] for some choice of thermodynamic variables (cf. [[phase (matter)|phases]]). This condition generally stems from the interactions of a large number of particles in a system, and does not appear in systems that are too small. It is important to note that phase transitions can occur and are defined for non-thermodynamic systems, where temperature is not a parameter. Examples include: quantum phase transitions, dynamic phase transitions, and topological (structural) phase transitions. In these types of systems other parameters take the place of temperature. For instance, connection probability replaces temperature for percolating networks.

At the phase transition point (for instance, [[boiling point]]) the two phases of a substance, liquid and [[vapor]], have identical free energies and therefore are equally likely to exist. Below the boiling point, the liquid is the more stable state of the two, whereas above the gaseous form is preferred.

It is sometimes possible to change the state of a system [[diabatic]]ally (as opposed to [[adiabatic invariant|adiabatic]]ally) in such a way that it can be brought past a phase transition point without undergoing a phase transition. The resulting state is [[metastable]], i.e., less stable than the phase to which the transition would have occurred, but not unstable either. This occurs in [[superheating]], [[supercooling]], and [[supersaturation]], for example.

==Classifications==

===Ehrenfest classification===

[[Paul Ehrenfest]] classified phase transitions based on the behavior of the [[thermodynamic free energy]] as a function of other thermodynamic variables.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jaeger|first1=Gregg|title=The Ehrenfest Classification of Phase Transitions: Introduction and Evolution|journal=Archive for History of Exact Sciences|date=1 May 1998|volume=53|issue=1|pages=51–81|doi=10.1007/s004070050021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this scheme, phase transitions were labeled by the lowest derivative of the free energy that is discontinuous at the transition. ''First-order phase transitions'' exhibit a discontinuity in the first derivative of the free energy with respect to some thermodynamic variable.&lt;ref name = Blundell&gt;{{Cite book | last = Blundell | first = Stephen J. |author2=Katherine M. Blundell | title = Concepts in Thermal Physics | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-19-856770-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The various solid/liquid/gas transitions are classified as first-order transitions because they involve a discontinuous change in density, which is the (inverse of the) first derivative of the free energy with respect to pressure. ''Second-order phase transitions'' are continuous in the first derivative (the [[order parameter]], which is the first derivative of the free energy with respect to the external field, is continuous across the transition) but exhibit discontinuity in a second derivative of the free energy.&lt;ref name = Blundell/&gt; These include the ferromagnetic phase transition in materials such as iron, where the [[magnetization]], which is the first derivative of the free energy with respect to the applied magnetic field strength, increases continuously from zero as the temperature is lowered below the [[Curie temperature]]. The [[magnetic susceptibility]], the second derivative of the free energy with the field, changes discontinuously. Under the Ehrenfest classification scheme, there could in principle be third, fourth, and higher-order phase transitions.

Though useful, Ehrenfest's classification has been found to be an incomplete method of classifying phase transitions, for it does not take into account the case where a [[derivative]] of [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] diverges (which is only possible in the [[thermodynamic limit]]). For instance, in the [[ferromagnetic]] transition, the [[heat capacity]] diverges to [[infinity]]. The same phenomenon is also seen in superconducting phase transition.

===Modern classifications===
In the modern classification scheme, phase transitions are divided into two broad categories, named similarly to the Ehrenfest classes:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

First-order phase transitions are those that involve a [[latent heat]]. During such a transition, a system either absorbs or releases a fixed (and typically large) amount of energy per volume. During this process, the temperature of the system will stay constant as heat is added: the system is in a "mixed-phase regime" in which some parts of the system have completed the transition and others have not. Familiar examples are the melting of ice or the boiling of water (the water does not instantly turn into [[water vapor|vapor]], but forms a [[turbulence|turbulent]] mixture of liquid water and vapor bubbles). Imry and Wortis showed that quenched disorder can broaden a first-order transition. That is, the transformation is completed over a finite range of temperatures, but phenomena like supercooling and superheating survive and hysteresis is observed on thermal cycling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Imry | first1 = Y. | last2 = Wortis | first2 = M. | year = 1979 | title =  Influence of quenched impurities on first-order phase transitions| url = | journal = Phys.

Second-order phase transitions are also called ''continuous phase transitions''. They are characterized by a divergent susceptibility, an infinite correlation length, and a power-law decay of correlations near criticality. Examples of second-order phase transitions are the ferromagnetic transition, superconducting transition (for a [[Type-I superconductor]] the phase transition is second-order at zero external field and for a [[Type-II superconductor]] the phase transition is second-order for both normal-state—mixed-state and mixed-state—superconducting-state transitions) and the [[superfluid]] transition. In contrast to viscosity, thermal expansion and heat capacity of amorphous materials show a relatively sudden change at the glass transition temperature&lt;ref name="J. Non-Cryst 2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ojovan | first1 = M.I. | year = 2013 | title = Ordering and structural changes at the glass-liquid transition | url = | journal = J. Non-Cryst.

[[Lev Landau]] gave a [[Phenomenology (particle physics)|phenomenological]] [[Landau theory|theory]] of second-order phase transitions.

Apart from isolated, simple phase transitions, there exist transition lines as well as [[multicritical point]]s, when varying external parameters like the magnetic field or composition.

Several transitions are known as ''infinite-order phase transitions''.
They are continuous but break no [[#Symmetry|symmetries]]. The most famous example is the [[Kosterlitz–Thouless transition]] in the two-dimensional [[XY model]]. Many [[quantum phase transition]]s, e.g., in [[two-dimensional electron gas]]es, belong to this class.

The [[glass transition|liquid–glass transition]] is observed in many [[polymers]] and other liquids that can be [[supercooling|supercooled]] far below the melting point of the crystalline phase. This is atypical in several respects. It is not a transition between thermodynamic ground states: it is widely believed that the true ground state is always crystalline. Glass is a ''[[quenched disorder]]'' state, and its entropy, density, and so on, depend on the thermal history. Therefore, the glass transition is primarily a dynamic phenomenon: on cooling a liquid, internal degrees of freedom successively fall out of equilibrium. Some theoretical methods predict an underlying phase transition in the hypothetical limit of infinitely long relaxation times.&lt;ref&gt;Gotze, Wolfgang.

==Characteristic properties==

===Phase coexistence===
A disorder-broadened  first-order transition occurs over a finite range of temperatures where the fraction of the low-temperature equilibrium phase grows from zero to one (100%) as the temperature is lowered. This continuous variation of the coexisting fractions with temperature raised interesting possibilities. On cooling, some liquids vitrify into a glass rather than transform to the equilibrium crystal phase. This happens if the cooling rate is faster than a critical cooling rate, and is attributed to the molecular motions becoming so slow that the molecules cannot rearrange into the crystal positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 1995 | title =  Metallic Glasses| url = | journal = Science | volume = 267 | issue = 5206| pages = 1947–1953 |bibcode = 1995Sci...267.1947G |doi = 10.1126/science.267.5206.1947 | pmid =  17770105| last1 =  Greer| first1 =  A.

Extending these ideas to first-order magnetic transitions being arrested at low temperatures, resulted in the observation of incomplete magnetic transitions, with two magnetic phases coexisting, down to the lowest temperature.

The interesting feature of these observations of Tg falling within the temperature range over which the transition occurs is that the first-order magnetic transition is influenced by magnetic field, just like the structural transition is influenced by pressure. The relative ease with which magnetic fields can be controlled, in contrast to pressure, raises the possibility that one can study the interplay between Tg and Tc in an exhaustive way. Phase coexistence across first-order magnetic transitions will then enable the resolution of outstanding issues in understanding glasses.

===Critical points===
In any system containing liquid and gaseous phases, there exists a special combination of pressure and temperature, known as the [[critical point (physics)|critical point]], at which the transition between liquid and gas becomes a second-order transition. Near the critical point, the fluid is sufficiently hot and compressed that the distinction between the liquid and gaseous phases is almost non-existent. This is associated with the phenomenon of [[critical opalescence]], a milky appearance of the liquid due to density fluctuations at all possible wavelengths (including those of visible light).

===Symmetry===
Phase transitions often involve a [[symmetry breaking]] process. For instance, the cooling of a fluid into a [[crystalline solid]] breaks continuous [[translation symmetry]]: each point in the fluid has the same properties, but each point in a crystal does not have the same properties (unless the points are chosen from the lattice points of the crystal lattice). Typically, the high-temperature phase contains more symmetries than the low-temperature phase due to [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]], with the exception of certain [[accidental symmetry|accidental symmetries]] (e.g. the formation of heavy [[virtual particles]], which only occurs at low temperatures).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ivancevic|first1=Vladimir G.|last2=Ivancevic|first2=Tijiana, T.|title=Complex Nonlinearity|date=2008|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3-540-79357-1|pages=176–177|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wpsPgHgtxEYC&amp;pg=PA177 |accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Order parameters&lt;!--'Order parameter' and 'Order parameters' redirect here--&gt;===
An '''order parameter'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is a measure of the degree of order across the boundaries in a phase transition system; it normally ranges between zero in one phase (usually above the critical point) and nonzero in the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Compendium of Chemical Terminology  | editor = A. D. McNaught and A. Wilkinson | isbn = 978-0-86542-684-9 | doi = | publisher = [[IUPAC]] | url = http://goldbook.iupac.org/goldbook/O04323.html | accessdate = 2007-10-23| year = 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the critical point, the order parameter [[susceptibility (disambiguation)|susceptibility]] will usually diverge.

An example of an order parameter is the net [[magnetization]] in a [[ferromagnetic]] system undergoing a phase transition. For liquid/gas transitions, the order parameter is the difference of the densities.

From a theoretical perspective, order parameters arise from symmetry breaking. When this happens, one needs to introduce one or more extra variables to describe the state of the system. For example, in the [[ferromagnetic]] phase, one must provide the net [[magnetization]], whose direction was spontaneously chosen when the system cooled below the [[Curie point]]. However, note that order parameters can also be defined for non-symmetry-breaking transitions. Some phase transitions, such as superconducting and ferromagnetic, can have order parameters for more than one degree of freedom. In such phases, the order parameter may take the form of a complex number, a vector, or even a tensor, the magnitude of which goes to zero at the phase transition.

There also exist dual descriptions of phase transitions in terms of disorder parameters. These indicate the presence of line-like excitations such as [[Quantum vortex|vortex]]- or [[Topological defect|defect]] lines.

===Relevance in cosmology===
Symmetry-breaking phase transitions play an important role in [[physical cosmology|cosmology]]. It has been speculated by Lee Smolin and [[Jeremy Bernstein]] that, in the [[Big Bang|hot early universe]], the vacuum (i.e. the various [[quantum field theory|quantum fields]] that fill space) possessed a large number of symmetries. As the universe expanded and cooled, the vacuum underwent a series of symmetry-breaking phase transitions. For example, the electroweak transition broke the SU(2)×U(1) symmetry of the [[electroweak force|electroweak field]] into the U(1) symmetry of the present-day [[electromagnetic field]]. This transition is important to understanding the asymmetry between the amount of matter and antimatter in the present-day universe (see [[Baryogenesis#Baryogenesis within the Standard Model|electroweak baryogenesis]].)

Progressive phase transitions in an expanding universe are implicated in the development of order in the universe, as is illustrated by the work of [[Eric Chaisson]]&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, ''Cosmic Evolution'', Harvard, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; and David Layzer.&lt;ref&gt;David Layzer, ''Cosmogenesis, The Development of Order in the Universe'', Oxford Univ. Press, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Relational order theories]].

===Critical exponents and universality classes===
{{main|critical exponent}}
Continuous phase transitions are easier to study than first-order transitions due to the absence of [[latent heat]], and they have been discovered to have many interesting properties. The phenomena associated with continuous phase transitions are called critical phenomena, due to their association with critical points.

It turns out that continuous phase transitions can be characterized by parameters known as [[critical exponent]]s. The most important one is perhaps the exponent describing the divergence of the thermal [[correlation length]] by approaching the transition. For instance, let us examine the behavior of the [[heat capacity]] near such a transition. We vary the temperature {{mvar|T}} of the system while keeping all the other thermodynamic variables fixed, and find that the transition occurs at some critical temperature ''T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' . When {{mvar|T}}  is near ''T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' , the heat capacity {{mvar|C}} typically has a [[power law]] behavior,
:&lt;math&gt; C \propto |T_c - T|^{-\alpha}.&lt;/math&gt;

The heat capacity of amorphous materials has such a behaviour near the glass transition temperature where the universal critical exponent α = 0.59&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/1958/1/ojovanmi1_Topologically2.pdf |doi=10.1088/0953-8984/18/50/007|bibcode = 2006JPCM...1811507O |title=Topologically disordered systems at the glass transition|journal=Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter|volume=18|issue=50|pages=11507–11520|year=2006|last1=Ojovan|first1=Michael I|last2=Lee|first2=William E}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar behavior, but with the exponent {{mvar|ν}} instead of {{mvar|α}}, applies for the correlation length.

The exponent {{mvar|ν}} is positive. This is different with {{mvar|α}}. Its actual value depends on the type of phase transition we are considering.

It is widely believed  that the critical exponents are the same above and below the critical temperature. It has now been shown that this is not necessarily true: When a continuous symmetry is explicitly broken down to a discrete symmetry by irrelevant (in the renormalization group sense) anisotropies, then some exponents (such as &lt;math&gt;\gamma &lt;/math&gt;, the exponent of the susceptibility) are not identical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leonard|first1=F.|last2=Delamotte|first2=B.|year = 2015|title=Critical exponents can be different on the two sides of a transition| url = | journal = Phys. Rev. Lett. | volume = 115 | issue = 20| page = 200601 | arxiv = 1508.07852|bibcode = 2015PhRvL.115t0601L| doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.200601 |pmid=26613426}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For −1 &amp;lt; α &amp;lt; 0, the heat capacity has a "kink" at the transition temperature. This is the behavior of liquid helium at the [[lambda transition]] from a normal state to the [[superfluid]] state, for which experiments have found {{mvar|α}} = -0.013±0.003.
At least one experiment was performed in the zero-gravity conditions of an orbiting satellite to minimize pressure differences in the sample.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.68.174518 | title=Specific heat of liquid helium in zero gravity very near the lambda point | year=2003 | last1=Lipa | first1=J. | last2=Nissen | first2=J. | last3=Stricker | first3=D. | last4=Swanson | first4=D. | last5=Chui | first5=T. | journal=Physical Review B | volume=68 | issue=17| pages=174518 |arxiv = cond-mat/0310163 |bibcode = 2003PhRvB..68q4518L }}&lt;/ref&gt; This experimental value of α agrees with theoretical predictions based on [[variational perturbation theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.60.085001 | title=Critical exponents from seven-loop strong-coupling φ4 theory in three dimensions | year=1999 | last1=Kleinert | first1=Hagen | journal=Physical Review D | volume=60 | issue=8| pages=085001 |arxiv = hep-th/9812197 |bibcode = 1999PhRvD..60h5001K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 0 &amp;lt; {{mvar|α}} &amp;lt; 1, the heat capacity diverges at the transition temperature (though, since {{mvar|α}} &amp;lt; 1, the enthalpy stays finite). An example of such behavior is the 3D ferromagnetic phase transition. In the three-dimensional [[Ising model]] for uniaxial magnets, detailed theoretical studies have yielded the exponent {{mvar|α}} ∼ +0.110.

Some model systems do not obey a power-law behavior. For example, mean field theory predicts a finite discontinuity of the heat capacity at the transition temperature, and the two-dimensional Ising model has a [[logarithm]]ic divergence. However, these systems are limiting cases and an exception to the rule. Real phase transitions exhibit power-law behavior.

Several other critical exponents, {{math| ''β, γ, δ, ν''}}, and {{mvar|η}}, are defined, examining the power law behavior of a measurable physical quantity near the phase transition. Exponents are related by scaling relations, such as
:&lt;math&gt;\beta=\gamma/(\delta-1) , \qquad \nu=\gamma/(2-\eta)&lt;/math&gt;.
It can be shown that there are only two independent exponents, e.g. {{mvar|ν}} and {{mvar|η}}.

It is a remarkable fact that phase transitions arising in different systems often possess the same set of critical exponents. This phenomenon is known as ''universality''. For example, the critical exponents at the liquid–gas critical point have been found to be independent of the chemical composition of the fluid.

More impressively, but understandably from above, they are an exact match for the critical exponents of the ferromagnetic phase transition in uniaxial magnets. Such systems are said to be in the same universality class. Universality is a prediction of the [[renormalization group]] theory of phase transitions, which states that the thermodynamic properties of a system near a phase transition depend only on a small number of features, such as dimensionality and symmetry, and are insensitive to the underlying microscopic properties of the system. Again, the divergence of the correlation length is the essential point.

===Critical slowing down and other phenomena===
There are also other critical phenomena; e.g., besides ''static functions'' there is also ''critical dynamics''. As a consequence, at a phase transition one may observe critical slowing down or ''speeding up''. The large ''static universality classes'' of a continuous phase transition split into smaller ''dynamic universality'' classes. In addition to the critical exponents, there are also universal relations for certain static or dynamic functions of the magnetic fields and temperature differences from the critical value.

===Percolation theory===
Another phenomenon which shows phase transitions and critical exponents is [[percolation theory|percolation]]. The simplest example is perhaps percolation in a two dimensional square lattice. Sites are randomly occupied with probability p. For small values of p the occupied sites form only small clusters. At a certain threshold p&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; a giant cluster is formed and we have a second-order phase transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Fractals and Disordered Systems|author= Armin Bunde and [[Shlomo Havlin]] |year= 1996|publisher= Springer|url= http://havlin.biu.ac.il/Shlomo%20Havlin%20books_fds.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; The behavior of P&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; near p&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is, P&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;~(p-p&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;β&lt;/sup&gt;, where β is a critical exponent.

===Phase transitions in biological systems===
Phase transitions play many important roles in biological systems. Examples include the [[lipid bilayer]] formation, the [[Coil–globule transition|coil-globule transition]] in the process of [[protein folding]] and [[DNA melting]], liquid crystal-like transitions in the process of [[DNA condensation]], and cooperative ligand binding to DNA and proteins with the character of phase transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1080/07391102.2000.10506578 | pmid=10798534 | title=Long-range interactions between ligands bound to a DNA molecule give rise to adsorption with the character of phase transition of the first kind | year=2000| author = D.Y.

In ''biological membranes'', gel to liquid crystalline phase transitions play a critical role in physiological functioning of biomembranes. In gel phase, due to low fluidity of membrane lipid fatty-acyl chains, membrane proteins have restricted movement and thus are restrained in exercise of their physiological role. Plants depend critically on photosynthesis by chloroplast thylakoid membranes which are exposed cold environmental temperatures. Thylakoid membranes retain innate fluidity even at relatively low temperatures because of high degree of fatty-acyl disorder allowed by their high content of linolenic acid, 18-carbon chain with 3-double bonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = YashRoy | first1 = R.C. | year = 1987 | title = 13-C NMR studies of lipid fatty acyl chains of chloroplast membranes | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230822408 | journal = Indian Journal of Biochemistry and Biophysics | volume = 24 | issue = 6| pages = 177–178 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gel-to-liquid crystalline phase transition temperature of biological membranes can be determined by many techniques including calorimetry, flouorescence, [[spin label]] [[electron paramagnetic resonance]] and [[NMR]] by recording measurements of the concerned parameter by at series of sample temperatures.

In groups of organisms in stress (when approaching critical transitions), correlations tend to increase, while at the same time, fluctuations also increase. This effect is supported by many experiments and observations of groups of people, mice, trees, and grassy plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gorban|first1=A.N.|last2=Smirnova|first2=E.V.|last3=Tyukina|first3=T.A.|title=Correlations, risk and crisis: From physiology to finance|journal=Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications|date=August 2010|volume=389|issue=16|pages=3193–3217|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222687003|doi=10.1016/j.physa.2010.03.035|arxiv=0905.0129|bibcode=2010PhyA..389.3193G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''phosphoroscope''' is piece of [[Experiment|experimental]] equipment devised in 1857 by physicist [[A. E. Becquerel]] to measure how long it takes a [[Phosphorescence|phosphorescent]] material to stop glowing after it has been [[Excited state|excited]].&lt;ref name="UniversityAberdeen"&gt;{{cite web|title= Natural Philosophy Collection. Bequerel's ''&lt;nowiki&gt;[sic]&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' Phosphoroscope|publisher=University of Aberdeen|url=http://homepages.abdn.ac.uk/npmuseum/selected.php?id=31|accessdate=2014-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It consists of two rotating [[Disk (mathematics)|disks]] with holes in them. The holes are arranged on each disk at equal [[Angle|angular]] intervals and a constant distance from the centre, but the holes in one disk do not align with the holes in the other. A sample of phosphorescent material is placed in between the two disks. [[Light]] coming in through a hole in one of the discs excites the phosphorescent material which then [[Fluorescence|emits light]] for a short amount of time. The disks are then rotated and by changing their speed, the length of time the material glows can be determined.

'''Post-consumer waste''' is a [[waste type]] produced by the end consumer of a material stream; that is, where the waste-producing use did not involve the production of another product.

The terms of pre-consumer and post-consumer recycled materials are defined in the [[International_Organization_for_Standardization|ISO]] standard number 14021 (1999). These definitions are the most widely recognized and verified definitions as used by [[manufacturers]] and procurement officers worldwide. 

Quite commonly, it is simply the waste that individuals routinely discard, either in a [[waste receptacle]] or a dump, or by littering, incinerating, pouring down the drain, or washing into the gutter.

Post-consumer waste is distinguished from pre-consumer waste, which is the reintroduction of manufacturing scrap (such as trimmings from paper production, defective aluminum cans, etc.) back into the manufacturing process.  Pre-consumer waste is commonly used in manufacturing industries, and is often not considered recycling in the traditional sense.

==Types==

Post-consumer waste consists of:
*[[packaging]]
*parts that are not needed, such as fruit skins, bones in meat, etc.
*undesired things received, e.g.:
**advertising material in the mailbox
**a flyer received in the street without having the opportunity to refuse
**dust, weeds, fallen leaves, etc.
*things one no longer needs, e.g. a magazine that has been read, things replaced by new versions, clothes out of [[fashion]], remaining food that one cannot keep or does not want to keep
*broken things, things no longer working, spoiled food, worn-out clothes, clothes which no longer fit
*outgrown items toys, clothing, books, schoolwork
*[[disposable]]s such as [[Kleenex]] and finished [[battery (electricity)|batteries]]
*human waste, waste of pets, waste water from various forms of [[Washing|cleaning]]
*"post-life waste"
**one's body or ashes
**things people do not want and cannot sell
**broken/unused cars
**items that cannot be used

==Legal issues==

In many countries, such as the [[United States]], there is no [[reasonable expectation of privacy]] in post-consumer waste once it leaves the consumer's home.  Anyone can search it, including the [[police]], and any incriminating [[Evidence (law)|evidence]] recovered can be used at trial. This doctrine was established in The ''[[California v. Greenwood]]''  case, in which the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] held that there is no [[common law]] [[expectation of privacy]] for discarded materials. This has since led people to argue the legality of taking post-consumer waste for salvage value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scrappingmetal.blogspot.com/p/legality-of-scrapping-waste.html |title=Legality of Scrapping Metal  |date= |accessdate=2010-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sakurai's Object''' ('''V4334 Sagittarii''') is a [[star]] in the [[constellation]] of [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]]. It is thought to have previously been a [[white dwarf]] that, as a result of a [[very late thermal pulse]], swelled and became a [[red giant]]. It is located at the center of a [[planetary nebula]] and is believed to currently be in thermal instability and within its final [[shell helium flash]] phase.

At the time of its discovery, astronomers believed Sakurai's Object to be a [[Nova|slow nova]]. Later spectroscopic analysis suggested that the star was not a nova, but had instead undergone a very late thermal pulse similar to that of [[V605 Aquilae]], causing it to vastly expand. V605 Aquilae, which was discovered in 1919, is the only other star known to have been observed during the high luminosity phase of a very late thermal pulse, and models predict that Sakurai's Object, over the next few decades, will follow a similar life cycle.

Sakurai's Object and other similar stars are expected to end up as [[helium]]-rich white dwarfs after retracing their evolution track from the "born-again" giant phase back to the white dwarf cooling track. There are few other suspected "born-again" objects, one example being [[FG Sagittae]]. Having erupted in 1995, it is expected that Sakurai's Object's final helium flash will be the first well-observed one.&lt;ref name="The Astrophysical Journal"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Duerbeck|first1=Hilmar W.|last2=Benetti|first2=Stefano|title=Sakurai's Object—A Possible Final Helium Flash in a Planetary Nebula Nucleus|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=10 September 1996|volume=468|issue=2|pages=L111–L114|doi=10.1086/310241|bibcode = 1996ApJ...468L.111D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observation history==
[[File:Phot-21-96.gif|thumb|upright=1.0|left|Sakurai's Object, by Hilmar Duerbeck, [[ESO]]]]
An [[IAU Circular|International Astronomical Union Circular]] sent on February 23, 1996 announced the discovery of a "possible 'slow' [[nova]]" of [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] 11.4 by Yukio Sakurai, an amateur astronomer.&lt;ref name="ing"/&gt; Japanese astronomer [[Syuichi Nakano]] reported the discovery, drawing attention to the fact that the object had not been visible in images from 1993 nor in [[Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics]] records for the years 1930-1951, despite it appearing to slowly brighten over the previous years. Nakano wrote that "While the outburst [suggests] a slow or symbiotic nova, the lack of obvious emission lines one year after brightening is very unusual."&lt;ref name ="circular"&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1996IAUC.6322....1N|title=Novalike Variable in Sagittarius|journal=IAU Circ|volume=6322|pages=1|author1=Nakano|first1=S.|last2=Sakurai|first2=Y.|last3=Hazen|first3=M.|last4=McNaught|first4=R.

Following the initial announcement, [[Hilmar Duerbeck]] published a study investigating the "possible final [[helium flash]]" seen by Sakurai. In it, they noted that the location of Sakurai's Object corresponded to a faint object detected in 1976 of magnitude 21, and discussed other observations in the years 1994–1996, by which time the magnitude had increased to around 11–15.&lt;ref name ="Duerbeck1"&gt;{{cite journal|title= Sakurai's Object - A possible Final Helium Flash in a Planetary Nebula Nucleus|first1 = Hilmar|last1= Duerbeck|first2= Stefano|last2= Benetti|journal= The Astrophysical Journal|volume= 468|issue = 2|page= L111–L114|date= September 10, 1996|bibcode = 1996ApJ...468L.111D |doi = 10.1086/310241 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By investigating the measured fluxes, angular diameter, and mass of the [[nebula]], a distance of 5.5 k[[parsec|pc]] and [[luminosity]] of {{Solar luminosity|link=y|38}} was determined. The researchers noted that this was in agreement with their appearance and model predictions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= On the Evolution of Those Nuclei of Planetary-Nebulae That Experience a Final Helium Shell Flash|first1= I.|last1= Iben|journal= Astrophysical Journal|volume= 264|pages= 605–612|date= 1983|bibcode = 1983ApJ...264..605I |doi = 10.1086/160631 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the outburst luminosity was in the area of 3100 solar luminosities; lower than predicted by a factor of 3.

The first [[infrared]] observations were published in 1998, in which both [[Near-infrared spectroscopy|near]] and [[Far-infrared astronomy|far]] infrared [[spectroscopy]] data was presented. The collected data showed Sakurai's Object's steep brightening in 1996, followed by a sharp decline in 1999 as expected. It was later found that the star's steep decline in light was due to the [[circumstellar dust]] located around the star, which was present at a temperature of ~680 [[Kelvin|K]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Infrared Spectroscopy of Sakurai's Object |author= S.

Since 2005, it has been observed in the ejected particles of Sakurai's Object that [[photoionization]] of carbon is taking place.&lt;ref name="photoionization"/&gt;

==Properties==
Sakurai's Object is a highly evolved post-[[asymptotic giant branch]] star which has, following a brief period on the [[white dwarf]] cooling track, undergone a [[helium]] shell flash (also known as a very late thermal pulse).&lt;ref name="ing"&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=2000INGN....2....9P|title=The Sakurai Object: A Case Study in Advanced Stellar Evolution|journal=The Newsletter of the Isaac Newton Group of Telescopes (ING Newsl.)|volume=2|pages=9|author1=Pollacco|first1=P.|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Sakurai’s Object: characterizing the near-infrared CO ejecta between 2003 and 2007 |date= 2009 |journal= Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume= 393 |pages= 108–112 |first1= H. |last1= Worters |first2= M. |last2= Rushton |doi= 10.1111/j.1365-2966.2008.14135.x|bibcode = 2009MNRAS.393..108W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MNRAS1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Worters|first1=H.

Prior to its reignition V4334 Sgr is thought to have been cooling towards a white dwarf with a temperature around 100,000 K and a luminosity around {{solar luminosity|100}}.  The luminosity rapidly increased about a hundred-fold and then the temperature decreased to around 10,000 K.  The star developed the appearance of an F class supergiant (F2 Ia).&lt;ref name="hajduk"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hajduk|first1=M.|title=The Real-Time Stellar Evolution of Sakurai's Object|journal=Science|date=8 April 2005|volume=308|issue=5719|pages=231–233|doi=10.1126/science.1108953|accessdate=|bibcode = 2005Sci...308..231H|pmid=15821085}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The apparent temperature continued to cool to below 6,000 K and the star was gradually obscured at optical wavelengths by the formation of carbon dust, similar to an [[R CrB star]].&lt;ref name=pavlenko/&gt;  Since then the temperature has increased to around 20,000 K.&lt;ref name=hajduk/&gt;

The properties of Sakurai's Object are quite similar to that of [[V605 Aquilae]].&lt;ref name="photoionization"&gt;{{cite journal| last1= van Hoof|first1= P. A.

===Dust cloud===
{{See also|Cosmic dust}}
During the second half of 1998 an optically thick [[Cosmic dust|dust]] shell obscured Sakurai's Object, causing a rapid decrease in visibility of the star, until in 1999 it disappeared from [[Visible spectrum|optical wavelength]] observations altogether.&lt;ref name=pavlenko&gt;{{cite journal |first1= Y.V. |last1= Pavlenko |first2= T.R. |last2= Geballe |title= Models of infrared spectra of Sakurai's Object (V4334 Sgr) in 1997 |journal= Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics |volume= 390 |issue= 2 |pages= 621–626 |date= 2002|arxiv = astro-ph/0205528 |bibcode = 2002A&amp;A...390..621P |doi = 10.1051/0004-6361:20020732 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Infrared]] observations showed that the dust cloud around the star is primarily [[carbon]] in an [[amorphous]] form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Modelling the dust cloud around Sakurai's Object |first1= V |last1= Tyne |volume= 279 |pages= 139–147 |date= 2002 |journal= Astrophysics and Space Science|bibcode = 2002Ap&amp;SS.279..139T |doi=10.1023/A:1014672712630}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 it was discovered that the dust shell is strongly [[asymmetrical]], as a disc with a [[major axis]] oriented at an angle of 134°, and [[Orbital inclination|inclination]] of around 75°. The disc is thought to be growing more [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] due to the fast spectral evolution of the source towards lower temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Sakurai's Object (V4334 Sgr): evolution of the dust shell from 1999 to 2001 |journal= Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume= 334 |issue= 4 |pages= 875–882 |date= 2002 |first1= V |last1= Tyne|bibcode = 2002MNRAS.334..875T |doi = 10.1046/j.1365-8711.2002.05561.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= A dense disk of dust around the born-again Sakurai's object |date= 2009 |journal= Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics |pages= L17–L20 |first1= O. |last1= Chesneau |first2= G. |last2= Clayton |doi= 10.1051/0004-6361:200811173 |volume= 493|issue= 2 |arxiv = 0811.3295 |bibcode = 2009A&amp;A...493L..17C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Planetary nebula===
Sakurai's Object is surrounded by a [[planetary nebula]] created following the star's [[red giant]] phase around 8300 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Studying the old planetary nebula of V4334 Sgr |date=  2008 |volume= 391 |journal= ASP Conference Series |pages= 163–164 |first1= M. |last1= Hajduk}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been determined that the nebula has a diameter of 44 [[Minute of arc|arcseconds]] and expansion velocity of roughly 32&amp;nbsp;km/s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Modelling the Planetary Nebula |date= 2002 |volume= 279 |pages= 129–137 |journal= Astrophysics and Space Science |first1= Don |last1= Pollacco|bibcode = 2002Ap&amp;SS.279..129P |doi=10.1023/a:1014620711722}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Similarities to other stars===
Research in 1996 revealed that Sakurai's Object possessed the characteristics of a [[R Coronae Borealis variable]] star with the anomaly of [[Carbon-13]] (&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C) deficit. Also, the [[metallicity]] of Sakurai's object in 1996 was similar to that of V605 Aquilae in 1921. However, it is expected that Sakurai's object will grow in its metallicity to match that of V605 Aquilae.&lt;ref name=PN/&gt;

==Significance in astronomical research==
A significant amount of new star formation and star destruction data is expected to be recorded from continued observation of Sakurai's Object, as well as be used as reference data in the future research of similar stars.&lt;ref name=ing/&gt; The reason that stars such as Sakurai's Object and V605 Aquilae exist, as well as experience a shorter lifespan compared to most stars, is largely unknown. Sakurai's Object and V605 Aquilae have been observed experiencing born-again behavior for only 10 years, while FG Sagittae has undergone such behavior for 120 years. It is hypothesized that this is due to Sakurai's Object and V605 Aquilae evolving to the [[asymptotic giant branch]] of stars for the first time, while FG Sagittae is undergoing the process a second time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=2003ApJ...583..913L|title=Sakurai's Object, V605 Aquilae, and FG Sagittae: An Evolutionary Sequence Revealed|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=583|issue=2|pages=913|author1=Lawlor|first1=T.

[[File:Sesbania cannabiana 002.jpg|thumb|''[[Sesbania cannabina]]'']]
'''''Sesbania''''' is a genus of [[flowering plant]]s in the [[pea]] family, [[Fabaceae]], and the only genus found in tribe '''Sesbanieae'''. '''Riverhemp''' is a common name for plants in this genus.&lt;ref&gt;{{PLANTS|id=SESBA|taxon=Sesbania|accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable species include the rattlebox (''[[Sesbania punicea]]''), spiny sesbania (''[[Sesbania bispinosa]]''), and ''[[Sesbania sesban]]'', which is used in cooking. Plants of this genus, some of which are [[Aquatic plant|aquatic]], can be used in [[alley cropping]] to increase the [[soil]]'s nitrogen content. The species of [[rhizobia]] responsible for [[nitrogen fixation]] in ''Sesbania rostrata'' is ''[[Azorhizobium caulinodans]]''.

Some 60 species are currently accepted, with about 39 still unresolved. The largest number of species are found in Africa, and the remainder in Australia, Hawaii, and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/wairdocs/ilri/x5491e/x5491e0a.htm|title=The distribution of Sesbania species in the PANESA region|work=fao.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fossil record==
[[Fossil]] seed pods from upper [[Oligocene]] resembling ''Sesbania'' have been found in the Hungarian locality of Eger Wind-brickyard. The fossil species grew in a [[swampy]] and [[riparian]] environment.&lt;ref&gt;Distribution of Legumes in the Tertiary of Hungary by L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3096">'''AORA's Solar Flower Tower''' is a hybrid power generator that utilizes solar and alternative fuels, including [[diesel fuel]], [[natural gas]], [[liquefied natural gas]], [[biogas]], and other [[biofuels]], to provide a constant green power source targeted for community-sized production. A module, dubbed the Solar Flower Tower because it looks like a golden yellow [[tulip]], creates about 100&amp;nbsp;kW of [[electricity]]. The basis of the design is to use solar heated compressed air to spin a micro turbine. What makes the micro turbine unique is the efficiency of smaller power blocks, which allows small-scale construction, meaning simpler operation and less land needed.&lt;ref&gt;AORA [http://www.aora-solar.com/var/2310/200143-Aora_Brochure_JAN09_e.pdf Brochure]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==AORA==

Formerly known as EDIG Solar, AORA is an [[Israel]]i based company that develops solar-hybrid power generators. The EDIG group of companies has contracted engineering project with organizations such as [[Ministry of Defense (Israel)]], [[El Al]] Israel Airlines, and the National Health Service Provider. EDIG presently has a relationship with the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]], providing engineering services. It was at the Weizmann Institute of Science where the solar thermal technology was developed. After the technology was licensed to EDIG, continued advancement was developed until they decided to turned their new solar division into a sub-company, EDIG Solar, now known as AROA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aora-solar.com/ AORA website], retrieved 3 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==How the tower works==

In half an acre of land (about 40% of a football field), a solar tower module is surrounded by thirty [[heliostats]] reflecting the sun ray into a special solar receiver inside the module. The receiver heats the turbine's compressed air to about 1,000°C, and the heated air is sent into the turbine's expander to create electricity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://popsci.com.au/scitech/article/2009-06/sunsphere-new-solar-hybrid-power-plant First Hybrid Solar/Natural Gas Power Station Goes Online in Israel] Popular Science Australia&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Solarroller''' is a [[BEAM robotics|BEAM]] [[Drag racing|dragster]] [[photovore]] [[robot]] run by [[Photovoltaic module|solar panel]] that utlilizes [[sunlight]]. In competitions between solarrollers, each one must run one meter in the shortest [[time]] possible. Components include [[Pager|pager motor]]s,
[[capacitor]]s, [[resistor]]s, [[transistor]]s, and solar panels.

There are several different kinds of configurations of solarrollers, with bigger or smaller wheels, one or two motors. Configurations differences include: 
* [[electric motor|motor]] (number and output),
* [[wheel]]s (number and size), and 
* [[Structural system|frame]] designs

This robot type always moves forwards. The motor drives one or more wheels. A "[[Solar Engine]]" circuit is used to feed the robot.
Solarroller's speed is directly related to the amount of light robot registers on its optical sensor. Most are driven by an electronic "[[relaxation oscillator]]", in which a charge is accumulated in a capacitor while at rest and then suddenly released in the drive mechanism.

The '''i-REAL''' is a 'Personal Mobility Concept' made by automotive giant [[Toyota]] that was planned to be put on sale sometime around 2010. It is a development of previous Toyota Personal Mobility vehicles including the [[Toyota i-unit|i-unit]] and [[Toyota i-Swing|i-Swing]]. As with said previous vehicles, the i-REAL is a 3-wheeled electrically powered one-passenger vehicle, running on lithium-ion batteries.

In Low-Speed Mode, the vehicle is upright, and moves around at 'walking pace' at similar eyesight height to pedestrians, without taking up a large amount of space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Toyota Personal Mobility &gt; i-REAL |url=http://www2.toyota.co.jp/en/tech/p_mobility/i-real/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090816182954/http://www2.toyota.co.jp/en/tech/p_mobility/i-real/ |archivedate=2009-08-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In High-Speed Mode, the Toyota extends in length by leaning back and extending the single rear wheel to improve aerodynamics and stability, thus being able to achieve a speed of 18.6&amp;nbsp;mph, or 30&amp;nbsp;km/h. It leans into corners, like other tall, one-man vehicles such as the [[Segway PT|Segway]], to prevent it from tipping over.

There are two joysticks, one for each hand. Either joystick controls the i-Real, so left- and right-handed people will be equally at home. You push the joystick forwards to go forwards, left to go left, right to go right and pull back to stop. Perimeter-monitoring sensors detect when a collision with a person or object is imminent and alerts the driver by emitting a noise and vibrating. At the same time, it alerts people around it of its movements through use of light and sound.

The i-REAL was driven on the [[BBC|BBC's]] motoring programme [[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]] in 2008 by [[Richard Hammond]]. [[Top Gear (series 12)|(Series 12)]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7524">The '''Waelz process''' is a method of recovering [[zinc]] and other relatively low boiling point metals from metallurgical waste (typically EAF flue dust) and other recycled materials using a rotary kiln ('''''waelz kiln''''').

The zinc enriched product is referred to as '''''waelz oxide''''', and the reduced zinc by product as '''''waelz slag'''''.

==History and description==
The concept of using a [[rotary kiln]] for the recovery of Zinc by volatization dates to at least 1888.{{sfn|Clay|Schoonraad|1976|p=11}} A process was patented by Edward Dedolph in 1910. Subsequently, the Dedpolph patent was taken up and developed by [[Metallgesellschaft]] (Frankfurt) with [[Chemische Fabrik Griesheim-Elektron]] but without leading to a production scale ready process. In 1923 the [[Krupp Grusonwerk]] independently developed a process (1923), named the ''Waelz process'' (from the German ''Waelzen'', a reference to the motion of the materials in the kiln); the two German firms later collaborated and improved the process marketing under the name ''Waelz-Gemeinschaft'' (German for Waelz association).{{sfn|Harris|1936}}

The process consists of treating zinc containing material, in which zinc can be in the form [[zinc oxide]], [[zinc silicate (disambiguation)|zinc silicate]], [[zinc ferrite]], [[zinc sulphide]] together with a carbon containing reductant/fuel, within a rotary kiln at 1000&amp;nbsp;°C to 1500&amp;nbsp;°C.{{sfn|Clay|Schoonraad|1976|p=11}} The kiln feed material comprising zinc 'waste', fluxes and reductant (coke) is typically pelletized before addition to the kiln.&lt;ref name="z2000"/&gt; The chemical process involves the reduction of zinc compounds to elemental zinc (boiling point 907&amp;nbsp;°C) which volatalises, which oxidises in the vapour phase to zinc oxide. The zinc oxide is collected from the kiln outlet exhaust by filters/electrostatic precipitators/settling chambers etc.{{sfn|Clay|Schoonraad|1976|pp=11, 13}}&lt;ref name="z2000"&gt;{{harvnb|Stewart|Daley|Stephens|2000|loc = [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118788073.ch29/summary Recovery of Zinc Oxide from secondary raw materials : New developments of the Waelz Process]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kiln size is typically {{convert|50|by|3.6|m}} long / internal diameter, with a rotation speed of around 1 rpm. The recovered dust (''Waelz oxide'') is enriched in zinc oxide and is a feed product for zinc smelters, the zinc reduced by-product is known as ''Waelz slag''. Sub-optimal features of the process are high energy consumption, and lack of iron recovery (and iron rich slag).&lt;ref name="z2000"/&gt; The process also captures other low boiling metals in the ''waelz oxide'' including lead, cadmium and silver.{{sfn|Antrekowitsch|Steinlechner|Unger|Rösler|2014|p=118}} Halogen compounds are also present in the product oxide.{{sfn|Antrekowitsch|Steinlechner|Unger|Rösler|2014|p=119}}

Increased use of [[galvanised]] steel has resulted in increased levels of zinc in steel scrap which in turn leads to higher levels of zinc in [[electric arc furnace]] flue dusts - as of 2000 the waelz process is considered to be a "[[best available technology]]" for flue dust zinc recovery, and the process is used at industrial scale worldwide.{{sfn|Stewart|Daley|Stephens|2000|loc = [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118788073.ch29/summary Recovery of Zinc Oxide from secondary raw materials : New developments of the Waelz Process]}}

As of 2014 the Waelz process is the preferred or most widely used process for zinc recovery of zinc from [[electric arc furnace]] dust (90%).{{sfn|Antrekowitsch|Steinlechner|Unger|Rösler|2014|pp=117-118, 119}}

A '''warm core ring''' is a type of [[mesoscale meteorology|mesoscale]] [[Eddy (fluid dynamics)|eddy]] which breaks off from an [[ocean current]], e.g. the [[Gulf Stream]] or the [[Kuroshio Current]]. The ring is an independent circulatory system of warm water which can persist for several months.&lt;ref name = "mult1"&gt;{{Cite web

Such rings can be detected using infrared satellites or sea height anomalies and are easily identifiable against the surrounding colder waters. These systems will drift west from their origin at the Gulf Stream until they break apart on the coastal shelf or are reabsorbed by the Gulf Stream.

This type of system is theorized to have helped develop several hurricanes, most notably [[Hurricane Katrina]], into significantly stronger storms due to the abundance of warmer ocean water reaching down to a significant depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Warm core rings are also known for affecting wildlife, bringing warm-water creatures to unusual areas.

==Formation and Movement==
[[File:US gulf warm core ring.jpg|thumb | left | The Gulf Stream is shown in dark blue. Warm core rings are shown in purple (newer) and light blue (older) drifting westward away from their origin.]]

===Formation===
As the [[Gulf Stream]] flows and moves over time, it can develop large loops which can eventually be pinched off from the current, forming an independent eddy of warmer [[Sargasso Sea]] water&lt;ref name="mult3" /&gt; circulating clockwise similar to the direction of the Gulf Stream.&lt;ref name="mult2" /&gt; While many warm core rings are created in the [[Gulf of Mexico]], they can develop anywhere along the eastern coast of the United States north of the Gulf Stream.&lt;ref name="mult3" /&gt; Rings are anywhere from 100–200&amp;nbsp;km across and can include warmer waters as deep as 1500 meters.&lt;ref name="mult3" /&gt; These rings develop every 6–11 months on average.&lt;ref name="mult2"&gt;{{Cite web

  | format =

===Movement===
Rings will drift to the west-southwest at 3–5&amp;nbsp;km/day for several months up to a year.&lt;ref name="mult2" /&gt; The rings always rotate clockwise due to the direction of the Gulf Stream and can reach rotational velocities of up to 1&amp;nbsp;m/s.&lt;ref name="mult1" /&gt; Usually warm core rings cannot move onto the [[continental shelf]] because they reach deeper than the seafloor on the shelf by over 1000 meters, though they can near the shelf.&lt;ref name="mult3" /&gt;

===Disbanding===
Warm core rings are often reabsorbed by the Gulf Stream, but they can break apart on their own as well if they move onto the continental shelf.&lt;ref name = "mult1" /&gt;

==Detection and Tracking==
Warm core rings are easily observed in the Gulf of Mexico or elsewhere through the use of [[Infrared photography|infrared imagery]] by [[weather satellite]]s.&lt;ref name = "mult3" /&gt; Since the ocean water temperature of the ring is significantly higher than the surrounding waters, these rings show up easily in infrared images. This, coupled with models of ring movement, allow well-developed tracking of the rings. Because warm core rings include warm water to a significant depth, infrared satellites can differentiate the temperature, unlike [[cold core ring]]s, which cannot be easily detected.

Warm core rings are also detected by sea surface height anomalies. Since warm water takes up more space as it expands than cold water, the large amount of warm water causes an upwelling in sea height which can be detected by buoys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==Adverse Effects==
===Intensification of Hurricanes===
Warm core rings have been linked to the intensification of several hurricanes passing over their location. Because high [[sea surface temperature]] as well as warmer water at greater depth is the primary intensifier of a [[hurricane]], warm core rings account for tremendous strengthening of these storms.

Notably, [[Hurricane Opal]] passed over a ring and had sudden increases of wind speed from 110 miles per hour to 135 miles per hour shortly before landfall, a trend also seen in [[Hurricane Allen]] and [[Hurricane Camille]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

===Effects on Wildlife===
Warm core rings typically include far less biological specimens than the surrounding ocean. When the rings approach continental shelves, coastal currents are affected, which can cause organisms to drift onto the shelf that ordinarily would not be there. In fact, there are human accounts of sea turtles and tropical fish which normally live in much warmer waters coming near the coastal shelf due to the deep, warm waters of a warm core ring.&lt;ref name="mult3" /&gt;

===Damages to Offshore Drilling===
Due to currents around warm core rings of up to nearly 5 miles per hour, this phenomenon can damage offshore oil platforms and increase the risk of accidents.&lt;ref name="mult3"&gt;{{Cite web

==Larval Transport==
Many fish species’ life cycle involves two distinct habitats.  The adults live in warmer temperate waters south of Cape Hatteras, NC while the juveniles are found in estuaries of cooler waters north of Cape Hatteras.&lt;ref name="LTrans1"&gt;Able, K.W. and M.P. Fahay (1998). The first year in the life of estuarine fishes in the Middle Atlantic Bight. New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LTrans2"&gt;Hare, J.A. and R.K. Cowen (1996). Transport mechanisms of larval and pelagic juvenile bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix) from South Atlantic Bight spawning grounds to Middle Atlantic Bight nursery habitats. Limnology and Oceanography 41(6): 1264-1280.&lt;/ref&gt; Warm Core Rings play an important role in the transport of [[ichthyoplankton|larvae]] between the two habitats. Species like the [[bluefish]] (Pomatomus saltatrix) and pearly razorfish (Xyrichtys novacula) spawn near the western edge of the [[Gulf Stream]] just south of Cape Hatteras.&lt;ref name=LTrans1 /&gt;  Because of the convergence of the Gulf Stream from the south and cooler coastal water current from the north, most water around Cape Hatteras flows into the Gulf Stream.&lt;ref name=LTrans2 /&gt;  The larvae released near this convergence is swept into the Gulf Stream and flows north.  Since the larvae are [[plankton]]ic, they don’t swim into the center of the Gulf Stream but stay near the western edge.&lt;ref name=LTrans2 /&gt;&lt;ref name="LTrans3"&gt;Hare, J.A. and R.K. Cowen (1991). Expatriation of Xyrichtys novacula (Pisces: Labridae) larvae: Evidence of rapid cross-slope exchange. [[Journal of Marine Research]] 49: 801-823.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LTrans4"&gt;Cowen, R.K., J.A. Hare, and M.P. Fahay (1993). Beyond hydrography: Can physical processes explain larval fish assemblages within the Middle Atlantic Bight? Bulletin of Marine Science. 53: 567-587.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is beneficial for when warm core rings form. Warm core rings are formed when the crest of a meander breaks off from the Gulf Stream. Any larvae in the crest of the meanders are then entrapped in the warm core ring.&lt;ref name=LTrans2 /&gt;  Once the warm core ring breaks way, it takes a southwesternly path towards the coast.&lt;ref name=LTrans2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=LTrans3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=LTrans4 /&gt; The interaction between warm core rings and the [[continental shelf]] creates a weakening of the ring and enables the larvae to escape and continue their journey to nearby [[estuaries]].  The warm core rings formed along the northeastern states can last between 4 and 5 months.&lt;ref&gt;Auer, S.J. (1987). Five-year climatological survey of the Gulf Stream system and its associated rings. Journal of Geophysical Research 92: 11709-11726.&lt;/ref&gt;  During this time the larvae grow so that by the time they reach the estuaries, they are able to swim away from the warm core ring into the estuaries.

{{Nuclear weapons}}
'''Weapons-grade nuclear material'''  is any fissionable [[nuclear material]] that is pure enough to make a [[nuclear weapon]] or has properties that make it particularly suitable for nuclear weapons use. [[Plutonium]] and [[uranium]] in grades normally used in nuclear weapons are the most common examples. (These nuclear materials have [[special nuclear material|other categorizations]] based on their purity.)

Only [[fissile]] [[isotope]]s of certain elements have the [[Critical mass#Critical mass of a bare sphere|potential]] for use in nuclear weapons. For such use, the concentration of fissile isotopes [[uranium-235]] and [[plutonium-239]] in the element used must be sufficiently high. Uranium from natural sources is enriched by [[isotope separation]], and plutonium is produced in a suitable [[nuclear reactor]].

Experiments have been conducted with [[uranium-233]]. [[Neptunium-237]] and some isotopes of [[americium]] might be usable, but it is not clear that this has ever been implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Countries that have produced weapons-grade nuclear material==

Ten countries have produced weapons-grade nuclear material:&lt;ref name=IEER-2004&gt;{{dubious|source refers only to uranium, not plutonium|date=May 2017}}{{Cite web |url=http://www.ieer.org/reports/uranium/enrichment.pdf |title=Uranium Enrichment: Just Plain Facts to Fuel an Informed Debate on Nuclear Proliferation and Nuclear Power |first1=Arjun |last1=Makhijani |first2=Lois |last2=Chalmers |first3=Brice |last3=Smith |date=October 15, 2004 |publisher=[[Institute for Energy and Environmental Research]] |accessdate=May 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Five recognized "[[nuclear-weapon states]]" under the terms of the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] (NPT): the [[United States and weapons of mass destruction|United States]] ([[Trinity (nuclear test)|first nuclear weapon tested]] and two bombs [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|used as weapons in 1945]]), [[Russia and weapons of mass destruction|Russia]] ([[RDS-1|first weapon tested in 1949]]), the [[United Kingdom and weapons of mass destruction|United Kingdom]] ([[Operation Hurricane|1952]]), [[France and weapons of mass destruction|France]] ([[Reggane series, French nuclear tests|1960]]), and [[China and weapons of mass destruction|China]] ([[596 (nuclear test)|1964]])
* Three other declared nuclear states that are not signatories of the NPT: [[India and weapons of mass destruction|India]] (not a signatory, [[Smiling Buddha|weapon tested in 1974]]), [[Pakistan and weapons of mass destruction|Pakistan]] (not a signatory, [[Chagai-I|weapon tested in 1998]]), and [[North Korea and weapons of mass destruction|North Korea]] (withdrew from the NPT in 2003, [[2006 North Korean nuclear test|weapon tested in 2006]])
* [[Nuclear weapons and Israel|Israel]], which is widely known to have developed nuclear weapons (likely first tested in the 1960s or 1970s) but has not openly declared its capability
* [[South Africa and weapons of mass destruction|South Africa]], which also had enrichment capabilities and developed nuclear weapons (possibly [[Vela Incident|tested in 1979]]), but disassembled its arsenal and joined the NPT in 1991

==Weapons-grade uranium==
{{anchor|Weapons-grade#Weapons-grade uranium}}
[[Natural uranium]] is made weapons-grade through [[isotopic enrichment]]. Initially only about 0.7% of it is [[fissile]] U-235, with the rest being almost entirely [[uranium-238]] (U-238). They are separated by their differing [[mass]]es. [[Highly enriched uranium]] is considered weapons-grade when it has been enriched to about 90% U-235.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

U-233 is produced from [[thorium-232]] by [[neutron capture]]. The U-233 produced thus does not require enrichment and can be relatively easily chemically separated from residual Th-232. It is therefore regulated as a [[special nuclear material]] only by the total amount present. U-233 may be intentionally down-blended with U-238 to remove proliferation concerns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ornl.gov/info/reports/1998/3445606041609.pdf Definition of Weapons-Usable Uranium-233] [[ORNL]]/TM-13517&lt;/ref&gt;

While U-233 would thus seem ideal for weaponization, a significant obstacle to that goal is the co-production of trace amounts of [[uranium-232]] due to side-reactions. U-232 hazards, a result of its highly radioactive decay products such as [[thallium-208]], are significant even at 5 [[parts per million]]. [[Implosion nuclear weapon]]s require U-232 levels below 50 PPM (above which the U-233 is considered "low grade"; [[cf.]] "Standard weapon grade plutonium requires a [[Pu-240]] content of no more than 6.5%." which is 65,000 PPM, and the analogous [[Pu-238]] was produced in levels of 0.5% (5000 PPM) or less). [[Gun-type fission weapon]]s would require low U-232 levels and low levels of light impurities on the order of 1 PPM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq6.html Nuclear Materials] FAQ&lt;/ref&gt;

==Weapons-grade plutonium==
{{anchor|Weapons-grade#Weapons-grade plutonium}}
{{See also|Reactor-grade plutonium}}
Pu-239 is produced artificially in [[nuclear reactor]]s when a neutron is absorbed by U-238, forming U-239, which then [[radioactive decay|decays]] in a rapid two-step process into Pu-239. It can then be separated from the uranium in a [[nuclear reprocessing]] plant.

Weapons-grade plutonium is defined as being predominantly [[Pu-239]], typically about 93% Pu-239.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reactor-Grade and Weapons-Grade Plutonium  in Nuclear Explosives|url=http://www.ccnr.org/plute.html|work=Nonproliferation and Arms Control Assessment of Weapons-Usable Fissile Material Storage  and Excess Plutonium Disposition Alternatives (excerpted)|publisher=U.S. Department of Energy |accessdate=September 5, 2011 |date=January 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pu-240 is produced when Pu-239 absorbs an additional neutron and fails to fission. Pu-240 and Pu-239 are not separated by reprocessing. Pu-240 has a high rate of [[spontaneous fission]], which can cause a nuclear weapon to pre-detonate. This makes plutonium unsuitable for use in [[Gun-type fission weapon|gun-type nuclear weapons]]. To reduce the concentration of Pu-240 in the plutonium produced, weapons program plutonium production reactors (e.g. [[B Reactor]]) irradiate the uranium for a far shorter time than is normal for a [[nuclear power reactor]]. More precisely, weapons-grade plutonium is obtained from uranium irradiated to a low [[burnup]].

This represents a fundamental difference between these two types of reactor. In a nuclear power station, high burnup is desirable. Power stations such as the obsolete British [[Magnox]] and French [[UNGG]] reactors, which were designed to produce either electricity or weapons material, were operated at low power levels with frequent fuel changes using [[online refuelling]] to produce weapons-grade plutonium. Such operation is not possible with the [[light water reactor]]s most commonly used to produce electric power. In these the reactor must be shut down and the pressure vessel disassembled to gain access to the irradiated fuel.

Plutonium recovered from LWR spent fuel, while not weapons grade, can be used to produce nuclear weapons at all levels of sophistication,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holdren|first=John|author2=Matthew Bunn |title=Managing military uranium and plutonium in the United States and the former Soviet Union |journal=[[Annual Review of Energy and the Environment]] |date=1997|volume=22|pages=403–496|doi=10.1146/annurev.energy.22.1.403|url=http://belfercenter.hks.harvard.edu/files/mmup.pdf |accessdate=March 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; though in simple designs it may produce only a [[Fizzle (nuclear test)|fizzle]] yield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nci.org/NEW/NT/rgpu-mark-90.pdf |title=Reactor Grade Plutonium's Explosive Properties |author=[[J.

The plutonium used was provided to the United States under the [[1958 US-UK Mutual Defence Agreement]]. Its isotopic composition has not been disclosed, other than the description ''reactor grade'' and it has not been disclosed which definition was used in describing the material this way.&lt;ref name=DOE-199406&gt;{{cite web|url=http://permanent.access.gpo.gov/websites/osti.gov/www.osti.gov/html/osti/opennet/document/press/pc29.html|title=Additional Information Concerning Underground Nuclear Weapon Test of Reactor-Grade Plutonium|publisher=[[US Department of Energy]]|date=June 1994|accessdate=March 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plutonium was apparently sourced from the military Magnox reactors at Calder Hall or Chapelcross. The content of Pu-239 in material used for the 1962 test was not disclosed, but has been inferred to have been at least 85%, much higher than typical spent fuel from currently operating reactors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf15.html|title=Plutonium|publisher=World Nuclear Association|date=March 2009|accessdate=February 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally, low-burnup spent fuel has been produced by a commercial LWR when an incident such as a fuel cladding failure has required early refuelling. If the period of irradiation has been sufficiently short, this spent fuel could be reprocessed to produce weapons grade plutonium.
