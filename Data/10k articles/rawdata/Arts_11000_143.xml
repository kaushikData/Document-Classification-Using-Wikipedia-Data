'''Ally Acker''' (born August 17, 1954, New York) is an American filmmaker, poet, author, and film ''herstorian''. Her book, ''Reel Women: Pioneers of the Cinema'', originally published in 1990, was the first on the market to reveal the entrepreneurial, and transformative roles that women played in all aspects of the film industry since its inception. Reel Women was optioned in 1995 for one of the first interactive CD-ROMs ever released, ''Reel Women: The Untold Story''.

==Education and early career==
At age seventeen, Ally Acker became the first woman to obtain a First Class Radiotelephone Operator license through the [[FCC]], enabling the operation of radio transmitters. [[WOR (AM)|WOR]] AM radio in New York hired her at age eighteen to become their first female engineer. At WOR, Acker worked closely with radio legends [[Jean Shepherd]], [[Joe Franklin]], and [[Arlene Francis]].

After graduating from [[Northwestern University]] in 1976, Acker made the foray into television as a video editor for [[WRC-TV]], the NBC affiliate station in [[Washington, D.C.]] From 1977 to 1980, Acker also worked as a freelance radio producer for the Feminist Radio Network, where she interviewed [[Alice Walker]], who had just completed her second novel, ''Meridian''. The interview later aired on [[National Public Radio]].

In 1978 Acker directed, produced, shot and edited the 16mm film, ''Silver Apples of the Moon'', which later became a finalist for a Student Academy Award. She moved to New York in 1980 to pursue filmmaking. Her first job in New York was at Valkhan Films where she worked as assistant to film editor [[Sam Pollard]]. A year later, she was hired by [[NBC]] network as a video editor for ''[[The Today Show]]'', and ''[[NBC Nightly News]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://filmdooworld.com/2014/08/14/filmdoo-interview-american-documentary-filmmaker-ally-acker/ FilmDoo UK interview]&lt;/ref&gt; Only a few months after that hire, Acker was recruited by The Today Show as a producer/writer, becoming the first technician to cross over into producing/writing at NBC in New York. Acker’s first network produced stories featured hosts [[Jane Pauley]] and [[Tom Brokaw]].

==1980s–1990s==
In 1985, Acker created The Reel Women Trust Foundation to honor untold stories of remarkable women in all fields who are left out traditional history sources. She began conducting on-camera interviews with the second wave of women film pioneers for The Reel Women Video Archives. Produced from 1985 to 1994, the interviewees include: [[Dede Allen]], [[Margaret Booth]], [[Kevin Brownlow]], [[Martha Coolidge]], [[Roger Corman]], [[Donna Deitch]], Lauren Shuler-Donner, [[Nora Ephron]], [[Douglas Fairbanks Jr.]] [[Jodie Foster]], [[Harriet Frank Jr.]], [[Lillian Gish]], [[Lee Grant]], [[Molly Haskell]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Fay Kanin]], [[Sherry Lansing]], [[Carol Littleton]], [[Rita Moreno]], [[Brianne Murphy]] (with [[Michael Landon]]), Marcia Nasatir, [[Euzhan Palcy]], [[Mala Powers]], [[Charles Rogers (actor)|Buddy Rogers]], [[Susan Seidelman]], [[Fina Torres]], [[Margarethe von Trotta]], and [[Paula Weinstein]]. Acker donated the collection to the Academy Film Archive of the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] where it is housed for the use of film students and researchers under The Reel Women Film Collection.

In 1985, Acker also interview famed Surrealist artist and writer, [[Leonora Carrington]]. The interview was later used in Acker’s film portrait of Carrington’s life and work, ''The Flowering of the Crone: Leonora Carrington, Another Reality'' (2012–2014). The film is the only authorized film portrait of Carrington to be produced in the United States.

In 1987, Acker obtained her Masters of Fine Arts (MFA) in film and poetry from [[Columbia University]]. Her thesis screenplay, The Mathematical Mermaid about the life of [[Sonya Kovalevsky]], was a 1988 finalist for the Nicholl Fellowship in Screenwriting, administered by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]].

From the mid-80’s to the mid-90’s Acker free-lanced as a writer/producer for [[NBC]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[Lifetime Television]], [[National Geographic Channel|National Geographic]], and [[Disney Channel]]. During these years, she also focused on poetry which she began writing at age 13. Her first volume, ''Surviving Desire'', was released by Garden Street Press in 1994. In 1999, Red Hen Press of California released Acker’s second volume, ''Waiting for the Beloved''. In 2010, Red Hen put out Acker’s, ''Some Help From the Dead''. Acker’s poetry has appeared in numerous journals including, ''The Sun'', ''Ploughshares'', ''The American Voice'', ''Southwest Review'', ''South Dakota Review'', ''[[Antioch Review]]'', ''Poetry Salzburg Review'', and ''Poetry Kanto'' among others. She has received The Chester H. Jones Foundation Award for Poetry and The Carl Sandburg Centennial Award.&lt;ref name="redhen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://redhen.org/authors/ally-acker/ |title=Ally Acker &amp;#124; Red Hen Press |publisher=redhen.org|accessdate=2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2000s==
In 2012, Acker vastly updated and expanded her 1990 Reel Women work now used in Universities worldwide, into a two volume series, ''Reel Women: The First Hundred Years, Volume One'' (Foreword by [[Judith Crist]]), and ''Volume Two'' (Foreword by [[Jeanine Basinger]]). Both volumes include an Afterword by [[Marc Wanamaker]]. All photos included in Acker’s Reel Women films and books are from Wanamaker’s famed Bison Archives.

In 2014, culled from the rich interviews gathered for The Reel Women Video Archives, Acker directed, co-wrote, and edited a three part feature film, ''Reel Herstory: The REAL Story of Reel Women'', hosted by [[Jodie Foster]], and produced by [[Sam Pollard]], and [[Robert Dassanowsky]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wellywoodwoman.blogspot.com/2014/08/ally-ackers-reel-herstory-with-jodie.html Wellwood Woman interview]&lt;/ref&gt;

Acker’s writing has appeared in ''[[Ms. Magazine]]'', ''[[Calyx (magazine)|Calyx]]'', ''[[The Lesbian Review of Books]]'' and ''[[Sojourner (publication)|Sojourner]]''. Her work is also anthologized in [[Notable American Women]] by [[Susan Ware]]. She serves on the editorial board of ''Poetry Salzburg Review'', published at the [[University of Salzburg]], [[Austria]]. Acker has traveled as a film ''herstory'' lecturer to universities and film festivals nationwide. She has appeared as a ''herstory'' film scholar on ''The [[Ron Reagan]] Show'', ''[[The Joe Franklin Show]]'', ''E Mysteries and Scandals'' (speaking about film pioneer, [[Dorothy Arzner]]). ''Reel Women'' was also the focus of a three part series on [[National Public Radio]]. In 2015, Acker appeared in ''The Women Who Run Hollywood'', a feature documentary directed by the prolific French filmmakers, [[Clara Kuperberg]] and [[Julia Kuperberg]] of Wichita Films, Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wichitafilms.com/ Witchita Films]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ArtBakery''' is an art centre based in the village of [[Bonendale]] a few kilometers from [[Douala]] and founded by [[Goddy Leye]]. The centre offers trainings for emerging artists (Master Class), journalists (Art Daily) and residency programs for young artists (Portfolio). ArtBakery is specifically designed to technically support the production of multimedia artworks, video and digital art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.powerofculture.nl/uk/specials/rain/artbakery.html ArtBakery] on "The Power of Culture"].&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
ArtBakery is founded in 2002 after the artist [[Goddy Leye]] moves back to [[Cameroon]] from the [[Netherlands]]. The centre is part of the [[Rijksakademie]] International Network (RAIN), a network of artists who support contemporary cultural practices in their countries of origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.r-a-i-n.net|title=R-A-I-N|website=www.r-a-i-n.net|access-date=2017-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; RAIN supports ArtBakery and its first project ''[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Bessengue_City_Douala Bessengue City]''.

== Activities ==
=== Bessengue City ===
''Bessengue City'' is a project designed and coordinated by [[Goddy Leye]] and organised in [[Bessengue]] [[Douala]] in October 2002. The project involved the artists [[James Beckett (artist)|James Beckett]], [[Goddy Leye]], [[Hartanto]], [[Jesus Palomino]] and the local community and it was produced with the support of [[Rijksakademie|Rijksakademie van Beeldende Kunsten]] of [[Amsterdam]] and by the programme R.A.I.N. Rain Artists’ Initiative Network. 
James Beckett produces in the neighbourhood of [[Bessengue]] an experimental radio, with a range of one kilometre and the collaboration of a group of young people which made interviews and recordings. The radio was called ''Radio Bessengue City'', or ''Dikalo la Bessengue'' (the messenger of Bessengue) becomes, as one listener said, “the radio of the people by the people”.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Goddy Leye takes pictures of twenty smiling people from the neighbourhood and makes some digital manipulation. The portraits are printed and arranged in random groups and positioned as posters in the estate. Produced from the same footage, the 6-minute video called ''Bouquet de Sourires'' (Bouquet of Smiles), is shown in the neighbourhood.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Hartanto builds the website of the project and he connects one person from Bessengue with another from [[Bandung]]. The messages, written in French (Bessengue) and Indonesian (Bandung), are scanned and sent with their translation in both directions. News on everyday life and the local environment are exchanged on a daily basis.

=== Exit Tour ===
''Exit Tour - [[Douala]], [[Cotonou]], [[Lomé]], [[Accra]], [[Ouagadougou]], [[Bamako]], [[Dakar]]'' is a collaborative artistic project organised in 2006. In occasion of [[Dak'art 2006]], seven artists ([[Ginette Daleu]], [[Justine Gaga]], [[Dunja Herzog]], [[Lucfosther Diop]], [[Achillekà|Achillekà Komguem]], [[Alioum Moussa]] and [[Goddy Leye]]) departed from Douala and reached Dakar using only public transportation. During the three-months journey, the artists visited galleries, artists and participated to workshops in [[Cotonou]], [[Lomé]], [[Accra]], [[Ouagadougou]], [[Bamako]], [[Dakar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://africanartists.blogspot.com/2011/02/dairy-to-dakart-2006.html|title=Unseen Art Scene: Journey from Douala to Dak'Art 2006|last=Scene|first=Unseen Art|date=2011-02-24|website=Unseen Art Scene|access-date=2017-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Art Club of Philadelphia''', often called the Philadelphia Art Club, was a [[Club (organization)|club]] in [[Philadelphia]], founded on February 7, 1887, to advance the arts.&lt;ref name="charter"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=B_MpAAAAYAAJ&amp;ots=PUtZRPOLVl&amp;dq=Charter%2C%20constitution%20and%20by-laws%20of%20the%20Art%20Club%20of%20Philadelphia%20with%20house%20rules%2C%20report%20of%20the%20Board%20of%20Directors%20and%20list%20of%20members&amp;pg=PA12#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Charter, constitution and by-laws of the Art Club of Philadelphia with house rules, report of the Board of Directors and list of members], 1898&lt;/ref&gt; It took on the same spirit as the [[Century Association|Century Club]] of [[New York City]]: a comfortable, even opulent, place for member artists and art amateurs to work, stay, and socialize.

Its charter proclaimed:
{{quote|The objects of the Club shall be to advance the knowledge and love of the Fine Arts, through the exhibition of works of Art, the acquisition of books and papers for the purpose of forming an Art library, lectures upon subjects pertaining to Art, receptions given to men or women distinguished in Art, Literature, Science or Politics, and by other kindred means, and to promote social intercourse among its members.&lt;ref name="charter" /&gt;}}

The Art Club was one of the country's leading venues for solo and group art shows. Each year, the club presented a gold medal to the artist of an outstanding work, an art award that was viewed as one of the nation's most prestigious.

The club dissolved on November 9, 1940.&lt;ref name="finkel"&gt;{{cite book |title= Philadelphia then and now: 60 sites photographed in the past and present|last=Finkel |first=Kenneth |authorlink= |author2= Susan Oyama|year= 1988|publisher= Courier Dover Publications|location= |isbn= 9780486257907|page= 39|pages= |url= https://books.google.com/?id=rJ_yWSOI4iEC&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;dq=dissolved%20philadelphia%20%22art%20club%22&amp;pg=PA39#v=onepage&amp;q=dissolved%20philadelphia%20%22art%20club%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=2010-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The worldwide enthusiasm for '''[[Biennale|art biennials]]''', triennials and other –ennial events rose during the 1990s and is continuing whereas this kind of [[exhibition]] format is not a new trend. Indeed, the [[Venice Biennale]] was founded in 1895, followed in 1896 by [[Carnegie International]], the [[Bienal de São Paulo]] in 1951, Kassel’s [[Documenta]] in 1955 and the [[Biennale of Sydney]] in 1973, just to name the firsts, mostly driven by capitalist-philanthropic spirit.

This enthusiasm, which almost no country is exempted from (Dominique Malaquais points out that biennials are the new stadiums countries need to have in order to gain respect on the international arena),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malaquais|first=Dominique|date=2008|year=|title=Douala en habit de festival|url=|journal=Africultures|volume=73|pages=84|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the result of the correlation of three factors in the post-[[Cold War]] context that, accordingly to Bruce Ferguson, Reesa Greenberg and Sandy Nairne, can be identified as the worldwide development of the [[art]] market, the promotion of the arts as a support of cultural and [[national identity]] and the idea that art, seen as a universal [[language]], is an instrument of exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ferguson|first=Bruce|last2=Greenberg|first2=Reesa|last3=Nairne|first3=Sandy|date=1997|title=Mapping International Exhibitions|url=|journal=Art &amp; Design|volume=52|pages=31|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Art biennials are also often the best idea for international exposure when a [[Constituent state|State]] cannot afford a national [[art museum]] and support local artists as Charlotte Bydler underlined it.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Charlotte Bydler, The Global Artworld Inc. On the Globalization of Contemporary Art (Uppsala: Acta Universatis Upsaliensis, 2004), 157.|last=Bydler|first=Charlotte|publisher=Acta Universatis Upsaliensis|year=2004|isbn=|location=Uppsala|pages=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each biennial has its own specificity and history. There is not one model as such, but one common point is that art biennials are first and foremost [[Politics|political]] events. They are often the cultural response to a national will to favor cultural [[tourism]], to solve a social or identity issue, to legitimize an economic boom or to encourage a process of urban innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vincent|first=Cédric|date=2008|title=Ils construisent pour le futur…|url=|journal=Africultures|volume=73|pages=15|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biennials are also tremendous observatories of globalization processes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Étirer la communauté artistique au monde: une sociologie de la mondialisation artistique. Enquêtes sur les controverses autour de ‘l’art contemporain africain’|last=Gilsoul|first=Sarah|publisher=Université Libre de Bruxelles (PhD diss.)|year=2014|isbn=|location=Bruxelles|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By promoting a certain locality and at the same time benefitting from global interests, they favor the globalization paradox, which often creates great tensions on a local level.

Biennials from the so-called ‘peripheral’ countries aspire to become other potential centers and to decentralize what was concentrated upon a Euro-American axis until the end of the Cold War.&lt;ref&gt;The opposition center/periphery leans on the colonial ideology when imperial Europe was defined as the center, and when everything that was external to this center became by definition peripheral. The Bienal de la Habana (founded in 1984) was one of the first art biennials created to stand up against the mainstream; in 1993 and the 2003 Prague Biennale was significantly entitled “Peripheries become the center”, underlining a shift of mainstream artistic authority and monopole.&lt;/ref&gt; The African continent is no exception and countries started to organize art biennials (besides [[Pan-Africanism|pan-African]] festivals which are not included in this account) since the 1950s. Nonetheless, the 1990s, a moment of geopolitical shifts both inside (e.g. the demise of [[apartheid]] in [[South Africa]]) and outside (e.g. the fall of the [[Iron Curtain]] in [[Europe]]) the continent, leading to political reorganization, the change of cultural politics and economics as well as urban renewal, were really the decade when art biennials started to be seen as the best ‘invention’&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Biennial Reader|last=Konaté|first=Yacouba|publisher=Hatje Cantz Verlag|year=2009|isbn=|editor-last=Filipovic|editor-first=Elena|location=Ostfildern|publication-date=2010|page=106|pages=|chapter=The Invention of the Dakar Biennial|editor-last2=Van Hal|editor-first2=Marieke|editor-last3=Øvstebø|editor-first3=Solveig}}&lt;/ref&gt; o promote local art and reach a global audience.

== History ==
[[Egypt]] was the first country on the [[Africa|African continent]] to use the art biennial format as a political tool for national promotion, long before art biennials became a trend in the 1990s and dawned all over the continent, especially since the beginning of the 21st century. The Alexandria Biennale for Mediterranean Countries was founded in 1955 and celebrated its 26th edition in 2016, as for the Cairo International Biennale, it was created in 1984 and organized its last edition in 2012. Initially devoted to Arab contemporary art, Cairo opened up to the international scene from its 1986’s edition. But while Egypt was a precursor, its biennials are less known abroad than other ones held on the continent. This situation can be explained by the provincial focus (despite the international openness of the Cairo biennial) and classical style of the two events (built on the Venice model of national pavilions), combined to the fact that they are state-run events, locked in a national paradigm and with barely any communication tools (neither of them has an official website).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Africa Remix, l’art contemporain d’un continent (cat. ex.)|last=Boutoux|first=Thomas|last2=Vincent|first2=Cédric|publisher=Éditions du Centre Pompidou|year=2005|isbn=|editor-last=Njami|editor-first=Simon|location=Paris|publication-place=|pages=254|chapter=Africa Remix’ Sampler|editor-last2=Bernadac|editor-first2=Marie-Laure}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, in November 2015, [[Something Else OFF Biennale Cairo]], an artist-run initiative, came into being in order to promote the Egyptian contemporary art scene that is mostly excluded from the Alexandria and Cairo events. The very name of this independent biennial says clearly that its aim is to take a step back from the establishment and give an alternative view of the Egyptian creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.somethingelse-off.com/|title=See Simon Njami’s statement|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|text=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One common preconception on African art biennials is to situate the [[Dakar Biennale]] or Dak’art as the first sub-Saharan art biennial whereas it was preceded by the [[Biennale d’art bantou contemporain]] (or Biennial of Contemporary Bantu Art), founded in 1985. The latter is less covered abroad than DAK’ART, and it lasted for only seven editions (the last one being in 2002).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Art sous influences. Une approche anthropologique de la créativité contemporaine au Congo-Brazzaville|last=Greani|first=Nora|publisher=EHESS (PhD diss)|year=2013|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The originality of the project is its creation as part of a more ambitious cultural project initiated by Gabonese President Omar Bongo in 1982: the CICIBA (International Centre of Bantu Civilizations), an intergovernmental&lt;ref&gt;The creation of CICIBA was ratified by ten States: Angola, Comoros, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, Central African Republic, Popular Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Sao Tomé and Principe, Zaire, and Zambia.

Cameroon joined the project in 1995&lt;/ref&gt; project which aimed at preserving and promoting [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] cultures, seen by the organizers as sharing a homogeneous cultural base whereas they were at that time estimated to represent more than 150 million people dispersed among more than twenty countries. Therefore, the biennial was conceived as an itinerant event. The countries alternated in hosting each edition but each edition also travelled, giving thus a broader visibility to the artists. But this focus on the Bantu roots, leading to a selection exclusively centered on artists creating and living on what was defined by the organizers as the Bantu ‘territory’ as well as favoring painting and sculpture over new media, is probably one of the reasons why the event did not reach an international audience and remained a regional biennial.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The [[Dakar Biennale]] (or DAK’ART) is undoubtedly the most famous of all African based biennials.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It was founded in 1990, as the legacy of the Pan-African Festival mondial des arts nègres, which died out in the 1980s before being resuscitated in Dakar in 2010.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-10-03|title=Festival mondial des arts nègres|url=https://fr.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Festival_mondial_des_arts_n%C3%A8gres&amp;oldid=130281170|journal=Wikipédia|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Celebrating the heritage of [[Léopold Sedar Senghor]]’s cultural politics, DAK’ART was initially conceived as a cultural event alternating every two years between poetry/literature and contemporary art. However, the 1990 edition would remain the only one devoted to literature. At its first occurrence in 1992, the art event had an international scope but it was refocused on the African continent from its next edition in 1994. One of the particularities of DAK’ART is its “off” event that spreads out from the official Biennale venues into various locations in the city. Even if the off was founded by the biennale’s administration and not by an external association, it is considered by many as the core of the biennial, giving an extra-space of visibility to the dynamism and richness of African artistic creation, and particularly to promote the Senegalese artists who are not selected in the official exhibitions.[[#sdfootnote8sym|&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;]] Indeed, the selection process is an open call, which has been criticized by many artists who wish a more curated event, because in their view the open call is not democratic as it claims to be, but favors those who have access to relevant information and the means to set up an application file.[[#sdfootnote9sym|&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;]] Each edition is different from the previous one, each learning from the criticism that was made through evaluation seminars. For example, since 2006, an artistic director is appointed and collaborates with a group of curators to select the artists.

==Biennale de Bamako==
The [[African Photography Encounters|Rencontres de la photographie africaine]] or '''Biennale de Bamako''', also known as the '''[[Bamako]] Encounters''', is also one of the oldest art biennials on the continent (founded in 1993). It is still active today and has acquired an international reputation across and outside the continent.[[#sdfootnote10sym|&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;]] Its specificity is its focus on photography and video in Africa. Unlike the events aforementioned, the Biennale de Bamako has been driven and organized from its beginnings by the French cultural exchange agency Institut français (formerly AFAA, cultural branch of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs), in cooperation with the Ministry of Culture in Mali. Therefore, curator Simon Njami qualifies the Biennale de Bamako as a “transplanted” event, which required work on a local scale to legitimize the biennial that could first be seen as a neocolonial event serving foreign purposes.[[#sdfootnote11sym|&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;]] It certainly succeeded to gain a local as well as an international renown because it boosted the creation of photography based festivals such as the '''PhotoFesta Maputo''' (2002)[[#sdfootnote12sym|&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;]], the '''Gwanza Month of Photography''' (2009)[[#sdfootnote13sym|&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;]], or the '''LagosPhoto Festival''' (2010)[[#sdfootnote14sym|&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;]] just to name a few.

==Johannesburg Biennale==
Founded to celebrate the end of [[Apartheid]] and the reopening of the country to the world after decades of [[boycott]], the '''Johannesburg Biennale''', despite its short life (only two editions in 1995 and 1997), is one of the best examples of the fundamental tension into which biennials are caught: to settle into the local and to gain renown on an international level. If for curator [[Hans Ulrich Obrist]] the 1997 [[Johannesburg]] Biennale was as important as the [[Venice]] Biennial or ''documenta X'' held the same year, and was amongst the most influential exhibitions of the 1990s,[[#sdfootnote15sym|&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;]] the local reception of the event was in general radically different. Its absence of engagement with the South African communities and the conceptual and elitist character of the exhibited artworks were harshly criticized in the local press. The biennial was thus seen as a grafted event, serving political interests rather than social and cultural ones, and favoring an international art discourse over a local one. In the case of the Johannesburg Biennale this criticism was one of the pretexts of the Greater Johannesburg City Council to withdraw its support and shut down the event prematurely. Even though the reasons for its cancellation are still not fully elucidated, the Johannesburg Biennale remains nonetheless a mythical biennial because, after decades of isolation due to international boycott, it shed light on the South African art scene and helped many South Africans artists to access the international arena where they are occupying a significant place nowadays.[[#sdfootnote16sym|&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;]]

==Additional biennials==
Since the beginning of the 21st century, at least seventeen art biennials popped up on the African continent (see end list). &lt;sup&gt;[[#sdfootnote17sym|17]]&lt;/sup&gt; The great difference with the 20th century is that almost all of these biennials are independent initiatives led by artists and non-profit organizations, i.e. East Africa Art Biennale, Salon Urbain de Douala, AFiRIperFOMA Biennial, Kampala Art Biennale or Rencontres Picha/Biennale de Lubumbashi. Some areas stand out as active artistic centers like Douala (Biennale de Douala DUTA, Salon Urbain de Douala), Morocco (with Casablanca and Marrakech Biennales), Congo (Biennale de Lubumbashi, Yango Biennale) or the city of Kampala (KLA ART, Kampala Art Biennale). Even if some of these biennials are irregularly organized or even abandoned, they are nonetheless symptoms of a cultural effervescence and a will to promote and encourage local artists, be it on a regional level or on a more international one.

The creation of a biennial not only proceeds from a political motivation, but it also depends on the capacity of the city to host the public. The existence of communication, transport and accommodation infrastructures is necessary and their absence thus requires a consequent budget to build and/or renovate them, which can be a problem for a city/country that does not have the resources to do so. To be accepted at a local level, that is to say, to have the support of the city council or the State, is a ''sine qua non'' condition to ensure longevity and financial stability to the biennial. For example, the disengagement of the Greater Johannesburg City Council in the Johannesburg biennale’s project marked the end of the event. Nonetheless, it does not prevent independent, non-governmental, biennials to exist too. Only the future will tell if private investors will sustain such events on a regular basis for as long as the city of Venice or the State of Senegal have done so far. One aspect also very important to keep in mind is the fact that biennials are just events, even when they are institutionalized like DAK’ART or the Biennale de Bamako. Therefore, they must be seen as steps towards the establishment of sustainable structures to support and promote local artists on a daily basis.

The opening to the international art arena brought by a biennale is an essential dimension, which pertains then to the location’s inscription (be it a city or a country) on the map both of the art world and of financial investors, attracted by the tourism engendered by the event. To legitimize an art biennial at the international level requires most of the time the invitation of an international curator as artistic director. For example, the Benin Biennial, which was initially conceived in 2010 as a local event to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the independence of the country, appointed a renowned curator, Abdellah Karroum, for the next edition (2012) in order to change its status of a local event into an international one. The organizers of the Marrakech Biennale also knew it well when they appended the “biennial” label on what was at first a local event (The Arts in Marrakech Festival) in order to reach a wider audience without losing the local one, notably by keeping the use of three languages (Arabic, French and English).

Art biennials in Africa are important exponents of the increasing internationalization of contemporary African artists.[[#sdfootnote18sym|&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;]] But one of the pitfalls of this kind of event is the risk of becoming an exotic storefront for Western art critics and curators.[[#sdfootnote19sym|&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;]] Therefore, a real curatorial work has to be done to escape the submission to Western diktat. At the same time, by changing the traditional trajectories of the art world, those biennials force Western institutions to renew themselves, for example by appointing Okwui Enwezor to ''Documenta11'' (2001-2002) or, more recently, to the 56th Venice Biennale's (2015) artistic direction. Enwezor is the first and, so far the only, African and Black person to have directed Documenta or the Venice Biennale.

'''Bad girl art''' is the name for the [[superhero]]ine art trend that emerged during the 1990s.

==History==
{{Expand section|1=a mention of the decline of the trend during the late 1990s and early 2000s &amp; more examples of '''notable''' bad girl characters|date=December 2015|small=no}}
The term "bad girl art" was coined in the 1990s as an allusion – and contrast – to the "[[good girl art]]" movement that started in the 1940s, and is used to refer to the trend of [[femme fatale]] heroines that started in 1993.&lt;ref name="Conroy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conroy|first1=Mike|title=500 Great Comic Book Action Heroes|date=2004|publisher=Collins &amp; Brown|location=London|isbn=9781844110049|pages=198-199}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gabilliet"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gabilliet|first1=Jean-Paul|last2=Beaty|first2=Bart|last3=Nguyen|first3=Nick|title=Of Comics and Men: A Cultural History of American Comic Books|date=2010|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|location=Jackson|isbn=9781604732672|pages=102-103|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "bad girl" art trend was derived from the exaggerated visual styles of the male and female form first used in the late 80s by artists such as [[Rob Liefeld]] and [[Jim Lee]]. The precursors to the trend were ''[[Vampirella]]'', created by publisher James Warren in 1969, and [[Marvel Comics]]' ''[[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]]'', created by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] in 1981.&lt;ref name="Conroy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gabilliet"/&gt;

Notable "bad girl" characters in the 1990s include the [[Harris Publications#Harris Comics|Harris Comics]] revival of ''Vampirella''; ''[[Lady Death]]'', created by writer [[Brian Pulido]] and artist [[Steven Hughes]] in 1992; ''[[Razor (character)|Razor]]'', created by Everett Hartsoe in 1992; ''[[Shi (comics)|Shi]]'', created by [[William Tucci|Billy Tucci]] in 1993; ''[[Angela (comics)|Angela]]'', created by [[Neil Gaiman]] in 1993; ''[[Glory (comics)|Glory]]'' and ''[[Avengelyne]]'', created by [[Rob Liefeld]] in 1993 and 1995 respectively, and ''[[Witchblade]]'', created by [[Marc Silvestri]] in 1995.&lt;ref name="Conroy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gabilliet"/&gt;

"Bad girl" characters dress in revealing costumes, possess shapely physiques, are morally ambiguous, wield supernatural powers or are of a supernatural nature, and have no compunction about killing their enemies.&lt;ref name="Conroy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gabilliet"/&gt;

The '''''Carabinieri Command for the Protection of Cultural Heritage''''', better known as the '''Carabinieri T.P.C.''', is the branch of the Italian Carabinieri responsible for combatting art and antiquities crimes.&lt;ref name="Introduzione"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00sm8tn |title=The Carabinieri Art Quad |publisher=BBC |accessdate=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''Il Nucleo Tutela Patrimonio Artistico'' was founded by General Arnaldo Ferrara on 3 May 1969. It was the first specialist police force in the world in this sector, predating the [[UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property]] of 1970. On 5 March 1992 the force was renamed ''Comando Carabinieri per la Tutela del Patrimonio Culturale''.&lt;ref name="Introduzione"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carabinieri.it/Internet/Cittadino/Informazioni/Tutela/Patrimonio+Culturale/default.htm |title=Comando Carabinieri Tutela Patrimonio Culturale - Introduzione |publisher=[[Ministry of Defence (Italy)|Ministero della Difesa]] |accessdate=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
The force has four sections: archaeology, antique dealing, fakes, and contemporary art. It is led by a colonel and headquartered in Rome, with twelve regional offices. It functions in coordination with the ''[[Ministero per i Beni e le Attività Culturali]]''.&lt;ref name="Introduzione"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Articolazione"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carabinieri.it/Internet/Cittadino/Informazioni/Tutela/Patrimonio+Culturale/02_TPC.htm |title=Comando Carabinieri Tutela Patrimonio Culturale - Articolazione |publisher=[[Ministry of Defence (Italy)|Ministero della Difesa]] |accessdate=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
The force investigates clandestine excavations, the theft and illicit trade in works of art, damage to monuments and archaeological zones, the illegal export of cultural property, and fakes. It is involved in the monitoring and control of archaeological sites, and the activities of art and antique dealers, junk shops, and restorers. The force is also involved in forensic analysis; the development and promotion of educational materials; advising overseas ministries, police forces and customs bodies; international peacekeeping missions; and the protection and recovery of cultural property in disaster zones.&lt;ref name="Compiti"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carabinieri.it/Internet/Cittadino/Informazioni/Tutela/Patrimonio+Culturale/03_TPC.htm |title=Comando Carabinieri Tutela Patrimonio Culturale - Compiti |publisher=[[Ministry of Defence (Italy)|Ministero della Difesa]] |accessdate=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partners==
The force works internationally with organisations including [[UNESCO]], [[UNIDROIT]], [[ICOMOS]], [[International Council of Museums|ICOM]], and [[INTERPOL]]. Domestically it works in partnership with a number of universities, cultural foundations, and research centres, including [[ICCROM]], as well as the local ''[[Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities (Italy)#Organisation|soprintendenze]]'' and ecclesiastical bodies.&lt;ref name="Compiti"/&gt;

==Publications and Media==
The force maintains a database of stolen works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tpcweb.carabinieri.it/tpc_sito_pub/simplecerca.jsp |title=Comando Carabinieri Tutela Patrimonio Culturale - Banche Dati |publisher=[[Ministry of Defence (Italy)|Ministero della Difesa]] |accessdate=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 1 March 2011, some 5,290 missing items were listed as having particular economic or cultural value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tpcweb.carabinieri.it/tpc_sito_pub/result.jsp |title=Comando Carabinieri Tutela Patrimonio Culturale - Opere di particular rilevanza |publisher=[[Ministry of Defence (Italy)|Ministero della Difesa]] |accessdate=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also publishes a Bulletin of Trafficked Art Works, 2010 seeing the 32nd annual issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tpcweb.carabinieri.it/tpc_sito_pub/bollettini.jsp |title=Comando Carabinieri Tutela Patrimonio Culturale - Bolletini |publisher=[[Ministry of Defence (Italy)|Ministero della Difesa]] |accessdate=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
In 2009 some 39,584 looted antiquities and 19,043 other works were recovered, valued at €165 million. In 2008 works valued at €183 million were recovered. Improved international collaboration, site security, and databases saw a drop of 14.5% in stolen Italian works between the two years, while the number of illegal archaeological excavations discovered fell from 238 in 2008 to 58 in 2009.&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.artdaily.org/index.asp?int_sec=11&amp;int_new=35634 |title=Italian Authorities Recover Euro165 Million in Stolen Art, Relics |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 137 items relating to the [[Giacomo Medici (art dealer)|Medici case]] were returned from Switzerland, recovered from the Zurich-based restorers Fritz Burki &amp; Son, who had worked on the [[Euphronios krater]].

The '''cut-up technique''' (or ''découpé'' in French) is an [[aleatory]] [[literary technique]] in which a written text is cut up and rearranged to create a new text. The concept can be traced to at least the [[Dada]]ists of the 1920s, but was popularized in the late 1950s and early 1960s by writer [[William S. Burroughs]], and has since been used in a wide variety of contexts.

==Technique==
The cut-up and the closely associated fold-in are the two main techniques:

*''Cut-up'' is performed by taking a finished and fully linear text and cutting it in pieces with a few or single words on each piece. The resulting pieces are then rearranged into a new text, such as in poems by [[Tristan Tzara]] as described in his short text, ''TO MAKE A DADAIST POEM''.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1920"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.391.org/manifestos/19201212tristantzara_dmonflabl.htm |title=manifestos: dada manifesto on feeble love and bitter love by tristan tzara, 12th december 1920 |publisher=391 |date=12 December 1920 |accessdate=2011-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Fold-in'' is the technique of taking two sheets of linear text (with the same linespacing), folding each sheet in half vertically and combining with the other, then reading across the resulting page, such as in ''[[The Third Mind]]''. It is [[William S. Burroughs|Burroughs]] and [[Brion Gysin|Gysin]]'s joint development.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Caruso. William Burroughs, the infinite groundbreaker. Buenos Aires Herald. buenosairesherald.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

William Burroughs cited [[T. S. Eliot]]'s poem, ''[[The Waste Land]]'' (1922) and [[John Dos Passos]]' [[U.S.A. trilogy|''U.S.A.'' trilogy]], which incorporated newspaper clippings, as early examples of the cut ups he popularized.

[[Gil J. Wolman]] developed cut-up techniques as part of his [[lettrism|lettrist]] practice in the early 1950s.

Also in the 1950s, painter and writer [[Brion Gysin]] more fully developed the cut-up method after accidentally re-discovering it. He had placed layers of newspapers as a mat to protect a tabletop from being scratched while he cut papers with a [[razor blade]]. Upon cutting through the newspapers, Gysin noticed that the sliced layers offered interesting juxtapositions of text and image. He began deliberately cutting newspaper articles into sections, which he randomly rearranged. The book ''Minutes to Go'' resulted from his initial cut-up experiment: unedited and unchanged cut-ups which emerged as coherent and meaningful prose. South African poet [[Sinclair Beiles]] also used this technique and co-authored ''Minutes To Go''.

Gysin introduced Burroughs to the technique at the [[Beat Hotel]]. The pair later applied the technique to printed media and [[audio recording]]s in an effort to decode the material's implicit content, [[Hypothesis|hypothesizing]] that such a technique could be used to discover the true meaning of a given text.  Burroughs also suggested cut-ups may be effective as a form of [[divination]] saying, "When you cut into the present the future leaks out."&lt;ref&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r541727|pure_url=yes}} Break Through in Grey Room]&lt;/ref&gt; Burroughs also further developed the "fold-in" technique. In 1977, Burroughs and Gysin published ''[[The Third Mind]]'', a collection of cut-up writings and essays on the form. Jeff Nuttall's publication ''[[My Own Mag]]'' was another important outlet for the then-radical technique.

In an interview, [[Alan Burns (author)|Alan Burns]] noted that for ''Europe After The Rain'' (1965) and subsequent novels he used a version of cut-ups: "I did not actually use scissors, but I folded pages, read across columns, and so on, discovering for myself many of the techniques Burroughs and Gysin describe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dalkeyarchive.com/book/?fa=customcontent&amp;GCOI=15647100621780&amp;extrasfile=A09F77F7-B0D0-B086-B615C61B62D698F2.html |author=David W. Madden |title=A Conversation with Alan Burns |accessdate=2013-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Argentine writer [[Julio Cortázar]] often used cut ups in his 1963 novel ''[[Hopscotch (Julio Cortázar novel)|Hopscotch]]''.

==History in literature==

In 1969, poets [[Howard W. Bergerson]] and [[J. A. Lindon]] developed a cut-up technique known as [[vocabularyclept poetry]], in which a poem is formed by taking all the words of an existing poem and rearranging them, often preserving the metre and stanza lengths.&lt;ref name="rogers"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rogers |first=Ben |authorlink=Howard Bergerson |date=February 1969 |title=Some Neglected Ways of Words |url=http://digitalcommons.butler.edu/wordways/vol2/iss1/4/ |journal=[[Word Ways: The Journal of Recreational Linguistics]] |publisher=[[Greenwood Periodicals]] |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=14–19 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- "Ben Rogers" is an anagrammatic pseudonym of "Bergerson" --&gt;&lt;ref name="lindon1"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lindon |first=J. A. |authorlink=J. A. Lindon |date=May 1969 |title=The Vocabularyclept Poem, № 1 |url=http://digitalcommons.butler.edu/wordways/vol2/iss2/8/ |journal=[[Word Ways: The Journal of Recreational Linguistics]] |publisher=[[Greenwood Periodicals]] |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=85–89 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bishop"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bishop |first1=Yvonne M.|author1-link= Yvonne Bishop |last2=Fienberg |first2=Stephen E. |last3=Holland |first3=Paul W. |date=2007 |title=Discrete Multivariate Analysis: Theory and Applications |url= |location= |publisher=Springer |pages=340–342 |isbn=978-0-387-72805-6 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A precedent of the technique occurred during a Dadaist rally in the 1920s in which [[Tristan Tzara]] offered to create a poem on the spot by pulling words at [[random]] from a hat. [[Collage]], which was popularized roughly contemporaneously with the Surrealist movement, sometimes incorporated texts such as newspapers or brochures. Prior to this event, the technique had been published in an issue of 391 in the poem by Tzara, ''dada manifesto on feeble love and bitter love'' under the sub-title, ''TO MAKE A DADAIST POEM''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.in-vacua.com/tzara.shtml|title=Tzara Combinations|author=|date=|website=www.in-vacua.com|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1920"/&gt;

A drama scripted for five voices by performance poet [[Hedwig Gorski]] in 1977 originated the idea of creating poetry only for performance instead of for print publication. The "neo-verse drama" titled ''Booby, Mama!'' written for "guerilla theater" performances in public places used a combination of newspaper cut-ups that were edited and choreographed for a troupe of non-professional street actors.&lt;ref&gt;Intoxication: Heathcliff on Powell Street, Slough Press, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0615271033}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Booby Mama! Cut-Up Spoken Word, 1977 https://www.amazon.com/Booby-Mama-Surreal-Cut-Up-Spoken/dp/1507829159&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kathy Acker]], a literary and intermedia artist, sampled external sources and reconfigured them into the creation of shifting versions of her own constructed identity. In her late 1970s novel ''[[Blood and Guts in High School]]'', Acker explored literary cut-up and appropriation as an integral part of her method.

==History in film==
[[Antony Balch]] and Burroughs created a collaboration film, ''The Cut-Ups''&lt;ref name="dangerousminds1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dangerousminds.net/comments/william_burroughs_antony_balch_cut_ups|title=A Complete Disorientation of the Senses: William Burroughs’ and Antony Balch’s ‘Cut Ups’|author=|date=16 December 2010|website=dangerousminds.net|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; that opened in London in 1967. This was part of an abandoned project called ''Guerrilla Conditions'' meant as a documentary on Burroughs and filmed throughout 1961–1965. Inspired by Burroughs' and Gysin's technique of cutting up text and rearranging it in random order, Balch had an editor cut his footage for the documentary into little pieces and impose no control over its reassembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brightlightsfilm.com/appraisal-films-william-burroughs-brion-gysin-anthony-balch-terms-recent-avant-garde-theory/|title=An Appraisal of the Films of William Burroughs, Brion Gysin, and Anthony Balch in terms of Recent Avant Garde Theory – Bright Lights Film Journal|author=|date=1 February 2003|website=brightlightsfilm.com|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film opened at [[Oxford Street]]'s Cinephone cinema and had a disturbing reaction. Many audience members claimed the film made them ill, others demanded their money back, while some just stumbled out of the cinema ranting "it's disgusting".&lt;ref name="dangerousminds1"/&gt; Other cut-up films include ''Ghost at n°9 (Paris)'' (1963–72), a posthumously released short film compiled from reels found at Balch's office after his death, and ''William Buys a Parrott'' (1982), ''Bill and Tony'' (1972), ''Towers Open Fire'' (1963) and ''The Junky's Christmas'' (1966).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ubu.com/film/burroughs.html|title=UbuWeb Film &amp; Video –  William S. Burroughs|author=|date=|website=www.ubu.com|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical influence==
From the early 1970s, [[David Bowie]] used cut-ups to create some of his lyrics. [[Thom Yorke]] applied a similar method in [[Radiohead]]'s ''[[Kid A]]'' (2000) album, writing single lines, putting them into a hat, and drawing them out at random while the band rehearsed the songs. Perhaps indicative of Thom Yorke's influences,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Radiohead – Everything in Its Right Place|url = http://radiohead1.tripod.com/songs/album/everything.htm|website = radiohead1.tripod.com|accessdate = 2015-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; instructions for "How to make a Dada poem" appeared on Radiohead's website at this time.

[[Stephen Mallinder]] of [[Cabaret Voltaire (band)|Cabaret Voltaire]] reported to ''[[Inpress]]'' magazine's [[Andrez Bergen]] that "I do think the manipulation of sound in our early days – the physical act of cutting up tapes, creating [[tape loop]]s and all that – has a strong reference to Burroughs and Gysin."&lt;ref&gt;"Vintage Cab Sav," Andrez Bergen. ''[[Inpress]]'', 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul McCartney was a Burroughs acquaintance in London when the White Album was recorded -- See "Revolution No. 9."

The '''Dublin Fringe Festival''' is an annual curated arts festival in [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]]. The festival allows artists to submit their work via an application which is subsequently reviewed by the programme manager.{{fact|date=December 2017}} The festival is open to both Irish and international participants.

The festival started in 1995 and expanded into a sixteen-day festival, annually held in September and focuses on new and emerging artists.{{fact|date=December 2017}} The Dublin Fringe has live entertainment as well as performances in dance, theatre, live art, visual art, and music.

To attract aspiring artists, the fringe runs workshops throughout the festival to teach a variety of skills such as tassel swirling, [[hip hop]], [[T'ai chi ch'uan|t'ai chi]], and others.{{fact|date=December 2017}}

==History==
Originating in 1995, Bedrock Productions, with some support from the established [[Dublin Theatre Festival]] and Arts office of Dublin City Council, created the Dublin Fringe Festival, to "promote and showcase the work of small and vibrant theatre companies and theatre makers".{{fact|date=December 2017}} In the first year, [[Conor McPherson]]'s ''This Lime Tree Bower'' premiered, and in 1996 [[Enda Walsh]]'s ''Disco Pigs'' took off from The International Bar.

Directors who have presented works at the festival have included Jimmy Fay (1995-1996), Ali Curran (1997-2000), Vallejo Gantner (2001 -2005), Wolfgang Hoffmann (2006-2007), Roise Goan (2008-2013),&lt;ref name="roise" /&gt; and Kris Nelson (since 2014).{{fact|date=December 2017}}

Successful works from past Fringe Festivals have included early plays by Conor McPherson, Enda Walsh, Owen McCafferty, Corn Exchange, Loose Canon, Pan Pan Theatre Company, Semper Fi, Anu Productions,{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} and [[Eva O'Connor]].&lt;ref name="RTE 30 December 2016"&gt;{{cite web |last= O'Connor |first= Eva| title= Eva O'Connor on turning mental health experiences into art |url= https://www.rte.ie/culture/2016/1223/840992-first-fortnight-eva-oconnor/| date= 30 December 2016|website= www.rte.ie |publisher= [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann]]| location= Dublin| accessdate=31 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Venues==
Each performance takes place in a venue which is deemed most suitable to the show. This can range from a number of cafes and theatres, as well as less traditional venues such as the Liffey Boardwalk or on a Dublin bus.

For a number of years until 2009, The Spiegeltent was a major part of the festival. This tent was erected in several sites including at [[Georges Dock]]. The Dublin Fringe Festival and Spiegeltent have attracted numerous shows, including the cabaret/variety show [[La Clique]].

== Sponsors ==
Past sponsors include [[Absolut vodka]] who sponsored the events between 2009 and 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drinksindustryireland.ie/article.aspx?id%3D1471 |publisher = drinksindustryireland.ie |title=Absolut’s 2nd Dublin Fringe sponsorship |accessdate=2013-09-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413145538/http://www.drinksindustryireland.ie/article.aspx?id=1471 |archivedate=2014-04-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of a four-year deal.&lt;ref name="roise"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/how-r%C3%B3ise-goan-grew-the-fringe-1.1515922 | quote = ''one condition of a four-year title sponsorship was to sacrifice a portion of its identity (Absolut Fringe)'' | title = How Róise Goan grew the Fringe | publisher = Irish Times | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130905092945/http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/how-r%C3%B3ise-goan-grew-the-fringe-1.1515922 | archivedate = 5 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5114">'''European art cinema''' is a branch of [[Film|cinema]] that was popular in the 1960s.  It is based on a rejection of the tenets and techniques of [[classical Hollywood cinema]].

==History==
European art cinema gained popularity in the 1960s, with notable filmmakers such as [[Federico Fellini]], [[Michelangelo Antonioni]], and [[Ingmar Bergman]]. At this time it was new to the even broader field of [[art film|art cinema]].

==Differences from classical==
The [[continuity editing]] system is not necessarily abandoned but instead is not ''needed''.  The cause and effect driven [[narrative]], as well as the goal-oriented protagonist&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, A. (1985). The Classic Narrative System. The Cinema Book, 212. London: British Film Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; are also not needed.  Instead, we may have the protagonist wander around aimlessly for the whole movie, with nothing of real importance happening to drive him from one activity to the other.

Classical Hollywood cinema has a narrative transitivity, in which there is "a sequence of events in which each unit follows the one preceding it according to a chain of causation; this chain is usually psychological".&lt;ref&gt;Wollen, P. (1982). Godard and Counter-Cinema: Vent d'est, 80.  Semiotic Counter-Strategies: Readings and Writings London: Verso&lt;/ref&gt;   The 'tale over teller' mantra of the classical Hollywood cinema is closely linked to the editing form that classical Hollywood cinema takes, and the rules they impose.  For example, the [[180 degree rule]] is followed since crossing the 180 degree line will cause a disturbance or a jarring effect on the viewer, thus calling attention away from story and to the teller.  Jump cuts are avoided, since they can cause an ellipsis of the spatial or temporal kind.  It is the job of classical Hollywood cinema to get the audience lost and absorbed into the story of the film, so that the film is pleasurable.  In contrast the task of European art cinema is to be ambiguous, utilizing an open-ended (and sometimes [[intertextual]]) plot, causing the audience to ask questions themselves whilst introducing an element of subjectivity.&lt;ref&gt;Wollen, P. (1982). Godard and Counter-Cinema: Vent d'est, 85.  Semiotic Counter-Strategies: Readings and Writings London: Verso&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way they differ in terms of ‘realism’ is that Hollywood classical cinema has characters in full make up all the time, even when just coming out of bed; whereas European art cinema strives for a representation of the 'truth' and may not have characters in costume or make up.&lt;ref&gt;Wollen, P. (1982). Godard and Counter-Cinema: Vent d'est, 89.  Semiotic Counter-Strategies: Readings and Writings London: Verso&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Evangeliary of Averbode''''' is an [[illuminated manuscript]] [[evangeliary]] with typological illustrations.  It was created in the [[Meuse]] Region of [[Belgium]], and is an example of Romanesque [[Mosan art]].

==Description==
The manuscript page size is 27.7 x 19.2&amp;nbsp;cm. It has 173 pages. It is in the collection of the [[University of Liège]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.numeriques.be/index.php?id=6&amp;no_cache=1&amp;tx_portailnumeriques_pi1[view]=item_detail&amp;tx_portailnumeriques_pi1[id]=peps:ELB-ULG-BGPHL-Ms0363|title = Evangéliaire d'Averbode|website = Numeriques.be|accessdate=2016-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
The manuscript was produced between  1150 et 1175.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2063627/BEL_280_004.html |title=Evangéliaire d'Averbode &amp;#124; Unknown - Europeana |website=Europeana.eu |date= |accessdate=2016-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created in a time that the production of luxury evangeliaries decreased because liturgical Gospel readings were increasingly incorporated into [[Missal]]s.  Evangeliaries became increasingly of less importance in the art of Western Europe. This [[evangeliary]] is an exception to this trend.&lt;ref&gt;Don Denny. "Gospel book." Grove Art Online.

The '''''Funeral of St. Jerome'''''   is a painting by the Italian Renaissance painter [[Filippo Lippi]] of [[Jerome|Saint Jerome]]'s funeral. It is housed in the [[Museo dell'Opera del Duomo (Prato)|Museo dell'Opera del Duomo]] next to the [[Cathedral of Prato]], central Italy.

==History==
The large altarpiece was commissioned by the [[provost (religion)|provost]] of [[Prato]],  [[Geminiano Inghirami]], a patron of the arts who also called [[Donatello]] and [[Michelozzo]] to work in the cathedral. The panel is dated 1440, but this has been always considered a false due to the large stylistic  differences with other Lippi's works of the period. It is generally recognized to be from between 1452, when Lippi arrived in Prato (or a few years before), and Inghirami's death in 1460.

It is housed in the cathedral's museum since the 20th century.

==Description==
The work features numerous characters, painted in different attitudes. In the center, lying on a [[catafalque]] with a precious cloth decorated with [[pomegranate]]s, is the body of St. Jerome. He is surrounded by a group of monks, whose faces show their mourning and despair for the saint's death. The pomegranate cloth is also visible in the funerary monument of  Geminiano Inghirami, once in the church of [[San Francesco, Prato|San Francesco]], attributed to  [[Pasquino da Montepulciano]] (1460).

The mourner's faces show that Lippi had studied [[Giotto]]'s work in the [[Bardi Chapel]], as some gestures are very similar, such as that of the monks kissing the saint's feet or the one raising his hands. Also the saint's position is similar to Giotto's, as well as the presence of ancient numismatic, a widespread theme at the time.

In the foreground is Inghirami kneeling, with a crippled youth in front of him who points at Jerome's body (a trick to avoid that the donor's red garments could distract the observer). The crippled figure is inspired by the frescoes by [[Masaccio]] and [[Masolino da Panicale]] in the [[Brancacci Chapel]], which Lippi knew well as he had a been a monk in the convent housing the chapel in his youth.

The upper part of the panel, aside from rocky mountains with three secondary scenes (Adoration of the Child and two episodes of the saint's life), is occupied by angels, perhaps executed by [[Fra' Diamante]] or another collaborator. Among them circles which allude to the Heaven's Circles, the Redeemer (with a book with Alpha and Omega), the Holy Spirit dove and the Jesus opening his arms.

At the bottom is the coat of arms of the  Inghirami family.

'''Ghinnawa'''s (literally "little songs") are short, two line emotional [[lyric poem]]s written by the [[Bedouin]]s of [[Egypt]], in a fashion similar to [[haiku]]s, but similar in content to the American [[blues]].&lt;ref name = "lila"&gt;Veiled Sentiments: Honor and Poetry in a Bedouin Society, by Lila Abu-Lugodh, University of California Press, Berkeley, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Ghinnawas typically talk of deep, personal feelings and are often an outlet for personal emotions which might not be otherwise expressible in Bedouin society. Ghinnawas may also be sung. [[Lila Abu Lughod]] - the [[Arab American]] [[Anthropology|anthropologist]], who studied the [[Awlad Ali]] Bedouins in Northern Egypt in the late 1970s, and collected over 450 ghinnawas, has published the most comprehensive work on ghinnawas to date.&lt;ref name = "lila"/&gt;

Ghinnawa is a form of [[folk poetry]], in the sense that anyone in Awlad Ali society could author a ghinnawa. In a broader context, ghinnawas may be looked upon as non-standard discourse which are a means of coping with social reality, similar to other discourse forms in the Arab world like the [[Hikaya]] [[Folklore|folktale]]s of [[Tunisia]], or the [[Gussa]] [[allegories]] of the Bedouin of the [[Sinai]].&lt;ref&gt;Between segmentation and desegmentation: Sound expressions among the Berbers in the Sous region (Southwestern Morocco), by Horiuchi Masaki, Cultures Sonores d'Afrique (ed. J. Kawada), Tokyo University of Foreign Studies, Tokyo, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
Ghinnawas usually have sad themes - typically being the lament of lost love, unless sung at celebrations like a [[circumcision]] or a wedding. Ghinnawas are sung by women, boys and also on rare occasions by men.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marthablake.com/ghinnawa.html  The Ghinnawa: How Bedouin Women's' Poetry Supplements Social Expression] by Martha Blake&lt;/ref&gt; Ghinnawa [[semantics]] are well-defined only in context, because of their personal nature. Contents of ghinnawas are considered personal, even sensitive to the extent that Lila Abu Lughod was warned "never to reveal any women's poems to men".&lt;ref&gt;Songs from the nomadic heart, Literary Review of Veiled Sentiments: Honor and Poetry in a Bedouin society by Lila Abu-Lughod; by Inea Bushnaq; [[New York Times]], February 15, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social expression==

The Awlad Ali do not have a strong history of public displays of emotion. Modesty or deference and boasting or anger are typically the most commonly expressed public emotion. Most other forms of expression take place through ''ghinnawa''s.&lt;ref name = "lila"/&gt;

==Delivery and structure==

Ghinnawas may be written down, which is often the case for inter-gender communication, but can be spoken as substitute to normal conversation, or sung. The structure of the ghinnawa is very different in written and oral forms.

Structurally, ghinnawas are approximately 15-[[syllable]] [[couplets]]. They can be broken up into 2 [[hemistiche]]s. If the written form be represented as :
&lt;center&gt;
1234&lt;br&gt;
56789
&lt;/center&gt;
the oral form unspools into 16 lines as follows:
&lt;center&gt;
78&lt;br&gt;
78&lt;br&gt;
789&lt;br&gt;
78&lt;br&gt;
6789&lt;br&gt;
78&lt;br&gt;
78&lt;br&gt;
6789&lt;br&gt;
78&lt;br&gt;
78&lt;br&gt;
781&lt;br&gt;
1234&lt;br&gt;
78&lt;br&gt;
78&lt;br&gt;
56&lt;br&gt;
56789
&lt;/center&gt;
Each ghinnawa typically has many variations, and may even be sung with minor variations in a single singing.&lt;ref name = "lila"/&gt;

The '''Grand Theatre''', also known as '''Leeds Grand Theatre''' and '''Leeds Grand Theatre and Opera House''', is a [[theater (building)|theatre]] and [[opera house]] in the centre of [[Leeds]], [[West Yorkshire]], [[England]]. It was designed by James Robinson Watson, chief assistant in the office of Leeds-based architect [[George Corson]], and opened on 18 November 1878. The exterior is in a mixture of [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Scottish baronial style|Scottish baronial]] styles, and the interior has such [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] motifs as [[fan vault|fan-vaulting]] and clustered columns. The theatre is a Grade II* [[listed building]]. It seats approximately 1,500 people.

The theatre is a large scale receiving house and hosts touring productions of West End and Broadway musicals and plays, comedians and music. The theatre is home to [[Opera North]] and is regularly visited by [[Northern Ballet]]. It has hosted many touring productions, musical artists and [[comedian]]s.

For many years it was programmed by [[Howard &amp; Wyndham Ltd]] and staged plays, musicals, pantomime and revues.The theatre closed at the end of May 2005 for a major refurbishment, ''transformation'', and it reopened on 7 October 2006 with a production of [[Verdi]]'s ''[[Rigoletto]]''. The Stalls area was completely re-seated and re-raked, the orchestra-pit enlarged,  technical facilities dramatically improved, and improvements to Opera North  to the south of the theatre, accessible via a bridge and at street-level, which includes two new stage-sized rehearsal spaces and increased office space. The cost of the refurbishment has been estimated at £31.5&amp;nbsp;million.

A second phase of ''transformation'' included  the restoration of the Assembly Rooms, a forgotten area on the first floor of the building that opened in 1879 and functioned as the Plaza Cinema between 1912 and 1978 and then as a rehearsal room for Opera North. With restoration now complete, the theatre has a second performance space, the Howard Assembly Room, which is used for recitals, concerts, [[chamber opera]]s, experimental and educational work and other events for which the main theatre is unsuitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Grand Memories: The Life and Times of the Grand Theatre and Opera House, Leeds | last=Lennon | first=Patricia | first2=David |last2=Joy | isbn=1-905080-20-4 | year=2006 | publisher=Great Northern Books | location =Ilkley}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the "transformation" at the theatre, particularly after a state-of-the-art automated [[fly system|flying system]] was introduced, the theatre has been more able to host larger West End Musicals and plays.

Recent productions at the theatre have included: ''[[The Phantom Of The Opera]]'', ''[[Dirty Dancing]]'', ''[[Shrek The Musical]]'', ''[[Oliver!|Oliver]]'', ''[[We Will Rock You]]'' and ''[[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]]''.

The theatre is managed by Leeds Grand Theater &amp; Opera House Ltd which also manages City Varieties Music Hall and the Hyde Park Picture House.

'''''Hillary: The Movie''''' is a 2008 political [[documentary]] about United States Senator and presidential candidate [[Hillary Clinton]]. It was produced by the [[conservative]] [[non-profit organization]] [[Citizens United (organization)|Citizens United]]. The film was scheduled to be offered as [[video-on-demand]] on [[cable TV]] right before the [[2008 Democratic primary|Democratic primaries]] in January 2008, but would have been classified as "electioneering communication", which was made illegal under the [[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act]], by the [[Federal Election Commission]]. The producers went to [[U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia]] to get a declaration that they could show their movie and promotional ads for it despite BCRA. This case was titled ''[[Citizens United v. FEC|Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission]]'' and its final decision at the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] resulted in a major change in [[Campaign finance in the United States|campaign finance law]].

The documentary interviewed various conservative figures such as [[Dick Morris]] and [[Ann Coulter]] and reviewed various scandals in which Hillary Clinton purportedly participated, such as the [[White House travel office controversy]], [[White House FBI files controversy]], [[Whitewater controversy]], and [[Hillary Rodham cattle futures controversy|cattle futures controversy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Future of Federal Campaign Finance Reform {{!}} Law Library of Congress|url = https://www.loc.gov/law/help/citizens-united.php|website = www.loc.gov|date = 2012-04-30|accessdate = 2015-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The factual finding of the three-judge district court was that there was "no reasonable interpretation [of the movie] other than as an appeal to vote against Senator Clinton", thus making it "electioneering communication".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Memorandum Opinion |work=Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission |publisher=District Court for the District of Columbia |date=2008-01-15 |url=https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2007cv2240-39 |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court did not change that decision, but applied the [[strict scrutiny]] test for the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment of the Constitution]] and said corporations could not be banned from making electioneering communications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fec.gov/law/litigation_CCA_C.shtml#search=hillary%20the%20movie |publisher=Federal Election Commission |title=FEC Litigation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal case==

In December 2007, ''Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission''.was filed at the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.  A special three-judge panel (as specified in BCRA) sided with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) that under the McCain-Feingold [[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act]] ''Hillary: The Movie'' could not be shown on television right before the 2008 Democratic primaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2009/06/29/Hillary-the-Movie-case-to-be-reheard/UPI-19691246288706/ 'Hillary, the Movie' case to be reheard – UPI.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another provision in BCRA specified that constitutional appeals from the District Court must be immediately filed directly with the [[U.S. Supreme Court]]. Citizens United did so on August 18, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[{{SCOTUS URL Docket|08-205}} Docket for 08-205]&lt;/ref&gt; Oral arguments were heard on March 24, 2009;&lt;ref name="Barnes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/14/AR2009031401603_pf.html|title='Hillary: The Movie' to Get Supreme Court Screening|last=Barnes|first=Robert|date=2009-03-15|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=2009-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ross"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,509712,00.html?sPage=fnc/us/supremecourt|title=March 24: Hillary Clinton Film Challenged|last=Ross|first=Lee|date=2009-03-18|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=2009-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Holland"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailynews.com/20090321/now-showing-at-supreme-court-hillary-the-movie|title=Now showing at Supreme Court: 'Hillary: The Movie'|last=Holland|first=Jesse J.|date=2009-03-21|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=2009-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; a decision was expected sometime in the early summer months of 2009.&lt;ref name='NYT 2009-05-08'&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A07E5D8113EF936A15750C0A96F9C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;&amp;scp=4&amp;sq=Citizens%20United%20v.%20Federal%20Election%20Commission%20&amp;st=cse |title=Justices Consider Interplay Between First Amendment and Campaign Finance Laws |accessdate=2009-05-09 |last=Adam |first=Liptak |date=2009-03-25|page=2|work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 the Supreme Court ruled 5–4 that the spending limits in the McCain-Feingold Act were unconstitutional under the First Amendment; that which allowed essentially unlimited independent expenditures by non-profit organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fec.gov/pages/brochures/fecfeca.shtml|title=The FEC and the Federal Campaign Finance Law Brochure|website=www.fec.gov|access-date=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to popular belief, the [[Federal Election Commission|FEC]] still limits corporate campaign contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fec.gov/pages/brochures/fecfeca.shtml|title=The FEC and the Federal Campaign Finance Law Brochure|website=www.fec.gov|access-date=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Sischy was born in [[Johannesburg, South Africa|Johannesburg]] to Ben Sischy, a family doctor who became an expert in [[radiation oncology]], and Claire Sischy, a speech therapist. She had two older brothers, Mark Sischy, a lawyer who lived in [[Scotland]], and David Sischy, a doctor.&lt;ref name=NYTimes-Father-Obit-2000&gt;{{cite news|title=Paid Notice: Deaths – Sischy, Benjamin|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/27/classified/paid-notice-deaths-sischy-benjamin.html|accessdate=25 July 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=27 September 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Highland-RadiationOncology&gt;{{cite web|title=Highland Hospital: Radiation Oncology |url=https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/MediaLibraries/URMCMedia/giving/documents/RadOnc_slipsheet_web.pdf|website=[[Highland Hospital (Rochester, New York)|Highland Hospital]], [[University of Rochester Medical School]]|accessdate=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her family was Jewish; they had Lithuanian ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/media/columns/medialife/3955/ New York Magazine: "Fametown - We always suspected celebrity was a place where all the stars know each other and have dinner together.

In 1961, when Sischy was nine years old, the Sischy family left [[Apartheid Era|Apartheid-era]] South Africa after the [[Sharpeville massacre]] and moved to [[Edinburgh, Scotland|Edinburgh]], Scotland, where Dr. Sischy re-trained as a radiologist. The family had had to leave South Africa because Sischy's mother was in danger of being arrested for her involvement in an activist group, the [[Black Sash]], that non-violently protested [[Apartheid]]. In 1967, the family moved to [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], New York, where Sischy's father became the head of radiation oncology at Highland Hospital.&lt;ref name=Bangla2000-AP-2000&gt;{{cite news|title=South African-born Dr. Benjamin Sischy dies at age 82|url=http://www.bangla2000.com/news/archive/international/10-4-2000/news_detail6.html|accessdate=25 July 2015|work=Bangla2000|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=4 October 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She received an honorary PhD in the humanities from the [[Moore College of Art]] in 1987.&lt;ref name=WWD-Obit-2015 /&gt;

==Career==
After graduating from college, Sischy took a series of odd jobs and entry-level positions in the art world, including at galleries. She became the circulation coordinator at ''Print Collector's Newsletter,'' an art world industry resource, and was quickly promoted to the role of editor, contributing reviews of works she saw in the burgeoning New York City art world. She was hired, and almost immediately fired, by the [[Guggenheim Museum in New York]], where the dress code and atmosphere made her feel untrue to herself.&lt;ref name=Advocate-Feature-1996 /&gt; She then worked at [[Printed Matter, Inc]], a nonprofit book publisher that introduced her to artists like [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Jenny Holzer]], and many up and coming artists.&lt;ref name=NewYork-AfterAndy-1990 /&gt;

===Museum of Modern Art===
In 1978, Sischy interned at [[The Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA) under a [[National Endowment for the Arts]] curation grant, where she focused on curating photography exhibits, one called "In the Twenties: Portraits From the Photography Department", and another on photographer [[Ansel Adams]]. During this time, she was mentored by [[John Szarkowski]]. the Director of the Department of Photography at MoMA.&lt;ref name=NewYork-AfterAndy-1990/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5645">The '''Kiltubbrid Shield''' is an [[Iron Age]] wooden shield from [[Ireland]]. It was discovered during the 19th century in the [[townland]] and parish of [[Kiltubbrid]], [[County Leitrim]], Ireland. It is probably the only perfect article of its description found in Europe,{{sfn|Wilde|1861|pp=492}} and dates from the [[La Tène culture|late Celtic (La Tène)]] period.{{sfn|Ridgeway|1901|pp=478}}

==Description==
The Kiltubbrid shield is a remarkably well-preserved example of an ancient Irish wooden shield. It was discovered {{nobreak|in 1863}}, buried {{convert|3|m|1}} deep in a turf bog, at [[Kiltubbrid]] townland and just north of [[Lough Scur]].{{sfn|Coffey|1913|pp=75}} The shield is a perfect specimen, oval in shape, with a perfect central boss {{convert|7.6|cm|1}} high, and seven slightly raised concentric circles (ribs), plain on the reverse, with a handle, the whole carved out of one piece of wood.{{sfn|Wood-Martin|1895|pp=466}}{{sfn|Drummon|1871|pp=218}}  The original measurements were {{convert|66|cm|1}} in height by {{convert|53|cm|1}} in width, with a thickness of {{convert|1.25|cm|1}}. Unlike ancient classic shields, through which the forearm was passed, the Irish wooden shield, grasped by the cross-piece underneath the umbo (boss), could be projected to full arm's length during battle.{{sfn|Wood-Martin|1895|pp=466}} The wood was probably [[alder]].{{sfn|Wilde|1861|pp=492}}{{sfn|Wood-Martin|1895|pp=466}}

Kiltubrid-Alder-wooden-shield-Ireland.png|2nd illustration
Kiltubrid-Alder-wooden-shield-Ireland2.png|3rd illustration
Kiltubrid Shield Illustration.png|4th illustration
&lt;/gallery&gt;

The shields was probably covered with leather, painted and decorated.{{sfn|Wilde|1861|pp=492}}{{sfn|Wood-Martin|1895|pp=466}} The ribs show an indentation on one side, presenting a remarkable interruption in the symmetry of the ornament.  Shrinkage may have caused the indentation.{{sfn|Wood-Martin|1895|pp=466}} MacAllister wondered if the indentation is a survival of the observation-notch which adorned shield edges in medieval time, or if this interruption of circular ornament reflected a widespread taboo and superstition against closed rings which prevailed at the time.{{sfn|MacAlliaster|1921|=p-171}}

==Etymology==
[[Ruaidhrí Ó Flaithbheartaigh]] stated in Ogygia (1685) that the Irish name for alder was Fearn, because "shields are made of it". The Irish word ' sciath,' i. e. shield, is more recently applied to a shallow wicker basket, of oval shape — sometimes called a skib — ' used for straining potatoes, and which closely resembles in size and form of the Kiltubbrid wooden shield.{{sfn|Coffey|1913|pp=75}}{{sfn|Wilde|1861|pp=490}}

==Purpose==
[[File:Irish Battle Scene Swords, Spears, and Shields.png|thumb|Irish Battle Scene Swords, Spears, and Shields]]
The toughness and density of the alder would, in itself, be a firm defence against the thrusts of swords, if not spears,{{sfn|Wilde|1861|pp=492}} but half-inch thick wooden shields would be useless against Roman javelins.{{sfn|Drummon|1871|pp=218}}

An illustration sculptured on a stone cross at [[Kells, County Meath]] evidently depicts a conflict between different tribes or cultures; one armed with long-handled spears and circular bossed-shields, the opposing warrior shields have no boss, and are armed with short swords, of a kind often found on [[crannog]]s and first adopted with the introduction of iron as a primary material for weapons of warfare.{{sfn|Wood-Martin|1895|pp=467}}

'''''L'architecte textile''''' is a 2017 French [[documentary]] [[feature film|feature]] film &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allocine.fr/societe/fichesociete-2519/ ''[[Saint-André-des-Arts (cinéma)|Saint-André-des-Arts]]''].&lt;/ref&gt; directed by [[Mika'ela Fisher]] about [[sartorial]] [[art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allocine.fr/film/fichefilm_gen_cfilm=253067.html Source : Allociné]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnc.fr/web/fr/rechercher-une-oeuvre/-/visa/145106 ''CNC''] visa d'exploitation&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
An in-depth documentary on the [[architecture]] of [[bespoke tailoring]]. Over the course of hundreds of hours the mistress tailor filmed herself while making a three-piece suit. This film is an open window into this sartorial craft.

==Cast==
*[[Mika'ela Fisher]] herself: maître tailleur ([[Master tailor]])
*[[Renato Bianchi]] of the [[Comédie Française]] himself: maître d'essayage ([[Fitting master]])

==About the film==
Documenting the intimate in [[sartorial]] art:

A mistress tailor films herself in the creative production of a three-piece suit : 
sketch, pattern, fabric, shaping, assembly, fitting, finalization - hundreds of (wo)man-hours, a story, a film... and an allegory.

==Homage as essence==
===Art sartorial===

Art Sartorial is maybe a forgotten or unknown term, but corresponds to the [[art]] of the Master [[Tailor]]. And this film wants to show in detail the knowledge and practice thus of the technique of this art.

===Grand Couture===

A avant-garde documentary that was fallen right in the middle of the [[Fashion Week]], while the press attaches are boosting their crazy fashion designer on social networks and while the fashion bloggers and the hippest people in the world Planet rush at the foot of the catwalk.
L'architecte textile a perfect [[counterpoint]], the precise work of a watchmaker in the space of the textile architect, who with his skillful hands structures and builds the garment that will sublimate the body by drawing clean lines, and, for the beauty of the gesture, sneak by the tip of the needle the pleats flying away at the slightest movement ...

A masterpiece of precision micro mechanics ... the Art of the Grand [[Haute couture|Couture]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://architecte-textile-fashionweekparis.blogspot.fr/ ''L'architecte textile Fashion Week'']&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:L'architecte textile A film by Mika'Ela Fisher.jpg|thumb|L'architecte textile A film by Mika'Ela Fisher]]

==Production==
The original idea was to realize a school film for fashion students &lt;ref&gt;[https://univ-psl.fr/agenda/projection-du-film-larchitecte-textile ''L'architecte textile Program Training''] [[École nationale supérieure des arts décoratifs]]&lt;/ref&gt; so that traditional couture survives and we do not forget the technique of sartorial art, which is disappearing. The first provisional version of the film is 10 hours long. Finally, a 100-minute cinema film has been created to give "non-professionals" the opportunity to experience this exclusive and increasingly rare profession. The film has a very [[avant-garde]] structure because of the type of camera work, the [[sound design]] and the [[editing]] of the film, so the [[film genre]] is difficult to reclassify. A mix of documentary, [[experimental film]], [[feature film]], [[cultural film]] and [[educational film]].

A longer version of at least six hours is currently in [[post-production]], which will be presented in museums and galleries in 2020.

==Psychology of the film==
The film begins and ends with quotations from [[Albert Camus]] [[The Myth of Sisyphus]]

" The struggle itself to the heights is enough to fill the heart of a man. One must imagine Sisyphus happy ".

"  At the far end of this sustained effort measured by space without sky and depthless time, the goal is reached ".
(The Myth of Sisyphus, Albert Camus, Gallimard, 1942)

[[File:David-Coster-Mille-et-Une-Nuit.jpg|thumb|200px|Illustration from Galland's ''Les Mille et Une Nuit, Contes Arabes'', Vol. 2, by [[Pierre Husson]], [[The Hague]], 1714, by Dutch artist [[David Coster]] (1686-1752): [[Shahrazad]] tells her story to [[List of One Thousand and One Nights characters#Shahryār|Shahryār]], while her sister [[Dunyazad]] listens. Note other stories in the smaller panels (e.g., "[[The Ebony Horse]]" and "[[The Fisherman and the Jinn]]").]]

'''''Les mille et une nuits, contes arabes traduits en français''''' ("The Thousand and One Nights, Arab stories translated into French"), published in 12 volumes between 1704 and 1717, was the first European version of ''[[The Thousand and One Nights]]'' tales. The French translation by [[Antoine Galland]] (1646-1715) derived from an Arabic text of the Syrian [[recension]] of the medieval work&lt;ref&gt;''Bibliothèque nationale'' manuscript "Supplement Arab. No. 2523"&lt;/ref&gt; as well as other sources. It included stories that are not found in the original Arabic manuscripts — the so-called "orphan tales" — such as the famous "[[Aladdin]]" and "[[Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves]]", which first appeared in print in Galland's form. Immensely popular at the time of initial publication, and enormously influential later, subsequent volumes were introduced using Galland's name although the stories were written by unknown persons at the behest of a publisher wanting to capitalize on their popularity.

==History==
Galland had come across a manuscript of "[[Sindbad the Sailor|The Tale of Sindbad the Sailor]]" in [[Constantinople]] during the 1690s and in 1701 he published his French translation of it.&lt;ref name=oxford&gt;{{cite book|title=Arabian Nights' Entertainments|year=2009|publisher=Oxford UP|location=Oxford|pages=ix-xxiii|editor=Robert L. Mack|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its success encouraged him to embark on a translation of a 14th-century Syrian manuscript of tales from ''The Thousand and One Nights''. The first two volumes of this work, under the title ''Les mille et une nuit'', appeared in 1704. The twelfth and final volume was published posthumously in 1717.

Galland translated the first part of his work solely from the Syrian manuscript, but in 1709 he was introduced to another source in the form of a [[Ottoman Syria|Syria]]n Christian — a [[Maronite]] scholar and monk from [[Aleppo]] whom he called Youhenna (“Hanna”) Diab. Galland's diary (March 25, 1709) records that he met Hanna through [[Paul Lucas (traveller)|Paul Lucas]], a French traveler who had brought him to Paris. Hanna recounted 14 stories to Galland from memory and Galland chose to include seven of them in his books. (For example, Galland's diary tells that his translation of "Aladdin" was made in the winter of 1709–10. It was included in his volumes IX and X, published in 1710.) This mysterious situation has led some scholars to conclude that Galland invented the "orphan tales"  himself and that subsequent Arabic versions are merely later renderings of his original French.

Galland adapted his translation to the taste of the times. The immediate success the tales enjoyed was partly due to the vogue for [[fairy story|fairy stories]] — in French, ''contes de fees''&lt;ref name=muhawi&gt;{{cite journal|last=Muhawi|first=Ibrahim|title=The "Arabian Nights" and the Question of Authorship|journal=Journal of Arabic Literature|year=2005|volume=36|issue=3|pages=323–337|doi=10.1163/157006405774909899}}&lt;/ref&gt; — which had been started in France in the 1690s by Galland's friend [[Charles Perrault]]. Galland was also eager to conform to the literary canons of the era. He cut many of the erotic passages out along with all of the poetry. This caused [[Sir Richard Burton]] to refer to "Galland's delightful abbreviation and adaptation" which "in no wise represent[s] the eastern original."&lt;ref&gt;Burton, ''[[The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night]]'', v1, Translator's Foreword pp. x&lt;/ref&gt;

Galland’s translation was greeted with immense enthusiasm and was soon further translated into many other European languages:

*English (a "[[Grub Street]]" version of 1706 under the title ''Arabian Nights Entertainments'')
*German (1712)
*Italian (1722)
*Dutch (1732)
*Russian (1763)
*Polish (1768)

These produced a wave of imitations and the widespread 18th century fashion for oriental tales.&lt;ref&gt;This section: [[Robert Graham Irwin|Robert Irwin]], ''The Arabian Nights: A Companion'' (Penguin, 1995), Chapter 1; some details from Garnier-Flammarion introduction&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
In a 1936 essay, [[Jorge Luis Borges]] wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;Another fact is undeniable. The most famous and eloquent encomiums of ''The Thousand and One Nights'' — by [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]], [[Thomas de Quincey]], [[Stendhal]], [[Alfred Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Cardinal Newman|Newman]] — are from readers of Galland's translation. Two hundred years and ten better translations have passed, but the man in Europe or the Americas who thinks of the ''Thousand and One Nights'' thinks, invariably, of this first translation. The Spanish adjective ''milyunanochesco'' [thousand-and-one-nights-esque] ... has nothing to do with the erudite obscenities of [[Sir Richard Burton|Burton]] or [[J. C. Mardrus|Mardrus]], and everything to do with Antoine Galland's bijoux and sorceries.&lt;ref&gt;Borges, Jorge Luis, "The Translators of The Thousand and One Nights" in ''The Total Library: Non-Fiction 1922-1986'', ed. [[Eliot Weinberger]] (Penguin, 1999), pp. 92-93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Stanislavski as Colonel Vershinin in Chekhov's The Three Sisters.jpg|thumb|right|[[Konstantin Stanislavski]] as Vershinin in [[Anton Chekhov]]'s ''[[Three Sisters (play)|Three Sisters]]''.]]
This article offers a chronological '''list of productions directed by Konstantin Stanislavski'''. It does not include theatrical productions in which [[Konstantin Stanislavski|Stanislavski]] only acted.

Until he was thirty three, Stanislavski appeared only as an [[Amateur theatre|amateur]] onstage and as a [[Theatre director|director]], as a result of his family's discouragement.&lt;ref&gt;Benedetti (1999a, 21, 24) and Carnicke (2000, 11). The prospect of becoming a professional actor was [[taboo]] for someone of Stanislavski's [[social class]]; actors had an even lower [[social status]] in Russia than in the rest of Europe, having only recently been [[Russian serfdom|serfs]] and the [[property]] of the [[nobility]].&lt;/ref&gt; When he was twenty five, he helped to establish a Society of Art and Literature, which aimed to unite amateur and professional actors and artists.&lt;ref&gt;Magarshack (1950, 52, 55–56).&lt;/ref&gt; His professional career began in 1896 when he co-founded the [[Moscow Art Theatre]] (MAT) with [[Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko]].&lt;ref&gt;Benedetti (1999a, 61–64).&lt;/ref&gt; Later in his life, he created a series of studios whose aims were primarily [[Theatre pedagogy|pedagogical]] but which also presented public performances.&lt;ref&gt;Gauss (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; This list of productions directed by Stanislavski includes amateur, professional, and studio productions.

When the sources disagree about the exact date of a production's [[Premiere|première]], that given in the most recent biography of Stanislavski—Jean Benedetti's ''Stanislavski: His Life and Art'' (1988, revised and expanded 1999)—is listed here, with the alternative date detailed in the footnotes. Prior to 14 February 1918, the [[Julian calendar]] was in use in Russia, after which the [[Gregorian calendar]] was introduced.&lt;ref&gt;In the 19th century, the difference between the two calendars was twelve days; in the 20th, 13 days; see Gauss (1999, 6).&lt;/ref&gt; The details of productions staged before that change are given in both [[Old Style and New Style dates]].

[[File:Constantin Stanislavski in Goldoni's Locandiera in 1898.jpg|thumb|right|[[Konstantin Stanislavski|Stanislavski]] as Ripafratta in his [[Moscow Art Theatre]] production of [[Carlo Goldoni]]'s comedy ''[[The Mistress of the Inn]]''.]]
* 1898: '''''[[The Mistress of the Inn]]''''' by [[Carlo Goldoni]].

Sergey Tarasov was a member of the company between 1898 and 1899.&lt;/ref&gt; A special performance for factory workers on {{OldStyleDateNY|22 January|10 January}} 1899 provoked a summons by the Chief of Police, [[Dmitri Feodorovich Trepov|Dmitri Trepov]], for failing to seek the approval of the [[Censorship in the Russian Empire|censor]] who oversaw productions for working-class audiences; as a result, the company abandoned its original name as the "Moscow Public-Accessible Theatre" and its aim to provide an "open" theatre, settling instead on [[Anton Chekhov]]'s suggestion, the "[[Moscow Art Theatre]]."&lt;ref&gt;Benedetti (1999a, 87) and Braun (1982, 60).&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1898: '''''[[The Seagull]]''''' by [[Anton Chekhov]].

Vasily Luzhsky also led two of the production's rehearsals.&lt;/ref&gt; Cast included Stanislavski as Trigorin and [[Vsevolod Meyerhold]] as Konstantin, [[Olga Knipper]] as Arkadnia, Maria Lilina as Masha, Maria Roksanova as Nina, Yevgeniya Raevskaya as Polina, [[Ioasaf Tikhomirov]] as Medvedenko, Vasily Luzhsky as Sorin, [[Aleksandr Leonidovich Vishnevsky|Alexander Vishnevsky]] as Dorn, and Alexander Artem as Shamrayev.&lt;ref&gt;Benedetti (1999a, 85—87, 386) Gottlieb (2005, lxxxi—lxxxv, 244), Magarshack (1950, 178—179), and Senelick (2013, vii).&lt;/ref&gt; The production ran for 57 performances in the 1898—99 season, 13 in the next, and 9 in the 1900—01 season.&lt;ref&gt;Magarshack (1950, 182).&lt;/ref&gt; Chekhov disliked Roksanova's performance so intensely that he demanded that she should never be allowed to act in his plays again.&lt;ref&gt;Magarshack (1950, 191).&lt;/ref&gt; For more information on this production, see [[Moscow Art Theatre production of The Seagull|the article on the MAT production of ''The Seagull'']].
* 1899: '''''[[Hedda Gabler]]''''' by [[Henrik Ibsen]]. Opened on {{OldStyleDateNY|3 March|19 February}}. Scenic design by [[Viktor Simov]].

The '''Liverpool Playhouse''' is a theatre in [[Williamson Square]] in the city of [[Liverpool]], England.    It originated in 1866 as a [[music hall]], and in 1911 developed into a [[repertory]] theatre.  As such it nurtured the early careers of many actors and actresses, some of whom went on to achieve national and international reputations. Architectural changes have been made to the building over the years, the latest being in 1968 when a modern-style extension was added to the north of the theatre.  In 1999 a trust was formed, joining the management of the Playhouse with that of the [[Everyman Theatre, Liverpool|Everyman Theatre]].

==History==
The present theatre on the site was designed by Edward Davies, and opened in 1866.  It replaced an earlier theatre called the Star Concert Hall.  The present theatre was originally named the Star Music Hall.&lt;ref name=lloyd&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Liverpool/PlayhouseTheatreLiverpool.htm| title = Playhouse Theatre, Williamson Square, Liverpool F.C.| accessdate = 14 August 2011| publisher = Matthew Lloyd}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895 its name was changed to the Star Theatre of Varieties.  The theatre was improved in 1898 by Harry Percival with a new auditorium and foyer, and electricity was installed.&lt;ref name=lloyd/&gt; In 1911 the Liverpool Repertory Theatre Limited was established, with [[Basil Dean]] as its "controller and producer".  The company could not afford to build a new theatre, and bought the Star Theatre for £28,000 {{Inflation|UK|28000|1911|r=-4|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}).{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}  This made it the first [[repertory]] in Britain to own the [[Freehold (law)|freehold]] of a theatre.  The company spent a further £4,000 ({{Inflation|UK|4000|1911|r=-4|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}) on redesigning and modernising the theatre.&lt;ref name=iles&gt;{{Citation| last = Iles| first = Paul| title = Green Room versus Board Room: Liverpool Playhouse and Business Modelling for Resident Theatres| publisher = The Laughing Audience| url = http://www.laughingaudience.co.uk/business_models.html| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090304170514/http://www.laughingaudience.co.uk/business_models.html| dead-url = yes| archive-date = 4 March 2009| accessdate = 14 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The auditorium and the basement foyer were redesigned by Stanley Adshead, the Professor of Civic Design at the Liverpool School of Architecture.&lt;ref name=pev&gt;{{Citation | last =Pollard| first =Richard | last2 = Pevsner | first2 = Nikolaus | author2-link =Nikolaus Pevsner| series= The Buildings of England|title =Lancashire: Liverpool and the South-West | publisher =[[Yale University Press]] | year =2006 | location =New Haven and London | page = 301| isbn =0-300-10910-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre was for many years managed by [[Maud Carpenter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sarsfieldmemorialsliverpool.co.uk/memorial-maud-farrington-nee-carpenter/|title=Memorial to Maud Farrington nee Carpenter|publisher=Sarsfieldmemorialsliverpool.co.uk|accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre was renamed the Liverpool Repertory Theatre,&lt;ref name=lloyd/&gt; and in 1916 renamed again, as the Liverpool Playhouse.&lt;ref name=iles/&gt; Minor structural alterations were made to the theatre in 1961 and in 1966.&lt;ref name=lloyd/&gt; In 1968 a modern-style extension was added to the north of the theatre to accommodate new foyers, bars, dressing rooms and a workshop.&lt;ref name=pev/&gt; In the 1990s the theatre company went into liquidation.&lt;ref name=iles/&gt; In 1999 the Liverpool and Merseyside Theatres Trust Limited was established as a charity, and the theatre re-opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1081229&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0| title = Liverpool and Merseyside Theatres Trust Ltd| accessdate = 14 August 2011| publisher = [[Charity Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is managed jointly with the [[Everyman Theatre, Liverpool|Everyman Theatre]] by [[Liverpool City Council]].&lt;ref name=pye&gt;{{Citation | last = Pye| first = Ken| year = 2011| title = Discover Liverpool| publication-place = Liverpool| publisher = Trinity Mirror Media| page = 66| isbn = 978-1-906802-90-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistes==
As a repertory company, the theatre has been involved in the careers of actors and actresses who have later achieved wide fame.  [[Noël Coward]] and [[Gertrude Lawrence]] worked with the company as child actors.  Other artistes who gained experience at the theatre include [[Robert Donat]], [[Lilian Braithwaite]], [[Cecil Parker]], [[John Gregson]], [[Clive Brook]], [[C. Aubrey Smith]], [[Richard Burton]], [[Michael Redgrave]], [[Diana Wynyard]], [[Rex Harrison]], [[Patricia Routledge]], [[Anthony Hopkins]], and [[Richard Briers]].&lt;ref name=pye/&gt;

==Architecture==
===Older section===
The exterior of the older part of the theatre is [[stucco]]ed, and it has a [[slate]] roof.  Its entrance front faces Williamson Square.  It has seven [[bay (architecture)|bays]] and is in three storeys.  The central three bays project forward and are surmounted by a broken [[pediment]].  On the ground floor the central bays contain three entrances, separated by pillars, which lead to a recessed porch.  Over each entrance is an [[architrave]] containing a [[fanlight]].  The lateral bays contain two round-headed and one flat-headed entrance on each side, over which are three blind round windows. In the middle storey, the bays are separated by [[pilaster]]s.  The three central bays each have a [[baluster|balustrade]] and a window with a [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] containing a roundel.  Each of the three lateral bays contains a window with a [[cornice]], and a round window above it.  Along the top storey are [[Oculus|oculi]] between panelled pilasters.  On the summit of each of the two lateral bays is a [[cupola]] on a short [[Tuscan order|Tuscan]] [[colonnade]].  Inside the older part of the theatre are two balconies supported by [[cast iron]] columns.  The interior is decorated in [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]] style.&lt;ref name=nhl&gt;{{NHLE |num= 1218642|desc= Playhouse Theatre, Liverpool F.C.|accessdate= 20 August 2013|mode=cs2|ps=none}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newer section===
The newer section is constructed in concrete, and largely faced by glass.  On the ground floor are entrance doors.&lt;ref name=nhl/&gt; Above this, the building is based around three cylinders.  The largest of these starts at the first floor and rises through two storeys.  It is [[cantilever]]ed from a central column.  To the left is a smaller cylinder, cantilevered from a separate column, interlocking with the larger cylinder.  Inside the whole is a hollow column containing the stairs.&lt;ref name=pev/&gt;

===Assessment and critique===
The theatre is recorded in the [[National Heritage List for England]] as a designated Grade&amp;nbsp;II* [[Listed building#England and Wales|listed building]], having been designated on 14 March 1975.&lt;ref name=nhl/&gt; In its description, the list quotes the ''[[Architects' Journal]]'' of 1968 which says of the older section that it is "significant as an early and rare work by one of the pioneers of the Liverpool School of Architecture, in the Grecian style favoured by the school at that date", and of the newer section that it is "a brilliant concept, joyously realised, which exploits asymmetrical volumes and ever varying spaces yet achieves unity and also balance with the adjoining [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] façade".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publication-date = 4 December 1968| title = | periodical = [[Architects' Journal]]| page = 1327}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Pevsner Architectural Guides|Buildings of England]]'' series the architectural historians Richard Pollard and [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] say of the newer section that it is "a spectacular composition" which creates an atmosphere of excitement and anticipation, exactly right for a theatre foyer".&lt;ref name=pev/&gt;

'''''Never Cry Wolf''''' is an account of the author’s experience observing wolves in subarctic Canada&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.rit.edu/~kecncp/Courses/Materials/NeverCryWolf/NCW-book/Mini-Guide.Mowat.pdf|title=Never Cry Wolf|work=People.rit.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Farley Mowat]], first published in 1963 by [[McClelland and Stewart]]. It was adapted into a [[Never Cry Wolf (film)|film of the same name]] in 1983. It has been credited for dramatically changing the public image of the [[wolf]] to a more positive one.

==Form of the book==
In the book, Mowat describes his experiences in a first-person narrative that sheds light on his research into the nature of the [[Arctic wolf]].

In 1948–1949, the Dominion Wildlife Service assigns the author to investigate the cause of declining [[caribou]] populations and determine whether wolves are to blame for the shortage. Upon finding his quarry near [[Nueltin Lake]], Mowat discovers that rather than being wanton killers of caribou, the wolves subsist quite heavily on small mammals such as rodents and hares, "even choosing them over caribou when available."

==Conclusions==
He concludes: "We have doomed the wolf not for what it is but for what we deliberately and mistakenly perceive it to be: the mythologized epitome of a savage, ruthless killer—which is, in reality, not more than the reflected image of ourselves. We have made it the scapewolf for our own sins." Mowat writes to expose the onslaught of [[wolfers (hunting)|wolfers]] and government exterminators who are out to erase the wolves from the Arctic.

==Points and claims==
Mowat's book says that:
* The main reason for declining population of caribou is human hunters from civilization.
* Wolves that hunt a large herd animal would rather attack weaker, injured, or older animals, which helps rid the herd of members that slow its migration.
* Arctic wolves usually prey on Arctic ox, caribou, smaller mammals, and rodents—but since they rely on stamina instead of speed, it would be logical for the wolves to choose smaller prey instead of large animals like caribou, which are faster and stronger, and therefore a more formidable target. One of these animals may include mice.
* A lone Arctic wolf has a better chance of killing small prey by running alongside it and attacking its neck. The wolf would be at a disadvantage if it attacked large prey from behind, because the animal's powerful hind legs could injure the wolf. However, a group of wolves may successfully attack large prey from a number of positions.
* Since Arctic wolves often travel in a group, their best strategy is not to kill surplus prey, since the whole group can sate themselves on one or two large animals. There are, however, exceptions to this.
* There are many local Eskimos, the majority of whom are traders.
* The Eskimos can interpret wolves' howls. They can tell things such as whether a herd or a human is passing through the wolves' territory, the direction of travel, and more.

==Reception==
[[Barry Lopez]] in his 1978 work ''Of Wolves and Men'' called the book a dated, but still good introduction to wolf behaviour.&lt;ref name="Lopez"&gt;{{cite book | author = Lopez, Barry | title = Of wolves and men | year = 1978 | pages = 320 | isbn = 0-7432-4936-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2001 article of ''The Canadian Historical Review'' entitled ''Never Cry Wolf: Science, Sentiment, and the Literary Rehabilitation of Canis Lupus'', Karen Jones lauded the work as "an important chapter in the history of Canadian environmentalism";&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;Karen Jones, ''Never Cry Wolf: Science, Sentiment, and the Literary Rehabilitation of Canis Lupus'', The Canadian Historical Review vol.84 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|The deluge of letters received by the Canadian Wildlife Service from concerned citizens opposing the killing of wolves testifies to the growing significance of literature as a protest medium. Modern Canadians roused to defend a species that their predecessors sought to eradicate. By the 1960s the wolf had made the transition from the beast of waste and desolation (in the words of [[Theodore Roosevelt]]) to a conservationist cause celebre....''Never Cry Wolf'' played a key role in fostering that change.|Karen Jones, "Never Cry Wolf: Science, Sentiment, and the Literary Rehabilitation of Canis Lupus", ''The Canadian Historical Review'' vol.84 (2001)}}

At the time it was published, Mowat's book received criticism, often politically-motivated, about the veracity of his work and its conclusions. Canadian Wildlife Service official Alexander William Francis Banfield, who supervised Mowat's field work, characterised the book as "semi-fictional", and accused Mowat of blatantly lying about his expedition. He pointed out that contrary to what is written in the book, Mowat was part of an expedition of three biologists, and was never alone. Banfield also pointed out that a lot of what was written in ''Never Cry Wolf'' was not derived from Mowat's first hand observations, but were plagiarised from Banfield's own works, as well as from [[Adolph Murie]]'s ''The Wolves of Mount McKinley''.&lt;ref name="Banfield"&gt;A.W.F Banfield, Review, "Never Cry Wolf", ''Canadian Field Naturalist'' 78, (January–March 1964): 52–54&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1964 article published in the ''Canadian Field-Naturalist'', he compared Mowat's 1963 bestseller to [[Little Red Riding Hood]], claiming that, "I hope that readers of ''Never Cry Wolf'' will realize that both stories have about the same factual content."&lt;ref name="Banfield" /&gt;

In the May 1996 issue of ''[[Saturday Night (magazine)|Saturday Night]]'', John Goddard wrote a heavily researched article entitled ''A Real Whopper'', in which he poked many holes in Mowat's claim that the book was non-fictional. He wrote:

{{Quotation|"As for the authenticity of his wolf story, he virtually abandoned his wolf-den observations after less than four weeks."|John Goddard, ''A Real Whopper'' from ''Saturday Night'' May 1996}}

Mowat excoriated Goddard's article as, "...bullshit, pure and simple... this guy’s got as many facts wrong as there are flies on a toad that’s roadkill.".&lt;ref name="Burghes"&gt;{{cite web|last=Burgess |first=Steve |date=1999-05-11 |url=http://www.salon.com/people/bc/1999/05/11/mowat/index1.html |title=Northern exposure |publisher=Salon |accessdate=2006-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060111000538/http://www.salon.com/people/bc/1999/05/11/mowat/index1.html |archivedate=2006-01-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Val Ross]] of ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' agreed that "Mowat, more passionate polemicist than rigorous reporter, painted federal bureaucrats in darker colours than many deserved," but that Goddard's piece erred in the same way against Mowat.&lt;ref name="Ross"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ross|first=Val|year=1996|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/a-smile-for-the-ages-a-legacy-in-words/article17981307/?page=all|title=A smile for the ages, a legacy in words|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|accessdate=2008-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a claim that Mowat makes was that he interacted closely with a wolf pack alone in order to study them, the first wildlife biologist to successfully use the method of [[habituation]] to study and follow wild wolf packs in close proximity was fellow CWS scientist and International Wolf Specialist Group Canadian representative [[Ludwig N. Carbyn|Dr. Lu Carbyn]], in a 1970s study in Jasper National Park. Although also pointing out ''Never Cry Wolf'''s fictional rather than factual nature, his remarks were less critical, calling Farley Mowat's book "Good fiction and good reading".&lt;ref name="hol"&gt;Holubitsky, J. (1999) "Dancing with wolves: The man who dared to go amid the pack". ''Edmonton Journal.'' 5 September 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Mowat spoke to the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' about his self-acknowledged reputation as a storyteller: “For years I felt the Toronto media were out to bury me alive," referring to latter-day efforts in the literary community to reassess his work according to the standards of modern journalism as opposed to memoir. “That was never my game,” he said. “I took some pride in having it known that I never let facts get in the way of a good story. I was writing subjective non-fiction all along.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Farley Mowat, acclaimed Canadian author, dead at 92|author=Rinehart, Dianne|date=May 7, 2014|work=[[Toronto Star]]|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/books/2014/05/07/farley_mowat_acclaimed_canadian_author_dead_at_92.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==
''Never Cry Wolf'' was a commercial success in Canada. Shortly after its publication, the [[Canadian Wildlife Service]] received a deluge of letters from concerned citizens opposing the killing of wolves. Though generally well received by the public, Mowat's allusions of the Canadian Wildlife Service as an organisation set out to exterminate wolves was met with anger from Canadian biologists. CWS staff members argued that the agency had never demanded the extermination of the wolf, the wolf being recognized as an integral part of the northern ecosystem. They further countered that Mowat's remit had not been to find justifications for wolf extermination, but to investigate the relationship between wolves and caribou. The locals were actually hunting the caribou, for a sport and a food source.&lt;ref name="Jones" /&gt;

As with Mowat's other books, ''Never Cry Wolf'' was translated into [[Russian language|Russian]] and published in the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="Black"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Black |first=Joseph L. |year=1995 |issue=Summer 1995 |title=Canada in the Soviet mirror: English-Canadian literature in Soviet translation  |journal=Journal of Canadian Studies |issn= 0021-9495 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3683/is_199507/ai_n8718950/ |accessdate=2009-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book's message that wolves were harmless mouse-eaters became influential, leading to popular reaction against Soviet wolf-culling efforts.&lt;ref name="Graves"&gt;{{cite book | author = Graves, Will | url = http://www.wolvesinrussia.com/ | title = Wolves in Russia: Anxiety throughout the ages | year = 2007 | pages = 222 | isbn = 1-55059-332-3 | access-date = 2008-08-18 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090802182158/http://www.wolvesinrussia.com/ | archive-date = 2009-08-02 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''recipe''' is a set of instructions that describes how to prepare or make something, especially a culinary [[dish (food)|dish]]. It is also used in medicine or in information technology (user acceptance). A doctor will usually begin a [[Medical prescription|prescription]] with ''recipe'', Latin for ''take'', usually abbreviated to Rx or an equivalent symbol (℞).

==History==

===Early examples===
[[File:Apicius 1541.jpg|thumb|right|Apicius, ''De re culinaria'', an early collection of recipes.]]
The earliest known written recipes date from approximately 1600 BC and come from an [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] tablet from southern [[Babylonia]].&lt;ref&gt;Jean Bottéro, ''Textes culinaires Mésopotamiens'', 1995. {{ISBN|0-931464-92-7}}; commentary at [http://www.semeia.org/publications/article.aspx?articleId=703 Society of Biblical Literature]&lt;/ref&gt; There are also works in [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[hieroglyph]]s depicting the preparation of food.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ancient Egyptian cuisine]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many ancient Greek recipes are known. [[Mithaecus]]'s cookbook was an early one, but most of it has been lost; [[Athenaeus]] quotes one short recipe in his [[Deipnosophistae]]. [[Athenaeus]] mentions many other cookbooks, all of them lost.&lt;ref name=dalby&gt;[[Andrew Dalby]], ''Food in the Ancient World from A to Z'', 2003. {{ISBN|0-415-23259-7}} p. 97-98.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman recipes are known starting in the 2nd century BCE with [[Cato the Elder]]'s [[De Agri Cultura]]. Many authors of this period described eastern Mediterranean cooking in Greek and in Latin.&lt;ref name=dalby /&gt; Some [[Punic]] recipes are known in Greek and Latin translation.&lt;ref name=dalby /&gt;

The large collection of recipes ''De re coquinaria'', conventionally titled [[Apicius]], appeared in the 4th or 5th century and is the only complete surviving cookbook from the classical world.&lt;ref name=dalby /&gt; It lists the courses served in a meal as Gustatio (appetizer), Primae Mensae (main course) and Secundae Mensae (dessert).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Roman food in Britain | accessdate =  2007-05-10 | url = http://romans-in-britain.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each recipe begins with the Latin command "Take...," "Recipe...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Colquhoun |first1=Kate |title=Taste: The Story of Britain through its Cooking |date=2008 |origyear=2007 |publisher=Bloomsbury |isbn=978-0-747-59306-5 |page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arabic recipes are documented starting in the 10th century; see [[Ibn Sayyar al-Warraq|al-Warraq]] and [[Muhammad bin Hasan al-Baghdadi|al-Baghdadi]].

The earliest recipe in [[Persian cuisine|Persian]] dates from the 14th century. Several recipes have survived from the time of [[Safavid]]s, including ''Karnameh'' (1521) by Mohammad Ali Bavarchi, which includes the cooking instruction of more than 130 different dishes and pastries, and ''Madat-ol-Hayat'' (1597) by Nurollah Ashpaz.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.art-of-music.net/ppdf/nppdf/2835/p0283539930101.pdf Jaam-e Jam]&lt;/ref&gt; Recipe books from the [[Qajar]] period are numerous, the most notable being ''Khorak-ha-ye Irani'' by prince Nader Mirza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=کتاب خوراک های ایرانی | website=مجله تصویری فرهنگ غذا | date=December 3, 2016 | url=http://foodculture.ir/food-culture/%da%a9%d8%aa%d8%a7%d8%a8-%d8%ae%d9%88%d8%b1%d8%a7%da%a9-%d9%87%d8%a7%db%8c-%d8%a7%db%8c%d8%b1%d8%a7%d9%86%db%8c-%d8%af%d8%b1-%d8%b2%d9%85%d8%a7%d9%86-%d9%82%d8%a7%d8%ac%d8%a7%d8%b1/ | language=fa | ref={{sfnref | مجله تصویری فرهنگ غذا | 2016}} | access-date=November 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King Richard II of England commissioned a recipe book called ''[[Forme of Cury]]'' in 1390,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = COMDA Calendar Co. | title = 2007 Recipe Calendar | publisher = COMDA, Canada }}&lt;/ref&gt; and around the same time, another book was published entitled ''[[Curye on Inglish]]'', "cury" meaning cooking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hicatt | first = Constance B | author2 = Sharon Butler | title = English Culinary Manuscripts of the 14C | year = 1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both books give an impression of how food for the noble classes was prepared and served [[English cuisine|in England]] at that time. The luxurious taste of the [[aristocracy]] in the [[Early Modern Period]] brought with it the start of what can be called the modern recipe book. By the 15th century, numerous manuscripts were appearing detailing the recipes of the day. Many of these manuscripts give very good information and record the re-discovery of many herbs and spices including [[coriander]], parsley, basil and [[rosemary]], many of which had been brought back from the [[Crusades]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Austin | first = Thomas | title = Ashmole and other Manuscripts | year = 1888}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern recipes and cooking advice===
[[Image:ActonFish.jpg|thumb|from ''Modern Cookery for Private Families'' by Eliza Acton (London: Longmans, Green, Reader, and Dyer, 1871. p.48.)]]
With the advent of the [[printing press]] in the 16th and 17th centuries, numerous books were written on how to manage households and prepare food. In Holland&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sieben | first = Ria Jansen | title = Een notable boecxtken van cokeryen | year = 1588}}&lt;/ref&gt; and England,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = anon | title = The good Huswifes handmaid for Cookerie | year = 1588 }}&lt;/ref&gt; competition grew between the noble families as to who could prepare the most lavish banquet. By the 1660s, cookery progressed to an art form and good cooks were in demand. Many families published their own books detailing their recipes in competition with their rivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = May | first = Robert | title = The accomplifht Cook |  year = 1685}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these books have been translated and are available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Medieval Cookbooks | author = Judy Gerjuoy | accessdate = 2007-06-15 | url = http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/articles/food_bibliography.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 19th century, the Victorian preoccupation for domestic respectability brought about the emergence of cookery writing in its modern form. Although eclipsed in fame and regard by [[Isabella Beeton]], the first modern cookery writer and compiler of recipes for the home was [[Eliza Acton]]. Her pioneering cookbook, ''Modern Cookery for Private Families'' published in 1845, was aimed at the domestic reader rather than the professional cook or chef. This was immensely influential, establishing the format for modern writing about cookery. It introduced the now-universal practice of listing the ingredients and suggested cooking times with each recipe. It included the first recipe for [[Brussels sprouts]].&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, ''Food For Thought: Extraordinary Little Chronicles of the World'', (2004) pg 144&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary chef [[Delia Smith]] called Acton "the best writer of recipes in the English language."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hub-uk.com/interesting/delia-british-library.htm Interview].&lt;/ref&gt; ''Modern Cookery'' long survived Acton, remaining in print until 1914 and available more recently in facsimile.

[[File:Isabella Beeton - Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management - title page.jpg|thumb|left|270x270px|Titlepage of ''Beeton's Book of Household Management'']]
Acton's work was an important influence on Isabella Beeton,&lt;ref name=Acton&gt;{{cite book|title=Acton, Eliza (1799–1859)|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-2591300080.html|work=[[Women in World History|Women in World History: A Biographical Encyclopedia]]|publisher=Gale Research Inc.|accessdate=8 January 2013|date=January 2002}}{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; who published ''[[Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management]]'' in 24 monthly parts between 1857 and 1861. This was a guide to running a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] household, with advice on fashion, [[child care]], [[animal husbandry]], [[poison]]s, the management of [[Domestic worker|servants]], science, religion, and industrialism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/b/beeton/isabella/household/chapter16.html:''General Observations on the Common Hog'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tracingpaper.org.uk/2007/04/21/food-in-season-in-1861/''Food in season in April 1861'']&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 1,112 pages, over 900 contained recipes. Most were illustrated with coloured engravings. It is said that many of the recipes were plagiarised from earlier writers such as Acton, but the Beetons never claimed that the book's contents were original. It was intended as a reliable guide for the aspirant middle classes.

The American cook [[Fannie Farmer]] (1857–1915) published in 1896 her famous work ''The Boston Cooking School Cookbook'' which contained some 1,849 recipes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cunningham | first = Marion | title = The Fannie Farmer Cookbook (revised) | publisher = Bantam Books, New York | year = 1979 | isbn = 978-0-553-56881-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==

[[File:Pistachio cake.png|thumb|250px|right|Recipe with ingredients integrated into the method]]
Modern culinary recipes normally consist of several components
* The name of the recipe (Origins/History of the dish)
* Yield: The number of servings that the dish provides.
* List all ingredients in the order of its use. Describe it in step by step instructions.
* Listing ingredients by the quantity (Write out abbreviations. Ounces instead of oz).
* How much time does it take to prepare the dish, plus cooking time for the dish.
* Necessary equipment used for the dish.
* Cooking procedures. Temperature and bake time if necessary.
* Serving procedures (Served while warm/cold).
* Review of the dish (Would you recommend this dish to a friend?).
* Photograph of the dish (Optional).
* Nutritional Value: Helps for dietary restrictions. Includes number of calories or grams per serving.


Earlier recipes often included much less information, serving more as a reminder of ingredients and proportions for someone who already knew how to prepare the dish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Paradowski|first1=Michał B.|title=Through catering college to the naked chef – teaching LSP and culinary translation. In: Bogucki, Łukasz (Ed.) Teaching Translation and Interpreting: Challenges and Practices|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Press|location=Newcastle-upon-Tyne|pages=137–165}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Paradowski|first1=Michał B.|title=What's cooking in English culinary texts?

Recipe writers sometimes also list variations of a traditional dish, to give different tastes of the same recipes.

==Internet and television recipes==
By the mid 20th century, there were thousands of cookery and recipe books available. The next revolution came with the introduction of the TV cooks. The first TV cook in England was [[Fanny Cradock]] with a show on the BBC. TV cookery programs brought recipes to a new audience. In the early days, recipes were available by post from the BBC; later with the introduction of [[CEEFAX]] text on screen, they became available on television.

The first Internet [[Usenet newsgroup]] dedicated to cooking was ''net.cooks'' created in 1982, later becoming ''[news:///rec.food.cooking rec.food.cooking]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Victor |last=Sack |title=rec.food.cooking FAQ and conversion file |at=sec. 6.1 |url=http://vsack.homepage.t-online.de/rfc_faq0.html#6.1 |date=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It served as a forum to share recipes text files and cooking techniques.

In the early 21st century, there has been a renewed focus on cooking at home due to the [[late-2000s recession]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124148676424885935|title=Web Recipes Are Cooking With Gas |last= Holmes |first=Elizabeth |date=2009-05-05 |publisher=Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Television networks such as the [[Food Network]] and magazines are still a major source of recipe information, with international cooks and chefs such as [[Jamie Oliver]], [[Gordon Ramsay]], [[Nigella Lawson]] and [[Rachael Ray]] having prime-time shows and backing them up with Internet websites giving the details of all their recipes. These were joined by reality TV shows such as [[Top Chef]] or [[Iron Chef]], and many Internet sites offering free recipes, but cookery books remain as popular as ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Cookbooks surge to top category at libraries | author=Andriani, Lynn | accessdate=2013-10-14| url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/cooking/article/46214-cookbooks-surge-to-top-category-at-libraries.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recipe design tools==
[[Molecular gastronomy]] provides [[chef]]s with cooking techniques and ingredients, but this discipline also provides new theories and methods which aid recipe design. These methods are used by [[chef]]s, [[foodie]]s, home cooks and even [[Bartender|mixologists]] worldwide to improve or design recipes.

[[File:Michel de Klerk Competition Amsterdam 1917.jpg|thumb|alt=Drawing of a long, low building|[[Michel de Klerk]]'s 1918 competition design for the Rijsksakademe van beeldende kunsten]]
[[File:Rijksacademie-amsterdam.jpg|thumb|right|200px|alt=Small area surrounded by buildings|Courtyard]]
The '''Rijksakademie van beeldende kunsten''' (State Academy of Fine Arts) was founded in 1870 in [[Amsterdam]]. It is a classical academy, a place where [[philosopher]]s, academics and artists meet to test and exchange ideas and knowledge. The school supports [[Visual arts|visual artists]] with a two-year curriculum.

The Rijksakademie van beeldende kunsten was the home of [[Amsterdam Impressionism]], part of the international [[Impressionism|impressionist]] movement, and is known as the School of Allebé by art historians; [[August Allebé]] became the school's director in 1880. In French language the school was called "l'Académie Royale des Beaux Arts d'Amsterdam". Among its pioneers here were [[Breitner|Georg Breitner]], [[Jan Toorop]], [[Piet Mondrian]] and [[Willem Witsen|Willem Arnoldus Witsen]]. Other artists connected with the academy were Hendrik Petrus Berlage, Willem Wiegmans, Constant Nieuwenhuijs, Karel Appel, Corneille, Ger Lataster, Willem Hofhuizen, and Jaap Min.

The school provides an education academically comparable with a university. There are open days each year, which provide an opportunity to see the work of young artists.

=={{anchor|History from 1718 to 1869}}1718 to 1869==
From 1718 to 1819 Amsterdam had an art school, the ''Stadstekenacademie Amsterdam''. In 1820, the ''Koninklijke Academie van Beeldende Kunsten'' continued the artistic tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Its rival was the [[Royal Academy of Art, The Hague]]. This academy, founded in 1682 as a night school for painting and drawing, had club evenings on Saturdays. From 1820 to about 1830, Amsterdam and The Hague struggled for supremacy in the art world of the Netherlands. The merger with the engineering school gave The Hague an advantage.&lt;/ref&gt; The prevailing style was panel painting in oil, [[landscape painting]] influenced by [[neoclassicism]]. In 1869, the Amsterdam school received its present name.

=={{anchor|Early history of the Rijksakademie}}Early history==

The academy was a place for philosophers, scientists and artists to come together and share knowledge and ideas. In 1870, the academy was founded by King [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|William III]] as a successor to the 19th-century Koninklijke Academie, the 18th-century Stads Teekenacademie and the 17th-century Konstkamer to give visual artists an educational opportunity. Early students included [[George Hendrik Breitner]], [[Isaac Israëls]] and [[Willem Witsen]], who were influenced by Amsterdam Impressionism.

Under director [[August Allebé]], the [[Luke the Evangelist|Saint Luke]] (patron saint of artists) student movement was founded.&lt;ref&gt;The circle of friends became an association of artists on the Amsterdam art scene.&lt;/ref&gt; Allebé's cosmopolitan attitude changed the school's method of instruction, emphasizing the [[avant-garde]].

=={{anchor|The Academy today}}Present day==
Around 1985, the school received the additional title of Instituut voor Praktijkstudie and offered postdoctoral education. In 1992 it moved into a former cavalry barracks at Sarphatistraat 470 in Amsterdam, and the buildings were renovated. In November 1999, it became an independent art institution. The school is financed by the Ministry of Education and private sponsors.&lt;ref&gt;This revived the system of finance used in the Netherlands during the 19th century: first, private sponsors provide funding and the state intervenes if this is unsuccessful.&lt;/ref&gt; The institute offers workshops with specialized technical personnel and a library focusing on [[contemporary art]] and [[art history]]. Students receive a scholarship and are offered a studio in which to live. In recent years nearly 1,200 students have applied for a place at the academy, and each year about 20 are accepted. The artists come from all over the world, with less than half from the Netherlands. Artists and [[art critic]]s are often invited to visit student studios.

==Prix de Rome==
[[File:Willemi.jpg|thumb|alt=1819 painting of a young King William I|William I, King of the Netherlands, continued the Prix de Rome.]]
The Academy awards a [[Prix de Rome (Netherlands)|Prix de Rome]] to eligible artists and [[architect]]s. The award originated with the French [[Prix de Rome]] in 1666. In 1808 [[Louis Bonaparte]] introduced the prize in the Netherlands to promote art, and it was supported by Dutch [[William I of the Netherlands|King William I]]. Since 1870 the Rijksakademie has made the award, the oldest and most valuable art prize in the Netherlands.

In 1985, the Prix de Rome was reorganised. Prize money was increased, and there were more participating artists; new art categories were added, which change annually. In 2006 its name was changed to "Prix de Rome.nl" and it is awarded in two categories: architecture and fine arts. The prize is [[Euro|€]]40,000 and a residency in Rome.

[[File:William Blake Samuel Collings, May-Day in London, 1784.jpg|thumb|300px|right| ''[[May Day]] in [[London]]'', engraving by [[William Blake]] based on art by Samuel Collings, The Wits Magazine Vol I May 1784]]

'''Samuel Collings''' ([[floruit|fl.]] 1780–1790?) was a British painter and caricaturist of 18th century.

==Life==
He first appeared as an exhibitor at the [[Royal Academy]] in 1784, sending ''The Children in the Wood, a Sketch;'' in 1785 he exhibited ''The Chamber of Genius,'' which was engraved by [[Thomas Rowlandson]]; in 1786 ''The Triumph of Sensibility.'' 
He exhibited for the last time in 1789, sending 'The Frost on the Thames, sketched on the spot.'{{sfn|Cust|1887}}

Collings is best known, however, as a caricaturist; he was a friend of [[Thomas Rowlandson]], and contributed designs, which were etched by Rowlandson for some of his satirical publications, notably the satires on [[Johnson]] and [[James Boswell|Boswell]]'s  ''[[The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides|Tour to the Hebrides]]'', (published by [[Elizabeth Jackson (publisher)| Elizabeth Jackson]] in 1786), and on [[Goethe]]'s ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]''. 
The original drawings for the former are in the [[South Kensington Museum]], and have been erroneously attributed to [[Henry Bunbury (caricaturist)|Henry Bunbury]].{{sfn|Cust|1887}}

To the ''[[The Wit's Magazine|Wit's Magazine]]'' for 1784 Collings contributed some designs of a humorous character, which were engraved by [[William Blake]] and others. 
To the same magazine he contributed verses, and seems to have been as productive with his pen as with his pencil. 
He painted a portrait of [[Lord Thurlow]], which was engraved by J. Condé; a picture by him, entitled 'The Disinherited Heir,' was published in aquatint by [[Francis Jukes]]. 
It is not known when he died.{{sfn|Cust|1887}}

'''Social practice''' is an art medium focusing on engagement through human interaction and social discourse.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Education for Socially Engaged Art|last=Helguera|first=Pablo|publisher=Jorge Pinto Books|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since people and their relationships form the medium of such works – rather than a particular process of production – social engagement is not only a part of a work’s organization, execution, or continuation, but also an aesthetic in itself: of interaction and development.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=What we Made: conversations on art and social cooperation|last=Finkelpearl|first=Tom|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=Durham|pages=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Socially engaged art aims to create social and/or political change through collaboration with individuals, communities, and institutions in the creation of participatory art.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.artjob.org/content/collaboration-where-art-social-practice-begins&lt;/ref&gt;  The discipline values the process of a work over any finished product or object.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

Artists working in social practice co-create their work with a specific audience or propose critical interventions within existing social systems to inspire debate or catalyze social exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cca.edu/academics/graduate/fine-arts/socialpractices|title=Social Practice Workshop|publisher=California College of the Arts|accessdate= Sep 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The large overlap between social practice and pedagogy demonstrates the need for art education to embrace collaborative practice.&lt;ref&gt;Sholette, G. (n.d.). “After OWS: social practice art, abstraction, and the limits of the social”. Retrieved April 25, 2013, from http://www.e-flux.com/journal/after-ows-social-practice-art-abstraction-and-the-limits-of-the-social/.&lt;/ref&gt;  Social practice work focuses on the interaction between the audience, social systems, and the artist through [[aesthetics]], [[ethics]], [[collaboration]], methodology, antagonism, media strategies, and [[social activism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reviewsinculture.com/?r=97&lt;/ref&gt; The social interaction component inspires, drives, or, in some instances, completes the project.&lt;ref&gt;http://badatsports.com/2011/social-practice-arts-identity-crisis/&lt;/ref&gt; Although projects may incorporate traditional studio media, they are realized in a variety of visual or social forms (depending on variable contexts and participant demographics) such as [[Performance art|performance]], [[Protest art|social activism]], or mobilizing communities towards a common goal.&lt;ref&gt;http://isreview.org/issue/90/critique-social-practice-art&lt;/ref&gt;  The diversity of approaches pose specific challenges for documenting social practice work, as the aesthetic of human interaction changes rapidly and involves many people simultaneously. Consequently, images frequently fail to do justice to the engagement and interactions that take place during a project.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Artificial Hells: Participatory Art and the politics of Spectatorship|last=Bishop|first=Claire|publisher=Verso Books|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of terminology==

Until 2005, the term "social practice" was used in a branch of social theory considering human relationships to each other and to the larger society as "practices". The term "art and social practice" was institutionalized in 2005 with the creation of the Social Practice [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] concentration at the [[California College of the Arts]],&lt;ref name="Artnews"&gt;http://www.artnews.com/2013/10/31/how-to-speak-artspeak-properly/&lt;/ref&gt; followed by other institutions of higher education offering similar degrees. Social practice art as a medium has been referenced in the ''New York Times'',&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/24/arts/design/outside-the-citadel-social-practice-art-is-intended-to-nurture.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/07/education/edlife/social-practice-degrees-take-art-to-a-communal-level.html|title=Social Practice Degrees Take Art to a Communal Level|last=Grant|first=Daniel|date=2016-02-05|access-date=2016-02-08|issn=0362-4331|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Artforum'',&lt;ref&gt;http://artforum.com/inprint/issue=201207&amp;id=31944&amp;pagenum=1&lt;/ref&gt; ''ArtNews,''&lt;ref name="Artnews" /&gt; and ''Art Practical.''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artpractical.com/feature/notes_toward_a_non_anthropocentric_social_practice/&lt;/ref&gt;  As an emerging field, social practice can encompass a variety of terms: public practice,&lt;ref name="OtisGPP"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.otis.edu/graduate-public-practice|title=Graduate Public Practice|website=Otis College of Art and Design|access-date=2016-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; socially engaged art,&lt;ref&gt;http://pablohelguera.net/2011/11/education-for-socially-engaged-art-2011/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Community arts|community art]], new-genre public art,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Mapping-Terrain-New-Genre-Public/dp/0941920305&lt;/ref&gt; [[participatory art]], [[Art intervention|interventionist art]], [[Collaboration#occupational examples|collaborative art]],&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, Claire. “The Social Turn: Collaboration and Its Discontents” ''Artforum,'' February 2006, 178-83.&lt;/ref&gt; [[relational art]] and dialogical aesthetics.&lt;ref name="Artnews" /&gt;

== Characteristics of social practice ==
Socially engaged art differs from its art historical ancestors in that it is not a specific movement or style, but rather a way of defining a new social order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Living as Form, Socially Engaged Art from 1991-2011|last=Thompson|first=Nato|publisher=MIT Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thousands of existing social practice projects across the world have taken vastly different approaches to their combination of publics, methodologies, aesthetics, and environments, yet these projects all share an aesthetic of human interaction and development. The end products of such works are not commodities, but rather processes for constructive social change.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Some foundational characteristics of socially engaged art remain consistently relevant to a diverse range of works. For an artist or producer to create a successful social practice work, they must consider the unique context in which they are working, and identify specific characteristics of the community and environment. They must also balance aesthetic and methodology in their work, align the timeline of a project with its purpose: a quick-impact ephemeral work, or the regularity of a longitudinal work. 

=== Community and environment ===
Social practice artists and producers aim to affect their community and environment in a real (rather than symbolic) way that enables social and political change.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Each project is tailored to the community and environment in which it will take place.  In social practice the identification of the public, or audience, precedes the project's development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  It is impossible to create a project founded upon engagement and collaboration without first making assumptions as to who will be involved.  ''Who'' the artist or producer wishes to engage and ''where'' they wish to engage are therefore core characteristics of socially engaged art.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

Environment could be described on two primary levels: the broader community, city, or region; and the immediate space being occupied – a street, museum, studio, or other area. To understand the context in which they are working, artists and producers must develop relationships with individuals, organizations and institutions that intersect many different parts of their community and environment.  One theorist makes the comparison between socially engaged art projects to exotic fruit, stating that both “usually travel poorly when “exported” to other locations to be replicated.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The community and environment are therefore not merely external influencers on a specific project – they are inherent characteristics.

=== Aesthetics and methodology ===
For much of art history, a work's aesthetic has been upheld as the primary measure of its quality. The 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century broadened the public understanding of art to consider concept and process alongside aesthetic, and by the new millennium the tables had turned to emphasize process over product: one of the defining characteristics of socially engaged art. Process is determined by method; thus social practice producers and artists are often more concerned with the methodology rather than the aesthetic of their work. Many argue that social practice has created a new aesthetic of its own: an aesthetic of human interaction and development that is based not on spectatorship but on participation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  This aesthetic captures the diverse methods employed by socially engaged art and encompasses not only traditional methods of painting, photography, architecture, and performance; but also nontraditional forms borrowed from other disciplines, such as festivals, conferences, schools, and protests.  

Aesthetics are typically hierarchical, highly subjective, and greatly determined by external influencers, such as the imagery of a given culture, or the relationship between appearance and market value.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  To escape these external influencers, aesthetics can also be defined in terms of “aesthesis,” an autonomous realm of experience and judgment that cannot be reduced to logic, reason or morality but is of great importance to humankind.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Aesthetics  have the capacity to critique our beliefs and values by restructuring our perception of the world.  Their application can achieve one of the core aims of socially engaged art: the definition of a new social order characterized by engagement and participation.

Methodology in socially engaged art refers to the set of practices used throughout the process and production of a project. The method is no longer a means to an end, but an end within itself: the experience of creation and experimentation is a central element of social practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Education for Socially Engaged Art|last=Helguera|first=Pablo|publisher=Verso Books|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While aesthetics reframe ideas and beliefs outside of the disciplines in which we have accepted them, methodology takes the frameworks of those disciplines to produce new aesthetics. Socially engaged art has embraced conferences, urban regeneration projects, pedagogical projects, and protests, which are all frameworks borrowed from other disciplines.

While aesthetics and methodology can have conflicting interests, there are important reasons why artists and producers should seek to integrate the two. Methodology will engage the public, but aesthetics will play a large role in determining how a project is interpreted.
While aesthetics and methodology can have conflicting interests, there are important reasons why artists and producers should seek to integrate the two. Ultimately, the two can work together to enhance each other: the aesthetic value of a project can increase its social function, while the method can heighten the aesthetic experience through public engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=What We Made: Conversations on art and social cooperations|last=Finkelpearl|first=Tom|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=Durham|pages=346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Longevity vs. ephemerality ===
The method and aesthetic adopted in social practice work is greatly influenced by intended timeline.  Length determines the type of social and/or political change the artist aims to achieve, the types of dialogue created, and the ways in which an individual can engage with a work. The length of a project is also extremely situational. Some projects aim to have an immediate impact, while others prefer to build relationships that foster change over an extended period.

Ephemeral projects are typically characterized by temporary gatherings and occupation of space. They create situations in which social interactions are momentary and not expected to become long-lasting. The immediate impact of ephemeral works often means they take place around a particular issue or concept. Protests, festivals, conferences, or pop-up performances have all been used as mediums for ephemeral social practice work.

Longitudinal projects are those built upon regular and reoccurring social interactions and dialogue, organized with the intention to be sustained over a longer period. They typically occupy the same space, and are characterized by deeper partnerships and relationships that are gradually built over the course of the work’s existence. As a result, many long-term social practice projects include a pedagogical element in their work. Classes, urban regeneration work, schools, or institutional partnerships are all examples of longitudinal projects.

== Social practice and institutions ==
Much social practice has taken place in the gap between the public and cultural institutions, which has been identified and acted upon as a new site for artistic intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Living as Form, Socially Engaged Art from 1991-2011|last=Cruz|first=Teddy|publisher=Creative Time Books|year=2012|isbn=|editor-last=Thompson|editor-first=Nato|location=New York|pages=58|chapter=Democratizing Urbanization and the Search for a New Civic Imagination.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However institutions, such as museums, foundations, non-profit organizations, and universities all play a significant role in supporting and amplifying social practice work.  Many institutions constitute an extension of the public sphere, regardless of whether they are public or private in their ownership and operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=[[Maves]] Mark|first=[[Hodal]] [[Stephanie]]|date=1999|title=Museums and Livable Communities|url=|journal=The Journal of Museum Education|volume=24|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Partnerships between socially engaged art and contemporary institutions have thus widened the public sphere, and provided mutual benefits to the institution, the community, those engaged in the project, and the producers.

=== Social practice and the art market ===
In the traditional art world, market value and a work's collectability are deeply intertwined. This has posed a challenge to socially engaged artists seeking museum and gallery support, since many works go against the capitalist market to challenge traditional collecting practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Education for Socially Engaged Art|last=Helguera|first=Pablo|publisher=Jorge Pinto Books|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, many socially engaged artists and producers must look elsewhere for support. The expansion of the art world in the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century has seen the emergence of alternative supports, such as non-profit organizations and the ever-growing biennale network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The One and the Many: Contemporary Collaborative Art in a Global Context|last=Kester|first=Grant|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=Durham|pages=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other partners include art fairs, or commissions and residencies associated with universities, foundations, and urban regeneration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=What we Made: Conversations on art and social cooperation|last=Finkelpearl|first=Tom|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=Durham|pages=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Artists and producers have also formed their own means of support, as artist-run exhibition spaces, journals and blogs demonstrate.

=== Social practice in the university ===
Universities often partner with producers, artists and theorists of socially engaged art. These relationships offer mutual benefits for both academic institutions and artists. Universities offer artists employment security, the support and validation often required for establishing grant-based and corporate partnerships, and access to a high interdisciplinary environment that not only accepts, but encourages, experimentation. Artists in turn provide knowledge, skills and research to support individuals and broader programs within the university. As producers and scholars, they generate both new theory and new practice for the field of socially engaged art.

==Exhibitions and conferences==

Exhibitions of social practice art often include multiple artists or [[art collective]]s, and rather than exhibiting art objects, the artist’s participatory role in their work as well as their collaboration with the public becomes the exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/24/arts/design/outside-the-citadel-social-practice-art-is-intended-to-nurture.html&lt;/ref&gt; Several conferences are held nationally and internationally to bring together artists and academics involved in the field. They have featured [[installation art|installation]], [[performance art]], [[film]], [[dance]], art talks, forums, and gallery exhibitions.

[[File:E8Petrie.svg|right|thumb|The [[Root system of a semi-simple Lie algebra|root system]] of the exceptional [[Lie group]] [[E8 (mathematics)|E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]]. Lie groups have many symmetries.]]
'''[[Symmetry]]''' occurs not only in [[geometry]], but also in other branches of mathematics. Symmetry is a type of [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariance]]: the property that something does not change under a set of [[Transformation (mathematics)|transformation]]s.

Given a structured object ''X'' of any sort, a [[symmetry]] is a mapping of the object onto itself which preserves the structure. This occurs in many cases; for example, if ''X'' is a set with no additional structure, a symmetry is a [[bijection|bijective]] map from the set to itself, giving rise to [[permutation group]]s. If the object ''X'' is a set of points in the plane with its [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] structure or any other [[metric space]], a symmetry is a [[bijection]] of the set to itself which preserves the distance between each pair of points (an [[isometry]]).

In general, every kind of structure in mathematics will have its own kind of symmetry, many of which are listed in the given points mentioned above.

==Symmetry in geometry==
{{Main|Symmetry (geometry)}}
The types of symmetry considered in basic geometry (like reflection and rotation symmetry) are described more fully in the main article on [[symmetry (geometry)|symmetry]].

==Symmetry in calculus==

===Even and odd functions===
{{main|Even and odd functions}}

====Even functions====
[[Image:Function x^2.svg|right|thumb|{{nowrap|''&amp;fnof;''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} is an example of an even function.]]
Let ''f''(''x'') be a [[real number|real]]-valued function of a real variable. Then ''f'' is '''even''' if the following equation holds for all ''x'' and ''-x'' in the domain of ''f'':

:&lt;math&gt;
f(x) = f(-x). \,
&lt;/math&gt;

Geometrically speaking, the graph face of an even function is [[symmetry|symmetric]] with respect to the ''y''-axis, meaning that its [[graph of a function|graph]] remains unchanged after [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] about the ''y''-axis.

Examples of even functions are [[Absolute value|x]], ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''x''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, [[trigonometric function|cos]](''x''), and [[hyperbolic function|cosh]](''x'').

====Odd functions====
[[Image:Function-x3.svg|right|thumb|{{nowrap|''&amp;fnof;''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} is an example of an odd function.]]
Again, let ''f''(''x'') be a [[real number|real]]-valued function of a real variable. Then ''f'' is '''odd''' if the following equation holds for all ''x'' and ''-x'' in the domain of ''f'':

:&lt;math&gt;
-f(x) = f(-x) \, ,
&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;
f(x) + f(-x) = 0 \, .
&lt;/math&gt;

Geometrically, the graph of an odd function has rotational symmetry with respect to the [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]], meaning that its [[graph of a function|graph]] remains unchanged after [[coordinate rotation|rotation]] of 180 [[degree (angle)|degree]]s about the origin.

Examples of odd functions are ''x'', ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, [[sine|sin]](''x''), [[hyperbolic function|sinh]](''x''), and [[error function|erf]](''x'').

===Integrating===
The [[integral]] of an odd function from &amp;minus;''A'' to +''A'' is zero (where ''A'' is finite, and the function has no vertical asymptotes between &amp;minus;''A'' and ''A'').

The integral of an even function from &amp;minus;''A'' to +''A'' is twice the integral from 0 to +''A'' (where ''A'' is finite, and the function has no vertical asymptotes between &amp;minus;''A'' and ''A''.  This also holds true when ''A'' is infinite, but only if the integral converges).

===Series===
* The [[Maclaurin series]] of an even function includes only even powers.
* The Maclaurin series of an odd function includes only odd powers.
* The [[Fourier series]] of a [[periodic function|periodic]] even function includes only [[trigonometric function|cosine]] terms.
* The Fourier series of a periodic odd function includes only [[trigonometric function|sine]] terms.

==Symmetry in linear algebra==

===Symmetry in matrices===
In [[linear algebra]], a '''symmetric matrix''' is a [[square matrix]] that is equal to its [[transpose]]. Formally, matrix ''A'' is symmetric if

:&lt;math&gt;A = A^{\top}.&lt;/math&gt;

By the definition of matrix equality, which requires that the entries in all corresponding positions be equal, equal matrices must have the same dimensions (matrices of different sizes or shapes cannot be equal). Consequently, only square matrices can be symmetric.

The entries of a symmetric matrix are symmetric with respect to the [[main diagonal]]. So if the entries are written as ''A'' = (''a''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;), then ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; = a&lt;sub&gt;''ji''&lt;/sub&gt;, for all indices ''i'' and ''j''.

The following 3×3 matrix is symmetric:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 7 &amp; 3\\
7 &amp; 4 &amp; -5\\
3 &amp; -5 &amp; 6\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

Every square [[diagonal matrix]] is symmetric, since all off-diagonal entries are zero. Similarly, each diagonal element of a [[skew-symmetric matrix]] must be zero, since each is its own negative.

In linear algebra, a [[real number|real]] symmetric matrix represents a [[self-adjoint operator]] over a [[real number|real]] [[inner product space]]. The corresponding object for a [[complex number|complex]] inner product space is a [[Hermitian matrix]] with complex-valued entries, which is equal to its [[conjugate transpose]]. Therefore, in linear algebra over the complex numbers, it is often assumed that a symmetric matrix refers to one which has real-valued entries.  Symmetric matrices appear naturally in a variety of applications, and typical numerical linear algebra software makes special accommodations for them.

==Symmetry in abstract algebra==

===Symmetric groups===
{{Main|Symmetric group}}
The '''symmetric group''' ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; on a [[finite set]] of ''n'' symbols is the [[group (mathematics)|group]] whose elements are all the [[permutations]] of the ''n'' symbols, and whose [[group operation]] is the [[function composition|composition]] of such permutations, which are treated as [[bijection|bijective functions]] from the set of symbols to itself.&lt;ref name=Jacobson-def&gt;Jacobson (2009), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Since there are ''n''! (''n'' [[factorial]]) possible permutations of a set of ''n'' symbols, it follows that the [[Order (group theory)|order]] (the number of elements) of the symmetric group ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is ''n''!.

===Symmetric polynomials===
{{Main|Symmetric polynomial}}
A '''symmetric polynomial''' is a [[polynomial]] ''P''(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) in ''n'' variables, such that if any of the variables are interchanged, one obtains the same polynomial. Formally, ''P'' is a ''symmetric polynomial'', if for any [[permutation]] σ of the subscripts 1, 2, ..., ''n'' one has ''P''(''X''&lt;sub&gt;σ(1)&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;σ(2)&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;σ(''n'')&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''P''(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;).

Symmetric polynomials arise naturally in the study of the relation between the roots of a polynomial in one variable and its coefficients, since the coefficients can be given by polynomial expressions in the roots, and all roots play a similar role in this setting. From this point of view the [[elementary symmetric polynomial]]s are the most fundamental symmetric polynomials. A [[Elementary symmetric polynomial#The fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials|theorem]] states that any symmetric polynomial can be expressed in terms of elementary symmetric polynomials, which implies that every ''symmetric'' [[polynomial expression]] in the roots of a [[monic polynomial]] can alternatively be given as a polynomial expression in the coefficients of the polynomial.

====Examples====

In two variables ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; one has symmetric polynomials like
* &lt;math&gt;X_1^3+ X_2^3-7&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;4 X_1^2X_2^2 +X_1^3X_2 + X_1X_2^3 +(X_1+X_2)^4&lt;/math&gt;
and in three variables ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; one has for instance
* &lt;math&gt;X_1 X_2 X_3 - 2 X_1 X_2 - 2 X_1 X_3 - 2 X_2 X_3 \,&lt;/math&gt;

===Symmetric tensors===
{{Main|Symmetric tensor}}
In [[mathematics]], a '''symmetric tensor''' is [[tensor]] that is invariant under a [[permutation]] of its vector arguments:
:&lt;math&gt;T(v_1,v_2,\dots,v_r) = T(v_{\sigma 1},v_{\sigma 2},\dots,v_{\sigma r})&lt;/math&gt;
for every permutation &amp;sigma; of the symbols {1,2,...,''r''}.
Alternatively, an ''r''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; order symmetric tensor represented in coordinates as a quantity with ''r'' indices satisfies
:&lt;math&gt;T_{i_1i_2\dots i_r} = T_{i_{\sigma 1}i_{\sigma 2}\dots i_{\sigma r}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The space of symmetric tensors of rank ''r'' on a finite-dimensional [[vector space]] is [[natural isomorphism|naturally isomorphic]] to the dual of the space of [[homogeneous polynomial]]s of degree ''r'' on ''V''.  Over [[field (mathematics)|fields]] of [[characteristic zero]], the [[graded vector space]] of all symmetric tensors can be naturally identified with the [[symmetric algebra]] on ''V''. A related concept is that of the [[antisymmetric tensor]] or [[alternating form]]. Symmetric tensors occur widely in [[engineering]], [[physics]] and [[mathematics]].

===Galois theory===
{{Main|Galois theory}}
Given a polynomial, it may be that some of the roots are connected by various [[algebraic equation]]s. For example, it may be that for two of the roots, say ''A'' and ''B'', that {{nowrap|1=''A''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 5''B''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 7}}. The central idea of Galois theory is to consider those [[permutation]]s (or rearrangements) of the roots having the property that ''any'' algebraic equation satisfied by the roots is ''still satisfied'' after the roots have been permuted. An important proviso is that we restrict ourselves to algebraic equations whose coefficients are [[rational number]]s. Thus, Galois theory studies the symmetries inherent in algebraic equations.

===Automorphisms of algebraic objects===
{{Main|Automorphism}}
In [[abstract algebra]], an '''automorphism''' is an [[isomorphism]] from a [[mathematical object]] to itself. It is, in some sense, a [[symmetry]] of the object, and a way of [[map (mathematics)|mapping]] the object to itself while preserving all of its structure. The set of all automorphisms of an object forms a [[group (mathematics)|group]], called the '''automorphism group'''. It is, loosely speaking, the [[symmetry group]] of the object.

====Examples====

* In [[set theory]], an arbitrary [[permutation]] of the elements of a set ''X'' is an automorphism. The automorphism group of ''X'' is also called the [[symmetric group]] on ''X''.
* In [[elementary arithmetic]], the set of [[integer]]s, '''Z''', considered as a group under addition, has a unique nontrivial automorphism: negation. Considered as a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]], however, it has only the trivial automorphism. Generally speaking, negation is an automorphism of any [[abelian group]], but not of a ring or field.
* A group automorphism is a [[group isomorphism]] from a group to itself. Informally, it is a permutation of the group elements such that the structure remains unchanged. For every group ''G'' there is a natural group homomorphism ''G'' → Aut(''G'') whose [[image (mathematics)|image]] is the group Inn(''G'') of [[inner automorphism]]s and whose [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] is the [[center (group theory)|center]] of ''G''. Thus, if ''G'' has [[Trivial group|trivial]] center it can be embedded into its own automorphism group.&lt;ref name=Pahl&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[linear algebra]], an endomorphism of a [[vector space]] ''V'' is a [[linear transformation|linear operator]] ''V'' → ''V''. An automorphism is an invertible linear operator on ''V''. When the vector space is finite-dimensional, the automorphism group of ''V'' is the same as the [[general linear group]], GL(''V'').
* A field automorphism is a [[bijection|bijective]] [[ring homomorphism]] from a [[field (mathematics)|field]] to itself. In the cases of the [[rational number]]s ('''Q''') and the [[real number]]s ('''R''') there are no nontrivial field automorphisms. Some subfields of '''R''' have nontrivial field automorphisms, which however do not extend to all of '''R''' (because they cannot preserve the property of a number having a square root in '''R'''). In the case of the [[complex number]]s, '''C''', there is a unique nontrivial automorphism that sends '''R''' into '''R''': [[complex conjugate|complex conjugation]], but there are infinitely ([[uncountable|uncountably]]) many "wild" automorphisms (assuming the [[axiom of choice]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Yale | first = Paul B. | journal = Mathematics Magazine | title = Automorphisms of the Complex Numbers | volume = 39 | issue = 3 |date=May 1966 | pages = 135–141 | url = http://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/upload_library/22/Ford/PaulBYale.pdf | doi = 10.2307/2689301 | jstor = 2689301}}&lt;/ref&gt; Field automorphisms are important to the theory of [[field extension]]s, in particular [[Galois extension]]s. In the case of a Galois extension ''L''/''K'' the [[subgroup]] of all automorphisms of ''L'' fixing ''K'' pointwise is called the [[Galois group]] of the extension.

==Symmetry in representation theory==

===Symmetry in quantum mechanics: bosons and fermions===
In quantum mechanics, bosons have representatives that are symmetric under permutation operators, and fermions have antisymmetric representatives.

This implies the Pauli exclusion principle for fermions. In fact, the Pauli exclusion principle with a single-valued many-particle wavefunction is equivalent to requiring the wavefunction to be antisymmetric. An antisymmetric two-particle state is represented as a [[superposition principle|sum of states]] in which one particle is in state &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle |x \rangle&lt;/math&gt; and the other in state &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle |y\rangle&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
|\psi\rangle = \sum_{x,y} A(x,y) |x,y\rangle
&lt;/math&gt;

and antisymmetry under exchange means that {{nowrap|1=''A''(''x'',''y'') = −''A''(''y'',''x'')}}. This implies that {{nowrap|1=''A''(''x'',''x'') = 0}}, which is Pauli exclusion. It is true in any basis, since unitary changes of basis keep antisymmetric matrices antisymmetric, although strictly speaking, the quantity {{nowrap|1=''A''(''x'',''y'')}} is not a matrix but an antisymmetric rank-two [[tensor]].

Conversely, if the diagonal quantities {{nowrap|1=''A''(''x'',''x'')}} are zero ''in every basis'', then the wavefunction component:
:&lt;math&gt;
A(x,y)=\langle \psi|x,y\rangle = \langle \psi | ( |x\rangle \otimes |y\rangle )
&lt;/math&gt;

is necessarily antisymmetric. To prove it, consider the matrix element:
:&lt;math&gt;
\langle\psi| ((|x\rangle + |y\rangle)\otimes(|x\rangle + |y\rangle))
\,&lt;/math&gt;

This is zero, because the two particles have zero probability to both be in the superposition state &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle |x\rangle + |y\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. But this is equal to
:&lt;math&gt;
\langle \psi |x,x\rangle + \langle \psi |x,y\rangle + \langle \psi |y,x\rangle + \langle \psi | y,y \rangle
\,&lt;/math&gt;

The first and last terms on the right hand side are diagonal elements and are zero, and the whole sum is equal to zero. So the wavefunction matrix elements obey:

:&lt;math&gt;
\langle \psi|x,y\rangle + \langle\psi |y,x\rangle = 0
\,&lt;/math&gt;.

or
:&lt;math&gt;
A(x,y)=-A(y,x)
\,&lt;/math&gt;

==Symmetry in set theory==

===Symmetric relation===
{{Main|Symmetric relation}}

We call a relation symmetric if every time the relation stands from A to B, it stands too from B to A.
Note that symmetry is not the exact opposite of [[Antisymmetric relation|antisymmetry]].

==Symmetry in metric spaces==

===Isometries of a space===
{{Main|Isometry}}
An '''isometry''' is a [[distance]]-preserving map between [[metric spaces]]. Given a metric space, or a set and scheme for assigning distances between elements of the set, an isometry is a transformation which maps elements to another metric space such that the distance between the elements in the new metric space is equal to the distance between the elements in the original metric space. In&amp;nbsp;a two-dimensional or three-dimensional space, two&amp;nbsp;geometric figures are [[Congruence (geometry)|congruent]] if&amp;nbsp;they are related by&amp;nbsp;an&amp;nbsp;isometry:&amp;nbsp;related by either a&amp;nbsp;[[Rigid body|rigid&amp;nbsp;motion]], or&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;[[Function composition|composition]] of a rigid motion and&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;[[Reflection (mathematics)|reflection]]. Up&amp;nbsp;to a&amp;nbsp;relation by a&amp;nbsp;rigid&amp;nbsp;motion, they&amp;nbsp;are equal if&amp;nbsp;related by a [[Euclidean group#Direct and indirect isometries|direct&amp;nbsp;isometry]].

Isometries have been used to unify the working definition of symmetry in geometry and for functions, probability distributions, matrices, strings, graphs, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Petitjean | first = Michel | journal = Symmetry: Culture and Science | title = A definition of symmetry | volume = 18 | issue = 2–3 | date = 2007 | pages = 99–119 | zbl = 1274.58003 | url = https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01552499 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symmetries of differential equations ==

A symmetry of a [[differential equation]] is a transformation that leaves the differential equation invariant. Knowledge of such symmetries may help solve the differential equation.

A [[Line symmetry]] of a [[system of differential equations]] is a continuous symmetry of the system of differential equations. Knowledge of a Line symmetry can be used to simplify an ordinary differential equation through [[reduction of order]].&lt;ref name=olver&gt;
{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[ordinary differential equations]], knowledge of an appropriate set of Lie symmetries allows one to explicitly calculate a set of first integrals, yielding a complete solution without integration.

Symmetries may be found by solving a related set of ordinary differential equations.&lt;ref name=olver /&gt; Solving these equations is often much simpler than solving the original differential equations.

==Symmetry in probability==
In the case of a finite number of possible outcomes, symmetry with respect to permutations (relabelings) implies a [[Uniform distribution (discrete)|discrete uniform distribution]].

In the case of a real interval of possible outcomes, symmetry with respect to interchanging sub-intervals of equal length corresponds to a [[Uniform distribution (continuous)|continuous uniform distribution]].

In other cases, such as "taking a random integer" or "taking a random real number", there are no probability distributions at all symmetric with respect to relabellings or to exchange of equally long subintervals. Other reasonable symmetries do not single out one particular distribution, or in other words, there is not a unique probability distribution providing maximum symmetry.

There is one type of [[Symmetry groups in one dimension|isometry in one dimension]] that may leave the probability distribution unchanged, that is reflection in a point, for example zero.

A possible symmetry for randomness with positive outcomes is that the former applies for the logarithm, i.e., the outcome and its reciprocal have the same distribution. However this symmetry does not single out any particular distribution uniquely.

For a "random point" in a plane or in space, one can choose an origin, and consider a probability distribution with circular or spherical symmetry, respectively.

'''''The Accused''''' is a 1988 American [[legal drama|legal drama film]] directed by [[Jonathan Kaplan]], written by [[Tom Topor]] and starring [[Jodie Foster]], [[Kelly McGillis]], [[Bernie Coulson]], [[Leo Rossi]], [[Ann Hearn]], [[Carmen Argenziano]], [[Steve Antin]] and  [[Tom O'Brien (actor)|Tom O'Brien]]. In the film Sarah Tobias, a young waitress, is gang-raped by three men at a local bar; she and [[district attorney]] Kathryn Murphy set out to prosecute the rapists as well as the men who encouraged them.

Set in [[Washington state]], but filmed in [[Vancouver]], [[Canada]], it is loosely based on the [[Cheryl Araujo|1983 gang rape of Cheryl Araujo in New Bedford, Massachusetts]], and the resulting trial, which received national coverage. The film explores the themes of [[classism]], [[misogyny]], [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)]], [[slut shaming]], [[victim blaming]] and [[women's empowerment]].

''The Accused'' premiered at the [[39th Berlin International Film Festival]], where it competed for the [[Golden Bear]]. It was released in [[limited release|limited theatres]] on October 14, 1988 by  [[Paramount Pictures]] and was highly controversial upon release, mostly due to its graphic representation of [[gang rape]]. The film became a critical and commercial success grossing over $37 million worldwide, against its $6 million budget. Major praise was drawn towards Foster's performance, marking her breakthrough to adult roles and brought her numerous accolades including the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]].

==Plot==
On April 18, 1987, at a local bar called "The Mill", 24-years old working-class woman Sarah Tobias ([[Jodie Foster]]) is [[gang rape]]d by several drunk bar patrons, while onlookers cheer them on. Assistant [[district attorney]] Kathryn Murphy ([[Kelly McGillis]]) is assigned to the rape case.  Her superior instructs Murphy to offer a [[plea bargain]] with the rape defendants that requires some jail time. They make a plea bargain to charges of reckless endangerment, and are sentenced to prison. Sarah is enraged by the deal, as there is no acknowledgment on the record that the men raped her.

Sarah rams a [[pickup truck]] after recognizing its driver as one of the patrons from the bar who had been cheering during the rape, and being outraged by his crude proposition of her. Her injuries require hospitalization. After this, Murphy decides to prosecute the men who cheered the rape for criminal [[solicitation]]. Sarah's friend Sally, a [[Waiting staff|waitress]] at the bar where the rape took place, picks three men out of a line-up as those who encouraged the attackers. They get three different defense attorneys for the ensuing trial.

Sarah testifies that she was raped. College student Kenneth Joyce ([[Bernie Coulson]]), a friend of one of the rapists, testifies to watching the rape before he made a [[911 (emergency telephone number)|911]] call to notify police. After Murphy's closing statement and a single [[closing argument|summation]] from the three defense lawyers, the jury deliberates for a long time. They ask several times for Joyce's testimony to be reread to them.

In the end, the jury convicts the three defendants. As the trial provides testimony and evidence that the men raped Sarah, the three men already serving prison time for reckless [[endangerment]] are unlikely to be granted parole.

==Production==
===Development===
Screenwriter [[Tom Topor]] was inspired to write the film after the real trial of [[Cheryl Araujo]] became national news.&lt;ref name="Ford"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ford|first=Rebecca|title='The Accused' Oral History: A Brutal Rape Scene, Traumatized Actors and Producers' Fights to Make the Movie|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/accused-oral-history-a-brutal-rape-scene-traumatized-actors-producers-fights-make-movie-952|accessdate=December 5, 2016|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=January 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dawn Steel]] called him to ask if he'd be interested in doing a movie on the subject and following which [[Sherry Lansing]] and [[Stanley Jaffe]] from [[Paramount Pictures]], where signed on to produce the film. Topor interviewed 30 rape victims and numerous rapists, prosecutors, defense attorneys and scrub nurses.&lt;ref name="Ford"/&gt; [[Jonathan Kaplan]] met Steel following the dawn of Araujo's trail and discussed the possibility of having a film on the subject. The original draft of the script focused on the lawyer's story while the rape victim was just that — a victim, a prop. Kaplan wanted the rape victim character to be front and center with the lawyer, while the script also had the pool table (similar from the real life incident), but the producers were concerned of being sued, so it was changed to a pinball machine. 
{{quote box|bgcolor=#CCDDFF|align=right|width=25em|quote="Jonathan and I looked at a lot of old films, and we couldn't find one that had explored the subject. There were almost no movies where the subject of the movie is rape. There are many movies that have a rape incident in them, but ''The Accused'' is about rape, there's no other subject. And it's about two women; there's no man who comes to rescue them. It's a very tough subject."|source=—Topor explaining the importance to make the film&lt;ref name="Ford"/&gt;}}
Following the test screenings, the film received lowest scores in the history of Paramount. According to Lansing, "The audience thought that Jodie's character deserved the rape."&lt;ref name="Ford"/&gt; The studio executives wanted to put the film on the shelf and were looking for ways to not get it released. Lansing asked for another screening with just women. She got that screening, and it went through the roof. Of the 20 women in the room, 18 had experience with rape — that either they or someone they knew had been raped. When tested again months later, it got among the highest scores in studio's history.&lt;ref name="Ford"/&gt;

===Casting===
The casting process of the film was extremely muddling. The studio was looking for a banakable actress who could sell the film. Numerous actresses were considered for the part of [[Sarah Tobias]], including; [[Valerie Bertinelli]], [[Jennifer Grey]], [[Meg Ryan]], [[Mia Sara]], [[Annabeth Gish]], [[Joan Cusack]], [[Jennifer Beals]], [[Alyssa Milano]], [[Uma Thurman]], [[Ally Sheedy]] and [[Kelly Preston]] but all of them rejected it due to the film's gruesome and controversial themes. Foster, who had recently graduated from [[Yale]] and didn't make any successful film during her time at school, wasn't the fruitful choice for the producers. Following numerous auditions as well as rejection from various established actresses, she was finally cast in the part.
[[Jane Fonda]] was initially attached to play Kathryn Murphy but left the project as she found the script exploitative and poorly written. [[Ellen Barkin]], [[Michelle Pfeiffer]], [[Sigourney Weaver]], [[Debra Winger]], [[Meryl Streep]] and [[Geena Davis]] were also considered for the part. [[Kelly McGillis]], who just came off ''[[Top Gun]]'' (1987) was cast for the bankable prospects of the film.&lt;ref name="Ford"/&gt; McGillis was initially offered to play Sarah but declined, citing her personal experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20100476,00.html|title=Memoir of a Brief Time in Hell|author=Kelly McGillis, as told to Kristin McMurran|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=14 November 1988|accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
She acknowledged at the time of film's release that she had survived an attack and rape, in 1982. Based on her experience, she took on the role of Murphy. [[Brad Pitt]] auditioned for the part of Ken Joyce.

Foster viewed the film as a last ditch effort to give her acting career a much needed boost. She had taken a sabbatical from Hollywood to attend Yale, which was prolonged due to [[John Hinckley]]'s assassination attempt on President [[Ronald Reagan]] (which he carried out as a means to impress Foster with whom he had obsessed after seeing her in ''[[Taxi Driver]]'') in March 1981. After recovering from the media frenzy surrounding her following the incident, she had experienced a bit of a dry spell upon her return to acting. Most of her films had a lukewarm response both with critics and at the box office. She stated that she would have retired from acting had ''The Accused'' followed suit. Ultimately, the film's success revitalised her career.

===Filming===
Principal photography for ''The Accused'' began on April 22, 1987 and concluded on June 2, 1987. Although set in [[Washington (state)|Washington state]], it was filmed in [[Vancouver, Canada]]. The gang rape scene was highly controversial at the time of its release, as being the longest, most graphic and boldest representation of the assault in cinematic history. It took five days to complete and the filming was a difficult experience for the cast and crew involved. Everyone felt protective of Foster and worried how traumatic the situation could be for her. In an interview, Foster explained that the rape scene was meticulously rehearsed beforehand, so there would be no unpleasant surprises for anyone involved in the actual scene. She herself has admitted that she does not remember filming the scene and completely blacked-out and broke blood vessels in her right eye from crying during shooting of the scene. Contrarily, the male actors were overwhelmingly upset.&lt;ref name="NYT 1991"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/06/magazine/child-of-the-movies.html|title=Child of the Movies|date=January 6, 1991|work=The New York Times|first=Jonathan|last=van Meter|accessdate=February 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hollinger 2012, p. 46"&gt;Hollinger 2012, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leo Rossi]] (who played Cliff "Scorpion" Albrect, the by-stander), recalled the experience of [[Woody Brown (actor)|Woody Brown]] (who played Danny, one of the rapists), following the filming of the scene, being bolted and throwing up in his trailer.&lt;ref name="Ford"/&gt; ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'' ranked the rape scene from the film #16 on its list of "The 53 Most Hard-To-Watch Scenes in Movie History".&lt;ref name="Esquire"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/most-hard-to-watch-scenes-in-movie-history/|title=The 53 Most Hard-To-Watch Scenes in Movie History|work=[[complex.com]]|last=Borone|first=Matt|date=March 16, 2018|accessdate=July 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
''The Accused'' was released in [[limited release|limited theatres]] in [[North America]] on October 14, 1988. Although it was supposed to be released in April, it was deferred to October due to [[1988 Writers Guild of America strike|Writers Guild of America's strike]]. The film premiered at the [[39th Berlin International Film Festival]] in 1989, where it competed for the [[Golden Bear]] .&lt;ref name="Berlinale"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1989/02_programm_1989/02_Programm_1989.html |title=Berlinale: 1989 Programme |accessdate=2011-03-09 |work=berlinale.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Box Office===
In its opening weekend in [[North America]], ''The Accused'' was #1 at the box office, grossing $4.3 million in 796 theaters. The film grossed a total of $37.07 million worldwide, against a $6 million budget becoming a major commercial success.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=accused.htm "The Accused (1988)"].

===Critical Response===

[[File:Jodie Foster (1989).jpg|thumb|upright|Jodie Foster's performance as Sarah Tobias garnered widespread critical acclaim thus, marking her breakthrough into adult roles and earned her an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]].]]
''The Accused'' received positive reviews from critics upon release with major acclaim drawn towards Foster's performance.
The [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film an approval rating of 95% based on 20 reviews, with an average rating of 8.1/10. The website's critical consensus reads : "Simultaneously gut-wrenching and provocative, ''The Accused'' provides with a harrowing and haunting rape drama, layered by an outstanding performance by Jodie Foster".&lt;ref name=rotten&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1000224_accused|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |title=The Accused|accessdate=May 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has an [[average score]]  of 65 out of 100 indicating "generally favourable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-accused|title=''The Accused'' Reviews |publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=September 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a positive review, writing of the two criminal prosecutions in the film, [[Roger Ebert]] finds that the lesson of the trial "may be the most important message this movie has to offer...that verbal sexual harassment, whether crudely in a saloon back room or subtly in an everyday situation, is a form of violence - one that leaves no visible marks but can make its victims feel unable to move freely and casually in society. It is a form of imprisonment."&lt;ref&gt;Roger Ebert (October 14, 1988). [http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19881014/REVIEWS/810140301/1023 "The Accused"], ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Rob Beattie from ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'', gave the film five out of five stars, calling it phenomenal and called the controversial rape scene "devastating, harrowing and utterly convincing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Beattie|first=Rob|title=The Accused Review|url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/accused/review/|accessdate=May 25, 2017|website=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]|date=October 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judy Steed from ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' said about the film; "An experience that is sometimes unbearable and always riveting". [[Vincent Canby]] from ''[[The New York Times|The New York Times]]'' said: "A consistently engrossing melodrama, modest in its aims and as effective for the cliches it avoids as for the clear eye through which it sees its working-class American lives".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Canby|first=Vincent|title=The Accused Review|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/14/movies/review-film-silence-crime-and-complicity.html|accessdate=May 25, 2017|website=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 14, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marjorie Heins, in the 1998 book ''The V-Chip Debate: Content Filtering from Television to the Internet'', said that educators worried that the film would "receive V ratings and be subject to at least a presumption against curricular use in many public schools."&lt;ref&gt;Marjorie Heins, "Three Questions About Television Ratings," in ''The V-Chip Debate: Content Filtering from Television to the Internet'', ed.

'''Emotionalists''' is a group of artists founded as an artistic movement
in 1994
&lt;ref&gt;[http://newyork.mfa.gov.pl/en/c/MOBILE/news/the_emotionalists___20_years_/ Consulate General of the Republic of Poland]&lt;/ref&gt; by sculptor, painter and
designer of the Polish School of Industrial Design, and professor
[[emeritus]] at [[University of Bridgeport]], [[Lubomir Tomaszewski]].
The group has as its mission the return to the natural language of
expression in art and seeks to awaken deep emotions in the viewer and
communicate: “Less show, more content”. The philosophy of this movement
is also a reaction to the "over-intellectualized" modern art and its loss
of emotion and mood, which its considers one of the most important factors
for the artist as well as the viewer. Because of this, the artist looks to
tradition and "lasting values" in art, vehemently condemning
experimentation and simplification or geometrization for the sole purpose
of surprising or shocking the viewer.  The spectrum of the works is broad,
ranging from figurative to
conceptual.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ny.pl/index.php?o=kd/showmore/3046/ New York pl]&lt;/ref&gt; It's a multi-disciplinary group, associating painters,
sculptors, illustrators, photographers, graphic artists, textile designers,
dancers, and musicians

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3267">"'''The Oldest Systematic Program of German Idealism'''" ({{lang-de|Das älteste Systemprogramm des deutschen Idealismus}}) is a 1796/97 essay of [[Anonymous work|unknown authorship]]. The document was first published (in German) by [[Franz Rosenzweig]] in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Richards, ''The Romantic Conception of Life: Science and Philosophy in the Age of Goethe'', University of Chicago Press, 2002, p. 124 n. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authorship==
Although the document is in [[G. W. F. Hegel]]'s handwriting, it is thought it has been written by either Hegel, [[F. W. J. Schelling]], [[Friedrich Hölderlin]], or an unknown fourth person.&lt;ref name="Hammermeister"&gt;Kai Hammermeister, ''The German Aesthetic Tradition'', Cambridge University Press, 2002, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yves Bonnefoy]] writes that it was "certainly inspired by Hölderlin."&lt;ref&gt;Yves Bonnefoy, "Fable and Mythology in Seventeenth- and Eighteenth-Century Literature and Theoretical Reflection" in ''Roman and European Mythologies'' edited by [[Wendy Doniger]], University of Chicago Press, 1992, p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Glenn Magee, most Hegel scholars assume that Hegel is the author of the document.&lt;ref name="magee"&gt;Glenn Magee, ''Hegel and the Hermetic Tradition'', Cornell University Press, 2001, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schelling, Hegel, and Hölderlin were classmates and roommates at Tübinger Stift, the seminary of the [[University of Tübingen]] at the time, and are collectively known as the "Tübingen Three". Hegel and Hölderlin were 27, and Schelling was 22.

==Content==
Raffaele Milani writes that in the essay, "...the idea of Beauty unifies all others in a fusion of the self and nature."&lt;ref&gt;Raffaele Milani, ''Art of the Landscape'', McGill-Queen's University Press, 2009, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dieter Henrich]] called the document a "program for agitation." It called for a new mythology to mediate between the present state and the future envisioned poeticized state, in which poetry will function for the arts and sciences, including philosophy.&lt;ref name="Hammermeister"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Jason Josephson-Storm has interpreted the essay as a source on Hegel's view of [[myth]], especially Hegel's perception (in line with other eighteenth- and nineteenth-century German philosophers) that myth has disappeared and left a cultural vacuum, which Josephson-Storm argues anticipates the idea of [[disenchantment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |page = 63-4 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 0-226-40336-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16474">{{DISPLAYTITLE:''The Perfect Moment''}}
'''''The Perfect Moment''''' was the most comprehensive retrospective of works by New York photographer [[Robert Mapplethorpe]]. The show spanned twenty-five years of his career, featuring [[celebrity portrait]]s, [[self-portrait]]s, [[interracial]] figure studies, floral still lifes, [[homoerotic]] images, and collages. The exhibition, organized by [[Janet Kardon]] of the [[Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia|Institute of Contemporary Arts in Philadelphia]], opened in the winter of 1988 just months before Mapplethorpe’s death from [[AIDS]] complications on March 9, 1989.  On tour, in the summer of 1989, the exhibition became the centerpiece of a controversy concerning federal funding of the arts and censorship.

== Exhibition ==
=== Background ===
''The Perfect Moment'' covered all aspects of the photographer’s career from the late 1960s to 1988. The traveling exhibition had been scheduled to appear at five other museums in various regions of the country during the next year and a half. It included more than 150 images. Despite the controversial character of some of the [[photograph]]s, critical response was enthusiastic and attendance was robust throughout the show's [[Philadelphia]] run (from December 1988 through January 1989).

''The Perfect Moment'' traveled to the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago|Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago]]. Again, it generated no unfavorable public or critical attention. In June 1989, after the cancellation of the exhibition by the [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington D.C.]], two and a half weeks before it was to open there, ''The Perfect Moment'' unexpectedly provoked national controversy and ICA became a key player in the congressional debate over what public funds should and should not fund. The issues of censorship and artistic freedom that the show raised occupied the forefront of the debates between conservatives and liberals during the [[Ronald Reagan]] era and in its aftermath. Members of the religious right, especially, criticized academics and artists for what they regarded as their indecent, subversive and blasphemous works. 

=== Layout and works displayed ===
''The Perfect Moment'' grouped photos into three categories: 
*Rigorously conceived portraits and figure studies;
*Dramatically lit flower arrangements in color, and in black and white;
*Photographs of gay [[sadomasochism]] (S&amp;M) that left nothing to the imagination.

Robert Mapplethorpe’s XYZ portfolios, explored three subjects: homosexual [[sadomasochism]] (X); flower still lifes (Y); and nude portraits of [[African American]] men (Z). The extremely graphic S&amp;M photos from Mapplethorpe’s X Portfolio were displayed in a separate, age-restricted area during at each venue of the exhibition. The portfolios were displayed with a series of poems by poet and singer [[Patti Smith]]. The poems echo Mapplethorpe's X,Y,Z trope.

{{quote|“Y is the symbol of the covenant which exists between the artist and his creator/ Y is the consummation of this idea thru the projection of the perfect shot. ”Please use the poetry as sandwich quotes; I want them to be obvious.” (Patti Smith)}}

The images that sparked the most controversy include:
*Jim and Tom, Sausalito, 1977
*Man in a Polyester Suit, 1980
*Jesse McBride, 1976
*Rosie (Honey), 1976
 
Rosie, a black and white portrait of a very young girl crouched down on a bench outdoors with part of her dress lifted, exposing her genitals, generated controversy because of the subject's age and the issue of consent. This photograph was deemed [[child pornography]] by Mapplethorpe's detractors, and it is surprising that it was featured in the exhibition catalogue, considering that the printer had refused to print it for the Mapplethorpe retrospective at the [[Whitney Museum of Art]] in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Danto|first1=Arthur|title=Playing with the Edge: The Photographic Achievement of Robert Mapplethorpe|date=1996|publisher=Berkeley: University of California Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was one other photograph of a naked child, "Jessie McBride" which also contributed to the controversy created by "Rosie". 
 
A 55-minute videotape of a [[BBC]] interview with the photographer accompanied the exhibition.

== Reception ==
The art critics in Philadelphia, the show's first venue, critiqued Mapplethorpe's work along formalist lines, without commenting on the provocative content of the X portfolio photographs. Overall, the exhibition was met enthusiastically by critics both Philadelphia and in Chicago, where the show appeared at the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago|Museum of Contemporary Art]].

However, a campaign launched by the [[American Family Association]], a conservative watchdog group, to censor what they considered “indecent” art changed the climate of reception. In June 12, 1989 [[Christina Orr-Cahall]], the director of the [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]], cancelled “The Perfect Moment,” which was scheduled to open there on June 30. Orr-Cahall feared that ''The Perfect Moment'' would endanger [[National Endowment for the Arts]] (NEA) appropriations in the [[United States Congress]].

The exhibition set off one of the fiercest episodes of America's "[[culture war]]s" —  and sparked a recurring debate about state-funded cultural production and the support of [[sexually explicit]] or [[sacrilegious]] art by public funds.

=== Debate about National Endowment for the Arts ===
The canceling of the ''Perfect Moment'' provoked a [[censorship]] battle about national funding for the arts that was front page news for the next year.

On June 30, 1989, protesters angered by the cancellation of the show by the Corcoran Gallery projected slides of Mapplethorpe’s photographs on the facade of the museum. Seven hundred people rallied to express their outrage about the Corcoran's decision. [[Michael Brenson]], art critic for the ''[[New York Times]]'' wrote, “This exhibit should be seen. It is extremely unfortunate that the Corcoran Gallery of Art canceled it last month in the hope of averting a political outcry…. As much as he has been made out to be a renegade and outlaw, Mapplethorpe is an utterly mainstream artist. He loved freshness and glamor and was obsessed with the moment, which his photographs always reflect. In his restricted spaces and his feeling for abstraction and attentiveness to every shape, edge and texture, Mapplethorpe is a child of the Formalism of the 1960’s."&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brenson|first1=Michael|title=The Many Roles of Mapplethorpe, Acted out in Ever Shifting Images,|date=July 22, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Washington Project for the Arts (WPA) stepped in to host the show, and on July 22, 1989, “The Perfect Moment” opened at this alternative art space. No incidents marred the show's run at the Washington Project for the Arts.

However, Senator [[Jesse Helms]] introduced legislation that would stop the NEA from funding artwork he considered “obscene.” The legislation subsequently required any recipients of NEA funds to sign an oath that declared they would not promote obscenity. The oath provoked protests from artists and arts organizations. When, during the next grant cycle, in this climate of fear, applications for support equaling hundreds of thousands of dollars were rejected. Outraged artists filed lawsuits against the agency. A compromise was reached in Congress. Although the radically restrictive Helms amendment did not pass, restrictions were placed on NEA funding procedures.

=== Censorship ===
In March 1990, anti-pornography advocates in [[Cincinnati Ohio]], the [[Citizens for Community Values]], launched a campaign to pressure the [[Contemporary Arts Center]] (CAC) to cancel “The Perfect Moment.” Cincinnati law enforcement ordered four hundred visitors from the museum to leave while they videotaped Mapplethorpe’s photographs as evidence to support obscenity charges brought against [[Dennis Barrie]], the director of the CAC, and against the CAC. This was the first time a museum in the [[United States]] faced prosecution for the art it displayed.

On October 5, 1990, Dennis Barrie and the CAC were acquitted in the [[obscenity]] case. The prosecution failed to convince the jury that Mapplethorpe’s photographs lacked [[artistic merit]]. In Cincinnati, more than 80,000 people saw the show. The censorship proceedings doubtless brought more attention to Mapplethorpe's work than it would have otherwise received.

=== Legacy ===
Since the CAC debacle, images from ''The Perfect Moment'', including the X, Y, and Z portfolios, have circulated to in hundreds of exhibitions internationally. Mapplethorpe's work is currently represented by 12 galleries worldwide, with the largest collection of his works at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]]. These photographs and history of their attempted censorship during the 1990s have influenced artists, inspired [[LGBTQ]] advocates, and generated much scholarship.

[[Image:Chaucer Troilus frontispiece.jpg|thumb|Chaucer reciting ''Troylus and Criseyde'': early 15th-century manuscript of the work at [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]]]]
'''''Troilus and Criseyde''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|r|ɔɪ|l|ə|s|...|ˈ|k|r|ɛ|s|ᵻ|d|ə}}) is an [[epic poem]] by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] which re-tells in [[Middle English]] the tragic story of the lovers [[Troilus]] and [[Cressida|Criseyde]] set against a backdrop of war during the [[Siege of Troy]]. It was composed using ''[[rhyme royal|rime royale]]'' and probably completed during the mid 1380s. Many Chaucer scholars regard it as the poet's finest work. As a finished [[long poem]] it is more self-contained than the better known but ultimately unfinished ''[[Canterbury Tales]].'' This poem is often considered the source of the phrase: "all good things must come to an end" (3.615).

Although Troilus is a character from [[Ancient Greek literature]], the expanded story of him as a lover was of Medieval origin. The first known version is from [[Benoît de Sainte-Maure]]'s poem ''[[Roman de Troie]]'', but Chaucer's principal source appears to have been [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]] who re-wrote the tale in his ''[[Il Filostrato]]''. Chaucer attributes the story to a "Lollius" (whom he also mentions in ''[[The House of Fame]]''), although no writer with this name is known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hornstein |first=Lillian Herlands |date=1948 |title=Petrarch's Laelius, Chaucer's Lollius? |jstor=459407 |journal=Publications of the Modern Language Association of America |publisher=[[Modern Language Association]] |volume=63 |issue=1 |pages=64–84 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chaucer's version can be said to reflect a less cynical and less [[misogynist]]ic world-view than [[Boccaccio]]'s, casting Criseyde as fearful and sincere rather than simply fickle and having been led astray by the eloquent and perfidious [[Pandarus]]. It also inflects the sorrow of the story with humour.

The poem had an important legacy for later writers. [[Robert Henryson]]'s Scots poem ''[[The Testament of Cresseid]]'' imagined a tragic fate for Criseyde not given by Chaucer. In historical editions of the English ''Troilus and Criseyde'', Henryson's distinct and separate work was sometimes included without accreditation as an "epilogue" to Chaucer's tale. Other texts, for example John Metham's ''[[Amoryus and Cleopes]]'' (c. 1449), adapt language and authorship strategies from the famous predecessor poem.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Utz, "Writing Alternative Worlds: Rituals of Authorship and Authority in Late Medieval Theological and Literary Discourse." In: ''Creations: Medieval Rituals, the Arts, and the Concept of Creation''. Ed. Sven Rune Havsteen, Nils Holger Petersen, Heinrich W. Schwab, and Eyolf Østrem. Turnhout: Brepols, 2007, pp. 121–38.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shakespeare]]'s tragedy ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'', although much blacker in tone, was also based in part on the material.

''Troilus and Criseyde'' is usually considered to be a [[courtly romance]], although the generic classification is an area of significant debate in most [[Middle English]] literature. It is part of the [[Matter of Rome]] cycle, a fact which Chaucer emphasizes.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. S. Lewis]], ''Selected Literary Essays'', pp. 30–31, Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Antenor (mythology)|Antenor]], a soldier held captive by the Greeks, traded for Criseyde's safety, eventually betrays Troy
*[[Calchas]], a Trojan prophet who joins the Greeks

==Synopsis==
Calchas, a soothsayer, foresees the fall of Troy and abandons the city in favour of the Greeks; his daughter, Criseyde, receives some ill will on account of her father's betrayal. Troilus, a warrior of Troy, publicly mocks love and is punished by the God of Love by being struck with irreconcilable desire for Criseyde, whom he sees passing through the temple. With the help of sly Pandarus, Criseyde's uncle, Troilus and Criseyde begin to exchange letters. Eventually, Pandarus develops a plan to urge the two into bed together; Troilus swoons when he thinks the plan is going amiss, but Pandarus and Criseyde revive him. Pandarus leaves, and Troilus and Criseyde spend a night of bliss together. Calchas eventually persuades the Greeks to exchange a prisoner of war, Antenor, for his daughter Criseyde. Hector, of Troy, objects; as does Troilus, although he does not voice his concern. Troilus speaks to Criseyde and suggests they elope but she offers a logical argument as to why it would not be practical. Criseyde promises to deceive her father and return to Troy after ten days; Troilus leaves her with a sense of foreboding. Upon arriving in the Greek camp, Criseyde realizes the unlikeliness of her being able to keep her promise to Troilus. She writes dismissively in response to his letters and on the tenth day accepts a meeting with Diomede, and listens to him speak of love. Later, she accepts him as a lover. Pandarus and Troilus wait for Criseyde: Pandarus sees that she will not return and eventually Troilus realizes this as well. Troilus curses Fortune, even more so because he still loves Criseyde; Pandarus offers some condolences. The narrator, with an apology for giving women a bad name, bids farewell to his book, and briefly recounts Troilus's death in battle and his ascent to the eighth sphere, draws a moral about the transience of earthly joys and the inadequacy of paganism, dedicates his poem to Gower and Strode, asks the protection of the Trinity, and prays that we be worthy of Christ's mercy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://karolus.net/tranal.html ''Scene outline of Chaucer's Troilus'', by Donald R.

Sometimes the narrator's unreliability is made immediately evident. For instance, a story may open with the narrator making a plainly false or delusional claim or admitting to being severely mentally ill, or the story itself may have a [[frame story|frame]] in which the narrator appears as a character, with clues to the character's unreliability. A more dramatic use of the device delays the revelation until near the story's end. In some cases, the reader discovers that in the foregoing narrative, the narrator had concealed or greatly misrepresented vital pieces of information. Such a [[twist ending]] forces readers to reconsider their [[point of view (literature)|point of view]] and experience of the story. In some cases the narrator's unreliability is never fully revealed but only hinted at, leaving readers to wonder how much the narrator should be trusted and how the story should be interpreted.

==Overview==

===Classification===
Attempts have been made at a classification of unreliable narrators. William Riggan analysed in a 1981 study discernible types of unreliable narrators, focusing on the first-person narrator as this is the most common kind of unreliable narration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Riggan |first=William |title=Pícaros, Madmen, Naīfs, and Clowns: The Unreliable First-person Narrator |year=1981 |publisher=Univ. of Oklahoma Press: Norman |isbn=0806117141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adapted from his findings is the following list:

;The Pícaro: a narrator who is characterized by exaggeration and bragging, the first example probably being the soldier in [[Plautus]]'s comedy ''[[Miles Gloriosus (play)|Miles Gloriosus]]''. Examples in modern literature are ''[[Moll Flanders]]'', ''[[Simplicius Simplicissimus]]'' or ''[[Felix Krull]]''.
;The Madman: a narrator who is either only experiencing mental [[defense mechanism]]s, such as (post-traumatic) [[Dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]] and [[depersonalization|self-alienation]], or severe mental illness, such as schizophrenia or paranoia. Examples include [[Franz Kafka]]'s self-alienating narrators, [[noir fiction]] and [[hardboiled]] fiction's "tough" (cynical) narrator who unreliably describes his own emotions, Barbara Covett in ''[[Notes on a Scandal]]'', Charles Kinbote in ''[[Pale Fire]]'', and [[Patrick Bateman]] in ''[[American Psycho]]''.
;The Clown: a narrator who does not take narrations seriously and consciously plays with conventions, truth, and the reader's expectations. Examples of the type include [[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman|Tristram Shandy]] and [[The Posthumous Memoirs of Bras Cubas|Bras Cubas]].
;The Naïf: a narrator whose perception is immature or limited through their point of view. Examples of naïves include [[Huckleberry Finn]], [[Holden Caulfield]] and [[Forrest Gump (character)|Forrest Gump]].
;The Liar: a mature narrator of sound cognition who deliberately misrepresents themselves, often to obscure their unseemly or discreditable past conduct. John Dowell in [[Ford Madox Ford]]'s ''[[The Good Soldier]]'' exemplifies this kind of narrator.

It remains a matter of debate whether and how a non-first-person narrator can be unreliable, though the deliberate restriction of information to the audience can provide instances of unreliable ''narrative'', even if not necessarily of an unreliable ''narrator''. For example, in the three interweaving plays of [[Alan Ayckbourn]]'s ''[[The Norman Conquests]]'', each confines the action to one of three locations during the course of a weekend.

===Definitions and theoretical approaches===
[[Wayne C. Booth]] was the earliest to formulate a reader-centered approach to unreliable narration and to distinguish between a reliable and unreliable narrator on the grounds of whether the narrator's speech violates or conforms with general norms and values. He writes, "I have called a narrator ''reliable'' when he speaks for or acts in accordance with the norms of the work (which is to say the implied author's norms), ''unreliable'' when he does not."&lt;ref name=Booth/&gt; Peter J. Rabinowitz criticized Booth's definition for relying too much on facts external to the narrative, such as norms and ethics, which must necessarily be tainted by personal opinion. He consequently modified the approach to unreliable narration.

{{Quote| There are unreliable narrators (cf. Booth). An unreliable narrator however, is not simply a narrator who 'does not tell the truth' – what fictional narrator ever tells the literal truth? Rather an unreliable narrator is one who tells lies, conceals information, misjudges with respect to the narrative audience – that is, one whose statements are untrue not by the standards of the real world or of the authorial audience but by the standards of his own narrative audience. ... In other words, all fictional narrators are false in that they are imitations. But some are imitations who tell the truth, some of people who lie.&lt;ref&gt;Rabinowitz, Peter J.: ''Truth in Fiction: A Reexamination of Audiences.'' In: ''Critical Inquiry.'' Nr. 1, 1977, S. 121–141.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Rabinowitz' main focus is the status of fictional discourse in opposition to factuality. He debates the issues of truth in fiction, bringing forward four types of audience who serve as receptors of any given literary work:

# "Actual audience" (= the flesh-and-blood people who read the book)
# "Authorial audience" (= hypothetical audience to whom the author addresses his text)
# "Narrative audience" (= imitation audience which also possesses particular knowledge)
# "Ideal narrative audience" (= uncritical audience who accepts what the narrator is saying)

Rabinowitz suggests that "In the proper reading of a novel, then, events which are portrayed must be treated as both 'true' and 'untrue' at the same time. Although there are many ways to understand this duality, I propose to analyze the four audiences which it generates."&lt;ref&gt;Rabinowitz,Peter J.: ''Truth in Fiction: A Reexamination of Audiences.'' In: ''Critical Inquiry.'' Nr. 1, 1977, S. 121–141.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Tamar Yacobi has proposed a model of five criteria ('integrating mechanisms') which determine if a narrator is unreliable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hup.sub.uni-hamburg.de/lhn/index.php/Unreliability |title=Living Handbook of Narratology |accessdate=2016-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116110219/http://hup.sub.uni-hamburg.de/lhn/index.php/Unreliability |archivedate=16 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of relying on the device of the implied author and a text-centered analysis of unreliable narration, Ansgar Nünning gives evidence that narrative unreliability can be reconceptualized in the context of frame theory and of readers' cognitive strategies.

{{Quote|... to determine a narrator's unreliability one need not rely merely on intuitive judgments. It is neither the reader's intuitions nor the implied author's norms and values that provide the clue to a narrator's unreliability, but a broad range of definable signals. These include both textual data and the reader's preexisting conceptual knowledge of the world. In sum whether a narrator is called unreliable or not does not depend on the distance between the norms and values of the narrator and those of the implied author but between the distance that separates the narrator's view of the world from the reader's world-model and standards of normality.&lt;ref&gt;Nünning, Ansgar: ''But why will you say that I am mad?: On the Theory, History, and Signals of Unreliable Narration in British Fiction.'' In: ''Arbeiten zu Anglistik und Amerikanistik.'' Nr. 22, 1997, S. 83–105.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Unreliable Narration in this view becomes purely a reader's strategy of making sense of a text, i.e. of reconciling discrepancies in the narrator's account (cf. [[#Signals of unreliable narration|signals of unreliable narration]]). Nünning thus effectively eliminates the reliance on value judgments and moral codes which are always tainted by personal outlook and taste. Greta Olson recently debated both Nünning's and Booth's models, revealing discrepancies in their respective views.

{{Quote| ... Booth's text-immanent model of narrator unreliability has been criticized by Ansgar Nünning for disregarding the reader's role in the perception of reliability and for relying on the insufficiently defined concept of the implied author. Nünning updates Booth's work with a cognitive theory of unreliability that rests on the reader's values and her sense that a discrepancy exists between the narrator's statements and perceptions and other information given by the text.}}

and offers "... an update of Booth's model by making his implicit differentiation between fallible and untrustworthy narrators explicit." Olson then argues "... that these two types of narrators elicit different responses in readers and are best described using scales for fallibility and untrustworthiness."&lt;ref&gt;Olson, Greta: ''Reconsidering Unreliability: Fallible and Untrustworthy Narrators.'' In: ''Narrative.'' Nr. 11, 2003, S. 93–109.&lt;/ref&gt; She proffers that all fictional texts that employ the device of unreliability can best be considered along a spectrum of fallibility that begins with trustworthiness and ends with unreliability. This model allows for all shades of grey in between the poles of trustworthiness and unreliability. It is consequently up to each individual reader to determine the credibility of a narrator in a fictional text.

===Signals of unreliable narration===
Whichever definition of unreliability one follows, there are a number of signs that constitute or at least hint at a narrator's unreliability. Nünning has suggested to divide these signals into three broad categories.&lt;ref&gt;Nünning, Ansgar (ed.): ''Unreliable Narration'': Studien zur Theorie und Praxis unglaubwürdigen Erzählens in der englischsprachigen Erzählliteratur, Wissenschaftlicher Verlag: Trier (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

* Intratextual signs such as the narrator contradicting himself, having gaps in memory, or lying to other characters
* Extratextual signs such as contradicting the reader's general world knowledge or impossibilities (within the parameters of logic)
* Reader's literary competence. This includes the reader's knowledge about literary types (e.g. stock characters that reappear over centuries), knowledge about literary genres and its conventions or stylistic devices

==Notable examples==

===Historical occurrences===
One of the earliest uses of unreliability in literature is in ''[[The Frogs]]'' by [[Aristophanes]]. After the god [[Dionysus]] claims to have sunk 12 or 13 enemy ships with [[Cleisthenes (son of Sibyrtius)|Cleisthenes]], his slave [[Xanthias]] says "Then I woke up." A more well-known version is in [[Plautus]]' comedy ''[[Miles Gloriosus (play)|Miles Gloriosus]]'' (3rd–2nd centuries BC), which features a soldier who constantly embellishes his accomplishments while his slave Artotrogus, in [[aside]]s, claims the stories are untrue and he is only backing them up to get fed.

The literary device of the "unreliable narrator" was used in several medieval fictional [[Arabic literature|Arabic tales]] of the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', also known as the ''Arabian Nights''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Arabian Nights: A Companion |last=Irwin |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Irwin (writer) |publisher=[[I.B. Tauris|Tauris Parke Paperbacks]] |year=2003 |isbn=1-86064-983-1 |page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one tale, "The Seven Viziers", a [[courtesan]] accuses a king's son of having assaulted her, when in reality she had failed to seduce him (inspired by the [[Bible|Biblical]]/[[Quran|Qur'anic]] story of [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]]). The unreliable narrator device is also used to generate suspense in another ''Arabian Nights'' tale, "[[The Three Apples]]", an early [[Crime fiction|murder mystery]]. At one point of the story, two men claim to be the murderer, one of whom is revealed to be lying. At another point in the story, in a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] showing the reasons for the murder, it is revealed that an unreliable narrator convinced the man of his wife's [[infidelity]], thus leading to her murder.&lt;ref&gt;Pinault 1992, pp. 93–97.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another early example of unreliable narration is [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]''. In "[[The Merchant's Prologue and Tale|The Merchant's Tale]]" for example, the narrator, being unhappy in his marriage, allows his bias to slant much of his tale. In the prologue to "[[The Wife of Bath's Prologue and Tale|The Wife of Bath]]", the Wife often makes inaccurate quotations and incorrectly remembers stories.

===Novels===
[[File:Vanity Fair D467.png|thumb|right|200px|An illustration of ''[[Vanity Fair (novel)|Vanity Fair]]''’s [[Becky Sharp (character)|Becky Sharp]] as a [[homicide|man-killing]] [[mermaid]], by the work's author [[William Makepeace Thackeray|William Thackeray]]:

"There are things we do and know perfectly well in Vanity Fair, though we never speak them... In describing this [[Siren (mythology)|syren]], singing and smiling, coaxing and cajoling, the author, with modest pride, asks his readers all around, has he once forgotten the laws of politeness, and showed the monster's hideous tale above water? No! Those who like may peep down under waves that are pretty transparent, and see it writhing and twirling, diabolically hideous and slimy, flapping amongst bones, or curling round corpses; but above the water-line, I ask, has not everything been proper, agreeable, and decorous...?"&lt;ref name=thacky/&gt;]]

A controversial example of an unreliable narrator occurs in [[Agatha Christie]]'s novel ''[[The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]]'', where the narrator hides essential truths in the text (mainly through evasion, omission, and obfuscation) without ever overtly lying. Many readers at the time felt that the [[plot twist]] at the climax of the novel was nevertheless unfair. Christie used the concept again in her 1967 novel ''[[Endless Night (novel)|Endless Night]]''.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} The same technique was employed (baldly) in [[William Makepeace Thackeray]]'s 1847–8 [[serial novel|serial]] and novel ''[[Vanity Fair (novel)|Vanity Fair]]''—one of the few examples of an unreliable [[authorial voice|authorial]] narrator in the [[English novel]]&lt;ref name=goto/&gt;—where he admits passing over the worst of [[Becky Sharp (character)|Becky]]'s misdeeds in silence while providing enough allusions and clues (including in the content and captions of the illustrations, also done by Thackeray) to show the way to those interested in them;&lt;ref name=thacky&gt;{{citation |author=William Makepeace Thackeray |display-authors=0 |title=[[Vanity Fair (novel)|Vanity Fair]] |date=1848 |p=[https://archive.org/stream/VanityFair1848#page/n671/mode/2up 577]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=goto/&gt; even their accuracy, however, is made dubious by his admission that he learned the story second-hand from the diplomat Tapeworm.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=William Makepeace Thackeray |display-authors=0 |title=[[Vanity Fair (novel)|Vanity Fair]] |date=1848 |p=[https://archive.org/stream/VanityFair1848#page/n699/mode/2up 605]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Norwegian crime writer [[Sven Elvestad]]'s 1909 ''The Iron Wagon'' is another early example of the trope.

Similar unreliable narrators often appear in [[detective novel]]s and [[thriller (genre)|thriller]]s, where even a first-person narrator might hide essential information and deliberately mislead the reader in order to preserve the surprise ending. In some cases, the narrator describes himself or herself as doing things which seem questionable or discreditable, only to reveal in the end that such actions were not what they seemed (e.g. [[Alistair MacLean]]'s ''[[The Golden Rendezvous]]'' and [[John Grisham]]'s ''[[The Racketeer (novel)|The Racketeer]]''). Crime novelist [[Jim Thompson (writer)|Jim Thompson]] used the device of a narrator who is belatedly revealed to be psychotic and possibly delusional repeatedly in his books, most notably ''[[The Killer Inside Me]]'', ''[[Savage Night]]'', ''A Hell of a Woman'', and ''[[Pop. 1280]]''.

Many novels are narrated by children, whose inexperience can impair their judgment and make them unreliable. In ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'' (1884), [[Huckleberry Finn|Huck]]'s innocence leads him to make overly charitable judgments about the characters in the novel.

[[Ken Kesey]]'s two most famous novels feature unreliable narrators. [[Chief Bromden|"Chief" Bromden]] in ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (novel)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'' has [[schizophrenia]], and his telling of the events often includes things such as people growing or shrinking, walls oozing with slime, or the orderlies kidnapping and "curing" [[Santa Claus]]. Narration in ''[[Sometimes a Great Notion (novel)|Sometimes a Great Notion]]'' switches between several of the main characters, whose bias tends to switch the reader's sympathies from one person to another, especially in the rivalry between main character Leland and Hank Stamper. Many of [[Susan Howatch]]'s novels similarly use this technique; each chapter is narrated by a different character, and only after reading chapters by each of the narrators does the reader realize each of the narrators has biases and "blind spots" that cause him or her to perceive shared experiences differently.

The technique is often employed by [[Vladimir Nabokov]]. Humbert Humbert, the main character and narrator of [[Vladimir Nabokov|Nabokov]]'s ''[[Lolita]]'', often tells the story in such a way as to justify his [[hebephilia]] (fixation on young girls), in particular his sexual relationship with his 12-year-old stepdaughter.{{cn|date=April 2018}}&lt;!-- He was quite frank about his obsession; in what way was he unreliable? --&gt; In Nabokov's ''[[Pale Fire]],'' the reliability, sanity and intentions of the narrator, Charles Kinbote, is one of the central themes of the novel. 

The narrator of [[A. M. Homes]]' ''[[The End of Alice]]'' deliberately withholds the full story of the crime that put him in prison—the rape and subsequent murder of a young girl—until the end of the novel.

In some instances, unreliable narration can bring about the fantastic in works of fiction. In [[Kingsley Amis]]' ''[[The Green Man (Kingsley Amis novel)|The Green Man]]'', for example, the unreliability of the narrator Maurice Allington destabilizes the boundaries between reality and the fantastic. The same applies to [[Nigel Williams (author)|Nigel Williams]]'s ''Witchcraft''.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Horstkotte. "Unreliable Narration and the Fantastic in Kingsley Amis's ''The Green Man'' and Nigel Williams's ''Witchcraft''". ''Extrapolation'' 48,1 (2007): 137–151.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[An Instance of the Fingerpost]]'' by [[Iain Pears]] also employs several points of view from narrators whose accounts are found to be unreliable and in conflict with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.themysteryreader.com/pears-instance.html |title=THE MYSTERY READER reviews: An Instance of the Fingerpost by Iain Pears |publisher=Themysteryreader.com |accessdate=13 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928095135/http://www.themysteryreader.com/pears-instance.html |archive-date=28 September 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mike Engleby, the narrator of [[Sebastian Faulks]]' ''[[Engleby]]'', leads the reader to believe a version of events of his life that is shown to be increasingly at odds with reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/engleby-by-sebastian-faulks-449269.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110318093151/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/engleby-by-sebastian-faulks-449269.html |archivedate=18 March 2011 |title=Engleby, by Sebastian Faulks.

Zeno Cosini, the narrator of [[Italo Svevo]]'s ''[[Zeno's Conscience]]'', is a typical example of unreliable narrator: in fact the novel is presented as a diary of Zeno himself, who unintentionally distorts the facts to justify his faults. His psychiatrist, who publishes the diary, claims in the introduction that it's a mix of truths and lies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wood |first=James |authorlink=James Wood (critic) |title=Mixed Feelings |journal=London Review of Books |date=3 January 2002 |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=17–20 |url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v24/n01/james-wood/mixed-feelings |accessdate=21 April 2013 |issn=0260-9592}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pi Patel, the narrator of [[Yann Martel]]'s 2001 novel ''[[Life of Pi]]'' tells two conflicting versions of his story. After spending many days adrift at sea, he recounts a fanciful story in which he shared his lifeboat with a zebra, orangutan, hyena (which killed the zebra and orangutan), and tiger (which killed the hyena). When they question his story, he provides a darker, but more plausible recounting of events, in which a sailor and Pi's mother are murdered by the ship's cook, whom Pi then kills and eats to survive. The rescuers notice that the animals in the first story could be allegories for the people in the second one. Pi points out that neither story is provable and both have the same outcome, and the rescuers choose to believe the story featuring the animals, because it is a "better" story.

===Films===
One of the earliest examples of the use of an unreliable narrator in film is the [[German expressionism|German expressionist]] film ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]'', from 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=M/C Reviews |url=http://reviews.media-culture.org.au/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=3418 |title=Film Studies: '&amp;#39;Don't Believe His Lies'&amp;#39;, by Volker Ferenz |publisher=Reviews.media-culture.org.au |date= |accessdate=2014-01-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202204106/http://reviews.media-culture.org.au/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=3418 |archive-date=2 February 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this film, an epilogue to the main story is a [[twist ending]] revealing that Francis, through whose eyes we see the action, is a patient in an insane asylum, and the flashback which forms the majority of the film is simply his mental delusion.

The 1945 [[film noir]] ''[[Detour (1945 film)|Detour]]'' is told from the perspective of an unreliable protagonist who may be trying to justify his actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ferdinand |first=Marilyn |title=Detour (1945) |url=http://www.ferdyonfilms.com/2006/detour-1945/111/ |work=ferdyonfilms.com |date=December 2006 |accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Possessed (1947 film)|Possessed]]'' (1947), [[Joan Crawford]] plays a woman who is taken to a psychiatric hospital in a state of shock. She gradually tells the story of how she came to be there to her doctors, which is related to the audience in flashbacks, some of which are later revealed to be hallucinations or distorted by paranoia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Kevin |last=Mcgue |url=http://www.alifeatthemovies.com/possessed/ |title=Possessed movie review|date=20 June 2010 |work=A Life at the Movies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Rashomon (movie)|Rashômon]]'' (1950), a Japanese crime drama film directed by Akira Kurosawa, adapted from "[[In a Grove]]" (1921), uses [[multiperspectivity|multiple narrators]] to tell the story of the death of a [[samurai]]. Each of the witnesses describe the same basic events but differ wildly in the details, alternately claiming that the samurai died by accident, suicide, or murder. The term "[[Rashomon effect|Rashômon effect]]" is used to describe how different witnesses are able to produce contradictory accounts of the same event, though each version is presented with equal sincerity and each is plausible when considered independently of the others. The film does not select the "authentic" narrator from the differing accounts: at its conclusion, all versions remain equally plausible and equally suspect.

The 1950 [[Alfred Hitchcock]] film ''[[Stage Fright (1950 film)|Stage Fright]]'' (1950) uses the device of unreliable narration by presenting the aftermath of a murder in a flashback, as told by the murderer. The details of the flashback provide an explanation which helps convince the innocent main protagonist of the film to help the murderer, believing him innocent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alfred-hitchcock-films.net/Themes/Flashbacks-in-Hitchcock.htm |title=Flashbacks in Hitchcock's movies |publisher=alfred-hitchcock-films.net |accessdate=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the film ''[[Forrest Gump]]'' (1994), the simple-minded title character narrates his life story, demonstrating misunderstandings that are clear to the audience, such as [[Apple Computer]] being a "fruit company", and that one would get paid for sustaining a "[[million-dollar wound]]". He states that the father of his beloved Jenny treated her well, not understanding that the man's ongoing kissing and touching of her and her sisters was indicative of sexual abuse.&lt;ref name=gump&gt;{{cite web|last=Winning|first=Josh|title=50 Unreliable Movie Narrators|url=http://www.totalfilm.com/features/50-unreliable-movie-narrators|publisher=Future Publishing Limited|accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ending of the 1995 film ''[[The Usual Suspects]]'' reveals that the narrator had been deceiving another character – and hence the audience – by inventing the events and characters he is describing from whole cloth, and rather than being the weak, humble, and quiet criminal he presents as, is in fact [[Keyser Söze]], the film's fabled crime boss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Schwartz | first=Ronald | title=Neo-Noir: The New Film Noir Style from Psycho to Collateral | year=2005 | publisher=Scarecrow Press | page=71 | isbn=978-0-8108-5676-9 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=VRCgRGFV0ycC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA71#v=onepage&amp;q=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Lehman |first=David |title=The Perfect Murder: A Study in Detection |edition=2nd |year=2000 |publisher=University of Michigan Press |pages=221–222 |isbn=978-0-472-08585-9 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZYC09Sc8-jQC&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;pg=PA221#v=onepage&amp;q= |quote=[H]e has improvised, spontaneously and with reckless abandon, a coherent, convincing, but false-bottomed narrative to beguile us and deceive his interrogator.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1999 film ''[[Fight Club]]'', it is revealed that its protagonist [[The Narrator (Fight Club)|the Narrator]] has [[dissociative identity disorder]] and that some events were fabricated, which means only one of the two main protagonists actually exists, as the other is in the Narrator's mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hewitt|first=John|title=John Hewitt's Writing Tips: Explaining the Unreliable Narrator|url=http://poewar.com/john-hewitts-writing-tips-explaining-the-unreliable-narrator/|accessdate=20 April 2013|date=21 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2001 film ''[[A Beautiful Mind (film)|A Beautiful Mind]]'', it is eventually revealed that the protagonist has [[paranoid schizophrenia]], and many of the events he witnessed occurred only in his own mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hansen |first=Per Krogh |title=Unreliable Narration in Cinema | publisher=University of Southern Denmark |url=http://cf.hum.uva.nl/narratology/a09_hansen.htm |quote=...[In] the second part of the film a large part of what we hitherto have considered part of the objective perspective (persons, actions, places) are exposed as being mental constructions and projections made by the protagonist...We have not only seen the events from his perspective, but we have seen what he thinks happens.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2002 film ''[[Hero (2002 film)|Hero]]'', the protagonist is identified as an unreliable narrator by the antagonist, who responds by constructing his own alternate version of the false story. In the last part of the film, the protagonist tells the real story, which explains his presence in the current situation.

In the 2013 film ''[[Lone Ranger (2013 film)|The Lone Ranger]],'' the narrator [[Tonto]] is identified quickly as potentially unreliable by a child attending a 1930s carnival sideshow and questioning him about the origin of the Wild West legend of the Lone Ranger. Tonto's story vaguely follows an alternative version of the story as told in the popular radio dramas and television series, but with novel disclosures of graphic details.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.filmjournal.com/filmjournal/content_display/reviews/major-releases/e3ib605acb6d713e0ac18ba32b8e7cba53b | title = Film Review: ''The Lone Ranger'' | authorlink=Frank Lovece | first=Frank | last=Lovece | work = [[Film Journal International]] | date=2 July 2013 | accessdate=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the child, the audience is left to make their own judgments about his reliability.

===Television===
As a framing device on the sitcom ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'', the main character [[Ted Mosby]], in the year 2030, recounts to his son and daughter the events that led him to meeting their mother. Show creator [[Craig Thomas (screenwriter)|Craig Thomas]] explicitly said in a 2008 interview that the narrator, [[Ted Mosby|"Future Ted"]] (voiced by [[Bob Saget]]), is unreliable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ghosh|first=Korbi|title='How I Met Your Mother's' Craig Thomas on Ted &amp; Barney's Breakup, Eriksen Babies and The Future of Robarn|url=http://www.zap2it.com/blogs/how_i_met_your_mothers_craig_thomas_on_ted_barneys_breakup_eriksen_babies_and_the_future_of_robarn-2008-05|work=Zap2It.com|publisher=Tribune Media Services, LLC|accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2012-2015 [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] series, ''[[Perception (U.S. TV series)|Perception]]'' featured a protagonist Daniel Pierce (played by [[Eric McCormack]]), a talented but eccentric [[neuropsychiatry|neuropsychiatrist]] with [[schizophrenia]] who assists the [[FBI]] on some of their most complex cases.  Much of the plot tension revolves around the viewer being unsure of whether events are actually happening or are just inside the mind of Daniel Pierce.

In the 2014 [[Showtime Network|Showtime]] series, ''[[The Affair (TV series)|The Affair]]'', the storyline is set to two independent and overlapping re-tellings of the events surrounding the affair, neither of which are shown to be completely accurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='The Affair' is this fall's most compelling puzzle|url=http://www.zap2it.com/blogs/the_affair_review_showtime_dominic_west_joshua_jackson_ruth_wilson_maura_tierney-2014-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2015 [[USA Network]] series ''[[Mr. Robot (TV series)|Mr. Robot]]'' features an unreliable narrator as the main character and also a plot-device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hello, Friend|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/television/2015/08/mr_robot_on_usa_network_reviewed_the_show_represents_the_new_tv_archetype.html|website=Slate|quote=But Elliot Alderson (Rami Malek), the brilliant, socially maladjusted, mentally unstable, vigilante hacker at the center of the technologically complex and psychologically searing Mr. Robot, which airs, of all places, on the perpetually milquetoast USA Network, is an unreliable narrator in extremis.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics have claimed that Yuri Katsuki, the title character in the Japanese [[anime]] series ''[[Yuri on Ice]]'', is an unreliable narrator due to his [[anxiety]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Baker=Whitelaw|first=Gavia|url=http://www.dailydot.com/parsec/yuri-on-ice-anxiety-mental-health/|title=How anxiety and mental health shape the story of 'Yuri on Ice'|publisher=[[The Daily Dot]]|date=13 December 2016|accessdate=31 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] television series ''[[Legion (TV series)|Legion]]'' focuses on the mutant David Haller, who suffers from [[Schizophrenia]]. Haller's fractured psyche acts as a plot-device, warping Haller's view of the world. Creator [[Noah Hawley]] described Haller as an unreliable narrator.

===Comics===
In Alan Moore and Brian Bolland's ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke]]'', [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]], who is the villain of the story, reflects on the pitiful life that transformed him into a psychotic murderer. Although the Joker's version of the story is not implausible given overall Joker storylines in the [[Batman]] comics, the Joker admits at the end of ''The Killing Joke'' that he is uncertain if it is true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Leverenz |first=David |editor-last=Hutner |editor-first=Gordon |title=The American Literary History Reader |chapter=The Last Real Man in America: From Natty Bumppo to Batman |year=1995 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-19-509504-9 |page=276 |url=http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/LiteratureEnglish/AmericanLiterature/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780195095043# |accessdate=21 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006165427/http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/LiteratureEnglish/AmericanLiterature/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780195095043 |archivedate=6 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''William Morris Agency''' ('''WMA''') was a Hollywood-based [[talent agency]]. It represented some of the best known 20th century entertainers in film, television, and music. During its 109 year tenure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Company Overview of William Morris Endeavor Entertainment, LLC|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=872395|work = [[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|accessdate= May 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; it came to be regarded as the "first great talent agency in show business".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cullen |first=Frank |date= |title=Vaudeville old &amp; new: an encyclopedia of variety performances in America, Volume 1|url=https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=XFnfnKg6BcAC&amp;pg=PA1020&amp;lpg=PA1020&amp;dq=William+Morris,+Vaudeville+Agent&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5vrFnOvcwZ&amp;sig=gRTUu6ORD7BLKacr3_Z6756jTxk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiFk8rMy87KAhVhYKYKHe4tCAAQ6AEIUzAN#v=onepage&amp;q=William%20Morris%2C%20Vaudeville%20Agent&amp;f=false|location= |publisher=Routledge |page=1020 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, WMA announced it would merge with the [[Endeavor Talent Agency]] to form [[William Morris Endeavor]] which owns Miss Universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Littleton| first = Cynthia | title = WMA, Endeavor approve merger | date = 2009-04-27 | publisher = Variety | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118002879}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Beginnings ===
In 1898, William Morris (born Zelman Moses), a German Jewish immigrant to the US, posted a cross-hatch trademark above an office door in New York City{{spaced ndash}} four "X's", representing a W superimposed on an M&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/william-morris-agency-inc-history/|title=William Morris Agency, Inc. History|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=fundinguniverse.com |publisher= |access-date= 29 January 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{spaced ndash}} and went into business as '''William Morris, Vaudeville Agent'''. By the time WMA formally incorporated in New York State on January 31, 1918, Morris' son [[William Morris Jr.]] and an office boy named [[Abe Lastfogel|Abraham Lastfogel]], who, after becoming a talent agent in his own right, entered into a business partnership with Morris Sr.

As silent film grew into widely viewed entertainment, Morris encouraged his clients to experiment in the new medium. Stars such as [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Al Jolson]], the [[Marx Brothers]], and [[Mae West]] were all represented by the company.

By 1930, Morris had turned over leadership of the agency to his son and Lastfogel. In 1932, five years after his retirement, William Morris, Sr. died from heart failure. By that time, the Agency had begun the process of relocating from [[Hollywood and Vine]] to Canon Drive in Beverly Hills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brokawcompany.com/pop-ups/read_cnn_profile.html|title= A Charmed Life, or a Thirty-Six Short Makes It Big |publisher=The Brokaw Company|accessdate= November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1945 to 2000 ===

The William Morris Agency attained further industry dominance with the December 1949 acquisition of the Berg-Allenberg Agency.  The senior agent in the motion picture department during the 1950s was [[Mike Zimring]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weisbord|first=Merrily|title=Our future selves : love, life, sex, and aging|year=1991|publisher=North Atlantic Books|location=Berkeley, Calif.|isbn=978-1556431456|page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1965, WMA's Music Department had emerged as an industry powerhouse, representing, among others, the [[Rolling Stones]], [[Sonny &amp; Cher]], [[the Beach Boys]], and [[the Byrds]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Less than 10 years later, in 1973, the Agency's newly established Nashville office provided another significant boost to the operations of William Morris, extending the Agency's reach into [[country music]] and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url =http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jan/16/business/fi-morris16 |title=Morris Targets Miami's Talent|author=Claudia Eller|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date =January 16, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1980s, WMA built the William Morris Plaza located at 150 El Camino Drive, directly across the street from its main building at 151 El Camino. In 1989, WMA acquired the [[Jim Halsey]] Company.

In the early 1990s, WMA's Literary Department announced the largest book-to-screen deal ever inked when it sold the television rights for ''Scarlett'', the sequel to [[Margaret Mitchell]]'s ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone With the Wind]]''. In 2000, WMA acquired The Writers Shop, which was owned by [[Jennifer Rudolph Walsh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jennifer Rudolph Walsh|url=http://leanin.org/stories/jennifer-rudolph-walsh/|accessdate=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-2000 ===
WMA's Miami Beach office opened in 2003, and WMA's [[Shanghai]] office opened in 2004. In 2007, the Agency expanded its London music operation, underscoring WMA's continued commitment to the international marketplace. Along with the addition of new personnel, the London office moved into the iconic Centre Point Tower.

In 2003, a seismic shift occurred in the agency landscape when WMA's SVP and Theatre topper, George Lane, and fellow agent in charge of foreign rights, Michael Cardonick, left WMA to open Creative Artists Agency's New York City office and Theatrical Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Robert Hofler |url=https://variety.com/2003/legit/markets-festivals/caa-opening-gotham-digs-1117881929/|title=CAA opening Gotham digs |publisher=Variety.com |date=2003-05-09 |accessdate=2015-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2009 merger with Endeavor ==
{{Main|William Morris Endeavor}}

On April 27, 2009, WMA and the Endeavor Talent Agency announced that they were merging to form '''William Morris Endeavor'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Finke | first = Nikki | title = Latest WMA-Endeavor Merger Update: Hollywood History In The Making Today: Endeavor And William Morris Vote Yes | date = 2009-04-27 | publisher = Deadline | url = http://www.deadline.com/2009/04/latest-wma-endeavor-merger-update/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Endeavor executives [[Ari Emanuel]] and [[Patrick Whitesell]] were widely recognized as the architects of the deal and ultimately took the roles of WME Co-CEOs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.laweekly.com/2009-05-28/news/william-morris-it-39-s-a-takeover-not-a-merger |title=It's A Takeover, Not A Merger |work= [[LA Weekly]] |date=May 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the official announcement of the merger, nearly 100 WMA employees and former board members were let go. One of those leaving was Jim Wiatt, who came to WMA in 1999 from International Creative Management, where he was Vice-Chairman, in 1999.  He had joined WMA as President and Co-Chief Executive Officer, and had risen to Board Chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/27/business/27steal.html?_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1262095435-iFfjNHxKyP6WEeNLa5Tssw |title=Layoffs in the William Morris-Endeavor Merger  |author=Michael Cieply |date= December 26, 2009 |work= [[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the merger, WMA permanently relocated its offices to the Endeavor building at 9601 Wilshire Boulevard in [[Beverly Hills, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Finke | first = Nikki | title = WME Will Stay In Endeavor Headquarters Instead Of Moving To New Morris Building | date = 2009-10-09 | publisher = Deadline | url = http://www.deadline.com/2009/10/wme-not-moving-to-new-building-instead-will-stay-in-endeavor-headquarters/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The WMA Agent Training Program ==
The WMA Agent Training Program, often referred to as the "mailroom", was established in the 1940s and is well known for its roster of successful alumni. Since the 1970s the program has been replicated at other talent agencies and studios, many of which were headed by former mailroom trainees. Once accepted, trainees rotate through different departments, starting with the mailroom, before becoming a full-time assistant or coordinator.

WMA's longtime competitor, [[Creative Artists Agency]], was founded in 1975 by [[Michael Ovitz]], [[Ronald Meyer]], William Haber, [[Michael S. Rosenfeld]], and Rowland Perkins, all former WMA agent trainees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Rose | first=Frank | title=The Agency | edition=First | year=1996 | publisher=Harper Business | location=New York | isbn=0887308074}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rensin 2003"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Rensin | first=David | title=The Mailroom | edition=First | year=2003 | publisher=Ballantine Books | location=New York | isbn=0345442350}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Geffen]] once called the WMA Agent Training Program "The Harvard School of Show Business &amp;ndash; only better: no grades, no exams, a small stipend and great placement opportunities."{{cn|date=March 2017}} Graduates from the Training Program were perceived at a high level of prestige within the entertainment industry, because of the caliber of notable alums that have graduated from the program.&lt;ref name="Rensin 2003" /&gt;{{rp|464}}

Former Chairman [[Norman Brokaw]] became the first mailboy in the Beverly Hills Mailroom at age 15. The Agent Training program still exists today at William Morris Endeavor. It was famously documented in David Rensin's 2003 book, ''[[The Mailroom: Hollywood History from the Bottom Up]]''.

'''Xurban collective''' (stylized as '''xurban_collective''') is an international [[art collective]] founded in 2000. Core members of the group are Guven Incirlioglu and [[Hakan Topal]], whose transatlantic collaborations took the form of media projects and installations. xurban_collective's projects instigate the questioning, examination, and discussion of contemporary politics, theory, and ideology, utilizing documentary photography, video, new media and text. The collective focuses specifically on areas of regional conflicts, military spatial confinement, urban segregation and [[neoliberal]] exclusion strategies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artfacts.net/en/artist/xurban-collective-33847/profile.html xurban_collective entry at Artfacts.net]&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2012 xurban_collective members concluded their collaboration to focus on their personal projects, artistic research and production.

"'''Young fogey'''" is a term humorously applied, in British context, to some younger-generation, rather buttoned-down{{Clarify|date=October 2017}} writers and journalists, such as [[Simon Heffer]], [[Charles Moore (journalist)|Charles Moore]] and, for a while, [[A. N. Wilson]]. The term is attributed to [[Alan Watkins]] writing in 1984 in ''[[The Spectator]]''.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

"Young [[wikt:fogey|fogey]]" is still used to describe [[Conservatism|conservative]] young men (aged approximately between 15 and 40) who [[vintage clothing|dress in a vintage style]] (usually that of the 1920s-1930s, also known as the "Brideshead" look (after the influence of the [[Evelyn Waugh]] novel ''[[Brideshead Revisited]]''). Young-fogeys tend towards erudite, conservative cultural pursuits, especically art and traditional architecture, rather than sports. The young-fogey style of dress also has some surface similarity with the American [[preppy]] style, but is endogenous to the [[United Kingdom]] and anglo-centric areas of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] such as [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].{{cn|date=April 2018}}

==History==
The movement reached its peak in the 1980s with champions such as [[A.N. Wilson]], [[Gavin Stamp]] and [[John Martin Robinson]] and a relatively widespread following, but has declined since. Though generally a middle class phenomenon, it had a wider influence on fashions in the 1980s. Young-fogeys are rarely rich or upper class and sometimes make a style virtue of genteel poverty, especially when rescuing old houses.&lt;ref&gt;John Martin Robinson &amp; Alexandra Artley, The New Georgian Handbook. Harpers, London, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; They often combine a conservative cultural outlook with a distate of Conservative political activity. They find [[feminism]] perpexing but are often open to [[bisexuality]] with men; even firmly heterosexual youg-fogeys have [[homosocial]] tendencies.{{cn|date=November 2018}} Often religious, their conservative outlook extends to refuting progressive theology.

Today committed young-fogeys may found amongst students at Oxford, Cambridge, [[Durham University|Durham]], [[Edinburgh]] and [[St Andrews]] universities; and at some universities in the Commonwealth, notably the [[University of Melbourne]] and [[Sydney]].{{cn|date=November 2018}} Adherents tend to concentrate in some professions: in particular the [[antique]]s and art dealing, residential estate agency, conservative classical [[architecture]] practices and certain strata of the [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Anglican]] churches.{{cn|date=November 2018}} Strongholds of young fogeys include the [[Oxford University Conservative Association]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]],{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} but they are also seen elsewhere.

==People==
Irish broadcaster [[Ryan Tubridy]], who hosts ''[[The Late Late Show (Ireland)|The Late Late Show]]'', has described himself as a "young fogey".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.herald.ie/entertainment/around-town/i-wont-stay-on-late-late-show-forever-reveals-ryan-1992876.html|title=I won't stay on Late Late Show forever, reveals Ryan - Making plans: Tubridy doesn't see 'dream job' as his final TV gig|first=Caitlin|last=McBride|work=Evening Herald|publisher=Independent News &amp; Media|date=30 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British [[Member of Parliament#United Kingdom|Member of Parliament]] [[Jacob Rees-Mogg]] was described as a "young fogey" after [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|his 2010 election to Westminster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1293560/QUENTIN-LETTS-Young-fogey-whos-charmed-Lefties.html|title=Young fogey who's charmed the Lefties|first=Quentin|last=Letts|work=Daily Mail|publisher=Daily Mail and General Trust|date=9 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British writer, editor, and broadcaster [[Anthony Lejeune]] was described by ''[[The Times]]'' as: "always out of period, a misfit in the modern world for whom the term 'young fogey' might have been invented".&lt;ref name=times&gt;[https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/obituary-anthony-lejeune-p7vkl5hcb Anthony Lejeune.] ''The Times'', 26 March 2018.
