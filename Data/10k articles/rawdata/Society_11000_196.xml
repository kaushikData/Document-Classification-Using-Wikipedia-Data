      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3955">The '''Acadian World Congress''', or '''Le Congrès Mondial Acadien''', is a festival of [[Acadian]] and [[Cajun]] culture and history, held every five years. It is also informally known as the ''Acadian Reunion''. Its creator was André Boudreau (1945-2005).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/new-brunswick/story/2005/11/24/nb-boudreau-obit-20051124.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first congress was held in [[Moncton]], [[New Brunswick]] in 1994, and the second was held in south Louisiana from July 31 to August 15, 1999.  The 1999 event featured the reunions of over 80 Acadian families, three major concerts (Houma, Oak Alley Plantation, and Lafayette Cajundome), and academic conferences centered on economics, culture, women's issues, genealogy and genetics.  The President and executive director of the 1999 event was Brian Gabriel Comeaux of Lafayette, LA.

===2004 World Congress===
The third congress, in 2004, was held jointly by several [[Nova Scotia]] communities in the ancestral [[Acadia|Acadie]] region, and celebrated the 400th anniversary of the arrival of the first French-speaking settlers in Canada. As in the previous gatherings, musical festivals and theatrical productions displayed Acadian culture, and academics debated the meaning of Acadia in the 21st century. Debate topics included the best ways of preserving Acadian culture in an overwhelmingly English area, and what exactly an Acadian is in 2004. Some Acadians in the [[Maritimes]] do not recognize more recent immigrants as true Acadians. There was also a debate about whether the descendants of Acadians, who do not speak French, qualify (see [[Chiac language]]).

===2009 World Congress===
The 2009 Acadian World Congress was held in the [[Acadian Peninsula]].

===2014 World Congress===
The 2014 Acadian World Congress was held along the [[Canada–United States border]], co-hosted by [[Maine]]'s [[Aroostook County, Maine|Aroostook County]] in the [[United States]] and its neighbouring counties in [[Canada]] ([[Témiscouata Regional County Municipality|Témiscouata]] in Quebec, and [[Victoria County, New Brunswick|Victoria]], [[Madawaska County, New Brunswick|Madawaska]] and [[Restigouche County, New Brunswick|Restigouche]] in New Brunswick).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Olmstead|first=Kathryn|title=Van Buren, Canadian towns reach across border to get ready for World Acadian Congress in August|url=http://bangordailynews.com/2014/04/10/living/van-buren-canadian-towns-reach-across-border-to-get-ready-for-world-acadian-congress-in-august/|accessdate=11 April 2014|newspaper=[[Bangor Daily News]]|date=10 April 2014|archiveurl=http://bangordailynews.com/2014/04/10/living/van-buren-canadian-towns-reach-across-border-to-get-ready-for-world-acadian-congress-in-august/|archivedate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://bangordailynews.com/2015/01/20/news/aroostook/world-acadian-congress-final-numbers-half-of-what-had-been-forecast/&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2019 Congress is planned to be held on [[Prince Edward Island]] and in [[New Brunswick]], with its central events being held in [[Summerside, Prince Edward Island|Summerside]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McKay|first=Millicent|title=Congrès Mondial Acadien less than a year away, to be held in eight Island communities|url=http://www.journalpioneer.com/news/local/congres-mondial-acadien-less-than-a-year-away-to-be-held-in-eight-island-communities-233517/|accessdate=17 August 2018|newspaper=[[Journal Pioneer]]|date=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arabic coffee''' ({{lang-ar|قهوة عربية|qahwah arabiyya||link=}}, {{IPA-ar|ˈqah.wa ʕaraˈbijːah|-|Arabic coffee ar.ogg}}) refers to a version of the brewed coffee of ''[[Coffea arabica]]'' beans. Arabic coffee is typically grown at a height of 1000 to 2000 meters, and represents about 60-70% of the coffee industry in the world&lt;ref name="ICO"&gt;{{cite web|title=Botanical Aspects |publisher=International Coffee Organization |location=London |url=http://www.ico.org/botanical.asp |accessdate=4 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324155957/http://www.ico.org/botanical.asp |archivedate=24 March 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1.2.5-World coffee trade-World production by type: arabica and robusta|url=http://www.intracen.org/coffee-guide/world-coffee-trade/world-production-by-type-arabica-and-robusta/|website=www.intracen.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Most [[Arab world|Arab countries]] throughout the [[Middle East]] have developed unique methods for brewing and preparing coffee. [[Cardamom]] is an often-added spice,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ingredients Arabic Coffee|url=http://www.nestle-family.com/nescafe/arabiana/nescafe-arabiana-product.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it can alternatively be served plain ({{lang-ar|قهوة سادة|qahwah sādah|lit=plain coffee|link=no}}).

There are mainly two types of Arabic coffee; one with a golden colour made mainly in [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|the Gulf region]], and the other is black.

There are several different styles to brewing the coffee depending on the preference of the drinker. Some methods keep the coffee light, which usually contains cardamom, whereas others can make it dark. Arabic coffee is [[Taste|bitter]], and typically no sugar is added. It is usually served in a small cup that is adorned with a decorative pattern, known as a finjān. Culturally, Arabic coffee is served during family gatherings or when receiving guests.

Arabic coffee is ingrained within Middle Eastern and Arab culture and tradition, and is the most popular form of coffee brewed in the Middle East. It originated in the [[Middle East]], beginning in [[Yemen]] and eventually travelling to [[Mecca]] ([[Hejaz]]), [[Egypt]], the [[Levant]], and then, in the mid-16th century, to [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name="Bennett" /&gt; Arabic coffee is an [[Intangible cultural heritage|Intangible Cultural Heritage]] of [[Arab states]] confirmed by [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/en/RL/arabic-coffee-a-symbol-of-generosity-01074|title=Arabic coffee, a symbol of generosity - intangible heritage - Culture Sector - UNESCO|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
[[File:John Frederick Lewis 004.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Arab women]] (coffee bearer) by [[John Frederick Lewis]] (1857). in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]])]]
The word "coffee" entered the English language in 1582 via the Dutch ''koffie'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[OED]]'', ''s.v.'' "Coffee".&lt;/ref&gt; borrowed from the [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] ''kahve'', in turn borrowed from the [[Arabic]] [[wiktionary:قهوة|قَهْوَة]] (qahwa, “coffee, a brew”).&lt;ref name=OED&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', 1st&amp;nbsp;ed. "coffee, ''n.''" Oxford University Press (Oxford), 1891.&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''qahwah'' may have originally referred to the drink's reputation as an appetite suppressant from the word ''qahiya'' ({{lang-ar|قَهِيَ|qahiya|lit=to lack hunger}}).&lt;ref name="Kaye1986"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaye|first=Alan|date=1986|title=The Etymology of Coffee: The Dark Brew|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=106|issue=3|page=557|doi=10.2307/602112|jstor=602112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=قهي |url=http://www.baheth.info/all.jsp?term=%D9%82%D9%87%D9%8A|work=الباحث العربي |accessdate=September 25, 2011|language=ar}}(see also [http://www.ejtaal.net/aa/#hw4=943,ll=2665,ls=16,la=3767,sg=880,ha=644,br=804,pr=130,aan=541,mgf=739,vi=311,kz=2231,mr=568,mn=1168,uqw=1367,umr=905,ums=767,umj=690,ulq=1452,uqa=359,uqq=319,bdw=h739,amr=h534,asb=h825,auh=h1333,dhq=h469,mht=h766,msb=h205,tla=h88,amj=h681,ens=h1,mis=h1 qahiya: Hans Wehr's ''Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic'']. page 930.)&lt;/ref&gt;  The name ''qahwah'' is not used for the berry or plant (the products of the region), which are known in Arabic as ''bunn''.  Semitic had a root ''qhh'' "dark color", which became a natural designation for the beverage.  According to this analysis, the feminine form ''qahwah'' (also meaning "dark in color, dull(ing), dry, sour") also had the meaning of wine, which was also often dark in color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Alan S. |last=Kaye |title=The etymology of "coffee": The dark brew |journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society |volume=106 |number=3 |pages=557–558 |year=1986 |doi=10.2307/602112 |jstor=602112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The earliest credible evidence of either coffee drinking or knowledge of the coffee tree appears in the middle of the 15th century, in [[Yemen]]'s [[Sufi]] monasteries.&lt;ref name="Bennett"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Bennett Alan|last1=Weinberg|first2=Bonnie K.|last2=Bealer|title=The world of caffeine|year=2001|pages=3–4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qyz5CnOaH9oC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=coffee+goat+ethiopia+Kaldi&amp;lr=&amp;ei=paxHStuDJ4XuzATj97hf | isbn=978-0-415-92723-9 | publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sufis used it to keep themselves alert during their nighttime devotions. A translation of Al-Jaziri's manuscript&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Al-Jaziri's manuscript work is of considerable interest with regards to the history of coffee in Europe as well. A copy reached the French royal library, where it was translated in part by [[Antoine Galland]] as ''De l'origine et du progrès du café''.&lt;/ref&gt; traces the spread of coffee from ''Arabia Felix'' (the present day Yemen) northward to [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]], and then to the larger cities of [[Cairo]], [[Damascus]], [[Baghdad]], and [[Constantinople]]. In 1511, it was forbidden for its stimulating effect by conservative, orthodox imams at a theological court in [[Mecca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=resource for arabic books|url=http://www.alwaraq.net/Core/waraq/bibliography_indetail?id=184|website=www.alwaraq.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these bans were to be overturned in 1524 by an order of the [[Ottoman Dynasty|Ottoman Turkish]] [[Sultan]] [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Suleiman I]], with [[Grand Mufti]] [[Mehmet Ebussuud el-İmadi]] issuing a ''[[fatwa]]'' allowing the consumption of coffee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Schneider | first= Irene | chapter= Ebussuud |editor= Michael Stolleis |title= Juristen: ein biographisches Lexikon; von der Antike bis zum 20.

== Preparation ==
[[Image:Dallahs.png|thumb|220px|[[Dallah (coffee pot)|Dallahs]]]]
Arabic coffee is made from coffee beans roasted very lightly or heavily from {{convert|165|to|210|C|F}} and cardamom, and is a traditional beverage in Arab culture.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.yourmiddleeast.com/features/what-makes-arabic-coffee-unique_9351|title=What makes Arabic coffee unique?|work=Your Middle East|access-date=2017-04-14|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, it is roasted on the premises (at home or for special occasions), ground, brewed and served in front of guests. It is often served with dates, dried fruit, candied fruit or nuts.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dlc.fi/~marianna/gourmet/19_30.htm|title=Gulf Arabic coffee - qahwa arabiyyah|website=www.dlc.fi|access-date=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arabic coffee, is defined by the method of preparation and flavors, rather than the type or roast beans. Arabic coffee is boiled coffee that is not filtered, made black. Sugar is not typically added, but if so, it can be added during preparation or when serving. It is served in a small delicate cup without handles, called finjān. Sometimes, the coffee is moved to a larger and more beautiful pour pitcher to serve in front of the guests, called Della. Often, though, the host prepares coffee in the kitchen and highlights a tray of small cups of coffee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.terracerestaurantandlounge.com/how-to-make-arabic-coffee-7-steps/|title=How To Make Arabic Coffee|date=2015-03-01|work=Terrace Restaurant &amp; Lounge|access-date=2017-04-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike its [[Turkish coffee|Turkish]] counterparts, traditional Arabic coffee, with its roots in [[Bedouin]] tradition, is usually unsweetened (qahwah saada), but sugar can added depending on the preference of drinker. However, this coffee is never sweet syrup, but rather strong and bitter. To make up for the bitter flavor, coffee is usually served with something sweet{{snd}}dates are a traditional accompaniment{{snd}}and other desserts are often served along with a tray of coffee cups.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"''Coffee should be black as hell, strong as death, and sweet as love.''"   - Turkish Proverb&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://food-heritage.org/wordpress/lebanese-coffee/|title=Food Heritage Foundation   – Lebanese coffee|website=food-heritage.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Image:Coffee Souq Waqif Doha.jpg|thumb|left|widthpx|Kanaka also called rikwah or jezwah at [[Souq Waqif]] in [[Doha]], [[Qatar]].]]

Arabs in the Gulf are also creative in the way they prepare coffee. Coffee is different from that in Egypt and [[Levant]] in terms of bitterness and the type of cups the coffee is served in. This brewing method is common in [[Najd]] and [[Hejaz]], and sometimes other [[spice]]s like [[saffron]] (to give it a golden color), [[cloves]], and [[cinnamon]]. Some people add a little-[[evaporated milk]] to slightly alter its color; however, this is rare. It is prepared in and served from a special coffee pot called [[Dallah (coffee pot)|dallah]] ({{lang-ar|'''دلة'''}}); more commonly used is the coffee pot called [[cezve]] (also called rikwah or kanaka) and the coffee cups are small with no handle called ''fenjan''. The portions are small, covering just the bottom of the cup. It is served in homes, and in good restaurants by specially clad waiters called ''gahwaji'', and it is almost always accompanied with dates. It is always offered with the compliments of the house.[[Image:Different_Types_of_Arabic_Coffee.jpg|thumb|367x367px|The different types of Arabic coffee with the [[Hejazi]] / [[Najd]]i golden coffee seen on the left and the [[Levant]]ine black "qahwah sādah" (plain coffee) on the right.]]

The hot beverage that [[Palestinians]] consume is coffee{{snd}}served in the morning and throughout the day. The coffee of choice is usually Arabic coffee. Arabic coffee is similar to Turkish coffee, but the former is spiced with [[cardamom]] and is usually unsweetened.&lt;ref name="IMEU1"&gt;[http://imeu.net/news/article001840.shtml The rich flavors of Palestine] Farsakh, Mai M.

Coffee is poured directly from "rakwe" to a small cup that is adorned with a decorative pattern, known as a finjān. &lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The finjān has a capacity of 60-90 ml (2-3 oz fl). Lebanese coffee is traditionally strong and black and is similar to the coffee of other Middle Eastern countries. However it differs in its beans and roast, where the blonde and dark beans are mixed together. It is also ground into a very particle like size.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://maatouk.com/lebCoffee.aspx|title=Lebanese Coffee, Coffee passion|website=maatouk.com|access-date=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often joked that a Lebanese person who does not drink coffee is in danger of losing their nationality.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; 

Drinks in [[Syria]] vary depending on the time of day and the occasion. Arabic coffee is the most well-known hot drink usually prepared in the morning at [[breakfast]] or in the evening. It is usually served for guests or after [[food]].

Arabic coffee is much more than just a drink in Jordan{{snd}}it is a traditional sign of respect and a way to bring people together. Black, cardamom-flavored Arabic coffee, also known as ''qahwah sādah'' (welcome coffee), deeply ingrained in [[Culture of Jordan|Jordanian culture]]. Providing coffee (and tea) to guests is a large part of the intimate hospitality of the [[Jordan|Hashemite Kingdom]].

=== Morocco ===
Arabic coffee is the national drink of [[Morocco]], it is often made with the purpose of conducting a business deal, bargaining or welcoming someone into their home.

== Cultivation ==
[[File:Jerusalem cafe du rue 1858.jpg|thumb|upright|A ''maqhah'' in [[Jerusalem]] during [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], 1858]]
Much of the popularization of coffee is due to its cultivation in the Arab world, beginning in what is now Yemen, by Sufi monks in the 15th century.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cuisine and Culture: A History of Food and People|last=Civitello|first=Linda|publisher=John Wiley|year=2007|isbn=9780471741725|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through thousands of Arabs pilgrimaging to [[Mecca]], the enjoyment and harvesting of coffee, or the "wine of Araby" spread to other Arab countries (e.g. Egypt, [[Syria]]) and eventually to a majority of the world through the 16th century. Coffee, in addition to being essential in the home, became a major part of social life.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Alif Baa: Introduction to Arabic Letters and Sounds|last=Brustad|first=Kristen|last2=Al-Batal|first2=Mahmoud|last3=Al-Tonsi|first3=Abbas|publisher=Georgetown University Press|year=2010|isbn=9781589016330|location=|page=132|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coffeehouses, qahwa قَهوة in [[Modern Standard Arabic]], became "Schools of the Wise" as they developed into places of intellectual discussion, in addition to centers of relaxation and comradery.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncausa.org/About-Coffee/History-of-Coffee|title=The History Of Coffee|last=|first=|date=October 24, 2016|website=ncausa.org|publisher=National Coffee Association of the U.S.A.|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Coffeehouse ==
[[Image:1004-CoffeeSceneCairo18th.jpg|thumb|left|Coffeehouse in Cairo, 18th c.]]
[[Coffeehouse]] culture began in the [[Arab world]], and eventually spread to other areas of the world and blended with the local culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/934667227|title=Coffee and Coffeehouses The Origins of a Social Beverage in the Medieval Near East.|last=S.,|first=Hattox, Ralph|date=2014-01-01|publisher=University of Washington Press|isbn=0295805498|oclc=934667227}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional Arab coffeehouses are places where mostly men meet to socialize over games, coffee, and water pipes ([[Hookah|shisha]] or agriile). Depending on where the coffeehouse is, its specialty differs. In [[Maghreb]], green tea is served with mint or coffee is served Arab and/or European style. Arabic coffee, or Turkish coffee, is made in [[Egypt]] and the [[Levant|Levant countries]]. Arabic coffee is a very small amount of dark coffee boiled in a pot and presented in a demitasse cup. Particularly in Egypt, coffee is served mazbuuta, which means the amount of sugar will be "just right", about one teaspoon per cup. However, in the [[Arabian Peninsula]], Arabic coffee is roasted in such a way that the coffee is almost clear. In all of the Arab world, it is traditional for the host to refill the guest's cup until politely signaled that the guest is finished.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Served ==
[[File:A man pours Arabic coffee.ogg|thumb|An Arab man pours traditional cup of Arabic coffee in Levant]]
Arabic coffee is usually served just a few [[Litre|centiliters]] at a time. The waiter/host serves the guest just enough to cover the bottom of the cup. Usually, the coffee is boiling hot, so larger amounts would take too long to cool to a drinkable temperature.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The guest drinks it and if he wishes, he will gesture to the waiter not to pour any more. Otherwise, the host/waiter will continue to serve another few centilitres at a time until the guest indicates he has had enough. The most common practice is to drink only one cup since serving coffee serves as a ceremonial act of kindness and hospitality. Sometimes people also drink larger volumes during conversations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gwnunn.com/blog/2011/03/arabic-coffee-service/|title=Arabic Coffee Service {{!}} GWNunn.com|website=gwnunn.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Customs ==
The cups are normally only filled partway, and the custom is to drink three cups.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cabincrewexcellence.com/arabic-coffee-a-welcoming-ritual/|title=Arabic Coffee - A Welcoming Ritual|work=Cabin Crew Excellence|access-date=2017-04-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arabic coffee has a prominent place in traditional [[Arabs|Arab]] holidays and special events such as [[Ramadan]] and [[Muslim holidays|Eid]].

=== Fortune-telling ===
Arabic coffee reading ({{Lang-ar|قراءة الفنجان|qirāʾat al-finjān|}}), is similar to tea-leaf reading; the client is asked to consume strong fresh Arabic coffee leaving approximately a teaspoon of liquid in the cup. The cup is then inverted onto a saucer to allowing the residual liquid to drain away. The reader will then interpret the patterns formed by the thick residue on the inside of the cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jane - Fortune Teller {{!}} Middlesex{{!}} South East{{!}} UK - Contraband Events|url=https://www.contrabandevents.com/project/jane-fortune-teller-middlesex-south-east-uk/|website=Contraband Events}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Funeral ===
In Arabic [[funeral]]s gather families and extended relatives, who drink bitter and unsweetened coffee and restore the life and characteristics of the deceased., the men and women gather separately, it has become very fashionable to employ very presentable women whose only job is to serve coffee all day to the women. Male waiters serve the men. [[Arab Muslims]] and [[Arab Christians|Christians]] share this tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://imeu.org/article/social-customs-and-traditions|title=Palestinian Social Customs and Traditions {{!}} IMEU|last=IMEU|website=imeu.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nutrition facts ==
A small cup of Arabic coffee has almost no calories or fat. It contains a small amount of protein.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/296924-arabic-coffee-nutrition-information/|title=Arabic Coffee Nutrition Information|last=Cherney|first=Kristeen|work=LIVESTRONG.COM|access-date=2017-04-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blog.raynatours.com/5-interesting-facts-arabic-coffee/|title=5 Interesting Facts About Arabic Coffee|last=Tulsani|first=Manoj|date=2013-05-29|work=Travel Tips and Experience - Rayna Tours and Travels|access-date=2017-04-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Association of Health Care Journalists''' is an independent, [[nonprofit organization]] dedicated to advancing public understanding of [[health care]] issues. Its mission is to improve the quality, accuracy and visibility of [[Health care journalism|health care reporting, writing and editing]]. There are more than 1,500 members of AHCJ. The Association is based in [[Columbia, Missouri]], at the [[Missouri School of Journalism]].

==History==
The Association incorporated in 1998 and procured [[501(c)3]] status in 1999. In 2004 (at the fifth national conference in [[Minneapolis]]), the membership approved conversion of the Association to a [[501(c)6]] trade association with a supporting 501(c)3 charitable organization - the Center for Excellence in Health Care Journalism. The association holds annual [[meetings]], publishes [[newsletters]], operates a [[website]] and advocates on behalf of health [[journalists]] and the free flow of information. The Center presents training events, publishes educational materials and undertakes other educational projects aimed at improving the state of health [[journalism]].

==Resources==
AHCJ and the Center offer a number of resources and services intended to help journalists do in-depth and accurate reporting on health and health care issues. Its initiatives include the Awards for Excellence in Health Care Journalism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthjournalism.org/awards-entryFormRules.php |title=Association of Health Care Journalists &amp;#124; Awards-Entry Form and Rules |publisher=Healthjournalism.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-25| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101031105046/http://healthjournalism.org/awards-entryFormRules.php| archivedate= 31 October 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; an active Web site and blog, annual conferences,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthjournalism.org/calendar.php?EventType=1&amp;EventSubType=1 |title=Association of Health Care Journalists &amp;#124; Training Conferences |publisher=Healthjournalism.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-25| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101025011554/http://www.healthjournalism.org/calendar.php?EventType=1&amp;EventSubType=1| archivedate= 25 October 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; smaller training events,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthjournalism.org/calendar.php?EventType=1&amp;EventSubType=2 |title=Association of Health Care Journalists &amp;#124; Training Workshops |publisher=Healthjournalism.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-25| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101025011601/http://www.healthjournalism.org/calendar.php?EventType=1&amp;EventSubType=2| archivedate= 25 October 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; online training,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthjournalism.org/calendar.php?EventType=1&amp;EventSubType=4 |title=Association of Health Care Journalists &amp;#124; Training Online |publisher=Healthjournalism.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-25| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101025005812/http://www.healthjournalism.org/calendar.php?EventType=1&amp;EventSubType=4| archivedate= 25 October 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fellowships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthjournalism.org/about-news-detail.php?id=60 |title=Association of Health Care Journalists &amp;#124; About-News |publisher=Healthjournalism.org |date=2008-11-10 |accessdate=2010-10-25| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101117135622/http://healthjournalism.org/about-news-detail.php?id=60| archivedate= 17 November 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
The Awards for Excellence in Health Care Journalism are notable as the only awards program for health journalism that is not influenced or funded by commercial or special-interest groups, an issue that has received scrutiny recently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/22/health/22journalists.html?ref=health | work=The New York Times | title=Conflicts of Interest May Ensnare Journalists, Too | date=2008-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''''bras d'honneur''''' ({{IPA-fr|bʁa dɔˈnœʁ}} "arm of honor"), '''Iberian slap''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''corte de manga''), or '''Italian salute'''&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Geoffrey (2015). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=sIGsBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA259&amp;lpg=PA259&amp;dq="italian+salute" An Encyclopedia of Swearing: The Social History of Oaths, Profanity, Foul Language, and Ethnic Slurs in the English-speaking World]''. [[Routledge]]. p. 259&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[obscene gesture]] most common in [[Romance-speaking Europe|Romanic Europe]] ([[Italy]], [[France]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]]), [[Latin America]], [[Russia]], [[Poland]], [[Croatia]], [[Turkey]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Ireland]] and in parts of [[Scotland]]. To make the gesture, an arm is bent in an L-shape, with the fist pointing upwards; the other hand then grips the biceps of the bent arm as it is emphatically raised to a vertical position. It has the same meaning as giving [[the finger]] (known as ''le doigt d'honneur'').

== International nomenclature ==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2011}}
* In [[Italy]], the gesture is often referred to as ''gesto dell'ombrello'', meaning literally "[[umbrella]] gesture." Its most famous occurrence in [[Italian cinema]] is in [[Federico Fellini]]'s ''[[I vitelloni]]'' (1953), where the idler played by [[Alberto Sordi]] jeers at a group of workmen, combining this gesture with a [[Blowing a raspberry|raspberry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jD45TQIfcoo |title=Fellini&amp;nbsp;– I vitelloni |publisher=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Brazil]], the gesture is known as a "[[banana]]" and carries the same connotation as giving someone [[the finger]]. It can also be used to denote disrespectfully ignoring what someone just said, analogous in meaning to the American expression, "I don't give a fuck."&lt;ref name=cascudo&gt;[https://books.google.com.br/books?id=-69cBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT336&amp;lpg=PT336&amp;dq=banana+gesto&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hXWoOIJmW8&amp;sig=N5TT3yfy03pPdaLw_AR783bfyRg&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJmvzlxu7OAhUEk5AKHR7sAxI4FBDoAQglMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=banana%20gesto&amp;f=false História de nossos gestos]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Portugal]] has a similar term, "''[[wikt:manguito#Portuguese|manguito]]''". It is also the most characteristic gesture performed by the Portuguese [[everyman]] "[[Zé Povinho]]". &lt;ref name=cascudo/&gt;
* In most Spanish-speaking countries, the gesture is known as ''"corte de manga(s)"'' ("sleeve-cut"), with the same insulting meaning. 
* In [[Catalonia]] the gesture is called a "botifarra", the name of a local [[botifarra|sausage]] speciality.
* In [[Colombia]] the gesture has the function of replacing the raised middle finger, meaning "''jódete''" or "''friégate''". 
* In [[Mexico]], the gesture is known as a "''mentada de madre''", an insult directed towards the mother of the offended (commonly accompanied by the phrase "chinga tu madre", "fuck your mother"), though it is done with a single hand.
* In [[Poland]], the gesture is known as ''wał'' or ''gest Kozakiewicza'' ("[[Kozakiewicz's gesture]]") after [[Władysław Kozakiewicz]], who famously displayed this gesture after winning the gold medal in the [[pole vault]] at the [[Athletics at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980 Summer Olympics]] in front of a hostile crowd in [[Moscow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mn0in1fzqoI&amp; |title=gest Kozakiewicza Moskwa 1980 |publisher=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; This coincided with the rise of the Solidarity Union in Poland in 1980. 
* In [[Croatia]], the gesture is known as ''bosanski grb'' ("The Bosnian Coat-of-Arms") after the [[Coat of arms of Bosnia and Herzegovina#Historic arms|territorial coat of arms]] of [[Bosnia]] during the Austro-Hungarian reign, that is somewhat similar to the actual gesture.
* In [[Bulgaria]] the bent hand is sometimes used to form a [[facepalm]] when performing this gesture, expressing strong disappointment or mocking a failure.
* In [[Turkey]] the gesture is called a "kol" which just literally means arm. It has an insulting meaning. 
* In the [[United States]], the gesture is known as "The Arm" or as the "Italian salute."
* In [[Malta]], this implies a maternal insult: "fuck your mother".

==In popular culture==
{{In popular culture|section|date=October 2017}}
* In the comedy film ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian]]'', an old man is supposed to fight a professional gladiator, but instead keeps running around the arena. The gladiator dies of a heart disease and the old man keeps running, makes victorious gestures, then kneels and gives the local Roman authorities the ''bras d'honneur''.
* In the musical ''[[West Side Story]]'', performances of the song "Gee, Officer Krupke" end with the entire Jets gang giving the audience the ''bras d'honneur'' while singing the final line.
*In the musical ’’[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]’’ during “La Vie Boheme” the ‘’ bras d’honneur’’ is made after singing the line: “Why Dorthoy and Toto went over the rainbow, to blow off Auntie Em!”
* In the film adaptation of the musical ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]'', Rizzo makes this gesture towards Vince Fontaine after being eliminated from the dance contest. 
* In the movie ''[[Poltergeist (1982 film)|Poltergeist]]'', Dana Freeling makes a big show of giving a ''bras d'honneur'' with a raised middle finger to a group of workmen.

'''''Cantegril''''' is the local nickname given to the [[shanty town]]s that surround [[Montevideo]] and other cities of [[Uruguay]].

The name is meant to be ironic, as Cantegril is one of the most expensive neighbourhoods of the international seaside resort [[Punta del Este]].,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elpais.com.uy/opinion/editorial/cara-dolorosa-montevideo-ciudad-contribuyentes.html |title=A painful face of Montevideo|date=2013-06-28|publisher=[[El País (Uruguay)|EL PAIS]]}} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; originally it comes from [[Provençal dialect]] cante gril which means [[cricket]] sing, probably taken from homonymous novel by [[Raymond Escholier]] in  1921.

According to 2007 data, ca. 6% of the total Uruguayan population (174,393 people) lived in ''cantegriles''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ine.gub.uy/fase1new/TotalPais/Cuadro4_00_A.XLS INE - Censo Fase 1 2004: Población en asentamientos irregulares por sexo, según departamento.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615010337/http://www.ine.gub.uy/fase1new/TotalPais/Cuadro4_00_A.XLS |date=June 15, 2013 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Caravan''''' is a 1946 British black-and-white [[drama film]] directed by [[Arthur Crabtree]]. It was one of the [[Gainsborough melodramas]] and is based on a novel ''[[Caravan (novel)|Caravan]]'' by [[Eleanor Smith (writer)|Eleanor Smith]].

==Plot==
In late 19th-century London, destitute Richard Darrell ([[Stewart Granger]]) rescues Don Carlos ([[Gerard Heinz]]) from two robbers. When Richard returns for the manuscript he inadvertently left behind, he is encouraged by Don Carlos to talk about his background. The son of a poor country doctor, he met the upper class Oriana Camperdene and Francis Castleton during their childhood; he and Francis became rivals for Oriana's affections. Oriana and her father left for Spain, but the couple were reunited as adults and agreed to marry, much to Francis's disgust. However, they postponed the wedding for a year so that Richard could go to London and make his fortune as a writer. However, though he has completed a novel, no one wants to publish it and his year is almost up. Don Carlos offers to publish it and asks him to take a valuable [[necklace]], which once belonged to Queen Isabella of Castile, to [[Granada]]. 

Bidding farewell to Oriana ([[Anne Crawford]]), Richard sets out.  On the way, he meets Wycroft ([[Robert Helpmann]]), who assaults, robs and nearly kills Richard on behalf of his dastardly master, Sir Francis Castleton ([[Dennis Price]]). Oriana thinks Richard is dead and, with her father recently dead, marries Francis, whilst Richard loses his memory as a result of the assault and marries a [[Romani people|gypsy]] girl named Rosal ([[Jean Kent]]). However, everyone meets again...

==Critical reception==
''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, "Granger and the rest of the cast alternate between grappling with stilted lines and an embarrassingly archaic situation with neither the players nor plot making much entertainment, while 'Caravan' moves with the speed of an oxcart."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=A..

'''''Comrades and Strangers''''' is the memoir of [[Michael Harrold]], the first British person to reside in [[North Korea]]. The book was written to demystify North Korean society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Comrades and Strangers: Behind the Closed Doors of North Korea |url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-4406708/Comrades-and-Strangers-Behind-the.html |work=[[New Internationalist]] |date=1 June 2005 |accessdate=2008-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Harrold, who sought a year or two of adventure after graduating from university, flew to [[Pyongyang]], [[North Korea]], in the spring of 1987 after accepting employment in the country’s Foreign Languages Publishing House, where he assisted in the translation of President [[Kim Il Sung]]’s words into English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Book review: A glimpse behind the last Iron Curtain |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/731651/Book-review-A-glimpse-behind-the-last-Iron-Curtain.html |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=12 November 2004 |accessdate=2008-12-12 | location=London | first=Robert | last=Willoughby}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book, Harrold intertwines his personal experiences living and working in the country with the recent history of Korea.

In the early days, Harrold enjoyed his important status and the accompanying trappings of his work in [[North Korea]]. In addition to revising the words of President [[Kim Il Sung]], he was given a prominent position at ceremonial events. Moreover, he was relatively well-paid. This relatively high salary allowed for a social life that was closed to all but the other foreigners in [[Pyongyang]] and a small North Korean elite. Although his interaction with North Koreans was severely restricted, he did become acquainted with some of Pyongyang’s better off.

Harrold spent nearly seven years in [[North Korea]], during which time he had many unusual experiences that make fascinating reading. He also developed a relatively unique understanding of North Korean society.

Eventually, circumstances led to Harrold's being forced to leave the country. As a result, he was left with a deep sense of resentment toward [[North Korea]]. Looking back on his experiences, Harrold admits his earlier naïveté, when he believed that “international problems could best be resolved by ordinary people over a pint or two of beer (403).” In the end, he was critical of [[North Korea]]; nevertheless, he refused to blame the North Korean leadership for all the problems facing the country today, arguing that international actors, namely the United States, share the responsibility.

The '''demographics of Israel''' are monitored by the [[Israel Central Bureau of Statistics]]. The [[State of Israel]] has a population of approximately 8,855,000 inhabitants as of the first half of 2018.&lt;ref name="CBSPopulation2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.gov.il/reader/newhodaot/hodaa_template.html?hodaa=201711387|title=Population of Israel on the Eve of 2018 - 8.8 Million|last=|first=|date=31 December 2017|website=|work=Press Release|publisher=Israel Central Bureau of Statistics|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|accessdate=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 74.5% are [[Israeli Jews|Jews]] of all backgrounds (about 6,556,000 individuals), 20.9% are [[Arab citizens of Israel|Arab]] of any religion other than [[Judaism|Jewish]] (about 1,837,000 individuals), while the remaining 4.6% (about 400,000 individuals) are defined as "others", including persons of Jewish ancestry deemed non-Jewish by religious law and persons of non-Jewish ancestry who are family members of Jewish immigrants (neither of which are registered at the [[Ministry of Interior (Israel)|Ministry of Interior]] as Jews), [[Christian]] non-Arabs, [[Mawali|Muslim non-Arabs]] and all other residents who have neither an ethnic nor religious classification.

Israel's annual population growth rate stood at 2.0% in 2015, more than three times faster than the [[OECD]] average of around 0.6%.&lt;ref name="OECD_Statistics"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stats.oecd.org/|title=Population growth, OECD |year=2012 |publisher=OECD |accessdate=17 Feb 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; With an average of three children per woman, Israel also has the highest [[fertility rate]] in the OECD by a considerable margin and much higher than the OECD average of 1.7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/israel/OECD-SocietyAtaGlance2014-Highlights-Israel.pdf|title=Society at a Glance 2014 Highlights: ISRAEL, OECD |year=2014 |publisher=OECD |accessdate=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, population trends in Israel reflect distinct patterns of two sub-groups: Jews (around 74.71% of the population) and Arabs (20.7%).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbs.gov.il/publications/tec27.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Over the past decade, the [[Islam|Muslim]] annual population growth has fallen significantly, from around 3% to less than 2.2% by 2013,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbs.gov.il/reader/shnaton/templ_shnaton_e.html?num_tab=st02_01&amp;CYear=2013 Statistical Abstract of Israel 2013 - No. 64 Subject 2 - Table No. 1&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; while the overall Jewish growth rate rose from around 1.4% to 1.7%, primarily due to the expanding [[Orthodox Jewish]] sector.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/completingfertility/RevisedFriedlanderpaper.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The territory of Israel can be defined in a number of ways as a result of a complex and unresolved political situation (see table below). For example, whilst the [[Israel Central Bureau of Statistics]] defines the area of Israel to include the [[annexed]] [[East Jerusalem]] and [[Golan Heights]], and to exclude the militarily controlled regions of the [[West Bank]], the CBS defines the population of Israel to also include [[Israeli settlers]] living in the Area C of West Bank and the Muslim residents of East Jerusalem and Area C, who have Israeli residency or citizenship.

===Jews===
{{Main article|Israeli Jews}}
According to [[Israel Central Bureau of Statistics|Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics]], in 2008, of Israel's 7.3 million people, 75.6 percent were Jews of any background.&lt;ref name="CBS_month_pop"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.cbs.gov.il/publications13/yarhon0413/pdf/b1.pdf |title=Population, by Population Group |date=31 December 2013 |work=Monthly Bulletin of Statistics |publisher=Israel Central Bureau of Statistics |accessdate=17 Feb 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203172044/http://www1.cbs.gov.il/publications13/yarhon0413/pdf/b1.pdf |archivedate=3 February 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among them, 70.3 percent were [[Sabra (person)|Sabras]] (born in Israel), mostly second- or third-generation Israelis, and the rest are [[Aliyah|olim]] (Jewish immigrants to Israel)—20.5 percent from Europe and the Americas, and 9.2 percent from Asia and Africa, including the [[Arab world|Arab countries]].&lt;ref name="CBS_2008_jews_origin"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbs.gov.il/reader/shnaton/templ_shnaton_e.html?num_tab=st02_24x&amp;CYear=2009 |title=Table 2.24 -  Jews, by country of origin and age |accessdate=22 March 2010 |first=CBS |last=Statistical Abstract of Israel, 2009 |authorlink=Israel Central Bureau of Statistics |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Atheism====
The 2009 survey by the [[Guttman Center]] found the following distribution:
* Believing in the existence of God – 80%
* Not believing in the existence of God – 20%

Fertility rates between secular and religious Jewish groups also differ significantly.

===Arabs===
{{Main article|Arab citizens of Israel}}
[[File:Map of Arabic speaking localities in Israel.png|thumb|upright|Distribution of Arabic speaking localities in Israel|250px]]
Arab citizens of Israel are those Arab residents of Mandatory Palestine, who remained within Israel's borders following the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], and the establishment of the state of Israel. It is including those born within the state borders subsequent to this time, as well as those who had left during the establishment of the state (or their descendants), who have since re-entered by means accepted as lawful residence by the Israeli state (primarily family reunifications).

In 2006, the official number of Arab residents in Israel was 1,413,500 people, about 20 percent of Israel’s population. This figure includes 209,000 Arabs (14% of the Israeli Arab population) in East Jerusalem, also counted in the Palestinian statistics, although 98 percent of East Jerusalem Palestinians have either Israeli residency or Israeli citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbs.gov.il/hodaot2007n/11_07_084b.doc |title=Selected Statistics on Jerusalem Day 2007 (Hebrew) |date=14 May 2007 |publisher=[[Israel Central Bureau of Statistics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Arab Muslims====
Most Arab citizens of Israel are Muslim, particularly of the [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] branch of Islam. A small minority are [[Ahmadiyya in Israel|Ahmadiyya]] sect and there are also some [[Alawites]] (affiliated with Shia Islam) of [[Ghajar]] with Israeli citizenship. As of 2008, Arab citizens of Israel comprised just over 20 percent of the country's total population. About 82.6 percent of the Arab population in Israel was Sunni Muslim (with a very small minority of Shia), another 9 percent was [[Druze in Israel|Druze]], and around 9 percent was Christian (mostly [[Eastern Orthodox]] and Catholic denominations).

=====Bedouin=====
{{Main article|Negev Bedouin}}
The Arab Muslim citizens of Israel include also the Bedouins, who are divided into two main groups: the Bedouin in the north of Israel, who live in villages and towns for the most part, and the Bedouin in the [[Negev]], who include half-nomadic and inhabitants of towns and [[Unrecognized Bedouin villages in Israel|Unrecognized villages]]. According to the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)|Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], as of 1999, 110,000 [[Bedouin]]s live in the Negev, 50,000 in the Galilee and 10,000 in the central region of Israel.&lt;ref name="Bedouin Demographics"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/1990_1999/1999/7/The+Bedouin+in+Israel.htm |title=The Bedouin in Israel |last=Ben-David |first=Yosef |date=1 July 1999 |publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs |accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of Arab Bedouins of Israel practice Sunni Islam.

=====Ahmadiyya=====
The [[Ahmadiyya in Israel|Ahmadiyya community]] was first established in the region in the 1920s, in what was then [[Mandatory Palestine]]. Israel is the only country in the Middle East, where Ahmadi Muslims can openly practice their faith, which is not recognized as part of Islam by most Sunni and Shi'a denominations. As such, [[Kababir]], a neighbourhood on [[Mount Carmel]] in [[Haifa]], Israel, acts as the Middle East headquarters of the Community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haifatrail.com/haifa-trail-segment14-eng.htm#./images/sect-14/Haifa-Trail-Sect14-P1610817.jpg |title=Kababir and Central Carmel – Multiculturalism on the Carmel |accessdate=February 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.visit-haifa.org/eng/Kababir |title=Visit Haifa |accessdate=February 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unknown how many Israeli Ahmadis there are, although it is estimated there are about 2,200 Ahmadis in Kababir alone.&lt;ref name="israelandyou"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelandyou.com/kababir/ |title=Kababir |publisher=Israel and You |accessdate=February 17, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150130170337/http://www.israelandyou.com/kababir/ |archivedate=30 January 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Arab Christians====
As of December 2013, about 161,000 Israeli citizens practiced Christianity, together comprising about 2% of the total population.&lt;ref name="MFA2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/AboutIsrael/Spotlight/Pages/The-Christian-communities-in-Israel-May-2014.aspx |title=The Christian communities in Israel |website=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs |date=1 May 2014 |accessdate=3 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017004653/http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/AboutIsrael/Spotlight/Pages/The-Christian-communities-in-Israel-May-2014.aspx |archivedate=17 October 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest group consists of [[Melkites]] (about 60% of Israel's Christians), followed by the Greek Orthodox (about 30%), with the remaining ca. 10% spread between the Roman Catholic (Latin), Maronite, Anglican, Lutheran, Armenian, Syriac, Ethiopian, Coptic and other denominations.&lt;ref name="MFA2014"/&gt; 

=====Copts=====
Some 1,000 Israeli citizens belong to the [[Copts|Coptic]] community, originated in Egypt.

====Druze====
{{Main article|Israeli Druze}}
The Arab citizens of Israel include also the [[Druze]] who were numbered at an estimated 129,800 at the end of 2011.&lt;ref name="CBS_religion"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbs.gov.il/reader/shnaton/templ_shnaton_e.html?num_tab=st02_02&amp;CYear=2012 |title=Population, by Religion |date=11 September 2012 |work=Statistical Abstract of Israel |publisher=Israel Central Bureau of Statistics |accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the [[Druze]] living in what was then [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate Palestine]] became Israeli citizens after the declaration of the State of Israel. Though a few individuals identify themselves as "Palestinian Druze",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Balad's MK-to-be: 'Anti-Israelization' conscientious objector |first=Jack |last=Khoury |first2=Yoav |last2=Stern |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/balad-s-mk-to-be-anti-israelization-conscientious-objector-1.219514 |newspaper=Haaretz |date=2 May 2007 |accessdate=18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the vast majority of Druze do not consider themselves to be 'Palestinian', and consider their Israeli identity stronger than their Arab identity. Druze serve prominently in the [[Israel Defense Forces]], and are represented in mainstream Israeli politics and business as well, unlike Muslim Arabs who are not required to and generally choose not to serve in the Israeli army.

===Syriac Christians===

====Arameans====
{{Main article|Arameans in Israel|Maronites in Israel}}
In 2014, [[Israel]] has decided to recognize the Aramaic community within its borders as a national minority, allowing some of the [[Christianity in Israel|Christians]] in Israel to be registered as "Aramean" instead of "Arab".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/Flash.aspx/304458]&lt;/ref&gt; As of October 2014, some 600 Israelis requested to be registered as Arameans, with several thousand eligible for the status - mostly members of the Maronite community.

The [[Maronites|Maronite Christian]] community in Israel of around 7,000 resides mostly in the Galilee, with a presence in Haifa, Nazareth and Jerusalem. It is largely composed of families that lived in [[Upper Galilee]] in villages such as [[Jish]] long before the establishment of Israel in 1948. In the year 2000, the community was joined by a group of [[South Lebanon Army|Lebanese SLA]] militia members and their families, who fled Lebanon after [[Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon#Withdrawal from the security belt|2000 withdrawal of IDF from South Lebanon]].

====Assyrians====
{{Main article|Assyrians in Israel}}
There are around 1,000 [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] living in Israel, mostly in [[Jerusalem]] and [[Nazareth]]. Assyrians are an [[Aramaic]] speaking, [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Rite]] Christian minority who are descended from the ancient [[Mesopotamians]]. The old [[Syriac Orthodox]] monastery of Saint Mark lies in Jerusalem. Other than followers of the Syriac Orthodox Church, there are also followers of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] and the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] living in Israel.

===Other citizens===

====Samaritans====
{{Main article|Samaritans}}
The [[Samaritans]] are an ethnoreligious group of the Levant. Ancestrally, they claim descent from a group of Israelite inhabitants who have connections to ancient Samaria from the beginning of the Babylonian Exile up to the beginning of the Common Era. 2007 population estimates show that 712 Samaritans live half in [[Holon, Israel]] and half at [[Mount Gerizim]] in the West Bank. The Holon community holds Israeli citizenship, while the Gerizim community resides at an Israeli controlled enclave, holding dual Israeli-Palestinian citizenship.

====Armenians====
{{Main article|Armenians in Israel}}
About 4,000 [[Armenians]] reside in Israel mostly in Jerusalem (including in the [[Armenian Quarter]]), but also in Tel Aviv, Haifa and Jaffa. Armenians have a Patriarchate in Jerusalem and churches in Jerusalem, Haifa and Jaffa. Although Armenians of [[Old Jerusalem]] have Israeli identity cards, they are officially holders of [[Jordan]]ian passports.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce M. Davis. [http://www.cnewa.org/default.aspx?ID=548&amp;pagetypeID=4&amp;sitecode=HQ&amp;pageno=3 Jerusalem’s Armenian Quarter]. Catholic Near East Welfare Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Circassians====
{{Main article|Circassians in Israel}}
[[File:Circassians in Israel.Jpg|thumb|Circassians in [[Kfar Kama]]]]
In [[Israel]], there are also a few thousand [[Circassians]], living mostly in [[Kfar Kama]] (2,000) and [[Rehaniya|Reyhaniye]] (1,000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.circassianworld.com/Israel.html |title=Circassians in Israel |publisher=Circassian World |accessdate=5 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130416043854/http://www.circassianworld.com/Israel.html |archivedate=16 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These two villages were a part of a greater group of Circassian villages around the [[Golan Heights]]. The Circassians in Israel enjoy, like [[Druze]]s, a ''status aparte''. Male Circassians (at their leader's request) are mandated for military service, while females are not.

====People from post-Soviet states====
[[File:Russophone shop in Haifa.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Russophone]] shop in [[Haifa]]]]
Ethnic [[Russians]], [[Ukrainians]], and [[Belorussians]], immigrants from the [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet Union]], who were eligible to emigrate due to having, or being married to somebody who has, at least one Jewish grandparent and thus qualified for Israeli citizenship under the revised [[Law of Return]]. A number of these immigrants also belong to various ethnic groups from the Former Soviet Union such as [[Armenians]], [[Georgians]], [[Azeris]], [[Uzbeks]], [[Moldovans]], [[Tatars]], among others. Some of them, having Jewish father or grandfather identify as Jews, but being non-Jewish by [[Halakha]] (Jewish religion law), they are not recognized formally as Jews by state. Most of them are in the mainstream of Israel culture and are called "expanded Jewish population". In addition, a certain number of former Soviet citizens, primarily women of [[Russians|Russian]] and [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] ethnicity, emigrated to Israel, after marrying Muslim or Christian Arab citizens of Israel, who went to study in the former Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s.

====Finns====
Although most people of [[Finland|Finnish]] origin in Israel are [[Finnish Jews]] who immigrated to Israel, and their descendants, a small number of Finnish Christians moved to Israel in the 1940s before the independence and gained citizenship following independence. For the most part, many of the original Finnish settlers intermarried with the other communities in the country, and therefore remain very small in number. A [[Moshav shitufi]] near Jerusalem named [[Yad HaShmona]], meaning the "Memorial for the Eight", was established in 1971 by a group of Finnish Christian-Israelis, although today, most members are Israeli, and are predominantly Hebrew speakers, and the moshav has become a center of so-called "[[Messianic Jews]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.finland.org.il/public/default.aspx?nodeid=39222&amp;contentlan=2&amp;culture=en-US |title=Finnish associations&amp;nbsp;– Embassy of Finland, Tel Aviv |publisher=Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland |accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-02-07/features/9702070085_1_finland-germans-jewish-population |title=Readers Recall Heroic War Efforts |last=Landers |first=Ann |date=7 February 1997 |publisher=Chicago Tribune |accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bahá'ís====
The [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]] population in Israel is almost entirely made up of volunteers serving at the [[Bahá'í World Centre]]. [[Bahá'u'lláh]] (1817-1892), the Faith's founder, was banished to [[Acre, Israel|Akka]] and died nearby where his shrine is located. During his lifetime he instructed his followers not to teach and convert those living in the area, and the Bahá'ís descending from those original immigrants were later asked to leave and teach elsewhere. For nearly a century there has been a policy by [[Shoghi Effendi]] and later the [[Universal House of Justice]] to not accept converts from Israel. The 650 or so foreign national Bahá'ís living in Israel are almost all on temporary duty serving at the shrines and administrative offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ganbahai.org.il/en/learn-more/bahai-community/worldwide-community |title=The Worldwide Bahá’í Community |website=Bahai.org |access-date=2018-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nechemia Meyers (1995).

====Vietnamese====
The number of [[Overseas Vietnamese|Vietnamese people]] in [[Israel]] and their descendants is estimated at 150 to 200.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/35-years-on-where-are-israels-vietnamese-refugees/]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of them came to Israel in between 1976–1979, after prime minister [[Menachem Begin]] authorized their admission to Israel and granted them political asylum. The Vietnamese people living in Israel are Israeli citizens who also serve in the [[Israel Defense Forces]]. Today, the majority of the community lives in the [[Gush Dan]] area in the center of Tel Aviv, but also a few dozen Vietnamese-Israelis or Israelis of Vietnamese origin live in [[Haifa]], [[Jerusalem]], and [[Ofakim]].

====African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem====
{{Main article|African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem}}
The African Hebrew Israelite Nation of Jerusalem is a small spiritual group of [[African Americans]], whose members believe they are descended from the [[Ten Lost Tribes]] of [[Israel]]. With a population of over 5,000, most members live in their own community in [[Dimona, Israel]], with additional families in [[Arad, Israel|Arad]], [[Mitzpe Ramon]], and the [[Tiberias]] area. At least some of them consider themselves to be Jewish, but mainstream scholarship does not consider them to be of Israelite but of subsaharan African origin. Their ancestors were [[African Americans]] who after several years in [[Liberia]] migrated to Israel in the late 1960s and demanded that Israel give them citizenship in the state. When Israel refused, they relinquished their United States citizenship and de facto became stateless. After some deliberation, the Israeli government granted them citizenship. The African Hebrew Israelites, like the [[Haredim]] and most [[Israeli Arabs]], are not required to serve in the military; however, some do so, and they do receive social benefits from the state, including free health care. Most believe in a kind of Paleo-Judaism based on the Torah without the Oral Laws; however, at least one member of the community underwent a conversion to [[Orthodox Judaism]].

====Naturalized foreign workers====
Some naturalized [[foreign worker]]s and their children born in Israel, predominantly from the [[Philippines]], [[Nepal]], [[Nigeria]], [[Senegal]], [[Romania]], [[China]], [[Cyprus]], [[Thailand]], and [[South America]] (mainly Colombia).

===Non-citizens===

====African migrants====
{{Further information|Sudanese refugees in Israel|Illegal immigration from Africa to Israel}}
[[File:Meeting between Sudanese refugees and Israeli students.jpg|thumb|Meeting between Sudanese refugees and Israeli students, 2007.]]
The number and status of African migrants in Israel is disputed and controversial, but it is estimated that at least 70,000 refugees mainly from [[Eritrea]], [[Sudan]], [[South Sudan]], [[Ethiopia]], and the [[Ivory Coast]] reside and work in Israel. A count in late 2011 published in Ynet pointed out the number only in Tel Aviv is 40,000, which represents 10 percent of the city's population. The vast majority is living at the southern parts of the city. There is a significant population in the southern Israeli cities of Eilat, Arad, and Beersheba.

====Foreign workers====
{{Further information|Filipinos in Israel|Chinese people in Israel|Palestinian workers in Israel}}
There are around 300,000 foreign workers, residing in Israel under temporary work visas, including Palestinians. Most of those foreign workers engage in agriculture and construction. The main groups of those foreign workers include the [[Chinese people|Chinese]], [[Thai people|Thai]], [[Filipinos]], [[Nigerians]], [[Romanians]], and [[Latin Americans]].

====Other refugees====
Approximately 100–200 refugees from [[Bosnia]], [[Kosovo]], [[Iraqi Kurdistan]], and [[North Korea]] were absorbed in Israel as refugees. Most of them were also given Israeli resident status, and currently reside in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/israel-taking-in-aleppo-refugees-syria-war-assad-regime-evacuation-a7489116.html]&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2006, some 200 ethnic [[Kurdish refugees]] from Turkey resided in Israel as illegal immigrants, fleeing the [[Turkey-PKK conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;{{lang-he|טורקיה והכורדים: קלאב MAD}} [http://news.walla.co.il/item/967428]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Languages==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}
{{Main article|Languages of Israel}}
[[File:Masada road sign.jpg|thumb|140px|left|Road sign in Hebrew, Arabic and English]]
Due to its immigrant nature, Israel is one of the most multicultural and multilingual societies in the world. [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] is the official language of the country, and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] is given special status, while English and Russian are the two most widely spoken non-official languages. A certain degree of English is spoken widely, and is the language of choice for many Israeli businesses. Courses of Hebrew and English language are mandatory in the Israeli school system, and most schools offer either Arabic, French, Spanish, German, Italian, or Russian.

==Religion==
{{Main article|Religion in Israel}}
{{Religion in Israel chart}}
According to a 2010 [[Israel Central Bureau of Statistics]] study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Israel 2010: 42% of Jews are secular |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3890330,00.html |newspaper=Ynetnews |date=18 May 2010 |accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Israelis aged over 18, 8% of Israeli Jews define themselves as ''[[Haredi]]m'' (or ultra-Orthodox); an additional 12% are "religious" (non-[[Haredi]] Orthodox, also known as: [[dati leumi]]/national-religious or [[Religious Zionism|religious Zionist]]); 13% consider themselves "religious-traditionalists" (mostly adhering to Jewish [[Halakha]]); 25% are "non-religious traditionalists" (only partly respecting the Jewish Halakha), and 43% are "secular".

Due to the higher birth rate of religious and traditionalists over seculars, their share among the overall population is growing as time passes.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==Education==
{{Main article|Education in Israel}}
Education between ages 5 and 15 is compulsory. It is not free, but it is subsidized by the government, individual organizations (such as the Beit Yaakov System), or a combination. Parents are expected to participate in courses as well. The school system is organized into kindergartens, 6-year primary schools, and either 6-year secondary schools or 3-year junior secondary schools + 3-year senior secondary schools (depending on region), after which a comprehensive examination is offered for university admissions.

==Policy==
{{See also|Demographic threat#Israel}}
As Israel's continued existence as a [[Jewish state]] relies upon maintenance of a Jewish demographic majority, Israeli demographers, politicians, and bureaucrats have treated Jewish population growth promotion as a central question in their research and policymaking. Non-Jewish population growth and immigration is regarded as a threat to the Jewish demographic majority, and to Israel's security {{citation needed|date=October 2018}}, as detailed in the [[Koenig Memorandum]].

Israel is the [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories by population density|thirty-fourth most-densely crowded country]] in the world. In an academic article, [[Jewish National Fund]] Board member Daniel Orenstein, argues that, as elsewhere, overpopulation is a stressor on the environment in Israel; he shows that environmentalists have conspicuously failed to consider the impact of population on the environment, and argues that overpopulation in Israel has not been appropriately addressed for ideological reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Orenstein |first=Daniel E. |year=2004 |title=Population Growth and Environmental Impact: Ideology and Academic Discourse in Israel |journal=Population and Environment |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=41–60 |publisher=Springer Science+Business Media |doi=10.1023/B:POEN.0000039952.74913.53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Orenstein and Steven Hamburg.[http://www.watsoninstitute.org/news_detail.cfm?id=383 "The JNF's Assault on the Negev"]; ''The Jerusalem Report,'' 28 November 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Citizenship and Entry Law===
{{Main article|Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law}}
{{Update|inaccurate=yes|section|date=August 2012}}
The [[Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law]] (Temporary Order) 5763 was first passed on 31 July 2003, and has since been extended until 31 July 2008. The law places age restrictions for the automatic granting of Israeli citizenship and residency permits to spouses of Israeli citizens, such that spouses who are inhabitants of the West Bank and Gaza Strip are ineligible. On 8 May 2005, the Israeli ministerial committee for issues of legislation once again amended the Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law, to restrict citizenship and residence in Israel only to Palestinian men over the age of 35, and Palestinian women over the age of 25. Those in favor of the law say the law not only limits the possibility of the entrance of terrorists into Israel, but, as [[Ze'ev Boim]] asserts, allows Israel "to maintain the state's democratic nature, but also its Jewish nature" (i. e., its Jewish demographic majority).&lt;ref name="scotsman1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Arab spouses face Israeli legal purge |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/international/arab-spouses-face-israeli-legal-purge-1-1117832 |newspaper=The Scotsman |date=15 May 2006 |accessdate=18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics, including the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3152651.stm |title=UN blasts Israeli marriage law |publisher=BBC News |date=15 August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; say the law disproportionately affects [[Arab citizens of Israel]], since Arabs in Israel are far more likely to have spouses from the West Bank and Gaza Strip than other Israeli citizens.&lt;ref name="sfgate1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Israeli marriage law blocks citizenship for Palestinians |url=http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Israeli-marriage-law-blocks-citizenship-for-2599244.php |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |date=1 August 2003 |accessdate=18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the constitutional challenges to the Citizenship and Entry to Israel Law, the state, represented by the Attorney General, insisted that security was the only objective behind the law. The state also added that even if the law was intended to achieve demographic objectives, it is still in conformity with Israel's Jewish and democratic definition, and thus constitutional. In a 2012 ruling by the Supreme Court on the issue, some of the judges on the panel discussed demography, and were inclined to accept that demography is a legitimate consideration in devising family reunification policies that violate the right to family life.&lt;ref&gt;Mazen Masri, "Love Suspended: Demography, Comparative Law and Palestinian Couples in the Israeli Supreme Court", Social &amp; Legal Studies (2013) 22(3) 309-334.

===Soviet immigration===
{{Further information|1970s Soviet Union aliyah|1990s Post-Soviet aliyah}}
During the 1970s about 163,000 people of Jewish descent immigrated to Israel [[Aliyah from the Soviet Union in the 1970s|from the USSR]].

Later [[Ariel Sharon]], in his capacity as Minister of Housing &amp; Construction and member of the Ministerial Committee for Immigration &amp; Absorption, launched an unprecedented large-scale construction effort to accommodate the new Russian population in Israel so as to facilitate their smooth integration and encourage further Jewish immigration as an ongoing means of increasing the Jewish population of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pmo.gov.il/English/History/PastPMM/Pages/ArielSharon.aspx |title=Ariel Sharon |accessdate=20 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1989 and 2006, about 979,000 Jews emigrated from the former Soviet Union to Israel.

===Population growth rate===
* 2.0% (2016)

During the 1990s, the Jewish [[population growth rate]] was about 3% per year, as a result of massive immigration to Israel, primarily from the republics of the [[former Soviet Union]]. There is also a very high population growth rate among certain Jewish groups, especially adherents of [[Orthodox Judaism]]. The growth rate of the [[Arab citizens of Israel|Arab]] population in Israel is 2.2%, while the growth rate of the Jewish population in Israel is 1.7%. The growth rate of the Arab population has slowed from 3.8% in 1999 to 2.2% in 2013, and for the Jewish population, the growth rate declined from 2.7% to its lowest rate of 1.4% in 2005, before picking up since then {{when?|date=October 2018}} to 1.7%.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===Death rate===
* 5.3 deaths/1,000 population (2015 est.)

There were a total of 38,666 deaths in 2006. (39,026 in 2005 &amp; 37,688 in 2000). Of this 33,568 were Jews (34,031 in 2005 &amp; 33,421 in 2000). 3,078 were Muslims (2,968 in 2005 &amp; 2,683 in 2000). 360 were Druze (363 in 2005 &amp; 305 in 2000). 712 were Christian (686 in 2005 &amp; 666 in 2000).{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

===Net migration rate===
* 1.81 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2013 est.)

There were a total of 26,500 [[Immigration|immigrants]] who made [[Aliyah]] to Israel in 2014: 11,430 from the [[Soviet Union|Former Soviet Union]], 7,000 from France, 3,470 from the United States, 620 from the United Kingdom, 620 from [[Colombia]], 400 from Canada, 340 from [[Italy]], 300 from [[Brazil]], 297 from [[Argentina]], 240 from [[Belgium]], 232 from [[Eastern Europe]] (including 126 from [[Hungary]]), 200 from [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], 190 from South Africa, 120 from Germany, 76 from [[Mexico]], 70 from [[Venezuela]], 58 from [[Uruguay]], and 52 from [[Chile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishagency.org/blog/1/article/31301|title=Aliyah Hits Ten-Year High: Approximately 26,500 New Immigrants Arrived in Israel in 2014|date=2 January 2015|publisher=Jewish Agency For Israel|accessdate=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Emigration====
For many years definitive data on Israeli [[emigration]] was unavailable.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Kamm. "Israeli emigration inspires anger and fear;" ''New York Times'' 4 January 1981&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Israeli Diaspora'' sociologist Stephen J. Gold maintains that calculation of Jewish emigration has been a contentious issue, explaining, "Since Zionism, the philosophy that underlies the existence of the Jewish state, calls for return home of the world's Jews, the opposite movement—Israelis leaving the Jewish state to reside elsewhere—clearly presents an ideological and demographic problem."&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J. Gold. ''The Israeli Diaspora''; Routledge 2002, p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past several decades, emigration ([[yerida]]) has seen a considerable increase. From 1990 to 2005, 230,000 Israelis left the country; a large proportion of these departures included people who initially immigrated to Israel and then reversed their course (48% of all post-1990 departures and even 60% of 2003 and 2004 departures were former immigrants to Israel). 8% of Jewish immigrants in the post-1990 period left Israel, while 15% of non-Jewish immigrants did. In 2005 alone, 21,500 Israelis left the country and had not yet returned at the end of 2006; among them 73% were Jews, 5% Arabs, and 22% "Others" (mostly non-Jewish immigrants, with Jewish ancestry, from USSR). At the same time, 10,500 Israelis came back to Israel after over one year abroad; 84% were Jews, 9% Others, and 7% Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cbs.gov.il/reader/newhodaot/hodaa_template.html?hodaa=200701153 ICBS 2005 departures and returns]. Cbs.gov.il. Retrieved on 8 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics, as of 2005, 650,000 Israelis had left the country for over one year and not returned. Of them, 530,000 are still alive today. This number does not include the children born overseas. It should also be noted that Israeli law grants citizenship only to the first generation of children born to Israeli emigrants.

Jewish [[total fertility rate]] increased by 10.2% during 1998–2009, and was recorded at 2.90 during 2009. During the same time period, Arab TFR decreased by 20.5%. Muslim TFR was measured at 3.73 for 2009. During 2000, the Arab TFR in Jerusalem (4.43) was higher than that of the Jews residing there (3.79). But as of 2009, Jewish TFR in Jerusalem was measured higher than the Arab TFR (2010: 4.26 vs 3.85, 2009: 4.16 vs 3.87). TFR for Arab residents in the West Bank was measured at 2.91 in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2127.html |title=Total Fertility Rate |year=2013 |work=The World Factbook |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency |accessdate=5 April 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6JIy6Fu0l?url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2127.html |archivedate=1 September 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; while that for the Jewish residents was reported at 5.10 children per woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.cbs.gov.il/reader/shnaton/templ_shnaton_e.html?num_tab=st03_14x&amp;CYear=2012 |title=Fertility Rates, Average Age of Mother and Sex Ratio at Birth, by Selected Characteristics of the Mother |date=11 September 2012 |work=Statistical Abstract of Israel |publisher=Israel Central Bureau of Statistics |accessdate=20 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ethnic group with highest recorded TFR is the Bedouin of Negev. Their TFR was reported at 10.06 in 1998, and 5.73 in 2009. TFR is also very high among Haredi Jews. For [[Ashkenazim|Ashkenazi]] Haredim, the TFR rose from 6.91 in 1980 to 8.51 in 1996. The figure for 2008 is estimated to be even higher. TFR for [[Sephardim|Sephardi]]/[[Mizrachim|Mizrahi]] Haredim rose from 4.57 in 1980 to 6.57 in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.focusanthro.org/archive/2005-2006/katz0506.pdf |title=The Fertility Dynamic of Israel's Ultra-Orthodox Jews and Pronatalist Governmental Policy |accessdate=2007-11-18 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327083941/http://www.focusanthro.org/archive/2005-2006/katz0506.pdf |archivedate=27 March 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future projections==
In June 2013, the [[Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics|Central Bureau of Statistics]] released a demographic report, projecting that Israel's population would grow to 11.4 million by 2035, with the Jewish population numbering 8.3 million, or 73% of the population, and the Arab population at 2.6 million, or 23%. This includes some 2.3 million Muslims (20% of the population), 185,000 Druze, and 152,000 Christians. The report predicts that the Israeli population growth rate will decline to 1.4% annually, with growth in the Muslim population remaining higher than the Jewish population until 2035, at which point the Jewish population will begin growing the fastest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/peering-into-the-crystal-ball-how-israel-will-look-statistically-in-2035.premium-1.532152 Peering into the crystal ball: How Israel will look, statistically, in 2035]&amp;nbsp;– ''[[Haaretz]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the Central Bureau of Statistics projected that Israel's population would rise to about 18 million by 2059, including 14.4 million Jews and 3.6 million Arabs. Of the Jewish population, about 5.25 million would be ultra-Orthodox Jews. Overall, the forecast projected that 49% of the population would be either ultra-Orthodox Jews (29%) and Arabs (20%).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timesofisrael.com/half-of-israel-to-be-arab-ultra-orthodox-by-2059-projections/&lt;/ref&gt; It also projected a population of 20 million in 2065.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Report-Israels-population-to-reach-20-million-by-2065-492429&lt;/ref&gt;

Other forecasts project that Israel could have a population as high as 23 million, or even 36 million, by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.783515&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Diseases of affluence''' is a term sometimes given to selected [[disease]]s and other [[health]] conditions which are commonly thought to be a result of increasing [[wealth]] in a society.&lt;ref name=Ezzati05&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ezzati M, Vander Hoorn S, Lawes CM, Leach R, James WP, Lopez AD, Rodgers A, Murray CJ | title = Rethinking the "diseases of affluence" paradigm: global patterns of nutritional risks in relation to economic development | journal = PLoS Medicine | volume = 2 | issue = 5 | pages = e133 | date=2005 | pmid = 15916467 |pmc = 1088287 |doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.0020133 }} {{outdated-inline|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also referred to as the "Western disease" paradigm, these diseases are in contrast to so-called "[[diseases of poverty]]", which largely result from and contribute to human impoverishment. These diseases of affluence have vastly increased in [[prevalence]] since the end of World War II.

Examples of diseases of affluence include mostly chronic [[non-communicable disease]]s (NCDs) and other physical health conditions for which personal lifestyles and societal conditions associated with economic development are believed to be an important [[risk factor]] — such as [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]], [[asthma]], [[Coronary artery disease|coronary heart disease]], [[cerebrovascular disease]], [[Peripheral artery disease|peripheral vascular disease]], [[obesity]], [[hypertension]], [[cancer]], [[alcoholism]], [[gout]], and some types of [[allergy]].&lt;ref name=Ezzati05/&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;{{cite web |format=PDF |title=Rethinking "diseases of affluence |location=Geneva |publisher=World Health Organization |url=http://www.who.int/chp/chronic_disease_report/media/Factsheet4.pdf|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may also be considered to include [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] and other [[mental health]] conditions associated with increased social isolation and lower levels of psychological well being observed in many developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Luthar SS | title = The culture of affluence: psychological costs of material wealth | journal = Child Development | volume = 74 | issue = 6 | pages = 1581–93 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14669883 | pmc = 1950124 | doi = 10.1046/j.1467-8624.2003.00625.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these conditions are interrelated, for example obesity is thought to be a partial cause of many other illnesses.{{Citation needed|reason=Who said this? I thought obesity was caused by eating too much.|date=March 2014}}

In contrast, the diseases of poverty have tended to be largely [[Infection|infectious disease]]s,  or the result of poor living conditions.  These include tuberculosis, asthma, and intestinal diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Singh AR, Singh SA | title = Diseases of poverty and lifestyle, well-being and human development | journal = Mens Sana Monographs | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 187–225 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 22013359 | pmc = 3190550 | doi = 10.4103/0973-1229.40567 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Increasingly, research is finding that diseases thought to be diseases of affluence also appear in large part in the poor.  These diseases include obesity and cardiovascular disease and, coupled with infectious diseases, these further increase global [[Health equity|health inequalities]].&lt;ref name=Ezzati05/&gt;

Diseases of affluence started to become more prevalent in [[Developing country|developing countries]] as diseases of poverty decline, longevity increases, and lifestyles change.&lt;ref name=Ezzati05/&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO"/&gt; In 2008, nearly 80% of deaths due to NCDs — including heart disease, strokes, chronic lung diseases, cancers and diabetes — occurred in low- and middle-income countries.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2011/ncds_20110427/en/ ''New WHO report: deaths from noncommunicable diseases on the rise, with developing world hit hardest''.] Geneva, 27 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Top ten causes of death in high income/affluent countries ==

According to [[World Health Organization (WHO)|World Health Organization (WHO]]) the top 10 causes of deaths in the high income countries/ affluent countries in 2016 were from

# Ischemic heart diseases
# Stroke
# Alzheimer disease and other dementia
# Trachea, bronchus and lung cancer
# Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
# Lower respiratory infections
# Colon and rectum cancers
# Diabetes 
# Kidney diseases
# Breast cancer

Except for the lower respiratory infections all of them are [[non-communicable diseases]]. In 2016 WHO reported 56.9 million deaths worldwide, and more than half (54%), were due to the top causes of death previously mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/the-top-10-causes-of-death|title=The top 10 causes of death }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2015}}
Factors associated with the increase of these conditions and illnesses appear to be things that are a direct result of technological advances. They include:
*Less strenuous physical [[Physical exercise|exercise]], often through increased use of motor vehicles
*Irregular exercise as a result of [[office]] jobs involving no physical labor.
*Easy accessibility in society to large amounts of low-cost food (relative to the much-lower caloric food availability in a [[subsistence economy]])
**More food generally, with much less physical exertion expended to obtain a moderate amount of food
**Higher consumption of vegetable oils and high [[sugar|sugar-containing]] foods
**Higher consumption of [[meat]] and [[dairy]] products
**Higher consumption of refined flours and products made of such, like [[white bread]] or white noodles
**More foods which are processed, cooked, and commercially provided (rather than seasonal, fresh foods prepared locally at time of eating)
*Prolonged periods of little [[Physical exercise|activity]]
*Greater use of [[Alcoholic drink|alcohol]] and [[tobacco]]
*Longer [[Life expectancy|life-span]]s
**Reduced exposure to infectious agents throughout life (this can result in a more idle and inexperienced immune system as compared to an individual who experienced relatively frequent exposure to certain pathogens in their time of life)
*Increased cleanliness. The [[hygiene hypothesis]] postulates that children of affluent families are now exposed to fewer antigens than has been normal in the past, giving rise to increased prevalence of [[allergy]] and [[autoimmune disease]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davis|first1=Charles | name-list-format = vanc |title=The Hygiene Hypothesis|url=https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=155757|website=MedicineNet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diabetes mellitus==
[[Diabetes mellitus|Diabetes]] is a chronic metabolic disease characterized by increase blood glucose level. Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes. It is caused by resistance to insulin or the lack of production of insulin. It is seen most commonly in adults. Type 1 diabetes or juvenile diabetes affects mostly children. This condition is due to little or lack of insulin production from the pancreas.&lt;ref name=WHOdiabfact&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/diabetes|title=Diabetes|website=World Health Organization|date=October 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[World Health Organization|WHO]] the prevalence of diabetes has quadrupled from 1980 to  422 million adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/diabetes/en/|title=Diabetes programme|website=World Health Organization|access-date=2018-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/diabetes/global-report/en/|title=''Global report on diabetes''|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The global prevalence of diabetes has increased from 4.7% in 1980 to 8.5% in 2014.&lt;ref name=WHOdiabfact/&gt; Diabetes has been a major cause for blindness, kidney failure, heart attack, stroke and lower limb amputation.&lt;ref name=WHOdiabfact/&gt;

=== Prevalence in countries of affluence ===

The Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a report in 2015 indicating that more than 100 million Americans have diabetes or pre-diabetes. Diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in United States in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2017/p0718-diabetes-report.html|title=CDC Press Releases|date=2017-07-19|work=CDC|access-date=2018-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In developed countries like the United States, the risk for diabetes is seen in people with low socioeconomic status (SES).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Saydah S, Lochner K | title = Socioeconomic status and risk of diabetes-related mortality in the U.S | journal = Public Health Reports |volume = 125 |issue = 3 | pages = 377–388 | date =2010 |pmid = 20433032 |pmc = 2848262 | doi = 10.1177/003335491012500306 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Socioeconomic status is defined by the education and the income level of a person.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/pdfs/library/diabetesreportcard2017-508.pdf|title=2017 Diabetes report card }}&lt;/ref&gt; The prevalence of diabetes varies by education level. Of those diagnosed with diabetes:12.6% of adults had less than a high school education, 9.5% had a high school education and 7.2% had more than high school education.&lt;ref name=DiabetesStats2017&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diabetes.org/assets/pdfs/basics/cdc-statistics-report-2017.pdf|title=National diabetes statistics report 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Differences in diabetes prevalence are seen in the population and ethnic groups in USA. Diabetes is more common in non-Hispanic whites, who are less educated and have a lower income. It is also more common in less educated Hispanics.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/pdfs/library/diabetesreportcard2017-508.pdf|title=2017 Diabetes report card}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest prevalence of diabetes is seen in the southeast, southern and Appalachian portion of the United States.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; In the United States the prevalence of diabetes is increasing in children and adolescents. In 2015, 25 million people were diagnosed with diabetes, of which 193,000 were children.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; The total direct and indirect cost of diagnosed diabetes in US in 2012 was $245 billion.&lt;ref name=DiabetesStats2017/&gt;

In 2009, the [[Canadian Diabetes Association]] (CDA) estimated that diagnosed diabetes will increase from 1.3 million in 2000 to 2.5 million in 2010 and 3.7 million in 2020.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bird Y, Lemstra M, Rogers M, Moraros J |title = The relationship between socioeconomic status/income and prevalence of diabetes and associated conditions: A cross-sectional population-based study in Saskatchewan, Canada |journal = International Journal for Equity in Health |volume = 14 |issue = 1 |pages = 93 |date=2015 |pmid = 26458543 |pmc = 4603875 |doi = 10.1186/s12939-015-0237-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Diabetes was the 7th leading cause of death in Canada in 2015. Like United States, diabetes in more prevalent in the low socioeconomic group of people in Canada.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

According to the [[International Diabetes Federation]], more than 58 million people are diagnosed with diabetes in the European Union Region (EUR), and this will go up to 66.7 million by 2045. Similar to other affluent countries like America and Canada, diabetes is more prevalent in the poorer parts of Europe like Central and Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dspace.uni.lodz.pl:8080/xmlui/handle/11089/18794|title=Economic Development and spread of diseases of affluence in EU regions|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia according to self-reported data, 1 in 7 adults or approximately 1.2 million people had diabetes in 2014-2015. People who were living in remote or socioeconomically disadvantaged areas were 4 times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes as compared to non-indigenous Australians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports-statistics/health-conditions-disability-deaths/diabetes/overview|title=Diabetes Overview - Australian Institute of Health and Welfare|work=Australian Institute of Health and Welfare|access-date=2018-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia incurred $20.8 million in direct costs towards hospitalization, medication, and out-patient treatment towards diabetes. In 2015, $1.2 billion were lost in Australia's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) due to diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.adea.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Hannah-Carter-presentation.pdf|title=The economic consequence of diabetes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In these countries of affluence, diabetes is prevalent in low socioeconomic groups of people as there is abundance of unhealthy food choices, high energy rich food, and decreased physical activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Overweight_and_obesity_-_BMI_statistics|title=Overweight and obesity - BMI statistics - Statistics Explained|website=ec.europa.eu|access-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; More affluent people are typically more educated and have tools to counter unhealthy foods, such as access to healthy food, physical trainers, and parks and fitness centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Obesity as a self regulation failure : A disease of affluence that selectively hits the less affluent ?|url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Overweight_and_obesity_-_BMI_statistics|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Risk factors ===

[[Obesity]] and being overweight is one of the main risk factors of type 2 diabetes. Other risk factors include lack of physical activity, genetic predisposition, being over 45 years old, tobacco use, high blood pressure and high cholesterol.&lt;ref name=DiabetesStats2017/&gt; In United States, the prevalence of obesity was 39.8% in adults and 18.5% in children and adolescents in 2015-2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db288.htm|title=Products - Data Briefs - Number 288 - October 2017|date=2017-11-28|website=www.cdc.gov |access-date=2018-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia in 2014-2015, 2 out 3 adults or 63% were overweight or obese. Also, 2 out of 3 adults did little or no exercise.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports-statistics/health-conditions-disability-deaths/diabetes/overview|title=Diabetes Overview - Australian Institute of Health and Welfare|work=Australian Institute of Health and Welfare|access-date=2018-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the World Health Organization,  Europe had the 2nd highest proportion of overweight or obese people in 2014 behind America.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Overweight_and_obesity_-_BMI_statistics|title=Overweight and obesity - BMI statistics - Statistics Explained|website=ec.europa.eu|access-date=2018-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In developing countries ===

According to WHO the prevalence of diabetes is rising more in the middle and low income countries. Over the next 25 years, the number of people with diabetes in developing countries will increase by over 150%. Diabetes is typically seen in people above the retirement age in developed countries, but in developing countries people in the age of 35-64 are mostly affected. Although, diabetes is considered a disease of affluence affecting the developed countries, there is more loss of life and premature death among people with diabetes in the developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/diabetes/actionnow/en/DANbooklet.pdf|title=Diabetes action now}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asia accounts for 60% of the world's diabetic population. In 1980 less than 1% of Chinese adults were affected by diabetes, but by 2008 the prevalence was 10%.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hu FB | title = Globalization of diabetes: the role of diet, lifestyle, and genes | journal = Diabetes Care | volume = 34 | issue = 6 | pages = 1249–57 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21617109 | pmc = 3114340 | doi = 10.2337/dc11-0442 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is predicted that by 2030 diabetes may affect 79.4 million people in India, 42.3 million people in China and 30.3 million in United States.&lt;ref name="Kaveeshwar_2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kaveeshwar SA, Cornwall J | title = The current state of diabetes mellitus in India | journal = The Australasian Medical Journal | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 45–8 | date = 2014-01-31 | pmid = 24567766 | pmc = 3920109 | doi = 10.4066/AMJ.2013.1979 | doi-broken-date = 2018-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These changes are the result of developing nations having rapid economic development. This rapid economic development has caused a change in the lifestyle and food habits leading to over-nutrition, increased intake of fast food causing increase in weight, and insulin resistance.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Compared to the west, obesity in Asia is low. India has very low prevalence of obesity, but a very high prevalence of diabetes suggesting that diabetes may occur at a lower BMI in Indians as compared to the Europeans. Smoking increases the risk for diabetes by 45%. In developing countries around 50-60 % adult males are regular smokers, increasing their risk for diabetes.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In developing countries, diabetes is more commonly seen in the more urbanized areas. The prevalence of diabetes in rural population is 1/4th that of urban population for countries like India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan and Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name="Kaveeshwar_2014" /&gt;

==Cardiovascular disease==
Cardiovascular disease refers to a disease of the heart and blood vessels. Conditions and diseases associated with heart disease include: stoke, coronary heart disease, congenital heart disease, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and cardiomyopathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/chronic-cardio|title=Cardiovascular disease|last=Division|first=Australian Government Department of Health, Population Health|website=www.health.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2018-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cardiovascular disease is known as the world's biggest killer. 17.5 million people die from it each year, which equals 31% of all deaths. Heart disease and stroke cause 80% of these deaths.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/publications/10-year-review/ncd/en/|title=WHO {{!}} Noncommunicable diseases: the slow motion disaster|website=WHO|access-date=2018-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Risk factors===
High blood pressure is the leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease and has contributed to 12% of the cardiovascular related deaths worldwide.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt; Other significant risk factors for heart disease include high cholesterol and smoking. 47% of all Americans have one of these three risk factors.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; Lifestyle choices, such as poor diet and physical inactivity, and excessive alcohol use can also contribute to cardiovascular disease. Medical conditions, like diabetes and obesity can also be risk factors.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

===Prevalence in countries of affluence===
In the United States, 610,000 people die every year from heart disease which is equal to 1 in 4 deaths. The leading cause of death for both men and women in the United States is heart disease.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/facts.htm|title=Heart Disease Facts &amp; Statistics {{!}} cdc.gov|date=2017-11-28|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, heart disease is the second leading cause of death. In 2014, it was the cause of death for 51,000 people.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/heart-health/heart-diseases-conditions/surveillance-heart-diseases-conditions.html|title=Surveillance of heart diseases and conditions - Canada.ca| author = Public Health Agency of Canada |website=www.canada.ca |access-date=2018-09-29|date=2017-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, heart disease is also the leading cause of death. 29% of deaths in 2015, had an underlying cause of heart disease.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = McLennan W |date=April 1996 |title= The Product of the Australian Bureau of Statistics |journal=Australian Journal of Statistics |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=1–14 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-842x.1996.tb00359.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Heart disease causes one in four premature deaths in the United Kingdom and in 2015 heart disease caused 26% of all deaths in that country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bhf.org.uk/publications/statistics/cvd-stats-2015|title=British Heart Foundation, Cardiovascular Disease Statistics|last=|first=|date=2015|website=British Heart Foundation, Cardiovascular Disease Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People of lower socio-economic status are more likely to have cardiovascular disease than those who have a higher socio-economic status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Sheth T, Nargundkar M, Chagani K, Anand S, Nair C, Yusuf S |title = Classifying ethnicity utilizing the Canadian Mortality Data Base |journal = Ethnicity &amp; Health |volume = 2 |issue = 4 | pages = 287–295 |date =1997 |pmid = 9526691 |doi = 10.1080/13557858.1997.9961837 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This inequality gap has occurred in developed countries because people who have a lower socio-economic status often face many of the risk factors of tobacco and alcohol use, obesity as well as having a sedentary lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Filate WA, Johansen HL, Kennedy CC, Tu JV |title = Regional variations in cardiovascular mortality in Canada |journal = The Canadian Journal of Cardiology |volume = 19 |issue = 11 |pages = 1241–1248 | date =2003 |pmid = 14571309 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further social and environmental factors such as poverty, pollution, family history, housing and employment contribute to this inequality gap and to risk of having a health condition caused by cardiovascular disease. The increasing inequality gap between the higher and lower income populations continues in countries such as Canada, despite the availability of health care for everyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Lee DS, Chiu M, Manuel DG, Tu K, Wang X, Austin PC, Mattern MY, Mitiku TF, Svenson LW, Putnam W, Flanagan WM, Tu JV |title = Trends in risk factors for cardiovascular disease in Canada: temporal, socio-demographic and geographic factors |journal = CMAJ |volume = 181 | issue = 3–4 |pages = E55–E66 |date =2009 |pmid = 19620271 |pmc = 2717674 |doi = 10.1503/cmaj.081629 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alzheimer's disease and other dementias ==
Dementia is a chronic syndrome which is characterized by deterioration in the thought process beyond what is expected from normal aging. It affects the persons memory, thinking, orientation, comprehension, behavior and ability to perform everyday activity. There are many different forms of dementia . Alzheimer is the most common form which contributes to 60-70 % of the dementia cases. Different forms of dementia can co-exist.Young onset dementia which occurs in individuals before the age of 65 contributes to 9% of the total cases. It is the major cause of disability and dependency among old people.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dementia|title=Dementia|website=World Health Organization|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Worldwide, there are 50 million people who are suffering from dementia and every year 10 million new cases are being reported. The total number of people with dementia is projected to reach 82 million by 2030 and 152 million in 2050 .&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Prevalence in countries of affluence ===
According to CDC, Alzheimer is the 6th leading cause of death in U.S adults and 5th leading cause of death in adults over the age of 65. In 2014, 5 million Americans above the age of 65 were diagnosed with Alzheimer. This number is predicted to triple by the year 2060 and reach up to 14 million. Dementia and Alzheimer has been shown to go unreported on death certificates, leading to under representation of the actual mortality caused by these diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/aging/aginginfo/alzheimers.htm|title=What is Alzheimer's Disease?  {{!}} CDC|date=2018-10-02|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2000 and 2015, mortality due to cardiovascular diseases has decreased by 11%, where as death from Alzheimer has increased by 123%. 1 in 3 people over the age of 65 die from Alzheimer or other forms of dementia. Furthermore, 200,000 individuals have been affected by young onset dementia. In United States, Alzheimer affects more women than men. It is twice more common in African-Americans and Hispanics than in whites. As the number of older Americans increases rapidly, the number of new cases of Alzheimer will rise too .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/facts-figures|title=Alzheimers - dementia facts and figures|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

East Asia has the most people living with dementia (9.8 million) followed by Western Europe (7.5 million ), South Asia (5.1 million) and North America (4.8 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dementiastatistics.org/statistics/global-prevalence/|title=Global prevalence {{!}} Dementia Statistics Hub|work=Dementia Statistics Hub|access-date=2018-10-24|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2016, the prevalence of Alzheimer was 5.05% in Europe. Like in United States, it is more prevalent in women than in men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Niu H, Álvarez-Álvarez I, Guillén-Grima F, Aguinaga-Ontoso I | title = Prevalence and incidence of Alzheimer's disease in Europe: A meta-analysis | journal = Neurologia | volume = 32 | issue = 8 | pages = 523–532 | date = October 2017 | pmid = 27130306 | doi = 10.1016/j.nrl.2016.02.016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the European Union, Finland has the highest mortality among both men and women due to dementia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.stat.fi/til/ksyyt/2016/ksyyt_2016_2017-12-29_kat_003_en.html|title=Statistics Finland - 3. Deaths from dementia and Alzheimer's disease are increasing|last=Pajunen|first=Airi|website=www.stat.fi|language=en|access-date=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, over half a million people are living with dementia. It is projected that by 2031 the number will go up by 66% to 937,000. Every year 25,000 new cases of dementia are diagnosed .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://alzheimer.ca/en/Home/About-dementia|title=About dementia {{!}} Alzheimer Society of Canada|website=alzheimer.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dementia is the second leading cause of death in Australia. In 2016, it was the leading cause of deaths in females. In Australia 436,366 people are living with dementia in 2018. 3 in 10 people over the age of 85 and 1 in 10 people over the age of 65 have dementia. It is the single greatest cause of disability in older Australians .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dementia.org.au/statistics|title=Dementia statistics|last=Australia|first=Dementia|date=2014-08-07|website=www.dementia.org.au|language=en|access-date=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rates of dementia are higher for indigenous people. In people from the northern territory and western Australia the prevalence of dementia is 26 times higher in the 45-69 year old group and about 20 times greater in 60-69 year old group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/House_of_Representatives_Committees?url=haa/dementia/report.htm|title=House of Representatives Committees|last=7111;|first=corporateName=Commonwealth Parliament; address=Parliament House, Canberra, ACT, 2600; contact=+61 2 6277|website=www.aph.gov.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Risk factors in countries of affluence ===
The risk factors for developing dementia or Alzheimer's include age, family history, genetic factors, environmental factors, brain injury, viral infections,neurotoxic chemicals, and various immunological and hormonal disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gavrilova SI, Bratsun AL | title = [Epidemiology and risk factors of Alzheimer's disease] | journal = Vestnik Rossiiskoi Akademii Meditsinskikh Nauk | issue = 1 | pages = 39–46 | date = 1999 | pmid = 10078062 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-alzheimers/risk-factors?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=paidsearch&amp;utm_campaign=google_seoboost&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwo_HdBRBjEiwAiPPXpFw22ntYki2D0zLRxkWzITYSa1I6iaESspSdZMMgR9jXmIt0d6p_bRoCW9UQAvD_BwE |title=Alzheimer's causes and risk factors }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new research study has found an association between the affluence of a country, hygiene conditions and the prevalence of Alzheimer in their population. According to the Hygiene Hypothesis, affluent countries with more urbanized and industrialized areas have better hygiene, better sanitation, clean water and improved access to antibiotics.&lt;ref name=":113"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fox M, Knapp LA, Andrews PW, Fincher CL | title = Hygiene and the world distribution of Alzheimer's disease: Epidemiological evidence for a relationship between microbial environment and age-adjusted disease burden | journal = Evolution, Medicine, and Public Health | volume = 2013 | issue = 1 | pages = 173–86 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 24481197 | pmc = 3868447 | doi = 10.1093/emph/eot015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This reduces the exposure to the friendly bacteria, virus and other microorganisms that help stimulate our immune system. Decreased microbial exposure leads to immune system that is poorly developed, which exposes the brain to inflammation as is seen in Alzheimer's disease.&lt;ref name=":123"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/better-hygiene-in-wealthy-nations-may-increase-alzheimers-risk|title=Better hygiene in wealthy nations may increase Alzheimer’s risk|last=|first=|date=2013-09-04|work=University of Cambridge|access-date=2018-10-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Countries like the UK and France that have access to clean drinking water, improved sanitation facilities and have a high GDP show a 9% increase in Alzheimer's disease as opposed to countries like Kenya and Cambodia.&lt;ref name=":123"/&gt; Also countries like UK and Australia, where three quarters of their population lives in urban areas, have a 10% higher Alzheimer's rate than in countries like Bangladesh and Nepal where less than one tenth of their population live in urban areas.&lt;ref name=":123" /&gt;

Alzheimer's risk changes with the environment. Individuals from the same ethnic background living in an area of low sanitation will have a lower risk as compared to the same individuals living in an area of high sanitation who will be exposed to a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's. An African-American in U.S. has a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's as compared to one living in Nigeria.&lt;ref name=":113"/&gt; Immigrant populations exhibit Alzheimer disease rates intermediate between their home country and adopted country. Moving from a country of high sanitation to a country of low sanitation reduces the risk associated with the disease.&lt;ref name=":113" /&gt;

== Mental illness ==
People that face poverty have more risks related to having a mental illness and also do not have as much access to treatment. The stressful events that they face, unsafe living condition and poor physical health lead to cycle of poverty and mental illness that is seen all over the world.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; According to the World Health Organization 76%-85% of people living in lower and middle income countries are not treated for their mental illness. For those in higher-income counties, 35%-50% of people with mental illness do not receive treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/mental-disorders|title=Mental disorders|website=World Health Organization|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that 90% of deaths by suicide are caused by substance use disorders and mental illness in higher income countries. In lower to middle income countries, this number is lower.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

=== Prevalence of mental illness ===
One in four people have experienced mental illness at one time in their lives and approximately 450 million people in the world currently have a mental illness.&lt;ref name=":9"/&gt; People that face poverty have more risks related to having a mental illness and also do not have as much access to treatment.

The U.S. is reported to have the highest level of depression worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/estimates/en/index1.html|title=Disease burden and mortality estimates|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., approximately one in five adults has a mental illness or 44.7 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/mental-illness.shtml|title=NIMH » Mental Illness|website=www.nimh.nih.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, it was estimated that 268 million people in the world had depression.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ourworldindata.org/mental-health|title=Mental Health|website=Our World in Data|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The range of people that have depression by country is from 2% to 6% of the population with the United States, Greenland, and Australia having higher rates of depression. Anxiety disorders, such as generalized anxiety, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder impacted 275 million people around the world in 2016. The range of population impacted by anxiety disorders globally is from 2.5 %-6.5%. Countries, such as the Australia, the United States, Brazil, Argentina, Iran, the United States and a number of countries in Western Europe appear to have a higher prevalence of anxiety disorders.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

== Cancer ==
Cancer is a generic term for a large group of disease which is characterized by rapid creation of abnormal cells that grow beyond their usual boundaries. These cells can invade adjoining parts of the body and  spread to other organs causing metastases, which is a major cause of death. According to WHO, Cancer is the second leading cause of death globally. One in six deaths worldwide are caused due to cancer, accounting to a total of 9.6 million deaths in 2018.Tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer is the leading form of cancer deaths across most high and middle-income countries.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ourworldindata.org/cancer|title=Cancer|website=Our World in Data|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prevalence in countries of affluence ===
In United States, 1,735,350 new cases of cancer will be diagnosed in 2018. Most common forms of cancer are cancer of the breast, lung, bronchus, prostrate, colorectal cancer, melanoma of skin, Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, renal cancer, thyroid cancer and liver cancer. Cancer mortality is higher among men than in women. African-Americans have the highest risk of mortality due to cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/understanding/statistics|title=Cancer Statistics|website=National Cancer Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cancer is also the leading cause of death in Australia. The most common cancers in Australia are prostrate, breast, colorectal, melanoma and lung cancer. These account for 60% of the cancer cases diagnosed in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cancer.org.au/about-cancer/what-is-cancer/facts-and-figures.html|title=Facts and figures - Cancer Council Australia|last=Australia|first=Cancer Council|website=www.cancer.org.au|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Europe contains only 1/8 of the world population, but has around one quarter of the global cancer cases, with 3.7 million new cases each year. Lung, breast, stomach, liver, colon are the most common cancers in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/noncommunicable-diseases/cancer/data-and-statistics|title=Data and statistics|date=2018-11-06|website=www.euro.who.int|language=en|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall incidences among different cancers vary across countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://canceratlas.cancer.org/the-burden/cancer-in-europe/|title=Cancer in Europe|website=The Cancer Atlas|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About one in two Canadians will develop cancer in their lifetime, and one in four will die of the disease. In 2017, 206,200 new cases of cancer were diagnosed. Lung, colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer accounted for about half of all cancer diagnoses and deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cancer.ca/en/cancer-information/cancer-101/canadian-cancer-statistics-publication/?region=on|title=Canadian Cancer Statistics publication - Canadian Cancer Society|website=www.cancer.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Risk factors===
High prevalence of cancer in high-income countries is attributed to lifestyle factors like obesity, smoking, physical inactivity, diet and alcohol intake.&lt;ref name=":142"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ourworldindata.org/cancer|title=Cancer|website=Our World in Data|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 40% of the cancers can be prevented by modifying these factors. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=ttps://www.wcrf.org/dietandcancer/cancer-trends/data-cancer-frequency-country|title=Cancer trends|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Allergy/Autoimmune diseases ==
{{See|Allergy|Autoimmunity}}
The rate of allergies around the world has risen in industrialized nations over the past 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldallergy.org/UserFiles/file/WAO-White-Book-on-Allergy_web.pdf|title=WHO White Book on Allergy|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of public health measures, such as sterilized milk, use of antibiotics and improved food production have contributed to a decrease in infections in developed countries. There is a proposed causal relationship, known as the "hygiene hypothesis" that indicates that there are more autoimmune disorders and allergies in developed countries with fewer infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Okada H, Kuhn C, Feillet H, Bach JF | title = The 'hygiene hypothesis' for autoimmune and allergic diseases: an update | journal = Clinical and Experimental Immunology | volume = 160 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–9 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 20415844 | pmc = 2841828 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2249.2010.04139.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; In developing countries, it is assumed that the rates of allergies are lower than developed countries.

In 2007, Filipinos in Italy sent the equivalent of [[United States Dollar|US$]]500 million back to the Philippines, making it the fourth-largest source of [[remittances]] after the [[United States|U.S.]], [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.philfortune.com/index.php?cat_id=12&amp;news=350|title=International research institute studies Filipino Women’s remittances from Italy|date=17 April 2007|publisher=PhilFortune|accessdate=19 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The town of [[Mabini, Batangas|Mabini]] in [[Batangas]] has extensively benefited from Italian Filipinos; the town has the most former residents living abroad than any other Filipino town or city.&lt;ref name="IHT"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://carlosconde.com/2005/12/16/filipinos-count-cost-of-remittance-society/|title=Filipinos count cost of remittance society|last=Conde|first=Carlos|date=16 December 2005|publisher=IHT|accessdate=19 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of those living abroad work in Italy, and a section of Mabini today that has large homes built from remittance money is named "Little Italy".&lt;ref name="IHT"/&gt; However, due to the economic slump in 2008, remittance money from Italy grew at a much slower pace than usual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/business/12/15/08/remittances-rise-33-oct|title=Global slowdown drags October remittances to weakest pace|last=Rimando|first=Lala|date=15 December 2008|publisher=ABS-CBN News|accessdate=19 January 2009}}; Arnaldo Mauri, ''Remittances from Italy to developing countries'', Quaderni n. 12, 1996, Abstract [http://ssrn.com/abstract=837425]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Filipinos in Greece''' consist of migrants from the [[Philippines]] to [[Greece]] and their descendants. According to official Greek statistics, there were 5,000 Filipinos in Greece in 1991, which declined to 2,000 by 1996. In reality, there were many more [[illegal immigrant|working in the country illegally]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Iosifides|King|1999|p=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.dole.gov.ph/news/details.asp?id=N000000739 |periodical=DOLE News |title=Imson urges Greece-based OFWs to take advantage of new legalization rules |date=2004-06-13 |accessdate=2009-10-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160123092632/http://www.dole.gov.ph/news/details.asp?id=N000000739 |archivedate=2016-01-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Philippine community have set up a school for their children in downtown [[Athens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cañete|2004|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Migrants and the Philippine [[Department of Foreign Affairs (Philippines)|Department of Foreign Affairs]] protested to the Greek government about the dictionary.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0WDQ/is_1998_August_10/ai_53000395/?tag=content;col1|title=Philippines blasts 'Filipina' entry in Greek dictionary|date=1998-08-10|accessdate=2009-10-23|periodical=Kyodo News}} {{dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7730">Fisheries '''co-management''' is flexible and cooperative management of the aquatic resources by the user groups and the government.&lt;ref name="sen"&gt;Sen S., Nielsen JR. 1996. Fisheries co-management: a comparative analysis. Marine Policy 20(5):405–418.&lt;/ref&gt;

The responsibility of the resource is shared between the user groups and the government, both the community and the government are involved during the decision making, implementation and enforcement processes.&lt;ref name="sen" /&gt;

==Types of co-management==

Depending on the level of participation between the government and the community, five different types of co-management have been identified.&lt;ref name="sen" /&gt;
 
* Instructive
Instructive management is [[wikt:top-down|top down]] management from the government.&lt;ref name="sen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jen"&gt;Jentoft S., [[Bonnie McCay|McCay B.]] 1995. User participation in fisheries management: Lessons drawn from international experiences. Marine Policy 19(3): 227–246.&lt;/ref&gt; The government instructs the fishermen as to what laws and policies they are required to follow.&lt;ref name="sen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jen" /&gt; Information is only shared with the community towards the end of the planning process.&lt;ref name="sen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jen" /&gt;
 
* Consultative
In consultative management, the government consults with the community either through public hearings or advisory boards.&lt;ref name="sen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jen" /&gt; The government is not required to implement any of the suggestions or comments into the policy.&lt;ref name="sen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jen" /&gt; This consultation can also serve merely as a symbolic gesture rather than something that the government will necessarily implement.&lt;ref name="sen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jen" /&gt;
 
* Cooperative 
In cooperative management, there is a degree of co-management of the resource by the government and the user group.&lt;ref name="sen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jen" /&gt; The responsibility is shared by both parties. Certain areas such as access rules may be the responsibility of the user group.&lt;ref name="sen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jen" /&gt;
 
* Advisory
In advisory management, users decide what decisions should be made and advise the government as such, the government than endorses the decision.&lt;ref name="sen" /&gt;

* Informative
In informative management, the user group makes all of the decisions, and informs the government once they have decided.&lt;ref name="sen" /&gt;
 
==History of co-management==

Co-management developed due to an attempt to improve the success of fisheries management as many of the aquatic resources risked being or were already depleted.&lt;ref name="sen" /&gt; The aim was to involve the community in the decision making process so that there may be an increased adherence to the regulations set by the government.&lt;ref name="sen" /&gt;

The [[wikt:top-down|top down]] approach of fisheries management has frequently failed as it often goes against the community and their internal structure. Furthermore, the reason for the new governmental regulations and laws such as a decrease in [[total allowable catch]] (TAC) or [[catch per unit effort]] (CPUE) were often poorly understood by the community due to lack of education. Without proper enforcement or co-management the community would often disregard the law and continue as they previously were, often despite the detrimental impact this may have on the ocean.

==Difference between [[community management]] and co-management==

Co-management is different from [[community management]] as the government plays an important part in the decision making process.&lt;ref name="sen" /&gt; In [[community management]] the laws are generally not enforced as governmental laws, rather a community guide and framework,&lt;ref name="sen" /&gt; this can make prosecution difficult. In co-management the user group and the government develop laws and regulations together and works towards implementing them as a unit.&lt;ref name="sen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pom"&gt;Pomeroy RS., Berkes F. 1997. Two to tango: the role of government in fisheries. Marine Policy 21(5): 465–480.&lt;/ref&gt; If community based management forms part of national legislation, or developmental plans than it is classified as co-management.&lt;ref name="sen" /&gt;

==Advantages of co-management==

The community, specifically the users of the resource often possess knowledge that can aid the government in the decision making process, therefore co-management is the combination of scientific and traditional knowledge, this process ensures the best possible outcome.&lt;ref name="Jen" /&gt;
&lt;ref name="Pom" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Arm"&gt;Armitage D., Berkes F., Dale A., Kocho-schellenberg E., Patton E. 2011. Co-management and the co-production of knowledge: Learning to adapt in Canada’s Arctic. Global Environmental Change 21(3): 995–1004.&lt;/ref&gt; If the community is involved with and agrees on the new laws and decisions they are more likely to comply and may even aid in ensuring the new laws are enforced and maintained.&lt;ref name="Jenn"&gt;Jentoft S., [[Bonnie McCay|McCay BJ]]., Wilson C. 1998. Social theory and fisheries co-management. Marine Policy 22(4): 423–436.&lt;/ref&gt;

In dynamic environments conditions can vary at a rapid rate. The Arctic environment is a good example of a fast changing environment.&lt;ref name="Arm" /&gt; If a good co-management structure is already implemented, it allows for quick decisions and implementations based on the required modification.&lt;ref name="Arm" /&gt;

==Limitations of co-management==

Co-management is known to be time consuming, as one must spend time collecting surveys and gaining trust within the community.&lt;ref name="Trim"&gt;Trimble M., Berkes F. 2013. Participatory research towards co-management: Lessons from artisanal fisheries in coastal Uruguay. Journal of Environmental Management 128: 768–778.&lt;/ref&gt; Strong lines of communication between the government and the community is essential. Educating the community is often necessary so that more informed decisions can be made.&lt;ref name="Rod"&gt;Rodwell LD., Lowther J., Hunter C., Mangi SC. 2014. Fisheries co-management in a new era of marine policy in the UK : A preliminary assessment of stakeholder perceptions. Marine Policy 45:279–286.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the more isolated communities have a different language and communication can be slow and lack vital information.&lt;ref name="Arm" /&gt; Existing laws and policies may need to be altered, or new ones created so as to allow for the structure of co-management.&lt;ref name="Pom" /&gt;
Conflicting views and economic versus conservation issues appear to be some of the main limitations to a successful co-management process.&lt;ref name="Rod" /&gt; Lack of funding, data and resources are also main contributing factors to un-successful co-management.&lt;ref name="Rod" /&gt; Co-management requires constant communication and effort, and therefore long term sustainability can be difficult.&lt;ref name="Pom" /&gt;

Third party involvement such as [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGO’s), or student groups, often forms an essential part of a successful co-management.&lt;ref name="Trim" /&gt;

The '''Canada Gairdner International Award''' is given annually at a special dinner to five individuals for outstanding discoveries or contributions to medical science. Receipt of the Gairdner is traditionally considered a precursor to winning the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize in Medicine]]; as of 2018, 86 Nobel Prizes have been awarded to prior Gairdner recipients. 

Canada Gairdner International Awards are given annually in the amount of $100,000 (each) payable in Canadian funds and can be awarded to residents of any country in the world. A joint award may be given for the same discovery or contribution to medical science, but in that case each awardee receives a full prize.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gairdner.org/ Official Canada Gairdner International Award Web Site]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ghantasala Venkateswararao''' (4 December 1922 – 11 February 1974) was an [[Indian film]] [[composer]], [[playback singer]] known for his works predominantly in [[Telugu cinema]] and [[Kannada cinema]] and also in [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Malayalam]], [[Tulu language|Tulu]] and [[Hindi]] language films. In 1970, he received the [[Padma Shri]] award, India's fourth highest civilian award for his contribution to [[Indian cinema]]. According to ''The Hindu'' and ''The Indian Express'', Ghantasala was "Such a divine talent and with his songs he could move the hearts of the people." "Ghantasala's blending of classical improvisations to the art of light music combined with his virtuosity and sensitivity puts him a class apart, above all others in the field of playback singing"."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/mp/2003/02/11/stories/2003021100450100.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Honouring a legend | date=11 February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K.

Ranga Rao]] called "the most majestic voice", Ghantasala helped Telugu film music develop its own distinct character which remains unparalleled".

Ghantasala performed in the [[United States]], [[England]] and [[Germany]], and for the [[United Nations Organisation]]. The government of [[Andhra Pradesh]] marked the occasion of 25 years of his film career as ''Silver Jubilee Celebrations of Ghantasala'' in [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]] on 1 February 1970.

==Early life==
Ghantasala was born in 1922 into a [[Telugu]] speaking [[Brahmin]] family of Soorayya Ghantasala, a professional singer in [[Chowtapalli]], a village in [[Gudivada]] taluk of [[Krishna District]].&lt;ref name="andhrawishesh.com" /&gt; During his childhood, Ghantasala used to dance to his father's Tarangams. His father died when Ghantasala was a child, and he was brought up by his maternal uncle. He took formal music training from [[Patrayani Sitarama Sastry]], and joined [[Maharajah's Government College of Music and Dance]] in [[Vizianagaram|Vijayanagram]].&lt;ref&gt;V.A.K Ranga Rao. [http://www.ghantasala.info/theman/ghantasala-vak-rao.html Ghantasala (1922–1974)]. From the book ''Mee Ghantasala''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Ghantasala participated in the [[Quit India Movement]] of 1942, for which he was arrested and imprisoned for 18 months at the Alipore (Allipura) Jail, [[Bellary]].&lt;ref name="DH_Jail"&gt;P Satyanarayana Rao (26 April 2010) [http://www.deccanherald.com/content/66042/this-jailhouse-has-rich-past.html This jailhouse has a rich past]. ''Deccan Herald''&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving jail, he met [[Samudrala Raghavacharya]], who advised him to try his luck in the film industry as a singer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0710550/bio Ghantasala Venkateswara Rao]. IMDb&lt;/ref&gt; Ghantasala married Savitri, who lived in a village called [[Pedapulivarru]]. In that village, Ghantasala met lyricist [[Samudrala Raghavacharya]], who was impressed with his voice and inducted him into the Madras film industry. Before Ghantasala found fame, he was already an accomplished [[Carnatic music]] singer.

Ghantasala's first break as a singer came from [[All India Radio]]. Later on, Peketi Siva Ram from HMV studios recorded Ghantasala's private songs. Ghantasala debuted as a chorus singer and for a character role in ''[[Seeta Rama Jananam]]'' by Pratibha Films. After this, he worked with well-known music directors ''Gali Penchala'' and [[C. R. Subbaraman]]. Ghantasala's first film as a music director was ''Laxmamma''. He introduced the technique of changing the vocal pitch and diction to suit the actor singing the songs. Ghantasala was peerless at Padyam renderings and his way with the Telugu padyam was incomparable.

Producer [[Jikki Krishnaveni|Krishnaveni]] gave Ghantasala his first job as full-time music director for her film ''[[Mana Desam]]'', which was [[N. T. Rama Rao]]'s first film. It established Ghantasala as a music composer-cum-playback singer. He was the most prolific film composer and playback singer in Telugu cinema until the mid-1970s. He composed music for many popular Telugu movies, including ''[[Patala Bhairavi]]'', ''[[Mayabazaar]]'', ''[[Lava Kusa]]'', ''[[Pandava Vanavasam]]'', ''[[Rahasyam (1967 film)|Rahasyam]]'',''[[Gundamma Katha]]'', ''[[Paramanandayya Shishyula Katha]]'' and ''[[Pelli Chesi Chudu]]'', and also for popular Tamil and Kannada films in the 1950s and 1960s. Ghantasala sang for and directed the music for a Hindi film ''Jhandaa ooncha Rahe Hamara'' (1964).&lt;ref name="merinews.com"&gt;[http://www.merinews.com/article/homage-to-ghantasala/15789958.shtml Homage to Ghantasala].

==Background==
Hal LeSueur was born in [[San Antonio, Texas]], the second child of Thomas E. LeSueur (died 1938) and Anna Bell Johnson (died 1958). His older sister was Daisy LeSueur (1901/1902 – 1904), and his younger sister was Lucille Fay LeSueur, later the Oscar-winning film star [[Joan Crawford]]. After Thomas LeSueur had abandoned the family, Anna wed businessman Henry J. Cassin (1868–1922), who nicknamed Lucille "Billie". She was known for a while as "Billie Cassin". The family lived in [[Lawton, Oklahoma]], then moved to [[Kansas City, Missouri]], around 1916. Hal LeSueur moved from Kansas City around 1928 to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. He found work in the stock department at [[Metro Goldwyn Mayer|MGM]] in bit parts or as an extra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://okiemagazine.com/?p=3944|title=Lucille Was Here in Lawton|publisher=Okie Magazine|author=Don Blanding|date=November 10, 2012|accessdate=January 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriages==
He was married twice. His first wife was Jessie Burress (July 17, 1903 – December 2, 1977). They wed on October 21, 1922 in [[Kansas City, Missouri]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://search.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?gl=34&amp;gss=sfs28_ms_r_f-34&amp;new=1&amp;rank=1&amp;gsfn=jessie&amp;gsfn_x=0&amp;gsln=burress&amp;gsln_x=1&amp;msgdy=1922&amp;msgdy_x=1&amp;msgpn__ftp=Missouri%2C%20USA&amp;msgpn=28&amp;msgpn_x=1&amp;msgpn__ftp_x=1&amp;cp=0&amp;MSAV=1&amp;uidh=000|title=Biodata|website=ancestry.com|access-date=August 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (age given as 21) and divorced some time later on an unknown date. His second wife was Kasha Haroldi (March 31, 1907 – June 26, 1992), whom he married in 1931. Hal and Kasha LeSueur had one child, a daughter, named [http://www.californiabirthindex.org/birth/joan_crawford_lesueur_born_1933_1615155 Joan Crawford LeSueur] , who was named for Hal's sister (December 2, 1933 – December 15, 1999),&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.ancestrylibrary.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?gss=angs-c&amp;new=1&amp;rank=1&amp;msT=1&amp;gsfn=Joan+Crawford+&amp;gsln=Lowe&amp;MSAV=0&amp;uidh=57k&amp;pcat=34&amp;h=47860877&amp;recoff=4+5+6+17+18+30+42+43&amp;db=Numident&amp;indiv=1&amp;ml_rpos=2 Joan Fuller's dates of birth and death], Ancestry.com.

She won custody of their daughter. She remarried and became Mrs. Kasha Lowe; her daughter became Joan Lowe, the name by which she was known professionally, later Mrs. Joan Fowler.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

==Controversy==
On November 9, 1935, LeSueur was in a head-on collision at the top of [[Cahuenga Pass]]. The other car caught fire and the three people inside, Earl Gose, who was driving, his wife, Golda, and his unmarried sister, Grace, were pulled from the blaze. Their car burned to a charred hulk. LeSueur suffered severe cuts and bruises on his hands, face, arms and legs. The other people were also seriously injured. All were taken to a hospital in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]]. The injuries of Grace Gose proved fatal three days later. His mother, Anna, and his ex-wife, Kasha, accompanied him to the [[coroner]]'s [[inquest]] on November 15. Earl and Golda Gose were unable to appear. LeSueur testified that he was driving near the center of the highway when the other car suddenly pulled out from behind another car into his lane and he was unable to avoid the collision. The Coroner's jury exonerated him of blame for the crash, returning a verdict of accidental death.&lt;ref name="joancrawfordbest.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.joancrawfordbest.com/latimeshal3536.htm|title=The Best of Everything|website=Joancrawfordbest.com|accessdate=September 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1936, Earl and Golda Gose [[lawsuit|sued]] him, seeking $86,400 in damages. Golda, who was taken into court on a hospital stretcher, which was placed before the jury box, testified that LeSueur was driving on the wrong side of Cahuenga Boulevard when his car collided with theirs. LeSueur not only denied responsibility for the accident, but in his cross-complaint for $10,000 charged that the crash came about through Gose's negligent driving. The suit was then abruptly dropped, however, when a settlement was reached. LeSueur agreed to pay them $8,500, one tenth of what they had originally sought.&lt;ref name="joancrawfordbest.com"/&gt;

==Later years==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}
Tired of being an uncredited actor in the films on which he worked, he decided to try his hand at [[Theatrical makeup|make-up]] work at MGM for a while. When he left that job, he worked as a sporting goods salesman. LeSueur made one final movie appearance, playing a reporter in ''[[Jeanne Eagels (film)|Jeanne Eagels]]'' (1957), the only role for which LeSueur received screen credit. He made one [[television program|TV]] appearance in an episode of the series ''[[State Trooper (TV series)|State Trooper]]'', titled ''No Fancy Cowboys'', which aired on March 13, 1957. When he left the sporting goods business, LeSueur began working as a desk clerk at a Los Angeles hotel, and supplemented his income working as a switchboard operator at the motel where he lived.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Hal-LeSueur/6000000003495229310|title=Hal Hays LeSueur|last=|first=|date=|website=Geni|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Hal LeSueur died of a ruptured [[Vermiform appendix|appendix]] at General Hospital. He was interred in [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)|Forest Lawn Cemetery, Glendale, California]]. He was originally believed to have been 59 years old, but may have been 61. His sister reportedly sent him telegrams from New York to the hospital before he died, but did not attend his funeral.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.joancrawfordbest.com/hallatimesobit63.htm Hal LeSueur obituary], joancrawfordbest.com; accessed September 6, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7960">The '''Hampden Clubs''' were political campaigning and debating societies formed in [[England]] in the early 19th century as part of the [[Radicalism (historical)|Radical Movement]].  They were particularly concentrated in the Midlands and the northern counties, and were closely associated with the popular movements for social and political reform that arose in the years following the end of the [[Napoleonic wars]].  They were forced underground, and eventually disbanded, in the face of legislation and pressure from the authorities.

==Origins==
[[Image:Cartwrightjohn.jpg|thumb|200px|John Cartwright is usually regarded as the founder of the Hampden Clubs]]
The original Hampden Club was formed in London in 1812. [[John Cartwright (political reformer)|John Cartwright]] is generally regarded as the originator and founder, although evidence has been offered&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=Naomi C.|title=Communications: Major John Cartwright and the founding of the Hampden Club|journal=The Historical Journal|year=1974|volume=XVII|issue=3|pages=615–619|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=D046A3B2E08DCB15B5935130BA07E349.journals?fromPage=online&amp;aid=3228632|accessdate=30 August 2012|doi=10.1017/s0018246x00005318}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Cartwright's friend [[Thomas Northmore]] actually initiated the clubs.  [[Edward Blount (MP)]] was another founder member.  Cartwright certainly dominated the movement from 1813 onwards.  A former naval and militia officer with a long record of political activism, he toured northwest England to promote the idea of a forum for political debate among ordinary people . There had been no similar institutions since the [[London Corresponding Society]], which had disbanded in 1794.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web|title=Empire and sea power|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/timeline/empireseapower_timeline_noflash.shtml|work=British history timeline|publisher=BBC|accessdate=3 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The clubs were intended to bring together middle class moderates and lower class [[Radicalism (historical)|Radicals]] in the reform cause, and were named for [[John Hampden]], an English Civil War Parliamentary leader. 

In 1813 Cartwright was arrested in Huddersfield while promoting the Clubs.  He made a further promotional tour in 1815. 

The first Hampden Club outside London was formed in 1816 by William Fitton at [[Royton]]. Other clubs in the north-west soon followed; in [[Middleton, Lancashire|Middleton]] the radical weaver-poet [[Samuel Bamford]] started one.  Other clubs  were formed in [[Oldham]], [[Manchester]], [[Rochdale]], [[Ashton-under-Lyne]] and [[Stockport]].

==Activities==
Club members paid a penny per week subscription, and usually met weekly for political discussion and debate.  [[Radicalism (historical)|Radical]] pamphlets were read, and newspaper articles by prominent reformers like [[William Cobbett]].  Samuel Bamford describes the activities of club members in positive terms, emphasising them as a peaceful alternative to riot and destruction of property. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Hampden clubs were now established in many of our large towns, and the villages and districts around them.  Cobbett's books were printed in a cheap form; the labourers read them, and thenceforward became deliberate and systematic in their proceedings.  Nor were there wanting men of their own class, to encourage and direct the new converts.  The Sunday Schools of the preceding thirty years had produced many working men of sufficient talent to become readers, writers, and speakers in the village meetings for parliamentary reform.  Some also were found to possess a rude poetic talent, which rendered their effusions popular, and bestowed an additional charm on their assemblages; and by such various means, anxious listeners at first, and then zealous proselytes, were drawn from the cottages of quiet nooks and dingles, to the weekly readings and discussions of the Hampden clubs.&lt;ref name=Bamford&gt;{{cite book|last=Bamford|first=Samuel|title=Passages in the Life of a Radical|url=http://gerald-massey.org.uk/bamford/c_radical_(5).htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In January 1817, regional Hampden Clubs and similar political debating societies sent 70 delegates to a convention at the Crown &amp; Anchor tavern in [[Strand, London]], well known as a meeting-place of radicals.  The assembly was called by Cartwright and Jones Burdett, brother of [[Sir Francis Burdett]].  To avoid falling foul of the [[Seditious Societies Act]], the convention met in public session and described itself as a gathering of deputies from petitioning communities, discussing how to achieve constitutional reform.&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=E. P.|title=The making of the English Working Class|date=2002|publisher=Penguin Uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wording proposed by the Hampden Clubs' leadership included votes for all householders, electoral boundary reform and annual elections.  However, the moderates were outvoted by those who favoured more radical reforms, and there were angry words from those who felt the Clubs' plans had been hijacked by others. The final resolutions of the meeting carried no reference to the Hampden Clubs. Reports of the meeting in ''[[The Times]]'' criticised both the meeting and its outcome, and accused the delegates of attempting to overthrow the Constitution.&lt;ref name=Parolin&gt;{{cite book|last=Parolin|first=Christina|title=Radical Spaces: Venues of popular politics in London, 1790–c. 1845|year=2010|publisher=Australian National University E-Press|location=Canberra|url=http://epress.anu.edu.au/apps/bookworm/view/Radical+Spaces%3A+Venues+of+popular+politics+in+London%2C+1790%E2%80%93c.+1845/5621/ch05.xhtml#toc-anchor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Suppression and dissolution==
The clubs were regarded with suspicion by the authorities, which saw them as breeding grounds for the growing radicalism of the times.  On 9 February 1817 a secret Parliamentary Committee report concluded that the real object of the Hampden Clubs and similar institutions was to foment "an insurrection, so formidable from numbers, as by dint of physical strength to overpower all resistance".&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;Quoted in Lee, Christopher (1998). ''This Sceptred Isle''. London, Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt;  The government began to introduce legislation, such as the [[Seditious Meetings Act 1817]], and it became more difficult for political clubs to meet.  For example, the Birmingham Hampden Club, founded in September 1816 and boasting 300 regular attendees by the following January, had a moderate ethos and publicly condemned violence after a local riot, but struggled to find venues as publicans were pressured not to permit club meetings on their premises. Private rooms were found, but by April 1817, in an atmosphere of suspicion and with the government spy and ''agent provocateur'' [[William J. Oliver|Oliver]] active in the city, regular club meetings were suspended.&lt;ref name=VCH&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22971 |title=Political and Administrative History: Political History to 1832 |author=W.B. Stephens (Editor) |publisher=Institute of Historical Research |year=1964 |work=A History of the County of Warwick: Volume 7: The City of Birmingham |accessdate=31 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Manchester the movement's leaders were targeted by the city's deputy constable, Joseph Nadin, who arrested many of them, including Samuel Bamford, after the unrest of March 1817 and sent them to London in irons, where some spent months in prison before their release without charge.  With the Hampden clubs stifled, the Lancashire leadership formed the Patriotic Union Society, and it was this body that called the 1819 public meeting for political reform that became the [[Peterloo Massacre]].

'''Khumra''' are a Muslim community found mainly in the [[Rohilkhand]] region of [[Uttar Pradesh]] in India.  They are also known as '''Sangtarash''' and '''Hansiri'''. &lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Tribes and castes of North western provinces and Oudh by William Crooke page 278&lt;/ref&gt; A few were also found in [[Panipat]] and [[Karnal]] in [[Haryana]], most of whom are now found in Pakistan. They generally refer themselves as '''Khumra Shaikh'''. The community has been granted [[Other Backward Classes]] status in Uttar Pradesh.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;http://www.ncbc.nic.in/Pdf/Uttar%20Pradesh/Uttanpradesh-Vol1/21.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;


==Origin ==
The community was traditionally associated with the manufacture of millstones  (chaki in [[Urdu]]), which they then peddled throughout [[North India]] and [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]].  According to their traditions, they descend from the Muslim soldiers, who are said to have settled in India sometime at the start of Muslim rule in North India. &lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; Like other [[Indian Muslim]] artisan communities, they have suffered from a decline in their traditional occupation as a result of growing mechanization, and many are now involved in daily wage labour.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;


The Khumra speak Urdu, and the [[Khari boli]] dialect of [[Hindi]]. They are exclusively [[Sunni]], and claim to be of [[Shaikh of Uttar Pradesh|Shaikh]] status. They are found mainly in [[Rohilkhand]], in particular the districts of [[Bareilly District|Bareilly]], [[Bijnor District|Bijnor]], [[Moradabad District|Moradabad]] and [[Rampur District|Rampur]]. The Khumra are largely an urban community, occupying their own distinct quarters. A small number of Khumra are found in the [[Awadh]] region of Uttar Pradesh, mainly in the districts of [[Hardoi District|Hardoi]], [[Unnao District|Unnao]] and [[Sitapur District|Sitapur]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

== Present circumstances ==

The community is [[endogamy|endogamous]], and consists of several [[Baradari (brotherhood)|biradaris]], all whom inter-marry and are of equal status. Of the several biradaris, the main ones are the Bahmani, Ghori, Hataiwale, Quraishi, Multani, Nawabar, Pacchawi, Pathan, Siddiqi and Tayar. In theory, all the biradari members descend from a common ancestor. The biradari name is also used as there surnames. Their customs are similar to other [[Muslims of Uttar Pradesh|Muslim]]s artisan castes, and this includes the presence of a caste council, known as a '''biradari panchayat''', which deals with intra community disputes and acts as an institution of social control. Historically, the panchayat was extremely powerful, but this is no longer the case.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;


The Khumra in India have now set up an India wide caste association, the All India Khumra Hansiri/ Sangtarash Biradari, which acts as pressure group and community welfare organization. Many Khumra are involved in the manufacture of fans and mats from date leaves, grinding of stones and flour milling. Others are employed as industrial labourers or agricultural workers. Only a very small number own land, and are cultivators. The community has been granted [[Other Backward Class]] status, which allows it to obtain the benefit of a number of [[Government of India]] [[affirmative action]] programmes. &lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;


The Khumra of Haryana were mainly weavers, with peddling being a subsidiary occupation. They had much in common with the [[Bhatra]] [[Sikh]]s, whom they competed with, especially in the canal colonies of the Punjab. Like other Muslim communities of Haryana, they were expelled at the time of [[partition of India|partition]], and ended up settling in [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Pakistani Punjab]]. They now been assimilated by the [[Momin Ansari|Ansaris]], a much larger weaving caste.&lt;ref&gt;Tribes and castes of Punjab and North West Frontier Province by H. A Rose&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3374">The '''Latvian Red Cross''' ({{Lang-lv|Latvijas Sarkanais Krusts}}) is a [[non-governmental]] [[non-profit]] volunteer-led [[humanitarian organization]], and the national [[Red Cross Society]] in [[Latvia]].

The Latvian Red Cross was established 20 November 1918 in [[Riga]],&lt;ref name="Pētersone"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Inta Pētersone |title=Latvijas Brīvības cīņas 1918-1920 : enciklopēdija. |language=Latvian |publisher=Preses nams |pages=192–193 |location=Riga |year=1999 |isbn=9984003957 |oclc=43426410}}&lt;/ref&gt; only two days after the [[Proclamation Day of the Republic of Latvia|proclamation of the independent Republic of Latvia]]. During the earliest time of the Latvian republic, the Latvian Red Cross took care of [[refugee]]s and [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] of the recently ended World War I. During the [[Latvian War of Independence]] the Latvian Red Cross also aided the wounded and sick. In the beginning of 1919 the Latvian Red Cross operated hospitals in [[Jelgava]], [[Liepāja]], [[Valka]] and [[Rūjiena]]; in the second half of 1919 — Riga, [[Pļaviņas]], [[Smiltene]] and [[Gulbene]]. The Latvian Red Cross was recognized by the [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent]] in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.redcross.lv/en/about-us/ |title=About us |publisher=''Latvian Red Cross'' |accessdate=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938 the Latvian Red Cross had 3,500 members, 10 hospitals with 1,000 beds, [[tuberculosis sanatorium]]s in [[Tērvete]], [[Krimulda]], Liepāja and [[Cēsis]] with room for 800 clients. It also had 92 [[health care]] units, 159 [[ambulance]]s, 10 [[Emergency medical services|emergency stations]], three [[Pharmacy|pharmacies]], two [[nursing school]]s, a storage facility and an orthopedic workshop.

The economy of the Latvian Red Cross was mainly supported by sales of [[lottery ticket]]s, a state monopoly on the sale of [[playing card]]s, a surcharge to railway tickets and [[donation]]s. Heads of the Latvian Red Cross were professor, surgeon  [[Jānis Jankovskis]] (1918–25), doctor [[Kārlis Kasparsons]] (1926–29) and dentist [[Kārlis Barons]] (1930–40).&lt;ref name="Pētersone"/&gt;

The Latvian Red Cross was [[Liquidation|liquidated]] after the [[Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940]]. Initially operations resumed after the [[German occupation of Latvia during World War II|German occupation of Latvia in 1941]], but were interrupted later by the German authorities. The Latvian Red Cross was restored 1945 in exile after World War II ended. It was restored in wartorn Germany by Latvian refugees, headquarters were in [[Münster]].

On 26 April 1991 the 11th Latvian Red Cross congress took place in Riga. At this congress it was proclaimed, that the current Latvian Red Cross is the only juridical successor of the 1918 founded organization.&lt;ref name="Pētersone"/&gt;

{{Crossdressing}}
The term "[[transgender]]" is multi-faceted and complex, especially where consensual and precise definitions have not yet been reached. While often the best way to find out how  [[person|people]] identify themselves is to ask them, not all persons who might be thought of as falling under the transgender 'umbrella' identify as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Sally Hines|editor2=Tam Sanger|date=2010|title=Transgender Identities: Towards a Social Analysis of Gender Diversity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UrVB2H5jDswC|isbn=978-0-415-99930-4|publisher=Routledge|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Transgender'' can also be distinguished from ''[[intersex]]'', a term for people born with physical sex characteristics "that do not fit typical binary notions of [[male]] or [[female]] bodies".&lt;ref name="unfe-fact"&gt;{{Cite web| author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; | publisher = United Nations [[Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]] | title = Free &amp; Equal Campaign Fact Sheet: Intersex| date = 2015| url = https://unfe.org/system/unfe-65-Intersex_Factsheet_ENGLISH.pdf | access-date = June 8, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Books and articles written about transgender people or [[culture]] are often outdated by the time they are published, if not already outdated at the time of composition, due to inappropriate and/or outdated questions or premises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lev|first=Arlene Istar|date=2004|title=Transgender Emergence: Therapeutic Guidelines for Working with Gender-Variant People and Their Families|authorlink=Arlene Istar Lev|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mwYsBgAAQBAJ|isbn=978-0-7890-21175|publisher=Routledge|page=241}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Psychology]], [[medicine]], and [[social science]]s research, aid, or otherwise interact with or study about transgender people. Each field starts from a different point of view, offers different perspectives, and uses different nomenclature. This difference is mirrored by the attitude of transgender people as regards transgender issues, which can be seen in the articles listed below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Ruthellen Josselson|editor2=Michele Harway|date=2012|title=Navigating Multiple Identities: Race, Gender, Culture, Nationality, and Roles|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=09hoAgAAQBAJ|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-973207-4|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dhut magar''' ({{lang-ne|[[:ne:मगर भाषा|मगर भाषा]]}} Dhut m''agar bhasa'') is a language spoken mainly in [[Nepal]], Southern Bhutan, [[Darjeeling]], India, and [[Sikkim]], [[India]], by the [[Magar people]]. It is divided into two groups (Eastern and Western) and further dialect divisions give distinct tribal identity.&lt;ref name=dialect&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.global12project.com/2004/profiles/p_code2/974.html |title=The Eastern Magar of Nepal  |accessdate=2007-09-12 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070318061151/http://www.global12project.com/2004/profiles/p_code2/974.html |archivedate = 2007-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Nepal 788,530 people speak the language.

While the government of Nepal developed Magar language curricula, as provisioned by constitution, the teaching materials have never successfully reached Magar schools, where most school instruction is in [[Nepali language]].&lt;ref name=government&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ogmios.org/204.htm |title=Mother Tongue Education for Social Inclusion and Conflict Resolution |author=B.

Dhut Magar language is sometimes lumped with [[Kham language|Kham magar language]] spoken further west in Bheri, Dhaulagiri, Karnali and Rapti zones.  Although the two languages have a large number of words in common, they have major structural differences and are not mutually intelligible.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thlib.org/static/reprints/contributions/CNAS_20_02_02.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16048">'''Metropolitan Reticular Matrix Planning''' (also known as 'CT' planning - see below) is an approach to managing the growth of [[Metropolitan area|metropolises]]. It is a type of [[regional planning]], as it deals with issues beyond strict city limits. It was first applied to the [[Madrid Metropolitan Plan]] in 1996 and has since been applied to a number of other metropolises.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asambleamadrid.es/Resources/Ficheros/C1/BOAM/BOAM/BOAM_4_00106.pdf Madrid Community Formal Approval (Spanish)]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reticular Matrix Planning methodology==
The methodology has two principal components: linearity and scale.

===Linear-based metropolises===
Metropolitan Reticular Matrix Planning detected that, counter to [[Walter Christaller|Walter Christaller’s]] [[Central place theory|Central Place Theory]], metropolises and urban systems do not exist in ‘featureless plains’. This notion is the precondition to the application of Christaller's theory.&lt;ref&gt;Christaller, Walter (1933): ''Die zentralen Orte in Süddeutschland''. Gustav Fischer, Jena.&lt;/ref&gt; To the contrary, Metropolitan Reticular Matrix Planning analyzes that most metropolises develop in a particular geographical site, a strategic location for economic and social relations.&lt;ref&gt;Febvre, Lucien (1925): ''A Geographical Introduction to History''. in collaboration with Lionel Bataillon, London. (Originally published in Paris in 1922 as ''La Terre et l'évolution humaine : introduction géographique à l'histoire''.)&lt;/ref&gt; A strategic location is one that has a [[comparative advantage]] mostly related to a point of transition between two geographical systems: the comparative advantage at the border between two ecosystems.

Strategic locations are places like [[Port|seaports]], river crossings, mountain passages or [[foothills]]. Often each ecosystem requires a different [[mode of transport]]ation. The geographical comparative advantage that requires a logistic intermodal node has been the economic and social base on which metropolises grow.

Geographical features are most commonly linear: a coast, river, ridge, etc. Metropolises are thus naturally determined by a linear direction inconsistent with the circular or hexagonal approach taken by Christaller’s theories and most common historical [[urban planning]].

The proper response to linearity is the development of a gradient approach: parallel lines to the main linear feature produce a transversal force gradient. The reticula vertebrates the system in a natural way and responds to the location needs better than the hexagonal or orbital systems.

===Metropolitan scales===
As an aggregation of urban units, the metropolis has a different scale. The integration of the urban and metropolitan scales is the focus of most metropolitan planning conflicts. A scale dialogue has to be articulated. It builds beyond the urban (1:5,000) and metropolitan (1:50,000) scales upwards to the national (1:500,000) and continental (1:5,000,000), as well as downwards to the urban design (1:500) and architecture (1:50) scales.
[[File:Reticular Matrix Chessboard Analogy.jpg|thumb|The paradigm shift from radial-orbital to Reticular-Matrix means changing the metropolitan game from darts (aiming for the center) to chess (diverse location strategies).]]

==='Chess on a Tripod'===
[[File:The Tripod of Reticular Matrix planning.jpg|thumb|Metropolitan planning requires equilibrium among environmental sustainability, social equity and economic efficiency objectives.]]
Metropolitan Reticular Matrix Planning has been described as the ‘Chess on a Tripod’ (CT) Method. The Method consists of two principles:

'''Chess''': (Also called Chessboard Planning) The Grey infrastructure (transportation) reticula form the basic chessboard pattern. Every municipality located in the core of this cellular structure plays a different role in the metropolitan system. The role played, decided in dialogue between the municipality and the regional-metropolitan authority, can be visualized as the role of the pieces in the Chess Game.

*King (Central Historic district)
*Queen (Main Productive Infrastructure: port/airport)
*Towers (Main secondary metropolitan centers)
*Bishops (Industrial and entrepreneurial productive fabric)
*Horses (Territorial Sub-centers)
*Pawns (Residential municipalities).

As in Chess, the location of these figures (which represent metropolitan functions) determines the results of the 'game,' i.e. control of the territory and the capacity to build up an economically efficient, socially equitable and environmentally sustainable metropolis.

'''Tripod''': The development of a metropolis is based on a three-legged system: economy, sociology and environment. The three legs are under the control of the governance system, which is what unites the policy making of the three realms.&lt;ref name="Spangenberg"&gt;Spangenberg J.H.; Omann I.; Hinterberger F: (September 2002). "Sustainable growth criteria - Minimum benchmarks and scenarios for employment and the environment." ''Ecological Economics'' Volume 42, Number 3, pp. 429-443(15).&lt;/ref&gt; The stool represents the government and the three legs constitute the tripod.

The objective of economic policies is to achieve efficiency. The objective of social policies is to achieve equity. The objective of [[Environmental planning|environmental policies]] is to achieve sustainability (often involving implementing [[Green infrastructure]]. The objective of institutional governance is to achieve equilibrium (‘Ethical Equilibrium’) among the three areas.&lt;ref name="Spangenberg" /&gt;

It is upon this tripod mechanism that metropolitan planning must evolve its spatial integrative policies to maintain the efficiency, equity, sustainability and equilibrium in the 5 subsystems (Environment, [[Regional Transportation Plan|Transport]], Housing, Productive Activities and Social Facilities) that constitute the metropolitan system.

===Mechanisms===
The mechanisms of the CT planning method require dialogue beyond that among the 3 legs of the stool, the Fabric and Form, and the 5 sub-systems. There are other realms of metropolitan decision making dialogues included in the method:
[[File:Madrid Plan Indicative.jpg|thumb|Dialogue between administrations produced metropolitan strategic projects for investment and implementation within the metropolitan vision of the Madrid Plan.]]
*'''Long''': The CT method suggests that metropolitan planning deal with long term strategic issues (20 or even 40 year horizons, rather than the 12 year horizons of urban planning).
*'''Wide''': The CT Method suggests that metropolitan planning does not just deal with the physical layout approach of most of urban planning. It has to incorporate economics, sociology and governance to deal with the complexity of the future evolution of the Metropolis and effectively contribute to its development.
*'''Indicative''': The method is an indicative approach to consensus building rather than a compulsory method. As such, it is more based in social capital continuous policy making and consensus building versus formal administrative blueprint planning. Because many layers of government (and other stakeholders) are involved in metropolitan planning, decision making is so dispersed that no government layer can impose through a compulsory plan the policies to be implemented by the other autonomous and independent authorities.
*'''Synchronic consensus''': Under the indicative umbrella, two types of consensus have to be achieved. The consensus among the existing authorities of different rank and level has to be achieved to put forward consistent policies among those authorities. This ‘just in time’ consensus is called ‘Synchronic Consensus.’ It is the actual consensus among the stakeholders and authorities involved in the development process.
*'''Diachronic consensus''': The long term vision of metropolitan planning requires not only an immediate consensus with the responsible authorities and stakeholders, but also a long-term consensus with future authorities (as far as 20–40 years away). This is called ‘Diachronic consensus.’ As it is impossible to know in a democratic system who those authorities will be, the way to achieve this consensus is both by having a permanent dialogue with the existing representatives of the political parties which are most likely to form those future governments and to have a system of planning that will allow for adaptation as those successive governments come to place. Flexibility and adaptability, represented in the Variable Geometry and Sliding Horizon mechanisms (below) are a way of proving to future governments that there is no intention of imposing a metropolitan plan upon them and that the plan is prepared for the dialogue of receiving their adaptations and revisions.
[[File:'The Form' in Reticular Matrix planning.svg|thumb|Madrid’s form, as highlighted by the Metropolitan Plan. Diagrammatic structure is unique for every metropolis and constitutes the base for strategic projection.]]
*'''Variable Geometry''': In the CT Method, the average plan spans 24 years. When forecasting is done for such a long period the variables are so uncertain that any specific extrapolation is likely to be inaccurate. The response is to have a flexible approach to the conclusions resulting from those extrapolations both to be able to respond to the needs forecasted but also to adapt if there are major variations or shift in tendencies.
[[File:'The Fabric' Balanced Urban Development unit.svg|thumb|The Balanced Urban Development unit is the model for the land use allocation of the basic urban fabric (1:5,000). The model is adapted in each case to the urban specificities.]]
*'''Sliding Horizon''': Taking the average plan (24 years) as an example, another consideration arises. Every new Government has the possibility to revise it (Diachronic Consensus) and adapt it (Variable Geometry). As it does (say, every 4 years) the scope of the plan and its final horizon shortens. In the final phase, when the plan is revised for the last time, 20 years after continuous implementation and 4 years before the end, the scope would only be 4 years. The long term horizon would be lost. In order to maintain a strategic, long-term vision necessary for adequate metropolitan planning, the Plan has to be revised/adapted every 4 years, but the horizon (24 years, in this example) should remain the constant. With every revision the horizon should be prolonged to always keep the 24 year vision. This periodical slide of the system into the future keeping the 24 year time frame every 4 years is called the ‘Sliding Horizon.’
*'''Reticular Matrix''': The geo-topographical directionality defined by the linear ecosystem border generates a reticular gradient parallel and perpendicular to that line. The cells of the reticula constitute a matrix of urban features.
#'''Form''': The roles and relations of the cells, as the way to address those relations, constitute the Form of the Metropolis (1:50,000 scale).
#'''Fabric''': The distributions of functions (either following the Balanced Urban Development model or presenting peculiarities depending on the role they play in the Form Structure) constitute the Urban Fabric (1:5,000 Scale). Through the change of scale and the formation of new relations, the new built form type, the fabric experiences a deep typological reform and is conceptually metamorphosed.
The Reticula, like a music pentagram, are the structural framework to hold the notes. The cells of the Matrix are the substantive units. They constitute the uniqueness of metropolitan space: the [[architecture]] of the metropolis.

==Difference from urban planning==
The elements of the CT Method (mentioned above) make it a markedly different system than the common methodologies of urban planning.

*'''Urban Planning''' relates the rights and dues of the population (land ownership and its rights) to the urban structure under the responsibility of the Local Authority. Urban Planning is the dialogue between the Local Authority and the Citizens.
*'''Metropolitan Planning''' is different in the fact that it does not relate a single administration with its citizens; it relates the different administrations of a complex territory among themselves to build up a common and consistent strategy for the territory under their shared responsibilities.

The CT Method argues that while urban planning relates the administration (local authority) and the administrated (citizens), Metropolitan Planning relates the various administrations among themselves. The indicative (versus compulsory) procedure, consensus building emphasis and the mechanisms (variability, adaptability, time and sectors) are different, as is reflected both in process and outcome. Addressing metropolitan mechanisms with common urban planning methods is at the origin of the failures of metropolitan planning.

==Applications of the method==
The CT Method has been applied within the World Bank for strategic analysis of rapidly growing metropolises, allowing for both long term development vision as well as short term decision making for structural projects, as is the case of NaMSIP (Nairobi Metropolitan Services Improvement Project).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pedrobortiz.com/display-articles List of World Bank D4D Propositive Analysis reports].&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:'The Application' Tehran's Reticular Matrix.jpg|thumb|Tehran metropolitan structure. The methodology has been applied by the World Bank to numerous metropolises.]]
Other World Bank 'D4D Propositive Analyses' include:

*'''Accra''' (Ghana)
*'''Amman''' (Jordan)
*'''Baku''' (Azerbaijan)
*'''Barranquilla/Cartagena/S. Marta''' (Colombia)
*'''Bogotá''' (Colombia)
*'''Cairo''' (Egypt)
*'''Colombo''' Sri Lanka
*'''Dar es Salaam''' (Tanzania)
*'''Istanbul''' (Turkey)
*'''Kampala''' (Uganda)
*'''Kigali''' (Rwanda)
*'''Lao Cai/Phu Ly/Vinh''' (Vietnam)
*'''Leknath''' (Nepal)
*'''Manila''' (Philippines)
*'''Mexico City''' (Mexico)
*'''Mombasa''' (Kenya)
*'''N'Djamena''' (Chad)
*'''Nairobi''' (Kenya)
*'''Tunis''' (Tunisia)

Influences of the system also may be seen in the Panama Metropolitan Plan (Panama 1997) and the Strategic Plan of Colombo (Sri Lanka 1996).

The method has been used in some academic institutions and universities to develop urban projects in Bari, Dar es Salaam, Cairo and Tehran within a consistent metropolitan context.&lt;ref&gt;[http://europaconcorsi.com/projects/177244-DAR-SMART-SUSTAINABILITY-OF-IDENTITY Politecnico di Milano] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927084123/http://europaconcorsi.com/projects/177244-DAR-SMART-SUSTAINABILITY-OF-IDENTITY |date=2011-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Madrid Metropolitan Plan===
The Madrid Metropolitan Plan was the first application, under the direction of Pedro B. Ortiz, of the CT method, approved administratively in 1996 and backed by the Madrid Regional Parliament in May 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asambleamadrid.es/Resources/Ficheros/C1/BOAM/BOAM/BOAM_4_00106.pdf Madrid Regional Parliament official publication (Spanish)]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Plan was the physical continuation of a previously developed exercise of [[Strategic Urban Planning]] in 1989-1994 and established a framework for the future development of the Metropolis of Madrid. The numerous territorial decisions taken during the enforcement period until the new Planning Law of 2001 required revision and approval, have been determinant to the actual shape and efficiency of the metropolitan structure of Madrid.

Under the plan, to respond to the rapid growth Madrid was experiencing (50% every 20 years), the Metropolitan Reticular Matrix Planning methodology was set in place. The CT Method principles are the foundation of the design, implementation and management of this Metropolitan Plan.

'''Ovtcharka''' (овчарка {{IPA-ru|afˈtɕarkə|}}) is a term of Russian origin used to describe the working dog specializing  in working with sheep.  Originated from ovtsa (oвца, sheep in Russian),  ovtchar (sheep herder, or farm employee maintaining sheep). 

Though the term itself does not specify whether the dog is a [[herding dog]] or a [[livestock guardian dog]], it refers in this case to livestock guardian and protection breeds of Russian origin for the simple reason that there are no herding breeds originating from Russia. At the same time, it is used as a part of breed name in Russian for shepherds or sheepdogs imported into the country. 

When Russian [[cynologists]] named dog breeds, they often used a combination of [[country of origin]] and the term Ovtcharka, meaning that this shepherd dog came from a specific region. For example, a shepherd of German origin is known in Russian as ''Nemetskaja Ovtcharka'', which translates as German Shepherd.  

Over the years, the term Ovtcharka has become common outside Russia and other countries where Russian is commonly spoken because of three livestock guardian breeds of Russian origin: [[Caucasian Ovtcharka]], [[Central Asian Ovtcharka]] and [[South Russian Ovtcharka]]. The reason for the continuing use of this term instead of “shepherd” or “sheepdog” is the necessity to differentiate between a livestock guardian dog (especially of Russian origin) and a herding dog (commonly called Shepherd in English). All three breeds have different mentalities and much greater protection instincts than a German Shepherd or other popular herding dogs and use of a different breed name avoiding a common and potentially misleading term helps to distinguish such traits.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17572">A '''political family''' (also referred to as '''political dynasty''') is a [[family]] in which several members are involved in [[politics]], particularly [[Election|electoral politics]]. Members may be related by blood or marriage; often several [[generation]]s or multiple [[sibling]]s may be involved.

A [[royal family]] or [[dynasty]] in a [[monarchy]] is generally considered to not be a "political family," although the later descendants of a royal family have played political roles in a [[republic]] (such as the [[Arslan family|Arslan Family]] of [[Lebanon]] would be). A [[family dictatorship]] is a form of [[dictatorship]] that operates much like an [[absolute monarchy]], yet occurs in a nominally republican state.

==United States==
{{Main article|List of United States political families}}
In the United States, many political dynasties (having at least two generations serving in political office) have arisen since the country's founding: 

===Presidential===
[[file:Seal of the President of the United States.svg|right|185px|thumb|Four noted U.S. political families — Adams, Harrison, Roosevelt, Bush — have had two members that served as President of the United States]]
Four noted U.S. political families — Adams, Harrison, Roosevelt, Bush — have had two members that served as President of the United States.
*The first dynasty with presidential connections was the Adams family. [[John Adams]] served as the second President (after serving as the first vice president), and his son [[John Quincy Adams]] served as the sixth. John Quincy's son [[Charles Francis Adams Sr.|Charles]] served as U.S. ambassador (then called minister) to the United Kingdom and as a U.S. congressman. A fourth-generation member of the family ([[John Quincy Adams II]]) served as a state representative in Massachusetts, and his son [[Charles Francis Adams III|Charles]] was mayor of [[Quincy, Massachusetts]] and secretary of the Navy in the Hoover administration.
*Another early political dynasty was the Harrison family, of which six generations served in public office from the late 18th through mid 20th centuries. [[Benjamin Harrison V]] was one of the early governors of Virginia and a signer of the Declaration of Independence. His son [[William Henry Harrison]] was the ninth U.S. President. William's son [[John Scott Harrison]] served in the U.S. House of Representatives, while his son [[Benjamin Harrison]] became the 23rd President (marking the first and only grandfather and grandson to serve as president). Benjamin's son [[Russell Benjamin Harrison]] served as a state representative and state senator from Indiana in the 1920s, and Russell's son [[William H. Harrison (Wyoming politician)|William]] served in the U.S. House of Representatives in the 1950s and '60s.

[[file:Kennedy family on jpk birthday sept 1963.jpg|right|thumb|185px|The [[Kennedy Family|Kennedys]]]]
*The [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]-based [[Taft family]] has had a legacy of public service ranging from the late 19th through early 21st century. [[Alphonso Taft]] served in President [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s cabinet. Two of his sons followed him into public service: [[Charles Phelps Taft]] served as a U.S. congressman, and [[William Howard Taft]] was the 27th President and later [[U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice]] (the only one to hold both offices). William Howard's sons: [[Robert A. Taft]] was a long-serving U.S. senator (and for a time Senate Majority Leader), and [[Charles Phelps Taft II]] served as mayor of the family's hometown of Cincinnati. The fourth generation of Tafts includes [[Robert Taft Jr.]], who served as a U.S. congressman and senator, and [[Seth Taft]], who was commissioner of [[Cuyahoga County]] (Cleveland area). [[Bob Taft|Robert III (better known as Bob)]] served as governor of Ohio at the turn of the 21st century.
*The New York-based [[Roosevelt family]] produced two presidents. [[Theodore Roosevelt|Theodore]] (#26), and [[Franklin Roosevelt|Franklin]] (aka FDR, the 32nd president and the only one to serve more than two terms), were fifth cousins by blood but uncle and nephew by marriage: FDR was married to Theodore's niece [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], daughter of Theodore's younger brother Elliott. Eleanor served as an informal adviser to her husband during his presidency, served as U.S. representative to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights during the Truman and Eisenhower administrations, and chaired the Presidential Commission on the Status of Women during the Kennedy administration. [[Theodore Roosevelt Jr.]] served as governor of [[Puerto Rico]] and [[The Philippines]] and as a New York state assemblyman. [[Theodore Roosevelt III|Theodore III]] served as Pennsylvania's secretary of Commerce. FDR and Eleanor's sons, [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt Jr.]] and [[James Roosevelt]] served in the U.S. House of Representatives; and Elliott Roosevelt served as mayor of Miami Beach, Florida.
*In the early to mid 20th century, the Massachusetts-based [[Kennedy family]] became one of the most prominent political dynasties in American history. Patriarch [[P. J. Kennedy|Patrick Joseph Kennedy]] served as a Massachusetts state representative and state senator. His son [[Joseph P. Kennedy]] served as U.S. ambassador to the United Kingdom. The children of Joseph P. Kennedy include [[John F. Kennedy]] (aka JFK, 35th President of the United States), [[Robert F. Kennedy]] (aka RFK, U.S. Senator and Attorney General), [[Ted Kennedy]] (U.S. Senator), and Jean Kennedy Smith, U.S. ambassador to Ireland. The next generation includes former U.S. congressmen [[Joseph Patrick Kennedy II]] and [[Patrick Joseph Kennedy II]], former U.S. Ambassador to Japan [[Caroline Kennedy]], former Maryland Lt. Governor [[Kathleen Kennedy Townsend]], former Maryland House of Delegates member Mark Shriver, Connecticut state Sen. [[Edward Kennedy Jr.]], and former Santa Monica, California mayor Bobby Shriver. [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], who at the time was married to [[Maria Shriver]] (niece of JFK, RFK, and Ted), served as governor of California (Maria Shriver served as First Lady and founded the California Museum) throughout most of the 2000s. The fifth generation includes U.S. Rep. [[Joseph Kennedy III]]&lt;ref&gt;KQED, General Article: The Kennedys in Politics, &lt;http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/general-article/kennedys-politics/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
[[file:George W. Bush and family.jpg|right|thumb|185px|The [[Bush Family]]]]
*[[Peter Schweizer]] describes the [[Bush family]] as "the most successful political dynasty in American history."&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Curl (January 20, 2005). "Rise of 'dynasty' quick, far-reaching". ''The Washington Times''. Archived from the original on 2006-03-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Four generations have served in elective office: [[Prescott Bush]] served in the U.S. Senate. His son [[George H.W. Bush]] served as the 41st U.S. President. George H.W.'s oldest son [[George W. Bush|George W.]] was the 43rd President. Another of George H.W.'s sons, [[Jeb Bush]], served as governor of Florida, and Jeb's son [[George P. Bush]] serves as [[Texas Land Commissioner]].
[[file:Trump Family Hand Up.jpg|right|thumb|185px|The [[Trump family|Trumps]]]]
*[[Bill Clinton]] served as the 42nd U.S. president, after having served as attorney general and governor of Arkansas. His uncle, Roy Clinton, served in the Arkansas state legislature in the 1950s. President Clinton's wife, [[Hillary Clinton]], served as U.S. senator from New York from 2001-09 and U.S. Secretary of State in the Obama administration; and was the 2016 [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee for [[President of the United States]],&lt;ref&gt;Feldmann, Linda.

Why Political Dynasties Might Make Sense. (+video)."] ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' 23 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[family of Donald Trump|The current U.S. First Family, the Trumps]], initially gained fame as a [[Trump Organization|New York City-based business dynasty]], but can be considered a political dynasty as well. [[Donald Trump]] is the 45th and current U.S. President, his sister [[Maryanne Trump|Maryanne]] is a retired federal judge, and daughter [[Ivanka Trump|Ivanka]] and son-in-law [[Jared Kushner]] serve as [[Executive Office of the President of the United States|White House senior advisers]].

A '''public switched data network''' ('''PSDN''') is a network for providing data services via a system of multiple [[wide-area network]]s, similar in concept to the [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN).&lt;ref name=bagad&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bagad|title=Telecommunication Switching Systems and Networks|date=2009|publisher=Technical Publications|isbn=9788184315905|pages=344|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VfPST6NEggEC&amp;pg=SA6-PA4&amp;dq=psdn&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiLpPSoi8TQAhUaOsAKHdAABVQ4ChDoAQgwMAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=psdn&amp;f=false|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A PSDN may use a variety of switching technologies, including [[packet switching]], [[circuit switching]], and [[message switching]].&lt;ref name=bagad /&gt; A packet-switched PSDN may also be called a packet-switched data network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hura and Singal|title=Data and Computer Communications: Networking and Internetworking|date=2001|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9780849309281|pages=1168|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BViV0PoH_voC&amp;pg=PA529&amp;dq=psdn&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi44OGZi8TQAhXqI8AKHd8YBL4Q6AEILTAE#v=onepage&amp;q=psdn&amp;f=false|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mazda|first1=Fraidoon|title=Focal Illustrated Dictionary of Telecommunications|date=2013|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9781136121029|pages=704|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=i5ZNAGQOX18C&amp;pg=PA497&amp;dq=%22packet+switched%22+%22public+switched%22+PSDN&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjdrJeDicTQAhXII8AKHXNIBdkQ6AEIGzAA#v=snippet&amp;q=psdn&amp;f=false|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally the term PSDN referred only to [[Packet Switch Stream]] (PSS), an [[X.25]]-based packet-switched network, mostly used to provide leased-line connections between [[local area network]]s and the Internet using  [[permanent virtual circuit]]s (PVCs).{{cn|date=November 2016}} Today, the term may refer not only to [[Frame Relay]] and [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] (ATM), both providing PVCs, but also to [[Internet Protocol]] (IP), [[GPRS]], and other [[packet-switching]] techniques.

Whilst there are several technologies that are superficially similar to the PSDN, such as [[Integrated Services Digital Network]] (ISDN) and the [[Digital Subscriber Line]] (DSL) technologies, they are not examples of it.{{cn|date=November 2016}} ISDN utilizes the PSTN circuit-switched network, and DSL uses point-to-point [[circuit switching]] communications overlaid on the PSTN local loop (copper wires), usually utilized for access to a packet-switched broadband IP network.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13179">{{About|investments in private equity through publicly traded vehicles|Private Investments in Public Equity or PIPEs|Private investment in public equity}}
'''Publicly traded private equity''' (also referred to as '''publicly quoted private equity''' or '''publicly listed private equity''') refers to an [[private equity firm|investment firm]] or [[private equity fund|investment vehicle]], which makes investments conforming to one of the various [[private equity]] strategies, and is [[public company|listed]] on a [[stock exchange|public stock exchange]].

There are fundamentally two separate opportunities that private equity firms pursued in the public markets.  These options involved a public listing of either:

*A ''[[private equity firm]]'' (the management company), which provides shareholders an opportunity to gain exposure to the [[management fee]]s and [[carried interest]] earned by the investment professionals and managers of the private equity firm.  The most notable example of this public listing was completed by [[Blackstone Group|The Blackstone Group]] in 2007
*A ''[[private equity fund]]'' or similar investment vehicle, which allows investors that would otherwise be unable to invest in a traditional private equity [[limited partnership]] to gain exposure to a portfolio of private equity investments.

==Business Development Companies==
{{Main|Business Development Company}}
Historically, in the United States, there had been a group of publicly traded private equity firms that were registered as business development companies (BDCs) under the [[Investment Company Act of 1940]].&lt;ref&gt;Companies must elect to be treated as a "business development company" under the terms of the [[Investment Company Act of 1940]] ([http://www.law.uc.edu/CCL/InvCoAct/sec54.html Investment Company Act of 1940: Section 54 -- Election to Be Regulated as Business Development Company] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527235414/http://www.law.uc.edu/CCL/InvCoAct/sec54.html |date=2008-05-27 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, BDCs are structured similar to [[real estate investment trust]]s (REITs) in that the BDC structure reduces or eliminates [[corporate income tax]]. In return, REITs are required to [[Distribution (economics)|distribute]] 95% of their [[income]], which may be taxable to its [[investor]]s.

As of the end of 2008, among the largest BDCs (by market value, excluding [[Apollo Global Management|Apollo Investment Corp]], discussed elsewhere) are: American Capital Strategies &lt;small&gt;({{NASDAQ|ACAS}})&lt;/small&gt;, [[Ares Capital Corp.]] &lt;small&gt;({{NASDAQ|ARCC}})&lt;/small&gt;, BlackRock Kelso Capital Corp, Gladstone Investment Corp &lt;small&gt;({{NASDAQ|GAIN}})&lt;/small&gt; and [[Kohlberg &amp; Company|Kohlberg Capital Corp]] &lt;small&gt;({{NASDAQ|KCAP}})&lt;/small&gt;.

==Venture Capital Trusts==
{{Main|Venture Capital Trust}}
A [[Venture Capital Trust]] or VCT is a highly tax efficient [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[Closed-end fund|closed-end]] [[collective investment scheme]] designed to provide capital finance for small expanding companies and capital gains for investors.  VCTs are companies listed on the [[London Stock Exchange]], which invest in other companies which are not themselves listed.

First introduced by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government in the [[Finance Act]], 1995 they have proved to be much less risky than originally anticipated. The last created VCTs to encourage investment into new UK businesses.

==History==
Although there had previously been certain instances of publicly traded private equity vehicles, the convergence of private equity and the [[stock market|public equity markets]] attracted significantly greater attention when several of the largest private equity firms pursued various options through the public markets.  Taking private equity firms and private equity funds public appeared an unusual move since private equity funds often buy public companies listed on exchange and then take them private.  Private equity firms are rarely subject to the quarterly reporting requirements of the public markets and tout this independence to prospective sellers as a key advantage of going private.

===Blackstone Group IPO===
[[Image:StephenSchwarzman.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Stephen A. Schwarzman|Schwarzman's]] [[Blackstone Group]] completed the first major IPO of a private equity firm in June 2007.&lt;ref name=WEF&gt;Photographed at the [[World Economic Forum]] in [[Davos, Switzerland]] in January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
On March 22, 2007, the [[Blackstone Group]] filed with the SEC&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1404912/000104746907005446/a2178646zs-1.htm The Blackstone Group L.P., FORM S-1], SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, March 22, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; to raise $4 billion in an initial public offering. On June 21, Blackstone swapped a 12.3% stake in its ownership for $4.13 billion in the largest U.S. IPO since 2002. Traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol BX, Blackstone priced at $31 per share on June 22, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;SORKIN, ANDREW ROSS and DE LA MERCED, MICHAEL J.

[[New York Times]], June 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===KKR Private Equity===
In May 2006, [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts]] raised $5 billion in an initial public offering for a new permanent investment vehicle ([[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts|KKR]] Private Equity Investors or KPE) listing it on the [[Euronext]] exchange in [[Amsterdam]] (ENXTAM: KPE).  [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts|KKR]] raised more than three times what it had expected at the outset as many of the investors in KPE were hedge funds seeking exposure to private equity but could not make long term commitments to private equity funds.  Because private equity had been booming in the preceding years, the proposition of investing in a [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts|KKR]] fund appeared attractive to certain investors.&lt;ref&gt;Timmons, Heather. "[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/04/business/worldbusiness/04place.html Opening Private Equity's Door, at Least a Crack, to Public Investors]." [[New York Times]], May 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
However, KPE's first-day performance was lackluster, trading down 1.7% and trading volume was limited.&lt;ref&gt;Timmons, Heather. "[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/10/business/10private.html Private Equity Goes Public for $5 Billion. Its Investors Ask, ‘What’s Next?’]." [[New York Times]], November 10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially, a handful of other private equity firms and hedge funds had planned to follow KKR's lead but shelved those plans when KPE's performance continued to falter after its IPO.  KPE's stock declined from an IPO price of €25 per share to €18.16 (a 27% decline) at the end of 2007 and a low of €11.45 (a 54.2% decline) per share in Q1 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Jenny. "[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/23/business/23insider.html Where Private Equity Goes, Hedge Funds May Follow]." [[New York Times]], June 23, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  KPE disclosed in May 2008 that it had completed approximately $300 million of [[private equity secondary market|secondary sales]] of selected limited
partnership interests in and undrawn commitments to certain KKR-managed funds in order to generate liquidity and repay borrowings.&lt;ref&gt;Press Release: [http://www.kkrpei.com/pdfs/KKRPEI-PR_05_07_08.pdf KKR Private Equity Investors Reports Results for Quarter Ended March 31, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320131106/http://www.kkrpei.com/pdfs/KKRPEI-PR_05_07_08.pdf |date=March 20, 2009 }}, May 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Less than two weeks after the [[Blackstone Group]] IPO, in 2007 [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts]] filed with the SEC&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1404912/000104746907005446/a2178646zs-1.htm KKR &amp; CO. L.P., FORM S-1], SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, July 3, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; in July 2007 to raise $1.25 billion by selling an ownership interest in its management company.&lt;ref&gt;JENNY ANDERSON and MICHAEL J. de la MERCED. "[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/04/business/04kkr.html Kohlberg Kravis Plans to Go Public]." [[New York Times]], July 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts|KKR]] had previously listed its [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts|KKR]] Private Equity Investors (KPE) private equity fund vehicle in 2006.  The onset of the credit crunch and the shutdown of the IPO market would dampen the prospects of obtaining a valuation that would be attractive to [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts|KKR]] and the flotation was repeatedly postponed.

==Response to private equity IPOs==
The [[initial public offering]] completed by [[Blackstone Group|Blackstone]] intensified the level of attention directed toward the [[private equity]] industry overall as media commentators focused on the large payout received by the firm's CEO [[Steve Schwarzman]].&lt;ref name=bday&gt;Sender, Henny and Langley, Monica.  "[http://schwert.ssb.rochester.edu/f423/WSJ070613_Blackstone.pdf Buyout Mogul: How Blackstone's Chief Became $7 Billion Man – Schwarzman Says He's Worth Every Penny; $400 for Stone Crabs]."  The Wall Street Journal, June 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Schwarzman received a severe backlash from both critics of the private equity industry and fellow investors in private equity.  An ill-timed birthday event around the time of the IPO led various commentators to draw comparisons to the excesses of notorious executives including [[Bernie Ebbers]] ([[WorldCom]]) and [[Dennis Kozlowski]] ([[Tyco International]]).  [[David Bonderman]], a co-founder of the private equity firm [[TPG Capital]], remarked, "We have all wanted to be private
– at least until now.  When Steve Schwarzman's biography with all the dollar signs is posted on the web site none of us will like the furor that results – and that's even if you like Rod Stewart."&lt;ref name="bday"/&gt;

Meanwhile, other private equity investors would also seek to realize a portion of the value locked into their firms.  In September 2007, the [[Carlyle Group]] sold a 7.5% interest in its management company to Mubadala Development Company, which is owned by the [[Abu Dhabi Investment Authority]] (ADIA) for $1.35 billion, which valued Carlyle at approximately $20 billion.&lt;ref&gt;Sorkin, Andrew Ross. "[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/21/business/worldbusiness/21carlyle.html Carlyle to Sell Stake to a Mideast Government]." [[New York Times]], September 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, in January 2008, [[Silver Lake Partners]] sold a 9.9% stake in its management company to [[CalPERS]] for $275 million.&lt;ref&gt;Sorkin, Andrew Ross. "[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/09/business/09deal.html California Pension Fund Expected to Take Big Stake in Silver Lake, at $275 Million]." [[New York Times]], January 9, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, [[Apollo Global Management|Apollo Management]] completed a private placement of shares in its management company in July 2007.  By pursuing a private placement rather than a public offering, Apollo would be able to avoid much of the public scrutiny applied to Blackstone and KKR.&lt;ref&gt;SORKIN, ANDREW ROSS and de la MERCED, MICHAEL J.  "[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/18/business/18place.html Buyout Firm Said to Seek a Private Market Offering]." [[New York Times]], July 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;SORKIN, ANDREW ROSS.  "[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/05/business/05deal.html Equity Firm Is Seen Ready to Sell a Stake to Investors ]." [[New York Times]], April 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 2008, Apollo filed with the SEC&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1411494/000119312508077312/ds1.htm APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, LLC, FORM S-1], SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, April 8, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; to permit some holders of its privately traded stock to sell their shares on the [[New York Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;de la MERCED, MICHAEL J. "[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/14/business/14apollo.html Apollo Struggles to Keep Debt From Sinking Linens ’n Things]." [[New York Times]], April 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 2004, Apollo raised $930 million for a listed [[business development company]], Apollo Investment Corporation {{NASDAQ|AINV}}, to invest primarily in middle-market companies in the form of [[mezzanine debt]] and [[secured loan|senior secured loans]], as well as by making direct equity investments in
companies. The Company also invests in the securities of public companies.&lt;ref&gt;FABRIKANT, GERALDINE. "[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E4DD133BF934A25757C0A9629C8B63 Private Firms Use Closed-End Funds To Tap the Market]." [[New York Times]], April 17, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Use Indian English|date=June 2013}}
[[Indian English]] has developed a number of dialects, distinct from the General/Standard [[Indian English]] that educators have attempted to establish and institutionalise, and it is possible to distinguish a person's sociolinguistic background from the dialect that they employ.  These dialects are influenced by the different languages that different sections of the country also speak, side by side with English.  The dialects can differ markedly in their phonology, to the point that two speakers using two different dialects can find each other's accents mutually unintelligible.&lt;ref name=SethiSethiDhamija2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sarangi2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Schneider2007 /&gt;

Indian English is a "network of varieties", resulting from an extraordinarily complex linguistic situation in the country.  (See [[Official languages of India]].)   This network comprises both regional and occupational dialects of English.  The widely recognised dialects include Malayali English,Maharashtrian English, Punjabi English, Bengali English, Hindi English, alongside several more obscure dialects such as [[Butler English]] (a.k.a. Bearer English), Babu English, and Bazaar English and several [[Code-switching|code-mixed]] varieties of English.&lt;ref name=Schneider2007 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Krishnaswamy2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kirkpatrick2007 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Gargesh2006 /&gt;

The formation of these regional/socio-economic dialects is the same form of [[language contact]] that has given rise to [[Scottish English]].&lt;ref name=Hickey2004 /&gt;

== Babu English ==
'''Babu English'''  (a.k.a. '''Baboo English'''), the name originally coming from the [[Bengali language|Bengali]] word for a gentleman, is a dialect of English that first developed as an occupational dialect, amongst clerks in the Bengali-speaking areas of pre-[[Partition of India|Partition]] India.  Originally characterised as a markedly ornate form of administrative English, it is now no longer confined solely to clerks, and can be found in [[Nepal]], north India, and in some social circles in south India.&lt;ref name=Kachru1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bragg2006 /&gt;

The distinguishing characteristics of Babu English are the florid, excessively polite, and indirect manner of expression, which have been reported for amusement value, in works such as Cecil Hunt's ''Honoured Sir'' collections (see [[#Further reading|Further reading]]), and lampooned, in works such as F. Anstey's ''Baboo Jabberjee, B.A.'', for over a century.&lt;ref name=Kachru1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Aravamudan2006 /&gt;

== Butler English ==
{{main|Butler English}}

Butler English, also known as Bearer English or Kitchen English, is a dialect of English that first developed as an occupational dialect in the years of the Madras Presidency&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kachru|first=Braj B.|date=1965-12-01|title=The Indianness in Indian English|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00437956.1965.11435436|journal=WORD|volume=21|issue=3|pages=391–410|doi=10.1080/00437956.1965.11435436|issn=0043-7956}}&lt;/ref&gt;, but that has developed over time and is now associated mainly with social class rather than occupation. It is still spoken in major metropolitan cities. 

The dialect of Butler English is singular. Therefore, the present participle is used for the future indicative, and the preterite. For example, for the preterite indicative "done", "I telling" translates to "I will tell", "I done tell" to "I have told", and "done come" to "actually arrived". This form of Indian English was used both by masters for speaking to their servants as well as by servants to speak to their masters&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/913732430|title=Hobson-Jobson : the definitive glossary of British India|last=1820-1889.|first=Yule, Henry, Sir,|others=Burnell, A. C. (Arthur Coke), 1840-1882., Teltscher, Kate,, Teltscher, Kate, 1963-|isbn=0198718004|location=[Oxford]|oclc=913732430}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Hindi English ==
{{Main|Hinglish}}
Hinglish (the name is a combination of the words "Hindi" and "English") is a [[macaronic language]], a hybrid of [[British English]] and [[South Asian languages]] – it is a [[code-switching]] variety of these languages whereby they are freely interchanged within a sentence or between sentences. While the name is based on the [[Hindi language]], it does not refer exclusively to Hindi, but "is used in India, with English words blending with Punjabi, and Hindi, and also within [[British Asian]] families to enliven standard English." It is predominantly spoken in North India and some parts of Mumbai and Bangalore with large North Indian populations.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Major regional dialects and accents==
Modern phonologists often divide Indian English into five major varieties.

===Assamese English===
'''Assamese English''' refers to the English spoken by [[Assamese language|Assamese speakers]].
Some major difference between Assamese English and British English are mostly seen in some consonants. In Assamese English all vowels are usually short.

*{{IPAc-en|ɪ}} as raised, in the general vicinity of {{IPA-all|i|}}.
*{{IPAc-en|ʌ}} as fronted, more closely approaching {{IPA-all|ä|}} but {{IPA-all|ɔ|}} between nasal and velar e.g. '''mug'''.
*{{IPAc-en|uː}} and {{IPAc-en|ʊ}} both in the general vicinity of {{IPA-all|uː|}}.
*{{IPAc-en|eɪ}} as {{IPA-all|eː|}}.
*{{IPAc-en|oʊ}}, almost always, as [[monophthong]] {{IPA-all|oː|}}.

===West Indian English===
'''West Indian English'''  here refers to a traditional variety spoken in the western part of India. 
*{{IPAc-en|oʊ}} as [[monophthong]]al {{IPA-all|oː|}}.
*{{IPAc-en|eɪ}} as [[monophthong]]al {{IPA-all|eː|}}.
*{{IPAc-en|ɛ}} as {{IPA-all|e|}}.
*{{IPAc-en|æ}} as {{IPA-all|ɛ|}}.

'''Robert Philip Hanssen''' (born April 18, 1944) is a former [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) agent who spied for [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and [[Russia]]n intelligence services against the United States from 1979 to 2001. His espionage was described by the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] as "possibly the worst intelligence disaster in U.S. history."&lt;ref&gt;''[https://fas.org/irp/agency/doj/fbi/websterreport.html A Review of FBI Security Programs]'' (Webster Report) (March 2002). Commission for Review of FBI Security Programs, [[United States Department of Justice]].&lt;/ref&gt; He is currently serving 15 consecutive [[life imprisonment|life sentences]] at [[ADX Florence]], a federal [[supermax prison]] near [[Florence, Colorado]].

Hanssen was born in [[Chicago]]. His father, a police officer, was [[emotionally abusive]] to him during his childhood. In 1968 Hanssen married his wife Bonnie, a strict [[Roman Catholic]]. He converted to Catholicism and became heavily involved in the conservative Catholic organization [[Opus Dei]]. He hovered between varying academic pursuits and jobs before joining the FBI in 1976. Three years after joining, Hanssen approached the Soviet [[Glavnoye Razvedyvatel'noye Upravleniye|GRU]] to offer his services, launching his first espionage cycle which lasted until 1981. Hanssen restarted his espionage activities in 1985 and continued until 1991 when he broke off communications during the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapse of the Soviet Union]], fearing he would be exposed. He restored communications the next year and continued until his arrest. Throughout his spying, Hanssen remained anonymous to the Russians.

Hanssen sold thousands of classified documents to the [[KGB]] which detailed U.S. strategies in the event of nuclear war, developments in military weapons technologies, and aspects of the U.S. counterintelligence program.&lt;ref name="oig" /&gt; He was spying at the same time as [[Aldrich Ames]] in the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA). Both Ames and Hanssen compromised the names of KGB agents working secretly for the United States, some of whom were executed for their betrayal. Hanssen also revealed a multimillion dollar eavesdropping tunnel built by the FBI under the Soviet Embassy in Washington. After Ames' arrest in 1994, some of these intelligence breaches still remained unsolved. The FBI paid $7 million to a KGB agent to obtain a file on an anonymous [[Mole (espionage)|mole]], whom the FBI later identified as Hanssen through fingerprint and voice analysis.

Hanssen was arrested on February 18, 2001, at [[Foxstone Park]]&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Havill, crimelibrary.com.

Hanssen applied for a [[cryptographer]] position in the [[National Security Agency]], but was rebuffed due to budget setbacks. He enrolled in [[dental school]] at [[Northwestern University]]&lt;ref name="courttv"&gt;Adrian Havill, [[Court TV]], [http://www.crimelibrary.com/terrorists_spies/spies/hanssen/4.html ''Robert Philip Hanssen: The Spy who Stayed out in The Cold''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211034721/http://www.crimelibrary.com/terrorists_spies/spies/hanssen/4.html |date=February 11, 2007 }}.

In January 1976, he left the police department to join the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]].&lt;ref name="oig"/&gt;

Hanssen met Bernadette "Bonnie" Wauck, a staunch [[Roman Catholic]], while attending dental school at Northwestern. The couple married in 1968, and Hanssen converted from [[Lutheranism]] to his wife's Catholicism, becoming a fervent believer and being extensively involved in the conservative Catholic organization [[Opus Dei]].&lt;ref&gt;Spy's Wife Speaks, After Taking a Lie Test by James Risin, NY Times, 16 May 2002; https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/16/us/spy-s-wife-speaks-after-taking-a-lie-test.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==FBI career and first espionage activities (1976–1981)==
Upon becoming a special agent on January 12, 1976, Hanssen was transferred to the FBI's [[Gary, Indiana|Gary]], [[Indiana]], field office. In 1978, Hanssen and his growing family (of three children and eventually six) moved to [[New York City]] when the FBI transferred him to its field office there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|pp=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, Hanssen was moved into [[counter-intelligence]] and given the task of compiling a database of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] intelligence for the Bureau.

In 1979, only three years after joining the FBI, Hanssen approached the Soviet [[Glavnoye Razvedyvatel'noye Upravleniye|GRU]] and offered his services. He never indicated any political or ideological motive for his actions, telling the FBI after he was caught that his only motivation was profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his first espionage cycle, Hanssen told the GRU a significant amount, including information on the FBI's bugging activities and lists of suspected Soviet intelligence agents. His most important leak was the betrayal of [[Dmitri Polyakov]], a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] informant who passed enormous amounts of information to American intelligence while he rose to the rank of General in the [[Soviet Army]]. For unknown reasons, the Soviets did not act against Polyakov until he was betrayed a second time by CIA [[Mole (espionage)|mole]] [[Aldrich Ames]] in 1985. Polyakov was arrested in 1986 and executed in 1988. Ames was officially blamed for giving Polyakov's name to the Soviets, while Hanssen's attempt was not revealed until after his 2001 capture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|pp=21–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==FBI counterintelligence unit, further espionage activities (1985–1991)==
[[File:Ellis dead drop.jpg|thumb|200px|"Ellis" dead drop site in [[Foxstone Park]] used by Hanssen, including on the day of his arrest]]

In 1981, Hanssen was transferred to [[J. Edgar Hoover Building|FBI headquarters]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] and moved to the suburb of [[Vienna, Virginia|Vienna]], [[Virginia]]. His new job in the FBI's budget office gave him access to information involving many different FBI operations. This included all the FBI activities related to [[wiretapping]] and [[electronic surveillance]], which were Hanssen's responsibility. He became known in the Bureau as an expert on computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|pp=28–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three years later, Hanssen transferred to the FBI's Soviet analytical unit, which was responsible for studying, identifying, and capturing Soviet spies and intelligence operatives in the [[United States]]. Hanssen's section was in charge of evaluating Soviet agents who volunteered to give intelligence to determine whether they were genuine or [[re-doubled agent]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|pp=37–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, Hanssen was again transferred to the FBI's field office in New York, where he continued to work in counter-intelligence against the Soviets. It was after the transfer, while on a business trip back to Washington, that he resumed his career in espionage.

On October 1, 1985, Hanssen sent an anonymous letter to the [[KGB]] offering his services and asking for [[United States dollar|US$]]100,000 in cash. In the letter, he gave the names of three KGB agents secretly working for the FBI: [[Boris Yuzhin]], Valery Martynov, and Sergei Motorin. Although Hanssen was unaware of it, all three agents had already been exposed earlier that year by Ames.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|pp=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martynov, Motorin, and Yuzhin were recalled to [[Moscow]], where they were arrested, charged, tried, and convicted of espionage against the USSR. Martynov and Motorin were condemned to death and executed via a gun-shot to the back of the head. Yuzhin was imprisoned for six years before he was released under a general amnesty to political prisoners, and subsequently emigrated to the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|pp=56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the FBI blamed Ames for the leak, Hanssen was not suspected nor investigated. The October 1 letter was the beginning of a long, active espionage period for Hanssen.

Hanssen was recalled yet again to Washington in 1987. He was given the task of making a study of all known and rumored penetrations of the FBI in order to find the man who had betrayed Martynov and Motorin; this meant that he was looking for himself. Hanssen ensured that he did not unmask himself with his study, but in addition, he turned over the entire study—including the list of all Soviets who had contacted the FBI about FBI moles—to the KGB in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|pp=3–4, 67–68, 82–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, Hanssen, according to a government report, "committed a serious security breach" by revealing secret information to a Soviet [[defector]] during a debriefing. The agents working underneath him reported this breach to a supervisor, but no action was taken.&lt;ref name="oig"/&gt;

In 1989, Hanssen compromised the FBI investigation of [[Felix Bloch (diplomatic officer)|Felix Bloch]], a [[United States Department of State|State Department]] official who had come under suspicion for espionage. Hanssen warned that Bloch was under investigation, causing the KGB to abruptly break off contact with Bloch. The FBI was unable to produce any hard evidence, and as a result, Bloch was never charged with a crime, although the State Department later terminated his employment and denied his [[pension]]. The failure of the Bloch investigation, and the FBI's investigation of how the KGB found out they were investigating Bloch, drove the mole hunt that eventually led to the arrest of Hanssen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|pp=111–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year, Hanssen handed over extensive information about American planning for [[Measurement and Signature Intelligence]] (MASINT), an umbrella term for intelligence collected by a wide array of electronic means, such as [[radar]], spy satellites, and signal intercepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cherkashin|Feifer|2005|p=246}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Soviets began construction on a new [[embassy]] in 1977, the FBI dug a tunnel beneath their decoding room. The FBI planned to use it for [[eavesdropping]], but never did for fear of being caught. Hanssen disclosed this detailed information to the Soviets in September 1989 and received a US$55,000 payment the next month.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|pp=98–110}}&lt;/ref&gt; On two occasions, Hanssen gave the Soviets a complete list of American [[double agent]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, Hanssen's brother-in-law, Mark Wauck, who was also an FBI employee, recommended to the Bureau that Hanssen be investigated for espionage; this came after Bonnie Hanssen's sister Jeanne Beglis had found a pile of cash sitting on a dresser in the Hanssens' house. Bonnie had previously told her brother that Hanssen once talked about retiring in [[Poland]], then part of the [[Eastern Bloc]]. Wauck also knew that the FBI was hunting for a mole and so spoke with his supervisor, who took no action.&lt;ref name="oig"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|pp=120–128}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later FBI career, continued espionage activities (1992–2001)==
When the [[Collapse of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union collapsed]] in December 1991, Hanssen, possibly worried that he could be exposed during the ensuing political upheaval, broke off communications with his handlers for a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, after the [[Russia|Russian Federation]] took over the defunct USSR's spy agencies, Hanssen made a risky approach to the GRU, with whom he had not been in contact in ten years. He went in person to the [[Embassy of Russia in Washington, D.C.|Russian embassy]] and physically approached a GRU officer in the parking garage. Hanssen, carrying a package of documents, identified himself by his Soviet [[code name]], "Ramon Garcia," and described himself as a "disaffected FBI agent" who was offering his services as a spy. The Russian officer, who evidently did not recognize the code name, drove off. The Russians then filed an official protest with the State Department, believing Hanssen to be a triple agent. Despite having shown his face, disclosed his code name, and revealed his FBI affiliation, Hanssen escaped arrest when the Bureau's investigation into the incident did not advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hanssen continued to take risks in 1993, when he hacked into the computer of a fellow FBI agent, Ray Mislock, printed out a classified document from Mislock's computer, and took the document to Mislock, saying, "You didn't believe me that the system was insecure." His superiors were not amused and launched an investigation. In the end, officials believed Hanssen's claim that he was merely demonstrating flaws in the FBI's security system. Mislock has since theorized that Hanssen probably went onto his computer to see if his superiors were investigating him for espionage, and invented the document story to cover his tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|pp=160–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Hanssen expressed interest in a transfer to the new [[Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive|National Counterintelligence Center]], which coordinated counter-intelligence activities. When told that he would have to take a [[lie detector]] test to join, Hanssen changed his mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|pp=176–177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, convicted FBI mole [[Earl Edwin Pitts]] told the Bureau that he suspected Hanssen was dirty due to the Mislock incident. Pitts was the second FBI agent to mention Hanssen by name as a possible mole, but superiors were still unconvinced. No action was taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|p=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IT personnel from the National Security Division's IIS Unit were sent to investigate Hanssen's desktop computer following a reported failure. NSD chief Johnnie Sullivan ordered the computer impounded after it appeared to have been tampered with. A digital investigation found that an attempted hacking had taken place using a [[password cracking]] program installed by Hanssen, which caused a security alert and lockup. Following confirmation by the FBI CART Unit, Sullivan filed a report with the Office of Professional Responsibility requesting further investigation of Hanssen's attempted hack. Hanssen claimed that he was attempting to connect a color printer to his computer, but needed the password cracker to bypass the administrative password. The FBI believed his story and Hanssen was let off with a warning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the same time period, Hanssen would search the FBI's internal computer case record to see if he was under investigation. He was indiscreet enough to type his own name into FBI search engines. Finding nothing, Hanssen decided to resume his spy career after eight years without contact with the Russians. He established contact with the [[Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)|SVR]] (the successor to the Soviet-era KGB) in the fall of 1999. He continued to perform highly incriminating searches of FBI files for his own name and address.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|pp=190–192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation and arrest==
The existence of two Russian moles working in the U.S. security and intelligence establishment simultaneously—Ames at the CIA and Hanssen at the FBI—complicated counterintelligence efforts in the 1990s. Ames was arrested in 1994; his exposure explained many of the asset losses American intelligence suffered in the 1980s, including the arrest and execution of Martynov and Motorin. However, two cases—the Bloch investigation and the embassy tunnel—stood out and remained unsolved. Ames had been stationed in [[Rome]] at the time of the Bloch investigation, and could not have had knowledge of that case or of the tunnel under the embassy, as he did not work for the FBI.&lt;ref&gt;[[CBS]] [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2001/03/04/national/main276193.shtml A Not-So-Secret Tunnel] March 5, 2001. Retrieved October 31, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FBI and CIA formed a joint mole-hunting team in 1994 to find the suspected second intelligence leak. They formed a list of all agents known to have access to cases that were compromised. The FBI's codename for the suspected spy was "Graysuit." Some promising suspects were cleared, and the mole hunt found other penetrations such as CIA officer [[Harold James Nicholson]]. But Hanssen escaped notice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1998, using FBI criminal profiling techniques, the pursuers zeroed in on an innocent man: [[Brian Kelley (CIA officer)|Brian Kelley]], a CIA operative involved in the Bloch investigation. The CIA and FBI searched his house, tapped his phone and put him under surveillance, following him and his family everywhere. In November 1998, they had a man with a foreign accent come to Kelley's door, warn him that the FBI knew he was a spy and tell him to show up at a [[Washington Metro|Metro]] station the next day in order to escape. Kelley instead reported the incident to the FBI. In 1999, the FBI even interrogated Kelley, his ex-wife, two sisters and three children. All denied everything. He was eventually placed on administrative leave, where he remained falsely accused until after Hanssen was arrested.&lt;ref name="oig"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|pp=205–213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FBI investigators later made progress during an operation in which they paid off disaffected Russian intelligence officers to deliver information on moles. They paid $7 million to KGB agent Alexandr Shcherbakov&lt;ref name="Shcherbakov"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stein |first1=Jeff |title=Riddle Resolved: Who Dimed Out American Traitor and Super-Spy, Robert Hanssen? |url=https://www.newsweek.com/who-dimed-out-american-traitor-super-spy-robert-hanssen-1196080 |website=Newsweek.com |publisher=Newsweek |accessdate=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had access to a file on "B." While it did not contain Hanssen's name, among the information was an audiotape of a July 21, 1986, conversation between "B" and KGB agent Aleksander Fefelov.&lt;ref&gt;[[NPR]] [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7152496 Robert Hanssen: A Brief History] February 4, 2007. Retrieved April 8, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; FBI agent Michael Waguespack felt the voice was familiar, but could not remember who it was. Rifling through the rest of the files, they found notes of the mole using a quote from General [[George S. Patton]] about "the purple-pissing Japanese."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; FBI analyst Bob King remembered Hanssen using that same quote. Waguespack listened to the tape again and recognized the voice as belonging to Hanssen. With the mole finally identified, locations, dates and cases were matched with Hanssen's activities during the time period. Two fingerprints collected from a trash bag in the file were analyzed and proved to be Hanssen's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|pp=218–228}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cherkashin|Feifer|2005|p=251}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schiller 260&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Robert-Philip-Hanssen.jpg|thumb|200px|Hanssen's mug shot, taken on the day of his arrest]]

The FBI placed Hanssen under surveillance and soon discovered that he was again in contact with the Russians. In order to bring him back to FBI headquarters, where he could be closely monitored and kept away from sensitive data, they promoted him in December 2000 and gave him a new job supervising FBI computer security. In January 2001, Hanssen was given an office and an assistant, [[Eric O'Neill]], who in reality was a young FBI agent who had been assigned to watch Hanssen. O'Neill ascertained that Hanssen was using a [[Palm III]] [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]] to store his information. When O'Neill was able to briefly obtain Hanssen's PDA and have agents download and decode its encrypted contents, the FBI had its "[[smoking gun]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Fresh Air]] [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7094972 Eric O'Neill and Billy Ray Discuss 'Breach'] 2007 January 31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=123776 20/20 Report on Eric O'Neill] December 27, 2002.

Retrieved January 31, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

During his final days with the FBI, Hanssen began to suspect that something was wrong; in early February 2001 he asked his friend at a computer technology company for a job. He also believed he was hearing noises on his car radio which indicated that it was bugged, although the FBI was later unable to reproduce the noises Hanssen claimed to have heard. In the last letter he wrote to the Russians, which was picked up by the FBI when he was arrested, Hanssen said that he had been promoted to a "[[sinecure|do-nothing job]]&amp;nbsp;... outside of regular access to information," and that, "Something has aroused the sleeping tiger."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|pp=236–239}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ELLIS Drop Site-Hanssen case.jpg|thumb|left|Foxstone Park, where Hanssen was arrested]]

However, his suspicions did not stop him from making one more [[dead drop]]. After dropping his friend off at the airport on February 18, 2001, Hanssen drove to Virginia's [[Foxstone Park]]. He placed a white piece of tape on a park sign, which was a signal to his Russian contacts that there was information at the dead drop site. He then followed his usual routine, taking a package consisting of a sealed garbage bag of classified material and taping it to the bottom side of a wooden footbridge over a creek. When FBI agents spotted this highly incriminating act they rushed in to catch Hanssen red-handed and arrest him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|pp=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon being arrested, Hanssen asked, "What took you so long?" The FBI waited two more days to see if any of Hanssen's SVR handlers would show up at Foxstone Park. When they failed to appear, the Justice Department announced the arrest on February 20.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|pp=246–247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Guilty plea and imprisonment==
[[File:Florence ADMAX.jpg|thumb|[[United States Penitentiary, Florence ADX]], where Hanssen is incarcerated]]

With the representation of Washington lawyer [[Plato Cacheris]], Hanssen negotiated a [[plea bargain]] that enabled him to escape the [[death penalty]] in exchange for cooperating with authorities.&lt;ref name="transcript"/&gt; On July 6, 2001, he pleaded guilty to 14 counts of espionage and one of conspiracy to commit espionage in the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia]].&lt;ref name="transcript"/&gt;&lt;ref name="usdoj.gov"/&gt; On May 10, 2002, he was sentenced to fifteen consecutive sentences of [[Life imprisonment|life in prison]] without the possibility of parole. "I apologize for my behavior. I am shamed by it," Hanssen told U.S. District Judge [[Claude M. Hilton|Claude Hilton]]. "I have opened the door for calumny against my totally innocent wife and children. I have hurt so many deeply."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Hanssen is [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]] prisoner #48551-083. He is serving his sentence at the [[ADX Florence]], a federal [[supermax prison]] near [[Florence, Colorado|Florence]], [[Colorado]], in [[solitary confinement]] for twenty-three hours a day.&lt;ref name="sullivan"&gt;Laura Sullivan, [[National Public Radio]]  [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5579901 ''Timeline: Solitary Confinement in US Prisons''] July 26, 2006.

[[Federal Bureau of Prisons]]. Retrieved January 5, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modus operandi==
Hanssen never told the KGB or GRU his identity and refused to meet them personally, with the exception of the abortive 1993 contact in the Russian embassy parking garage. The FBI believes the Russians never knew the name of their source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Going by the alias "Ramon" or "Ramon Garcia,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|p=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanssen exchanged intelligence and payments through an old-fashioned dead drop system in which he and his KGB handlers would leave packages in public, unobtrusive places.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; He refused to use the dead drop sites that his handler, [[Victor Cherkashin]], suggested and instead picked his own. He also designated a code to be used when dates were exchanged. Six was to be added to the month, day, and time of a designated drop time, so that, for example, a drop scheduled for January 6 at 1&amp;nbsp;pm would be written as July 12 at 7&amp;nbsp;pm.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Harvnb|Cherkashin|Feifer|2005|p=230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these efforts at caution and security, he could at times be reckless. He once said in a letter to the KGB that it should emulate the management style of [[Mayor of Chicago]] [[Richard J. Daley]]&amp;nbsp;– a comment that easily could have led an investigator to look at people from Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took the risk of recommending to his handlers that they try to recruit his closest friend, a colonel in the [[United States Army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an early letter to Cherkashin, he claims, "As far as the funds are concerned, I have little need or utility for more than the $100,000."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cherkashin|Feifer|2005|p=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
According to ''[[USA Today]]'', those who knew the Hanssens described them as a close family. They attended [[mass (liturgy)|Mass]] weekly and were very active in [[Opus Dei]]. Hanssen's three sons attended [[The Heights School (Maryland)|The Heights School]] in [[Potomac, Maryland]], an all-boys [[university-preparatory school|preparatory school]].&lt;ref&gt;CI Centre {{cite web |url=http://cicentre.com/Documents/DOC_Quotes_Robert_Hanssen_Case.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204000128/http://www.cicentre.com/Documents/DOC_Quotes_Robert_Hanssen_Case.htm |archivedate=February 4, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}. Retrieved February 20, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; His daughters attended [[Oakcrest School|Oakcrest School for Girls]] in [[Vienna, Virginia]], an independent [[Roman Catholic]] school. Both schools are associated with Opus Dei. Hanssen's wife Bonnie still teaches [[theology]] at Oakcrest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oakcrest.org/academics/faculty-and-staff/] Faculty and Staff Directory for Oakcrest School for Girls&lt;/ref&gt;

A priest at Oakcrest said that Hanssen had regularly attended a 6:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. daily mass for more than a decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shannon|Blackman|2002|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opus Dei member Father [[C. John McCloskey III]] said he also occasionally attended the daily noontime mass at the Catholic Information Center in downtown Washington. After going to prison, Hanssen claimed he periodically admitted his espionage to priests in [[Confession (religion)|confession]]. He urged fellow Catholics in the Bureau to attend mass more often and denounced the Russians, even though he was spying for them, as "godless".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|pp=85–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, at Hanssen's suggestion, and without the knowledge of his wife, a friend named Jack Horschauer, a retired Army officer, would sometimes [[candaulism|watch the Hanssens having sex]] through a bedroom window. Hanssen then began to secretly videotape his sexual encounters and shared the videotapes with Horschauer. Later, he hid a video camera in the bedroom that was connected via closed-circuit television line so that his friend could observe the Hanssens from his guest bedroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|pp=252–253}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also explicitly described the sexual details of his marriage on Internet chat rooms, giving information sufficient for those who knew them to recognize the couple.&lt;ref&gt;[[CNN]], American Morning with Paula Zahn [http://archives.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0201/08/ltm.08.html Look at FBI Spy Robert Hannsen] January 8, 2002. Retrieved January 31, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hanssen frequently visited D.C. strip clubs, and spent a great deal of time with a Washington [[stripper]] named Priscilla Sue Galey. She went with Hanssen on a trip to [[Hong Kong]], and on a visit to the FBI training facility in [[Quantico, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; He gave her money, jewels, and a used [[Mercedes-Benz]], but cut off contact with her before his arrest, when she fell into drug abuse and [[prostitution]]. Galey claims that although she offered to sleep with him, Hanssen declined, saying that he was trying to convert her to Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20041114093843/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/05/22/hanssen.stripper/ Ex-stripper describes her time with accused spy] CNN.

==In the media==
The story is mentioned in Ronald Kessler's book ''The Secrets of the FBI'', both in Chapter 15, "Catching Hanssen," and Chapter 16, "Breach."{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Eric O'Neill's role in the capture of Robert Hanssen was dramatized in the 2007 film ''[[Breach (film)|Breach]]'', in which [[Chris Cooper]] played the role of Hanssen and [[Ryan Phillippe]] played O'Neill.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0401997/ Breach] IMDB Movie Database. Retrieved 6 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2007 documentary ''Superspy: The Man Who Betrayed the West'' describes the hunt to trap Hanssen. He also was the subject of a 2002 made-for-television movie, ''[[Master Spy: The Robert Hanssen Story]]'', with the teleplay by [[Norman Mailer]] and starring [[William Hurt]] as Hanssen. Hanssen's jailers allowed him to watch this movie, but he was so angered by it that he turned it off.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|p=302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hanssen is mentioned in chapter 5 of [[Dan Brown]]'s book ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'', as the most noted Opus Dei member to non-members. Because of his sexual deviancy and espionage conviction, the organization's reputation was badly hurt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Dan|title=The Da Vinci Code|date=2009-03-31|location=Chapter 5|isbn=0307474275|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hanssen's story is reviewed on season 2, episode 4 of ''[[Mysteries at the Museum]]''. Actual footage of his arrest by FBI agents is included. His story is the last segment of four included in this episode.

The American Court TV (now [[TruTV]]) television series ''Mugshots'' released an episode on the Robert Hanssen case titled "Robert Hanssen - Hanssen and the KGB".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MUGSHOTS: ROBERT HANSSEN – HANSSEN AND THE KGB|url=http://filmrise.com/mugshots-robert-hanssen-hanssen-and-the-kgb/|website=FilmRise|accessdate=8 November 2017|date=1 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006212217/http://filmrise.com/mugshots-robert-hanssen-hanssen-and-the-kgb/|archive-date=October 6, 2017|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RockCorps is not a non-profit organization, instead partners with a brand partner in each country, creating a marketing and communication platform that combines entertainment and community work. When launched in 2005 in the USA, RockCorps partnered with Boost Mobile and was known as 'Boost Mobile RockCorps'. In the UK, France and Israel RockCorps is partnered with Orange and is known as 'Orange RockCorps'. In the UK in 2008 and 2009 RockCorps was also partnered with [[Sony Ericsson]]. This changed to [[BlackBerry]] in 2010.

==History==

RockCorps sprang from the work of the Greenbucks Foundation in the USA. Active in the mid-'90s, Greenbucks staged its initial concerts in Telluride and encouraged local residents to clean up the outdoor concert space in order to earn a ticket.

RockCorps' first nationwide effort in 2005 with partner Boost Mobile, a wireless telecommunications company. In its first year, the Boost Mobile RockCorps (BMRC) movement staged events in six U.S. cities and had 5,000 volunteers who generated 20,000 hours of service. In 2007, Boost Mobile RockCorps expanded the program to 11 cities and over 15,000 volunteers. BMRC had a total of over 30,000 American volunteers and travelled to over 13 U.S. cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Taking Back Sunday to headline live tour dates for Boost Mobile RockCorps| work =| publisher = starpulse.com| date = June 7, 2007| url = http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2007/06/07/taking_back_sunday_to_headline_live_tour| format =| doi =| accessdate = January 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

RockCorps expanded to the UK in 2008, announcing in April its partnership with mobile operator Orange.

==Leadership==

==The Collective==

In 2009 RockCorps launched 'The Collective'. 'The Collective' is the anywhere/anytime part of the project. It rewards volunteers who give to their community, but who may not be able to make a project or gig. Volunteers have to give 4 hours of their time wherever, whenever they want and they become a part of 'The Collective community' by sharing their experience with their peers through The Collective website. Collective members are offered exclusive tickets and are entered into prize draws. Prizes have included [[Ticketmaster]] vouchers, tickets to RockCorps gigs in other countries, and exclusive access to other concerts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Orange RockCorps expands its nationwide campaign The Collective| publisher = aaamusic.co.uk| date = August 9, 2010| url = http://www.aaamusic.co.uk/2010/08/09/orange-rockcorps-expands-its-nationwide-campaign-the-collective| accessdate = January 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many '''fictional depictions of the [[Romani people|Romani]]''' in literature and art present Romanticized narratives of their supposed mystical powers of [[fortune telling]], and their supposed irascible or passionate temper paired with an indomitable love of freedom and a habit of criminality. Critics of how Romani people have been portrayed in popular culture point out similarities to [[Racial antisemitism|portrayals of Jewish people]], with both groups stereotyped negatively as wandering, spreading disease, abducting children, and violating and murdering others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mayall|first=David|title=Gypsy Identities 1500-2000: From Egipcyans and Moon-men to the Ethnic Romany|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0415566371|page=266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3065">'''Sarah Page''' (26 August 1863 &amp;ndash; 20 January 1950), also known as '''Sarah Saunders Page''', was a New Zealand teacher, feminist, prohibitionist, socialist, social reformer, and politician.

[[File:Samuel Page 1907.jpg|thumb|upright|Samuel Page, her husband, in 1907]]
Sarah Saunders was born in [[Waimea Plains, Tasman|Waimea South]], [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]], New Zealand in 1863. She was one of ten children of [[Alfred Saunders]], a radical politician, and grew up surrounded by [[Quakers]]. In 1896, she married Samuel Page, who was a science demonstrator at [[Canterbury Museum, Christchurch|Canterbury Museum]] and like herself a Quaker. They were to have two sons.&lt;ref name="DNZB Page" /&gt;

With [[Ada Wells]], she was a dominating influence on the Canterbury Women's Institute. She was also active with the [[National Council of Women of New Zealand]] and was the organisation's secretary in 1905–06. She was an ardent critic of conscription and upset Prime Minister [[William Massey]] and the Minister of Internal Affairs, [[George Warren Russell]], with her criticism. Her son Robin was a conscientious objector and was imprisoned in 1918.&lt;ref name="DNZB Page" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=General Items |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=BH19180128.2.21 |accessdate=5 December 2015 |work=Bruce Herald |volume=LIV |issue=7 |date=28 January 1918 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Labour Party developed into a strong party in the 1920s, Page's extreme left views became less accepted and her influence faded. She died in 1950 and is buried at [[Sydenham Cemetery]] next to her husband, who died in 1944.&lt;ref name="DNZB Page"&gt;{{DNZB|Bohan|Edmund|3p1|Sarah Page|December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''scientific celebrity''' is a person who gains [[celebrity]] status in the media by representing their own [[scientific]] interests. Such promotion can be self-serving in nature, can be at the behest of governmental or corporate interests or even to promote the science involved.

With every new scientific discovery various people have long been known for their contributions to knowledge, medicine and methods of transportation. Although this phenomenon has undergone a recent upsurgence (coincidental with the rise of [[celebrity culture]]), it is by no means new and the list of scientific celebrities is long.

Many other people have become known to the public as a result of media promotion. Heads of state, heads of governmental units and religious leaders have long enjoyed this attention in representing interests other than their own.

==Media celebrities==
Some [[television presenter]]s such as [[Richard Attenborough]], [[Patrick Moore]] and [[David Attenborough]] have scientific qualifications, and some like [[Bill Nye]] have engineering qualifications,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill Nye Biography|url=http://www.billnye.com/about-bill-nye/biography/|accessdate=26 February 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20100202163649/http://www.billnye.com/about-bill-nye/biography/|archivedate=2 February 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but these presenters are primarily known for their own presentations of scientific topics rather than their contributions to the advance of scientific knowledge. Additionally, some celebrities are known for their roles in the media but not for their work in science, for example [[Mayim Bialik]], one of the stars of the television show The Big Bang Theory who has a PhD in [[neuroscience]]. For a list of persons who have made major discoveries in the sciences, see the articles for specific areas of scientific knowledge and discovery.

==Biography==
Tabassum Adnan was born in 1977 and grew up in the Swat Valley of [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="Majeed (2013)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Majeed|first1=A|title=Pakistan’s Women-Only Jirga Fights for Equal Rights|url=http://newsweekpakistan.com/pakistans-women-only-jirga-fights-for-equal-rights/|accessdate=15 March 2015|publisher=Newsweek Pakistan|date=11 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was a child bride at 13, mother of four and a victim of domestic violence, when she divorced her husband of 20 years. Finding herself homeless and without means of support,&lt;ref name="Women of Courage (2015)" /&gt; Adnan attended a [[women's empowerment]] program run by a local aid group. It inspired her to work to change women's ability to participate in decision-making processes. Initially she approached the male-only, main Swat  Aman [[Jirga]], but was rejected.&lt;ref name="Majeed (2013)" /&gt; Jirgas are traditional informal judicial councils which enforce ''[[qisas]]'', retribution laws,&lt;ref name="Saach TV (2014)"&gt;{{cite news|title=Girl wants husband punished for chopping off her nose|url=http://www.saach.tv/2014/07/03/girl-wants-husband-punished-for-chopping-off-her-nose/|accessdate=15 March 2015|publisher=Saach TV|date=July 3, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150408094225/http://www.saach.tv/2014/07/03/girl-wants-husband-punished-for-chopping-off-her-nose/|archivedate=8 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and though not intended to replace  formal judicial systems or police procedures, decisions of the elders are socially respected and do often impact the judiciary.&lt;ref name="Siddiqui (2014)" /&gt;

In May 2013, Adnan started her own jirga,&lt;ref name="Siddiqui (2014)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Siddiqui|first1=Taha|title=World Asia: South &amp; Central In former Taliban fiefdom, Pakistan's first female council tackles abuses|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-South-Central/2014/0304/In-former-Taliban-fiefdom-Pakistan-s-first-female-council-tackles-abuses|accessdate=15 March 2015|publisher=The Christian Science Monitor|date=March 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first run by women in the country. Traditionally, women in the region have been used as [[Personal property|chattel]] to settle disputes of men, traded in marriage to absolve debts, claims of honor, and retribution for crimes. Because women have little power, Adnan recognized that her group would need to pressure authorities to act. Her 25-member all-female jirga pressures police and the traditional court system to act while providing legal assistance to the victims.&lt;ref name="Ali (2013)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ali|first1=Syed Mohammad|title=Significance of the female jirga|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/588473/significance-of-the-female-jirga/|accessdate=15 March 2015|publisher=The Express Tribune|date=August 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Khwendo Jirga'', or Sister’s Council, in addition to providing justice support for women advocate for free education for girls; protection of women and girl's health; training in both traditional domestic and non-traditional [[Vocational education|vocational]] skills; [[Microfinance|microfinancing]], access for women to peace negotiations, justice, and voting; and laws which protect women from violence,&lt;ref name="Siraj (2013)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Siraj|first1=Haroon|title=Female jirga head flays ‘flawed’ legal system|url=http://www.pakistangendernews.org/female-jirga-head-flays-flawed-legal-system/|accessdate=15 March 2015|publisher=Pakistan Gender News|date=July 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically, [[Honour killing in Pakistan|honor killings]], [[Dowry death|dowry harassments]],&lt;ref name="Telugu News (2015)"&gt;{{cite news|title=పాక్ మహిళకు అమెరికా అవార్డు.. సాహస స్త్రీగా ఎంపిక..!|url=http://telugu.webdunia.com/article/international-news/pakistan-activist-honored-with-international-women-of-courage-award-115030600012_1.html|accessdate=15 March 2015|publisher=తెలుగు వార్తలు|date=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Acid throwing|acid attacks]], and torture. Initially the ''Khwendo Jirga'' was opposed both by men's jirgas and prominent women's rights activists.&lt;ref name="Guerin (2013)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Guerin|first1=Orla|title=Pakistani women use jirga to fight for rights|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-23453243|accessdate=15 March 2015|publisher=BBC News|date=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 an event happened, which changed the public perception of Adnan's group. A child was raped and the authorities failed to act. ''Khwendo Jirga'' organized a protest walk bringing visibility to the case. The suspects were apprehended and for the first time in Pashtun history, a woman, Adnan, was asked to sit on the male jirga and assist with dispensing justice in the case.&lt;ref name="N-Peace Network"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tabassum Adnan A monumental moment for Pashtun women|url=http://n-peace.net/candidate/candidate-341|publisher=N-Peace Network|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the first protest, the women have repeated the success&lt;ref name="Ul Islam (2014)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ul Islam|first1=Nazar|title=Nobody Cares|url=http://newsweekpakistan.com/nobody-cares/|accessdate=15 March 2015|publisher=Newsweek Pakistan|date=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in July, 2014, Adnan and Khwendo Jirga were lobbying for the passage of a law prohibiting child marriages.&lt;ref name="InayatUSA (2014)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Inayat|first1=Naila|title=Cultures clash over forced child marriages in Pakistan|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/06/07/pakistan-child-marriage/10003047/|accessdate=15 March 2015|publisher=USA Today|date=June 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite strong protest from religious factors,&lt;ref name="InayatWP (2014)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Inayat|first1=Naila|title=Muslim clerics resist Pakistan’s efforts to end child marriage|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/religion/muslim-clerics-resist-pakistans-efforts-to-end-child-marriage/2014/05/16/c48f9c04-dd25-11e3-a837-8835df6c12c4_story.html|accessdate=15 March 2015|publisher=The Washington Post|date=May 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Sindh Assembly]] unanimously passed a ban on marriages for anyone under the age of eighteen&lt;ref name="Asif (2014)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Asif|first1=Sundas|title=Child Marriages Restraint Bill passed unanimously|url=http://tastepakistan.pk/child-marriages-restraint-bill-passed-unanimously/|accessdate=15 March 2015|publisher=Taste Pakistan|date=June 5, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150315183618/http://tastepakistan.pk/child-marriages-restraint-bill-passed-unanimously/|archivedate=15 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in December, 2014 the [[Provincial Assembly of the Punjab|Punjab Assembly]] unanimously passed a resolution to work on amending the present law.&lt;ref name=Shaukat&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shaukat|first1=Aroosa|title=PA session: Lawmakers pass resolution against child marriages|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/811330/pa-session-lawmakers-pass-resolution-against-child-marriages/|accessdate=15 March 2015|publisher=The Express Tribune|date=December 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since their first success with the men's jirga, Adnan has been invited to participate on other cases dealing with "women's issues." Though she still receives threats Adnan continues, as she believes that women should be part of the decision-making processes that effect their lives.&lt;ref name="Siddiqui (2014)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Balochistan (2015)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=بلوچ|first1=سحر|title=سوات کی خواتین کے لیے منفرد جرگہ|url=http://www.dawnnews.tv/news/1017344|accessdate=15 March 2015|publisher=Dawn News Urdu|date=February 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pakistan Defence"&gt;{{cite news|title=Swat activist honored with International Women of Courage Award|url=http://defence.pk/threads/swat-activist-honored-with-international-women-of-courage-award.362866/|accessdate=15 March 2015|publisher=Pakistan Defence|date=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2128">'''Trigger list''' in its most general meaning refers to a list whose items are used to initiate ("trigger") certain actions.

== United States: Private financial information==

In the [[United States]], when a person applies for a [[mortgage loan]], the [[lender]] makes a credit inquiry about the potential borrower from the national credit bureaus, [[Equifax]], [[Experian]] and [[TransUnion]]. Unless the borrower is opted out, the credit bureaus put the applicants  onto a "trigger list" of "leads" about persons who are interested in new loans. These lists are sold to numerous lenders all over the United States, and soon after the application the applicant starts receiving offers from all parts of the country. The trigger lists contain a significant amount of personal financial information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://realtytimes.com/rtcpages/20060911_mortgageapps.htm Home Mortgage Applications "Trigger" Sales of Private Financial Information]&lt;/ref&gt; Among the buyers of trigger lists are "lead generators" which resell filtered information to borrowers, e.g., of people who live in a certain area and have a certain [[credit score]].

While the [[Federal Trade Commission]] considers the market of "trigger lists" to be a legal business, many people and organizations (such as the [[National Association of Mortgage Brokers]]) consider this a serious breach of privacy and lobby for putting this practice under regulatory controls.

As of now, American consumers may [[opt-out]] from "trigger lists" by calling  1-888-5-OPTOUT (1-888-567-8688). &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/protect.shtm FTC.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nuclear non-proliferation==
The [[Zangger Committee]] and the [[Nuclear Suppliers Group]] maintain lists of items that may contribute to nuclear proliferation; The [[nuclear non-proliferation treaty]] forbids its members to export such items to non-treaty members. these items are said to trigger the countries' responsibilities under the NPT, hence the name.

The '''Vanniyar''', who were once known as the '''Palli''', are a community or ''[[jāti]]'' found in Southern India.

==Etymology==
Several etymologyies for ''Vanniyar'' have been suggested, including the [[Sanskrit]] ''vahni'' ("fire"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Lorna Srimathie |last=Dewaraja |title=A study of the political, administrative, and social structure of the Kandyan Kingdom of Ceylon, 1707-1760 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j5w5AQAAIAAJ |year=1972 |publisher=Lake House Investments |page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] ''val'' ("strength"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Alf |last=Hiltebeitel |authorlink=Alf Hiltebeitel |title=The Cult of Draupadī: Mythologies: From Gingee to Kurukserta |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VncomfRVVhoC&amp;pg=PA38 |year=1991 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1000-6 |page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the Sanskrit or [[Pali]] ''vana'' ("forest").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Subramanian |last=Gopalakrishnan |title=The Nayaks of Sri Lanka, 1739-1815: Political Relations with the British in South India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bG1uAAAAMAAJ |year=1988 |publisher=New Era Publications |page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical status==
Researcher [[Lloyd I. Rudolph]] notes that as early as in 1833, the Vanniyar, who were then known as Pallis, had ceased to accept their "low caste" status, more specifically described as that of shudra by [[Christophe Jaffrelot]] and [[Kathleen Gough]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Rise of the Plebeians?: The Changing Face of the Indian Legislative Assemblies |first=Christophe |last=Jaffrelot |authorlink=Christophe Jaffrelot |page=447 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tDN0MinxMigC&amp;pg=PA447}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Rural Society in Southeast India |first=Kathleen |last=Gough |authorlink=Kathleen Gough |publisher=Cambridge University press |page=24 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GZwD7EqLcAUC&amp;pg=PA24}}&lt;/ref&gt; They tried to get an order in [[Pondicherry]] that by descent they were not a low agricultural caste. In preparation for the [[Census of India prior to independence|1871 Indian census]] they petitioned to be recognised as being of the [[kshatriya]] (warrior) ''[[varna (Hinduism)|varna]]'' of Hindu society. By 1931, due to their successful politicking (a process known as [[sanskritisation]]), the term ''Palli'' was removed from the [[Chennai|Madras]] census, with the term ''Vanniya Kula Kshatriya'' appearing instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Lloyd I. |last=Rudolph |authorlink=Lloyd I. Rudolph |title=The Modernity of Tradition: Political Development in India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7guY1ut-0lwC&amp;pg=PA49 |year=1984 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-73137-7 |pages=49–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pallis formed a number of caste organisations using their preferred name, with the Vanniyakula Kshatriya Maha Sangam appearing in Madras in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chockalingam |first=Joe Arun |title=Constructing Dalit Identity |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z0JuAAAAMAAJ |year=2007 |publisher=Rawat Publications |isbn=978-81-316-0081-8 |page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present==
Traditionally, most Vanniyars are agricultural labourers. Increasingly, however, they are benefiting from political influence and organisation and they now own 50 per cent of the lands of the traditional landowners. The Vanniyars who previously were of the [[Other Backward Class|Backward Class]] category, were now designated as a Most Backward Caste after successful agitations by them in the 1980s. The reason for the agitation and subsequent re-classification was to avail more government benefits for the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.india-seminar.com/2012/633/633_hugo_gorringe.htm |title=Caste and politics in Tamil Nadu |first=Hugo |last=Gorringe |publisher=India Seminar |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pattali Makkal Katchi]] political party was formed from the Vanniyar Sangam, a caste association. It has been known on occasion for its violent protests against [[Dalit]] people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=The Telegraph |title=Senior Ramadoss arrested |date=1 May 2013 |url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/1130501/jsp/nation/story_16846810.jsp |accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vannimai==
The [[Vannimai]] chieftains in what is now [[Sri Lanka]] arose from a multi-ethnic and multi-caste background. A [[primary source]], the ''[[Yalpana Vaipava Malai]]'', states that some were descended from Vanniyar caste immigrants from modern [[Tamil Nadu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Indrapala |first=K. |date=1970 |title=The Origin of the Tamil Vanni Chieftancies of the Ceylon |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GV3abjkKdB4C&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=vanniyar+arcot |journal=Ceylon Journal of the Humanities |publisher=University of Sri Lanka |volume=1 |pages=111–140 |doi= |access-date=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=May 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sivaratnam|first=C. |year=1968 |title=Tamils in early Ceylon |journal= |oclc=248358279|publisher= |volume= |issue= |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hlocAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Kulakoddan&amp;dq=Kulakoddan&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=68u4S6OtEtOy-Aa3-6W2Dw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAQ |doi=|quote=As for cultivators he got down fifty one tribes of Vanniyars, a caste of agriculture experts from the Pandyan coasts&amp;nbsp;... on the invitation of Kulakoddan in c 493 for the noble purpose of cultivating the land at Tambalakamam.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McGilvray |first=Dennis B. |title= Mukkuvar Vannimai: Tamil Caste and Matriclan Ideology in Batticaloa, Sri Lanka |pages=34–97 |year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=May 2015}}&lt;ref name=K&gt;{{cite book |author=Karthigesu |title=Sri Lankan Tamil Society and Politics |pages=7–9 |isbn=81-234-0395-X |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=May 2015}} Some Sri Lankan historians derive the title ''Vannimai'' from the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] word ''vanam'', meaning "forest", with ''Vannia'' or ''Wannia'' meaning "person from the forest", and ''Vannimais'' being large tracts of forested land.&lt;ref name=K/&gt;

==Malayaman==
Many castes today claim descent from [[Malayaman]]. Dennis B. McGilvray states "Malayaman is a section of the Udaiyar caste in South Arcot today, but [[Burton Stein]] also finds the title in a thirteenth-century inscription identifying Vanniyar subcastes of South Arcot in the left-right caste classification typical of the Chola empire."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Dennis B. |last=McGilvray |title=Crucible of Conflict: Tamil and Muslim Society on the East Coast of Sri Lanka |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MgHIiEtdVFAC&amp;pg=PA372|accessdate=10 July 2013 |year=2008 |publisher=Duke University Press |isbn=978-0-8223-8918-7 |page=372}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14138">'''Welfare reforms''' are changes in the operation of a given welfare system, with the goals of reducing the number of individuals dependent on government assistance, keeping the welfare systems affordable, and assisting recipients become self-sufficient. [[Classical liberalism|Classical liberals]], [[Libertarianism|libertarians]], and [[Conservatism|conservatives]] generally argue that welfare and other tax-funded services reduce incentives to work, exacerbate the [[free-rider problem]], and intensify poverty. Socialists, on the other hand, generally [[Criticisms of welfare|criticize welfare]] reform because it usually minimizes the public [[Social safety net|safety net]], and strengthens the capitalist economic system. Welfare reform is constantly debated because of the varying opinions on the government's determined balance of providing guaranteed welfare benefits, and promoting self-sufficiency.

== Overview == 
Within the last two decades, welfare systems have been under extreme scrutiny around the world. Demographic changes like the post-war "baby boom" followed by the subsequent “baby bust,” coupled with economic shifts such as the 1970 oil shocks, led to aging populations and a dwindling working force. In turn, there became an increased dependency on social welfare systems, which inevitably brought up the issue of welfare reform. U.S systems primarily focused on reducing poor single-parents need for welfare, through employment incentives. The U.K focused primarily on reducing general unemployment through the New Deal. The Netherlands emphasized reforming disability programs, and Latin America focused primarily on pension reforms.

German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck was one political leader who attempted to put an end to socialism by proposing government healthcare. He approved the 1883 Health Insurance Act which was the first to introduce compulsory government-monitored health insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ssa.gov/history/ottob.html|title=Social Security History|website=www.ssa.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German legislation ensured contributory retirement and disability benefits. Participation became mandatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/germany/112.htm|title=Germany - Social Insurance and Welfare Programs|website=countrystudies.us|access-date=2018-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many historians trace the beginnings of contemporary welfare in Europe and America to Bismarck's Health Insurance law. However, this welfare program intended for the working class was practiced by the Roman Empire, China's Song Dynasty, and the 7th Century Islamic System.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/bismarck-tried-end-socialisms-grip-offering-government-healthcare-180964064/|title=Bismarck Tried to End Socialism’s Grip—By Offering Government Healthcare|last=Boissoneault|first=Lorraine|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2018-06-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the Great Depression and 1929 crash of the stock market contributed significantly to the formation of the concept of welfare as many Americans struggled economically during those times.

Johnson declared his administration's War on Poverty in 1964 as the poverty rate increased by 19%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/celeb/Lyndon_Johnson_Welfare_+_Poverty.htm|title=Lyndon Johnson on Welfare &amp; Poverty|website=www.ontheissues.org|access-date=2018-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He funded welfare programs like  [[Social Security Act|Social Security]], [[Food Stamps]], [[Job Corps]], and [[Head Start (program)|Head Start]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/08/war-on-poverty-more-than-feeding-poor|title=President Johnson's war on poverty was about more than feeding and housing the poor {{!}} Ana Marie Cox|last=Cox|first=Ana Marie|date=2014-01-08|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The War on Poverty included programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. It provided the first direct federal assistance for school districts, milestone environmental law, urban renewal, civil rights, subsidy for bilingual education, and national donations for arts and humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/celeb/Lyndon_Johnson_Welfare_+_Poverty.htm|title=Lyndon Johnson on Welfare &amp; Poverty|website=www.ontheissues.org|access-date=2018-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Richard Nixon| Richard Nixon's]] administration proposed the 1969 Family Assistance Plan,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nixonfoundation.org/2014/06/family-assistance-plan-families-can-succeed/|title=#FamiliesSucceed: President Nixon's Family Assistance Plan » Richard Nixon Foundation|date=2014-06-23|work=Richard Nixon Foundation|access-date=2018-06-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would require all welfare recipients, excluding mothers with children under the age of three, to work. This program stopped in 1972 and liberals criticized the plan for providing too little support, and requiring too strict of work regulations. Instead of welfare reforms, the government ended up providing major expansions to welfare programs during this presidency.

In 1980, President Ronald Reagan cut [[Aid to Families with Dependent Children|Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC)]] spending&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Social Welfare Under Reagan|url=http://library.cqpress.com/cqresearcher/document.php?id=cqresrre1984030900|journal=CQ Researcher by CQ Press|language=en|issn=1942-5635}}&lt;/ref&gt; and gave states the option of requiring welfare recipients to participate in workfare programs. [[Charles Murray (political scientist)|Charles Murray's]] book [[Losing Ground (book)|Losing Ground]]: American Social Policy, 1950–1980 (1984) argued that the [[Welfare state]] actually harms the poor, especially single-parent families, by making them increasingly dependent on the government, and discouraging them from working.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/11/us/q-a-charles-murray-of-babies-and-stick.html|title=Q&amp;A: Charles Murray; Of Babies And Stick|last=Times|first=Robert Pear and Special To the New York|access-date=2018-06-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murray proposed that current welfare programs be replaced by short-term local programs.&lt;ref&gt;"Welfare."

On August 22, 1996, President Bill Clinton signed the [[Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act|Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act]] of 1996 (PRWORA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.history.com/news/clinton-1990s-welfare-reform-facts|title=How Bill Clinton’s Welfare Reform Changed America|work=HISTORY|access-date=2018-06-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton's reform aligned closely with Charles Murray. In his [[Bill Clinton presidential campaign, 1992|1992 campaign]] Clinton promised to “end welfare as we have come to know it.” Staying true to his promise, he instated one of the most well-known welfare reforms in US History.&lt;ref&gt;[Clinton, Bill (October 23, 1991). "The New Covenant: Responsibility and Rebuilding the American Community. Remarks to Students at Georgetown University".Democratic Leadership Council. Retrieved 2018-03-08.]&lt;/ref&gt; PRWORA instituted the [[Temporary Assistance for Needy Families]] program (TANF) to replace the AFDC, the former welfare program providing cash to poor families since 1935. TANF instated [[Temporary Assistance for Needy Families|work restrictions]]  in order for recipients to qualify for aid. TANF also shifted welfare to the state governments, where each state was given an allocation of money to be used for this program, as long as there existed work requirements, and a five-year limit for families on welfare.&lt;ref&gt;[Schott, Liz. 2011. Policy Basics: An Introduction to TANF. Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Accessed 03/07/2018 from http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=936]&lt;/ref&gt; The general premise behind this reform was that aid should not be a one-way handout.

State governments have established and currently administer welfare programs for the welfare of the impoverished but operating in accordance with guidelines of the federal government. Funds for these programs are remitted to states in the form of block grants giving them more flexibility in making decisions on how money will be allocated among different welfare programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/welfare-reform-in-the-united-states-3321425|title=Welfare Reform in the United States|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
====New Deal====
{{Main|New Deal (UK)}}
In recent years reform of the welfare system in Britain began with the introduction of the New Deal programme &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/newsroom_and_speeches/press/1997/press_145_97.cfm |title=[ARCHIVED CONTENT&amp;#93; Press: 1997-145 |publisher=Hm-treasury.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour government]] in 1997. The aim of this programme was to increase employment through requiring that recipients make serious efforts to seek employment. The Labour Party also introduced a system of tax credits for low-income workers.

====Welfare Reform Act 2007====
{{Main|Welfare Reform Act 2007}}
The Welfare Reform Act 2007  provides for "an employment and support allowance, a contributory allowance, [and] an income-based allowance.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Primary&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;NavFrom=2&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=3339981&amp;activetextdocid=3340090 |title=Welfare Reform Act 2007 |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The objectives of the Welfare Reform Act of 2007 were to increase the employment rate to 80% from 75%,  to assist 300,000 single parents find employment, to increase the number of workers over 50 by 1 million, and to reduce the number of people claiming incapacity benefits by 1 million.

====Welfare Reform Act 2009====
{{Main|Welfare Reform Act 2009}}
This welfare reform proposed an increase of personal responsibility within the welfare system. The reform eliminated Income support, and allocated funds over to the Jobseeker's allowance, to encourage employment. It also encouraged increased parental responsibility by amending child support laws, and requiring births be registered jointly by both parents.&lt;ref&gt;“Welfare Reform Act 2009.” Welfare Reform Act 2009 - UK Parliament, services.parliament.uk/bills/2008-09/welfarereform.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Welfare Reform Act 2012====
{{Main|Welfare Reform Act 2012}}
This welfare reform proposed changes to the [[Housing Benefit]], which reduced the benefit paid to recipients depending on the size of their living space. This act got the nickname of the “Bedroom Tax.” from the media.&lt;ref&gt;O'Hagan, Ellie Mae (1 April 2013). "The bedroom tax's authors were either careless or cruel – it must be fought". The Guardian. Retrieved 6 March 2018.
&lt;/ref&gt; It was stated that similarly to other welfare reforms, this act would reduce welfare dependency.

=== France ===
Beginning in the mid-1970s, a deficit in the social insurance program began to appear. The deficit saw peaks at 27.75% of the social insurance budget in 1992. This led to a major push by the government to cut back spending in the welfare program. By the end of the 1990s the deficit had been almost completely eradicated. The often large deficits that the program has endured has led to a tremendous amount of opposition to the program as it stands.

=== Brazil ===
During the [[2015–2018 Brazilian economic crisis]], there has been both economic and political turmoil. President [[Dilma Rousseff]], who was later impeached and replaced by President [[Michel Temer]], strived to expand the social welfare program [[Bolsa Família]] instated by her predecessor [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]]. As a social-democrat, Rousseff pledged that "Brazil will continue to grow, with social inclusion and mobility."&lt;ref&gt;AFP. "Nos EUA, Dilma se manifesta contra privatização de empresas do setor elétrico e da Petrobras". Zero Hora. 06 March 2018.
&lt;/ref&gt; When Michel Temer took office, to cope with the severe economic recession, he proposed social welfare reforms to change labor rules and the social security pension system. Temer's plan included limiting pension benefits and raising the retirement age in order to save money and fix the economy. Additionally, under his reform, companies have greater power to require longer work days and use part-time workers. In response to this reform, labor unions, rural workers, and government employees held protests all over Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;Voa. “Brazilians Protest against President's Reform Plan.” VOA, VOA, 17 Mar. 2017, learningenglish.voanews.com/a/brazilians-protest-against-presidents-reform-plan/3769485.html.
&lt;/ref&gt; The vote to approve the pension reform was first suspended until February 2018, and now has been further postponed as a campaign issue in this year's election. Temer's critics believe that the reason for the postponed reform is its vast public disapproval.&lt;ref&gt;Boadle, Anthony. “Brazil Government Acknowledges Pension Bill Going Nowhere.” US News, 19 Feb. 2018, www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2018-02-19/brazils-senate-head-says-rio-military-intervention-blocks-pension-vote.
