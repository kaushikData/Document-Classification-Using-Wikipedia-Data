'''Abstract Meaning Representation''' ('''AMR''') &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amr.isi.edu|title=Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Formal semantics (linguistics)|semantic representation language]]. AMR graphs are rooted, labeled, directed, acyclic graphs ([[Directed acyclic graph|DAGs]]), comprising whole sentences. They are intended to abstract away from syntactic representations, in the sense that sentences which are similar in meaning should be assigned the same AMR, even if they are not identically worded. By nature, the AMR language is biased towards English – it is not meant to function as an international auxiliary language.

'''Achaemenid architecture''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: معماری هخامنشیان) includes all architectural achievements of the [[Achaemenid]] [[Persian people|Persians]] manifesting in construction of spectacular cities used for governance and inhabitation ([[Persepolis]], [[Susa]], [[Ecbatana]]), temples made for worship and social gatherings (such as [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] temples), and [[mausoleums]] erected in honor of fallen kings (such as the burial tomb of [[Cyrus the Great]]). The quintessential feature of Persian architecture was its eclectic nature with elements of Assyrian, Egyptian, Median and Asiatic Greek all incorporated, yet producing a unique Persian identity seen in the finished product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=How to study architecture|author =Charles Henry Caffin|publisher=Dodd, Mead and Company|year=1917|page=80|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HnoWAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Achaemenid architecture is academically classified under [[Iranian architecture|Persian architecture]] in terms of its style and design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Dictionary of Iranian Traditional Architectural Terms (Persian: فرهنگ واژه‌های معماری سنتی ایران) |author=Fallah'far, Sa'id |publisher=Kamyab Publications |year=2010 |pages=44 |isbn=978-964-350-316-1 |url=http://lccn.loc.gov/2010342544 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120713082632/http://lccn.loc.gov/2010342544 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Achaemenid architectural heritage, beginning with the expansion of the empire around 550 B.C.E., was a period of artistic growth that left an extraordinary architectural legacy ranging from Cyrus the Great's solemn tomb in [[Pasargadae]] to the splendid structures of the opulent city of [[Persepolis]].&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{cite book|title=Understanding Architecture|author =Marco Bussagli|publisher=I.B.Tauris|year=2005|page=211|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fMfCkY6-9joC&amp;pg=PA211|isbn=9781845110895}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the advent of the [[Sassanid empire|second Persian Empire]], the [[Sassanid dynasty]] (224–624 C.E.), revived Achaemenid tradition by construction of temples dedicated to fire, and monumental palaces.&lt;ref name=book/&gt;

Perhaps the most striking extant structures to date are the ruins of [[Persepolis]], a once opulent city established by the Achaemenid king, [[Darius the Great]] for governmental and ceremonial functions, and also acting as one of the empire's four capitals. Persepolis, would take 100 years to complete and would finally be ransacked and burnt by the troops of [[Alexander the Great]] in 330 B.C.E.&lt;ref name=gov&gt;{{cite book|title=Ancient cities: the archaeology of urban life in the Ancient Near East and Egypt, Greece and Rome|author =Charles Gates|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2003|pages=186|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8aLb5pnm1j4C&amp;pg=PA186|isbn=9780415121828}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar architectural infrastructures were also erected at [[Susa]] and [[Ecbatana]] by Darius the Great, serving similar functions as [[Persepolis]], such as reception of foreign dignitaries and delegates, performance of imperial ceremonies and duties, and also housing the kings.

==Pasargadae==

===Mausoleum of Cyrus the Great===
[[File:Pasargades cyrus cropped.jpg|thumb|Mausoleum of Cyrus the Great in [[Iran]]]]

[[File:CyrustheGreattombEdifice.jpg|right|thumb|Dimensions of the edifice and pediment roof, without the pyramidal stone structure]]

Despite having ruled over much of the ancient world, Cyrus the Great would design a tomb that depicts extreme simplicity and modesty when compared to those of other ancient kings and rulers. The simplicity of the structure has a powerful effect on the viewer, since aside from a few cyma moldings below the roof and a small rosette above its small entrance, there are no other stylistic distractions.&lt;ref name=ronald&gt;{{cite book|title=The Arts of Persia|author =Ronald W. Ferrier|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1989|pages=27–8|url=https://books.google.com/?id=G2Qkf0h2Pj4C&amp;pg=PA27|isbn =0300039875}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Structural details====
After his death, Cyrus the Great's remains were interred in his capital city of [[Pasargadae]], where today his [[limestone]] tomb (built around 540–530 B.C.E.&lt;ref name=UN&gt;{{cite web|title=Pasargadae|author =UNESCO World Heritage Centre|year=2006|accessdate=December 26, 2010|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1106}}&lt;/ref&gt;) still exists. The translated ancient accounts give a vivid description of the tomb both geometrically and aesthetically; The tomb's geometric shape has changed little over the years, still maintaining a large stone of quadrangular form at the base (forty five feet by forty two feet&lt;ref name=james&gt;{{cite book|title=The palaces of Nineveh and Persepolis restored: an essay on ancient Assyrian and Persian architecture, Volume 5|author =James Fergusson|publisher=J. Murray|year=1851|pages=214–216 &amp; 206–209 (Zoroaster Cube: pp. 206) |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Us0TAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA215}}&lt;/ref&gt;), followed by a pyramidal succession of seven, irregular smaller rectangular stones (possibly as a reference to the seven planets&lt;ref name=james/&gt; of the [[solar system]]) reaching a height of eighteen feet, until the structure is curtailed by a rectangularly formed cubical edifice with a small opening or window on the side, where the slenderest man can barely squeeze through.&lt;ref name=Cleveland&gt;{{cite book|author =((Grk.) Lucius Flavius Arrianus) (En.) Arrian – (trans.) Charles Dexter Cleveland|title=A compendium of classical literature:comprising choice extracts translated from Greek and Roman writers, with biographical sketches|year=1861|publisher=Biddle|pages=313|url=https://books.google.com/?id=SaU1AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA313}}&lt;/ref&gt; The roof of the edifice and indeed the structure, is an elongated limestone [[pediment]].&lt;ref name=james/&gt;

The edifice, or the "small house" is a rectangular, elongated cube that lies directly on top of the pyramidal stone steps, and is {{convert|6+1/2|ft|m|spell=in}} in width, {{convert|6+1/2|ft|m|spell=in}} in height, and {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=on}} in length.&lt;ref name=Aedeen&gt;{{cite book|title=Archaeologica: The World's Most Significant Sites and Cultural Treasures|author =Aedeen Cremin|publisher=frances lincoln Ltd|year=2007|pages=227–29|url=https://books.google.com/?id=A0llBlzF6UgC&amp;pg=PA227&amp;lpg=PA227|isbn=9780711228221}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inside of the edifice is occupied by a small chamber a few feet in width and height, and around ten feet deep. It was inside this chamber where the bed and coffin of Cyrus the Great would have been situated.&lt;ref name=james/&gt; The edifice has a pediment roof possessing the same length and width dimensions as the edifice itself. Around the tomb were a series of columns, the original structure which they supported is no longer present.&lt;ref name=james/&gt; [[Arrian]]'s direct testimony indicates that Cyrus the Great was indeed buried in the chamber inside the edifice, as he describes Alexander seeing it during his visit to Pasargadae, but it is also a possibility that the body of Cyrus the Great had been interred below the structure, and that the tomb seen on the top is in fact a [[cenotaph]] or a false tomb.

There was originally a golden [[coffin]] inside the mausoleum, resting on a table with golden supports, inside of which the body of Cyrus the Great was interred. Upon his resting place, was a covering of tapestry and drapes made from the best available Babylonian materials, using fine Median workmanship; below his bed was a fine red carpet, covering the narrow rectangular base of his tomb.&lt;ref name=Cleveland /&gt;

====History====
Translated Greek accounts describe the tomb as having been placed in the fertile Pasargadae gardens, surrounded by trees and ornamental shrubs, with a group of Achaemenian protectors (the "[[Magi]]"), stationed nearby to protect the edifice from theft or damage.&lt;ref name=Cleveland /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Persia past and present|author =Abraham Valentine Williams Jackson|year=1906|publisher=The Macmillan Company|pages=278|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7pdCAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magi were a group of on-site Zoroastrian observers, located in their separate but attached structure possibly a [[caravanserai]], paid and cared for by the Achaemenid state (by some accounts they received a salary of daily bread and flour, and one sheep payment a day&lt;ref name=james/&gt;). The magi were placed in charge of maintenance and also prevention of theft. Years later, in the ensuing chaos created by [[Alexander the Great]]'s invasion of Persia and loss of a centralized authority directing and caring for the Magi, Cyrus the Great's tomb was broken into and most of its luxuries were looted. When Alexander reached the tomb, he was horrified by the manner in which the tomb was treated, and questioned the Magi and put them to court.&lt;ref name=Cleveland /&gt; On some accounts, Alexander's decision to put the Magi on trial was more about his attempt to undermine their influence and his show of power in his newly conquered empire, than a concern for Cyrus's tomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Monthly review|author1=Ralph Griffiths |author2=George Edward Griffiths |publisher=Printers Street, London|year=1816|pages=509|url=https://books.google.com/?id=hogCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA509}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, Alexander the Great ordered [[Aristobulus of Cassandreia]] to improve the tomb's condition and restore its interior.&lt;ref name=Cleveland /&gt;

The tomb was originally ornamented with an inscription that, according to [[Strabo]] (and other ancient sources), stated:&lt;ref name=Aedeen/&gt;

{{quote|O man! I am Cyrus the Great, who gave the Persians an empire and was the king of Asia. Grudge me not therefore this monument.}}

The edifice has survived the test of time for some 2,500 years. After the Arab invasion into Persia and collapse of the [[Sassanid Empire]], Arab armies wanted to destroy this historical artifact, on the basis that it was not in congruence to their Islamic tenets, but quick thinking on the part of the local Persians prevented this disaster. The Persians renamed the tomb, and presented it to the invading army as the tomb of King [[Solomon]]'s mother. It is likely that the inscription was lost at this time.&lt;ref name=elliot&gt;{{cite book|title=Iran|author1=Andrew Burke |author2=Mark Elliot |publisher=Lonely Planet|year=2008|pages=284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] (Shah of Iran), the last official monarch of Persia, during his [[2,500 year celebration of the Persian Empire]] paid significant homage to the Achaemenid kings and specially Cyrus the Great. Just as Alexander the Great before him, the Shah of Iran wanted to appeal to Cyrus's legacy to legitimize his own rule by extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author =James D. Cockcroft|title=Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, Shah of Iran|publisher=Chelsea House Publishers|year=1989|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JiIEFLxZaJwC|isbn=9781555468477}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shah of Iran however was generally interested in protection of imperial historical artifacts.

After the [[Iranian revolution]], the tomb of Cyrus the Great survived the initial chaos and vandalism propagated by the Islamic revolutionary hardliners who equated Persian imperial historical artifacts with the late Shah of Iran. There are allegations of the tomb being in danger of damage from the construction of the [[Sivand Dam]] on river Polvar (located in the province of [[Fars Province|Pars]]) and water related damage, but there is no official acknowledgement of this claim. [[United Nations]] recognizes the tomb of Cyrus the Great and Pasargadae as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage]] site.&lt;ref name=UN/&gt;

Scholars agree that it was Darius the Great who initiated the construction and expansion of the Persepolis project, however German archaeologist [[Ernst Herzfeld|Ernst E. Herzfeld]], believed that it was Cyrus the Great who chose the site for the construction, although it ultimately came down to Darius the Great to finish the construction and create its impressive buildings. Excavations on behalf of the Oriental Institute of [[Chicago University]], headed by Herzfeld in 1931 and later cooperation by Eric F. Schmidt in 1933 led to some of the most impressive uncovering of Achaemenid artifacts, palaces, and structures. Herzfeld felt that the site of Persepolis was made for special ceremonies and was meant to convey the power of the Achaemenid empire to its subject nations.&lt;ref name=Aedeen/&gt;

On some accounts, Persepolis was never officially finished as its existence was cut short by Alexander the Great, who in a fit of anger, ordered the burning of the city in 330 B.C.E. Started originally by Darius the Great a century earlier, the structure was constantly changing, receiving upgrades from subsequent Persian monarchs, and undergoing renovation to maintain its impressive façade. After the burning of the city, Persepolis was deserted and it was relatively lost to history until the excavations of Herzfeld, Schmidt, and the Chicago team uncovered it in the 1930s. This great historical artifact is unfortunately at serious risk of "irreparable damage"&lt;ref name=book/&gt; from neglect, the elements, and vandalism.

Persepolis was by no means the only large scale Achaemenid project, as [[Susa]] also hosted [[Palace of Darius in Susa|a similar structure]] initiated by Darius for similar ceremonial purposes. However, that history is able to enjoy the remains of Persepolis as opposed to meager remnants of Susa, owes partly to selection of stone in construction of Persepolis over mud-brick in Susa, and the fact that it had been relatively uninhabited, protecting it from wear and tear of inhabitants. Politically, Persepolis also was a significant find because nearby discovery of [[Naqsh-e Rustam]], the Persian necropolis home to Darius the Great shed light on the significance it has had as one of the major capitals of the empire.&lt;ref name=ronald/&gt; Naqsh-e Rustam would not only house Darius the Great, but also his son [[Xerxes the Great]], [[Artaxerxes I]], and [[Darius II]] as well. The necropolis complex was looted following invasion of Alexander, and possibly in the Sassanid period and during the Arab invasion.

During the time of [[Shah of Iran]], the structure enjoyed protection and coverage as Mohammad Reza Shah appeased to its royal and national symbolism. During this time period many western politicians, poets, artists, and writers were gravitated to Iran, and Persepolis, either as a function of the political relations with the Iranian monarchy or to report on, or visit the ruins. Such figures include the procession of international dignitaries attending the [[2,500 year celebration of the Persian Empire]] held by Shah, as well as individual visits by such figures as [[Heinrich Lübke]] of Germany, and [[Ralph Graves (writer)|Ralph Graves]] of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine. In an article in ``Life`` in 1971, Graves describes his experience at Persepolis in the following way:

{{quote|When you see Persepolis for the first time as I did, facing Marvdasht, you are likely to be disappointed but once inside the ruins themselves you are overwhelmed by the still-proud soaring columns, and by the quality and the fresh state of the bas-relief carvings which are certainly among the finest in the history of the world’s art. But mostly you are transfixed by the sudden realization that all this happened 24 centuries ago, and that people from every nation in the known world of the time had stood in the same place and felt the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A stunning setting for a 2500th anniversary|author =Ralph Graves|publisher=Life magazine|date=October 15, 1971|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AUAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Four-winged guardian===

[[File:Pasargades winged man.jpg|left|thumb|The four winged guardian figure of [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]], with four wings, a two horned crown, and a royal Elamite clothing]]
Perhaps one of the most memorable remaining architectural and artistic works is the bas-relief of Cyrus the Great in Pasargadae. This is a bas-relief cut upon a stone slab depicting a figure or a guardian man, most likely a resemblance of Cyrus himself, possessing four wings shown in an [[Assyria]]n style, dressed in [[Elam]]ite traditional clothing, assuming a pose and figure of an [[ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] god, and wearing a crown that has two horns, in what resembles an ''[[Ovis longipes palaeoaegyptiacus]].'' The structure originally had an upper stone slab that in three different languages, ([[Old Persian]], [[Elamite]], [[Babylonian language|Babylonian]]) declared, "I, (am) Cyrus the king, an Achaemenid."&lt;ref name=ilya&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cambridge history of Iran: The Median and Achaemenian periods, Volume 2|author = Ilya Gershevitch|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1985|pages=392–398|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kMLKgzj5afMC&amp;pg=PA392|isbn = 9780521200912}}&lt;/ref&gt; This carved in limestone writing was in place when [[Robert Ker Porter|Sir Robert Ker Poter]] described the piece in 1818 but, at some point has been lost.

[[David Stronach]] has suggested that there were originally four such figures, set against doorways to the Palace of Cyrus in Pasargadae.&lt;ref name=ilya/&gt; That this bas-relief has such an eclectic styling with elements of [[ancient egypt|Egyptian]], [[Elam]]ite, and [[Assyria]]n, reflects "..'the oecumenical attitude of the Achaemenian kings, who from the time of Cyrus, onward adopted a liberal policy of tolerance and conciliation toward the various religions embraced within their empire'..."&lt;ref name=ilya/&gt; It would therefore depict the eclectic nature of Achaemenid life from policies of the kings to their choice of architecture.

[[Herodotus]], recounts that Cyrus saw in his sleep the oldest son of Hystaspes, [Darius the Great] with wings upon his shoulders, shadowing with the one wing Asia, and with the other wing Europe.&lt;ref name=ilya/&gt; Noted [[Iranologist]], [[Ilya Gershevitch]] explains this statement by Herodotus and its connection with the four winged figure in the following way:&lt;ref name=ilya/&gt;

{{quote|Herodotus, therefore as I surmise, may have known of the close connection, between this type of winged figure, and the image of the Iranian majesty, which he associated with a dream prognosticating, the king's death, before his last, fatal campaign across the Oxus.}}

This relief sculpture, in a sense depicts the eclectic inclusion of various art forms by the Achaemenids, yet their ability to create a new synthetic form that is uniquely Persian in style, and heavily dependent on the contributions of their subject states. After all, that is what distinguishes Achaemenid architecture from those of other kingdoms. It is its originality in context of fusion and inclusion of existing styles, in such a way as to create awe-inspiring structures.

==Persepolis==
[[File:2009-11-24 Persepolis 02.jpg|thumb|center|800 px|&lt;center&gt;Panorama of [[Persepolis]]&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[File:Perspolis.jpg|thumb|right|A well-preserved [[Persian column]] showing the details of the capital of the columns in [[Persepolis]]]]

[[Persepolis]] is the Latinized version of the Old Persian name, "Parsa" literally meaning the "city of Persians." Another spectacular achievement of the Achaemenids, Persepolis became one of the four capitals of the empire. Initiated by [[Darius the Great]] around 518 B.C.E., it would grow to become a center for ceremonial and cultural festivities, a center for dignitaries and visitors to pay homage to the king, a private residence for the Persian kings, a place for [[satraps]] to bring gifts for the king in the Spring during the festival of [[Nowruz]], as well as a place of governance and ordinance.&lt;ref name=Aedeen/&gt; Persepolis's prestige and grand riches were well known in the ancient world, and it was best described by the Greek historian [[Diodorus Siculus]] as "the richest city under the sun".&lt;ref name=ronald/&gt;

===Structural details===
Today the archaeological remnants of this once opulent city are about 70 kilometers northeast of the modern Iranian city of [[Shiraz]], in the [[Fārs Province|Pars]] province, in southwestern [[Iran]]. Persepolis is a wide, elevated complex 40 feet high, 100 feet wide, and a third of a mile long,&lt;ref name=book/&gt; composed of multiple halls, corridors, a wide terrace, and a special, double, symmetrical stairway that would provide access to the top of the terrace.&lt;ref name=Aedeen/&gt; The stairway would delineate [[relief]] scenes of various motifs of daily life or nature, including some that were literal as well as metaphorical; Some scenes would show natural acts such as a lion attacking its prey but bear symbolism of spring and the [[Nowruz]] festival. Other scenes would depict, subjects from all states of the empire presenting gifts to the king, as well as scenes depicting royal guards, or scenes of social interactions between the guards or the dignitaries.&lt;ref name=Aedeen/&gt; This stairway is sometimes referred to as "All countries."&lt;ref name=gov/&gt;

The structure was constructed from various halls and complexes that included, hall of [[Apadana]] (the largest hall with 36 columns), "Tachar" (the private chamber of Darius the Great), "Hadish" (added later on as a private chamber for king [[Xerxes the Great]]), the "Talar-i-Takht" also known as the 100-columned hall serving as the throne hall for general meeting with the king, "Darvazeh-i-Mellal" (the gate of all nations), the "khazaneh" (the royal treasury), a hall/palace complex later on developed by [[Artaxerxes III]], Tripylon (council hall), and the "rock cut tombs of the kings" or [[Naqsh-e Rustam]].&lt;ref name=Aedeen/&gt;

The most impressive hall in the complex is the [[Apadana]] hall, occupying an area of about 109 square meters with 36 [[Persian column]]s, each more than 19 m tall. Each column is [[Fluting (architecture)|fluted]], with a square base (except a few in the [[porticos]]), and an elaborate [[capital (column)|capital]] with two animals supporting the roof. The structure was originally closed off from the elements by mud-brick walls over 5 meters thick and over 20 meters.&lt;ref name=stronach&gt;{{cite web|title=APADANA|author1=R. Schmitt |author2=D. Stronach |publisher=Encyclopedia Iranica|date=December 15, 1986|accessdate=Jan 23, 2011|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/apadana}}&lt;/ref&gt; The columns have a composite capital depicting addorsed bulls or creatures. Those columns in the porticoes not only would possess a circular base, but would also have an ornate capital after the end of the fluting, only to be curtailed by detailed addorsed bulls, supporting the roof.&lt;ref name=stronach/&gt;

Apadana's relief is also unique in that it delineates the presence and power of the king. Known as "Treasure reliefs" the depicted scenes on Apadana stress the continuity of the kingdom through Darius the Great, and stress his presence throughout the empire, as well as depict his army of Persian [[Immortals (Persian Empire)|immortals]]. Perhaps this was Darius's attempt to create a symbol of the assured continuity of his line. Apadana hall and the adjacent structures in the complex are believed to have been designed to host large number of people. In fact, halls of Persepolis could at any one time host some ten thousand visitors easily with the king and the royal staff seated appropriately.&lt;ref name=stronach/&gt;

The grandeur of Persepolis is in its architectural details, its impressive, tall, and upright columns, in its skilfully crafted reliefs depicting people from all walks of life, and from all corners of the empire, and most importantly in its historical importance as both a political and a social center of Achaemenid royal life.

===Engineering===
[[Persepolis Administrative Archives|Persepolis Fortifications]] (PF) Tablets, dating to between 509 and 494 B.C.E. are ancient Persian documents that describe many aspects of construction and maintenance of the Persepolis.&lt;ref name=george/&gt; The tablets are important because they highlight two important aspects of the Achaemenid life and the construction of Persepolis: Firstly, that the structure was created by workers, who were paid rations or wages, and secondly the structure had an intricate system of engineering involving weight bearing and architectural elements, and most notably an irrigation system composed of a system of closed pipes and open aqueducts. The following text from ''PF 1224'', delineates both points:

{{quote|32 BAN (9.7 litres) of grain...the high priest at Persepolis... received and gave (it as) bonus to post-partum Greek women at Persepolis, irrigation (workers), whose apportionment are set...."&lt;ref name=george&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford handbook of Hellenic studies|author1=George Boys-Stones |author2=Barbara Graziosi |author3=Phiroze Vasunia |publisher=Oxford University Press US|year=2009|pages=42–47|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cIDDR1WD9iEC&amp;pg=PA42|isbn=9780199286140 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Water technologies====
The runoff and sewer network of Persepolis are among the most complex in the ancient world. Persepolis is constructed on the foot of a mountain (Rahmat Mountain), with an elevated terrace that is partially man made and partially part of the mountain complex. As Persepolis was in essence an important cultural center often used by the beginning of the spring during the festival of [[Nowruz]] it enjoyed great precipitation and water runoffs from the molten ice and snow. The sewer network assumed great importance at this critical time as it was meant to both handle the water flow downward from higher areas as well as manage the inhabitant’s sewage runoffs, and their water needs.&lt;ref name=Mays&gt;{{cite book|title=Ancient Water Technologies|author1=L. Mays |author2=M. Moradi-Jalal et. al |publisher=Springer|year=2010|pages=95–100|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AEzOzSZEAToC&amp;pg=PA94|isbn=9789048186327 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to prevent flooding, the Achaemenids used two engineering techniques to divert molten snow and mountain runoff: The first strategy was to collect the runoff in a reservoir that was a well with a square opening with dimensions of 4.2 m for the square opening, and a depth of 60 m, allowing a volume of 554 cubic meters, or 554,000 liters, (60 x 4.2 x 4.2) of runoff to be collected. The water would be diverted toward the reservoir via multiple masonry gutters strategically located around the structure. The second strategy was to divert water away from the structure, should the reservoirs be filled to capacity; this system used a 180 m long conduit, with 7 m width, and 2.6 m depth located just west of the site.&lt;ref name=Mays/&gt;

The water system however was far more complex than just the reservoirs and the water conduits and involved a very sophisticated ancient system of closed pipes and irrigation. The irrigation was divided into five zones, two serving north part of the structure and three the southern part. Amazingly the irrigation system was designed to be harmonious with the structure so that at places there were central drainage canals in the center of the columns and small draining holes and conduits on each floor that would take the water out of roof, each floor, and the sewage portals into an underground sewage network and away from the structure.&lt;ref name=Mays/&gt;

The five zones (I–V) all possessed a runoff capacity of 260 L/s (liter/second) which is certainly more than the amount needed for handling mountain runoff indicating that the system was also used for water supply to the inhabitants, sewage management, and even irrigation of the gardens around the structure.&lt;ref name=Mays/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Structural technologies====
In order for such a massive structure to have functioned properly it meant that the weight of the roof, columns and indeed the terrace had to be distributed evenly. Construction at the base of the mountain offered some structural support. The ceiling material was a composite application of wood and stone decreasing its overall weight. Extensive use of stone in Persepolis, not only guaranteed its structural integrity for the duration of its use but also meant that its remains lasted longer than the mud-bricks of [[Palace of Darius in Susa|Susa palaces]].

===History===
Scholars agree that it was Darius the Great who initiated the construction and expansion of the Persepolis project, however German archaeologist [[Ernst Herzfeld|Ernst E. Herzfeld]], believed that it was Cyrus the Great who chose the site for the construction, although it ultimately came down to Darius the Great to finish the construction and create its impressive buildings. Excavations on behalf of the Oriental Institute of [[Chicago University]], headed by Herzfeld in 1931 and later cooperation by Eric F. Schmidt in 1933 led to some of the most impressive uncovering of Achaemenid artifacts, palaces, and structures. Herzfeld felt that the site of Persepolis was made for special ceremonies and was meant to convey the power of the Achaemenid empire to its subject nations.&lt;ref name=Aedeen/&gt;

On some accounts, Persepolis was never officially finished as its existence was cut short by Alexander the Great, who in a fit of anger, ordered the burning of the city in 330 B.C.E. Started originally by Darius the Great a century earlier, the structure was constantly changing, receiving upgrades from subsequent Persian monarchs, and undergoing renovation to maintain its impressive façade. After the burning of the city, Persepolis was deserted and it was relatively lost to history until the excavations of Herzfeld, Schmidt, and the Chicago team uncovered it in the 1930s. This great historical artifact is unfortunately at serious risk of "irreparable damage"&lt;ref name=book/&gt; from neglect, the elements, and vandalism.

Persepolis was by no means the only large scale Achaemenid project, as [[Susa]] also hosted a similar structure initiated by Darius for similar ceremonial purposes. However, that history is able to enjoy the remains of Persepolis as opposed to meager remnants of Susa, owes partly to selection of stone in construction of Persepolis over mud-brick in Susa, and the fact that it had been relatively uninhabited, protecting it from wear and tear of inhabitants. Politically, Persepolis also was a significant find because nearby discovery of [[Naqsh-e Rustam]], the Persian necropolis home to Darius the Great shed light on the significance it has had as one of the major capitals of the empire.&lt;ref name=ronald/&gt; Naqsh-e Rustam would not only house Darius the Great, but also his son [[Xerxes the Great]], [[Artaxerxes I]], and [[Darius II]] as well. The necropolis complex was looted following invasion of Alexander, and possibly in the Sassanid period and during the Arab invasion.

During the time of [[Shah of Iran]], the structure enjoyed protection and coverage as Mohammad Reza Shah appeased to its royal and national symbolism. During this time period many western politicians, poets, artists, and writers were gravitated to Iran, and Persepolis, either as a function of the political relations with the Iranian monarchy or to report on, or visit the ruins. Such figures include the procession of international dignitaries attending the [[2,500 year celebration of the Persian Empire]] held by Shah, as well as individual visits by such figures as [[Heinrich Lübke]] of Germany, and [[Ralph Graves (writer)|Ralph Graves]] of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine. In an article in ``Life`` in 1971, Graves describes his experience at Persepolis in the following way:

{{quote|When you see Persepolis for the first time as I did, facing Marvdasht, you are likely to be disappointed but once inside the ruins themselves you are overwhelmed by the still-proud soaring columns, and by the quality and the fresh state of the bas-relief carvings which are certainly among the finest in the history of the world’s art. But mostly you are transfixed by the sudden realization that all this happened 24 centuries ago, and that people from every nation in the known world of the time had stood in the same place and felt the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A stunning setting for a 2500th anniversary|author =Ralph Graves|publisher=Life magazine|date=October 15, 1971|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AUAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Vandalism===
Throughout history there have been instances of neglect or vandalism in Persepolis. The most notable historical figure to vandalize this structure was [[Alexander the Great]], who after entering Persepolis in 330 B.C.E. called it the "most hateful city in Asia" and allowed his Macedonian troops to pillage it.&lt;ref name=Laura&gt;{{cite book|title=Alexander the conqueror: the epic story of the warrior king, Volume 2003|author =Laura Foreman|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=2004|pages=152|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rVEa4nzLkT4C&amp;pg=PA152|isbn =9780306812934}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this stern hatred, Alexander also admired the Persians as is obvious through his respect for [[Cyrus the Great]], and his act of giving a dignified burial to [[Darius III]]. Years later upon revisiting the city he had burnt, Alexander would regret his action. [[Plutarch]] depicts the paradoxical nature of Alexander when he recounts an anecdote in which Alexander pauses and talks to a fallen statue of [[Xerxes the Great]] as if it were a live person:

{{quote|Shall I pass by and leave you lying there because of the expeditions you led against Greece, or shall I set you up again because of your magnanimity and your virtues in other respects?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Alexander the Great: The Invisible Enemy: A Biography |first=John Maxwell |last=O'Brien |publisher=Psychology Press |date=1994 |page=104 |isbn=978-0-415-10617-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In retrospect, it must be understood that despite his momentary lapse of judgment and his role as having been the single most significant figure to bring an end to Persepolis, Alexander is not by any means the only. Many individuals in the following centuries would damage Persepolis including thieves and vandals during the [[Sassanid dynasty|Sassanid era]]. When the Arab armies invaded in the seventh century, they took to causing civil disturbances, religious persecution of Persians, and burning of the books. That no clear record of their vandalism remains to date, is most likely due to their destruction of books and historical records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Zoroastrian faith: tradition and modern research|author =Solomon Alexander Nigosian|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|year=1993|pages=47–48|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Uspf6eDDvjAC&amp;pg=PA47|isbn =9780773511446}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the colonial era, and in WWII, the structure would also suffer vandalism at the hands of the Allies. Natural causes such as earthquakes and winds have also contributed to the overall demise of the structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Persian Earthquakes|author1=N. N. Ambraseys |author2=C. P. Melville |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|pages=198|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1JkfKub5vakC&amp;pg=PA198|isbn=9780521021876}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first French excavation in Susa carried out by the Dieulafoys and the looting and the destruction of Persian antiquities by the so-called archeologists had a deep impact on the site. Jane Dieulafoy writes in her diary:

{{quote| Yesterday I was gazing at the huge stone cow found recently; it weighs around 12,000 kilos! It is impossible to move such an enormous mass. I couldn't control my anger. I took a hammer and started striking the stone beast. I gave it some ferocious blows. The head of the pillar burst open like ripe fruit.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}}}

Even to date the structure is not safe from destruction and vandalism. After the Iranian revolution, a group of fundamentalists serving [[Khomeini]], including his right-hand man [[Sadegh Khalkhali]], tried to bulldoze both the renown Persian poet, [[Tomb of Ferdowsi|Ferdowsi's tomb]], and Persepolis, but they were stopped by the provisional government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Epic of Iran|author =Reza Aslan|publisher=New York Times|date=April 30, 2006|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/30/books/review/30aslan.html?pagewanted=print|accessdate=Jan 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gallery below highlights only some of these unfortunate acts of vandalism mostly by foreign visitors from the late 1800s to mid-1900s. Currently the structure is at high risk of "irreparable damage."&lt;ref name=book/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Virtual reconstruction===
French archaeologist, Egyptologist, and historian [[Charles Chipiez]] (1835–1901) has created some of the most advanced virtual drawings of what [[Persepolis]] would have looked like as a metropolis of the Persian Empire. The following mini-gallery depicts his virtual recreations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History of art in Persia|author1=Georges Perrot |author2=Charles Chipiez |publisher=Chapman and Hall, limited|year=1892|pages=336–43 &amp; others|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SU9TAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA314-IA1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first image on the left is a view of the "Talar-i-Takht" or the 100 columns hall of Persepolis. Note on the far left portion of the image, the famous "[[lamassu]]" (or chimeric man, lion, eagle beast) greeting the visitors (look below for a picture of a lamassu). Chipiez's drawings delineate his technical prowess and attention to details.

The second picture from the left, is Chipiez's drawing of the columns, their [[Capital (architecture)|capital]] ornation, and roof structure of the palace of Darius in Persepolis, also known as "Tachar." Note the adorsed bull details, as well as the use of wood in construction of the roof. This explains why the palace caught fire when Alexander the Great, set it aflame.

The third picture from the left, is a more detailed, technical drawing of the "Talar-i-Takht" or the 100 column hall. Note the layering of the roof, the detailing on the edges of the roof, the window structures, and the technical detailing of the construction poles.

The last picture, on the right, is a panoramic view of the outside of the palace of Darius the Great in Persepolis. Details of the Persepolis reliefs are depicted as one can note the symbolic scenes of lions attacking bulls, accompanied by two groups of Persian soldiers protecting (symbolically in this case) the infrastructure above.

[[Susa]] was an ancient city (5500 B.C.E) even by the time of the Achaemenids. Susa became a part of the Achaemenid Empire in 539 B.C.E., and was expanded upon by Darius the Great with construction of Palace of Darius, and later development of palace of [[Artaxerxes II]]. The palace had a unique Apadana, resembling the one in Persepolis, except this hall was much larger than its Persepolis counterpart covering some 9,200 square meters.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; Cyrus the Great chose Susa as a site for one of his fortifications creating a wall there that was significantly taller than older walls made by the Elamites. This choice might have been to facilitate the trade from [[Persian Gulf]] northward.&lt;ref name=Aedeen/&gt; What remains in way of structure from this once active capital, are five archaeological mounds, today located in modern Shush, in southwestern Iran, scattered over 250 hectares.&lt;ref name=man&gt;{{cite book|title=Eerdmans dictionary of the Bible|author1=David Noel Freedman |author2=Allen C. Myers |author3=Astrid B. Beck |publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|year=2000|pages=1258|url=https://books.google.com/?id=P9sYIRXZZ2MC&amp;pg=PA1258|isbn=9780802824004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structural details===
Darius's design of his palace in Susa would resemble Persepolis structurally and aesthetically but would incorporate more of a local flair. The structure hosted a large hall of throne or ''Apadana'' similar to the [[Apadana]] of the Persepolis. This Susa version of Apadana would be composed of three [[porticoes]] at right angles to each other, one of which was closed in all three sides by the walls, and only open in its southward direction. The palace was decorated with reliefs in enameled terra-cotta of lions walking.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

Intricate scenes depicting archers of king Darius would decorate the walls, as well as motifs of nature such as double-bulls, unicorns, [[fasciae]] curling into volutes, and palms disposed as a flower or a bell. The archers in particular depict a unique symbiosis of Persian, Ionian and Greek artistry of the time probably reflecting the origin of the artists who were originally hired by Darius the Great, and their personal reflections on the finished work.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; Perhaps the most striking terra-cotta relief is that of the [[griffin]], depicting a winged creature resembling a lion with wings of an eagle (picture not shown here). The terra-cotta brick reliefs were decorated with lively dye colorations often giving them a lifelike quality.

===History===
Architecturally, the palace of Darius in Susa, was the epitome of the Persian architecture at the height of the empire's growth. Originally erected by Darius, and extensively renovated and modified by [[Artaxerxes II]], it was meant to reflect the same opulence and prestige as Persepolis. This was Darius the Great's attempt to decorate his summer capital of Susa and to show case its glory. French archaeologist [[Marcel-Auguste Dieulafoy]] discovered the remnants of the palace of Darius, among the ruins of Susa producing the artifacts of this once magnificent structure now at display in the [[Louvre]] museum, France. He also wrote a series of architectural observations known as "''L'Art antique de la Perse''" which made a significant impression on the art community as to the intricacy of the Achaemenid architecture.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Art|author = Giulio Carotti|publisher=Duckworth &amp; Co|year=1908|pages=94–7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7-JLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Dieulafoy and his wife Jane, made significant contributions in way of excavation, Susa remains were noted by many observers years before and were in fact officially noted by [[William Loftus|William K. Loftus]] in 1852.&lt;ref name=man/&gt;

Susa was a wealthy city by the time Alexander the Great invaded it, and it is said that he required 10,000 camels and 20,000 donkeys to carry away the treasures.&lt;ref name=Aedeen/&gt; For the most part the architectural wealth of Susa lies in its palaces, and ceremonial structures most of which have been eroded away by time or wear and tear. Today the most important remnants of the Achaemenid contribution to the architecture of ancient Susa are found in remnants of the Palace of Darius the Great in the original excavation site, or hosted in foreign nations' museums as Persian artifacts. Today the archaeological remains of the structure remain exposed to the elements, wear and tear, and human activity, and it seems that remains of Susa would be forever lost to the humankind, except perhaps for few selected pieces on display at the Louvre or foreign nations' museums.

Below are a few selected photos from the palace of Darius. The photo on the far left depicts the famous Archers' relief from the palace of Darius, from Susa. The second picture from the right, is a two-dimensional "[[lamassu]]" a mythical creature with wings of an eagle, head of a man, and body of a lion. The picture in the middle, is of the base of a column from the palace of Darius in Susa, inscribing in its rim, in three languages (Babylonian, Elamite, and Old Persian), that Darius, is the "great king of kings."

==Naqsh-e Rustam==
[[File:Naghsh-e rostam, Irán, 2016-09-24, DD 20-24 PAN.jpg|thumb|900 px|center|&lt;center&gt;A panorama of the [[Naqsh-e Rustam]] mountain complex&lt;/center&gt;]]
[[Naqsh-e Rustam]] is an archaeological site located about 6 kilometers to the northwest of [[Persepolis]] in Marvdasht region in the Fars province of Iran.&lt;ref name=garthwaite&gt;{{cite book|title=The Persians|author =Gene Ralph Garthwaite|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2005|pages=51–55|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FqzrZ3b8aakC&amp;pg=PA51|isbn=9781405144001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nash-e Rustam acts as a [[necropolis]] for the Achaemenid kings, but is a significant historical entity in that it also housed ancient [[Elamite]] relief, as well as later relief by the [[Sassanid empire|Sassanid]] kings. Naqsh-e Rustam is not the actual name of this massive structure, but is the [[New Persian]] compound word composed of "Naqsh" meaning "face", or "facade", and "[[Rostam|Rustam]]" referring to the hero of the Persian epic [[Shahnameh]]. The [[Elamite]]s, [[Achaemenid]]s, and the [[Sassanid]]s lived centuries before the drafting of the Shahnameh by the Persian poet [[Ferdowsi]], and therefore the name is a misnomer, the result of the great amnesia of Persians about their ancient past, that settled over them after being conquered by the Arabs.&lt;ref name=paul&gt;{{cite book|title=In Search of Zarathustra: Across Iran and Central Asia to Find the World's First Prophet|author =Paul Kriwaczek|publisher=Random House, Inc|year=2004|pages=88–90|url=https://books.google.com/?id=YQ_yENnMpKQC&amp;pg=PA88|isbn=9780307426352}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name therefore is a retrospective creation, due to lack of historical documents and lack of any inclusive knowledge of its origin. In ancient Persia, this structure would overlook the now long gone city of [[Istakhr]] easily accessible from Persepolis. Istakhr had a religious role as it was the place where Achaemenids held their reverence of the water goddess [[Anahita]]. The structure is carved into a native limestone rock mountain, and houses the burial chambers of [[Darius the Great]], [[Xerxes I]], [[Artaxerxes I]], and [[Darius II]], all Achaemenid monarchs of Persia. There is also an incomplete tomb, as only its lower cruciform arm is carved out of the rock, while the rest is unfinished. It is speculated to belong to king [[Darius III]].&lt;ref name=garthwaite/&gt;&lt;ref name=paul/&gt;

The kings were interred behind a facade and [[rock relief]], that would resemble an accurate depiction of the king's own palace and its structural details. The accuracy of the facade and its association with the actual structure of the kings' palaces is so close that they almost produce a view of how the structures would have looked before time reduced them to remains; Tomb of Darius the Great, for instance mirrors his palace in [[Persepolis]], the "Tachar" even in scale and dimensions.&lt;ref name=paul/&gt;

The tombs are carved into the mountain's side, in form of a cross ([[Old Persian]]: ''chalipa''), depressed into the mountain's [[limestone]] background, and elevated from the ground. The relief which is found in the depressed cruciform is that which depicts the respective king's palace, and also depicts on its roof, the relief figure of the king praying, to [[Ahuramazda]] or what most believe is a reference to the [[Zoroastrian]] icon, [[Faravahar]].&lt;ref name=paul/&gt;

One of the enigmatic features of the complex is a cubical, stone structure standing 12.5 meters tall, and around 7 meters wide, called the "[[Ka'ba-ye Zartosht]]" translating to the "Cube of [[Zoroaster]]" believed to have been constructed during the Acahemenid era and modified and changed during the Sassanid era. The structure is cubical in base, with blind impressions on the side resembling windows, and a ruined staircase leading to a small door in the front leading to a completely empty interior.&lt;ref name=garthwaite/&gt;&lt;ref name=paul/&gt; There are varied speculations as to its function discussed below.

The structure also once housed an ancient Elamite relief which has been almost entirely replaced by the Sassanid reliefs. Today but a figure of a man remains of the Elamite contribution to this mountain. The later Sassanids, also created their own historical signature on the structure, called the [[Naqsh-e Rajab]]. Though numerous and very detailed, the study of the [[Sassanid architecture|Sassanid architectural]] achievements sheds light on some of the architectural achievements during the second Persian empire's reign.

===Ka'ba-ye Zartosht===
[[File:Tour nagsh-e-rostam iran.jpg|thumb|left|A close up view of the [[Ka'ba-ye Zartosht]] ("Cube of Zoroaster") showing the stairs, the narrow opening, and the blind windows. Note its placement in a depression, as well as the unique rectangular markings on the façade]]

This enigmatic structure stands erect around 12.5 meters tall (~ 35 feet), with a linear, cubical shape and a square base (~ 22 feet in sides),&lt;ref name=james/&gt; constructed in what is essentially a dug out rectangular depression, having on all but one of its sides, four rectangular depressions resembling blind windows, and multiple minute rectangular depressions in the façade interdispersed among the blind windows as well as the side housing the staircase. The staircase leads to a small door (5 feet by 6 feet in dimensions) opening to an interior apartment of about 12 feet square.&lt;ref name=james/&gt; The structure's roof houses a minimal [[entablature]] of a repeating square pattern.&lt;ref name=james/&gt; The entire structure is posited on a raised stone platform that is composed of a few stone slabs, in a sequentially smaller yet in a concentric, pyramidally shaped succession. This structure is enigmatic, both in its aesthetic choice seen in its rather odd design, and façade, as well as its location, and supposed function.

From one perspective, its proximity to the kings' tombs, and its simple design, is by some scholars thought to indicate that the cube was a Zoroastrian temple, and the Naqsh-e Rustam was more than a mere place for grieving of the deceased kings, but a grand festive center where crowds would gather on festive days to observe the king pray to [[Ahuramazda]], and bask in the structure's magnitude while praying to Ahuramazda.&lt;ref name=paul/&gt; This would certainly be logical as the city was also adjacent to [[Istakhr]], a major religious and cultural center. The concept of the temple being used as a fire sanctuary, is however not likely because there is no general ventilation for smoke and gasses, and also that it differs so drastically, architecturally and aesthetically from other well known contemporary temple sites in [[Fars province|Pars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pasargadae: the oldest imperial capital|author =Ali Sami|publisher=Musavi Printing Office|year=1956|pages=90–94|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EjUbAAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Curiously the design although unique, is not the only one of its kind. Located not far away from the Cube of Zoroaster, there exists in [[Pasargadae]], even to date, remnants of a structure that is very similar in its square shape and design to the "''Cube of Zoroaster''", called "''Zendan-i-Suleiman''."&lt;ref name=james/&gt; The name "Zendan-i-Suleiman,"  is a compound word composed of the words, "Zendan" which is Persian for "jail", and "Suleiman" which is a local Persian dialect name of the King [[Solomon]], translating to ''"Jail of Solomon."'' Structurally both "Jail of Solomon" and "Cube of Zoroaster" have the same cubic shape, and even resemble each other in the most minute of details, including facade, and dimensions. The name "Jail of Solomon" is of course a misnomer since Solomon never did erect this structure. The term must have come as a result of a Persian tactic advised by local Persians, to protect both [[Cyrus the Great]]'s [[Tomb of Cyrus|tomb]], and the surrounding structures including this temple, from invading Arabs' destruction, by calling the mausoleum, the "tomb of Solomon's mother" and the temple in Pasargadae, the "Jail of Solomon."&lt;ref name=elliot/&gt;

Just like the "Cube of Zoroaster", the function of the "Solomon's Jail" is not well understood. There are theories about the structures being used as a depository of objects of dynastic or religious importance as well as theories of it being a temple of fire.&lt;ref name=james/&gt; It should also be noted, that the structures as they exist today are not simply the work of the Achaemenid architects and have been modified, and improved by the Sassanids, who also used them for their festive, and political needs.

==Behistun inscription==
[[File:Darius I the Great's inscription.jpg|left|thumb|[[Behistun inscription]]]]

Carved high in [[Mount Behistun]] of [[Kermanshah]], one can find the Behistun inscription, a text etched into the stone of the mountain describing the manner in which Darius became the king of Persia, after the previous ruler ([[Cambyses II]]), and how he overthrew the [[magus]] usurper of the throne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The journal of sacred literature and Biblical record, Volume 3|author1=John Kitto |author2=Henry Burgess |author3=Benjamin Harris Cowper |publisher=A. Heylin|year=1856|pages=183–5|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qHUtAAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this inscription Darius also details his [[satraps]] and delineates his position as the king and emperor of the Persian empire.

Architecturally speaking, the Behistun inscription is a massive project, that entailed cutting into the rough edge of the mountain in order to create [[bas-relief]] figures as seen in the pictures above. The Behistun mountain, rises up to some 1700 feet as part of the [[Zagros]] mountain chains in [[Iran]]. The mountain's location is ideal being close to both [[Ecbatana]] and [[Babylonia]].&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; The bas-relief itself is located some 300 feet above the base of the mountain. The figures represent two of the king's soldiers, the king himself standing over a fallen usurper and captives of several nations possibly dissidents, or co-conspirators. The inscription itself is written in [[cuneiform]] character in [[Old Persian]], [[Babylonian language|Babylonian]], and [[Medes|Median]].&lt;ref name=smith&gt;{{cite book|title=A history of the world from the earliest records to the present time: ancient history, Volume 1|author =Philip Smith|publisher=[[D. Appleton &amp; Company|D. Appleton]] |year=1865|page=298|url=https://books.google.com/?id=elAPAAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inscription is interpreted and deciphered with the help of many intellectuals and scholars, but the [[Oriental studies|Orientalist]] [[Sir Henry Rawlinson]] is credited as being most critical in the process of deciphering the piece.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; Part of why the understanding of the text is so vivid today is owed to Darius the Great himself, for he wrote the message of the inscription in three language, and so allowed the modern scholars to decipher one language and follow through the other two, since the message was essentially similar in all three forms. In this sense, the Behistun inscription is not only a significant architectural work, but also a significant linguistic tool, as important to the old world understanding of [[ancient Persia]] and its languages, as [[Rosetta Stone]] is to understanding [[ancient Egypt]] and its languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Darius the Great|author =J. Poolos|publisher=Infobase Publishing|year=2008|pages=38–9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=K0EZK08VGXEC&amp;pg=PA38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy and influences==
Elements of the Achaemenid style can be seen in contemporary [[Iranian architecture]]. Buildings built by the [[Pahlavi dynasty]], in particular, show extensive influence of Achaemenid architecture and art.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
(10 December 1870&amp;nbsp;– 23 August 1933) was an Austrian and Czech architect and influential European theorist of [[modern architecture]]. His essay ''[[Ornament and Crime]]'' advocated smooth and clear surfaces in contrast to the lavish decorations of the [[fin de siècle]] and also to the more modern aesthetic principles of the [[Vienna Secession]], exemplified in his design of [[Looshaus]], [[Vienna]]. Loos became a pioneer of modern architecture and contributed a body of theory and criticism of [[Modernism]] in architecture and design and developed the "Raumplan" (literally ''spatial plan'') method of arranging interior spaces, exemplified in [[Villa Müller]] in [[Prague]].

Loos had three tumultuous marriages that all ended in divorce. He suffered from poor health, including an inherited hearing affliction, and was involved in a pedophilia scandal. He died aged 62 on 23 August 1933 in [[Kalksburg]] near [[Vienna]].

==Early life==
Loos was born on 10 December 1870 in [[Brno]], in the [[Margraviate of Moravia]] region of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], today the eastern part of the [[Czech Republic]]. His father, a German [[stonemason]], died when Loos was nine years old.&lt;ref name="Life and influence"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.architecture.com/LibraryDrawingsAndPhotographs/Exhibitionsandloans/AdolfLoos/Lifeandinfluence/LifeAndInfluence.aspx|title=Adolf Loos: Life and influence|accessdate=20 June 2012|last=|first=|date=|work=|publisher=Royal Institute of British Architects|pages=|quote=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512170143/http://www.architecture.com/LibraryDrawingsAndPhotographs/Exhibitionsandloans/AdolfLoos/Lifeandinfluence/LifeAndInfluence.aspx|archivedate=12 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young Adolf Loos had inherited his father's hearing impairment and was significantly handicapped by it throughout his life. His mother continued to carry on the stonemason business after her husband's death. Loos attended several [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] schools, a technical school in [[Liberec]] and graduated 1889 from a technical school in Brno. He later studied at [[Dresden University of Technology]]. He left one year later without completing his study.

==Career==
At age 23, Loos traveled to the United States and stayed there for three years from 1893–96. While in the United States, he mainly lived with relatives in the Philadelphia area, supported himself with odd jobs and also visited other cities such as the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago, [[St. Louis]] and New York.  Loos returned to Vienna in 1896 and made it his permanent residence. He was a prominent figure in the city and a friend of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[Arnold Schönberg]], [[Peter Altenberg]] and [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]].

Inspired by his years in the [[New World]] he devoted himself to architecture. After briefly associating himself with the Vienna Secession in 1896, he rejected the style and advocated a new, plain, unadorned architecture. A utilitarian approach to use the entire floor plan completed his concept. Loos's early commissions consisted of interior designs for shops and cafés in Vienna.

===Architectural theory===
Loos authored several polemical works. In ''Spoken into the Void'', published in 1900, he attacked the Vienna Secession, at a time when the movement was at its height.&lt;ref name="Royal Institute of British Architects"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.architecture.com/LibraryDrawingsAndPhotographs/Exhibitionsandloans/AdolfLoos/Lifeandinfluence/Writings.aspx |title=Adolf Loos: Writings |accessdate=20 June 2012 |last= |first= |date= |work= |publisher=Royal Institute of British Architects |pages= |quote=  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121118180625/http://www.architecture.com/LibraryDrawingsAndPhotographs/Exhibitionsandloans/AdolfLoos/Lifeandinfluence/Writings.aspx |archivedate=18 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his essays, Loos used provocative catchphrases and is noted for the essay/manifesto entitled ''[[Ornament and Crime]]'', given in a lecture in 1910 and first published in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Stewart, ''Fashioning Vienna: Adolf Loos's Cultural Criticism'', London: Routledge, 2000, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; He explored the idea that the progress of culture is associated with the deletion of [[Ornament (architecture)|ornament]] from everyday objects, and that it was therefore a crime to force craftsmen or builders to waste their time on ornamentation that served to hasten the time when an object would become obsolete ([[design theory]]). Loos' stripped-down buildings influenced the minimal massing of modern architecture, and stirred controversy. Although noted for the lack of ornamentation on their exteriors, the interiors of many of Loos's buildings are finished with rich and expensive materials, notably stone, marble and wood, displaying natural patterns and textures in flat planes, executed in first rate craftsmanship. The distinction is not between complicated and simple, but between "organic" and superfluous decoration.

Loos was also interested in the decorative arts, collecting sterling silver and high quality leather goods, which he noted for their plain yet luxurious appeal. He also enjoyed fashion and men's clothing, designing the famed Kníže of Vienna, a [[haberdashery]]. His admiration for the fashion and culture of England and America can be seen in his short-lived publication ''Das Andere'', which ran for just two issues in 1903 and included advertisements for 'English' clothing.&lt;ref name="Royal Institute of British Architects"/&gt; In 1920, he had a brief collaboration with [[Frederick John Kiesler]] - architect, theater and art-exhibition designer.

===Loos House and other projects===
From 1904 on, he was able to carry out big projects; the most notable was the so-called "Loos House" (built from 1910–12), originally for the Viennese tailor Goldman and Salatsch, for whom Loos had designed a store interior in 1898, and situated right across from the [[Habsburg]] city residence [[Hofburg Palace]]. The house, today called Michaelerplatz 3, Vienna, and under monument preservation, was criticized by its contemporaries. The facade was dominated by rectilinear window patterns and a lack of stucco decoration and awnings, which earned it the nickname "House without Eyebrows"; Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] was said to have despised the modern building so much that he avoided leaving the Hofburg Palace through a main gate in its vicinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.stadtbekannt.at/haus-ohne-augenbrauen/ |title=Haus ohne Augenbrauen &amp;#124; Stadtbekannt Wien &amp;#124; Das Wiener Online Magazin |publisher=Stadtbekannt.at |date= |accessdate=2015-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work also includes the store of the men's fashion house Knize (built 1909–13), Am Graben 13, [[Café Museum]] (built 1899), Operngasse 7, Vienna, and the "American Bar" (built 1907–08), Kärntnerstrasse 10, Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.architektenlexikon.at/de/362.htm#Werke |title=Architekturzentrum Wien |publisher=Architektenlexikon.at |date= |accessdate=2015-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loos visited the island of [[Skyros]] in 1904 and was influenced by the cubic architecture of the Greek islands. When the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] collapsed after [[World War I]] Loos was awarded [[Czechoslovakia]]n citizenship by [[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk|President Masaryk]].&lt;ref name="Life and influence"/&gt; His main place of residence remained in Vienna. During the [[First Austrian Republic]] Loos became interested in public projects. He designed several housing projects for the City of Vienna ([[Red Vienna]]). From 1924–28 Loos lived in Paris. He taught at the Sorbonne and was contracted to build a house for [[Tristan Tzara]], which was completed 1925 in Avenue Junot 15, Paris. In 1928 he returned to Vienna.

Loos had an admiration for classical architecture,&lt;ref&gt;Hanno-Walter Kruft. ''A History of Architectural Theory: From Vitruvius to the Present''. Princeton Architectural Press, 1994 and [[Edward Chaney]], Inigo Jones's 'Roman Sketchbook, 2006) page 361&lt;/ref&gt;  which is reflected in his writings and his entry to the [[Tribune Tower#Design competition|1922 Chicago Tribune competition]]. Loos' submission was a massive doric column.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Oliver Wainwright |url=http://www.bdonline.co.uk/top-10-unbuilt-towers-chicago-tribune-tower-by-adolf-loos/5023198.article |title=Top 10 unbuilt towers: Chicago Tribune Tower, by Adolf Loos |work=bdonline.co.uk/ |date=17 August 2011 |accessdate=2015-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Private life ==
===Marriages===
Loos was married three times. In July 1902, he married drama student {{Interlanguage link multi|Lina Loos|2=de|3=Lina Loos|preserve=1}}. The marriage ended three years later in 1905. In 1919, he married 20-year-old Austrian-born {{Interlanguage link multi|Elsie Altmann|2=de|3=Elsie Altmann-Loos|preserve=1}}, a dancer and operetta star and daughter of Adolf Altmann and Jeannette Gruenblatt. They divorced seven years later in 1926. In 1929 he married writer and photographer [[Claire Loos|Claire Beck]]. She was the daughter of his clients Otto and Olga Beck, and 35 years his junior. They were divorced on 30 April 1932.&lt;ref name="Loos 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Loos|first=Claire Beck|title=Adolf Loos – A Private Portrait|year=2011|publisher=DoppelHouse Press|location=Los Angeles, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following their divorce, Claire Loos wrote ''Adolf Loos Privat'', a literary work of snapshot-like vignettes about Loos's character, habits and sayings, published by the Johannes-Presse in Vienna in 1936. The book was intended to raise funds for Loos's tomb.

===Poor health===
All his life, Loos suffered from a hearing impairment. When he was a child, he was deaf. He only acquired partial hearing at the age of 12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biography.yourdictionary.com/adolf-loos |title=Adolf Loos Facts |publisher=Biography.yourdictionary.com |date=1933-08-23 |accessdate=2015-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1918 Loos was diagnosed with cancer. His stomach, appendix and part of his intestine were removed. By the time he was 50 he was nearly deaf.

===Child abuse===
In 1928 Loos was disgraced by a pedophilia scandal in Vienna. He had commissioned young girls aged 8 to 10, from poor families to act as models in his studio. The indictment stated that Loos had exposed himself and forced his young models to participate in sexual acts. He was found partially guilty in a court decision of 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.aon.at/andreas.weigel/pdfs/Adolf-Loos-Gerichtsurteil |format=PDF |title=[Rechtskräftiges Gerichtsurteil Adolf Loos] 7 Vr 5707/28/71 |publisher=Members.aon.net |accessdate=2015-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704060147/http://members.aon.at/andreas.weigel/pdfs/Adolf-Loos-Gerichtsurteil |archivedate=4 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 the original case record was rediscovered and confirmed the accusation.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Long, Der Fall Loos.

==Death and legacy==
[[File:Villa-Mueller-Prag-3.jpg|thumb|[[Villa Müller]] in Prague]]
Adolf Loos exhibited early signs of dementia around the time of his court proceedings. A few months before his death he suffered a stroke. He died aged 62 on 23 August 1933 in [[Kalksburg]] near [[Vienna]].&lt;ref name="Bock"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bock | first = Ralf | title = Adolf Loos | publisher = Skira | location = Geneve | year = 2007 | isbn = 88-7624-643-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Loos's body was taken to Vienna's [[Zentralfriedhof]] to rest among the great artists and musicians of the city, including [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]], Altenberg and Kraus, some of his closest friends and associates.&lt;ref name="Loos 2011"/&gt;

Through his writings and his groundbreaking projects in Vienna, Loos was able to influence other architects and designers, and the early development of Modernism. His careful selection of materials, passion for craftsmanship and use of 'Raumplan'-the considered ordering and size of interior spaces based on function—are still admired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.architecture.com/LibraryDrawingsAndPhotographs/Exhibitionsandloans/AdolfLoos/Lifeandinfluence/Raumplan.aspx|title=Adolf Loos: Raumplan|accessdate=20 June 2012|last=|first=|date=|work=|publisher=Royal Institute of British Architects|pages=|quote=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512180402/http://www.architecture.com/LibraryDrawingsAndPhotographs/Exhibitionsandloans/AdolfLoos/Lifeandinfluence/Raumplan.aspx|archive-date=12 May 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bananas Unpeeled''''' is a 26 minute film shot in [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]], investigating the social and environmental issues faced by [[plantation]] workers and small farmers in the Caribbean.
It examines [[fair trade]] policies and labeling as a positive alternative for workers on plantations where harsh working conditions and environmental damage are the norm.

The film was made by independent film-maker [[Nick Shaw]] and introduced by the political activist and comedian [[Mark Thomas]].

This educational resource (the film and corresponding teacher action booklet) was quickly taken up by leading British [[NGO]]'s ([[OXFAM]], [[People &amp; Planet]]). Used extensively by schools, universities, [[trade union]] organisations, etc., it helped with the introduction of the "[[fair trade banana]]" into Great Britain.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} The [[The Co-operative Group|Co-Op UK supermarket chain]] was the first to introduce Fair trade Bananas into their stores. To date, several other supermarket chains have followed this example (e.g. [[Waitrose]], [[Sainsbury's]]).

The story behind the making of the film is mentioned in the 2008 book ''Fighting the Banana Wars and other Fairtrade Battles'' by Harriet Lamb, [[Order of the British Empire|C.B.E.]], director of the [[Fairtrade Foundation]] (UK).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lamb | first = Harriet | title = Fighting the Banana Wars and Other Fairtrade Battles | publisher = Rider &amp; Co | location = London | year = 2008 | isbn = 1-84604-083-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''Biocybernetics''' is the application of [[cybernetics]] to [[biological science]], composed of biological disciplines that benefit from the application of cybernetics including [[neurology]] and multicellular systems. Biocybernetics plays a major role in [[systems biology]], seeking to integrate different levels of information to understand how biological systems function.

Biocybernetics is an abstract science and is a fundamental part of [[theoretical biology]], based upon the principles of [[systemics]].

== Terminology ==
Biocybernetics is a conjoined word from bio (Greek: βίο / life) and [[cybernetics]] (Greek: κυβερνητική / controlling-governing). Although the extended form of the word is biological cybernetics, the field is most commonly referred to as biocybernetics in scientific papers. Bioinformatics may also be properly referred to as bio informatics.

== Early proponents ==
Early proponents of biocybernetics include Ross Ashby, Hans Drischel, and Norbert Wiener among others. Popular papers published by each scientist are listed below.

[[W. Ross Ashby|Ross Ashby, "Introduction to Cybernetics", 1956]]&lt;ref&gt;[[W. Ross Ashby]], ''Introduction to Cybernetics''. Methuen, London, UK, 1956.  [http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/books/IntroCyb.pdf PDF text].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

[[Norbert Wiener|Norbert Wiener, "Cybernetics or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine", 1948]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Norbert Wiener]], ''Cybernetics or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine'', (Hermann &amp; Cie Editeurs, Paris, The Technology Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc., New York, 1948).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Similar fields ==
Papers and research that delve into topics involving biocybernetics may be found under a multitude of similar names, including molecular cybernetics, neurocybernetics, and cellular cybernetics. Such fields involve disciplines that specify certain aspects of the study of the living organism (for example, neurocybernetics focuses on the study neurological models in organisms).

== Categories ==
* Biocybernetics – the study of an entire living organism
* [[Neurocybernetics]] – cybernetics dealing with neurological models. (''[[Psycho-Cybernetics]]'' was the title of a self-help book, and is not a scientific discipline)
* Molecular cybernetics – cybernetics dealing with molecular systems (e.g. molecular biology cybernetics)
* Cellular cybernetics – cybernetics dealing with cellular systems (e.g. information technology/cell phones or biological cells)
* Evolutionary cybernetics – study of the evolution of informational systems (See also [[evolutionary programming]], [[evolutionary algorithm]])

Visual analysis of complex simulation data using multiple heterogenous views.&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, linking refers to a change of parameters (for example a data filter) in one data representation being reflected in other connected data representations. Brushing refers to highlighting, for example selected data, in one view, in other connected data representations.

One example might be a two-part display, consisting of a [[histogram]] alongside a list of document titles.  The histogram could show how many documents were published each month.  Brushing and linking would allow the user to assign a color, green for instance, to one bar of the histogram, thus causing the titles in the list display that were published during the corresponding month to also be highlighted in green.

In [[telecommunications]], '''busy-hour call attempts''' ('''BHCA''') is a [[teletraffic engineering]] measurement used to evaluate and plan capacity for [[telephone network]]s.&lt;ref name= Waite&gt;{{Google books|TNgtaRRIH1AC|A Practical Guide to Call Center Technology|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; BHCA is the number of [[telephone call]]s attempted at the sliding 60-minute period during which occurs the maximum total [[Traffic volume|traffic load]] in a given 24-hour period (BHCA), and the higher the BHCA, the higher the stress on the network processors.  BHCA is not to be confused with busy hour call completion (BHCC) which measures the throughput capacity of the network. If a bottleneck in the network exists with a capacity lower than the estimated BHCA, then [[network congestion|congestion]] will occur resulting in many failed calls and customer dissatisfaction. 

BHCA is usually used when planning [[telephone switching]] capacities and frequently goes side by side with the [[Erlang unit]] capacity calculation. As an example, a telephone exchange with a capacity of one million BHCA is estimated to handle 250,000 subscribers. The overall calculation is more complex however, and involves accounting for available circuits, desired blocking rates, and Erlang capacity allocated to each subscriber.

==Determination==
The busy hour is determined by fitting a horizontal [[line (mathematics)|line segment]] equivalent to one hour under the traffic [[load curve]] about the peak load point. If the service [[time]] interval is less than 60 minutes, the busy hour is the 60-minute interval that contains the service timer interval. In cases where more than one busy hour occurs in a 24-hour period, ''i.e.,'' when [[wikt:Transwiki:Saturation (telecommunications)|saturation]] occurs, the busy hour or hours most applicable to the particular situation are used.

'''[[Climate change mitigation]] scenarios''' are possible futures in which [[global warming]] is reduced by deliberate actions, such as a comprehensive switch to [[alternative energy|energy sources other than fossil fuels]].  A typical mitigation scenario is constructed by selecting a long-range target, such as a desired atmospheric concentration of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and then fitting the actions to the target, for example by placing a cap on net global and national emissions of [[greenhouse gas]]es.

An increase of global temperature by more than 2{{nbsp}}[[°C]] has come to be the majority definition of what would constitute intolerably dangerous [[climate change]] with efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5{{nbsp}}°C above pre-industrial levels per the [[Paris Agreement]].   Some climate scientists are increasingly of the opinion that the goal should be a complete restoration of the [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]]'s preindustrial condition, on the grounds that too protracted a [[Deviation (statistics)|deviation]] from those conditions will produce irreversible changes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

== Target levels of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ==

{{Importance section|reason=Target levels of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are a '''target''' of mitigation, not a "mitigation scenario" or related to one.|date=March 2012}}
Contributions to climate change, whether they cool or warm the [[Earth]], are often described in terms of the [[radiative forcing]] or imbalance they introduce to the planet's [[energy budget]]. Now and in the future, [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] carbon dioxide is believed to be the major component of this forcing, and the contribution of other components is often quantified in terms of "parts-per-million CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-equivalent" ([[Parts per million|ppm]] [[CO2e|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e]]), or the increment/decrement in carbon dioxide concentrations which would create a radiative forcing of the same magnitude.

At present, non-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; contributions to climate change, positive and negative, are believed to roughly cancel out, so that the net radiative forcing being experienced at present, expressed in ppm CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-e, is more or less the same as the actual current level of carbon dioxide (406.75 ppm CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, as of December 2017). To some extent this legitimates the statement of targets just in terms of ppm CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, as is usually the case. However, the positive and negative non-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will not necessarily balance in future, and so a target stated in terms of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e is less ambiguous.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

=== Stabilization wedges ===

A '''[[Climate stabilization wedge|stabilization wedge]]''' (or simply "wedge") is an action which incrementally reduces projected emissions. The name is derived from the triangular shape of the gap between reduced and unreduced emissions trajectories when graphed over time. For example, a reduction in electricity demand due to increased efficiency means that less electricity needs to be generated and thus fewer emissions need to be produced. The term originates in the [[Stabilization Wedge Game]]. As a reference unit, a stabilization wedge is equal to the following examples of mitigation initiatives: deployment of two million 1 MW [[Wind turbine|wind turbines]]; completely halting the [[deforestation]] and planting of 300 million hectares of trees; the increase in the average energy efficiency of all the world's buildings by 25 percent; or the installation of [[carbon capture and storage]] facilities in 800 large coal-fired power plants.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Complete Guide to Climate Change|last=Dawson|first=Brian|last2=Spannagle|first2=Matt|publisher=Routledge|year=2008|isbn=0415477891|location=Oxon|pages=283}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pacala and Socolow proposed in their work, ''Stabilization Wedges'', that seven wedges are required to be delivered by 2050 - at current technologies - to make a significant impact on the mitigation of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pacala|first=S.|last2=Socolow|first2=R.|date=2004-08-13|title=Stabilization Wedges: Solving the Climate Problem for the Next 50 Years with Current Technologies|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/305/5686/968|journal=Science|language=en|volume=305|issue=5686|pages=968–972|doi=10.1126/science.1100103|issn=0036-8075|pmid=15310891}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, sources that estimate the need for 14 wedges because Pacala and Socolow's proposal would only stabilize carbon dioxide emissions at current levels but not the atmospheric concentration, which is increasing by more than 2 ppm/year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2011, Socolow revised their earlier estimate to nine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thebulletin.org/2011/09/wedges-reaffirmed/|title=Wedges reaffirmed - Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|last=Socolow|first=Robert|date=September 27, 2011|work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|access-date=2018-08-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A mitigation scenario modeled by Malte Meinshausen ''et al.'' suggested in 2006 that to stabilize CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at 350 ppm, we would have needed to reduce emissions by slightly more than 5%  per year.&lt;ref name="multigas"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Meinshausen | first1 = M. | last2 = Hare | first2 = B. | last3 = Wigley | first3 = T.

DeCanio]], [[Eban Goodstein]], Richard B. Howarth, [[Richard B. Norgaard]] and  Catherine S. Norman, stressing " the need for immediate, direct intervention".

[[Blue Ocean Institute]] authors Marah J. Hardt and [[Carl Safina]] support 350 ppm as the maximum upper limit of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere for [[marine life]] [[health]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Scientific American]] August 2010 [[ocean acidification]] article [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=threatening-ocean-life Threatening Oceans from the Inside Out: How Acidification Affects Marine Life] page 72 in print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 450 ppm ===

The BLUE scenarios in the IEA's [[Energy Technology Perspectives]] publication of 2008 describe pathways to a long-range concentration of 450 ppm. [[Joseph Romm]] has sketched how to achieve this target through the application of 14 wedges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://climateprogress.org/2008/04/22/is-450-ppm-or-less-politically-possible-part-2-the-solution/ Is 450 ppm (or less) politically possible? Part 2: The Solution]&lt;/ref&gt;

''World Energy Outlook 2008'', mentioned above, also describes a "450 Policy Scenario", in which extra energy investments to 2030 amount to [[United States dollar|$]]9.3 trillion over the Reference Scenario. The scenario also features, after 2020, the participation of major economies such as [[PRC|China]] and [[India]] in a global cap-and-trade scheme initially operating in [[OECD]] and [[European Union]] countries. Also the less conservative 450 ppm scenario calls for extensive deployment of [[negative carbon dioxide emission|negative emissions]], i.e. the removal of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the atmosphere. According to the [[International Energy Agency]] (IEA) and OECD, "Achieving lower concentration targets (450 ppm) depends significantly on the use of [[BECCS]]".&lt;ref name=OECD&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 550 ppm ===

This is the target advocated (as an upper bound) in the [[Stern Review]]. As approximately a doubling of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels relative to [[industrial society|preindustrial]] times, it implies a temperature increase of about three degrees, according to conventional estimates of [[climate sensitivity]]. [[Mitigation of global warming#Pacala and Socolow|Pacala and Socolow]] list 15 "wedges", any 7 of which in combination should suffice to keep CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels below 550 ppm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/305/5686/968|title=Stabilization Wedges: Solving the Climate Problem for the Next 50 Years with Current Technologies|first1=S.|last1=Pacala|first2=R.|last2=Socolow|date=13 August 2004|publisher=|journal=Science|volume=305|issue=5686|pages=968–972|accessdate=12 April 2018|via=www.sciencemag.org|doi=10.1126/science.1100103|pmid=15310891|bibcode=2004Sci...305..968P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Energy Agency]]'s [[World Energy Outlook]] report for 2008 describes a "Reference Scenario" for the world's energy future "which assumes no new government policies beyond those already adopted by mid-2008", and then a "550 Policy Scenario" in which further policies are adopted, a mixture of "[[cap-and-trade]] systems,  [[economic sector|sectoral]] agreements and national measures". In the Reference Scenario, between 2006 and 2030 the world invests $26.3 trillion in energy-supply infrastructure; in the 550 Policy Scenario, a further $4.1 trillion is spent in this period, mostly on [[efficient energy use|efficiency]] increases which deliver fuel cost savings of over $7 trillion.&lt;ref name="weo08"&gt;http://www.iea.org/weo/docs/weo2008/fact_sheets_08.pdf [[World Energy Outlook]] 2008 Fact Sheet&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other greenhouse gases ==

Greenhouse gas concentrations are aggregated in terms of [[Carbon dioxide equivalent#Equivalent carbon dioxide|carbon dioxide equivalent]]. Some multi-gas mitigation scenarios have been modeled by Meinshausen ''et al.''&lt;ref name="multigas" /&gt;

=== As a short-term focus ===

In a 2000 paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Global warming in the twenty-first century: An alternative scenario|first1=James|last1=Hansen|first2=Makiko|last2=Sato|first3=Reto|last3=Ruedy|first4=Andrew|last4=Lacis|first5=Valdar|last5=Oinas|date=29 August 2000|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=97|issue=18|pages=9875–9880|bibcode=2000PNAS...97.9875H|doi=10.1073/pnas.170278997|doi-access=free|pmc=27611 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hansen argued that the 0.75{{nbsp}}°C{{failed verification|date=July 2016}} rise in average global temperatures over the last 100 years has been driven mainly by greenhouse gases other than carbon dioxide, since warming due to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; had been offset by cooling due to [[aerosols]], implying the viability of a strategy initially based around reducing emissions of non-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; greenhouse gases and of [[black carbon]], focusing on CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; only in the longer run.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ucsusa.wsm.ga3.org/ssi/archive/ucs-review-for-alternative-scenario.html Review of Hansen et al.: Global Warming in the Twenty-First Century: An Alternative Scenario]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was also argued by [[Veerabhadran Ramanathan]] and Jessica Seddon Wallack the September/October 2009 [[Foreign Affairs]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/65238/jessica-seddon-wallack-and-veerabhadran-ramanathan/the-other-climate-changers Why Black Carbon and Ozone Also Matter]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Commentary on the New Testament Use of the Old Testament''''' was edited by [[G. K. Beale]] and [[D. A. Carson]], and published by [[Baker Books]] in 2007.

It is a comprehensive [[Bible commentary]] on [[Old Testament]] references within the [[New Testament]]. The editors headed a team of scholars to identify, explain and comment on both the direct quotations within the text of the New Testament and its many other probable allusions to the Old.

In a 2008 interview, Beale explained that the writers [[Eclecticism|eclectically]] extended the [[historical-grammatical method]] of exegesis, seeking a "biblical-theological perspective that really goes beyond the traditional understanding of grammatical-historical."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Two Testaments, One Story|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2008/februaryweb-only/106-52.0.html?paging=off|accessdate=June 25, 2012|newspaper=Christianity Today|date=February 8, 2008|author=Collin Hansen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Composition5r.jpg|thumb|Composition 1920x1080]]
'''Composition studies''' (also referred to as '''composition and [[rhetoric]]''', '''rhetoric and composition''', '''writing studies''', or simply '''composition''') is the professional field of [[writing]], research, and instruction, focusing especially on writing at the college level in the [[United States]]. In many American colleges and universities, undergraduate [[students]] must take [[freshman]]—sometimes even higher—composition courses. 

Over seventy American universities offer doctoral study in rhetoric and composition,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccccdoctoralconsortium.org/members/ Doctoral Consortium in Rhetoric and Composition]&lt;/ref&gt; programs which usually include study of [[Theories of rhetoric and composition pedagogy|composition pedagogical theory]], [[research methodologies in rhetoric and composition]], and [[Rhetoric|the history of rhetoric]]. Many composition [[scholars]] study not only the [[theory]] and practice of post-secondary [[writing]] instruction, but also the influence of different writing conventions and [[genres]] on writers' composing processes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://genreacrossborders.org/ Genre Across Borders]&lt;/ref&gt; Composition scholars also publish in the fields of teaching [[English as a second or foreign language]] (TESOL), [[writing center]]s, and [[new literacies]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://compfaqs.org/CompFAQs/Home?from=Main.HomePage Comp FAQs from CompPile]&lt;/ref&gt;

==First-year composition==
{{Main|First-year composition}}
Most US universities have a required [[first-year composition]] course, also referred to as FYC. This is not the same as a [[literature]] course, which focuses on literary analysis and interpretation, although some colleges and universities do incorporate literature and other humanities into their composition courses; often, however, composition courses offer intensive instruction in writing [[non-fiction]], expository texts using academic discourse conventions. Writing curricula vary considerably from institution to institution, but it may emphasize many stages of different writing processes (invention or brainstorming, drafting, revision, editing, proofreading), different forms of writing (narration, exposition, description, argumentation, comparison and contrast), different portions of the written product (introductions, conclusions, thesis statements, presentation and documentation of forms of evidence, inclusion of quotations, etc.), along with different modalities of composing to expand the concept of 'writing'. Pedagogies or approaches to teaching writing are grounded in a range of different traditions and philosophies.

==Advanced composition==

Some universities require further instruction in writing and offer courses that expand upon the skills developed in First-year composition. Second level or advanced composition may emphasize forms of argumentation and persuasion, digital media, research and source documentation formats, and/or genres of writing across a range of disciplines and genres (see {{section link||Writing across the curriculum}} below). For example, the skills required to write business letters or annual reports will differ significantly from those required to write historical or scientific research or personal memoirs.

==Graduate studies==

Doctoral programs in Composition Studies are available at more than seventy universities and Masters's programs are available in over 170 universities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mdcwss.com Master's Degree Consortium of Writing Studies Specialists]&lt;/ref&gt; Such programs are commonly housed within English Studies or Education programs. However, recently there are an increasing number of departments specifically dedicated to this field of study (e.g. Composition Studies, Writing &amp; Rhetoric, Composition &amp; Linguistics, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2008/04/04/cccc|title=What Is a Composition and Rhetoric Doctorate?|access-date=2018-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second-language writing==
{{Main|Second language writing}}
Second language writing is the practice of teaching English composition to non native speakers and writers of English. Teaching writing to ESL students does not receive much attention because even in ESL classes teachers focus on speaking, listening and reading, not just writing. [[Paul Kei Matsuda]] in his article "Situating ESL Writing in a Cross-Disciplinary Context" stresses the importance of teaching writing specifically with understanding the needs of ESL students to help them improve their writing.&lt;ref&gt;Matsuda, Paul K. "Situating ESL Writing in a Cross-Disciplinary Context." Written Communication, Sage Publications, 1998, 15 (1), pp 99-121.&lt;/ref&gt; Teaching writing has progressed through several approaches during the history of education in the United States. ESL teachers might need to explore common methods which are the cognitive, social and expressive theories to create an approach that meets the needs of ESL writers and help them to overcome their difficulties.

The first one of these approaches is the cognitive view which says that writing is progressing from one stage to another in a series of single steps. That means "good" writing is a planned process, which includes planning, translating and reviewing. "Understanding Composing" by Sondra Perl explains in detail this approach.&lt;ref&gt;Perl, Sondra. "Understanding Composing" Handout, Composition Theories, University of Akron, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; She suggests that the composition of writing occurs as a recursive process. She took this idea from her observation of different writers. She thinks that writers return to "backwards" parts of the process in order to move "forward" with the overall composition. ESL teachers may find this approach helpful at first in teaching beginning ESL students because at this level students do not have large amounts of vocabulary and grammar or knowledge of the style of essays which is the basis of writing English. Al-Buainain Haifa in her article "Student Writing Errors in EFL," points out that, when a researcher asked ESL students by using a survey what they would like to have learned or learned better in their writing classes, they found that the largest percentages expressed specific needs in vocabulary and grammar &lt;ref&gt;Al-Buainain, Haifa. "Student Writing Errors in EFL." Qatar University, 2006, pp 1 -37.&lt;/ref&gt;(17). Many kinds of grammar make ESL students confused, especially because there are many exceptions. Because writing styles are different in different languages, ESL students need time to master them. Therefore, ESL teachers should find an effective way to teach ESL students vocabulary, grammar and style because the writing of English requires them. The cognitive approach can meet these needs because it emphasizes the steps, organization and process of writing.

Another approach is the social view which shows the importance of teaching writing by making students learn the different languages of discourse communities. This is what David Bartholomae emphasizes in his article "Inventing the University".&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomae, David "Inventing the University," Cross-Talk in Comp Theory, A Reader, 3rd ed. Edited by Victor Villanueva and Kristin L. Arola, National Council of Teachers of English, 2011, pp. 523- 555.&lt;/ref&gt; He uses "Inventing the University" as a phrase that describes the writing process that a student will experience when writing teachers ask them to write about a topic that relates with a discourse community which is new for them. Discourse community can be thought of as members of an academic discipline or a select audience. When the ESL students have become good at grammar and style, they face a large problem when they enter their chosen academic field. Bartholomae in this article illustrates that each academic community has a particular language or vocabulary. The problem is that any academic field has its own language, even jargon, that differs from one to another. This problem is faced not only by ESL students, but all American students will struggle with this when they begin the first year of their academic life. The social approach can be used by ESL teachers as a second step but they should make sure that their students master the basics of English writing such as grammar and style.

Moreover, the expressive view which is represented in Donald Murray's article "Teach Writing as a Process Not Product", allows for wittier creating and freer movement.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Donald M. "Teach Writing as a Process Not Product." Cross-Talk in Comp Theory, A Reader, 3rd ed. Edited by Victor Villanueva and Kristin L. Arola, National Council of Teachers of English, 2011, pp 3-6.&lt;/ref&gt; It suggests three elements for "good" writing which are integrity, originality, and spontaneity. However, it is difficult to evaluate them in a paper. Therefore, these standards cannot be relied upon to judge writing. In addition, these elements are not the important elements that help to assess "good" writing. ESL teachers might use this approach but it can only be used for highly advanced ESL students. It is difficult to ask ESL students to write freely if they possess limited vocabulary or grammar. They need examples to help them which they can find in the cognitive approach.

ESL teachers may use these common ways of teaching writing, but they need first to understand their student's difficulties. Learning writing is one of the essential difficulties that ESL students find in studying English, especially since writing is important in an academic community. Some ESL students may need to jump from being a student who does not speak English ever to a student who uses academic language in a short time which may put a large burden on their shoulders. Hence, teaching writing to ESL students is different than teaching native speakers. ESL teachers need to choose an effective way to meet the needs of ESL students. It would be helpful if ESL teachers look at these different ways of teaching writing to see which one addresses ESL students' difficulties in the best way or if a combination of these theories may be better.

=== Multicultural pedagogies ===

==== Basis in composition studies ====
While multicultural pedagogies are not specifically tied to second-language writing pedagogies, compositionists have often considered how students' cultural knowledge and use of idioms, dialects, and/or languages other than American Edited English (AEA) can enhance their instruction in English composition. For example, Maxine Hairston's "Diversity, Ideology, and Teaching Writing" advocates for students' expressivist writing to be central in a composition course, and believes students "need to write to find out how much they know and to gain confidence in the ability to express themselves effectively" (186).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hairston|first=Maxine|year=1992|title=Diversity, Ideology, and Teaching Writing|url=|journal=College Composition and Communication|volume=43.3|pages=178–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hairston also believes that teachers can design writing assignments to encourage "cross-cultural awareness" (191).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, Beth Daniell's approach in "Narratives of Literacy: Connecting College Composition to Culture" describes how studies in "little narratives [that] almost all examine literacy in particular local settings" championed by scholars who "seldom make theoretical statements that claim to be valid for literate cultures in general or literate cultures in general," which would allow students to engage in cultural critique (403).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Daniell|first=Beth|year=1999|title=Narratives of Literacy: Connecting College Composition to Culture|url=|journal=College Composition and Communication|volume=50|pages=393–410}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaron Schutz and Anne Ruggles Gere's article for ''College English'', "Service Learning and English Studies," described how Schutz's course, while it was mainly focused in service learning and local activism, engaged students in collaborative research and writing surrounding campus-wide issues, such as an instance of racial discrimination that occurred in the local student union; this allowed students to engage in cultural awareness as well as cultural critique (129-39).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schutz|first=Aaron|last2=Anne|first2=Gere|year=1998|title=Service Learning and English Studies: Rethinking 'Public Service|url=|journal=College English|volume=60|pages=129–149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, In ''Empowering Education,'' Ira Shor delineates a pedagogy in which the teacher facilitates discussion of generative themes produced by the students, using the example of his basic writing course with working-class students at "a low-budget college in New York City" several decades ago (10).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Empowering Education: Critical Teaching for Social Change|last=Shor|first=Ira|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1992|isbn=978-0-226-14786-4|location=Chicago|pages=|quote=|via=Google Play Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Freirean approach for teaching literacy and writing that Shor reviews in ''Empowering Education'' demonstrates how the generative words manifested themselves "[through] researching local issues and language in the students' communities. From the many linguistic and sociological items…the educators selected some key concerns—generative themes expressed through generative words" (55).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In this framework, teachers and students research these items collaboratively, and once students have presented their research on problems in their community, they may begin to decide how they might analyze and upend power structures or rhetorical situations that contribute to and exacerbate such issues. For Shor's classroom, "[t]he generative themes [that have] emerg[ed]…from student culture have most often related to sex, abortion, drugs, family, education, careers, work, and the economic crisis" (56).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Shor believes it is important to allow students to build a basis for problem-posing upon their prior knowledge and experiences to make it multicultural.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Shor also reviews Paolo Freire's literacy project in Brazil as described in Freire's ''Pedagogy of the Oppressed'', which enforces the idea that all people are creators of culture through visuals, oral discussion, and creation of word lists that are the basis for which the people begin to use language to express how the dominant culture operates, how their home culture operates, and how these systemic actions impact themselves and the world (Freire 87-124).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pedagogy of the Oppressed: 30th Anniversary Edition|last=Freire|first=Paolo|publisher=Bloomsbury|year=2014|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|translator-last=Ramos|translator-first=Myra|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, both Freire and Shor believe problem-posing education can be situated in multicultural practices as well as critical literacy practices. Shor insists "subject matter is best introduced as problems related to student experience, in language familiar to them" (63).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Critical reception ====
Overall, previous scholars' discussion of multiculturalism in the classroom seems to privilege "cross-cultural interactions" and valuing students' home languages as well as their cultural ideologies. However, in Donald Lazere's ''Political Literacy in Composition and Rhetoric'', Lazere criticizes Hairston, Daniell, Schutz, Gere, and other scholars for their approaches because of their singular focus on localism in lieu of more "global" and critical approaches to the study of culture in the composition classroom (152-153).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Political Literacy in Composition and Rhetoric: Defending Academic Discourse Against Postmodern Pluralism|last=Lazere|first=Donald|publisher=Southern Illinois UP|year=2015|isbn=978-0-8093-3428-5|location=Carbondale|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Lazere was critical of scholars' tendency to diminish the power of Edited American English (EAE) and misrepresent the power of the students' regional code (116).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; While Lazere supports Shor's approach to multicultural critical pedagogy, he admits some level of discomfort with applying it in his own classroom especially with respect to how much responsibility and stock Shor places in students (39).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Current approaches ====
Lazere's critique of previous scholarship related to multiculturalism pedagogies, in ''Political Literacy in Composition and Rhetoric'' and elsewhere, has prompted current composition theorists, both in second-language writing and in the field of composition in general, to consider how multicultural pedagogies can embrace globalism as much as localism.

For example, Lisa Eck's "Thinking Globally, Teaching Locally" describes how Eck teaches world literature courses in which students read cultural narratives and problematize them—in the article, she references her use of Tsitsi Dangarembga's ''Nervous Conditions'' in her composition classroom.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eck|first=Lisa|year=2008|title=Thinking Globally, Teaching Locally|url=|journal=College English|volume=60|pages=578–598|via=CompPile}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through her teaching, she is attempting to answer the question of how multicultural pedagogical practices could still be based in research, critical literacy, and problem-posing education. In her approach, she engages students in the kind of literary criticism that is necessary for analyzing and evaluating critical discourse: "I work to make hybrid postcolonial identities familiar, even analogous at times, to what we understand as the process of identity formation for the average postmodern college student….I [also] use the Otherness of the cultures reproduced in foreign texts to estrange the American familiar" (579).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The kinds of inquiry students are using to analyze the text are to show how the text is ''both'' "not about you" and "about you," and how these processes of identity formation are the kinds of processes necessary to critically evaluate public discourse.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Furthermore, Jennifer S. Wilson's approach to critical pedagogy in second-language writing as she describes it in her article, "Engaging Second Language Writers in Freshman Composition: A Critical Approach," utilizes a perspective that provides opportunities for the types of writing necessary for students to critically analyze and evaluate ideologies entrenched in the dominant discourse, even as they are learning English as their second language.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Jennifer|year=2010|title=Engaging Second Language Writers in Freshman Composition: A Critical Approach|url=|journal=Composition Forum|volume=22|pages=1–14|via=CompPile}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the four major elements of the course that Wilson describes, especially with respect to the ideas she offers for critical writing assignments, create alternative pathways for students to produce writing that has the potential to disrupt cultural and political ideologies represented in various avenues and niches of the dominant public discourse. For example, in addition to incorporating "local topics," Wilson provides options for students to "investigate language use in certain communities, societies, or cultures" as well as "investigating" the relationships between language and power (8-9).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Even more important, she insists that "[c]ritical pedagogy is concerned with minimizing the power differential between student and teacher; in composition classrooms one way for students to maximize their voices is to publish their work in authentic ways" (9).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Writing across the curriculum==
{{Main|Writing across the curriculum}}
Because academic discourse is not monolithic (in other words, there are curricula that address that the concept of academic discourse can be applied to specific parts of a writing curriculum), many compositionists have created a writing across the curriculum (WAC) movement that situates writing-intensive instruction in specific academic [[discourse]] communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/composing-a-community-a-history-of-writing-across-the-curriculum/oclc/318390431&amp;referer=brief_results|title=Composing a community: a history of writing across the curriculum|last=McLeod|first=Susan H|last2=Soven|first2=Margot Iris|date=2006|publisher=Parlor Press|isbn=1932559175|location=West Lafayette, Ind.|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing in the disciplines==

Many university writing programs include writing in the disciplines (WID) courses, which focus on the genres and writing procedures that occur within specific fields of research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wac.colostate.edu/intro/pop2e.cfm|title=The WAC Clearinghouse|website=wac.colostate.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing center==
{{Main|Writing center}}
Many colleges and universities have a writing center, which offers supplementary tutorial support for writing specifically in English classes and/or across the curriculum. Many universities not in North America only offer writing instruction via writing centers. The European Association for the Teaching of Academic Writing (EATAW),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eataw.eu/ |title=European Association for the Teaching of Academic Writing |website=eataw.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, specifically concerns itself with the study and advancement of writing centers in Europe.

Since [[multimodality]] has resonated with Composition Studies, many writing centers have developed associated centers to support students' multimodal, multimedia composing. Some models for this work include the [[digital studio]] and the multiliteracy center.

'''Construction management''' ('''CM''') is a professional service that uses specialized, project management techniques to oversee the planning, design, and construction of a project, from its beginning to its end. The purpose of CM is to control a project's time, cost and quality—sometimes referred to as a project's "triple constraint."&lt;ref&gt;3rd Forum "International Construction Project Management" 26th/27 June 2003 in Berlin&lt;/ref&gt; CM is compatible with all [[Project delivery method|project delivery systems]], including design-bid-build, design-build, CM At-Risk and Public Private Partnerships. Professional construction managers may be reserved for lengthy, large-scale, high budget undertakings ([[Commercial property|commercial real estate]], [[Transport#Infrastructure|transportation infrastructure]], industrial facilities, and [[Infrastructure#Military|military infrastructure]]), called capital projects.

==The role of a contractor==
Contractors are assigned to a [[construction]] project during the design or once the design has been completed by a licensed architect or a licensed civil engineer. This is done by going through a [[bidding]] process with different contractors. The contractor is selected by using one of three common selection methods: low-bid selection, best-value selection, or qualifications-based selection.

A construction manager should have the ability to handle [[public safety]], [[time management]], [[cost management]], [[quality management]], [[decision making]], [[mathematics]], [[working drawings]], and [[human resources]].&lt;ref name="textbook"/&gt;

== Function ==
The functions of construction management typically include the following: 
#Specifying project objectives and plans including delineation of scope, budgeting, scheduling, setting performance requirements, and selecting project participants.
#Maximizing the resource efficiency through [[procurement]] of labor, materials and equipment.
#Implementing various operations through proper coordination and control of planning, design, estimating, contracting and construction in the entire process.
#Developing effective [[Construction Communication|communications]] and mechanisms for resolving conflicts.:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=What Is Construction Project Management? | url=http://www.pmhut.com/what-is-construction-project-management | author=Gerardo Viera | publisher=PM Hut | date=September 2008 | accessdate=2010-07-04 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420205521/http://www.pmhut.com/what-is-construction-project-management | archivedate=2010-04-20 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Construction Management Association of America (CMAA)|Construction Management Association of America]] (CMAA) states the most common responsibilities of a Construction Manager fall into the following 7 categories: Project Management Planning, Cost Management, Time Management, Quality Management, Contract Administration, Safety Management, and CM Professional Practice. CM professional practice includes specific activities, such as defining the responsibilities and management structure of the project management team, organizing and leading by implementing project controls, defining roles and responsibilities, developing communication protocols, and identifying elements of project design and construction likely to give rise to disputes and claims.&lt;ref name="CMAA"&gt;{{cite web | title=CMAA | website=CMAA | url=http://cmaanet.org/ | language=af | accessdate=2015-07-22 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20150724183335/http://cmaanet.org/ | archivedate=2015-07-24 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seven types of construction==
*'''Agricultural:''' Typically economical buildings, and other improvements, for agricultural purposes. Examples include barns, equipment and animal sheds, specialized fencing, storage [[silo]]s and [[elevator]]s, and water supply and drains such as wells, tanks, and ditches.
*'''Residential:''' Residential construction includes houses, apartments, townhouses, and other smaller, low-rise housing, small office types.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt; 
*'''Commercial:''' This refers to construction for the needs of private commerce, trade, and services. Examples include office buildings, "big box" stores, shopping centers and malls, warehouses, banks, theaters, casinos, resorts, golf courses, and larger residential structures such as high-rise hotels and condominiums.
*'''Institutional:''' This category is for the needs of government and other public organizations. Examples include schools, fire and police stations, libraries, museums, dormitories, research buildings, hospitals, transportation terminals, some military facilities, and governmental buildings.
*'''Industrial:''' Buildings and other constructed items used for storage and product production, including chemical and power plants, steel mills, oil refineries and platforms, manufacturing plants, pipelines, and seaports.
*'''Heavy civil:''' The construction of transportation [[infrastructure]] such as roads, bridges, railroads, tunnels, airports, and fortified military facilities.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt; Dams are also included, but most other water-related infrastructure is considered environmental.
*'''Environmental:''' Environmental construction was part of heavy civil, but is now separate, dealing with projects that improve the environment. Some examples are water and wastewater treatment plants, sanitary and storm sewers, solid waste management, and air pollution control.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt;

==Obtaining the project==

===Bids===
A bid is given to the owner by construction managers that are willing to complete their construction project. A bid tells the owner how much money they should expect to pay the construction management company in order for them to complete the project.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt;
*'''Open bid''': An open bid is used for public projects. Any and all contractors are allowed to submit their bid due to public advertising.
*'''Closed bid''': A closed bid is used for private projects. A selection of contractors are sent an invitation for bid so only they can submit a bid for the specified project.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt;

===Selection methods===
*'''Low-bid selection''': This selection focuses on the price of a project. Multiple construction management companies submit a bid to the owner that is the lowest amount they are willing to do the job for. Then the owner usually chooses the company with the lowest bid to complete the job for them.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt;
*'''Best-value selection''': This selection focuses on both the price and qualifications of the contractors submitting bids. This means that the owner chooses the contractor with the best price and the best qualifications. The owner decides by using a request for proposal (RFP), which provides the owner with the contractor's exact form of scheduling and budgeting that the contractor expects to use for the project.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt;
*'''Qualifications-based selection''': This selection is used when the owner decides to choose the contractor only on the basis of their qualifications. The owner then uses a request for qualifications (RFQ), which provides the owner with the contractor's experience, management plans, project organization, and budget and schedule performance. The owner may also ask for safety records and individual credentials of their members.&lt;ref name=textbook&gt;{{cite book|title=Construction Management Jumpstart|year=2010|publisher=Wiley|location=Indianapolis, Indiana|author=Barbara J. Jackson|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method is most often used when the contractor is hired early during the design process so that the contractor can provide input and cost estimates as the design develops.

===Payment contracts===
*'''Lump sum''': This is the most common type of contract. The construction manager and the owner agree on the overall cost of the construction project and the owner is responsible for paying that amount whether the construction project exceeds or falls below the agreed price of payment.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt;
*'''Cost plus fee''': This contract provides payment for the contractor including the total cost of the project as well as a fixed fee or percentage of the total cost. This contract is beneficial to the contractor since any additional costs will be paid for, even though they were unexpected for the owner.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt;
*'''Guaranteed maximum price''': This contract is the same as the cost-plus-fee contract although there is a set price that the overall cost and fee do not go above.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt;
*'''Unitprice''': This contract is used when the cost cannot be determined ahead of time. The owner provides materials with a specific unit price to limit spending.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt;

==Project stages==
[[File:Buildings-05-00209-g001.png|thumb|right|Characteristics of construction project stages of various project management approaches&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;]]
The stages of a typical construction project have been defined as '''feasibility''', '''design''', '''construction''' and '''operation''',&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Antunes |first1=Ricardo |last2=Gonzalez |first2=Vicente |title=A Production Model for Construction:  A Theoretical Framework |journal=Buildings |date=3 March 2015 |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=209–228 |doi=10.3390/buildings5010209}}&lt;/ref&gt; each stage relating to the project life cycle.
===Feasibility and design===
Feasibility and design involves four steps: programming and feasibility, schematic design, design development, and contract documents. It is the responsibility of the design team to ensure that the design meets all building codes and regulations. It is during the design stage that the bidding process takes place.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt;
*'''Conceptual/Programming and feasibility:''' The needs, goals, and objectives must be determined for the building. Decisions must be made on the building size, number of rooms, how the space will be used, and who will be using the space. This must all be considered to begin the actual designing of the building. This phase is normally a written list of each room or space, the critical information about those spaces, and the approximate square footage of each area.
*'''Schematic design:''' Schematic designs are sketches used to identify spaces, shapes, and patterns. Materials, sizes, colors, and textures must be considered in the sketches.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt; This phase usually involves developing the floor plan, elevations, a site plan, and possibly a few details.
*'''Design development (DD):''' This step requires research and investigation into what materials and equipment will be used as well as their cost. During this phase, the drawings are refined with information from structural, plumbing, mechanical, and electrical engineers. It also involves a more rigorous evaluation how the applicable building codes will impact the project.
*'''Contract documents (CDs):''' Contract documents are the final drawings and specifications of the construction project. They are used by contractors to determine their bid while builders use them for the construction process. Contract documents can also be called working drawings.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt;

===Pre-construction===
The pre-construction stage begins when the owner gives a notice to proceed to the contractor that they have chosen through the bidding process. A notice to proceed is when the owner gives permission to the contractor to begin their work on the project. The first step is to assign the project team which includes the project manager (PM), contract administrator, [[Superintendent (construction)|superintendent]], and field engineer.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt;
*'''Project manager''': The project manager is in charge of the project team.
*'''Contract administrator''': The contract administrator assists the project manager as well as the superintendent with the details of the construction contract.
*'''Superintendent''': It is the superintendent's job to make sure everything is on schedule including flow of materials, deliveries, and equipment. They are also in charge of coordinating on-site construction activities.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt;
*'''Field engineer''': A field engineer is considered an entry-level position and is responsible for paperwork.
During the pre-construction stage, a site investigation must take place. A site investigation takes place to discover if any steps need to be implemented on the job site. This is in order to get the site ready before the actual construction begins. This also includes any unforeseen conditions such as historical artifacts or environment problems. A soil test must be done to determine if the soil is in good condition to be built upon.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt;

===Procurement===
The procurement stage is when labor, materials and equipment needed to complete the project are purchased. This can be done by the general contractor if the company does all their own construction work. If the contractor does not do their own work, they obtain it through subcontractors. Subcontractors are contractors who specialize in one particular aspect of the construction work such as concrete, welding, glass, or carpentry. Subcontractors are hired the same way a general contractor would be, which is through the bidding process. Purchase orders are also part of the procurement stage.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt;
*'''Purchase orders:''' A purchase order is used in various types of businesses. In this case, a purchase order is an agreement between a buyer and seller that the products purchased meet the required specifications for the agreed price.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt;

===Construction===
The construction stage begins with a pre-construction meeting brought together by the superintendent (on an American project). The pre-construction meeting is meant to make decisions dealing with work hours, material storage, quality control, and site access. The next step is to move everything onto the construction site and set it all up.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt;

A '''Contractor progress payment schedule''' is a schedule of when (according to project milestones or specified dates) contractors and suppliers will be paid for the current progress of installed work.

'''Progress payments''' are partial payments for work completed during a portion, usually a month, during a construction period. Progress payments are made to general contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers as construction projects progress. Payments are typically made on a monthly basis but could be modified to meet certain milestones. Progress payments are an important part of contract administration for the contractor. Proper preparation of the information necessary for payment processing can help the contractor financially complete the project.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Minks|first=William|title=Construction Jobsite Management|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Owner occupancy===
Once the owner moves into the building, a warranty period begins. This is to ensure that all materials, equipment, and quality meet the expectations of the owner that are included within the contract.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt;

==Issues resulting from construction==

===Dust and mud===
When construction vehicles are driving around a site or moving earth, a lot of dust is created, especially during the dryer months. This may cause disruption for surrounding businesses or homes. A popular method of dust control is to have a water truck driving through the site spraying water on the dry dirt to minimize the movement of dust within and out of the construction site. When water is introduced mud is created. This mud sticks to the tires of the construction vehicles and is often lead out to the surrounding roads.  A street sweeper may clean the roads to reduce dirty road conditions.

===Environmental protections===
*'''Storm [[water pollution]]:''' As a result of construction, the soil is displaced from its original location which can possibly cause environmental problems in the future. Runoff can occur during storms which can possibly transfer harmful pollutants through the soil to rivers, lakes, wetlands, and coastal waters. 
*'''Endangered species:''' If [[endangered]] species have been found on the construction site, the site must be shut down for some time. The construction site must be shut down for as long as it takes for authorities to make a decision on the situation. Once the situation has been assessed, the contractor makes the appropriate accommodations to not disturb the species.
*'''Vegetation:''' There may often be particular trees or other vegetation that must be protected on the job site. This may require fences or security tape to warn builders that they must not be harmed.
*'''Wetlands:''' The contractor must make accommodations so that erosion and water flow are not affected by construction. Any liquid spills must be maintained due to contaminants that may enter the wetland.
*'''Historical or [[cultural artifacts]]:''' Artifacts may include arrowheads, pottery shards, and bones. All work comes to a halt if any artifacts are found and will not resume until they can be properly examined and removed from the area.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt;

==Construction activity documentation==
Project meetings take place at scheduled intervals to discuss the progress on the construction site and any concerns or issues. The discussion and any decisions made at the meeting must be documented.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt;

Diaries, logs, and daily field reports keep track of the daily activities on a job site each day.
*'''Diaries:''' Each member of the project team is expected to keep a project [[diary]]. The diary contains summaries of the day's events in the member's own words. They are used to keep track of any daily work activity, conversations, observations, or any other relevant information regarding the construction activities. Diaries can be referred to when disputes arise and a diary happens to contain information connected with the disagreement. Diaries that are handwritten can be used as evidence in court.
*'''Logs:''' Logs keep track of the regular activities on the job site such as phone logs, transmittal logs, delivery logs, and RFI (Request for Information) logs.
*'''Daily field reports:''' Daily field reports are a more formal way of recording information on the job site. They contain information that includes the day's activities, temperature and weather conditions, delivered equipment or materials, visitors on the site, and equipment used that day.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt;

Labor statements are required on a daily basis. Also list of Labor, PERT CPM are needed for labor planning to complete a project in time.

==Resolving disputes==
*'''Mediation:''' [[Mediation]] uses a third party mediator to resolve any disputes. The mediator helps both disputing parties to come to a mutual agreement. This process ensures that no attorneys become involved in the dispute and is less time-consuming.
*'''Minitrial:''' A minitrial takes more time and money than a mediation. The minitrial takes place in an informal setting and involves some type of advisor or attorney that must be paid. The disputing parties may come to an agreement or the third party advisor may offer their advice. The agreement is nonbinding and can be broken. 
*'''Arbitration:''' [[Arbitration]] is the most costly and time-consuming way to resolve a dispute. Each party is represented by an attorney while witnesses and evidence are presented. Once all information is provided on the issue, the arbitrator makes a ruling which provides the final decision. The arbitrator provides the final decision on what must be done and it is a binding agreement between each of the disputing parties.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt;

==Study and practice==
Construction Management education comes in a variety of formats: formal degree programs (Two-year [[associate degree]]; four-year [[baccalaureate degree]], [[masters degree]], [[project management]], [[operations management]] [[engineer degree]], [[doctor of philosophy]] degree, [[postdoctoral researcher]]); on-the-job-training; and continuing education and professional development. Information on degree programs is available from [[ABET]], the American Council for Construction Education (ACCE), the Construction Management Association of America (CMAA) or the Associated Schools of Construction (ASC).
 
According to the American Council for Construction Education (one of the academic accreditation agencies responsible for accrediting construction management programs in the U.S.), the academic field of construction management encompasses a wide range of topics. These range from general management skills, through management skills specifically related to construction, to technical knowledge of construction methods and practices. There are many schools offering Construction Management programs, including some offering a master's degree.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/college/tools/search.php# {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922010056/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/college/tools/search.php |date=2007-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acce-hq.org/PDF/form103.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326180259/http://www.acce-hq.org/PDF/form103.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2009-03-26|title=Standards and criteria for accreditation of post-secondary construction education degree programs|publisher=American Council for Construction Management|accessdate=2006-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software==

Capital project management software (CPMS) refers to the systems that are currently available that help capital project owner/operators, program managers, and construction managers, control and manage the vast amount of information that capital construction projects create. A collection, or portfolio of projects only makes this a bigger challenge. These systems go by different names: capital project management software, computer construction software, construction management software, project management information systems. Usually Construction Management can be referred as subset of CPMS where the scope of CPMS is not limited to construction phases of project. Among main construction management software can be mentioned [[Procore]] and [[PlanGrid]].

==Business model==
[[File:Panamá Construction.JPG|thumb|alt=Two tall buildings, with construction cranes on top, next to much taller skyscraper|[[Skyscraper]]s under construction in [[Panama City]], [[Panama]]]]
The construction industry typically includes three parties: an owner, a licensed designer ([[architect]] or [[engineer]]) and a builder (usually known as a [[general contractor]]). There are traditionally two contracts between these parties as they work together to plan, design and construct the project.&lt;ref&gt;Halpin, Daniel. Construction Management. Hoboken, NJ: Wiley, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The first contract is the owner-designer contract, which involves planning, design, and construction contract administration. The second contract is the owner-contractor contract, which involves construction. An indirect third-party relationship exists between the designer and the contractor, due to these two contracts.

An owner may also contract with a construction project management company as an adviser, creating a third contract relationship in the project. The construction manager's role is to provide construction advice to the designer, design advice to the constructor on the owner's behalf and other advice as necessary.

===Design, bid, build contracts===
{{Main|Design–bid–build}}
The phrase "design, bid, build" describes the prevailing model of construction management, in which the general contractor is engaged through a tender process after designs have been completed by the architect or engineer.

==={{anchor|Design and build contracts}}Design-build contracts===
{{Main|Design–build}}
Many owners – particularly government agencies – let out contracts known as ''design-build contracts''. In this type of contract, the construction team (known as the design-builder) is responsible for taking the owner's concept and completing a detailed design before (following the owner's approval of the design) proceeding with construction. [[Virtual design and construction]] technology may be used by contractors to maintain a tight construction time.

There are three main advantages to a design-build contract. First, the construction team is motivated to work with the architect to develop a practical design. The team can find creative ways to reduce construction costs without reducing the function of the final product. The second major advantage involves the schedule. Many projects are commissioned within a tight time frame. Under a traditional contract, construction cannot begin until after the design is finished and the project has been awarded to a bidder. In a design-build contract the contractor is established at the outset, and construction activities can proceed concurrently with the design. The third major advantage is that the design-build contractor has an incentive to keep the combined design and construction costs within the owner's budget. If speed is important, design and construction contracts can be awarded separately; bidding takes place on preliminary plans in a not-to-exceed contract instead of a single firm design-build contract.

The major problem&lt;ref name=designbuild&gt;{{cite web|last=Stagner|first=Steve|title=Design-Build and Alternative Project Delivery in Texas|url=http://www.cectexas.org/research_&amp;_policy_issues/documents/2007DesignBuildandAlternateProjectDeliveryIssuesinTexas.pdf|publisher=Texas Council of Engineering Companies|accessdate=18 October 2011|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110912011002/http://www.cectexas.org/research_%26_policy_issues/documents/2007DesignBuildandAlternateProjectDeliveryIssuesinTexas.pdf|archivedate=12 September 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with design-build contracts is an inherent conflict of interest. In a standard contract the architect works for the owner and is directly responsible to the owner. In design-build the architect works for the design-builder, not the owner, therefor the design-builder may make design and construction decisions that benefit the design-builder, but that do not benefit the owner. During construction, the architect normally acts as the owner's representative. This includes reviewing the builder's work and ensuring that the products and methods meet specifications and codes. The architect's role is compromised when the architect works for the design-builder and not for the owner directly. Thus, the owner may get a building that is over-designed to increase profits for the design-builder, or a building built with lesser-quality products to maximize profits.

===Planning and scheduling===
Project-management methodology is as follows:
*Work breakdown structure
*Project network of activities
**[[Critical path method]] (CPM)
**Resource management
**Resource leveling
**Risk assessment

==={{anchor|Architecture–Engineer}}Architecture–engineer===
*Work inspection
*Change orders
*Review payments
*Materials and samples
*Shop drawings
*Three-dimensional image

===Agency CM===
Construction cost management is a fee-based service in which the construction manager (CM) is responsible exclusively to the owner, acting in the owner's interests at every stage of the project. The construction manager offers impartial advice on matters such as:
*Optimum use of available funds
*Control of the scope of the work
*Project scheduling
*Optimum use of design and construction firms' skills and talents
*Avoidance of delays, changes and disputes
*Enhancing project design and construction quality
*Optimum flexibility in contracting and procurement
*Cash-flow management

Comprehensive management of every stage of the project, beginning with the original concept and project definition, yields the greatest benefit to owners. As time progresses beyond the pre-design phase, the CM's ability to effect cost savings diminishes. The agency CM can represent the owner by helping select the design and construction teams and managing the design (preventing [[scope creep]]), helping the owner stay within a predetermined budget with value engineering, cost-benefit analysis and best-value comparisons. The software-application field of [[construction collaboration technology]] has been developed to apply information technology to construction management.

===CM at-risk===
CM at-risk is a delivery method which entails a commitment by the construction manager to deliver the project within a [[Guaranteed Maximum Price]] (GMP). The construction manager acts as a consultant to the owner in the development and design phases (preconstruction services), and as a general contractor during construction. When a construction manager is bound to a GMP, the fundamental character of the relationship is changed. In addition to acting in the owner's interest, the construction manager must control construction costs to stay within the GMP.

CM at-risk is a global term referring to the business relationship of a construction contractor, owner and architect (or designer). Typically, a CM at-risk arrangement eliminates a "low-bid" construction project. A GMP agreement is a typical part of the CM-and-owner agreement (comparable to a "low-bid" contract), but with adjustments in responsibility for the CM. The advantage of a CM at-risk arrangement is budget management. Before a project's design is completed (six to eighteen months of coordination between designer and owner), the CM is involved with estimating the cost of constructing a project based on the goals of the designer and owner (design concept) and the project's scope. In balancing the costs, schedule, quality and scope of the project, the design may be modified instead of redesigned; if the owner decides to expand the project, adjustments can be made before pricing. To manage the budget before design is complete and construction crews mobilized, the CM conducts site management and purchases major items to efficiently manage time and cost.&lt;ref name="The Risk in CM At-Risk"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Strang |first=Warner |date=2002 |title=The Risk In CM "At-Risk" |url=https://cmaanet.org/files/risk_in_cm_at_risk.pdf |format=PDF |journal=CM eJournal |volume=4 |issue=9 |pages=3–8 |access-date=July 22, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304084545/https://cmaanet.org/files/risk_in_cm_at_risk.pdf |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Advantages====
*CM is working "at risk", therefore have incentive to act in the owner's interest, as well as to efficiently manage construction costs, considering they would be liable for any amount in excess of the GMP
*Ability to handle changes in design or scope&lt;ref name="Sierra Companies 2013"&gt;{{cite web | title=Advantages and Disadvantages of Construction Delivery Methods | website=Sierra Companies | date=2013-01-14 | url=http://sierracompanies.com/delivery_methods/ | accessdate=2015-07-22 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722235725/http://sierracompanies.com/delivery_methods/ | archivedate=2015-07-22 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Drawbacks====
*If a cost overrun occurred, it could cost the CM a great deal of money
* The CM is allowed some mistake-related contingency, therefore there is a possibility that they will compensate by reducing the scope of the work to fit the GMP
* Since the GMP is settled before design begins, it is difficult for owners to know whether they received the best possible bid&lt;ref name="The Risk in CM At-Risk"/&gt;

====Bottom line====
An at-risk delivery method is best for large projects—both complete construction and renovation—that are not easy to define, have a possibility of changing in scope, or have strict schedule deadlines. Additionally, it is an efficient method in projects containing technical complexity, multi-trade coordination, or multiple phases.&lt;ref name="Sierra Companies 2013"/&gt;

===Accelerated construction techniques===
Starting with its Accelerated Bridge Program in the late 2000s, the [[Massachusetts Department of Transportation]] began employing accelerated construction techniques, in which it signs contracts with incentives for early completion and penalties for late completion, and uses intense construction during longer periods of complete closure to shorten the overall project duration and reduce cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/publicroads/12mayjune/03.cfm|title=Public Roads - The Fast 14 Project, May/June 2012 - FHWA-HRT-12-004|author=|date=|website=www.fhwa.dot.gov|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231001800/http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/publicroads/12mayjune/03.cfm|archivedate=2013-12-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Study and importance==
[[File:Artist’s impression of dust formation around a supernova explosion.jpg|thumb|Artist’s impression of dust formation around a supernova explosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=VLT Clears Up Dusty Mystery|url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1421/|accessdate=8 August 2014|work=ESO Press Release}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Cosmic dust was once solely an annoyance to astronomers, as it obscures objects they wish to observe. When [[infrared astronomy]] began, the dust particles were observed to be significant and vital components of astrophysical processes. Their analysis can reveal information about phenomena like the formation of the Solar System.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Natalie | last = Starkey | title = Your House is Full of Space Dust – It Reveals the Solar System's Story | date = 22 November 2013 | url = http://www.space.com/23712-your-house-is-full-of-space-dust-it-reveals-the-solar-system-s-story.html | work = Space.com | accessdate = 2014-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, cosmic dust can drive the mass loss when a [[star]] is [[Stellar evolution#The later years and death of stars|nearing the end of its life]], play a part in the early stages of [[star formation]], and form [[planet]]s. In the [[Solar System]], dust plays a major role in the [[zodiacal light]], [[Saturn]]'s [[B Ring]] [[spokes]], the outer diffuse [[planetary ring]]s at [[Jupiter]], Saturn, [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]], and [[comet]]s.
[[File:Three Bands of Light.jpg|thumb|left|[[Zodiacal light]] caused by cosmic dust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Three Bands of Light|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1614a/|accessdate=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[interdisciplinary]] study of dust brings together different scientific fields: [[physics]] ([[solid state physics|solid-state]], [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic theory]], surface physics, [[statistical physics]], [[thermal physics]]), [[fractal mathematics]], [[surface chemistry]] on dust grains) [[meteoritics]], as well as every branch of [[astronomy]] and [[astrophysics]].&lt;ref name="Grün"&gt;{{cite book|author=Eberhard Grün|title=Interplanetary dust|date= 2001|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=3-540-42067-3|url=https://books.google.com/?id=iWRKx_QulUcC&amp;pg=PA333&amp;dq=astronomy++pressure+interplanetary}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These disparate research areas can be linked by the following theme: the cosmic dust particles evolve cyclically; chemically, physically and dynamically. The evolution of dust traces out paths in which the Universe recycles material, in processes analogous to the daily recycling steps with which many people are familiar: production, storage, processing, collection, consumption, and discarding. 

Observations and measurements of cosmic dust in different regions provide an important insight into the Universe's recycling processes; in the clouds of the diffuse [[interstellar medium]], in [[molecular cloud]]s, in the [[circumstellar dust]] of [[young stellar object]]s, and in [[planetary systems]] such as the [[Solar System]], where astronomers consider dust as in its most recycled state. The astronomers accumulate observational ‘snapshots’ of dust at different stages of its life and, over time, form a more complete movie of the Universe's complicated recycling steps.

Parameters such as the particle's initial motion, material properties, intervening [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] and [[magnetic field]] determined the dust particle's arrival at the dust detector. Slightly changing any of these parameters can give significantly different dust dynamical behavior. Therefore, one can learn about where that object came from, and what is (in) the intervening medium.

== Detection methods ==
[[File:Andromeda galaxy Ssc2005-20a1.jpg|thumb|250px|Cosmic dust of the [[Andromeda Galaxy]] as revealed in infrared light by the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]].]]

Cosmic dust can be detected by indirect methods that utilize the [[Electromagnetic radiation|radiative]] properties of the cosmic dust particles.

Cosmic dust can also be detected directly ('in-situ') using a variety of collection methods and from a variety of collection locations. Estimates of the daily influx of extraterrestrial material entering the Earth's atmosphere range between 5 and 300 tonnes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

[[NASA]] collects samples of star dust particles in the Earth's atmosphere using plate collectors under the wings of stratospheric-flying [[airplane]]s. Dust samples are also collected from surface deposits on the large Earth ice-masses (Antarctica and Greenland/the Arctic) and in deep-sea sediments.

[[Donald E. Brownlee|Don Brownlee]] at the [[University of Washington]] in Seattle first reliably identified the extraterrestrial nature of collected dust particles in the latter 1970s. Another source is the [[meteorite]]s, which contain [[#Stardust|stardust]] extracted from them. Stardust grains are solid refractory pieces of individual presolar stars. They are recognized by their extreme isotopic compositions, which can only be isotopic compositions within evolved stars, prior to any mixing with the interstellar medium. These grains condensed from the stellar matter as it cooled while leaving the star.

[[File:Horsehead-Hubble.jpg|thumb|left|Cosmic dust of the [[Horsehead Nebula]] as revealed by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]].]]

In interplanetary space, dust detectors on planetary spacecraft have been built and flown, some are presently flying, and more are presently being built to fly. The large orbital velocities of dust particles in interplanetary space (typically 10–40&amp;nbsp;km/s) make intact particle capture problematic. Instead, in-situ dust detectors are generally devised to measure parameters associated with the high-velocity impact of dust particles on the instrument, and then derive physical properties of the particles (usually mass and velocity) through laboratory calibration (i.e. impacting accelerated particles with known properties onto a laboratory replica of the dust detector). Over the years dust detectors have measured, among others, the impact light flash, acoustic signal and impact ionisation. Recently the dust instrument on [[Stardust Mission|Stardust]] captured particles intact in low-density [[aerogel]].

Dust detectors in the past flew on the [[HEOS-2]], ''[[Helios (spacecraft)|Helios]]'', ''[[Pioneer 10]]'', ''[[Pioneer 11]]'', ''[[Giotto (spacecraft)|Giotto]]'', and ''[[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]]'' space missions, on the Earth-orbiting [[LDEF]], [[European Retrievable Carrier|EURECA]], and Gorid satellites, and some scientists have utilized the ''[[Voyager 1]]'' and ''[[Voyager 2|2]]'' spacecraft as giant [[Langmuir probe]]s to directly sample the cosmic dust. Presently dust detectors are flying on the ''[[Ulysses (spacecraft)|Ulysses]]'', ''[[Cassini–Huygens|Cassini]]'', [[PROBA|Proba]], ''[[Rosetta (spacecraft)|Rosetta]]'', ''[[Stardust (spacecraft)|Stardust]]'', and the ''[[New Horizons]]'' spacecraft. The collected dust at Earth or collected further in space and returned by sample-return space missions is then analyzed by dust scientists in their respective laboratories all over the world. One large storage facility for cosmic dust exists at the NASA Houston JSC.

Infrared light can penetrate the cosmic dust clouds, allowing us to peer into regions of star formation and the centers of galaxies. [[NASA]]'s [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] is the largest infrared telescope ever launched into space. The Spitzer Space Telescope (formerly SIRTF, the Space Infrared Telescope Facility) was launched into space by a Delta rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida on 25 August 2003. During its mission, Spitzer will obtain images and spectra by detecting the infrared energy, or heat, radiated by objects in space between wavelengths of 3 and 180 micrometres. Most of this infrared radiation is blocked by the Earth's atmosphere and cannot be observed from the ground. The findings from the Spitzer already revitalized the studies of cosmic dust. A recent report from a Spitzer team shows some evidence that cosmic dust is formed near a supermassive black hole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=F.|last=Markwick-Kemper|author2=Gallagher, S.

Another detection mechanism is polarimetry. Dust grains are not spherical and tend to align to interstellar magnetic fields, preferentially polarising starlight that passes through dust clouds. In nearby interstellar space, where cosmic reddening is not sensitive enough to be detected, high precision optical polarimetry has been used to glean the structure of dust within the [[Local Bubble]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The linear polarization of Southern bright stars measured at the parts-per-million level | last=Cotton | first=D.

==Radiative properties==
[[File:A glowing jet from a young star.tif|thumb|[[HH 151]] is a bright jet of glowing material trailed by an intricate, orange-hued plume of gas and dust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A glowing jet from a young star|url=http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/potw1307a/|accessdate=19 February 2013|newspaper=ESA/Hubble Picture of the Week}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

A dust particle interacts with [[electromagnetic radiation]] in a way that depends on its [[cross section (geometry)|cross section]], the [[wavelength]] of the electromagnetic radiation, and on the nature of the grain: its [[refractive index]], size, etc. The radiation process for an individual grain is called its ''[[emissivity]]'', dependent on the grain's ''efficiency factor''. Furthermore, we have to specify whether the emissivity process is [[Extinction (astronomy)|extinction]], [[scattering]], [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]], or [[polarization (waves)|polarisation]]. In the radiation emission curves, several important signatures identify the composition of the emitting or absorbing dust particles.

Dust particles can scatter light nonuniformly. Forward-scattered light means that light is redirected slightly by [[diffraction]] off its path from the star/sunlight, and back-scattered light is reflected light.

The scattering and extinction ("dimming") of the radiation gives useful information about the dust grain sizes. For example, if the object(s) in one's data is many times brighter in forward-scattered visible light than in back-scattered visible light, then we know that a significant fraction of the particles are about a micrometer in diameter.

The scattering of light from dust grains in long exposure visible photographs is quite noticeable in [[reflection nebula]]e, and gives clues about the individual particle's light-scattering properties. In X-ray wavelengths, many scientists are investigating the scattering of X-rays by interstellar dust, and some have suggested that [[Astrophysical X-ray source|astronomical X-ray sources]] would possess diffuse haloes, due to the dust.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{cite journal|author=Smith RK|author2=Edgar RJ|author3=Shafer RA|title=The X-ray halo of GX 13+1|journal=Astrophys.

Stardust was a component of the dust in the interstellar medium before its incorporation into meteorites. The meteorites have stored those stardust grains ever since the meteorites first assembled within the [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System#Formation|planetary accretion disk]] more than four billion years ago. So-called [[carbonaceous chondrite]]s are especially fertile reservoirs of stardust. Each stardust grain existed before the Earth was formed. ''Stardust'' is a scientific term referring to refractory dust grains that condensed from cooling ejected gases from individual presolar stars and incorporated into the cloud from which the Solar System condensed.&lt;ref&gt;Donald D. Clayton,  Precondensed Matter: Key to the Early Solar System, Moon &amp; Planets 19, 109 (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

Many different types of stardust have been identified by laboratory measurements of the highly unusual isotopic composition of the chemical elements that comprise each stardust grain. These refractory mineral grains may earlier have been coated with volatile compounds, but those are lost in the dissolving of meteorite matter in acids, leaving only insoluble refractory minerals. Finding the grain cores without dissolving most of the meteorite has been possible, but difficult and labor-intensive (see [[presolar grains]]).

Many new aspects of [[nucleosynthesis]] have been discovered from the isotopic ratios within the stardust grains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=D. D. Clayton|author2=L. R. Nittler|last-author-amp=yes|title=Astrophysics with Presolar Stardust|journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=42|date=2004|issue=1| pages=39–78|doi=10.1146/annurev.astro.42.053102.134022|bibcode=2004ARA&amp;A..42...39C}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important property of stardust is the hard, refractory, high-temperature nature of the grains. Prominent are [[silicon carbide]], [[graphite]], [[aluminium oxide]], aluminium [[spinel]], and other such solids that would condense at high temperature from a cooling gas, such as in stellar winds or in the decompression of the inside of a [[supernova]]. They differ greatly from the solids formed at low temperature within the interstellar medium.

Also important are their extreme isotopic compositions, which are expected to exist nowhere in the interstellar medium. This also suggests that the stardust condensed from the gases of individual stars before the [[isotope]]s could be diluted by mixing with the interstellar medium. These allow the source stars to be identified. For example, the heavy elements within the silicon carbide (SiC) grains are almost pure [[S-process]] isotopes, fitting their condensation within [[Asymptotic Giant Branch|AGB]] star red giant winds inasmuch as the AGB stars are the main source of S-process nucleosynthesis and have atmospheres observed by astronomers to be highly enriched in dredged-up s process elements.

Another dramatic example is given by the so-called supernova condensates, usually shortened by acronym to SUNOCON (from SUperNOva CONdensate&lt;ref&gt;D. D. Clayton, Moon and Planets 19, 109 (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;) to distinguish them from other stardust condensed within stellar atmospheres. SUNOCONs contain in their calcium an excessively large abundance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Extinct &lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;Ti in Presolar Graphite and SiC: Proof of a Supernova Origin | last1 = Nittler | first1 = L.R. | last2 = Amari | first2 = S. | last3 = Zinner | first3 = E. | last4 = Woosley | first4 = S.E. | date = 1996 | url = | journal = Astrophys.

The outflowing &lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;Ti nuclei were thus still "alive" (radioactive) when the SUNOCON condensed near one year within the expanding supernova interior, but would have become an [[extinct radionuclide]] (specifically &lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;Ca) after the time required for mixing with the interstellar gas. Its discovery proved the prediction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Clayton | first1 = Donald D. | date = 1975 | title = 22Na, Ne-E, Extinct radioactive anomalies and unsupported 40Ar | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 257 | issue = | pages = 36–37 | doi=10.1038/257036b0|bibcode = 1975Natur.257...36C }}&lt;/ref&gt; from 1975 that it might be possible to identify SUNOCONs in this way. The SiC SUNOCONs (from supernovae) are only about 1% as numerous as are SiC stardust from AGB stars.

Stardust itself (SUNOCONs and AGB grains that come from specific stars) is but a modest fraction of the condensed cosmic dust, forming less than 0.1% of the mass of total interstellar solids. The high interest in stardust derives from new information that it has brought to the sciences of [[stellar evolution]] and [[nucleosynthesis]].

Laboratories have studied solids that existed before the Earth was formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Clayton | first1 = Donald D. | date = 2000 | title = Planetary solids older than the Earth | url = | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5466| page = 619 |doi=10.1126/science.288.5466.617f }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was once thought impossible, especially in the 1970s when cosmochemists were confident that the Solar System began as a hot gas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Condensation in the primitive solar nebula | last1 = Grossman | first1 = L. | date = 1972 | url = | journal = Geochim.

The existence of stardust proved this historic picture incorrect.

==Some bulk properties==
[[File:Smooth chondriteIDP.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Smooth chondrite interplanetary dust particle.]] Cosmic dust is made of dust grains and aggregates of dust grains. These particles are irregularly shaped, with [[porosity]] ranging from ''fluffy'' to ''compact''. The composition, size, and other properties depend on where the dust is found, and conversely, a compositional analysis of a dust particle can reveal much about the dust particle's origin. General diffuse [[interstellar medium]] dust, dust grains in [[interstellar clouds|dense clouds]], [[planetary rings]] dust, and [[circumstellar dust]], are each different in their characteristics. For example, grains in dense clouds have acquired a mantle of ice and on average are larger than dust particles in the diffuse interstellar medium. ''Interplanetary dust particles'' (IDPs) are generally larger still.

[[File:IDPmajorelements.png|thumb|350px|right|Major elements of 200 stratospheric interplanetary dust particles.]]
Most of the influx of extraterrestrial matter that falls onto the Earth is dominated by meteoroids with diameters in the range 50 to 500 micrometers, of average density 2.0 g/cm³ (with porosity about 40%). The total influx rate of meteoritic sities of most IDPs [[Interplanetary dust cloud#Collecting interplanetary dust on Earth|captured]] in the Earth's [[stratosphere]] range between 1 and 3 g/cm³, with an average density at about 2.0 g/cm³.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Love S. G.|author2=Joswiak D. J.|author3=Brownlee D. E.|last-author-amp=yes|title=Densities of stratospheric micrometeorites |journal=Icarus |date=1992|volume=111| issue=1| pages=227–236|doi=10.1006/icar.1994.1142| bibcode= 1994Icar..111..227L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other specific dust properties:
*In ''circumstellar dust'', astronomers have found molecular signatures of [[Carbon monoxide|CO]], [[silicon carbide]], [[silicate|amorphous silicate]], [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]], [[ice|water ice]], and [[polyformaldehyde]], among others (in the diffuse [[interstellar medium]], there is evidence for silicate and carbon grains).
*''[[Comet dust|Cometary dust]]'' is generally different (with overlap) from ''[[asteroid dust|asteroidal dust]]''. Asteroidal dust resembles [[carbonaceous chondrite|carbonaceous chondritic meteorites]]. Cometary dust resembles [[interstellar dust|interstellar grains]] which can include silicates, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and water ice.

==Dust grain formation==
The large grains in interstellar space are probably complex, with refractory cores that condensed within stellar outflows topped by layers acquired subsequently during incursions into cold dense interstellar clouds. That cyclic process of growth and destruction outside of the clouds has been modeled&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Liffman | first1 = Kurt | last2 = Clayton | first2 = Donald D. | year = 1988 | title = Stochastic histories of refractory interstellar dust | url = | journal = Proceeding of the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 637–57 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Liffman | first1 = Kurt | last2 = Clayton | first2 = Donald D. | year = 1989 | title = Stochastic evolution of refractory interstellar dust during the chemical evolution of a two-phase interstellar medium | url = http://tigerprints.clemson.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1368&amp;context=physastro_pubs| journal = Astrophys. J. | volume = 340 | issue = | pages = 853–68 | doi=10.1086/167440 | bibcode=1989ApJ...340..853L}}&lt;/ref&gt; to demonstrate that the cores live much longer than the average lifetime of dust mass. Those cores mostly start with silicate particles condensing in the atmospheres of cool oxygen rich red-giant stars and carbon grains condensing in the atmospheres of cool [[carbon star]]s. The red-giant stars have evolved off the [[main sequence]] and have entered the [[giant star|giant]] phase of their evolution and are the major source of refractory dust grain cores in galaxies. Those refractory cores are also called Stardust (section above), which is a scientific term for the small fraction of cosmic dust that condensed thermally within stellar gases as they were ejected from the stars. Several percent of refractory grain cores have condensed within expanding interiors of supernovae, a type of cosmic decompression chamber. And meteoriticists that study this refractory stardust extracted from meteorites often call it [[presolar grains]], although the refractory stardust that they study is actually only a small fraction of all presolar dust. Stardust condenses within the stars via considerably different condensation chemistry than that of the bulk of cosmic dust, which accretes cold onto preexisting dust in dark molecular clouds of the galaxy. Those molecular clouds are very cold, typically less than 50K, so that ices of many kinds may accrete onto grains, perhaps to be destroyed later. Finally, when the Solar System formed, interstellar dust grains were further modified by chemical reactions within the planetary accretion disk. So the history of the complex grains in the early Solar System is complicated and only partially understood.

Astronomers know that the dust is formed in the envelopes of late-evolved stars from specific observational signatures. In infrared light, emission at 9.7 micrometres is a signature of silicate dust in cool evolved oxygen-rich giant stars. Emission at 11.5 micrometres indicates the presence of silicon carbide dust in cool evolved carbon-rich giant stars. These help provide evidence that the small silicate particles in space came from the ejected outer envelopes of these stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Humphreys, Roberta M.| author2=Strecker, Donald W.| author3=Ney, E. P.| title=Spectroscopic and Photometric Observations of M Supergiants in Carina| journal=Astrophysical Journal |date=1972| volume=172| pages=75| doi=10.1086/151329| bibcode=1972ApJ...172...75H}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Evans94|Evans 1994, pp. 164-167]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Conditions in interstellar space are generally not suitable for the formation of silicate cores. This would take excessive time to accomplish, even if it might be possible. The arguments are that: given an observed typical grain diameter ''a'', the time for a grain to attain ''a'', and given the temperature of interstellar gas, it would take considerably longer than the age of the Universe for interstellar grains to form.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Evans94|Evans 1994, pp. 147-148]]&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, grains are seen to have recently formed in the vicinity of nearby stars, in [[nova]] and [[supernova]] ejecta, and in [[R Coronae Borealis variable]] stars which seem to eject discrete clouds containing both gas and dust. So mass loss from stars is unquestionably where the refractory cores of grains formed.

Most dust in the [[Solar System]] is highly processed dust, recycled from the material out of which the Solar System formed and subsequently collected in the planetesimals, and leftover solid material such as [[comet]]s and [[asteroid]]s, and reformed in each of those bodies' collisional lifetimes. During the Solar System's formation history, the most abundant element was (and still is) H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The metallic elements: magnesium, silicon, and iron, which are the principal ingredients of rocky planets, condensed into solids at the highest temperatures of the planetary disk.  Some molecules such as CO, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and free oxygen, existed in a gas phase. Some molecules, for example, graphite (C) and SiC would condense into solid grains in the planetary disk; but carbon and SiC grains found in meteorites are presolar based on their isotopic compositions, rather than from the planetary disk formation. Some molecules also formed complex organic compounds and some molecules formed frozen ice mantles, of which either could coat the "refractory" (Mg, Si, Fe) grain cores. Stardust once more provides an exception to the general trend, as it appears to be totally unprocessed since its thermal condensation within stars as refractory crystalline minerals. The condensation of graphite occurs within supernova interiors as they expand and cool, and do so even in gas containing more oxygen than carbon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Clayton | first1 = Donald D. | last2 = Liu | first2 = W. | last3 = Dalgarno | first3 = A. | year = 1999 | title = Condensation of carbon in radioactive supernova gas | url = | journal = Science | volume = 283 | issue = | pages = 1290–92 | doi=10.1126/science.283.5406.1290|bibcode = 1999Sci...283.1290C }}&lt;/ref&gt; a surprising carbon chemistry made possible by the intense radioactive environment of supernovae. This special example of dust formation has merited specific review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Clayton | first1 = Donald D. | year = 2011 | title = A new astronomy with radioactivity: radiogenic carbon chemistry | url = | journal = New Astronomy Reviews | volume = 55 | issue = | pages = 155–65 | doi=10.1016/j.newar.2011.08.001|bibcode = 2011NewAR..55..155C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Planetary disk formation of precursor molecules was determined, in large part, by the temperature of the solar nebula. Since the temperature of the solar nebula decreased with heliocentric distance, scientists can infer a dust grain's origin(s) with knowledge of the grain's materials. Some materials could only have been formed at high temperatures, while other grain materials could only have been formed at much lower temperatures. The materials in a single interplanetary dust particle often show that the grain elements formed in different locations and at different times in the solar nebula. Most of the matter present in the original solar nebula has since disappeared; drawn into the Sun, expelled into interstellar space, or reprocessed, for example, as part of the planets, asteroids or comets.

Due to their highly processed nature, IDPs (interplanetary dust particles) are fine-grained mixtures of thousands to millions of mineral grains and [[amorphous]] components. We can picture an IDP as a "matrix" of material with embedded elements which were formed at different times and places in the [[solar nebula]] and before the solar nebula's formation. Examples of embedded elements in cosmic dust are [[Glass with Embedded Metal and Sulfides|GEMS]], [[chondrule]]s, and [[Calcium-Aluminum-Inclusions|CAI]]s.

==From the solar nebula to Earth==
[[File:Grapsdustytrail.jpg|thumb|400px|right|A dusty trail from the early Solar System to carbonaceous dust today.]]
The arrows in the adjacent diagram show one possible path from a collected interplanetary dust particle back to the early stages of the solar nebula.

We can follow the trail to the right in the diagram to the IDPs that contain the most volatile and primitive elements. The trail takes us first from interplanetary dust particles to chondritic interplanetary dust particles. Planetary scientists classify chondritic IDPs in terms of their diminishing degree of oxidation so that they fall into three major groups: the carbonaneous, the ordinary, and the enstatite chondrites. As the name implies, the carbonaceous chondrites are rich in carbon, and many have anomalies in the isotopic abundances of H, C, N, and O (Jessberger, 2000){{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}. From the carbonaceous chondrites, we follow the trail to the most primitive materials. They are almost completely oxidized and contain the lowest condensation temperature elements ("volatile" elements) and the largest amount of organic compounds. Therefore, dust particles with these elements are thought to be formed in the early life of the Solar System. The volatile elements have never seen temperatures above about 500 K, therefore, the IDP grain "matrix" consists of some very primitive Solar System material. Such a scenario is true in the case of comet dust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |author=Gruen, Eberhard |title=Encyclopedia of the Solar System—Interplanetary Dust and the Zodiacal Cloud |date=1999 |pages=XX}}&lt;/ref&gt; The provenance of the small fraction that is stardust (see above) is quite different; these refractory interstellar minerals thermally condense within stars, become a small component of interstellar matter, and therefore remain in the presolar planetary disk. Nuclear damage tracks are caused by the ion flux from solar flares. [[Solar wind]] ions impacting on the particle's surface produce amorphous radiation damaged rims on the particle's surface. And spallogenic nuclei are produced by galactic and solar cosmic rays. A dust particle that originates in the Kuiper Belt at 40 AU would have many more times the density of tracks, thicker amorphous rims and higher integrated doses than a dust particle originating in the main-asteroid belt.

Based on 2012 [[computer simulation|computer model studies]], the [[organic compound|complex organic molecules]] necessary for [[life]] may have formed in the [[protoplanetary disk]] of dust grains surrounding the [[Sun]] before the formation of the [[Earth]].&lt;ref name="Space-20120329"&gt;{{cite web |last=Moskowitz |first=Clara |title=Life's Building Blocks May Have Formed in Dust Around Young Sun |url=http://www.space.com/15089-life-building-blocks-young-sun-dust.html |date=29 March 2012 |publisher=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=30 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the computer studies, this same process may also occur around other [[stars]] that acquire [[planets]].&lt;ref name="Space-20120329" /&gt; (Also see [[Abiogenesis#Extraterrestrial organic molecules|Extraterrestrial organic molecules]].)

==Some "dusty" clouds in the universe==
The Solar System has its own [[interplanetary dust cloud]], as do extrasolar systems. There are different types of nebulae with different physical causes and processes: 
*[[Diffuse nebula]]
*Infrared (IR) [[reflection nebula]]
*[[Supernova remnant]]
*[[Molecular cloud]]
*[[H II region|HII region]]s
*[[Photodissociation region]]s
*[[Dark nebula]]

Distinctions between those types of nebula are that different radiation processes are at work. For example, H II regions, like the [[Orion Nebula]], where a lot of star-formation is taking place, are characterized as thermal emission nebulae. Supernova remnants, on the other hand, like the [[Crab Nebula]], are characterized as nonthermal emission ([[synchrotron radiation]]).

Some of the better known dusty regions in the Universe are the diffuse nebulae in the Messier catalog, for example: [[Crab Nebula|M1]], [[Messier 8|M8]], [[Eagle Nebula|M16]], [[Omega Nebula|M17]], [[Trifid Nebula|M20]], [[Orion Nebula|M42]], [[M43 (nebula)|M43]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/messier/Messier.html |title=Messier Catalog |accessdate=2005-07-06 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19961114190946/http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/messier/Messier.html |archivedate=November 14, 1996 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dust sample return==

The Discovery program's [[Stardust (spacecraft)|''Stardust'' mission]], was launched on 7 February 1999 to collect samples from the coma of comet [[Wild 2]], as well as samples of cosmic dust. It returned samples to Earth on 15 January 2006.  In the spring of 2014, the recovery of particles of interstellar dust from the samples was announced.&lt;ref name="nasa_sidp"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/stardust/Interstellardust.cfm | title=Stardust Interstellar Dust Particles | work= | publisher=JSC, NASA | date=2014-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Disclosing New Worlds: Entrepreneurship, Democratic Action, and the Cultivation of Solidarity''''' (1997)&lt;ref name=dnw&gt;{{cite book |title=Disclosing New Worlds: Entrepreneurship, Democratic Action, and the Cultivation of Solidarity|author1=Charles Spinosa|author2=Fernando Flores|author3=Hubert L. Dreyfus|date=1997|publisher=MIT Press USA|isbn=0-262-19381-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a philosophical proposal intended to restore or energize [[democracy]] by [[social constructionism]] via an [[argument]] style of [[world disclosure]] but which philosophy is distinct from:
*[[Relativism]] - a concept in which points of view have no absolute truth or validity.
*[[Formalism (philosophy)|Formalism]] - an emphasis on form over content or meaning in the arts, literature, or philosophy
*[[Essentialism]] - the view that, for any specific entity (such as an animal, a group of people, a physical object, a concept), there is a set of attributes which are necessary to its identity and function.

Nevertheless, the authors build on these ideas and seek to reformulate the relationship between democratic rights and economic progress when persistent  technological advance obscures an uncertain future for humanity threatened by multiple issues such as  [[peak oil]],  [[global warming]] and [[environmental degradation]]. The book is co-authored by [[Fernando Flores]],  [[Hubert Dreyfus]]  and Charles Spinosa (a consultant philosopher specializing in commercial innovation). They concentrate on three practical activities:

* [[social entrepreneurship]],
* [[active citizenship]] and
* [[solidarity|social solidarity]]

The authors reason that human beings are at their best when engaged in imaginative and practical innovation rather than in abstract reflection, and thus  challenging accepted wisdom and conventional practices within their particular environment, or as the authors claim, when they are making history. History-making, in this account, refers not to political power changes, wars or violent revolution, but to changes in the way people  understand their  personal qualities and deal with their particular situations.

==Structure of the work==
'''[[World disclosure]]''' (German: Erschlossenheit, literally development or comprehension) is a phenomenon first described by the German philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]] in his landmark book [[Being and Time]]. As well as the authors of this work, the idea of disclosing has also been discussed by philosophers such as [[John Dewey]], [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[Nikolas Kompridis]] and [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]]. It refers to how things become intelligible and meaningfully relevant to ordinary people.

==Conclusion==
The authors reiterate the importance of history making and identify thee types of actors:
* The entrepreneur
* The virtuous citizen 
* The culture figure

Each has to overcome [[resistance to change]], but do so in different ways. Solving puzzles request of each a clear [[strategy|strategic]] objective, but use different [[tactic (method)|tactic]]s to overcome obstructions. By understanding and disclosing our objectives, and discovering the sort of role we may have to play according to particular situations to reach those goals, all of us can be "history makers" and make changes to our society by changing the shared narrative that binds our particular culture. The authors quote already changed collective attitudes which have recently become much less tolerant  of road accidents, various forms of discrimination and repressive public education of young people.

They promote a change to the overarching [[consumerism]] as the western world's social and economic order and ideology that encourages the acquisition of goods and services in ever-increasing amounts, in favor of [[sustainable development]]  within individual communities as a precursor to disclosing a new world order that supports [[human equality]]

'''Drive.ai''' is an American technology company headquartered in [[Mountain View, California]] that uses [[artificial intelligence]] to make self-driving systems for cars.&lt;ref name=micdotcom/&gt; It is the second company to remove the safety driver from its autonomous vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/17/17365188/drive-ai-driverless-self-driving-car-texas| title=Fully driverless cars are on public roads in Texas| author=Andrew J. Hawkins| date=May 17, 2018| publisher=The Verge}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, the company has raised approximately $77 million in funding. Drive.ai's technology can be modified to turn a vehicle autonomous.&lt;ref name=fund&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2017/09/28/robocar-startup-drive-ai-gets-backing-from-uber-rival-grab-plans-singapore-move/#77ee1957494b| title=Robocar Startup Drive.ai Gets Backing From Uber Rival Grab, Plans Singapore Move| author=Alan Ohnsman| date=September 28, 2017| publisher=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, Drive.ai announced a pilot program in [[Frisco, Texas]] to test the company's vehicles in its first application of a passenger carrying service available to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-hy-driveai-self-driving-20180507-story.html| title=Drive.at to offer Uber-like service with self-driving vans starting in July| date=May 7, 2018| publisher=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Drive.ai was established in 2015 through [[Stanford University]]'s Artificial Intelligence Lab by a group of graduate and PhD students.&lt;ref name=first&gt;{{cite web| url= https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/30/drive-ai-uses-deep-learning-to-teach-self-driving-cars-and-to-give-them-a-voice/| title=Drive.ai uses deep learning to teach self-driving cars – and to give them a voice| author=Darrell Etherington| date=August 30, 2016| publisher=Tech Crunch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group initially worked to develop a retrofit kit to add their autonomous driving system to existing cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-bolt-on-retrofit-kit-turns-certain-cars-into-self-driving-vehicles/| title=This bolt-on retrofit kit turns certain cars into self-driving vehicles| author=Greg Nichols| date=July 5, 2017| publisher=ZDNet}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2016, the company emerged from stealth mode with $12 million in funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/30/12700290/drive-ai-autonomous-car-human-robot-interface| title=Drive.ai wants to help autonomous cars talk with the people around them| author=Jordan Golson| date=August 30, 2016| publisher=The Verge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/08/30/garage-startup-uses-deep-learning-teach-cars-drive/89424514/| title=Garage startup uses deep learning to teach cars to drive| author=Marco della Cava| date=August 30, 2016| publisher=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.recode.net/2016/9/6/12772862/self-driving-car-robot-communication| title=This self-driving startup wants to change the way robot cars make decisions and communicate| author=Johana Bhuiyan|publisher=Recode}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company's early funding included investments by Northern Light Venture Capital, Oriza Ventures and InnoSpring Seed Fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.businessinsider.com/driveai-using-deep-learning-for-its-autonomous-cars-2016-8| title=A start-up born out of Stanford just entered the driverless car race with a radical approach| author=Danielle Muoio| date=August 30, 2016| publisher=Business Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2017/02/14/drive-ai-mountain-view-self-driving-cars-video.html| title=Look, Mountain View, no hands!

== Technology ==
The company has a fleet of [[Lincoln MKZ]]s, an [[Audi A4]] and [[Nissan NV200]]s for its testing in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://qz.com/1271375/driverless-car-startup-drive-ai-is-launching-a-ride-hailing-service-in-dallas-texas/| title=Driverless car startup Drive.ai is launching a ride-hailing service in Texas| author=Alison Griswold| date=May 7, 2018| publisher=Quartz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2017, Drive.ai released the first video footage of its technology, featuring one of its self-driving Lincoln MKZ cars navigating the streets of Mountain View, CA in the rain after dark. This marked an early recording of a self-driving vehicle operating on a fully autonomous ride at night, or in inclement weather.

In May 2018, Drive.ai released a video featuring an orange Nissan NV200 driverless vehicle navigating Frisco streets. The video featured private streets as well as busy intersections and a traffic circle. It also featured a display showing the car's sensors and cameras dealing with objects on the road and highlighted operation through low-angle sunlight that would obscure typical sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/self-driving-taxi-demonstration-before-texas-launch/| title=See what it's like to take a ride in Drive.ai's self-driving taxi| author=Trevor Mogg| date=May 16, 2018| publisher=Digital Trends}}&lt;/ref&gt; The car's object recognition systems identify and route around other vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists safely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.iottechnews.com/news/2018/may/17/driveai-demonstrates-self-driving-cars/| title=Drive.ai demonstrates its self-driving cars| author=Ryan Daws| date=May 17, 2018| publisher=IoT News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drive.ai's cars include screens on the outside of the car, one on the hood, one on the back, and one on each side, to communicate with pedestrians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://techxplore.com/news/2018-05-self-driving-vehicle-frisco-texas-july.html| title=Self-driving vehicle service in Frisco, Texas, to start in July| author=Nancy Owano| date=May 19, 2018| publisher=TechXplore}}&lt;/ref&gt; The screens feature prompts such as "Passengers Entering/Exiting' or "Waiting for You to Cross."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-07/drive-ai-will-offer-uber-like-service-with-autonomous-vans-this-summer| title=Drive.ai Will Offer Uber-Like Service With Autonomous Vans This Summer| author=Ellen Huet| date=May 7, 2018| publisher=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Environmental testing''' is the measurement of the performance of equipment under specified environmental conditions, such as:

* extremely high and low temperatures
* large, swift variations in temperature
* blown and settling sand and dust
* salt spray and salt fog
* very high or low humidity
* wet environments, waterproofness, icing
* fungus, fluids susceptibility
* vibrations (airborne and structural), gun fire
* accelerations
* solar radiation
* high and low pressures (especially for aeronautical and space equipment)
* operating at angles (especially for marine, aeronautical and space equipment)
* electromagnetic interference (EMI), ESD, Lightning
* acoustic measurements
* power input variations

Such tests are most commonly performed on equipment used in military, maritime, aeronautical and space applications. See [[Environmental test chambers]] for more information about environmental testing equipment.

Environmental test standards include
* [[MIL-STD-810]], "Test Method Standard for Environmental Engineering Considerations and Laboratory Tests", presently (2010) version G, issued in 2009
* [[MIL-HDBK-2036]], "Preparation of Electronic Equipment Specifications", issued 1999
* [[IEC 60068]], "Environmental Testing", with many parts.
* [[IEC 60945]], "Maritime navigation and radiocommunication equipment and systems – General requirements – Methods of testing and required test results", issued 2002 and due for review in 2007
* [[DO-160|RTCA DO-160]], "Environmental Conditions and Test Procedures for Airborne Equipment", first published in 1975
* [[MIL-STD-461]], "Department of Defense Interface Standard: Requirements for the Control of Electromagnetic Interference Characteristics of Subsystems and Equipment (10 DEC 2007)", presently version F.

An '''epistemic community''' is a transnational [[business networking|network]] of knowledge-based [[experts]] who help decision-makers to define the problems they face, identify various [[policy]] solutions and assess the policy outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hsu|first=Jennifer Y. J.|last2=Hasmath|first2=Reza|date=2017|title=A Maturing Civil Society in China? The Role of Knowledge and Professionalization in the Development of NGOs|ssrn=2563696|journal=China Information|location=|publisher=|volume=31|pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definitive [[conceptual framework]] of an epistemic community is widely accepted as that of [[Peter M. Haas]]. He describes them as &lt;blockquote&gt;
"...a network of professionals with recognised expertise and competence in a particular domain and an authoritative claim to policy relevant knowledge within that domain or issue-area."&lt;ref name="haas 1992"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haas |first=Peter M.|authorlink=Peter M. Haas|title=Introduction: epistemic communities and international policy coordination|journal=[[International Organization]], special issue: Knowledge, Power, and International Policy Coordination|volume=46|issue=1|pages=1–35|publisher =[[Cambridge University Press|Cambridge Journals]] |doi=10.1017/S0020818300001442|jstor=2706951|date= Winter 1992|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0020818300001442 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Although the members of an epistemic community may originate from a variety of academic or professional backgrounds, they are linked by a set of unifying characteristics&lt;ref name="haas 1992"/&gt; for the promotion of collective amelioration and not collective gain.&lt;ref name="sebenius 1992"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sebenius|first=James K.|title=Challenging conventional explanations of international cooperation: negotiation analysis and the case of epistemic communities|journal=[[International Organization]]|volume=46|issue=1|pages=323–365|publisher =[[Cambridge University Press|Cambridge Journals]] |doi=10.1017/S0020818300001521|date= Winter 1992|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0020818300001521 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is termed their "normative component".&lt;ref name="haas 1992"/&gt; In the big picture, epistemic communities are socio-psychological entities that create and justify knowledge. Such communities can constitute of only two persons and yet gain an important role in building knowledge on any specific subject. Miika Vähämaa has recently suggested that epistemic communities consist of persons being able to understand, discuss and gain self-esteem concerning the matters being discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Vähämaa | first = Miika | title = Groups as epistemic communities: social forces and affect as antecedents to knowledge | journal = [[Social Epistemology (journal)|Social Epistemology]] | volume = 27 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–20 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/02691728.2012.760660 | date = January 2013 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02691728.2012.760660 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}

Some theorists argue that an epistemic community may consist of those who accept one version of a story, or one version of validating a story. [[Michel Foucault]] referred more elaborately to [[Mathesis (philosophy)|mathesis]] as a rigorous [[episteme]] suitable for enabling cohesion of a [[discourse]] and thus uniting a community of its followers.  In [[philosophy of science]] and [[systems science]] the process of forming a self-maintaining epistemic community is sometimes called a [[mindset]].  In [[politics]], a tendency or [[Political factions|faction]] is usually described in very similar terms.

Most researchers carefully distinguish between epistemic forms of community and "real" or "bodily" [[community]] which consists of people sharing [[risk]], especially bodily risk.

It is also problematic to draw the line between modern ideas and more ancient ones, for example, [[Joseph Campbell]]'s concept of [[mythology|myth]] from [[cultural anthropology]], and [[Carl Jung]]'s concept of [[archetype]] in [[psychology]]. Some consider forming an epistemic community a deep human need, and ultimately a mythical or even religious obligation. Among these very notably are [[E. O. Wilson]], as well as [[Ellen Dissanayake]], an American historian of [[aesthetics]] who famously argued that almost all of our broadly shared [[conceptual metaphor]]s centre on one basic idea of safety: that of "home".

From this view, an epistemic community may be seen as a group of people who do not have any specific history together, but search for a common idea of home as if forming an [[intentional community]].  For example, an epistemic community can be found in a network of professionals from a wide variety of disciplines and backgrounds.&lt;ref name="reinalda184"&gt;{{citation | last = Verdun | first = Amy | contribution = The increase influence of EU monetary institutions in determining national policies: a transnational monetary elite at work | editor-last1 = Reinalda | editor-first1 = Bob | editor-last2 = Verbeek | editor-first2 = Bertjan | title = Autonomous policy making by international organizations | page = 184 | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 1998 | series = Routledge/ECPR Studies in European Political Science Series | isbn = 9780415164863 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As discussed in Peter M. Haas's definitive text,&lt;ref name="haas 1992"/&gt; an epistemic community is made up of a diverse range of academic and professional experts, who are allied on the basis of four unifying characteristics:

# a ''shared set of normative and principled beliefs'' which provide a value-based rationale for the social action of community members; 
# ''shared causal beliefs'' which are derived from their analysis of practices leading or contributing to a central set of problems in their domain and which then serve as the basis for elucidating the multiple linkages between possible policy actions and desired outcomes;
# ''shared notions of validity'', i.e. intersubjective, internally defined criteria for weighing and validating knowledge in the domain of their expertise; and
# a ''common policy enterprise'', or a set of common practices associated with a set of problems to which their professional competence is directed, presumably out of the conviction that human welfare will be enhanced as a consequence.

Thus, when viewed as an epistemic community, the overall enterprise of the expert members emerges as the product of a combination of shared beliefs and more subtle conformity pressures, rather than a direct drive for concurrence (Michael J. Mazarr). Epistemic communities also have a "normative component" meaning the end goal is always for the betterment of society, rather than self gain of the community itself (Peter M. Haas).

In international relations and political science, an [[Epistemic community (international relations)|epistemic community]] can also be referred to as a global network of knowledge-based professionals in scientific and technological areas that often affect policy decisions.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Morin, Jean-Frédéric, Louafi, Sélim, Orsini Amandine and Mohamed Oubenal, Boundary organizations in regime complexes: a social network profile of IPBES, Journal of International Relations and Development, 2016, http://www.chaire-epi.ulaval.ca/sites/chaire-epi.ulaval.ca/files/publications/morin_et_al._2016_ipbes.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in Environmental Governance==
The global environmental agenda is increasing in [[complexity]] and [[interconnectivity|interconnectedness]].&lt;ref name="haas 1992"/&gt; Often environmental policymakers do not understand the technical aspects of the issues they are regulating.&lt;ref name="haas 1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haas|first=Peter M.|authorlink=Peter M. Haas|title=Obtaining international environmental protection through epistemic consensus|journal=Millennium Journal of International Studies|volume=19|issue=3|pages=347–363|publisher =[[Sage Publications|Sage]] |doi=10.1177/03058298900190030401|date= December 1990|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/03058298900190030401 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; This affects their ability to define state interests and develop suitable solutions within cross-boundary [[environmental regulation]].&lt;ref name="litfin 2000"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Litfin | first = Karen T. | title = Environment, wealth, and authority: global climate change and emerging modes of legitimation | journal = [[International Studies Review]], special issue: Continuity and Change in the Westphalian Order | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 119–148 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/1521-9488.00207 | jstor = 3186430 | date = Summer 2000 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1521-9488.00207 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, conditions of [[uncertainty]] are produced which stimulate a demand for new information.&lt;ref name="zito2001a"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Zito | first = Anthony R. | title = Epistemic communities, collective entrepreneurship and European integration | journal = [[Journal of European Public Policy]] | volume = 8 | issue = 4 | pages = 585–603 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/13501760110064401 | date = January 2001 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13501760110064401 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental [[crises]] play a significant role in exacerbating conditions of uncertainty for decision-makers.&lt;ref name="haas 1992"/&gt; Political elites seek expert knowledge and advice to reduce this technical uncertainty, on issues including:
* the scale of environmental problems,
* cause-and-effect interrelations of ecological processes, and
* how ([[science]]-based) policy options will play out.&lt;ref name="meijerink 2005"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Meijerink | first = Sander | title = Understanding policy stability and change. the interplay of advocacy coalitions and epistemic communities, windows of opportunity, and Dutch coastal flooding policy 1945–2003 | journal = [[Journal of European Public Policy]] | volume = 12 | issue = 6 | pages = 1060–1077 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/13501760500270745 | date = December 2005 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13501760500270745 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, epistemic communities can frame environmental problems as they see fit, and environmental decision-makers begin to make policy-shaping decisions based on these specific depictions.&lt;ref name="zito 2001b"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Zito | first = Anthony R. | title = Epistemic communities, European Union governance and the public voice | journal = Science and Public Policy | volume = 28 | issue = 6 | pages = 465–476 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press|Oxford Journals]] | doi = 10.3152/147154301781781183 | date = December 2001 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.3152/147154301781781183 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial identification and bounding of environmental issues by epistemic community members is very influential.&lt;ref name="toke 1999"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Toke | first = Dave | title = Epistemic communities and environmental groups | journal = Politics | volume = 19 | issue = 2 | pages = 97–102 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/1467-9256.00091 | date = May 1999 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1467-9256.00091 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can limit what would be preferable in terms of national interests, frame what issues are available for collective debate, and delimit the policy alternatives deemed possible.&lt;ref name="haas 1990"/&gt; The political effects are not easily reversible.&lt;ref name="adler and haas 1992"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Adler| first1=Emanuel|last2=Haas|first2=Peter M.|authorlink2=Peter M. Haas|title=Conclusion: epistemic communities, world order, and the creation of a reflective research program|journal=[[International Organization]], special issue: Knowledge, Power, and International Policy Coordination|volume=46|issue=1|pages=367–390|publisher =[[Cambridge University Press|Cambridge Journals]] |doi=10.1017/S0020818300001533|jstor=2706960|date= Winter 1992|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0020818300001533 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The epistemic community vision is institutionalised as a collective set of understandings reflected in any subsequent policy choices.&lt;ref name="adler and haas 1992"/&gt;

This is a key point of power. Policy actors are persuaded to conform to the community’s consensual, knowledge-driven ideas without the epistemic community requiring a more material form of power.&lt;ref name="haas 1992"/&gt; Members of successful communities can become strong actors at the national and international level as decision-makers attach responsibility to their advice.&lt;ref name="haas 1992"/&gt;

As a result, epistemic communities have a direct input on how international cooperation may develop in the long term.&lt;ref name="haas 1990"/&gt; Transboundary environmental problems require a unified response rather than patchwork policy efforts, but this is problematic due to enduring differences of state interest and concerns over reciprocity.&lt;ref name="haas 1992"/&gt; The transnational nature of epistemic communities means numerous states may absorb new patterns of logic and behaviour, leading to the adoption of concordant state policies.&lt;ref name="haas 1990"/&gt; Therefore, the likelihood of convergent state behaviour and associated international coordination is increased.

International cooperation is further facilitated if powerful states are involved, as a quasi-structure is created containing the reasons, expectations and arguments for coordination.&lt;ref name="adler and haas 1992"/&gt; Also, if epistemic community members have developed authoritative bureaucratic reputations in various countries, they are likely to participate in the creation and running of national and international institutions that directly pursue international policy coordination, for example, a [[regulatory agency]], [[think tank]] or governmental research body.&lt;ref name="haas 1992"/&gt;

As a result, epistemic community members in a number of different countries can become connected through intergovernmental channels, as well as existing community channels, producing a [[transnational governance]] network, and facilitating the promotion of international policy coordination. An example of a scientific epistemic community in action is the 1975 collectively negotiated Mediterranean Action Plan (MAP), a marine [[pollution control]] regime for the [[Mediterranean Sea]] developed by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]].&lt;ref name="haas 1989"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haas |first=Peter M.|authorlink=Peter M.

'''Erosion control''' is the practice of preventing or controlling wind or water [[erosion]] in [[agriculture]], [[land development]], [[coast|coastal areas]], [[Bank (geography)|river banks]] and [[construction]]. Effective erosion controls handle [[surface runoff]] and are important techniques in preventing [[water pollution]], [[soil erosion|soil loss]], wildlife [[habitat loss]] and human [[property]] loss.

==Usage==
Erosion controls are used in natural areas, agricultural settings or urban environments. In urban areas erosion controls are often part of [[stormwater]] runoff management programs required by local governments. The controls often involve the creation of a physical barrier, such as vegetation or rock, to absorb some of the energy of the wind or water that is causing the erosion. They also involve building and maintaining [[storm drain]]s. On construction sites they are often implemented in conjunction with [[sediment control]]s such as [[sediment basin]]s and [[silt fence]]s.

[[Bank erosion]] is a natural process: without it, rivers would not meander and change course. However, land management patterns that change the hydrograph and/or vegetation cover can act to increase or decrease channel migration rates. In many places, whether or not the banks are unstable due to human activities, people try to keep a river in a single place. This can be done for environmental reclamation or to prevent a river from changing course into land that is being used by people. One way that this is done is by placing riprap or gabions along the bank.

==Examples==
Examples of erosion control methods include:

==Mathematical modeling==
Since the 1920s and 1930s&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Horton. 1933&lt;/ref&gt; scientists have been creating [[mathematical model]]s for understanding the mechanisms of soil erosion and resulting sediment [[surface runoff]], including an early paper by [[Albert Einstein]] applying [[Baer's law]].&lt;ref&gt;Albert Einstein. 1926&lt;/ref&gt; These models have addressed both gully and sheet erosion. Earliest models were a simple set of linked equations which could be employed by manual calculation. By the 1970s the models had expanded to complex [[computer model]]s addressing [[nonpoint source pollution]] with thousands of lines of computer code.&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan, Leda Patmore, Gary Latshaw, Harry Seidman et al. 1973&lt;/ref&gt; The more complex models were able to address nuances in micrometeorology, soil particle size distributions and micro-terrain variation.

'''Erwin Neutzsky-Wulff''' (born 24 November 1949) is a Danish author and philosopher who has published within the genres of science fiction, science, [[Horror fiction|horror]], [[prose]] and non-fiction.

== Life ==
Neutzsky-Wulff is the son of [[Aage Neutzsky-Wulff]] (1891–1967). His half-sister [[Vita Andersen]] is known for her poetry and fiction.

Neutzsky-Wulff attended courses in philosophy at the [[University of Copenhagen]], but broke off his studies after his first year. Having lived in [[Copenhagen]] all of his life, he moved into an abandoned school in [[Vinstrup]] north of [[Randers]] with his wife, where he presently spends his time expanding his authorship. He occasionally holds courses on themes drawn from extensive interests.

== Competencies and influence ==
Neutzsky-Wulff has written in both fiction and non-fiction, on subjects as diverse as history, philosophy, [[cognition]], religion, the [[occult]], [[psychology]] and [[horror fiction]]. He also authored a number of books on [[computer programming]] during the 1980s. He is mainly self-taught and has mastered several languages, including [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Latin]], German, French, English and the [[North Germanic languages|Nordic languages]].

== Activities and interests ==
Neutzsky-Wulff keeps in touch with his readers through his fan magazine ''Bathos''{{Ref label|Bathos|2}} and his official home page. ''[[Bathos]]'', in addition to offering reviews of mainly old [[horror film]]s, also contains in-depth articles on philosophy, religion, culture and various [[esoteric]] subjects. In addition, the magazine expounds on the author's philosophy and on various themes in his literature.

== Works ==
In his earliest published literature, Erwin Neutzsky-Wulff builds up his own literary universe. The ''[[Dialog om det 21. århundredes to vigtigste verdenssystemer]]{{Ref label|Dialogue|3}}'', (1971), is a philosophical [[dialogue]] modelled on the classical style of [[Galileo Galilei]]'s [[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems]]. The plot is set in a not too distant future, where a Danish civil war has broken out. The reader is witnessing a debate between three persons, one representing a new [[humanistic]] view on mankind and its new ideology (or anti-ideology), called ''[[Wulffianism]]''. ''Wulffianism'' is [[anarchism|anarchic]] in the word's real sense, entailing an accept of violence as a mean and denial of modern civilization. This, as expected, caused severe public controversy.{{Ref label|Controversy|4}} Other books from this early period of the authorship are anthologies of essays and poems, and mainly appear as supplements to the mentioned [[dialogue]]s. All of Neutzsky-Wulff's poetry is in [[rhymed|rhyme]], [[Metre (poetry)|metrical]] with a touch of subtle [[pastiche]].

With the [[episodic novel]] ''[[Adam Harts Opdagelser]]'' &lt;'''5'''&gt; (1972), Neutzsky-Wulff began to find his style and obtained henceforth crowds of fans. The book's protagonists are Adam Hart and his partner Victor Janis, both working as "[[occult detective]]s". An ironically rendered Neutzsky-Wulff himself also appears in a more secondary role. The series continues with the episodic ''[[Adam Hart og sjælemaskinen]]'' &lt;'''6'''&gt; (1977) ''[[Victor Janis og søn]]'' &lt;'''7'''&gt; (1977), both representing a more conventional novel structure, and ends with an experimental novel, ''[[Oiufael]]'' (1977), mainly written on verse. An episode from ''[[Adam Hart og sjælemaskinen]]'' was adapted as the short film ''[[Adam Hart i Sahara]]'' (1990), based on his own screenplay.

Though sometimes he breaks the traditional conventions of the [[genre]], Neutzsky-Wulff sees himself as an author of science fiction. He emphasizes the genre as the most prominent stage of artistic interpretations of the mythology of our time. ''[[Anno Domini]]'' (1975) tells the story of an astronaut on a strange planet, experiencing a [[macrohistorical]] version of the evolution of humankind. In ''[[Gud (novel)|Gud]]'' &lt;'''8'''&gt; (1976), the classical form of science fiction itself, is challenged: A group of people are, by means of an alien vessel, heading towards the planet of God. With ''[[Den 33. marts]]'' &lt;'''9'''&gt; (1977), the plot is altered from ''outer'' to "''inner space''", a platform resembling that of an American author of science fiction, [[Philip K. Dick]]. A person living in the 1970s Copenhagen discovers effects of society as mere stage equipment. Library books are empty and he is trapped within city borders. In a [[sanatorium|sanitarium]], this person "[[hallucinates]]" about another world where he features as an awaited [[Messiah]]. ''[[Havet]]'' &lt;'''10'''&gt; (1978) is, like ''Anno Domini'' and ''Gud'', a novel about [[Spaceflight|space travel]]. The supernatural setting pivots around the [[Tarot cards|cards of Tarok]]. In ''[[Menneske]]'' &lt;'''11'''&gt; (1982), a computer independently achieves consciousness and decides to find out what existence as a [[human being]] is like. Consequently, it embarks on a [[stone age]] [[odyssey]], following the history of man, ending in a [[parody]] of the 1970s of Denmark.

=== Demons and computers ===
Erwin Neutzsky-Wulff describes by novel form esoteric initiation and demonic possession in ''[[Indsigtens sted]]'' &lt;'''12'''&gt; (1980). The narration is set through a schoolteacher's diary as he is experiencing increasingly interest in the occult. This is an effective horror story which distinguishes itself from his other books. For Neutzsky-Wulff, the eighties were to stand under the parole of prose. Neutzsky-Wulff had taught himself computer programming and when the first [[home computer]]s entered the market, he published an introductory manual, ''[[Mikrodatamaten]] – Programmering og anvendelse'' (1982), followed by several similar guides the following years. At the time, computer programming was still seen as an intellectual pursuit in a rather anti-intellectual climate.

His prosaic studies of the supernatural followed with ''[[Okkultisme]]'' &lt;'''13'''&gt; (1985) and ''[[Magi]]'' &lt;'''14'''&gt; (1986). ''Okkultisme'' raises its groundwork from epistemology, modern physics and neurology, as well as interpretations of visionary [[lyrics]], for instance [[William Blake]]'s. The book's second part gives an historical briefing on the [[history of religion]]s, from [[tribe|tribal]] religion through [[Judaism]] and Christianity, to [[Satanism]]. "Satanism" is in Neutzsky-Wulff's authorship used partly as a common denominator of a quite specific group, and partly as a philosophical term for the ideology of modern society. This ideology is, as explained, essentially [[anti-Christian]].

''Magi'' treats themes such as the supernatural, its practice, supernatural experiences and the citizens of the world beyond ours. Our present day civilization is depicted evil to an extent that hatred is given as the primary human condition (p.&amp;nbsp;222). ''Magi'' was followed by ''[[Oprindelse]]'' &lt;'''15'''&gt; (1988), the first and only volume of an abortive world history, covering a time line from the [[Big Bang]] until app. 2700 BC.

''[[Faust]]'', (1989) resembles, by structure and form, to a certain point the earlier "Den 33. marts". Neutzsky-Wulff's modern [[Faust]] is not a theologian, but rather a [[psychoanalyst]] who defies his discipline. On 20 August 1989, Erwin Neutzsky-Wulff preached at [[:da:Hellig Kors Kirke|Hellig Kors Kirke]], a church in central Copenhagen, declaring that Christianity had come to an end.

=== Brick novels ===
In Neutzsky-Wulff's authorship the traditional novel form now appears to be cracking, as his novels grow in size and are thoroughly embedded with several subplots parallel to the main story. Furthermore, they attain a more objective form and prosaic essence, which provides his [[ontological platform]] with deeper insights. Also the author himself becomes [[omnipresent]], frequently either commenting on fictional actions or directly addressing the reader. [[2000 (novel)|2000]] (1991) is a science fictional [[Decameron]], where a handful of persons are isolated and share information between themselves. Around them, civilization deteriorates and a brand new kind of [[humankind|human]] is born. In the epic ''Verden'' &lt;'''16'''&gt; (1994), Neutzsky-Wulff includes time travels and similar phenomena, as he tries to delete Christ from history. Døden &lt;'''17'''&gt; (1996), distinguishes itself from other novels by its political main theme, especially the 1990s' emerging [[chauvinist]] and [[neofascist]] tendencies. This novel attracted public spotlights, as the dissolution of the journal [[Faklen]] caused a public dispute between its editors. Neutzsky-Wulff himself added yet another creation to his authorship with ''[[UFO]]'' (1999). ''UFO'' enhances his science fiction-novels of the 70s by reviewing the occult and mythological foundations of the UFO-phenomenon. In between his novel writing, Neutzsky-Wulff translated [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], which was published as ''[[For længe siden]]'' &lt;'''19'''&gt; (2000). In his ''[[Abattoir]]'' &lt;'''20'''&gt; (2003), he returns to his lighter style, reminiscent of the Adam Hart series.

=== A modern grimoire ===
[[Transcendence (philosophy)|Transcend]]ent ambitions forges the massive arguments appearing in Rum &lt;'''21'''&gt; (2001), his greatest fictional work to date, and the prose work ''[[Det overnaturlige]]'' &lt;'''22'''&gt; (2004) expounding on the essence and forms of religious experience and reality itself, treating much the same topics as the earlier ''Okkultisme'' and ''Magi'', only now in much more depth. These parallel works fulfil these ambitions fully from two different holds.

The heavy ''Rum'' is illustrated with a deliberate "bad taste" by [[Jørgen Bitsch]]. The plot is set in separated rooms: A girl selling herself as a [[sex slave]], a man in a bunker after a [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]], an expedition to an [[alien planet]], a [[haunted house]] investigator and finally, a poet not knowing he is an inspirational source for a [[mass murderer]]. These rooms can be thought of as [[:wikt:interlink|interlinked]]: They are books read by the man in the bunker or visions seen by the slave girl etc. Neutzsky-Wulff and his wife also appear. Later, the characters exchange locations. Reality constrains itself to self-created rooms and the apparently incoherent action is deliberately supposed to influence the reader to assume a [[Magic (paranormal)|magical]] way of thinking. It is an abyssal book, hardly fully comprehensible by any but a few.

The prose ''Det overnaturlige'', more or less exact than ''Okkultisme'' and ''Magi'', is at the same time meant to displace them by writing a modern [[grimoire]]. It is information-dense, cut to the bone and indirectly demands that the reader study a number of texts only referred to in the book to properly understand it. The book describes the [[mysticism|mystic]] initiation, a radical practice requiring women to be sexually [[Slavery|enslaved]] (as in ''Rum''), whereas men have to undergo a kind of virtual [[castration]]. Themes as diverse as [[kabbalah]], the mystic traditions of the [[Holy Grail]], [[Gnosticism]], [[fairy tales]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s [[The Magic Flute]] and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] are treated in depth.

=== Critique ===
Neutzsky-Wulff's books are quite unlike most contemporary Danish literature and can read like the texts of a strange, foreign religion at times. Time has shown that critics have a tendency to either praise them wholeheartedly or else distance themselves from them.

'''Figure/Ground''' is an open-source, para-academic, inter-disciplinary website which publishes in-depth interviews with scholars, researchers, and university professors, as well as artists, filmmakers, and creators of every stripe. Figure/Ground was a finalist in 2012 [[Canadian Online Publishing Awards]] and the 2013 [[Edublog Award]]s, and received the 2012 [[New Canadian Weblog Award]] (education category) as well as the 2013 [[John Culkin Award]] for outstanding praxis by the [[Media Ecology Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Awards|url=http://figureground.org/support-us/|website=Figure/Ground|accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Figure/Ground began as a personal blog founded by [[Laureano Ralón]] in 2009. It claims to contain one of the largest collections of scholarly interviews on the web, with numerous volunteer collaborators ranging from senior undergraduates to PhD candidates. 

==Mission==
According to the About page in the website: 

Figure/Ground sits on the edges of the academy and the art world; our aim is to bring the voices of academics and artists out of their specialized domains of practice and give them a venue for speaking frankly to the public at large.
Conversation is one of the most basic forms of human communication, yet the interview is a deeply undervalued genre within academic discourse. The majority of [[peer-reviewed journal]]s in the humanities and social sciences publish mostly essays and book reviews. In an age of digital interactive media, we believe the interview genre can serve as a powerful pedagogic tool and as a primary source for the production of new knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://figureground.org/about-fg/|website=Figure/Ground|accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3646">'''Floating population''' is a terminology used to describe a group of people who reside in a given population for a certain amount of time and for various reasons, but are not generally considered part of the official census count.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Francesco Sisci|title=China's Achilles' heel: The 'floating population'|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/EE17Ad01.html|newspaper=Asia Times Online Co, Ltd.|date=May 17, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[population]] is usually broken down into two categories—the residents, who permanently stay in an area for a considerable amount of time and are part of the official [[population census|population count]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Doris Fischer|title=China im Zeichen von Globalisierung und Entwicklung|year=2002|publisher=Duncker &amp; Humblot|pages=100|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qEIOIgl5GXUC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;dq=floating+population+definition&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Z2hrb8fVey&amp;sig=m7mYBLvJZE68jj1HtWfBuLvWr9U&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=w8KuTvf8Nqf30gGlp7TDDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=floating%20population%20definition&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the floating types, who are in the area but do not live there permanently and are not considered part of the official census count.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Floating|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O999-floating.html|publisher=The Oxford Pocket Dictionary of Current English (2009)|accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The residing population of a [[city]] can be sub-classified into two groups, one who permanently resides in a city for a considerably long duration of time like ten to fifteen years, and the others are those, like hostel [[students]] and transferable government servants, who might live for two to three years in a given area, as per their requirements, but are replaced by an equal number of new population for the same purpose after their departure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shinichi Ichimura|title=Decentralization policies in Asian development|year=2009|publisher=World Scientific|pages=414|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FS_C2RSKLPIC&amp;pg=PA91&amp;lpg=PA91&amp;dq=floating+population+definition&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Xpf3HBN3TX&amp;sig=ltcL8TTdpBTk0y-Zt3N1bueT-fQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=w8KuTvf8Nqf30gGlp7TDDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=floating%20population%20definition&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, at any given time the number of people under this category remains more or less the same. The floating population, on the other hand, of a city consists of two types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Xizhe Peng|title=The changing population of China|year=2000|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|pages=180|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iWiyiohL8_cC&amp;pg=PA180&amp;lpg=PA180&amp;dq=floating+population+definition&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6Qm7iaNZ5y&amp;sig=6LmwM2RaAJP1Mj1qKlrbzOKSZ0U&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=w8KuTvf8Nqf30gGlp7TDDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=floating%20population%20definition&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first category is those who visit a place regularly but do not stay in that area permanently or long enough to be considered official, like any person working in a city for a short time job. The second type consists of visitors or guests who might live for a small span of time, but their time of stay and their next visit are not predictable, like [[tourists]] and seasonal [[wikt:visitor|visitor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=4.3 ANALYSIS OF FLOATING POPULATION|url=http://www.dudh.gov.bt/gelephu/part4/4.3.htm|publisher=Department of Urban Development &amp; Engineering Services|accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7484">The '''fungal loop hypothesis''' suggests that soil [[fungi]] in arid ecosystems connect the metabolic activity of [[plants]] and [[biological soil crusts]] which respond to different [[soil moisture]] levels. Compiling diverse evidence such as limited accumulation of [[soil organic matter]], high phenol oxidative and proteolytic enzyme potentials due to microbial activity, and symbioses between plants and fungi, the fungal loop hypothesis suggests that carbon and nutrients are cycled in biotic pools rather than [[Leaching (agriculture)|leached]] or effluxed to the [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]] during and between pulses of [[precipitation]].&lt;ref&gt;Collins, S.L., Sinsabaugh, R.L., Crenshaw, C., Green, L., Porras-Alfaro, A., Stursova, M., and Zeglin, L.H. 2008. Pulse dynamics and microbial processes in aridland ecosystems. Journal of Ecology 96: 413–420.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory development==
The fungal loop hypothesis is similar in concept to the [[microbial loop]] hypotheses in oceans or soil, more specifically for arid ecosystems. That is because of characteristics specific to arid ecosystems that are not found elsewhere.

===Pulse dynamics===
In arid ecosystems, there is low total [[precipitation]] and high variability in size of rain events (pulses) within and between years. Differences in how plants and decomposers respond to these pulses of precipitation affects [[biogeochemical cycling]] within the ecosystem. For example, [[extracellular enzymes]] present in the soil become active nearly instantaneously after any moisture pulse, while production in microbes and plants have lag times of various durations, and require pulse events of different sizes. &lt;ref&gt;Williams, C.A., Hanan, N., Scholes, R.J., Kutsch, W. 2009. Complexity in water and carbon dioxide fluxes following rain pulses in an African savanna. Oecologia 161: 469-480.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patchy distribution of nutrient pools===
[[Arid ecosystem]]s also often have patchy distributions of [[vascular plants]] with bare patches of [[soil]] in between. Such vegetation reduces radiation and wind speed at the soil surface which reduces [[evaporation]] and thus creates favorable [[microhabitats]] for other species. In addition, as plants [[senesce]] and become [[Plant litter|litter]], this increases carbon and nitrogen contents in the top layers of soil under plant canopies.&lt;ref&gt;Charley, J.L., and West, N.E. 1975. Plant-Induced Soil Chemical Patterns in Some Shrub-Dominated Semi-Desert Ecosystems of Utah. Journal of Ecology 63(3): 945-963.
&lt;/ref&gt; Together, these effects create “islands of fertility” where plants are distributed.&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger, W.H., and Pilmanis, A.M. 1998. Plant-soil interactions in deserts. Biogeochemistry 42: 169-187.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the bare soil between plants, [[biological soil crusts]] are often present. Crust microorganisms can fix carbon and nitrogen from the atmosphere as well as trap nitrogen-rich dust.&lt;ref&gt;Hawkes, C. 2003. Nitrogen cycling mediated by biological soil crusts and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Ecology 84: 1553-1562.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, biology soil crusts contribute to carbon content and nutrient resources in soil surfaces where plant cover is low.

===The role of fungi in biogeochemical cycling===
Litter produced by plants must be broken down by [[decomposers]] into nutrients available to organisms. Both [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]] produce extracellular enzymes to break down large molecules into compounds that can be taken up by plants.&lt;ref&gt;Skujins, R.G. 1976. Extracellular enzymes in soil. CRC Critical Reviews in Microbiology. 4(4): 383-421.&lt;/ref&gt; However, fungi can [[metabolize]] at higher temperatures and lower water potentials than bacteria. Therefore, in arid ecosystems where precipitation falls during the hot season, fungi are likely the most important contributors to [[nutrient cycling]] due to their tolerance to temperature and ability to persist during long dry periods.  In several sites in the southwestern US, [[denitrification]] and [[nitrification]] were shown to be mostly carried out by fungi.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, S.L., Sinsabaugh, R.L., Crenshaw, C., Green, L., Porras-Alfaro, A., Stursova, M., and Zeglin, L.H. 2008. Pulse dynamics and microbial processes in aridland ecosystems. Journal of Ecology 96: 413–420.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The fungal loop===
In arid ecosystems, many primary producers, such as grasses and biological soil crusts, form [[symbioses]] with fungi. [[Mycorrhizal fungi]] colonizing plant roots acquire carbon directly from plant roots, provide phosphorus sources to plants, and have been shown to transport water.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, M.F. 2007. Mycorrhizal Fungi: Highways for Water and Nutrients in Arid Soils. Vadose Zone Journal 6(2): 291-297.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dark septate endophytes]] (DSE) are also common in many aridland plants and are hypothesized to perform similar roles as mycorrhizal fungi.&lt;ref&gt;Mandyam, K. and Jumpponen, A. 2005. Seeking the elusive function of the root-colonising dark septate endophytic fungi. Studies in Mycology. 53: 173-189.&lt;/ref&gt; Fungi are an integral part of the biological soil crust community, and similar fungal taxa have been found in biological soil crusts and plant root zones, which suggests hyphal connections between these two spatially separate organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Porras-Alfaro, A., Herrera, J., Natvig, D.O., Lipinski, K., Sinsabaugh, R.L. 2011. Diversity and distribution of soil fungal communities in a semiarid grassland. Mycologia 103: 10-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fungal loop hypothesis suggests that biological soil crusts and associated microbes are able to become active after smaller water pulses compared to vascular plants, which require more water to become active. However, fungi are able to take up the nutrients produced by biological soil crusts at lower water potentials, and keep them in the biotic pool until larger water pulses allow plants to become active and take up those nutrients. Active plants then are able to contribute excess carbon from [[photosynthesis]] to their fungal symbionts. Therefore, root-associated fungi symbiotic with plants and biological soil crusts connect the spatially- and temporally-distinct activities of crusts and plants.

==Evidence==
Evidence of conditions favorable to the existence of a fungal loop is readily available.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, S.L., Sinsabaugh, R.L., Crenshaw, C., Green, L., Porras-Alfaro, A., Stursova, M., and Zeglin, L.H. 2008. Pulse dynamics and microbial processes in aridland ecosystems. Journal of Ecology 96: 413–420.&lt;/ref&gt; However, direct experimental tests of the hypothesis in arid ecosystems are still relatively rare. One study used [[isotope|isotopic]] labeling to trace where [[nitrate]] and [[glutamate]] moved when provided to biological soil crust or to grass foliage a distance away. They found that organic and inorganic N could be dispersed up to 100 cm per day bidirectionally between plants and crust.&lt;ref&gt;Green, L.E., Porras-Alfaro, A., and Sinsabaugh, R.L. 2008. Translocation of nitrogen and carbon integrates biotic crust and grass production in desert grassland. Journal of Ecology 96: 1076–1085.&lt;/ref&gt; Other research has shown evidence of bidirectional transport in soil-fungal-plant connections in redistributing water in arid ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, M. F. (2009), Bidirectional water flows through the soil–fungal–plant mycorrhizal continuum. New Phytologist, 182: 290–293.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Junges Gras.jpg|thumb|Germinating [[Festuca|fescue grass]] with long, blade-like leaves]]

In [[botany]] and [[ecology]], '''graminoid''' refers to a [[herbaceous plant]] with a grass-like morphology, i.e. elongated [[culm (botany)|culms]] with long, blade-like leaves. They are contrasted to [[forbs]], herbaceous plants without grass-like features.

The plants most often referred to include the families [[Poaceae]] (grasses in the strict sense), [[Cyperaceae]] (sedges), and [[Juncaceae]] (rushes). These are not closely related but belong to different [[clade]]s in the order [[Poales]]. The grasses (Poaceae) are by far the largest family with some 12,000 species.

Besides their similar morphology, graminoids share the widespread occurrence and often dominance in open habitats such as [[grasslands]] or [[marshes]]. They can however also be found in the [[understory]] of forests. Sedges and rushes tend to prefer wetter habitats than grasses.

[[File:MBTA commuter car headend.agr.jpg|thumb|[[MBTA]] commuter rail car with U.S. standard head-end power [[Jumper cable|electrical connection cables]]]]
In [[rail transport]], '''head-end power''' ('''HEP'''), also known as '''electric train supply''' ('''ETS''') is the electrical power distribution system on a passenger train. The power source, usually a locomotive (or a generator car) at the front or 'head' of a train, provides the electricity used for heating, lighting, electrical and other 'hotel' needs.  The maritime equivalent is [[hotel electric power]]. A successful attempt by the [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway]] in October 1881 to light the passenger car between London and Brighton&lt;ref name="jfl"&gt;{{cite book | last = JFL | title = Train lighting by electricity | publisher = Ben Johnson &amp; Co. | year = 1914 | location = London and York | accessdate = 2013-03-17 | url =https://archive.org/details/trainlightingbye00jflouoft/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; heralded the beginning of using electricity to light trains in the world.

==History==

Oil lamps were introduced in 1842 to light trains.&lt;ref name="SimmonsEvans2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jack Simmons|author2=A. K. B. Evans|author3=John V Gough|title=The Impact of the Railway on Society in Britain: Essays in Honour of Jack Simmons|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VVXjt4KZWL8C&amp;pg=PA49|accessdate=17 March 2013|year=2003|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-0949-0|pages=49–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economics drove the [[Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway]] to replace oil with coal gas lighting in 1870, but a gas cylinder explosion on the train led them to abandon the experiment.&lt;ref name="SimmonsEvans2003"/&gt; Oil-gas lighting was introduced in late 1870. Electrical lighting was introduced in October 1881&lt;ref name="jfl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SimmonsEvans2003"/&gt; by using twelve [[Joseph Swan|Swan]] carbon filament incandescent lamps connected to an underslung battery of 32 [[Camille Alphonse Faure|Faure]] [[lead-acid]] rechargeable cells, suitable for about 6 hours lighting before being removed for recharging.&lt;ref name="jfl"/&gt;

The [[North British Railway]] in 1881 successfully generated electricity using a dynamo on the ''Brotherhood'' steam locomotive to provide electrical lighting in a train, a concept that was later called ''head-end power''. High steam consumption led to abandonment of the system. Three trains were started in 1883 by [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway]] with electricity generated on board using a dynamo driven from one of the axles. This charged a lead-acid battery in the guard's van, and the guard operated and maintained the equipment. The system successfully provided electric lighting in the train.&lt;ref name="jfl"/&gt;

In 1887, steam-driven generators in the [[baggage car]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stuart|first1=Charles W. T.|title=A Few Points in the History of Car Lighting|journal=Railway Electrical Engineer|date=May 1919|volume=10|issue=5|page=158|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3xQ6AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA158&amp;lpg=PA158&amp;dq=generator+florida+special+baggage+car&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_kVRSIDzwt&amp;sig=GGxXgvGW3Sj41zzKypz7XtAkMd0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=50b8U--ALcOryASAzIHABg&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=generator%20florida%20special%20baggage%20car&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the ''Florida Special'' and the ''Chicago Limited'' trains in the US supplied electric lighting to all the cars of the train by wiring them, to introduce the other form of head-end power.&lt;ref&gt;{{White-Passenger-1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oil-gas lighting provided a higher intensity of light compared to electric lighting and was more popularly used till September 1913, when an [[1913 Ais Gill rail accident|accident]] on the [[Midland Railway]] at [[Aisgill]] caused a large number of passenger deaths. This accident prompted railways to adopt electricity for lighting the trains.&lt;ref name="jfl"/&gt;

Throughout the remainder of the [[steam locomotive|age of steam]] and into the early diesel era, passenger cars were heated by low pressure [[saturated steam]] supplied by the locomotive, with the electricity for car lighting and [[HVAC|ventilation]] being derived from [[battery (electricity)|batteries]] charged by axle-driven [[electrical generator|generator]]s on each car, or from [[engine-generator]] sets mounted under the carbody.  Starting in the 1930s, [[air conditioning]] became available on railcars, with the energy to run them being provided by mechanical [[power take off]]s from the axle, small dedicated engines or [[propane refrigerator|propane]].

The resulting separate systems of lighting power, steam heat, and engine-driven air conditioning, increased the maintenance workload as well as parts proliferation. Head-end power would allow for a single power source to handle all those functions, and more, for an entire train.

In the steam era, all cars in Finland and Russia had a wood or coal fired fireplace. Such a solution was considered a fire danger in most countries in Europe, but not in Russia.

==United Kingdom==
Originally, trains hauled by a [[steam locomotive]] would be provided with a supply of steam from the locomotive for heating the carriages.&lt;ref name="jfl"/&gt; When [[diesel locomotive]]s and [[electric locomotives]] replaced steam, the steam heating was then supplied by a [[Steam generator (railroad)|steam-heat boiler]].  This was oil-fired (in diesel locomotives) or heated by an electric element (in electric locomotives). Oil-fired steam-heat boilers were unreliable. They caused more locomotive failures on any class to which they were fitted than any other system or component of the locomotive,{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} and this was a major incentive to adopt a more reliable method of carriage heating.

At this time, lighting was powered by [[battery (electricity)|batteries]] which were charged by a [[electrical generator|dynamo]] underneath each carriage when the train was in motion, and [[buffet car]]s would use [[bottled gas]] for cooking and water heating.&lt;ref name="jfl"/&gt;

===Electric Train Heat (ETH) and Electric Train Supply (ETS)===
Later diesels and [[electric locomotive]]s were equipped with '''Electric Train Heating''' ('''ETH''') apparatus, which supplied electrical power to the carriages to run electric heating elements installed alongside the steam-heat apparatus, which was retained for use with older locomotives. Later carriage designs abolished the steam-heat apparatus, and made use of the ETH supply for heating, lighting, ventilation, [[air conditioning]], fans, sockets and kitchen equipment in the train. In recognition of this ETH was eventually renamed '''Electric Train Supply''' ('''ETS''').

Each coach has an index relating to the maximum consumption of electricity that it could use.  The sum of all the indices must not exceed the index of the locomotive. One "ETH index unit" equals 5&amp;nbsp;kW; a locomotive with an ETH index of 95 can supply 475&amp;nbsp;kW of electrical power to the train.

==North America==
The first advance over the old axle generator system was developed on the [[Boston and Maine Railroad]], which had placed a number of steam locomotives and passenger cars into dedicated commuter service in [[Boston]].  Due to the low average speeds and frequent stops characteristic of a commuter operation, the axle generators' output was insufficient to keep the batteries charged, resulting in passenger complaints about lighting and ventilation failures.  In response, the railroad installed higher capacity generators on the locomotives assigned to these trains, and provided electrical connections to the cars.  The cars used steam from the locomotive for heating.

Some early diesel streamliners took advantage of their fixed-consist construction to employ electrically-powered lighting, air conditioning, and heating. As the cars were not meant to mix with existing passenger stock, compatibility of these systems was not a concern. For example, the [[Nebraska Zephyr]] trainset has three diesel generator sets in the first car to power onboard equipment.

When diesel locomotives were introduced to passenger service, they were equipped with [[steam generator (railroad)|steam generator]]s to provide steam for car heating. However, the use of axle generators and batteries persisted for many years.  This started to change in the late 1950s, during which time the [[Chicago and North Western Railway]] removed the steam generators from their [[EMD F7]] and [[EMD E8|E8]] locomotives in commuter service and installed [[diesel generator]] sets (see ''[[Peninsula 400]]'').  This was a natural evolution, as their commuter trains were already receiving low-voltage, low-current power from the locomotives to assist axle generators in maintaining battery charge.

While many commuter fleets were quickly converted to HEP, long-distance trains continued to operate with steam heat and battery-powered electrical systems.  This gradually changed following the transfer of intercity passenger rail service to [[Amtrak]] and [[Via Rail]], ultimately resulting in full adoption of HEP in the US and Canada and the discontinuation of the old systems.

Following its formation in 1971, Amtrak's initial locomotive purchase was the [[Electro-Motive Diesel|Electro-Motive]] (EMD) [[EMD SDP40F|SDP40F]], an adaptation of the widely used [[EMD SD40-2|SD40-2]] 3000 horsepower freight locomotive, fitted with a passenger style carbody and steam generating capability.  The SDP40F permitted the use of modern motive power in conjunction with the old steam-heated passenger cars acquired from predecessor railroads, allowing Amtrak time to procure purpose-built cars and locomotives.

In 1975, Amtrak started to take delivery of the all-electric [[Amfleet]] car, hauled by [[General Electric]] (GE) [[GE P30CH|P30CH]] and [[GE E60|E60CH]] locomotives, later augmented by EMD [[EMD F40PH|F40PH]] and [[EMD AEM-7|AEM7]] locomotives, all of which were equipped to furnish HEP. Five Amtrak E8s were rebuilt with HEP generators for this purpose. In addition, 15 baggage cars were converted to HEP generator cars to allow the hauling of Amfleet by non-HEP motive power (such as [[PRR GG1|GG1s]] substituting for unreliable [[Budd Metroliner|Metroliner EMUs]]). Following the introduction of the Amfleet, the (all-electric) [[Superliner (railcar)|Superliner]] railcar was placed into operation on long-distance western routes.  Amtrak subsequently converted a portion of the steam-heated fleet to all-electric operation using HEP, and retired the remaining unconverted cars by the mid-1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Bob | last = Johnson | title = Head-end power | date = 1 May 2006 | url = http://trn.trains.com/railroads/abcs-of-railroading/2006/05/head-end-power | work = ABCs of Railroading | accessdate = 9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Engine==
The HEP generator can be driven by either a separate engine mounted in the locomotive or generator car, or by the locomotive's [[prime mover (locomotive)|prime mover]].

===Separate engines===
{{main|Auxiliary power unit}}
Genset-supplied HEP is usually through an auxiliary diesel unit that is independent from the main propulsion (prime mover) engine. Such [[Diesel generator|engine/generator]] sets are generally installed in a compartment in the rear of the locomotive. Both the prime mover and the HEP genset share fuel supplies.

Smaller under-car engine/generator sets for providing electricity on short trains are also manufactured.

===Locomotive prime mover===
In many applications, the locomotive's prime mover provides both propulsion and head-end power.  If the HEP generator is driven by the engine then it must run at a constant speed ([[revolutions per minute|RPM]]) to maintain the required 50&amp;nbsp;Hz or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz AC line [[frequency]]. An engineer will not have to keep the throttle in a higher run position, as the onboard electronics control the speed of the engine to maintain the set frequency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://trn.trains.com/railroads/abcs-of-railroading/2006/05/head-end-power| publisher=''Kalmbach Publishing Co'' | title=Head-end power - TRAINS magazine| date=2006-05-01| accessdate=9 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, locomotives have adopted the use of a static inverter, powered from the traction generator, which allows the prime mover to have a larger RPM range.

When derived from the prime mover, HEP is generated at the expense of traction power.   For example, the [[General Electric]] {{Convert|3200|hp|MW|lk=in|abbr=on}} [[GE Genesis#P32AC-DM|P32]] and {{Convert|4000|hp|MW|abbr=on}} [[GE Genesis#P42DC|P40]] locomotives are derated to {{Convert|2900|and|3650|hp|MW|abbr=on}}, respectively, when supplying HEP. The [[Fairbanks-Morse]] [[FM P-12-42|P-12-42]] was one of the first HEP equipped locomotives to have its prime mover configured to run at a constant speed, with traction generator output regulated solely by varying excitation voltage.

One of the first tests of HEP powered by an EMD locomotive's prime mover was in 1969, on [[Milwaukee Road]] [[EMD E9]] #33C, which was converted to have a constant speed rear engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://sbcglobalpwp.att.net/w/i/willvdv/ros7milw.html| title=Milwaukee Road Commuter Locomotives }}{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electrical loading==
HEP power supplies the lighting, [[HVAC]], dining car kitchen and battery charging loads. Individual car electrical loading ranges from 20&amp;nbsp;kW for a typical car to more than 150&amp;nbsp;kW for a [[Dome car]] with kitchen and dining area, such as Princess Tours [[Ultra Dome]] cars operating in [[Alaska]].
&lt;ref name="Northwest Rail"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nwrail.com/HEP_config.html| title=HEP Trainline Configurations in North America| publisher=''Northwest Rail''| accessdate=2011-01-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Voltage==
[[File:Electric power supply cable of YZ25T 357470 (20151229085331).jpg|thumb|Connection cables between two China Railways 25T coaches]]
===North America===
Because of train lengths and the high power requirements in [[North America]], HEP is supplied as [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase]] AC at 480&amp;nbsp;[[Volt|V]] (standard in the US and Canada), 575&amp;nbsp;V, or 600&amp;nbsp;V. [[Transformer]]s are fitted in each car for reduction to lower voltages.&lt;ref name="Northwest Rail"/&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, ETS is supplied at 800&amp;nbsp;V to 1000&amp;nbsp;V AC/DC two pole (400 or 600&amp;nbsp;A), 1500&amp;nbsp;V AC two pole (800&amp;nbsp;A) or at 415&amp;nbsp;V 3 phase on the [[InterCity 125|HST]]. On the former Southern Region, Mk I carriages were wired for a 750 V DC supply. This corresponds to line voltage on the Third Rail network. Class 73 Locomotives simply supply this line voltage direct to the ETS jumpers, whilst Class 33 Diesel Electric Locomotives have a separate engine driven Train Heating Generator which supplies 750 V DC to the train heating connections.

===Ireland===
In Ireland, HEP is provided at European/IEC standard 230/400 V 50 Hz (originally 220/380 V 50 Hz.) This is to the same specification as the power systems used in Irish and EU domestic and commercial buildings and industry. 

On the Cork-Dublin CAF MK4 sets, this is provided by two generators, located in the [[driving trailer]] van and on the push-pull Enterprise sets, this is provided by generators in a dedicated tailing van. Irish DMU trains, which make up the majority of the fleet, use small generators located under each coach.

Historically, HEP and, in older vehicles, steam heating was provided by trailing generator vans containing generators and [[steam generator (railroad)|steam boiler]]s. These were normally located on the rear of train sets. The Enterprise Dublin-Belfast train sets initially used HEP from [[IE 201 Class|GM 201 diesel-electric locomotive]]s, but due reliability issues and excessive wear on the locomotives systems, generator vans (sourced from retired Irish Rail MK3 sets and adapted for push-pull use) were added.

===Russia===
Russian cars use electric heating with either 3&amp;nbsp;kV DC voltage on DC lines or 3&amp;nbsp;kV AC voltage on AC lines provided by locomotive's main transformer. Newer cars are mostly made by Western European manufacturers and are equipped similarly to RIC cars.

===Europe (RIC cars, except Russia and UK)===
[[International Coach Regulations|RIC]] cars must be able to be supplied at all the following four voltages: 1,000&amp;nbsp;V AC {{frac|16|2|3}}&amp;nbsp;Hz, 1,500&amp;nbsp;V AC 50&amp;nbsp;Hz, 1,500&amp;nbsp;V DC and 3,000&amp;nbsp;V DC. The first one is used in Austria, Germany, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland, where the {{15 kV AC}} [[Overhead lines|catenary system]] is used (some parking place sockets use 1,000&amp;nbsp;V AC 50&amp;nbsp;Hz). The second one (1.5&amp;nbsp;kV AC) is used in countries which use {{25 kV 50 Hz}} catenary system (Croatia, Denmark, Finland, Hungary, Serbia and UK, and some lines in France, Italy and Russia). In both cases, the proper voltage is provided by the locomotive's main transformer or an AC alternator in diesel locomotives. In countries using DC power (either 1.5&amp;nbsp;kV or 3&amp;nbsp;kV DC), the voltage collected by the pantograph is supplied directly to the cars. (Belgium, Poland and Spain, and some lines in Russia and Italy use 3&amp;nbsp;kV, and the Netherlands, and some lines in France use 1.5&amp;nbsp;kV; see more detailed information in the ''[[List of railway electrification systems]]'' article.)

Older European cars used high voltage (or steam – supplied by steam locomotive (some diesels and electrics also had steam boilers fitted), there were also [[Steam generator (railroad)|steam generator cars]] in use and some cars were fitted with coal- or oil-fired boiler) only for heating, while light, fans and other low-current supply (e.g. shaver sockets in bathrooms) power was provided by axle-driven generator. Today, with the developments in solid state electronics (thyristors and IGBTs), most cars have switching power supplies which take any RIC voltage (1.0 – 3.0&amp;nbsp;kV DC or {{frac|16|2|3}}/50&amp;nbsp;Hz) and can supply all the needed lower voltages. Low voltages differ depending on manufacturers, but typical values are:
* 12&amp;nbsp;V – 48&amp;nbsp;V DC for on-board electronics (supplied from chemical battery when HEP disabled)
* 24&amp;nbsp;V – 110&amp;nbsp;V DC for feeding fluorescent lamps' electronic ballasts and for ventilation fans (supplied from chemical battery when HEP disabled)
* Single phase 230&amp;nbsp;V AC for passenger sockets, refrigerators etc. (sometimes supplied from chemical battery, as above)
* Three phase 400&amp;nbsp;V AC for air conditioning compressor, heating, ventilation fans (air cond. is nowadays not supplied from chemical battery due to power consumption)

Electric heating was typically supplied from high-voltage HEP line, but the unusual voltages are not common on the market and the equipment is expensive.

A standard RIC-compliant HV heater has six resistors which are being switched accordingly to voltage: 6 in [[Series and parallel circuits#Series circuits|series]] (3&amp;nbsp;kV DC), 2 × 3 in series (1.5&amp;nbsp;kV AC or DC) or 3 × 2 in series (1&amp;nbsp;kV AC). The selection and switching of a proper configuration is automatic for the sake of safety. Passengers can only operate [[thermostat]].

===China===
[[File:KD25K 998717@BJX (20150118131543).JPG|thumb|A KD&lt;sub&gt;25K&lt;/sub&gt; [[Head end power car|generator car]] in a passenger train]]
In China, HEP is supplied in two forms. 

On all 25A/G cars built before 2005, rebuilt and air-conditioned 22/25B cars, most 25K cars, and most BSP-built 25T cars, HEP is supplied at three-phase 380 V AC by generator cars (originally classified as TZ cars, later reclassified to KD), a small number of DF11G diesel locomotives, and very limited number of retrofitted [[China Railways SS9|SS9]] electrics. Cars with diesel generator sets (factory-built RZ/RW/CA22/23/25B cars, some rebuilt YZ/YW22/23/25B cars, most German-built 24 cars, and very limited number of 25G/K/T cars for special use) also supply their own power in this form. It's possible to route AC electricity from a car with diesel generator set to a neighboring normal HEP car, although both cars can't run their air conditioning or heat on full load in this situation. Those diesel-powered cars can also run on HEP from elsewhere, without using their own diesel. Although considered inefficient and obsolete, mainly because the generator car 'wastes' traction power, staff, and fuel (if running on electrified lines), new cars using AC HEP are still in production, along with new generator cars/sets, mostly for use in areas without electrification, considering that the vast majority of China Railways' engines that are capable of supplying HEP are electric locomotives. 

On most newer 25G cars and 25/19T cars, power is supplied at 600 V DC by electric locos such as SS7C, SS7D, SS7E, [[China Railways SS8|SS8]], [[China Railways SS9|SS9]], [[China Railways HXD1D|HXD1D]], [[China Railways HXD3C|HXD3C]], [[China Railways HXD3D|HXD3D]], and some [[China Railways DF11G|DF11G]] diesels (No.0041, 0042, 0047, 0048, 0053-0056, 0101-0218). Small number of special generator cars (QZ-KD25T) designated for use on the high-altitude [[Qinghai–Tibet Railway]] also supply power at 600 V DC. With new DC-equipped engines and cars entering service rapidly, as well as ageing and retirement of older equipments using AC, DC HEP has become the more prominent form of power supply of China Railways.

Very limited number of cars, mostly 25Ts, can run on both forms of HEP.

Although most locomotive-hauled trains take power directly from the locomotive, there have been examples (mainly in continental [[Europe]]) where restaurant cars could take power directly from the [[Overhead line|overhead wires]] while the train is standing and not connected to head-end power. For example, the German restaurant cars WRmz 135 (1969), WRbumz 139 (1975) and ARmz 211 (1971) were all equipped with [[Pantograph (transport)|pantographs]].

Some Finnish dining/catering cars have a built-in diesel-generator set that is used even when a locomotive-supplied power is available.

When the State of Connecticut began the [[Shore Line East]] service, they were using, in many cases, new passenger cars with old freight diesels which were not able to supply HEP, so some of the coaches were delivered with an HEP generator installed. With the acquisition of locomotives with HEP these have since been removed.

Where a passenger train must be hauled by a locomotive with no HEP supply (or an incompatible HEP supply) a separate generator van may be used &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://philtpics.fotopic.net/p39561132.html| title=a generator van converted from a Mk.1 BG| publisher=''Phil Trotter''| quote=During the 1980s, during low HST power car availability, a generator van converted from a Mk.1 BG was used to provide three-phase power to HST rakes so that they could be locomotive hauled.

[[KiwiRail]] (New Zealand) use [[NZR FM guards van|AG class]] luggage-generator vans for their [[Tranz Scenic]] passenger services; [[Tranz Metro]] on the Wairarapa line use [[New Zealand British Rail Mark 2 carriage#SW class|SWG class]] passenger carriages with part of the interior adapted to house a generator.  The [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus]] train used at least one custom-built power car that supplied HEP to its passenger coaches to avoid reliance upon host railway locomotives hauling the train.

In UK and Sweden the high-speed trains IC125 and X2000 have 50&amp;nbsp;Hz 3-phase power bus.

The '''''Hypostasis of the Archons''''' or '''''The Reality of the Rulers''''' is an [[exegesis]] on the ''[[Book of Genesis]]'' 1–6 and expresses [[Gnostic]] mythology of the divine creators of the cosmos and humanity.{{sfn|Meyer|Robinson|1977|p=152}}

== Text's origin and content ==

The text was found among those included in The [[Nag Hammadi Library]], in [[Nag Hammadi Codex II|CG II]], in 1945. It is tentatively dated in the third century CE{{sfn|Meyer|Robinson|1977|p=152}}{{sfn|Mills|Bullard|1990|p=398}} and is thought to originate from a transitional period in Gnosticism when it was converting from a purely mythological state into a philosophical phase. The beginning and conclusion to the document are Christian Gnostic, but the rest of the material is a mythological narrative regarding the origin and nature of the archontic powers peopling the heavens between Earth and the [[Ogdoad (Gnosticism)|Ogdoad]], and how the destiny of man is affected by these primeval happenings.&lt;ref&gt;Bullard in Robinson 162; Bullard 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The work is presented as a learned treatise in which a teacher addresses a topic suggested by the dedicatee of the work. The treatise begins with a fragment of [[cosmogony]], which leads to a revisionistic "true history" of the events in the Genesis creation story, reflecting Gnostic distrust of the material world and the demiurge that created it. Within this narrative there is an "angelic revelation dialogue" where an angel repeats and elaborates the author's fragment of cosmogonic myth in much broader scope, concluding with historical prediction of the coming of the savior and the end of days.&lt;ref&gt;Layton (1995) 65&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although the [[Etymology|etymologies]] and puns on Semitic names suggest the author's close contact with [[Judaism|Jewish]] legends and interpretive traditions as well as knowledge of [[Greek mythology]] and [[Hellenistic_period|Hellenistic]] [[Hellenistic_religion|cult]] practices, the myth is, according to [[Bentley Layton]] purposefully anti-Judaic (coining its traditional early rabbinic form, although no reason to placard it as anti-semittic).&lt;ref&gt;Layton (1995) 65&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, arguably, the work contains no Christian anti-Gnostic characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Layton (1995) 65&lt;/ref&gt; As the original Greek text has not been discovered, the only known version is the Coptic translation from Nag Hammadi.&lt;ref&gt;Layton (1995) 67&lt;/ref&gt;

__NOTOC__
{{Physical cosmology}}
In [[physical cosmology]] the '''inflationary epoch''' was the period in the evolution of the early [[universe]] when, according to [[inflation theory]], the universe underwent an extremely rapid exponential [[metric expansion of space|expansion]]. This rapid expansion increased the linear dimensions of the early universe by a factor of at least 10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; (and possibly a much larger factor), and so increased its volume by a factor of at least 10&lt;sup&gt;78&lt;/sup&gt;. Expansion by a factor of 10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; is equivalent to expanding an object 1 [[nanometer]] (10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; [[Meter|m]], about half the width of a [[molecule]] of [[DNA]]) in length to one approximately 10.6 [[light years]] (about 62 trillion miles) long.

The expansion is thought to have been triggered by the [[phase transition]] that marked the end of the preceding [[grand unification epoch]] at approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;−36&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the [[Big Bang]]. One of the theoretical products of this phase transition was a [[scalar field]] called the [[inflaton]] field. As this field settled into its lowest energy state throughout the universe, it generated a repulsive force that led to a rapid expansion of space. This expansion explains various properties of the current universe that are difficult to account for without such an inflationary epoch.

It is not known exactly when the inflationary epoch ended, but it is thought to have been between 10&lt;sup&gt;−33&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang. The rapid expansion of space meant that elementary particles remaining from the grand unification epoch were now distributed very thinly across the universe. However, the huge potential energy of the inflaton field was released at the end of the inflationary epoch, repopulating the universe with a dense, hot mixture of [[quark–gluon plasma|quarks, anti-quarks and gluons]] as it entered the [[electroweak epoch]].

On 17 March 2014, astrophysicists of the [[BICEP and Keck Array|BICEP2]] collaboration announced the detection of inflationary [[gravitational waves]] in the [[B-modes|B-mode]] [[power spectrum]], providing the first clear experimental evidence for [[Inflation (cosmology)|cosmological inflation]] and the [[Big Bang]].&lt;ref name="BICEP2-2014"&gt;{{cite web |authors=Staff |title=BICEP2 2014 Results Release |url=http://bicepkeck.org |date=17 March 2014 |work=[[National Science Foundation]] |accessdate=18 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20140317"&gt;{{cite web |last=Clavin |first=Whitney |title=NASA Technology Views Birth of the universe |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-082 |date=17 March 2014 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=17 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20140317"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=Detection of Waves in Space Buttresses Landmark Theory of Big Bang |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html |date=17 March 2014 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=17 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=BICEP2 I: Detection of ''B''-mode Polarization at Degree Angular Scales|first1=P.

A [[preprint]] released by the [[Planck spacecraft|Planck]] team in September 2014, eventually accepted in 2016, provided the most accurate measurement yet of dust, concluding that the signal from dust is the same strength as that reported from BICEP2.&lt;ref name="AXV-20140919"&gt;

[[File:PSM V31 D010 James Fergusson.png|thumb|James Fergusson]]
'''James Fergusson''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (22 January 1808&amp;nbsp;– 9 January 1886) was a Scottish architectural historian, mainly remembered for his interest in Indian historical architecture and antiquities. He was an important figure in the 19th century rediscovery of ancient India. He was originally a businessman, and though not formally trained as an architect, designed some buildings and decorative schemes.

==Life==
Fergusson was born at [[Ayr]], the son of [[William Fergusson (physician)|William Fergusson]] (1773–1846) an army surgeon. After being educated first at the [[Royal High School (Edinburgh)|Royal High School]], Edinburgh, and then at a private school in [[Hounslow]], he went to [[Calcutta]] as a partner in a mercantile house. Here he became interested in the remains of the ancient architecture of India, little known or understood at that time.  The successful conduct of an [[indigo]] factory, as he states in his own account, enabled him to retire from business after about ten years and settle in London. His observations on [[Indian architecture]] were first published in his book on ''The Rock-cut Temples of India'', published in 1845.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=273}}

The task of analysing the historic and [[aesthetic]] relations of this type of ancient buildings led him further to undertake a historical and critical comparative survey of the whole subject of architecture in ''The Illustrated Handbook of Architecture, being a Concise and Popular Account of the different Styles of Architecture prevailing in all Ages and Countries'', a work which first appeared in 1855 in two volumes. It was followed in 1862 by one entitled ''A History of the Modern Styles of Architecture'', being a sequel to the ''Handbook of Architecture''.

The 1855 work was reissued ten years later in a much more extended form in three volumes, under the title of ''A History of Architecture in all Countries from the Earliest Times to the Present Day.''{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=273}}
[[File:James Ferguson architect.jpg|thumb|left]]
The chapters on [[Indian architecture]], which had been considered at rather disproportionate length in the Handbook, were removed from the general History, and the whole of this subject treated more fully in a separate volume, ''The History of Indian and Eastern Architecture'', which appeared in 1876, as the fourth volume to ''The History of Architecture''. The 1876 work was later revised with additions by James Burgess and [[Richard Phené Spiers]] in 1910 and published in two volumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dames|first=M. Longworth|title=''History of Indian and Eastern Architecture'' by James Fergusson; James Burgess; R. Phené Spiers|journal=[[The Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland]]|date=April 1913|pages=470–474|jstor=25189005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fergusson was the first clearly to point out and characterise the essential difference between this and the spontaneously evolved architecture of preceding ages. His 1849 ''Historical Inquiry into the True Principles of Beauty in Art: More Especially with Reference to Architecture'' is a most thoughtful metaphysical study. Some of his essays on special points in archaeology, such as the treatise on ''The Mode in which Light was introduced into Greek Temples'', included theories on [[Greek temple]]s which have not received general acceptance.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=273}}

Like many of his contemporaries, Fergusson was concerned about British preparedness to resist a French invasion and he published ''An Essay on a Proposed New System of Fortification: with Hints for its Application to our National Defences'' (1849), ''The Peril of Portsmouth; or, French Fleets and English Forts'' (1852) and ''Portsmouth Protected: a Sequel to the Peril of Portsmouth'' (1856). In 1859, he was the only civilian appointed to the [[Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom]],&lt;ref&gt;Ramaswami Iyengar, Professor M S and others (1922), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7yQv_AkyG_wC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=%22james+fergusson%22+portsmouth&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=soU6VcWiAoLoaMXEgOAL&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22james%20fergusson%22%20portsmouth&amp;f=false ''Eminent Orientalists: Indian, European, American''], G A Natesan &amp; Co, Madras (pp. 87–88)&lt;/ref&gt; which subsequently recommended a huge programme of coastal fortifications that became known as "[[Palmerston's Follies]]".

He received the gold medal of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] in 1871. Among his works, besides those already mentioned, are: ''Palaces of Nineveh and Persepolis restored'' (1851), ''Mausoleum at Halicarnassus restored'' (1862), ''Tree and Serpent Worship'' (1868), ''Rude Stone Monuments in all Countries'' (1872), and ''The Temples of the Jews and the other Buildings in the Haram Area at Jerusalem'' (1878). The sessional papers of the [[Institute of British Architects]] include papers by him on ''The History of the Pointed Arch'', ''Architecture of Southern India'', ''Architectural Splendour of the City of Beeja pore'', on the ''Erechtheum'' and on the ''Temple of Diana at Ephesus''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=273}}

Although not a prolific practising architect, a small number of examples of Fergusson's architecture remain in existence, the most notable of which are the parliament building of [[Jamaica]],{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} and the [[Marianne North]] Gallery in [[Kew Gardens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ref=harv |origyear=2002 |date=30 November 2004 |title=The Marianne North Gallery |url=http://www.kew.org/heritage/places/mariannenorth.html |publisher=Board of Trustees of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120132610/http://www.kew.org/heritage/places/mariannenorth.html |archivedate=20 November 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fergusson was adviser with [[Austen Henry Layard]] in the scheme of decoration for the [[Assyria]]n court at [[The Crystal Palace]], and in 1856 assumed the duties of general manager to the Crystal Palace Company, a post which he held for two years. In 1866 he was a member of a committee to advise Henry Scott on design aspects of the [[Royal Albert Hall]], along with architects [[William Tite]] and [[Matthew Digby Wyatt]], and the engineers [[John Hawkshaw]] and [[John Fowler (engineer)|John Fowler]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=273}}

In 1847 Fergusson published an Essay on the ''Ancient Topography of Jerusalem'', in which he contended that the [[Mosque of Omar]] was the identical church built by [[Constantine the Great]] over the tomb of our Lord at Jerusalem, and that it, and not the present church of the [[Holy Sepulchre]], was the genuine burial-place of Jesus. The burden of this contention was further explained by the publication in 1860 of his ''Notes on the Site of the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem''; and ''The Temples of the Jews and the other Buildings in the Haram Area at Jerusalem'', published in 1878, which was a further elaboration of these theories, which are said to have been the origin of the establishment of the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=273}}

Fergusson died in London on 9 January 1886.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=273}}

The '''LIGO Scientific Collaboration''' ('''LSC''') is a scientific collaboration of international physics institutes and research groups dedicated to the search for [[gravitational waves]].

==History==
The LSC was established in 1997, under the leadership of [[Barry Barish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Committee on Setting Priorities for NSF-Sponsored Large Research Facility Projects, Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy, Policy and Global Affairs, Board on Physics and Astronomy, Division on Engineering and Physical Sciences, National Research Council.  |date= 2004|title= Setting Priorities for Large Research Facility Projects Supported by the National Science Foundation |publisher= [[National Academies Press]] |pages= 129–136 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its mission is to ensure equal scientific opportunity for individual participants and institutions by organizing research, publications, and all other scientific activities, and it includes scientists from both LIGO Laboratory and collaborating institutions. Barish appointed [[Rainer Weiss]] as the first spokesperson.

LSC members have access to the US-based [[Advanced LIGO]] [[gravitational wave detector|detectors]] in [[LIGO Hanford Observatory|Hanford, Washington]] and in [[LIGO Livingston Observatory|Livingston, Louisiana]], as well as the [[GEO 600]] detector in [[Sarstedt]], Germany. Under an agreement with the [[European Gravitational Observatory]] (EGO), LSC members also have access to data from the [[Virgo interferometer|Virgo detector]] in [[Pisa]], Italy. While the LSC and the Virgo Collaboration are separate organizations, they cooperate closely and are referred to collectively as "LVC".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://dcc.ligo.org/public/0110/M1300550/011/LVC_MOUcallAndSummary.pdf |title=Open call for partnership for the EM identification and follow-up of GW candidate events |authors=Gabriela González, Fulvio Ricci, LIGO Scientific Collaboration, Virgo Collaboration |format=PDF |date=2015-12-06 |access-date=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current LSC Spokesperson is [[David Shoemaker]] from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]. The Executive Director of the LIGO Laboratory is [[David Reitze]] from the [[University of Florida]].

On 11 February 2016, the LIGO and Virgo collaborations{{efn|The 11 February 2016 announcement team were [[Kip Thorne]], [[David Reitze]], [[Gabriela González]], and [[Rainer Weiss]].}} announced that they succeeded in making the first direct [[Gravitational-wave astronomy|gravitational wave observation]] on 14 September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Gravitational Waves Exist: The Inside Story of How Scientists Finally Found Them| url = http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/gravitational-waves-exist-heres-how-scientists-finally-found-them|newspaper = [[The New Yorker]]|access-date = 2016-02-11|issn = 0028-792X|first = Nicola|last = Twilley}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PRL-20160211"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Abbott, B.P. |title=Observation of Gravitational Waves from a Binary Black Hole Merger |url=http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102 |journal=[[Phys.

In 2016, Barish received the [[Enrico Fermi Prize]] "for his fundamental contributions to the formation of the LIGO and LIGO-Virgo scientific collaborations and for his role in addressing challenging technological and scientific aspects whose solution led to the first detection of gravitational waves".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2016 Enrico Fermi Prize|url=http://www.primapagina.sif.it/article/466/il-premio-fermi-2016-alle-onde-gravitazionali|publisher=Società Italiana di Fisica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Landmark Columbus''''' is an organization in [[Columbus, Indiana]], United States, that is dedicated to caring for and celebrating the world-renowned [[cultural heritage]] of Columbus, a city which is home to seven of the forty three [[List of National Historic Landmarks in Indiana|National Historic Landmarks in Indiana]]. It was started as a program of Heritage Fund – The Community Foundation of Bartholomew County in 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sisson|first1=Patrick|title=Columbus, Indiana, a Modernist Mecca, Updates Historic Preservation Efforts|url=http://www.curbed.com/2016/2/4/10941332/columbus-indiana-architecture-midcentury-modern|accessdate=14 May 2016|work=Curbed|date=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been recognized for leading an innovative way to care for heritage without a protective law&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Connors |first1=Will |title=Indiana Town Preserves Its Historic Architecture, Without a Protective Law |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/indiana-town-preserves-its-historic-architecture-without-a-protective-law-1491816606 |accessdate=21 June 2018 |work=Wall Street Journal |date=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and making a positive impact in the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reports|first1=Staff|title=Group makes big impact with city’s heritage|url=http://www.therepublic.com/2015/11/18/group_makes_big_impact_with_citys_heritage/|accessdate=14 May 2016|work=The Republic|date=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 it became a "Friends Organization" of Docomomo US&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A New Year and a New Organization in  Columbus, Indiana {{!}} docomomo united states|url=http://docomomo-us.org/news/a_new_year_and_a_new_organization_columbus_indiana|website=docomomo-us.org|accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remains a partner of the Indiana Modern committee of [[Indiana Landmarks]].

==History==
The effort to start Landmark Columbus began in 2013 when the Columbus Redevelopment Commission began looking at new ways to research and examine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Columbus taps conservator to preserve architecture|url=http://www.wdrb.com/story/22423226/columbus-taps-conservator-to-preserve-architecture|accessdate=14 May 2016|work=www.wdrb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the current state for the design heritage in the Columbus Arts and Entertainment District.&lt;ref name="AIC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCoy|first1=Richard|title=The Columbus Challenge|journal=Objects Speciality Group Postprints|date=2014|volume=21|pages=363-377|url=http://resources.conservation-us.org/osg-postprints/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2015/03/osg021-17.pdf|accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The start of this project came at a time when some of the modern works of [[architecture]] had begun to age and show signs of transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notes on Columbus, Indiana {{!}} docomomo united states|url=http://www.docomomo-us.org/news/notes_columbus_indiana|website=www.docomomo-us.org|accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
  
The effort officially launched as "Landmark Columbus" in 2015 as a program of Heritage Fund, and began producing events in the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McClure|first1=Julie|title=MONUMENTAL TASK|url=http://www.therepublic.com/2015/11/06/monumental_task|work=The Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Columbus Update: Civic Inspiration at the Right Scale {{!}} docomomo united states|url=http://docomomo-us.org/news/columbus_update_civic_inspiration_right_scale|website=docomomo-us.org|accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Karaim|first1=Reed|title=Is Columbus's Modernist Legacy at Risk?|url=http://www.architectmagazine.com/design/is-columbuss-modernist-legacy-at-risk_o|accessdate=23 July 2016|date=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effort has been seen as a way to preserve the design legacy of the town without relying on traditional historic preservation ordinances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ross|first1=Michael Franklin|title=Saving the Columbus Occupational Health Association|url=http://archpaper.com/2016/08/columbus-occupational-health-association/#gallery-0-slide-1|accessdate=20 August 2016|work=Archpaper.com|date=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs and advocacy projects==
[[File:2015 Columbus Conversation - Davis, Prudon, and Joyner 11.jpg|thumb|Landmark Columbus' 2015 Columbus Conversation in the chapel at [[First Christian Church (Columbus, Indiana)|First Christian Church]]]]
Landmark Columbus produces a number of ongoing programs and projects in an effort to care for the design heritage, most of which are created by an Advocacy and Education Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McClure|first1=Julie|title=MONUMENTAL TASK|url=http://www.therepublic.com/2015/11/06/monumental_task|work=The Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization is active in the community in various ways,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Winter Magic, Spring Phoenix, and Columbus All Year|url=http://www.wfyi.org/programs/the-art-of-the-matter/radio/winter-magic-spring-phoenix-and-columbus-all-year|accessdate=30 July 2016|work=WFYI Public Media|date=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; including nominating the [[Irwin Conference Center]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Modern landmark finds a new use|url=http://www.hiddengemsindiana.org/2015/01/irwin-conference-center-columbus.html|website=Hidden Gems Indiana}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a Docomomo US National Citation of Merit in 2014 for the [[National Historic Landmark]] building designed by [[Eero Saarinen]], which was restored through an adaptive reuse project by [[Cummins]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Citation of Merit - Cummins Irwin Conference Center &amp; Office Buildings {{!}} docomomo united states|url=http://docomomo-us.org/citation_merit_cummins_irwin_conference_center_office_buildings|website=docomomo-us.org|accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Columbus historians David Sechrest and Ricky Berkey have been involved with the organization from the beginning, helping to create projects around both the early and modern history of the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McClure|first1=Julie|title=MONUMENTAL TASK|url=http://www.therepublic.com/2015/11/06/monumental_task|work=The Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Friends of First Christian Church Architecture===
Friends of First Christian Church Architecture (FFCCA) is a collaborative effort with a mission to "is to preserve the architecture and design elements of FCC, a National Historic Landmark designed by Eliel &amp; Eero Saarinen in 1942."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Purpose|url=http://www.fccoc.org/building.php|website=www.fccoc.org|publisher=Friends of First Christian Church|accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was launched in January 2017 as a partnership with First Christian Church, Heritage Fund, Landmark Columbus, and Indiana Landmarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sisson|first1=Patrick|title=Saving the country’s first modern church, and a Columbus architecture landmark|url=http://www.curbed.com/2017/2/2/14485452/eero-eliel-saarinen-first-christian-church-columbus-indiana|accessdate=2 February 2017|work=Curbed|date=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first project for FFCCA was to help save the sanctuary skylight,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Blair|first1=Brian|title=First (Christian) things first: New group forms to protect city’s original Modernist building|url=http://www.therepublic.com/2017/01/24/first_christian_things_first/|accessdate=2 February 2017|work=The Republic|date=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which leaked for years and caused damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clark|first1=John|title=First Christian Church in need of help maintaining landmark {{!}} 1010 WCSI|url=http://1010wcsi.com/first-christian-church-in-need-of-help-maintaining-landmark/|accessdate=2 February 2017|work=1010wcsi.com|date=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August of 2018 FFCCA had raised enough resources from the congregation and throughout the community to have the skylight fully restored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=McClure |first1=Julie |title=Architectural integrity: First Christian Church skylight repair retains defining characteristic |url=http://www.therepublic.com/2018/08/08/architectural_integrity_first_christian_church_skylight_repair_retains_defining_characteristic/ |accessdate=8 August 2018 |work=The Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fundraising for the restoration of the skylight was a collaborative effort, and included contributions from the Church congregation, Kenny Glass, Inc., and the Columbus Area Visitors Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Reports |first1=Staff |title=Church’s skylight project highlights successful collaboration |url=http://www.therepublic.com/2018/08/24/churchs_skylight_project_highlights_successful_collaboration/ |accessdate=28 August 2018 |work=The Republic |date=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Columbus Conversations===
Columbus Conversation is an annual symposium held to address a pressing need in the community related to Columbus' design heritage.  The series began in 2014 and featured Theodore Prudon's keynote presentation "Modern Architecture as Heritage,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2014 Columbus Conversation|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWArV-gUd2c|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=15 May 2016|date=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and included lectures by Marsh Davis, from [[Indiana Landmarks]]; Louis Joyner, a Columbus-based architect; Richard McCoy; and a conversation moderated by Harry McCawley. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Elig|first1=Jenny|title=Preserving architecture taking center stage|work=The Republic|date=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2015 Columbus Conversation featured a panel discussion by Jeff Baker, the last president of Preserve to Enjoy, Inc.; Tricia Gilson from the Columbus Indiana Architectural Archives; Flora Chou, board member of Docomomo US; and Theodore Prudon, board president of Docomomo US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2015 Columbus Conversation by Landmark Columbus|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2yt26zsCOc|website=YouTube|accessdate=14 May 2016|date=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This moderated discussion defined ways that Landmark Columbus could raise awareness about caring for the areas design heritage and begin growing a constituency that actively helps in the cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McClure|first1=Julie|title=Landmark group invites residents for a chat about historic preservation|url=http://www.therepublic.com/2015/10/23/landmark_group_invites_residents_for_a_chat_about_historic_preservation/|website=The Republic|accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chaotic Tuesdays===
[[File:2015 Chaotic Tuesday.jpg|thumb|left|A "Chaotic Tuesday" inside the Commons]]
In celebration of [[Jean Tinguely]]'s masterwork, ''[[Chaos 1]]'', located inside the Commons, Landmark Columbus started "Chaotic Tuesdays" as a free community event during which everyone could see the [[kinetic art]]work operate during the evening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Blair|first1=Brian|title=Returning to a state of ‘Chaos’|url=http://www.therepublic.com/2015/02/22/returning_to_a_state_of_chaos/|accessdate=14 May 2016|work=The Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea for the event came from the director of [[Museum Tinguely]], Roland Wetzel, when he visited in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Talking Chaos with Roland Wetzel|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T16pS4n3_Fs|website=YouTube|publisher=Landmark Columbus|accessdate=15 May 2016|date=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event happens on the fourth Tuesday of every month and has grown to be a partnership between many in the community and led by the Columbus Area Arts Council. Professors from Ivy Tech bring drawing materials for the community and provide lessons on how to draw the artwork, which Tinguely himself did many times; his drawings of ''Chaos 1'' are in collections around the world.    

===Landscape architecture cleanups===
[[File:2015 North Christian Church Clean Up.jpg|thumb|2015 North Christian Church Landscape Clean Up]]
Landmark Columbus has organized a number of community efforts to help clean and maintain the landscape at [[North Christian Church]], which was designed by [[Dan Kiley]] and is one of seven National Historic Landmarks in the city. Cleanups have addressed issues caused by storms and ongoing maintenance, including the dormant pruning of the many [[magnolia]]s that surround the church. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Blair|first1=Brian|title=Helping ‘a beacon’ shine on|url=http://www.therepublic.com/2016/01/16/helping_a_beacon_shine_on/|work=The Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yearly bicycle rides===
Landmark Columbus started a yearly bicycle tour in May that coincides with National Preservation Month and [[National Bike Month]].  
* The 2015 "Olde Tyme Architectural Bicycle Ride" featured a tour of late 19th and early 20th century architecture and landscapes near downtown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clark|first1=John|title=Health advocates plan local bike month activities|url=http://1010wcsi.com/health-advocates-plan-local-bike-month-activities/|accessdate=15 May 2016|work=1010 WCSI}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 2016 "Mad Men Bike Ride" featured many works of modern architecture, including stops at North Christian Church and the [[Miller House (Columbus, Indiana)|Miller House and Garden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=May is Bike Month - City of Columbus Indiana|url=http://www.columbus.in.gov/news/may-is-bike-month/|website=www.columbus.in.gov|publisher=City of Columbus|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Landmark Lego Challenge===
In May 2016 Landmark Columbus held a first-of-its-kind competition that invited participants to build one of the seven National Historic Landmarks out of [[Lego]] bricks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Blair|first1=Brian|title=Get a leg up on LEGO building competition during opening event today|url=http://www.therepublic.com/2016/05/13/get_a_leg_up_on_lego_building_competition_during_opening_event_today/|accessdate=27 May 2016|work=The Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This project was launched in partnership with the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]], kids commons, the Columbus Indiana Architectural Archives, and other organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reports|first1=Staff|title=Lego challenge builds on city’s architectural foundations|url=http://www.therepublic.com/2016/05/26/lego_challenge_builds_on_citys_architectural_foundations/|accessdate=27 May 2016|work=The Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Docomomo US Tour Day===
Various partners began participating in "Tour Day" starting in 2013 to draw regional interest in visiting Columbus and seeing the modern architecture.
* In 2013, a tour was given of the Columbus Arts District and the Miller House and Gardens. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TOUR DAY 2013: INDIANA {{!}} docomomo united states|url=http://www.docomomo-us.org/tour_day_2013/indiana|website=www.docomomo-us.org|accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2014, Indiana Landmarks created the "Landmarks Experience: Columbus," a day-long immersion with lectures and tours that included the Miller House.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tour Day 2014: INDIANA {{!}} docomomo united states|url=http://www.docomomo-us.org/tour_day_2014_indiana|website=www.docomomo-us.org|accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2015, Landmark Columbus created the "Saarinen, Pei, and the Plaza that Connected Them" tour, which looked at the relationship between the [[Cleo Rogers Memorial Library]] Henry Moore's [[Large Arch]], and First Christian Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saarinen, Pei, and the Plaza that Connected Them {{!}} docomomo united states|url=http://docomomo-us.org/saarinen_pei_and_plaza_connected_them|website=docomomo-us.org|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Documentation and surveys===
In 2013 and 14, all of the [[public art]] in [[Bartholomew County]] was surveyed, photographed, and placed in the database of the Public Art Archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Columbus in the Public Art Archive|url=http://www.publicartarchive.org/search/apachesolr_search/?filters=im_work_coll_nid%3A69452|website=www.publicartarchive.org|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[list of public art in Bartholomew County, Indiana]] includes more than 100 artworks in a diverse group of places.  Also at this time, all of the resources in the Columbus Arts District and all of the modern buildings were surveyed, photographed, and published in the database of CultureNOW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Columbus in CultureNOW - MuseumWithoutWalls|url=http://www.culturenow.org/map&amp;zoom=14&amp;latLng=39.202241,-85.922328|website=www.culturenow.org|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CultureNOW - Newsletters|url=http://www.culturenow.org/newsletter&amp;date=2014-03|website=www.culturenow.org|accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other research projects have included investigations for public artworks that are now missing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Elig|first1=Jenny|title=In search of city’s lost art|url=http://www.therepublic.com/2015/03/01/in_search_of_citys_lost_art|work=The Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ongoing series of talks===
Landmark Columbus occasionally hosts experts of architecture, art, and community.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18991">'''Language analysis for the determination of origin''' ('''LADO''') is an instrument used in asylum cases to [[Linguistic profiling#Geographic origin|determine the national or ethnic origin]] of the asylum seeker, through an evaluation of their language profile. To this end, an interview with the asylum seeker is recorded and analysed. The analysis consists of an examination of the [[Dialectology|dialectologically]] relevant features (e.g. [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]], [[grammar]], [[vocabulary]] and [[loanword]]s) in the speech of the [[asylum seeker]]. LADO is considered a type of speaker identification by [[Forensic linguistics|forensic linguists]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter M. Tiersma &amp; Lawrence M. Solan (eds.), The Oxford Handbook of Language and Law. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 531.&lt;/ref&gt; LADO analyses are usually made at the request of government immigration/asylum bureaux attempting to verify asylum claims, but may also be performed as part of the appeals process for claims which have been denied; they have frequently been the subject of appeals and litigation in several countries, e.g. Australia, the Netherlands and the UK.

==Background==
A number of established linguistic approaches are considered to be valid methods of conducting LADO, including language variation and change,&lt;ref&gt;Patrick, Peter L. (2010). 'Language variation and LADO (Language Analysis for Determination of Origin).' In K Zwaan, P Muysken &amp; M Verrips, eds., Language and Origin. The role of language in European asylum procedures: A linguistic and legal survey, pp73-87. Nijmegen: Wolf Legal Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;JK Chambers, Peter Trudgill and Natalie Schilling-Estes, eds. (2002). The Handbook of Language Variation and Change. Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; forensic phonetics,&lt;ref&gt;Moosmüller, Sylvia. (2010). 'IAFPA position on language analysis in asylum procedures.' In K Zwaan, P Muysken &amp; M Verrips, eds., Language and Origin. The Role of Language in European Asylum Procedures: A Linguistic and Legal Survey, pp. 43–47. Nijmegen: Wolf Legal Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; dialectology, and language assessment.&lt;ref&gt;McNamara, Tim &amp; Carsten Roever. (2006). Language testing: The social dimension. Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

The underlying assumption leading to government immigration and asylum bureaux's use of LADO is that a link exists between a person's nationality and the way they speak. To linguists, this assumption is flawed: instead, research supports links between the family and community in which a person learns their  native language, and enduring features of their way of speaking it. The notion that [[Linguistic anthropology#Socialization|linguistic socialization]] into a [[speech community]] lies at the heart of LADO has been argued for by linguists since 2004,&lt;ref&gt;Language and National Origin Group. (2004). 'Guidelines for the Use of Language Analysis in relation to Questions of National Origin in Refugee Cases'. The International Journal of Speech, Language and the Law 11(2): 261–266.&lt;/ref&gt; and is now accepted by a range of government agencies (e.g. Switzerland,&lt;ref name="autogenerated9"&gt;Baltisberger, Eric &amp; Priska Hubbuch. (2010). 'LADO with specialized linguists: The development of Lingua's working method.' In K Zwaan, P Muysken &amp; M Verrips, eds., Language and Origin. The Role of Language in European Asylum Procedures: A Linguistic and Legal Survey, pp9-19. Nijmegen: Wolf Legal Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Norway&lt;ref&gt;UDI 2009. 'Specified requirements for language analysis for the Norwegian Immigration Administration.' Oslo: Utlendingsdirektoratet, July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;), academic researchers (e.g. Eades 2009,&lt;ref&gt;Eades, Diana. (2009). 'Testing the claims of asylum seekers: The role of language analysis.' Language Assessment Quarterly 6: 30–40.&lt;/ref&gt; Fraser 2011,&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, Helen. 2011. 'Language analysis for the determination of origin (LADO).' In C. A. Chapelle (Ed.), Encyclopedia of Applied Linguistics. Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; Maryns 2006,&lt;ref&gt;Maryns, Katrijn. 2006. The asylum speaker: Language in the Belgian asylum procedure. Manchester: St. Jerome.&lt;/ref&gt; and Patrick 2013&lt;ref&gt;Patrick, Peter L. (2013.) 'Asylum and language analysis.' In Susan K Brown &amp; Frank D Bean (eds.), Encyclopedia of Migration. Heidelberg: Springer Verlag. http://www.springerreference.com/docs/edit/chapterdbid/349348.html&lt;/ref&gt;), as well as some commercial agencies (e.g. De Taalstudio, according to Verrips 2010&lt;ref&gt;Verrips, Maaike. (2010). 'Language analysis and contra-expertise in the Dutch asylum procedure.' International Journal of Speech, Language &amp; the Law 17(2): 279–294.&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Where it is used==
Since the mid-1990s, language analysis has been used to help determine the geographical origin of [[asylum seeker]]s by the governments of a growing number of countries (Reath, 2004),&lt;ref&gt;Reath, A. (2004). 'Language analysis in the context of the asylum process: Procedures, validity, and consequences.' Language Assessment Quarterly: 1–4, 209–233.&lt;/ref&gt; now including [[Australia]], [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Canada]], [[Finland]], [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]] and the [[United Kingdom]].

Pilots have been conducted by the UK, [[Ireland]], and Norway.&lt;ref&gt;UDI 2009. 'Specified requirements for language analysis for the Norwegian Immigration Administration.' Oslo: Utlendingsdirektoratet, July 2009. https://www.udiregelverk.no/Global/Images/Rettskilder/Rundskriv/RS%202011%20023/RS%202011%20023V5.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The UK legitimised the process in 2003; it has subsequently been criticised by immigration lawyers (see response by the Immigration Law Practitioners' Association&lt;ref&gt;IPA April 2009. 'Response to the UK Border Agency "NAM+ Asylum Programme" presentation to the National Asylum Stakeholder Forum (NASF) on 19 March 2009' http://www.docstoc.com/docs/44362029/Response-to-the-UK-Border-Agency-NAM-Asylum-Programme&lt;/ref&gt;), and also Craig 2012&lt;ref&gt;Craig, Sarah. 2012. The use of language in asylum decision-making in the UK – a discussion. Journal of Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Law 26(3): 255–268. Oxford University Press: Westlaw.&lt;/ref&gt;); and social scientists (e.g. Campbell 2013&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, John. (2013.) 'Language analysis in the United Kingdom's Refugee Status Determination system: Seeing through policy claims about 'expert knowledge'.' Ethnic and Racial Studies 36(4): 670–690.&lt;/ref&gt;), as well as linguists (e.g. Patrick 2011&lt;ref&gt;Patrick, Peter L. (2011.) 'Key problems in language analysis for the determination of origin.' Plenary address to the International Association of Forensic Linguistics 10th Biennial conference at Aston University (July 2011). http://privatewww.essex.ac.uk/~patrickp/papers/IAFL10plenary_July2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;).

In the [[Netherlands]] LADO is commissioned by the Dutch Immigration Service (IND, http://www.ind.nl/Themas/Taalanalyse/Pages/default.aspx). Language analysis is used by the IND in cases where asylum seekers cannot produce valid identification documents, and, in addition, the IND sees reason to doubt the claimed origin of the asylum seeker. The IND has a specialised unit (Bureau Land en Taal, or BLT; in English, the Office for Country Information and Language Analysis, or OCILA) that carries out these analyses. Challenges to BLT analyses are provided by De Taalstudio &lt;http://www.taalstudio.nl/taalanalyse/index_uk.html&gt;, a private company that provides language analysis and contra-expertise in LADO cases. Claims and criticisms regarding the Dutch LADO processes are discussed by Cambier-Langeveld (2010),&lt;ref&gt;Cambier-Langeveld, T. (2010.) 'The validity of language analysis in the Netherlands.' In K Zwaan, P Muysken &amp; M Verrips, eds., Language and Origin. The Role of Language in European Asylum Procedures: A Linguistic and Legal Survey, pp. 21–33. Nijmegen: Wolf Legal Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; the senior linguist for BLT/OCILA, and by Verrips 2010,&lt;ref&gt;Verrips, Maaike. (2010.) 'Language analysis and contra-expertise in the Dutch asylum procedure.' International Journal of Speech, Language &amp; the Law 17(2): 279–294.&lt;/ref&gt; the founder of De Taalstudio. Zwaan (2008,&lt;ref&gt;Zwaan, Karin (ed). (2008). De taalanalyse in de Nederlandse asielprocedure. Een juridische en linguïstische verkenning. Nijmegen: Wolf Legal Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; 2010&lt;ref&gt;Zwaan, Karin. (2010.) 'Dutch court decisions and language analysis for the determination of origin.' In K Zwaan, P Muysken &amp; M Verrips, eds., Language and Origin. The Role of Language in European Asylum Procedures: A Linguistic and Legal Survey, pp. 43–47. Nijmegen: Wolf Legal Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;) reviews the legal situation.

LADO reports are provided to governments in a number of ways: by their own regularly-employed linguists and/or freelance analysts; by independent academic experts; by commercial firms; or by a mixture of the above. In Switzerland language analysis is carried out by LINGUA, a specialized unit of the Federal Office for Migration, which both employs linguists and retains independent experts from around the world.&lt;ref name="autogenerated9"/&gt; The German and Austrian bureaux commission reports primarily from experts within their own countries. The UK and a number of other countries have commercial contracts with providers such as the Swedish firms Sprakab&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sprakab.se/Home.html |title=Home |publisher=Sprakab.se |date= |accessdate=2013-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Verified &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.verified.se/ |title=Verified AB – Language Analyses, Dialect Identification, Linguistic Expertise |publisher=Verified.se |date= |accessdate=2013-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
both of which have carried out language analyses for UK Visas and Immigration (formerly UK Border Agency) and for the Dutch Immigration Service, as well as other countries around the world.

==Language analysts==
It is widely agreed that language analysis should be done by language experts. Two basic types of practitioners commonly involved in LADO can be distinguished: trained native speakers of the language under analysis, and professional linguists specialized in the language under analysis. Usually native speaker analysts are free-lance employees who are said to be under the supervision of a qualified linguist. When such analysts lack academic training in linguistics, it has been questioned whether they should be accorded the status of 'experts' by asylum tribunals, e.g. by Patrick (2012),&lt;ref&gt;Patrick, Peter L. (2012.) 'Language analysis for determination of origin: Objective evidence for refugee status determination.' Chapter 38 in Peter M. Tiersma &amp; Lawrence M. Solan (eds.), The Oxford Handbook of Language and Law. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 544&lt;/ref&gt; who refers to them instead as "non-expert native speakers (NENSs)". Eades et al. (2003) note that "people who have studied linguistics to professional levels [...] have particular knowledge which is not available to either ordinary speakers or specialists in other disciplines".&lt;ref&gt;Eades, D., H. Fraser, J. Siegel, T. McNamara &amp; B. Baker. (2003.) 'Linguistic identification in the determination of nationality: A preliminary report.' Language Policy 2: 179–199.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise Dikker and Verrips (2004)&lt;ref&gt;Dikker, S. &amp; Verrips, M. (2004.) 'Taalanalyse: een vak apart.' Onderzoeksrapport. Monnickendam: De Taalstudio.&lt;/ref&gt; conclude that native speakers who lack training in linguistics are not able to formulate reliable conclusions regarding the origin of other speakers of their language. The nature of the training which commercial firms and government bureaux provide to their analysts has been questioned in academic and legal arenas, but few specifics have been provided to date; see however accounts by the Swiss agency Lingua&lt;ref&gt;Baltisberger, Eric &amp; Priska Hubbuch. (2010.) 'LADO with specialized linguists: The development of Lingua's working method.' In K Zwaan, P Muysken &amp; M Verrips, eds., Language and Origin. The Role of Language in European Asylum Procedures: A Linguistic and Legal Survey, pp9-19. Nijmegen: Wolf Legal Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; and Cambier-Langeveld of BLT/OCILA,&lt;ref&gt;Cambier-Langeveld, T. (2010.) 'The role of linguists and native speakers in language analysis for the determination of speaker origin.' International Journal of Speech, Language &amp; the Law 17(1): 67–93&lt;/ref&gt; as well as responses to the latter by Fraser &lt;ref&gt;Fraser, Helen. (2011.) 'The role of linguists and native speakers in language analysis for the determination of speaker origin: A response to Tina Cambier-Langeveld.' International Journal of Speech, Language &amp; the Law 18(1): 121–130.&lt;/ref&gt; and Verrips.&lt;ref&gt;Verrips, Maaike. (2011.) 'LADO and the pressure to draw strong conclusions: A response to Tina Cambier-Langeveld.' International Journal of Speech, Language &amp; the Law 18(1): 131–143.&lt;/ref&gt;

Claims for and against the use of such native-speaker analysts, and their ability to conduct LADO satisfactorily vis-a-vis the ability of academically-trained linguists, have only recently begun to be the subject of research (e.g. Wilson 2009),&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Kim. (2009.) 'Language analysis for the determination of origin: Native speakers vs. trained linguists.' MSc dissertation in Linguistics, University of York&lt;/ref&gt; and no consensus yet exists among linguists. While much linguistic research exists on the ability of people, including trained linguists and phoneticians and untrained native speakers, to correctly perceive, identify or label recorded speech that is played to them, almost none of the research has yet been framed in such a way that it can give clear answers to questions about the LADO context.

==Litigation==
The matter of native-speaker analysts and many other issues are subjects of ongoing litigation in asylum tribunals and appeals courts in several countries. Vedsted Hansen (2010&lt;ref&gt;Vedsted Hansen, Jens. 2010. 'The use of language analysis in the Danish asylum procedure.' In K Zwaan, P Muysken &amp; M Verrips, eds., Language and Origin. The Role of Language in European Asylum Procedures: A Linguistic and Legal Survey, pp. 199–207. Nijmegen: Wolf Legal Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;) describes the Danish situation, Noll (2010&lt;ref&gt;Noll, Gregor. 2010. 'The 2007 rejection of anonymous language analysis by the Swedish Migration Court of Appeal: A precedent?' In K Zwaan, P Muysken &amp; M Verrips, eds., Language and Origin. The Role of Language in European Asylum Procedures: A Linguistic and Legal Survey, pp. 211–213. Nijmegen: Wolf Legal Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;) comments on Sweden, and Zwaan (2010) reviews the Dutch situation.
 
In the UK, a 2010 Upper Tribunal (asylum) case known as 'RB',&lt;ref&gt;RB (Linguistic evidence Sprakab) Somalia [2010] UKUT 329 (IAC) (15 September 2010), http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKUT/IAC/2010/00329_ukut_iac_2010_rb_somalia.html&lt;/ref&gt; supported by a 2012 Court of Appeal decision,&lt;ref&gt;RB (Somalia) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2012] EWCA Civ 277 (13 March 2012), http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/markup.cgi?doc=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2012/277.html&amp;query=rb+and+somalia&amp;method=boolean&lt;/ref&gt; argue for giving considerable weight to LADO reports carried out by the methodology of native-speaker analyst plus supervising linguist. In contrast, a 2013 Scottish Court of Sessions decision known as M.Ab.N+K.A.S.Y.&lt;ref&gt;M.Ab.N. &amp; K.A.S.Y. v SSHD [2013] CSIH 68, http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/opinions/2013CSIH68.html&lt;/ref&gt; found that all such reports must be weighed against the standard Practice Directions for expert reports. Lawyers in the latter case have argued that "What matters is the lack of qualification",&lt;ref&gt;Bryce, Joseph. Free Movement blog, 24 July 2013. 'Court of Sessions rules on linguistic analysis.' http://www.freemovement.org.uk/2013/07/24/court-of-session-rules-on-linguistic-analysis/&lt;/ref&gt; and since the Scottish court has equal standing to the England and Wales Appeals Court, the UK Supreme Court was petitioned to address the issues. On 5–6 March 2014, the UK Supreme Court &lt;ref&gt;UK Supreme Court. http://www.supremecourt.uk/&lt;/ref&gt; heard an appeal&lt;ref&gt;UKSC 2012/0202. {{cite web |url=http://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/case_2013_0202.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407082701/http://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/case_2013_0202.html |archivedate=2014-04-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; brought by the Home Office concerning the nature of expert linguistic evidence provided to the Home Office in asylum cases, whether expert witness should be granted anonymity, the weight that should be given to reports by the Swedish firm Sprakab, and related matters.

==Criticism==
Some methods of language analysis in asylum procedures have been heavily criticized by many linguists (e.g., Eades et al. 2003;&lt;ref&gt;Eades, Diana &amp; Jacques Arends, eds. (2004). Language Analysis and Determination of Nationality. In International Journal of Speech, Language &amp; the Law: Forensic Linguistics, 11(2): 179–266.&lt;/ref&gt; Arends, 2003). Proponents of the use of native-speaker analysts agree that "[earlier] LADO reports were not very satisfactory from a linguistic point of view... [while even] today's reports are still not likely to satisfy the average academic linguist".&lt;ref&gt;Cambier-Langeveld, T. (2012.) 'Clarification of the issues in language analysis: A rejoinder to Fraser and Verrips.' International Journal of Speech, Language &amp; the Law 19(1): 95, 108, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Following an item on the Dutch public radio programme Argos, member of parliament De Wit of the Socialist Party presented a number of questions to the State Secretary of the Ministry of Justice regarding the reliability of LADO. The questions and the responses by the State Secretary can be found here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justitie.nl/images/betrouwbaarheid%20taalanalyses_12840_tcm34-161304.pdf |title=Ministerie van Veiligheid en Justitie &amp;#124; Rijksoverheid.nl |publisher=Justitie.nl |date=1995-04-30 |accessdate=2013-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lauric acid''' or systematically, '''dodecanoic acid''', is a [[saturated fat|saturated]] [[fatty acid]] with a 12-carbon atom chain, thus having many properties of [[Medium-chain triglyceride|medium-chain fatty acids]], is a bright white, powdery solid with a faint odor of bay oil or soap.  The [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] and [[ester]]s of lauric acid are known as '''laurates'''.

==Occurrence==
[[File:ローレルオイル.JPG|200px|thumbnail|left|Laurel oil contains lauric acid.]]
Lauric acid, as a component of [[triglyceride]]s, comprises about half of the fatty-acid content in [[coconut milk]], [[coconut oil]], [[Laurus nobilis|laurel oil]], and  [[palm kernel oil]] (not to be confused with [[palm oil]]),&lt;ref name="lexicon"&gt;{{cite journal |year=2001 |title=Lexicon of lipid nutrition (IUPAC Technical Report) |journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry |volume=73 |issue=4 |pages=685–744 |url=http://iupac.org/publications/pac/73/4/0685/ |doi=10.1351/pac200173040685 |last1=Beare-Rogers |first1=J. |last2=Dieffenbacher |first2=A. |last3=Holm |first3=J.V.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;David J.

It is also found in human [[breast milk]] (6.2% of total fat), cow's milk (2.9%), and goat's milk (3.1%).&lt;ref name="lexicon" /&gt;

==Properties==
Although 95% of medium-chain triglycerides are absorbed through the [[portal vein]], only 25-30% of lauric acid is absorbed through it.&lt;ref name="pmid26946252"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Eyres L, Eyres MF, Chisholm A, Brown RC | title=Coconut oil consumption and cardiovascular risk factors in humans | journal= [[Nutrition Reviews]] | volume=74 | issue=4 | pages=267–280 | year=2016 | url=https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/nutrit/nuw002 | doi= 10.1093/nutrit/nuw002 | pmc= 4892314 | pmid = 26946252 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many other [[fatty acid]]s, lauric acid is inexpensive, has a long shelf-life, is nontoxic, and is safe to handle. It is used mainly for the production of [[soap]]s and [[cosmetics]].  For these purposes, lauric acid is reacted with [[sodium hydroxide]] to give [[sodium laurate]], which is a [[soap]].  Most commonly, sodium laurate is obtained by [[saponification]] of various oils, such as coconut oil.  These precursors give mixtures of sodium laurate and other soaps.&lt;ref name="Ullmann" /&gt;

===Niche uses===
In the laboratory, lauric acid may be used to investigate the [[molar mass]] of an unknown substance via the [[freezing-point depression]]. The choice of lauric acid is convenient because the melting point of the pure compound is relatively high (43.8°C). Its [[cryoscopic constant]] is 3.9°C·kg/mol. By melting lauric acid with the unknown substance, allowing it to cool, and recording the temperature at which the mixture freezes, the molar mass of the unknown compound may be determined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eee.uci.edu/programs/gchem/02MANfrzptdep.pdf |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160523055404/https://eee.uci.edu/programs/gchem/02MANfrzptdep.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2016-05-23 |publisher=[[University of California, Irvine]] |title=Using Freezing Point Depression to find Molecular Weight |date=2010-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Potential medicinal properties===
''[[In vitro]]'' experiments have suggested that some fatty acids including lauric acid could be a useful component in a treatment for [[acne]], but no clinical trials have yet been conducted to evaluate this potential benefit in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nakatsuji|first1=T|last2=Kao|first2=MC|last3=Fang|first3=JY|last4=Zouboulis|first4=CC|last5=Zhang|first5=L|last6=Gallo|first6=RL|last7=Huang|first7=CM|title=Antimicrobial Property of Lauric Acid Against Propionibacterium acnes: Its Therapeutic Potential for Inflammatory Acne Vulgaris|journal=The Journal of Investigative Dermatology|volume=129|issue=10|pages=2480–8|year=2009|pmid=19387482|pmc=2772209|doi=10.1038/jid.2009.93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Yang|first1 = D|last2 = Pornpattananangkul|first2 = D|last3 = Nakatsuji|first3 = T|last4 = Chan|first4 = M|last5 = Carson|first5 = D|last6 = Huang|first6 = CM|last7 = Zhang|first7 = L|title = The Antimicrobial Activity of Liposomal Lauric Acids Against Propionibacterium acnes|journal = Biomaterials|volume = 30|issue = 30|pages = 6035–40|year = 2009|pmid = 19665786|pmc = 2735618|doi = 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.07.033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lauric acid increases total serum [[cholesterol]] more than many other fatty acids, but most of the increase is attributable to an increase in [[high-density lipoprotein|high-density lipoprotein (HDL)]] (the "good" blood cholesterol). As a result, lauric acid has been characterized as having "a more favorable effect on total HDL cholesterol than any other fatty acid [examined], either saturated or unsaturated".&lt;ref name=Mensink2003&gt;{{cite journal | title = Effects of dietary fatty acids and carbohydrates on the ratio of serum total to HDL cholesterol and on serum lipids and apolipoproteins: a meta-analysis of 60 controlled trials | url=http://www.ajcn.org/content/77/5/1146.full?ijkey=846a72387ebc0d82545acd5442a0c3a9e9fc3566 | journal =American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |vauthors=Mensink RP, Zock PL, Kester AD, Katan MB | volume=77 | issue=5  | pages = 1146–1155 |date=May 2003 | issn = 0002-9165 | pmid = 12716665}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, a lower total/HDL serum cholesterol ratio correlates with a decrease in atherosclerotic risk.&lt;ref name=Thijssen&gt;Thijssen, M.A. and R.P.

''Atherosclerosis: Diet and Drugs''. Springer. pp. 171–172. {{ISBN|978-3-540-22569-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, an extensive meta-analysis on foods affecting the total [[Low-density lipoprotein|LDL]] /serum cholesterol ratio found in 2003 that the net effects of lauric acid on coronary artery disease outcomes remained uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/77/5/1146.full?ijkey=846a72387ebc0d82545acd5442a0c3a9e9fc3566 Effects of dietary fatty acids and carbohydrates on the ratio of serum total to HDL cholesterol and on serum lipids and apolipoproteins: a meta-analysis of 60 controlled trials]&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 review of coconut oil (which is nearly half lauric acid) was similarly inconclusive about the effects on [[cardiovascular disease]] risk.&lt;ref name="pmid26946252" /&gt;

'''Los Angeles Science Teachers Network''' is a professional development network for [[science education]] by science teachers for science teachers committed to creating the most engaging hands-on curriculum possible through [[inquiry-based learning]] and [[scientific literacy]].

==History==
The first meeting was held in [[Lisa Ellen Niver]]'s home in September 2009. In October 2013, the professional development network had its fifteenth session. Over seventy teachers and forty schools have been involved to date. In ''[[Westside Today]]'', information about teaching, science and LASTN was presented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Advisory Council==
Several teachers formed the core group and served as advisors to Niver over the first three years: Susan Bagdasarian, Sasha Moore, Joseph Rose and Judy Weiskopf. Niver was frequently asked about teaching science, she has been quoted in Parenting.com,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url        =  http://www.parenting.com/gallery/everyday-ways-sneak-learning |title      =Everyday Ways to Sneak in Learning |work     =Parenting.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[PBS]].org,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url        =  https://www.pbs.org/parents/education/science/tips/weather-science-lessons/ |title      =Weather Science Lessons |work      = PBS.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Green Living Arizona'' (in print),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url        =  http://www.greenlivingaz.com/2012/05/08/5528/ |title      =Science vs. Nutrition the GMO debate |work      =Green Living Magazine Arizona}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Huffington Post''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |url        =  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/14/back-to-school-divorce-teachers_n_1761147.html?ir=Divorce#slide=1376638 |title      =Back to School 2012: Teachers Reveal Divorced Parents Biggest Mistakes |work     =  Huffington Post | date=August 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on National television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url        =  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqZqdq7Al24 |title      =Career Day |work     =National Television}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url        = http://www.sciencebuddies.org/blog/2012/08/success-story-science-fair-projects-with-real-world-impact.php |title      =  Success Story: Science Fair Projects with Real-World Impact |work      =Science Buddies}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Niver is on sabbatical with [[We Said Go Travel]], Susan Bagdasarian has been the director of the network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url        =  http://www.linkedin.com/pub/lisa-niver-rajna/0/871/6a3f |title      =LASTN |work     =LinkedIn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url        =  http://www.linkedin.com/company/3148346?trk=tyah |title      =LASTN company |work     =LinkedIn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6169">'''Medical Missions for Children''' is an independent, non-profit organization that works to improve health outcomes for our world's most critically ill children by providing individual [[telemedicine]] consultations and implementing education programs focused on narrowing the knowledge gap between healthcare providers in the United States and those in the developing world.  MMC focuses on "transferring medical knowledge from those who have it to those who need it" using a state-of-the-art communications infrastructure in order to touch the lives of more than one million critically ill children each year.

==About==
Medical Missions for Children was founded in 1999 by Frank and Peg Brady.  Its Global Telemedicine and Teaching Network - GTTN - currently serves over 100 countries throughout Latin America/Caribbean, Africa, North America, Asia/Pacific, Eastern Europe/Central Asia and the Middle East.

MMC is located on the campus of [[St. Joseph's Regional Medical Center]] in [[Paterson, New Jersey]]. It is a major stakeholder in [[List of tallest buildings in Paterson|The Hamiltonian]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Hamiltonian |publisher=Garret Mountain Associates |date= |url=http://www.gmanj.com/home.html |accessdate=2014-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141121171821/http://www.gmanj.com/home.html |archivedate=2014-11-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a 14-story hotel and conference center projected to open in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web   | title = Medical Missions for Children Hilton Doubletree   | publisher = Emporis   | date =    | url = http://www.emporis.com/building/medical-missions-for-children-hilton-doubletree-paterson-nj-usa   | accessdate = 2014-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web      | last = Prochilo   | first = Dan   | title = Developer predicts $150M Paterson hotel will be 'very, very busy'   | publisher = Emporis   | date = August 11, 2014   | url = http://www.fios1news.com/newjersey/node/33976#.VIgKLt77-8U   | accessdate = 2014-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web   | last = Ma   | first = Myles   | title = $100 million Paterson hotel to break ground in October   | publisher = The Star-Ledger   | date = August 7, 2014   | url = http://www.nj.com/passaic-county/index.ssf/2014/08/100_million_paterson_hotel_to_break_ground_in_october.html   | accessdate = 2014-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last = Malinconico   | first = Joe   | title = Paterson hotel project at hospital gets $105 million in state funding   | publisher = NorthJersey.com   | date = December 10, 2013   | url = http://www.northjersey.com/news/paterson-hotel-project-at-hospital-gets-105-million-in-state-funding-1.653635   | accessdate = 2014-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Global Telemedicine and Teaching Network==
The Global Telemedicine and Teaching Network (GTTN) comprises several programs:
*The Medical Broadcasting Channel - A 24/7/365 channel airing medical programming via satellite broadcast, [[Internet2]], and IPTV Networks.
*The Telemedicine Outreach Program -  a network of 27 tier-one mentoring hospitals in the United States and Europe linking to hospitals and institutions in more than 100 countries.

This Medical Missions for Children/Paterson, NJ (MMC) should not be confused with Medical Missions for Children (MMFC), a 501(3)(c) charity based in Woburn, MA that sends 13-15 surgical, medical and dental missions around the world each year to care for impoverished children who suffer from cleft deformities, microtia (absence of ear), head and neck abnormalities and severe, untreated burn injuries

==Television Programs==
MMC currently produces four healthcare series, several of which have been broadcast on the [[New Jersey Network]], the predecessor to NJTV, New Jersey's affiliate of [[PBS]].
*Tomorrow's Medicine Today
*Plain Talk About Health
*Take Care
*Healthy U

==The ''Giggles'' Children's Theater==
Located at St. Joseph's Children's Hospital, the ''Giggles'' Children's Theater (''Giggles'') draws its curtains twice each week to bring the healing powers of laughter through the performing arts to hospitalized children in Paterson.  Each performance is broadcast live on the hospital's closed-circuit TV system so that no child is excluded due to sickness or incapacity. Each performance is also recorded and rebroadcast so that 10 shows per week are offered on the hospital's Giggles TV channel.

In April 2007 a second ''Giggles'' theater opened at The Children's Inn located at the campus of the [[National Institutes of Health]].

==Awards and honors==

In music, a '''notehead''' is the elliptical part of a [[Musical note|note]]. Noteheads may be the same shape but colored completely black or white, indicating the [[note value]] (i.e., rhythmic duration). In a [[whole note]], the notehead, shaped differently than shorter notes, is the only component of the note. Shorter note values attach a [[stem (music)|stem]] to the notehead, and possibly [[beam (music)|beam]]s or flags. The longer [[double whole note]] can be written with vertical lines surrounding it, two attached noteheads, or a rectangular notehead.&lt;ref name="Gerou"&gt;Gerou, Tom &amp; Lusk, Linda: [https://books.google.es/books?id=6PELtxxrz_QC&amp;pg=PA210 ''Essential Dictionary of Music Notation''.] Alfred Music, 1996, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; An "x" shaped notehead may be used to indicate percussion, percussive effects ([[ghost note]]s), or speaking. A square, diamond, or box shaped notehead may be used to indicate a [[harmonic|natural]] or [[artificial harmonic]].

==History==
Noteheads ultimately derive from the [[neume]]s used to notate [[Gregorian chant]]. The punctum, seen at right, is the simplest of the shapes and most clearly anticipates the modern notehead. When placed on a [[clef]], the position of a notehead indicates the relative pitch of a note. The development of different colors of noteheads, and the use of it to indicate rhythmic values, was the use of white [[mensural notation]], adopted around 1450.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Busse Berger|first=Anna Maria|title=Mensuration and Proportion Signs: Origins and Evolution|location=Oxford|publisher= Oxford University Press|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Franco of Cologne]], ancient composer and music theorist, codified a system of rhythm notation. He explained this system in his work, ''Ars Cantus Mensurabilis'', (which means “The Art of Measurable Music”) circa 1280. In this system, the relative duration of notes was indicated by the note shapes. The noteheads were rectangles, squares, or diamonds depending on the note length. This system was expanded during the [[Ars Nova]] period.

Shortly before the [[Renaissance]], scribes began to write the notes of the Franconian and Ars Nova style with open noteheads. During the Renaissance, composers added shorter note durations that used filled-in noteheads. Near the end of the 16th century, the square or diamond-shaped notes changed to the round noteheads that are used today.&lt;ref&gt;Burkholder, J.P., Grout, D.J., &amp; Palisca, C.V. (2006).

NuCaptcha is developed and operated by [[Canada|Canadian]]-based firm, NuData Security.&lt;ref name="reg"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/07/01/animated_captcha/|title=Animated CAPTCHA tech aims to fox spambots|work=[[The Register]]|accessdate=14 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theh"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.h-online.com/security/news/item/NuCaptcha-Flash-CAPTCHAs-to-combat-spambots-1032147.html|title=NuCaptcha Flash CAPTCHAs to combat spambots|accessdate=14 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eweek"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Security/Company-Looks-to-Slow-Spammers-With-Video-CAPTCHA-Technology-127193/|title=Spammers to Face Video CAPTCHA Technology - Security from eWeek|work=[[eWeek]]|accessdate=14 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gartner Security &amp; Risk Management Summit|url=http://agendabuilder.gartner.com/SEC19/webpages/VendorDetail.aspx?Vendor=96|work=[[Gartner]]|accessdate=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Static image-based CAPTCHAs are routinely used to prevent automated sign-ups to websites by using text or images of words disguised so that [[optical character recognition]] (OCR) software has trouble reading them.&lt;ref name="reg" /&gt; However, in common CAPTCHA systems, users often fail to correctly solve the CAPTCHA 7% - 25% of the time.&lt;ref name="captcha-evaluation"&gt;{{cite web |first=Elie|last=Bursztein |author2=Bethard, Steven |author3=Fabry, Celine |author4=Mitchell, John C. |author5= Jurafsky, Dan  |url=http://www.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/burszstein_2010_captcha.pdf|title= How Good are Humans at Solving CAPTCHAS?

== Technology ==
NuCaptcha attempts to solve usability of static image-based CAPTCHAS using two main technologies: 1) video animation to display CAPTCHA puzzles, and 2) a behaviour analysis system to monitor interactions with the platform.
# Video animation. CAPTCHAS are displayed as a video, and rendered in the web browser.  A variety of technologies can be used to display the animated CAPTCHA, such as Flash video, HTML5, or GIF.  Standard CAPTCHA techniques such as character crowding, once animated, are easier for humans to detect because of an innate motion-detecting ability.
# Behavior Analysis. Using machine-learning algorithms, NuCaptcha monitors platform interactions to tune the security of each CAPTCHA delivered to the user. Suspected attackers are given progressively more secure CAPTCHAS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/nucatpcha_introduces_video_CAPTCHAS_better_securit.php|title=Video CAPTCHAs Promise Better Security, Less Frustration|work=Read, Write, Web|accessdate=30 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Security ==
Security researcher [[Elie Bursztein]] demonstrated a practical attack against NuCaptcha's video CAPTCHA scheme by employing [[optical flow]] techniques to isolate individual CAPTCHA characters. The proposed attack is able to break the video CAPTCHAs in more than 90% of cases.&lt;ref name="elinucaptcha"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bursztein|first=Elie|title=How we broke the NuCaptcha video scheme and what we propose to fix it|url=http://elie.im/blog/security/how-we-broke-the-nucaptcha-video-scheme-and-what-we-propose-to-fix-it/|accessdate=20 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, NuCaptcha noted that Bursztein’s findings underscore the need for CAPTCHA puzzles to be part of a larger security construct, such as behavior monitoring to assess the risk of individual users. NuCaptcha also pointed out that the CAPTCHAS analyzed in Bursztein's blog post were middle-security puzzles focused on usability, and not the stronger puzzles presented to high-risk users.  In addition to this, NuCaptcha noted that the optical flow technique relies on static non-animated features of the puzzle.  Changes were made to NuCaptcha puzzles to remove the static non-animated features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B9OASUKWKndeMmZlZDYzNDEtZjBhOS00N2NhLTgwNGYtMWYyYmJlYzRhNjQ2/edit|title= NuCaptcha’s Thoughts on Elie Bursztein’s Document|accessdate=7 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application ==
NuCaptcha APIs are currently available in [[PHP]], [[.NET Framework|.NET]], and [[Java (programming language)|Java]]. Plugins are available for [[WordPress]], [[Drupal]], [[Codelgniter]], [[vBulletin]], and [[phpBB]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.nuCAPTCHA.com |title= NuCaptcha Docs |work=NuCaptcha|accessdate=25 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2011, NuCaptcha announced its CAPTCHA solutions for mobile devices across all platforms, including [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nuCAPTCHA.com/press-release/nuCAPTCHA-extends-user-friendly-CAPTCHAS-to-mobile-phones-tablets-and-other-connected-devices |title= NuCaptcha Extends User-Friendly Captchas to Mobile Phones, Tablets and other Connected Devices |work=Press Release|accessdate=5 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2805">'''Pre-construction services''' are used in planning a construction project before the actual construction begins. These services are often referred to as '''preconstruction''' or '''precon'''. It is a modern practice, considered to be part of [[Construction management|construction project management]], which is the overall planning, coordination, and control of a project from inception to completion aimed at meeting a client’s requirements in order to produce a functionally and financially viable project.

==Overview==
In the long established [[design-bid-build]] method of construction project delivery, a project would be entirely designed before being built.&lt;ref&gt;Standard Estimating Practice, Sixth Edition, ASPE, 2004 (page 10)&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in a package of plans and specifications which formed the construction documents. The owner would then request bids (or tenders) for the project and award the project to a successful bidder, who would then build the project.

Often the early feasibility, studies, and design development is supported by construction cost estimators, who prepare [[cost estimate]]s for use in the decision-making process. This process starts with planning, and is supported by conceptual or order-of-magnitude estimates. Design then starts with a schematic design (SD) stage, followed by a design development (DD) stage, and culminates in a construction document (CD) state.

In the design-bid-build system, there is a [[construction bidding]] process where the contractors’ construction cost estimators prepare the estimate and form the bid, based on the construction documents, in an intense pre-bid period, typically measured in weeks.

Pre-construction services grew out of construction cost estimating to encompass the other activities in planning a project.&lt;ref&gt;Preconstruction Services: Add Value with More Than Just Estimating, Steve Kuhn, Construction Business Owner, February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The intent is to work with the project’s owner to help deliver a satisfactory project that meets the owner’s objectives. In addition to estimating, the preconstruction team participates in design decisions, evaluations, studies, value engineering, value analysis, scheduling, constructability reviews, and more. Design costs, permitting, land acquisition, and life-cycle costs may also be evaluated. In delivering pre-construction services, general contractors or construction managers may also be negotiating for project construction services. Often this may be accomplished by agreeing on a guaranteed maximum price (GMP) for the project. The firm then delivers the project. Typically the owner and the firm share any cost savings realized during construction.

In [[linguistics]], a '''register complex''' is a combination of phonation type, [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], length, [[vowel]] quality and/or other variants that function dependently as distinguishing features within a single phonological system. In languages employing register systems, differences in a distinguishing feature correlate relative to the quality of another distinguishing feature.

For instance, in a system where [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], voice quality and [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]] timing were distinguishing features, the meaning of a vowel-consonant cluster like "Pai" (as in the [[English language|English]] word "Pie") may depend on whether the cluster is voiced in a high, medium or low pitch relative to the clearness, breathiness and glotteral quality of speech, as well as relative to the duration of the cluster relative to other neighboring clusters. Thus, "Pai" voiced in a high tone with a breathy quality and unstressed along with other unstressed clusters would connote a different meaning if any of the three features changed relative to other features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.csuchico.edu/~gt18/Papers/Vietnamese_tonogenesis.pdf |title=Vietnamese and tonogenesis: revising the model and the analysis |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many register languages are [[tone (linguistics)|tonal]]. However, tone is not a universal distinguishing feature among register systems and register complexes are not a component of most tonal languages. In fact, tonal languages can employ either a register tone systems or a contour tone systems. Mandarin has a contour tone system, where the distinguishing feature of the tones are their shifts in pitch (their pitch shapes or contours, such as rising, falling, dipping, or peaking) rather than simply their pitch relative to each other as in a register tone system. Register tone systems are found in [[Bantu languages]] and throughout [[Africa]]. In some register tone systems, there is a default tone, usually low in a two-tone system or mid in a three-tone system, that is more common and less salient than other tones. There are also languages that combine register and contour tones, such as the [[Kru languages]], though in such cases the register tones may be analysed as being 'level' (unvarying pitch) contour tones. Furthermore, often the term 'register,' when not in the phrase 'register tone,' is used to indicate vowel phonation combined with tone in a single phonological system. [[Burmese language|Burmese]], [[Khmer language|Khmer]] and possibly [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] are register languages. Burmese is usually considered a tonal language and Khmer a vowel-phonation language, but in both cases differences in relative pitch or pitch contours are correlated with vowel phonation, so that neither exists independently.

'''SA Pathology''', (formerly the Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science (IMVS) until 2008), is an organisation providing diagnostic and clinical pathology services throughout [[South Australia]].

SA Pathology has over 60 patient collection centres and numerous [[Laboratory|laboratories]] located throughout South Australia.

As a [[Non-profit organization|not-for-profit organisation]], SA Pathology bulk-bills patients for all Commonwealth Medical Benefit Schedule (CMBS) pathology tests.  In a recent article by [http://www.choice.com.au/reviews-and-tests/food-and-health/general-health/health-practitioners/pathology-gap-fees/page.aspx Choice magazine], it was recognised as the only consistently 'no gap, [[bulk billing]]' pathology provider in South Australia.

Profits generated from pathology are used to support rural communities, [[Medical education|medical training]] and [[medical research]]. SA Pathology has over 250 elite medical researchers studying diseases and disorders ranging from [[Blood cancer|blood]], [[Breast cancer|breast]] and [[colon cancer]], [[bone fracture]]s, [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[asthma]], [[hepatitis]], [[infectious disease]]s and [[genetic disorder]]s.

==History==
SA Pathology has a rich history of diagnostic pathology and research over 75 years. Established as the Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science (IMVS) in the late 1930s, it was an era which saw political and community leaders introduce significant reform, with a focus on improving public health.

Situated near the old [[Royal Adelaide Hospital]], in what used to be South Australia's principal [[teaching hospital]] precinct, the Institute began as an offshoot of the hospital laboratories. RAH Superintendent and Dean of Medicine Sir [[Trent Champion de Crespigny]] created an organisation combining laboratory services with pathology training and medical research. Dr. [[E. Weston Hurst]] was appointed its first director in 1937,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article131566423 |title=Surprise Bill in Assembly |newspaper=[[The News (Adelaide)]] |volume=XXIX, |issue=4,479 |location=South Australia |date=30 November 1937 |accessdate=20 August 2018 |page=7 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and left in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article48765147 |title=Medical Institute Director Resigns |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)]] |volume=LXXXVI, |issue=26488 |location=South Australia |date=27 August 1943 |accessdate=20 August 2018 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes occurred in the 1970s with a redefinition of IMVS services, resulting in the divisions of Forensic Pathology and Biology relocating and evolving into what is now the Forensic Science Centre. The 1980s saw stronger relationships with the RAH and the [[University of Adelaide]] which allowed the IMVS to diversify activity across emerging areas of pathology.

A later review recommended creation of separate science research laboratories, proposing that any new developments be integrated into IMVS and the hospital, which led to the establishment of the Hanson Institute in the early 1990s.

The IMVS experienced further change in 2008 in a merger with the pathology department of two other hospitals, the [[Women's and Children's Hospital]] and [[Flinders Medical Centre|Flinders Medical Centre's]] South Path, when the organisation was renamed SA Pathology. The core business continued to be diagnostic pathology for public health but adhering to its founder’s original vision, integrating pathology with clinical training and medical research.

The Centre for Cancer Biology was established within SA Pathology in 2008 as a hub for innovative science. Currently hosting over twenty group leaders and their teams, the CCB is an internationally recognised cancer research centre where research teams actively form alliances with pharmaceutical companies to foster knowledge and advance new treatments.

[[File:Terragen render.jpg|thumb|300px|A landscape created in [[Terragen]]]]

A '''scenery generator''' refers to [[software]] used to create [[landscape]] images, [[3D model|3D models]], and [[Animation|animations]]. These programs often use [[procedural generation]] to generate the landscapes. If not using procedural generation to create the landscapes, then normally a 3D artist would render and create the landscapes. These programs are often used in video games or movies. Basic elements of landscapes created by scenery generators include terrain, water, foliage, and clouds. The process for basic random generation uses a [[Diamond-square algorithm|diamond square algorithm]].

== Common features ==
Most scenery generators can create basic heightmaps to simulate the variation of elevation in basic terrain. Common techniques include Simplex noise, fractals, or the Diamond-Square Algorithm, which can generate 2-dimensional heightmaps. A version of scenery generator can be very simplistic. Using a Diamond-Square Algorithm with some extra steps involving fractals an algorithm for random generation of terrain can be made with only 120 lines of code. The program in example takes a grid and then divides the grid repeatedly. Each smaller grid is then split into squares and diamonds and the algorithm then makes the randomized terrain for each square and diamond. Most programs for creating the landscape can also allow for adjustment and editing of the landscape. For example World Creator allows for terrain sculpting which uses a similar “brush” system as Photoshop(Link?).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://towardsdatascience.com/neural-networks-and-the-future-of-3d-procedural-content-generation-a2132487d44a|title=Neural Networks and The Future of 3D Procedural Content Generation|last=Snider-Held|first=Sam|date=2017-07-26|website=Towards Data Science|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other tools the World Creator program can use are terrain stamping which you can import height-maps and uses them as a base. The programs tend to also allow for additional placement of rocks, trees, Etc. These can be done procedurally or by hand depending on the program. Typically the models used for the placement objects are the same as to lessen the amount of work that would be done if the user was to create a multitude of different trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.world-creator.com/features/#AnythingElse|title=World Creator - A Procedural Terrain and Landscape Generator|website=www.world-creator.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terrain generated the compute does a generation of multifractals then integrates them until finally rendering them onto the screen. These techniques are typically done “on-the-fly” which typically for a 128x128 resolution terrain would mean 1.5 seconds on a CPU from the early 90’s. If the user would want to zoom in on the terrain the algorithm the process would look like.&lt;ref&gt;“Dynamic Terrain Generation Based on Multifractal Techniques” TNO Physics and Electronic Laboratory. Retrieved October 29, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Scenery generators are commonly used in movies, animations and video games. For example, Industrial Light &amp; Magic used E-on Vue to create the fictional environments for Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-onsoftware.com/about/?page=PRIndex&amp;date=August%201,%202006 "Vue Helps Industrial Light &amp; Magic Create Environments for "Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest" VFX" (Press release).]&lt;/ref&gt; In such live-action cases, a 3D model of the generated environment is rendered and blended with live-action footage. Scenery generated by the software may also be used to create completely computer-generated scenes. In the case of animated movies such as Kung-Fu Panda, the raw generation is assisted by hand-painting to accentuate subtle details.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-onsoftware.com/about/?page=PRIndex&amp;date=August%2013,%202008 "Vue "Summer 2008 Blockbuster" Roundup" (Press release).]&lt;/ref&gt; Environment elements not commonly associated with landscapes, such as or ocean waves have also been handled by the software.

Scenery Generation is used in most 3D based video-games. These typically use either custom or purchased engines that contain their own scenery generators. For some games they tend to use a procedurally generated terrain.  These typically use a form of height mapping and use of Perlin noise(link?). This will create a grid that with one point in a 2D coordinate will create the same heightmap as it is pseudo-random, meaning it will result in the same output with the same input. This can then easily be translated into the product 3D image.  These can then be changed from the editor tools in most engines if the terrain will be custom built.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@miguelceledon/exploring-the-game-development-world-procedural-terrain-generation-theory-849d6e54f3a1|title=Exploring the game development world: Procedural terrain generation — Theory|last=Celedon|first=Miguel|date=2017-06-30|website=Medium|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; With recent developments neural networks can be built to create or texture the terrain based off previously suggested artwork or heightmap data. These would be generated using algorithms that have been able to identify images and similarities between them. With the info the machine can take other heightmaps and render a very similar looking image to the style image. This can be used to create similar images in example a Studio Ghibli or Van Gogh art-style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://towardsdatascience.com/neural-networks-and-the-future-of-3d-procedural-content-generation-a2132487d44a|title=Neural Networks and The Future of 3D Procedural Content Generation|last=Snider-Held|first=Sam|date=2017-07-26|website=Towards Data Science|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software==
There is a large variety and amount of software that will generate scenery and allow for editing of it. These can include:  

Game engines with terrain generation:

Most game engines whether custom or proprietary will have terrain generation built in

               See: [[List of game engines|List of Video Game Engines]]

Terrain generator programs:

*        [[Terragen]] – can create terrain, water, atmosphere, and lighting in this free windows program

*        L3DT – similar functions to the Terragen program, has a 2048x2048 limit

'''Shoe fetishism''' is the attribution of attractive sexual qualities to [[shoe]]s or other [[footwear]] as a matter of sexual preference, or an alternative or complement to a relationship with a partner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/ World Health Organization, International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, (2007), Chapter V, F65.0 Disorders of sexual preference.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Jerome Fagan]].

==Prevalence==
In order to determine the relative prevalences of different types of fetishes, scientists obtained a sample of at least 5000 individuals worldwide from 381 Internet discussion groups. The relative prevalences were estimated based on (a) the number of groups devoted to a particular fetish, (b) the number of individuals participating in the groups and (c) the number of messages exchanged. Using these measures, feet and shoes were found to be the most common target of preferences. This is consistent with an analysis of millions of search queries by users from the USA that were accidentally released during the [[AOL search data scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090404124043/http://www.aphrodisiology.com/aol-fetishes AOL search data] (archived link, April 4, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=May 2014}} Sixty-four (64) percent of the sampled population that had a preference for an object associated with the body had a preference for shoes, boots, and other footwear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Scorolli | first1 = C. | last2 = Ghirlanda | first2 = S. | last3 = Enquist | first3 = M. | last4 = Zattoni | first4 = S. | last5 = Jannini | first5 = E.

==Popular culture==

In the 19th century, Central European students drank wine or Champagne from their lady's shoe or bootlet as a sign of devotion. The custom is noted in the 1882 opera, ''[[Der Bettelstudent]]'', where Symon drinks Champagne from Laura’s shoe at their wedding. In commemoration of this romantic tradition, the French shoe manufacturer Louboutin issued in 2009, a glass shaped like a woman’s shoe, which was reviewed critically by the German daily, ''[[Die Welt]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.champagnerwelt.com/champagnerhaeuser/piperheidsieck/champagnerauseinenschuhtrinken.html |title=Champagner aus einen Schuh trinken |publisher=Champagnerwelt.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/debatte/kolumnen/Inga_Griese/article6058547/Champagner-nach-Art-des-Schuh-Fetisch.html |title=Kolumne: Inga Griese : Champagner nach Art des Schuh-Fetisch - Nachrichten Debatte - Kolumnen - Inga Griese - DIE WELT |publisher=Welt.de |date=2011-11-23 |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Sex and the City]]'' episode, "[[La Douleur Exquise!]]", featured a shoe salesman with a shoe and foot fetish, who allowed [[Charlotte York]] to have expensive shoes for free simply for allowing him to assist her in trying on various pairs of open shoes whilst he openly complimented her on the state of her feet and offered her [[reflexology|foot reflexology]]. The relationship came to an end when Charlotte figured out she had been getting discounts because she was letting him hold her feet and was further discomforted by the salesman obviously [[orgasm|climaxing]] while assisting her with the sixth pair of the day.

The movie ''[[There's Something About Mary]]'' featured a former boyfriend of Mary, Dom "Woogie" Wooganowski, played by [[Chris Elliott]], with a shoe fetish. He tried to steal her shoes.

In the animated comedy show ''[[Family Guy]]'', the character [[Glenn Quagmire]] has a foot and shoe fetish, among other fetishes.

In the 1993 Spanish movie, ''[[The Bilingual Lover]]'', written and directed by [[Vicente Aranda]] from an adaptation from a novel by [[Juan Marsé]], shoe fetishism pervades the whole story.

In the 1995 movie, ''[[While You Were Sleeping (film)|While You Were Sleeping]]'', starring [[Sandra Bullock]], the main character's landlord, played by [[Michael Rispoli]], has a shoe fetish.

In the 2000 Japanese television series, ''[[:ja:バスストップ|Bus Stop]]'', the main character, Musashi, has a strong interest in high heels, and at one point repairs a broken high heel for the woman he is pursuing.

{{Spanish language}}
The term '''Spanish as a second or foreign language''' is the learning or teaching of the [[Spanish language]] for those whose [[first language]] is not Spanish.

==Regional programmes==

===Argentina===
In October 2001, the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology and the Ministry of Foreign Relations, International Commerce and Culture of the Argentine Republic approved the guidelines in order to evaluate the knowledge and use of Spanish as a Second or Foreign Language in [[Argentina]]. Known as the ''''''Resoluciones 919 del MECyT and 3164 MRREECIyC)'''''', it recognised the role of universities in the development of the evaluation.

Meanwhile in 2004, a group of national universities created an inter-university consortium oriented towards the teaching, evaluation and certification of Spanish as a Second or Foreign Language (o '''ELSE''' from the Spanish, '''Español como Lengua Segunda y Extranjera'''), aiming to contribute to political and educational linguistics.

By June of the same year, three national universities (University of Buenos Aires (UBA), Universidad Litoral (UNL) and the University of Córdoba (UNC)) were working together to design and implement the first official examination to measure competence of Spanish as a foreign language. The exam is called CELU ([[Certificate of Use of Language in Spanish]])) and was approved by Resolution 28 in January 2005.

====The Certification of Spanish Language and Use====
{{Main article|Certificate of Use of Language in Spanish}}

The CELU (Certificate of Use of Language in Spanish) is a certificate of competence in the Spanish language from [[Argentina]]. Like the [[DELE]] (Diploma de Español como Lengua Extranjera), it also has international validity. The Certificate can be taken by speakers of any language other than Spanish in order to validate their knowledge of Spanish as a second language in their work or study.

In [[Argentina]] it is the only examination officially recognised by the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Culture. Any speaker who can use Spanish in an effective manner, whose goal is to interact efficiently with the other members of the community can take the CELU, independently of the course or method that was used to learn the language.

===Spain===
'''Español como lengua extranjera''' ('''ELE''') is the term used to refer to various systems used by different learning institutions that teach the [[Spanish language]] to speakers of other languages, like the [[Escuelas Oficiales de Idiomas]] and the [[Instituto Cervantes]].

Following the [[Common European Framework of Reference for Languages]] or the ''CEFR'', these institutions offer examinations that will measure the competence of a learner. There are six exams (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1 and C2) which can be taken independently (i.e. it is not necessary to pass A1 to get B2) no matter the method of instruction used by the learners.

[[Español en Toledo]], a Spanish course started by the University of Castile-La Mancha General Foundation, brings students to monuments and historical sites in the city of [[Toledo, Spain]] for more experiential learning.

====Diplomas de Español como Lengua Extranjera====
The "[[Diplomas de Español como Lengua Extranjera]]" (Certificates of Spanish as a Foreign Language) is an official diploma granted by the [[Instituto Cervantes]] on behalf of the [[Ministry of Education (Spain)|Spanish Ministry of Education]] to evaluate a person's knowledge of [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

There are six levels of qualification, each corresponding to a certain level described by the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages:
#Diploma de Español (Nivel A1) (level A1): This qualification attests to sufficient linguistic ability for a very basic range of the most commonly simple expressions used in the Spanish-speaking world and in order to satisfy immediate needs of a concrete type.
#Diploma de Español (Nivel A2) (level A2): This qualification attests to sufficient linguistic ability for understanding a basic range of the commonly simple and immediate relevance of expressions used in the Spanish-speaking world (basic personal and family information, shopping, local geography, employment).
#Diploma de Español (Nivel B1) (level B1): This qualification attests to sufficient linguistic ability for understanding and responding appropriately in most normal day-to-day situations and for expressing desires and needs in a basic way.
#Diploma de Español (Nivel B2) (level B2:This qualification validates sufficient linguistic ability to get by in average day-to-day situations in normal communication circumstances, which do not require specialized use of the language.
#Diploma de Español (Nivel C1) (level C1): At this level, users are expected to be able to use the structures of a language with ease and fluency. Users are able to adapt their language use to a variety of social situations, and express opinions and take part in discussions
#Diploma de Español (Nivel C2) (level C2): This qualification accredits the necessary linguistic competence to integrate in situations requiring an advanced use of the language and knowledge of the cultural customs embedded within it.

==Resources==

There are a vast number of resources online, including both resources dedicated specifically to the study of Spanish as a second language, as well as more general resources, such as [[Infoling]].&lt;ref name="nuevas_tecs"&gt;{{Citation|author1=M.

In [[respiratory physiology]], '''specific ventilation''' is defined as the ratio of the volume of gas entering a region of the lung (ΔV) following an inspiration, divided by the end-expiratory volume (V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) of that same lung region:

SV = {{frac|ΔV|V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}

It is a dimensionless quantity. For the whole human lung, given an indicative [[tidal volume]] of 0.6 L and a [[functional residual capacity]] of 2.5 L, average SV is of the order of 0.24.

The distribution of specific ventilation within the lung can be inferred using Multiple Breath Washout (MBW) experiments &lt;ref&gt;[http://jap.physiology.org/content/44/3/416.abstract?sid=d898c725-6248-486d-9103-1e7f3984a37d  Lewis et al], S. M. Lewis, J. W. Evans, and A. A. Jalowayski. Continuous distributions of specific ventilation recovered from inert gas washout, Journal of Applied Physiology, 1978 vol. 44 no. 3 416-423&lt;/ref&gt; or imaging techniques such as [[Positron Emission Tomography]] (PET) using &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;N, [[Magnetic Resonance Imaging]] (MRI) using either hyperpolarized gas (&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;[[Helium|He]], &lt;sup&gt;129&lt;/sup&gt;[[Xenon|Xe]]) or proton MRI (oxygen enhanced imaging).

'''''The Profits of Religion: An Essay in Economic Interpretation''''' is a nonfiction book, first published in 1917, by the American novelist and [[muck-raking]] journalist [[Upton Sinclair]]. It is a snapshot of the religious movements in the U.S. before its entry into [[World War I]].

The book is the first of the “Dead Hand” series: six books Sinclair wrote on American [[institution]]s. The series also includes ''[[The Brass Check]]'' (journalism), [[The Goose-step (book)|''The Goose-step'']] (higher education), ''The Goslings'' (elementary and high school education), ''[[Mammonart]]'' (art) and ''Money Writes!'' (literature). The term “Dead Hand” ironically refers to Adam Smith’s concept that allowing an "invisible hand" of individual self-interest to shape economic relations provides the best result for society as a whole.

In this book, Sinclair attacks institutionalized religion as a “source of income to parasites, and the natural ally of every form of oppression and exploitation.”

==Overview==
Most [[clergy]]men are hypocrites, but they are not entirely to blame. Like other men, they are victimized by “the competitive wage-system, which presents them with the alternative to swindle or to starve.”

Sinclair savages the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] establishment for transforming the [[proletarian]] [[Jesus]] into a defender of wealth and privilege, and for a long history of alliance with political power in England and the United States.

Turning to the “nonconforming” [[Protestant]] sects, adherents of "The Church of the Merchants" are focused on achieving prosperity within the existing economic system. So are the devotees of the mostly [[California]]-based ‘new religions’ or ‘cults’, including [[New Thought]].

Sinclair wants to rescue the true message of Jesus, the friend of the poor and brother of all men.

== Style ==
The writing is fluent, vivid and personal. At the same time, almost every paragraph is built upon evidence that includes historic and contemporary quotations, articles, events, and anecdotes. It is not meant to be objective, but to present a compelling case. It reads like the exhaustive oral argument of a very able prosecuting attorney.

== Divisions of the book ==
Note: The chapters of Book Six are listed to give a flavor of Sinclair's writing style.
* Book One: The Church of the Conquerors (Priesthoods living off the wealth produced by workers)
* Book Two: The Church of Good Society ([[Episcopal Church (United States)|Protestant Episcopal]])
* Book Three: The Church of the Servant Girls ([[Catholic Church|Catholic]])
* Book Four: The Church of the Slavers (how institutionalized religion, particularly in Germany, oppresses the people)
* Book Five: The Church of the Merchants (nonconformist [[Protestantism|Protestant]])
* Book Six: The Church of the Quacks
** Tabula Rasa
** The Book of [[Mormonism|Mormon]]
** [[Holy Roller|Holy Rolling]]
** Bible Prophecy
** [[Koreshanity]]
** [[Mazdaznan]]
** Black Magic
** Mental Malpractice
** [[Christian Science|Science and Wealth]]
** New Nonsense
** "Dollars Want Me!"
** Spiritual Financiering
** The Graft of Grace
* Book Seven: The Church of the Social Revolution (based on Jesus the proletarian and brother of all humankind)

== Critical reception ==
Reviewing several of the Dead Hand series, a contemporary critic wrote, "These great pamphlets…are storehouses of laborious research. They are indispensable to any student of present American life. I have heard Upton Sinclair charged with reckless, inaccurate and indiscreet use of his material. I am glad to say here that in my own experience I have found him scrupulously anxious, at whatever trouble to himself, to report the exact facts and to weigh carefully his judgments upon them. Why, then, have not these books the authority which they should have?…His explanation is oversimplified; he tends to see his facts in the light of a single motive." &lt;ref name="Lovett"&gt;[[Robert Morss Lovett|Lovett, Robert Morss]], "Upton Sinclair," ''The English Journal'' 17 (9) (Nov., 1928), 706–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Brass Check'' (1919), Sinclair wrote, "''The Profits of Religion'' was practically boycotted by the capitalist press of America. Just one newspaper, the ''Chicago Daily News'', reviewed it—or rather allowed me space in which to review it myself. Just one religious publication, the ''Churchman,'' took the trouble to ridicule it at length. Half a dozen others sneered at it in brief paragraphs, and half a dozen newspapers did the same, and that was all the publicity the book got, except in the radical press."

Her dreams become haunted by a shadowy figure, the mythical Travelling Artist. This lonely wanderer, it’s whispered, has roamed the world for over a century in pursuit of his creative visions. Can such a man exist? And if he does, will his powers be able to rescue Lucy from sadness and what form will salvation take?

== Cast ==

* Holly- Marie Laurence as Lucy Snow
* Simon Baker as The Travelling Artist
* Poppy Flanagan as Lucy's mother

'''Urban planning''' is a technical and political process concerned with the development and [[design]] of [[land use]] and the built environment, including air, water, and the [[urban infrastructure|infrastructure]] passing into and out of [[urban area]]s, such as [[transportation]], [[communication]]s, and [[distribution network]]s&lt;ref name="WIUP"&gt;{{Cite web|title=What is Urban Planning |publisher=School of Urban Planning, [[McGill University]] |url=https://mcgill.ca/urbanplanning/planning |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080108061506/https://mcgill.ca/urbanplanning/planning |archive-date =8 January 2008 |dead-url=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;and the provision of municipal services to residents and visitors.

It is closely related to the field of [[urban design]] and some urban planners provide designs for streets, parks, buildings and other urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;Van Assche, K., Beunen, R., Duineveld, M., &amp; de Jong, H. (2013). Co-evolutions of planning and design: Risks and benefits of design perspectives in planning systems. Planning Theory, 12(2), 177-198.&lt;/ref&gt; Urban planning is also referred to as '''urban and regional planning''', '''regional planning''', '''town planning''', '''city planning''', '''rural planning''', '''urban development''' or some combination in various areas worldwide&lt;ref&gt;Watson, V., 2016.

Urban planning guides orderly development in urban, [[suburb]]an and [[rural area]]s. Although predominantly concerned with the planning of [[Human settlement|settlements]] and communities, urban planning is also responsible for the planning and development of [[water use]] and resources, rural and agricultural land, parks and conserving areas of natural environmental significance. [[Urban planner|Practitioners of urban planning]] are concerned with research and analysis, strategic thinking,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[architecture]], urban design, [[public consultation]], policy recommendations, implementation and management.&lt;ref name="Taylor" /&gt; Enforcement methodologies include governmental [[zoning]], [[planning permission]]s, and [[building code]]s,&lt;ref name="WIUP" /&gt; as well as private [[easements]] and [[restrictive covenant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Smit |first1=Anneke |last2=Valiante |first2=Marcia |year=2015 |chapter=Introduction |editor1-last=Smit |editor1-first=Anneke |editor2-last=Valiante |editor2-first=Marcia |title=Public Interest, Private Property: Law and Planning Policy in Canada |location=Vancouver, British Columbia |publisher=[[University of British Columbia Press]] |pages=1–36, page 10 |isbn=978-0-7748-2931-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Urban planners work with the cognate fields of architecture, [[landscape architecture]], [[civil engineering]], and [[public administration]] to achieve strategic, policy and sustainability goals. Early urban planners were often members of these cognate fields. Today urban planning is a separate, independent professional discipline. The discipline is the broader category that includes different sub-fields such as [[land-use planning]], [[zoning]], [[economic development]], [[environmental planning]], and [[transportation planning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What Is Planning? |publisher=American Planning Association |url=https://www.planning.org/aboutplanning/whatisplanning.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150310195220/https://www.planning.org/aboutplanning/whatisplanning.htm |archive-date=10 March 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Further|History of urban planning|}}

There is evidence of urban planning and designed communities dating back to the [[Mesopotamia]]n, [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley]], [[Minoan Civilization|Minoan]], and [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] civilizations in the [[3rd millennium BC|third millennium BCE]].  Archeologists studying the ruins of cities in these areas find paved streets that were laid out at right angles in a grid pattern.&lt;ref name=Davreu1&gt;Davreu, Robert (1978). "Cities of Mystery: The Lost Empire of the Indus Valley". ''The World’s Last Mysteries''. (second edition). Sydney: Readers’ Digest. pp. 121-129. {{ISBN|0-909486-61-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of a planned out urban area evolved as different civilizations adopted it.  Beginning in the 8th century BCE, Greek city states were primarily centered on orthogonal (or grid-like) plans.&lt;ref&gt;Kolb, Frank (1984). Die Stadt im Altertum. München: Verlag C.H. Beck. pp. 51-141: Morris, A.E.J. (1972). History of Urban Form. Prehistory to the Renaissance. London. pp. 22-23.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ancient Rome|ancient Romans]], inspired by the Greeks, also used orthogonal plans for their cities.  City planning in the Roman world was developed for military defense and public convenience.  The spread of the Roman Empire subsequently spread the ideas of urban planning.  As the Roman Empire declined, these ideas slowly disappeared.  However, many cities in Europe still held onto the planned Roman city center.  Cities in Europe from the 9th to 14th centuries, often grew organically and sometimes chaotically. But in the following centuries some newly created towns were built according to preconceived plans, and many others were enlarged with newly planned extensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://dare.uva.nl/en/record/336940|title=The foundation, planning and building of new towns in the 13th and 14th centuries in Europe. An architectural-historical research into urban form and its creation.|last=Boerefijn|first=Wim|publisher=Phd. thesis Universiteit van Amsterdam|year=2010|isbn=978-90-9025157-8|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 15th century on, much more is recorded of urban design and the people that were involved. In this period, theoretical treatises on architecture and urban planning start to appear in which theoretical questions are addressed and designs of towns and cities are described and depicted. During the Enlightenment period, several European rulers ambitiously attempted to redesign capital cities.  During the [[Second French Republic]], [[Baron Georges-Eugène Haussmann]], under the direction of [[Napoleon III]], redesigned the city of [[Paris]] into a more modern capital, with long, straight, wide boulevards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jordan|first1=David|title=Baron Haussmann and Modern Paris|journal=American Scholar|date=1992|volume=61|issue=1|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Planning and architecture went through a paradigm shift at the turn of the 20th century. The industrialized cities of the 19th century grew at a tremendous rate. The pace and style of this industrial construction was largely dictated by the concerns of private business. The evils of urban life for the [[working poor]] were becoming increasingly evident as a matter for public concern. The [[laissez-faire]] style of government management of the economy, in fashion for most of the [[Victorian era]], was starting to give way to a [[Social liberalism|New Liberalism]] that championed intervention on the part of the poor and disadvantaged. Around 1900, theorists began developing urban planning models to mitigate the consequences of the [[industrial age]], by providing citizens, especially factory workers, with healthier environments.

At the beginning of the 20th century, urban planning began to be recognized as a profession. The [[Town and Country Planning Association]] was founded in 1899 and the first academic course in Great Britain on urban planning was offered by the [[University of Liverpool]] in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;Fainstein, Susan S. {{Britannica|619445|Urban planning}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s, the ideas of [[modernism]] and uniformity began to surface in urban planning, and lasted until the 1970s.  Many planners started to believe that the ideas of modernism in urban planning led to higher crime rates and social problems.&lt;ref name="Midgley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Morris-1997"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Morris |first=Eleanor Smith |display-authors=etal |year=1997 |title=British Town Planning and Urban Design: Principles and policies |location=[[Harlow]], Essex, Enngland |publisher=[[Longman]] |pages=147–149 |isbn=978-0-582-23496-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Urban planners now focus more on individualism and diversity in urban centers.

==Theories==
{{Further|Theories of urban planning|}}
Planning theory is the body of scientific concepts, definitions, behavioral relationships, and assumptions that define the body of knowledge of urban planning&lt;ref&gt;Watson, V., 2016. Shifting approaches to planning theory: global north and south. Urban Planning, 1(4), pp.32-41.&lt;/ref&gt;. There are eight procedural theories of planning that remain the principal theories of planning procedure today: the rational-comprehensive approach, the incremental approach, the transactive approach, the communicative approach, the advocacy approach, the equity approach, the radical approach, and the humanist or phenomenological approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Whittmore |first=Andrew |date=2 February 2015 |title=How Planners Use Planning Theory |publisher=Planetizen | url = http://www.planetizen.com/node/73570/how-planners-use-planning-theory | accessdate =24 April 2015}} ''citing'' {{Cite journal|last=Whittemore |first=Andrew H. |year=2014 |title=Practitioners Theorize, Too Reaffirming Planning Theory in a Survey of Practitioners’ Theories |journal=Journal of Planning Education and Research |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=76–85 |doi=10.1177/0739456X14563144}})&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical aspects==
{{Further|Technical aspects of urban planning|}}

Technical aspects of urban planning involve the applying scientific, technical processes, considerations and features that are involved in planning for [[land use]], [[urban design]], [[natural resource|natural resources]], [[transport|transportation]], and [[infrastructure]]. Urban planning includes techniques such as: predicting [[population growth]], [[zoning]], geographic mapping and analysis, analyzing park space, surveying the [[water supply]], identifying transportation patterns, recognizing food supply demands, allocating healthcare and social services, and analyzing the impact of land use.

In order to predict how cities will develop and estimate the effects of their interventions, planners use various models. These models can be used to indicate relationships and patterns in demographic, geographic, and economic data. They might deal with short-term issues such as how people move through cities, or long-term issues such as land use and growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=John D. |last=Landis |year=2012 |chapter=Modeling Urban Systems| editor1-last=Weber |editor1-first=Rachel |editor2-last=Crane |editor2-first=Randall |title=The Oxford Handbook of Urban Planning |location=Oxford, England |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=323–350 |isbn=978-0-19-537499-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Building code]]s and other regulations dovetail with urban planning by governing how cities are constructed and used from the individual level.&lt;ref&gt;''Codes, rules, and standards are part of a matrix of relations that influence the practice of urban planning and design. These forms of regulation provide an important and inescapable framework for development, from the laying out of subdivisions to the control of stormwater runoff. The subject of regulations leads to the source of how communities are designed and constructed—defining how they can and can't be built—and how codes, rules, and standards continue to shape the physical space where we live and work.'' {{Cite book|last=Ben-Joseph |first=Eran |year=2012 |chapter=Codes and Standards in Urban Planning and Design | editor1-last=Weber |editor1-first=Rachel |editor2-last=Crane |editor2-first=Randall |title=The Oxford Handbook of Urban Planning |location=Oxford, England |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=352–370 |isbn=978-0-19-537499-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Urban planners==
{{Further|Urban planner|}}
An urban planner is a professional who works in the field of urban planning for the purpose of optimizing the effectiveness of a community's land use and infrastructure. They formulate plans for the development and management of urban and suburban areas, typically analyzing land use compatibility as well as economic, environmental and social trends. In developing any plan for a community (whether commercial, residential, agricultural, natural or recreational), urban planners must consider a wide array of issues including [[urban sustainability|sustainability]], existing and potential [[pollution]], [[transport]] including potential [[traffic congestion|congestion]], [[crime]], land values, economic development, social equity, [[zoning]] codes, and other legislation.

The importance of the urban planner is increasing in the 21st century, as modern society begins to face issues of increased population growth, climate change and unsustainable development. An urban planner could be considered a [[Green-collar worker|green collar]] professional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kamenetz |first1=Anya |title=Ten Best Green Jobs for the Next Decade |website=fastcompany |publisher=Fast Company |accessdate=14 January 2009 |url=https://www.fastcompany.com/1129671/ten-best-green-jobs-next-decade |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120826065655/https://www.fastcompany.com/1129671/ten-best-green-jobs-next-decade |dead-url=yes |archivedate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers suggest that urban planners around the world work in different "[[planning cultures]]", adapted to their local cities and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Friedman |first=John |year=2012 |chapter=Varieties of Planning Experience: Toward a Globalized Planning Culture? | editor1-last=Weber |editor1-first=Rachel |editor2-last=Crane |editor2-first=Randall |title=The Oxford Handbook of Urban Planning |location=Oxford, England |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=87–98 |isbn=978-0-19-537499-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, professionals have identified skills, abilities and basic knowledge sets that are common to urban planners across national and regional boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Institutes of Certified Planners Certification|url=https://www.planning.org/aicp/|website=American Planning Association|publisher=American Planning Association|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Professional standards|url=http://www.rtpi.org.uk/membership/professional-standards/|website=Royal Institute of Town Planners|publisher=Royal Town Planning Institute|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About ISOCARP|url=https://isocarp.org/about-isocarp/|publisher=International Society of City and Regional Planners|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Where Do Teenagers Come From?''' was an American television teen comedy/documentary that aired as an ''[[ABC Afterschool Special]]'' on March 5, 1980. The live action/animation  program was produced by [[DePatie-Freleng Enterprises]] and was a sequel to the 1977 program ''[[My Mom's Having a Baby]].'' The special was notable for its signature song "Growing Up," written by Doug Goodwin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvmusicmuseum.com/documents/612.html From TV Music Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Premise==
When 12-year-old Kelly begins to experience changes in her body, she, along with Petey and Oscar,  once again visit Dr. Lendon Smith, who uses an animated film that explains in detail (via Smith's narraration) of how teenagers, especially young girls, experience adolescence and how her body changes.

==Critical reception==
As with the first outing, it also had its share of criticism for using a daytime program to showcase what was seen as [[sex education]]. However, this sequel was not as popular as the first outing.

==Cast==
*Shane Sinutko as Petey Evans
*Jarred Johnson as Oskar
*Rachael Longaker as Kelly
*[[Lendon Smith]] as himself
*Stephanie Steele as Julie

The Zambia Forestry College (ZFC) was established in 1949 to provide technical training in forestry. In the same year it produced the first forest guards.

In the following year, Forest Rangers were trained. The College has since been growing to cope with the changing demand for natural resource trained staff. By 1963, over 300 Forest Rangers (Certificate holders) and Forest Guards had been trained.

Training for Foresters (Diploma holders) commenced in 1963 with nine (9) students.  By the end of 1977, 131 Foresters and one (1) female Forester completed her training successfully signifying that this field was gender friendly. The college has now been upgraded with equipment, facilities and staff.
