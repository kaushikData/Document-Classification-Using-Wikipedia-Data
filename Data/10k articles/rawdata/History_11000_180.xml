'''Agatharchides''' or '''Agatharchus''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἀγαθαρχίδης}} or {{lang|grc|Ἀγάθαρχος}}, ''Agatharchos'') of [[Cnidus]] was a [[ancient Greece|Greek]] [[historian]] and [[geographer]] (flourished 2nd century BC).

==Life==
Agatharchides is believed to have been born at [[Cnidus]], hence his appellation. As [[Stanley M. Burstein]] notes, the "evidence for Agatharchides' life is meagre." [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]] describes him as a ''threptos'', a kind of assistant of servile origin, to [[Cinnaeus]] and states that he was later a secretary to [[Heraclides Lembus]]. Cinnaeus served as a counselor to [[Ptolemy VI]]; Heraclides is best known for negotiating the treaty that ended [[Antiochus IV]]'s invasion of [[Egypt]] in 169 BC.

Agatharchides furnishes few clues about his own life. At the conclusion of his ''On the Erythraean Sea'', he apologizes for being unable to complete his work "since our age is unable to similarly bear the toil" and "as a result of the disturbances in Egypt" he could no longer access the official records (a fragment cited by Photius in his ''Bibliotheca'' Cod. 250.110, 460b). There are two possible occasions when this could have happened: the first was in 145 BC, when [[Ptolemy VIII]] purged [[Alexandria, Egypt|Alexandria]] of the intellectuals who supported his rivals for the throne; and in 132 BC after Ptolemy, who had been driven from his kingdom by a rebellion in Alexandria, returned and exacted reprisals on that city. While most scholars have favored the later date, Burstein argues for the earlier one.

Extracts from the first book of his ''Erythraean Sea'', written in the first person and advocating a military campaign into the lands south of Egypt, led early scholars to deduce that Agatharchides was an important political figure of his time, and served as a guardian to one of the sons of Ptolemy VIII. [[Edward Dodwell|Dodwell]] endeavored to show that it the younger son, Alexander, and objects to [[Ptolemy IX Lathyros|Soter]], that he reigned conjointly with his mother. This, however, was the case with [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] likewise. [[Henk Wesseling|Wesseling]] and [[Henry Fynes Clinton]] think the elder brother to be the one meant, for Soter was more likely to have been a minor on his accession in 117 BC than Alexander in 107 BC, ten years after their father's death; the second edition of the ''[[Oxford Classical Dictionary]]'' article on Agatharchides agrees that the son was Soter. Moreover, Dodwell's date would leave too short an interval between the publication of Agatharchides's work on the [[Erythraean Sea]] (about 113 BC), and the work of [[Artemidorus Ephesius|Artemidorus]]. However at least as early as 1810, when [[B. G. Niebuhr]] pointed out that these excerpts were from a speech, and not part of the narrative of his book, this theory has been recognized as conflicting with other known historical facts.

==Writings==
Agatharchides was not well known in ancient times. Of his two major works, ''Affairs in Asia'' (''Ta kata ten Asian'') in ten books, and ''Affairs in Europe'' (''Ta kata ten Europen'') in forty-nine books, only a few fragments survive, too few to provide us with any sense of the contents of either work. However, for his ''On the Erythraean Sea'' (''Peri tes Erythras thalasses'') in five books, almost the entire fifth book, a geographical treatise on the [[Horn of Africa]] and the lands around the [[Red Sea]], has survived almost intact. According to Burstein, "the comparative soberness of Agatharchides' treatment compared to previous accounts and the wealth of information contained in it led to a quick recognition . . . [that it was] a valuable summary of the results of Ptolemaic exploration."

In the first book of ''On the Erythraean Sea'' was a discussion respecting the origin of the name. In the fifth Agatharchides described the mode of life amongst the [[Sabaeans]] in Arabia, and the [[Ichthyophagi]], or fish-eaters, the way in which [[elephant]]s were caught by the elephant-eaters, and the mode of working the gold mines in the mountains of Egypt, near the [[Red Sea]]. His account of the Ichthyophagi and of the mode of working the gold mines, has been copied by [[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]] (iii.12-18). Amongst other extraordinary animals he mentions the [[camelopard]], which was found in the country of the [[Troglodytae]], and the [[rhinoceros]].

Material from this book is quoted directly or indirectly by [[Diodorus Siculus]], [[Strabo]], [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]] (Claudius Aelianus), [[Josephus]]&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'', Book XII, Chapter 1, 5-6; ''[[Against Apion]]'', Book I, Chapter 22.&lt;/ref&gt; and other authors. Although Agatharchides' work was superseded by more detailed accounts in the 2nd century AD, Photius found a copy of ''Erythraean Sea'' in the 10th century, from which he preserved extensive extracts in his ''Bibliotheca''. Photius states that Agatharchides wrote in the [[Attic Greek|Attic dialect]], with a style that was dignified and perspicuous, and abounded in sententious passages—inspiring a favorable opinion from Photius. In the composition of his speeches Agatharchides was an imitator of [[Thucydides]], whom he equalled in dignity and excelled in clearness. He was acquainted with the language of the Aethiopians (''de Rubr. M.'' p.&amp;nbsp;46), and appears to have been the first who discovered the true cause of the yearly inundations of the [[Nile]]. (Diod. i. 41.)

An Agatharchides, of [[Samos Island|Samos]], is mentioned by [[Plutarch]], as the author of a work on [[Persia]], and one περὶ λίθων. [[Johann Albert Fabricius|J.A. Fabricius]], however, conjectures that the true reading is [[Agathyrsides]], not Agatharchides. (Dodwell in Hudson's ''Geogr. Script. Gr. Minores''; Clinton, ''Fasti Hell.'' iii, p.&amp;nbsp;535.)

==Honour==
The crater [[Agatharchides (crater)|Agatharchides]] on the [[Moon]] is named in his honour.

'''Agathon Jean François Fain''' (January 11, 1778{{snd}}September 16, 1837) was a [[France|French]] [[historian]].

He was born in [[Paris]], [[France]]. Having gained admittance to the offices of the [[French Directory|Directory]], he became head of a ''[[département in France|département]]''. Under the [[French Consulate]] he entered the office of the secretary of state, in the department of the archives. In 1806 he was appointed secretary and archivist to the ''cabinet particulier'' of the emperor, whom he attended on his campaigns and journeys. He was created a [[baron]] of the empire in 1809, and, on the fall of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]], was first secretary of the cabinet and confidential secretary.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Fain, Agathon Jean François|volume=1|pages=126-127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compelled by the [[Bourbon Dynasty, Restored|second Restoration]] to retire into private life, he devoted his leisure to writing the history of his times, an occupation for which his previous employments well fitted him. He published successively ''{{lang|fr|Manuscrit de l'an 1814, contenant l'histoire des six derniers mois du régime de Napoléon}}'' (1823; new edition with illustrations, 1906); ''{{lang|fr|Manuscrit de l'an 1814, trouvé dans les voitures impériales prises à Waterloo}}'' (Paris 1823); ''{{lang|fr|Manuscrit de l'an 1813, contenant le précis des évènements de cette année pour servir à l'histoire de l'empereur Napoléon}}'' (1824); ''{{lang|fr|Manuscrit de l'an 1812}}'' (1827); and ''{{lang|fr|Manuscrit de l'an III (1794-95), contenant les premieres transactions de l'Europe avec la république française et le tableau des derniers governements du régime conventionnel}}'' (1828), all of which are remarkable for accuracy and wide range of knowledge, and are a very valuable source for the history of Napoleon.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Of still greater importance for the history of Napoleon are Fain's ''{{lang|fr|Mémoires du Baron Fain, Premier Secrétaire du Cabinet de l'Empereur}}'', which were published posthumously in 1908; they relate more particularly to the last five years of the empire, and give a detailed picture of the emperor at work on his correspondence among his confidential secretaries.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; The first English edition, ''Napoleon: How He Did It - The Memoirs of Baron Fain, First Secretary of the Emperor's Cabinet'', was published in 1998.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Immediately after the overthrow of [[Charles X of France|Charles X]], [[Louis-Philippe of France|King Louis Philippe]] appointed Fain first secretary of his cabinet (August 1830). Fain was a member of the council of state and deputy from [[Montargis]] from 1834 until his death, which occurred in Paris on the 16 September 1837.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

'''Alexander Ivanovich Mikhailovsky-Danilevsky''' ({{lang-ru|Алекса́ндр Ива́нович Михайло́вский-Даниле́вский}}; {{OldStyleDate|8 September|1789|26 August}}{{spaced ndash}}{{OldStyleDate|21 September|1848|9 September}})) was a Russian Lieutenant General, senator, military writer, historian and author of the first official history of the [[War of 1812]], written in four volumes on the instructions of [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]].

==Biography==
Alexander's father [[Ivan Mikhailovsky-Danilevsky]] was a known doctor of [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] origin who studied at the [[University of Göttingen]] and briefly worked in 1789 at the Russian Ministry of Finance. Alexander studied German at [[Saint Peter's School]] joined the [[Saint Petersburg]] militia on 1 August 1812 and was chosen by Field Marshal [[Mikhail Kutuzov]], an adjutant, mainly for correspondence in French. He fought in the [[Battle of Borodino]] and in the [[Battle of Tarutino]] where he was critically wounded.&lt;ref name="Mikaberidze2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Alexander Mikaberidze]]|title=Russian Officer Corps of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j2BwBPz4QFQC&amp;pg=PA254|accessdate=25 July 2013|date=19 January 2005|publisher=Casemate Publishers|isbn=978-1-61121-002-6|pages=254–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, in September 1814 Mikhailovsky-Danilevsky was a member of the Russian delegation at the [[Congress of Vienna]] and remained until its end in June 1815. In 1816, he was appointed [[Aide-de-camp]] to the [[Alexander I of Russia|Emperor]], who was accompanied on his travels to the south and Russia to the congress in Aachen.&lt;ref name="Mikaberidze2005" /&gt;

In 1829, he participated in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1828–29)|Russo-Turkish War of 1828–29]] serving with the rank of major general under the command of Field Marshal [[Hans Karl von Diebitsch]]. He was critically wounded in the [[Battle of Olszynka Grochowska]] on 25 February 1830.&lt;ref name="Mikaberidze2005" /&gt;

On 6 December 1835 he was promoted to [[Lieutenant general]] and on 9 December he was appointed chairman of the Military Censorship Committee. In 1839 he became a senator and as such, he was appointed as a member of the council of war, where he tried to end his life to reform the army.&lt;ref name="Mikaberidze2005" /&gt;

He became a member of Emperor's Council of War in 1839 and of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Imperial Academy of Sciences]] in 1843. He died in September 1848 in the [[Saint Petersburg cholera epidemic of 1847–1849]]. He was buried next to his wife (d. 1832) at the [[Tikhvin Cemetery]] of the [[Alexander Nevsky Lavra|Alexander Nevsky Monastery]], where their tomb is preserved.&lt;ref name="Mikaberidze2005" /&gt;

'''Anatole A. Klyosov''' (born 20 November 1946 in [[Chernyakhovsk]], [[Kaliningrad Oblast]] of [[Russian SFSR]])&lt;ref name=mgu/&gt; is a scientist who worked in the fields of physical chemistry, enzyme catalysis, and industrial biochemistry. In 1989 Klyosov immigrated to the US.  He spent most of his career developing ways to use [[enzymes]] to convert agricultural waste products into useful products — first to convert cotton waste to glucose in the USSR, and later in the US, turning paper mill waste into useful products.  He later helped found a company, and later joined it as CSO, that was founded to use enzymes to alter existing [[anticancer drug]]s via [[glycosylation]]. In 2008 he began publishing work about what he calls "DNA genealogy" that has been dismissed as [[pseudoscience]].

== Career ==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2435">'''Andreas of Bergamo''' ({{lang-la|Andreas Bergomas}}) was an Italian historian of the late ninth century. He composed a continuation of the ''Historia Langobardorum'' of [[Paul the Deacon]] down to ca. 877. The short continuation, untitled in the manuscripts, is sometimes called the ''Andreæ presbyteri Bergomatis chronicon'' (chronicle of Andreas the priest of Bergamo). All that is known of Andreas is that he was a priest of the [[diocese of Bergamo]] that he helped carry the coffin of the [[Louis II of Italy|Emperor Louis II]] from the river [[River Oglio|Oglio]] as far as the [[Adda river|Adda]] in 875.&lt;ref name=Berto&gt;Luigi Andrea Berto, [http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/2213-2139_emc_SIM_00099 "Andreas of Bergamo"] in ''Encyclopedia of the Medieval Chronicle'', edited by Graeme Dunphy, Cristian Bratu. Consulted online on 16 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; He identified as a both a [[Lombards|Lombard]] and a [[Franks|Frank]].&lt;ref&gt;Simon MacLean, ''Kingship and Politics in the Late Ninth Century: Charles the Fat and the end of the Carolingian Empire'' (Cambridge University Press, 2003), 60–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Andreas' chronicle is an important primary source for contemporary Italy, especially the [[Po valley]]. It is the best source for the succession dispute following the death of the Louis II.

His chronicle does not have a prologue or a dedication. It begins with the arrival of the Lombards in Italy under [[Alboin]] (568–72), but down to the reign of [[Liutprand of the Lombards|Liutprand]] (712–44) it is just a summary of Paul the Deacon's work. From Liutprand on, it is an original work. It concerns itself mainly with high politics and the acts of the [[Carolingian]] rulers of northern Italy, as well as Louis II's campaigns in southern Italy.&lt;ref name=Berto/&gt;

'''Arnulf of Milan''', or '''Arnulfus Mediolanensis''' (flourished c. 1085) was a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] chronicler of events in Northern Italy. He was the great-nephew of [[Arnulf II (archbishop of Milan)|Archbishop Arnulf II of Milan]].&lt;ref&gt;L. Fasola, ‘Arnulf von Mailand, Chronist,’ in ''Lexikon des Mittelalters'' (Munich, 1980), 1, p. 1020.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arnulf is known for his work in five books, named ''Liber gestorum recentium'', a "book of the deeds of recent times" (written 1072-1077). Arnulf describes his labour in the first book as "a simple narrative, offered in everyday speech, of the deeds accomplished by our kings, our bishops, and our fellow citizens from Milan and beyond, as well as our compatriots in the Kingdom of Italy, which I myself have seen or somehow heard from either those who saw them or those slightly later."&lt;ref&gt;Quotations are from W. North's translation of the text edited by Claudia Zey.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most Christian chroniclers of [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[Early Middle Ages]], Arnulf did not begin with the Creation ("Nevertheless, leaving aside antiquity, let us begin from recent memory") - the ''Liber gestorum recentium'' is a contemporary account of his times, as seen from the [[archbishopric of Milan]].

Arnulf's history begins in 925, with [[Hugh of Arles|Hugh of Arles ("Hugh of the Burgundians")]] reigning as [[King of Italy]] and exercising his right to appoint an [[archbishop of Milan]]. It covers the years of the [[Gregorian reform]]s, the reform movement of the Milanese [[Pataria|Patarenes]], and the [[Investiture Controversy]]. It ends with the kingship granted to [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld]] as [[anti-king]] of the Germans (1077).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6836">'''Arthur West Haddan''' (1816–1873) was an English churchman and academic, of High Church Anglican views, now remembered as an ecclesiastical historian, particularly for ''Councils and Ecclesiastical Documents relating to Great Britain and Ireland'', written with [[William Stubbs]].

==Life==

He was born at [[Woodford, Essex]] on 31 August 1816, the son of Thomas Haddan, solicitor, and Mary Ann his wife and second cousin, whose maiden name was also Haddan. [[Thomas Henry Haddan]] was his brother. He received his early education at a private school kept by a Mr. Fanning at [[Finchley]]. In 1834 he entered [[Brasenose College, Oxford]], as a commoner, and in the November of that year stood unsuccessfully for a scholarship at [[Balliol College]], but was elected scholar of [[Trinity College, Oxford]]. 15 June 1835. He graduated B.A. in 1837, obtaining a first-class in classics and a second in mathematics, proceeded M.A. in due course, and took the degree of B.D.

After graduating he applied himself to theology, and in 1839 was elected to the university Johnson theological scholarship, and to a fellowship at his college. He was deeply affected by the religious revival at Oxford, and was much influenced by [[Isaac Williams]], then a tutor of Trinity. At Trinity the effect of the [[tractarian]] movement was to lead some adherents to the study of history in order, in the first instance, to maintain the historical position and claims of the church. Haddan was a loyal Anglican who defended its apostolic character. Having been ordained [[deacon]] on his fellowship in 1840, he acted for about a year as [[curate]] of the church of [[St. Mary the Virgin, Oxford]], to [[John Henry Newman]]. He was ordained priest in 1842, and on being appointed to succeed Williams as classical tutor of his college, resigned his curacy.

He was Dean of Trinity College for several years and afterwards vice-president, and was pro-proctor to [[Henry Peter Guillemard]] when in 1845 the proctors put their veto on the proceedings against Newman. An austere scholar, for some time after his ordination he was engaged in work for the [[Library of Anglo-Catholic Theology]]. From the date of its first publication in 1846 he wrote much for ''[[The Guardian (Anglican newspaper)|The Guardian]]'', the High Church weekly, and he also sent many reviews to the ''[[Christian Remembrancer]]''. The judgment on the [[Gorham case]] in 1850 troubled him, and for a while he doubted whether he could conscientiously accept a benefice; he found csatisfaction through studying the foundation of the Church of England's claims. Some of the results of his studies on this subject were afterwards embodied in his book on the [[apostolic succession]] in the Church of England. In this work, besides stating the nature of the doctrine, its importance, and its scriptural basis, he refuted the [[Nag's Head fable]], which he had already worked on in his edition of [[John Bramhall]]'s works, concluding the validity of Anglican orders.

In 1847 Haddan was one of the secretaries of [[William Ewart Gladstone]]'s election committee, and supported him on the three other occasions when he sought election as a Member of Parliament for the University of Oxford; his support. was because he believed that Gladstone was a fitting representative of the university as a scholar and a churchman. On similar grounds he supported Lord Derby's election as chancellor in 1852. In 1857 he accepted the college living of [[Barton-on-the-Heath]] in [[Warwickshire]], and left Oxford to reside there with two sisters. He was appointed [[Bampton Lecturer]] in 1863, but was forced to resign the appointment by ill-health. Early in 1869 he brought out, in conjunction with William Stubbs, the first volume of the major work, ''Councils and Ecclesiastical Documents'', founded on the collections of [[Henry Spelman]] and [[David Wilkins (orientalist)|David Wilkins]]. For the contents of this volume he was mainly responsible, and during that and the following year he assisted in the preparation of the third volume; but his health was failing, and the publication of the second volume, which fell to him, was delayed. The part of this volume which is devoted to the early Irish church, and required research into language as well as history, occupied him during his last days. At the same time he was writing articles on church organisation in the first volume of [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]]'s ''[[Dictionary of Christian Antiquities]]''. He died at Barton-on-the-Heath on 8 February 1873, at the age of fifty-six. He never received any preferment save the living which came to him from his college, and the title of honorary canon of Worcester.

==Works==

His published works are:

*An edition of the works of [[John Bramhall]], archbishop of Armagh, with life, Anglo-Catholic Library, 5 vols., 1842–5.
*An edition of [[Herbert Thorndike]]'s ‘Theological Works,’ with life, Anglo-Catholic Library, 6 vols., 1844–56.
* Two sermons preached before the university of Oxford, issued separately, 1850 and 1862.
* Essay No. 6 in ‘Replies to Essays and Reviews,’ ‘Rationalism,’ a reply to [[Mark Pattison (academic)|Mark Pattison]]'s essay, 1862. Pattison, who was one of his intimate friends, read the proofs of this article for him.
* ‘Apostolical Succession in the Church of England,’ 1869, 1879, 1883.
* Essay No. 6 in the ‘Church and the Age,’ ‘English Divines of the 16th and 17th Centuries,’ 1870.
* ‘Councils and Ecclesiastical Documents,’ i. ii. pts. 1 and 2, iii., in conjunction with William Stubbs, 1869–73.
* A translation of [[Augustine of Hippo]]'s ''[[De Trinitate]]'',’ Clark's ‘Edinburgh Series,’ vol. vii., 1871.
* A short paper on ‘Registration and Baptism.’

He also wrote articles and reviews. Many of his shorter writings are collected in ''Remains of A. W. Haddan'', edited by [[Alexander Penrose Forbes]], [[bishop of Brechin]], 1876, with a short ''Life'' by Haddan's brother Thomas, an obituary article from the ''Guardian'' newspaper of 12 February 1873 by [[Richard William Church]], [[dean of St. Paul's]], and a list of works.

'''''Bad Company''''' is a 2002 American-Czech [[action film|action]] [[comedy film|comedy]] [[thriller film]] directed by [[Joel Schumacher]], produced by [[Jerry Bruckheimer]] and starring [[Anthony Hopkins]] and [[Chris Rock]]. The film became somewhat famous for its connections to the [[September 11th terrorist attacks]]; amongst other things, it was the last major production to film inside the former [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]]. The film plot, written years before the attacks, involved a variety of Serbo-Balkan extremists (including a man from [[Afghanistan]]) planning a huge attack in [[New York City]]. The movie's release date was moved out of its late 2001 spot and into a summer 2002 release, similar to several other films with terrorism or violent crime-related stories, including ''[[Collateral Damage (film)|Collateral Damage]]'' and ''[[Training Day]]''.

==Plot==
When a mission to retrieve a stolen suitcase [[bomb]] goes bad, [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) agent Kevin Pope (Rock) is killed. Pope was working undercover as an antiquities dealer under the name Michael Turner. The CIA, which is desperate to complete the mission, discovers that Agent Pope had a twin brother, Jake Hayes (also Rock), from whom he was separated at birth; their mother died giving birth and Hayes suffered from a severe lung infection that prompted the doctors to separate them because they felt that Hayes was unlikely to live for very long. Hayes hustles chess games, scalps tickets and works at small clubs in [[Jersey City, New Jersey]] to make ends meet. Meanwhile, Hayes's girlfriend, Julie ([[Kerry Washington]]) grows tired of waiting for him to grow up and decides to move to [[Seattle]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]].

After the CIA successfully persuades Hayes to participate and begins to train Hayes for a mission that is to take place in [[Prague]],  [[Czech Republic]], they are initially dismayed by his lack of refinement. Agent Oakes (Hopkins) confronts Hayes, telling him he doesn't trust him. When Hayes begins paying attention, the CIA sets him up in his brother's old apartment in [[Manhattan]] to test him and try to bait the men who killed his brother. Hayes is attacked, but escapes unharmed. Looking for a way out, Hayes goes to his foster mother only to be found by Oakes, who persuades him to finish the mission.

After arriving in Prague, Hayes - posing as his dead brother - meets with the men selling the suitcase bomb. The seller, Adrik Vas, is an ex-Russian Army Colonel with ties to the [[Russian Mafia]]. When they return to their hotel, Hayes is greeted by his brother's ex-girlfriend Nicole ([[Garcelle Beauvais]]). Believing Hayes is his brother, she dines with him and returns to his hotel, where the couple is ambushed by rival buyers. Nicole figures out that Hayes isn't his brother and returns to her assignment covering the Balkans for [[CNN]].

Moving forward with the plans, Hayes and Oakes meet up with Vas and are able to steal the arming codes. Just as they close the deal, Vas' men double cross them with the rival buyer. When the rival dealers, who are part of a multi-national terrorist organization, learn they can't detonate the bomb because of the missing codes, they kidnap Julie. Hayes gives himself up trying to save his girlfriend, and the terrorists get the codes back and arm the bomb.

Now the race begins to find Hayes and the bomb. After interrogating one of the captured terrorists, they track the bomb to [[Grand Central Station]]. With the clock ticking, they locate the bomb and the terrorist leader Dragan Adjanic ([[Matthew Marsh (actor)|Matthew Marsh]]), who has started the countdown. Oakes rescues Hayes by killing two terrorists. As Hayes starts to enter the codes to disarm the bomb, Adjanic holds Julie hostage. In order to distract Adjanic, Hayes pretends to shoot Oakes, and they kill Adjanic by shooting him repeatedly. Hayes is able to disarm the bomb just prior to detonation.

At the ending of the film, Hayes visits the memorial for deceased secret agents to visit his brother's grave. Later on, Oakes comes up to Hayes at Hayes's wedding and warns him that a dangerous criminal has escaped from prison and is seeking revenge upon Kevin Pope, but since Kevin is dead and Hayes was impersonating him, the criminal thinks Hayes is Kevin. Hayes begins to panic and demand that Oakes has to protect him, but Oakes starts laughing as he reveals that it was just a joke and he really just came for the wedding and also giving him a honey moon trip as a wedding gift.

==Reception==

=== Box office ===
''Bad Company'' failed to recoup its budget at the box office, earning only $30,160,161 in the United States and $35,817,134 outside the US for a worldwide total of $65,977,295.&lt;ref name="mojo"&gt;{{cite web

=== Critical response ===
The film was panned by critics. Review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a score of 10% based on 133 reviews; the site's critical consensus stated [that both] "Chris Rock and Anthony Hopkins fail to generate the sparks necessary to save the movie from a generic and utterly predictable script."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'' reviewer William Arnold calls the film "wildly overproduced, inadequately motivated every step of the way and demographically targeted to please every one (and no one)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Arnold |first=William |title='Bad Company' is a waste of 111 minutes |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/movies/73579_badcompany07q.shtml |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jNmHPfZO?url=http://www.seattlepi.com/movies/73579_badcompany07q.shtml |publisher=''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'' |date=June 7, 2002 |archivedate=August 29, 2009 |accessdate=August 29, 2009 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] remarks in the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' that the film "jams too many prefabricated story elements into the running time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ebert |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=Bad Company Review |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20020607/REVIEWS/206070301/1023 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jNm3Ksyk?url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20020607%2FREVIEWS%2F206070301%2F1023 |publisher=''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' |date=June 7, 2002 |archivedate=August 29, 2009 |accessdate=August 29, 2009 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On their review show, [[Ebert &amp; Roeper|Ebert and Richard Roeper]] gave it two thumbs down, arguing that it "might have been considered original, had it been made [set] before ''[[48 Hrs.]]'', ''[[Lethal Weapon]]'' and ''[[Rush Hour (1998 film)|Rush Hour]]'' and every other action movie about a racially mixed pair of partners who initially despise each other, but learn to, well, you know the whole drill."{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}&lt;!-- which episode, what date? --&gt;

David Hunter of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' noted the film as having "all the familiar Bruckheimer elements, and Schumacher does probably as good a job as anyone at bringing off the Hopkins/Rock collision of acting styles and onscreen personas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author = Hunter, David |title = Bad Company Review |url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1507378 |publisher = ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' |date = June 5, 2002 |accessdate = August 29, 2009 }} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Belshazzar's feast''', or the story of '''the writing on the wall''' (chapter 5 in the [[Book of Daniel]]) tells how [[Belshazzar]] holds a great feast and drinks from the vessels that had been looted in the destruction of the [[Solomon's Temple|First Temple]]. A hand appears and writes on the wall. The terrified Belshazzar calls for his wise men, but they are unable to read the writing. The queen advises him to send for [[Daniel (biblical figure) |Daniel]], renowned for his wisdom. Daniel reminds Belshazzar that his father [[Nebuchadnezzar]], when he became arrogant, was thrown down until he learned that God has sovereignty over the kingdom of men. Belshazzar had likewise blasphemed God, and so God sent this hand.  Daniel then reads the message and interprets it: God has numbered Belshazzar's days, he has been weighed and found wanting, and his kingdom will be given to the [[Medes]] and the [[Persian people |Persians]].
{{quote |That very night Belshazzar the Chaldean (Babylonian) king was killed, and [[Darius the Mede]] received the kingdom.|Daniel 5:30–31{{sfn |Seow|2003 |pp = 74–75}}}}

The message of Daniel 5 is the contrast it offers between Nebuchadnezzar and Belshazzar:
* Nebuchadnezzar is humbled by God, learns his lesson (he acknowledges the ultimate kingship of the God of Israel), and is restored to his throne;
* Belshazzar, in contrast, learns nothing from Nebuchadnezzar's example, blasphemes against God, and has his kingdom given to others.{{sfn |Albertz|2001 |p= 178}}

Belshazzar's feast is a legend conforming to the subgenre of the "tale of court contest," complicated by the inclusion of Daniel's indictment of Belshazzar's pride and his failure to honour the God of Israel; as a result the tale has a double ending, in which Daniel is first showered with rewards and honours for interpreting the omen, and the king is then punished to fulfill the sentence pronounced by Daniel.{{sfn|Collins|1984|p= 67}}

==Summary==
[[File:Belshazzar’s feast, by Rembrandt.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Rembrandt]], ''[[Belshazzar's Feast (Rembrandt)|Belshazzar's Feast]]'', 1635, ([[National Gallery]], London). The message is written in vertical lines starting at the top right corner, with "upharsin" taking two lines.]]
===Narrative summary===
''This summarizes the narrative, as found in C. L. Seow's translation of the text in his commentary on Daniel.''{{sfn |Seow|2003 |pp = 74–75}}

King Belshazzar holds a great feast for a thousand of his lords, and commands that the Temple vessels from Jerusalem be brought in so that they can drink from them, but as the Babylonians drink, a hand appears and writes on the wall.  Belshazzar calls for his magicians and diviners to interpret the writing, but they are unable even to read them. The queen advises Belshazzar to send for Daniel, renowned for his wisdom. Daniel is brought in, and the king offers to make him third in rank in the kingdom if he can interpret the writing.  Daniel declines the honour, but agrees to the request. He reminds Belshazzar that Nebuchadnezzar's greatness was the gift of God, and that when he became arrogant God threw him down until he learned humility: "the Most High God has sovereignty over the kingdom of mortals, and sets over it whomever He will." Belshazzar has drunk from the vessels of God's Temple and praised his idols, but he has not given honour to God, and so God sent this hand and wrote these words:
&lt;center&gt;
{{quote|{{Hebrew|מנא מנא תקל ופרסין}}}}
&lt;/center&gt;

Daniel reads the words "MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN" and interprets them for the king: "MENE, God has numbered the days of your kingdom and brought it to an end; TEKEL, you have been weighed ... and found wanting;" and "PERES, your kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and Persians. Then Belshazzar gave the command, and Daniel was clothed in purple, a chain of gold was put around his neck, and a proclamation was made… that he should rank third in the kingdom; [and] that very night Belshazzar the Chaldean (Babylonian) king was killed, and [[Darius the Mede]] received the kingdom."{{sfn |Seow|2003 |p = 75}}

===Writing on the wall===
The Chaldean wise men are unable to read the writing on the wall, let alone interpret it, but Daniel does so by supplying vowels in two different ways, first so the words are read as nouns, then as verbs.{{sfn |Seow|2003|p= 80}} The nouns are monetary weights: a ''mənê'', equivalent to a Jewish mina or sixty [[shekel]]s (several ancient versions have only one ''mənê'' instead of two), a ''təqêl'', equivalent to a shekel, and ''p̄arsîn'', meaning "half-pieces".{{sfn |Seow|2003 |pp = 82–83}} The last involves a word-play on the name of the Persians (''pārās'' in Hebrew), suggesting not only that they are to inherit Belshazzar's kingdom, but that they are two peoples, Medes and Persians.{{sfn |Seow|2003 |pp = 82–83}} Daniel then interprets the words as verbs, based on their roots: ''mənê'' is interpreted as meaning "numbered", ''təqêl'', from a root meaning to weigh, as meaning "weighed" (and found wanting), and ''pərês'' ({{Hebrew|פְּרַס}}), the singular form of ''p̄arsîn'', from a root meaning "to divide", denoting that the kingdom is to be "divided" and given to the Medes and Persians.{{sfn |Seow|2003 |p = 83}} If the "half-pieces" means two half-shekels, then the various weights—a ''mənê'' or sixty shekels, another shekel, and two half-shekels—add up to 62, which the tale gives as the age of [[Darius the Mede]], indicating that God's will is being worked out.{{sfn |Seow|2003|p = 84}}

==Composition and structure==
{{Daniel chapters}}
{{main|Book of Daniel#structure}}
It is generally accepted that the [[Book of Daniel]] originated as a collection of [[Folklore|folktale]]s among the Jewish community in Babylon in the Persian and early [[Hellenistic]] periods (5th to 3rd centuries BC), and was later expanded in the [[Maccabeans |Maccabean]] era (mid-2nd century) with the visions of chapters 7–12.{{sfn|Collins|1984| pp= 29, 34–35}}  Modern scholarship agrees that Daniel is a legendary figure,{{sfn|Collins|1984|p= 28}} and it is possible that his name was chosen for the hero of the book because of his reputation as a wise seer in Hebrew tradition.{{sfn|Redditt|2008| pp=176–77, 180}}

Chapters 2–7 of the book form a [[chiasmus |chiasm]] (a poetic structure in which the main point or message of a passage is placed in the centre and framed by further repetitions on either side):{{sfn|Redditt |2008 |p= 177}}
* A. (chapter 2) – A dream of four kingdoms replaced by a fifth
** B. (chapter 3) – Daniel's three friends in the fiery furnace
*** C. (chapter 4) – Daniel interprets a dream for Nebuchadnezzar
*** C'. (chapter 5) – Daniel interprets the handwriting on the wall for Belshazzar
** B'. (chapter 6) – Daniel in the lions' den
* A'. (chapter 7) – A vision of four world kingdoms replaced by a fifth

Daniel 5 is thus composed as a companion-piece to Daniel 4, the tale of the madness of Nebuchadnezzar, the two giving variations on a single theme. This is spelled out in chapter 5 when Daniel draws a direct parallel between the two kings: the fate of Belshazzar illustrates what happens when a king does not repent.{{sfn |Collins|1984| pp=67, 70}}

Daniel 5 does not divide neatly into scenes and scholars do not agree on its structure. The following is one possible outline:{{sfn|Newsom|Breed|2014 |p= 165}}
# The king's banquet and the mysterious oracle: the king desecrates the sacred vessels, the hand writes on the wall (verses 1–6)
# Attempts to interpret the oracle: the Chaldean sages fail, the queen recommends Daniel (verses 7–12)
# Daniel appears before Belshazzar: Daniel addresses and rebukes the king, interprets the oracle, and is rewarded (verses 10–12)
# Conclusion: Belshazzar's death, Darius' accession (verses 30–31)

==Historical background==
The story is set around the fall of Babylon, when on 12 October 539 BCE the [[Achaemenid Persia|Persian]] conqueror [[Cyrus the Great]] entered the city. Its last king, [[Nabonidus]], was captured, and his fate is unknown, although he may have been exiled.{{sfn |Waters |2014|pp =44–45}} Several details in the text do not match the known historical facts.{{sfn |Seow|2003 |pp =4–6}} Belshazzar is portrayed as king of Babylon and son of [[Nebuchadnezzar]], but was actually the son of King Nabonidus, one of Nebuchadnezzar's successors, and never became king.{{sfn |Seow |2003 |pp =4–6}}  The conqueror is named as [[Darius the Mede]], but no such individual is known to history; and the invaders were not Medes, but Persians.{{sfn |Seow|2003|pp =4–6}}  This is typical of the story's genre, in which historical accuracy is not an essential element.{{sfn|Collins|1984|p= 41}}

The constituent elements of the Book of Daniel were assembled shortly after the end of the Maccabean crisis, which is to say shortly after 164 BCE.{{sfn |Collins |2001|p=2}} The tales making up chapters 2 to 6 are the earliest part, dating from the late 4th or early 3rd centuries. Their setting is Babylon, and there is no reason to doubt that they were composed in the Babylonian diaspora (i.e., among the Jewish community living in Babylon and Mesopotamia under Persian and then Greek rule). They reflect a society in which foreign rulers were not necessarily malevolent (Belshazzar rewards Daniel and raises him to high office); this is a marked contrast with the visions of chapters 7–12, where the sufferings of the Jews are the result of actions by the evil 2nd century BCE king [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]].{{sfn|Seow|2003|p= 7}}

Chapters 2 and 7 tell how all worldly kingdoms will come to an end and be replaced by the kingdom of God, and chapters 3 and 6 tell how pious Jews withstand the arrogance of earthly kings and are rescued by the God of Israel. Chapters 4 and 5 form the center and carry the most important message in their parallel but contrasting tales of Nebuchadnezzar and Belshazzar. The first is humbled by God, learns his lesson (he acknowledges the ultimate kingship of the Jewish God), and is restored to his throne; Belshazzar, in contrast, learns nothing from Nebuchadnezzar's example, blasphemes against God, and has his kingdom given to others.{{sfn|Albertz|2001|p= 178}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13968">'''Carl Einstein''' (26 April 1885 &amp;ndash; 5 July 1940), born '''Karl Einstein''', was an influential [[German Jews|German Jewish]] writer, art historian, anarchist and critic.

Regarded as one of the first critics to appreciate the development of [[Cubism]], as well as for his work on [[African art]] and influence on the [[European art|European]] ''[[avant-garde art|avant-garde]]'', Einstein was a friend and colleague of such figures as [[George Grosz]], [[Georges Braque]], [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]]. His work combined many strands of both political and aesthetic discourse into his writings, addressing both the developing aesthetic of modern art and the political situation in Europe.

Einstein's involvement in social and political life was characterized by [[communist]] sympathies and [[anarchism|anarchist]] views. A target of the German [[right wing]] during the interwar [[Weimar republic|Weimar]] period, Einstein left Germany for France in 1928, a half-decade ahead of the rise of [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]], later taking part in the [[Spanish Civil War]] on the side of the anti-[[Francisco Franco]] [[anarcho-syndicalists]] during the 1930s.

Trapped in southern France following [[Nazi Germany]]'s [[Fall of France|defeat]] of the [[French Third Republic]], Einstein took his own life by jumping from a bridge&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=J4vtdJWJlfIC&amp;pg=PT50&amp;lpg=PT50&amp;dq=%22Carl+Einstein%22+suicide+jumped+bridge&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-wIWs-wvUJ&amp;sig=n3FgtYmY8GpmAjb0GKEzKAHOpOM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6s-iUOmyB4us0AGCgIHYAg&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAg Alan Riding - ''And the Show Went On: Cultural Life in Nazi-Occupied Paris'']&lt;/ref&gt; on 5 July 1940.

== Early life ==
Carl Einstein who was born to a [[German Jewish]] family on 26 April 1885, in the [[Rhineland]] town of [[Neuwied]]. The second child born to Daniel Einstein, an active member of the local [[Jewish]] community, and Sophie Einstein, Carl was a year younger than his sister [[Hedwig Einstein|Hedwig]], who would become known as a [[concert pianist]] and the wife of sculptor [[Benno Elkan]]. A third child born to Daniel and Sophie died in 1889. The young Carl Einstein spent much of his youth in [[Karlsruhe]] before moving to [[Berlin]] to study [[philosophy]] and [[art history]] in 1903. Originally given the standard German spelling of his [[first name]] as "Karl" at birth, he adopted the [[List of Latinised names|Latinized]] spelling "Carl" in the 1900s. In Berlin he attended the lectures of [[Georg Simmel]] and [[Heinrich Wölfflin]] but lacking a high school diploma (Abitur) he could not gain a doctorate.&lt;ref name="DAH"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sorensen|first1=Lee|title=Einstein, Carl (or Karl); Urian, Savine Ree, pseudonym|url=https://dictionaryofarthistorians.org/einsteinc.htm|website=Dictionary of Art Historians|publisher=Duke University.|accessdate=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1907 he visited [[Paris]] and learnt of [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Georges Braque]] and [[Juan Gris]], as well as other artists. Upon his return he started writing prose and joined the radical circle around [[Franz Pfemfert]] and his magazine ''[[Die Aktion]]''. This led to the publication of ''Bebuquin oder die Dilettanten des Wunders'' in serialised form in ''Die Aktion'' in 1912, with an subsequent volume collecting the episodes in a single book. In 1913 he married Maria Ramm, sister of [[Alexandra Ramm-Pfemfert]] and so becoming Franz's brother in law.&lt;ref name="DAH"/&gt;

==Wartime experience==
Einstein welcomed the outbreak of war and volunteered for the [[Imperial German Army]].&lt;ref name="van Dongen"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van Dongen|first1=Jeroen|title=Mistaken Identity and Mirror Images: Albert and Carl Einstein, Leiden and Berlin, Relativity and Revolution|journal=Physics in Perspective|date=15 May 2012|volume=14|issue=2|pages=126–177|doi=10.1007/s00016-012-0084-y}}&lt;!--|accessdate=3 February 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; served as a soldier of [[Imperial Germany]] in [[World War I]]. The majority of his wartime service was spent in German-occupied Belgium. The work carried out by German scholars on [[Belgian Congo|Congolese]] art during the occupation would prove to be considerably helpful in Einstein's later efforts to encourage the beginning of a serious appreciation of [[Black Africa|black]] [[African art]] by Europeans.&lt;ref name = "Carbonell 2004, p. 135"&gt;Carbonell, Bettina Messias (2004).

Einstein’s life after the First World War was marked by the violent political and social implications of the war and revolutionary sentiment following the [[Hohenzollern monarchy]]'s collapse. He was actively involved in the short-lived Revolutionary [[Brussels Soldiers' Council]] and to a lesser extent in the failed [[Spartacist Uprising]] in Berlin and later in the defeated anarchist [[Durruti Column]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]].

==Confusion with Albert Einstein==
[[Albert Einstein]] was offered a part-time professorship at [[Leiden University]] in 1920. [[Hendrik Lorentz]], one of the people who organised the offer saw it as way of promoting international reconciliation following the [[First World War]]. However, when the proposed appointment was passed to the government bureaucracy for approval as University professors were regarded as senior civil servants who required royal approval. However, a Dutch military intelligence report was submitted to the [[Ministry of Education, Culture and Science (Netherlands)|Minister of Education]] [[Johannes Theodoor de Visser]], which gave an account of Carl Einstein's activities in the 1918 Soldiers' Council in Belgium. This caused delays in governmental approval for the appointment. This was accompanied by a number of accounts of Carl's agitational activity during the [[German Revolution]], including Carl's graveside oration after the murder of [[Rosa Luxemburg]], which frequently omitted his first name. It is possible that this confusion led [[Paul Weyland]] to coin the phrase "scientific Dadaism". Indeed, [[Hannah Höch]] featured the inclusion of  the image of Albert Einstein in her collage ''Schnitt mit dem Küchenmesser. Dada durch die letzte weimarer Bierbauchkulturepoche Deutschlands'', which was exhibited in the first International Dada Fair, held in Berlin in 1920.&lt;ref name="van Dongen"/&gt;

==Post-war career==
Einstein established a reputation as a well-known author and art critic on the basis of work ranging from his debut novel ''Bebuquin oder die Dilettanten des Wunders'', to his widely read work on African sculpture ''Negerplastik'' (''Negro Sculpture''), credited as being one of the first important books acknowledging African art in Europe (and especially its relationship to Cubism), the final volume of the prestigious Propyläen Verlag history of art series ''Die Kunst des 20. Jahrhunderts'' (''Art of the 20th Century''), which may have gained him an invitation to teach at the Bauhaus (he declined), to the notorious play ''Die Schlimme Botschaft''. Another Africa-related book is ''Afrikanische Märchen und Legenden'', a compilation of [[African mythology]] in very expressive language. Einstein also worked on numerous journals and collective projects, among some of the more important: ''Die Aktion'' edited by Franz Pfemfert, ''Die Pleite'' and ''Der Blutige Ernst'' with [[George Grosz]], and the legendary journal ''Documents: Doctrines, Archéologie, Beaux-arts, Ethnographie'' edited with [[Georges Bataille]].

Einstein's avant-garde orientation and [[leftist]] political sympathies made him a marked man for [[right-wing]] attacks during the [[Weimar Republic]]. His [[passion play]] ''Die Schlimme Botschaft'' (''The Sad Tidings'', or ''The Bad News'') was met with attacks as [[blasphemous]]; its 1921 publication resulted in a legal process and a conviction for blasphemy in 1922, and Einstein was forced to atone for the revolutionary ideas placed into the mouth of his [[Jesus Christ]] with a 15,000-[[Deutsche Mark|mark]] fine.&lt;ref name = "Palmier 2006, p. 263"&gt;Palmier, Jean Michel (2006).

Better received in France, Einstein left Germany for permanent residence in France in 1928; with [[Adolf Hitler]]'s rise to power in 1933, the exile became permanent and officially mandated. Having met Lyda Guévrékian in 1928, Einstein married her in 1932. The French Cubist painter and sculptor, Georges Braque, served as a witness.&lt;ref name = "Danchev 2005, p. 170"&gt;Danchev, Alex (2005). ''Georges Braque: A Life''. New York: Arcade Publishing. p. 170. {{ISBN|1-55970-743-7}}, {{ISBN|978-1-55970-743-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Einstein spent 1936-1938 fighting in the Spanish Civil War; returning to France where in 1940, he was arrested and interned along with the other German émigrés until his liberation later in the spring of 1940 as a result of chaotic circumstances in the face of the rapidly progressing German invasion. Although able to escape the German occupation of Paris during the [[Fall of France]] and flee to the south, he was left trapped on the French border with Franco’s Spain.

Bereft of alternatives, Einstein committed [[suicide]] in the [[Pyrenees]] town of [[Lestelle-Betharram]] on 5 July 1940.&lt;ref name="Lester"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lester|first=David|title=Suicide and the Holocaust|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R1nkj-xSzYgC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=%22carl+einstein%22+suicide&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=opw_Tb6vLIqr8AaPoNCTBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22carl%20einstein%22%20suicide&amp;f=false|year=2005|publisher=[[Nova Publishers]]|isbn=978-1-59454-427-9|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coleshill Auxiliary Research Team (CART)''' is a network of British historians.
It is named after [[Coleshill, Oxfordshire|Coleshill]] in Oxfordshire where [[Winston Churchill]] had arranged for a group of soldiers, called [[Auxiliary Units]], to spend their time, developing guerrilla war tactics for in the event of a [[Nazi]] invasion of England during World War II. CART as it is known is the largest group in the UK researching this army and have put together a national database listing the 3,500 men.&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC History Magazine]], April 2011, p.14&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservative MP [[Justin Tomlinson]] has said of CART, "I fully support CART’s mission to honour their bravery. Their vital work should remain secret no longer."

[[File:Antiques restoration.jpg|thumb|Antiques restoration]]
A '''conservator-restorer''' is a professional responsible for the [[Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|preservation of artistic and cultural artifacts]], also known as [[cultural heritage]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.conservation-us.org/about-conservation#.WSymX8m1tPs About Conservation: What is conservation? What is a conservator?]". American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC). www.conservation-us.org. Retrieved 2017-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Conservators possess the expertise to preserve cultural heritage in a way that retains the integrity of the object, building or site, including its historical significance, context and aesthetic or visual aspects.&lt;ref name="Defining2003"&gt;Defining the Conservator: Essential Competencies. (2003). Retrieved from http://www.conservation-us.org/docs/default-source/governance/defining-the-conservator-essential-competencies.pdf?sfvrsn=1.&lt;/ref&gt;  This kind of preservation is done by analyzing and assessing the condition of cultural property, understanding processes and evidence of deterioration, planning [[collections care]] or site management strategies that prevent damage, carrying out conservation treatments, and conducting research.&lt;ref name="Careers2014"&gt;Careers in Conservation. (2014). Retrieved from http://www.conservation-us.org/publications-resources/careers-in-conservation/become-a-conservator#.VPPIxMaLTwN.&lt;/ref&gt;  A conservator's job is to ensure that the objects in a museum's collection are kept in the best possible condition, as well as to serve the museum's mission to bring art before the [[public]].&lt;ref name="Neuman2011"&gt;Neuman, R. (2011). MFA Highlights: Conservation and Care of Museum Collections. Boston, MA: Museum of Fine Arts.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conservation and restoration ==
Essentially, the term "conservation" refers to a manner of care or treatment that repairs damage and also takes action to prevent or slow down further deterioration of an object.&lt;ref name="Landry2000"&gt;Landry, G. (2000). The Wintertbur Guide to Caring for Your Collection. Winterthur, Delaware, DE: Winterthur Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term "restoration" refers to a manner of care or treatment in which the goal is to bring an object back to its original appearance or function.&lt;ref name="Landry2000" /&gt; "Restoration" can be part of the care and treatment of an object and is a subset of the umbrella term "conservation".&lt;ref name="Landry2000" /&gt;  Both terms come into play when it comes to the treatment and care of all cultural heritage.

== Responsibilities and duties ==
Conservators and restorers care for, manage, treat, preserve, and document many different historical items including [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]], [[art]], and specimens.&lt;ref name="Baker2015"&gt;Baker, G. D. (2015). How to Become a Museum Conservator. Retrieved from http://collegemouse.com/jobs/how-to-become-a-museum-conservator.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Examining artifacts, both visually and using scientific tools such as x-rays, infrared photography and microscopic analysis to determine the extent and causes of deterioration.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013"&gt;Johnston, L. (2013). Museum/gallery conservator job description. Retrieved from http://www.prospects.ac.uk/museum_gallery_conservator_job_description.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;  Conservation science (sometimes called museum science) aids every aspect of a museum’s mission to study its collections, both inside and out of the laboratory.&lt;ref name="Neuman2011" /&gt;
* Maintaining full conservation records by documenting the condition of an object or site, including any previous restoration work and to outline treatment methods and materials in detail.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  Documentation ensures the careful recording of treatment procedures and materials so there can be no misunderstanding in the future about what is part of the original work of art and what has been added or altered by the conservator&lt;ref name="Neuman2011" /&gt;
* Producing a visual record of the object for identification purposes and to illustrate its condition.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  The examination of the object, treatment proposal, and the actual treatment is documented with written reports and photographs&lt;ref name="Landry2000" /&gt;
* Monitoring and recording display and storage conditions with the aim of keeping objects in a stable condition.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  Preservation is the ultimate goal of conservation.  By taking into account the possible day-to-day stresses caused by an object’s environment, museum conservators do their best to preserve art for generations to come.&lt;ref name="Neuman2011" /&gt;
* Proposing and estimating the costs of treatments to halt decay and stabilize an artifact.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  Conservators, present a proposal for work to be done as well as a report on the completion of the treatment.&lt;ref name="Landry2000" /&gt;
* Restoration to bring a deteriorated or damaged object or structure closer to a previous or assumed appearance or function.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt;  Although conservators cannot exactly recapture the original appearance, they are able to make highly educated decisions about how to restore an object if they identify the materials from which it was made and fully understand their properties.&lt;ref name="Neuman2011" /&gt;
* Organizing the logistics of long-term projects and collaborating with other conservators.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  This collaboration can take place when items are on loan or when outside help is needed for complex conservation projects.
* Working out creative solutions to clean, support and repair sensitive objects.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  Ultimately, just as every object is unique, every conservation decision must be considered on its own and on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref name="Neuman2011" /&gt;
* Developing and maintaining appropriate standards within the specialist area.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  Critical information can be lost and an object permanently damaged when things are cared for without basic guidelines and information.&lt;ref name="Landry2000" /&gt;
* Keeping up to date with the latest conservation techniques and practices, through research and training.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  Conservation is a young profession, which means it continues to evolve over time and conservators must be able to keep up to date with the latest trends.
* Advising on procedures for the safe exhibition and travel of cultural materials .  Museum conservators strive to maintain the integrity of each work of art throughout its life, whenever it is handled, stored, displayed, or shipped to other locations for exhibitions.&lt;ref name="Neuman2011" /&gt;
* Direct and supervise curatorial, technical, and student staff in the handling, mounting, care, and storage of art objects.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  Other museum departments look to conservators and restorers for direction on safety procedures when it comes to objects in the museum's collection.
* Recommend preservation procedures, such as control of temperature and humidity, to curatorial and building staff.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  The most important step you can take to ensure the preservation of any collection is to create a safe display and storage environment that will not cause further deterioration of the objects.&lt;ref name="Landry2000" /&gt;

[[File:Russian-museum-conservation-department-092.jpg|thumb|Russian-museum-conservation-department-092]]

== Knowledge and skills ==
* Working knowledge of the vocabulary of conservation and scientific methodology in order to effectively examine an object, assess its state, understand its history, and articulate its needs.&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;
* Must have a firm grasp of philosophical precepts expressed in the AIC Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practice in order to formulate a treatment.&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;  The conservator must understand that it’s important to respect the integrity of the object and that his or her actions should not jeopardize the long-term preservation of the object.
* Understanding and appreciation of the aesthetic, cultural, economic, historical, political, religious, scientific, and social values of objects, buildings and sites.&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;  This understanding and appreciation are critically important when devising preservation and conservation plans, strategies, and treatments.
* Working knowledge of how materials constituting cultural heritage were acquired, modified, processed, or manufactured and how craft or manufacturing techniques and processes have evolved through time.&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;
* Possess knowledge of the chemical and physical properties and long-term behavior of a wide range of materials and whether these materials were used in the original fabrication of an object or in its subsequent treatment and preservation.&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;
* Must be aware of issues that arise from the ways that culturally significant materials will be accessed or used by society.&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;
* Knowledge of the context in which cultural heritage is used, as context may be critically important to understanding its condition, formulating appropriate treatment and recommending future care.&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;
* Knowledgeable about safety in the workplace and must carry out his or her practice in compliance with federal, state, and logical regulations.&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;
* Working knowledge of scientific principles as they apply to conservation, including how to access and use scientific literature and how to assess the validity of published research in conservation and allied fields.&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;
* Ability to recognize and understand the changes that occur in cultural heritage over time and be able to distinguish the cause of the changes (natural, chemical, physical, biological, or by human influence).&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;
* Versed in the many ways in which light, relative humidity, temperature, and pollutants can influence the long-term preservation of cultural heritage and must be familiar with techniques, equipment, and resources that can assist in managing these important environmental factors&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;
* Ability to conduct a safe, thorough examination of cultural materials in order to gather relevant information about their condition and to formulate an appropriate plan for preservation and treatment.&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;
* Know which tools and techniques are appropriate, how extensive the examination should be, and how or whether to perform external, intrusive, and occasionally destructive sampling.&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;
* Understand the purposes of documentation and must be knowledgeable and proficient in appropriate methods of written and pictorial documentation as well as in the maintenance and preservation of the body of information produced during examination and treatment.&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;
* Awareness of various treatment methods available as well as their effects on different types of cultural heritage, based on an understanding of condition, natural use, cultural, historic, and scientific significance, and, if applicable, the artist’s or maker’s intent.&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;

== Education and training ==

=== Undergraduate and graduate education ===
Conservators can receive training through apprenticeships, internships and graduate programs. In order to be accepted into a graduate program, they will need to fulfill some undergraduate prerequisites.  This includes undergraduate coursework in science, the humanities (art history, anthropology, and archaeology), and studio art.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt;  Some graduate programs may also require internship, volunteer, apprenticeship, or paid conservation experience.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt;  Many may also require a personal interview where candidates are asked to present a portfolio of art and conservation project work that demonstrates manual dexterity and familiarity with techniques and materials.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt;  Graduate programs generally require two to four years of study, which can also include a full-time internship in the final year where students work under the guidance of experienced conservators.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt;  There are also a limited number of Ph.D. programs for advanced study in conservation.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt;  Conservation-related programs are described on the websites of the AIC,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.conservation-us.org/jobs/become-a-conservator#.WSycysm1tPt Careers in Conservation: Become a Conservator]".

=== Continued professional development ===
The specialty of conservation is ever-changing and evolving, which means that practicing conservators must stay up-to-date of advances in technology and methodology.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt;  Conservators usually expand their knowledge through reading publications, attending professional meetings, and enrolling in short-term workshops or courses.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt; AIC offers many workshops, conferences, and online courses and tutorials.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.conservation-us.org/courses#.WSykcMm1tPt Professional Development Courses in Conservation Education]". American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC). www.conservation-us.org.

Conservation OnLine (CoOL). cool.conservation-us.org. Retrieved 2017-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Areas of specialty ==
Some conservators specialize in a particular material or group of objects, such as archaeology, ceramics and glass, furniture and wood, gilding and decorative surfaces, historic interiors, metals, paintings, paper and books, photographic materials, stained glass, stone and wall paintings, textiles, sculptures, and architecture.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;

== Ethics ==
The primary goal for conservators and restorers is the preservation of cultural property.  In order to achieve this goal, conservators abide by a code of ethics and guidelines that establish the principles that guide conservation professionals and others who are involved in the care of cultural property.  An example of a code of ethics and guidelines for practice were created by the [[American Institute for Conservation|American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC)]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.conservation-us.org/about-us/core-documents/code-of-ethics#.VPPM0saLTwM Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practive]" (2015). American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC). www.conservation-us.org. Retrieved 2017-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most important principles in a conservator's code of ethics is that treatments should be reversible, which means that one must be able to undo any treatment in the future.&lt;ref name="Neuman2011" /&gt;  Conservators strive to only minimize interventions and not completely alter an object during restoration.  Conservation focuses on the material aspects of art, and respect for original materials remains a crucial element of the field's ethics.&lt;ref name="Neuman2011" /&gt;

'''Cyclododecane''' is an [[organic compound]] with the [[chemical formula]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;.  It is a waxy white solid that is soluble in nonpolar organic solvents.  

==Uses==
It is a precursor to [[laurolactam]], a precursor to the polymer [[Nylon-12]].&lt;ref&gt;Schiffer, T.; Oenbrink, G. "Cyclododecanol, Cyclododecanone, and Laurolactam" in Ullman’s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry:  Wiley-VCH, 2009. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a08_201.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Laurolactam formation 2.png|center|500px|Formation of laurolactam]]

Cyclododecane is also an [[intermediate goods|intermediate]] in production of [[flame retardant]]s, [[detergent]]s, and other chemicals. 

Cyclododecane is also used as a [[volatile binding medium]], a temporary [[binder (material)|binder]] for sealing and conservation of [[friable]] and structurally weak materials, e.g. during [[excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] and transport of [[archaeology|archaeological]] objects and in [[art restoration]], e.g. to protect water-sensitive parts during cleaning. Due to its relatively slow evaporation in comparison with other volatile binding mediums the layer can last for several weeks. Very pure material has to be used so it does not leave any residue. Cyclododecane can be applied in molten state or dissolved in a nonpolar [[organic solvent]]. Other volatile binding mediums in use are [[camphene]], [[tricyclene]] and with some limits [[menthol]].[http://cool.conservation-us.org/byform/mailing-lists/cdl/1999/0218.html]

==Environmental considerations==
Cyclododecane is persistent in the environment, as it does not biodegrade easily. Cyclododecane is [[lipophilic]], usually present in the environment as adsorbed on the surface of soil particles. It has the potential to [[bioaccumulate]].  Concentrations above 1 mg/L are toxic to aquatic life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coastalwiki.org/coastalwiki/Cyclododecane]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Descent from Antiquity''' ('''DFA''' or '''DfA''') is a well-researched, historically documented generation-by-generation [[genealogy|genealogical descent]] tracing living persons back to people living in [[ancient history|antiquity]].

==Overview==
The idea of descent from antiquity is by no means new to genealogists. Hellenistic dynasties, such as the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemies]], claimed descent from gods and legendary heroes. In the Middle Ages, major royal dynasties of Europe sponsored compilations claiming their descent from [[Julius Caesar]], [[Alexander the Great]], in particular the rulers of [[Troy]] (see also [[British Israelism]], [[Euhemerism]]). Such claims were intended as propaganda glorifying a royal patron by trumpeting the antiquity and nobility of his ancestry. These descent lines included not only mythical figures but also stretches of outright fiction, much of which is still widely perpetuated today. The distinguishing feature of a DFA compared to such efforts is the intent to establish an ancestry that is historically accurate and verifiable. Nevertheless, DFA research still focuses on the ancestries of royal and noble families, since the historical record is most complete for such families.

The phrase ''descent from antiquity'' was used by [[Tobias Smollett]] in the 18th-century newspaper ''[[The Critical Review]]''. Reviewing [[William Betham (1749–1839)|William Betham]]'s ''Genealogical Tables of the Sovereigns of the World, from the earliest to the present period'' he wrote "From a barren list of names we learn who were the fathers or mothers, or more distant progenitors, of the select few, who are able to trace what is called their descent from antiquity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smollett|first=Tobias|journal=[[The Critical Review]]|year=1798|volume=23|page=298|title=Pye's Naucratia|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pjkFAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA298&amp;dq=%22descent+from+antiquity%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0zvXT4nfMcXz8QPT6f2ADA&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22descent%20from%20antiquity%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility of establishing a DFA as a result of serious genealogical research was raised in a pair of influential essays, by the [[Albany Herald]], [[Iain Moncreiffe|Sir Iain Moncreiffe of that Ilk]], and the late [[Garter Principal King of Arms|Garter King of Arms]], [[Anthony Wagner|Sir Anthony Wagner]]. Wagner explored the reasons why it was difficult to do, and suggested several possible routes, based on the work of genealogists such as [[Cyril Toumanoff|Prince Cyril Toumanoff]], [[David H. Kelley|Prof. David H. Kelley]], [[Christian Settipani]] and [[Ford Mommaerts-Browne]]. The following years have seen a number of studies of the possibilities. These are highly variable in the quality of their research. Many, if not most, of the DFA-related publications widely used by amateur genealogists are essentially worthless.

No DFA is accepted as established at this time. However, research has established the outlines of several possible or likely ancestries that could become DFAs. Moreover, the project has stimulated detailed inquiry into the [[prosopography]] of ancient and early medieval societies, an effort which is of great value in illuminating the social transformations which took place in those societies.

==Postulated routes in Europe==
Innumerable alternative routes of descent from antiquity have been posited.

===Rome to Charlemagne===
One proposal is to establish [[Charlemagne]]'s descent from one of the senatorial families of the later-day [[Imperial Rome]] based in southern Gaul. This project is of particular interest since all European royal families can trace their [[Charlemagne#Marriages and heirs|descent from Charlemagne]], as can many other people who are able to trace their descent from European nobility. While such a link possibly existed, extant sources do not permit reconstructing it with any degree of certainty. The record of senatorial families in the 5th and 6th centuries is very sparse. While a large amount of data exists with which to construct a prosopography of the leading provincial families of Imperial Rome in southern Gaul, it is not yet possible to establish a Gallic line that traverses the Imperial Age, though a Roman line through a Gallic one had been proposed in 1991 by [[Christian Settipani]]. Therefore, all reconstructions of the DFA through Western European monarchs must remain precarious at best and speculative at worst. Though two possible lines are proposed for the ancestry of [[Arnulf of Metz]], both are linked to the ancestors who are in turn reputedly linked to the [[Gallo-Roman]] genealogies. One of these proposes a descent from the proconsul [[Flavius Afranius Syagrius]].

===Rome to Hermenegildo Gutiérrez===
A possible alternative route to Settipani's original scheme goes through the Counts of [[Coimbra]] in 9th century [[Portugal]]. That route was originally suggested in a discussion between Settipani and [[Francisco Antônio Dória|Francisco Antonio Doria]]; it starts with a ''[[comes]]'' Ardabastus (born circa 611), son of a [[Visigoth]] [[Wittiza#Death, succession crisis and legacy|refugee]] in Byzantium, Athanagild (in turn son of [[Hermenegild|Saint Hermenegild]] and [[Ingunthis]]) and of Flavia Juliana (a Byzantine noblewoman related to the family of [[Maurice (emperor)|Emperor Maurice]]), that later moved to [[Spania|Provincia Spaniae]] (Byzantine possession in Spain) and fathered [[Erwig]], king of the Visigoths (680–687). It is argued that this individual was descended from a [[Byzantine]] [[Artabazanes|Artavazd]] of the great [[Mamikonian]] clan. The line is documented in a controversial deed that links the full descent to the historically attested count [[Hermenegildo Gutiérrez]] (878). The deed itself is dubious, and while some have suggested that the genealogy it contains could still be authentic, the lack of surviving documentation from the period spanned makes independent evaluation impossible. It is also said that the mentioned Count Ardabastos was a great-nephew of Emperor [[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice]], grandson of his brother [[Peter (curopalates)|Peter Augustus]], whose ancestry, though Armenian, was of a lower birth. Even if Count Ardabastos was "only" a grand-nephew of Emperor Maurice, with no kinship to the Mamikonians, through his maternal grandmother Anastasia Areobinda (wife of Peter Augustus and great-great granddaughter of [[Anastasius (consul 517)|Flavius Anastasius Paulus Probus Sabinianus Pompeius]], Roman consul in 517) he was a lineal descendant of the [[Valentinian dynasty|Valentinian]] and [[Theodosian dynasty|Theodosian]] dynasties, as well as of the very ancient [[gens Anicia]], whose first mention dates back to the end of the 4th century BC ([[Quintus Anicius Praenestinus]], [[aedile|curule aedile]] in 304 BC&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Robert Shannon Broughton|T. Robert S. Broughton]], ''The Magistrates of the Roman Republic'' (1952).&lt;/ref&gt;). If the proposed links between Count Ardabastos and Hermenegildo Guterres are correct, it would be possible to trace a blood-link between [[Theodosius I]] or [[Valentinian I]] and [[Ramiro II of León]] (grandson of [[Hermenegildo Gutiérrez]]) and so to the modern European royal houses.

===Attila the Hun to Charlemagne===
Many genealogists attempted to reconstruct a valid line of descent from [[Attila the Hun]] to [[Charlemagne]] but no one succeeded in working out a generally accepted route.

[[Steven Runciman]]'s book on the [[First Bulgarian Empire]], for instance, includes a pedigree of [[Kubrat]] from Attila's youngest son, [[Ernakh]], as the Bulgarian khans apparently believed to have been descended from Attila. While no sources are cited and intermediate generations are missing, there is another complication in the Bulgarian route: no documented link between the Bulgarian dynasty and Charlemagne.

[[Christian Settipani]] suggested a more plausible descent, although it cannot be reconstructed generation by generation as well. The scholar gives credit to the traditional claim that Attila's daughter was one of many wives of [[Ardaric]], king of the [[Gepids]]. It is assumed that the 6th-century Gepid rulers descended from Ardaric and that some royal Gepids claimed descent from this marriage in particular, although details are unclear.

A key link is the documented alliance between a Gepid princess Austrigusa and [[Waccho]], king of the [[Lombards]]. According to Settipani, Waccho and Austricusa were ancestors of either Charlemagne's mother or his father, but this claim involves a considerable degree of speculation as well.

===Rome to Kings of Wales===

According to the [[Pillar of Eliseg]], which was erected in [[Denbighshire]], [[Wales]] in the 9th century, the 8th-century Welsh [[Kingdom of Powys|King of Powys]] [[Elisedd ap Gwylog]] descended from reputed 5th-century "King of the Britons" [[Vortigern]] and his wife [[Sevira daughter of Maximus|Sevira]], who in turn was the daughter of [[Western Roman Empire|Western Roman Emperor]] [[Magnus Maximus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/archaeology/cisp/database/stone/ltysl_1.html#i1 The Pillar of Eliseg inscription] on the Celtic Inscribed Stone Project website.&lt;/ref&gt; If the genealogy inscribed in the Pillar of Eliseg is correct, it would be possible to trace a blood-link between Ancient Rome and modern descendants of Medieval Welsh nobility, given that Magnus Maximus's father apparently was part of the [[Julia (gens)|gens Julia]] and that Welsh kings until the [[Edwardian Conquest of Wales]] descended from Elisedd ap Gwylog. However, the Pillar of Eliseg's inscription is the only known source for a daughter of Magnus Maximus named "Sevira" (or "Severa").

==Non-European DFAs==

===Africa===
The [[Solomonic dynasty]], formerly sovereign in [[Ethiopia]], has long claimed descent from [[King Solomon]] of the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]]. For all of its circumstantial evidence, the well known claim is nonetheless unverifiable due to the fact that reliable documentation is lacking before the 13th century. Outside of this case in particular, similar [[oral tradition]]s of various descents from antiquity exist in nations and amongst peoples from all over the continent. Amongst the [[Yoruba people|Yorubas]] of [[West Africa]], for example, there is a popular belief that the numerous members of the tribe are all descendants of [[Oduduwa]], their semi-mythical emperor and founding father, who is believed to have reigned in the 11th century. Contemporary social status in their various kingdoms, therefore, is traditionally reckoned by what can be described as [[tanistry]]: If a person can claim to be a ''direct'' descendant of the emperor through the lines of his progeny (i.e. his children and grandchildren) as opposed to being an indirect one through those of his more distant relatives, then he or she is probably a [[dynastic]] member of one of the royal or high noble families within the contemporary Yoruba [[chieftaincy]] system. As with the aforementioned claim by the Ethiopians, however, genealogical verification is generally difficult in these cases due to an absence of written corroboration.

===Pre-Columbian America===
Another such case for descent from antiquity originates in the [[Americas]] (i.e. [[pre-Columbian]] civilization) for the [[Moctezuma II#Descendants in Mexico and the Spanish nobility|descendants of the Aztec emperor Moctezuma II]] (himself a direct descendant of the first Aztec king [[Acamapichtli]]), among whom can be counted titled members of the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]], [[House of Stuart|Stuart]], [[Habsburg]], and [[Hohenlohe]] noble houses&lt;ref name=Moct&gt;{{cite book|title=History of Mexico, Vol. I 1516–1521 |author1=William Nemos |author2=Thomas Savage |author3=Joseph Joshua Peatfield |pages=XIV and 141|publisher=A.L.

Chipman|pages=XIV and 141|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0-292-70628-6|year=2005|oclc=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (as well as untitled people such as [[Eduardo Matos Moctezuma]]) and the holders of the titles of [[Duke of Moctezuma de Tultengo]], Dukes of Ahumada, Counts of Miravalle, [[Duke of Abrantes#1642: The Dukes of Abrantes (Spanish Title)|Duke of Abrantes]], Condes de la Enjarada, Condes de Alba de Yeltes,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grandesp.org.uk/historia/gzas/parcent.htm Grandesp.org.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; Dukes of Atrisco&lt;ref name="MoctChildren" /&gt;, [[Prince Marco of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, 19th Duke of Medinaceli|Dukes of Medinaceli]] and [[Dukedom of Alba|Dukes of Alba]].

===Jewish===
Many living Jewish families trace their ancestry to [[David|King David]] through rabbis of the Middle Ages including [[Rashi]] and [[Judah Loew]] the Maharal of Prague. While there is controversy over the accuracy of some of the lines, complete lines are recorded in books written by Jewish scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewishgen.org/rabbinic/journal/kdavid3.htm|title=Rav-SIG: Online Journal &gt; Are You a Descendant of King David?, Page 3|website=www.jewishgen.org|access-date=2017-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.davidicdynasty.org/davidic-genealogy-links/|title=Davidic Genealogy Links   - Davidic Dynasty is dedicated to uniting the Jewish descendants of King David|website=www.davidicdynasty.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
Social privileges and immunities accorded to [[Sayyid|descendants of Muhammad]] have led to a vast quantity of false declarations of their lineages. Similar to other parts of the world, claiming noble ancestry helped reinforce a ruler. In the Ottoman Empire, tax breaks for "the People of the House" encouraged many people to buy certificates of descent or forge genealogies; the phenomenon of ''teseyyüd''—falsely claiming noble ancestry—spread across ethnic, class, and religious boundaries. In the 17th century, an Ottoman bureaucrat estimated that there were 300,000 impostors; in 18th-century Anatolia, nearly all upper-class urban people claimed descent from Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Canbakal|first=Hülya|title=The Ottoman State and Descendants of the Prophet in Anatolia and the Balkans (c. 1500–1700)|journal=Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient|year=2009|volume=52|pages=542–578|doi=10.1163/156852009X458241}}&lt;!--|accessdate=12 June 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The number of people claiming such ancestry—which exempted them from taxes such as [[avarız]] and [[tekalif-i orfiye]]—became so great that tax collection was very difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Acun|first=Fatma|title=The Other Side of the Coin: Tax Exemptions within the Context of Ottoman Taxation History|journal=Bulgarian Historical Review|year=2002|volume=1|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hashemites|Hashemite]] kings of [[Jordan]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/hash_intro.html King Hussein official site] "The Hashemites are thus the direct descendants of the Prophet through his daughter Fatima and her husband Ali bin Abi Talib, who was also the Prophet’s paternal first cousin."&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Alaouite dynasty|Alaouite]] kings of [[Morocco]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://4dw.net/royalark/morocco.php The Alawi Dynasty – Brief History]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usa-morocco.org/alaoui.htm Kingdom of Morocco's (Alaoui dynasty)]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Aga Khan]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.akdn.org/about_agakhan.asp His Highness the Aga Khan]&lt;/ref&gt; all claim descent from [[Muhammad]] or his close relatives.

===Japan===
In [[East Asia]], a descent from antiquity may be easier to establish. The [[Emperor of Japan|Japanese imperial family]] claims descent from the [[Emperor Ōjin]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.friesian.com/sangoku.htm#japan Emperors, Shoguns, &amp; Regents of Japan]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16471340/ Japan opens imperial tombs for research]&lt;/ref&gt; who is generally considered historical, though his time of life is uncertain. However, contemporary Japanese records do not commence until several centuries after Ōjin's time, and the tradition reports a major change to a [[cadet branch|cadet line]] shortly before the start of the literate period.

===China===
Due to China's long history of literacy, cultural continuity, and tradition of keeping family records, China has a number of families claiming DFA, including some of the oldest in existence. The following are some examples:

[[Kung Tsui-chang]], who succeeded to the title [[Duke Yansheng|Sacrificial Official to Confucius]] in the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] in 2009, is claimed to be the 79th-generation male-line descendant of [[Confucius]], and many other Chinese claim descent from [[family tree of Confucius in the main line of descent|this line]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2009-09/24/content_8733256.htm |title=Confucius' Family Tree Recorded biggest |publisher=Chinadaily.com.cn |date= |accessdate=2009-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New Confucius Genealogy out next year |url=http://www.china.org.cn/china/features/content_16696029.htm |quote=With a history of over 2,500 years covering more than 80 generations, and the longest family tree in the world according to the Guinness Book of Records, the fifth edition of the Confucius Genealogy will be printed in several volumes in 2009, according to an organizer of the [[Confucius Genealogy Compilation Committee]] (CGCC). |work=[[China Internet Information Center]] |year=2008 |accessdate=2008-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Confucius himself was said to be a descendant of the [[Song (state)|Dukes of Song]], who in turn were said to be descendants of the [[Shang dynasty]] kings.

Lords of the [[Zhou dynasty]] claim descent from deified legendary figures in pre-historic era. As such, all families descended from Zhou dynasty rulers can, in turn, trace descent back to gods and heroes in Chinese mythology. This includes the Confucius and Mencius families mentioned above, who both claim traceable descent from the [[Yellow Emperor]]. The [[Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors|Five Emperors]] were asserted as ancestors of the Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties.&lt;ref name="SoothillHosie2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=William Edward Soothill|author2=Dorothea Lady Hosie|author3=G.

The Zhikou (Chikow) Chiangs such as [[Chiang Kai-shek]] were descended from Chiang Shih-chieh who during the 1600s (17th century) moved there from Fenghua district, whose ancestors in turn came to southeastern China's Zhejiang (Chekiang) province after moving out of Northern China in the 13th century AD.

'''Dimitri Kitsikis''' ({{lang-el|Δημήτρης Κιτσίκης}}; born 2 June 1935) is a Greek [[Turkologist]] and [[Sinologist]], Professor of [[International Relations]] and [[Geopolitics]]. He has also published poetry in French and Greek.

==Life==
Dimitri Kitsikis is a [[Turkologist]] and Professor of International Relations and Geopolitics at the [[University of Ottawa]] in [[Ottawa|Ottawa, Ontario]], Canada since 1970, Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Canada]]; he received his doctoral degree in 1963 from the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], [[Paris]], under the supervision of [[Pierre Renouvin]]. He has been named one of the "three top geopolitical thinkers worldwide, [[Karl Haushofer]], [[Halford Mackinder]] and Dimitri Kitsikis".&lt;ref&gt;Ch. Raptis, ''Η γεωγραφία ως σύγχρονο εργαλείο πολιτικής επιβολής [Geography as a Present Day Instrument of Political Decision Making''], Athens, Trito Mati, no. 223, September 2014, p.25.&lt;/ref&gt; While pursuing his doctoral studies in Paris, he worked from 1960 to 1962 as a research assistant at the Graduate Institute of International Studies in Geneva. He derives his origin from a notable Greek-[[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] family of intellectuals and acclaimed professionals of 19th-century Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Emmanuel G.

His father, [[Nicolas Kitsikis]] (1887–1978), rector of the Polytechnic School in Athens, the most famous civil [[engineer]] of Greece, was a senator and an MP. His uncle, Konstantinos Kitsikis (1893–1969), a celebrated architect, Nicolas' younger brother, was also a professor at the Athens Polytechnic School. His grandfather, a chief justice, Dimitri Kitsikis senior (1850–1898), had settled in Athens, in 1865, from [[Lesbos]], his native island and was married to Cassandra (Κασσάνδρα), the sister of a member of the Greek Parliament, Dimitri Hatsopoulos (Δημήτρης Χατσόπουλος), 1844–1913, born in [[Karpenisi]].&lt;ref&gt;Γεώργιος Ἀλ. Φαρμακίδης, Δημήτριος Χατσόπουλος, 1844-1913 - Ατhènes, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;

His mother, [[Beata Kitsikis]] née Petychakis (Μπεάτα Πετυχάκη), was born in Herakleion, [[Crete]], from a wealthy Cretan family and Greek Italian nobles from Trieste of mixed Roman Catholic and Orthodox origin. Her father, Emmanuel Petychakis founded a beverage production plant in Cairo, [[Egypt]] and her stepfather [[Aristidis Stergiadis]] was the High Commissioner of Greece in [[Smyrna]] ([[Izmir]]) from [[Occupation of Smyrna|1919 to 1922]].

During the Greek civil war, at the age of 12, he was sent to a boarding school in Paris, by [[Octave Merlier]],&lt;ref&gt;Les réfugiés grecs d'Anatolie et le Centre d'Etudes micrasiatiques d'Athènes, ''Turcica'', vol. 17, 1985, p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; the head of the French Institute in Athens, because his mother had been condemned to death as a communist fighter.&lt;ref&gt;Ν. Μπατιστάτος, "Ἀπέδειξαν πὼς ἡ Ἑλλάδα δὲν εἶναι ψωροκώσταινα", ''Ριζοσπάστης'', January 12, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  He stayed in France for 23 years with his British wife Anne Hubbard, the daughter of a chief justice, whom he had married in [[Scotland]] in 1955,&lt;ref&gt;"Runaway Anne Has a Double Wedding", ''Scottish Daily Express'', 31 August 1955.&lt;/ref&gt;  with his two first children, Tatiana and Nicolas. He was expelled from the French University for his active participation as a [[Maoist]] in the [[May 1968 events in France|French student revolt of May 1968]].&lt;ref&gt;D. Kitsikis, ''Συγκριτικὴ Ἱστορία Ἑλλάδος-Κίνας'', Athens, Herodotos, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1958, Dimitri Kitsikis had traveled to the P.R. of [[China]] where he became a committed [[Maoist]].&lt;ref&gt;''Τότε'', issue 39, Winter 1992, Ares Moraites, "Τί μᾶς ἑνώνει καὶ τί μᾶς χωρίζει μὲ τὸν Δ. Κιτσίκη" and interview with Moraites and Alexandrou.&lt;/ref&gt;   He was then promoted to associate and later to full professor, after being invited to Canada in 1970 by the University of Ottawa. Since then, he has been living and working in Ottawa as well as in Athens,&lt;ref&gt;Greek Who's Who 1965, Athens.&lt;/ref&gt; with his second wife, Ada (Αδαμαντία) Nikolarou, whom he married in 1975, the daughter of a farmer from the historic Byzantine town of [[Mystras]], near [[Sparta]] and from whom he has two more children, Agis Ioannis Kitsikis and Kranay Kitsikis-De Leonardis. He is an admirer of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Kitsikis is thus a Panhellen, a cosmopolitan Greek, holding Greek citizenship, in addition to French and Canadian ones.

Since he was a child he had an idée fixe: He wanted not only to reconcile Greeks and Turks, but also to unite them into a [[Hellenoturkism|Greek Turkish Confederation]] which would (to an extent) be a reincarnation of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]]/[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Empires; thus filling the political, cultural and economic vacuum that's left behind by their absence in the East Mediterranean region.&lt;ref&gt;Ἐποπτεία, year 7, June 1982, tribute by P. Dracopoulos and ''Νέα Κοινωνιολογία'', 9th issue, Summer 1990, " Ἑλλάς-Τουρκία", a special tribute; article by Neocles Sarres.&lt;/ref&gt;  A devout [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]], he came to sympathise with the Turkish religion of [[Bektashism]]-[[Alevi]]sm&lt;ref&gt;D. Kitsikis, ''Ἡ σημασία τοῦ μπεκτασισμοῦ-ἀλεβισμοῦ γιὰ τὸν ἑλληνισμό'', Athens, Hecate, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  and sought to ally it with Orthodoxy, in order to form a basis for a future political union between [[Athens]] and [[Ankara]]. Believing in the collaboration of religious communities, as in the millet system of the Ottoman Empire, he worked closely with [[Shia Islam|Shia]] Muslims in [[Iran]],&lt;ref&gt;"Μεταξὺ δύο πυρῶν ἡ Ἑλλάδα", interview with D. Kitsikis by A. Balle, ''Τρίτο Μάτι'', τ. 16–17, Summer 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;  Jews in [[Israel]]&lt;ref&gt;Amy Singer, ''Aspects of Ottoman History'', Jerusalem, The Hebrew University, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;  and Hindu vaishnavs in [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;T.D. Singh &amp; Ravi Gomatam, ''Synthesis of Science and Religion'', The [[Bhaktivedanta Institute]], Bombay, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;  His elder son Nicolas has been a [[Vaishnav]] since 1984 and lives with his Hindu wife in the Vaishnav community of Gainesville, [[Florida]]. Although a member of the official Church of Greece, he always sympathised with the Old-Calendarist movement, the adherents of which reject the Church's use of the Gregorian (New) calendar and maintain a traditionalist attitude towards Christian life and worship. As Orthodoxy prevailed over the heresy of Iconoclasm in the 9th century and restored the use of the icon in Christian worship, he stands convinced that the Old Calendar will once again be adopted by those Orthodox Churches which rejected it in the earlier part of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;D. Kitsikis, ''The Old Calendarists and the Rise of Religious Conservatism in Greece'', Etna, California, Center for Traditionalist Orthodox Studies, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1970s he has taught Chinese and Turkish history, political ideologies and geopolitics at a number of universities in the West.&lt;ref&gt;University of Ottawa, Faculty of Arts, Department of History website, teaching staff.&lt;/ref&gt;  His [[List of Greek writers|plethora of books]] have been translated in many languages, while articles concerning his work have been published in Chinese, the Balkan languages, German, French, English, Spanish, Portuguese and Russian.&lt;ref&gt;See the list of works below&lt;/ref&gt;  He also taught at Boğaziçi University in [[Istanbul]], where he had as a student, the future prime minister of Turkey, [[Ahmet Davutoğlu]].&lt;ref&gt;Sıtkı Özcan, "Davutoğlu'nun hocasi şokta", Zaman, 17 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Kitsikis  is considered to have had a decisive influence, on Davutoğlu's geopolitical theory.&lt;ref&gt;Gilles Bertrand, «Turquie: dix ans après l'arrivée au pouvoir de l'AKP», 12e congrès de l'Association française de science politique, July 2013, Paris, France, see pp. 8-11&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, he taught at Bilkent University in [[Ankara]] and Gediz University in [[Izmir]] and became one of the closest friends and advisers of the President of the Turkish Republic, [[Turgut Özal]].&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Marie Joly, «Pas un tapis volant, mais presque», ''Gazette'', Université d'Ottawa, vol.II(7), 23 novembre 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; In Greece, he was resident researcher at the National Institute of Social Studies and taught at [[Deree College]], the American College in Athens.&lt;ref&gt;See the above ''Who's Who'', reference 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

He is a public figure in Greece and had been a close friend and advisor of [[Greece|Greek]] Premier [[Konstantinos Karamanlis]] senior in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;In an interview by the Istanbul journal, ''[[Yeni Aktüel]]'' (September 25th, 2007) when professor Anthony Liakos was asked by the Turkish journalist from where Karamanlis took his ideas regarding a Greek-Turkish collaboration, he responded, "from Kitsikis."&lt;/ref&gt; He contributes regularly with political articles to Greek magazines and, since 1996, publishes in Athens a Greek quarterly journal of Geopolitics named after his civilisation model,  «Endiamese Perioche, Ἐνδιάμεση Περιοχή» or "Intermediate Region".&lt;ref&gt;See the corresponding web page of ''Intermediate Region''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Named after his father, who died in 1978, the "Nikos Kitsikis Library and Archives" resides in the home of family member, the former high commissioner of [[Smyrna]] (during the [[Occupation of Smyrna|Greek occupation of the city between 1919 and 1922]]) [[Aristidis Stergiadis]] (1861–1949), in [[Herakleion]], [[Crete]]. Dimitri Kitsikis was honoured by the Greek State in 2006. The latter established and financed the "Dimitri Kitsikis Public Foundation and Library" in Athens.&lt;ref&gt;See the corresponding web page&lt;/ref&gt;

Kitsikis, since the 1960s, has been the recognised theorist, first in Greece and then in Turkey, of the idea of a Greek-Turkish Confederation, which he has promoted by influencing statesmen, politicians, journalists, artists and thinkers in both countries.&lt;ref&gt;From the publications concerning the same subject, see in ''Τότε'', "Θέμα τοῦ τουρκικοῦ τύπου ἡ συνέντευξη Κιτσίκη", no.42, May–June 1993. Also, hear the one-hour interview between Metropolitan Hierotheos Vlachos and professor Fr. George Metallinos on the radio station of the Church of Greece, February 27, 1994, with exclusive topic the standpoint of Kitsikis. In the journal ''Πάντα'', Athens, December 1994, "Ἡ πολιτικὴ σκέψη τοῦ Δημήτρη Κιτσίκη- Αζίζ Νεσίν καὶ  Δημήτρης Κιτσίκης, οἱ δύο ἐκφραστές τοῦ ἑλληνοτουρκισμοῦ στὶς δύο ὄχθες τοῦ Αἰγαίου".&lt;/ref&gt; His books in Turkish became best sellers in [[Turkey]] and were praised by the Prime Minister of Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;The journal ''Nokta'', Istanbul, March 31st - April 6th, 1996, p.45, declaration by Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yılmaz.&lt;/ref&gt; He kept close ties with Prime Ministers [[Konstantinos Karamanlis]] senior of Greece and [[Turgut Özal]]&lt;ref&gt;G. Alexandrou, ''Ἑλληνοτουρκικὴ ὁμοσπονδία. Τὰ ἀπόκρυφα σχέδια τοῦ κ. Ὀζάλ'', Greek Forum, year 17, issue 9/195, October, 1990, pp. 60-63 and  Ἐπίτομο Βιογραφικὸ Λεξικό, 2004, Athens, Metron, p. 417.&lt;/ref&gt;  of Turkey as well as the Chinese leaders [[Mao Zedong]] and [[Deng Xiaoping]].&lt;ref&gt;Referring to articles by Kitsikis upon travelling to the People's Republic of China, in Νέα, January 27th and 28th,1958, in ''Πολιτικὴ Οἰκονομικὴ Ἔρευνα'', January 14, 1959 and in Τεχνικὰ Χρονικά, February 15, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; His books in Greek created one of the greatest controversies ever encountered in Greek historiography. They were even debated in the Greek Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;"Περὶ Ὀθωμανικῆς Αὐτοκρατορίας", ''Ἡ Καθημερινή, '' December 18, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; The well-established notion of Greeks enslaved by Turks and a series of beliefs on the Ottoman Empire, which had been traditionally taught in schools and universities throughout Greece, such as the story of the so-called "secret school," were strongly questioned.&lt;ref&gt;D. Kitsikis, ''Ἱστορία τῆς Ὀθωμανικῆς Αὐτοκρατορίας'', Hestia Books&lt;/ref&gt; While his father, Nikos Kitsikis, rector of the Polytechnical School, was a leftist Member of Parliament, Senator and elected Mayor of Athens, Dimitri Kitsikis is averse towards the parliamentary system, which he regards as foreign to the Greek model of a government by the people or ''laocracy'', Greek "λαοκρατία".&lt;ref&gt;See his numerous articles against Parliamentarianism in the journal ''Ἐνδιάμεση Περιοχή'' (Intermediate Region). Also, "Ἡ ἑλληνική Λαοκρατία", in ''Τρίτο Μάτι'', issue 90, November 2000 and his book, ''Τὸ Βυζαντινὸ πρότυπο διακυβερνήσεως καὶ τὸ τέλος τοῦ κοινοβουλευτισμοῦ'', Esoptron, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been the initiator in France of the branch of the History of International Relations that deals with [[propaganda]] and pressure as a government weapon of [[foreign policy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Renouvin]] &amp; J.-B.

Gestation d'une technocratie en politique internationale'', Ottawa, Editions de l'Université d'Ottawa, 1972 and ''University of Toronto Quarterly'', Summer 1973, pp.462-463.&lt;/ref&gt;  He has insisted that religion is an essential component of international politics and strove by conferences and other means to facilitate the collaboration between the four main religions of [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]] and [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref&gt;''Dialogue of Civilizations, Tehran, 1999.

See also "Τὸ μέλλον τοῦ τουρκικοῦ Ἰσλάμ", Τρίτο Μάτι, issue 109, January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; He organised [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] dialogues with Iranian Shiites and Indian Hindus. He worked with Israeli Jews and fundamentalist Catholics from [[Quebec]], where he, along with his students, produced the quarterly journal ''Aquila'' (eagle) which, with a double-headed eagle on the front cover promoted the Byzantine imperial idea in Catholic circles. He also worked closely with the [[Fethullah Gülen]] Sunni Muslim Movement (See Gülen's "Dialog of Civilizations Platform"). However, the idea of a global hellenism is prevalent in all his works and teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Aquila, Québec, from Summer 1998. Also, ''Cahiers de Jeune Nation'', Québec, from April 1992. See also D. Kitsikis, "Ἑλληνοκεντρισμὸς καὶ παγκοσμισμός", Τρίτο Μάτι, January 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

He created a model&lt;ref&gt;D. Kitsikis, "Τὸ μοντέλο τῆς τρίτης ἰδεολογίας", pp. 233--253, in ''Ἡ τρίτη ἰδεολογία καὶ ἡ Ὀρθοδοξία'', Athens, Hestia Books, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; for a new approach of the three political ideologies of [[liberalism]], [[fascism]] and [[communism]], and he has published on the history of [[China]]. He is the founder of the branch of study known as Photohistory.&lt;ref&gt;"Ἡ Φωτοϊστορία", p. 64-72 in ''Τότε'', issue 30(3), January 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

He is also a recognised poet, with six collections of poetry published by Pierre Jean Oswald (Paris), Naaman (Québec), Kedros (Κέδρος), Hestia (Ἑστία) and Akritas (Ἀκρίτας).&lt;ref&gt;See the list of works below. Also, Costas G. Missios, ''Ἀνθολόγιο Λεσβίων ποιητῶν'', vol. 10, Mytilene 1998, pp. 152-155 and D. Siatopoulos, ''Γραμματολογικὴ καὶ βιογραφικὴ ἐγκυκλοπαίδεια τῆς ἑλληνικῆς λογοτεχνίας'', Athens, 1981, vol. 2, p.154.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, he was honored with the first Greek-Turkish prize for poetry [[Abdi İpekçi]], a Turkish journalist who had been shot dead by terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;First İpekçi prize in poetry: see ''Meydan-Larousse'', ek 3, 1992, vol. XV, (Abdi Ipekçi ödülü), Istanbul.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of his poetry books, namely ''Omphalos'' (1977), ''l'Orocc dans l'âge de [[Kali]]'' (1985) and ''le Paradis perdu sur les barricades'' (1989–1993), became part of an anthology of 32 Canadian poets&lt;ref&gt;H. Bouraoui et J. Flamand (eds), ''Ecriture franco-ontarienne d'aujourd'hui'', Ottawa, Les Editions du Vermillon, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; in the book by H. Bouraoui and J. Flamand. His poetic work was included in the ''Dictionnaire des citations littéraires de l'Ontario français, depuis 1960''.&lt;ref&gt;M. et P. Karch, Ottawa, Editions L'Interligne, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; His poems were also used in the books by the Greek artist Georgette Kambani.&lt;ref&gt;Γεωργία Καμπάνη, ''Ποιητικὴ καὶ Εἰκαστικὴ Ἀνθολογία. Διάλογος ποίησης καὶ ζωγραφικῆς'', Athens, Costas Spanou Editions, 2006. Also, Georgette Kambani, ''Poèmes, peintures, symboles'', Ottawa, Les Editions du Vermillon, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kitsikis regards the Greek language as the cornerstone of planetary civilization, and he thus deems it an honour for one to be able to write in Greek. He believes that the treatment of the language should be taken out of the hands of Greek philologists who are currently destroying it. He defends the continued use of [[Greek diacritics|polytonic Greek]], traditional spelling and the freedom to write in any literary tone. He regards as erroneous only the implementation of a Greek form not used from the time of [[Homer]] to today.&lt;ref&gt;See the related articles in the journals ''Ἐνδιάμεση Περιοχή  and Τρίτο Μάτι''. In the latter, Kitsikis agrees to contribute under the condition that his articles be published in polytonic Greek. See his related letter in p. 70 of issue 109, January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the founder of four concepts setting a novel approach for the history of the Greek-Turkish Area to be understood: a) The "[[Intermediate Region]]" (Endiamese Perioche, Ἐνδιάμεση Περιοχή) of civilisation, extending from the [[Adriatic]] Sea to the [[Indus]] River, between the Euro-American West and the Hindu-Chinese East.&lt;ref&gt;P.

Keyserlingk, "Dimitri Kitsikis", pp.125-130 in ''Royal Society of Canada'', issue 52, Ottawa, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;  b) [[Eastern Party in Greece]] and Turkey (Ἀνατολικὴ Παράταξις) versus Western Party (Δυτικὴ Παράταξις) as an antagonist couple;&lt;ref&gt;"Ἡ ανατολικὴ παράταξη στὴν Ελλάδα", Τότε, issue 27, August 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;  c) [[Hellenoturkism]] (Ἑλληνοτουρκισμός) as an ideology and as a phenomenon of culture for the last one thousand years;&lt;ref&gt;Ares Moraites, "Γιατί δημοσιεύονται στὸ Τότε οἱ ἀπόψεις τῶν ελληνοτουρκιστῶν", ''Τότε'',  issue 48, May–June 1994.

Kitsikis, ''Ἱστορία τῆς Ὀθωμανικῆς Αὐτοκρατορίας'', Hestia Books. Also, " Ἡ συμμαχία Ἑλλάδας-Ἀλεβίδων-Ἰσραήλ θὰ διαλύσει τὴν Τουρκία", interview of Kitsikis by Aris Moraites, ''Τότε'', issue 57, November – December 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, ''A Comparative History of Greece and China from Antiquity to the Present'' was published. The book is notable in that it homes in on the relationship between the two civilisations throughout their entire history spanning three millennia. The study raises two concepts: 1) the Greek-Chinese civilisation in a global context and 2) its political expression during the last 2500 years, that is, ecumenical empire as a glorified organisational model.&lt;ref&gt;''Ἱστορία Ἑλλάδος-Κίνας ἀπὸ τὴν ἀρχαιότητα μέχρι σήμερα'', Athens, Herodotos, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahead of the [[Greek legislative election, September 2015|September 2015 general elections]] in [[Greece]], Kitsikis endorsed the [[Golden Dawn (political party)|Golden Dawn]] party, calling it "the only patriotic choice."&lt;ref&gt;[http://endiameseperioche.blogspot.gr/2015/08/230.html "Why Golden Dawn must be voted in"] by Dimitris Kitsikis, 22 August 2015, (in [[Greek language|Greek]])&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on Turkish politics==
The Centre for Research on Globalization described Kitsikis as having "had a major influence on Turkish foreign policy.Turkey's previous good neighborly policy seemed to be in accordance with Kitsikian geopolitics but was sabotaged by Ankara's treacherous collaboration with U.S. chaos strategy in the Middle East since the U.S. fomented Arab Spring in 2011".&lt;ref&gt;Gearoid O Colmain,''Turkey's New Role: From NATO Lapdog to Emerging Empire?'', Global Research, September 03, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Kitsikis was former prime minister [[Ahmet Davutoğlu]]'s professor&lt;ref&gt;Sıtkı Özcan, "Davutoğlu'nun hocasi şokta", Zaman, 17 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a close adviser of former President [[Turgut Özal]]. He is considered to have had a decisive influence, on Davutoğlu's geopolitical theory.&lt;ref&gt;Gilles Bertrand, «Turquie: dix ans après l'arrivée au pouvoir de l'AKP», 12e congrès de l'Association française de science politique, July 2013, Paris, France, see pp. 8-11&lt;/ref&gt;

Kitsikis wrote in both his Facebook and Twitter accounts, the day after the Turkish referendum: "Christ is risen! The Empire is risen! The Ottoman world is risen! The Intermediate Region has come again to life! Long live president Erdoğan! Fethullah Gülen, former Erdoğan`s spiritual father has lost but his ideas, through his pupil Erdoğan have triumphed. Dimitri Kitsikis".

==The Dimitri Kitsikis Public Foundation==
The Dimitri Kitsikis Public Foundation in Athens, Greece, was formally established under Presidential Decree 129, A 190 (pp.&amp;nbsp;3425, 3430-3431). The Presidential Decree was published September 15, 2008 in the Gazette of the Government of Greece (ΦΕΚ).

'''Emilio Gentile''' (born 1946 in [[Bojano]]) is an [[Italy|Italian]] historian specializing in the ideology and culture of [[fascism]]. Gentile is considered one of Italy's foremost cultural historians of fascist ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Cardoza | first = Anthony L. | authorlink = |date=December 1994 | title = Il Culto del Littorio: La Sacralizzazione della Politica nell'Italia Fascista. by Emilio Gentile (book review) | journal = [[The American Historical Review]] | volume = 99 | issue = 5 | pages = 1721–1722 | issn = | jstor = 2168494  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied under [[Renzo De Felice]] and wrote a book about him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = James Gregor | first = A. | authorlink = |date=October 2001 | title = Fascismo e antifascismo: I pariti italiani fra le due querre by Emilio Gentile (book review) | journal = [[The American Historical Review]] | volume = 106 | issue = 4 | pages = 1496–1497 | issn = | jstor = 2693148  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gentile is a professor at the [[Sapienza University of Rome]]. He considers fascism a form of [[political religion]]. He also applied the theory of political religion to the [[United States]] after the [[September 11 attacks]].

Its discovery was announced on 28 May 2012 by MAHER Center of Iranian National [[Computer Emergency Response Team]] (CERT),&lt;ref name=maher/&gt; [[Kaspersky Lab]]&lt;ref name=Gostev/&gt; and [[CrySyS Lab]] of the [[Budapest University of Technology and Economics]].&lt;ref name=cry/&gt; The last of these stated in its report that Flame "is certainly the most sophisticated malware we encountered during our practice; arguably, it is the most complex malware ever found."&lt;ref name=cry/&gt; Flame can spread to other systems over a [[local network]] (LAN) or via [[USB stick]]. It can record audio, [[screenshot]]s, [[Keystroke logging|keyboard activity]] and [[Packet capture|network traffic]].&lt;ref name=Gostev/&gt; The program also records [[Skype]] conversations and can turn infected computers into [[Bluetooth]] beacons which attempt to download contact information from nearby Bluetooth-enabled devices.&lt;ref name=Zetter/&gt; This data, along with locally stored documents, is sent on to one of several [[Command and control (malware)|command and control]] servers that are scattered around the world. The program then awaits further instructions from these servers.&lt;ref name=Gostev/&gt;

According to estimates by Kaspersky in May 2012, Flame had initially infected approximately 1,000 machines,&lt;ref name=Zetter/&gt; with victims including governmental organizations, educational institutions and private individuals.&lt;ref name=Gostev/&gt; At that time 65% of the infections happened in Iran, Israel, Palestine, Sudan, Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt,&lt;ref name=Lee/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gostev/&gt; with a "huge majority of targets" within Iran.&lt;ref name=BBC46 /&gt; Flame has also been reported in Europe and North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mashable.com/2012/06/04/flame-malware/ |title=Meet Flame, the Nastiest Computer Malware Yet |author=Murphy, Samantha |date=5 June 2012 |publisher=Mashable.com |accessdate=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Flame supports a "kill" command which wipes all traces of the malware from the computer. The initial infections of Flame stopped operating after its public exposure, and the "kill" command was sent.&lt;ref name=del /&gt;

Flame is linked to the [[Equation Group]] by Kaspersky Lab. However, Costin Raiu, the director of Kaspersky Lab's global research and analysis team, believes the group only cooperates with the creators of Flame and [[Stuxnet]] from a position of superiority: "Equation Group are definitely the masters, and they are giving the others, maybe, bread crumbs. From time to time they are giving them some goodies to integrate into Stuxnet and Flame."&lt;ref&gt;[https://securelist.com/blog/research/68750/equation-the-death-star-of-malware-galaxy/ Equation: The Death Star of Malware Galaxy], ''SecureList'', Costin Raiu (director of Kaspersky Lab's global research and analysis team): "It seems to me Equation Group are the ones with the coolest toys. Every now and then they share them with the Stuxnet group and the Flame group, but they are originally available only to the Equation Group people. Equation Group are definitely the masters, and they are giving the others, maybe, bread crumbs. From time to time they are giving them some goodies to integrate into Stuxnet and Flame."&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Flame (a.k.a. Da Flame) was identified in May 2012 by MAHER Center of Iranian National CERT, Kaspersky Lab and CrySyS Lab (Laboratory of Cryptography and System Security) of the Budapest University of Technology and Economics when Kaspersky Lab was asked by the United Nations [[International Telecommunication Union]] to investigate reports of a virus affecting [[Iranian Oil Ministry]] computers.&lt;ref name=Zetter&gt;{{cite news|title=Meet 'Flame,' The Massive Spy Malware Infiltrating Iranian Computers |first=Kim |last=Zetter |url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/05/flame/ |newspaper=Wired |date=28 May 2012 |accessdate=29 May 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6834BiIOh?url=http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/05/flame/ |archivedate=30 May 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Kaspersky Lab investigated, they discovered an [[MD5]] [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] and filename that appeared only on customer machines from Middle Eastern nations. After discovering more pieces, researchers dubbed the program "Flame" after one of the main modules inside the toolkit &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;FROG.DefaultAttacks.A-InstallFlame&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;ref name=Zetter/&gt;

According to Kaspersky, Flame had been operating in the wild since at least February 2010.&lt;ref name=Gostev/&gt; CrySyS Lab reported that the file name of the main component was observed as early as December 2007.&lt;ref name=cry/&gt; However, its creation date could not be determined directly, as the creation dates for the malware's modules are falsely set to dates as early as 1994.&lt;ref name=Zetter/&gt;

Computer experts consider it the cause of an attack in April 2012 that caused Iranian officials to disconnect their oil terminals from the Internet.&lt;ref name=Hopkins&gt;{{cite news|title=Computer Worm That Hit Iran Oil Terminals 'Is Most Complex Yet' |first=Nick |last=Hopkins |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/28/computer-worm-iran-oil-w32flamer |newspaper=The Guardian |date=28 May 2012 |accessdate=29 May 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6834CTccS?url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/may/28/computer-worm-iran-oil-w32flamer |archivedate=30 May 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time the [[Iranian Students News Agency]] referred to the malware that caused the attack as "Wiper", a name given to it by the malware's creator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Facing Cyberattack, Iranian Officials Disconnect Some Oil Terminals From Internet |first=Thomas |last=Erdbrink |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/24/world/middleeast/iranian-oil-sites-go-offline-amid-cyberattack.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=23 April 2012 |accessdate=29 May 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120531000136/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/24/world/middleeast/iranian-oil-sites-go-offline-amid-cyberattack.html?_r=1 |archivedate=31 May 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Kaspersky Lab believes that Flame may be "a separate infection entirely" from the Wiper malware.&lt;ref name=Zetter/&gt; Due to the size and complexity of the program—described as "twenty times" more complicated than [[Stuxnet]]—the Lab stated that a full analysis could require as long as ten years.&lt;ref name=Zetter/&gt;

On 28 May, Iran's CERT announced that it had developed a detection program and a removal tool for Flame, and had been distributing these to "select organizations" for several weeks.&lt;ref name=Zetter/&gt; After Flame's exposure in news media, [[Symantec]] reported on 8 June that some Flame command and control (C&amp;C) computers had sent a "suicide" command to infected PCs to remove all traces of Flame.&lt;ref name=del&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-18365844 |title=Flame malware makers send 'suicide' code |date=8 June 2012 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to estimates by Kaspersky in May 2012,  initially Flame had infected approximately 1,000 machines,&lt;ref name=Zetter/&gt; with victims including governmental organizations, educational institutions and private individuals.&lt;ref name=Gostev/&gt; At that time the countries most affected were Iran, Israel, the Palestinian Territories, Sudan, Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt.&lt;ref name=Lee/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gostev/&gt;

Flame is an uncharacteristically large [[Computer program|program]] for malware at 20&amp;nbsp;[[megabyte]]s.  It is written partly in the [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]] scripting language with compiled [[C++]] code linked in, and allows other attack modules to be loaded after initial infection.&lt;ref name=Gostev/&gt;&lt;ref name=FireEye&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.fireeye.com/research/2012/05/flamerskywiper-analysis.html |title=Flamer/sKyWIper Malware: Analysis |last=Kindlund |first=Darien |date=30 May 2012 |publisher=[[FireEye, Inc.|FireEye]] |accessdate=31 May 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6846KWz2y?url=http://blog.fireeye.com/research/2012/05/flamerskywiper-analysis.html |archivedate=31 May 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The malware uses five different encryption methods and an [[SQLite]] database to store structured information.&lt;ref name=cry/&gt; The method used to inject code into various processes is stealthy, in that the malware modules do not appear in a listing of the modules loaded into a process and malware [[Page (computer memory)|memory pages]] are protected with READ, WRITE and EXECUTE [[Security descriptor|permissions]] that make them inaccessible by user-mode applications.&lt;ref name=cry/&gt; The internal code has few similarities with other malware, but exploits two of the same security vulnerabilities used previously by Stuxnet to infect systems.{{efn|MS10-061 and MS10-046}}&lt;ref name=cry/&gt;  The malware determines what [[antivirus software]] is installed, then customises its own behaviour (for example, by changing the [[filename extension]]s it uses) to reduce the probability of detection by that software.&lt;ref name=cry/&gt; Additional indicators of compromise include [[mutex]] and [[Windows Registry|registry]] activity, such as installation of a fake [[Sound card#Driver architecture|audio]] [[Device driver|driver]] which the malware uses to maintain persistence on the compromised system.&lt;ref name=FireEye/&gt;

Flame is not designed to deactivate automatically, but supports a "kill" function that makes it eliminate all traces of its files and operation from a system on receipt of a module from its controllers.&lt;ref name=Zetter/&gt;

Flame was signed with a fraudulent [[Public key certificate|certificate]] purportedly from the Microsoft Enforced Licensing Intermediate PCA certificate authority.&lt;ref name="Ms"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.technet.com/b/msrc/archive/2012/06/03/microsoft-releases-security-advisory-2718704.aspx?Redirected=true|title=Microsoft releases Security Advisory 2718704|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|date=3 June 2012|accessdate=4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The malware authors identified a Microsoft [[Terminal Server]] Licensing Service certificate that inadvertently was enabled for code signing and that still used the weak [[MD5]] [[Cryptographic hash function|hashing algorithm]], then produced a counterfeit copy of the certificate that they used to [[code signing|sign]] some components of the malware to make them appear to have originated from Microsoft.&lt;ref name="Ms"/&gt;  A successful [[collision attack]] against a certificate was previously demonstrated in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/rogue-ca/|title=MD5 Considered Harmful Today|author1=Sotirov, Alexander |author2=Stevens, Marc |author3=Appelbaum, Jacob |author4=Lenstra, Arjen |author5=Molnar, David |author6=Osvik, Dag Arne |author7=de Weger, Benne |date=30 December 2008|accessdate=4 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Deployment ==
Like the previously known cyber weapons [[Stuxnet]] and [[Duqu]], it is employed in a targeted manner and can evade current security software through [[rootkit]] functionality. Once a system is infected, Flame can spread to other systems over a local network or via USB stick. It can record audio, screenshots, keyboard activity and [[Packet capture|network traffic]].&lt;ref name=Gostev/&gt; The program also records Skype conversations and can turn infected computers into Bluetooth beacons which attempt to download contact information from nearby Bluetooth enabled devices.&lt;ref name=Zetter/&gt; This data, along with locally stored documents, is sent on to one of several command and control servers that are scattered around the world. The program then awaits further instructions from these servers.&lt;ref name=Gostev/&gt;

Unlike Stuxnet, which was designed to [[sabotage]] an industrial process, Flame appears to have been written purely for [[espionage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Massive Cyber-Attack an 'Industrial Vacuum Cleaner for Sensitive Information' |first=Reuven |last=Cohen |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/reuvencohen/2012/05/28/new-massive-cyber-attack-an-industrial-vacuum-cleaner-for-sensitive-information/ |newspaper=Forbes |date=28 May 2012 |accessdate=29 May 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6834FNRPf?url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/reuvencohen/2012/05/28/new-massive-cyber-attack-an-industrial-vacuum-cleaner-for-sensitive-information/ |archivedate=30 May 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; It does not appear to target a particular industry, but rather is "a complete attack toolkit designed for general cyber-espionage purposes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Massive 'Flame' Malware Stealing Data Across Middle East |first=Chloe |last=Albanesius |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2404951,00.asp |newspaper=PC Magazine |date=28 May 2012 |accessdate=29 May 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6834QQKy1?url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2404951,00.asp |archivedate=30 May 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using a technique known as [[Denial-of-service attack#Blackholing and sinkholing|sinkholing]], Kaspersky demonstrated that "a huge majority of targets" were within Iran, with the attackers particularly seeking [[AutoCAD]] drawings, [[PDF]]s, and [[text file]]s.&lt;ref name=BBC46&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-18324234 |title=Flame: Attackers 'sought confidential Iran data' |author=Lee, Dave |date=4 June 2012 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Computing experts said that the program appeared to be gathering technical diagrams for intelligence purposes.&lt;ref name=BBC46 /&gt;

A network of 80 servers across Asia, Europe and North America has been used to access the infected machines remotely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Flame virus: Five facts to know |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/enterprise-it/security/Flame-virus-Five-facts-to-know/articleshow/13640158.cms |newspaper=The Times of India |agency=Reuters |date=29 May 2012 |accessdate=30 May 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6834SlYre?url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-05-29/security/31887318_1_stuxnet-flame-kaspersky-lab |archivedate=30 May 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
On 19 June 2012, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' published an article claiming that Flame was jointly developed by the U.S. [[National Security Agency]], [[CIA]] and Israel’s military at least five years prior. The project was said to be part of a classified effort code-named [[Operation Olympic Games|Olympic Games]], which was intended to collect intelligence in preparation for a cyber-sabotage campaign aimed at slowing Iranian nuclear efforts.&lt;ref name="nakashima2012june"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-israel-developed-computer-virus-to-slow-iranian-nuclear-efforts-officials-say/2012/06/19/gJQA6xBPoV_story.html |title=U.S., Israel developed Flame computer virus to slow Iranian nuclear efforts, officials say |work=The Washington Post |date=19 June 2012 |accessdate=20 June 2012 |author=Nakashima, Ellen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kaspersky's chief malware expert, "the geography of the targets and also the complexity of the threat leaves no doubt about it being a nation-state that sponsored the research that went into it."&lt;ref name=Lee/&gt; Kaspersky initially said that the malware bears no resemblance to Stuxnet, although it may have been a parallel project commissioned by the same attackers.&lt;ref name=T295&gt;{{cite news|title=Flame Virus: Who is Behind the World's Most Complicated Espionage Software? |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/9296827/Flame-virus-who-is-behind-the-worlds-most-complicated-espionage-software.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=29 May 2012 |accessdate=29 May 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6834RDamf?url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/9296827/Flame-virus-who-is-behind-the-worlds-most-complicated-espionage-software.html |archivedate=30 May 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
After analysing the code further, Kaspersky later said that there is a strong relationship between Flame and Stuxnet; the early version of Stuxnet contained code to propagate via USB drives that is nearly identical to a Flame module that exploits the same [[Zero-day attack|zero-day vulnerability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kaspersky.com/about/news/virus/2012/Resource_207_Kaspersky_Lab_Research_Proves_that_Stuxnet_and_Flame_Developers_are_Connected|title=Resource 207: Kaspersky Lab Research Proves that Stuxnet and Flame Developers are Connected|date=11 June 2012|publisher=Kaspersky Lab}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iran's CERT described the malware's encryption as having "a special pattern which you only see coming from Israel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Iran Confirms Attack by Virus That Collects Information |first=Thomas |last=Erdbrink |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/30/world/middleeast/iran-confirms-cyber-attack-by-new-virus-called-flame.html?_r=1&amp;hp |newspaper=The New York Times |date=29 May 2012 |accessdate=30 May 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6834RnDda?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/30/world/middleeast/iran-confirms-cyber-attack-by-new-virus-called-flame.html?_r%3D2%26hp |archivedate=30 May 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' reported that due to Flame's apparent targets—which included Iran, Syria, and the [[West Bank]]—Israel became "many commentators' prime suspect". Other commentators named [[China]] and the U.S. as possible perpetrators.&lt;ref name=T295/&gt; [[Richard Silverstein]], a commentator critical of Israeli policies, claimed that he had confirmed with a "senior Israeli source" that the malware was created by Israeli computer experts.&lt;ref name=T295 /&gt; ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'' wrote that Israel's Vice Prime Minister [[Moshe Ya'alon]] appeared to have hinted that his government was responsible,&lt;ref name=T295 /&gt; but an Israeli spokesperson later denied that this had been implied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/flame-cyberweapon-written-using-gamer-code-report-says/2012/05/31/gJQAkIB83U_story.html |title=Flame cyberweapon written using gamer code, report says |author=Tsukayama, Hayley |date=31 May 2012 |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=31 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unnamed Israeli security officials suggested that the infected machines found in Israel may imply that the virus could be traced to the U.S. or other Western nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://techland.time.com/2012/05/31/iran-flame-virus-fight-began-with-oil-attack/ |title=Iran: ‘Flame’ Virus Fight Began with Oil Attack |agency=Associated Press |date=31 May 2012 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=31 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. has officially denied responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-18277555 |title=Flame: Israel rejects link to malware cyber-attack |publisher=BBC News |date=31 May 2012 |accessdate=3 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Geoffrey Alderman''' (born 10 February 1944) is a British historian, especially of the Jewish community in England in the 19th and 20th centuries, and also an academic, political adviser and journalist.

==Life==
Born in [[Middlesex]], Alderman studied history at [[Lincoln College, Oxford]] from 1962, gaining his BA in 1965 and an [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge)|MA]] and [[D.Phil.]] in 1969. After short academic contracts at University College London, and the universities of Swansea and Reading he joined [[Royal Holloway, University of London|Royal Holloway College]] ([[University of London]]) in 1972, lecturing in politics and contemporary history. He was made Professor of Politics and Contemporary History in 1988.

From 1989 to 1994 he held senior administrative posts in the [[University of London]] and from 1994 to 1999 in [[Middlesex University]]. From 1999 he has worked in the private educational sector, in the US ([[Touro College]]) and, from 2002 to 2006, at the [[American InterContinental University]], London, where he was Academic Dean and Senior Vice-President. On 1 June 2007 Alderman joined the [[University of Buckingham]].

In 1971 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Historical Society]] and in 1991 a Fellow (now a Life Fellow) of the [[Royal Society of Arts]].

In 2006 he was awarded the degree of [[Doctor of Letters]] by the [[University of Oxford]] for his important work on Anglo-Jewish history.

In 2010 he was appointed a Visiting Fellow of the Oxford Centre for Higher Education Policy Studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxcheps.new.ox.ac.uk/MainSite%20pages/visitingfellows.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

At a ceremony in London on 6 March 2011 Alderman was named as the winner of the Chaim Bermant Prize for Journalism 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/46417/book-week-turns-a-page-celebrating-a-record-year]&lt;/ref&gt;

He describes himself as an unconventional Orthodox Jew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/families/article1344389.ece | location=London | work=The Times | title=Relative Values Geoffrey Alderman and his daughter Naomi | date=11 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Naomi Alderman]], Geoffrey Alderman's daughter, was the author of the winning novel of the 2006 Orange Award for New Writers with ''Disobedience''.

He is also an occasional contributor to Iran's [[PressTV]] channel.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Alderman [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jan/24/suppressing-press-tv-ofcom-licence?newsfeed=true "Suppressing Press TV is deplorable – Ofcom should restore its licence now"], ''The Guarian'', 24 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opinions==
===Judaism===
Alderman is a columnist for The ''[[Jewish Telegraph]]''.

===Higher education in Britain===
In the summer of 2008, following his inaugural professorial lecture at the [[University of Buckingham]], and criticisms of some aspects of UK higher education by the UK Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education, a brief parliamentary inquiry was undertaken into these allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/lecturers-pressed-to-boost-degree-results-848481.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Richard | last=Garner | title=Lecturers 'pressed to boost degree results' | date=17 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article4158426.ece | location=London | work=The Times | first=Geoffrey | last=Alderman | title=A grotesque bidding game is undermining university standards | date=18 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that inquiry (17 July 2008) the chairman of the House of Commons' Select Committee on Innovation, Universities and Skills accused the Quality Assurance Agency of being "toothless" and declared that the British degree classification system had "descended into farce".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2305795/University-degree-system-'is-a-farce'.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Stephen | last=Adams | title=University degree system 'is a farce' | date=17 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alderman himself gave written [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmselect/cmdius/memo/170/170memo0902.pdf] and oral evidence to a subsequent enquiry of the Select Committee into Students and Universities, whose report (2 August 2009) included an endorsement of Alderman's views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm/cmdius.htm|title=The House of Commons - Innovation, Universities, Science and Skills Committee 
Reports|website=publications.parliament.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/|title=The Times &amp; The Sunday Times|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Haredi sexual harassment===
In early 2012, the Jewish Chronicle reported that complaints were made against a column by Alderman in which he wrote that "it is well known that Charedi men are notorious harassers of the opposite sex", that these comments breached accuracy and discrimination rules. The Press Complaints Commission rejected these complaints because it was clear to readers that the content was written from Alderman's own perspective and whether or not the article was offensive requires subjective judgement. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/63979/pcc-rejects-alderman-complaint&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Of his dozen or so books, the best-known is ''Modern British Jewry'' (second edition, 1998, OUP). He has also written for the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography|New Dictionary of National Biography]]'', with special responsibility for post-1800 Jewish entries, and for ''[[The Guardian]]'' and ''[[The Jewish Chronicle]]''.

'''Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés''' (August 1478{{snd}}1557) was a Spanish historian and writer. He is commonly known as "Oviedo" even though his family name is Fernández. He participated in the Spanish colonization of the Caribbean, and wrote a long chronicle of this project which is one of the few [[primary source]]s about it. For three centuries, only a small portion of it was published, which was widely read in the 16th century in Spanish, English and French editions.

He was born in [[Madrid]] of a noble [[Asturias|Asturian]] lineage and educated in the court of [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand]] and [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella]]. At thirteen, he became page to their son, the ''Infante'' [[John, Prince of Asturias]]. After the Prince's death (October 4, 1497), Oviedo went to Italy, and there acted as secretary to [[Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba]]. In 1514 he was appointed supervisor of gold smeltings at [[Hispaniola|Santo Domingo]], and on his return to Spain in 1523 was appointed [[historiographer]] of the Indies. He paid five more visits to America before his death, in [[Valladolid]] in 1557.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Oviedo y Valdés, Gonzalo Fernandez de|volume=20|page=391}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one point he was placed in charge of the [[Fortaleza Ozama]], the famous fort in [[Santo Domingo]], [[Dominican Republic]], where there is a large statue of him, a gift to that country from a King of Spain.

==Works==

Oviedo's first literary work was a [[chivalric romance]] entitled, ''Libro del muy esforzado e invencible caballero Don Claribalte'' (''Book of the very striving and invincible knight Don Claribalte''). It was published in 1519 in [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]] by Juan Viñao, one of the prominent printers of that time. In the foreword, dedicated to [[Ferdinand of Aragón, Duke of Calabria]] (not to be confused with the King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]]), Oviedo relates that the work had been conceived and written while he was in Santo Domingo. Therefore, it seems that this was the first literary work created in the [[New World]].&lt;ref&gt;Agustín G. de Amezúa. Introduction to the facsimile reprint of ''Libro de Claribalte'' by the [[Spanish Royal Academy]], Madrid, 1956&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:De Oviedo 1557.jpg|thumb|left|upright|1557 cover of ''La historia general y natural de las Indias'']]
Oviedo wrote later two extensive works of permanent value, which for the most part were not published until three centuries after his death: ''La historia general y natural de las Indias'' and ''Las Quinquagenas de la nobleza de España''. The former work was first issued at Toledo (1526) in the form of a summary entitled ''La Natural hystoria de las Indias''; the first part of ''La Historia general de las Indias'' appeared at [[Seville]] in 1535; but the complete work was not published till 1851-1855, when it was edited by [[José Amador de los Rios|J.A. de los Rios]] for the Spanish Academy of History. The ''Quinquagenas'' is a collection of quaint, moralizing anecdotes in which Oviedo indulges in much lively gossip concerning eminent contemporaries. It was first published at Madrid in 1880, edited by Vicente de la Fuente.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

The ''Historia'', though written in a diffuse style, furnishes a mass of information collected at first hand. [[Bartolomé de las Casas|Las Casas]], the fellow contemporary chronicler of the Spanish colonization of the Caribbean, denounced Oviedo and the ''Historia'' thus: "one of the greatest tyrants, thieves, and destroyers of the Indies, whose ''Historia'' contains almost as many lies as pages".&lt;ref&gt;Liévano, 2002: 84&lt;/ref&gt; The incomplete Seville edition was widely read in the English and French versions published by Eden and Poleur, respectively, in 1555 and 1556.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

It is through Oviedo's book that Europeans came to learn about the [[hammock]], the [[pineapple]], and [[tobacco]], among other things used by the Native Americans that he encountered. The first illustration of a pineapple is credited to him. Shortly after Columbus was in Hispaniola,  Oviedo visited there and saw the natives using green wooden stakes lashed to a frame over a smouldering fire for cooking. The [[Taino]] word for this device was "barbacoa". There were other changes to the word including the French "Boucane".{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an English-born Irish [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[priest]], [[Roman Catholic theology|theologian]] and philosopher, who was born in [[Middlesbrough]] in the [[North Riding of Yorkshire]].&lt;ref name=obittimes/&gt; After studying chemistry and philosophy at [[Victoria University of Manchester|Manchester University]], he joined the Dominicans in 1949, where under Victor White he began his lifelong study of the works of [[Thomas Aquinas]]. Born John Ignatius McCabe, his novice master, [[Columba Ryan]], gave McCabe the religious name ''Herbert'', perhaps ironically, in honour of Saint [[Herbert of Derwentwater]], a seventh-century Lakeland hermit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mills |first=John Orme |date=2001-07-24 |title=Fr Herbert McCabe |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/fr-herbert-mccabe-9140202.html |work=The Independent |access-date=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He became editor of the journal ''New Blackfriars'' in 1965 but was removed in 1967 following a now-famous editorial in that journal in which he criticised the theologian [[Charles Davis (theologian)|Charles Davis]] for having left the Catholic Church. Davis left publicly, denouncing the church as corrupt. McCabe countered that of course the Church was corrupt but that this was no reason to leave it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McCabe |first1=Herbert |date=1967 |title=Comment |jstor=43244384 |journal=New Blackfriars |volume=48 |issue=561 |pages=226–229}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was reinstated three years later, and began his editorial that month in characteristically combative style: "As I was saying, before I was so oddly interrupted...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McCabe |first1=Herbert |date=1970 |title=Comment |jstor=43245647 |journal=New Blackfriars |volume=51 |issue=605 |pages=451–453}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent many years teaching at [[Blackfriars, Oxford|Blackfriars, Oxford University]], writing four books, ''The New Creation'', a study of the Sacraments, in 1964; ''Law, Love and Language'', on the centrality of language in ethics, in 1968; ''The Teaching of the Catholic Church'', a short catechism, in 1986; ''God Matters'' in 1987; and ''God Still Matters'', a collection of his articles, in 2002.  He was a member of the ''[[Slant (journal)|Slant]]'' group, and combined a commitment to the thought of [[Aquinas]] and [[Wittgenstein]] with a socialist political stance.

McCabe's sermons were carefully prepared and delivered with great intelligence and wit. A major theme was a caution against making God a god, of reducing the Creator to an object within this world, and thus committing [[idolatry]]. In 1974 McCabe became an [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] citizen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1337953/Herbert-McCabe.html Obituary in the ''Telegraph'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Terry Eagleton]] attributed to his friend McCabe the view that 'If you don't love, you're dead, and if you do, they'll kill you.' &lt;ref&gt;[[Terry Eagleton]], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCqHnwIR1PY 'The God Debate,'] [[Gifford Lecture]] 2010 53:22&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and career ==

Hermann Baumgarten was born in [[Wolfenbüttel]] in the [[Duchy of Brunswick]]. He studied [[philology]] and [[history]] at the [[University of Jena]] before becoming a [[journalist]] in 1855. In 1859 he began working at [[Maximilian Wolfgang Duncker|Maximilian Duncker]]'s "''literary bureau''", a [[Prussia]]n institution used to disseminate [[propaganda]].  In 1861, he also took up a teaching post at the [[Technical University of Karlsruhe]].&lt;ref name="A History" /&gt;

As a champion of Prussian/German [[liberalism]], Baumgarten faced the dilemma as to whether or not to accept the military and political successes of Prussia's conservative [[Minister President of Prussia|Prime Minister]], [[Otto von Bismarck]].  In 1866, Baumgarten published his support of Bismarck's policies in an essay entitled ''A Self-Criticism of German Liberalism''. This work essentially ended radical German liberalism as a force, whereupon many Prussians joined the Bismarck-supporting [[National Liberal Party (Germany)|National Liberal Party]]), and allowed the new German empire to [[Nationalization|nationalize]] and solidify.&lt;ref name="A History" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GHID" /&gt;

In 1872, Baumgarten became Professor of History at the [[Reichsuniversität Straßburg|Reichsuniversität]] in Strasbourg.&lt;ref name="GHID" /&gt;  During the late 1880s and early 1890s, Baumgarten made a significant political impression upon [[Max Weber]], Baumgarten's nephew by marriage.&lt;ref name="Weber" /&gt; Weber would go on to profoundly influence [[social theory]] and the remit of [[sociology]] itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/638565/Max-Weber Max Weber] (in English). ''Encyclopædia Britannica Online''. Retrieved March 25, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the age of 68, Baumgarten died in [[Strasbourg]], [[Alsace-Lorraine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stark|first=Wolfgang Heinrich|title=Hermann Baumgarten, 1825-1893|publisher=Erlangen-Nürnberg|year=1973|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XK0OAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=April 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Irina Konstantinovna Feodorova''' (28 November 1931, [[Leningrad]], [[USSR]] – 7 December 2010, [[Saint Petersburg]]) was a [[USSR|Soviet]] historian. Her field of expertise was the [[ethnography]], culture, folklore and language of the people of East Polynesia. Feodorova was doctor of historical sciences and a leading scientist of the Department of Australia, Oceania and Indonesia at the Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography (Russian Academy of Science) at the [[Kunstkamera]], St. Petersberg, the first Russian museum that was named after Peter the Great.  In 1981, Feodorova was given the honour of being named N. N. Miklouho-Maclay Laureate of the Presidium of the Russian Academy of Science.&lt;ref&gt;Recognized by [[Russian Academy of Science]]: Premium of Presidium of the Russian Academy of Science (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family and personal life==
Feodorova was born in Leningrad in 1931. Her father, Konstantin Andreevich Mozhajsky, worked in a printing house. Her mother, Lydia Romanovna Steinberg taught [[German language|German]] at schools in Leningrad. Feodorova and her husband, Mikhail Lvovich Fedorov, had one daughter, Olga Fedorova.

==Education and early career==
In 1964, Fedorova participated in the "VII International Congress of Archeology and Ethnography" in Moscow. In 1966, she completed her [[Master's degree]] with a [[thesis]] entitled, "Folklore of Easter island as a historical source".

==Scientific contributions==

===''Myths, legends of Easter Island''===
In 1978, Feodorova published her first [[monograph]], "Myths and legends of Easter Island".&lt;ref&gt;Myths, legends of Easter Island. 1978. Translation: Husvet-szigeti mitoszok… Budapest, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; It is a seminal study of the relics of Rapanui folklore. This publication earned Feodorova the honour of being named the "N. N. Miklouho-Macklay Laureate" of the "Presidium of the Russian Academy of Science" in 1981. In 1987, her work was translated into [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and republished in [[Budapest]]. The book includes Feodorova's translations of the Easter Island legends recorded in the 1956 manuscripts of the [[Norway|Norwegian]] researcher [[Thor Heyerdahl]]. Heyerdahl approached the Kunstkamera to help with the translation of the Rapanui language because of the institution's reputation in decipherment. He published the Feodorova translations in his "Works of the Norwegian archeological expedition" (Vol 2, 1965). {{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===''Myths and Legends of Easter Island''===
Feodorova continued to study Rapanui culture and in 1988 published her second monograph on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;''Myths and Legends of Easter Island'' (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; This work includes a basic dictionary of Rapanui language (direct and reverse). It also includes a translation of the 1974 publication of Rapanui text by the [[Germany|German]] researcher, [[Thomas Barthel]].

===''Easter Island. Sketches of culture of the 19th and 20th centuries''===
In 1994, Feodorova gained her [[Doctorate]] with the book, ''Easter island. Sketches of the culture of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries''&lt;ref&gt;''Easter island. Sketches of the culture of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries'' (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; The book examines the history of the population of Easter Island; the ethnogenesis of its inhabitants; and theories about the original ancient civilisation. Feodorova analysed the culture of the indigenous people of Rapanui including their folklore, language, chanting connected with string games, features of a tattoo and the stone statues. She examined the meaning of funeral braids and carved wooden figures.

===''Kohau Rongorongo tablets from Kunstkamera''===
In 1995, Feodorova published a third monograph. It contained her attempt at deciphering the two rongorongo tablets in the Kunstkamera. This work earned Feodorova the Premium of the Presidium of the Russian Academy of Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;"Kohau Rongorongo tablets from Kunstkamera" (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; The monograph presents the full texts and Feodorova's translations of two Rapanui plates from the Kunstkamera collection.

===Peer review of Kohau Rongorongo script research===
{{Main|Decipherment of rongorongo#Federova|l1=Decipherment of rongorongo: Feodorova}}
Feodorova's studies of the Kohau [[RongoRongo]] script date from the 1960s. More rigorous than most attempts, she restricts each glyph to a single [[logogram|logographic]] reading.&lt;ref&gt;Fedorova 1995&lt;/ref&gt; However, the results make little sense as texts. For example, the [[Rongorongo text C|Mamari]] calendar, the single rongorongo text that can be read, contains no calendrical information in Feodorova's decipherment, but reads instead like the following sample:
:''a root, a root, a root, a root, a root, a root'' [that is, a lot of roots], ''a tuber, he took, he cut a potato tuber, he dug up yam shoots, a yam tuber, a potato tuber, a tuber,''
which even Fedorova characterized as "worthy of a maniac".&lt;ref&gt;Pozdniakov &amp; Pozdniakov 2007:10&lt;/ref&gt; What Feodorova translates as "root", the small community of rongorongo specialists agree is instead a calendrical night. Konstantin Pozdniakov concluded that Feodorova's translations "are not accompanied by the least justification".&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal|author=Pozdniakov, Konstantin |year=1996 |title=Les Bases du Déchiffrement de l'Écriture de l'Ile de Pâques (The Bases of Deciphering the Writing of Easter Island) |url=http://pozdniakov.free.fr/14%20paques%201996.pdf |journal=[[Journal de la Société des Océanistes]] |volume=103 |issue=2 |page=293 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625101810/http://pozdniakov.free.fr/14%20paques%201996.pdf |archivedate=2008-06-25 |df= }} {{Fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Speaking Tablets From Easter Island''===
In 2001, Feodorova published her attempts at decoding, reading, and translating all the examples of ancient Rapanui text from museums around the world.&lt;ref&gt;"Speaking tablets from Easter island. Decoding, reading, translation (2001)"&lt;/ref&gt; This work includes the "Tomenika Tau a Ure" tablet recorded in the manuscript of Francis Mazier.

===''Missionaries of Easter Island''===
Feodorova's fifth book, ''Missionaries of Easter Island'' (2004) is devoted to the history of the first Catholic Rapanui mission and the relationship of the missionaries to original Rapanui culture. It uses rare archival materials and publications of the Catholic mission, the "Congregation de Sacres Coeurs" ([[Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary]]). Feodorova demonstrates the positive role the missionaries played in Rapanui in the 19th century in the study and preservation of the indigenous population and their culture.&lt;ref&gt;Missionaries of Easter Island (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other work===

====Articles====
Feodorova has contributed many articles to the international scientific community. Her focus is the ethnography, culture, folklore and language of the inhabitants of Easter Island. She has also written about the inhabitants of other islands of Polynesia such as Hawaii, New Zealand, Marquises, Mangarewa, Tahiti, Samoa and Tonga. Feodorova's other studies concern the origin of people of Oceania; Pacific oceanic contacts; the role of the [[Areoi]] (a society of secret warriors) in Polynesia; the linguistics of Polynesian and American Indian languages. She has also researched petroglyphs, zodiac signs, ancient calendars, paleoastronomy, toponyms, terms of relationship and social systems, material culture, mythology, religious views, magic fairy tales, games, tattoos and the meanings of Polynesian sculptural and carved images.

====The way of the ancestors====
From 1995, Feodorova was a member of the informal cultural group "The way of the ancestors". The group researched and published the history and the work of the first Russian round-the-world expedition (1803−1806). 
As part of the Russian world expedition, [[Adam Johann von Krusenstern|A. J. Krusenstern]] in the "Nadeshda" and J. F. Lisjansky in the "Neva" sailed to the islands of East Polynesia, including Easter Island, Marquesas and Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;''Atlas k Puteshestvii︠u︡ vokrug svi︠e︡ta Kapitana Kruzenshtern'', Kruzenshtern, Ivan Fedorovich, 1770-1846. Published V Sanktpeterburgě : [s.n.], 1813&lt;/ref&gt; Feodorova contributed to the scientific album, ''Around the world with Krusenstern'' (2005) and was the co-author in the collective monograph, "Russians in the 'Silent sea'" (2006). In 2001, the memorial edition, " The Russian Geographical Society: 165 years of service to Fatherland". Feodorova studied the diaries and letters of I. K. Horner, F. I. Shemelin, M. I. Ratmanov and other participants of the first Russian round-the-world voyage.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Unpublished work===
Feodorova's last work "The Semantics of sculptural and carved images in subjects of the Polynesian collections of Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography (Russian Academy of Science)" and many other works is unpublished.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2935">'''Jean Dumont Baron de Carlscroon''' (13 January 1667 &amp;ndash;{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} 13 May 1727) was a [[France|French]] writer and historian. He followed the profession of arms but, not obtaining promotion so rapidly as he expected, he left the service and travelled through different parts of Europe. He stopped in Holland with the intention of publishing an account of his travels. But in the interval, at the request of his bookseller, he wrote and published several pamphlets, which were eagerly sought after, owing to the unceremonious manner in which he treated the ministry of France. Thus deprived of all hope of employment in his own country, he thought of forming a permanent establishment in Holland, and accordingly commenced a course of lectures on public law. The project succeeded far beyond his expectations and some useful compilations which he published in the same period made him well known in other countries. The emperor appointed him his historiographer, and some time afterwards conferred on him the title of ''Baron de Carlscroon''. He died in [[Vienna]].

Dumont was also the author of ''Lettres historiques contenant ce qui se passe de plus important en Europe''. This periodical, begun in 1692 with two volumes appearing annually, he edited until 1710, when it was continued by [[Jacques Basnage]] and others until 1728. The earlier volumes are much prized.

'''Johann Peter Berg''' (September 3, 1737 – March 3, 1800) was a [[Germany|German]] [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[theologian]], historian, and [[oriental studies|Orientalist]].

Berg was born in [[Bremen]], and studied at [[Leiden University]]. In 1762 he became Professor of [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Languages of Asia|Oriental]] languages at the [[University of Bremen]], but moved in 1763 to the [[University of Duisburg]], where he taught nearly until his death in Duisburg in 1800. He translated various [[Arabic language|Arabic]] works, and lectured on a wide range of theological subjects. He also published an annotated copy of the Arabic dictionary of [[Jacobus Golius|Golius]], which served as the basis for that of [[Georg Freytag|Freytag]].

[[C. R. Conder|Conder]] and [[HH Kitchener|Kitchener]], in their ''[[Survey of Western Palestine]]'' (vol. 1, p. 365), thinks this place to have been the village of ''el-Messhed'', about 2.5 miles south-east of Sepphoris and where is now the alleged tomb of Jonah the prophet, a view corroborated by [[Jerome]] (in his Proaem. to Jonah) and by [[Benjamin of Tudela]]. [[Marcus Jastrow]] explains "Gob'batha" as meanings "hills". In [[J. Payne Smith]]'s ''A Compendious Syriac Dictionary'' the word is explained as meaning "a pit, hole, den, cavern." In the Leiden MS. of the Jerusalem Talmud, the name is written in a variant form, גו פפתה, while in the Rome MS. of the Jerusalem Talmud the word is written גופפתה.

Albright]], "The Site of Tirzah and the Topography of Western Manasseh", in: ''The Journal of the Palestine Oriental Society'', vol. XI, Jerusalem 1931, p. 248, who says that the Arabic name ''eṭ Ṭaiyibeh'' (shortened for ''Ṭaiyibet al-Ism'') was given to the city Ophrah as a euphemism, meaning "the goodly," to offset the name ''Afrīn'' which, in Arabic connotation, means "demons" (cf. [[American Schools of Oriental Research|Annual of the American Schools of Oriental Research]] [AASOR], IV, pp. 130–ff.; ''ibid.'' VI (1926), p. 35; [[Albrecht Alt]], PJB 1926, pp. 68–ff.). Although the meaning of "Ophrah" in Hebrew has nothing to do with its Arabic connotation, nevertheless, such appellations for cities were thought of as being offensive, warranting its name change.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conder|Conder]] &amp; [[HH Kitchener|Kitchener]] with the biblical city of Rabba (Josh. 15:60) because of their phonetic similarity, and which site is located in the territory given by lot to the tribe of Judah. Still, it is only a conjecture, without any valid oral tradition to substantiate the claim, or otherwise refute the claim.&lt;ref&gt;C.R. Conder &amp; H.H. Kitchener, ''The Survey of Western Palestine: Memoirs of the Topography, Orography, Hydrography, and Archaeology'', vol. 3, [[Committee of the Palestine Exploration Fund]]: London 1883, p. [https://archive.org/stream/surveyofwesternp03conduoft#page/314/mode/1up 314].&lt;/ref&gt; Others have speculated that the Rabbah of Joshua 15:60 may be the town known as ''Rbt'', an unidentified town believed to have been near the biblical [[Gezer]] and mentioned in [[Thutmosis III]]’s list of Canaanite cities (no. 105), and what is also thought to be mentioned in a cuneiform letter found at Taanach. According to two [[el-Amarna letters]] (289, 290) sent by the king of Jerusalem to the pharaoh, Milkilu, the king of Gezer, together with Shuwardata captured ''Rubutu'' with the aid of mercenaries.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia Judaica'' (2nd edition), volume 17 (Ra–Sam), Keter Publishing House Ltd.: Jerusalem 2007, p. [https://ketab3.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/encyclopaedia-judaica-v-17-ra-sam.pdf 7]&lt;/ref&gt; The problem with this identification, however, is that no one has yet found a city near Gezer by the name of ''Rbt'' or ''Rubutu'', and even if they had, Gezer - and by way of extension, Rabbah - would not be in the territorial domain of the tribe of Judah, but rather in what belonged to Ephraim (cf. Josh. 21:20–21). It was, therefore, imperative to look for the Rabbah in the tribal inheritance of Judah.}}

'''''Lost Cities and Vanished Civilizations''''' is a 1962 book by [[Robert Silverberg]] that deals with the then-current [[archaeology]] studies of six past civilizations.  The book is divided into six chapters, and each deals with a particular civilization: [[Pompeii]], [[Troy]], [[Nicola Athapaskans|Nicola]], [[Babylon]], [[Chichen Itza]], and [[Angkor Wat]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/robert-silverberg-24/lost-cities-and-vanished-civilizations/&lt;/ref&gt;  Silverberg also deals with the historical search for the past through the life works of archaeologists such as [[Heinrich Schliemann]] and [[Sir Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baronet|Henry Rawlinson]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2394">'''Lothar Höbelt''' (born 30 June 1956 in [[Vienna]]) is an Austrian historian and adjunct professor of Modern History at the [[University of Vienna]]. His research areas are political and constitutional history of the 19th and 20th centuries, and the [[Thirty Years' War]]. He also lectures at the [[Theresian Military Academy]].

He studied history at the University of Vienna from 1974 to 1981, earning his doctorate ''[[Sub auspiciis Praesidentis]]'' (Promotion under the auspices of the President, the highest level of academic achievement in Austria). He was affiliated with universities in the United Kingdom and the United States, including the [[University of Chicago]], until he was appointed adjunct Professor of Modern History at the University of Vienna in 1997. He once sympathized with the [[Freedom Party of Austria]], but would eventually sympathize more with the [[Austrian People's Party]] under the chancellorship of [[Wolfgang Schüssel]]. However, he supported the presidential candidacy of Freedom Party politician [[Barbara Rosenkranz]] in 2010 and was the head of her supporting committee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://derstandard.at/1269448954810 ''Barbara Rosenkranz „überholt nicht links“''], [[derStandard.at]], 6 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4370">[[File:Martín Sarmiento.jpeg|right|200px|thumb|''Martín Sarmiento'']]
'''Martín Sarmiento''' or '''Martiño Sarmiento''', also '''Father Sarmiento''' (born '''Pedro José García Balboa'''), ([[Villafranca del Bierzo]], [[El Bierzo]], March 9, 1695 - [[Madrid]], December 7, 1772) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] scholar, writer and [[Benedictine]] monk, illustrious representative of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].

He wrote on a wide variety of subjects, including [[Literature]], [[Medicine]], [[Botany]], [[Ethnography]], [[History]], [[Theology]], [[Linguistics]], etc.

== His life ==
When he was four months old, he moved with his family to [[Pontevedra]], where he spent  his childhood and youth. On 3 May 1710, when he was 15, he moved to [[Madrid]] to join  [[Benedictine]] order.
He was named presbyter in 1720, Sarmiento lived in Asturias until 1725 like a professor in Cebrio and Oviedo. Later he left his mother in Pontevedra. He was definitively settled in Madrid, stay that is interrupted between February 1726 and May 1727, when he moved to Toledo to catalog the books of the cathedral, and  also to visit three times Galicia.

When he was 35 years old, he became interested in language again. He thought that people ignored the meaning of the words. He was really interested in languages in general, especially Romanesque languages, but above all, Spanish and Galician. Sarmiento thought that Galician should be taught in schools and priests should know it in order to confess people.
In 1745 he returned to Galicia. On this trip he writes the names of the places he is going through in a notebook. He liked to investigate the etymology of the Galician words. He wrote a book in Galician called Colloquium of twenty rustic galleys, thanks to which we know the Galician that was spoken at that time. It contains 1,200 songs sung by a group of Galicians returning from Madrid. They tell us about the death of King Philip V was and he described the celebrations of the accession to the throne of Ferdinand VI.

== His thought ==

Sarmiento was not only interested in linguistics, he was interested in other disciplines such as botany and medicine. He had a big knowledge of the names of the plants and their health properties. He was quite concerned about the improvement of the technical and economic level of his country, specially in the Enlightenment ideas. His erudition in many disciplines made him be commissioned the iconographic program that would decorate the Royal Palace of Madrid. Sarmiento designed an ambitious allegory of the history of the Spanish monarchy for the palace, it was so complex that   only a part of it was done.

He fought, with Feijoo, against superstition and ignorance, proposing to open libraries in the villages. He had one of the most important libraries in Spain at that time. Unlike his teacher Feijoo, Sarmiento understood that it was necessary to know and keep traditions and popular culture. In that he was a great precursor and he contributed to the investigation and recovery of the Galician culture.

Sarmiento died at San Martin convent in Madrid, on December, 7th,  1772, aged 77.

He posted two books in Feijoo´s memory Demostración crítico-apologética del Theatro Crítico Universal in 1732. He wrote other books but they were not published.

*''Memorias para la historia de la poesía y poetas españoles'', (1741-1745), first edition, Madrid, 1775.

There is a wide range of ways in which people have represented the '''Mexican Revolution in popular culture'''. One of the most influential pioneers in this new philosophy of Mexican identity was [[Samuel Ramos]] who acknowledged [[Ortega]] for his influence of emphasizing the understanding of man in his concrete historical circumstances.  In his book, ''Profile of man and Culture in Mexico'', Ramos tried to develop a  [[psychoanalysis]] of [[Mexican people|Mexican]] character.  He felt Mexican problems were the result of imitating [[Europe]]an models without being able to overcome the legacy of [[revolutions]], [[dictatorships]] and [[economic stagnation]].  He felt that Mexican history was the expression of a collective inferiority complex stemming from the results of the [[Spanish Conquest]], racial mixture and a disadvantageous geographical position.  He believed that in hiding their inferiority, Mexicans had resorted to unhealthy compensations including aggressive assertions of power that have isolated Mexicans from one another and prevented the attainment of a sense of community.  The solution Ramos proposed to this problem was a greater self-consciousness of a uniquely Mexican identity and the need for an [[education system]] with a [[humanistic]] orientation that would counter the materialistic civilization stemming from [[North America#Human geography|North American]] influence.  Even though Ramos was an intellectual literary leader, in the effort to develop a national philosophy more effectively geared to Mexican circumstances, he was vulnerable to the accusations that he was attached to a type of [[utopian]] thinking.  He was accused of not being able to bridge the gap between the values to which he was attached and the concrete political-economic circumstances of Mexican society.  [[Octavio Paz]] carried on Ramos’ psychoanalytic approach but developed it in a closer relationship to the concrete realities of Mexican historical developments and its contemporary economic-political problems.  Paz is also influential because he emphasizes context of [[Latin American]] and [[Third World]] political development. 

The paragraphs thus far have described the history and development of the new paths and ideas that influenced the literature produced during the Revolution but here is a look at poetry specifically. The first decade of the [[Mexican Revolution]] put an end to the years of "peace" that the country was used to during the [[Porfirio Díaz|Diaz]] dictatorship.  The turbulent political decade that followed the Diaz reign showed little cultural activity according to [[David Foster (author)|David Foster]]. 
&lt;!--
 Wikipedia only had these two [[David Foster]], producer and [[David Foster Wallace]], fiction author. This David Foster appeared to be neither. I got 7 of 8 so maybe you can help. [[User:Jessemonroy650|meatclerk]] 09:23, 17 August 2006 (UTC) 
--&gt;
But the revolutionary events did have some impact on [[literature]] and the [[plastic arts]].  Some poets like [[Amado Nervo|Nervo]], never showed the conflict of the times in his poetry.  But other poets like [[José Juan Tablada|Tablada]], [[Enrique González Martínez]], and [[Ramón López Velarde]] who produced during this period between [[modernism]] and the [[Vanguardism|vanguardia]] movement have been credited as the major figures who contributed to the development of twentieth-century poetry in Mexico.  In 1911, [[Enrique González Martínez]] published "''Tuercele el cuello al cisne''"  (Wring the Neck of the Swan) written in 1910 which called for a change to the new image and a new language.  In [[Rubén Darío|Dario]]'s "''Cantos de vida y esperanza''" (Songs of Life and Hope) he writes without breaking with past but returns to society and expresses concern with political events.

'''Sir Neil Colquhoun Begg''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|KBE|size=85%}} (13 April 1915 – 25 June 1995) was a New Zealand paediatrician, historian and [[cricket]]er. He played three [[first-class cricket|first-class]] matches for the [[Otago cricket team]] after the beginning of World War II, but he is most noted as a paediatrician and an historian. He served as director of medical services for the [[Plunket Society]] from 1956 to 1977, and, with his brother [[Alexander Charles Begg|Charles]], wrote four books on the history of [[Fiordland]]. He chaired the [[Heritage New Zealand|New Zealand Historic Places Trust]] between 1978 and 1986.

==Early life and family==
Born in [[Dunedin]] on 13 April 1915, Begg was the younger son of surgeon [[Charles Mackie Begg]] and Lillian Helen Lawrance Begg (née Treadwell),&lt;ref name="DNZB Neil Begg"&gt;{{DNZB | title=Begg, Alexander Charles and Begg, Neil Colquhoun | first=Linda | last=Bryder | id=5b18 | accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and nephew of [[Robert Campbell Begg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{DNZB | title=Begg, Robert Campbell | first=Paul | last=Goldstone | id=4b18 | accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father served throughout [[World War I]], becoming the senior medical officer with the [[New Zealand Expeditionary Force]], but contracted influenza and pneumonia and died at [[Twickenham]], London, in February 1919. Begg and his mother and brother, who had travelled to England at the end of the war, then returned to New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{DNZB | title=Begg, Charles Mackie | first=Neil | last=Begg | id=5g19 | accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Begg was educated at [[John McGlashan College]] in Dunedin, and then studied medicine at the [[University of Otago]], graduating [[MB ChB]] in 1941. A tall man, Begg was an all-round sportsman, and represented the university at cricket, golf and skiing.&lt;ref name="DNZB Neil Begg" /&gt;

On 11 April 1942, Begg married Margaret Milne "Margot" MacLean, a librarian, at Dunedin. She was a granddaughter of [[John Shand]], one of the foundation professors of the University of Otago. The couple went on to have four children.&lt;ref name="DNZB Neil Begg" /&gt;

==World War II service==
In February 1941, Begg was commissioned as a lieutenant in the [[New Zealand Medical Corps]], and posted to the Otago University Medical Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://search.ancestry.com.au/cgi-bin/sse.dll?indiv=try&amp;db=NZWWIIApptPromTransResig&amp;h=11405 |title=New Zealand World War II appointments, promotions, transfers and resignations, 1939–1945 |year=2014 |website= |publisher=Ancestry.com Operations |accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to serve in the Middle East, Italy and the United Kingdom with the [[2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force]], rising to the rank of major.&lt;ref name="DNZB Neil Begg" /&gt;

==Cricket==
A right-arm medium pace bowler and a tail-end batsman, Begg played three [[first-class cricket|first-class]] matches for [[Otago cricket team|Otago]] in the 1939/40 and 1940/41 seasons. He took five wickets, at an average of 47.60, with best bowling figures of 2 for 43. With the bat, he made a total of 30 runs in four innings including one not out, with a high score of 16 and an average of 10.00.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=CricketArchive |title=Neil Begg |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/3/3365/3365.html |accessdate= 6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Begg played one match for New Zealand Services, on 12 July 1945, against [[Plum Warner|P.F. Warner]]'s XI at [[Lord's]], bowling 11 overs without success and scoring 1 not out with the bat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/136/136716.html |title=Sir PF Warner's XI v New Zealand Services |date= |website=CricketArchive |publisher= |accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical career==
Between 1946 and 1948, Begg trained in [[paediatrics]] in London, Edinburgh and Stockholm, earning a diploma in child health in 1947, and membership of the [[Royal College of Physicians]] and the [[Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh]] in 1948. Returning to Dunedin the following year, he was appointed as a paediatrician at [[Dunedin Public Hospital]], Queen Mary Maternity Hospital, and the Karitane-Harris Hospitial in [[Andersons Bay]]. He was also a lecturer in paediatrics at the [[Otago Medical School]] from 1949 to 1976.&lt;ref name="DNZB Neil Begg" /&gt;

An admirer of Sir [[Truby King]], Begg served as medical director of the [[Plunket Society]] between 1956 and 1977, and was a leading advocate for preventive medicine. He campaigned for the [[Water fluoridation|fluoridation]] of public water supplies, the eradication of [[hydatids]] and [[bovine tuberculosis]], and the development of a milk biscuit for protein-deprived children in developing countries. Between 1971 and 1976 he served as the medical advisor to the New Zealand Food Bank, which distributed the biscuits overseas. His parental reference book, ''The New Zealand child and his family'', was published in 1970.&lt;ref name="DNZB Neil Begg" /&gt;

Begg gave service to various professional bodies, as president of the Paediatric Society of New Zealand, chair of the council of the New Zealand branch of the [[British Medical Association]] from 1964 to 1966, and president of the [[New Zealand Medical Association]] in 1974.&lt;ref name="DNZB Neil Begg" /&gt;

==Historian==
Begg and his brother Charles became experts on the history of Fiordland. Their first book, ''Dusky Bay'', was published in 1966 and won the [[Hubert Church]] Memorial Award for prose. This was followed by the publication of ''James Cook and New Zealand'' in 1969, ''Port Preservation'' in 1973, and ''The World of John Boultbee'' in 1979.&lt;ref name="DNZB Neil Begg" /&gt;

He served on the council of the New Zealand Historic Places Trust from 1970 to 1978, and as the trust's chair between 1978 and 1986.&lt;ref name="DNZB Neil Begg" /&gt;

==Honours==
Begg was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh in 1957, the New Zealand Medical Association in 1976, and the Royal College of Physicians in 1977.&lt;ref name="DNZB Neil Begg" /&gt;

In the [[1972 New Year Honours]] Begg was appointed an [[Order of the British Empire|Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] for services to the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=45556 |date=1 January 1972 |page=42 |supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to [[Order of the British Empire|Knight Commander]] of the same order for services to the [[Heritage New Zealand|New Zealand Historic Places Trust]] and the community in the [[1986 New Year Honours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=50362 |date=31 December 1985 |page=30 |supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Begg died at his home in the Dunedin suburb of [[Maori Hill]] on 25 June 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dunedin.govt.nz/facilities/cemeteries/cemeteries_search?recordid=159630&amp;type=Cremation |title=Cemeteries search |date= |website= |publisher=Dunedin City Council |accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wife died in Dunedin in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dunedin.govt.nz/facilities/cemeteries/cemeteries_search?recordid=169992&amp;type=Cremation |title=Cemeteries search |date= |website= |publisher=Dunedin City Council |accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nicolaas Godfried van Kampen''' (15 May 1776, [[Haarlem]] – 15 March 1839, [[Amsterdam]]) was a Dutch Mennonite author and deacon.

While never university educated, he studied literature and history and published a large number of writings, including a history of the French domination of Europe (1810-1823, eight volumes). In 1829 he was called to teach Dutch literature and history at the Athenaeum (university) of Amsterdam.

During his time in [[Leiden]] he was a deacon of the Mennonite congregation (1812-1815, 1818-1819, 1821-1829).&lt;ref&gt;Zijpp, Nanne van der. "Kampen, Nicolaas Godfried van (1776-1839)."

==Works==
In the early 19th century, he published ''Beknopte Geschiedenis der Letteren en Wetenschappen in de Nederlanden, van de Vroegste Tijden af, tot op het Begin van de Negentiende Eeuw'' (Brief History of Literature and Sciences in the Netherlands, from the Earliest Times, unto the beginning of the Nineteenth Century).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Snelders|first=H.

'''Nicolas Trigault''' (1577–1628) was a Walloon [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]], and a [[Christian missionaries|missionary]] in [[China]]. He was also known by his [[latin]]ised name '''Trigautius''' or '''Trigaultius''', and his Chinese name '''Jin Nige''' ({{zh|t=金尼閣|s=金尼阁|hp=Jīn Nígé}}).

==Life and work==
Born in [[Douai]] (then part of the [[Spanish Netherlands]], now part of [[France]]), he became a Jesuit in 1594. Trigault left Europe to do missionary work in Asia around 1610, eventually arriving at [[Nanjing]], China in 1611. He was later brought by the Chinese Catholic [[Li Zhizao]] to his hometown of [[Hangzhou]] where he worked as one of the first [[Christian missionaries|missionaries]] ever to reach that city and was eventually to die there in 1628.

In late 1612 Trigault was appointed by the China Mission's Superior, [[Niccolo Longobardi]] as the China Mission's [[wikt:procurator|procurator]] (recruitment and [[public relations|PR]] representative) in Europe. He sailed from Macau on February 9, 1613, and arrived in Rome on October 11, 1614, by way of India, the [[Persian Gulf]] and Egypt.&lt;ref name="Mungello"&gt;{{cite book

It was during this trip to Europe that Trigault edited and translated (from Italian to Latin) [[Matteo Ricci]]'s "China Journal", or ''[[De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas]]''. (He, in fact, started the work aboard the ship when sailing from Macau to India). The work was published in 1615 in [[Augsburg]]; it was later translated into many European languages and widely read.&lt;ref name="Mungello"/&gt; The French translation, which appeared in 1616, was translated from Latin by Trigault's own nephew, David-Floris de Riquebourg-Trigault.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Vc07AAAAcAA Histoire de l'expédition chrestienne au royaume de la Chine entreprise par les PP. de la Compagnie de Jésus: comprise en cinq livres esquels est traicté fort exactement et fidelelement des moeurs, loix et coustumes du pays, et des commencemens très-difficiles de l'Eglise naissante en ce royaume]'' (1616) - French translation of ''De Christiana expeditione'' by D.F. de Riquebourg-Trigault. Full text available on Google Books. The translator mentions his relation to N. Trigault on p. 4 of the Dedication ("Epistre Dedicatoire")&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1618, Trigault sailed from Lisbon with over 20 newly recruited Jesuit missionaries, and arrived in Macau in April 1619.&lt;ref name="Mungello"/&gt;

Later, Lu Zhìwei 陸志韋 (1947) countered with the theory that Trigault's system must represent a Shanxi dialect, because his book had been completed in that province.

Aided by a converted Chinese, he also produced the first Chinese version of ''[[Aesop's Fables]]'' (況義 "Analogy"), published in 1625.

In the 1620s Trigault became involved in a dispute over the correct Chinese terminology for the Christian God and defended the use of the term ''[[Shangdi]]'' that had been prohibited in 1625 by the Jesuit Superior General [[Muzio Vitelleschi]]. [[André Palmeiro]], the Society of Jesus inspector assigned the task of investigating and reporting on the circumstances of Trigault's death in 1628, on information from Trigault's confessor [[Lazzaro Cattaneo]], stated that a mentally unstable Trigault had become deeply depressed after failing to successfully defend the use of the term, and had committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Brockey, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MMA" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1779">'''Bredo Otto Anton von Munthe af Morgenstierne''' (6 March 1871 in [[Copenhagen]] &amp;ndash; 20 May 1945 in Copenhagen) was a Danish historian of [[nobility]] and [[history of architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Fabritius]], "Otto von Munthe af Morgenstierne", in: [[Povl Engelstoft]] &amp; [[Svend Dahl]] (eds.), ''[[Dansk Biografisk Leksikon]]'', København: [[J.H. Schultz Forlag]] 1932–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the son of [[Captain (armed forces)|Captain]] Otto Ludvig Michael von [[Munthe af Morgenstierne]] (1831–1899) and Baroness Anna Helene Mariane [[Løvenskiold]] (1839–1921), and graduated as [[cand. jur.]] in 1898. He became a Knight of the [[Order of the Dannebrog]] in 1931. He inherited ''Det [[Munthe af Morgenstierne|Munthe-Morgenstierne]]-[[Løvenskiold]]'ske Fideikommis'' in 1921, and was chairman of the Urne Endowment from 1919.

He wrote on the history of nobility and on [[history of architecture]], and published books on [[Nicolai Eigtved]] (1924), [[Odd Fellow Palæet]] in Copenhagen (1926) and Field Marshal [[Michael Numsen]] i 1938. He also wrote on the position of the Norwegian nobility compared to the Danish nobility (''Personalhistorisk Tidsskrift'', Vol. 9, I, 1929), where he defended ''[[Danmarks Adels Aarbog]]'' against criticism from Norwegian historians.

He married Ella Caroline Hinrichsen and secondly from 1917 Martha Marie [[Paus]] (b. 1876 i Christiania), daughter of [[Ole Paus (1846–1931)|Ole Paus]] (1846–1931) and Birgitte Halvordine Schou (1848–1923).

A painting of him by Count [[Preben Knuth]] (1937) and a miniature by [[Svend Rønne]] (1920) exist.

'''Personal Archiving''' is a branch of [[archival science]] and [[genealogy]], focusing on the capture and preservation of an individual's personal papers and other documentary output, generally by the individuals concerned.  It is often related to family history, when family historians are engaged in capturing their own living history to leave as a legacy for future generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Nick |last1=Barratt |title=Nick Barratt's guide to your ancestors lives |page=272 |ISBN=1-84884-056-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This branch of family history is allied to the growth in activities such as photograph and record scanning which seeks to preserve materials beyond their original life.

Modern personal archiving is often concerned with [[digital preservation]], especially with collating individual's content from [[social media]] websites and ensuring the long-term preservation of this.  This often deals with migration of digital content, as a means of preservation, rather than the tradition tasks of conservation of paper-based records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Why everyone has to be a historian in the digital age |publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/world_news_america/8999128.stm |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CHT0CEFZ |archivedate=2012-11-19 |date=2010-09-17 |accessdate=2012-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Form and Motivation==
Individuals involved in personal archiving consider all media to be relevant sources as long as this relates to the life, memories and experiences of a person. The majority of material is written, photographic, audio or video in nature. Those experiences can relate to their lives, those of living relatives or ancestors.
Those engaged in this practice also see their life experiences as a potential source of historical and cultural record, as well as being able to re-live those moments personally.  Many see the digital age as bringing an opportunity to leave a richer legacy for future generations.

== Examples of Personal Archives ==
Personal archives may not always be in the vein of genealogy. They may not always even be indicative of the individual who created the collection. A personal archive can range massively in content. For example one individual may deem their record collection as a personal archive and then another person may deem their dry-cleaning receipts worthy of retention. One such example of the latter was the actress [[Vivien Leigh]]. What will be of interest for research in the future is unpredictable. However, Leigh's laundry receipts provided insight into how mid twentieth century [[haute couture]] was preserved and presented in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/b1bf5044-f5ba-11e3-afd3-00144feabdc0|title=Personal Archives: documenting the stories of our lives|last=|first=|date=|website=Financial Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conducting Personal Archiving==
{{howto|section|date=October 2012}}
* Choose an online or offline repository to store memories, experiences and living history, where it will be secured for future generations
* Gather existing material, files, documents, scans, photographs, into one place and decide what you think is worth preserving and naming.
* Choose a categorization or organization method.
* Use preservation safe measures to secure your materials so that they last for posterity.
* Invite other family members to join and add to the archive making a family repository. From materials that you have uploaded you can make interesting representations like timelines, timecapsules photo galleries for yourself and ancestors.
* Begin capturing ongoing material, writing your memories, events and experiences, allowing you to leave a written legacy.

'''David Bagrationi''' ({{lang-ka|დავით ბაგრატიონი}}, {{lang|ka-Latn|Davit Bagrationi}}), also known as '''David the Regent''' ({{lang-ka|დავით გამგებელი}}, {{lang|ka-Latn|Davit Gamgebeli}}) (1 July 1767 in [[Tbilisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] &amp;ndash; 13 May 1819 in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]]), was a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] royal prince ([[batonishvili]]), writer and scholar, was a [[regent]] of the Kingdom of [[Kartl-Kakheti]], eastern Georgia, from December 28, 1800 to January 18, 1801.

The eldest son of the last Kartli-Kakhetian, King [[George XII of Georgia|George XII]] by his first wife [[Ketevan Andronikashvili]], he was educated in [[Russia]] (1787–1789), and served there as a colonel of the [[Imperial Russian Army|Russian army]] from 1797 to 1798. He was proclaimed as [[Heir Apparent]] by his father on February 22, 1799 and confirmed by the Russian [[Tsar]] [[Paul I of Russia|Paul I]], an official protector of Georgia, on 18 April 1799. In 1800, he attempted to modernize the law and administration. He became a [[lieutenant general]] the same year.

On his father's death in December 1800, David became the head of the Royal House of [[Bagrationi dynasty|Bagrationi]] but was not allowed to ascend the throne of Kartli-Kakheti. David ruled briefly between the time of his father's death (December 28, 1800) and the arrival of General Knorring (May 24, 1801).&lt;ref&gt;Suny, Ronald Grigor (1994), ''The Making of the Georgian Nation: 2nd edition'', p. 357. [[Indiana University Press]], {{ISBN|0-253-20915-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1800 the Russian Tsar had prohibited him from doing that without Russian consent. On January 18, 1801 he was surprised by a decree of Paul I declaring the annexation of the Kingdom to the [[Russian Empire]]. He tried to remain in power as de facto head of state. In May 1801 Russian General Carl Heinrich Knorring removed him from power and established a provisional government headed by General Ivan Petrovich Lasarev. Prince David was brought to [[St Petersburg]] under a military escort on February 18, 1803. From 1812 to 1819, he held a seat in the [[Governing Senate|Senate]] of the Russian Empire.

He married in 1800 Princess Elene [[Abamelik]] (1770—1836), and died childless in 1819. He was buried at the [[Alexander Nevsky Monastery]].

Influenced by the ideas of [[France|French]] [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], he was the first Georgian translator of [[Voltaire]]. He was also an author of a research on Georgian history ([[Georgian language|Georgian]], 1814), ''Review of the Georgian Law'' ([[Russian language|Russian]], 1811—1816), ''Abridged Manual of Physics'' (Georgian, 1818), and several poems.

'''Rodrigo de Cerrato''' or '''Rodrigo Cerratense''', '''Rodrigo Manuel Cerratense''' or '''de Cerrato''' or '''El Cerratense''' (*[[Calzada de Calatrava]], [[Ciudad Real]], before 1259 &amp;ndash; after 1276) was a [[Castilian people|Castilian]] historian and [[hagiographer]] of the second half of the 13th century.

Not much is known of his life.  He was born in Calzada de Calatrava and was a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friar in the convent of [[Santa Cruz de Segovia]], one of the oldest Dominican foundations.  His surname ''Cerratense'' may derive from the fact that he wrote his works in the monastery of [[San Pelayo de Cerrato]].

He lived during the reign of [[Alfonso X]] and wrote around 1276 several ''Vitas sanctorum'', an important hagiography that concerns various Spanish [[saints]], including the [[Seven Apostolic Men]].  This version conserves various summaries or expansions of the biographies of the saints.

The book ends with a very short ''Chronicon'' (''Crónicon''), or chronicle, which runs from the birth of [[Jesus Christ|Christ]] to the death of [[Ferdinand III of Castile]].  The ''Crónicon'' corrects some dates found in the ''Anales toledanos'', or [[Toledo, Spain|Toledan]] annals.  The first reference to Rodrigo de Cerrato dates from 1259 and he must have lived until 1276, which is based on an interpretation of ''Crónicon'' by [[Fidel Fita]].

==Buenos Aires Underground dispute==
In 2012, Sonia Berjman presented, together with the association Basta de Demoler, an ''[[Recurso de amparo|amparo]]'' action aimed at stopping work related to the construction of the Plaza Francia station of the extension of [[Line H (Buenos Aires Underground)|Line H]] of the Buenos Aires underground. This presentation was due to the fact that, in February of that year, excavation work had begun in the [[Plaza Intendente Alvear]], which had been designed by the landscaper Carlos Thays in 1897, destroying the original design, the old trees, and its historic ravine. By law the aforementioned station should instead have been located near the UBA's {{ill|Faculty of Law (University of Buenos Aires)|es|Facultad de Derecho (Universidad de Buenos Aires)|lt=Faculty of Law}}, being that the Plaza Intendente Alvear is part of Historic Protection Area No. 14, and for that reason the extraction of vegetal species, as well as the modification of its design, roads, and paths are prohibited. The presentation sought to protect the environment and the cultural and historical heritage of the city, and also highlighted the failure to adequately assess the project's [[environmental impact]].

In February 2013, the [[Buenos Aires Underground]] company (SBASE) acknowledged the error and reconstructed the Plaza Intendente Alvear. 

As a result of these actions, the City Legislature modified the route of the H line, taking it to the [[Retiro, Buenos Aires|Retiro]] neighborhood, providing {{ill|Villa 31|es}} with its own station, and building the disputed station at the site designated by Dr. Berjman, i.e. together with the Faculty of Law.

Subsequently, the Government of the City of Buenos Aires and SBASE sued Sonia Berjman, the NGO Basta de Demoler, and its president for the sum of 24 million pesos, for the damages and losses allegedly caused when filing an action for collective protection. It was alleged that the action was initiated "for the sole purpose of obliterating a public work destined to the provision of a public service" and that "there are political motives to hinder the management of government and the works within the Plaza Alvear."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.clarin.com/opinion/patrimonio_urbano-gobierno_de_la_ciudad-basta_de_demoler_0_S1euD5vXe.html |title=En defensa del patrimonio urbano |trans-title=In Defense of Urban Heritage |first=Daniel |last=Sabsay |work=[[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]] |language=Spanish |date=13 December 2014 |access-date=7 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.lanacion.com.ar/1749537-demanda-por-defender-un-espacio-publico |title=Demanda por defender un espacio público |trans-title=Demand for Defending a Public Space |work=[[La Nación]] |language=Spanish |date=5 December 2014 |access-date=7 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, on the occasion of a fundraiser at the [[Universidad del Salvador]], a group of notable citizens in the field of landscaping such as Adrián Camps, Roxana Di Bello, Marcelo Magadán, and Carlos Thays (great-great-great-grandson of the famous landscaper) took the opportunity to show their support.&lt;ref name=Homenaje&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/suplementos/m2/10-3184-2016-09-10.html |title=Homenaje a Sonia Berjman |trans-title=Homage to Sonia Berjman |work=[[Página/12]] |language=Spanish |date=10 September 2016 |access-date=7 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theraderm''' is a manufacturer of clinical-grade [[skin care]] products, including [[anti-aging cream]]s and [[moisturizers]], as well as an acne system under an alternate brand: [http://www.therapon.com/Skin-Health-Products/acne-skincare-products/Reversion-Clear-Skin-System Reversion]. The company was founded in 1996 by James Beckman, M.D., and is headquartered in [[Springdale, Arkansas]].

==History==
In 1977, Dr. James Beckman set up a private practice for plastic and reconstructive surgery in [[Mountain Home, Arkansas]]. After treating a number of burn patients, Dr. Beckman developed a cream, Beckman's Skin Care Cream, for restoring mobility and function to patients with skin-grafted hands. After further development and discovering new ingredients, he created a second product, resulting in a two-step system that moisturized skin and also reduced the appearance of lines and wrinkles. In 1996, the company was founded (initially as Therapon Skin Health), and even more research and development led to the four-step Skin Renewal System, which is still sold by the company today, along with a number of other products that each target a unique skin concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Theraderm's History|url=http://www.therapon.com/Theraderm_History|accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This '''timeline of magic''' is a history of [[Magic (illusion)|the performing art]] from B.C. to the present.

==Timeline of magic==
'''2700 B.C.''' - The reputed first known performance of a conjuring effect ([[ball]]s) by the magician [[Dedi]] in ancient [[Egypt]]. [[Dedi]] had done other effects, such as decapitating a bird, then reattaching the head to resurrect it. (This is disputed as there is nothing in reference to [[Dedi]], specifically in the Westcar Papyrus, to indicate that he performed the cups and balls for anyone. The famous drawing of two men seemingly performing the cups and balls, from the tomb of [[Baqet III]] at [[Beni Hasan]] is believed by most experts to show a game using pots&lt;ref&gt;Decker, Wolfgang, ''Sports and Games of Ancient Egypt,'' translated by Allen Guttman. The American University in Cairo Press, 1993, pp. 123,124&lt;/ref&gt; or cups&lt;ref&gt;Kanawati, Naguib, and Woods, Alexandra, ''Beni Hassan - Art and Daily Life in an Egyptian Province.'' Supreme Council of Antiquities Press, Cairo 2010, p43&lt;/ref&gt; but details of the game are unknown.) (Note: Since there is no indication that Dedi performed the Cups and Balls, and the Beni Hasan tomb painting is considered unlikely to represent the effect, there is no certain evidence for the existence of the cups and balls during this period.)

'''1300 -650 B.C.''' - References to magic are abundant in the ancient Greek myths among the classical founding pagan cultures of Europe, connected to the neighbouring Egyptian and Persian ones. Often centered around women of divine origin,  nymphs and priests, from Ariadne to Calypso, Circe to Medea, Hermes to Hecate, magic, divination and necromancy are widespread and intertwined with cthonic Gods and monsters, oracles and heroes.

'''50–300 A.D.''' - The Acetabularii performed the [[Cups and balls]] in ancient [[Rome]] using stones and small vinegar cups (hence the name Acetabularii). The Acetabularii are a group of magicians specializing on the cups and balls effect.

'''400–1000''' - The [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]; little is known about the history of magic, but much of it was associated with the [[occult]] and magic as entertainment is not prominent.

'''1000–1500''' - The [[Middle Ages]] where much magic was associated with the occult and [[witchcraft]]. The growing trading nature of society allowed some street or circus performers to make a living out of old classics such as the cups and balls and in fact more modern ideas such as cheating by short changing via sleights with coins and other small objects.

'''1584''' - [[Reginald Scot]] publishes ''The [[The Discoverie of Witchcraft|Discoverie of Witchcraft]]'' a book designed in part to counter the activities of persecutionists, but at the same time revealing many [[conjuring]] secrets of the day. Magic and [[witchcraft]] were linked, and many copies of Scot's book were burnt in the early 17th century.

'''1634''' - ''Hocus Pocus Junior: The Anatomie of Legerdemain'' was published. This book is one of the first to include the "Cups and Balls" effect described as it was originally performed, along with the "patter" which was used during the performance. This book had twelve editions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/34375/34375-h/34375-h.htm "Hocus Pocus Junior: The Anatomie of Legerdemain"]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Steve Burton published a hardcover edition, of the 1634 first edition (1997)
'''1720'''- Isaac Fawkes, English Magician retires. His performances at fairs left him with a fortune of nearly ten thousand pounds. Among his tricks were a card on the ceiling with any card called for and his bag of many eggs. His booth is featured in [[Bartholomew Fair]] by Hogarth with a sign that says "Dexterity of Hand." He also presented impressionists and contortionists as part of his shows.

'''1750''' - [[Joseph Pinetti]], "considered to be the major figure of 18th century magic," is born. "Pinetti is said to be the first recorded performer to do the "thumb tie effect" and he also performed second sight, exhibited automata and the orange tree illusion.&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Magic and Magicians'', T.A. Waters, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2250">A '''vanishing mediator''' is a concept that exists to mediate between two opposing ideas, as a transition occurs between them. This mediating concept exists just long enough to facillitate such an interaction: at the point where one idea has been replaced by the other, the concept is no longer required and thus vanishes.&lt;ref name="Žižek"&gt;[http://www.lacan.com/zizekchro1.htm  Slavoj Zizek - Key Ideas]&lt;/ref&gt;  In terms of [[Dialectics#Hegelian dialectic|Hegelian dialectics]] the conflict between the theoretical abstraction and its empirical negation (through trial and error) is resolved by a concretion of the two ideas, representing a theoretical abstraction taking into account the previous contradiction, whereupon the mediator vanishes.

In terms of [[psychoanalytic theory]], when someone is caught in a dilemma they experience [[hysteria]]. A conceptual deadlock exists until the resulting hysteric breakdown precipitates some kind of resolution, therefore the Hysteria is a vanishing mediator in this case.&lt;ref name="Hys"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070620203152/http://oak.cats.ohiou.edu/~hartleyg/epoetry/avant/hysteria.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of [[political history]], it refers to social movements, which operate in a particular way to influence politics, until they either are forgotten or change their purpose.&lt;ref name="Us"&gt;[http://www.long-sunday.net/long_sunday/2006/01/zizek_and_us.html Zizek and us.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fredric Jameson introduced the term in a 1973 essay ("The Vanishing Mediator: Narrative Structure in Max Weber," in New German Critique 1 [Winter, 1973]: 52-89). [[Alain Badiou]] uses a similar, but more explicitly post-structuralist term (″terme évanouissant″ or ″vanishing term″) in ''Théorie du sujet''.

Since, this concept has been adopted by [[Žižek]] in "For They Know Not What They Do: Enjoyment as a Political factor", where he uses it in a political sense, similar to [[Marx]]'s Analysis of Revolution.&lt;ref name="Žižek"/&gt;

'''William Cooper Nell''' (December 16, 1816 – May 25, 1874) was an African-American [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]], journalist, publisher, author, and civil servant of [[Boston, Massachusetts]], who worked for [[Racial integration|integration]] of schools and public facilities in the state. Writing for abolitionist newspapers ''[[The Liberator (newspaper)|The Liberator]]'' and ''[[North Star (anti-slavery newspaper)|The North Star]]'', he helped publicize the anti-slavery cause. He published the ''North Star'' from 1847 to 18xx, moving temporarily to Rochester, New York.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;

He also helped found the [[New England Freedom Association]] in the early 1840s, and later the [[Boston Vigilance Committee|Committee of Vigilance]], to aid refugee slaves. The Committee of Vigilance supported resistance to the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]], which had increased penalties  against even citizens in [[Slave and free states|free states]] who aided refugee slaves.

Nell's short histories, ''Services of Colored Americans in the Wars of 1776 and 1812'' (1851) and ''[[The Colored Patriots of the American Revolution]]'' (1855), were the first studies published about African Americans.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;&lt;ref name=Finkenbine/&gt; He is noted as the first African American to serve in the federal civil service, where he worked in the post office.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Nell was born in 1816 in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] to Louise Cooper, from [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]], and William Guion Nell, from [[Charleston, South Carolina]].&lt;ref name="Ruffin"/&gt; His father was an important figure in the abolitionist movement, having helped to create the Massachusetts General Colored Association in the 1820s. Nell encountered racial discrimination as a student. In 1829 he was passed over for an award given to excellent students upon graduation from the [[Abiel Smith School]], apparently because of his ethnicity, and excluded from a celebratory dinner. He managed to attend as a waiter. The award was financially supported by the estate of anti-slavery advocate [[Benjamin Franklin]]. The school committee instead gave Nell ''The Life of Ben Franklin'', an autobiography.&lt;ref name=smith&gt;{{cite journal | last=Smith | first=Robert P. | title=William Cooper Nell: Crusading Black Abolitionist | journal=The Journal of Negro History | volume=55 | issue=3 | pages=182–199 | doi= 10.2307/2716420|date=July 1970 | jstor= 2716420}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abolitionist work===
{{Slavery}}
Inspired by the founding of [[William Lloyd Garrison]]'s newspaper, ''[[The Liberator (anti-slavery newspaper)|The Liberator]]'', Nell decided to challenge race-based discrimination and segregation, as his father had done. Nell was particularly interested in encouraging the intellectual and social well-being of young African Americans.&lt;ref name=Finkenbine&gt;{{cite book| last=Finkenbine | first=Roy E. | chapter=Nell, William Cooper | title=American National Biography | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2005 | url=http://www.anb.org/articles/home.html | accessdate=September 12, 2008 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dpwarchives&gt;{{cite journal | editor-last1=Porter Wesley | editor-first1=Dorothy | editor-last2=Porter Uzelac |editor-first2=Constance | title=Wiliam Cooper Nell | publisher=Dorothy Porter Wesley Archives | year=1999 | url=http://www.dpw-archives.org/dpw.wcn.html | accessdate=September 12, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080412062300/http://www.dpw-archives.org/dpw.wcn.html |archivedate = April 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was dedicated to integration and opposed the separate abolitionist organizations for blacks and whites. In his devotion to integration, he dismantled the abolitionist Massachusetts General Colored Association, which had been organized by his father.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;

Nell studied law in the early 1830s. He was never admitted to the bar because he would not swear allegiance to the Constitution of the United States, as he believed it was a pro-slavery document. He was influenced by the opinions of Garrison and [[Wendell Phillips]].&lt;ref name=dpwarchives/&gt; Around this time, Nell also began his association with Garrison and ''The Liberator''. This connection would continue until the paper closed in 1865. Nell fought for the ideals of Garrison throughout the abolitionist campaign.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;&lt;ref name=Finkenbine/&gt;

Nell began working against the existing system of segregated schools for black and white children in Massachusetts, gathering 2,000 signatures from the black community on a petition to the state legislature.&lt;ref name="Ruffin"&gt;[http://www.blackpast.org/?q=aah/nell-william-c-1816-1874 Herbert G. Ruffin II, "William C. Nell, 1816-1874"], Black Past, 2007-2011, accessed February 26, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In 1855 Nell and his colleagues gained a victory; segregation was ended in Boston schools. Nell also encouraged young African Americans to learn outside of the public school system. Garrison said of him, "Perhaps no one has done so much—certainly no one has done more—for the intellectual and moral improvement of our colored youth."&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;

In 1843, Nell continued his crusade against segregation within the abolitionist movement by denouncing the Buffalo National Negro Convention. He claimed they served as, and promoted, exactly the type of separate abolitionism he was fighting against.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;&lt;ref name=Finkenbine/&gt;

On the other hand, he was influential in beginning the New England Freedom Association, an all-black organization that helped fugitive slaves in the North. In this case, Nell supported an African-American group since he believed its cause was closer to the hearts of blacks than whites. Nell publicized the Freedom Association's direct aid to fugitive slaves as well as the abolitionist cause.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; He also fought for higher education and encouraged the improvement of young African Americans; with John T. Hilton, he founded the Adelphia Union and the Young Men's Literary Society of Boston.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;

He was a leader in campaigns to desegregate public facilities in Boston: he succeeded in gaining desegregation of the Boston railroad in 1843, and, in 1853, performance halls in the city.&lt;ref name="Ruffin"/&gt;

===Later efforts===
Nell served as publisher to [[Frederick Douglass]]' ''[[North Star (newspaper)|The North Star]]'', from late 1847 until 1851, moving temporarily to [[Rochester, New York]], during this period. He also joined New York anti-slavery societies and founded a literary society. He ended his work with Douglass during the latter's feud with his close friend Garrison. Nell ended all contact with Douglass finally in 1853 when the leader advocated the Colored National Council and the Manual Labor School, which represented the types of segregated institutions which Nell detested. Douglass attacked Nell and other leading black activists who supported Garrison, including [[Robert Purvis]] of Philadelphia and [[Charles Lenox Remond]].&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;

In 1850, Nell had run as a [[Free Soil Party|Free Soil]] candidate for the Massachusetts state legislature, but lost. Passage of the federal [[Fugitive Slave Law of 1850]] required state law enforcement, even in free states, to aid in the recapture of refugee slaves and it increased penalties for those citizens who helped slaves. Nell was inspired to renew his fight against slavery. He created the Committee of Vigilance in Boston, whose members swore to aid escaped slaves. It served a similar purpose to the Freedom Association of 1842, but was illegal under the new federal law. Nell also supported the [[Underground Railroad]], which had numerous supporters to help slaves reach freedom in the North, with some going on to Canada.&lt;ref name=Finkenbine/&gt;

In 1851, Nell and other petitioners requested money from the state legislature to commission a monument to [[Crispus Attucks]], one of the first martyrs of the [[American Revolution]]. When Boston commissioned a major monument to the Boston Massacre to be installed on the Common in 1888, the fallen Attucks was featured in it prominently.

A few years later, in 1855 Nell achieved another success when the legislature finally abolished segregation in public schools. In recognition of Nell's efforts on this issue, a commemorative dinner was held to honor him. During 1855, Garrison's ''The Liberator'' employed Nell to journey around the Midwest and study African-American anti-slavery efforts. He attended a graduation at [[Oberlin College]], appreciating the easy relations among the integrated students.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;

Nell was outraged by the [[US Supreme Court]] ruling in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' ruling in 1857, which said that ethnic Africans had no legal standing in the United States as they were not considered citizens under the Constitution. In 1858 He organized a memorial celebration of [[Crispus Attucks]] at [[Faneuil Hall]], a traditional site of commemoration, and worked with others to have a "Crispus Attucks Day" designated in Boston.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; He reminded people of the participation of African Americans in the fight for independence from Great Britain, and helped have Attucks recognized in the commemoration of the [[Boston Massacre]].&lt;ref name="Ruffin"/&gt; That same year, Nell organized the Convention of Colored Citizens of New England. While it was contrary to his earlier dislike of segregated abolitionist efforts, he argued that the ''Scott'' decision was such an insult to blacks that they needed to act separately.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;

In his time apart from the newspapers, Nell worked for legislation to allow blacks into the Massachusetts militia. He did not succeed in this but lived to see blacks serve in United States armed forces during the Civil War.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;

===Civil War and later years===
With the outbreak of the Civil War, Nell worked to have blacks accepted as soldiers in the [[Union Army]]. In 1861, he was hired as a postal clerk in Boston, earning the distinction of being the first African American to hold a federal civilian post.&lt;ref&gt;"African American Firsts."

Retrieved March 04, 2016 from [https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-2690000010.html HighBeam Research]&lt;/ref&gt; On April 14, 1869,&lt;ref name="New Hampshire Marriage Records"&gt;New Hampshire Marriage records 1637-1947, on file New England Genealogical and Historical Society, Boston, Mass.&lt;/ref&gt; Nell married Frances Ann Ames, the twenty-six-year-old daughter of Philip Osgood Ames, a [[barber]] from [[Nashua, New Hampshire]] and his wife Lucy B. (Drake) Ames. The Nells had two sons, William Cooper, Jr. (1870–92) and Frank Ames (1872–81).&lt;ref name="New Hampshire Deaths and Burials"&gt;''New Hampshire Deaths and Burials 1784-1949,'' New England Genealogical and Historical Society, Boston, Mass.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nell died of a stroke in 1874 at the age of 58.&lt;ref name=Finkenbine/&gt; His wife survived him by more than twenty years, dying in [[Nashua, New Hampshire]], on September 13, 1895.&lt;ref name="New Hampshire Deaths and Burials" /&gt;

==Legacy and honors==
The [[William Cooper Nell House]], now a private residence in Beacon Hill, was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in recognition for his contributions to the abolition movement. He lived at that home in the 1860s.

The title of the "'''world's largest palace'''" is difficult to award, and controversial, as different countries use different standards to claim that their palace is the largest in the world.

==Palaces considered the largest==

The title of "world's largest palace by area enclosed within the palace's fortified walls" is held by China's [[Forbidden City]] complex in [[Beijing]], which covers an area of 728,000 square meters (180 acres). The 980 buildings of the Forbidden City have a combined floor space of {{convert|1614600|sqft|m2|0}} and contain 9,999 rooms (It was because that antient Chinese thought the yuhuang god has 10000 rooms, they made 9999 and half rooms slightly lesser to show the respect).

The world's largest palace by both floor space and volume is the [[Palace of the Parliament]] in [[Bucharest]], [[Romania]], which was built by communist dictator [[Nicolae Ceaușescu|Nicolae Ceaușescu]] in 1986.&lt;ref name="woreca"&gt;[http://www.worldrecordacademy.com/biggest/largest_administrative_building_world_record_set_by_the_Palace_of_the_Romanian_Parliament_80185.htm Largest administrative building]. Retrieved 29 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; It has a floor space of 330,000 m2 and a volume of 2,550,000 m3. It is also the most expensive administrative building and heaviest building.&lt;ref name=woreca/&gt; The "world's largest royal palace by floor space" is the [[Royal Palace of Madrid]] in [[Spain]], with {{convert|135000|m2}} of floorspace and containing 3,418 rooms.&lt;ref name="rooms"&gt;{{cite web| title=Palacio Real| url=http://www.cyberspain.com/passion/palacio.htm |accessdate=30 November 2012 |publisher=Cyberspain.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="biggestpalace"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ask.yahoo.com/20040428.html |title=What is the biggest palace in Europe? |accessdate=29 July 2011 |publisher=Yahoo! Inc. |author=Yahoo! Inc. |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "world's largest royal palace by volume" is the [[Palace of Caserta|Royal Palace of Caserta]] in [[Caserta, Italy]], with more than 2&amp;nbsp;million cubic meters (70&amp;nbsp;million cubic feet).&lt;ref&gt;The surface in square meters might be bigger, some sources claim it to be 61000 square meters. See page 6, the box "I numeri della Reggia di Caserta" [http://issuu.com/caponeeditore/docs/reggiadicaserta]&lt;/ref&gt;

The title of "world's largest royal domain," as measured by the total area of the property, goes to [[Balmoral Castle]] in [[Scotland]]. The castle’s grounds cover 20,000 hectares (50,000 acres), or {{convert|200|km2|sqmi}}

The [[Potala Palace]] in [[Lhasa]], Tibet, with 1000 rooms on 13 levels, and over 130,000 square meters of floor space,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/707|title=Historic Ensemble of the Potala Palace}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the largest palaces in the world by floor area. It was the winter residence of the [[Dalai Lama]] until 1959. (Many sources, e.g.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tibetguru.com/lhasa/attractions/potala-palace/structure.htm|title=Structure of Potala Palace}}&lt;/ref&gt; give the area as 360,000 square meters.)

In the castle category, [[Prague Castle]] claims to be world's largest. However, despite the singular name, Prague Castle is not a single building. Like the Forbidden City, it comprises a number of palaces, temples, and halls (constructed over several centuries) that share a common defensive wall. Altogether, the complex covers 18 acres, leading to the self-appointed title of "Largest coherent castle complex in the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrad.cz/en/prazsky_hrad/navsteva_hradu.shtml|title=Visit to Prague Castle|work=hrad.cz|accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Faux palaces==

While many buildings carry the title of "palace," they either are no longer, or were never intended to be, used as a royal residence, a sovereign residence or a bishop residence.

Romania's [[Palace of the Parliament]] contains {{convert|3552120|sqft|m2|0}} of floorspace,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdep.ro/pls/dic/site.page?id=27|title=PALACE OF THE PARLIAMENT|work=cdep.ro|accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was never a royal residence, as Romania's last monarch abdicated in 1947, but it was the palace intended to be used by the sovereign Nicolae Ceausescu, Romania's supreme ruler and dictator.

England's [[Palace of Westminster]] was built in the Middle Ages as a royal residence. It served as the principal residence of the monarch until 1522, when [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] moved his court to the newly acquired [[Palace of Whitehall]].&lt;ref name="parliament"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/building/palace/estatehistory/the-middle-ages/later-locations-parliament/ |publisher=parliament.uk |title=Location of Parliaments in the later middle ages - UK Parliament |accessdate=3 March 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6YRjDUI1V?url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/building/palace/estatehistory/the-middle-ages/later-locations-parliament/ |archivedate=11 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, the palace at Westminster has been used by the [[House of Lords]], the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and various courts. The majority of the medieval palace was destroyed by fire in 1834, with construction of the current building starting in 1840. The palace which now stands on the site was designed specifically for parliamentary use, however it is the property of the monarch in right of  [[the Crown]] and retains its status as a royal residence. Very little of the medieval palace survived, but the most significant is [[Westminster Hall]], built in 1097 during the reign of [[William II of England|William II]].

==Converted palaces==

Several palaces are former royal residences that reached their current grand sizes after they ceased being used as royal residences, and were converted to some other purpose.

The best example of such subsequent expansion is the [[Louvre Palace]]. As a royal residence, the [[Louvre Palace]] was much smaller than the modern day [[Louvre Museum]]. The Louvre Palace was abandoned as a royal residence in 1682, when [[Louis XIV]] moved his court to the [[Palace of Versailles]]. The Louvre Palace was relegated to the role of displaying royal collections and hosting administrative services, and over the centuries it went through several renovations, expansions and additions, including a significant one as an Imperial Palace during the second French Empire in the 19th century. It only reached its current size of {{convert|2260421|sqft|m2|0}} in 1988, as the modern Louvre Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paris-city-line.com/en/paris-galleries/louvre.htm|title=Musee de Louvre|work=paris-city-line.com|accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russia's Winter Palace and its annexes were not expanded after the Revolution, but the [[State Hermitage Museum]] also occupies other buildings which add to the size of the museum, but not to the palace. The Winter Palace contained {{convert|645,835|sqft|m2|0}} of floorspace as a royal residence. However, the modern [[Hermitage Museum]] complex, centered on the Winter Palace, contains {{convert|1978622|sqft|m2|0}} of floorspace.&lt;ref name="spb-rf.ru"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spb-rf.ru/zimniy_dvorets_ermitazh.htm|title=Çèìíèé äâîðåö|work=spb-rf.ru|accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the Small and the Old Hermitage buildings that were annexes to the main palace, which were used by the Imperial Court and are part of the palace complex. The same is true of the New Hermitage, that was used as a museum for the Imperial collections ever since it was built. All three Hermitages and the Hermitage Theatre can therefore be considered both independent buildings and wings of the Winter Palace. Despite a size which overshadows most other great palaces in Europe, the Winter Palace does not contain as much floorspace, because most of the State apartments in the north and east wings are two floors high.

==Uninhabited palaces==

With {{convert|1453122|sqft|m2|0}} of floorspace,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Royal Palace of Madrid statistics verified by official website, See also [http://www.cyberspain.com/passion/palacio.htm Palacio Real (Cyberspain)]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Royal Palace of Madrid]] is often considered the largest functioning palace in Europe {{Ref|Madrid}}, as it is still used for state functions. Although Spanish monarchs once occupied it, the current King of Spain does not, instead living at the much smaller [[Palace of Zarzuela]].

Although notably smaller than several other palaces throughout the world, with only {{convert|658858|sqft|m2|0}} of floorspace, the [[Royal Palace of Stockholm]] also claims to be "the largest palace in the world still used for its original purpose." Yet, like the [[Royal Palace of Madrid]], it is not currently occupied, with Swedish monarchs instead occupying [[Drottningholm Palace]].

== Guinness World Record ==

While numerous claimants under the various measurements can be recognized, to be considered for the [[Guinness World Record]] the palace must have once been intended for use as a royal residence. This is controversial as the definition of a [[palace]] is the official residence of a sovereign, chief of state (as a monarch or a president), archbishop, bishop.&lt;ref name="palacedefinition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/palace|publisher=merriam-webster.com|title=Palace &amp;#124; Definition of Palace by Merriam-Webster |accessdate=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, only the combined area of all floors in the palace (a measurement commonly known as floorspace) is considered.

According to the Guinness World Records, the [[Forbidden City]] in Beijing, China is the "largest palace in the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-palace|title=Largest palace|newspaper=Guinness World Records|accessdate=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Istana Nurul Iman]], with {{convert|2152782|sqft|m2|0}} of floorspace,&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Bartholomew, James.

== Largest former palace complexes  ==
[[File:Laténium-maquette-villa-romaine.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Roman Villa [[Neuchâtel]], [[Switzerland]]]]
In ancient times palace buildings could be as large or even larger than existing palace buildings. One example is
the palace of [[Knossos]] on [[Greece|Greek]] island [[Crete]]. This palace, which started construction in 2000&amp;nbsp;BC, reached its biggest size in 1500&amp;nbsp;BC with a size of 20,000 square meters (215,278.208 square feet) and 1,300 rooms.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ancient Greece: Art, Architecture, and History|author1=Belozerskaya, M.|author2=Lapatin, K.D.S.|date=2004|publisher=J.

The [[Roman emperor]] Hadrian's Villa at [[Tivoli, Italy|Tivoli]], [[Italy]] was a complex of over 30 buildings build between 118 and the 130s AD, covering an area of at least 250 acres (1 mio square meters, or 10,763,910 square feet) of which much is still unexcavated. The villa was the greatest Roman example of an Alexandrian garden, recreating a sacred landscape.
