== Controversy ==
On the opening day of the conference the [[President of the United States]], [[Donald Trump]], caused controversy by asserting that Germany is beholden to Russia over its involvement in the [[Nord Stream]] gas pipeline project aimed at doubling energy imports from Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/07/13/democrats-assail-trumps-remarks-on-germanys-reliance-on-russia-despite-kerry-biden-issuing-similar-concerns.amp.html|title=Democrats assail Trump's remarks on Germany's reliance on Russia despite Kerry, Biden issuing similar concerns|last=Mikelionis|first=Lukas|date=2018-07-13|work=Fox News|access-date=2018-07-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chancellor of Germany|German Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]], who grew up in Soviet-controlled [[East Germany]], rebuffed Trump's comments and noted "I am very happy that today we are united in freedom, the Federal Republic of Germany. Because of that we can say that we can make our independent policies and make independent decisions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/11/nato-summit-donald-trump-says-germany-is-captive-of-russians|title=Angela Merkel hits back at Donald Trump at Nato summit|last=MacAskill|first=Ewen|date=2018-07-11|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The New York Times'' reported on August 9, 2018 that Trump's senior national security advisors, concerned that Trump might disrupt the summit as he did by refusing to sign the communiqué at the June [[44th G7 summit|G7 summit]], scrambled to secure a formal policy agreement during the weeks before the summit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/09/us/politics/nato-summit-trump.html|title=U.S. Officials Scrambled Behind the Scenes to Shield NATO Deal From Trump|publisher=|accessdate=12 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Security ==
For the first time a RF Drone Detection System was used (a white dome seen at the right rooftop of the summit picture).

[[File:Air Force One over Mt. Rushmore.jpg|thumb|The Mount Rushmore Air Force One image]]
The '''''Air Force One'' photo op incident''' occurred on the morning of April 27, 2009, when a [[Boeing VC-25]] (a [[Boeing 747]] military variant used as ''[[Air Force One]]'' when the president is aboard), followed by a [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]] jet fighter, flew low and circled the [[Upper New York Bay]], site of the [[Statue of Liberty National Monument]]. President [[Barack Obama]] was not on board the aircraft during the incident.  Although the planes were engaged in a [[photo op]] and [[military exercise|training exercise]], the citizens of [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[New Jersey]] had not been informed in advance, and some thought it could be the makings of a [[terrorist attack]] similar to the [[September 11 attacks]]. Some people ran out of buildings and panicked in the streets. Some buildings ordered evacuations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1= Suzanne |last1= Sataline |first2= Jonathan D. |last2= Rockoff |first3= Christopher |last3= Conkey |lastauthoramp= yes |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124084127590859371 |title= A 'Classified' Photo Op Turns Into a Soaring Blunder for the White House |work= [[The Wall Street Journal]] |date= April 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incident==
The [[flypast|flyby]] was approved by [[Louis Caldera]], director of the [[White House Military Office]], to update the previous image of the aircraft flying over [[Mount Rushmore]]. [[Fran Townsend]], [[Homeland Security Council|Homeland Security Advisor]] to [[George W. Bush]], said the flyby was "crass insensitivity." She also said, "I'd call this felony stupidity. This is probably not the right job for Mr. Caldera to be in if he didn't understand the likely reaction of New Yorkers, of the mayor."&lt;ref name="cnn.com" /&gt; The [[Mayor of New York City]], [[Michael Bloomberg]], said that the flyby "defies the imagination." Senator [[Charles Schumer]] (D-New York) said the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] not telling the public about the flyby in advance "borders on being either cruel or very, very stupid." President [[Barack Obama]] did not know about the flyby until after it happened, and he stated, "It was a mistake. It was something we found out about along with all of you. And it will not happen again." Although the city's police department had been notified in advance, they had been instructed not to tell the public.&lt;ref name="cnn.com"&gt;{{cite news |first1= Mythili |last1= Rao |first2= Ed |last2= Henry |lastauthoramp= yes |url= http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/04/28/low.flying.plane/index.html |title= 'Furious' Obama Orders Review of NY Plane Flyover |date= April 28, 2009 |publisher= CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Michael |last=Muskal |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-obama-plane29-2009apr29,0,2498563.story |title=Obama Calls Plane's Manhattan Photo-Op 'a Mistake' |date=April 28, 2009 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=April 28, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430143711/http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-obama-plane29-2009apr29%2C0%2C2498563.story |archivedate=April 30, 2009 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caldera said of his actions, "Last week, I approved a mission over New York. I take responsibility for that decision... While federal authorities took the proper steps to notify state and local authorities in New York and New Jersey, it's clear that the mission created confusion and disruption. I apologize and take responsibility for any distress that flight caused."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Michael |last= Winter |url= http://blogs.usatoday.com/ondeadline/2009/04/white-house-sorry-for-ny-flyover.html |title= White House Sorry for NYC Flyover |department= On Deadline |work= [[USA Today]] |date= April 27, 2009 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090501065147/http://blogs.usatoday.com/ondeadline/2009/04/white-house-sorry-for-ny-flyover.html |archivedate=  May 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[CBS News]]'s New York City affiliate [[WCBS-TV]] obtained a memo from the [[Federal Aviation Administration]]'s James Johnston saying that the agency was aware of "the possibility of public concern regarding DOD ([[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]) aircraft flying at low altitudes" in and around the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.avweb.com/pdf/NewYorkCityFlyoverMemo.pdf |format= PDF |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120926115259/http://www.avweb.com/pdf/NewYorkCityFlyoverMemo.pdf |archivedate= September 26, 2012 |title= Flight Notification- New York City -Statue of Liberty Photo Op, Upper New York Bay / Newark Bay on April 27, 2009, 10:00L. (amended 4/23) |via=Avweb.com |first= James J. |last= Johnston |publisher= FAA Air Traffic}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the agency demanded total secrecy from the [[NYPD|city's police department]], the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]], the [[FBI]], and the mayor's office, and threatened federal sanctions if the secret was revealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Marcia |last= Kramer |url= http://wcbstv.com/topstories/air.force.one.2.996457.html |title= FAA Memo: Feds Knew Flyover Would Cause NYC Panic |location= New York |publisher= [[WCBS-TV]] |date= April 29, 2009 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100318054350/http://wcbstv.com/topstories/air.force.one.2.996457.html |archivedate= March 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Air Force officials estimated the cost for the photo shoot mission to be around $328,835, but stated that "the hours would have been flown regardless, and the expenses would have been accrued on a different mission".&lt;ref name="cnn.com"/&gt;

The day after the flyby, White House spokesperson [[Robert Gibbs]] said that the incident would be investigated by Deputy Chief of Staff [[Jim Messina (politician)|Jim Messina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2009/04/28/Review-of-New-York-City-flyover-ordered/UPI-94661240962630/ |title= Review of New York City Flyover Ordered |publisher= [[United Press International]] |date= April 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibbs also said that President Obama was "furious" about the flyby. However, Gibbs did not answer reporters' repeated questions about whether or not Caldera would lose his job. [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] press secretary [[Geoff S. Morrell|Geoff Morrell]] said that the idea for the flyby originated in the White House Military Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1= Michael D. |last1= Shear |first2= Ann Scott |last2= Tyson |lastauthoramp= yes |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/28/AR2009042800346.html?hpid=sec-nation |title= Official Who Approved Air Force One Flyover May Be Fired |work= The Washington Post |date= April 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.defenselink.mil/transcripts/transcript.aspx?transcriptid=4409 |title= DoD News Briefing with Geoff Morrell from the Pentagon |first= Geoff |last= Morrell |date= April 28, 2009 |type= Transcript |publisher= United States Department of Defense}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibbs also stated, "Because this was a training mission, the only people on that plane were Air Force personnel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Robert |last= Gibbs |url= http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Briefing-by-White-House-Press-Secretary-Robert-Gibbs-4-28-09 |title= Press Briefing By Press Secretary Robert Gibbs |publisher= The White House, Office of the Press Secretary |date= April 28, 2009 |access-date= May 4, 2009 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090504082245/http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Briefing-by-White-House-Press-Secretary-Robert-Gibbs-4-28-09/ |archive-date= May 4, 2009 |dead-url= yes |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA''' was an influential [[academic conference|conference]] organized by [[Paul Berg]]&lt;ref&gt;“First recombinant DNA.” The Human Genome Project. http://www.genome.gov/25520302 accessed 12 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; to discuss the potential [[biohazard]]s and regulation of [[biotechnology]], held in February 1975 at a conference center at [[Asilomar State Beach]].&lt;ref name="asilomar"&gt;[[Paul Berg]], [[David Baltimore]], [[Sydney Brenner]], [[Richard O. Roblin III]], and [[Maxine F. Singer]]. “Summary Statement of the Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA Molecules”. ''Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.'' Vol. 72, No. 6, pp. 1981-1984, (June 1975): 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; A group of about 140 professionals (primarily [[biologist]]s, but also including [[lawyer]]s and [[physician]]s) participated in the conference to draw up voluntary guidelines to ensure the safety of [[recombinant DNA]] technology. The conference also placed scientific research more into the public domain, and can be seen as applying a version of the [[precautionary principle]].

The effects of these guidelines are still being felt through the biotechnology industry and the participation of the general public in scientific discourse.&lt;ref name="recombinant"&gt;Paul Berg and Maxine F. Singer. “The recombinant DNA controversy: Twenty years later”. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. Vol 92, pp. 9011-9013, (Sept. 1995): 9011.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to potential safety hazards, scientists worldwide had halted experiments using recombinant DNA technology, which entailed combining DNAs from different organisms.&lt;ref name="asilomar" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="recombinant" /&gt; After the establishment of the guidelines during the conference, scientists continued with their research, which increased fundamental knowledge about biology and the public's interest in [[biomedical research]].&lt;ref&gt;Berg and Singer (1995), pp. 9011-12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background: recombinant DNA technology==
[[Recombinant DNA]] technology arose as a result of advances in biology that began in the 1950s and 60’s. During these decades, a tradition of merging the structural, biochemical and informational approaches to the central problems of classical genetics became more apparent. Two main underlying concepts of this tradition were that genes consisted of DNA and that DNA encoded information that determined the processes of replication and protein synthesis. These concepts were embodied in the model of DNA produced through the combined efforts of [[James D. Watson|James Watson]], [[Francis Crick]],and [[Rosalind Franklin]]. Further research on the Watson-Crick model yielded theoretical advances that were reflected in new capacities to manipulate DNA.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Wright. "Recombinant DNA Technology and Its Social Transformation, 1972-1982." ''[[Osiris (journal)|Osiris]]'', 2nd Series, Vol. 2 (1986): 305&lt;/ref&gt; One of these capacities was recombinant DNA technology.

===Experimental design===
This technology entails the joining of DNA from different species and the subsequent insertion of the hybrid DNA into a host cell. One of the first individuals to develop recombinant DNA technology was a biochemist at Stanford by the name of Paul Berg.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Berg and Maxine F. Singer. “The recombinant DNA controversy: Twenty years later”. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. Vol 92, pp. 9011-9013, (Sept. 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; In his experimental design in 1974, he cleaved (cut into fragments) the monkey virus SV40. He then cleaved the double helix of another virus; an antibacterial agent known as [[Lambda phage|bacteriophage lambda]]. In the third step, he fastened DNA from the SV40 to DNA from the bacteriophage lambda. The final step involved placing the mutant genetic material into a laboratory strain of the E. coli bacterium. This last step, however, was not completed in the original experiment.&lt;ref name="Carmen, Ira H. 1985 pp. 61-62"&gt;Carmen, Ira H. ''Cloning and the Constitution: An Inquiry into Governmental Policymaking and Genetic Experimentation''. (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1985) pp. 61-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Initial bio-safety concerns===
Berg did not complete his final step due to the pleas of several fellow investigators who feared the biohazards associated with the last step. The SV40 was known to cause cancer tumors to develop in mice. Additionally, the E. coli bacterium (although not the strain used by Berg) inhabited the human intestinal tract. For these reasons, the other investigators feared that the final step would create cloned SV40 DNA that might escape into the environment and infect laboratory workers. These workers could then become cancer victims.&lt;ref name="Carmen, Ira H. 1985 pp. 61-62"/&gt;

Concern about this potential biohazard, along with others, caused a group of leading researchers to send a letter to the president of the National Academy of Science (NAS). In this letter, they requested that he appoint an ad hoc committee to study the bio-safety ramifications of this new technology. This committee, called the Committee on Recombinant DNA molecules of the National Academy of Science, U.S.A., held in 1974, concluded that an international conference was necessary to resolve the issue and that until that time, scientists should halt experiments involving recombinant DNA technology.&lt;ref&gt;Carmen, Ira H. ''Cloning and the Constitution: An Inquiry into Governmental Policymaking and Genetic Experimentation''. (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asilomar Conference==

===Established principles===
The Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA took place at the [[Asilomar Conference Grounds|Asilomar Conference Center]] on California's Monterey Peninsula in 1975. The main goal of the conference was to address the biohazards presented by recombinant DNA technology. During the conference, the principles guiding the recommendations for how to conduct experiments using this technology safely were established. The first principle for dealing with potential risks was that containment should be made an essential consideration in the experimental design. A second principle was that the effectiveness of the containment should match the estimated risk as closely as possible.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Berg]], [[David Baltimore]], [[Sydney Brenner]], [[Richard O. Roblin III]], and [[Maxine F. Singer]]. “Summary Statement of the Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA Molecules”. ''Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.'' Vol. 72, No. 6, pp. 1981-1984, (June 1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

The conference also suggested the use of biological barriers to limit the spread of recombinant DNA. Such biological barriers included fastidious bacterial hosts that were unable to survive in natural environments. Other barriers were nontransmissible and equally fastidious vectors (plasmids, bacteriophages, or other viruses) that were able to grow in only specified hosts.&lt;ref name="Berg et al. 1975, p. 1982"&gt;Berg et al. (1975), p. 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to biological barriers, the conference advocated the use of additional safety factors. One such safety factor was physical containment, exemplified by the use of hoods or where applicable, limited access or negative pressure laboratories. Another factor was the strict adherence to good microbiological practices, which would limit the escape of organisms from the experimental situation. Additionally, the education and training of all personnel involved in the experiments would be essential to effective containment measures.&lt;ref name="Berg et al. 1975, p. 1982"/&gt;

===Recommendations given===
The Asilomar Conference also gave recommendations for matching the types of containment necessary for different types of experiments. These recommendations were based on the different levels of risk associated with the experiment, which would require different levels of containment. These levels were minimal, low, moderate and high risk. The minimal risk level of containment was intended for experiments in which the biohazards could be accurately assessed and were expected to be minimal. Low risk containment was appropriate for experiments that generated novel biotypes but where the available information indicated that the recombinant DNA could not either alter appreciably the ecological behavior of the recipient species, increase significantly its pathogenicity or prevent effective treatments of any resulting infections. The moderate risk level of containment was intended for experiments in which there was a probability of generating an agent with a significant potential for pathogenicity or ecological disruption. High-risk containment was intended for experiments in which the potential for ecological disruption or pathogenicity of the modified organism could be severe and thereby pose a serious biohazard to laboratory personnel or to the public. These levels of containments, along with the previously mentioned safety measures, formed the basis for the guidelines used by investigators in future experiments that involved the construction and propagation of recombinant DNA molecules using DNA from prokaryotes, bacteriophages and other plasmids, animal viruses and eukaryotes.&lt;ref name="Berg et al. 1975, p. 1982"/&gt;

===Recommendations applied to experiments===
For prokaryotes, bacteriophages and other plasmids, experiments could be performed in minimal risk containment facilities when the construction of recombinant DNA molecules and their propagation involved prokaryotic agents that were known to exchange genetic information naturally.&lt;ref&gt;Berg et al. (1975), pp. 1982-83&lt;/ref&gt; For experiments involving the creation and propagation of recombinant DNA molecules from DNAs of species that ordinarily did not exchange genetic information and generate novel biotypes, the experiments were to be performed in at least in a low risk containment facility. If the experiment increased the pathogenicity of the recipient species or result in new metabolic pathways in species, then moderate or high-risk containment facilities were to be used. In experiments where the range of resistance of established human pathogens to therapeutically useful antibiotics or disinfectants was extended, the experiments were to be undertaken only in moderate or high-risk containment facilities.&lt;ref name="Berg et al. 1975, p. 1983"&gt;Berg et al. (1975), p. 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

When working with animal viruses, experiments that involved the linkage of viral genomes or genome segments to prokaryotic vectors and their propagation in prokaryotic cells were to be conducted only with vector-host systems that had demonstrated restricted growth capabilities outside the laboratory and in moderate risk containment facilities. As safer vector-host systems became available, such experiments could be performed in low risk facilities. In experiments designed to introduce or propagate DNA from non-viral or other low risk agents in animal cells, only low risk animal DNA could be used as vectors and the manipulations were to be confined to moderate risk containment facilities.&lt;ref name="Berg et al. 1975, p. 1983"/&gt;

With eukaryotes, attempts to clone segments of DNA using recombinant DNA technology from warm-blooded vertebrates genomes were to be performed only with vector-host systems that had demonstrably restricted growth capabilities outside the laboratory and in a moderate risk containment facility. This was because they potentially contained cryptic viral genomes that were potentially pathogenic to humans. However, unless the organism made a dangerous product, recombinant DNAs from cold-blooded vertebrates and all other lower eukaryotes could be constructed and propagated with the safest vector-host system available in low risk containment facilities. Additionally, purified DNA from any source that performed known functions and was judged to be non-toxic could be cloned with available vectors in low risk containment facilities.&lt;ref name="Berg et al. 1975, p. 1983"/&gt;

===Prohibited experiments===
In addition to regulating the experiments that were conducted, the guidelines also forbade the performance of other experiments. One such experiment was the cloning of recombinant DNAs derived from highly pathogenic organisms. In addition, neither the cloning of DNA containing toxin genes, nor large scale experiments using recombinant DNAs that were able to make products that were potentially harmful to humans, animals or plants were allowed under the guidelines. These experiments were banned because the potential biohazards could not be contained by the then current safety precautions.&lt;ref name="Berg et al. 1975, p. 1983"/&gt;

===Science and the general public===
The participants of the Asilomar Conference also endeavored to bring science into the domain of the general public, with a possible motivation being the [[Watergate scandal]]. The scandal resulted from a bungled break-in at the Watergate hotel, which served as the Democratic National Committee headquarters in 1972. Two years after the burglary, taped evidence was discovered that indicated that President Nixon had discussed a cover-up a week after it. Three days following the release of the tape, Nixon resigned from his presidential office. This event focused the nation's attention on the problem of government secrecy fostering illegal and immoral behavior and it has been suggested by the political scientist, Ira H. Carmen, that this motivated the scientists at the Asilomar Conference to bring science into the public eye to ensure that they would not be accused of a cover-up.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Smoller. “Watergate Revisited.” ''PS: Political Science and Politics'', Vol. 25, No. 2 (June 1992): 225; and Carmen, ''Cloning and the Constitution'', p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, according to Dr. Berg and Dr. Singer, by being forthright, scientists avoided restrictive legislation due to the development of a consensus on how they were to conduct their research.&lt;ref name="Berg and Singer 1995, p. 9012"&gt;Berg and Singer (1995), p. 9012&lt;/ref&gt;

Bringing science into the public eye also coincided with the rapid rate at which recombinant DNA technology entered the industrial world. Because of the practical applications of the technology, funding for research using it started coming more from the private sector and less from the public sector. In addition, many molecular biologists who once confined themselves to academia, developed ties with private industry as equity owners, corporate executives and consultants.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, "Recombinant DNA Technology and Its Social Transformation", p. 303&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the creation of a biotechnology industry, although during this time, public debates occur over the hazards of recombinant DNA.&lt;ref name="Wright p. 360"&gt;Wright, "Recombinant DNA Technology and Its Social Transformation", p. 360&lt;/ref&gt; These debates were eventually won over by scientists who stated that the hazards were exaggerated and that the research could be conducted safely.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Wright. “Molecular Biology or Molecular Politics? The Production of Scientific Consensus on the Hazards of Recombinant DNA Technology.” ''Social Studies of Science'', Vol. 16, No. 4 (Nov. 1986). pp. 595-96.&lt;/ref&gt; Such was seen in the Ascot report, found in the Federal Register in March 1978. This report emphasized that the hazards of recombinant DNA to the general community were small to the point that they were of no practical consequence to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, “Molecular Biology or Molecular Politics?”, p. 612.&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, along with high economic pressures for industrial development and a more supportive political environment that existed after 1979, research and industry based on recombinant DNA continued to expand.&lt;ref name="Wright p. 360"/&gt;

==Significance of the conference==
Years after the conference, people ascribed a large amount of significance to it. According to Paul Berg and [[Maxine Singer]] in 1995, the conference marked the beginning of an exceptional era for both science and the public discussion of science policy. The guidelines devised by the conference enabled scientists to conduct experiments with recombinant DNA technology, which by 1995 dominated biological research. This research, in turn, increased knowledge about fundamental life processes, such as the cell cycle. Additionally, the conference along with public debates on recombinant DNA, increased public interest in biomedical research and molecular genetics. For this reason, by 1995, genetics and its vocabulary had become a part of the daily press and television news. This, in turn, stimulated knowledgeable public discussion about some of the social, political and environmental issues that emerged from genetic medicine and the use of genetically modified plants in agriculture. Another significant outcome of the conference was the precedent it set about how to respond to changes in scientific knowledge. According to the conference, the proper response to new scientific knowledge was to develop guidelines that governed how to regulate it.&lt;ref name="Berg and Singer 1995, p. 9012"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2005">'''Bach at the Sem''' is an annual sacred music concert series held on the campus of [[Concordia Seminary]] in suburban [[St. Louis]]. Bach at the Sem is an integral part of Concordia Seminary's educational and cultural programming to those who attend the seminary and to the St. Louis metropolitan community.
It is the purpose and function of Bach at the Sem to profess the
Christian faith through the proclamation of the Church's rich heritage of sacred and classical music, especially music of Lutheran composers. Bach at the Sem concentrates on music of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and is also dedicated to the performance of church music from the [[Renaissance]], [[Baroque]], [[classical music|Classical]], and [[Neoclassicism (music)|Neoclassical]] periods. Typically, five or six concert
performances have been offered each concert season coincident with the academic
year of the seminary. The venue is the Chapel of St. Titus and St. Timothy on the
campus of Concordia Seminary; the audience is the seminary family of faculty, staff
and students and metropolitan St. Louis.

The main performing ensemble for Bach at the Sem is the [[American Kantorei]]. The American Kantorei is an orchestral and choral ensemble  
founded in 1968 by its director, the Rev. Prof. [[Robert R. Bergt]]. Robert Bergt's untimely death in July 2011 resulted in the appointment of Dr. Jeral Becker, Director of Vocal and Choral Activities at St. Louis University, as Interim Muic Director of Bach at the Sem for the foreseeable future. Instrumentalists and Kantorei members include some of the finest trained musicians in the St. Louis area.

'''Baldwin Hotel''' was a 19th-century luxury hotel and theatre built by [[Comstock Lode]] millionaire, entrepreneur, and gambler [[Lucky Baldwin|Elias Jackson "Lucky" Baldwin]], formerly in downtown [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], [[California]]. It was located on [[Powell Street (San Francisco)|Powell Street]] at the corner of [[Market Street (San Francisco)|Market Street]], near the [[Union Square, San Francisco|Union Square]] area.

==History==
[[File:Baldwin's Hotel and Theatre San Francisco.jpg|thumb|left|275px|Baldwin Hotel and Theatre,&lt;br&gt;on Powell Street at Market.]]
The Baldwin Theatre was completed in 1875, and the Baldwin Hotel was completed around it in 1876. The hotel was designed in the [[Second Empire architecture|Second Empire style]] by architect Sumner Bugbee.

The theatre featured touring performers and it was first known as Baldwin's Academy of Music. Most of the touring performers of the day appeared there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Baldwin Theatre - Oxford Reference|url = http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095442714}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hotel and theatre occupied the entire block. The ground floor was divided into a number of large stores.

A theatre attendee, [[Mrs. Frank Leslie]], described the building in 1877:
::{{quote|"In the evening, by way of severe contrast [to the Mission Dolores they visited earlier that day], we went to Baldwin's Theatre, attached to the hotel of the same name and just finished. It is really the prettiest to be seen in any part of the world -- a perfect little gem, fitted up like a bonbonniere in crimson satin and gold. The six proscenium boxes on either side, and the row of French boxes at the back are marvelously pretty. Nothing could be more rich and exquisite in refinement of taste. The symmetry of the house is unmarred by rows of pillars, the galleries being suspended from the roof." &lt;ref&gt;[http://nbc-lumber.com/Leslie/Ch20.htm California: a pleasure trip from Gotham to the Golden Gate] Mrs. Frank Leslie April, May, June, 1877&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Destruction===
The entire building was destroyed by fire in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Theatres, California Sheet Music (Duggan)|url = http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~mkduggan/theatres.html|website = people.ischool.berkeley.edu|access-date = 2016-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Sydney Mail - Google News Archive Search|url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1302&amp;dat=18981203&amp;id=rVZVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=npUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2173,6932440|website = news.google.com|access-date = 2016-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SAN FRANCISCO HOTEL FIRE; "Lucky" Baldwin's House Laid in Ruins by Flames.

Seven cities submitted '''bids for 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics''' on September 13, 2007, aiming to host the ''Games of the XXXI Olympiad''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seven Applicant NOCs/Cities for the 2016 Games|url=http://www.olympic.org/en/content/Media/?articleId=55036|accessdate=March 2, 2010|date=September 14, 2007|publisher=International Olympic Committee}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of them were recognized by the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) on September 14, 2007, becoming Applicant cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=7 Applicant NOCs/Cities for the 2016 Olympic Games|url=http://www.olympic.org/en/content/Media/?articleId=55035|accessdate=March 2, 2010|date=September 14, 2007|publisher=International Olympic Committee}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although several cities submitted to be in consideration to host the 2016 Olympics, including [[New York City]] and [[Los Angeles]], on June 4, 2008, the IOC Executive Board shortlisted the four strongest bids to become Candidate cities. Those cities were [[Chicago bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics|Chicago]], [[Madrid bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics|Madrid]], [[Rio de Janeiro bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics|Rio de Janeiro]] and [[Tokyo bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics|Tokyo]]; the decisions were made during a meeting in [[Athens]], [[Greece]].&lt;ref name="IOC 2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Four cities to compete to host the 2016 Olympic Games|url=http://www.olympic.org/en/content/Media/?articleId=53256|accessdate=March 2, 2010|date=June 4, 2008|publisher=International Olympic Committee}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC 1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Four on 2016 Olympics short list|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/olympics/7435215.stm|accessdate =March 2, 2010|date=June 4, 2008|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining Applicant cities—[[Baku bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics|Baku]], [[Doha bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics|Doha]] and [[Prague bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics|Prague]]—were eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2016 Olympic Bid Short List Preview |url=http://www.gamesbids.com/eng/olympic_bids/2016_bid_news/1212537937.html |accessdate=March 2, 2010 |date=June 3, 2008 |publisher=GamesBids |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229165907/http://www.gamesbids.com/eng/olympic_bids/2016_bid_news/1212537937.html |archivedate=December 29, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Out of the six cities that failed to be awarded the 2016 Olympics, four of them bid for the [[2020 Summer Olympics]]. Baku, Doha, Madrid and Tokyo were official Applicant Cities, with Madrid and Tokyo advancing to become Candidate Cities and with Tokyo eventually being selected.

==Bidding process==
The Olympic bidding process begins with the submission of a city's application to the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) by its [[National Olympic Committee]] (NOC) and ends with the election of the host city by the members of the IOC during an ordinary session. The process is governed by the [[Olympic Charter]], as stated in Chapter 5, Rule 34.&lt;ref name="Charter"&gt;{{cite book | url = http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_122.pdf | title = Olympic Charter | publisher = International Olympic Committee |accessdate = 2008-06-04 | date = 2004-09-01 | format = PDF | isbn = 92-9149-001-6 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080609022618/http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_122.pdf| archivedate= 9 June 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1999, the process has consisted of two phases. During the first phase, which begins immediately after the bid submission deadline, the "applicant cities" are required to answer a questionnaire covering themes of importance to a successful Games organization. This information allows the IOC to analyze the cities' hosting capacities and the strengths and weaknesses of their plans. Following a detailed study of the submitted questionnaires and ensuing reports, the IOC Executive Board selects the cities that are qualified to proceed to the next phase. The second phase is the true candidature stage: the accepted applicant cities (from now on referred to as "candidate cities") are required to submit a second questionnaire in the form of an extended, more detailed, candidature file.&lt;ref name="CityElectionProc"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.olympic.org/uk/organisation/missions/cities_uk.asp | title = Host City Election Procedure | publisher = International Olympic Committee | accessdate = 2008-06-04 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080619122311/http://www.olympic.org/uk/organisation/missions/cities_uk.asp| archivedate= 19 June 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; These files are carefully studied by the IOC Evaluation Commission, a group composed of IOC members, representatives of [[List of international sport federations|international sport federations]], NOCs, athletes, the [[International Paralympic Committee]], and international experts in various fields.&lt;ref name="EvalCommis"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.olympic.org/uk/news/events/117_session/commission_uk.asp | title = Role and composition of the Evaluation Commission | work = 117th IOC Session | publisher = International Olympic Committee | accessdate = 2008-06-04 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080613200643/http://www.olympic.org/uk/news/events/117_session/commission_uk.asp| archivedate= 13 June 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The members of the Evaluation Commission then make four-day inspection visits to each of the candidate cities, where they check the proposed venues and are briefed about details of the themes covered in the candidature file. The Evaluation Commission communicates the results of its inspections in a report sent to the IOC members up to one month before the electing IOC Session.&lt;ref name="CityElectionProc"/&gt;

The IOC Session in which a host city is elected takes place in a country that did not submit an application to stage the Olympics.&lt;ref name="CityElectionProc"/&gt; The election is made by the assembled active IOC members (excluding honorary and honor members), each possessing one vote. Members from countries that have a city taking part in the election cannot vote while the city is in the running. The voting is conducted in a succession of rounds until one bid achieves an [[absolute majority]] of votes; if this does not happen in the first round, the bid with the fewest votes is eliminated and another voting round begins. In the case of a tie for the lowest number of votes, a special runoff vote is carried out, with the winner proceeding to the next round. After each round, the eliminated bid is announced.&lt;ref name="ElectionProc"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.olympic.org/uk/utilities/faq_detail_uk.asp?rdo_cat=24_55_0 | title = FAQ - ELECTION OF AN OLYMPIC GAMES HOST CITY - Host city election | publisher = International Olympic Committee | accessdate = 2008-06-04 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080717043751/http://www.olympic.org/uk/utilities/faq_detail_uk.asp?rdo_cat=24_55_0| archivedate= 17 July 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SingElectionProc"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.olympic.org/uk/news/events/117_session/election_uk.asp | title = Election procedure | work = 117th IOC Session | publisher = International Olympic Committee | accessdate = 2008-06-04 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080601234735/http://www.olympic.org/uk/news/events/117_session/election_uk.asp| archivedate= 1 June 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the announcement of the host city, the successful bid delegation signs the "Host City Contract" with the IOC, which delegates the responsibilities of the Games organisation to the city and respective NOC.&lt;ref name="HostCityContract"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.olympic.org/uk/organisation/ocog/index_uk.asp | title = The Organizing Committees of the Olympic Games | work = The Movement | publisher = International Olympic Committee |accessdate = 2008-06-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The deadline to submit applications for the 2016 Summer Olympic Games was September 13, 2007. The seven cities that submitted bids before that date also met the January 14, 2008 deadline for submission of the first phase questionnaire.&lt;ref name="2016candidproc"&gt;{{cite book | url = http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_1318.pdf | title = 2016 Candidature Procedure and Questionnaire | publisher = International Olympic Committee | accessdate = 2008-06-04 | date = 2007-05-16 | format = PDF | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080627111241/http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_1318.pdf | archivedate = 27 June 2008 | deadurl = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through analysis of the questionnaires, the IOC gave a [[weighted average|weighted-average]] score to each city based on the scores obtained in each of the questionnaire's eleven themes: political and social support, general [[infrastructure]], sports venues, Olympic Village, environment, accommodation, transport, security, past experience, finance, and legacy. If a bid's score was higher than six (IOC's predefined benchmark score), the city was considered highly capable of hosting the Games; otherwise, its chances were very slim.&lt;ref name="Report1"&gt;{{cite book | url =  http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Reports/EN/en_report_1317.pdf | title = Report by the IOC candidature acceptance working group to the IOC Executive Board | publisher = International Olympic Committee | date = 2008-03-14 | accessdate = 2012-08-01 | format = PDF | pages = 97 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 4, 2008, the IOC announced the cities accepted as candidates:&lt;ref name="IOC 1"&gt;{{cite press release | title = Four cities to compete to host the 2016 Olympic Games | publisher = International Olympic Committee | date = 2008-06-04 | url = http://www.olympic.org/uk/news/media_centre/press_release_uk.asp?release=2593 | accessdate = 2008-06-04 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080607070849/http://www.olympic.org/uk/news/media_centre/press_release_uk.asp?release=2593| archivedate= 7 June 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four of the five highest-rated applicants progressed to the next phase as official candidate cities.&lt;ref name="2016candidproc"/&gt; As stipulated, the IOC granted them the right to use the [[Olympic rings]] on their candidature emblem, together with a label identifying each as a Candidate City. The International Olympic Committee went against precedent when it selected Rio de Janeiro over Doha—a city which scored higher yet was eliminated from the field. Doha's weaknesses of a small population, lack of facilities, and Games dates outside of the IOC's desired window may have been too large an obstacle for the IOC to accept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = IOC Bends Rules When Selecting 2016 Olympic Bid Shortlist | work = 2016 Summer Olympic Games | publisher = GamesBids.com | date = 2008-06-04 | url = http://www.gamesbids.com/cgi-bin/news/viewnews.cgi?category=1&amp;id=1212598324 | accessdate = 2008-06-04 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080607070718/http://www.gamesbids.com/cgi-bin/news/viewnews.cgi?category=1&amp;id=1212598324| archivedate= 7 June 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, the IOC selects all the top scoring bids which reach the established minimum benchmark.

Considering its strong showing in the [[2012 Summer Olympics bids|2012 bidding]], one year later, the city council unanimously voted for the submission of a new bid.

Former IOC president [[Juan Antonio Samaranch]] offered his help in this new attempt. Madrid benefited from its strong reputation from the 2012 bid as well as having 85% of venues in place and many experiences hosting Olympic qualifying events.&lt;ref name=Hersh/&gt; Later plans stressed two clusters of venues, one on the east side, the other along the [[Manzanares River]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamesbids.com/cgi-bin/news/viewnews.cgi?category=1&amp;id=1197744866 Madrid 2016 Extends Competition Venues Area]&lt;/ref&gt; The bid was also popular with the Madrileños, boasting 85% support and 60% believing they could win the bid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamesbids.com/cgi-bin/news/viewnews.cgi?category=1&amp;id=1197564068 Madrid 2016 Bid Gets Major Citizen Support]&lt;/ref&gt; One potential problem was that no continent has hosted successive Summer Games since 1952, when [[Helsinki]] followed London as host city. London is hosting the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], and Athens, Greece fielded the 2004 Summer Olympics. Furthermore, the [[2014 Winter Olympics]] are also slated for Europe in the Russian city of [[Sochi]], and the 2006 Winter Olympics were held in Turin, Italy. Bid head Coghen pointed out, however, that the IOC chooses "cities, not continents". It was Madrid's second failure, after losing out to London for the 2012 Olympics, and later in 2020, marking the city's third failure. The bid logo is a coloured hand print called "Corle" welcoming citizens to Madrid. An "m" is hidden in the palm standing for Madrid. It was selected via a public contest.

Chicago was chosen to host the [[1904 Summer Olympics]] but those Olympic Games ultimately took place in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], to coincide with the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition|1904 World's Fair]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=1&amp;OLGY=1904 St Louis 1904 Games of the III Olympiad]&lt;/ref&gt; The last summer Olympic games to be hosted by the American continent was the [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Games]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]]. Chicago has an extensive [[Mass transit in Chicago|public transit system]], a wide range of venues, and a strong [[Sports in Chicago|sports culture]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1184.html Creation of Chicago Sports]&lt;/ref&gt; The planned dramatic setting for Olympics on the shores of [[Lake Michigan]], as well as the entirely urban experience were positive factors.&lt;ref name=Hersh/&gt; Chicago is one of few cities in the United States to host professional men and women's [[ice hockey|hockey]], [[baseball]], [[basketball]], [[football (soccer)|soccer]], and [[American football]] teams. Another benefit was the city's central location in the United States, since the [[Central Time Zone (North America)|Central Time Zone]] was well-suited to the North American television coverage for television networks and cable broadcasting, which in turn benefits [[NBC]], the media company which pays the highest broadcasting rights to the IOC. Plans included a temporary Olympic Stadium in [[Washington Park (Chicago park)|Washington Park]] on the city's South Side,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://sportsbiznews.blogspot.com/2007/01/and-2016-summer-olympics-will-be-held.html |title=And the 2016 Summer Olympics will be held in (read the story to find out) |access-date=2007-11-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070430031750/http://sportsbiznews.blogspot.com/2007/01/and-2016-summer-olympics-will-be-held.html |archive-date=2007-04-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a swimming venue on the West Side, and a number of events at [[McCormick Place]] convention center and the lakeshore as well as the Olympic Village just south of the [[Chicago Loop|Loop]].

Five new venues and eleven temporary venues would have been built for the games. The bid costs (US$49.3 million) were borne by the [[private sector]]. The cost of the [[infrastructure]] would have been financed by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesbids.com/cgi-bin/news/viewnews.cgi?category=1&amp;id=1200428217|title=Chicago's 2016 Olympic Bid Details Are Released|accessdate=2008-01-19|date=2008-01-15|publisher=Menscerto Inc.| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080119035822/http://www.gamesbids.com/cgi-bin/news/viewnews.cgi?category=1&amp;id=1200428217| archivedate= 19 January 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bid was being promoted by Chicago-based media mogul [[Oprah Winfrey]], Olympic champion [[Michael Phelps]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamesbids.com/eng/olympic_bids/chicago_2016/1216133678.html Chicago 2016 News – Nike, Phelps, Oprah] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318070446/http://www.gamesbids.com/eng/olympic_bids/chicago_2016/1216133678.html |date=March 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamesbids.com/eng/olympic_bids/chicago_2016/1216133694.html Olympic Champion Michael Phelps Celebrates With Chicago 2016] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318164343/http://www.gamesbids.com/eng/olympic_bids/chicago_2016/1216133694.html |date=March 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; NBA superstar and former [[Chicago Bulls]] player [[Michael Jordan]], and by Chicago resident, [[U.S. President]] [[Barack Obama]] who attended the IOC vote in [[Copenhagen]].

[[Azerbaijan]]'s capital, Baku, announced its bid for the Olympics,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baku.ru/pubs/ai/_en.php US assemblywomen to visit Azerbaijan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211173814/http://www.baku.ru/pubs/ai/_en.php |date=2007-12-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with initial studies suggesting that the cost of hosting the 2016 Summer Olympic Games could be $20 billion. The capital of a [[petroleum]] rich nation with a booming economy, Baku had plenty of money to fund the games. Unfortunately, the city's infrastructure had deteriorated since the breakup of the Soviet Union. &lt;!-- The four facts in this paragraph were all supported by the Tribune article. --&gt; In addition, there are three frozen political conflicts in the South Caucasus region.&lt;ref name=Roundup&gt;[http://www.gamesbids.com/cgi-bin/news/viewnews.cgi?category=1&amp;id=1200769245 Olympic Bid Roundup]&lt;/ref&gt; A lesser factor considered by the IOC is the host nation's sport legacy. Azerbaijan has been an independent nation only a short time, so its Olympic history is also short, sending teams since only 1996 and claiming only three gold medals so far.&lt;ref name=Hersh/&gt; The Azerbaijani Organizing Committee established its bid committee in November 2007, installing first vice premier Yagub Eyubov as head. Sports Minister Azad Ragimov was aided by the Caspian American Group to prepare the bid book with the assistance of the government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamesbids.com/cgi-bin/news/viewnews.cgi?category=1&amp;id=1194540734 Organizing Committee Established For Baku 2016 Bid]&lt;/ref&gt; Baku's elimination was not unexpected, as one insider cited that practically no sports facilities meet global standards, the underdeveloped tourist sector, and regional conflicts. He cited 2020 or 2024 as times when Baku will have more serious arguments to win a bid.&lt;ref name=Roundup/&gt; Baku's logo depicts [[petroglyph]] images from the [[Gobustan State Reserve|Gobustan Rock Plateau]], which features the remains of settlements and burials reflecting ancient human culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamesbids.com/cgi-bin/news/viewnews.cgi?category=1&amp;id=1199290909 Baku 2016 Unveils Logo]&lt;/ref&gt;

Doha submitted its bid to host the 2016 Summer Olympics&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/front_page/6174007.stm Qatar will bid for 2016 Olympics]&lt;/ref&gt; after its hosting of the [[2006 Asian Games]], spending US$2.8 billion on infrastructure and venues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/12/12/sports/ME_SPT_Asian_Games_Paying_Dividends.php Qatar will gain much more than the money it spent on Asian Games]&lt;/ref&gt; The Doha 2016 bid won much regional support, for example from the [[Olympic Council of Asia]] (OCA) president&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamesbids.com/cgi-bin/news/viewnews.cgi?category=1&amp;id=1165422389 Qatar 2016 Bid Gets Support From OCA President]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]]. The Aspire Zone [[Doha Sports City|Sports City]] was to be the centerpiece of the bid, much as it served in the [[2006 Asian Games]]. Qatar is in a growth period due to its [[petroleum]] reserves, and like [[Baku]], is well situated to finance a large event. Doha is the only city in the [[Arab World]] other than [[Cairo]] to mount a serious bid, with pundits speculating the IOC may reward it by promoting it to the final shortlist. Although in a troubled area, Qatar is known as an open-minded country which is promoting acceptance and change and promoted a strong message of peace and acceptance for the region. In July and August, the average temperature in Doha can easily reach 45&amp;nbsp;°C (113&amp;nbsp;°F), thus they proposed mounting the Games in October. It is not without precedent (e.g. [[1968 Summer Olympics|Mexico City]] and [[2000 Summer Olympics|Sydney]]), but is technically outside the requirements. As Doha and Qatar in general (500,000 and 1,400,000 inhabitants, respectively) is among the smallest cities to bid to host the modern games, the Qataris would have to be innovative in bringing in spectators from neighboring countries to raise ticket sales. A side consideration is that like Azerbaijan, Qatar also has a short Olympic legacy,&lt;ref name=Hersh/&gt; and has been criticised for its practice of giving "passports of convenience" to foreign athletes to pad their record.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,901030908-480231,00.html A Run For the Money]&lt;/ref&gt; Only two new venues were to have been built, a velodrome and a baseball stadium, although a new Athletes' village was to be designed. [[Khalifa International Stadium]] currently seats 50,000, under the 60,000 to meet the IOC standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamesbids.com/cgi-bin/news/viewnews.cgi?category=1&amp;id=1193332597 Doha Launches 2016 Bid, Unveils Logo, Tagline, Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029052158/http://www.gamesbids.com/cgi-bin/news/viewnews.cgi?category=1&amp;id=1193332597 |date=2007-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Qatar has plans to build the world's most advanced Paralympics stadium and the world's first underground stadium for matches during the [[2011 AFC Asian Cup]] in Qatar. The Doha logo for the 2016 bid is the al dahma, the flower of the spring. The design uses motifs from traditional henna decorations and Doha is written in Arabic in the design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamesbids.com/cgi-bin/news/viewnews.cgi?category=1&amp;id=1193330958 Doha 2016 Reveals Olympic Bid Logo]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Aquapark, circular pools would be built to represent the Olympic rings.

==Predicting indices==
Two websites, [[GamesBids]].com and [[Around the Rings]], feature predicting indices which specialize in evaluations of Olympic Games bids. They periodically release analysis of the candidates and assigns them a score between 0 and 100, or 0 and 110 respectively. The score produces a number that can be used to rate a bid relative to past successful bids - and possibly gauge its potential future success. GamesBids.com's scale is called BidIndex,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamesbids.com/english/content/bidx2016.shtml BidIndex 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; AtR's is called the Power Index.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aroundtherings.com Around the Rings]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aroundtherings.com/Default.aspx?articleid=30515 Four 2016 Olympic Bids Make "Super League" in ATR Power Index]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the provisions of the [[Greek Constitution]], President [[Karolos Papoulias]] appointed [[Panagiotis Pikrammenos]], the outgoing chairman of the [[Council of State (Greece)|Council of State]], as caretaker [[Prime Minister of Greece|Prime Minister]] after none of the major parties was able to form a government.

The [[Greek legislative election, June 2012|subsequent elections]] were held on 17 June 2012, again resulting in a hung parliament, and this cabinet served until the formation of a [[coalition government]] on 21 June 2012.

The '''''Casco''-class monitor''' was a unique class of [[draft (hull)|light draft]] [[monitor (warship)|monitor]] built on behalf of the [[United States Navy]] for the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] [[theater (warfare)|theatre]] during the [[American Civil War]]. The largest and most ambitious [[ironclad]] program of the war, the project was dogged by delays caused by bureaucratic meddling. Twenty ships of the class were eventually built at great expense, but proved so unseaworthy when trialed that they were quickly sidelined, causing a public scandal.

==History==

After the success of the [[US Navy]]'s first monitor, {{USS|Monitor}}, in preventing the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] ironclad {{ship|CSS|Virginia}} from breaking the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] blockade at [[Hampton Roads]] in the spring of 1862, the navy became enthused with the monitor concept (at the expense of the larger [[broadside ironclad]] type), and ordered a number of new classes of monitor, one of which was the ''Casco'' class.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich, pp. 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Casco''s were a unique "light draft" class designed specifically for operating in the shallow bays, rivers, and inlets of the Confederacy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hazegray.org/danfs/monitors/umpqua.htm USS ''Umpqua''], DANFS Online.&lt;/ref&gt;

The specifications for the ''Casco'' class originally called for a vessel with a light [[draft (hull)|draft]], not exceeding six feet, and a low [[Freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]] to present the smallest possible target to Confederate guns. For the design of the new class, the Navy turned once again to [[John Ericsson]], designer of USS ''Monitor''. [[File:USS Nausett 1865.jpg|thumb|upright|Diagram of USS ''Nausett'', showing the large wooden "raft" surrounding the iron hull]]Ericsson came up with a design for a {{convert|225|ft|m|adj=on}}-long vessel with a single revolving turret containing two {{convert|11|in|mm|adj=on}} guns, an armored upper deck, and twin screw propellers giving a top speed of around eight knots. Around the hull of the vessel, a large wooden "raft" was to be constructed, which would help increase buoyancy. Ericsson kept the design deliberately simple in keeping with the inexperience of the private shipyards which would be called upon to build them.&lt;ref name="Roberts, p. 110"&gt;Roberts, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; He anticipated that each ship would take no more than forty days to complete.&lt;ref name="Heinrich44"&gt;Heinrich, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The monitor office===
At around the same time however, the Navy created a new "monitor office" to centralize oversight of the new monitor program. The new office, located across the hall from Ericsson's design bureau, was nominally headed by Rear Admiral [[Francis H. Gregory]], but was effectively run by [[Chief Engineer]] [[Alban C. Stimers]], to whom was entrusted the power of setting general plans and ship specifications. Stimers, an ambitious man, was keen to take credit for the design of the new monitors and frequently visited Ericsson's bureau to make changes to the specifications.&lt;ref name="Roberts, p. 110"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

The greatest single alteration to the design however, came not directly from Stimers but from Admiral Joseph Smith, chief of the [[Bureau of Yards and Docks]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], who suggested that the oval [[hull (ship)|hull]] of the ship be surrounded by large iron tanks which could be pumped full of water in order to lower the ship's freeboard still further when in combat to present an even smaller target, or drained for normal travel. Stimers liked the idea and ordered the changes, but when Ericsson saw the new plans he resigned from the project. The new plans greatly added to the design's complexity, requiring sophisticated pumping mechanisms, while the added weight would also reduce speed and buoyancy.&lt;ref name="Heinrich44"/&gt;

===More design changes===
In February 1863 the monitor office offered contracts for twenty of the new ''Casco''-class monitors, in spite of the fact that the original architect, Ericsson, had not approved the new design. Winning bidders included prominent firms like [[Reaney, Son &amp; Archbold]] in [[Chester, Pennsylvania]], Wilcox &amp; Whitney at Camden, [[Harlan &amp; Hollingsworth]] in [[Wilmington, Delaware]] and Merrick &amp; Sons of Philadelphia (the latter of whom subcontracted much of the work to [[William Cramp &amp; Sons]]). A number of smaller firms were also contracted. The cost was estimated at $395,000 per ship, or approximately $8 million in total. Some shipyards, such as Cramp, were forced to substantially upgrade their ironworking facilities for the production of the new vessels.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich, pp. 44–45.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Wassuc shot lifter drawing.jpg|thumb|upright|Detail drawing by Stimers for one of the ''Casco''-class monitors]]
By the end of 1863, frequent design changes were causing growing problems for the contractors. Stimers and his team of thirty draftsmen at the monitor office continued to submit changes even as the vessels were in the process of production, leading to long delays. One yard in [[Boston]] received a total of 83 drawings and 120 letters of explanation from Stimers, and the specification manual for the ships grew to 92 pages of small print.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; The final design called for a total of thirteen auxiliary engines and pumps per ship, fancy brasswork in place of cast iron, and a complex system of pipes for draining and filling the water tanks. The added weight to a ship designed with only a {{convert|15|in|mm|adj=on}} freeboard at the outset raised questions about the ships' eventual seaworthiness.&lt;ref name="Heinrich47"&gt;Heinrich, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scandal and inquiry===
By spring of 1864, the first of the ''Casco''-class vessels, {{USS|Chimo|1864|6}}, was ready for her initial trial. Putting to sea, waves washed across the deck, while the stern remained totally submerged by three or four inches (10&amp;nbsp;cm).&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; A second trial, of {{USS|Tunxis|1864|6}}, confirmed the disaster, with waves washing over the deck and the ship only able to make a speed of 3½ knots as opposed to the original specification of eight. Moreover, the trials were conducted "light", without the normal operational loads of coal, ammunition and stores. The ships were unseaworthy and virtually useless.&lt;ref name="Heinrich47"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/pers-us/uspers-s/a-stimrs.htm Alban C. Stimers], [[Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships|DANFS]]&lt;/ref&gt;

By this stage, the twenty vessels, in various stages of completion, had cost half a million dollars apiece. Amid public scandal, the Navy set up an inquiry. Stimers was found responsible and removed from his post, and the Navy appointed experienced administrators in his place. The vessels were redesigned and refitted in order to improve buoyancy, but few of them saw active service before the end of the war and those that did were decommissioned and laid up within months, while the majority were never commissioned at all. Within a few years, all the ships of the ''Casco'' class had been retired and scrapped or otherwise disposed of.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich, p. 48.

'''Cedar Fest''' was a celebration held in [[East Lansing, Michigan|East Lansing]], [[Michigan]]. The event, which started in the 1970s, was originally a semiannual party that occurred during the months of May and October.  The event was held in Cedar Village, a densely populated student neighborhood bordering the [[Michigan State University]] campus. The event took off in the 1980s and was regularly attended by thousands. Several riots ensued from the parties and property owners along with the city decided to put an end to the event. In 1987 the event was banned by an injunctive order issued by Judge Carolyn Stell.  For many years it was not held.&lt;ref name ="LSJ"&gt;[http://www.statenews.com/index.php/article/2008/04/cedar_fest_a_mess The State News: Cedar Fest a mess&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==2008 revival==
Cedar Fest saw a revival in 2008, 21 years after the city had officially banned the event. The revival, which began as a campaign on [[Facebook]] as early as January, promised a "weekend long party" that would take place "throughout all of Cedar Village."&lt;ref name="LSJ2"&gt;[http://www.lansingstatejournal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2008804080323 More Cedar Fest arrests likely | lansingstatejournal.com | Lansing State Journal&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It drew up to 4,000 party goers and was officially declared an unlawful assembly as police launched 24 smoke grenades, 20 flash bangs, 20 stingball grenades and 13 rounds of tear gas to disperse the out-of-control crowd.&lt;ref name = "LSJ"/&gt; Some revelers threw bottles, cans and bricks at police officers, while two city vehicles' windows were broken, and at least four fires were set.&lt;ref name = "LSJ2"/&gt; East Lansing police Chief Tom Wibert remarked that the event "got to the point where I don’t see how we could have dispersed that crowd without tear gas." In fact, Wibert said after the police used flash bangs and smoke bombs, some students began to chant for tear gas.&lt;ref name = "LSJ"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "LSJ2"/&gt; The "riot" cost close to $10,000 in damages and resulted in 52 arrests, 28 of them being MSU students. Police estimated that about 5% of MSU's student population was at the event.  Not a single citizen's complaint was made against the police regarding this riot, a complete turn around from the flood of complaints which occurred following the riot after the NCAA loss in 2005.

Observers noted that police were more restrained compared to their handling of the 2005 riot after MSU's Final Four loss. In that incident, police began using tear gas just 15 minutes after crowds formed, launching 299 canisters in total.&lt;ref name = "LSJ"/&gt; Eight members of the [[Lansing]] branch of the [[ACLU]] were on hand to monitor police actions during the 2008 Cedar Fest and afterwards complimented police on how the incident was handled.&lt;ref name = "LSJ"/&gt;

At a press conference following the event, Wibert said: 

{{quote|It’s something that’s completely new for us. We’ve never had an incident like this instigated from a web site. As far as I’m concerned, Cedar Fest is over and we’re not going to allow it to happen again. It’s not a tradition that East Lansing or Michigan State University wants to continue. As many trouble makers from last night as we can are going to be convicted and they’re not going to be here next year.&lt;ref name = "LSJ"/&gt;}}

==Sports celebrations==

With the memory of 2008's Cedar Fest fresh in the minds of Michigan State students, an unofficial Cedar Fest revival occurred Saturday, April 4, 2009 and Monday, April 6, 2009, following the Michigan State men's basketball team's successful run to the [[Final Four]]. Crowds of 2,000 and 1,700 (respectively) peacefully celebrated together in the streets outside of Cedar Village with continuous chants of "Go Green, Go White!" and renditions of the [[Michigan State University Fight Song]].Over 80 arrests were made during the Final Four weekend; however, most of these arrests were related to minors possessing alcohol.  A total of 11 acts of arson were reported (mostly burnt couches, an MSU tradition); however, no major incidents occurred as most revelers left Cedar Village peacefully after being asked to disperse by the police.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

In 2013, students gathered at the Cedar apartments to celebrate MSU's victory in the Big Ten football championship game. After four large fires were fed with various furniture and household items for several hours, police moved in to disperse the revelers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlive.com/lansing-news/index.ssf/2013/12/east_lansing_police_to_hold_mo.html#incart_river_default]&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 29, 2015, after MSU advanced to the Final Four by defeating Louisville in the Elite 8 of the NCAA Basketball Tournament, hundreds of students gathered outside Cedar Village to celebrate. Police were immediately on the scene. Students began throwing dozens of bagels in the air in jubilance and a sweater was burned. Several arrests were made.&lt;ref name="buzzfeed.com"&gt;https://www.buzzfeed.com/mbvd/police-arrest-michigan-state-fans-for-rioting-in-the-streets#.duXaKl8B7&lt;/ref&gt;

{{DISPLAYTITLE:Controversial issues surrounding ''Slumdog Millionaire''}}
{{Lead too short|date=March 2013}}

The film ''[[Slumdog Millionaire]]'', which won eight [[Academy Awards]] in 2009, has been subjected to a number of criticisms, notably regarding how it portrays Indian society and alleged exploitation of some of the actors.

==Loveleen Tandan==
On 11 December 2008, the day Golden Globe nominations were announced, Chicago film critic [[Jan Lisa Huttner]] launched an online campaign questioning why [[Loveleen Tandan]], the film's credited co-director, was not nominated along with Danny Boyle for Best Director. "Knowing that Loveleen Tandan was a critical part of Slumdog's filmmaking and marketing phases," she wrote, "how can we all sit by and watch while she's totally ignored in the awards phase?" Huttner also provided statistics showing "how rare it is for female directors to be in the awards race."

After learning of this campaign, Tandan sought to end it, stating, "I can't tell you how embarrassed I am by this [...] The suggestion is highly inappropriate, and I am writing to you to stress that I would not wish it to be considered."&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jurgensen|first1=John |title=The Co-Pilot of 'Slumdog' |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123146019434866263?mod=googlenews_wsj |accessdate=19 October 2015 |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=9 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Slumdog Millionaire'''s producer Christian Colson stated that Tandan's role as co-director was being misconstrued to place her on an equal creative footing with Boyle.&lt;ref name="wsj"/&gt; Colson noted that the title of "co-director (India)" given to Tandan was "strange but deserved" and was developed over "a Coca Cola and a cup of tea" in order to identify her as "one of our key cultural bridges."&lt;ref name="wsj"/&gt;

Colson's remarks triggered negative feedback from multiple organisations including WomenArts, the Women Film Critics Circle, and the Women's Media Center. Eventually, even though she was not present at any prior ceremonies (including Golden Globes, BAFTA, or DGA), Tandan was a member of the team which went up on stage to accept the Oscar for Best Picture of 2009.

On 15 May 2010, Jan Lisa Huttner received a "Silver Feather" award from the [[Illinois Woman's Press Association]] commending her for her work on the 2009 Oscar controversy.&lt;ref name=prweb-feathers&gt;{{cite press release |title=Feminist Film Critic Wins Top State Honor Plus National Recognition |url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2010/07/prweb4236404.htm |publisher=[[PRWeb]] |accessdate=19 October 2015 |date=9 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protests and lawsuits==
Following its release in India, the film faced criticism from various members of the public alleging that the film fuels [[Stereotypes of South Asians#Indians|Western stereotypes]] about [[poverty in India]] and that it peddles "[[poverty porn]]".&lt;ref name="Kids" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Singh"&gt;{{cite news|author=Madhur Singh|title=Slumdog Millionaire, an Oscar Favorite, Is No Hit in India|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=26 January 2009|url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1873926,00.html?imw=Y|accessdate=2009-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tapeshwar Vishwakarma, a representative of a slum-dwellers' welfare group, filed a defamation lawsuit against the film's music composer [[A.R.

''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine asked the film's director, Danny Boyle: "Some activists have claimed that the title is demeaning. What did you mean by 'slumdog'?" Boyle answered: "This is one of the saddest things for me.... Basically [the title] is a hybrid of the word "underdog"—and everything that means in terms of rooting for the underdog and validating his triumph—and the fact that he obviously comes from the slums. That's what we intended."&lt;ref&gt;Zakaria, Fareed. [http://www.newsweek.com/id/182341 "Slum Voyeurism?"], 30 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

For their work on the movie, according to London's ''[[The Daily Telegraph|Daily Telegraph]]'', [[Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail]] (youngest Salim) was paid £1,700 and [[Rubina Ali]] (youngest Latika) £500.&lt;ref name=missout/&gt; The children received considerably less than the Afghan child stars of ''[[The Kite Runner (film)|The Kite Runner]]'', who had been paid £9,000, even though ''The Kite Runner'' was far less of a box office hit.

On 26 January 2009, Danny Boyle (director) and Christian Colson (producer) released a written statement saying that they had "paid painstaking and considered attention to how Azhar and Rubina's involvement in the film could be of lasting benefit to them over and above the payment they received for their work." Boyle and Colson stated that they had "set up trust funds for Rubina and Azharuddin and paid for their education." The filmmakers noted that they had also hired transportation to get the children to a nonprofit English-language school for the next eight years,&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1883809,00.html "What Will Happen to ''Slumdog'''s Child Stars?"], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', 10 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and that both children would receive £20 a month for books and food.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/4347472/Poor-parents-of-Slumdog-millionaire-stars-say-children-were-exploited.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Slumdog child stars miss out on the movie millions | first1=Dean | last1=Nelson | first2=Barney | last2=Henderson | date=26 January 2009 | accessdate=2010-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exact amount of the trust funds was not disclosed by the filmmakers. As Boyle explained, "We don't want to reveal exact figures about what's in the trust fund, what's in the bank account for them for when they leave school because it will make them vulnerable and a target really, but it is substantial, and they will hopefully gain benefit from the film long after the film has disappeared and long after the media who are chasing them at the moment sadly have lost interest in the film, and that's been our approach throughout and I think it's the right approach."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jake Tapper|title=Slumdog Symphony: A Chat with Danny Boyle|publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2009/01/slumdog-symphon.html|accessdate=2009-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Economic Times'', £17,500 had been placed into a trust fund for Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail which he will receive, plus interest, when he turns 18.&lt;ref name="economictimes.indiatimes.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/ET-Cetera/Slumdog-Millionaire-stars-father-asks-for-more/articleshow/4207776.cms | work=The Times of India | title=News By Industry | date=1 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail's father, Mohammed Ismail, demanded more money for his son in light of the film's success. He stated, "My son has taken on the world and won. I am so proud of him but I want more money. They promised me a new house but it hasn't happened. I'm still in the slum. I want the money now, it is of no use later. Mr. Boyle should take care of my son."&lt;ref name="economictimes.indiatimes.com"/&gt; He also claimed, "There is none of the money left. It was all spent on medicines to help me fight TB."&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt; Defenders of the filmmakers noted that there was no assurance that any money given directly to Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail would not be used by his father for his own purposes, as had happened with previous Indian child actors from slums.&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt;

Both Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail and Rubina Ali attended the [[81st Academy Awards]] on 22 February 2009, along with all the other actors who had played Salim, Jamal, and Latika.

The '''Croatian National Theatre in Split''' ({{lang-hr|Hrvatsko narodno kazalište u Splitu}} or '''HNK Split''') is a theatre located in [[Split, Croatia]]. Originally opened in 1893, the theatre is owned and operated by the City of Split and is one of the oldest surviving theatres in [[Dalmatia]].

==History==
The theatre building was originally constructed as the Split Municipal Theatre in 1893 during the tenure of then mayor Gajo Bulat.&lt;ref name="slobodna6"/&gt; The building was designed by local architects Emilio Vecchietti and Ante Bezić while the interior decoration was done by [[Eugenio Scomparini]], Napoleone Cozzi and Josip Varvodić. The theatre, which had a capacity of 1,000 (at a time when Split had a population of 16,000) was the biggest theatre in [[Southeast Europe]] at the time of its completion.&lt;ref name="slobodna6"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://arhiv.slobodnadalmacija.hr/20040624/feljton01.asp|title=Foyer HNK - koncertni stogodišnjak|last=Kuzmić|first=Nada|date=24 June 2004|work=[[Slobodna Dalmacija]]|language=Croatian|accessdate=16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building was initially used to stage performances by traveling troupes (mostly Italian), as there was no full-time drama ensemble in the city of Split by the very end of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="povijest"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hnk-split.hr/O-nama/Povijest-HNK|title=Povijest HNK|publisher=HNK Split|language=Croatian|accessdate=16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first professional theatre troupe appeared in 1920, when the building underwent its first renovation and when the theatre was renamed "Dalmatian National Theatre". In 1928 during the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] the theatre was merged with the [[Sarajevo National Theatre]] and renamed "National Theatre for Western Regions" (''Narodno pozorište za zapadne oblasti'').&lt;ref name="povijest"/&gt; That same year the professional actors' ensemble was disbanded by the authorities. However, a group of artists led by [[Ivo Tijardović]], formed the Split Theatre Society which continued to perform operas and [[operettas]] into the 1930s.&lt;ref name="povijest"/&gt;

In 1940 the theatre experienced a brief period of revival, adopting its current name and for the first time housing opera, drama and [[ballet]] ensembles. The first [[intendant]] of the theatre was Tijardović, the drama section was led by Marko Fotez, while opera and ballet sections were headed by Oskar Jozefović and Ana Roje. However, the revival proved to be short-lived as the theatre was closed again in 1941 due to Italian occupation during [[World War II]] when portions of southern Croatia were incorporated into the wartime [[Governorship of Dalmatia]]. Following the end of World War II the theatre was re-established on 1 July 1945 and its first season opened in September 1945 with a performance of a play by Croatian author [[Mirko Bogović]].&lt;ref name="povijest"/&gt; 

The theatre has been operating ever since. However, in February 1970 the building was nearly completely destroyed in a fire. During the following decade the house ensembles performed plays at other venues in Split until the newly rebuilt theatre opened its doors again in May 1980.&lt;ref name="povijest"/&gt;

==Present day==
HNK Split hosts around 300 performances every year, attended by a total audience of around 120,000. Some 20 to 40 opera, ballet and dramatic productions are staged per year in addition to many symphony concerts performed by the in-house orchestra.&lt;ref name="hnk9798"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arhiva.hnk-split.hr/hnksplitsezona9798/hnksplit.htm|title=High Theatrical Standards|publisher=HNK Split|accessdate=16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre is billed as the "premier theatre house in [[Dalmatia]]" and "one of the biggest and oldest theatre houses in the [[Mediterranean]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.split.hr/Default.aspx?sec=615|title=Kazališta|publisher=[[City of Split]]|language=Croatian|accessdate=16 May 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713084400/http://www.split.hr/Default.aspx?sec=615|archivedate=13 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Festivals==
Apart from its regular program HNK Split also organizes two long-running annual festivals:
===Splitsko ljeto===
Split Summer Festival (''Splitsko ljeto'') established in 1954, the second oldest festival of performing arts in the country (after the [[Dubrovnik Summer Festival]]). The festival is usually held over a 30-day period between mid-July and mid-August and includes a great number of various events like open-air jazz and classical concerts, art exhibitions, theatre plays staged in public squares and modern dance performances. Parts of the program are usually held at historic venues such as the [[Diocletian's Palace]].&lt;ref name="55thsplit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.splitsko-ljeto.hr/split-summer-festival/55th-Split-Summer-Festival/55th-Split-Summer-Festival|title=55th Split Summer Festival|publisher=Split Summer Festival|accessdate=16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the performers there were renowned conductors [[Kurt Adler]], [[Mladen Bašić]], [[Anton Guadagno]], [[Ernst Märzendorfer]], [[Lovro von Matačić]], [[Boris Papandopulo]], [[Vjekoslav Šutej]], as well as famous singers like [[Martina Arroyo]], [[Radmila Bakočević]],  [[Fiorenza Cedolins]], [[Michèle Crider]], [[Biserka Cvejić]], [[Bonaldo Giaiotti]], [[James McCracken]], [[Zinka Milanov]], [[Hasmik Papian]], [[Enzo Sordello]], [[Eleanor Steber]], [[Lucilla Udovich]], [[Ivo Vinco]] etc.
===Marulićevi dani===
Days of Marulić (''Marulićevi dani'') was established in 1991 on the 490th anniversary of the publication of ''[[Judita]]'', one of the most important Croatian works of literature written by 15th-century author [[Marko Marulić]]. The week-long festival held in April showcases best achievements in Croatian playwriting in the preceding year. The main award at the festival, sponsored by the [[Ministry of Culture (Croatia)|Ministry of Culture]] is the Marin Držić Award, given to the author of the best play written that year.&lt;ref name="marulic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arhiva.hnk-split.hr/2008_2009/19_Marulicevi_dani/o-festivali.htm|title=Festival hrvatske drame i autorskog kazališta|publisher=HNK Split|language=Croatian|accessdate=16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Debarati Halder and [[Karuppannan Jaishankar|K. Jaishankar]] further define cybercrime from the perspective of gender and defined 'cybercrime against women' as "Crimes targeted against women with a motive to intentionally harm the victim psychologically and physically, using modern telecommunication networks such as internet and mobile phones".&lt;ref name="igiglobal.com" /&gt; Internationally, both governmental and non-state actors engage in cybercrimes, including [[espionage]], [[theft|financial theft]], and other cross-border crimes.

=== Financial fraud crimes===
{{Main|Internet fraud}}
[[Computer fraud]] is any dishonest misrepresentation of fact intended to let another to do or refrain from doing something which causes loss. In this context, the fraud will result in obtaining a benefit by:

* Altering in an unauthorized way. This requires little technical expertise and is common form of theft by employees altering the data before entry or entering false data, or by entering unauthorized instructions or using unauthorized processes;
* Altering, destroying, suppressing, or stealing output, usually to conceal unauthorized transactions. This is difficult to detect;
* Altering or deleting stored data;
Other forms of fraud may be facilitated using computer systems, including [[bank fraud]], [[Carding (fraud)|carding]], [[identity theft]], [[extortion]], and [[Classified information|theft of classified information]].

A variety of [[Internet fraud|internet scams]], many based on [[phishing]] and [[social engineering (security)|social engineering]], target consumers and businesses.

===Cyberterrorism===
{{Main|Cyberterrorism}}
Government officials and [[information technology]] security specialists have documented a significant increase in Internet problems and server scans since early 2001. But there is a growing concern among government agencies such as the [[Federal Bureau of Investigations]] (FBI) and the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) that such intrusions are part of an organized effort by [[cyberterrorist]]s, foreign intelligence services, or other groups to map potential security holes in critical systems.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Laqueur|first1=Walter|last2=C.|first2=Smith|last3=Spector|first3=Michael|title=Cyberterrorism|date=2002|publisher=Facts on File|pages=52–53|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H7fT0BQxwDsC&amp;pg=PA49}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cyberterrorist is someone who intimidates or coerces a government or an organization to advance his or her political or social objectives by launching a computer-based attack against computers, networks, or the information stored on them.

Cyberterrorism in general can be defined as an act of [[terrorism]] committed through the use of cyberspace or computer resources (Parker 1983). As such, a simple propaganda piece in the Internet that there will be bomb attacks during the holidays can be considered cyberterrorism. There are also hacking activities directed towards individuals, families, organized by groups within networks, tending to cause fear among people, demonstrate power, collecting information relevant for ruining peoples' lives, robberies, [[blackmail]]ing etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sentinelone.com/blogs/cybercriminals-need-shopping-money-holidays/|title=Cybercriminals Need Shopping Money in 2017, Too! - SentinelOne|website=sentinelone.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cyberextortion===
{{Main|Extortion}}
Cyberextortion occurs when a website, e-mail server, or computer system is subjected to or threatened with repeated denial of service or other attacks by malicious hackers. These hackers demand money in return for promising to stop the attacks and to offer "protection". According to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], cybercrime extortionists are increasingly attacking corporate websites and networks, crippling their ability to operate and demanding payments to restore their service. More than 20 cases are reported each month to the FBI and many go unreported in order to keep the victim's name out of the public domain. Perpetrators typically use a [[distributed denial-of-service attack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ere-security.ca/PDF/Cyberextortion%20by%20DoS,%20Risk%20Magazine%20June%202006.pdf | title=Cyberextortion by Denial-of-Service Attack | author=Lepofsky, Ron | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706175959/http://www.ere-security.ca/PDF/Cyberextortion%20by%20DoS%2C%20Risk%20Magazine%20June%202006.pdf | archivedate=July 6, 2011 | deadurl=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, other cyberextortion techniques exist such as [[doxing]] extortion and [[Bug Poaching|bug poaching]].

An example of cyberextortion was [[Sony Pictures Entertainment hack|the attack on Sony Pictures of 2014]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mohanta|first1=Abhijit|title=Latest Sony Pictures Breach : A Deadly Cyber Extortion |url=http://www.cyphort.com/latest-sony-pictures-breach-deadly-cyber-extortion/|accessdate=20 September 2015|date=6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cyberwarfare===
[[File:U.S. Navy Cyber Defense Operations Command monitor.jpg|thumb|220px|Sailors analyze, detect and defensively respond to unauthorized activity within [[U.S. Navy]] information systems and computer networks]]
{{Main|Cyberwarfare}}
The U.S. [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DoD) notes that the cyberspace has emerged as a national-level concern through several recent events of geostrategic significance. Among those are included, the attack on [[Estonia]]'s infrastructure in 2007, allegedly by Russian hackers. "In August 2008, Russia again allegedly conducted cyberattacks, this time in a coordinated and synchronized kinetic and non-kinetic campaign against the country of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. The [[December 2015 Ukraine power grid cyberattack]] has also been attributed to Russia and is considered the first successful cyberattack on a power grid.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} Fearing that such attacks may become the norm in future warfare among nation-states, the concept of cyberspace operations impacts and will be adapted by warfighting military commanders in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320012856/http://www.carlisle.army.mil/DIME/documents/War%20is%20War%20Issue%20Paper%20Final2.pdf|title=War is War?

===Computer as a target===
These crimes are committed by a selected group of criminals. Unlike crimes using the computer as a tool, these crimes require the technical knowledge of the perpetrators. As such, as technology evolves, so too does the nature of the crime. These crimes are relatively new, having been in existence for only as long as computers have—which explains how unprepared society and the world in general is towards combating these crimes. There are numerous crimes of this nature committed daily on the internet.

Crimes that primarily target computer networks or devices include:
*[[Computer viruses]]
*[[Denial-of-service attacks]]
*[[Malware]] (malicious code)

===Computer as a tool===
{{Main|Internet fraud|Spamming|Phishing|Carding (fraud)}}
When the individual is the main target of cybercrime, the computer can be considered as the tool rather than the target. These crimes generally involve less technical expertise. Human weaknesses are generally exploited. The damage dealt is largely [[psychological]] and intangible, making legal action against the variants more difficult. These are the crimes which have existed for centuries in the offline world. [[Scams]], theft, and the likes have existed even before the development in high-tech equipment. The same criminal has simply been given a tool which increases their potential pool of victims and makes them all the harder to trace and apprehend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cyber Crime definition|url=http://www.crime-research.org/articles/joseph06/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crimes that use computer networks or devices to advance other ends include:
*[[Fraud]] and [[identity theft]] (although this increasingly uses malware, hacking or phishing, making it an example of both "computer as target" and "computer as tool" crime)
*[[Information warfare]]
*[[Phishing|Phishing scams]]
*[[E-mail spam|Spam]]
*Propagation of illegal obscene or offensive content, including harassment and threats

The unsolicited sending of bulk [[email]] for commercial purposes ([[Email spam|spam]]) is unlawful [[E-mail spam legislation by country|in some jurisdictions]].

[[Phishing]] is mostly propagated via email. Phishing emails may contain links to other websites that are affected by malware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Save browsing|url=http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.jp/2012/06/safe-browsing-protecting-web-users-for.html|website=google}}&lt;/ref&gt; Or, they may contain links to fake [[online banking]] or other websites used to steal private account information.

====Obscene or offensive content====
The content of websites and other electronic communications may be distasteful, [[obscene]] or offensive for a variety of reasons. In some instances these communications may be illegal.

The extent to which these communications are unlawful varies greatly between countries, and even within nations. It is a sensitive area in which the courts can become involved in arbitrating between groups with strong beliefs.

One area of [[Internet pornography]] that has been the target of the strongest efforts at curtailment is [[child pornography]], which is illegal in most jurisdictions in the world.

=====Online harassment{{anchor|Harassment}}=====
[[File:Online harassment lit review.jpg|Various aspects needed to be considered when understanding [[harassment]] online.|792x792px]]
{{Globalize|section|date=March 2016}}
{{See also|Cyberbullying|Online predator|Cyberstalking|5=Internet troll}}

Whereas content may be offensive in a non-specific way, [[harassment]] directs obscenities and derogatory comments at specific individuals focusing for example on gender, race, religion, nationality, sexual orientation. This often occurs in chat rooms, through newsgroups, and by sending hate e-mail to interested parties. Harassment on the internet also includes [[revenge porn]].

There are instances where committing a crime using a computer can lead to an enhanced sentence.  For example, in the case of [[United States v. Neil Scott Kramer]], Kramer was served an enhanced sentence according to the [[U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual]] §2G1.3(b)(3)&lt;ref name="2011 U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual"/&gt; for his use of a [[cell phone]] to "persuade, induce, entice, coerce, or facilitate the travel of, the minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct." Kramer argued that this claim was insufficient because his charge included persuading through a computer device and his cellular phone technically is not a computer. Although Kramer tried to argue this point, U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual states that the term computer "means an electronic, magnetic, optical, [[Electrochemistry|electrochemically]], or other high-speed data processing device performing logical, arithmetic, or storage functions, and includes any data storage facility or communications facility directly related to or operating in conjunction with such device."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+18.2-152.7C1 |title=United States of America v. Neil Scott Kramer |date= |accessdate=2013-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Connecticut]] was the U.S. state to pass a statute making it a criminal offense to harass someone by computer. [[Michigan]], [[Arizona]], and [[Virginia]] and [[South Carolina]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victimsofcrime.org/our-programs/stalking-resource-center/stalking-laws/criminal-stalking-laws-by-state/south-Carolina|title=South Carolina|publisher=|accessdate=16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; have also passed laws banning harassment by electronic means.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nerac.com/family/NeracReports/Cybercrimes_CT.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410230359/http://www.nerac.com/family/NeracReports/Cybercrimes_CT.htm|archivedate= April 10, 2008|title=1. In Connecticut, harassment by computer is now a crime |publisher= Nerac Inc.|date=February 3, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.com/jsp/decision_friendly.jsp?id=1202481645474 |title=Section 18.2-152.7:1 |work=Code of Virginia |publisher=Legislative Information System of Virginia |date= |accessdate=2008-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harassment as defined in the U.S. computer statutes is typically distinct from cyberbullying, in that the former usually relates to a person's "use a computer or computer network to communicate obscene, vulgar, profane, lewd, lascivious, or indecent language, or make any suggestion or proposal of an obscene nature, or threaten any illegal or immoral act," while the latter need not involve anything of a sexual nature.

Although [[freedom of speech]] is protected by law in most democratic societies (in the [[US]] this is done by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]), it does not include all types of speech. In fact spoken or written "true threat" speech/text is criminalized because of "intent to harm or intimidate", that also applies for online or any type of network related threats in written text or speech.&lt;ref name="brenner"&gt;Susan W. Brenner, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=gsWQ-xgbLbUC&amp;lpg=PA130 Cybercrime: Criminal Threats from Cyberspace]'', ABC-CLIO, 2010, pp. 91&lt;/ref&gt; The US [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] definition of "true threat" is "statements where the speaker means to communicate a serious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence to a particular individual or group".&lt;ref name="brenner"/&gt;

==Drug trafficking==
[[Darknet market]]s are used to buy and sell [[Recreational drug use|recreational drugs]] online. Some [[drug trafficker]]s use [[End-to-end encryption|encrypted]] messaging tools to communicate with drug mules. The [[dark web]] site [[Silk Road (marketplace)|Silk Road]] was a major online marketplace for drugs before it was shut down by law enforcement (then reopened under new management, and then shut down by law enforcement again). After [[Silk Road (marketplace)|Silk Road]] 2.0 went down, [[Silk Road (marketplace)|Silk Road]] 3 Reloaded emerged. However, it was just an older marketplace named [[Darknet market|Diabolus Market]], that used the name for more exposure from the brand's previous success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailydot.com/layer8/silk-road-3-blake-benthall/|title=We talked to the opportunist imitator behind Silk Road 3.0|date=2014-11-07|access-date=2016-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Documented cases==

* One of the highest profiled banking computer crime occurred during a course of three years beginning in 1970. The chief teller at the Park Avenue branch of New York's [[Union Dime Savings Bank]] embezzled over $1.5 million from hundreds of accounts.&lt;ref name="Weitzer" /&gt;
*  A hacking group called MOD (Masters of Deception), allegedly stole passwords and technical data from [[Pacific Bell]], [[Nynex]], and other telephone companies as well as several big credit agencies and two major universities. The damage caused was extensive, one company, [[Southwestern Bell]] suffered losses of $370,000 alone.&lt;ref name="Weitzer" /&gt;
* In 1983, a 19-year-old UCLA student used his PC to break into a Defense Department International Communications system.&lt;ref name="Weitzer"&gt;{{cite book |last=Weitzer |first=Ronald |title=Current Controversies in Criminology |year=2003 |publisher=Pearson Education Press |location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey |page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Between 1995 and 1998 the [[News Corporation|Newscorp]] satellite pay to view encrypted [[Sky Digital (UK &amp; Ireland)|SKY-TV]] service was hacked several times during an ongoing technological [[arms race]] between a pan-European hacking group and Newscorp. The original motivation of the hackers was to watch Star Trek reruns in Germany; which was something which Newscorp did not have the copyright to allow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David Mann And Mike Sutton |url=http://bjc.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/short/38/2/201 |title=&gt;&gt;Netcrime |publisher=Bjc.oxfordjournals.org |date=2011-11-06 |accessdate=2011-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 26 March 1999, the [[Melissa (computer virus)|Melissa worm]] infected a document on a victim's computer, then automatically sent that document and a copy of the virus spread via e-mail to other people.
* In February 2000, an individual going by the alias of [[MafiaBoy]] began a series [[denial-of-service attack]]s against high-profile websites, including [[Yahoo!]], [[Dell, Inc.]], [[E*TRADE]], [[eBay]], and [[CNN]]. About 50 computers at [[Stanford University]], and also computers at the University of California at Santa Barbara, were amongst the [[zombie computer]]s sending pings in [[DDoS]] attacks. On 3 August 2000, Canadian federal prosecutors charged [[MafiaBoy]] with 54 counts of illegal access to computers, plus a total of ten counts of mischief to data for his attacks.
* The [[Stuxnet]] worm corrupted SCADA microprocessors, particularly of the types used in [[Siemens]] centrifuge controllers.
* The [[Russian Business Network]] (RBN) was registered as an internet site in 2006. Initially, much of its activity was legitimate. But apparently, the founders soon discovered that it was more profitable to host illegitimate activities and started hiring its services to criminals.

* On 2 March 2010, Spanish investigators arrested 3{{Clarify|date=June 2011}} in infection of over 13 million computers around the world. The "botnet" of infected computers included PCs inside more than half of the [[Fortune 1000]] companies and more than 40 major banks, according to investigators.
* In August 2010 the international investigation [[Operation Delego]], operating under the aegis of the [[Department of Homeland Security]], shut down the international [[pedophilia|pedophile]] ring Dreamboard.

==Combating computer crime==

{{Expand section|date=January 2015}}

===Diffusion of cybercrime===
The broad diffusion of cybercriminal activities is an issue in computer crimes detection and prosecution.
According to Jean-Loup Richet (Research Fellow at ESSEC ISIS), technical expertise and accessibility no longer act as barriers to entry into cybercrime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richet|first1=Jean-Loup|title=From Young Hackers to Crackers|journal=International Journal of Technology and Human Interaction|date=2013|volume=9|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, hacking is much less complex than it was a few years ago, as hacking communities have greatly diffused their knowledge through the Internet. Blogs and communities have hugely contributed to information sharing: beginners could benefit from older hackers' knowledge and advice. Furthermore, hacking is cheaper than ever: before the [[cloud computing]] era, in order to spam or scam one needed a dedicated server, skills in server management, network configuration, and maintenance, knowledge of Internet service provider standards, etc. By comparison, a mail [[software-as-a-service]] is a scalable, inexpensive, bulk, and transactional e-mail-sending service for marketing purposes and could be easily set up for [[Email spam|spam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richet|first1=Jean-Loup|title=Adoption of deviant behavior and cybercrime 'Know how' diffusion|journal=York Deviancy Conference|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jean-Loup Richet explains that cloud computing could be helpful for a cybercriminal as a way to leverage his attack – brute-forcing a password, improve the reach of a [[botnet]], or facilitating a spamming campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richet|first1=Jean-Loup|title=How to Become a Black Hat Hacker? An Exploratory Study of Barriers to Entry Into Cybercrime.|journal=17th AIM Symposium|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investigation===
A computer can be a source of [[evidence]] (see [[digital forensics]]). Even where a computer is not directly used for criminal purposes, it may contain records of value to criminal investigators in the form of a [[logfile]]. In most countries{{Citation needed|date = January 2015}} [[Internet Service Providers]] are required, by law, to keep their logfiles for a predetermined amount of time. For example; a European wide [[Data Retention Directive]] (applicable to all [[European Union|EU]] [[member states]]) states that all [[e-mail]] traffic should be retained for a minimum of 12 months.

Methodology of cybercrime investigation

There are many ways for cybercrime to take place, and investigations tend to start with an [[IP Address]] trace, however that is not necessarily a factual basis upon which detectives can solve a case. Different types of high-tech crime may also include elements of low-tech crime, and vice versa, making cybercrime investigators an indispensable part of modern law-enforcement. [[Methodology]] of cybercrime detective work is dynamic and is constantly improving, whether in closed police units, or in international cooperation framework.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unafei.or.jp/english/pdf/RS_No79/No79_15RC_Group2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislation===
Due to easily exploitable laws, cybercriminals use developing countries in order to evade detection and prosecution from law enforcement. In developing countries, such as the [[Philippines]], laws against cybercrime are weak or sometimes nonexistent. These weak laws allow cybercriminals to strike from international borders and remain undetected. Even when identified, these criminals avoid being punished or extradited to a country, such as the [[United States]], that has developed laws that allow for prosecution. While this proves difficult in some cases, agencies, such as the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], have used deception and subterfuge to catch criminals. For example, two Russian hackers had been evading the FBI for some time. The FBI set up a fake computing company based in Seattle, Washington. They proceeded to lure the two Russian men into the United States by offering them work with this company. Upon completion of the interview, the suspects were arrested outside of the building. Clever tricks like this are sometimes a necessary part of catching cybercriminals when weak legislation makes it impossible otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kshetri|first=Nir|title= Diffusion and Effects of Cyber Crime in Developing Countries|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&amp;sid=21efdb54-ad43-447f-ab46-ce7fa854a98f%40sessionmgr4003&amp;hid=4109&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=buh&amp;AN=55328703/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Barack Obama]] released in an executive order in April 2015 to combat cybercrime. The executive order allows the United States to freeze assets of convicted cybercriminals and block their economic activity within the United States. This is some of the first solid legislation that combats cybercrime in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Northam|first=Jackie|title=U.S. Creates First Sanctions Program Against Cybercriminals|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2015/04/01/396811276/u-s-creates-first-sanctions-program-against-cybercriminals/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Union adopted directive 2013/40/EU. All offences of the directive, and other definitions and procedural institutions are also in the [[Council of Europe]]'s [[Convention on Cybercrime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://jolas.ro/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/jolas_sia38.pdf | title=Analysis of Directive 2013/40/EU on attacks against information systems in the context of approximation of law at the European level | author=Adrian Cristian MOISE | journal=Journal of Law and Administrative Sciences | year=2015 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208231600/http://jolas.ro/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/jolas_sia38.pdf | archivedate=December 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Penalties===
Penalties for computer-related crimes in [[New York (state)|New York]] State can range from a fine and a short period of jail time for a Class A misdemeanor such as unauthorized use of a computer up to computer tampering in the first degree which is a Class C felony and can carry 3 to 15 years in prison.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

However, some [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]] have been hired as [[information security]] experts by private companies due to their inside knowledge of computer crime, a phenomenon which theoretically could create [[Moral hazard|perverse incentives]]. A possible counter to this is for courts to ban convicted hackers from using the Internet or computers, even after they have been released from prison{{Spaced ndash}}though as computers and the Internet become more and more central to everyday life, this type of punishment may be viewed as more and more harsh and draconian. However, nuanced approaches have been developed that manage cyber offenders behavior without resorting to total computer or Internet bans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Managing the Risks Posed by Offender Computer Use - Perspectives|date=December 2011|url=http://appaweb.csg.org/Perspectives/Perspectives_V35_N4_P40.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; These approaches involve restricting individuals to specific devices which are subject to computer monitoring or computer searches by probation or parole officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowker |first=Art |year=2012 |title=The Cybercrime Handbook for Community Corrections: Managing Risk in the 21st Century |location=Springfield |publisher=Thomas |isbn=9780398087289 |url=http://www.ccthomas.com/details.cfm?P_ISBN13=9780398087289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Awareness ===
As technology advances and more people rely on the internet to store sensitive information such as banking or credit card information, criminals increasingly attempt to steal that information.  Cybercrime is becoming more of a threat to people across the world. Raising awareness about how information is being protected and the tactics criminals use to steal that information continues to grow in importance. According to the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center in 2014, there were 269,422 complaints filed. With all the claims combined there was a reported total loss of $800,492,073.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pdf.ic3.gov/2014_IC3Report.pdf|title=2014 Internet Crime Report|last=|first=|date=2015|website=[[Internet Crime Complaint Center]] (IC3)|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; But cybercrime does yet seem to be on the average person's radar. There are 1.5 million cyber-attacks annually, that means that there are over 4,000 attacks a day, 170 attacks every hour, or nearly three attacks every minute, with studies showing us that only 16% of victims had asked the people who were carrying out the attacks to stop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feinberg|first=T|year=2008|title=Whether it happens at school or off-campus, cyberbullying disrupts and affects.|url=|journal=Cyberbullying|volume=|pages=10|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anybody who uses the internet for any reason can be a victim, which is why it is important to be aware of how one is being protected while online.

=== Intelligence ===
As cybercrime has proliferated, a professional ecosystem has evolved to support individuals and groups seeking to profit from cybercriminal activities.  The ecosystem has become quite specialized, including malware developers, botnet operators, professional cybercrime groups, groups specializing in the sale of stolen content, and so forth.  A few of the leading cybersecurity companies have the skills, resources and visibility to follow the activities of these individuals and group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.symantec.com/content/dam/symantec/docs/security-center/white-papers/dridex-financial-trojan-16-en.pdf|title=Dridex: Tidal waves of spam pushing dangerous financial Trojan|last=|first=|date=|website=symantec.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A wide variety of information is available from these sources which can be used for defensive purposes, including technical indicators such as hashes of infected files&lt;ref name="fireeye.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/09/apt33-insights-into-iranian-cyber-espionage.html|title=Insights into Iranian Cyber Espionage: APT33 Targets Aerospace and Energy Sectors and has Ties to Destructive Malware « Insights into Iranian Cyber Espionage: APT33 Targets Aerospace and Energy Sectors and has Ties to Destructive Malware|last=|first=|date=|website=FireEye|access-date=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; or malicious IPs/URLs,&lt;ref name="fireeye.com"/&gt; as well as strategic information profiling the goals, techniques and campaigns of the profiled groups.  Some of it is freely published, but consistent, on-going access typically requires subscribing to an adversary intelligence subscription service. At the level of an individual threat actor, threat intelligence is often referred to that actor's "TTP", or "tactics, techniques, and procedures," as the infrastructure, tools, and other technical indicators are often trivial for attackers to change. Corporate sectors are considering crucial role of [[artificial intelligence]] cyber security.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-ai-can-help-stop-cyberattacks-1537322940|title=How AI Can Help Stop Cyberattacks|last=Janofsky|first=Adam|date=2018-09-19|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2018-09-20|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.computerworld.com/article/3081326/security/this-company-uses-ai-to-stop-cyberattacks-before-they-start.html|title=This company uses A.I. to stop cyberattacks before they start|last=Noyes|first=Katherine|work=Computerworld|access-date=2018-09-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dafne''''' is the earliest known work that, by modern standards, could be considered an [[opera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sonneck |first=O.

''Dafne'' was first performed during [[Carnival]] of 1598 (1597 [[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar|old style]]) at the Palazzo Corsi.&lt;ref&gt;Edmond Strainchamps, "Corsi, Jacopo" in [[New Grove]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''Dafne'' is scored for a much smaller ensemble than [[Claudio Monteverdi]]'s slightly later operas, namely, a [[harpsichord]], a [[lute]], a [[viol]], an [[archlute]], and a triple flute.&lt;ref name="na"&gt;{{cite book |last=Otten |first=Joseph |date=1911 |title=Catholic Encyclopedia |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10657a.htm |location=New York |publisher=Robert Appleton Company |page= |isbn= |author-link= |access-date=7 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Explain|date=September 2012}}&lt;!--quite aside from the question of whether "triple flute" is a typo for treble, what is New Catholic Encyclopedia going by? --&gt; Drawing on a new development at the time, Peri established [[recitative]]s, melodic speech set to music, as a central part of opera.&lt;ref name="at"&gt;[https://archive.is/20121130170806/http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:cejxVYY_gLYJ:at.or.at/hans/misc/itp/newmediahistory/dafne.xhtml&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=41 Jacopo Peri – Dafne page]&lt;/ref&gt;

The story of [[Apollo]] falling in love with the eponymous [[nymph]], [[Daphne]], the opera was written for an elite circle of [[Renaissance humanism|humanists]] in [[Florence]], the [[Florentine Camerata]], between 1594 and 1597, with the support, and possibly the collaboration, of the composer and patron [[Jacopo Corsi]].&lt;ref name="at"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Porter |first=William V. |date=1965 |title=Peri and Corsi's "Dafne": Some New Discoveries and Observations |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/830682 |journal=Journal of the American Musicological Society |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=170-196 |doi=10.2307/830682 |access-date=17 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An attempt to revive [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek drama]],&lt;ref name="na"/&gt; according to modern scholarship, it was a long way off from what the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] would have recognized.&lt;ref name="at" /&gt;

Most of Peri's music has been lost, despite its popularity and fame in [[Europe]] at the time of its composition, but the 455 line verse libretto was published and survives. Florence's ruling [[House of Medici|Medici family]] was sufficiently taken with ''Dafne'' to allow Peri's next work, [[Euridice (opera)|''Euridice'']], to be performed as part of [[Marie de' Medici]] and [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]]'s wedding celebrations in 1600.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/story/0,23483,20827633-5010927,00.html |title=Music to the ears |last= |first= |date=27 November 2006 |website=[[news.com.au]] |publisher= |access-date=7 August 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604160329/http://www.news.com.au/music-to-the-ears/story-0-1111112591568 |archive-date=4 June 2011 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.musicwithease.com/opera-before-gluck.html |title=Opera Before Gluck |last= |first= |date= |website=Music With Ease |publisher= |access-date=7 August 2007 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Domestic Abuse Restraining Order''' (DARO) is a form of [[restraining order]] or [[order of protection]] used under the [[domestic abuse]] laws of the state of [[Wisconsin]]&lt;ref name="dvro"&gt;{{cite web|title=Domestic Abuse Restraining Order|url=http://www.womenslaw.org/laws_state_type.php?id=609&amp;state_code=WI|work=Women'sLaw.Org|publisher=National Network to end Domestic Violence|accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="domabusewislegis"&gt;{{cite web|title=Domestic abuse restraining orders and injunctions|url=http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/813/12|publisher=Wisconsin Legislature|accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and enforceable nationwide under invocation of the [[Full Faith and Credit Clause]] in the [[Violence Against Women Act]] ({{UnitedStatesCode|18|2265}}).  It is a legal intervention in which one person (the respondent) who is deemed to be hurting, threatening or stalking another person (the petitioner) is ordered to stop—and often cease all direct and indirect contact—with the goal of reducing risk of further threat or harm to the petitioner.  The petitioner and respondent will generally be in certain specific relationships such as a spousal or sexual relationship.  If the petitioner is in an unwanted stalking relationship with the respondent, however, a closely related form of injunction, a '''Harassment Restraining Order''' (HRO) may be more appropriate.&lt;ref name="hro"&gt;{{cite web|title=Harassment Restraining Order|url=http://www.womenslaw.org/laws_state_type.php?id=12418&amp;state_code=WI|work=Women'sLaw.Org|publisher=National Network to end Domestic Violence|accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wislegis"&gt;{{cite web|title=Harassment restraining orders and injunctions|url=http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/813/125|publisher=Wisconsin Legislature|accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pursuant to Wis. Stat. § 813.12, domestic abuse for the purposes of obtaining either type of restraining order is defined to include intentional infliction of physical pain, physical injury or illness;  intentional impairment of physical condition;  [[sexual intercourse]] under Wis. Stat. § 940.225;&lt;ref name="wislegissexualintercourse"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual assault|url=http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/940/II/225|publisher=Wisconsin Legislature|accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wcadvrestrainingordergrid"&gt;{{cite web|title=Restraining Orders in Wisconsin|url=http://www.endabusewi.org//FileStream.aspx?FileID=861|work=WCADV|publisher=Wisconsin Coalition Against Domestic Violence|accessdate=8 Jul 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[sexual contact]] under Wis. Stat. § 940.225;&lt;ref name="wislegissexualintercourse"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wcadvrestrainingordergrid"/&gt;  [[stalking]] under Wis. Stat. § 940.32;&lt;ref name="wislegisstalking"&gt;{{cite web|title=Stalking|url=http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/940/II/32|publisher=Wisconsin Legislature|accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wcadvrestrainingordergrid"/&gt;  damage to property under Wis. Stat. § 943.01;&lt;ref name="wislegispropertydamage"&gt;{{cite web|title=Damage to property|url=http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/943/I/01|publisher=Wisconsin Legislature|accessdate=24 Nov 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wcadvrestrainingordergrid"/&gt;  or a threat to do any of the above.  A petitioner whose has experienced domestic abuse, under this definition, can file for either type of order for free.&lt;ref name="nofeehro"&gt;{{cite web|title=Civil actions; fees of the clerk of court|url=https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/814/II/61/1/e|publisher=Wisconsin Legislature|accessdate=24 Nov 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="petitionhro"&gt;{{cite web|title=Petition for Temporary Restraining Order and/or Petition and Motion for Injunction Hearing|url=https://wicourts.gov/forms/cv-405.pdf|publisher=State of Wisconsin, Circuit Court|accessdate=24 Nov 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pursuant to Wis. Stat. § 813.125, other forms of harassment for the purposes of obtaining a harassment restraining order include striking, shoving, kicking, or other physical abuse;  or repeated intimidating acts.  Petitioning for a harassment restraining order that does not qualify as domestic abuse requires the payment of a fee.&lt;ref name="wislegis"/&gt;

==Provisions and process==
In Wisconsin there are similar processes for obtaining a domestic violence or harassment restraining order.&lt;ref name="hro"/&gt;  The first step is ordinarily for the woman—the Wisconsin Coalition Against Domestic Violence generally refers to petitioners as female as most are women&lt;ref name="gender"&gt;{{cite web|title=Process for Obtaining a Restraining Order in Wisconsin|url=http://www.endabusewi.org/sites/default/files/resources/process_for_obtaining_a_restraining_order.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310232414/http://www.endabusewi.org/sites/default/files/resources/process_for_obtaining_a_restraining_order.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=10 March 2016|work=WCADV|publisher=Wisconsin Coalition Against Domestic Violence|accessdate=12 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;—to file an initial petition with the court.&lt;ref name="dvro"/&gt; It is free of charge to file a petition for a domestic abuse restraining order.  The harassment restraining order sometimes requires a fee but this is waived if the abuse also qualifies as domestic abuse, which it often does.  The woman often begins the process under extreme stress and overwhelmed with emotion.  She must provide a detailed written statement of the facts supporting the granting of the order.&lt;ref name="montecarloanalysis"/&gt;  She may request that a temporary restraining order be granted for a period of up to 14 days.  The temporary restraining order may be granted [[ex parte]]—without the abuser having the opportunity to appear in court.  Unlike in some states, in Wisconsin an ex parte order can be granted on the basis of past abuse, with no further evidence of the likelihood of future abuse being needed.&lt;ref name="wrecking"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stark|first1=Debra|last2=Choplin|first2=Jessica|title=Seeing the Wrecking Ball in Motion: Ex Parte Protection Orders and the Realities of Domestic Violence|url=https://repository.jmls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1672&amp;context=facpubs|date=2017|work=[[University of Wisconsin Law School|Wisconsin Journal of Law, Gender &amp; Society]]|publisher=[[University of Wisconsin Law School]]|accessdate=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The woman will also request that a full hearing—at which the abuser will be present—be held to determine whether to grant a permanent restraining order.&lt;ref name="dvro"/&gt;  Wisconsin courts will have jurisdiction to hear the case if the petitioner resides in Wisconsin--even if the respondent does not also reside in Wisconsin.&lt;ref name="jurisdiction"&gt;{{cite web|title=Personal jurisdiction, grounds for generally|url=http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/801/05|publisher=Wisconsin Legislature|accessdate=24 Nov 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The temporary restraining order does not go into effect until it is served to the person being restrained. Serving the restraining order is the responsibility of the [[petitioner]]. Service can be carried out by the [[Sheriffs in the United States|Sheriff's Department]] of the county where the harasser lives or works, or by any adult who is not a party named in the case.&lt;ref name="dvro"/&gt;  Judges are assigned to restraining order hearings on a rotating basis, with each judge handling restraining order hearings for one week every few months.  At the full hearing, petitioners are seated on one side of the courtroom, and respondents on the other side.  The hearing usually lasts about 15–30 minutes.&lt;ref name="montecarloanalysis"/&gt;  At the hearing, both parties will have an opportunity to testify and present evidence, and the judge will make a decision.  The permanent restraining order, if granted, may be in effect for up to four years, and the judge must, if granting it, grant it for as long as the petitioner requests up to four years.&lt;ref name="wislegis"/&gt;  The order may also be granted, or extended, up to ten years if there is a substantial risk that the respondent may commit [[homicide]] or [[sexual assault]] against the petitioner.&lt;ref name="wcadvrestrainingordergrid"/&gt;  Respondents are supposed to be held by the bailiff for 15 minutes after the hearing ends to allow petitioners to leave safely, but this rule isn't always followed.&lt;ref name="montecarloanalysis"/&gt;

An HRO or DARO can require the harasser to stop harassing the victim, and/or avoid the victim's residence or temporary place of accommodation.&lt;ref name="hro"/&gt;  Like a DARO, subsequent to 17 April 2014, an HRO may also require that the harasser avoid all contact with the victim.&lt;ref name="act2013"&gt;{{cite web|title=2013 Wisconsin Act 322|url=https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2013/related/acts/322|publisher=Wisconsin Legislature|accessdate=24 Nov 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==GPS monitoring for respondents==
Wisconsin is considering requiring [[Ankle monitor|GPS monitoring]] for all persons subject to a harassment or domestic abuse restraining order.  At the present time, a pilot program will provide funds for testing such a program in some counties before it is implemented statewide.&lt;ref name="wsj27"&gt;{{cite web|title=State budget committee rejects GPS monitoring expansion|url=http://host.madison.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/state-budget-committee-rejects-gps-monitoring-expansion/article_17f6213e-5584-5d90-9e57-81b4f147a89b.html|publisher=Wisconsin State Journal|accessdate=14 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wislegis27"&gt;{{cite web|title=Global positioning system pilot programs; grants|url=http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/165/94|publisher=Wisconsin Legislature|accessdate=14 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once implemented, the program would make Wisconsin the only state in the country to order GPS monitoring for those who are under, but who have not violated, a restraining order.  The program has not yet been implemented by the [[Wisconsin Department of Justice]] ('''DOJ'''), however.  The DOJ claims that current law does not permit judges to order [[GPS tracking unit|GPS tracking]] for those who have not violated a restraining order.  The governor's office has pledged to tweak the language in the next budget so the program can go ahead.&lt;ref name="doj"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wisconsin DOJ never launched GPS program|url=http://host.madison.com/news/state-and-regional/wisconsin-doj-never-launched-gps-program/article_0c4fb21e-e3b5-5795-bb95-6a4f3baf8b1f.html|publisher=Madison.com|accessdate=19 Sep 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140920002332/http://host.madison.com/news/state-and-regional/wisconsin-doj-never-launched-gps-program/article_0c4fb21e-e3b5-5795-bb95-6a4f3baf8b1f.html|archivedate=2014-09-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Punishment for violation==
Law enforcement must make an arrest if they have probable cause to believe that the abuser has violated a HRO or DARO.  Upon conviction, the penalty is a fine of up to $10,000 and/or a prison term of up to 9 months.&lt;ref name="wislegis"/&gt;  Violators may be subject to [[Ankle monitor|global positioning system tracking]] based upon a risk assessment by the department of corrections.  The victim may be referred to a [[domestic violence]] or sexual assault victim service provider.&lt;ref name="wislegis2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Global positioning system tracking|url=http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/813/129|publisher=Wisconsin Legislature|accessdate=5 Jul 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An [[exclusion zone]] will be created which the violator is not permitted to enter under GPS tracking.&lt;ref name="wislegisexclusionzone"&gt;{{cite web|title=Global positioning system tracking for persons who violate certain orders or injunctions|url=http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/301/49|publisher=Wisconsin Legislature|accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NCIC registration and firearms restrictions==
The HRO or DARO will generally be registered in the Protection Order File of the [[National Crime Information Center]].  At the state level, a domestic abuse restraining order will automatically trigger a restriction on owning or possessing firearms.  For a harassment restraining order, such restrictions are at the discretion of the judge granting the order and are not automatic.

Federal restrictions on firearms may also apply.  The NCIC entry will include a "Brady indicator" indicating whether the restrained person is prohibited from owning firearms under federal law, with a "Y" indicating yes (the restrictions do apply), "N" for no, and "U" for unknown.  Generally the Brady indicator will be set to "Y" only if certain relationships exist between the parties, such as a sexual/romantic relationship or a parent/child relationship.  If the restraining order does not specify the relationship, an attempt is made to determine the relationship from other available data before setting it to "U".&lt;ref name="brady"&gt;{{cite web|title=Protection Orders and Federal Firearms Prohibitions|url=http://www.atf.gov/files/publications/download/i/atf-i-3310-2.pdf|work=www.atf.gov|publisher=Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|accessdate=22 Dec 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The federal Brady indicator restrictions, which are automatic if, and only if, certain conditions apply are distinct from possible state restrictions on HRO or DARO respondents possessing firearms.  For an HRO, a state restriction on the respondent possessing firearms will depend on whether the judge, at his or her discretion, feels the respondent is a risk to use a firearm to harm others, but it is not automatic.&lt;ref name="wcadvrestrainingordergrid"/&gt;

==Types of Restraining Orders in Wisconsin==
The domestic abuse and harassment restraining orders are among the several types of restraining orders used in Wisconsin.  The DARO is similar to the HRO but requires that certain specific relationships exist or did exist between the parties.&lt;ref name="dvro"/&gt;  The child abuse restraining order is also similar but is used where the victim of the abuse is a minor.&lt;ref name="caro"&gt;{{cite web|title=Child Abuse Restraining Order|url=http://www.womenslaw.org/laws_state_type.php?id=12360&amp;state_code=WI|work=Women'sLaw.Org|publisher=National Network to end Domestic Violence|accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike the HRO, both the domestic abuse and child abuse restraining orders carry an automatic requirement not to possess firearms under state law.&lt;ref name="wcadvrestrainingordergrid"/&gt;  The individual at risk restraining order is a restraining order designed to protect adults with significant impairment in their ability to care for themselves.&lt;ref name="iarro"&gt;{{cite web|title=Individual at Risk Restraining Order|url=http://www.womenslaw.org/laws_state_type.php?id=12425&amp;state_code=WI|work=Women'sLaw.Org|publisher=National Network to end Domestic Violence|accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The petitioner will sometimes have a choice as to whether to file a domestic abuse or harassment restraining order.  The differences between the two orders have grown less over the years.  In the past the penalties were less for violating a harassment restraining order, and a full no contact order could not be issued in a harassment restraining order hearing.  A petitioner whose request for a temporary restraining order was denied was formerly entitled to a later injunction hearing only for domestic abuse restraining orders.  If the respondent and petitioner shared a residence, the respondent could, in the past, not be ordered to avoid that residence under a harassment restraining order.  These differences have been significantly reduced.  Harassment and domestic abuse restraining orders now have the same penalties for violation, and a full no contact order can now be made in either case.  The respondent can now be ordered to avoid the petitioner's residence in either case.  A full hearing will now be granted in either case even if the temporary order is denied provided that, in the case of a harassment restraining order, the harassment also meets the definition of domestic abuse.&lt;ref name="meuer1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Meuer|first=Tess|title=Harassment Orders Become More Parallel to Domestic Abuse Orders|url=http://www.endabusewi.org/FileStream.aspx?FileID=84|publisher=Wisconsin Coalition Against Domestic Violence|date=Jan 2010|page=9|accessdate=24 Nov 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="act2013"/&gt;  The significant difference between the two types of orders that remains is the fact that the domestic abuse order carries an automatic firearms ban, while the harassment order does not.  Sometimes petitioners who are eligible for both will opt for the harassment order because they don't want to force the respondents to give up their firearms.  This can carry significant risks for petitioners, as guns are the most common cause of domestic abuse homicides in Wisconsin.  Between 2000 and 2010, there were 213 domestic abuse murders in Wisconsin by guns, more than the 194 murders by knives, other weapons, or other means combined.  As such, a petitioner stipulating to a harassment restraining order rather than a domestic abuse order must be questioned to the judge as to whether she entered into the stipulation voluntarily and understands the differences between the two types of orders.

==Petitioner success rates==
A 2006 Wisconsin study showed that female petitioners were successful about 62 percent of the time in seeking restraining orders at the full hearing where the respondents had the chance to be present.  The success rate appeared to be higher if the petitioners were represented by advocates or attorneys.&lt;ref name="montecarloanalysis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legalaidresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/Research-Increasing-Access-to-REstraining-Order-for-Low-Income-Victims-of-DV-A-Cost-Benefit-Analysis-of-the-Proposed-Domestic-Abuse-Grant-Program.pdf| title=Increasing Access to Restraining Orders for Low Income Victims of Domestic Violence:  A Cost-Benefit Analysis of the Proposed Domestic Abuse Grant Program |publisher=[[State Bar of Wisconsin]] |date=December 2006 |accessdate=2016-12-12|last1=Elwart|first1=Liz|last2=Emerson|first2=Nina|last3=Enders|first3=Christina|last4=Fumia|first4=Dani|last5=Murphy|first5=Kevin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness==
Experts disagree on whether restraining orders are effective in preventing further harassment. A 2010 analysis published in the ''[[Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law]]'' reviewed 15 U.S. studies of restraining order effectiveness, and concluded that restraining orders "can serve a useful role in threat management."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Benitez, MD|first1=Christopher T.|last2=McNiel, PhD|first2=Dale E.|last3=Binder, MD|first3=Renée L.|title=Do Protection Orders Protect?|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and Law|year=2010|volume=38|series=3|pages=376–385|url=http://www.jaapl.org/cgi/content/full/38/3/376|accessdate=14 June 2011|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2002 analysis of 32 U.S. studies found that restraining orders are violated an average of 40 per cent of the time and are perceived as being "followed by worse events" almost 21 per cent of the time, and concluded that "evidence of [restraining orders'] relative efficacy is lacking," and that they may pose some degree of risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Spitzberg|first=Brian H.|title=The Tactical Topography of Stalking Victimization and Management|journal=Trauma, Violence and Abuse|date=October 2002|volume=3|series=4|pages=261–288|url=http://tva.sagepub.com/content/3/4/261.full.pdf+html|accessdate=14 June 2011|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large America-wide [[Statistical_survey#Telephone|telephone survey]] conducted in 1998 found that, of stalking victims who obtained a restraining order, more than 68 per cent reported it being violated by their stalker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tjaden|first=P.|author2=Thoennes, N.|title=Stalking In America: Findings From the National Violence Against Women Survey|journal=National Institute of Justice and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|date=April 1998|issue=NCJ 169592|pages=1–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Threat management experts are often suspicious of restraining orders, believing they may escalate or enrage stalkers. In his 1997 book ''[[The Gift of Fear|The Gift Of Fear]]'', well-known American security specialist [[Gavin de Becker]] characterized restraining orders as "homework assignments police give to women to prove they're really committed to getting away from their pursuers," and said they "clearly serve police and prosecutors," but "they do not always serve victims."  De Becker also observed that restraining orders are most effective when the emotional involvement is lowest—for example, when used following a brief, unsatisfactory, dating relationship as opposed to with an ex-spouse.  In the case of stalking, de Becker advised that restraining orders are most effective if the woman rejects once, and then obtains the restraining order immediately following any further unwanted contact.  If she continues to allow contact for an extended period after an initial firm rejection, any eventual restraining order may be less effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=De Becker|first=Gavin|title=The Gift Of Fear And Other Survival Signals That Will Protect Us From Violence|year=1997|publisher=Dell Publishing|location=New York|isbn=0-440-22619-8|pages=223–229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Douglas-Grumman Scandal''' was a bribery scandal that rocked Japan in February 1979&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vogel|first1=Ezra F.|last2=Yuan|first2=Ming|last3=Tanaka|first3=Akihiko|title=The Golden Age of the U.S.-China-Japan Triangle, 1972–1989|date=2002|publisher=Harvard Univ Asia Center|isbn=9780674009608|page=55|url=https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=oupsPZG1S2IC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;dq=Douglas+Grumman+scandal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=miAb-6NBsC&amp;sig=t8z6LtedrNfgaH_EbnfzwsFRfJk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj35pbP2ZLWAhUGfFAKHY4wAPsQ6AEITjAL#v=onepage&amp;q=Douglas%20Grumman%20scandal&amp;f=false|accessdate=7 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, concerning the sale of American fighter jets.

== History ==
; 1968
: Japan's [[Ministry of Defense (Japan)|Ministry of Defense]] was considering various candidates for the [[Japan Air Self-Defense Force|Air SDF]]'s new fighter jet, including the [[List of Lockheed F-104 Starfighter variants|Lockheed CL1010-2]], [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|McDonnell-Douglas F-4]], [[Saab 37 Viggen]] and [[Dassault Mirage F1]]. However, in practice the CL-1010-2 was still under development, and the probability of using European jets was low due to the [[Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan|US-Japan security treaty]], so there were few real contenders other than the F-4.

; 1969 
: It was decided to use the F-4EJ, based on the F-4E (normally it would have been called the F-4J, in keeping with the F-104J and F-15J that had also been modified for Japan, but there was already an F-4J in the US Navy). The differences from the F-4E, due to pressure from the Japan Socialist Party, were the removal of key apparatus such as the nuclear bomb pre-flight controller (DCU-9/A), weapons release computer (ASQ-91), [[AGM-12 Bullpup|Bullpup]] air-to-ground missile controller (ARW-77) and aerial refuelling equipment.

; 1972
:At the US-Japan meetings in Hawaii, President [[Richard Nixon]] persuaded Prime Minister [[Kakuei Tanaka]] to buy the [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3C]] and [[Northrop Grumman E-2 Hawkeye|E-2C]].

; 1978
:25 December – The [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) accuses [[McDonnell-Douglas]] of paying Japanese government officials US$15,000 in 1975 as bribes to buy their aircraft.

; 1979
:4 January – The SEC accuses [[Grumman]] of paying various Japanese government officials ([[Nobusuke Kishi]], [[Takeo Fukuda]], [[Yasuhiro Nakasone]], [[Raizo Matsuno|Raizō Matsuno]] and others) bribes via [[Sojitz|Nisshō Iwai (now Sojitz]]) to buy their E-2C aircraft. [[Tokyo District Court]] also commences an investigation, requesting information from the SEC.
:30 January – The [[House of Representatives (Japan)|House of Representatives]] Lockheed Investigation Special Committee is renamed the "Special Committee to Investigate Aircraft Imports", with a remit to investigate all allegations concerning aircraft sales.
:1 February – [[Mitsutaka Shimada]], the Nisshō Iwai executive in charge of the aircraft department, dies by falling&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scott-stokes|first1=Henry|title=Japanese Kills Himself in Plane Scandal Case|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/02/archives/japanese-kills-himself-in-plane-scandal-case-japanese-takes-life-in.html|accessdate=7 September 2017|work=The New York Times|date=2 February 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; from its head office building in [[Akasaka, Tokyo]], leaving various suicide notes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=島田三敬|url=http://www004.upp.so-net.ne.jp/kuhiwo/dazai/shimada.html|accessdate=7 September 2017|date=14 January 2010|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114195842/http://www004.upp.so-net.ne.jp/kuhiwo/dazai/shimada.html|archivedate=14 January 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A documentary at the time questions whether it was really suicide, on the basis it would be impossible to climb a high window after stabbing one's heart, and a book by journalist [[Kōichirō Yoshihara]] also alleges, with medical evidence, that it was in fact murder. The main 'suicide' note included the words "The company's life is eternal... we should serve it for eternity." The death of a key person causes the investigation to stall.
:14 February – The House of Representatives Budget Committee questions Nissho Iwai's Vice President [[Hachirō Kaifu]] (no relation to the later Prime Minister [[Toshiki Kaifu]]), President [[Mitsuo Ueda]], and former aircraft division manager [[Kunio Arimori]], live on TV&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=‘Shoko’ testimony goes live on TV|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/1999/12/14/national/shoko-testimony-goes-live-on-tv/#.WbFd6XCrL4E|accessdate=7 September 2017|work=The Japan Times Online|date=14 December 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Kaifu appeared unable to sign his statement as his hand was trembling too much&lt;ref name="Welfield"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Welfield|first1=John|title=An Empire in Eclipse: Japan in the Post-war American Alliance System: A Study in the Interraction of Domestic Politics and Foreign Policy|date=2013|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9781780939957|pages=440-441|url=https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=U6sVAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA440&amp;lpg=PA440&amp;dq=arimori+kunio+%22Nissho+Iwai%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WzHHDctXF0&amp;sig=b6zaBojbxe83c8TuK7FgrzXhpUA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjMkPbmnZPWAhWF1RQKHcAEBkkQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=arimori%20kunio%20%22Nissho%20Iwai%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=7 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which he later claimed was due to [[Parkinson's disease]]. Kaifu repeatedly said "I cannot remember", rejecting the bribery allegations, but confirmed that he had talks with former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka at around the time of the 1972 US-Japan Hawaii meetings, and Matsuno at around the time of the change to Grumman's agent ([[Itochu|Itōchū Corporation]], known at the time as C. Itoh &amp; Co.). He refused to confirm he had hand-written the "Kaifu memo" which was one focus of the questions. Kaifu was also questioned about his relationship with [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|LDP]] parliamentarian [[Rokusuke Tanaka]], and claimed in the National Assembly that he had had no contact.
:14 March – Nisshō Iwai's Air Department manager and deputy manager are arrested on suspicion of Foreign Exchange Act violations. These individuals had had no interactions with politicians, but are later found guilty of 'falsification and exercise of a private document'. The deputy manager claims that he was not involved, and was targeted by the prosecutors due to being Shimada's top manager in charge of military aircraft, while the counterfeit document had in fact been substantially created by his predecessor and the accounts department manager.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ivis.co.jp/saloon/4_Imamura/01_bibrio/Imamu-01-6.html IVIS HomePage 私の風土記]&lt;/ref&gt;
:19 March – Kaifu is questioned by the [[House of Councillors]] Budget Committee, and denies writing the "Kaifu memo". On 4 April he is accused of [[perjury]] on this point.
:22 March – Nisshō Iwai's former Vice President [[Kenjirō Yamamura]] and Executive Director [[Kiyoshi Inoue]] give evidence contradicting Kaifu at the Budget Committee. Yamamura testifies with regard to Kaifu's testimony at the House of Representatives Budget Committee that he was "confused".
:31 March – Due to the conflicting evidence from Kaifu and Yamamura, the House of Councilors Budget Committee summons Kaifu, former chairman [[Yoshio Tsuji]], and [[Yasuhiro Gō]], former economic adviser to McDonnell-Douglas. Kaifu amends key parts of his testimony on the 19th, but notably keeps his attitude that responsibility lay with the late Shimada.
:2 April – Kaifu is arrested on suspicion of Foreign Exchange Act violations. When the House of Councilors budget committee hear of his arrest that day, [[Ministry of Justice (Japan)|Ministry of Justice]] Criminal Bureau Head (later [[Attorney General]]) [[Shigeki Itō]] comments that '''The purpose of the investigation is not only to find small evils but also not to overlook greater evils. If the crime is at the top, we must understand and identify it thoroughly.''' suggesting that the scandal might spread to the centre of the political world. Itō's words '''Do not overlook greater evils''' and (later, in his response to a special committee meeting of the upper house on 25 May) '''500&amp;nbsp;million yen for starters''' become buzzwords of the year.
:16 April – The Attorney General, in overall charge of the investigation, changes from [[Hisao Kamiya]] (retiring due to age) to [[Tatsusaburō Tsuji]]. In his final press conference, Kamiya says '''The prosecutors still have plenty of ability to investigate – I am leaving midway, but am happy to sense their strength of intention'''.
:24 April – Kaifu is rearrested on suspicion of perjury in the House of Representatives.
:26 April – The Diet opposition parties collectively demand that Kishi, Matsuno and others be questioned about their involvement. The LDP refuses, and the National Assembly is left in limbo.
:9 May – Itō suggests at the Legal Committee of the House of Representatives that the names "Fukuda" and "Matsuno" in the memo are unrelated to LDP representatives of the same names.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kokkai.ndl.go.jp/SENTAKU/syugiin/087/0080/08705090080012a.html 87th House of Representatives Legal Committee No. 12], Proceedings of Wednesday, 9 May 1979&lt;/ref&gt;.
:15 May – A 'Prosecutors' Summit Meeting' confirms that "Pursuit of politicians' criminal liability will be abandoned&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=Roy|title=Japan: The Blighted Blossom|date=1989|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9781850431251|page=54|url=https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=Cbs1r8gHR4IC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;dq=Douglas+Grumman+scandal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=txVdZ7ahjz&amp;sig=v7-aoKbS-S7RWZH-_ObZzaSD6KQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj8r_f61JPWAhVEbVAKHTgEAJg4ChDoAQg3MAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Douglas%20Grumman%20scandal&amp;f=false|accessdate=7 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of the [[statute of limitations]] and restrictions on our authority", thus ending the Douglas-Grumman scandal investigation. Only three Nisshō Iwai officials were ever charged.
:24 May – Matsuno is questioned by the House of Representatives Special Committee on Aircraft Import Investigations. Matsuno acknowledges that he received 500 million yen, but argued that the 500&amp;nbsp;million yen was a political donation from Nisshō Iwai&lt;ref name="Welfield"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Welfield|first1=John|title=An Empire in Eclipse: Japan in the Post-war American Alliance System: A Study in the Interraction of Domestic Politics and Foreign Policy|date=2013|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9781780939957|pages=440-441|url=https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=U6sVAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA440&amp;lpg=PA440&amp;dq=arimori+kunio+%22Nissho+Iwai%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WzHHDctXF0&amp;sig=b6zaBojbxe83c8TuK7FgrzXhpUA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjMkPbmnZPWAhWF1RQKHcAEBkkQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=arimori%20kunio%20%22Nissho%20Iwai%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=7 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, rejecting the prosecution and opposition parties' claim that it was funds linked to the F-4E purchase.

:28 May – Matsuno is summoned as a witness by the upper house special committee on aircraft imports. After that, the opposition parties tried to submit a resolution on Matsuno's perjury, but this was rejected by the LDP and the Diet is again left in limbo. When the House of Councilors closes, all the bills under deliberation are dismissed, incomplete.
:11 July – Kaifu and [[Kazuo Hidaka]], former aircraft department manager at [[Sumitomo Corporation]], are questioned by the Special Committee on Aircraft Imports regarding the E-2C introduction. Being questioned after arrest and prosecution as with Kaifu in this case is quite rare. Kaifu states that Matsuno was paid 500 million yen as a reward for the F-4 purchase.

; 1980
:24 July – Kaifu is sentenced to 2 years' imprisonment, deferred for 3 years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nissho Iwai Vice President Arrested in Douglas-Grumman Scandal|url=http://jijiphoto.photoshelter.com/image/I0000H8XCqB9NFBk|accessdate=7 September 2017|agency=Jiji Press|date=3 April 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;, by Tokyo District Court. Neither plaintiffs nor defendants appeal, and the sentence is confirmed on 7 August.

The '''Dunkirk evacuation''', code-named '''Operation Dynamo''', also known as the '''Miracle of Dunkirk''', was the evacuation of [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] soldiers during [[World War II]] from the beaches and harbour of [[Dunkirk]], in the north of France, between 26 May and 4 June 1940. The operation commenced after large numbers of Belgian, British, and French troops were cut off and surrounded by German troops during the six-week long [[Battle of France]]. In a speech to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] called this "a colossal military disaster", saying "the whole root and core and brain of the [[British Army]]" had been stranded at Dunkirk and seemed about to perish or be captured.{{sfn|Churchill|2003|p=212}} In his "[[we shall fight on the beaches]]" speech on 4 June, he hailed their rescue as a "miracle of deliverance".{{sfn|Safire|2004|p=146}}

After [[Nazi Germany]] [[invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]] in September 1939, France and the [[British Empire]] declared war on Germany and imposed an [[Blockade of Germany (1939-45)|economic blockade]]. The [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) was sent to help defend France. After the [[Phoney War]] of October 1939 to April 1940, Germany invaded [[Battle of Belgium|Belgium]], [[Battle of the Netherlands|the Netherlands]], and [[Battle of France|France]] on 10 May 1940. Three of their [[panzer corps]] attacked through the [[Ardennes]] and drove northwest to the [[English Channel]]. By 21 May German forces had trapped the BEF, the remains of the Belgian forces, and three French [[field army|field armies]] along the northern coast of France. Commander of the BEF, [[General (British Army)|General]] [[John Vereker, 6th Viscount Gort|Viscount Gort]], immediately saw evacuation across the Channel as the best course of action, and began planning a withdrawal to Dunkirk, the closest good port.

Late on 23 May, a halt order was issued by ''[[Generaloberst]]'' [[Gerd von Rundstedt]], commander of [[Army Group A]]. [[Adolf Hitler]] approved the order the next day and had the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|German High Command]] send confirmation to the front. Destroying the trapped BEF, French, and Belgian armies was left to the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' until the order was rescinded on 26 May. This gave trapped Allied forces time to construct defensive works and pull back large numbers of troops to fight the [[Battle of Dunkirk]]. From 28 to 31 May, in the [[Siege of Lille (1940)|Siege of Lille]], the remaining 40,000 men of the once-formidable French First Army fought a delaying action against seven German [[Division (military)|divisions]], including three [[Panzer division|armoured divisions]].

On the first day only 7,669 Allied soldiers were evacuated, but by the end of the eighth day, 338,226 of them had been rescued by a hastily assembled fleet of over 800 boats. Many troops were able to embark from the harbour's protective [[mole (architecture)|mole]] onto 39 British [[Royal Navy]] [[destroyer]]s, four [[Royal Canadian Navy]] destroyers,{{sfn|McIntyre|2017}} and a variety of civilian merchant ships, while others had to wade out from the beaches, waiting for hours in shoulder-deep water. Some were ferried to the larger ships by what came to be known as the [[Little Ships of Dunkirk|little ships of Dunkirk]], a [[flotilla]] of hundreds of [[merchant marine]] boats, [[fishing boat]]s, [[pleasure craft]], [[yacht]]s, and [[Lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboats]] called into service from Britain. The BEF lost 68,000 soldiers during the French campaign and had to abandon nearly all of its tanks, vehicles, and equipment. In his speech to the [[House of Commons]] on 4 June, Churchill reminded the country that "we must be very careful not to assign to this deliverance the attributes of a victory. Wars are not won by evacuations."{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=115}}

==Background==
{{further|Battle of France}}
In September 1939, after [[Nazi Germany]] [[invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]], the United Kingdom sent the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) to aid in the defence of France, landing at [[Cherbourg]], [[Nantes]], and [[Saint-Nazaire]]. By May 1940 the force consisted of ten [[Division (military)|divisions]] in three [[corps]] under the command of General [[John Vereker, 6th Viscount Gort]].{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=9}}{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=7}} Working with the BEF were the [[Belgian Armed Forces|Belgian Army]] and the French [[First Army (France)|First]], [[Seventh Army (France)|Seventh]], and [[Ninth Army (France)|Ninth]] Armies.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=305}}

[[File:16May-21May Battle of Belgium.PNG|thumb|Situation on 21 May 1940; German forces occupy the area shaded in pink]]

During the 1930s, the French had constructed the [[Maginot Line]], a series of fortifications along their border with Germany. This line had been designed to deter a German invasion across the Franco-German border and funnel an attack into Belgium, which could then be met by the best divisions of the [[French Army]]. Thus, any future war would take place outside of French territory, [[Zone rouge|avoiding a repeat]] of the [[First World War]].{{sfn|Jackson|2003|p=33}}{{sfn|Roth|2010|p=6}} The area immediately to the north of the Maginot Line was covered by the heavily wooded [[Ardennes]] region,{{sfn|Kaufmann|Kaufmann|2007|p=23}} which French General [[Philippe Pétain]] declared to be "impenetrable" as long as "special provisions" were taken. He believed that any enemy force emerging from the forest would be vulnerable to a [[Pincer movement|pincer attack]] and destroyed. The French commander-in-chief, [[Maurice Gamelin]], also believed the area to be of a limited threat, noting that it "never favoured large operations".{{sfn|Jackson|2003|p=32}} With this in mind, the area was left lightly defended.{{sfn|Jackson|2003|p=33}}

The initial plan for the German [[battle of France|invasion of France]] called for an encirclement attack through the Netherlands and Belgium, avoiding the Maginot Line.{{sfn|Melvin|2010|p=140}} [[Erich von Manstein]], then Chief of Staff of the German [[Army Group A]], prepared the outline of a different plan and submitted it to the [[OKH]] (German High Command) via his superior, ''[[Generaloberst]]'' [[Gerd von Rundstedt]].{{sfn|Lemay|2010|pp=98–102}}{{sfn|Forczyk|2010|pp=11–14}} Manstein's plan suggested that Panzer divisions should attack through the Ardennes, then establish [[bridgehead]]s on the [[Meuse River]] and rapidly drive to the English Channel. The Germans would thus cut off the [[Allies of World War II|Allied armies]] in Belgium. This part of the plan later became known as the ''Sichelschnitt'' ("sickle cut").{{sfn|Forczyk|2010|pp=11–14}}{{sfn|Melvin|2010|p=145}} [[Adolf Hitler]] approved a modified version of Manstein's ideas, today known as the [[Manstein Plan]], after meeting with him on 17 February.{{sfn|Melvin|2010|p=132}}

On 10 May, Germany [[Battle of Belgium|invaded Belgium]] and [[Battle of the Netherlands|the Netherlands]].{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=713}} [[Army Group B]], under ''Generaloberst'' [[Fedor von Bock]], attacked into Belgium, while the three Panzer corps of Army Group A under Rundstedt swung around to the south and drove for the Channel.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=37}} The BEF advanced from the Belgian border to positions along the [[River Dyle]] within Belgium, where they fought elements of Army Group B starting on 10 May.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=26}}{{sfn|Churchill|1949|loc=Map, p. 33}} They were ordered to begin a fighting withdrawal to the [[Scheldt River]] on 14 May when the Belgian and French positions on their flanks failed to hold.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|pp=74–75}} During a visit to Paris on 17 May, Prime Minister Winston Churchill was astonished to learn from Gamelin that the French had committed all their troops to the ongoing engagements and had no strategic reserves.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=47}} On 19 May, Gort met with French General [[Gaston Billotte]], commander of the French First Army and overall coordinator of the Allied forces. Billotte revealed that the French had no troops between the Germans and the sea. Gort immediately saw that evacuation across the Channel was the best course of action, and began planning a withdrawal to Dunkirk, the closest location with good port facilities.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|pp=64–65}} Surrounded by marshes, Dunkirk boasted old fortifications and the longest sand beach in Europe, where large groups could assemble.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=123}} On 20 May, on Churchill's suggestion, the Admiralty began arranging for all available small vessels to be made ready to proceed to France.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|pp=58–59}} After continued engagements and a failed Allied attempt on 21 May at [[Battle of Arras (1940)|Arras]] to cut through the German spearhead,{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=98}} the BEF was trapped, along with the remains of the Belgian forces and the three French armies, in an area along the coast of northern France and Belgium.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=728}}{{sfn|Thompson|2011|loc=Map, p. 61}}

==Prelude==
[[File:Gort and Blount at Arras WWII IWM O 177.jpg|thumb|[[Lord Gort]] (gesturing, at centre) was commander of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]].]]
Without informing the French, the British began planning on 20 May for Operation Dynamo, the evacuation of the BEF.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=123}}{{sfn|Churchill|1949|pp=58–59}} This planning was headed by [[Vice Admiral]] [[Bertram Ramsay]] at the naval headquarters below [[Dover Castle]], from which he briefed Churchill as it was under way.{{sfn|Lord|1983|pp=43–44}} Ships began gathering at Dover for the evacuation.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=100}} On 20 May, the BEF sent Brigadier Gerald Whitfield to Dunkirk to start evacuating unnecessary personnel. Overwhelmed by what he later described as "a somewhat alarming movement towards Dunkirk by both officers and men", due to a shortage of food and water, he had to send many along without thoroughly checking their credentials. Even officers ordered to stay behind to aid the evacuation disappeared onto the boats.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=124}}

On 22 May, Churchill ordered the BEF to attack southward in co-ordination with the French First Army under General [[Georges Maurice Jean Blanchard|Georges Blanchard]] to reconnect with the remainder of the French forces.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=65}} This proposed action was dubbed the Weygand Plan after General [[Maxime Weygand]], appointed Supreme Commander after Gamelin's dismissal on 18 May.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=57}} On 25 May, Gort had to abandon any hope of achieving this objective and withdrew on his own initiative, along with Blanchard's forces behind the Lys Canal, part of a canal system that reached the sea at [[Gravelines]].{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=84}} Sluice gates had already been opened all along the canal to flood the system and create a barrier (the Canal Line) against the German advance.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|pp=78–79}}

===Battle of Dunkirk===
{{Main|Battle of Dunkirk}}
[[File:Dunkirksoldier1.JPG|left|thumb|Soldiers were [[strafe]]d and bombed by German aircraft while awaiting transport.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|loc=Footnote, p. 736}}]]
By 24 May, the Germans had captured the port of Boulogne and surrounded Calais.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=728}} The engineers of the 2nd Panzer Division under ''[[Generalmajor]]'' [[Rudolf Veiel]] built five bridges over the Canal Line and only one British battalion barred the way to Dunkirk.{{sfn|Lemay|2010|p=152}} On 23 May, at the suggestion of [[4th Army (Wehrmacht)|Fourth Army]] commander ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' [[Günther von Kluge]], Rundstedt had ordered the panzer units to halt, concerned about the vulnerability of his flanks and the question of supply to his forward troops.{{sfn|Noakes|Pridham|1988|p=167}}{{sfn|Army Group A War Diary}}{{sfn|OKW Jodl Diary}}{{sfn|Lord|1983|pp=28–35}} He was also concerned that the marshy ground around Dunkirk would prove unsuitable for tanks and he wished to conserve them for later operations (in some units, tank losses were 30–50 percent).{{sfn|Cooper|1978| pp=230–31}}{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=120}} Hitler was also apprehensive, and on a visit to Army Group A headquarters on 24 May, he endorsed the order.{{sfn|Cooper|1978| pp=230–31}}{{sfn|Lord|1983|pp=28–35}}

Air Marshal [[Hermann Göring]] urged Hitler to let the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' (aided by Army Group B{{sfn|Lemay|2010|p=150}}) finish off the British, to the consternation of General [[Franz Halder]], who noted in his diary that the ''Luftwaffe'' was dependent upon the weather and air crews were worn out after two weeks of battle.{{sfn|Noakes|Pridham|1988|pp=167–68}} Rundstedt issued another order, which was sent uncoded. It was picked up by the RAF Y service at 12:42: "By order of the Fuhrer&amp;nbsp;... attack north-west of Arras is to be limited to the general line Lens–Bethune–Aire–St Omer–Gravelines. The Canal will not be crossed."{{sfn|Costello|1991|p=175}}{{sfn|Hinsley|1994|p=31}} Later that day, Hitler issued Directive 13, which called for the ''Luftwaffe'' to defeat the trapped Allied forces and stop their escape.{{sfn|Cooper|1978|p=232}} At 15:30 on 26 May, Hitler ordered the panzer groups to continue their advance, but most units took another 16 hours to attack.{{sfn|Cooper|1978|p=235}} The delay gave the Allies time to prepare defences vital for the evacuation and prevented the Germans from stopping the Allied retreat from Lille.{{sfn|Noakes|Pridham|1988|p=168}}

The halt order has been the subject of much discussion by historians.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=76}}{{sfn|Lemay|2010|p=149}} Guderian considered the failure to order a timely assault on Dunkirk to be one of the major German mistakes on the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]].{{sfn|Guderian|2001|loc=Footnote, p. 117}} Rundstedt called it "one of the great turning points of the war",{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=731}} and Manstein described it as "one of Hitler's most critical mistakes".{{sfn|Lemay|2010|p=153}} [[B. H. Liddell Hart]] interviewed many of the generals after the war and put together a picture of Hitler's strategic thinking on the matter. Hitler believed that once Britain's troops left continental Europe, they would never return.{{sfn|Hart|1948}}{{page needed|date=July 2015}}

==Evacuation==
===26–27 May===
The retreat was undertaken amid chaotic conditions, with abandoned vehicles blocking the roads and a flood of refugees heading in the opposite direction.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=145}}{{sfn|Thompson|2011|pp=59, 75}} Due to wartime censorship and the desire to keep up British morale, the full extent of the unfolding disaster at Dunkirk was not initially publicised. A special service attended by [[King George VI]] was held in [[Westminster Abbey]] on 26 May, which was declared a national day of prayer.{{sfn|Miller|1997|p=83}}{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=122}} The [[Cosmo Gordon Lang|Archbishop of Canterbury]] led prayers "for our soldiers in dire peril in France". Similar prayers were offered in synagogues and churches throughout the UK that day, confirming to the public their suspicion of the desperate plight of the troops.{{sfn|Gelb|1990|p=82}} Just before 19:00 on 26 May, Churchill ordered Dynamo to begin, by which time 28,000 men had already departed.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=123}} Initial plans called for the recovery of 45,000 men from the BEF within two days, at which time German troops were expected to block further evacuation. Only 25,000 men escaped during this period, including 7,669 on the first day.{{sfn|Liddell Hart|1999|p=78}}{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=306}}

[[File:Wounded British soldiers evacuated from Dunkirk make their way up the gangplank from a destroyer at Dover, 31 May 1940. H1623.jpg|thumb|Troops evacuated from Dunkirk arrive at Dover, 31 May 1940.]]
On 27 May, the first full day of the evacuation, one [[cruiser]], eight [[destroyer]]s, and 26 other craft were active.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=106}} Admiralty officers combed nearby boatyards for small craft that could ferry personnel from the beaches out to larger craft in the harbour, as well as larger vessels that could load from the docks. An emergency call was put out for additional help, and by 31 May nearly four hundred small craft were voluntarily and enthusiastically taking part in the effort.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|pp=100–01}}

The same day, the ''Luftwaffe'' heavily bombed Dunkirk, both the town and the dock installations. As the water supply was knocked out, the resulting fires could not be extinguished.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=149}} An estimated thousand civilians were killed, one-third of the remaining population of the town.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=150}} The ''Luftwaffe'' was met by 16 squadrons of the [[Royal Air Force]], who claimed 38 kills on 27 May while losing 14 aircraft.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=149}}{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=228}} Many more RAF fighters sustained damage and were subsequently written off. [[KG 2]] and [[KG 3]] suffered the heaviest casualties. German losses amounted to 23 [[Dornier Do 17]]s. [[KG 1]] and [[KG 4]] bombed the beach and harbour and [[KG 54]] sank the 8,000-ton steamer ''Aden''. [[Junkers Ju 87]] ''stuka'' dive bombers sank the troopship ''Cote d' Azur''. The ''Luftwaffe'' engaged with 300 bombers which were protected by 550 fighter sorties, and attacked Dunkirk in twelve raids. They dropped 15,000 [[high explosive]] and 30,000 [[Incendiary device|incendiary bombs]], destroying the oil tanks and wrecking the harbour.{{sfn|Jackson|1974|pp=116–117}} [[No. 11 Group RAF]] flew 22 patrols with 287 aircraft this day, in formations of up to 20 aircraft.{{sfn|Jackson|1974|p=117}}

Altogether, over 3,500 sorties were flown in support of Operation Dynamo.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=228}} The RAF continued to take a heavy toll on the German bombers throughout the week. Soldiers being bombed and [[strafe]]d while awaiting transport were for the most part unaware of the efforts of the RAF to protect them, as most of the dogfights took place far from the beaches. As a result, many British soldiers bitterly accused the airmen of doing nothing to help.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|loc=Footnote, p. 736}}

On 25 and 26 May, the ''Luftwaffe'' focused their attention on Allied pockets holding out at Calais, [[Lille]], and [[Amiens]], and did not attack Dunkirk.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=150}} Calais, held by the BEF, surrendered on 26 May.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=119}} Remnants of the French First Army, [[Siege of Lille (1940)|surrounded at Lille]], fought off seven German divisions (several of them armoured) until 31 May, when the remaining 35,000 soldiers were forced to surrender after running out of food and ammunition.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=97}}{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=144}} The Germans accorded the [[honours of war]] to the defenders of Lille in recognition of their bravery.{{sfn|Fermer|2013|p=208}}

===28 May – 4 June===
[[File:21May-4June1940-Fall Gelb.svg|thumb|Situation on 4 June 1940; the remaining French rearguard held a tiny sliver of land around Dunkirk]]
The Belgian Army surrendered on 28 May,{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=729}} leaving a large gap to the east of Dunkirk. Several British divisions were rushed in to cover that side.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=96}} The ''Luftwaffe'' flew fewer sorties over Dunkirk on 28th. German attention switched to the Belgian ports [[Ostend]] and [[Nieuport]]. The weather over Dunkirk was not conducive to dive or low-level bombing. The RAF flew 11 patrols and 321 sorties claiming 23 destroyed with the loss of 13 aircraft.{{sfn|Jackson|1974|p=117}} On 28 May, 17,804 soldiers arrived at British ports.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=306}}

On 29 May, 47,310 British troops were rescued{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=306}} as the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s Ju 87s exacted a heavy toll on shipping. The British destroyer [[HMS Grenade (H86)|HMS ''Grenade'']] was sunk and the [[French destroyer Mistral|French destroyer ''Mistral'']] was crippled while her sister ships, each laden with 500 men, were damaged by near misses. British destroyers [[HMS Jaguar (F34)|''Jaguar'']] and [[HMS Verity (D63)|''Verity'']] were badly damaged but escaped the harbour. Two trawlers disintegrated in the attack. Later, the passenger steamer ''[[SS Fenella (1936)|SS Fenella]]'' sank with 600 men aboard at the pier but the men were able to get off. A fourth, ''Crested Eagle'', suffered a direct hit, caught fire, and sank with severe casualties. The raiders also destroyed the two rail-owned ships, the ''[[SS Lorina (1918)|SS Lorina]]'' and the ''[[SS Normannia (1911)|SS Normannia]]''.{{sfn|Smith|2011|p=138}} Of the five major German attacks, just two were contested by RAF fighters; the British lost 16 fighters in nine patrols. German losses amounted to 11 Ju 87s destroyed or damaged.{{sfn|Jackson|1974|p=118}}

On 30 May, Churchill received word that all British divisions were now behind the defensive lines, along with more than half of the French First Army.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=97}} By this time, the perimeter ran along a series of canals about {{convert|7|mi}} from the coast, in marshy country not suitable for tanks.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=226}} With the docks in the harbour rendered unusable by German air attacks, senior naval officer Captain (later Admiral) [[William Tennant (Royal Navy officer)|William Tennant]] initially ordered men to be evacuated from the beaches. When this proved too slow, he re-routed the evacuees to two long stone and concrete breakwaters, called the East and West Mole, as well as the beaches. Almost 200,000 troops embarked on ships from the East Mole (which stretched nearly a mile out to sea) over the next week.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|pp=150–51}} Once more, low cloud had prohibited German air operations and kept the ''Luftwaffe'' activity to a minimum. Nine RAF patrols were mounted, with no German formation encountered.{{sfn|Jackson|1974|p=119}} The following day the ''Luftwaffe'' sank one transport and damaged 12 others for 17 losses; the  British claimed 38 kills, which may have been an exaggeration. The RAF and [[Fleet Air Arm]] lost 28 aircraft.{{sfn|Jackson|1974|p=119}}

Of the total 338,226 soldiers, several hundred were unarmed Indian [[arriero|mule handlers]] on detachment from the [[Royal Indian Army Service Corps]], forming four of the six units of Force K-6 transport. Cypriot muleteers were also present. Three units were successfully evacuated and one captured.{{sfn|Dunkirk 1940.org}}{{sfn|Bajwa|2013}}{{sfn|Gojkovic|2017}}  Also present at Dunkirk were a small number of French Senegalese soldiers and Moroccans.{{sfn|Shephard|2003|p=169}}{{sfn|Richardson|2010|p=32}}

The next day, an additional 53,823 men were embarked,{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=115}} including the first French soldiers.{{sfn|Murray|Millett|2000|p=80}} Lord Gort and 68,014 men were evacuated on 31 May,{{sfn|Keegan|1989|p=81}} leaving Major-General [[Harold Alexander]] in command of the rearguard.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=109}} A further 64,429 Allied soldiers departed on 1 June,{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=306}} before the increasing air attacks prevented further daylight evacuation.{{sfn|Liddell Hart|1999|p=79}} The British rearguard of 4,000 men left on the night of 2–3 June.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=737}} An additional 75,000 French troops were retrieved over the nights of 2–4 June,{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=306}}{{sfn|Liddell Hart|1999|p=80}} before the operation finally ended. The remainder of the rearguard, 40,000 French troops, surrendered on 4 June.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=737}} Churchill made a point of stating in his ''[[We shall fight on the beaches]]'' address in the House on 4 June, that the evacuation had been made possible through the efforts of the RAF.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|loc=Footnote, p. 736}}

===Evacuation routes===

[[File:Dunkirk Evacuation shipping routes.png|thumb|Map of the three evacuation routes]]
[[File:The Evacuation From Dunkirk, May - June 1940 H1647.jpg|thumb|Evacuated troops arrive in Dover]]
Three routes were allocated to the evacuating vessels. The shortest was Route Z, a distance of {{convert|39|nmi|km}}, but it entailed hugging the French coast and thus ships using it were subject to bombardment from on-shore batteries, particularly in daylight hours.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|loc=Map, p. 223}}{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=166}} Route X, although the safest from shore batteries, travelled through a particularly heavily mined portion of the Channel. Ships on this route travelled {{convert|55|nmi|km}} north out of Dunkirk, proceeded through the Ruytingen Pass,{{sfn|Gardner|1949|p=20}} and headed towards the North Goodwin Lightship before heading south around the [[Goodwin Sands]] to Dover.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|loc=Map, p. 223}}{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=166}} The route was safest from surface attacks, but the nearby minefields and sand banks meant it could not be used at night.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=224}} The longest of the three was Route Y, a distance of {{convert|87|nmi|km}}; using this route increased the sailing time to four hours, double the time required for Route Z. This route followed the French coast as far as [[Bray-Dunes]], then turned north-east until reaching the Kwinte Buoy.{{sfn|Dildy|2010|p=50}} Here, after making an approximately 135-degree turn, the ships sailed west to the North Goodwin Lightship and headed south around the Goodwin Sands to Dover.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|loc=Map, p. 223}}{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=166}} Ships on Route Y were the most likely to be attacked by German surface vessels, submarines, and the ''Luftwaffe''.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=222}}

{{Quote|You knew this was the chance to get home and you kept praying, please God, let us go, get us out, get us out of this mess back to England. To see that ship that came in to pick me and my brother up, it was a most fantastic sight. We saw dog fights up in the air, hoping nothing would happen to us and we saw one or two terrible sights. Then somebody said, there’s Dover, that was when we saw the [[White Cliffs of Dover|White Cliffs]], the atmosphere was terrific. From hell to heaven was how the feeling was, you felt like a miracle had happened.|Harry Garrett, British Army, speaking to [[KM Group|Kent Online]]{{sfn|Chessum|2014}} }}

The [[Royal Navy]] provided the anti-aircraft cruiser [[HMS Calcutta (D82)|HMS ''Calcutta'']], 39 destroyers, and many other craft. The [[Merchant Navy (United Kingdom)|Merchant Navy]] supplied passenger ferries, hospital ships, and other vessels. Britain's Belgian, Dutch, Canadian,{{sfn|McIntyre|2017}} and French allies provided vessels as well. Admiral Ramsay arranged for around a thousand copies to be made of the required charts, had buoys laid around the Goodwin Sands and down to Dunkirk, and organised the flow of shipping.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=224}} Larger ships such as destroyers were able to carry about 900 men per trip. The soldiers mostly travelled on the upper decks for fear of being trapped below if the ship sank.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=229}} After the loss on 29 May of 19 British and [[French navy]] ships plus three of the larger requisitioned vessels, the Admiralty withdrew their eight best destroyers for the future defence of the country.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=174}}

===Little ships===
{{Main|Little Ships of Dunkirk}}
{{see also|Royal National Lifeboat Institution}}

A wide variety of small vessels from all over the south of England were pressed into service to aid in the Dunkirk evacuation. They included speedboats, [[Thames]] vessels, car ferries, [[pleasure craft]], and many other types of small craft.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=234}} The most useful proved to be the motor [[Lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboats]], which had a reasonably good capacity and speed.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=234}} Some boats were requisitioned without the owner's knowledge or consent. Agents of the [[Minister of Shipping|Ministry of Shipping]], accompanied by a naval officer, scoured the Thames for likely looking vessels, had them checked for seaworthiness, and took them downriver to [[Sheerness]], where naval crews were to be placed aboard. Due to shortages of personnel, many small craft crossed the Channel with civilian crews.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=198}}

The first of the "little ships" arrived at Dunkirk on 28 May.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=229}} The wide sand beaches meant that large vessels could not get anywhere near the shore, and even small craft had to stop about {{convert|100|yd|m}} from the waterline and wait for the soldiers to wade out.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=225}} In many cases, personnel would abandon their boat upon reaching a larger ship, and subsequent evacuees had to wait for boats to drift ashore with the tide before they could make use of them.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=199}} In most areas on the beaches, soldiers queued up with their units and patiently awaited their turn to leave. But at times, panicky soldiers had to be warned off at gunpoint when they attempted to rush to the boats out of turn.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|pp=167–68}} In addition to ferrying out on boats, soldiers at [[De Panne]] and Bray-Dunes constructed improvised jetties by driving rows of abandoned vehicles onto the beach at low tide, anchoring them with sandbags, and connecting them with wooden walkways.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|pp=214–15}}

Before the operation was completed, the prognosis had been gloomy, with Churchill warning the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on 28 May to expect "hard and heavy tidings".{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=99}} Subsequently, Churchill referred to the outcome as a "miracle", and the British press presented the evacuation as a "disaster turned to triumph" so successfully, that Churchill had to remind the country, in a speech to the House of Commons on 4 June, that "we must be very careful not to assign to this deliverance the attributes of a victory. Wars are not won by evacuations."{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=115}}

Three British divisions and a host of logistic and labour troops were cut off to the south of the Somme by the German "race to the sea". At the end of May, a further two divisions began moving to France with the hope of establishing a [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)#The Second BEF and Operation Ariel|Second BEF]]. The majority of the [[51st (Highland) Division]] was forced to surrender on 12 June, but almost 192,000 Allied personnel, 144,000 of them British, were evacuated through various French ports from 15–25 June under the codename [[Operation Ariel]].{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=296–305}} The Germans marched into [[Paris]] on 14 June and France surrendered eight days later.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|pp=232–34}}

The more than 100,000 French troops evacuated from Dunkirk were quickly and efficiently shuttled to camps in various parts of south-western England, where they were temporarily lodged before being repatriated.{{sfn|Looseley|2005|p=}} British ships ferried French troops to [[Brest, France|Brest]], [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]], and other ports in [[Normandy]] and [[Brittany]], although only about half of the repatriated troops were redeployed against the Germans before the surrender of France. For many French soldiers, the Dunkirk evacuation represented only a few weeks' delay before being killed or captured by the German army after their return to France.{{sfn|Mordal|1968|p=496}} Of the French soldiers evacuated from France in June 1940, about 3,000 joined [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s [[Free French]] army in Britain.{{sfn|Nadeau|Barlow|2003|p=89}}

In France, the unilateral British decision to evacuate through Dunkirk rather than counter-attack to the south, and the perceived preference of the Royal Navy for evacuating British forces at the expense of the French, led to some bitter resentment. According to Churchill, French Admiral [[François Darlan]] originally ordered that the British forces should receive preference, but on 31 May, he intervened at a meeting in Paris to order that the evacuation should proceed on equal terms and that the British would form the rearguard.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=111}} In fact, the 35,000 men who finally surrendered after covering the final evacuations were mostly French soldiers of [[2nd Light Mechanized Division (France)|2nd Light Mechanized Division]] and the [[68th Infantry Division (France)|68th Infantry Division]].{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=219}}{{sfn|Stewart|2008|p=115}} Their resistance allowed the evacuation effort to be extended to 4 June, on which date another 26,175 Frenchmen were transported to England.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=306}}

The evacuation was presented to the German public as an overwhelming and decisive German victory. On 5 June 1940, Hitler stated "Dunkirk has fallen! 40,000 French and English troops are all that remains of the formerly great armies. Immeasurable quantities of material have been captured. The greatest battle in the history of the world has come to an end."{{efn|Original German: "Dünkirchen ist gefallen! 40 000 Franzosen und Engländer sind als letzter Rest einstiger großer Armeen gefangen. Unübersehbares Material wurde erbeutet. Damit ist die größte Schlacht der Weltgeschichte beendet."}}{{sfn|Hitler|1940|nopp=y}} ''[[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]]'' (OKW, the German armed forces high command) announced the event as "the greatest annihilation battle of all time".{{sfn|OKW|1940|nopp=y}}

===Casualties===
[[File:Wounded French soldier after evacuation from Dunkirk.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|A wounded French soldier being taken ashore on a stretcher at [[Dover]] after evacuation from Dunkirk]]
The BEF lost 68,000 soldiers (dead, wounded, missing, or captured) from 10 May until the [[Second Armistice at Compiègne|armistice with France]] on 22 June.{{sfn|Lemay|2010|p=151}} 3,500 British were killed{{sfn|French|2002|p=156}} and 13,053 wounded.{{sfn|Blaxland|1973|p=346}} All the heavy equipment had to be abandoned. Left behind in France were 2,472 guns, 20,000 motorcycles, and almost 65,000 other vehicles; also abandoned were {{convert|416000|ST|t|lk=on|abbr=on}} of stores, more than {{convert|75000|ST|t|abbr=on}} of ammunition and {{convert|162000|ST|t|abbr=on}} of fuel.{{sfn|Longden|2009|p=11}} Almost all of the 445 British tanks that had been sent to France with the BEF were abandoned.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=300}}

[[File:Dunkirk 1940 HU1145.jpg|thumb|[[Isle of Man Steam Packet Company]] vessel [[Mona's Queen (1934)|''Mona's Queen'']] shortly after striking a mine on the approach to Dunkirk. 29 May 1940]]
Six British and three French destroyers were sunk, along with nine other major vessels. In addition, 19 destroyers were damaged.{{sfn|Murray|Millett|2000|p=81}} Over 200 British and Allied sea craft were sunk, with a similar number damaged.{{sfn|Holmes|2001|p=267}} The Royal Navy's most significant losses in the operation were six destroyers:
* {{HMS|Grafton|H89|2}}, sunk by {{Ship|German submarine|U-62|1939|2}} on 29 May{{sfn|English|1993|p=98}}
* {{HMS|Grenade|H86|2}}, sunk by air attack at Dunkirk on 29 May{{sfn|English|1993|p=99}}
* {{HMS|Wakeful|H88|2}}, sunk by a [[torpedo]] from the [[E-boat]] ''S-30'' on 29 May{{sfn|Atkin|1990|pp=170–71}}
* {{HMS|Basilisk|H11|2}}, {{HMS|Havant|H32|2}}, and {{HMS|Keith|D06|2}}, sunk by air attack off the beaches on 1 June{{sfn|Atkin|1990|pp=204–05}}

The [[French Navy]] lost three destroyers:
* {{Ship|French destroyer|Bourrasque||2}}, mined off [[Nieuwpoort, Belgium|Nieuport]] on 30 May
* {{Ship|French destroyer|Siroco||2}}, sunk by the [[E-boat]]s ''S-23'' and ''S-26'' on 31 May
* [[French destroyer Foudroyant (1929)|''Le Foudroyant'']], sunk by air attack off the beaches on 1 June

The RAF lost 145 aircraft, of which at least 42 were [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfires]], while the ''Luftwaffe'' lost 156 aircraft in operations in the nine days of Operation Dynamo,{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=206}} including 35 destroyed by Royal Navy ships (plus 21 damaged) during the six days from 27 May to 1 June.{{sfn|Ramsey|1947|loc=Appendix III}}

For every seven soldiers who escaped through Dunkirk, one man was left behind as a [[prisoner of war]]. The majority of these prisoners were sent on forced marches into Germany. Prisoners reported brutal treatment by their guards, including beatings, starvation, and murder. Another complaint was that German guards kicked over buckets of water that had been left at the roadside by French civilians for the marching prisoners to drink.{{sfn|Longden|2009|p=361}}

Many of the prisoners were marched to the city of [[Trier]], with the march taking as long as 20 days. Others were marched to the river [[Scheldt]] and were sent by barge to the [[Ruhr]]. The prisoners were then sent by rail to prisoner of war camps in Germany.{{sfn|Longden|2009|pp=383–404}} The majority (those below the rank of corporal) then worked in German industry and agriculture for the remainder of the war.{{sfn|Longden|2005|p=260}}

The missing dead of the BEF are commemorated on the [[Dunkirk Memorial]].

'''Everette Howard Hunt Jr.''' (October 9, 1918&amp;nbsp;– January 23, 2007), better known as '''E.&amp;nbsp;Howard Hunt''', was an American [[espionage|intelligence officer]] and published author of 73 books. From 1949 to 1970, Hunt served as an officer in the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA). Along with [[G. Gordon Liddy]] and others, Hunt was one of the [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|Nixon administration]] "[[White House Plumbers|plumbers]]", a team of operatives charged with identifying government sources of national security information "[[News leak|leaks]]" to outside parties. Hunt and Liddy plotted the Watergate burglaries and other clandestine operations for the Nixon administration. In the ensuing [[Watergate scandal]], Hunt was convicted of burglary, [[Conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy]], and [[Telephone tapping|wiretapping]], eventually serving 33 months in prison.

==Early life and career==
Hunt was born in [[Hamburg, New York]],&lt;ref name="The New York Times; January 24, 2007"&gt;{{cite news |last=Weiner |first=Tim |author-link=Tim Weiner |date=January 24, 2007 |title=E.

He graduated from [[Hamburg High School (Hamburg, New York)|Hamburg High School]] in 1936&lt;ref&gt;Szulc, ''Compulsive Spy'', p 56.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Brown University]] in 1940. During [[World War II]], Hunt served in the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] on the destroyer [[USS Mayo (DD-422)|USS ''Mayo'']], the [[United States Army Air Corps]], and finally, the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS) in China.&lt;ref name=Hedegaard&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hedegaard |first=Erik |title=The Last Confessions of E.

==Author==
Hunt was a prolific author.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookfinder.com/author/e-howard-hunt/ Bookfinder.com. (February 5, 2013)]&lt;/ref&gt; During and after the war, he wrote several novels under his own name, including ''East of Farewell'' (1942), ''Limit of Darkness'' (1944), ''Stranger in Town'' (1947), ''Bimini Run'' (1949), and ''The Violent Ones'' (1950)&amp;nbsp;. He also wrote, more famously, several [[Spy fiction|spy]] and [[hardboiled]] novels under an array of pseudonyms, including '''Robert Dietrich''', '''Gordon Davis''' and '''David St. John'''. Hunt won a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] for his writing in 1946. Some of his writings found parallels in his espionage and Watergate experiences.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/weekinreview/28vinci.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==CIA and anti-Castro efforts==
[[Warner Bros.]] had just bought rights to Hunt's novel ''Bimini Run'' when he joined the CIA's Office of Policy Coordination (OPC) in October 1949 as a covert action officer specializing in political action and influence, in what later came to be called the CIA's [[Special Activities Division]].&lt;ref&gt;Safe For Democracy: The Secret Wars of the CIA, John Prados, 2006 page xxii&lt;/ref&gt; The CIA was the successor organization of the OSS.

According to [[David Talbot]], "Howard Hunt prided himself on being part of the CIA’s upper tier. But that’s not how he was viewed at the top of the agency. Hunt liked to brag that he had family connections to [[Wild Bill Donovan]] himself, who had admitted him into the OSS, the original roundtable of American intelligence. But it turned out that Hunt’s father was a lobbyist in upstate New York to whom Donovan owed a favor, not a fellow [[Wall Street]] lawyer. Everyone knew Hunt was a writer, but they also knew he was no [[Ian Fleming]]. To the [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]] set, there would always be something low-rent about men like Hunt—as well as [[William King Harvey|William Harvey]] and [[David Sánchez Morales|
David Morales]]. The CIA was a cold hierarchy. Men like this would never be invited for lunch with [[Allen Dulles]] at the [[Alibi Club]] or to play tennis with [[Richard Helms|Dick Helms]] at the Chevy Chase Club. These men were indispensable—until they became expendable."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.salon.com/2015/11/22/inside_the_plot_to_kill_jfk_the_secret_story_of_the_cia_and_what_really_happened_in_dallas/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico, Guatemala, Japan, Uruguay and Cuba===

Hunt became the OPC Station Chief in [[Mexico City]] in 1950, and recruited and supervised [[William F. Buckley Jr.]], who worked in Hunt's OPC Station in [[Mexico]] during the period 1951–1952. Buckley and Hunt remained lifelong friends and Buckley became godfather to Hunt's first three children.&lt;ref&gt;William F. Buckley Jr. (January 26, 2007), [http://www.uexpress.com/ontheright/index.html?uc_full_date=20070126 "Howard Hunt, RIP"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927010257/http://www.uexpress.com/ontheright/index.html?uc_full_date=20070126 |date=2007-09-27 }}. Buckley describes their early friendship in Mexico in his introduction to Hunt's posthumously-published memoir, ''American Spy''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Mexico, Hunt helped lay the framework for Operation PBFORTUNE, later renamed [[1954 Guatemalan coup d'état|Operation PBSUCCESS]], the successful covert operation to overthrow [[Jacobo Árbenz]], the democratic elected  president of [[Guatemala]]. Hunt was assigned as Chief of Covert Action in Japan. He afterwards served as Chief of Station in [[Uruguay]], (where he was noted by American diplomatic contemporary Samuel F. Hart for controversial working methods).&lt;ref&gt;Tim Weiner, ''Obituary: E. Howard Hunt, Agent Who Organized Botched Watergate Break-In, Dies at 88'', New York Times, 24 January 2007 [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/24/obituaries/24hunt.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Hunt was subsequently given the assignment of forging [[Cuban exile]] leaders in the United States into a broadly representative government-in-exile that would, after the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]], form a  pro-American [[Puppet state]] to take over [[Cuba]].&lt;ref&gt;Tad Szulc, ''Compulsive Spy: The Strange Career of E. Howard Hunt'' (New York: Viking, 1974), 78.&lt;/ref&gt; The failure of the invasion temporarily damaged his career.

Hunt was undeniably bitter about what he perceived as President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s lack of commitment in attacking and  overthrowing the [[government of Cuba]].&lt;ref name="rosenberg"&gt;Rosenberg, Carol (June 28, 2001). [http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/bay-of-pigs/howard-hunt.htm Plotter of Bay of Pigs, Watergate conspirator: 'File and forget' Castro.] ''[[Miami Herald]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In his semi-fictional autobiography, ''Give Us This Day'', he wrote: "The Kennedy administration yielded Castro all the excuse he needed to gain a tighter grip on the island of [[José Martí]], then moved shamefacedly into the shadows and hoped the Cuban issue would simply melt away."

===Executive Assistant to DCI Allen Dulles===

After the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion|Bay of Pigs]] fiasco, Hunt was reassigned as Executive Assistant to [[Director of Central Intelligence]] (DCI) Allen Dulles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/secclass/Hunt_11-3-78/html/Hunt_0054a.htm HSCA Deposition (November 3, 1978)], Part II, p. 6:10–17&lt;/ref&gt; While Hunt was working on [[Brigade 2506]], he helped Dulles write ''The Craft of Intelligence'' (1959).&lt;ref&gt;Szulc, ''Compulsive Spy'', 95&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other work &amp; association with G. Gordon Liddy===

After President John F. Kennedy fired Dulles in 1961 for the Bay of Pigs failure, Hunt served as the first Chief of Covert Action for the Domestic Operations Division (DODS) from 1962 to 1964.

Hunt told ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1974 that he spent about four years working for DODS, beginning shortly after it was set up by the [[Kennedy administration]] in 1962, over the "strenuous opposition" of Richard Helms and [[Thomas Karamessines|Thomas H. Karamessines]]. He said that the division was assembled shortly after the Bay of Pigs operation, and that "many men connected with that failure were shunted into the new domestic unit." He said that some of his projects from 1962 to 1966, which dealt largely with the subsidizing and manipulation of news and publishing organizations in the US, "did seem to violate the intent of the agency's charter."&lt;ref&gt;Seymour M. Hersh, "Hunt Tells of Early Work For a CIA Domestic Unit," New York Times (December 31, 1974), p. 1, col. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1964, DCI [[John A. McCone]] directed Hunt to take a special assignment as a [[Non-official cover|Non-Official Cover (NOC)]] officer in Madrid, Spain, tasked to create the American answer to [[Ian Fleming|Ian Fleming's]] [[Secret Intelligence Service|British MI-6]] [[James Bond]] novel series.  While assigned in Spain, Hunt was covered as a recently retired U.S. State Department [[Foreign Service Officer|Foreign Service Officer (FSO)]] who had moved his family to Spain in order to write the first installment of the 9-novel Peter Ward series, ''On Hazardous Duty'' (1965).

After a year and a half in Spain, Hunt returned to his assignment at DODS. Following a brief tenure on the Special Activities Staff of the Western European Division, he became Chief of Covert Action for the region (while remaining based in the Washington metropolitan area) in July 1968. Hunt was lauded for his "sagacity, balance and imagination", and received the second-highest rating of Strong (signifying "performance... characterized by exceptional proficiency") in a performance review from the Division's Chief of Operations in April 1969. However, this was downgraded to the third-highest rating of Adequate in an amendment from the Division's Deputy Chief, who recognized Hunt's "broad experience" but opined that "a series of personal and taxing problems" had "tended to dull his cutting edge."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/104-10194-10023.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Hunt would later maintain that he "had been stigmatized by the Bay of Pigs", and had come to terms with the fact that he "would not get promoted too much higher."&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=96UjNz1lBV4C&amp;pg=PA157&lt;/ref&gt;

In these final years of Hunt's CIA service, he began to cultivate new contacts in "society and the business world."&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; While serving as vice president of the Brown University Club of Washington, he befriended and commenced a strong association with the organization's president, former congressional aide [[Charles Colson]], who soon began working on Richard Nixon's presidential campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, ''Give Us This Day'', 13–14&lt;/ref&gt; Hunt retired from the CIA at the pay grade of [[General Schedule (US civil service pay scale)|GS-15]], Step 8&lt;ref name="privateintelligence.us"&gt;http://www.privateintelligence.us/dock/Jewels/E_Howard_Hunt_CIA_Internal_Paper.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; on April 30, 1970.

==White House service==
{{Watergate|White House}}
He went to work for the [[Robert Mullen Company|Robert R. Mullen Company]], which cooperated with the CIA; [[H. R. Haldeman]], White House Chief of Staff to President Nixon, wrote in 1978 that the Mullen Company was in fact a CIA front company, a fact that was apparently unknown to Haldeman while he worked in the White House.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''The Ends of Power'', by H. R. Haldeman with Joseph DiMona, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; Through CIA's Project [[QKENCHANT]], Hunt obtained a Covert Security Approval to handle the firm's affairs during Mullen's absence from Washington.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000904662.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = ARRB REQUEST: CIA-IR-06, QKENCHANT |publisher = Central Intelligence Agency |url = http://www.foia.cia.gov/browse_docs.asp?doc_no=0000904662&amp;no_pages=0005&amp;showPage=0001 |format = gif |date = 1996-05-14 |access-date = 2010-06-11 |page = 3 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120308121801/http://www.foia.cia.gov/browse_docs.asp?doc_no=0000904662&amp;no_pages=0005&amp;showPage=0001 |archivedate = 2012-03-08 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, he was hired as a consultant by [[Charles Colson]], now Special Counsel to President [[Richard Nixon]], and joined the [[White House Plumbers|White House Special Investigations Unit]].&lt;ref name=Hedegaard /&gt;

Having neglected to elect survivorship benefits for his wife upon retiring from the CIA, Hunt raised the possibility of returning to active duty for a short period of time in exchange for activating the benefits upon his proposed second retirement in a May 5, 1972 letter to CIA General Counsel Lawrence Houston. (An April 1971 request to retroactively amend his election was rebuffed by the agency.) However, Houston advised Hunt in his May 16 response that this "would be in violation of the spirit of the CIA Retirement Act".&lt;ref name="privateintelligence.us"/&gt;

==Watergate and related scandals==
{{Main|Watergate scandal}}

Hunt's first assignment for the White House was a covert operation to break into the Los Angeles office of [[Daniel Ellsberg]]'s [[psychiatrist]], Lewis J. Fielding.&lt;ref&gt;Szulc, ''Compulsive Spy'', 128&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1971, Fielding had refused a request from the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] for psychiatric data on Ellsberg.&lt;ref&gt;Szulc, ''Compulsive Spy'', 127&lt;/ref&gt; Hunt and Liddy cased the building in late August.&lt;ref&gt;Szulc, ''Compulsive Spy'', 130&lt;/ref&gt; The burglary, on September 3, 1971, was not detected, but no Ellsberg files were found.&lt;ref&gt;Szulc, ''Compulsive Spy'', 131&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in the summer of 1971, Colson authorized Hunt to travel to [[New England]] to seek potentially scandalous information on Senator [[Ted Kennedy|Edward Kennedy]], specifically pertaining to the [[Chappaquiddick incident]] and to Kennedy's possible extramarital affairs.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Hunt sought and used CIA disguises and other equipment for the project.&lt;ref&gt;Marjorie Hunter, "Colson Confirms Backing Kennedy Inquiry but Denies Knowing of Hunt's CIA Aid," New York Times (June 30, 1973), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; This mission eventually proved unsuccessful, with little if any useful information uncovered by Hunt.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

Hunt's White House duties included assassinations-related [[disinformation]]. In September 1971, Hunt forged and offered to a ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine reporter two top-secret [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] cables designed to prove that President Kennedy had personally and specifically ordered the assassination of [[Ngo Dinh Diem]] and his brother, [[Ngô Đình Nhu]].&lt;ref&gt;Szulc, ''Compulsive Spy'', 134–135.&lt;/ref&gt; Hunt told the Senate Watergate Committee in 1973 that he had fabricated the cables to show a link between President Kennedy and the assassination of Diem, a Catholic, to estrange Catholic voters from the Democratic Party, after Colson suggested he "might be able to improve upon the record."&lt;ref&gt;David E. Rosenbaum, "Hunt Says He Fabricated Cables on Diem to Link Kennedy to Killing of a Catholic; Testifies Colson Sought To Alienate Democrats," New York Times (September 25, 1973), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Seymour Hersh]], writing in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', Nixon White House tapes show that after presidential candidate [[George Wallace]] was shot on May 15, 1972, Nixon and Colson agreed to send Hunt to the [[Milwaukee]] home of the gunman, [[Arthur Bremer]], to place [[George McGovern|McGovern]] presidential campaign material there. The intention was to link Bremer with the Democrats. Hersh writes that, in a taped conversation, "Nixon is energized and excited by what seems to be the ultimate political dirty trick: the FBI and the Milwaukee police will be convinced, and will tell the world, that the attempted assassination of Wallace had its roots in left-wing Democratic politics." Hunt did not make the trip, however, because the FBI had moved too quickly to seal Bremer's apartment and place it under police guard.&lt;ref name="molotsky"&gt;Molotsky, Irvin (December 7, 1992).

Hunt and fellow operative [[G. Gordon Liddy]], along with the five burglars arrested at the Watergate, were indicted on federal charges three months later.

Hunt put pressure on the White House and the Committee to Re-Elect the President for cash payments to cover legal fees, family support, and expenses, for himself and his fellow burglars. Key Nixon figures, including Haldeman, [[Charles Colson]], [[Herbert W. Kalmbach]], [[John N. Mitchell|John Mitchell]], [[Fred LaRue]], and [[John Dean]] eventually became entangled in the payoff schemes, and large amounts of money were passed to Hunt and his accomplices, to try to ensure their silence at the trial, by pleading guilty to avoid prosecutors' questions, and afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;''Blind Ambition'', by John Dean, New York, 1976, [[Simon &amp; Schuster]]&lt;/ref&gt; Tenacious media, including ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and ''The New York Times'', eventually used investigative journalism to break open the payoff scheme, and published many articles that proved to be the beginning of the end for the cover-up. Prosecutors had to follow up once the media reported. Hunt also pressured Colson, Dean, and [[John Ehrlichman]] to ask Nixon for clemency in sentencing, and eventual presidential pardons for himself and his cronies; this eventually helped to implicate and snare those higher up.&lt;ref&gt;''All the President's Men'', by [[Carl Bernstein]] and [[Bob Woodward]], New York, 1974, Simon &amp; Schuster&lt;/ref&gt;

Hunt's wife, Dorothy, was killed in the December 8, 1972 plane crash of [[United Airlines]] [[United Airlines Flight 553|Flight 553]] in Chicago. [[United States Congress|Congress]], the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), and the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) investigated the crash, and found it to be an accident caused by crew error.&lt;ref&gt;[http://amelia.db.erau.edu/reports/ntsb/aar/AAR73-16.pdf NTSB report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070620171338/http://amelia.db.erau.edu/reports/ntsb/aar/AAR73-16.pdf |date=June 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over $10,000 in cash was found in Dorothy Hunt's handbag in the wreckage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0512/09/lt.03.html CNN Live Today, "Deadly Plane Skid in Chicago" Aired December 9, 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hunt eventually spent 33 months in prison at [[Federal Correctional Complex, Allenwood]] and the low-security Federal Prison Camp at [[Eglin Air Force Base]], Florida, on a conspiracy charge, arriving at the latter institution on April 25, 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Braxton, Sheila, "Hunt Arrives at Eglin&amp;nbsp;– 'Equal Treatment' Is All He Asks", ''Playground Daily News'', Fort Walton Beach, Florida, Sunday 27 April 1975, Volume 30, Number 68, page 1A.&lt;/ref&gt; While at Allenwood, he suffered a mild [[stroke]].&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=xJZ7RXFs_GIC&amp;pg=PA279&lt;/ref&gt; Hunt said he was bitter that he was sent to prison while Nixon was allowed to resign while avoiding prosecution for any crimes he may have committed; later, Nixon was fully pardoned in September 1974 by incoming President [[Gerald Ford]]. Hunt eventually applied for a presidential pardon but was turned down by [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=President Reagan Denied Pardons last month to E.

Sprague]] who compiled the photographs in 1966 and 1967, and subsequently turned them over to [[Jim Garrison]] during his [[trial of Clay Shaw|investigation of Clay Shaw]].{{sfn|Bugliosi|2007|p=930}} Appearing before a nationwide audience on the December 31, 1968, episode of ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]]'', Garrison held up a photo of the three and suggested they were involved in the assassination.{{sfn|Bugliosi|2007|p=930}} Later, in 1974, assassination researchers [[A. J. Weberman|Alan J.

Howard Hunt and [[Frank Sturgis]].{{sfn|Bugliosi|2007|p=931}} Comedian and civil rights activist [[Dick Gregory]] helped bring national media attention to the allegations against Hunt and Sturgis in 1975 after obtaining the comparison photographs from Weberman and Canfield.{{sfn|Bugliosi|2007|p=931}} Immediately after obtaining the photographs, Gregory held a press conference that received considerable coverage and his charges were reported in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and ''[[Newsweek]]''.{{sfn|Bugliosi|2007|p=931}}&lt;ref name="Weberman"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Weberman |first1=Alan J |authorlink1=A.

The Rockefeller Commission reported in 1975 that they investigated the allegation that Hunt and Sturgis, on behalf of the CIA, participated in the assassination of Kennedy.&lt;ref name="CCAUS-C19"&gt;{{cite book |title=Report to the President by Commission on CIA Activities in the United States |url=http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?docId=930&amp;relPageId=1 |format= |access-date= |type= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= June 1975 |origyear= |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |location=Washington, D.C. |page=251 |chapter=Chapter 19: Allegations Concerning the Assassination of President Kennedy |chapterurl=http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?absPageId=71095 |ref={{harvid|Report to the President by Commission on CIA Activities in the United States, Chapter 19|1975}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final report of that commission stated that witnesses who testified that the "derelicts" bore a resemblance to Hunt or Sturgis "were not shown to have any qualifications in photo identification beyond that possessed by an average layman".{{sfn|Report to the President by Commission on CIA Activities in the United States, Chapter 19|1975|p=256}} Their report also stated that FBI Agent Lyndal L. Shaneyfelt, "a nationally-recognized expert in photoidentification and photoanalysis" with the FBI photographic laboratory, had concluded from photo comparison that none of the men was Hunt or Sturgis.{{sfn|Report to the President by Commission on CIA Activities in the United States, Chapter 19|1975|p=257}} In 1979, the [[United States House Select Committee on Assassinations]] reported that forensic anthropologists had again analyzed and compared the photographs of the "tramps" with those of Hunt and Sturgis, as well as with photographs of Thomas Vallee, Daniel Carswell, and [[Fred Crisman|Fred Lee Chrisman]].&lt;ref name="HCSA-IB"&gt;{{cite book |title=Report of the Select Committee on Assassinations of the U.S. House of Representatives |url=https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/select-committee-report/ |format= |access-date= |type= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |year=1979 |month= |origyear= |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=91–92 |chapter=I.B.

In 1992, journalist Mary La Fontaine discovered the November 22, 1963 arrest records that the Dallas Police Department had released in 1989, which named the three men as Gus W. Abrams, Harold Doyle, and John F. Gedney.{{sfn|Bugliosi|2007|p=933}} According to the arrest reports, the three men were "taken off a boxcar in the railroad yards right after President Kennedy was shot", detained as "investigative prisoners", described as unemployed and passing through Dallas, then released four days later.{{sfn|Bugliosi|2007|p=933}}

===''Compulsive Spy'' and ''Coup d'Etat in America''===

The Rockefeller Commission's June 1975 report stated that they investigated allegations that the CIA, including Hunt, may have had contact with Oswald or [[Jack Ruby]].{{sfn|Report to the President by Commission on CIA Activities in the United States, Chapter 19|1975|pp=267-269}} According to the Commission, one "witness testified that E. Howard Hunt was Acting Chief of a CIA Station in Mexico City in 1963, implying that he ''could''&lt;!-- emphasis is in the original source --&gt; have had contact with Oswald when Oswald visited Mexico City in September 1963."{{sfn|Report to the President by Commission on CIA Activities in the United States, Chapter 19|1975|pp=269}} Their report stated that there was "no credible evidence" of CIA involvement in the assassination and noted: "At no time was [Hunt] ever the Chief, or Acting Chief, of a CIA Station in Mexico City.{{sfn|Report to the President by Commission on CIA Activities in the United States, Chapter 19|1975|pp=269}}

As part of his suit, Hunt filed a [[Complaint|legal action]] in the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia]] in September 1978 requesting that Szulc be cited for [[contempt of court|contempt]] if he refused to divulge his sources.&lt;ref name="The Washington Post; September 6, 1978" /&gt; Three months earlier, Szulc stated in a deposition that he refused to name his sources due to "the professional confidentiality of sources" and [[reporter's privilege|"journalistic privilege"]].&lt;ref name="The Washington Post; September 6, 1978" /&gt; Rubin stated that knowing the source of the allegation that Hunt was in Mexico City in 1963 was important because Szulc's passage "is what everybody uses as an authority... he's cited in everything written on E. Howard Hunt".&lt;ref name="The Washington Post; September 6, 1978" /&gt; He added that rumors that Hunt was involved in the Kennedy assassination might be put to end if Szulc's source was revealed.&lt;ref name="The Washington Post; September 6, 1978" /&gt; Stating that Hunt had not provided a sufficient reason to override Szulc's [[Freedom of the press in the United States|First Amendment rights to protect the confidentiality of his sources]], [[United States district court#United States district judges|United States District Judge]] [[Albert Vickers Bryan Jr.]] ruled in favor of Szulc.&lt;ref name="Pittsburgh Post-Gazette; November 4, 1978" /&gt;

===Libel suit: Liberty Lobby and ''The Spotlight''===
On November 3, 1978, Hunt gave a security-classified deposition for the House Select Committee on Assassinations. He denied knowledge of any conspiracy to kill Kennedy. (The [[President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992#Assassination Records Review Board|Assassination Records Review Board]] (ARRB) released the deposition in February 1996.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/secclass/Hunt_11-3-78/html/Hunt_0001a.htm HSCA Deposition (November 3, 1978)]&lt;/ref&gt; Two newspaper articles published a few months before the deposition stated that a 1966 CIA memo linking Hunt to the assassination of President Kennedy had recently been provided to the HSCA. The first article, by [[Victor Marchetti]]&amp;nbsp;– author of the book ''The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence'' (1974)&amp;nbsp;– appeared in the [[Liberty Lobby]] newspaper ''[[The Spotlight]]'' on August 14, 1978. According to Marchetti, the memo said in essence, "Some day we will have to explain Hunt's presence in Dallas on November 22, 1963."&lt;ref&gt;Victor Marchetti, "CIA to Admit Hunt Involvement in Kennedy Slaying," ''The Spotlight'' (August 14, 1978)&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote that Hunt, [[Frank Sturgis]], and [[Gerry Patrick Hemming]] would soon be implicated in a conspiracy to kill [[John F. Kennedy]].

The second article, by Joseph J. Trento and Jacquie Powers, appeared six days later in the Sunday edition of ''[[The News Journal]]'', [[Wilmington, Delaware]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://jfk.hood.edu/Collection/Weisberg%20Subject%20Index%20Files/H%20Disk/Hunt%20E%20Howard/Item%2044.pdf |format=[[PDF]] |first1=Joe |last1=Trento |first2=Jacquie |last2=Powers |newspaper=[[The News Journal|Sunday News Journal]] |volume=4 |number=34 |page=A-1 |date=August 28, 1978 |title=Was Howard Hunt in Dallas the Day JFK Died?}}&lt;/ref&gt; It alleged that the purported memo was initialed by Richard Helms and [[James Jesus Angleton|James Angleton]] and showed that, shortly after Helms and Angleton were elevated to their highest positions in the CIA, they discussed the fact that Hunt had been in Dallas on the day of the assassination and that his presence there had to be kept secret. However, nobody has been able to produce this supposed memo, and the [[United States President's Commission on CIA Activities within the United States]] determined that Hunt had been in Washington, D.C. on the day of the assassination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/hunt_sturgis.htm |first1=Magen |last1=Knuth |title=E.

Hunt sued ''Liberty Lobby''&amp;nbsp;– but not the ''Sunday News Journal''&amp;nbsp;– for [[Defamation|libel]]. ''Liberty Lobby'' stipulated, in this first trial, that the question of Hunt's alleged involvement in the assassination would not be contested.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/824/916/ Hunt v. Marchetti, 824 F.2d 916 (11th Cir. 1987)]. "In arguing that the stipulation should be binding on retrial, Hunt attempts to characterize the statements of the ''Liberty Lobby'' attorney as stipulating to the fact that Hunt was not in Dallas on the day of the Kennedy assassination. The statements, however, are more accurately viewed as a stipulation that the question of Hunt's alleged involvement in the assassination would not be contested at trial. They thus served merely to narrow the factual issues in dispute." Id. at 917–18 (citations omitted).&lt;/ref&gt; Hunt prevailed and was awarded $650,000 damages. In 1983, however, the case was overturned on appeal because of error in jury instructions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/720/631/ Hunt v. Liberty Lobby, 720 F.2d 631 (11th Cir. 1983)]. "Libel Award for Howard Hunt overturned by appeals court," New York Times (December 4, 1983).&lt;/ref&gt; In a second trial, held in 1985, [[Mark Lane (author)|Mark Lane]] made an issue of Hunt's location on the day of the Kennedy assassination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/824/916/ Hunt v. Marchetti, 824 F.2d 916 (11th Cir. 1987)]. "Hunt was aware throughout discovery prior to the retrial that Liberty Lobby intended to make Hunt's location on the day of the Kennedy assassination an issue on retrial." Id. at 928.&lt;/ref&gt; Lane successfully defended Liberty Lobby by producing evidence suggesting that Hunt had been in Dallas. He used depositions from [[David Atlee Phillips]], Richard Helms, [[G. Gordon Liddy]], [[Stansfield Turner]], and [[Marita Lorenz]], plus a [[cross-examination]] of Hunt. On retrial, the jury rendered a verdict for Liberty Lobby.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/824/916/ Hunt v. Marchetti, 824 F.2d 916 (11th Cir. 1987)]. "The jury on retrial rendered a verdict for Liberty Lobby. We affirm." Id. at 918.&lt;/ref&gt; Lane claimed he convinced the jury that Hunt was a JFK assassination conspirator, but some of the jurors who were interviewed by the media said they disregarded the conspiracy theory and judged the case (according to the judge's jury instructions) on whether the article was published with "reckless disregard for the truth."&lt;ref&gt;John McAdams, [http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/denial.htm "Implausible Assertions"]&lt;/ref&gt; Lane outlined his theory about Hunt's and the CIA's role in Kennedy's murder in a 1991 book, ''Plausible Denial''.&lt;ref name="isaacs"&gt;Isaacs, Jeremy (1997).

==''American Spy: My Secret History in the CIA, Watergate, and Beyond''==
Hunt's memoir, ''American Spy: My Secret History in the CIA, Watergate, and Beyond'', was ghost-written by Greg Aunapu and published by [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] in March 2007.&lt;ref name="reed"&gt;Reed, Christopher (January 25, 2007). [https://www.theguardian.com/obituaries/story/0,1997920,00.html E Howard Hunt obituary.] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Hunt Literary Estate, Hunt had intended to write an update to his 1974 autobiography ''Undercover'' and supplement this edition with post-9/11 reflections, but by the time he had embarked on the project, he was too ill to continue.  This prompted John Wiley &amp; Sons to search for and hire a ghost writer to write the book in its entirety.  According to St. John Hunt, it was he who suggested to his father the idea of a memoir to reveal what he knew about the Kennedy assassination, but the Hunt Literary Estate refutes this as scurrilous.&lt;ref name="Williams" /&gt; [[Scott Waxman]] was Hunt's literary agent on the book.&lt;ref name=Minzesheimer&gt;{{cite news|last=Minzesheimer|first=Bob|title='Deep Throat': Source of additional books?|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2005-06-01-bchat-watergate_x.htm|access-date=January 5, 2013|newspaper=USA Today|date=June 1, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foreword to ''American Spy'' was written by William F.

''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' called ''American Spy'' a "breezy, unrepentant memoir" and described it as a "nostalgic memoir [that] breaks scant new ground in an already crowded field".&lt;ref name="Publishers Weekly"&gt;{{cite web|title=American Spy: My Secret History in the CIA, Watergate and Beyond|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-471-78982-6|work=publishersweekly.com|publisher=Publishers Weekly|access-date=January 5, 2013|author=Publishers Weekly|authorlink=Publishers Weekly|date=February 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tim Rutten]] of the ''Los Angeles Times'' said it was "a bitter and self-pitying memoir" and "offers a rather standard account of how men of his generation became involved in intelligence work".&lt;ref name=Rutten&gt;{{cite news|last=Rutten|first=Tim|title=Book Review: Hunt, ever a true believer&amp;nbsp;– in himself|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/feb/28/entertainment/et-rutten28/2|access-date=January 5, 2013|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=February 28, 2007|authorlink=Tim Rutten|location=Los Angeles}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Referencing the book's title, [[Tim Weiner]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote: "''American Spy'' is presented as a 'secret history,' a double-barreled misrepresentation.

==In the media==
A fictionalized account of Hunt's role in the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion|Bay of Pigs]] operation appears in [[Norman Mailer]]'s 1991 novel ''[[Harlot's Ghost]]''. He was portrayed by [[Ed Harris]] in the 1995 biopic ''[[Nixon (film)|Nixon]]''. Canadian journalist [[David Giammarco]] interviewed Hunt for the December 2000 issue of ''[[Cigar Aficionado]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cigaraficionado.com/Cigar/CA_Archives/CA_Show_Article/0,2322,1086,00.html Cigar Aficionado], November/December 2000&lt;/ref&gt; He later wrote the foreword to Giammarco's book ''For Your Eyes Only: Behind the Scenes of the James Bond Films'' (ECW Press, 2002).

{{US Constitution article series}}

The '''Fifteenth Amendment''' ('''Amendment XV''') to the [[United States Constitution]] prohibits the federal government and each state from denying a citizen the [[Suffrage|right to vote]] based on that citizen's "[[Race (human classification)|race]], [[Colored|color]], or previous condition of servitude". It was ratified on February 3, 1870, as the third and last of the [[Reconstruction Amendments]].

In the final years of the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Reconstruction Era]] that followed, Congress repeatedly debated the rights of the millions of former black  slaves. By 1869, amendments had been passed to abolish slavery and provide citizenship and equal protection under the laws, but the election of [[Ulysses S. Grant]] to the presidency in 1868 convinced a majority of Republicans that protecting the franchise of black male voters was important for the party's future. On February 26, 1869, after rejecting more sweeping versions of a suffrage amendment, Congress proposed a compromise amendment banning franchise restrictions on the basis of race, color, or previous servitude. After surviving a difficult ratification fight, the amendment was certified as duly ratified and part of the Constitution on March 30, 1870.

[[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] decisions in the late nineteenth century interpreted the amendment narrowly. From 1890 to 1910, southern states adopted new state constitutions and enacted laws that raised barriers to voter registration. This resulted in most black voters and many poor white ones being [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchised]] by [[Poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]] and discriminatory [[literacy test]]s, among other barriers to voting, from which white male voters were exempted by [[grandfather clause]]s. A system of [[white primaries]] and violent intimidation by white groups also [[Voter suppression|suppressed]] black participation.

In the twentieth century, the Court began to interpret the amendment more broadly, striking down grandfather clauses in ''[[Guinn v. United States]]'' (1915) and dismantling the white primary system in the "Texas primary cases" (1927–1953). Along with later measures such as the [[Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-fourth Amendment]], which forbade poll taxes in federal elections, and ''[[Harper v. Virginia State Board of Elections]]'' (1966), which forbade poll taxes in state elections, these decisions significantly increased black participation in the American political system. To enforce the amendment, Congress enacted the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], which provided federal oversight of elections in discriminatory jurisdictions, banned literacy tests and similar discriminatory devices, and created legal remedies for people affected by voting discrimination.

The amendment created a split within the [[women's suffrage]] movement over the amendment not prohibiting denying the women the right to vote on account of sex.

==Background==
In the final years of the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Reconstruction Era]] that followed, Congress repeatedly debated the rights of black former slaves freed by the 1863 [[Emancipation Proclamation]] and the 1865 [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], the latter of which had formally abolished slavery. Following the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment by Congress, however, [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]s grew concerned over the increase it would create in the congressional representation of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]-dominated Southern states. Because the full population of freed slaves would be now counted rather than the three-fifths mandated by the previous [[Three-Fifths Compromise]], the Southern states would dramatically increase their power in the population-based [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|p=22}}&lt;ref name="Stromberg111"&gt;Stromberg, "A Plain Folk Perspective" (2002), p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Republicans hoped to offset this advantage by attracting and protecting votes of the newly enfranchised black population.{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|p=22}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Fourteenth Amendment: From Political Principle to Judicial Doctrine|last=Nelson|first=William E.|year=1988|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-04142-4|page=47|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VMCXjRyyKTQC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq=thirteenth+amendment+%22three+fifths%22#v=onepage&amp;q=thirteenth%20amendment%20%22three%20fifths%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=June 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stromberg, "A Plain Folk Perspective" (2002), p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1865, Congress passed what would become the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]], guaranteeing citizenship without regard to race, color, or previous condition of slavery or involuntary servitude. The bill also guaranteed equal benefits and access to the law, a direct assault on the [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]] passed by many post-war Southern states. The Black Codes attempted to return ex-slaves to something like their former condition by, among other things, restricting their movement, forcing them to enter into year-long labor contracts, prohibiting them from owning firearms, and by preventing them from suing or testifying in court.{{sfn|Foner|1988|pp=199–200}} Although strongly urged by moderates in Congress to sign the bill, [[Andrew Johnson|President Johnson]] vetoed it on March 27, 1866. In his veto message, he objected to the measure because it conferred citizenship on the freedmen at a time when 11 out of 36 states were unrepresented in the Congress, and that it discriminated in favor of African Americans and against whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forner|first=Eric|title=Reconstruction:America's Unfinished Revolution|year=2002|origyear=1988|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York|isbn=0-06-093716-5|pages=250–251|authorlink=Eric Forner}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Castel|first=Albert E.|title=The Presidency of Andrew Johnson|series=American Presidency|year=1979|publisher=The Regents Press of Kansas|location=Lawrence, Kan.|isbn=0-7006-0190-2|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three weeks later, Johnson's veto was overridden and the measure became law. This was the first time in American history that Congress was able to muster the votes necessary to override a presidential veto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Castel|first=Albert E.|title=The Presidency of Andrew Johnson|series=American Presidency|year=1979|publisher=The Regents Press of Kansas|location=Lawrence, Kan.|isbn=0-7006-0190-2|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this victory, even some Republicans who had supported the goals of the Civil Rights Act began to doubt that Congress possessed the constitutional power to turn those goals into laws.&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, Jeffrey. ''The Supreme Court: The Personalities and Rivalries That Defined America'', p. 79 (MacMillan 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Roger.

On June 18, 1866, Congress adopted the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], which guaranteed citizenship and equal protection under the laws regardless of race, and sent it to the states for ratification. After a bitter struggle that included attempted [[Rescission (contract law)|rescission]]s of ratification by two states, the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted on July 28, 1868.&lt;ref name=Killian&gt;{{cite book|title=The Constitution of the United States of America: Analysis and Interpretation: Analysis of Cases Decided by the Supreme Court of the United States to June 28, 2002|last=Killian|first=Johnny H.|publisher=Government Printing Office|isbn=978-0-16-072379-7|page=31|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bJjxj5gLRaEC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;dq=seward+July+28,+1868+promulgate#v=onepage&amp;q=seward%20July%2028%2C%201868%20promulgate&amp;f=false|display-authors=etal|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment punished, by reduced representation in the House of Representatives, any state that disenfranchised any male citizens over 21 years of age. By failing to adopt a harsher penalty, this signaled to the states that they still possessed the right to deny ballot access based on race.{{sfn|Foner|1988|p=255}} Northern states were generally as averse to granting voting rights to blacks as Southern states. In the year of its ratification, only eight Northern states allowed Blacks to vote.{{sfn|Foner|1988|p=448}} In the South, Blacks were able to vote in many areas, but only through the intervention of the occupying [[Union Army]].{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|p=36}} Congress had granted suffrage to Blacks in the territories by passing the Territorial Suffrage Act in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Globe, 39th Congress, 2nd Session, pp. 381–8&lt;/ref&gt;

Though many of the original proposals for the amendment had been moderated by negotiations in committee, the final draft nonetheless faced significant hurdles in being ratified by three-fourths of the states. Historian William Gillette wrote of the process, "it was hard going and the outcome was uncertain until the very end."&lt;ref name=Framing/&gt;

One source of opposition to the proposed amendment was the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage]] movement, which before and during the Civil War had made common cause with the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] movement. However, with the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment, which had explicitly protected only male citizens in its second section, activists found the civil rights of women divorced from those of blacks.{{sfn|Foner|1988|p=255}} Matters came to a head with the proposal of the Fifteenth Amendment, which barred race discrimination but not sex discrimination in voter laws. After an acrimonious debate, the [[American Equal Rights Association]], the nation's leading suffragist group, split into two rival organizations: the [[National Woman Suffrage Association]] of [[Susan B. Anthony]] and [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], who opposed the amendment, and the [[American Woman Suffrage Association]] of [[Lucy Stone]] and [[Henry Browne Blackwell]], who supported it. The two groups remained divided until the 1890s.{{sfn|Foner|1988|pp=447–48}}

Nevada was the first state to ratify the amendment, on March 1, 1869.&lt;ref name=Harp/&gt; The New England states and most Midwest states also ratified the amendment soon after its proposal.&lt;ref name=Framing /&gt; Southern states still controlled by Radical reconstruction governments, such as North Carolina, also swiftly ratified.{{sfn|Goldman|2001|p=3}} Newly elected President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] strongly endorsed the amendment, calling it "a measure of grander importance than any other one act of the kind from the foundation of our free government to the present day." He privately asked Nebraska's governor to call a special legislative session to speed the process, securing the state's ratification.&lt;ref name=Framing/&gt; In April and December 1869, Congress passed Reconstruction bills mandating that Virginia, Mississippi, Texas and Georgia ratify the amendment as a precondition to regaining congressional representation; all four states did so.&lt;ref name=Harp/&gt; The struggle for ratification was particularly close in Indiana and Ohio, which voted to ratify in May 1869 and January 1870, respectively.&lt;ref name=Framing /&gt;&lt;ref name=Harp/&gt; New York, which had ratified on April 14, 1869, tried to revoke its ratification on January 5, 1870. However, in February 1870, Georgia, Iowa, Nebraska, and Texas ratified the amendment, bringing the total ratifying states to twenty-nine—one more than the required twenty-eight ratifications from the thirty-seven states, and forestalling any court challenge to New York's resolution to withdraw its consent.&lt;ref name=Harp/&gt;

The amendment's adoption was met with widespread celebrations in black communities and abolitionist societies; many of the latter disbanded, feeling that black rights had been secured and their work was complete. President Grant said of the amendment that it "completes the greatest civil change and constitutes the most important event that has occurred since the nation came to life".&lt;ref name=Framing/&gt; Many Republicans felt that with the amendment's passage, black Americans no longer needed federal protection; congressman and future president [[James A. Garfield]] stated that the amendment's passage "confers upon the African race the care of its own destiny. It places their fortunes in their own hands."{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|p=37}} Congressman [[John R. Lynch]] later wrote that ratification of those two amendments made Reconstruction a success.&lt;ref name="lynch"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2713394?seq=1 John R.

==Application==

The first known black voter after the amendment's adoption was [[Thomas Mundy Peterson]], who cast his ballot on March 31, 1870, in a [[Perth Amboy, New Jersey]] referendum election adopting a revised city charter.&lt;ref&gt;Bond, Gordon. ''North Jersey Legacies: Hidden History from the Gateway to the Skylands''. The History Press, 2012, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[United States v. Reese]]'' (1876),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|92|214|1876}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] decision interpreting the Fifteenth Amendment, the Court interpreted the amendment narrowly, upholding ostensibly race-neutral limitations on suffrage including [[Poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]], [[literacy test]]s, and a [[grandfather clause]] that exempted citizens from other voting requirements if their grandfathers had been registered voters, a condition only white men could generally meet.{{sfn|Johnson|2000|p=661}}{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|p=97}} The Court also stated that the amendment does not confer the right of suffrage, but it invests citizens of the United States with the right of exemption from discrimination in the exercise of the elective franchise on account of their race, color, or previous condition of servitude, and empowers Congress to enforce that right by "appropriate legislation".&lt;ref name="See "&gt;See ''{{ussc|92|214|1876}}''&lt;/ref&gt; The Court wrote:

{{quote|The Fifteenth Amendment does not confer the right of suffrage upon any one. It prevents the States, or the United States, however, from giving preference, in this particular, to one citizen of the United States over another on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. Before its adoption, this could be done. It was as much within the power of a State to exclude citizens of the United States from voting on account of race, &amp;c., as it was on account of age, property, or education. Now it is not. If citizens of one race having certain qualifications are permitted by law to vote, those of another having the same qualifications must be. Previous to this amendment, there was no constitutional guaranty against this discrimination: now there is. It follows that the amendment has invested the citizens of the United States with a new constitutional right which is within the protecting power of Congress. That right is exemption from discrimination in the exercise of the elective franchise on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. This, under the express provisions of the second section of the amendment, Congress may enforce by "appropriate legislation."&lt;ref name="See "/&gt;}}

[[White supremacy|White supremacists]], such as the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK), used paramilitary violence to prevent blacks from voting. A number of blacks were killed at the [[Colfax massacre]] of 1873 while attempting to defend their right to vote. The [[Enforcement Acts]] were passed by Congress in 1870–1871 to authorize federal prosecution of the KKK and others who violated the amendment.{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|p=91}} However, as Reconstruction neared its end and federal troops withdrew, prosecutions under the Enforcement Acts dropped significantly. In ''[[United States v. Cruikshank]]'' (1876), the Supreme Court ruled that the federal government did not have the authority to prosecute the perpetrators of the Colfax massacre because they were not [[state actor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|92|542|1876}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Judicial&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3425000966.html|title=Fifteenth Amendment (Judicial Interpretation)|author=Elliott, Ward E.

===Post-Reconstruction===
From 1890 to 1910, poll taxes and literacy tests were instituted across the South, effectively disenfranchising the great majority of black men. [[White male primaries|White male-only primary elections]] also served to reduce the influence of black men in the political system. Along with increasing legal obstacles, blacks were excluded from the political system by threats of violent reprisals by whites in the form of [[Lynching|lynch mob]]s and terrorist attacks by the Ku Klux Klan.{{sfn|Johnson|2000|p=661}} Some Democrats even advocated a repeal of the amendment, such as [[William Bourke Cockran]] of [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref name=GOPTextbookColored&gt;{{cite book|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/murray:@field(DOCID+@lit(lcrbmrpt1615div1))|title=A Republican Text-Book for Colored Voters|first1=Thomas H.R.|last1=Clarke|first2=Barney|last2=McKay|accessdate=February 28, 2016|date=1901|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=T.H.R.

In the 20th century, the Court began to read the Fifteenth Amendment more broadly.&lt;ref name=Judicial/&gt; In ''[[Guinn v. United States]]'' (1915),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|238|347|1915}}&lt;/ref&gt; a unanimous Court struck down an Oklahoma grandfather clause that effectively exempted white voters from a literacy test, finding it to be discriminatory. The Court ruled in the related case ''[[Myers v. Anderson]]'' (1915), that the officials who enforced such a clause were liable for civil damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|238|368|1915}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3425001154.html|title=Guinn v.

The Court addressed the white primary system in a series of decisions later known as the "Texas primary cases". In ''[[Nixon v. Herndon]]'' (1927),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|273|536|1927}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nixon sued for damages under federal civil rights laws after being denied a ballot in a Democratic party primary election on the basis of race. The Court found in his favor on the basis of the Fourteenth Amendment, which guarantees equal protection under the law, while not discussing his Fifteenth Amendment claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3425001782.html|title=Nixon v.

Following ''Nixon'', the Democratic Party's state convention instituted a rule that only whites could vote in its primary elections; the Court unanimously upheld this rule as constitutional in ''[[Grovey v. Townsend]]'' (1935), distinguishing the discrimination by a private organization from that of the state in the previous primary cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|295|45|1935}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3425001149.html|title=Grovey v.

The Court also used the amendment to strike down a [[Gerrymandering|gerrymander]] in ''[[Gomillion v. Lightfoot]]'' (1960).&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|364|339|1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision found that the redrawing of city limits by [[Tuskegee, Alabama]] officials to exclude the mostly black area around the [[Tuskegee University|Tuskegee Institute]] discriminated on the basis of race.&lt;ref name=Judicial/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-2874600048.html|title=Brown, John R.|author=Newman, Roger K.|date=January 1, 2001|work=The Scribner Encyclopedia of American Lives|publisher={{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court later relied on this decision in ''[[Rice v. Cayetano]]'' (2000),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|528|495|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; which struck down ancestry-based voting in elections for the [[Office of Hawaiian Affairs]]; the ruling held that the elections violated the Fifteenth Amendment by using "ancestry as a racial definition and for a racial purpose".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-75251344.html|title=Race and the right to vote after Rice v.

After judicial enforcement of the Fifteenth Amendment ended grandfather clauses, white primaries, and other discriminatory tactics, Southern black voter registration gradually increased, rising from five percent in 1940 to twenty-eight percent in 1960.&lt;ref name=Judicial/&gt; Although the Fifteenth Amendment was never interpreted to prohibit poll taxes, in 1962 the [[Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-fourth Amendment]] was adopted banning poll taxes in federal elections, and in 1966 the Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Harper v. Virginia State Board of Elections]]'' (1966)&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|383|663|1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; that state poll taxes violate the Fourteenth Amendment's [[Equal Protection Clause]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3425001182.html|title=Harper v.

Congress used its authority pursuant to Section 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment to pass the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], achieving further racial equality in voting. Sections 4 and 5 of the Voting Rights Act required states and local governments with histories of racial discrimination in voting to submit all changes to their voting laws or practices to the federal government for approval before they could take effect, a process called "preclearance." By 1976, sixty-three percent of Southern blacks were registered to vote, a figure only five percent less than that for Southern whites.&lt;ref name="Judicial" /&gt;

The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of Sections 4 and 5 in ''[[South Carolina v. Katzenbach]]'' (1966). However, in ''[[Shelby County v. Holder]]'' (2013), the Supreme Court ruled that Section 4(b) of the Voting Rights Act, which established the coverage formula that determined which jurisdictions were subject to preclearance, was no longer constitutional and exceeded Congress's enforcement authority under Section 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment. The Court declared that the Fifteenth Amendment "commands that the right to vote shall not be denied or abridged on account of race or color, and it gives Congress the power to enforce that command. The Amendment is not designed to punish for the past; its purpose is to ensure a better future."&lt;ref name="NYT20130625" /&gt; According to the Court, "Regardless of how to look at the record no one can fairly say that it shows anything approaching the 'pervasive,' 'flagrant,' 'widespread,' and 'rampant' discrimination that faced Congress in 1965, and that clearly distinguished the covered jurisdictions from the rest of the nation." In dissent, Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] wrote, "Throwing out preclearance when it has worked and is continuing to work to stop discriminatory changes is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/john-lewis-and-others-react-to-the-supreme-courts-voting-rights-act-ruling/2013/06/25/acb96650-ddda-11e2-b797-cbd4cb13f9c6_story.html "John Lewis and others react to the Supreme Court's Voting Rights Act ruling"], [[The Washington Post]], June 25, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/12-96#writing-12-96_DISSENT_5|title=SHELBY COUNTY, ALABAMA v.

The '''Fundación Mujeres en Igualdad''' ('''MEI'''), known in English as the '''Women in Equality Foundation''', is an Argentine [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] created in March 1990. It has been awarded consultative status with [[United Nations]] [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|ECOSOC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mujeresenigualdad.org.ar/quienes-somos.html|title=Women in Equality Foundation|website=|publisher=Women in Equality Foundation|date=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation sets out to combat gender based violence and discrimination against women by promoting welfare, participation and empowerment in the political, economic, social and cultural spheres.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mujeresenigualdad.org.ar/nuestros-temas.html|title=Mujeres en Igualdad. Nuestros Temas.|date=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; From its inception Women in Equality promoted the use of the [[Information and communications technology|new technologies]] intensively, being the first women´s NGO in Argentina to have a website. Through such initiatives it has networked and created partnerships with NGOs and with the women's movement both at the national and international levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://entremujeres.clarin.com/genero/toda-clase-maltrato_0_1334869890.html|title=Contra toda clase de maltrato|date=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
Mujeres en Igualdad Foundation has its offices in Florida, [[Buenos Aires Province|Province of Buenos Aires]].&lt;ref&gt;Not the US state of Florida&lt;/ref&gt; The founder of Women in Equality was Zita Montes de Oca,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apdh-argentina.org.ar/sites/default/files/Las%20conquistas%20de%20las%20mujeres.pdf|title=Las conquistas de las mujeres. APDH|date=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Monique Thiteux- Altschul as its executive director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mujeresenigualdad.org.ar/integrantes-del-consejo.html|title=Consejo MEI|date=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I had the privilege to accompany her in the creation of Mujeres en Igualdad in 1990, when the women´s movement set out to enact an electoral quota law: a tough goal to attain but which would ensure critical changes for women in the political field. Since then, we shared eight years of feminism, friendship and hard work, as well as the discovery of the digital world into which we dived with a passion, seeing how the networks that Zita had built from within the public sphere, grew, tied together, were enriched both in the way we communicated as well as on the issues we discussed.| Monique Thiteux-Altschul&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zita Montes de Oca: la funcionaria y la feminista=|url=http://www.apdh-argentina.org.ar/sites/default/files/Las%20conquistas%20de%20las%20mujeres.pdf|date=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Fields of advocacy ==
* [[LGBT]] (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights): "For the human rights of the LGBT community" Project, sponsored by the Embassy of the United States of America in Buenos Aires.
* Gender violence: "Seven voices against gender based violence" Project, coordinated by MEI and executed with the Office of Domestic Violence, the Office of Women in the Argentine Supreme Court of Justice, and the Women Judges Association of Argentina, with the Office of Victims against Violence of the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights, Vital Voices of Argentina and the Avon Foundation. With the support of International Avon Foundation and Vital Voices Partnership.
* Clothes sizes law in Argentina: Mujeres en Igualdad was and is a consultant for National and Provincial laws on clothes sizes, and organizes monitoring and broadcasting campaigns.
* Gender and corruption: : Mujeres en Igualdad participated in the 1st Encuentro del Comité de Estrategia de la Coordinación de la Coalición [[UNCAC]] (United Nations Convention against Corruption) held in  Vienna in June 2014, and became Regional Site for the Americas, UNCAC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mujeranticorrupcion.org.ar/|title=Mujer anticorrupción.|date=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Gender and sports: Mujeres en Igualdad has developed a team specially devoted to reverse cases of discrimination in sports. In 2012 the Foundation presented a draft for a law at the Women´s Parliament of the Legislature of the City of Buenos Aires dealing with a compulsion for non profit civil associations, sports clubs and sports federations to include equality of gender considerations in the Ruling Committees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mujeresenigualdad.org.ar/litigios-contra-la-discriminacion.html|title=Género y deportes|date=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Human trafficking: In 2003 Mujeres en Igualdad created the No to Trafficking Network that it coordinated through 2005, and organized numerous seminars and training workshops, with strong media support. The “Empowering Young women in the frontiers: Gender violence and human trafficking” project, financed by UN Women 2010-11 focused on young women in borderland regions (Jujuy/La Quiaca; Posadas/Encarnación) for them to become familiar with and exercise their rights and organize to prevent gender violence and human trafficking. They were qualified to carry out basic strategies in participative democracy with an emphasis on gender equality: requests for valid information (access to information), advocacy campaigns and claims and grievances were presented to accountable office holders in the light of non compliance with their duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.diariopopular.com.ar/notas/238953-alertan-sujeto-que-busca-chicas-una-red-trata|title=Trata de personas en Argentina|date=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Woman and politics: Mujeres en Igualdad was and continues to promote the warranties awarded by the Quota Law, by considering it a critical factor that explains the high degree of representation of women in Argentina´s political life. Internationally, Argentina occupies the fifth place with 39,1% of women in parliamentary duties. In this field, MEI continues to deepen its activities in order to generate reforms to guarantee equality of men and women citizens and carries out campaigns to achieve parity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mujeresenigualdad.org.ar/mujer-y-pol%C3%ADtica.html|title=Mujer y política|date=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Litigation on discrimination: The Freddo case, and Instituto Romero Brest case. In both, MEI acted as a litigant in both the Freddo company, as well as Physical Education institution, which included the criteria of Non Discrimination and Gender Equality in their policies and procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mujeresenigualdad.org.ar/litigios-contra-la-discriminacion.html|title=Freddo-Mujeres se buscan|date=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 1, the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] officially declared that the U.S. economy had entered [[recession]] in December 2007, a full year earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/02/business/02markets.html | title=It’s Official: Recession Started One Year Ago | publisher=The New York Times | date=2008-12-01 | accessdate=2008-12-01 | first=Michael M. | last=Grynbaum |author2=David Jolly}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[late 2000s recession]])

On December 11, the [[FBI]] announced the arrest of [[Bernard Madoff]] in a [[Ponzi scheme]] which totaled $50 billion by Madoff's own estimate, and which was soon found to affect banks, individuals, and charities in the U.S. and Europe. &lt;ref&gt;[http://projects.nytimes.com/creditcrisis/madoff_clients/table Continually updated list of banks, individuals, and charities which claim losses due to Madoff at ''The New York Times'' Retrieved January 24, 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403054455/http://projects.nytimes.com//creditcrisis//madoff_clients//table |date=April 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hartera''' is an annual [[Electronic dance|electronica]] music festival held in [[Rijeka]], [[Croatia]]. The name derives from the festivals location, an old paper factory (which was one of the largest in Europe) that functioned for 150 years before shutting down. One of the original purposes of the Hartera Festival was to preserve the old building by converting it into a public gathering for cultural purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visit-croatia.co.uk/festivals/hartera_festival.htm Visit Croatia: Hartera Festival]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Illegal entry''' is the act of foreign nationals arriving in or crossing the borders into a country in violation of its [[immigration law]].

Migrants from nations that do not have automatic visa agreements, or who would not otherwise qualify for a visa, often cross the borders illegally in some areas like the [[United States–Mexico border]], the Mona Channel between the [[Dominican Republic]] and [[Puerto Rico]], the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], [[Fuerteventura]], and the [[Strait of Otranto]]. These methods are often dangerous: migrants have been known to suffocate in [[Containerization|shipping containers]],&lt;ref name="Container"&gt;{{cite web|title=Three illegal migrants die in shipping container|url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2000/01/10/migrants000110.html|accessdate=2007-10-03|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=2000-11-11|work=CBC News website}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[boxcar]]s&lt;ref name="Boxcar"&gt;{{cite web|title=At least 52 immigrants die of heat crossing from Mexico|url=http://www.visalaw.com/98aug/33aug98.html|accessdate=2007-10-03|publisher=Siskind Susser Bland|year=1998|work=Visalaw.com—The Immigration Law portal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and trucks,&lt;ref name="Truck"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ninth on Trial in Dutch Court for Murder and Illegal Immigration|url=http://english.people.com.cn/english/200103/06/eng20010306_64193.html|accessdate=2008-08-16|publisher=People's Daily Online|date=2001-03-06|work=China People's Daily website}}&lt;/ref&gt; sink in [[shipwreck]]s caused by unseaworthy vessels&lt;ref name="Shipwreck"&gt;{{cite web|title=22 Die as illegal immigrants ship capsizes in Mediterranean|url=http://pakistantimes.net/2004/10/05/top5.htm|accessdate=2008-08-16|publisher=Times Group of Publications|date=2004-10-05|work=Pakistan Times website}}&lt;/ref&gt; or die of [[dehydration]]&lt;ref name="Dehydration"&gt;{{cite web|title=Illegal Immigration: An American Tragedy|url=http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/viewArticle.asp?articleID=21975|accessdate=2008-08-16|publisher=Ultio LLC|date=2007-03-12|work=American Chronicle website}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Hypothermia|exposure]] during long walks without water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Evelyn Nieves | publisher=[[New York Times]] | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E7D6103BF935A3575BC0A9649C8B63 | date= August 6, 2002 | title=Illegal Immigrant Death Rate Rises Sharply in Barren Areas. | accessdate=2008-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Human smuggling]] is the practice of intermediaries aiding undocumented migrants in crossing international borders for financial gain, often in large groups. Human smuggling differs from, but is sometimes associated with, [[human trafficking]]. A human smuggler will facilitate illegal entry into a country for a fee, but on arrival at their destination, the smuggled person is usually free. Trafficking involves a process of using physical force, [[fraud]], or [[deception]] to obtain and transport people, usually for the purpose of forced labor or prostitution at the destination.

==By country==

=== India ===

Presently, [[India]] is constructing a fence along the border to restrict illegal traffic from [[Bangladesh]].&lt;ref name="BBC-FOOC"&gt;{{cite news|title=Villagers left in limbo by border fence|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/4653810.stm|accessdate=2008-08-16|publisher=BBC|date=2006-01-28|work=BBC News website}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Indo-Bangladeshi barrier]] is {{convert|4,000|km|mi|sp=us}} long.  The stated aim of the fence is to stop infiltration of terrorists, prevent smuggling, and to bring a close to illegal immigration from Bangladesh.&lt;ref name="JPost-Fences"&gt;{{cite web|title=The good fences epidemic|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1170359860662&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/Printer|accessdate=2008-08-16|publisher=The Jerusalem Post|date=2007-02-14|work=The Jerusalem Post|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111209170816/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1170359860662&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter|archivedate=2011-12-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TimesOnline"&gt;{{cite news|title=India builds a 2,500-mile barrier to rival the Great Wall of China|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article782933.ece|accessdate=2008-08-16|publisher=Times Newspapers Ltd|date=2005-12-28|work=The Times Online website | location=London | first=Raekha | last=Prasad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australia ===

{{see also|Tampa affair}}

In [[Australia]], [[Mandatory detention in Australia|mandatory immigration detention]] was revived in 1992 for all foreigners who arrive in Australia without a [[Visa (document)|visa]]. That only "border applicants" are subject to detention has sparked criticism, as it is claimed to unfairly discriminate against certain migrants.&lt;ref name="HRB"&gt;{{cite journal
 | last = Wood

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Suspected Irregular Entry Vessel]] was the name used by the [[Australian Defence Force]] or [[Australian Coastwatch]] for maritime vessels which were suspected to be attempting to reach Australia [[unauthorised arrival|without authorisation]]. In practice, these boats were often carrying [[refugee|asylum seekers]] who had departed from [[Indonesia]] on the final leg of a journey which started in countries such as [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]] after paying people smugglers.

===Palestine===
During 1933-1948, the British government limited Jewish immigration to Palestine with quotas, and following the rise of [[Nazism]] to power in [[Germany]], illegal immigration to Palestine commenced. The illegal immigration was known as [[Aliyah Bet]] ("secondary immigration"), or ''Ha'apalah'', and was organized by the [[Mossad Le'aliyah Bet]], as well as by the [[Irgun]]. Immigration was done mainly by sea, and to a lesser extent overland through [[Iraq]] and [[Syria]]. Beginning in 1939 Jewish immigration was further restricted, limiting it to 75,000 individuals for a period of five years after which immigration was to end completely. During [[World War II]] and the years that followed until independence, ''Aliyah Bet'' became the main form of Jewish immigration to Palestine. Despite British efforts to curb the illegal immigration, during the 14 years of its operation, 110,000 Jews immigrated to Palestine.

===Turkey===

Turkey, which is a transit point for unauthorized migrants trying to reach Europe, has been accused of being unable to secure its borders with Greece. Since 1996, 40 unauthorized migrants have been killed by mines, after entering Greek territory in [[Evros (regional unit)|Evros]].&lt;ref name="BBC-Landmine"&gt;{{cite news|title=Landmine deaths on Greek border|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3149744.stm|accessdate=2008-08-16|publisher=BBC|date=2003-09-29|work=BBC News website}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, about 800 illegal immigrants were rescued by the Greek coastguards after a fire broke out on board the Turkish-flagged ''Brelner'', believed to have set sail from the Turkish port of İzmir, probably en route to Italy.&lt;ref name="BBC-Brelner"&gt;{{cite news|title=Greece rescues immigrant ship|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1639933.stm|accessdate=2008-08-16|publisher=BBC|date=2001-11-05|work=BBC News website}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once in July 2004 and a second time in May 2006, [[Hellenic Coast Guard]] ships were caught on film cruising as near as a few hundred meters off the Turkish coast and abandoning clandestines to the sea. This practice resulted in the drowning of six people between [[Chios]] and [[Karaburun]] on 26 September 2006 while three others disappeared and 31 were saved by Turkish gendarmes and fishermen.  Three of the drowned were [[Tunisian people|Tunisians]], one was [[Algerian people|Algerian]], one [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] and the other [[Iraqi people|Iraqi]]. The three disappeared were also Tunisians.&lt;ref name="TDN"&gt;{{cite web|title=UNHCR seeks information from Turkey, Greece on migrant tragedy|url=http://www.turkishdailynews.com.tr/article.php?enewsid=55214|accessdate=2008-08-16|publisher=Dogan Daily News Inc|date=2006-09-28|work=Turkish Daily News website}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hürriyet1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mülteci operasyonu|url=http://hurarsiv.hurriyet.com.tr/goster/haber.aspx?id=5115588&amp;tarih=2006-09-20|accessdate=2008-08-16|publisher=Hürriyet|date=2006-09-20|work=Hürriyet website|language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hürriyet2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Yunan botları kaçakları yine denize attı|url=http://proje.hurriyet.com.tr/msnnews/?path=/gundem/5152587.asp&amp;y=41|accessdate=2008-08-16|publisher=Hürriyet|date=2006-09-26|work=Hürriyet website|language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of bilateral negotiations, a readmission agreement was signed between [[Turkey]] and [[Greece]] in November 2001 and went into effect in April 2002. For third country nationals, this protocol gives the parties 14 days to inform each other of the number of persons to be returned after the date of illegal entry. For nationals of the two countries the authorities can make use of simplified procedures. But the strict application of the agreement is reported to have retrograded as of 2003.

===China===
[[People's Republic of China]] is building a security barrier along its border with [[North Korea]] to prevent defectors or refugees from North Korea from entering the country illegally.&lt;ref name="Jurist"&gt;{{cite web|title=China building border fence facing North Korea |url=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2006/10/china-building-border-fence-facing.php |accessdate=2008-08-16 |publisher=Bernard J.

On May 13, 2004, the [[People's Republic of China]] sentenced [[Yang Jianli]], a [[China|Chinese]] [[dissident]] with [[United States|U.S.]] [[Immigration to the United States|residency]], to five years in prison for [[espionage]] and illegal entry.

===Hong Kong===

The illegal [[Vietnamese people in Hong Kong|entry of Vietnamese refugees]] was a concern for the [[Hong Kong]] government for 25 years. The issue was first resolved in 2000. Between 1975 and 1999, 143,700 Vietnamese refugees were resettled in other countries and more than 67,000 Vietnamese migrants were repatriated.&lt;ref name="immig"&gt;{{cite web|title=The influx of Vietnamese boat people |url=http://www.immd.gov.hk/40/eng/mil/70s/mil_70s_iv.html |accessdate=2007-05-02 |publisher=The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China |year=2008 |work=Hong Kong Government Immigration Department website |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926220321/http://www.immd.gov.hk/40/eng/mil/70s/mil_70s_iv.html |archivedate=2007-09-26 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The unfenced, rural mountainous and desert border between Arizona and Mexico has become a major entrance area for unlawful migration to the United States, due in part to the increased difficulty of crossing illegally into California. Each year

=== United Kingdom ===
A recent study into irregular immigration to the [[United Kingdom]] states that "most irregular migrants have committed administrative offences rather than a serious crime".&lt;ref name=UKippr06&gt;[http://www.ippr.org/ecomm/files/irregular_migration.pdf Irregular migration in the UK: An ippr factfile] Institute for Public Policy Research, April 2006, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, illegal entry action was initiated against 36,550 migrants; it was estimated that more migrants overstay their visa than enter clandestinely, hence considered unlikely that there are large numbers of people crossing UK borders without permission.&lt;ref name=UKippr06/&gt;

Many of the routes for clandestine entry are very dangerous. There were 72 documented deaths that are thought to have occurred while entering UK between 1993 and 2002.&lt;ref name=UKippr06/&gt; The most common cause of death while entering the UK (61 of the deaths recorded) was suffocation in a lorry while being smuggled into the UK by ferry; Others drowned in the English Channel, froze to death as stowaways on an aeroplane and were crushed by trains in the Channel Tunnel.&lt;ref name=UKippr06/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21076">An '''International Anti-Corruption Court''' (IACC) is a proposal for the establishment of a court similar to the [[International Criminal Court]] or as part of it, for the criminal enforcement of laws prohibiting grand corruption.&lt;ref&gt;Mark L. Wolf, [https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-case-for-an-international-anti-corruption-court/ The Case for an International Anti-Corruption Court], Brookings Institution, Governance Studies at Brookings, July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea for an International Anti-Corruption Court was first put forward by Judge [[Mark L. Wolf]] at the 2012 [[St. Petersburg International Legal Forum]] and subsequently presented at the 2014 World Forum on Governance.&lt;ref&gt;Mark L. Wolf, [https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-case-for-an-international-anti-corruption-court/ The Case for an International Anti-Corruption Court], Brookings Institution, Governance Studies at Brookings, July 2014, p.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Wolf outlined the proposal in a paper for the Brookings Institution in July 2014,&lt;ref&gt;Mark L. Wolf, [https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-case-for-an-international-anti-corruption-court/ The Case for an International Anti-Corruption Court], Brookings Institution, Governance Studies at Brookings, July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in a Washington Post op-ed on 22 July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Mark L. Wolf, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/mark-l-wolf-we-need-an-international-court-to-stamp-out-corruption/2014/07/22/a15ecc38-10ff-11e4-9285-4243a40ddc97_story.html We need an international court to stamp out corruption], The Washington Post, 22 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the proposed Court, states could voluntarily accede to the IACC, granting it jurisdiction over investigating and prosecuting domestic acts of grand corruption. The IACC would be staffed by top prosecutors and impartial judges selected by the Court’s state parties. Crucially, the IACC would operate under the principle of “complementarity,” meaning it would only conduct prosecutions where domestic courts are unwilling or unable. In this way, the IACC would act as incentive for domestic governments to establish adequate anti-corruption processes while ensuring that corrupt leaders are held accountable where the effective processes do not yet exist. In these respects, the IACC is similar to, but distinct from, the International Criminal Court (ICC), and may be designed in a way that draws on the strengths of the ICC model while avoiding some of its weaknesses.

Other elements of Wolf's proposal&lt;ref&gt;Mark L. Wolf, [https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-case-for-an-international-anti-corruption-court/ The Case for an International Anti-Corruption Court], Brookings Institution, Governance Studies at Brookings, July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; include:

* The court would be staffed by elite investigators and prosecutors as well impartial judges;
* The court would serve as a forum for the criminal enforcement of the laws prohibiting grand corruption that exist in virtually every country, and the undertakings that are requirements of various treaties and international organisations (including the [[United Nations Convention against Corruption]] and the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Officials, often called the [[OECD Anti-Bribery Convention]]); 
* The court should operation on the principle of complementarity, meaning the court would only conduct prosecutions where states are unwilling or unable to prosecute;
* The court should be empowered to hear civil fraud and corruption cases brought by private "whistleblowers"';
* Submission to the jurisdiction of the court should be incorporated in the [[United Nations Convention against Corruption]] and a condition of membership in international organisations such as the OECD and WTO;
* Submission to the jurisdiction of the court should be a condition of obtaining loans from international lenders such as the World Bank; and
* Submission to the jurisdiction of the court should be incorporated into new free trade agreements.

Wolf argues that an IACC would have "the potential to erode the widespread culture of impunity, contribute to creating conditions conducive to the democratic election of honest officials in countries which have long histories of grand corruption, and honor the courageous efforts of the many people, particularly young people, who are increasingly exposing and opposing corruption at great personal peril."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-case-for-an-international-anti-corruption-court/ The Case for an International Anti-Corruption Court], Brookings Institution, Governance Studies at Brookings, July 2014, p.&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;/ref&gt; Wolf attributes this "culture of impunity" to an "unwillingness of leaders to permit the honest and able investigation of their friends, families, and, indeed, themselves."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-case-for-an-international-anti-corruption-court/ The Case for an International Anti-Corruption Court], Brookings Institution, Governance Studies at Brookings, July 2014, p.&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;/ref&gt; The IACC proposal is designed to address this, noting that existing international efforts to combat grand corruption have not been adequate or effective.

On 13 November 2014, in oral testimony before a Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission Briefing, Arvind Ganesan, Business and Human Rights Director at Human Rights Watch said that a "key step" in fighting grand corruption is to "Support efforts to examine the legal, administrative, and other procedural steps needed to create an International Anti-Corruption Court."&lt;ref&gt;Arvind Ganesan, [https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/11/13/tom-lantos-human-rights-commission-briefing-international-anti-corruption-court-iacc Oral Testimony of Arvind Ganesan, Business and Human Rights Director, Human Rights Watch], Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission Briefing: An International Anti-Corruption Court (IACC) to Mitigate Grand Corruption and Human Rights Abuses, 13 November 2014. Retrieved 27 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Before highlighting actions the US Government could take to build momentum for the court, Ganesan also said, "Judge Mark Wolf's proposal for an international anti-corruption court is something Human Rights Watch believes could be a valuable step forward, but there are challenges ahead. The promise of the court has to be tempered with the technical and legal hurdles that would have to be overcome to make such a court a reality. It would need to have jurisdiction, investigative capacity, and operate in a way that still protects the rights of the accused. More challenging are the political realities, notwithstanding some of the technical challenges in starting such a court. Most notably, many governments, especially those ruled by kleptocrats, will not easily agree to a court that holds them accountable for plundering public funds."&lt;ref&gt;Arvind Ganesan, [https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/11/13/tom-lantos-human-rights-commission-briefing-international-anti-corruption-court-iacc Oral Testimony of Arvind Ganesan, Business and Human Rights Director, Human Rights Watch], Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission Briefing: An International Anti-Corruption Court (IACC) to Mitigate Grand Corruption and Human Rights Abuses, 13 November 2014.

'''Itzacon Eire''', more popularly known as Itzacon (not to be confused with ''Itzacon'', a defunct Sci Fi convention formerly held in Texas) is the premier [[gaming convention]] run by the [[Fantasy and Science Fiction Society]] (Fansci) of [[NUI Galway]], [[Ireland]].

==History==
Itzacon Eire was founded in 2005&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20041116120025/http://www.itzaconeire.com/ Itzacon I website at Archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Anita Murray]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://irishgamingwiki.com/wiki/Anita_Murray Anita Murray at Irishgamingwiki.com]&lt;/ref&gt; then Auditor of the Society. As of 2015 it has been run for eleven years successfully and looks to continue in that vein into its second decade.

In 2007 it established the [[National Game Writers Award]]. This award is for [[Role-playing game]] and [[LARP]] writers who have shown a continued dedication to the Irish convention scene and have produced material of noted quality for Itzacon Eire.

[[File:Jakarta Fair arena 2007.jpg|thumb|Jakarta Fair exhibitions and performances]]
'''Jakarta Fair''' ({{lang-id|'''Pekan Raya Jakarta''' or '''PRJ'''}}) is a [[fair]] held annually in [[Jakarta International Expo|Jakarta International Expo (JIE)]] [[Kemayoran]], [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]], in June and July. It features exhibitions, trade promotions, shopping, music performances, various shows, [[amusement ride]]s and a food festival. The fair is meant to celebrate the anniversary of Jakarta. The Jakarta Fair sees exhibitors from across the country display a whole range of goods and products ranging from specialty food items to traditional handmade arts and crafts. In addition to the many exhibitors, there is also live entertainment including music, dance and cultural performances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldeventsguide.com/event/4105/Jakarta-Indonesia/Jakarta-Fair-.html World Events Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Colonial era===
{{main article|Pasar Gambir}}
The fair incorporates trade exhibitions and entertainment that existed in [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] (now Jakarta) during [[Dutch East Indies]] era. Originally the annual fair took place in ''Koningsplein'' (now [[Merdeka Square, Jakarta|Merdeka square]]) in ''Weltevreden'' Batavia and it was called "[[Pasar Gambir]]".

===Pekan Raya Indonesia===
Pekan Raya Indonesia (old spelling Pekan Raja Indonesia), or Indonesia Fair,{{sfn|Merrillees|2015|p=90}} was held for three consecutive years between 1953 and 1955. It was held on the site where [[Atma Jaya Catholic University of Indonesia|Atma Jaya University]] now stands, on what is then called Kebayoran Road (now [[Sudirman Road|Jalan Jendral Sudirman]]). The 1950s version of the Pekan Raya was held to stimulate the economy of Indonesia by boosting national exports and bringing new technology and products to Indonesia, with main focus on restructuring the economy after the end of the colonial period.{{sfn|Merrillees|2015|p=90}}

The first Pekan Raya Indonesia was held between 29 August to 4 October 1953, officially known in English as "The First Indonesian International Trade &amp; Industrial Fair". China was the main international exhibitor. Among the notable features of the first Pekan Raya is the Chinese pavilion, which is the largest international pavilion in the Fair.{{sfn|Merrillees|2015|p=90}}

The second Pekan Raya Indonesia in 1954 has the [[Soviet Union]] as the main international exhibitor.{{sfn|Merrillees|2015|p=91}}

The last Pekan Raya Indonesia in 1955 has the United States as the main international exhibitor. Leading US companies e.g. Ford, General Motors, Caterpillar, Goodyear, RCA and Pan Am make exhibition in the fair. The [[Holiday on Ice]] was first introduced to Indonesia through the Pekan Raya Indonesia 1955, whose performance in Jakarta was attended by the wife of the late President, [[Eleanor Roosevelt]].{{sfn|Merrillees|2015|p=91}} Among other notable features of the last Pekan Raya Indonesia is the ''Stand Televisi'' ("television stand"), among the first introduction of a true color television to Indonesia.

===Pekan Raya on Medan Merdeka Selatan (1968-1991)===
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Ingang van de jaarbeurs op het Merdeka-plein TMnr 20025821.jpg|thumb|Entrance to Jakarta Fair on Medan Merdeka in the 1970s showing prominent post-war American-influenced decorations.]]
The modern Jakarta Fair or ''Pekan Raya'' was held again for the first time in 1968 and inaugurated by president [[Suharto]]. The fair took place from 5 June to 20 July 1968 on southern part of [[Merdeka Square, Jakarta|Merdeka square]] near [[National Monument (Indonesia)|National Monument]]. The idea to hold a grand fair in Jakarta was initiated by Jakarta's governor [[Ali Sadikin]] in 1967, inspired by the colonial era Pasar Gambir. He sought a centralized grand fair to combine several night markets ("Pasar Malam") held throughout the city. Since then it has become an annual event as part of the city's anniversary celebrations. The longest Jakarta Fair, of 71 days, was held in 1969. Usually Jakarta Fair is held for 30 to 35 days. United States president [[Richard Nixon]] is one of the VIP guest that visit Jakarta Fair 1969.

Part of the Jakarta Fair was the Taman Ria fun park, which was operated all year on the southwest corner of Medan Merdeka, forming part of the Jakarta fairgrounds.{{sfn|Merrillees|2015|p=115}}

The last Jakarta Fair in southern side of Medan Merdeka was in 1991. In 1992, the fair was relocated to the old Kemayoran Airport site.{{sfn|Merrillees|2015|p=115}}

===Jakarta International Expo at Kemayoran===
Because the number of participants grown steadily the [[fair]]ground in the southern park of Medan Merdeka square was considered not large enough to contain the grand fair. In 1992 the Jakarta fairground was moved to its present location in [[Jakarta International Expo]] at [[Kemayoran]]. The exhibition complex is located on former [[Kemayoran Airport]].

==Present==
In 2010 trade worth [[Indonesian rupiah|Rp]] 3.5 trillion ($410 million) occurred in Jakarta Fair. The 2011 ticket price is Rp 15,000 ($1.8) on weekdays and Rp 20,000 ($2.4) on Saturday, Sunday and holidays.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.poskota.co.id/berita-terkini/2011/06/07/jakarta-fair-siap-dibuka-kamis&lt;/ref&gt; 2,600 companies joined the 2011 Jakarta Fair in more than 1,300 stalls. The event attracted more than 4 million visitors with transaction worth Rp 3.7 trillion ($432.9 million) and surpassed the target.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/07/12/greater-jakarta-jakarta-fair-receives-record-number-visitors.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
A similar fair called [[Pasar Malam Besar]] held in [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]], also inspired by the "Pasar Malam" tradition of colonial era Pasar Gambir.

The {{nihongo|'''Japanese New Year'''|正月|Shōgatsu}} is an annual [[festival]] with its own customs. Since 1873, the official Japanese New Year has been celebrated according to the [[Gregorian calendar]], on January 1 of each year, {{nihongo|[[New Year's Day]]|元日|Ganjitsu}}. However, many traditional events of the Japanese New Year are still celebrated on the first day of the year on the modern [[Tenpō calendar]], the last official lunisolar calendar which was used until 1872 in Japan.

==History==
Prior to the [[Meiji period]], the date of the Japanese New Year had been based on Japanese versions of lunisolar calendar (the last of which was the [[Tenpō calendar]]) and, prior to [[Jōkyō calendar]], the Chinese versions. However, in 1873, five years after the [[Meiji Restoration]], [[Japan]] adopted the [[Gregorian calendar]] and the first day of January became the official and cultural New Year's Day in Japan

==Traditional food==
[[File:Oseti.jpg|thumb|right|{{nihongo|[[Osechi|''Osechi-ryōri'']]}}, typical new year's dishes]]

[[File:Japanese zoni and roasted fish.jpg|thumb|[[zōni]], a soup with [[mochi]] and grilled fish]]
&lt;!--[[File:Zoni by yoppy.jpg|thumbnail|Typical {{nihongo|[[ozouni|''ozōni'']]}}, a soup with mochi]]--&gt;
Japanese people eat a selection of dishes during the New Year celebration called {{nihongo|[[Osechi|''osechi-ryōri'']]|御節料理 or お節料理}}, typically shortened to ''osechi.'' Many of these dishes are sweet, sour, or dried, so they can keep without refrigeration—the culinary traditions date to a time before households had refrigerators, when most stores closed for the holidays.  There are many variations of ''osechi'', and some foods eaten in one region are not eaten in other places (or are considered inauspicious or even banned) on New Year's Day.  Another popular dish is {{nihongo|[[ozouni|''ozōni'']]|お雑煮}}, a soup with ''[[mochi]]'' rice cake and other ingredients that differ based on various regions of Japan. Today, [[sashimi]] and [[sushi]] are often eaten, as well as non-Japanese foods. To let the overworked stomach rest, {{nihongo|seven-[[herb]] rice soup|七草粥|nanakusa-gayu}} is prepared on the seventh day of January, a day known as {{nihongo|''[[jinjitsu]]''|人日}}.

==Mochi==
[[Image:Kagamimochi gorgeous version.jpg|thumb|right|A traditionally ornamented {{nihongo|''[[kagami mochi]]}}]]
Another custom is to create and eat {{nihongo|[[Mochi (food)|rice cakes]]|餅|mochi}}. Boiled {{nihongo|[[mochigome|sticky rice]]|餅米|mochigome}} is put into a wooden container {{nihongo|[[Usu (Mortar)|''usu'']]|臼}} and patted with water by one person while another person hits it with a large wooden mallet. Mashing the rice, it forms a sticky white [[dumpling]]. This is made before New Year's Day and eaten during the beginning of January.

''Mochi'' is made into a New Year's decoration called {{nihongo|''[[kagami mochi]]''|鏡餅}}, formed from two round cakes of mochi with a {{nihongo|[[daidai|tangerine]]|橙|daidai}} placed on top. The name ''daidai'' is supposed to be auspicious since it means "several generations."

==Bell ringing==
[[File:Joyanokane-groupringsbell-tokyoarea-jan1-2008.ogv|thumb|(video) A group rings a local temple bell shortly after midnight of the New Year (2008)]]
At midnight on December 31, Buddhist temples all over Japan ring their bells a total of 108 times (除夜の鐘 ''joyanokane'') to symbolize the [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|108 human sins]] in Buddhist belief, and to get rid of the 108 worldly desires regarding sense and feeling in every Japanese citizen. A major attraction is The Watched Night bell, in Tokyo. Japanese believe that the ringing of bells can rid their sins during the previous year. The bell is rung 107 times on 31st and once past midnight. It is also very common to eat buckwheat noodles called toshikoshi soba on the New Year's Eve.

==Postcards==
[[File:An Instance Of New Year Card In Japan.JPG|thumbnail| {{nihongo|''nengajō''}}, new year cards in Japan]]
The end of December and the beginning of January are the busiest times for the Japanese post offices. The Japanese have a custom of sending {{nihongo|New Year's Day [[postcard]]s|年賀状|nengajō}} to their friends and relatives, similar to the Western custom of sending [[Christmas card]]s. Their original purpose was to give your faraway friends and relatives tidings of yourself and your immediate family. In other words, this custom existed for people to tell others whom they did not often meet that they were alive and well.

Japanese people send these postcards so that they arrive on 1 January. The post office guarantees to deliver the greeting postcards on 1 January if they are posted within a time limit, from mid-December to near the end of the month and are marked with the word ''nengajō''. To deliver these cards on time, the post office usually hires students part-time to help deliver the letters.

It is customary not to send these postcards when one has had a [[death]] in the family during the year. In this case, a family member sends a simple postcard called {{nihongo|''mochū hagaki''|喪中葉書||mourning postcards}} to inform friends and relatives they should not send New Year's cards, out of respect for the deceased.

People get their ''nengajō'' from many sources. Stationers sell preprinted cards. Most of these have the [[Chinese zodiac]] sign of the New Year as their design, or conventional greetings, or both. The Chinese zodiac has a cycle of 12 years. Each year is represented by an animal. The animals are, in order: [[Rat (zodiac)|Rat]], [[Ox (zodiac)|Ox]], [[Tiger (zodiac)|Tiger]], [[Rabbit (zodiac)|Rabbit]], [[Dragon (zodiac)|Dragon]], [[Snake (zodiac)|Snake]], [[Horse (zodiac)|Horse]], [[Goat (zodiac)|Goat]], [[Monkey (zodiac)|Monkey]], [[Rooster (zodiac)|Rooster]], [[Dog (zodiac)|Dog]], and [[Pig (zodiac)|Pig]]. 2008 was the year of the [[Rat (zodiac)|Rat]], 2009 [[Ox (zodiac)|Ox]], 2010 [[Tiger (zodiac)|Tiger]], 2011 [[Rabbit (zodiac)|Rabbit]], 2012 [[Dragon (zodiac)|Dragon]], and 2013 was the year of the [[Snake (zodiac)|Snake]]. Famous characters like [[Snoopy]], (2006) and other cartoon characters like [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]] and [[Minnie Mouse]], (2008) have been especially popular in their celebrated years.

Addressing is generally done by hand, and is an opportunity to demonstrate one's handwriting (see ''[[shodō]]''). The postcards may have spaces for the sender to write a personal message. Blank cards are available, so people can hand-write or draw their own. Rubber stamps with conventional messages and with the annual animal are on sale at department stores and other outlets, and many people buy [[ink brushes]] for personal greetings. Special printing devices are popular, especially among people who practice crafts. Software also lets artists create their own designs and output them using their computer's color printer. Because a gregarious individual might have hundreds to write, print shops offer a wide variety of sample postcards with short messages so that the sender has only to write addresses. Even with the rise in popularity of email, the ''nengajō'' remains very popular in Japan, although the younger generation hardly send any cards, preferring to exchange digital greetings using their mobile phones. In recent years this digital greeting preference is gradually accepted among the society.

Conventional greetings include:
*{{nihongo|''kotoshi mo yoroshiku o-negai-shimasu''|今年もよろしくお願いします}} (I hope for your favour again in the coming year)
*{{nihongo|''(shinnen) akemashite o-medetō-gozaimasu''|(新年)あけましておめでとうございます}} (Happiness to you on the dawn [of a New Year])

==Otoshidama==
[[Image:Otoshidama93.JPG|thumb|Pouch for giving money called {{nihongo3||お年玉袋|otoshidama-bukuro}}.]]

On New Year's Day, Japanese people have a custom of giving money to children, known as ''otoshidama''. It is handed out in small decorated envelopes called ''pochibukuro'', similar to [[Shūgi-bukuro]] or Chinese [[red envelope|hóngbāo]] and to the Scottish [[handsel]]. In the Edo period large stores and wealthy families gave out a small bag of mochi and a [[Mandarin orange]] to spread happiness all around. The amount of money given depends on the age of the child but is usually the same if there is more than one child so that no one feels slighted. It is not uncommon for amounts greater than ¥5,000 (US $47.16) to be given.

==Poetry==
The New Year traditions are also a part of [[Japanese poetry]], including [[haiku]] (poems with 17 syllables, in three lines of five, seven and five) and [[renga]] (linked poetry). All of the traditions above would be appropriate to include in haiku as ''[[kigo]]'' (season words). There are also haiku that celebrate many of the "first" of the New Year, such as the "first [[sun]]" (''hatsuhi'') or "first [[sunrise]]", "first [[laughter]]" (''waraizome''—starting the New Year with a smile is considered a good sign), and first [[dream]] (''[[hatsuyume]]''). Since the traditional New Year was later in the year than the current date, many of these mention the beginning of spring.

Along with the New Year's Day postcard, haiku might mention "first letter" (''hatsudayori''—meaning the first exchange of letters), "first [[calligraphy]]" (''[[kakizome]]''), and "first brush" (''fude hajime'').

==Games==
[[File:Large kite.JPG|thumbnail|Displayed large kite in new year Japan]]
It was also customary to play many New Year's games. These include ''[[hanetsuki]]'', ''takoage'' ([[kite flying]]), ''koma'' ([[top]]), ''[[sugoroku]]'', ''[[fukuwarai]]'' (whereby a blindfolded person places paper parts of a face, such as eyes, eyebrows, a nose and a mouth, on a paper face), and ''[[karuta]]''.

==Entertainment==
There are many shows created as the end-of-year, and beginning-of-year entertainment, and some being a special edition of the regular shows. For many decades, it has been customary to watch the TV show ''[[Kōhaku Uta Gassen]]'' aired on [[NHK]] on New Year's Eve. The show features two teams, red and white, of popular music artists competing against each other.

== Sport ==
The final of the [[Emperor's Cup]], the national [[Association football|association football]] elimination tournament in Japan, takes place on New Year's Day, generally in the [[National Stadium (Tokyo)|Olympic Stadium]] in Tokyo, though it can be moved if the stadium is under renovation. The final has taken place on New Year's Day since 1969 and is usually aired on NHK.

==Beethoven's Ninth==
[[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Ninth Symphony]], with accompanying chorus, is traditionally performed throughout Japan during the New Years season.  In December 2009, for example, there were 55 performances of the symphony by various major orchestras and choirs in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Brasor, Philip, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fm20101224r1.html Japan makes Beethoven's Ninth No. 1 for the holidays]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 24 December 2010, p. 20, retrieved on 24 December 2010; Uranaka, Taiga, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn19991201a5.html Beethoven concert to fete students' wartime sendoff]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 1 December 1999, retrieved on 24 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ninth was introduced to Japan by German prisoners-of-war held in Japan during [[World War I]].  Japanese orchestras, notably the [[NHK Symphony Orchestra]], began performing the symphony in 1925.  During [[World War II]], the [[Empire of Japan|Imperial government]] promoted performances of the symphony, including on New Year's Eve, to encourage allegiance to Japanese nationalism. After the war, orchestras and choruses, undergoing economic hard times during the reconstruction of Japan, promoted performances of the piece around New Years because of the popularity of the music with the public. In the 1960s, performances of the symphony at New Years became more widespread, including participation by local choirs and orchestras, and established the tradition which continues to this day.&lt;ref&gt;Brasor, Philip, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fm20101224r1.html Japan makes Beethoven's Ninth No. 1 for the holidays]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 24 December 2010, p. 20, retrieved on 24 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Little New Year==

There is also an associated festival of {{Nihongo|'''Little New Year'''|[[wiktionary:小正月|小正月]]|koshōgatsu}}, traditionally celebrating the first full moon of the new year, on the 15th day of the first lunar month (approximately mid-February). This is now sometimes celebrated on January 15, in various respects. The main events of Koshōgatsu are rites and practices praying for a bountiful harvest; {{nihongo|rice gruel with [[adzuki]] beans|小豆粥|azukigayu}} is traditionally eaten in the morning and is involved in the [[Kayu ura|rice gruel divination ceremony]]. Further, New Year decorations are taken down around this date, and some temples hold events, such as at [[Tōrin-in]].

This corresponds to the Chinese [[Lantern Festival]].

[[Image:USNS Comfort.jpg|thumb|right|The [[USNS Comfort|USNS ''Comfort'']]  takes on supplies en route to aid victims of Hurricane Katrina.]]

'''Joint [[Task force|Task Force]] Katrina''' was a joint [[Military operation|operation]] between the [[United States Department of Defense]] and the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] created on September 1, 2005 at [[Camp Shelby]], [[Mississippi]] to organize [[relief]] efforts along the [[Gulf Coast]] in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]]. The operation was headed by [[U.S. Army]] [[Lieutenant General]] [[Russel L. Honoré]]. Joint Task Force Katrina took over operations from [[United States Northern Command]] that had some elements in place before Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast.

Included in this was a joint mission of USAF Reserve Security Forces personnel at [[Kelly Air Force Base]], San Antonio, Texas.  Their mission was to protect Air Force resources and personnel if the displaced persons being housed in shelters at Kelly AFB were to cause a civil disturbance.

==History==
JTF Katrina was established the day after Hurricane Katrina finished its path through the Gulf coast. It was established on September 1, 2005 to coordinate the Department of Defense (DOD) and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) relief plans for the areas effected by Hurricane Katrina. At its creation Joint Task Force Katrina had about 7,000 National Guardsmen in Mississippi, 10,000 in Alabama, 6,500 in Louisiana,and 8,200 in Florida ready for duty. These troops had originally been put in place by Northern Command. First actions taken were flying helicopters for medical- evacuations that were started on September 1. The aircraft for these operations came from across the United States. Some came from as far as California to help in the relief effort. Pilots of these aircraft orders ranged from flying along the coastline looking for survivors and transporting food, water, and medical supplies to all of the refuge camps across the Gulf.

Numerous Naval ships were sent to assist in the aid of the Gulf. for instance the Iwo Jima amphibious Readiness Group sailed from Virginia which consisted of the [[USS Iwo Jima (LHD-7)]], [[USS Shreveport (LPD-12)]], [[USS Tortuga (LSD-46)]] and [[USNS Arctic (T-AOE-8)]]. The ships were loaded with disaster response equipment which went to Louisiana. In addition, the [[USNS Comfort (T-AH-20)]] came from Maryland to give medical supplies to the relief effort. The USS Grapple also was called in to do underwater salvaging of flooded areas throughout the Gulf coast.

Multiple working staging areas were set up on multiple air force bases that included Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama; Naval Air Station Meridian, Mississippi; Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana ; Alexandria, Louisiana; and Fort Polk, Louisiana. These were set up to speed up movement of supplies and soldiers to get to needed areas. Joint Task Force Katrina eventually was relocated from Camp Shelby to the Iwo Jima that was in port in New Orleans. The United States Military also had 355 helicopters and 93 planes to the relief effort. Not including the 63,000 Active Soldiers that were also contributing to the cause.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Omaha Riot Building.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Mobs overrunning the [[Douglas County Courthouse (Omaha)|Douglas County Courthouse]] in [[Downtown Omaha]] during the [[Omaha Race Riot of 1919]].]] --&gt;

The following is a '''list of riots and civil unrest in [[Omaha, Nebraska]]'''. With its [[Economics in Omaha|economic roots]] in [[Omaha Stockyards|cattle processing]], [[meatpacking]], [[Railroads in Omaha|railroads]], manufacturing and [[Jobbing house|jobbing]], the [[history of Omaha]] has events typical of struggles in other cities over early 20th-century industrialization and [[The labor problem|labor problems]]. [[Racial tension in Omaha, Nebraska|Racial tension]] was deeply based in economic and social competition as older immigrants had to contend with different ethnic groups from eastern and southern Europe and African Americans from the South. The latter were recruited for jobs in the expanding meatpacking plants as [[World War I]] shut off immigration from Europe. While numerous African Americans migrated to the city in its growing industrial phase, they were a distinct minority within the overall state population.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen and Cotrell. (2002) ''Omaha: The Gate City.'' University of Nebraska Press. p 172.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Civil disorder]] in Omaha has related to the most critical events and tensions of an era, from showing support of [[homeless]] people in the 1890s; to anti-[[strikebreaker]] sentiment, focused on new Japanese residents at the turn of the 20th century; to [[anti-war]] events in the 1970s. The 1960s [[urban riots|inner-city riots]] that destroyed parts of the [[Near North Side (Omaha, Nebraska)|Near North Side neighborhood]] were another manifestation of social and economic tension breaking out in violence.

Often the violence did little to resolve the problems at their roots: for instance, labor inequities were persistent because of major industries' opposition to unionizing and insistence on "[[open shop]]" policies into the 1940s and beyond. Just as workers were finally achieving some successes, industries underwent major restructuring, causing loss of tens of thousands of jobs and movement of industrial work away from Omaha, stranding many in the working classes for some time.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen and Cotrell. (2002) ''Omaha: The Gate City.'' University of Nebraska Press. p 135.&lt;/ref&gt; The challenges facing [[African Americans in Omaha, Nebraska|African Americans in Omaha]] with regard to economic inequity and social immobility also persist but the form has varied with social and economic changes.&lt;ref name="Luebtke, F.C. 2005 p. 334"&gt;Luebtke, F.C. (2005) ''Nebraska: An Illustrated History. University of Nebraska Press. p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Racial tension in Omaha, Nebraska|racial tension]] persists in part because of problems with crime arising from dysfunctions of poverty, entwined issues of class and race, and the relative geographic and social isolation of some of the minority communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kmtv.com/Global/story.asp?S=6676838 "The U.S. Justice Department Says Omaha Has Racial Tension"], KMTV.com.

==19th century==
In the late 19th century civil unrest in Omaha was chiefly related to [[labor dispute]]s that arose with industrialization. During the 1880s and '90s, the [[Governor of Nebraska]] repeatedly sent in the [[state militia]] during labor disputes in the [[smelting]], railroad and meatpacking house industries.&lt;ref name="Luebtke, F.C. 2005 p 134"&gt;Luebtke, F.C. (2005) ''Nebraska: An Illustrated History. University of Nebraska Press. p 134.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895 the [[American Protective Association]] threatened large-scale riots throughout the city after Nebraska state law forced a complete alteration of the police and fire boards in the city.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1895/08/02/102467559.pdf "A.P.A. makes trouble"], ''New York Times.''

==20th century==
Social tensions related to two [[world war]]s and several labor disputes resulted in violent upheavals in the first half of the 20th century, including the lynching of a black man in Omaha, followed by a race riot in 1919. The first recorded incidences of recorded [[racial discrimination]] occurred, pitting [[White people|whites]] against Japanese and Greek immigrants. The emerging [[Civil rights movement in Omaha, Nebraska|civil rights movement in Omaha]] raised expectations and the Vietnam War produced its own tensions. In the 1960s, African Americans violently protested in several different events, reacting against police brutality and other issues.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

| Labor dispute

The company hired [[strikebreaker]]s from [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]]. Within days the company rolled out heavily fortified streetcars, complete with windows covered by heavy wire and armed guards on board. While few cars attracted passengers, the cars initially encountered little resistance. The company resisted calls for [[arbitration]] from the [[Omaha City Council]] and continued employing strikebreakers. In early May violence broke out, with workers' attacking the streetcars and strikebreakers by rifle attacks, violent beatings and bombings across the city. In June riots broke out with mobs' burning streetcars and looting. There were two deaths. The city government lost control of the violence and called in the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]], which sent 1,800 troops. Governor [[Robert Leroy Cochran|Robert Cochran]] declared [[martial law]] and ordered the streetcars to stop running. After the governor intervened and owner Wattles agreed to arbitration, a number of agreements were made with workers' representatives. But no substantive changes were made and strikebreakers stayed on the job. The violence ended, court cases ensued, and the situation slowly faded away.

===Post-World War II===
The aftermath of [[World War II]] brought apparent tranquility to much of the nation. However, in [[working class]] cities such as Omaha, labor unrest continued to weigh heavily on industry while the [[middle class]] was burgeoning. Restructuring of major industries rapidly cost tens of thousands of jobs in Omaha in the railroad and meatpacking industries in the decades after 1950. Members of the working class who could not quickly adapt were isolated in North and South Omaha as the economy retracted. With decreasing revenues, the city and businesses decreased investments in existing housing and infrastructure. At the same time, the city was expanding away from the river, with growth to new suburbs and development in the west, leading to [[white flight]] from many [[inner-city]] neighborhoods. Some new-style white collar jobs migrated to that area as well, or were concentrated in downtown.

The '''Matsuyama Shiroyama Koen Cherry Blossom Festival''' is held every year in early April in [[Matsuyama, Ehime|Matsuyama]], [[Ehime Prefecture]], [[Japan]]. The [[Matsuyama Castle (Iyo)|Matsuyama Castle]] is lit up with paper lanterns at night until 9 PM. 

People eat home-cooked meals or take-out food under the cherry blossom tree, combined with drinking sake, talking and singing songs. The official song for the festival is Sakura Sakura, a traditional Japanese folk song. The preparation is that people have to line the Matsuyama castle with lanterns before the festival begins. It usually goes on for 3 days.

'''Moviemiento - short films on the road''' is a travelling [[film festival|short film festival]] originating in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Moviemiento|publisher= [[Arte]]|url= http://www.arte.tv/fr/moviemiento/902920,CmC=925170.html|language= French|date= 29 July 2005|accessdate= 7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concept ==

Moviemiento is a short film festival without a permanent venue. Instead cities and rural areas are visited along a given route. During the festival tour a [[documentary]] is produced and shown in the current program. [[film screening|Screenings]] are free of charge and generally take place in [[public space]]. Since 2008 besides film screenings the festival organizes other activities like workshops, [[competition|film competitions]] and panel discussions. Often a festival tour has a specific subject. In the 2008 tour ''Moving Baltic Sea'' it was [[environmental protection]]. ''Kinomobilny'' in 2009 had bilateral exchange between Germany and Poland as a topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Wenn der Kinosessel schaukelt|trans-title=When the cinema chair rocks|location= Berlin|newspaper= [[Berliner Morgenpost]]|url= http://www.morgenpost.de/printarchiv/berlin/article1351699/Wenn-der-Kinosessel-schaukelt.html|language= German|first= Sören|last= Kittel|date= 19 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Kino auf Wanderschaft|trans-title=Travelling cinema|location= Berlin|newspaper= [[Der Tagesspiegel]]|url= http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/stadtleben/kurzfilme-kino-auf-wanderschaft/1842850.html|language= German|first= Rita|last= Nikolow|date= 21 May 2010|accessdate= 7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Negros Trade Fair''' is the longest running provincial trade fair started in 1985 by the Manila-based Negrenses who were moved by the news of poverty among the sugar farm workers in [[Negros Island]]. The First Negros Trade Fair was organized at the Makati Carpark at the behest of Bea Zobel from Ayala Land, Inc. with goods coming from backyard industries of Negros. Daniel "Bitay" Lacson, Jr., then [[Negros Navigation]] President and CEO, shipped the goods from Bacolod to Manila for free. The movement later grew as Bitay Lacson was appointed as OIC Governor of [[Negros Occidental]] and was re-elected into office.

This annual trade fair became a precursor for a vision to organize a formal association to consolidate the then fledgling individual producers. The Association of Negros Producers (ANP) was formed and registered in 1988 with the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]], incorporated by the so-called "14+1" from the fourteen housewives and one gentleman who became incorporators of ANP. From then on, the task of organizing the annual Negros Trade Fair was passed on to the newly formed association.

== Exhibition Categories ==
The producer exhibitors from the Association of Negros Producers (ANP) are divided among the following:

* Food
* Gifts and Housewares
* Fashion
* Natural and Organic
* Furniture and Furnishing
* Tourism

The name Palladian comes from [[Athena|Pallas]] and refers to wisdom and learning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yourdictionary.com/palladian Palladian - Definition at the #1 Online Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is of no relation to the architectural [[Palladian architecture|palladian style]] of [[Andrea Palladio]].

==History==

In 1891 [[Léo Taxil]] (Gabriel Jogand-Pagès) and Adolphe Ricoux claimed to have discovered a Palladian Society.&lt;ref&gt;Waite, Arthur Edward ''The Hermetic Museum'' 2006 Lulu&lt;/ref&gt; An 1892 French book ''Le Diable au XIXe siècle'' (The Devil in the 19th Century", 1892), written by "Dr. Bataille" (actually Jogand-Pagès himself)&lt;ref&gt;Characterised by Waite as "a perfervid narrative issued in penny numbers with absurd illustrations of a highly sensational type; in a word, Le Diable au XIXe Siècle, which is the title given to his memoirs by the present witness, connects in manner and appearance with that class of literature which is known as the "[[penny dreadful]]." (Waite, ''Devil Worship in France'', ch. VII ([http://www.sacred-texts.com/evil/dwf/dwf09.htm on-line text]).&lt;/ref&gt; alleged that Palladists were Satanists based in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], headed by the American [[Freemason]] [[Albert Pike]] and created by the Italian liberal patriot and author [[Giuseppe Mazzini]].&lt;ref&gt;p.204 Hastings, James, Editor ''Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics'', Vol. 12 Varda Books&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arthur Edward Waite]], debunking the existence of the group in ''Devil-Worship in France, or The Question of Lucifer'', ch. II: "The Mask of Masonry" (London, 1896),&lt;ref&gt;[http://bulfinch.englishatheist.org/Devil-Worship-France.htm#Page_22 On-line text]&lt;/ref&gt; reports according to "the works of Domenico Margiotta and Dr Bataille" that "[t]he Order of Palladium founded in Paris 20 May 1737 or Sovereign  Council of Wisdom" was a [[Anti-Masonry|"Masonic diabolic order"]].  Dr. Bataille asserted that women would supposedly be initiated as "Companions of Penelope".&lt;ref&gt;Reported word-for-word in [[Lewis Spence]], ''[[An Encyclopaedia of Occultism]]'', 1920 (reprinted 2006) p.314&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;As seen in the blurb for [http://www.sacred-texts.com/evil/dwf/index.htm The Internet Sacred Text Archive edition of Devil Worship in France] and the [http://www.sacred-texts.com/evil/dwf/dwf17.htm conclusion], Waite was '''debunking''' the story of Palladists&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dr. Bataille, the society had two orders, "Adelph" and "Companion of Ulysses"; however, the society was broken up by French law enforcement a few years after its founding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.witchvox.com/whs/dt_whs.html?aid=cabc&amp;id=8981 "Pagan Protection Center" website]&lt;/ref&gt; 

A supposed [[Diana Vaughan]] published ''Confessions of an Ex-Palladist'' in 1895. On April 19, 1897, Léo Taxil called a press conference at which, he claimed, he would introduce Diana Vaughan to the press. At the conference instead he announced that his revelations about the Freemasons were fictitious. He thanked the Catholic [[clergy]] for their assistance in giving publicity to his wild claims.&lt;ref name=Confession&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
The Palladists are the name of the [[Greenwich Village]] [[Satanist]] society in [[Val Lewton]]'s film ''[[The Seventh Victim]]''.

The Palladists play a major role in the latter part of [[Umberto Eco]]'s novel ''[[The Prague Cemetery]]'' (2011).

'''''Seein' Red, White 'N' Blue''''' is a 1943 American cartoon short featuring [[Popeye]], directed by [[Dan Gordon (animator)|Dan Gordon]]. The cartoon revolves around [[Bluto]] trying to escape [[Conscription in the United States|the draft]] but ends up fighting alongside Popeye against some Japanese spies, [[Hirohito]] and [[Adolf Hitler]].

==Plot==
While Bluto is busy at work in his stable he receives a letter calling him for his draft service in the Navy. Bluto is very reluctant to join in and pretends to be ill. Popeye, who works at the draft bureau, is suspicious and sends a female dummy in to create an enthusiastic reaction from him. Even though his trick works Bluto still refuses to join the Navy. In a desperate effort to become disabled Bluto jumps out of the window, followed by Popeye who tries to catch him. They both crash deep into the ground, in fact so deep that [[Satan]] himself asks them to leave [[Hell]]. After Bluto and Popeye have climbed out of the massive crater Satan is kicked by an angel, after which they both disappear.

Bluto tries to flee, but is hit in a car accident. Even though he is knocked out the ambulance is only interested in the tires of the vehicle and carries these away on a stretcher instead of Bluto. Bluto tries to get hit by a falling [[safe]] instead, but again Popeye rescues him. This angers Bluto so much that he locks Popeye inside the object and then throws it away. It crashes inside an orphanage, where several [[Imperial Japanese Army]] spies are undercover, dressed as babies. While Popeye is being beaten by the spies, Bluto drops by to inform him that his arms are bandaged and that he finally will be able to escape the draft. When Bluto sees that Popeye is in trouble, he tries to help, but both men are knocked out by the Japanese. While they are being ridiculed, Popeye grabs his spinach, eats it and gives some to Bluto (can and all). Both men defeat the Japanese and Popeye's fist reaches so far that he knocks out [[Hirohito]]. The Emperor is hit so hard that he falls on the backside of his horse, (creating a pun on the word ''"[[Buttocks|ass]]")'', and says: ''"It should happen to [[Hitler]]!"'' Sure enough, the next scene cuts to Hitler, who gives a speech by saying: ''"B.O.!"'' ("body odor", a reference to a [[Lifebuoy]] soap commercial). Hitler too is beaten so hard that he loses his mustache. A title card appears, asking: ''"Is there a doctor in the house?"'', with the word ''"doctor"'' crossed out and ''"undertaker"'' written in crayon. While he lies unconscious, [[Hermann Göring]] runs in and asks his Führer melodramatically ''"to speak to him"''. Hitler just says ''"B.O."'' again, whereupon Göring pulls his face away in disgust.

The cartoon concludes with Bluto finally signing up for his draft. When Bluto asks how to spell his own name, the imprisoned Japanese spies sing "B-L-U-T-O", in reference to the commercial jingle for [[Jell-o]] from that time.

==About the cartoon==
The cartoon is notable for being one of the few where Bluto and Popeye actually fight together to beat a common foe. Because of its dated references to World War II and offensive racial stereotyping of Japanese people, it's no longer shown on American television.

The style of the cartoon is more reminiscent of a [[Looney Tunes]] or [[Tex Avery]] cartoon, with wild, frenetic takes and [[fourth wall]] breaking gags geared at adults. Some of the jokes, like the use of the phrase "B.O." were used in a lot of [[Looney Tunes]] cartoons as well. This cartoon's score also features an excerpt of the tune of ''[[I Don't Want To Walk Without You]]'' which was first heard onscreen in Paramount's movie ''[[Sweater Girl]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5263">'''Spies for Peace''' was a British group of anti-war activists associated with  the [[Committee of 100 (United Kingdom)|Committee of 100]] who publicized government preparations for rule after a nuclear war.  In 1963 they broke into a secret government bunker, [[Regional Seat of Government]] Number 6 (RSG-6) at [[Warren Row]], near [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], where they photographed and copied documents. The RSGs were to include representatives of all the central government departments, to maintain law and order, communicate with the surviving population and control remaining resources. The public were virtually unaware what the government was planning for the aftermath of a nuclear war until it was revealed by Spies for Peace.&lt;ref name="Walter2013"&gt;{{cite news|last=Walter|first=Natasha|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/apr/13/protest-optimism-anarchists-nuclear-beans|title=Protest in an age of optimism: the 60s anarchists who spilled nuclear secrets|work=The Guardian|date=13 April 2013|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They published this information in a pamphlet, ''Danger! Official Secret RSG-6''. Four thousand copies were sent to the national press, politicians and peace movement activists and copies were distributed on the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]]'s Easter march from [[Atomic Weapons Establishment|Aldermaston]].

The pamphlet said it was "about a small group of people who have accepted [[thermonuclear war]] as a probability, and are consciously and carefully planning for it. ...  They are quietly waiting for the day the bomb drops, for that will be the day they take over."  It listed the RSGs and gave their telephone numbers. Most of the pamphlet was about RSG-6, which Spies for Peace described in detail.  They said that "RSG-6 is not a centre for [[civil defence]]. It is a centre for ''[[Stratocracy|military government]]''", and they listed the personnel who were to staff it.  The pamphlet  described emergency planning exercises in which RSG-6 had been activated, including a [[NATO]] exercise in September 1962, FALLEX-62. Spies for Peace asserted that the exercise demonstrated the incapacity of the public services to cope with the consequences of nuclear attack and that the RSG system would not work.
The exercise, they said, "proved once and for all the truth of the 1957 Defence [[White Paper]] that ''there is no defence against nuclear war''." In a hint at the source of their information, Spies for Peace said that FALLEX-62  "convinced at least ''one'' occupant of one RSG at least that the deterrent is quite futile". The pamphlet claimed that at the time of the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], a month after the NATO exercise, RSG-6 was not activated.

The authors objected strongly to the fact that the RSG network had not been publicly debated, that its staff were unelected and that they would have military powers.&lt;ref&gt;''Danger! Official Secret RSG-6'', Committee of 100, July 1963&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1963 Aldermaston issue of the CND bulletin ''Sanity'' included the Spies for Peace revelations and several hundred demonstrators left the Aldermaston route and headed for RSG-6 where they set up a picket.  Spies for Peace made front page news but the press was later advised by an official "[[DA-Notice|D-Notice]]" from saying any more about the matter.  The police tried to prevent any further distribution of the information but failed to do so.  RSGs in Cambridge and Edinburgh were also picketed.

Although several people were arrested, the original spies were not identified or caught. After [[Nicolas Walter]] died, it was revealed in 2002 by his daughter [[Natasha Walter]] that her father was one of the Spies for Peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Walter|first=Natasha|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/node/198271|title=The NS Essay - How my father spied for peace|work=New Statesman|date=20 May 2002|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was revealed in 2013 with her consent, again by their daughter, that Ruth, Walter's wife, was also a member of the group.&lt;ref name="Walter2013"/&gt;

The '''Twelve Grapes'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000175619|title=Hemeroteca Digital. Biblioteca Nacional de España|website=hemerotecadigital.bne.es|access-date=2018-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Spanish language|Sp]]. ''Las doce uvas de la suerte'', "The twelve grapes of luck") is a [[Spain|Spanish]] tradition that dates back from at least 1895&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=La Correspondencia de España |location=Madrid |volume=XLVII |issue=13.844 |date=1 January 1896 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; but became established in 1909. In December of that year, some [[alicante]]se vine growers popularized this custom to better sell huge amounts of [[grape]]s from an excellent harvest.

The tradition consists of eating a grape with each [[Bell (instrument)|bell]] strike at midnight of December 31. According to the tradition, that leads to a year of prosperity.&lt;ref name="Spicer"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fMuqhSpY6u8C |title=Festivals of Western Europe |first=Dorothy Gladys |last=Spicer |year=2008 |publisher=[[BiblioBazaar]] |date=22 February 2008 |pages=256 |isbn=9781437520163}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some areas, it is believed that the tradition wards away witches and general evil,&lt;ref name="Spicer"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wZsguJDgxRoC |title=Celebrations: a joyous guide to the holidays from past to present |first=Jim |last=McCann |author-link=Jim McCann (writer) |first2=Jeanne |last2=Benedict |year=2001 |publisher=[[Penguin Group]] (USA) Incorporated |pages=161 |isbn=9781557883735}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this "magic" is treated like an old heritage, and in modern days it's viewed as a cultural tradition to welcome the new year.

There are two main places where people gather to eat the grapes: with family after the dinner or in the main squares around the country, the [[Puerta del Sol]] in [[Madrid]] being the most famous place to do it.

The twelve grapes are linked to the [[Puerta del Sol]] tower clock, where this tradition started and from where the change of year is always broadcast.

This tradition was also adopted in places with a broad cultural relation with [[Spain]] and Latin American countries, as well as Hispanic communities in the [[United States]]. The [[Philippines]] has adopted the tradition as well.

This [[tradition]] is part of the Hispanic [[Christmas]] festivities.

'''''V-Tech Rampage''''' is a controversial amateur [[action game|action]] [[video game]] that recreates the 2007 [[Virginia Tech shooting]] on the campus of [[Virginia Tech]] in [[Blacksburg, Virginia|Blacksburg]], [[Virginia]], [[United States]]. The game was created by 21-year-old Ryan Lambourn from [[Australia]].&lt;ref name="Sydney_interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/games/outrage-over-virginia-tech-game/2007/05/16/1178995212668.html |title=Outrage over Virginia Tech game - Games - Technology |publisher=smh.com.au |date=2007-05-16 |accessdate=2013-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Adobe Flash|Flash]]-based game came to light when it was uploaded to [[Newgrounds]] using Lambourn's screen name Master PiGPEN.

The previous prominent virtual [[school shooting]] reenactment, ''[[Super Columbine Massacre RPG!]]'', is a [[role-playing video game]] and has received praise for artistic merit as well as condemnation. ''V-Tech Rampage'' was created to be offensive&lt;ref name="DT_interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/virtual-school-shootings-interviewing-two-of-the-most-hated-game-creators-alive-31610.phtml |title=Virtual school shootings: interviewing two of the most hated game creators alive |publisher=Destructoid |date= |accessdate=2013-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
without redeeming value.&lt;ref name="Sydney_interview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DT_interview" /&gt;

In 2013, Lambourn caused further controversy with his game ''The Slaying Of Sandy Hook Elementary'', which re-created the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]].&lt;ref name="Outrage"&gt;{{cite web|author=Baier, Bret |url=http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/special-report-bret-baier/blog/2013/11/20/outrage-over-sandy-hook-shooting-video-game|title=Outrage Over Sandy Hook Shooting Video Game |publisher=Fox News |date=2013-11-20 |accessdate=2013-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike ''V-Tech Rampage'', however, ''The Slaying Of Sandy Hook Elementary'' was created to support [[gun politics in the United States|gun control laws]].&lt;ref name="Critics Furious"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/11/20/critics-furious-over-online-game-reenacting-sandy-hook-massacre/|title=Critics Furious Over Online Game Re-Enacting Sandy Hook Massacre |publisher=CBS New York |date=2013-11-20 |accessdate=2013-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
The game is a one-person work released weeks{{how much|date=October 2018}} after the Virginia Tech massacre. Its graphics and control are both intentionally and amusingly clumsy. The player controls [[Seung-Hui Cho]], the killer, through "3 levels of stealth and murder!" in a slanted overhead view. In the first level, the player must walk across Virginia Tech campus to shoot Emily J. Hilscher, Cho's real life first victim, without killing too many other people or scaring Emily away. Emily's death is witnessed by Ryan Clark, Cho's second victim, who also must be killed. In the second, he must walk across the same campus while avoiding the searchlights of police investigators. This is the only section with appreciable challenge. In the third, he barricades the exit of a school building and must shoot everyone inside in 90 seconds before the police arrive to arrest him. During this level, a song created by Lambourn plays while audio clips praise or laugh at murder, or scold the player for merely wounding. [[Liviu Librescu]] is the only real victim to appear in this segment. The game finishes with Cho's suicide, which occurs when the player presses the shoot button.

Cho monologues about mission goals and can also speak to other characters, whose reactions differ depending on whether they're fleeing Cho or not. The game's dialogue has occasional grammar or spelling errors, and is riddled with obscenities, insults, racist terms, scatological references and offers of sex from female characters in exchange for their lives.

==Events==
Lambourn offered to remove the game if he received $2,000 in "donations." For an additional $1,000, he offered to apologize.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Attention angry people: I will take this game down from newgrounds (the games website) if the donation amount reaches $1000 US. I'll take it down from here [his website] if it reaches $2000 US, and I will apologise if it reaches $3000 US.&lt;ref name="Sydney_interview"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lambourn later retracted the offer to remove the game, stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...the donation thing is there as a joke against all the people commanding me to take my game down. I didn't think anyone would donate money to it and so far my paypal account has proven me right...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gamepolitics.com/2007/05/15/v-tech-rampage-creator-demands-payment-to-remove-game/ |title=V-Tech Rampage Creator Demands Payment to Remove Game |publisher=GamePolitics |date= |accessdate=2013-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2013, a "[[RIAA]] edition" was created, with the original tracks removed, due to copyright infringement with the RIAA. This has replaced the original version on Newgrounds, The original edition was until recently available on Lambourn's site, however it has since been removed due to further threats from the RIAA. Now the RIAA edition is the only available one on his site, with the title music "Hey, Hey, Hey, Fuck The RIAA" on a looped track. However the unedited version can still be found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gameswtf.com/2262/Virginia_Tech_Shooting_Game/Action_Games/free_flash_game.html |title=Virginia Tech Shooting Game |publisher=Gameswtf.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesforwork.com/games/play-5635-Virginia_Tech_Rampage-Flash_Game |title=Virginia Tech Rampage Games - Over 20,000 Free Games - 10 Added Every Weekday |publisher=Gamesforwork.com |date=2007-06-20 |accessdate=2013-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://googumproduce.com/flash/vtech.swf |title=V-Tech Rampage : InstructionS |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=2013-10-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209085128/http://googumproduce.com/flash/vtech.swf |archivedate=February 9, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The MP3 of the music in question can also be acquired.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070620234353/http://googumproduce.com/musicdl.php?n=kekeke]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
The game was compared to ''[[Super Columbine Massacre RPG!]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogcritics.org/archives/2007/05/14/152155.php ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070521204518/http://blogcritics.org/archives/2007/05/14/152155.php |date=May 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the re-creation of a mass murder in which the player controls the killer through a video game. [[Danny Ledonne]], creator of ''Super Columbine Massacre RPG!'' posted a comment on Lambourn's website:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Inevitably, comparisons between [''Super Columbine Massacre RPG!''] and [''V-Tech Rampage''] are being made right now... For myself I wish to point out that [''Super Columbine Massacre RPG!''] was never a for-profit endeavor and thus I never posted statements like that which is on the [''V-Tech Rampage''] game's homepage (...) I would like to ask bloggers to consider not whether a game about the Virginia Tech shooting SHOULD be made but how we might go about making a game that accomplishes more than [''V-Tech Rampage''] does with the subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gamepolitics.com/2007/05/15/super-columbine-creator-comments-on-v-tech-game/ |title=Super Columbine Creator Comments on V-Tech Game |publisher=GamePolitics |date= |accessdate=2013-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

New York State Senator [[Andrew Lanza]], chair of the Senate Task Force on Youth Violence and the Entertainment Industry requested that the gaming community boycott the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Arendt |first=Susan |url=http://blog.wired.com/games/2007/05/new_york_senato.html |title=New York Senator Criticizes V-Tech Rampage, GTA IV &amp;#124; Game&amp;#124;Life &amp;#124; Wired.com |publisher=Blog.wired.com |date=2007-05-17 |accessdate=2013-10-26 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013073625/http://blog.wired.com/games/2007/05/new_york_senato.html |archivedate=October 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, video game publications wrote of concerns about backlashes against video games and wrote that this game was created by an individual, not the gaming industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.silive.com/news/advance/index.ssf?/base/news/1179402340128350.xml&amp;coll=1 |title=Staten Island Advance Print Edition - - Staten Island Advance |publisher=SILive.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[GamesRadar]].com ranked the game as 4th in the ''Top 7 Most Evil Games''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/the-top-7-most-evil-games/ |title=The Top 7... Most Evil Games |publisher=GamesRadar |date=2012-06-23 |accessdate=2013-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Vasylkiv terrorists case''' is an alleged terror plot of three far-right activists ("the [[Vasylkiv]] terrorists"&lt;ref name=IUVt13114/&gt;) trying to blow up a [[statue of Lenin]] in the Ukrainian city [[Boryspil]] in August 2011.&lt;ref name=BLb11114EN&gt;[http://www.euronews.com/2014/01/11/dozens-hurt-as-fresh-clashes-erupt-in-ukraine/ Dozens hurt as fresh clashes erupt in Ukraine], [[Euronews]] (11 January 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; The statue was removed in June 2011.&lt;ref name=VT25112tUW/&gt; The three suspects were arrested on 22 August 2011.&lt;ref name=BLb11114RT/&gt;&lt;ref name=AVTIU23811/&gt;

Allegedly Volodymyr Shpara, [[Ihor Mosiychuk]] and Serhiy Bevza had plotted to blow up [[statue of Lenin]] in Boryspil on [[Independence Day of Ukraine]] on 24 August 2011.&lt;ref name=BLb11114RT&gt;[http://rt.com/news/ukraine-trial-protest-clashes-460/ Ukraine ex-minister injured as terror trial protesters clash with riot police], [[RT (TV network)]] (11 January 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Shpara, Mosiychuk and Bevza were arrested on 22 August 2011 by the [[Security Service of Ukraine]] (SBU), after the SBU discovered a home-made explosive device and extremist leaflets in the office of "[[Patriot of Ukraine (organization)|Patriot of Ukraine]]" organisation in [[Vasylkiv]] in a premises owned by Vasylkiv City Council.&lt;ref name=BLb11114RT/&gt;&lt;ref name=AVTIU23811&gt;[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/77439.html SBU opens criminal case against 'Vasylkiv terrorists'], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (23 August 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Shpara, Mosiychuk and Bevza denied the accusations and accused law enforcers of planting the bomb and leaflets on them.&lt;ref name=BLb11114RT/&gt;&lt;ref name=AVTIU23811/&gt; According to SBU spokeswoman Maryna Ostapenko (as stated on 23 August 2011) "In addition to the explosive device, SBU officers also found a huge number of leaflets calling for extremist actions. The seized electronic medium containing a video showing schemes for blocking public institutions and producing improvised explosive devices, and one of the [[Directory (computing)|folders]] even contains videos of [[child pornography]]".&lt;ref name=AVTIU23811/&gt; Initially the SBU suspected a plot to detonate a bomb during the celebration of Ukraine's Independence Day in [[Kiev]].&lt;ref name=AVTIU23811/&gt; Before the alleged plot was discovered the Boryspil City Council had voted to remove the (alleged target) Lenin statue.&lt;ref name=BLb11114NYT/&gt; The statue of Lenin in Boryspil was removed in June 2011 by the city's authorities.&lt;ref name=VT25112tUW&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://tyzhden.ua/News/40353 "Васильківським терористам" приписують намір підірвати неіснуючий пам’ятник Леніну ''Vasylkiv terrorists being charged with an attempt to blow up a non-existing monument''], [[The Ukrainian Week]] (25 January 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protests (on 10 January 2014)==
The sentencing of the three suspected bomb plotters on 10 January 2014 sparked violent clashes between the [[Ukrainian police]] and about 100 protesters that had gathered at the courthouse in [[Kiev]] for the verdict.&lt;ref name=BLb11114EN/&gt;&lt;ref name=BLb11114NYT/&gt;&lt;ref name=BLb11114BBCN/&gt; The clash between police and protesters lasted overnight until 2&amp;nbsp;a.m. on 11 January 2014.&lt;ref name=BLb11114KP/&gt; The protesters had denounced the prosecution of the three men as politically motivated and a show trial.&lt;ref name=BLb11114NYT/&gt; After the verdict they blocked the courthouse exit in an attempt to prevent police from taking the three convicts to prison.&lt;ref name=BLb11114LAT&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/world/worldnow/la-fg-wn-ukraine-opposition-leader-20140111,0,3338928.story#axzz2q2LeQTMX Ukraine opposition leader injured in clash with police], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' (11 January 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; After police had broken through the crowd protesters along the route then blocked the vehicles that attempted to transport the convicts by surrounding them with private cars and puncturing tires.&lt;ref name=BLb11114LAT/&gt; More police buses with at least 400 riot police then arrived.&lt;ref name=BLb11114LAT/&gt; The following clashes between police and protesters left dozens of people injured,&lt;ref name=BLb11114EN/&gt; including former [[Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine|Minister of Internal Affairs]] [[Yuriy Lutsenko]].&lt;ref name=BLb11114EN/&gt; (Who had arrived at the courthouse after the 400 riot police had arrived.&lt;ref name=BLb11114LAT/&gt;) According to Lutsenko's wife Iryna her husband had been attacked by police as he tried to break up the violence.&lt;ref name=BLb11114BBCN&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-25692076 Ukraine ex-minister Lutsenko hurt in clashes in Kiev], [[BBC News]] (11 January 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Lutsenko was hospitalised in an intensive care ward.&lt;ref name=BLb11114EN/&gt; According to MP from [[Svoboda (party)|Svoboda]] [[Yuriy Syrotiuk]] over ten activists, several journalists and three fellow MPs and Svoboda party members ([[Eduard Leonov]], [[Yuriy Bublyk]] and [[Pavlo Kyrylenko]]) were injured.&lt;ref name=Berkut10114&gt;[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/185432.html Three MPs, over dozen activists seriously injured in clash with Berkut, says Svoboda], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (11 January 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; According to Syrotiuk the [[Berkut (Ukraine)|Berkut]] [[riot police]] had violated official instructions and had hit people's heads.&lt;ref name=Berkut10114/&gt; 20 Berkut were injured; one with a broken leg.&lt;ref name=BLb11114RT/&gt;

The event took place amid ongoing [[Euromaidan]] anti-government rallies.&lt;ref name=BLb11114EN/&gt; Just before the event took place, the Automaidan movement had blockaded buses carrying policemen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/185422.html Ex-Ukrainian interior minister Lutsenko injured in clash with police, hospitalized – statement], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (11 January 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions on protests==
European Union and US officials condemned the violence against demonstrators.&lt;ref name=BLb11114KP/&gt; US Ambassador to Ukraine [[Geoffrey R. Pyatt]] stated "[[Yuriy Lutsenko]] will be remembered as hero of EuroMaidan" (for trying to intervene in the confrontation between police and protesters).&lt;ref name=BLb11114KP/&gt;

According to the Ukrainian authorities the verdict of 10 January had nothing to do with [[Euromaidan]], but according to the [[Ukrainian Foreign Ministry]] "Some MPs, hiding behind their status as [[People's Deputy of Ukraine|people's deputies of Ukraine]], entered into a violent confrontation with police, blocked the courthouse and the roadway around it. At the same time, the results of a medical examination of those who suffered in clashes with the police reveal some facts of them being in a state of [[alcoholic intoxication]]. This also concerns one prominent opposition politician".&lt;ref name=IUVt13114/&gt;

Ukraine's (then) ruling [[Party of Regions]] condemned the "assault" on the court and accused Svoboda of  "provocation".&lt;ref name=BLb11114RT/&gt; The party said in a statement on 11 January 2013 "It's perplexing that those who support [[European values]], and a [[Ukraine–European Union relations|European path for Ukraine]], support terrorists. The Party of Regions condemns any terrorist activities or plotting such activities".&lt;ref name=BLb11114RT/&gt;

The [[Judicial system of Ukraine#Prosecution|prosecutor's office of Kiev]] launched a probe into allegations of [[abuse of authority]] by riot police officers the day following the riots.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctvnews.ca/world/opposition-leader-yuri-lutsenko-injured-in-clashes-in-ukrainian-capital-1.1634667 Opposition leader Yuri Lutsenko injured in clashes in Ukrainian capital], [[CTV News]] (11 January 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/185401.html Kyiv prosecutor opens criminal case on abuse of power by Berkut police in recent clashes], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (11 January 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;
