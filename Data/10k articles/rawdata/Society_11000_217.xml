      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4183">On the night of  28 October 2014, at 22.00 the [[Republic of Macedonia]] government building was attacked with what is believed to have been two [[rocket propelled grenade]]s (RPG), damaging the walls and roof of the building.

'''Mir Ali Murad Talpur''', known as the ''Aadil-i-Jang'', was the second ruler of the Mankani [[Talpur]]s state of Mirpurkhas. He founded [[Mirpurkhas]] town in 1806 and made it the capital of his state which was founded by his father, [[Mir Tharo Khan Talpur]] at Keti Mir Tharo. His state included territories of the present day southeastern [[Sindh]]. His son, [[Mir Sher Muhammad Talpur]] pioneered the freedom struggle of Sindh after the fall of [[Hyderabad, Pakistan|Hyderabad]] in February 1843 at the hands of British invaders.

This article describes some views of notable Orthodox Jewish figures who supported [[anarchism]], as well as various themes within the scope of the Orthodox Jewish tradition or among the practicing Orthodox Jews that are generally considered important from the anarchist worldview. As is often the case with pro-anarchist movements and personal anarchist opinions in spiritual traditions, authoritative organized Orthodox Jewish bodies may view some of the views described here as marginal. Anarchism found a number of notable supporters among Orthodox Jews in the first half of the 20th century; on the other hand, a number of notable secular Jewish [[Anti-authoritarianism|anti-authoritarians]] noticed some anarchic tendencies in traditional Judaism.

One post-denominational &lt;ref&gt;http://www.myjewishlearning.com/history/Jewish_World_Today/Denominations/Post-Denominational.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; movement in Judaism, where the views described in this article are common, is [[Jewish Renewal]] or [[Neo-Hasidism]].

While there is no organized [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] [[anarchism|anarchist movement]] similar to [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchist]] movements, a number of pro-anarchistic ideas are found in the works of some [[Kabbalah|Kabbalists]] and [[Hasidism|Hasidic]] teachers, as well as in the Jewish [[folk religion]]. A few Jewish [[Mysticism|mystical]] groups in Antiquity were based on [[anti-authoritarian]] or radically communal principles, somewhat similar to the Christian [[Quakers]], [[Dukhobors]] and other similar movements. Some secular Jewish anarchists, such as [[Abba Gordin]] and [[Walter Benjamin]], were interested in  the connections between anarchism and biblical and Talmudic themes, as well as Jewish mysticism. [[Aharon David Gordon]] and [[Martin Buber]], both of whose ideas were close to anarchism, were former Orthodox Jews and greatly influenced by the Hasidic tradition.

Some [[Jewish anarchism|Jewish anarchists]] of the 20th century explicitly combined contemporary radical thought with traditional Judaism, insisting that, in their view, Judaism calls for abolition of the [[State (polity)|state]], [[private property]] and [[class society]]. These Orthodox Jewish anarchists personally observed the [[Halacha]], but supported the social system of [[communist anarchism]] or [[anarcho-syndicalism]].

==Orthodox Jews and Anti-authoritarian Left==

British Orthodox Rabbi [[Yankev-Meyer Zalkind]], was an [[communist anarchism|anarcho-communist]], a close friend of the anarchist thinker [[Rudolf Rocker]], and an active anti-militarist, who was jailed by the British authorities for his anti-war activism. Rabbi Zalkind was also a prolific [[Yiddish]] writer and a prominent [[Torah]] scholar, who authored a few volumes of commentaries on the [[Talmud]]. He believed that the ethics of the [[Talmud]], if properly understood, are closely related to anarchism.&lt;ref name = "Goncharok2"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.jewniverse.ru/biher/goncharok/anarchie/8.html |last=Гончарок |first=Моше |authorlink=Moshe Goncharok |script-title=ru:ПЕПЕЛ НАШИХ КОСТРОВ, Очерки Истории Еврейского Анархистского Движения (ИДИШ-АНАРХИЗМ) |year=2002 |publisher=Problemen |location=[[Jerusalem]] |language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The famous [[Kabbalist]] Rabbi [[Yehuda Ashlag]] believed in a religious version of [[libertarian communism]], based on principles of Kabbalah, which he called [[altruist communism]]. Ashlag supported the [[Kibbutz]] movement and preached to establish a network of self-ruled [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] voluntary communes, who would eventually dismantle the government and the system of law enforcement.&lt;ref name="Ashlag1"&gt;[http://www.kabbalah.info/eng/content/view/full/3811] Altruistic Communism will finally annul the brute-force regime completely, for “every man did that which was right in his own eyes.”... Indeed, there is nothing more humiliating and degrading for a person than being under the brute-force government.&lt;/ref&gt; However, most contemporary followers of the Ashlagian Kabbalah seem to be unaware of his [[anti-capitalist]] and anti-authoritarian political stance.

[[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian revolutionary]] and [[Homeland for the Jewish people|Territorialist]] leader [[Isaac Nachman Steinberg]], whose ideas were essentially anarchist, although he defined himself as a [[Left Socialist-Revolutionaries|left eser]] or left [[narodnik]], was an Orthodox Jew. Like [[Martin Buber]], Steinberg supported the idea of [[binational solution]] of the Israel-Palestinian conflict and tried to establish a compact self-ruled Jewish settlement somewhere else outside the Middle East.

Rabbi [[Abraham Yehudah Khein]] (1878–1957), a prominent follower of the Hasidic [[Chabad]] tradition, was eloquently committed to pacifism and non-violence during the days when the Jewish community in Palestine was battling the Arabs and the British. He tried to relate his readings of [[Leo Tolstoy]] and [[Pyotr Kropotkin]] to Kabbalah and Hasidism. Rabbi Khein deeply respected Kropotkin, whom he called "the [[Tzadik]] of the new world", whose "soul is as pure as crystal"&lt;ref name="jcrelations.net"&gt;[http://www.jcrelations.net/en/?item=1913 Jewish-Christian Relations :: Universalist Trends in Jewish Religious Thought: Some Russian Perspectives&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commentarymagazine.com/viewarticle.cfm/Cedars-of-Lebanon-Sanctify-the-Ordinary-2967 Cedars of Lebanon: "Sanctify the Ordinary"&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ר' אברהם חן, ביהדות התורה, v.1 p.79&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi [[Yehudah-Leib Don-Yakhia]] from [[Chernigov]], another ''Chabadnik'', was known as a [[Tolstoyans|Tolstoyan]] and frequently quoted Leo Tolstoy in his synagogue sermons.&lt;ref name="jcrelations.net"/&gt;

Rabbi [[Shmuel Alexandrov]], also close to [[Chabad]] Hasidism, was an [[individualist anarchist]], whose religious thought was marked by some degree of [[antinomianism]].&lt;ref&gt;Luz, Ehud 1981 "Spiritualism and religious anarchism in the teaching of Shmuel Alexandrov" (Hebrew). Daat, no. 7 (summer): 121-138.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical and legendary communities==
{{Judaism}}

===Period of the Judges===
The Bible indicates, that the pre-monarchic Israelite society was anarchistic: "In those days there was no king in Israel; every man did that which was right in his own eyes." (Judges, 21:25); The prophet Samuel harshly criticized the Jews for trying to establish a monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel 8:7-18&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi [[Yehuda Ashlag]], referring to the above-mentioned verse, believed, that the future society will be [[libertarian communism|libertarian communist]].&lt;ref name="Ashlag1"/&gt;

===Essenes===
{{Main|Essenes}}
The [[Essenes]] were a [[monastic]] Jewish sect that flourished from the 2nd century BC to the 1st century AD. Although the Essenic society was divided into four strictly hierarchic orders, they rebelled against the establishment, lived a radically communal life, kept a vegetarian diet and supported themselves by manual labor, usually agricultural. New initiates to Essenism took some vows, including an oath not to force personal views or authority on others.

===The Account of Eldad ha-Dani===
{{Main|Eldad ha-Dani}}
Eldad ha-Dani was a merchant and traveler of the ninth century, who professed to have been a citizen of an "independent [[Jew]]ish state" in eastern [[Africa]], inhabited by people claiming descent from the tribes of [[Tribe of Dan|Dan]] (hence his name, "ha-Dani" = "the Danite"), [[Tribe of Asher|Asher]], [[Tribe of Gad|Gad]], and [[Tribe of Naphtali|Naphtali]]. According to his travel narratives, there is somewhere in the world a large land, encircled by the mysterious river [[Sambation]], inhabited by descendants of [[Moses]]. The inhabitants of this land have beautiful houses and live happy, wealthy and extremely long lives; they are all equal and farm their land by themselves, because they don't have servants; no one of them locks their doors at night, because they would consider it a shame; unlike the other tribes described in the story, no king or authority is mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/history/tkufot/eldad1-2.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Eldad ha-Dani's fanciful travel narratives were accepted by his contemporaries as true and were very popular in the Jewish world until recent times.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Even today, there are a few people, who believe that this mysterious land exists, perhaps somewhere in a parallel dimension.&lt;ref&gt;In the highly unconventional Yiddish booklet by the Hasidic composer and lyricist [[Yom Tov Ehrlich]], "קול מבֿשׂר ", the author suggests a connection between the Land of Lost Tribes and [[Shambhala]]&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of the factual truth of Eldad ha-Dani's account, it indicates that many medieval Jews believed that such a utopian society is possible and has been actually implemented.

===Mystical communities in Eastern Europe===
According to [[Eastern Europe]]an Jewish legends, before the establishment of the Hasidic movement by the [[Yisroel ben Eliezer (The Baal Shem Tov)|Baal Shem Tov]], there existed a secret society of [[Kabbalists]], who hid their mystical knowledge and refrained from public positions and honors. Some of these mystics, according to the legends, had establishing self-ruled agricultural settlements, which emphasized individual autonomy, solidarity and compassion, closeness to nature and living by their own labor. The sixth Lubavitcher rebbe, [[Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn]], said that the village of [[Lyubavichi]] took its origin from such a settlement, established by a mystic, named Reb Meyer, whose love to his fellows, both Jews and non-Jews, was boundless, and who also showed great compassion to all living beings. According to the legend, the village was originally named "Luba", meaning "love" both in Russian and Polish.&lt;ref&gt;Lubavitcher Rabbi's Memoirs, Volume One, Chapter One, Kehot Publication Society, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hasidim===
{{Main|Hasidic Judaism}}
Some Hasidic rebbes had proposed social structures that emphasize equality and anti-authoritarian principles. [[Kalonymus Kalman Shapira of Piasetzno]] had organized a mystical circle of Hasidim, focused on spiritual development and [[meditation]]. Rabbi Shapiro had insisted that his organization should refrain from choosing the chairman, vice chairman etc., as it was a custom in many organizations, because ''in a place, where holiness is revealed, there  is no rulership and honors''.&lt;ref&gt;בני מחשבה טובה , page 8, ועד חסידי פיסנצה, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of Hasidic anti-authoritarianism are some sectors of the [[Breslov (Hasidic group)|Breslov]] community, who refuse to obey any contemporary authorities and follow only the teaching of [[Nachman of Breslov|Rebbe Nachman]] and his disciple, [[Nathan of Breslov|Reb Noson]]. The Breslov community in general is very decentralized and includes followers of diametrically opposite political opinions, such as far-right settlers of the [[West Bank]], as well as universalistic thinkers and apolitical contemplatives.

Some Hasidic masters, including [[Simcha Bunim of Peshischa]], [[Mordechai Yosef Leiner|Mordechai Yosef Leiner of Izbica]] and [[Zadok HaKohen|Zadok of Lublin]], emphasize individual choice, freedom, spontaneity and dynamism of thought and action.&lt;ref&gt;Hasidism on the Margin: Reconciliation, Antinomianism and Messianism in Izbica &amp; Radzin Hasidism, by Shaul Magid, The University of Wisconsin Press,2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related themes in Judaism==

===God===
According to the Hasidic [[panentheism|panentheistic]] view, God is the true nature of all reality and the true self of the human soul ("the soul of the souls"). All duality and multiplicity is an illusion, resulting from the [[Tzimtzum]]. The contemporary Hasidic researcher [[Immanuel Schochet]] had described this view as [[Monism|monistic]] [[acosmism]].&lt;ref&gt;The Great Maggid: The Life and Teachings of Rabbi Dov Ber of Mezhirech, Volume One, page 205, by Jacob Immanuel Schochet, Kehot Publication Society, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Everything in the world is ever-changing and lacks intrinsic reality,&lt;ref&gt;בונה ירושלים, נ׳&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;לקוטי תורה, פ׳ ואתחנן, pp. 3-4, Kehot Publication Society, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; while the only true reality&amp;nbsp;– God&amp;nbsp;– is beyond all definitions and boundaries, including time, space, personality and even substantial existence.&lt;ref&gt;בשעה שהקדימו - תער״ב, vol.2, p. 1144, Kehot Publication Society, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;משנת חב״ד, מר׳ משה לייב מילער, ערך עצמות, pp 6-12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;דרך מצותיך, מצות האמנת האלקות, ד׳-ה׳, pp. 94-101, Kehot Publication Society, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Such views of reality are common in the Chassidic literature, although many contemporary Chassidim are unaware of these teachings and might consider them too esoteric.

The appearance of God as a personal being in the world of [[Atzilut]] is also a result of the [[Tzimtzum]] and, according to the teachings of the [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson|Lubavitcher rabbi]], is a reflection of the to-be-created human personality,&lt;ref&gt;מאמר ועשית חג שבועות - תשכ"ה, Ma'amar Veasisa Chag Shavuos 5725, published by Lahak Hanachos, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; though some other Chassidim might consider such views bordering on heresy. In Kabbalistic and Hasidic literature, God is commonly called ''[[Ein Sof (Kabbalah)|Ein Sof]]'' (the Infinite) or, sometimes, ''Ayin'' (Nothingness). The purpose of "worshiping" God is the realization of the Absolute Reality and unification with it.&lt;ref&gt;Zen Buddhism and Hasidism, by Jacob Teshima, University Press of America, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

Such esoteric views of God differ radically from conventional [[monotheism]] and resemble the Eastern concepts of [[Nirguna Brahman]], [[Suchness]] and [[Dharmakaya]]. Thus, [[Mikhail Bakunin|Mikhail Bakunin's]] and [[Daniel Guérin|Daniel Guérin's]] critique of religion can be only partly applied to such a theology.

===Law===
According to the Hasidic esoteric philosophy, the [[Halacha]] is not a set of laws, imposed by an external authority (since in panentheistic view God is never "external"), but a framework of means for spiritual self-development, somewhat similar to the Eastern concept of [[Dharma]]. The reward of fulfilling the commandments is the inner development itself;&lt;ref&gt;דגל מחנה אפרים, פרשת צו&lt;/ref&gt; the punishment for the sin is the destructive spiritual impact of certain actions.&lt;ref&gt;מי השלוח, פ׳ בראשית, הערה י״ח&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the [[religious law]]s are seen as natural (and, at same time, divine and supernatural), as the laws of physical nature. [[Halacha]] itself is open to inquiry, though actual change or violation of halachic norms, according to traditional Hasidism, usually requires extensive expertise and mystical knowledge, and should be taken with great caution.&lt;ref&gt;Controversy and Dialogue in the Jewish Tradition: A Reader, p. 113, 139, 144. Routledge, 2005. ''When Moses ascended to heaven to receive the Torah, on every issue he was shown forty-nine aspects to forbid and forty-nine aspects to permit. He asked the Holy One, blessed be He, about this, and He said that it is delegated to the scholars of Israel of each and each generation, and the ruling will be made in accordance with their view.''&lt;/ref&gt; According to some Kabbalists, in the Messianic world the standardized [[Halacha]] will be abolished, because everyone will realize his/her personal spiritual path by personal intuition. Such views are very common in the classic Chassidic literature, although many contemporary Chassidim might consider these teachings too esoteric and view the Halacha primarily as "law".

===Mutual Aid and International Solidarity===
There are two clearly anti-authoritarian passages in the [[Mishna]]ic tractate [[Pirkei Avoth|Pirkei Avot]]: "Love labor, hate mastery over others, and avoid a close relationship with the government" (Avot, 1:10); "Be careful with the government, for they befriend a person only for their own needs. They appear to be friends when it is beneficial to them, but they do not stand by a person at the time of his distress" (Avot 2:3).

Another passage in [[Pirkei Avoth|Pirkei Avot]] lists four possible social relationship schemes: "He who says, 'What's mine is mine and what's yours is yours', is the median type, though some say that this is the quality of Sodom. He who says, 'What's mine is yours and what's yours is mine', is a simple (or, according to other readings, an ignorant) man. He who says, 'What's mine is yours and what's yours is yours', is a pious man ('Hasid'). And he who says, 'What's yours is mine, and what's mine is mine', is wicked.'" (Avot, 5:13). According to Rabbi [[Yehuda Ashlag]], consistent application of this ethical rule by all members of the society leads to [[communist anarchism|voluntary communism]].&lt;ref name="Ashlag2"&gt;[http://www.kabbalah.info/eng/content/view/full/3811] "Communism must be turned away from the concept, 'What’s mine is mine and what’s yours is yours', which is sodomite rule, to the concept, 'What’s mine is yours and what’s yours is yours', meaning absolute altruism".&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Middle Ages, some Jews practiced [[usury]] against the non-Jews, while condemning it within the Jewish community. Most medieval rabbis approved of such practice, which helped the Jews to survive in antisemitic states, where they were excluded from most professions. However, a number of prominent rabbis explain that usury is unethical in nature, and is not allowed against people, who treat Jews well.&lt;ref&gt;הגהות מהרש״א , יורה דעה, 159:1;&lt;/ref&gt; Emphasis on cooperative productive word and criticism of wage labor and of profit from financial operations is found in some Judaic [[Musar literature|ethical treatises]], including ''Sefer HaBrit'' by Rabbi Pinchas Eliyahu of Vilna,&lt;ref&gt;,ספר הברית , pages 522-575, יריד הספרים, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tiferet Yisrael (commentary)|Tiferet Israel]] by [[Israel Lipschitz]],&lt;ref&gt;תפראת ישראל, אבות א׳ י׳&lt;/ref&gt; and Memoirs of [[Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn]], the sixth Lubavicher Rebbe.&lt;ref&gt;Lubavitcher Rebbe's Memoirs, Vol. 1, Ch. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional Judaism is often viewed as a national religion, concerned mostly with internal affairs. However, many well known [[Torah]] scholars called for international solidarity, cooperation and compassion. For example, the [[Lithuania]]n-born Rabbi [[Pinchas Elijah Horovitz]], the author of ''Sefer haBrit'', who lived in 18th century [[Galicia (Central-Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], had insisted that the Jews are obligated to love their neighbors, Jews and non-Jews alike, like themselves. He called for compassionate international solidarity, [[mutual aid (organization)|mutual aid]] and cooperative labor.&lt;ref&gt;Between Enlightenment and Romanticism: Computational Kabbalah of Rabbi Pinchas Elijah Hurwitz, by Yoel Matveyev, History and Philosophy of Logic 32 (1), p. 97: ''Hurwitz explains how all humanity is interconnected as a single entity... Some very similar  arguments were offered a century later by Peter Kropotkin''&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi [[Elijah Benamozegh]], an Italian Orthodox Kabbalist, strongly supported religious [[universalism]] and political [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]].

===Nonviolence===
{{further|Peace and violence in Judaism}}
Contemporary Judaism rejects [[capital punishment]] and, at least in theory, almost never advocates physical coercion, except for some rare cases, such as forcing a husband who refuses to give a [[Get (divorce document)|get]] to his wife, who wants to be divorced.  However, historically Judaism (as laid down in the Torah) did mandate, at least in theory, the death sentence for certain crimes, provided that certain requirements are met, namely two eyewitnesses and the perpetrator being warned of (and acknowledging) the punishment if they were to carry out the crime. This however requires participation of active Sanhedrin (the supreme court of Jewish law) which is presently non existent. The only exception to that rule is the case of the "moyser" ("informer") who threatens the life of others by [[informant|informing]] the authorities; such a person could be killed, in principle, even today.

While [[Tanakh]] contains many violent stories of military conquest, capital and collective punishment for various sins, the Talmud and the later commentators tend to interpret these stories not literally or reduce them to unique one-time contexts. For example, the [[Talmud]]ic requirements for corporal punishments are so complicated and unrealistic, that render them virtually impossible even in the biblical times and certainly impossible today. The Talmud says, that a [[Sanhedrin]], who would put someone to death even once (or, according to another version, more than once) in 70 years, deserves to be called a "bloody Sanhedrin". According to Kabbalah, the purpose of these rare punishments was the spiritual "correction" of the sinner's soul, in order to liberate it from the [[Qliphoth|Klipot]].

Rabbi [[Abraham Yehudah Khein]], a supporter of [[communist anarchism]], noticed that [[Rabbi Akiva]], one of the most prominent Talmudical sages, rejected capital punishment altogether. Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Tarfon said that if they and their pupils were to participate in a Sanhedrin, they would make sure that no one is ever killed.&lt;ref&gt;Mishnah (Makkot 1, 10)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Talmud teaches: "Who is mighty? One who controls his passions" (Pirkei Avot 4:1); "Who is the mightiest of heroes? He who makes an enemy into his friend" (Pirkei Avot, 5:11); "Be of the persecuted rather than the persecutor" (Bava Kama 93a). However, a number of [[anti-Zionism|anti-Zionist]] rabbis, especially, Rabbi [[Joel Teitelbaum]], the late [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]] [[rebbe]], condemned the violence of the [[Israel Defense Forces]], including the [[Six-Day War]], although many observers considered this war an act of "preemptive self-defence". While Judaism fully recognizes the right of military defense, many Orthodox Jews only consider it legitimate in cases of clear and unavoidable danger. Even in such cases, some anti-Zionist Jews deny the right of the State to execute such power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewsagainstzionism.com/rabbi_quotes/teitelbaummayjewswagewar.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818135455/http://www.jewsagainstzionism.com/rabbi_quotes/teitelbaumMayJewsWageWar.cfm |archivedate=2010-08-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few Orthodox Jewish [[Anti-Zionism|anti-Zionist]] groups, especially [[Neturei Karta]], don't support any Israel's military actions, interpret the Arab aggression as a result of the Zionist politics and reject the State of Israel altogether, because they view its existence as a [[heresy|heretical]] contradiction with the belief in the future Messianic redemption, which they usually don't see as the restoration of the Jewish statehood, but as a spiritual 'kingdom' of universal harmony and peace.

===Critical approach to organized religion===
Though in ancient times the Jewish religious practice centered on the Great [[Sanhedrin]], which acted as a rabbinical legislative authority controlling the whole of ancient [[Judea]], Modern Judaism is a principally decentralized religion that lacks a central clerical body.

Often today, Rabbis are considered to be just more knowledgeable people, who serve as advisors and analyze how the [[Halacha]] applies to different situations, although some rabbinical figures and organizations impose their authority though coercive means. Some rabbis have secular jobs and refrain from being supported by the community. Nevertheless, in ultra-orthodox [[Haredi]] circles, the concept of [[Da'as Torah]] still mandates near-complete obedience to the authority of [[gedolim]] (a special cadre of especially esteemed rabbinic scholars) in every area of everyday life. This authority structure exists both in the [[Haredi]] [[Litvish]] camp and among Hasidic groups, where the [[Admor]] or Rebbe is consulted for Da'as Torah. One notable exception are the [[Breslov (Hasidic group)|Breslov]] Hasidim, who tend to be decentralized and individualistic.

Despite this, even in the most authoritarian Jewish communities it's very common to disobey the rabbis for various reasons, and to organize new independent groups, who would choose their own rabbis, or, sometimes, would refuse to obey any living authority. For example, some [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar Hasidim]] refuse to recognize their current leadership and rely solely on the teachings of the late Rabbi [[Joel Teitelbaum]]; most Satmar Hasidim do not recognize and harshly criticise all Zionist and pro-Zionist rabbinical institutions, especially the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]]. Some educated Orthodox Jews do not affiliate with any particular rabbi or group, and choose halachic opinions on their own, by researching rabbinical literature and comparing opinions of different rabbis.

The tradition of decentralization and somewhat critical approach to authoritarian structures is common among Orthodox Jews, especially among the Hasidim, who are divided into over 100 independent [[List of Hasidic dynasties|sects]].

===Relativity of power structures===
The Kabbalistic and Hasidic literature often views hierarchies, dichotomies and casual relationships as relative and overturnable, based on the ontological principle of [[Sefer Yetzirah]], that ''the beginning is wedged in the end, and the end is wedged in the beginning'', and the [[Monism|monistic]] concepts of unity and interrelated nature of all things. For example, [[Malkhuth|Malkhut]], which usually represents the feminine aspects of Reality in Kabbalah, is the lowest and, at the same time, the highest of the [[Sephirot (Kabbalah)|Sephirot]], because in its root it's identical with [[Keter (Kabbalah)|Keter]]; according to the teachings of Chassidus, Moses had lost some "sparks" of his spirituality due to the misdeeds of the Jews in the desert, because the leader is in some aspect lower the led, "like the head, that can not go without the feet, in which aspect the feet become the head";&lt;ref&gt;תורה אור, פ׳ בראשית&lt;/ref&gt; the empty part of a book or a Torah scroll is considered more ontologically significant, because it enables the very existence of the text; repentance can elevate a sin to the level higher than a [[Mitzvah]]; destruction can be a creative force, like the seed, that must be destroyed in the soil, in order to grow into a new plant.

In general, the dialectic of Kabbalah often closely resembles [[Deconstructivism|deconstructivist]] philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newkabbalah.com/Coincshort.pdf] The Doctrine of Coincidentia Oppositorum in Jewish Mysticism, by Sanford L. Drob&lt;/ref&gt;

===Truth===
Judaism accepts that truth is relative to some extent and that the opposite [[Halacha|Halachic]] opinions can both be right, although this idea is usually not generalized beyond some traditional contexts. Rabbi [[Menachem Nachum Twerski of Chernobyl]] had stated, that even contradicting descriptions of historical reality can both be, and sometimes are, true.&lt;ref&gt;מאור עינים, פ׳ שמות&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rabbi [[Nachman of Breslov]], the true knowledge is denial of any final knowledge; when a person reaches the "peak" of one spiritual world, all his/her previous knowledge is nullified by the new knowledge, that he discovers in the next world. However, one must seek and follow his or her personal truth, in order to keep "climbing" to the higher worlds and new levels of the knowledge, which have no end.&lt;ref&gt;שׂיחות הר״ן, ב׳&lt;/ref&gt;

===Question of Messianic 'Kingdom'===
The belief in the future restoration of the [[Messiah]]'s kingdom on earth is considered one of the fundamental tenets of traditional Judaism. Some classic rabbinical commentaries, especially the [[Maimonides|Rambam]], supported monarchy and viewed the future Messiah as a king in literal sense and the future Messianic redemption as restoration of the Jewish state. According to other classic interpretations, the [[Torah]] only tells what limitations are supposed to be put on the king's power and possessions, if the Jews decide to choose monarchy as an option. According to [[Isaac Abrabanel]], the "king" Moshiach will be a universally accepted spiritual teacher and a judge, but not a monarch; the state will be abolished and humanity will eventually return to the original Edenic harmony.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia Judaica, on Isaac Abarbanel&lt;/ref&gt; Though Abarbanel's commentary is complex and may be interpreted in a number of different ways, his view of the ideal society in not statist. Rabbi [[Jonathan Sachs]] considers Abarbanel an 'utopian anarchist' &lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Jonathan Sachs, On the Limits of Power, {{cite web |url=http://www.chiefrabbi.org/UploadedFiles/thoughts/shoftim5767.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727062230/http://www.chiefrabbi.org/UploadedFiles/thoughts/shoftim5767.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of Hasidic teachers consistently rejected or spiritualized the idea of a future [[Messianism|Messianic]] "kingdom", and viewed Messiah as a compassionate teacher and advisor, but not a coercive ruler.&lt;ref&gt;תולדות יעקב יוסף, פ׳ שופטים&lt;/ref&gt; According to such Hasidic interpretation, the [[Jewish Messiah|Messiah]] will "fight" God's eschatological "wars" by providing a role model of a great [[Tzadik]].&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi [[Nachman of Breslov|Nachmen of Breslov]] once said, ''Moshiach will "conquer" the world without a single bullet or gunpowder''&lt;/ref&gt; Some Jewish mystics emphasize the concept of 'Messianic spark' or the 'inner Messiah' within every righteous individual or every human soul. According to such view, the whole humanity will attain collectively redemptive Messianic consciousness in the future.

There is a seemingly monarchist passage in the Talmud: ''Pray for the stability of the kingdom, for were it not for the fear of its authority, a man would swallow his neighbor alive'' (Avot 3:2). However, [[Isaac Abarbanel]], [[Israel Lipschutz]] and a number of other classic commentators hold that this passage only stresses the need for social order ("kingdom"), which might be organized by the people, and not necessarily by the king.&lt;ref&gt;נחלת אבות on Avot 3:2&lt;/ref&gt; Some mystical commentators interpret this passage in non-literal fashion, as referring to the spiritual Divine kingdom inside every human individual, not unlike [[Leo Tolstoy]].

==Quotes==

[[Talmud]]

:* Love labor, hate mastery, and avoid relationship with the government (Avot, 1:10)

:* He who says, "What's mine is mine and what's yours is yours", is the median type, though some say that this is the quality of Sodom. He who says, "What's mine is yours and what's yours is mine", is a simple man.&lt;ref&gt;According to the reading of [[Yonah Gerondi|Rabbeinu Yonah]], who viewed this social scheme as positive; [[Maimonides|Rambam]] interpreted this term as "an ignorant man"&lt;/ref&gt; He who says, "What's mine is yours and what's yours is yours", is a pious man ("Hasid"). And he who says, "What's yours is mine, and what's mine is mine", is wicked. (Avot, 5:10)

[[Simcha Bunim of Peshischa]]
:* In worship of God there are no rules&amp;nbsp;– and this statement is also not a rule.

[[Mordechai Yosef Leiner]]
:* Someone whose spiritual root is good does not have to restrict himself. Whatever he does is good in God's eyes.

[[Kalonymus Kalman Shapira of Piasetzno]]

:* In a place where holiness is revealed, there is no rulership and honors.

[[Yehuda Ashlag]]
:* Altruistic Communism will finally annul the brute-force regime completely, for “every man did that which was right in his own eyes.” .. Indeed, there is nothing more humiliating and degrading for a person than being under the brute-force government [http://www.kabbalah.info/eng/content/view/full/3811].

'''Audie Leon Murphy''' (20 June 1925&amp;nbsp;– 28 May 1971)&lt;!-- LEAVE THIS ALONE! See [[Audie Murphy]] talk page: Archive #1 §22--&gt; was one of the most decorated [[United States|American]] combat soldiers of [[World War II]].&lt;!-- LEAVE THIS ALONE! Do not change to "most decorated". Do not edit war over this wording. See [[Audie Murphy]] talk page: discussions on all talk page archives, all reviews.  --&gt; He received every military combat award for valor available from the [[U.S. Army]], as well as French and Belgian awards for heroism. Murphy received the [[Medal of Honor]] for valor that he demonstrated at the age of 19 for single-handedly holding off an entire company of German soldiers for an hour at the [[Colmar Pocket]] in France in January 1945, then leading a successful counterattack while wounded and out of ammunition. Murphy was born into a large family of [[sharecroppers]] in [[Hunt County, Texas]]. His father abandoned them, and his mother died when he was a teenager. Murphy left school in fifth grade to pick [[cotton]] and find other work to help support his family; his skill with a hunting rifle helped feed his family.

After the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] in 1941, Murphy's older sister helped him to falsify documentation about his birthdate in order to meet the minimum-age requirement for enlisting in the military. Turned down by the [[United States Navy|Navy]] and the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]], he enlisted in the Army. He first saw action in the 1943 [[Allied invasion of Sicily]]; then in 1944 he participated in the [[Battle of Anzio]], the [[liberation of Rome]], and the [[Operation Dragoon|invasion of southern France]]. Murphy fought at [[Montélimar]] and led his men on a successful assault at the L'Omet quarry near [[Cleurie]] in northeastern France in October.

After the war, Murphy embarked on a 21-year acting career. He played himself in the 1955 autobiographical film ''[[To Hell and Back (film)|To Hell and Back]]'', based on his 1949 memoirs of the same name, but most of his roles were in [[Western (genre)|western]]s. He made guest appearances on celebrity television shows and starred in the series ''[[Whispering Smith (TV series)|Whispering Smith]]''. Murphy was a fairly accomplished songwriter. He bred [[American Quarter Horse|quarter horses]] in California and Arizona, and became a regular participant in horse racing.

Suffering from what would today be described as [[post traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), Murphy slept with a loaded handgun under his pillow. He looked for solace in addictive sleeping pills. In his last few years, he was plagued by money problems but refused offers to appear in alcohol and cigarette commercials because he did not want to set a bad example. Murphy died in a plane crash in Virginia in 1971, which was shortly before his 46th birthday. He was interred with full military honors at [[Arlington National Cemetery]], where his grave is one of the most visited.

==Early life==
Murphy was the seventh of twelve children born to Emmett Berry Murphy and his wife Josie Bell Killian in [[Kingston, Texas]].{{refn|group=ALM|name=birth|Murphy's son Terry is the President of the Audie Murphy Research Foundation, which in both its biographical sketch and Murphy Family Tree list his year of birth as 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Audie L. Murphy Memorial Website|title=BIOGRAPHY A short biographical sketch|url=http://www.audiemurphy.com/biography.htm|accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murphy's date of birth has been given as both 1924 and 1925 by Murphy himself. He seemed to go back and forth on the dates for the rest of his life. His sister, Mrs. Corinne Burns, as his nearest living kin, had signed a notarized document attesting to the birth date of 20 June 1924 that Murphy put on his enlistment application, falsifying his year of birth so he could meet the U.S. Army age qualification for enlistment. Subsequently, all military records show the purportedly falsified date as his birth date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Audie L.

==World War II service==
{{main|Military career of Audie Murphy}}
Murphy had always wanted to be a soldier. After the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] in December 1941, he tried to enlist,{{sfn|Murphy|2002|p=7}} but the Army, Navy and Marine Corps all turned him down for being underweight and underage. After his sister provided an [[affidavit]] that falsified his birth date by a year, he was accepted by the U.S. Army on 30 June 1942.{{refn|group=ALM|name=birth}}{{refn|group=ALM|name=weight|Conflicting information exists as to Murphy's date and place of enlistment. The Audie L. Murphy Memorial website has scanned documents from the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration that include Corinne Burns' statement and Murphy's "Induction Record", which shows him "Enlisted at Dallas, Texas" on 30 June 1942, and the line above it says "Accepted for service at Greenville, Texas". The National Register of Historic Places Listing added the Greenville post office as historic site number 74002081 in 1974, citing it as Murphy's place of enlistment, possibly referring to the act the military termed "Accepted for service". The NRHP also shows his enlistment date as 20 June 1942 which might be the date he was accepted for service.{{sfn|Tate|2006|pp=152–163}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Audie L.

==Song writing==
{{Main|List of songs written by Audie Murphy}}
David McClure, his collaborator on the book ''To Hell and Back'', discovered Murphy's talent for poetry during their work on the memoir when he found discarded verses in Murphy's Hollywood apartment. One of those poems, "The Crosses Grow on Anzio", appears in ''To Hell and Back'' attributed to a soldier named Kerrigan. Only two others survived, "Alone and Far Removed" and "Freedom Flies in Your Heart Like an Eagle". The latter was part of a speech Murphy had written at a 1968 dedication of the Alabama War Memorial in [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], and later set to music by Scott Turner under the title "Dusty Old Helmet".{{sfn|Simpson|1975|pp=374–76}}

Murphy was a fan of country music, in particular [[Bob Wills]] and [[Chet Atkins]], but was not a singer or musician himself.{{sfn|Simpson|1975|pp=371-73}} Through his friend [[Guy Mitchell]], Murphy was introduced to songwriter [[Scott Turner (songwriter)|Scott Turner]] in 1961.{{sfn|Graham|1989|p=298}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Beck|first1=Ken|title=Remembering a Musical Audie|publisher=The Tennessean|date=30 November 1989|page=1E}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two collaborated on numerous songs between 1962 and 1970, the most successful of which was "Shutters and Boards" and "When the Wind Blows in Chicago".{{sfn|Simpson|1975|p=372}}

[[Image:Brevet de pilote aéronaute 1904.jpg|thumb|right|Balloon pilot's licence issued by the Aéro-Club de France to Mr. Tissandier in 1904.]]
The '''Aéro-Club de France''' was founded as the '''Aéro-Club''' on 20 October 1898 as a society 'to encourage aerial locomotion' by [[Ernest Archdeacon]], [[Léon Serpollet]], [[Henri de la Valette]], [[Jules Verne]] and his wife, [[André Michelin]], [[Albert de Dion]], [[Alberto Santos-Dumont]], [[Henry Deutsch de la Meurthe]], and [[Henry de La Vaulx]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aeroclub.com/100-ans-histoire/aecf-de-1898-a-nos-jours/historique |first=Max |last=Armanet |title=Historique |language=French |accessdate=17 April 2014 |website=Aéro-Club de France |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140420043651/http://www.aeroclub.com/100-ans-histoire/aecf-de-1898-a-nos-jours/historique |archivedate=20 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 April 1909 its name was changed to '''Aéro-Club de France'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aviation-francaise.com/100%20ans%20ACF.htm |title=Centenaire de l'Aero-Club de France |website=Aviation-francaise.com |year=1998 |accessdate=7 August 2012  |language=fr |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203162714/http://www.aviation-francaise.com/100%20ans%20ACF.htm |archivedate=3 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aéro-Club de France originally set many of the regulations that controlled aviation in France. From its formation it also set the rules that have marked some of the 'firsts' in aviation, such as the first closed-circuit flight of over 1&amp;nbsp;km and the first helicopter flight, and has organised competitions including:
* the Prix Deutsch de la Meurthe, a challenge for [[dirigibles]] from 1901
* the [[Gordon Bennett Trophy (aeroplanes)|Gordon Bennett Cup]] for fixed-wing aircraft in 1909

The club published the journal ''[[L'Aérophile]]'' from 1898 to 1947,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aeroclub.com/santos_dumont_14bis_14bis_2.htm |title=Les vols du 14bis décrits par les membres del'Aéro- Club de France dans les Aérophiles de 1906 |work=Aéro-Club de France |language=fr |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707092457/http://www.aeroclub.com/santos_dumont_14bis_14bis_2.htm |archivedate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and since 1997 publishes the magazine ''Aérofrance''.

The Aéro-Club de France was a founding member of the [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale|International Aeronautical Federation]] (FAI) in 1905, a joint effort with other national associations.

After 1945 some of the Aéro-Club's regulatory roles were taken by other bodies. It now focusses on the promotion of aviation and certification.

The '''Baga languages''' are languages of the [[Mel languages|Mel]] family spoken in the coastal region of [[Guinea]]. The total number of speakers is about 30,000, of which Landoma speakers make up almost half.

==Languages==
The varieties apart from Landoma are sometimes considered dialects of one language, ''Baga'' or ''Barka''. Landoma is somewhat more distantly related.

*[[Landoma language|Landoma]]
*[[Baga language|Baga]]: Binari, Koba, Manduri, Sitemú, etc.

The Baga languages are in turn related to [[Temne language|Temne]], one of the four official languages of [[Sierra Leone]]; together, Baga and Temne belong to the [[Mel languages|Mel branch]] of [[Niger–Congo languages]].

The country is named after the historical region of [[Bengal]], of which it constitutes the largest and easternmost part. [[Bangladeshi nationality law|Bangladeshi citizenship]] was formed in 1971, when the permanent residents of the former [[East Pakistan]] were transformed into citizens of a new republic.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20121007124849/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country%2C%2CNATLEGBOD%2C%2CBGD%2C%2C3ae6b51f10%2C0.html&lt;/ref&gt; Bangladesh is the world's [[List of countries by population|eighth most populous nation]]. Vast majority of Bangladeshis are ethnolingustically [[Indo-Aryan people]] who speak [[Bengali–Assamese]] languages native to the region and follow the [[Islam|Islamic]] religion, by far the largest of them being [[Bengalis]]. The population of Bangladesh is concentrated in the fertile [[Bengal delta]], which has been the center of urban and agrarian civilizations for millennia. The country's highlands, including the [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]] and the [[Sylhet Division]], are home to various tribal minorities.

[[Bengali Muslims]] are the predominant ethnoreligious group of Bangladesh with a population of 146 million, which makes up majority of the country's population. [[Chittagonian people]], [[Rangpuri language|Rangpuri people]] and [[Sylhetis]] form the majority in Chittagong, Rangpur and Sylhet regions respectively. The minority [[Bengali Hindu]] population in Bangladesh is over 16,238,167 which makes up 12.07% of the total country population. Non [[Bengali-Assamese]] Muslims make up the largest immigrant community; while the [[Tibeto-Burman]] [[Chakma people|Chakmas]], who speak the Indo-Aryan [[Chakma language]], are the largest indigenous ethnic group after Indo-Aryan [[Bengali-Assamese]] peoples.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Chakmas,_The&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Austroasiatic]] [[Santhals]] are the largest aboriginal community.

The [[Bangladeshi diaspora]] is concentrated in the Middle East, [[North America]] and the [[Bangladeshi diaspora in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]]. Several hundred thousand Non-Resident Bangladeshis (NRBs) have [[dual citizenship]] in [[Commonwealth countries]] like the UK and [[Canada]].

==Terminology==
[[File:Bangladesh in its region.svg|thumb|[[Bangladesh]] in Asia]]
Bangladeshis have been known by several terms:

* '''Bangladeshis''', the most widely-used term to refer to the citizens of Bangladesh, comes from ''Bangladesh'' (meaning "Country of Bengal"), and can be traced to the early 20th century. Then, the term was used by Bengali patriotic songs like ''Namo Namo Namo Bangladesh Momo'', by [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]], and ''Aaji Bangladesher Hridoy'', by [[Rabindranath Tagore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.google.de/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=nomo+nomo+nomo+bangladesh+momo&amp;start=0 | title=Google}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.geetabitan.com/lyrics/A/aaji-bangladesher-hridoy.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=20 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017144200/http://www.geetabitan.com/lyrics/A/aaji-bangladesher-hridoy.html |archive-date=17 October 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Bangalees''', an [[exonym]] for [[Bengalis]], was used between 1972 and 1978 by the Constitution of Bangladesh for all citizens of Bangladesh, despite 2% of the population being indigenous and immigrant non-Bengalis. Under President [[Ziaur Rahman]], the constitutional term was changed to ''Bangladeshi'', as part of efforts to promote [[Bangladeshi nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Murshid |first=Tazeen M. |year=2001 |chapter=State, Nation, Identity: The Quest for Legitimacy in Bangladesh |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cN8rBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA165 |editor1-last=Shastri |editor1-first=Amita |editor2-last=Jeyaratnam Wilson |editor2-first=A. |editor2-link=A. Jeyaratnam Wilson |title=The Post-Colonial States of South Asia: Political and Constitutional Problems |publisher=Curzon Press |page=165 |isbn=978-1-136-11866-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''East Bengalis''', a term used in reference to Bangladesh being a political unit based on the [[Partition of Bengal (disambiguation)|
Partition of Bengal]]. The territory was known as ''East Bengal'' twice in the 20th century. It was used for [[Eastern Bengal and Assam]] in the [[British Raj]] between 1906 and 1912. It was again used for the [[Dominion of Pakistan]]'s province of [[East Bengal]] between 1947 and 1955.
* '''Bangals''', a term used informally in neighboring [[India]] to refer to Bangladeshis. ''[[Bangal]]'' is also the [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] term for ''Bengal''. In [[West Bengal]], ''Bangal'' is widely used among upper-class subgroups to differentiate families from Bangladesh, the opposite then being ''[[Ghoti people|Ghoti]]'', which once referred to people from West Bengal.

==Demographics==

===Bengalis===
[[File:BD Dance.jpg|thumb|Bangladeshi artists performing in a dance show.]]
Mostafa Shuva of FCA is from Bangladesh. Approximately 98% of the Bangladeshi population are [[Bengalis]]. Most are native to East Bengal. The Bengali people have hybrid multiethnic origins, including [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]], [[Dravidian peoples|Dravidian]], [[Tibeto-Burman]] and [[Austroasiatic]] ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=fOQkpcVcd9AC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Ethnic Groups of South Asia and the Pacific: An Encyclopedia: An Encyclopedia| isbn=9781598846607| last1=Minahan| first1=James B| date=2012-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; East Bengal was a prosperous [[melting pot]] for centuries. It witnessed a synthesis of Islamic, North Indian and indigenous Bengali cultures. Today, Bengalis enjoy strong cultural homogeneity with a common standardized language and a variety of [[Bengali dialects|dialects]].

90% of the population are [[Bengali Muslim]]s (146 million). This makes Bangladesh the world's third largest [[Islam by country|Muslim majority country]] after [[Indonesia]] and [[Pakistan]]. Bengali Muslims also make up the world's second largest Muslim ethnic group after [[Arab Muslims]]. Most Bangladeshi Muslims are member of the [[Sunni]] branch of Islam. There are significant minorities of the [[Shia]] and [[Ahmadiya]] branches. [[Bengali Hindus]] are the largest minority of Bangladesh, with a population between 10-12 million. Bangladesh has the third largest Hindu population in the world after [[India]] and [[Nepal]]. There are an estimated 400,000 [[Bengali Christians]] and 500,000 [[Bengali Buddhists]].

The Bengali population is concentrated in Bengal delta, the coastal areas of Chittagong Division and the river valleys of Sylhet Division.

===Other Bengali-Assamese Peoples===

Other than [[Bengali Muslims]], [[Chittagonian people]], [[Rangpuri language|Rangpuri people]] and [[Sylhetis]] form the majority populations in [[Chittagong Division|Chittagong]], [[Rangpur Division|Rangpur]] and [[Sylhet region|Sylhet]] regions respectively.

===Non-Bengali Muslims===
An estimated 3 million Bangladeshi citizens are non-Bengali [[Muslim]] immigrants from different parts of [[South Asia]]. They include affluent sections of the country's merchant and business class, particularly [[Nizari Ismailism]] adherents.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theismaili.org/heritage-expressions/new-dhaka-jamatkhana-seen-symbol-confidence-bangladesh&lt;/ref&gt; They also include former [[Stranded Pakistanis]] and their descendants. Bangladesh's non-Bengali Muslims are usually fluent in both Bengali and [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]].

===Tribes of the Chittagong Hill Tracts===
In southeastern Bangladesh, the [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]] frontier has a district history. It was an exclusive zone for Tibeto-Burman tribes in [[Bengal Presidency|Bengal]] during the [[British Raj]]. Today, the area makes up 10% of Bangladesh's territory. It is home to several [[indigenous people|indigenous]] ethnic groups in the three hill districts of [[Rangamati]], [[Bandarban]] and [[Khagrachari]]. The three largest communities in the region have a [[Raja]] as their tribal chief who is recognized by the Government of Bangladesh.

* The [[Chakma people]] are the largest tribe of the Chittagong Hill Tracts and the second largest indigenous ethnic group of Bangladesh after Bengalis. A [[Tibeto-Burman]] community, they have been greatly influenced by [[Bengali culture]], including in their native [[Chakma language]], a branch of the [[Bengali-Assamese languages]]. Most Chakmas are concentrated in [[Rangamati District]]. The community is headed by the [[Chakma Raja]]. The majority of Chakmas are [[Therevada Buddhists]], with a minority being [[Hindu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Chakma|title=Chakma {{!}} people|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-04-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Marma people]] are second largest community in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. They have a [[Raja]] and are concentrated in the districts of [[Bandarban]] and [[Khagrachari]]. The Marmas are originally [[Kingdom of Arakan|Arakanese]] people who moved to the territory in the 17th century in order to escape Burmese persecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Marma|title=Marma {{!}} people|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-04-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Mro people]] are the third largest community in the region and have a [[Raja]]. [[Buddhism]], [[Christianity]] and [[animist]] beliefs are among the chief faiths of the Mros. Their population is concentrated in [[Bandarban District]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/backpage/hill-people-ready-welcome-boisabi-1390561|title=Hill people ready to welcome Boisabi|date=2017-04-13|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2017-04-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mros are originally related to the Chin people of Myanmar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://bdnews24.com/campus/2007/02/23/banglapedia-baffles-all-with-wrong-information-about-small-nationalities|title=Banglapedia baffles all with wrong information about small nationalities|work=bdnews24.com|access-date=2017-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Tanchangya people]] are among the oldest native indigenous tribes of the region. They speak the Indo-Aryan [[Tanchangya language]] and adhere to [[Therevada Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.utacf.org/tanchangyapeople.htm|title=Tanchangya People|website=www.utacf.org|access-date=2017-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/arts-entertainment/event/cultural-exchange-programme-held-port-city-184219|title=Cultural exchange programme held in port city|date=2015-12-09|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2017-04-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tribes of North and Northeast Bangladesh===
There are several [[Austroasiatic]], [[Tibeto-Burman]] and Indo-Aryan tribes which inhabit parts of northern and northeastern Bangladesh.

* The [[Santhal people]] are the largest aboriginal community of the country. They speak the [[Austroasiatic]] [[Santhali language]]. Their culture is noted for martial dance traditions. Their population is most concentrated in [[Rajshahi Division]] and [[Rangpur Division]]. The Santhals have been the focal point of land rights controversies as the Bangladeshi government seeks to develop open pit coal mining in their tribal hinterlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Santhal|title=Santhal {{!}} people|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-04-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Santals,_The|title=Santals, The - Banglapedia|website=en.banglapedia.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Garo people]] inhabit the [[Haluaghat Upazila]] of [[Mymensingh District]]. They have high literacy rates and are adherents of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Garo|title=Garo {{!}} people|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-04-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Garo,_The|title=Garo, The - Banglapedia|website=en.banglapedia.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Bisnupriya Manipuri people]] are the second largest ethnic group in [[Sylhet Division]]. They are adherents of [[Hinduism]] and the speak the Indo-Aryan [[Bishnupriya Manipuri language]]. Their classical [[Manipuri dance]] tradition is a key part of Bangladesh's national culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Manipuri,_The|title=Manipuri, The - Banglapedia|website=en.banglapedia.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/starinsight/2012/09/01/cover.htm|title=::: Star Insight :::|website=archive.thedailystar.net|access-date=2017-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A negligible small minority of [[Marwari people]] live in various cities and towns of the country such as [[Dinajpur District, Bangladesh|Dinajpur]], [[Kushtia District|Kushtia]] and [[Narayanganj District|Narayanganj]]. Although many of them have been assimilated into the larger Hindu Bengali demographics, they still use the marwari surnames such as [[Agarwal]], [[Singhania (disambiguation)|Singhania]] etc.  They are among the affluent sections of the country's merchant and business class.

===Tribes of Southern Bangladesh===
* An Arakanese [[Rakhine people|Rakhine]] community has resided in [[Barisal Division]] for three centuries. They arrived by the sea after escaping Burmese conquests in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/backpage/sakhina-set-become-mum-123067|title='Sakhina' set to become a mum|date=2015-08-07|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2017-04-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://en.prothom-alo.com/bangladesh/news/144885/Far-from-madding-crowd-on-Pahela-Baishakh|title=Far from madding crowd on Pahela Baishakh|work=Prothom Alo|access-date=2017-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rural society==
The basic [[social unit]] in a village is the family (''poribar'' or ''gushti''), generally consisting of a complete or incomplete [[patrilineal]]ly extended household (''chula'') and residing in a homestead (''[[bari]]''). The individual [[nuclear family]] often is submerged in the larger unit and might be known as the house (''ghor''). Above the ''bari'' level, patrilineal kin ties are linked into sequentially larger groups based on real, fictional, or assumed relationships.&lt;ref name=rs&gt;Rahim, Enayetur. "Rural Society". In Heitzman &amp; Worden.&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant unit larger than that of close kin is the voluntary religious and mutual benefit association known as "the society" (''shomaj'' or ''milat''). Among the functions of a ''shomaj'' might be the maintenance of a Mosque and support of a [[mullah]]. An informal council of ''shomaj'' elders (''matabdars'' or ''shordars'') settles village disputes. Factional competition between the ''motobdars'' is a major dynamic of social and political interaction.&lt;ref name=rs/&gt;

Groups of homes in a village are called ''Paras'', and each ''para'' has its own name. Several ''paras'' constitute a ''mauza'', the basic revenue and census survey unit. The traditional character of rural villages was changing in the latter half of the 20th century with the addition of brick structures of one or more stories scattered among the more common [[thatched]] [[bamboo]] huts.&lt;ref name=rs/&gt;

Although farming has traditionally ranked among the most desirable occupations, villagers in the 1980s began to encourage their children to leave the increasingly overcrowded countryside to seek more secure employment in the towns. Traditional sources of prestige, such as landholding, distinguished lineage, and religious piety were beginning to be replaced by modern education, higher income, and steadier work. These changes, however, did not prevent rural poverty from increasing greatly.

==Urban society==
[[File:Dhaka Skyline at Night.jpg|thumb|300px|View of downtown [[Dhaka]], the largest city in Bangladesh and one of the world's most populated cities]]
In 2015, 34% of Bangladeshis lived in cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2212.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dhaka]] is the largest city in Bangladesh and one of the world's most populous [[megacities]]. Other important cities include [[Chittagong]], [[Sylhet]], [[Khulna]], [[Rajshahi]], [[Jessore]], [[Barisal]], [[Comilla]], [[Narayanganj]] and [[Mymensingh]]. Most urban centers are rural administrative [[town]]s. Urban centers grew in number and population during the 1980s as a result of an administrative decentralization program that featured the creation of [[upazila]]s.&lt;ref name=us&gt;Rahim, Enayetur. "Urban Society". In Heitzman &amp; Worden.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identity==
Bangladesh is noted for [[cultural pluralism]] within a [[Bengali Muslim]] majority. Traditional Bengali secularism has been an important contributor to the nation's society and ethos. The [[Bengali language]] is a fundamental element of Bangladeshi identity. It is a secular language which evolved between the 7th and 10th centuries, with an indigenous alphabet, and unites people of different faiths and regions. The [[Bengali Language Movement]] sowed the seeds of East Pakistani nationalism, ultimately culminating in the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] in 1971. Since independence, the relationship between religion and the state has been controversial. Between 1972 and 1975, Bangladesh experienced [[socialism]] under a secular parliamentary system. [[Military coups in Bangladesh|Military coups]] ushered a sixteen-year presidential regime, which restored the [[free market]] and promoted moderate [[Islamism]]. In 1988, [[Islam]] was made the [[state religion]]. In 2010, the Bangladesh Supreme Court reaffirmed the principle of [[Secularity|separation of mosque and state]] in the constitution, although Islam remains the state religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/171752.pdf|title=BANGLADESH|last=|first=|date=|website=state.gov|publisher=United States Department of State|access-date=21 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government generally respects freedom of religion and ensures protection for minorities.&lt;ref name="state.gov"&gt;https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/171752.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Another debate on national identity concerns attitudes towards the Chittagong Hill Tracts. A low-level insurgency took place in the region to demand constitutional autonomy against Bengali settlements. Despite a [[Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord|peace treaty]] in 1997, the Bangladeshi government is yet to implement many of its commitments to protect [[adivasi]] land rights. However, the deletion in 1977 of ''Bangalee'' as the nationality term for the country's citizens, in order to be inclusive of non-Bengali minorities, also reflects attempts to build a more cosmopolitan Bangladeshi society.

==Culture==
{{See also|Culture of Bangladesh}}
Bangladeshi culture is a mainly a synthesis of indigenous Bengali and Islamic cultures. Festivals on the both the secular Bengali calendar and the Islamic calendar are widely celebrated. The tribes of the Chittagong Hill Tracts often follow the Burmese calendar, which reflect the country's links with Southeast Asia.

=== Languages ===
{{Main article|Languages of Bangladesh}}
[[File:Wikipedia in Bangla.svg|thumb|The word ''Wikipedia'' written in the [[Bengali script]]]]
The official language of Bangladesh is [[Bengali language|Bengali]], which is shared with the neighboring Indian states of West Bengal, Assam and Tripura. [[Bengali dialects]] vary between different regions of Bangladesh.

The oldest literary inscription in Bangladesh dates back to the 3rd century BCE. It was found at [[Mahasthangarh]] and is written in the [[Brahmi script]]. The language is [[Magadhi Prakrit]].&lt;ref&gt;http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Mahasthan_Brahmi_Inscription&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bengali language]] developed from Magadhi Prakrit, and its written from [[Apabhramsa]], between the 7th and 10th centuries. It once formed a single eastern [[Indo-Aryan language]] with [[Assamese language|Assamese]] and [[Odia language|Odia]], but later became distinct. It became an official language of the [[Sultanate of Bengal]], where it was spoken as the main vernacular language. It absorbed vocubulary from [[Arabic]], [[Farsi|Persian]] and [[Sanskrit]]. Bengali is the [[List of languages by number of native speakers|10th most spoken language in the world]]. The language was modernized during the [[Bengali renaissance]] in the 19th century. It has influenced other languages in the region, including [[Chakma language|Chakma]], [[Rohingya language|Rohingya]], Assamese, Odia and [[Nepali language|Nepali]]. The indigenous [[Bengali alphabet]]s descended from Brahmi serves as the Bengali script.

The [[Bengali Language Movement]] in East Pakistan was a key catalyst of forming Bangladeshi identity. It is commemorated by [[UNESCO]] as [[International Mother Language Day]], as part of worldwide efforts to preserve linguistic heritage.

Bangladesh is also home to number of minority indigenous languages, including [[Santhali language|Santhali]], [[Garo language|Garo]], [[Marma language|Marma]], Chakma and [[Bishnupriya Manipuri language|Bisnupriya Manipuri]].

=== Surnames ===
{{Main article|Bangladeshi name}}
Bangladeshis Muslims typically but not exclusively carry surnames that have [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] origins. Bangladeshi Hindus have Sanskritized Bengali surnames. Many Bangladeshi Christians have Portuguese surnames. Buddhists have a mixture of Bengali and Tibeto-Burman surnames.

The '''Mama''' are a sub-division of the Bhil community found in the state of [[Rajasthan]] in [[India]]. They are known as Mama Bhil because they are followers of the [[Mama Baleshwar Dayal]] sect of [[Hinduism]]. The sect gets its name from Mama Baleshwar Dayal, who starting preaching to the [[Bhil]]s of [[Kushalgarh]] [[tehsil]] of [[Banswara District]]. Their clans are referred to as ataks.&lt;ref name="PoIR XXXVIII 1 165-169"&gt;People of India Rajasthan Volume XXXVIII Part One  edited by B.K Lavania, D. K Samanta, S K Mandal  &amp; N.N Vyas pages 165 to 169 Popular Prakashan&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maman are a community of small and medium-sized farmers. Most of their settlements are exclusively Kataria, and each of them contains an informal caste association. This acts as an instrument of social control, punishing those who transgress community norms. They are entirely [[Hindu]] and unlike other [[Bhil]] groups do not have non [[Brahminical]] tribal deities. The Kataria speak the [[Bagri language|Bagri]] dialect of [[Rajasthani language|Rajasthani]].&lt;ref name="PoIR XXXVIII 1 165-169"/&gt;

== Marriage ==

Like other Bhil groups, they are [[endogamy|endogamous]] and practice clan [[exogamy]]. This despite the recent but comparatively greater level of [[Brahminical]] [[Sanskritisation]].

In the UK, a civil registrar ceremony cannot include [[hymn]]s, religious readings or [[prayer]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://celebratewithmusic.co.uk/songs-you-cant-have-at-a-civil-ceremony/ |publisher=Wedding Music Designer (Simon Jordan) |type=article |title=Music Not Allowed at Civil Ceremonies |contribution=England and Wales}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[marriage]] must take place at a registered or licensed venue to be legally valid. Many private premises are licensed to hold civil ceremonies. As well as each party to the marriage signing the register, signatures of two witnesses are also required.&lt;ref name="Mallender Rayson 2005"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mallender |first=P. |last2=Rayson |first2=J. |title=The Civil Partnership Act 2004: A Practical Guide |publisher=Cambridge University Press |series=The Civil Partnership Act 2004: A Practical Guide |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-521-61792-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ogyKasL13woC&amp;pg=PA24 |access-date=June 18, 2018 |page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most [[United States|American]] jurisdictions, civil registrar ceremonies are subject to the same requirements as religious ceremonies, including venue reservation fees, [[marriage license]] fees, and age restrictions. The ceremony may take place in many places, including courthouses, parks, gardens, banquet halls, hotels, and other approved venues. Many venues may also accommodate the reception. Like non-civil ceremonies, the formality and style of the ceremony depend entirely on the tastes of the couple.

== Scotland: civil registrar ceremonies &amp; civil ceremonies ==
Civil Registration of all Births, Deaths &amp; Marriages has been compulsory in Scotland since 1855 when the UK government passed several Acts &amp; Bills, effectively to stop the Scottish Traditional Practice of Legal Weddings being performed by communities.

[[File:scottish marriage ceremony.jpg|left|thumb|140px|A Celtic Handfast or Wedding Blessing (performed by a Civil Celebrant) with witnesses present, at Glamis, Scotland.]]

In 1847, the Scotsman said that "Everybody knows that, by the law of Scotland, the marriage ceremony can be performed with as perfect legal effect by a blacksmith as by a clergyman." The government wanted to end the Scottish practice of regarding a couple as married if they stated as much in front of witnesses. Scottish Registration Bills were accompanied by Bills to reform the law of marriage. This was opposed by the Church of Scotland, concerned that the new civil weddings would discourage people from getting married in a church.

In the end, the government dropped the marriage proposals, the session clerks were paid to be registrars, and the Treasury met the cost of the new system. That allowed the bill to be passed by Parliament and approved by [[Queen Victoria]] on August 7, 1854. The new system of civil registration started on January 1, 1855.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/press/news2004/150ann-press.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216130226/http://gro-scotland.gov.uk/press/news2004/150ann-press.html |archivedate=2009-02-16 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Effectively since 1855, Civil Marriage Ceremonies have not been legal in Scotland except if performed by an employee of the government, usually in a registrars office. These Civil Registrar Ceremonies are completely non-religious and are not the same as Civil Ceremonies.

A Civil Ceremony remains within the local community in Scotland and is performed by a trusted member of the community, on behalf of the family &amp; community involved. A Civil Celebrant will never force upon you or mention their own beliefs at your ceremony, nor will he/she insist that you join any religious or non-religious body in order to secure their services.

A Civil Ceremony can be completely religious, completely non-religious or a little bit of both and can take place almost anywhere the family &amp; community wish (except some religious buildings and churches) at home, in a hotel, at a castle, at sea, in the woods, in the family garden, or any location which is special to the person or persons for whom the ceremony is for. A Civil Celebrant allows you to choose readings, poems, and music based on your own values, wishes, and beliefs. A Civil Ceremony is unique and a Civil Celebrant understands the diversity of all people and his/her services reflect the cultural and social mix which is in our communities today.

A Civil Ceremony is "A Ceremony that is driven by the wishes, beliefs, and values of the person or family, not by the beliefs or ideology of the person conducting it."

You can get married or form a civil partnership in the UK if you’re:
* 16 or over
* free to marry or form a civil partnership (single, divorced or widowed)
* not closely related
* You need permission from your parents or guardians if you’re under 18 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

'''Only same-sex couples can form a civil partnership'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/marriages-civil-partnerships |title=Marriages and civil partnerships in the UK |publisher=GOV.UK |date= |accessdate=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Same-sex couples can:
* form a civil partnership in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland
* get married in England, Scotland and Wales
* convert your civil partnership into a marriage in England, Scotland and Wales

== Australia ==
Civil ceremonies were legalised in Australia in 1973.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

To be legally married in Australia, a person must:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ag.gov.au/FamiliesAndMarriage/Marriage/Pages/Getting-married.aspx |title=Getting married &amp;#124; Attorney-General's Department |publisher=Ag.gov.au |date=2017-12-09 |accessdate=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* not be married to someone else
* not be marrying a parent, grandparent, child, grandchild, brother or sister
* be at least 18 years old, unless a court has approved a marriage where one party is aged between 16 and 18 years old
* understand what marriage means and freely consent to marry
* use specific words during the ceremony
* give written notice of their intention to marry to their authorised celebrant, within the required time frame.

== Hong Kong ==
In Hong Kong, the Marriage (Introduction of Civil Celebrants of Marriages and General Amendments) Ordinance ("the Marriage Amendment Ordinance") came into force on 13 March 2006. It empowered the Registrar of Marriages to appoint civil celebrants of marriages and, to enable a marriage to be celebrated before a civil celebrant at any time and place, other than the office of the Registrar of Marriages or a deputy registrar of marriages (a "marriage registry") or a place of worship licensed under the Ordinance.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community economic [[analysis]] is a comprehensive rationale where people in a community challenge common methodologies within the system in an effort to increase net efficiency. During this process factors affecting the community are analyzed to address economic needs and to pinpoint unfulfilled opportunities. Upon completion of the analysis the group decides what can and should be done to improve the economic conditions within the community, and then move to put the agreed-on economic goals and objectives into action.

}}
'''Dawood Company''' and '''D-Company''' are terms coined by the [[Indian media]] for the [[Mumbai underworld]] [[Organized crime|organized criminal]] syndicate founded and controlled by [[Dawood Ibrahim]], an [[Indian mafia]] don, [[drug dealer]] and wanted [[terrorist]]. In 2011, Ibrahim, along with his D-Company, was number three on the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]'s "[[The World's 10 Most Wanted Fugitives|World's 10 Most Wanted Fugitives]]" list.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/2011/06/14/most-wanted-fugitives_slide_4.html "Dawood 4th 'most wanted' criminal on Forbes list"]. ''The Times of India''. (29 April 2008). Retrieved 16 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[Dawood Ibrahim]] established a criminal syndicate in 1970s India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=1993 Mumbai blasts |author=Husain, F.| date=1993-03-12|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_pictures/5337210.stm |newspaper=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other prominent members of the gang include [[Chhota Shakeel]],  [[Tiger Memon]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.firstpost.com/india/its-official-again-ahead-of-nsa-talks-fresh-photo-passport-copy-of-dawood-confirm-hes-in-pakistan-2403302.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yakub Memon]], and [[Abu Salem]]. The organization has a history of rivalry with the [[Mumbai police]] and other underworld dons such as [[Chhota Rajan]], [[Ejaz Lakdawala]], who was arrested in Canada in 2004, and [[Arun Gawli]].

==History==
In the 1970s,  Dawood Ibrahim worked for a local smuggler named Basu dada. Basu dada had a close friendship with Dawood's father, who was a police constable. However, Basu dada and Dawood had a falling-out after Basu Dada insulted the latter's father. In 1976, Dawood - along with seven of his close friends and his elder brother [[Shabir Ibrahim Kaskar]] - attacked Basu dada with empty soda bottles.

After this incident Basu Dada's key enforcer Khalid Phelewan persuaded Dawood to start his smuggling operations, which led to the formation of the D Company. Dawood and his elder brother Shabir, with the help of Khalid Phelewan, began their smuggling operations. This ultimately led them to clash with the Pathan gang, the most influential gang in Mumbai at the time. By 1986, D Company had eliminated most of the Pathan gang leadership - emerging as the dominant gang in Mumbai.

In 1993, D-Company associates were accused of organizing the [[1993 Bombay bombings]]. {{citation needed|date=October 2016}}, although Dawood denies any involvement to this day.

In 1997, D-Company former member Abu Salem was responsible for the murder of [[Super Cassettes Industries T-Series|T-Series]] founder and [[Bollywood music]] producer [[Gulshan Kumar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Mafia Calls The Shots|journal=[[Outlook (magazine)|Outlook]]|date=25 August 1997|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/magazine/story/the-mafia-calls-the-shots/204098}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Indian intelligence agencies managed to link Dawood Company with the [[2G spectrum case]], through [[DB Realty]] and DB Etisalat (formerly Swan Telecom) promoted by [[Shahid Balwa]]. Later in March, security at CBI headquarters in Delhi was tightened after it had been suggested that D-Company might launch an attack in an attempt to destroy documents relating to the ongoing probe of the 2G spectrum case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=2G: Dawood planning to attack CBI HQ? |url=http://www.zeenews.com/news695021.html |publisher=''[[Zee News]]''|date= 23 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Dawood threat to CBI over 2G probe? |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-03-23/india/29177758_1_swan-telecom-spectrum-scam-2g |publisher=''[[The Times of India]]'' |date=23 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, a US Congressional report alleged that the D-Company was a "5,000-member criminal syndicate operating mostly in Pakistan, India, and the United Arab Emirates," which has a "strategic alliance" with ISI and has "forged relationships with Islamists, including Lashkar-e-Taiba and al-Qaida." However, the report had no political implications, and was mainly to brief lawmakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Dawood-is-a-terrorist-has-strategic-alliance-with-ISI-says-US/articleshow/5418149.cms|title=Dawood is a terrorist, has 'strategic alliance' with ISI, says US - Times of India|work=The Times of India|access-date=2017-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
At times, Dawood Company has been linked to the Bollywood film industry, as well as real estate and betting businesses, from which it is said to derive considerable revenue. The 2002 film ''[[Company (film)|Company]]'' is based loosely on its activities, as well as its sequel (prequel to the storyline) ''[[D (film)|D]]'' (2005), ''[[Shootout at Lokhandwala]]'' (2007), and ''[[Once Upon a Time in Mumbai]]'' (2010).&lt;ref name=em&gt;{{cite web |title=Akshay to play dreaded don Dawood? |url=http://www.emirates247.com/entertainment/films-music/akshay-to-play-dreaded-don-dawood-2011-03-07-1.364805 |date=7 March 2011|publisher=Emirates247 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2013 movie ''[[Shootout at Wadala]]'' is based on the rise of the D-Company.

[[Ruthenians|Ruthenian]] ([[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] and [[Belarus]]ian) and non-[[Lithuania]]n lands too. Today, mainly [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]] ([[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] and [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]]) is spoken in Podlaskie, while [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] is preserved by the small but compact [[Lithuanian minority in Poland|Lithuanian minority]] concentrated in the Sejny County.

==Statistics==
At the end of 2009 in [[Podlaskie Voivodeship]] there were 1189.7 thousand inhabitants, 3.1 per cent of the
total population of Poland. The average density of the population, the number of the population per 1 km2,
was 59. The urban population in the same period was 60.2 per cent of the total number of inhabitants of the voivodeship, where the percentage of females in the total population amounted to 51.3 per cent. A statistical inhabitant of Podlasie was 37.7 years old, whereas in 2008 – 37.5 years old. The latest population projection predict consistent decrease in the population in Podlaskie Voivodeship. In the next 26 years it will decrease by 117 thousand persons due to the aging of the population.

In 2009 in Podlaskie Voivodship there were 7557 marriages registered, 3.6 per cent fewer than in 2008. At the same time there were 2040 divorces decreed, 11.1 per cent more than 2008, and 117 separations, 19.9 per cent fewer than 2008. During 2009 there were 12202 live births noted, a 2.2 per cent increase over 2008. At the same
time 12165 people died, a 4.5 per cent more than 2008. Natural increase in 2009 reached 37 persons
(in the previous year – 304).

In 2009 there were 10973 persons who moved to Podlaskie from other voivodeships and 400 from abroad. Conversely there were 12625 persons who moved from Podlaskie to other voivodeships of Poland and 469 out of Poland completely. The balance of migration was statistically similar to the one noted in 2008, a net decrease of  1721 persons (2008's figure was a net loss of 1698).

==History==
Until the 19th century, Podlaskie was populated by the Polish-speaking gentry, [[Jew]]s (primarily in towns), and [[Ruthenians|Ruthenian]] [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Greek-Catholics]] speaking a dialect related to modern [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] - the so-called ''[[Khakhlak]]'' (''Chachlak'') dialect, which derived its name from a derogatory term for [[Ukrainians]] (''khakhol'' or ''[[khokhol]]'' being the name of the traditional [[haircut]] of [[Ukrainian Cossacks]]). In the 19th century, the inhabitants of Podlaskie were under the rule of the [[Imperial Russia|Russian Empire]], with [[Southern Podlasie]] constituting a part of Russian-controlled [[Congress Poland]]. After 1831, Russian authorities forbade the Greek-Catholic faith in northern Podlaskie and it disappeared from the area. In 1875, Russians forbade this rite in Southern Podlasie as well, and all Greek-Catholic inhabitants were forced to accept the [[Eastern Orthodox]] faith. However, the resistance of the local people was surprisingly strong and Ruthenian speakers from this area rejected the Orthodox faith. In 1874, [[Pratulin Martyrs|Wincenty Lewoniuk]] and 12 companions were killed by Russian soldiers in Pratulin. In reaction to these measures, the Ruthenians of Podlaskie began to identify themselves with the national movement of the Catholic Poles.

In 1912, Russian authorities issued a tolerance edict that made it possible to change confessions from Orthodox to Roman Catholic (but not to Greek-Catholic). A majority of the inhabitants of Southern Podlasie changed their faith from Orthodox to Roman Catholic. At present, very few people in Podlaskie continue speaking [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]] ([[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]) and nearly all consider themselves Poles. The counties along the border with Belarus are populated by [[Belarusians]].

Podlaskie is also the cultural center of Poland's [[Lipka Tatars|Tatar]] minority as well. After the annexation of [[Kresy|eastern Poland]] into the [[Soviet Union]] following World War II, Poland was left with only 2 Tatar villages, [[Bohoniki]] and [[Kruszyniany]]. A significant number of the Tartars in the territories annexed to the USSR repatriated to Poland and clustered in cities, particularly [[Białystok]]. In 1925 the [[Muslim Religion Association]] - Muzułmański Związek Religijny  was formed in Poland in Białystok. 1n 1992, the [[Organization of Tatars of the Polish Republic]] (Związek Tatarów Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej) with autonomous branches in Białystok and Gdańsk began operating.

A number of Polish Tatars from Podlaskie emigrated to the US at the beginning of 20th century and settled mostly in the north eastern states (although there is also an enclave in Florida). A small but active community of these descendants of [[Lipka Tatars]] still exists in New York City. "The Islamic Center of Polish Tatars" in New York City until recently had its own mosque in [[Brooklyn]] (106 Powers Street, Brooklyn, NY 11211 USA, originally build in 1928).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,758343,00.html | work=Time | title=Religion: Ramadan | date=1937-11-15 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3903">Estimates vary for the number of people with '''disabilities in Nigeria'''. The [[World report on disability]], published in 2011, said about 25 million [[Nigeria|Nigerians]] had at least one [[disability]], while 3.6 million of these had very significant difficulties in functioning.&lt;ref name=cbm&gt;{{cite web|title=Nigeria|url=http://www.cbm.org/Nigeria-266847.php|publisher=Christian Blind Mission|accessdate=28 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2006 Nigerian census reported 3,253,169 people with disabilities, or 2.32% of the total population of 140,431,790 in that year.&lt;ref name=adry&gt;{{cite web|last1=Umeh|first1=Ngozi C|last2=Adeola|first2=Romola|title=Nigeria|url=http://www.adry.up.ac.za/index.php/2013-1-section-b-country-reports/nigeria|website=African Disability Rights Yearbook|accessdate=28 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Centre for Citizens with Disabilities]], a Nigerian NGO, claims the census did not capture the full extent of disability in Nigeria, and has called on Nigeria's National Population Commission to cooperate with the [[Nigerian Ministry of Women Affairs|Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development]] for the 2016 census in order to measure disability more accurately.&lt;ref name="ccd-lackofdata"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nze|first1=Emeka|title=NPC Lacks Data on Persons with Disabilities- Chair|url=http://ccdnigeria.org/index.php/2015/12/10/npc-lacks-data-on-persons-with-disabilities-chair/|website=Centre for Citizens with Disabilities|accessdate=2 February 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160212160509/http://ccdnigeria.org/index.php/2015/12/10/npc-lacks-data-on-persons-with-disabilities-chair/|archivedate=12 February 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The five most common types of disabilities in Nigeria are, in descending order, [[visual impairment]], [[hearing impairment]], [[physical impairment]], [[intellectual impairment]], and [[physical impairment]].&lt;ref name="adry" /&gt;

Nigeria ratified the [[United Nations]] [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] on 30 March 2007 and its [[Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities|Optional Protocol]] on 24 September 2010.&lt;ref name="adry" /&gt; The Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development is charged with submitting reports on progress, but has yet to do so as of 2013.&lt;ref name="adry" /&gt;

A 2008 study by the [[United Kingdom]] [[Department for International Development]] found that the public, the Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development, and disabled people's organizations (DPOs) in Nigeria understood disability within a discourse of welfare and charity.&lt;ref name="dfidstudy"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lang|first1=Raymond|last2=Upah|first2=Lucy|title=Scoping Study: Disability Issues in Nigeria|url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lc-ccr/downloads/scopingstudies/dfid_nigeriareport|publisher=United Kindgdom Department for International Development|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is as opposed to emphasis on social adaptation, inclusion, and empowerment as advocated by the [[social model of disability]] that is generally favored in the field of [[disability studies]].&lt;ref name="sclmdl"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|first1=Tom|authorlink1=Tom Shakespeare|title=The Disability Studies Reader|chapter=The Social Model of Disability|date=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also found that two national [[umbrella organization|umbrella]] DPOs, the [[Joint National Association of Persons with Disabilities]] (JONAWPD) and the [[Association for the Comprehensive Empowerment of Nigerians with Disabilities]] (ASCEND), often strongly disagreed while both presuming to speak on behalf of all Nigerians with disabilities, impeding their ability to lobby the government.&lt;ref name="dfidstudy" /&gt;

{{Cross-dressing}}
'''Drag queens''' are people, usually male, who dress in [[Drag (clothing)|women's clothing]] and often act with exaggerated [[femininity]] and in feminine [[gender role]]s with a primarily entertaining purpose. They often exaggerate make-up such as eyelashes for dramatic, comedic or satirical effect. Drag is closely associated with [[gay]] men and [[gay culture]], however a drag queen can be of any sexual orientation. Drag queens vary widely by class and culture and dedication, from professionals who star in films to people who try drag very occasionally.

The activity, which is called ''doing drag'', has many motivations, from individual self-expression to mainstream performance. Drag queen activities among stage and [[Street performance|street performers]] may include [[lip sync|lip-syncing]], live singing, dancing, participating in events such as [[gay pride parade]]s, [[drag pageants]], or at venues such as [[cabaret]]s and [[discotheque]]s.

===Female impersonator===

Another term for a drag queen is ''female impersonator.''&lt;ref&gt;When Cross Dressing was a crime http://www.advocate.com/arts-entertainment/books/2015/03/12/tbt-when-cross-dressing-was-crime?page=full&lt;/ref&gt; Although this is still used, it is sometimes regarded as inaccurate, because not all contemporary drag performers are attempting to [[Passing (gender)|pass]] as women. Female impersonation has been and continues to be illegal in some places, which inspired the drag queen [[José Sarria]] to hand out labels to his friends reading, "I am a boy", so he could not be accused of female impersonation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/sarria_j.html |title=&gt;&gt; social sciences &gt;&gt; Sarria, José |publisher=glbtq |date=1923-12-12 |accessdate=2014-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203005833/http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/sarria_j.html |archivedate=2013-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; American drag queen [[RuPaul]] once said, "I do not impersonate females! How many women do you know who wear seven-inch heels, four-foot wigs, and skintight dresses?" He also said, "I don't dress like a woman; I dress like a drag queen!".&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Susan Corso (April 15, 2009).

===Alternative terms===
[[File:2004-GayPrideBrazil-1.jpeg|thumb|200px|alt=4 individuals portraying women|Drag queens walking in a parade in [[São Paulo, Brazil]].]]
Some drag queens  may prefer to be referred to as "[[gender-specific pronoun|she]]" while in drag and desire to stay completely in character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://transequality.org/issues/resources/understanding-drag |title=Understanding Drag |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-04-28 |website=transequality.org |publisher=National Center for Transgender Equality |access-date=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other drag performers, like RuPaul, seem to be completely indifferent to which pronoun is used to refer to them. In his words, "You can call me he. You can call me she. You can call me Regis and Kathie Lee; I don't care! Just so long as you call me."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=[[Rupaul]]|title=Lettin' It All Hang Out: An Autobiography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mq-HAAAAIAAJ|publisher=Hyperion Books|date=June 1995|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drag queens are sometimes called [[transvestism|transvestites]], although that term also has many other connotations than the term ''drag queen'' and is not much favored by many drag queens themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Ford, Zack.

Many drag performers refer to themselves as drag artists, as opposed to drag queens, as contemporary forms of drag have become [[nonbinary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Knauf |first1=Ana Sofia |title=Person of Interest: Arson Nicki |url=https://www.thestranger.com/features/2017/02/01/24834816/person-of-interest |website=The Stranger |publisher=Tim Keck |accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lam |first1=Teresa |title=Getting to Know Non-Binary Drag Artist Rose Butch |url=https://hypebae.com/2018/6/rose-butch-non-binary-drag-performer-lgbtq-pride-month-vancouver-canada-interview |website=Hypebae |accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of drag ==

=== Europe ===

==== Pantomime dames ====
In the late 1800s to the mid-1900s, [[pantomime dame]]s became a popular form of female impersonation in Europe.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  This was the first era of female impersonation in Europe to use comedy as part of the performance, in contrast to the serious [[Shakespeare's plays|Shakespearean]] tragedies and [[Italian opera]]s.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The dame became a stock character with a range of attitudes from "charwoman" to "grande dame" that was mostly used for improvisation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The most famous and successful pantomime dame was [[Dan Leno]].  After [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], the theatre and movie scenes were changing, and the use of pantomime dames declined.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== America ===
[[File:Wench character 3.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Eugene d'Ameli]], a white man, dressed in [[blackface]] as an African American woman for a [[minstrel show]] in the late 19th century]]

==== Minstrel shows ====
Development of the drag queen in the United States started with the development of the [[blackface]] [[minstrel show]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite |last=Boyd |first=Nan Alamilla |title=Wide-Open Town |publisher=University of California Press |year=2003 |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/25351 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally the performers would only mock African American men, but as time went on they found it amusing to mock African American femininity as well.  They performed in comedic skits, dances, and "wench" songs.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite |last=Bean |first=Annemarie |title=Female Impersonation in Nineteenth-Century American Blackface Minstrelsy |publisher=[[New York University]] |date=2001 |url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304709304/abstract/21B0435A209F4C54PQ/1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These minstrel shows and their "wench players" were used by white men to both mock and oppress women and African Americans.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

==== Vaudeville and female impersonators ====
[[File:Julian Eltinge (the fascinating widow).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Julian Eltinge]] as a female impersonator in the 1910s]]
The broad comedic stylings of the minstrel shows helped develop the [[vaudeville]] shows of the late 1800s to the early 1900s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With this shift, the "wench players" became "prima donnas", and became more elegant and refined, while still retaining their comedic elements.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  While the "wenches" were purely American creations, the "prima donnas" were inspired by both America and European cross-dressing shows, like [[William Shakespeare|Shakespearean]] actors and [[castrato|castrati]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; With the United States shifting demographics, including the shift from farms to cities, [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] of African Americans, and an influx of [[immigration to the United States|immigrants]], vaudeville's broad comedy and music expanded the audience from minstrelsy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With vaudeville becoming more popular, it allowed female impersonators to become popular as well.  Many female impersonators started with low comedy in vaudeville and worked their way up to perform as the prima donna.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Moore, F. Michael. ''Drag!: Male and Female Impersonators on Stage, Screen, and Television: An Illustrated World History''. Jefferson, N.C: McFarland &amp; Company, 1994.
&lt;/ref&gt; Famous female impersonator [[Julian Eltinge]] found success in this and eventually made his way to the [[Broadway theatre|broadway]] stage performing as a woman.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  At this time being a female impersonator was seen as something for the straight white male, and any deviation was punished.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Connection with [[sex work]] and [[homosexuality]] eventually lead to the decline of vaudeville during the [[Progressive Era]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Both the minstrelsy and vaudeville eras of female impersonation led to an association with music, dance, and comedy that still lasts today.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Night clubs ====
In the early to mid-1900s, female impersonation had become tied to the [[LGBT community]]{{Dubious|reason=This cannot be right as stated; there was no LGBT community in the mid 1900s, that didn't form till later|date=May 2017}} and thus criminality, so it had to change forms and locations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  It moved from being popular mainstream entertainment to something done only at night in disreputable areas, such as San Francisco's [[Tenderloin, San Francisco|Tenderloin]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Here female impersonation started to evolve into what we today know as [[Drag (clothing)|drag]] and drag queens.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Baker, Roger.

As [[LGBT culture]] has slowly become more accepted in American society, drag has also become more, though not totally, acceptable in today's society.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Protests ====
{{Main|Cooper Do-nuts Riot|Compton's Cafeteria riot|Stonewall riots|Invasion of the Pines}}
The [[Cooper Do-nuts Riot]] was a May 1959 incident in Los Angeles in which drag queens, lesbians, transgender women, and gay men rioted; it was one of the first [[LGBT]] uprisings in the United States.&lt;ref name="Out"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Moffitt|first1=Evan|title=10 Years Before Stonewall, There Was the Cooper's Donuts Riot|url=https://www.out.com/today-gay-history/2015/5/31/today-gay-history-10-years-stonewall-there-was-coopers-donuts-riot|accessdate=30 June 2017|work=Out Magazine|agency=Here Media Inc.|date=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Compton's Cafeteria riot]], which involved drag queens and others, occurred in San Francisco in 1966.&lt;ref name="boyd"&gt;Boyd, Nan Alamilla (2004). "San Francisco" in the ''Encyclopedia of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgendered History in America'', Ed. Marc Stein. Vol. 3. Charles Scribner's Sons. pp. 71–78.&lt;/ref&gt; It marked the beginning of [[transgender]] activism in San Francisco.&lt;ref name="boyd"/&gt;

On March 17, 1968, in Los Angeles, to protest [[entrapment]] and harassment by the LAPD, two drag queens known as "The Princess" and "The Duchess" held a St. Patrick's Day party at [[Griffith Park]], a popular [[cruising for sex|cruising]] spot and a frequent target of police activity. More than 200 gay men socialized through the day.&lt;ref&gt;Witt, Lynn, Sherry Thomas and Eric Marcus (eds.) (1995). ''Out in All Directions: The Almanac of Gay and Lesbian America'', pg. 210. New York, Warner Books. {{ISBN|0-446-67237-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Drag queens were also involved in the [[Stonewall riots]], a series of spontaneous, violent demonstrations by members of the [[LGBT community]] against a [[police raid]] that took place in the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, at the [[Stonewall Inn]], located in the [[Greenwich Village]] neighborhood of [[Manhattan]], New York City. The riots are widely considered to be the catalyst for the [[gay liberation]] movement and the modern fight for [[LGBT rights in the United States]].&lt;ref name=diversity&gt;{{cite web |author=National Park Service |title=Workforce Diversity: The Stonewall Inn, National Historic Landmark National Register Number: 99000562 |url=http://www.nps.gov/diversity/stonewall.htm |publisher=US Department of Interior |year=2008 |accessdate=January 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/2012_Presidential_Election/Obama_inaugural_speech_references_Stonewall_riots.html |title=Obama inaugural speech references Stonewall gay-rights riots |publisher=North Jersey Media Group Inc |date=January 21, 2013 |accessdate=January 21, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723025158/http://www.northjersey.com/news/2012_Presidential_Election/Obama_inaugural_speech_references_Stonewall_riots.html |archivedate=July 23, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the summer of 1976, a restaurant in [[Fire Island Pines, New York|Fire Island Pines]], [[New York (state)|New York]], denied entry to a visitor in drag named Terry Warren. When Warren's friends in Cherry Grove heard what had happened, they dressed up in drag, and, on [[United States Bicentennial|July 4, 1976]], sailed to the Pines by [[water taxi]]. This turned into a yearly event where drag queens go to the Pines, called the [[Invasion of the Pines]].

==== Story time in libraries ====
In December 2015, Radar Productions and [[Michelle Tea]] developed the concept of "Drag Queen Story Hour".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lamarche |first1=Una |title=Drag Queen Story Hour Puts the Rainbow in Reading |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/19/style/drag-queen-story-hour-puts-the-rainbow-in-reading.html |accessdate=22 June 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=19 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Launched at the [[San Francisco Public Library]], Drag Queen Story Hour was adopted by the [[Brooklyn Public Library]] in the summer of 2016, and has since traveled to various libraries, museums, bookstores, and recreation centers, and parks across the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Drag Queen Story Hour|url=https://www.dragqueenstoryhour.org/#about|website=Drag Queen Story Hour -- drag queens reading stories to children in libraries, schools, and bookstores|publisher=Drag Queen Story Hour|accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Art of drag ==
[[File:ESC2014 - Austria 16.jpg|thumb|alt=man with long hair and a beard, wearing a radiant gold dress|[[Conchita Wurst]], the winner of the Eurovision Song Contest 2014.]]
The process of getting into drag or into character can take hours. A drag queen may aim for a certain style, celebrity impression, or message with their look. Hair, make-up, and costumes are the most important essentials for drag queens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dukechronicle.com/articles/2002/10/03/dude-diva-how-become-drag-queen |title=Dude to Diva: How to Become a Drag Queen &amp;#124; The Chronicle |publisher=Dukechronicle.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Drag queens tend to go for a more exaggerated look with a lot more makeup than a typical feminine woman would wear.

Some people do drag simply as a means of self-expression,&lt;ref name="PsyToday"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2015/05/drag_queens_find_form_of_self-.html |title=Performing in drag is all about self-expression for some West Michigan men |last=Jackson |first=Angie |date=May 20, 2015 |access-date=August 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but often drag queens (once they have completed a look) will go out to clubs and bars and perform a "drag show."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Mark|last=King |url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/aug/12/drag-queen-cookie-monstar |title=A working life: the drag queen &amp;#124; Money |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2014-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many drag queens do dress up for money by doing different shows, but there are also drag queens that have full-time jobs but still enjoy dressing up in drag as a hobby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tom-bartolomei/10-myths-about-drag-queens_b_2979249.html |title=Tom Bartolomei: 10 Myths About Drag Queens |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=2013-04-01 |accessdate=2014-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many parts of the drag show, and of the drag queens' other intellectual properties, cannot be protected by intellectual property law. To substitute the lack of legal protection, drag queens revert to social norms in order to protect their intellectual property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sarid|first1=Eden|title=Don’t Be a Drag, Just Be a Queen – How Drag Queens Protect their Intellectual Property without Law|journal=Florida International University Law Review|date=2014|volume=10|issue=1|url=http://ecollections.law.fiu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1242&amp;context=lawreview|accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Drag shows and venues ===
[[File:Lorellasukkiarini.jpg|thumb|alt=a drag queen putting on lip liner|A drag queen preparing stage make-up.]]
A ''[[drag show]]'' is an entertainment consisting of a variety of songs, [[monologue]]s or skits featuring either single performers or groups of performers in drag meant to entertain an audience. They range from amateur performances at small bars to elaborately staged theatrical presentations. Many drag shows feature performers singing or [[Lip sync|lip-synching]] to songs while performing a pre-planned [[pantomime]], or dancing. The performers often don elaborate costumes and makeup, and sometimes dress to imitate various famous female singers or personalities. Some events are centered around drag, such as [[Southern Decadence]] where the majority of festivities are led by the Grand Marshals, who are traditionally drag queens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southerndecadence.net |title=Southern Decadence Official Website |publisher=Southerndecadence.net |date=2013-09-03 |accessdate=2014-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In music ===

While some male music celebrities wear exaggerated feminine clothing as part of their show, they are not necessarily drag queens. For example, [[Boy George]] wears drag queen style clothes and cosmetics but he once stated he was not a drag queen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi6offnQQN0 |title=Boy George: "I'M Not A Dragqueen!" At YouTube |publisher=YouTube.com |date=2007-12-27 |accessdate=2014-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[RuPaul]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dragqueendiaries.com/rupaul.htm Rupaul Biography] Drag Queen Diaries&lt;/ref&gt; is a professional drag queen performer and singer.

Examples of songs where lyrics refer to drag queens:

=== In television === 
''[[What Would You Do? (ABC News series)|What Would You Do?]]'', airing since early 2008, has had episodes featuring drag queens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/WhatWouldYouDo/video/parents-disapprove-drag-queen-sons-eat-56275264|title=Video: What Would You Do: Parents disapprove of their drag queen son's look while out to eat|first=ABC|last=News|website=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/WhatWouldYouDo/drag-queens-harassed-cafe/story?id=12332984|title=Drag Queens Harassed: What Would You Do?|first=A.

In mid-2008, RuPaul began producing ''[[RuPaul's Drag Race]]'', a [[reality television]] [[game show]] which began airing in February 2009. The premise of the program has several drag queens compete to be selected by RuPaul and a panel of judges as "America's next drag superstar". It inspired the similar spin-off shows ''[[RuPaul's Drag U]]'' and ''[[RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars]]''.

In 2018, ''[[Celebrity Big Brother 21 (UK)|Celebrity Big Brother]]'' featured Queen Shane Jenek (drag name [[Courtney Act]]) as one of its contestants, placing first in the season with 49.43% of the public vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/celebrity-big-brother/news/a849084/courtney-act-winner-celebrity-big-brother-2018/|title=Courtney Act crowned winner of Celebrity Big Brother|date=2018-02-02|work=Digital Spy|access-date=2018-08-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In education ==
While drag queens have a prevalent status as entertainers, they play a role in educating people on gender roles and stereotyping. Professor Stephen Schacht of Plattsburgh State University of New York began introducing his and his students experiences of attending a Drag Show to his gender/sexualities class to challenge his students ideas of dichotomy. Over time he began inviting students to attend with him. He gathered from his students that after attending the drag show they had a new appreciation for gender and sexuality and often become very vocal about their new experiences in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J082v46n03_14 |title=Browse journals by subject |publisher=Tandfonline.com |date= |accessdate=2018-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several "International Drag Day" holidays have been started over the years to promote the shows. In the U.S. Drag Day is typically celebrated in early March.

A televised drag competition, ''[[RuPaul's Drag Race]]'', is the most successful program on the [[Logo (TV channel)|Logo]] television network. In 2016, the show won a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/shows/rupauls-drag-race|title=RuPaul's Drag Race|website=Television Academy|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, the show became the first show to win a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality-Competition Program]] and a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program]] in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Billboard |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/pride/8475768/rupauls-drag-race-emmys-win-reaction-tweets |title='RuPaul's Drag Race's Emmys Win: See The Best Reactions |publisher=Billboard |date= |accessdate=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners/2018/outstanding-host-for-a-reality-or-reality-competition-program |title=Nominees/Winners &amp;#124; Television Academy |publisher=Emmys.com |date= |accessdate=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners/2018/outstanding-reality-competition-program |title=Nominees/Winners &amp;#124; Television Academy |publisher=Emmys.com |date= |accessdate=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, its winners and contestants have yet to receive the same level of recognition as mainstream reality show contestants.

RuPaul received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] for his contributions to the television industry on March 16, 2018, making him the first drag queen to be given such an award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/06/23/entertainment/hollywood-walk-fame-2018/index.html |title=Hollywood Walk of Fame Class of 2018 revealed |last=France |first=Lisa Respers |date=23 June 2017 |website=CNN |access-date=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vogue.com/article/rupaul-hollywood-walk-of-fame|title=RuPaul Is the First Drag Queen to Get a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''economic catalyst''' is an [[entrepreneur]] or company that precipitates a fundamental change in business or technology. A more precise definition of a catalyst is based on the new economics of multi-sided platforms.  In this literature an "economic catalyst" is an entity that has (a) two or more groups of customers; (b) who need each other in some way; but (c) can't capture the value from their mutual attraction on their own; and (d) rely on the catalyst to facilitate value-reaction reactions between them. For-profit businesses, joint ventures, cooperatives, standard-setting bodies, and governments operate catalysts.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, David S. and Schmalensee, Richard, [[Catalyst Code|Catalyst Code: The Strategies Behind the World's Most Dynamic Companies]], p.3 (Harvard Business School Press; 1 edition; May 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[payment card]] industry illustrates the concept. [[Diners Club]] was the first modern payment card, introduced in 1950. To create this product Diners Club had to get two groups of customers on board. Consumers who wanted to pay with a card and merchants who wanted to accept payment with this card. These two groups of customers each wanted the card to consummate transactions between them. Any type of dating environment also exemplifies economic catalyst. A nightclub needs men and women and facilitates their meeting and interacting.

Catalysts are the businesses at the heart of the new economics of [[two-sided markets]]. They are multi-sided platforms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2433">'''Elias Alsabti''' (Elias A. K. Alsabti) was an [[Iraq]]i medical researcher who was exposed for [[scientific misconduct|scientific fraud]].

Alsabti built a career as an [[impostor]]. In Iraq, the medical student managed to get a reputation as a [[cancer research]]er. He reworked articles from lesser known [[scientific journal]]s into entries that he submitted for publication elsewhere. By pretending to be a member of the [[Jordan]]ian royal family, he obtained a generous scholarship by the Jordanian government and in 1977 moved to the [[United States]]. In the late 1970s, he worked as a cancer specialist for various American research institutions, moving on when his utter lack of knowledge and understanding was noticed. He is estimated to have published 50 to 60 plagiarized articles in a few years, many of them in reputable journals, often with co-authors who have never published with anyone but him, which led to the suspicion that they may not exist.

Several journals retracted publications after the fraud was exposed. Alsabti's license to practice medicine in [[Massachusetts]] was revoked in 1988.

'''Eritreans in Sweden''' are citizens and residents of [[Sweden]] who are of [[Eritrea]]n descent.


== History ==
In 2014, the first secretary at the Eritrean embassy in Sweden was asked to leave the country due to having organised espionage on Eritrean [[Immigration to Sweden|migrants in Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.svt.se/nyheter/inrikes/eritreadiplomat-skickas-hem|title=Eritreadiplomat skickas hem|last=Nyheter|first=SVT|work=SVT Nyheter|access-date=2017-12-02|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 Swedish Television reported that the [[Swedish Migration Agency]] had hired regime sympathisers as interpreters to interrogate migrants from Eritrea. The interpreters stated that if migrants spoke ill of the government of Eritrea their relatives still in country might suffer reprisals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.svt.se/nyheter/inrikes/regimtrogna-tolkar-problem-for-svensk-eritreaner|title=Regimtrogna tolkar problem för svensk-eritreaner|last=Nyheter|first=SVT|work=SVT Nyheter|access-date=2017-12-02|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==

The following image is a [[family tree]] of every king, monarch, confederation president and emperor of [[Germany]], from [[Charlemagne]] in 800 over [[Louis the German]] in 843 through to [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] in 1918. It shows how every single ruler of Germany was related to every other by marriages, and hence they can all be put into a single tree.

For ease of understanding the [[dynasty|royal house]] names and dates have been put in at the appropriate places. The dynasties covered are the [[Carolingians]], [[Conradines]], [[Ottonians]], [[Salian dynasty|Salians]], [[Supplinburg]]er, [[Hohenstaufen]], [[House of Welf|Welf]], [[Habsburg]], [[House of Nassau|Nassau]], [[House of Luxembourg|Luxemburg]], [[Wittelsbach]], [[House of Lorraine|Lorraine]], [[Habsburg-Lorraine]], [[House of Bonaparte|Bonaparte]] and [[Hohenzollern]].

Only undisputed kings are included here; this excludes rulers whose claims were disputed such as the co-rulers [[Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall]] and [[Alfonso&amp;nbsp;X of Castile]].

'King of Germany' does not necessarily mean that the king was referred to as such, although in every case he was both ''[[de jure]]'' and ''[[de facto]]'' ruler over the territory currently known as Germany and hence the various terms are practically equivalent. Until 911 the kings were known as 'Kings of [[East Francia]]'. After that the title fluctuated between 'King of Germany' and 'King of the Germans'. From [[Henry IV of Germany|Henry&amp;nbsp;IV]] on, the kings were "German King (technically [[King of the Romans]])", a reference to the claim on [[Rome]], although this was not often ruled by them.&lt;ref&gt;a&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Feminist Studies''''' is a [[peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] covering [[women's studies]] that was established in 1972. It is an independent nonprofit publication housed at the [[University of Maryland]] in [[College Park, Maryland]]. Besides scholarly articles, the journal also publishes [[creative writing]] (poetry, fiction, and memoirs), art work and art essays, [[book review]]s, political and social commentaries, interviews, and activist reports.

Occasionally, special issues are published on topics such as Chicana Studies; Women and Prison; Women's Work, Social Class, and Socialism; Sexuality, Sexual Violence, and Sexual Identities; Culture and History in the New South Africa; the Body and Healthcare; Rethinking the Global; and Conjugality and Sexual Economies in India.

== History ==
The journal was established in 1972 in [[New York City]] by feminist academics and activists who were committed to creating a [[scholarly journal]] with high standards and community relevance. This feminist network believed that the women’s movement needed an analytic forum to engage the issues raised by the movement and to bring together the contributions of feminist activists and scholars. Claire Moses was the journal’s editorial director for over three decades, running it alongside a collective of scholars in multiple disciplines and locations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.feministstudies.org/aboutfs/people/claire-moses.html Dr. Claire Mh
oses].&lt;/ref&gt; The journal continues to be edited by a collective, with Ashwini Tambe now at its helm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.feministstudies.org/aboutfs/people/ashwini_tambe.html Dr. Ashwini Tambe].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Fidjeri''''' ([[Arabic]]: '''الفجيري'''; sometimes spelled '''''fijri''''' or '''''fidjeri''''') is the specific repertoire of [[vocal music]] sung by the [[pearl divers]] of Eastern Arabia's [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|coastal Gulf states]], especially [[Bahrain]] and [[Kuwait]]. A lead singer is backed up by a [[choir|chorus]] of accompanying singers and clapping. The accompanying instruments to a ''fidjeri'' ensemble are a small double-sided hand-[[drum]], known as the ''[[mirwas|mirwās]]'' ({{lang-ar|المرواس}}) and the ''jāhlah'' ({{lang-ar|الجاهلة}}), a clay pot played with both hands.

There are eight genres of fijiri: Sanginni (sung on the beach, not on the boat), Bahri, Adsani, Mkholfi, Haddadi, Hasawi, Zumayya, and Dan, the last two actually being subgenres of Hasawi and Mkholfi respectively. Bahri and Adsani are the two main genres. Pearl diver singers are referred to in Arabic as ''nahham'' ({{lang-ar|نهام}}).

[[Salem Allan]] and Ahmad Butabbaniya are two of the most well-known fijiri singers from Bahrain.

Hunt shot [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] police officer Vincent Adolfo twice in an East Baltimore alley on November 18, 1985, after Adolfo spotted him running from a stolen [[Cadillac]]. He was captured five days later at a bus station in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]. In June 1986, a Baltimore jury convicted Hunt of first degree murder, and he was sentenced to death the following month. Eleven years later, Hunt was executed by [[lethal injection]] at the Maryland State Penitentiary, at the age of 38.

Societies or individual [[institution]]s that fail to adapt and [[institutional change|change]] at a sufficient pace are sometimes described as displaying '''institutional sclerosis'''. It is associated with continuity and stability, and may hamper [[economic growth]].

==National level==
The American political economist [[Mancur Olson]], in his 1984 book, "The Rise and Decline of Nations", first offered "institutional sclerosis" as a partial explanation for the divergent growth rates experienced between the winners (with relatively low post-war growth rates) and losers (with relatively high post-war growth rates) of [[World War II]].  In [[liberal democracies]] experiencing continuity and stability, [[interest group]]s form over time and grow to exact [[economic rent|rents]], becoming vested.  The accumulation of vested interests and [[rent-seeking|rent-seekers]] ultimately slows the ability of a government to reform, adapt, and secure perfectly [[competitive market]]s thanks to a related phenomenon studied by Olson: the [[collective action problem]].  This sclerosis saps an economy's dynamism and lowers growth rates.  In liberal democracies with young institutions, by contrast, competition remains perfect and natural economic dynamism and [[creative destruction]] ensue, generating high growth.&lt;ref&gt;Mancur Olson. "The Rise and Decline of Nations" (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1984).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Within an institution==
Institutional sclerosis may also be applied to an institution that is effective in changing in some areas but unable to adjust to changes in other areas. Institutions can evolve efficiently either by expanding original goals to meet a changing environment or by including more members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tow|first=William|title=Security Politics in the Asia-Pacific: A Regional-Global Nexus?|year=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|pages=49–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, however, institutions or organizations face difficulties adjusting to new structures or internal policies.

A  '''Jewish Buddhist''' is a person, very often American, with a Jewish background, who practices forms of [[Buddhist]]-linked [[meditation]] and [[spirituality]]. Their interest may be in meditation rather than Buddhism or religion. (In those cases where the individual practices a religion, this may be both [[Judaism]] and [[Buddhism]], but often Jewish is an ethnic designation and the person's main religious practice is Buddhism.)

The term ''Jubu'' was first brought into wide circulation with the publication of ''[[The Jew in the Lotus]]'' (1994) by [[Rodger Kamenetz]].

{{Spanish name|Mendoza|Cárdenas}}
'''Jorge Luis Mendoza Cárdenas''', commonly referred to by his alias '''La Garra''' (English: The Claw), is a Mexican suspected drug lord and high-ranking leader of the [[Jalisco New Generation Cartel]] (CJNG), a criminal group based in [[Jalisco]]. Security forces suspect that La Garra heads the drug trafficking operations for the CJNG in the United States under [[Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes]] (alias "El Mencho"), the top leader of the criminal group. La Garra reportedly coordinates marijuana, cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine shipments to Los Angeles, San Jose, Atlanta, and New York City from Mexico.

Unlike his counterparts, few details are known of his criminal background. In 2008, he was arrested for his alleged participation in the murder of a family of six in Jalisco. However, when those involved were charged in an indictment, La Garra was released from prison without a public explanation. His name was not mentioned in the legal proceedings. Over the years, he rose to the top of the CJNG's leadership chain. In 2016, the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) identified La Garra as one of top three leading members of the CJNG.

==Early life and career==
Unlike his counterparts in the [[Jalisco New Generation Cartel]] (CJNG), few official details exist of La Garra's criminal background.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Mexican state authorities suspected he was involved in a 2008 murder incident case.&lt;ref name="TpaNT" /&gt; In 25 July 2008,&lt;ref name="mkTLx" /&gt; authorities identified La Garra as part of a gang that participated in the murder of six family members in [[Zapotlán el Grande|Zapotlán el Grande, Jalisco]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The six victims were Félix Bautista Lugo (aged 69); Carmen Campos Cárdenas (aged 45); her sister, Adriana Patricia Campos Cárdenas (aged 24); Roberto Bernardino Campos (aged 17), son of Carmen and stepson of Félix; and Magali and Mayra Bautista Campos (aged 8 and 7), daughters of Carmen and Félix.&lt;ref name="q36Rf" /&gt; All but two of the victims (Roberto Bernardino and Carmen) had [[coup de grâce]] wounds.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HnXQ9" /&gt; These two were stabbed and killed by asphyxia respectively.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The family was originally from [[Zacatecas City|Zacatecas]] and [[San Luis Potosí]], and had bought the house from the former [[Governor of Jalisco]] and [[Secretariat of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fisheries and Food (Mexico)|Secretariat of Agriculture]], [[Alberto Cárdenas|Alberto Cárdenas Jiménez]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Though the family shared a last name with the politician,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; he claimed that they were not blood-related to him and were only long-time friends.&lt;ref name="ZWPOg" /&gt; The family had moved to the new home two months prior to the incident because one of their relatives was kidnapped.&lt;ref name="QirBX" /&gt; 

When the bodies were found, investigators concluded that the victims were killed 36 and 48 hours prior to their discovery.&lt;ref name="pAPkU" /&gt; Investigators also located a vehicle owned by the family, and discovered that one of the victims had withdrawn a large sum of money from a bank prior to the murder.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Investigators later found out that the incident started as far as 4 April, when Roberto Bernardino was kidnapped and released after the family paid a large sum of money. During that incident, one former agent of Jalisco's anti-kidnapping squad came in contact with the family. He noticed that the family was wealthy and relayed that information to a kidnapping ring he was working with. They worked together to kidnap the entire family and force them to withdraw money from their bank accounts. However, Roberto Bernardino noticed that the Jalisco official and the kidnapping group were working together and was killed. The abductors then decided to murder the rest of the family to cover up their collusion.&lt;ref name="OFdBd" /&gt;

On 1 August, La Garra and six other men were arrested for their alleged involvement in the crime.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; According to state officials, they stole [[Mexican peso|MXN]]$400,000 from the family. Police officers believe this sum of money was intended to be used as ransom money by the family to pay the kidnappers for their relatives' return. Officials also seized two vehicles, multiple rounds of ammunition, two guns, and communication equipment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; On 30 August 2008, a court in Jalisco formally issued seven charges for the murder. However, La Garra's name was not in any of the indictments.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Authorities claimed that the case was not related to drug trafficking and was strictly a kidnapping scheme conducted by an abduction ring and an anti-kidnapping agent working for the Jalisco state government.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; La Garra was released from prison without any public explanation from authorities. Years after his release, La Garra's influence within the CJNG grew and he positioned himself as one of the leading members of the criminal group.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Leadership tenure ==
In November 2016, the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) identified La Garra as one of the top three leaders of the CJNG, along with El Mencho and [[Abigael González Valencia]] (alias "El Cuini").{{efn|At the time the report was released, [[Abigael González Valencia]] (alias "El Cuini") had been arrested.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He was arrested by Mexican authorities in 2015.&lt;ref name="detienen" /&gt;}}&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; La Garra's decision-making power and role within the CJNG is lower than El Mencho's.&lt;ref name="nC1AQ" /&gt; According to the DEA report, the CJNG was responsible for shipping wholesale amounts of methamphetamine, marijuana, cocaine, and heroin to the United States from the border crossings in [[Tijuana]], [[Ciudad Juárez]], and [[Nuevo Laredo]]. The CJNG then used distribution centers in [[Los Angeles]] and [[Atlanta]] to move narcotics across the country. In the report, the DEA stated that La Garra's organization was the newest of the main drug trafficking groups in Mexico and had risen to prominence through aggressive territorial expansion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In Mexico, La Garra reportedly operates mainly in Jalisco, [[Colima]], [[Guanajuato]], [[Nayarit]], [[Veracruz]], [[Morelos]], [[Guerrero]], and [[Michoacán]].&lt;ref name="d1H4E" /&gt;

At least 26 active drug-related investigations by the DEA were open that year against CJNG members, including La Garra. In addition to him, other suspected Mexican drug lords were mentioned in the report. From the [[Sinaloa Cartel]], the DEA targeted [[Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán]], [[Ismael Zambada García]] (alias "El Mayo"), and [[Dámaso López Núnez]] (alias "El Licenciado"); from the [[Juárez Cartel]] they targeted [[Jesús Salas Aguayo]] (alias "El Chuyín"), [[Carlos Arturo Quintana Quintana]] (alias "El 80"), and [[Julio César Olivas Torres]] (alias "El Sexto"); from the [[Gulf Cartel]] it targeted [[José Antonio Romo López]] (alias "Don Chucho") and [[Petronilo Moreno Flores]] (alias "Panilo"); from [[Los Zetas]] and the [[Beltrán-Leyva Cartel|Beltrán Leyva Cartel]] they targeted [[Omar Treviño Morales|Óscar Omar Treviño Morales]] (alias "Z-42") and [[Héctor Beltrán Leyva]] (alias "El H") respectively.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; At least six of the eight men mentioned in the DEA reports were not wanted by the Mexican government at the time of the announcement. The DEA was looking to apprehended all these individuals, including La Garra.&lt;ref name="VksDe" /&gt; 

In a report the following the year, the DEA increased the number of active investigations against the CJNG hierarchy to 46. La Garra was listed a main CJNG member again, along as his counterparts El Mencho and El Cuini. In addition to Los Angeles and Atlanta, the DEA reported that the CJNG also had distribution centers in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] and [[New York City]]. Several of the previously mentioned suspected drug lords were kept in this report, but there were some additions to the release. For the Sinaloa Cartel, the DEA included [[Rafael Caro Quintero]]; in the Gulf Cartel, they added [[José Alfredo Cárdenas Martínez]] (alias "El Contador"); for ''Los Zetas'' they included [[Juan Francisco Treviño Chávez]] (alias "El Kiko") and [[Juan Gerardo Treviño Chávez]] (alias "El Huevo"); and for the Beltrán Leyva Cartel they added [[Fausto Isidro Meza Flores]] (alias "Chapo Isidro"), [[Juan Francisco Patrón Sánchez]] (alias "H2"), and [[José Luis Ruelas Torres]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 

Security forces suspect that La Garra is one of the leading coordinators of the CJNG in the United States.&lt;ref name="bl0XO" /&gt; Based on his influence in the United States, investigators suspect that La Garra may not live in Mexico and may be residing in the United States, specifically [[California]], where the CJNG has a major corridor through Tijuana.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; According to the DEA, Mexican nationals who work for drug trafficking groups may enter the U.S. legally or illegally, and try to blend in with the larger Mexican-American communities in the U.S. In some cases, these U.S.-based members may have family ties with suspected drug lords in Mexico, or have ties with the communities where the criminal group was originally from. Upon a successful career in Mexico, some U.S.-based members return to Mexico to work directly with the criminal group that employed them.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9474">[[File:Agent Compean.jpg|thumb|Former [[United States Border Patrol|U.S. Border Patrol]] Agent Jose Compean]]

'''José Alonso Compeán''' (born in 1976) is a former [[United States Border Patrol]] Agent, convicted of shooting (wounding) a fleeing, [[Alien (law)|illegal alien]] drug smuggler on the [[United States–Mexico border]] near [[El Paso, Texas]], on February 17, 2005, and of covering up the shooting: i.e. "obstructing justice by willfully defacing the crime scene". On 19 January 2009, President Bush commuted the sentences of both Compean and fellow agent [[Ignacio Ramos]], effectively ending their prison term on March 20, 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Riechmann |first=Deb. |url=http://www.startribune.com/politics/national/president/37826749.html?elr=KArksLckD8EQDUoaEyqyP4O:DW3ckUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aUUZ |title=Bush commutes prison sentences of 2 former US border agents |work=Associated Press |date=January 19, 2009 |publisher=Startribune.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123050756/http://www.startribune.com/politics/national/president/37826749.html?elr=KArksLckD8EQDUoaEyqyP4O%3ADW3ckUiD3aPc%3A_Yyc%3AaUUZ |archivedate=January 23, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and they were released on February 17, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kfoxtv.com/news/18730957/detail.html |accessdate=February 17, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221005415/http://www.kfoxtv.com/news/18730957/detail.html |archivedate=February 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
Compeán was patrolling a section of border with Ramos when they spotted a man crossing the border. They stopped him in a van containing 743 pounds of [[marijuana]],&lt;ref name=CHRON&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/special/immigration/5349437.html |work=Houston Chronicle |accessdate=2007-12-08|last=Carroll |first=Susan |title=Ex-agents get boost in court}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he ran. Compeán said he thought the suspect had a gun and was going to shoot him so he fired at him first. His shot missed but his partner, hearing gunfire, fired in order to defend Compeán and "allegedly" hit the suspect in the [[buttocks]]. They lost sight of the man, but said they saw him on the Mexican side of the border. They mistakenly did not believe that he had been injured, so they did not report the incident even though it involved the discharge of their firearms.&lt;ref name=AP&gt;{{cite news|last=Kunzleman |first=Michael |date=2007-12-03 |work=Washington Post |title=Appeal Heard in Border Agents' Shooting}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FOX&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,311996,00.html |work=FoxNews.com |title=Mexican Drug Smuggler Shot By Border Agents Indicted on Drug Smuggling Charges|date=2007-11-16 |accessdate=2007-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial and aftermath==
The two officers were arrested after the drug smuggler, [[Osvaldo Aldrete Dávila]], filed a complaint against them. After a two-week [[jury trial]], Compeán was found [[guilt (law)|guilt]]y on 11 counts, including discharging a [[firearm]] during the commission of a [[violent crime]], which by itself carries a federally mandated 10-year [[minimum sentence]]. Without that charge, both agents involved would have received far shorter sentences. Instead, Compeán was sentenced to 12 years in prison, and his partner, Ignacio Ramos, was sentenced to 11 years in prison.&lt;ref name="AP" /&gt; Aldrete Dávila was granted immunity to testify against the two agents and received six border crossing visas to come to the United States and testify.&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/07/25/dobbs.7.25/index.html?iref=newssearch |work=CNN.com |date= 2007-07-26|accessdate=2007-12-07 |title=Tonight's Facts: Border Drug War }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arrest, trial, conviction and imprisonment of Compeán and Ramos has created a firestorm of controversy from those opposing illegal immigration. Efforts have been launched in the [[United States Congress]] calling on [[United States President|President]] [[George W. Bush]] to pardon the two men.&lt;ref name=FOX /&gt; On 2007-12-06 a resolution was introduced in the Congress seeking to commute their sentences.&lt;ref name="EP1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elpasotimes.com/newupdated/ci_7653013 |work=elpasotimes.com |last=Guilot |first=Louie |accessdate=2007-12-07 |date=2007-12-06 |title=Resolution introduced to free Ramos, Compeán }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 15, 2007, Aldrete Dávila, the man shot by Ramos, was arrested at a border crossing in [[El Paso]], [[Texas]]. A sealed indictment had been issued for his arrest on a variety of drug smuggling charges. According to the indictment, his alleged crimes occurred after he testified for the United States against the agents. If convicted he faces up to 40 years in prison.&lt;ref name=FOX /&gt;

==Appeals==
The two men appealed their case to the [[5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals]] in [[New Orleans]].&lt;ref name=AP /&gt;  On 28 July 2008 the Fifth Circuit court of appeals rejected the appeals of both Ramos and Compean.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iXihPpn22rM9HFMgrc8yMDXAbyWQD9271H700]{{dead link|date=November 2012|bot=Legobot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attorneys for Compeán and Ramos argued, that among other factors, Aldrete Dávila was improperly allowed to assert his rights against self-incrimination in the trial.

They charged that in the written immunity deal with prosecutors, he was given immunity against any charges thus removing the possibility of self-incrimination during Compeán's trial.&lt;ref name=EP&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elpasotimes.com/newupdated/ci_7618547 |work=elpasotimes.com |last=Guilot |first=Louie |accessdate=2007-12-07 |date=2007-12-02 |title=Immunity deal key in Ramos, Compean appeal }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During oral arguments before the three-judge appeals panel, Judge E. Grady Jolly remarked that "For some reason, this one got out of hand it seems to me ... It does seem to me like the government overreacted here."&lt;ref name=CHRON /&gt;&lt;ref name="EP2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elpasotimes.com//ci_7627140?IADID=Search-www.elpasotimes.com-www.elpasotimes.com |title=Judge calls prosecuting ex-agents an overreaction |last=Guilot |first=Louie |date=2007-12-04 |accessdate=2007-12-08 |work=elpasotimes.co }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=USA&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement of U.S. Attorney Johnny Sutton following today's oral argument before the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in RE: United States of America v.

==Disposition (Sentence Commuted)==
On January 19, 2009, [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] commuted the sentences of Jose Compean and Ignacio Ramos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/politics/national/president/37826749.html?elr=KArksLckD8EQDUoaEyqyP4O:DW3ckUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aUUZ |accessdate=January 19, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123050756/http://www.startribune.com/politics/national/president/37826749.html?elr=KArksLckD8EQDUoaEyqyP4O%3ADW3ckUiD3aPc%3A_Yyc%3AaUUZ |archivedate=January 23, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Petition for pardon==
Although Bush commuted the two men's sentences, he did not grant them a full pardon, thus leaving Compean and Ramos with criminal records that made it hard for them to find jobs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/politics/sd-me-hunter-pardon-20170927-story.html&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2017, US Congressman [[Duncan D. Hunter]] wrote a letter to president [[Donald Trump]] asking him to give both men a full pardon.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/09/28/rep-duncan-hunter-urges-trump-to-pardon-ex-border-patrol-agents.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

Donsbach was the founder of Hospital Santa Monica in [[Rosarito]], [[Baja California]], [[Mexico]]. Following the death of [[Coretta Scott King]] while under treatment at the clinic in January 2006, the facility was shut down by Mexican health officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = James C., Jr. | last = McKinley | title = Mexico Closes Alternative Care Clinic Where Mrs. King Died | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/04/international/americas/04mexico.html?ex=1156910400&amp;en=e157771a028165be&amp;ei=5070 | work = [[New York Times]] | date = 2006-02-06 | accessdate = 2007-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971 Donsbach was convicted of practicing medicine without a license in [[California]] after undercover agents observed him prescribing unproven remedies to patients while claiming to be a [[medical doctor]]. Many of the remedies were only available from Westpro Labs, a company operated by Donsbach. He pleaded guilty and received a fine and two years' summary probation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.casewatch.org/ag/ca/donsbach1971.shtml|author=Stephen Barrett, MD|title=Kurt Donsbach Convicted of Practicing Medicine without a License (1971)|accessdate=2007-02-12|work=Casewatch}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

On April 9, 2009, Donsbach was arrested during his Internet radio health show and charged with 11 felony counts, including dispensing unapproved drugs.&lt;ref name=Martinez&gt;Martinez A. [http://www3.signonsandiego.com/stories/2009/apr/10/1m10fakedoc224656-phony-doctor-accused-preying-vul/ Phony doctor accused of preying on vulnerable patients.] ''[[San Diego Union Tribune]]'' April 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Prosecutors also charged Donsbach with offering [[neuropeptide]]s to his patients.  These drugs contained [[nimesulide]], which have been banned in Europe because they cause high rates of liver failure and have resulted in some deaths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.10news.com/news/19171219/detail.html Man Charged With Practicing Medicine Without License], April 13, 2009 San Diego 10 News.com&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2010, a San Diego judge ruled there was enough evidence for the case against Donsbach to proceed to trial. Donsbach faced up to 12 years and eight months if convicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdnn.com/sandiego/2010-01-12/local-county-news/courts/phony-bonita-doctor-charged-with-13-felony-counts#ixzz0ec22Eh44 |title=Phony Bonita doctor charged with felonies | work=San Diego News Network (SDNN) | date=January 12, 2010 | deadurl=yes | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100120081510/http://www.sdnn.com/sandiego/2010-01-12/local-county-news/courts/phony-bonita-doctor-charged-with-13-felony-counts | archive-date=January 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The case ended with a plea deal with Donsbach facing up to a year in jail, followed by probation.&lt;ref name=10news/&gt;

On December 13, 2010, Donsbach pleaded guilty to 13 additional felony charges, including practicing medicine without a license and selling misbranded drugs.&lt;ref name=10news&gt;[http://www.10news.com/news/26120515/detail.html Bonita Man Pleads Guilty To Posing As Doctor. Kurt Donsbach, 75, Faces Up To Year In Jail], 13 Dec. 2010, San Diego 10 News.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Donsbach's activities have repeatedly been criticized by Dr. [[Stephen Barrett]] of [[Quackwatch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/donsbach.html|author=Stephen Barrett, MD|title=The Shady Activities of Kurt Donsbach|accessdate=2007-02-12|work=Quackwatch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/donsbachuniv.html|author=Stephen Barrett, MD|title=Some Notes on Donsbach University|accessdate=2007-02-12|work=Quackwatch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Donsbach's now defunct Donsbach University in Huntington Beach, California was also widely recognized in academic circles as a prolific producer of false diplomas in the health and nutrition field. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gambrill |first1=Eileen |title=Propaganda in the Helping Professions |chapter=Introduction to the Players |location=Oxford, UK |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2012 |page=38 |accessdate=2017-03-10 |quote=The most prolific producer of spurious diplomas has been Donsbach University in Huntington Beach, California }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Benuerivermap.png|thumb|350px|Benue river basin. The main Kuteb region is south of Wukari, west of the [[Donga River]].]]
The '''Kuteb''' (or Kutep) people are an [[ethno-linguistic group]] in [[West Africa]], who speak the Kuteb language. The Kuteb Language is influenced by the Hausa language. Most of the Kuteb live in [[Taraba State]], [[Nigeria]].
Recently they have been involved in violent confrontations with other ethnic groups in which many people have been killed or forced to move.

==Background==

According to tradition the Kuteb migrated from [[Egypt]] about 1000 AD, eventually reaching their present location around 1510.&lt;ref name=gangum&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://kuteb.tripod.com/biography.html
 |title=he Kuteb People
 |author=William Ahmed Gangum
 |accessdate=2010-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Kuteb people are made of the following clans which is believed to be Children of Kuteb;
Lumbu, Ticwo, Rufu, Askaen, Bika (Zwika), Ticwo, Rubur, Tswaen, Acha, Likam, Cwumam, and the Rucwu

Traditionally they engaged in farming, hunting and fishing in the fertile lands of the [[Benue River]] basin.&lt;ref name=koops&gt;{{cite book

The people worshiped family idols, but also believed in a supreme being who created the world and brings health, rain and the harvest.
They were ruled by a paramount priest king, the Kwe Kukwen, selected by a council of elders representing the different Kuteb clans.&lt;ref name=gangum/&gt;
A 2007 report estimated the number of Kuteb people as approximately 100,000.
Most live in what is now [[Takum]] Local Government Area of [[Taraba State]], [[Nigeria]], although there are a few Kuteb villages in [[Cameroon]].&lt;ref name="koops"/&gt;

Under the British, who took control around 1900, the Kuteb were subject to the first-class [[Jukun people (West Africa)|Jukun]] ruler, or "Aku Uka" of the [[Wukari Federation]].&lt;ref name=koops/&gt;
In 1914, the British made the Kwe Kukwen the only graded and third class chief in the Takum part of the confederation, with the title of Kwe Takum. He was made paramount over other peoples in the area.&lt;ref name=comp796&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2010-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This change was resented by other ethnic groups of Hausa, Tiv, Chamba, Kukuns and Ichen, who forced the Ukwe Ahmadu Genkwe to leave Takum and reside elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The last Ukwe  Takum was Ali Ibrahim, ruling from 1963 to 1996.&lt;ref name=comp796/&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;Festus Ephraim Senior (2017)"The Kuteb of southern Taraba". Retrieved 2017-23-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==

The earliest direction for every activity in Kuteb land revolve round the theocratic role of the Kwe Kukwen, Akwen and Council of elders called Ndufu who represent the major known sub clans and extended families. Kukwen is the Chief-Priest located in Mbarikam or Ikam or Teekum and the Akwen are the minor priests who are heads of the other clans. This practice started with Kuteb himself as the paramount chief priest / King of the Kutebs. 
The Kwe Kukwen may be chosen from any clan. However, he must, on his election, come to reside in Teekum (Mbarikam Hill) being the ward of Likam and the Headquarters of the Kuteb Nation 
The traditional Kuteb political system is thus federal in nature. Even though the Kutebs recognised the seniority of Likam, the other clans had some autonomy to exercise powers of maintaining peace, protecting and achieving the interest of their respective clan members. However, such power ended where collective interest and programmes of the entire nation was to begin and where the settlement of disputes between individuals and clans were brought before the Kwe Kukwen. 
In addition to the political role the Kukwen and Akwen have a spiritual role, responsibility and authority. The roles are rooted in the religious belief of the Kutebs.

==Chieftaincy stool issue==

In the 1970s Takum was part of the old [[Benue Plateau State]].
The local government gazette recognized three main chieftaincy stools in the Wukari Federation for the [[Wukari]], [[Donga, Nigeria|Donga]] and Takum local government areas, each to be elected by their indigenous people.&lt;ref name=dtrust443&gt;{{cite web

 |work=Daily Trust
 |author=Theophilus Abbah
 |date=4 January 2009
 |accessdate=2010-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This law was changed by the governor [[Joseph Gomwalk]] in 1975, withdrawing the sole right of the Kuteb to select the holder of the Ukwe Chieftaincy stool of Takum from one of their two royal families.
The new law allowed for election of a [[Chamba people|Chamba]] chief, while making a Jukun man chairman of the selection committee and altering the composition of the committee to include Jukun and Chamba as well as [[Hausa people|Hausa]] and Kuteb.&lt;ref name=compass823&gt;{{cite web

 |title=The killing field of Takum
 |date=12 January 2009
 |author=Osu Stephen
 |work=Compass
 |accessdate=2010-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The justification was the changing demographics of Takum, but the result was disturbances that caused the government to ban the traditional annual Kuchichebe festival, when the land is blessed to ensure the next harvest will be fertile.
Later, similar festivals were banned in other Wukari Federation areas due to the trouble they caused.&lt;ref name=dtrust443/&gt;

In October 1997 the Taraba State military administrator [[Amen Edore Oyakhire]] sent a paper called ''Comprehensive brief on the Chieftaincy Stool of Takum Chiefdom Taraba State'' to the Armed Forces Ruling Council.&lt;ref name=compass823/&gt;
That month seven people were killed and seven houses razed in communal violence, and 31 people were arrested.
Oyakhire said anyone suspected of involvement in the communal violence would be treated as detractors of the transition to civil rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1998 the Taraba State Government also set up a Peace Committee which managed to negotiate a truce between the ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Ongoing conflict==

The Kuteb have been involved in ongoing violent conflicts with their neighbors. 
An ethnic crisis between the Jukun and Kuteb broke out in 1991.
On 27 December 2008 another crisis erupted in Takum over an alleged killing of a Jukun youth by Kuteb youths.
Perhaps 20 people died and thousands took refuge in the local military barracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2006 violent clashes again began between the Kuteb and the [[Tiv people|Tiv]], in which many people lost their lives.
In a December 2008 press conference the Taraba State Governor, [[Danbaba Suntai]], said he could see no end to the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender ([[LGBT]]) rights in [[Jordan]]''' are considered to be relatively advanced, compared to most other countries in the [[Middle East]]. 

Same-sex sexual activity was illegal in Jordan under the British Mandate Criminal Code Ordinance until 1951, when Jordan adopted its own penal code that did not criminalize homosexuality. Jordan is one of few Muslim countries to do so. However, LGBT people displaying public affection can be prosecuted for "disrupting public morality". A general interest gay magazine is published in Jordan. However, most [[LGBT]] persons face social discrimination not experienced by non-LGBT residents.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-25927595 |title=Where is it illegal to be gay? |accessdate=23 February 2014 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal laws==
The British Mandate Criminal Code Ordinance criminalized homosexuality with up to 10 years in prison, until 1951 when Jordan adopted its own penal code that did not criminalize homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;http://old.ilga.org/Statehomophobia/ILGA_SSHR_2014_Eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jordanian penal code no longer permits family members to beat or kill a member of their own family whose "illicit" sexuality is interpreted as bringing "dishonor" to the entire family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3088828.stm | title=Middle East 'Honour killings' law blocked | publisher=BBC News | date=8 September 2003 | accessdate=20 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2013, the newly revised Penal Code makes [[honor killing]]s, as a legal justification for murder, illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19443398/ns/world_news-mideast_n_africa/t/jordan-courts-sentence-honor-killings/#.UPsbpPJyGSo |title=Jordan courts sentence 2 for ‘honor killings’ - World news - Mideast/N.

The Jordanian penal code gives the police discretion when it comes to protecting the public peace, which has sometimes been used against gay people organizing social events [http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/08/jordan-homosexuality-gay-lesbian-rights-lgbt-conservative.html].

=== History ===

The first time that the Jordanian government made any public statement regarding LGBT rights was at the [[Fourth World Conference on Women]] held in 1995. The international conference sought to address women's rights issues on a global scale, and a proposal was made to have the conference formally address the human rights of gay and bisexual women. The Jordanian delegates to the conference helped to defeat the proposal.&lt;ref name="asylumlaw2000"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asylumlaw.org/docs/sexualminorities/Jordan%202%20SO%20%5B97-2000%5D.pdf |title=www.asylumlaw.org |publisher=www.asylumlaw.org |date= |accessdate=2016-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311084555/http://www.asylumlaw.org/docs/sexualminorities/Jordan%202%20SO%20%5B97-2000%5D.pdf |archivedate=11 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the kingdom's United Nations delegates have also opposed efforts to have the United Nations itself support LGBT rights, although this later proposal was eventually adopted by the United Nations.

The Jordanian government also tolerates a few cafes in Amman that are widely considered to be gay friendly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/08/jordan-homosexuality-gay-lesbian-rights-lgbt-conservative.html#ixzz3jxnbvtoT|title=Jordan LGBT rights|accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Books@Cafe opened up in 1997 and remains a popular bookstore and cafe for patrons supportive of "creativity, diversity and tolerance". In the twenty-first century, a Jordanian male model, Khalid, publicly came out and has been supportive of a general interest, gay-themed magazine published in Jordan. "Growing up, it was hard for me to find topics, subjects and publications that I could relate to! In my country, most magazines rejected me and my ideas due to my young age at the time, and I felt like an outcast in my own society!" Khalid told soginews.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=by miles |url=http://www.soginews.com/4881-mena/ |title=Innovative LGBTIQ Activist Gives Back to the Community |publisher=Sogi News |date=2015-01-27 |accessdate=2016-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150309120837/http://www.soginews.com/4881-mena/ |archivedate=9 March 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent reports suggest that although a large number of LGBT citizens are in the closet and often have to lead double lives, a new wave of younger LGBT people are beginning to come out of the closet and are becoming more visible in the country, working to establish a vibrant LGBT community of filmmakers, journalists, writers, artists and other young professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.black-iris.com/2008/05/09/movie-reviews-three-stories-from-amman/ |title=Movie Reviews &amp;#124; Three Stories From Amman at The Black Iris of Jordan |publisher=Black-iris.com |date= |accessdate=20 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only a few young Jordanians of the upper class are able to remain single. Most of these more "open" Jordanians are well educated and from prosperous middle class or wealthy families.

Initial research into the LGBT community in Jordan suggests that many of the same sort of social biases and conventions that exist within the gay community in the United States or Europe, also exist in Jordan.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}{{clarification needed|date=May 2018}}

=== Recent developments ===

In 2015, the Jordanian Ministry of Interior issue a statement about LGBT rights in response to publicity surrounding an event in Amman.
The statement said that LGBT rights conflicts with Islam, which the Constitution stipulates is the official religion, that Jordanian law criminalize holding public meetings without prior approval and as well as public conduct that breaches the peace or the decorum of society. This statement was in response to publicity surrounding LGBT rights event that was held in Amman.  A rough translation of the statement is as follows;  " The first clause: The Jordanian state is keen on respecting the Islamic dogma and the true islamic religion's doctrine which was clearly affirmed in the first article of the Jordanian Constitution that states: "Islam is the religion of the Jordanian State" and the provisions of the Jordanian civil law are in line with the provisions of the Islamic Sharia law, jurisprudence and customs as they are the source of legislation; therefore, recognizing LGBT groups is considered as a breach of the Islamic Sharia and subsequently the Jordanian Constitution. Any proposals by the sexually perverted to breach the provisions of Sharia Law and the general order, and for that the aforementioned proposals are considered a crime punishable by law. Second clause: Concerning the IDAHOT meeting; the government did not give its consent for it to be held, knowing that the Law of General Meetings number 7 of year 2004 and its amendments is responsible in organizing any public meeting and so the administrative governor should be informed about the meeting should it be held, which did not happen. Third clause: The Government does not possess any assuring intelligence for the existence of and official sponsorship by a foreign mission including the Embassy of the United States to the aforementioned meeting. Final clause: The government won't tolerate in enforcing the law's provisions to maintain security order and decorum while preserving its Muslim Arab principles and traditions; Therefore, we shall pursue whoever is proven to have breached these principles and submit them to the judiciary to execute the necessary legal action against them."

In 2017, [[Mashrou' Leila|Mashrou’ Leila]], a Lebanese-based band, was banned from performing in Jordan.  The ban had been issued by the Ministry of Interior, which conflicted with a previous decision by the Jordanian Tourism Board.  Conservatives objected to the band's liberal attitudes and the fact that one of the members of the band is gay. [https://www.albawaba.com/entertainment/what-jordanians-think-of-the-mashrou%27-leila-ban-988214]

==Transgender rights==

In 2014, Jordan's Cassation Court, the highest Court in Jordan, allowed a [[transsexual]] woman to change her legal name and sex to female after she brought forth medical reports from [[Australia]]. The head of the Jordanian Department of Civil Status and Passports stated that two to three cases of change of sex reach the Department annually, all based on medical reports and court orders.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ammonnews.net/article/208487&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018, the Jordanian Parliament passed the advanced medical responsibility law that defines "sex change" and "[[sex reassignment]]" making the first illegal and punishable with fine and jail time for any doctor who performs what the health committee in the parliament described as "sex change" which is changing the sex of someone who has the [[chromosomes]], genitals and secondary characteristics of one [[sex]].

==Media and press==

The Media Commission regulates the commercial exhibition and distribution of films and television shows in Jordan. In 2016, the Media Commission ruled that the film ''[[The Danish Girl]]'' could not be shown publicly because it "encouraged" deviance and public disorder. [http://www.7iber.com/culture/banned-film-and-television-censorship-in-jordan/]. Printed media is regulated by the Press and Publication law.

The Press and Publication Law was amended in 1998 and 2004. The initial document prohibited the depiction or endorsement of "[[sexual perversion]]", which may have included [[homosexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.article19.org/pdfs/press/jordan-draft-press-law.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The revised edition in 2004 has a few provisions of direct impact on LGBT rights. First, the content ban on "sexual perversion" has been replaced with a general requirement that the press "respect the values of ... the Arab and Islamic nation" and that the press must also avoid encroaching into people's private lives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.article19.org/publications/law/analyses/middle-east-north-africa.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614055534/http://www.article19.org/publications/law/analyses/middle-east-north-africa.html |date=June 14, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the first gay-themed Jordanian publication My.Kali arose. A year later, ''[[My.Kali]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://mykalimag.com/ My.Kali official website]&lt;/ref&gt; started publication online, named after openly gay model [https://i-d.vice.com/en_us/article/the-magazine-queering-the-middle-east Khalid Abdel-Hadi], making major headlines, as it is the first LGBT publication to ever exist in the MENA region, with one of the only faces in the pan Arab region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilgrandecolibri.com/2012/08/jordan-gay-mykalimag.html "Jordan: a gay magazine gives an hope to Middle East", ''Ilgrandecolibri.com'', retrieved 11 August 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaymiddleeast.com/country/jordan.htm |title=Gay Egypy |publisher=Gay Middle East |accessdate=20 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711080257/http://gaymiddleeast.com/country/jordan.htm |archivedate=11 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article for ''Al Jazeera English'' titled [http://jurhfalastini.tumblr.com/post/83809211374/pushing-for-sexual-equality-in-jordan 'Pushing for Sexual Equality in Jordan'] stated: "Earlier this year, they published the magazine’s 50th issue, and celebrated the magazine’s seven-year anniversary. Kali is on the cover, hugging a sculpture head, his naked torso covered in white dust. The headline reads: “Tell Me Little White Secrets!”" the article was soon removed by the official site, and pasted on blogs and pages instead, due to the huge stir the article caused at the time. "... an AJ foreign journalist wrote a favourable article two years ago on Jordan's only LGBTI magazine My.Kali Magazine but a day later the article was removed from its website and the journalist severely reprimanded." Journalist Dan Littauer writes on his official [https://www.facebook.com/danjournalist/posts/1751597721522663 Facebook page], regarding Qatar's attempts of hushing local medias, and freedom of the press.
The magazine regularly features non-LGBT artists on their covers to promote acceptance among other communities and was the first publication to give many underground and regional artists their first covers like [http://mykalimag.com/on-singer-yasmine-hamdan/ Yasmine Hamdan], both lead singer and violinist of band [[Mashrou' Leila]], [[Hamed Sinno]][http://mykalimag.com/on-hamed-sinno/] and [[Haig Papazian]], [[Alaa Wardi]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://mykalimag.com/on-youtube-star-alaa-wardi/ My.Kali Alaa Wardi cover]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zahed Sultan]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://mykalimag.com/on-zahed-sultan/ My.Kali Zahed Sultan cover]&lt;/ref&gt; and many more. "Jordan is a very traditional country, and we're considered controversial in Jordan for simply breaking the stereotype and stepping out of norm," Khalid told ''[[Egypt Independent]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/middle-eastern-lgbt-magazine-looking-%E2%80%98risky-expansion-arabic ''Egypt Independent'': Middle Eastern LGBT magazine looking risky expansion into Arabic]&lt;/ref&gt;

Events were held in the Jordanian capital Amman on the [[International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia]] in 2014 and 2015, mainly for educational purposes and for the purpose of raising voice for the community and discussing challenges. Many activists and members of the LGBT community and LGBT allies in Jordan attended the events. in the second event held in 2015 American ambassador in Jordan [[Alice Wells]] was one of the speakers. the event held in 2015 was published in almost all local media outlets.

In [[management]], a '''line function''' is any kind of daily operation such as [[purchasing]], [[manufacturing]], and [[marketing|selling]] that is directly involved in carrying out the purpose of an [[organization]]. This contrasts to a [[staff function]] (such as the [[human resources]] department), which involves the provision of advice and other support to those involved in a line function.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="503">The '''Porowakara''' were a minority community of wood cutters from [[Sri Lanka]]. They were a part of the feudal [[land tenure]] system of Sri Lanka but eventually became absorbed into larger communities. 

This community was classed as a sub-caste of the [[Govigama]] during the [[British Ceylon|British]] period.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14372">A '''tribunal of inquiry''' is an official [[review]] of events or actions ordered by a government body. In many [[common law]] countries, such as the [[United Kingdom]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Australia]] and [[Canada]], such a '''public inquiry''' differs from a [[Royal Commission]] in that a public inquiry accepts evidence and conducts its hearings in a more public forum and focuses on a more specific occurrence. Interested members of the public and organisations may not only make (written) evidential submissions as is the case with most inquiries, but also listen to oral evidence given by other parties.

Typical events for a public inquiry are those that cause multiple deaths, such as public transport crashes or [[mass murders]]. In addition, in the UK, the [[Planning Inspectorate]], an agency of the Department for [[Communities and Local Government]], routinely holds public inquiries into a range of major and lesser land use developments, including highways and other transport proposals.

[[Advocacy group]]s and [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]] political parties are likely to ask for public inquiries for all manner of issues. The government of the day typically only accedes to a fraction of these requests. The political decision whether to appoint a public inquiry into an event was found to be dependent on several factors. The first is the extent of media coverage of the event; those that receive more media interest are more likely to be inquired. Second, since the appointment of a public inquiry is typically made by government ministers, events that involve allegations of blame on the part of the relevant minister are less likely to be investigated by a public inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=7834671&amp;fileId=S0007123410000049 Sulitzeanu-Kenan, R. 2010. Reflection in the Shadow of Blame: When do Politicians Appoint Commissions of Inquiry?, ''British Journal of Political Science'' 40(3): 613-634].&lt;/ref&gt; Third, a public inquiry generally takes longer to report and costs more on account of its public nature. Thus, when a government refuses a public inquiry on some topic, it is usually on at least one of these grounds.

The conclusions of the inquiry are delivered in the form of a written report, given first to the government, and soon after published to the public. The report will generally make recommendations to improve the quality of government or management of public organisations in the future. Recent studies have shown that the reports of public inquiries are not effective in changing public opinion regarding the event in question.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aas.sagepub.com/content/48/1/3.abstract Sulitzeanu-Kenan, R &amp; Y. Holzman-Gazit. 2016. Form and Content: Institutional Preferences and Public Opinion in a Crisis Inquiry, ''Administration &amp; Society'' 48(1): 3-30].&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, public inquiry reports appear to enjoy public trust only when they are critical of the government, and tend to lose credibility when they find no fault on the part of the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9299.2006.00605.x | volume=84 | title=IF THEY GET IT RIGHT: AN EXPERIMENTAL TEST OF THE EFFECTS OF THE APPOINTMENT AND REPORTS OF UK PUBLIC INQUIRIES | year=2006 | journal=Public Administration | pages=623–653 | last1 = Sulitzeanu-Kenan | first1 = Raanan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==France==
In France, any major project which requires the compulsory acquisition of private property must, before being approved, be the subject of a public inquiry (usually by the [[Prefect (France)|prefect]] of the [[Regions of France|region]] or [[Departments of France|department]] in which the project will take place); the favourable outcome of such an inquiry is a ''[[déclaration d'utilité publique]]'', a formal finding that the project will produce public benefit. This procedure was established by the law on expropriation enacted on the 7th July 1833,&lt;ref&gt;''Loi du 7 juillet 1833 sur l'expropriation pour cause d'utilité publique''&lt;/ref&gt; which extended an earlier law enacted in 1810.&lt;ref&gt;''Loi du 8 mars 1810 sur l'expropriation pour cause d'utilité publique''&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
In Britain, there are two types of public inquiry, the statutory inquiry set out in terms of the [[Inquiries Act 2005]] (or its predecessor), or the non-statutory inquiry, often used in the investigate controversial events of national concern, the advantage being that they are more flexible, not needing to follow the requirements of the Inquiries Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Caird |first1=Jack Simson |title=Public Inquiries: non-statutory commissions of inquiry |url=https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN02599 |website=www.parliament.uk |accessdate=17 July 2018 |date=July 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A statutory inquiry is usually chaired by a well-known and well-respected member of the [[upper echelons]] of [[British society]], such as a judge, [[lord]], professor or senior civil servant. Inquiries are often informally named after the chair of the inquiry, or the event that is the subject of the inquiry.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5028">'''Robert Owen Menaker''' was an [[United States|American]] citizen who allegedly worked for [[NKVD|Soviet intelligence]] during [[World War II]].

==Biography==
Menaker was the son of a [[Russian Jewish]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/books/2013/12/10/book-review-mistake-daniel-menaker/xwgxTHjKpizJmTwHkUXgjN/story.html Boston Globe: "‘My Mistake’ by Daniel Menaker" by Eugenia Williamson] December 10, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; [[immigrant]] who was imprisoned for revolutionary activity in [[Russia]].  Menaker's family were noted radicals and one of Menaker's nieces, Ellen, was married to [[Victor Perlo]], head of the [[Perlo group]]. He is named for [[utopian socialist]] [[Robert Owen]].

Menaker was identified by [[Arlington Hall]] cryptographers in sixteen [[Venona]] messages.  Menaker assisted [[Floyd Miller]]'s infiltration of the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]]. Several Venona messages are related to Menaker's employer, [[Michael Burd]], for whom Menaker worked at the Midland Export Corporation of [[New York City]].  In 1944 and 1945,  Menaker traveled to [[Chile]] to represent Midland Export.  While in Chile he met the Chilean diplomat  [[Christian Casanova Subercaseaux]].  Burd and Subercaseaux were also both Soviet intelligence agents.

After returning from his 1944 Chile trip, Burd complained to the New York [[KGB]] office that Menaker alienated several  companies they did business with. KGB Officer [[Pavel Ivanovich Fedosimov]] reported to [[Moscow]] that "allowances should be made'' working with Menaker since he had not been thoroughly trained or screened prior to assignment.

In a later Venona transcript, the KGB speculates about the possibility that [[Laurence Duggan]], another source who had recently resigned from the [[U.S. State Department]], might go to Chile in place of Menaker or do some unspecified work with him.  A cable from October references work with [[Joseph Katz]], owner of the Tempus Import Company in [[Manhattan]], and one of the KGB's most active agents.  The decrypt requests instructions regarding Menaker's salary, and noted someone would be paying him thirty thousand dollars but that he might not receive it for a year.  Menaker, like his friend Floyd Miller, "apparently cooperated with the [[FBI]] to some extent in the 1950s....His son wrote of the frequent presence in the household in the 1950s of a friendly FBI agent, but his father never spoke about precisely what he did in Mexico, or what he told the FBI."&lt;ref&gt;Haynes and Klehr, Verona: Decoding Soviet Espionage in America.

He is the father of author [[Daniel Menaker]], and grandfather to [[Chapo Trap House]] host Will Menaker.&lt;ref&gt;Nostalgia Trap, Episode 32: Will Menaker https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btwCZOTD3as&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Saʿada''' (singular '''Saʿdawi''') and '''Murabtin''' (singular '''Murabit''') form a twofold social  division within the [[Bedouin]]s of [[Matrouh Governorate|western Egypt]] and [[Cyrenaica|eastern Libya]].

In modern times, the term ''Murabit'' contrasts with ''Saʿdawi'' and marks a division of social status among the Bedouin component of the population of this region, where the ''Murabtin'' are of lower status.
The existence of such a division  is a sensitive issue, and its continued observation in [[Matrouh Governorate|Matruh]] is discouraged by the Egyptian government. Likewise, categorization of the Murabtin as either [[Arab]] [[Bedouins]] or [[Arab-Berber]] or [[Arabized Berber]]  may be subject to disagreement.

The etymology of ''murābiṭ'' is unclear. It is interpreted as "the tied" (c.f. [[marabout]]), but it is also derived from ''[[ribat|ribaṭ]]'', the term for a border fortress.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="782">The '''Talodi''' are a sub-ethnic group of the [[Nuba peoples]] in the [[Nuba Mountains]] of [[South Kordofan|South Kordofan state]], in southern [[Sudan]].  They likely number more than 1,000 people.

The area's city and district, [[Talodi]], are named for them.

==Language==
The Talodi people speak [[Talodi language|Talodi]] in the [[Talodi–Heiban languages]] group. They are in the [[Kordofanian languages]] grouping of the Nuba Mountains, which is a branch of the major [[Niger–Congo language]] family.

"Tapu" was translated for [[James Cook]] as "consecrated, inviolable, forbidden, unclean or cursed" {{harv|Cook|King|1821}}; also said in some English sources as being from [[Tongan language|Tongan]] (Polynesian language of the island of Tonga) ta-bu "sacred," from ta "mark" + bu "especially." But this may be folk etymology. (See [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=taboo&amp;searchmode=none Online Etymology Dictionary: Taboo])

&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Polynesia]]n traditional concept denoting something holy or sacred, with "[[spirituality|spiritual]] restriction" or "implied prohibition"; it involves [[Moral|rules]] and prohibitions. The [[English language|English]] word ''[[taboo]]'' derives from this later meaning and dates from Captain [[James Cook]]'s visit to [[Tonga]] in 1777. 

The concept exists in many societies, including traditional [[Fiji]]an, [[Māori culture|Māori]], [[Samoa Islands|Samoan]], [[Kiribati]], [[Rapanui]], [[Tahiti]]an, [[Culture of Hawaii|Hawaiian]], and [[Tonga]]n cultures, in most cases using a recognisably similar word, though the [[Rotuman language|Rotuman]] term for this concept is "ha'a".

==In Māori tradition==
In Māori and Tongan tradition, something that is tapu is considered inviolable or sacrosanct. Things or places which are tapu must be left alone, and may not be approached or interfered with. In some cases, they should not even be spoken of. 

In Māori society the concept was often used by ''[[tohunga]]'' ([[priest]]s) to protect resources from [[over-exploitation]], by declaring a fishery or other resource as tapu (see [[rāhui]]).

There are two kinds of tapu, the private (relating to individuals) and the public tapu (relating to communities). A person, object, or  place that is tapu, may not be touched by human contact, in some cases, not even approached. A person, object, or place could be made sacred by tapu for a certain time.

In pre-contact society, tapu was one of the strongest forces in Māori life. A violation of tapu could have dire consequences, including the death of the offender through sickness or at the hands of someone affected by the offence. In earlier times food cooked for a person of high rank was tapu, and could not be eaten by an inferior. A chief's house was tapu, and even the chief could not eat food in the interior of his house. Not only were the houses of people of high rank perceived to be tapu, but also their possessions including their clothing. Burial grounds and places of death were always tapu, and these areas were often surrounded by a protective fence. 

In at least one case, a chief declared a whole settlement - [[Auckland]], a newly founded European settler town - as tapu, to clarify to other tribes that he considered it as under his protection.&lt;ref name="Essay Vincent"&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Malley|first1=Vincent|title=‘The great war for NZ broke out less than 50 km from Queen St’: Vincent O’Malley on the Waikato War and the making of Auckland (|url=http://thespinoff.co.nz/society/06-12-2016/the-great-war-for-nz-broke-out-less-than-50-km-from-queen-st-vincent-omalley-on-the-waikato-war-and-the-making-of-auckland/|website=Spinoff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, tapu is still observed in matters relating to sickness, death, and burial:
* ''[[Tangihanga]]'' or funeral rites may take two or three days. The deceased lies in state, usually in an open [[coffin]] flanked by female relatives dressed in black, their heads sometimes wreathed in [[Macropiper excelsum|kawakawa]] leaves, who take few and short breaks. During the day, visitors come, sometimes from great distances despite only a distant relationship, to address the deceased. They may speak frankly of his or her faults as well as virtues, but singing and joking are also appropriate. Free expression of grief by both men and women is encouraged. Traditional beliefs may be invoked, and the deceased told to return to the ancestral homeland, [[Hawaiki]], by way of ''te rerenga wairua'', the spirits' journey. The close kin or ''kiri mate'' ("dead skin") may not speak. On the last night, the ''pō whakamutunga'' (night of ending), the mourners hold a vigil and at sunrise the coffin is closed, before a church or ''[[marae]]'' funeral service and/or graveside interment ceremony, invariably Christian.  It is traditional for mourners to wash their hands in water and sprinkle some on their heads before leaving a cemetery.  After the burial rites are completed, a feast is traditionally served. Mourners are expected to provide ''[[Koha (custom)|koha]]'' or gifts towards the meal. After the burial, the home of the deceased and the place they died are ritually cleansed with [[karakia]] (prayers or incantations) and desanctified with food and drink, in a ceremony called ''takahi whare'', trampling the house. That night, the ''pō whakangahau'' (night of entertainment) is a night of relaxation and rest. The widow or widower is not left alone for several nights following.
* During the following year, the kinfolk of a prominent deceased person will visit other ''marae'', "bringing the death" (''kawe mate'') to them. They carry pictures of the person on to the marae.
* Unveilings of headstones (''hura kōwhatu'') are usually held about a year after a death, often on a public holiday to accommodate visitors who could not get to the ''tangihanga''. The dead are remembered and more grief expressed.
* A Rangatira (chief) or Toa (warrior), while having his [[Tā moko]] (facial tattoo) done, is considered Tapu while the tattooist is carving it, and not allowed to feed himself or touch or even look at his own reflection.
* Manuhiri/manuwhiri guests or visitors at a Marae are considered tapu until food has touched or passed through their mouths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aut.ac.nz/being-a-student/current-postgraduates/services-and-facilities/maori-student-support/spaces-for-maori/marae-protocol "Marae protocol"], AUT University&lt;/ref&gt;

Tapu is also still observed at the site of [[cetacean stranding|whale strandings]]. Whales are regarded as spiritual treasures as being descendants of the ocean god, [[Tangaroa]], and are as such held in very high respect. Sites of whale strandings and any whale carcasses from strandings are treated as sacred ground.&lt;ref&gt;Te Karaka, "[http://ngaitahu.iwi.nz/our_stories/science-strandings/ The science of strandings]', Te Rūnanga o [[Ngāi Tahu]], 21 December 2014. Retrieved 12 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Noa===
''Noa'', on the other hand, lifts the ''tapu'' from the person or the object. ''Noa'' is similar to a blessing. Tapu and noa remain part of Māori culture today, although persons today are not subject to the same tapu as that of previous times. A new house today, for example, may have a ''noa'' ceremony to remove the ''tapu'', in order to make the home safe before the family moves in.

'''The Feminists''', also known as '''Feminists—A Political Organization to Annihilate Sex Roles''',&lt;ref name="FemaleEunuch-p295"&gt;[[Germaine Greer|Greer, Germaine]] (1970). ''[[The Female Eunuch]]''. New York: McGraw-Hill, p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Second-wave feminism|second-wave]] [[radical feminism|radical feminist]] group active in [[New York City]] from 1968 to 1973.

==History==
The group was founded in 1968 as a split from the New York City chapter of [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW) by members who felt NOW was not radical enough. It was originally called the '''{{proper name|October 17th Movement}}''' after the date that it was founded, but soon changed its name to The Feminists.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ellen Willis|Willis, Ellen]] (1992). ''No More Nice Girls: Countercultural Essays''. Wesleyan University Press, p.&amp;nbsp;124. {{ISBN|0-8195-5250-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ti-Grace Atkinson]] was the group's central figure and informal leader until she left the group in 1971;&lt;ref&gt;Willis, p. 140: "When the group decided that no member could talk to the media unless chosen by lot, Atkinson quit."&lt;/ref&gt; other prominent members included  [[Anne Koedt]] (who left in 1969 to co-found [[New York Radical Feminists]]), [[Sheila Michaels]], Barbara Mehrhof, Pamela Kearon, and Sheila Cronan.

The Feminists' best-known action may have been in September 1969, when members picketed the New York City Marriage License Bureau, distributing pamphlets protesting the marriage contract:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"All the discriminatory practices against women are patterned and rationalized by this slavery-like practice. We can't destroy the inequities between men and women until we destroy marriage."&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Robin, ed., ''Sisterhood Is Powerful: An Anthology of Writings From the Women's Liberation Movement'' (N.Y.: Random House, 1st ed. 1970), p. 537.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Views==
According to [[Germaine Greer]] in ''[[The Female Eunuch]]'' (1970), The Feminists promoted not having leaders in society, "characterized men as the enemy," described "Love" as "the response of the victim to the rapist", and believed that "the proprietary relationship of marriage" and uterine pregnancy would "no longer prevail."&lt;ref name="FemaleEunuch-p295" /&gt;

The Feminists held that women were oppressed by their internalization of [[patriarchal]] [[sex roles]], and hence suffered from a kind of [[false consciousness]]. To liberate themselves from such oppressive roles, The Feminists held that the feminist movement must be entirely autonomous from men and eventually came to hold that women should be free of men in their personal lives as well. The group was strongly opposed to the [[sexual revolution]], holding that it was simply a way for men to get easier access to women's bodies. [[Ti-Grace Atkinson]] was one of the first radical feminists to be specifically critical of pornography.

They at first advocated that women practice [[celibacy]], and later came to advocate [[political lesbianism]]. The separatist ideas of The Feminists were reflected in their membership quota, restricting women who lived with men to one-third of its members, and excluding married women entirely in 1971. After Atkinson's departure, The Feminists moved in the direction of advocating [[matriarchy]] and developing a "woman's religion", ideas that later came to be known as [[cultural feminism]].

Although The Feminists disbanded in 1973, they played an important role in the development of cultural feminism, [[separatist feminism]], and [[Anti-pornography movement#Feminist objections|anti-pornography feminism]] (Barbara Mehrhof later became an organizer for [[Women Against Pornography]]), tendencies that were predominant in radical feminism by the late 1970s.

Unhealthy, or traumatic, bonding occurs between people in an abusive relationship. The bond is stronger for people who have grown up in abusive households because it seems to them to be a normal part of relationships.&lt;ref name="A&amp;R" /&gt;

Initially, the abuser is inconsistent in approach, developing it into an intensity perhaps not matched in other relationships of the victim. It is claimed the longer a relationship continues, the more difficult it is for people to leave the abusers with whom they have bonded.&lt;ref name="A&amp;R" /&gt;

'''Tuhao''' ({{zh|c=土豪, ''tǔháo''}}) is a Chinese term referring to people of wealth. The term has several related and differing definitions throughout time.  In its original literary form, it refers to those of prominent and wealthy backgrounds. In modern use, the term has also became a popular slang used to describe the ''[[nouveau riche]]''. Pejoratively, the internet slang can be understood to carry on the meaning of "uncouth nouveau riche", "tacky" or "extravagant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cn.hujiang.com/new/p544731/|title="Tuhao" (nouveau riche) become wildly popular in China|website=Cn.hujiang.com|accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and transformation in uses==
The term 'tuhao' was originally used in [[ancient China]], dating back to the [[Northern and Southern Dynasties]] around 1,500 years ago.  The term originally referred to those of prominent origin, especially people of influential and wealthy backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cidian.xpcha.com/1fc66ebz44e.html|title=土豪|quote=(1). 地方上有钱有势的家族或个人。《宋书·殷琰传》：" 叔宝 者， 杜坦 之子，既土豪乡望，内外诸军事并专之。"《南史·韦鼎传》："州中有土豪，外修边幅，而内行不轨。" 清 顾炎武 《田功论》："募土豪之忠义者，官为给助，随便开垦。"}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Republic period and the [[Cultural Revolution]] from 1920 to early 1950, it was used to describe and refer to landlords or landholders who bullied those beneath them in the social class, known as the countrymen.

Before August 2013, 'Tuhao' was a popular internet slang used to describe irrational and over-consumed online game players, who were also called "RMB warriors" as they use [[renminbi]] to purchase in-game items and suppress regular players who did not have the ability to purchase as many items. They won by their purchasing power, rather than their online game techniques or tactics. Its usage has now extended to daily life. People who purchase a large amount of figures, models and luxury goods are also given the nickname 'Tuhao'.

The word 'Tuhao' has gone viral recently since its first appearance as a joke on the Chinese social platform Weibo in 2013: A young man asks a Buddhist monk, 'I'm wealthy, but unhappy. What should I do?' The Buddhist monk says, "Define 'wealthy.' " The young man answers, 'I have millions in the bank and three apartments in central Beijing. Is that wealthy?' The Buddhist monk silently holds out a hand. The young man says: 'Master, are you telling me that I should be thankful and give back?' Instead of telling him to live a simple and happy life, the Buddhist monk replied 'Tuhao, let's be friends!" The joke implies that the tuhao's wealth was so substantial that it even made a Buddhist monk greedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/china/2013-12/27/content_31022102.htm|title=&lt;STRONG&gt;Tuhao&lt;/STRONG&gt; - China.org.cn|author=李珅|website=China.org.cn|accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociology of the phenomenon/use of the word 'tuhao'==
The word "tuhao" comprises two Chinese characters: one meaning "soil or earth"; the other meaning "grandeur" .

"Tuhao jin" is a word derived from "tuhao", literally meaning "tuhao gold" or "the gold of tuhao".

On September 20, 2013, Apple Inc. launched a new champagne gold iPhone 5s. The official price for the golden version of the iPhone 5s was 5,288 yuan (USD 862). But in China, the price of a golden iPhone 5s was above 8,800 yuan (USD 1,435). It had become a must-have item for many Chinese and soon sold out in China, prompting huge reactions on the Chinese internet. The media nicknamed the iPhone's gold color as "tuhao jin", denoting the lavish, garish and excessive tastes of China's emerging extravagant "tuhaos".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baike.baidu.com/view/10910944.htm#5|title=土豪我们做朋友吧_百度百科|website=Baike.baidu.com|accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase, "tuhao jin" was then widely used to make sarcastic remarks at gold-plated luxury cars, the opulent interior of a [[Chongqing]] school to, most recently, the golden exterior of the [[People's Daily]] office tower, currently under construction in Beijing. On the Chinese social network Weibo, one user mocked the building's golden exterior, exclaiming, "Wow! What a massive 'tuhao jin'..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Qin|first=Amy|url=http://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/15/yet-another-way-to-mock-chinas-new-rich/?_r=1|title=Yet Another Way to Mock China's New Rich|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact is that Chinese has always had derogatory terms for the rich and unsophisticated. "Tu" (the same tu from tuhao) was one. Tuhao is significant not because it is another such term, but because it is a parody of such terms, and the discourse of crass, status-driven consumption which underlies these. "Tuhao" indicates fusions of rustic roots with material ambition and gaudy expressions. However, in taking this to the "nth" degree, the term also evinces a new capacity for Chinese to laugh at themselves. Cultural Sociologist Michael Griffiths tells us that, "for consumers in China's higher-tier cities (who have already been around this kind of crass materialism for a couple of decades now), tuhao represents a tongue-in cheek satire of China's breakneck pursuit of material affluence in the get-rich-quick era. It also heralds a future where face-driven materialism will be less obviously paramount in consumption."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shanghaidaily.com/business/Benchmark/New-trend-luxury-buying-cloaked-in-moral-virtue/shdaily.shtml|title=New trend: luxury buying cloaked in moral virtue|website=Shanghaidaily.com|accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Related trends can be seen all over China's consumer economy today, not least in changes to the luxury sector.

==International reputation==
[[Oxford English Dictionary]] is considering adding "Tuhao" into its 2014 edition since this word has become familiar among the international society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/oxford-english-dictionary-considers-adding-tuhao-chinese-slang-term-future-edition-1477460|title=Oxford English Dictionary Considers Adding 'Tuhao', A Chinese Slang Term In Future Edition|date=20 November 2013|work=International Business Times|accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign media used "Tuhao" to describe Chinese tourists. In 2013, 70 percent of European luxury goods were purchased by Chinese people, and many paid with cash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theworldofchinese.com/2014/01/chinas-gilded-tuhao/|title=CHINA'S GILDED TUHAO|website=Theworldofchinese.com|accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the BBC has launched a programme depicting the phenomenon of "Tuhao", introducing the origin, meaning and popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-24677113|title=BBC News - #BBCtrending: Tuhao and the rise of Chinese bling|work=BBC News|accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, it was also listed as one of the top "hot words" in [[China Daily]] and is now widely used to make fun of the rich who love luxurious products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/101202279|title=China has a word for its crass new rich|website=Cnbc.com|accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, some people are worried about the negative reputation brought by the word "Tuhao" to China.

In 2014, South Korean drama, '[[Hotel King]]', made an ironic depiction of a rich Chinese man in one of its episodes, triggering a huge controversy among Chinese netizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinasmack.com/2014/videos/korean-drama-hotel-king-makes-fun-of-rich-chinese-reactions.html|title=Korean Drama 'Hotel King' Makes Fun of Rich Chinese, Reactions|work=ChinaSMACK.com|accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some argued that since the internet slang meaning behind "Tuhao" was meant to be tongue-in-cheek and humorous, it actually shows that the Chinese people have a sense of humor about themselves. Thus, it is claimed that the spread of the word "Tuhao" shows the open-minded and lighthearted side of the Chinese people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yanjingivy.wordpress.com/2013/11/28/tuhao-and-gangnam-style/|title="Tuhao" and Gangnam style|work=Yanjingivy.wordpress.com|accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tushetians (Merzbacher, 1901).jpg|thumb|Four Tushetians, 1901]]

==Subgroups==
The Tush divide themselves into two groups, the Chagma-Tush, who speak the local Georgian dialect and Tsova-Tush, also known as Bats or [[Batsbi]], who speak the [[Bats language]], a [[Nakh language]] (cousin of [[Chechen language|Chechen]] and [[Ingush language|Ingush]]). Most Bats also speak Georgian, to which there is a continuing trend of linguistic assimilation.&lt;ref name="redbook"&gt;''The Red Book of Peoples of the Russian Empire''; Bats section. Available online: http://www.eki.ee/books/redbook/bats.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Despite differences in language and culture (to a degree), both Chagma- and Tsova-Tush consider themselves to be part of the larger group of Tush, which in turn is considered a subgroup of Georgians.

==Appearance==
Anthropologically Tushetians have an Eastern Georgian type of face, with light colored eyes and hair color ranging from blonde to brown.

==Culture==
{{unsourced section|date= June 2018}}
[[Image:Keselo, Tusheti.jpg|thumb|right|Keselo, Tusheti]]
Traditionally, the Tushs are [[sheep]] [[shepherds|herders]]. Tushetian Guda cheese (Not to be confused with European [[Gouda cheese]], with which it shares neither the features nor the making technique) and high quality wool was famous and was exported to [[Europe]] and [[Russia]]. Even today sheep and cattle breeding is the leading branch of the economy of highland Tusheti. The local shepherds spend the summer months in the highland areas of Tusheti but live in the lowland villages of Zemo Alvani and Kvemo Alvani in wintertime. Their customs and traditions are similar to those of other eastern Georgian mountaineers, such as the [[Khevsurs]] and [[Pshavs]].

Like most Georgian groups, they are mainly [[Georgian Orthodox]] Christian in religion.

==Origins==
[[File:Gagarin. A Tushetian man..jpg|thumb|A Tushetian man; by Grigory Gagarin, 1840s]]
The origin of the Tush themselves is a mysterious and debatable matter, with numerous theories regarding the origin of Tsova-Tush and of the Chagma-Tush. It also is uncertain whether the two groups have a common origin or not.

Theories regarding the origin of the Tsova-Tush include  involving descent from South Caucasian Nakh in Ancient times (either a [[Nakh peoples|Nakh people]] inhabiting areas of Kakheti and Tusheti&lt;ref name="redbook"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jaimoukha, Amjad. ''The Chechens: A Handbook''. Routledge Curzon: Oxon, 2005. Page 30. "The Kakh(etians), who used to call themselves Kabatsas and their territoryKakh-Batsa, were surrounded by Nakh tribes and were themselves thought to be Tushians of Nakh extraction. The eighteenth-century historian Vakhushti asserted that the Kakh considered the Gligvs, Dzurdzuks and Kist as their ethnic kin."&lt;/ref&gt;), North Caucasian Nakh in the 16th century,&lt;ref name="redbook"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NICHOLS, Johanna, "The Origin of the Chechen and Ingush: A Study in Alpine Linguistic and Ethnic Geography", ''Anthropological Linguistics'', Vol. 46, No. 2, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;15 and 20(c) in ALLEN, W.E.D. (Ed.), ''Russian Embassies to the Georgian Kings – 1589–1605'', The Hakluyt Society, Second Series No. CXXXVIII, Cambridge University Press, 1970&lt;/ref&gt; or Old Georgian tribes who were influenced or intermixed with Nakh.&lt;ref name="redbook"/&gt;

Anthropological studies on the Tsova-Tush found them to be somewhere in between the Chechen-origin Kists and the Chagma-Tush of the region, but significantly closer to the Chagma-Tush.&lt;ref name="redbook"/&gt;

Theories regarding the origin of the Chagma Tush all include descent from Georgian tribes (possibly pagans fleeing Christianization in the 4th century CE), but variously involve influence or admixture from South Caucasian Nakh, Dagestani peoples, or none.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.batsav.com/pages/thebatsbi.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The region of Tusheti was first mentioned by its name in the 4th century BCE.&lt;ref name="redbook"/&gt;

The lands of the Tush have variously been under the rule of Caucasian Iberia, the medieval united kingdom of Georgia, the Kingdom of Kakheti (which eventually fell under heavy influence from Persia), the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union and then independent united Georgia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6722">'''Volunteer grants''' are charitable gifts given to [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit organizations]] by corporations in recognition of [[Volunteering|volunteer]] work being done by a company's [[employee]]s. This practice is widespread in the [[United States]].

Corporate giving programs created to encourage volunteerism by a corporation's employees by providing volunteer grants are called ''volunteer grant programs'' or ''Dollars for Doers'' programs.

==Types==
Two main types of corporate volunteer grants are:

'''1. Individual volunteer grants''' – These are small grants of around $250–$750 which are given to nonprofits to recognize an employee's volunteer commitment upon reaching a certain number of volunteer hours in a year (usually 10–50 hours). For example, the Sara Lee company will donate $10 to a nonprofit per every hour volunteered by an employee (minimum 20 hours, max 50 hours).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.saraleefoundation.org/funding/volunteer.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; Per employee, there is usually a minimum number of hours, a maximum number of grants and a cap on the total amount that can be awarded.

'''2. Team volunteer grants''' - These are grants of around $500–$1000 which are given to nonprofits to recognize a group of employees who collectively volunteer with an organization. For example, when a minimum of Five Kohls associates from one location volunteer for three consecutive hours, the nonprofit earns a $500 grant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kohlscorporation.com/communityrelations/Community04E.htm|title=Kohl's Cares — Associates in Action FAQs|work=kohlscorporation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Less common corporate volunteer grants include:

'''1. Annual awards for a company's top volunteer(s)''' - These can range anywhere from $1,000-$10,000 and are designed to recognize employees who go above and beyond the traditional volunteer expectations. &lt;br /&gt;
'''2. Corporate grants for employees to take time off from work''' while receiving their full benefit package to volunteer full-time with nonprofit for a certain period of time.

Philanthropic organizations offer grants for individuals to volunteer with nonprofit organizations for an extended period of time. These are sometimes called volunteer grants but are normally referred to as [[Fellow#Nonprofit organizations and government|fellowships]]. In these cases, a volunteer receives a [[stipend]] from a nonprofit to live and work within a community in need.

Companies typically state that any 501(c)(3) nonprofit or school is eligible for their corporate volunteer grant scheme; most however require a minimum number of hours served.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://doublethedonation.com/matching-grant-resources/volunteer-grant-basics/|title=Restrictions|publisher=Double the donation|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate Volunteer Grant procedures==
Requesting volunteer grants is normally the volunteer's responsibility. The process varies by company program, but frequently consists of four main components:

'''1. [[Time logging|Log hours]]''' - Normally this [[time logging]] is done through an online system on the company's intranet.&lt;br /&gt;
'''2. Submission''' - Upon reaching the required threshold for volunteer hours, the employee completes the volunteer grant request. This normally consists of completing an online or paper form that includes specific information about the nonprofit (ex. name, contact information, nonprofit [[Taxpayer Identification Number|tax ID]], etc.)&lt;br /&gt;
'''3. Notification''' - The corporation notifies the nonprofit they're the recipient of a volunteer grant pending approval.&lt;br /&gt;
'''4. Validation''' - The nonprofit completes the process by submitting verification that they're still a qualified [[501(c) organization#501(c)(3)|501(c)(3) organization]] and the employee is actually a volunteer with the organization.

==Prevalence==
In 2010, corporations donated $15 billion to [[nonprofit organizations]], which represents a 22% increase over 2008 corporate giving levels.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.givingusareports.org/products/GivingUSA_2011_ExecSummary_Print.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 40% of [[Fortune 500]] companies offer volunteer grant programs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doublethedonation.com/FAQ/OurDatabase.php|title=Have questions about Double the Donation's service? We're here to help|work=doublethedonation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many corporations contract out their volunteer grant program administration. The [[JK Group]], CyberGrants, and [[VolunteerMatch|Volunteer Match]] are three of the largest vendors for contracting out corporate [[matching gift]] and volunteer grant programs.

== Other countries ==
In the US, a taxpayer cannot deduct the value of time spent on volunteer work from taxes, not even when they do so for a qualified organization.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/publications/p526/index.html IRS Publication 526 Charitable Contributions], section "Contributions you cannot deduct"&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, a volunteer grant program affords a benefit to the non-profit organization and thereby a non-monetary incentive for the volunteer. The tax situation can differ between countries and is one of the factors that influence the presence or absence of volunteer grants in a country.

In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], an employer who lets an employee work for charity for a given amount of time can claim tax relief with regard to the wages paid for this time span.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/1/contents/enacted ICTA, 1988], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/1/section/86/enacted s. 86]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Germany]], the volunteers may receive a tax benefit for donating time (''[[:de:Zeitspende|Zeitspende]]''): in certain conditions, a small monetary amount (''[[:de:Aufwandsentschädigung|Aufwandsentschädigung]]'') per hour spent in volunteer work can be deducted from the volunteer's overall taxable income. On the other hand, some companies invest in a form of [[:de:Corporate Volunteering|corporate volunteering]] in which employees participate in specified volunteering activities, for example a ''day of caring'', on company-paid time.

In March 2015, the state of [[Wyoming]] passed new laws named Senate Files 12 and 80 (SF 12 and SF 80). These laws have the titles: "Trespassing to Collect Data" (SF12) and "Trespassing to collect data- civil cause of action" (SF 80). State Republican [[Marti Halverson]] said: "When a person trespasses to collect resource data, that person is not only trespassing - he is stealing data that is the property of the landowner."&lt;ref name=CourthouseNewsService&gt;{{cite web| author=Emma Gannon| title=Wyoming Criminalizes Citizen Science| url=http://www.courthousenews.com/2015/05/18/wyoming-criminalizes-citizen-science.htm| publisher=Courthouse News Service| date=18 May 2015| accessdate=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It might well create a unique new category of crime called "data [[trespass]]".&lt;ref name=SEJ&gt;{{cite web| title=Is Wyoming Ban on Reporting Environmental Harm Unconstitutional?| url=http://www.sej.org/publications/watchdog-tipsheet/wyoming-ban-reporting-environmental-harm-unconstitutional| publisher=Society of Environmental Journalists| date=20 May 2015| accessdate=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issues surrounding this and its history are discussed in the second episode of "The Crowd and the Cloud".&lt;ref name=Crowd&amp;Cloud&gt;{{cite web| title=The Crowd and the Cloud| url=http://crowdandcloud.org| website=The Crowd and the Cloud| accessdate=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The Crowd and the Cloud" is a four-part series broadcast during April 2017, which examines citizen science.&lt;ref name=Crowd&amp;Cloud/&gt;

==Background==

The [[Idaho]]-based environmental group [[Western Watersheds Project]] (WWP) and its volunteers routinely check rivers for contamination from cow manure.&lt;ref name=WP_WY&gt;{{cite web| author=Jeff Guo| title=Wyoming doesn’t want you to know how much cow poop is in its water| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2015/05/20/wyoming-doesnt-want-you-to-know-how-much-cow-manure-is-in-its-water| publisher=The Washington Post| date=20 May 2015| accessdate=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental groups such as WWP are concerned about the bacteria [[E. coli]] in streams - typically caused by cow manure.&lt;ref name=SEJ/&gt;

Property owners say they need protection from trespassing snoops hunting for information - about pollution, perhaps - that could be used to harass them and harm their businesses.&lt;ref name=WP_WY/&gt; Wyoming ranchers and lawmakers allege the WWP has trespassed on private land to collect water quality data to support an agenda of curtailing public lands grazing.&lt;ref name=WF_GN&gt;{{cite web| author=Gregory Nickerson| title=Data trespassing bill is aimed at public lands grazing battle| url=http://www.wyofile.com/data-trespassing-bill-is-aimed-at-public-lands-grazing-battle| publisher=WyoFile| date=19 May 2015| accessdate=4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting from June 2014, 15 Wyoming ranchers sued Jonathan Ratner and the WWP for allegedly trespassing on private land to access [[Bureau of Land Management]] parcels to collect water samples.&lt;ref name=WF_GN/&gt; The ranchers allege that the group submitted water samples to the state that show Ratner has been trespassing.&lt;ref name=E&amp;E_GW&gt;{{cite web| author=Jeremy P. Jacobs| title=High-stakes suit pits ranchers against water-sampling greens| url=http://www.eenews.net/stories/1060009116| publisher=E &amp; E Publishing LLC| date=18 November 2014| accessdate=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the claims in the lawsuit are derived from plotting the locations of Ratner's samples on a map and trying to deduce how he would have got there.&lt;ref name=E&amp;E_GW/&gt; Ratner and Western Watersheds deny every allegation in the ranchers' complaint. In most, they contend, there is an [[easement]] on the road that grants the public access to cross private property.&lt;ref name=E&amp;E_GW/&gt;

In December 2014, WWP moved to dismiss the above lawsuit that has been filed against it by five [[Fremont County, Wyoming|Fremont]] and [[Sublette County, Wyoming|Sublette]] county ranch interests.&lt;ref name=C_10&gt;{{cite web| title=Sparring begins in civil lawsuit alleging trespassing by Western Watershed Project; Defendants seek dismissal| url=http://archive.county10.com/2014/12/15/sparring-begins-in-western-watershed-civil-lawsuit-alleging-trespassing-defendants-seek-dismissal| publisher=2015 PitchEngine, Inc| date=December 2014| accessdate=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The defendants claim the ranchers: "Have utterly failed to substantiate their claims and the case should be dismissed."&lt;ref name=C_10/&gt; The motion also asked the court to dismiss the case because the ranchers' misconduct in violating water quality standards is connected to the matter in litigation, and their motives for bringing the lawsuit against WWP are improper.&lt;ref name=C_10/&gt;

In May 2015, WWP tried to persuade a judge to dismiss the property owners' lawsuit against it. A hearing on the motion was held on the in Fremont County District Court in [[Lander, Wyoming|Lander]], presided over by Judge Norman E. Young (JNY). 
The case awaited a ruling from JNY which was expected in the following weeks.&lt;ref name=WF_GN/&gt;&lt;ref name=CHNS_2&gt;{{cite web| author=Emma Gannon| title=Citizen Scientist Fights Wyoming Ranchers| url=http://www.courthousenews.com/2015/05/22/citizen-scientist-fights-wyoming-ranchers.htm| publisher=Courthouse News Service| date=22 May 2015| accessdate=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On Friday January 22, 2016 in Lander, JNY heard various legal motions in the case Frank Ranches V. Jonathan Ratner (as above).&lt;ref name=WF_Jan2016&gt;{{cite web| author=Matthew Copeland| title=Judge hears arguments in landmark data trespass case| url=http://www.wyofile.com/landmark-data-trespass-case-heard| publisher=WyoFile| date=January 2016| accessdate=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WTE_Ja16&gt;{{ cite web| author=M.

It'll be nominal and that that won't support punitive damages".&lt;ref name=WF_Jan2016/&gt; JNY also stated: "It seems to me that what the plaintiffs really, truly want and what they are truly right to say, is that they don't want Mr. Ratner on their property. That's something that can be accomplished a lot more easily than what we're about to embark upon here."&lt;ref name=WF_Jan2016/&gt; JNY also said that he would rule on the motions in the coming weeks.&lt;ref name=WF_Jan2016/&gt;

The Courthouse News Service writes that the state of Wyoming criminalized the collection of "data" on private and public land, without the consent of the landowner, as a response to the actions of environmentalists.&lt;ref name=CHNS_2/&gt;

The [[U.S. Department of Commerce]], Bureau of Economics Analysis, give statistics for 2014 showing that out of a total [[GDP]] for Wyoming of 43,800 million dollars, agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting contributed 710 million dollars, or approximately 1.6%.&lt;ref name=US_BE&gt;{{ cite web| title=Gross domestic product (GDP) by state (millions of current dollars)| url=https://www.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?reqid=70&amp;step=1&amp;isuri=1&amp;acrdn=1#reqid=70&amp;step=10&amp;isuri=1&amp;7003=200&amp;7035=-1&amp;7004=naics&amp;7005=-1&amp;7006=56000&amp;7036=-1&amp;7001=1200&amp;7002=1&amp;7090=70&amp;7007=2014&amp;7093=levels| publisher=The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis| date=2014| accessdate=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Senate Bills 12 and 80 Litigation==

'Trespassing to unlawfully collect resource data; unlawful collection of resource data' became effective on the fifth of March 2015. A first offense is punishable by a fine of up to $1,000. A second offense is punishable by no less than 10 days in jail and up to a year, and a fine of $5,000.&lt;ref name=CourthouseNewsService/&gt;

In September 2015, plaintiffs Western Watersheds, [[National Press Photographers Association]] (NPPA), [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] Inc. (NRDC), [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] Inc. (PETA), and the [[Center for Food Safety]] challenged the state of Wyoming for its data trespassing laws passed in the 2015 session.&lt;ref name=WF_DaSuit&gt;{{cite web| author=WyoFile Staff| title=Groups sue Wyoming over "data trespassing" law| url=http://www.wyofile.com/groups-sue-wyoming-data-trespass-law| publisher=WyoFile| date=30 September 2015| accessdate=4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 11th of December 2015, The State of Wyoming defended the Data Trespass Laws in a case to dismiss the September 2015 suit, as above. [[United States District Court]] Judge [[Scott Skavdahl]] (JSS) presided.&lt;ref name=WF_DB1&gt;{{cite web| author=Dustin Bleizeffer| title=State defends data trespass laws before court| url=http://www.wyofile.com/state-defends-data-trespass-laws-court| publisher=WyoFile| date=11 December 2015| accessdate=4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among JSS's queries was the expansiveness of the state's "open land" application to the laws. JSS asked why the term "open land" is spelled out in the law rather than private land. "There must be some intent behind the legislature's distinction".&lt;ref name=WF_DB1/&gt;

JSS also asked whether a person could be prosecuted for collecting data on Bureau of Land Management property without first gaining permission.&lt;ref name=WF_DB1/&gt; JSS also queried whether a person could be prosecuted if he or she took a picture of private land from [[Interstate 25]].&lt;ref name=WF_DB1/&gt;

On the 28th of December 2015, JSS issued an order rejecting the state of Wyoming’s motion to dismiss a lawsuit.&lt;ref name=WyoFile_1&gt;{{cite web| author=Dustin Bleizeffer| title=Court will hear case against data trespass laws| url=http://www.wyofile.com/court-will-hear-case-data-trespass-laws| publisher=WyoFile| date=29 December 2015| accessdate=3 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; JSS' findings included that Wyoming's "data trespass" laws may unconstitutionally criminalize activities such as photography on public lands.&lt;ref name=WyoFile_1/&gt; "At this stage, the Court finds it difficult to conceive a permissible rationale for preventing the collection of resource data on lands which the public has the right to be upon," JSSwrote, in the 38-page order about Case 2:15-cv-00169-SWS.&lt;ref name=WyoFile_1/&gt; "Nothing indicates this activity is more disruptive, destructive, or problematic than other uses."&lt;ref name=WyoFile_1/&gt;

JSS also wrote: "Having the right to access the land is not enough to remove the threat of criminal and civil liability under the trespass statutes.&lt;ref name=WyoFile_1/&gt; The trespass statutes prevent activity on lands even where the public would not be trespassing."&lt;ref name=WyoFile_1/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1325">In late 19th century Russia, a '''''zemlyachestvo''''' ({{lang-rus|землячество|p=zʲɪˈmlʲæt͡ɕɪstvə}}) was a society of men living away from their home regions. Found among students, traveling traders and migrant workers, the ''zemlyachestvo'' united those with a common geographical origin when they were far from home.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ser00|Service 2000]]. p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

The noted Russian revolutionary [[Vladimir Lenin]] joined the ''zemlyachestvo'' for his home region, [[Simbirsk]], when he was studying at the [[University of Kazan]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ser00|Service 2000]]. p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;
