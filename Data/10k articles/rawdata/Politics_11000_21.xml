The '''FARC-Government peace process (1999–2002)''' ({{lang-es|Proceso de Paz entre las FARC y el gobierno Pastrana}}), from January 7, 1999, to February 20, 2002,  was a failed [[conflict resolution|peace process]] between the [[Government of Colombia|Government]] of [[President of Colombia|President]] [[Andrés Pastrana]] and the [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia]] (FARC) guerrilla group in an effort to bring to an end the ongoing [[Colombian Armed Conflict (1960s - present)|Colombian Armed Conflict]].

==Prelude==

The FARC began their rebel activities in the early 1960s during the [[National Front (Colombia)|National Front]] years in which bipartisan hegemony controlled and held political power. In an effort to exterminate the armed guerrilla movements the Colombian government aided by the United States launched an attack to destroy the "[[Marquetalia Republic]]" a guerrilla enclave in central Colombia. After this attack the FARC guerrilla retreated to isolated or poor government presence areas and began establishing a parallel state governed by them. The guerrillas began extorting and kidnapping landowners and assaulting local agrarian banks (''Caja Agrarias'').

During the 1980s and 1990s the Colombian drug cartels had increased their power and in some cases had hired the guerrillas such as the [[FARC]] and [[ELN Colombia|ELN]] guerrillas to protect illicit cultivations from the [[Military of Colombia|government forces]]. The most powerful of the cartels; the [[Medellín Cartel|Medellín]] and [[Cali Cartel]]s had engulfed in a war with the government. The Medellín Cartel led by [[Pablo Escobar]] also became an enemy later of the FARC in a struggle to control the profitable illegal drug trafficking business. Escobar helped create right wing [[paramilitarism in Colombia|paramilitary groups]]. The FARC guerrilla used the revenues from taxing drug lords, and cultivation and production of these to finance their rebel activities.

On August 18, 1989, the Medellín Cartel assassinated the [[Colombian Liberal Party|liberal]] [[President of Colombia|presidential candidate]] [[Luis Carlos Galán]]. [[César Gaviria]] replaced him and was then elected president of Colombia. Gaviria avenged the death of Galan by dismantling the Medellín Cartel, but the gap left by this organization was quickly filled by the [[Cali Cartel]] and the FARC, which began expanding its influence and armed power in the countryside mainly.

During the government of [[Ernesto Samper]] the opposing candidate [[Andrés Pastrana]] accused President Samper of financing its campaign with money from the Cali Cartel. The political scandal known as the "[[8000 Process]]" surged and weakened the presidency and government institutions. The United States also conditioned its support for the government, focusing mainly on aiding the military forces on operations against narcotics, that would ultimately help bring down the Cali Cartel.

Without any major adversaries in the drug business other than the growing [[United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia|AUC paramilitary group]], the FARC gained control of most the drug production and trade, as well as financing its political rhetoric and influence over most of the regions in Colombia. With the weakening of the drug cartels the guerrillas became the main issue affecting Colombia. Andrés Pastrana ran for the presidential office again and as a candidate his campaign sustained negotiations with the FARC for a possible peace process.

==Peace Process==

Pastrana then appointed [[Victor G. Ricardo]] as [[High Commissioner for Peace]] and held conversations with [[Manuel Marulanda Velez]] (aka Tirofijo) top commander of the FARC on June 15, 1998. On July 9 elected president Pastrana travelled to the mountains of Colombia and personally met with rebel commanders including "Tirofijo" himself.

On October 8 both sides agreed to create a [[demilitarized zone]] in the region of [[El Caguan DMZ|El Caguan]], a jungle region in south central Colombia made up by the municipalities of [[Vista Hermosa, Meta|Vista Hermosa]], [[La Macarena, Meta|La Macarena]], [[La Uribe]] and [[Mesetas]] in [[Meta Department]], and [[San Vicente del Caguán]] in [[Caquetá Department]].

On August 7, 1998 Pastrana becomes president of Colombia for the period 1998-2002.[http://www.clarin.com/diario/1998/06/22/i-02801d.htm]

On December 14, 1998, the Pastrana administration and the FARC agreed to begin formal peace talks on January 7, 1999.

===Demands and proposals===

The FARC demanded and proposed certain issues in order to begin; the following were proposed to quell the armed conflict: vision of the conflict, negotiation criteria, preparation of the negotiation, political legitimacy, security, participation, negotiated political settlement, civilian population, recommendations to the civilian population and rules of behavior regarding the masses. The group also considered fundamental topics: democracy, functioning of the state, the public force, social and economic aspects, agrarian reform, natural resources, sovereignty, drug trafficking, [[paramilitarism in Colombia|paramilitarism]] and [[CONVIVIR]] security groups.

On the other hand, the government tried to persuade the FARC to leave the [[Colombian Army]] [[Cazadores Battalion]], stationed in the area of El Caguan, but FARC opposed. Victor  G Ricardo agreed to withdraw the Battalion without consulting military officials. The government urged the FARC to support projects to manually eradicate illegal crops.[http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/americas/02/09/colombia.peace.03/index.html]

===Formal dialogues begin===

[[File:Donald Rumsfeld Andres Pastrana Pentagon Feb 2001 010226-D-9880W-030.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The then US Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]] meeting with President [[Andrés Pastrana]].]]

As planned the formal dialogues began on January 7, 1999, in a ceremony at El Caguan with the presence of President Pastrana, but without the presence of "Tirofijo". The FARC argued that there was a possible threat to assassinate their commander "Tirofijo". FARC negotiator Joaquín Gómez acted on behalf of Tirofijo. President Pastrana said that "the absence of Manuel Marulanda Velez cannot be a reason to not continue with the instalment of the dialogue to agree on an agenda that will conduct us to peace".[http://www.ciponline.org/colombia/past1esp.htm] On January 8, "Tirofijo" showed up and insisted that there had been a possible assassination attempt.

==== Frozen dialogues ====

On January 11, guerrilla commander [[Jorge Briceño]] threatened to kidnap high-profile people if the government did not comply with FARC's demands for a prisoner exchange. Some years before, the FARC had kidnapped  a considerable number of military personnel, high-profile politicians and government officials. Pastrana replied with a threat to end the peace process if the FARC carried out the kidnappings. On January 19 the FARC froze the dialogues that the [[United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia|AUC paramilitary groups]] were resurging and demanded the government to act against these groups and its supporters within the government.

On February 6 President Pastrana extends the duration of the demilitarized zone and sets it to expire on May 7. Three days later, Pastrana and "Tirofijo" finally met publicly and set a new meeting on February 14 to resume dialogues. The FARC had purportedly frozen the peace talks because of the government's spraying of [[glyphosate]] to eradicate illegal crops as stated in the [[Plan Colombia]].[http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/americas/02/09/colombia.peace.03/index.html]

Between February 25 and March 11, three American indigenous-rights activists, Terence Freitas, Lahe'ena'e Gay, and Ingrid Washinawatok were abducted by the FARC in [[Arauca Department]] and later assassinated. The FARC admitted the assassination and apologized. The Colombian government then accused a high ranking FARC member known as [[Germán Briceño]] (brother of [[Jorge Briceño]]) of the assassination and the United States demanded the FARC to hand over the perpetrators. The FARC refused.

From April 20 to May 1, both parties met unofficially in El Caguan to discuss the paramilitary issue and the FARC's demands to expand the area of the demilitarized zone, which was due to expire on May 7, and to extend  the timeframe.

On May 2, President Pastrana travelled to the demilitarized zone and personally met with "Tirofijo" for a second time. Pastrana convinced him to begin formal peace-talks on May 6. It was agreed that the demilitarized area would remain in size, but its expiration would be postponed. Another decision was to form an International Verification Commission to observe the agreements and the FARC's actions in the area.

On May 26, [[Colombian Ministry of Defense|Colombian Minister of Defense]], [[Rodrigo Lloreda]] resigned after criticising the president's handling of the peace process. Lloreda opposed the indefinite extension of the timeline of the demilitarized area. The High Commissioner for Peace's remarks suggesting an extension of the demilitarized area for the FARC triggered a discontent in some servicemen in the Colombian military; 18 generals also tried to resign but the president only accepted Lloreda's. The head of the armed forces, Gen. Fernando Tapias, offered President Pastrana a public show of support. Pastrana then appointed [[Luis Fernando Ramírez]] as Defense Minister.[http://www.el-mundo.es/elmundo/1999/mayo/26/internacional/colombia.html]

[[Image:Raulreyesfarc.png|thumb|right|200px|'[[Raúl Reyes]]; Farc negotiator.]]

The [[Center for International Policy]] led a delegation of [[US Congress]]men to Colombia. Among the representatives was [[William Delahunt]] (D-MA) and six other members of Congress, who met with government officials and representatives of political parties, church groups, peace groups, human rights groups, US government employees stationed in Colombia and the [[United Nations]]. On June 4 the delegation of US representatives travelled to El Caguan to meet with rebel leaders. They held talks without results with guerrilla commander [[Raúl Reyes]] regarding the drug trade, [[kidnappings in Colombia|kidnappings]] and the assassination of US citizens, specially related to the three US indigenous workers.

The government then announced that the formal negotiations with the FARC would begin on July 7.  But a day before, both parties postponed the peace talks until July 19 alleging that three of FARC's negotiators could not arrive on time to the meeting, the FARC argued that they also needed more time to organize their positions regarding the International Commission, as agreed between  "Tirofijo" and President Pastrana.[http://www.elmundo.es/1999/07/19/internacional/19N0081.html]

Between 8–12 July the FARC launched an armed offensive (called by them as "armed strikes" from the {{lang-es|paro armado}}), in which the guerrilla group attacked 15 small towns and targeted infrastructure; mainly commercial banks, bridges and energy infrastructure, random kidnappings (Colloquially called in Colombian {{lang-es|pescas milagrosas}}) as well as assaulting numerous [[Colombian National Police|National Police]] small posts. The [[Military of Colombia]], with the help of the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]], counterattacked by bombing guerrilla enclaves using U.S. provided [[satellite intelligence]].

On July 15, 1999 Defense Minister [[Luis Fernando Ramírez]] and the Colombian General of the Chief of Staff [[Fernando Tapias]] requested US$500 million as aid to fund counter-narcotics and counter-insurgency warfare. The then head of the [[Office of National Drug Control Policy|US Office of National Drug Control Policy]] [[Barry McCaffrey]] called for a billion dollar as supplemental assistance for the [[war on drugs]] in South America, half of it to be assigned to Colombia.

The '''2012 United Nations Climate Change Conference''' was the 18th yearly session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the 1992 [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) and the 8th session of the Meeting of the Parties (CMP) to the 1997 [[Kyoto Protocol]] (the protocol having been developed under the UNFCCC's charter). The conference took place from Monday 26 November to Saturday 8 December 2012, at the [[Qatar National Convention Centre]] in [[Doha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Decision on the host of COP 18/CMP 8|url=http://unfccc.int/files/press/news_room/unfccc_in_the_press/application/pdf/pr20112911_cop18.pdf|publisher=[[United Nations Climate Change Secretariat]] |accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conference reached an agreement to extend the life of the Kyoto Protocol, which had been due to expire at the end of 2012, until 2020, and to reify the 2011 [[2011 United Nations Climate Change Conference#Durban Platform|Durban Platform]], meaning that a successor to the Protocol is set to be developed by 2015 and implemented by 2020. Wording adopted by the conference incorporated for the first time the concept of "loss and damage", an agreement in principle that richer nations could be financially responsible to other nations for their failure to reduce carbon emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate talks: UN forum extends Kyoto Protocol to 2020|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-20653018|publisher=BBC News |date=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Background==
[[File:COP18 Doha 2012.jpg|thumb|President of the conference [[Abdullah Bin Hamad Al-Attiyah]] (center) and Executive Secretary [[Christiana Figueres]] (left) at COP18]]
The [[United Nations Climate Change conference|United Nations Climate Change Conferences]] are annual multi-lateral meetings of governments held in different locations around the world under the sponsorship of the [[United Nations]] that serve as a forum for countries to discuss climate change matters.  The conferences seek to address the threat of [[global warming]] caused by [[greenhouse gas]] emissions like [[carbon dioxide]]. Between 2000–2011 [[carbon dioxide]] growth in the atmosphere was 20% of the total concentration growth since prehistoric level (391,57 ppm in 2011 and 369,52 ppm in 2000)&lt;ref&gt;[ftp://ftp.cmdl.noaa.gov/ccg/co2/trends/co2_annmean_mlo.txt USE OF NOAA ESRL DATA]&lt;/ref&gt;  The concentration of [[carbon dioxide]] in [[atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]] has reached 391 ppm (parts per million) {{as of|October 2012|lc=on}}&lt;ref&gt;NOAA Mauna Loa dataset (reported online at: http://co2now.org/ )&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carbon Trends"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/ | title=Trends in Carbon Dioxide | author=Tans, Pieter | publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]]/[[Earth System Research Laboratory|ESRL]] | accessdate=11 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; versus the pre-industrial concentration was 280 ppm&lt;ref&gt;Etheridge, D. M.; L. P. Steele, R. L. Langenfelds, R. J. Francey, J.-M. Barnola, V. I. Morgan (1996) "[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996JGR...101.4115E Bibcode 1996JGR...101.4115E. Natural and anthropogenic changes in atmospheric CO2 over the last 1000 years from air in Antarctic ice and firn]". [[Journal of Geophysical Research]] 101 (D2): 4115–4128. {{DOI|10.1029/95JD03410}} {{ISSN 0148-0227}}&lt;/ref&gt; which the [[consensus]] of world [[Scientific opinion on climate change|climate scientists]] agree is unsustainable.

The conferences are attended by dignitaries and sometimes heads of state from most countries and generally draw significant activity by various environmental advocacy groups.  Consequently, the conferences are generally well covered by the world media agencies. The 2012 conference is held at the Qatar National Convention Centre in Doha, and with a projected attendance of 17,000 participants it is expected to be the largest conference to have ever been held in Qatar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Largest convention to-date draws closer to Doha|url=http://www.ttgmice.com/article/largest-convention-to-date-draws-closer-to-doha/|accessdate=9 November 2012|newspaper=TTGmice|date=8 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The conference is casually called the COP18 /CMP 8 conference but these are technically different but closely related and sometimes integrated conferences.  In 2012, the UNFCCC conference serves as an umbrella for seven concurrent and interrelated meeting groups collectively called the Doha 2012 UNFCCC conference.  The main conference is also preceded by several topical pre-sessions.

==Pre-sessions to the 2012 UNFCCC conference==
# 70th meeting of the [[Clean Development Mechanism]] Executive Board (19 to 23 November)
# [[Least Developed Countries]] Preparatory Meetings (20 to 21 November)
# [[Small Island Developing States]] Preparatory Meetings (22 to 23 November)
# [[African Group]] Preparatory Meetings (22 to 23 November)
# Informal pre-sessional meeting of Parties to exchange further views on the possible recommendations on loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change(24 November)
# [[G7]] &amp; China Preparatory Meetings (24 to 25 November)

==Concurrent conferences under the umbrella of the 2012 UNFCCC conference==
The Doha 2012 United Nations Climate Change Conference is an agglomeration of multiple related conferences being conducted roughly in parallel and in a semi-integrated fashion over the two weeks that the conference is in session:
# Eighteenth session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 18)
# Eighth session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP 8)
# Thirty-seventh session of the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI 37)
# Thirty-seventh session of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and TechnologicalAdvice (SBSTA 37)
# Seventeenth session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on Further Commitments for Annex I Parties under the Kyoto Protocol (second part) (AWG-KP 17.2)
# Fifteenth session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on Long-term Cooperative Action under the Convention (second part) (AWG-LCA 15.2)
# First session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action (second part) (ADP 1.2)

==Conference focus==
The conference focused on five aspects of climate change:
* Adaptation – social and other changes that must be undertaken to successfully [[Adaptation to global warming|adapt to climate change]].  Adaptation might encompass, but is not limited to, changes in agriculture and urban planning.
* Finance – how countries will finance adaptation to and [[Mitigation of global warming|mitigation]] of climate change, whether from public or private sources.
* Mitigation – steps and actions that the countries of the world can take to mitigate the effects of climate change.
* Technology – the technologies that are needed to adapt or mitigate climate change and ways in which developed countries can support [[developing countries]] in adopting them.
* [[Loss and damage]] – first articulated at the 2012 conference and in part based on the agreement that was signed at the [[2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in [[Cancun]]. It introduces the principle that countries vulnerable to the effects of climate change may be financially compensated in future by countries that fail to curb their carbon emissions.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Harrabin,[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-20653018 "UN climate talks extend Kyoto Protocol, promise compensation"], BBC News, 8 December 2012. Retrieved 13 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conference structure==
The conference is generally a two-week conference consisting of the following activities:
*Speeches from UN bureaucrats
*Speeches from dignitaries and sometimes heads of state
*Closed working sessions by various working groups
*Open breakouts and working sessions by various working groups
*Announcements by countries on a particular position
*Announcements of agreements by UN bureaucrats

The conference will sometimes see late night (or all night) working sessions when diplomats cannot agree to the terms and conditions of agreements and sometimes staged walk-outs by some parties is not uncommon.  The last several conferences of this type have suffered from impasses in the first week and a half of talks, followed by a series of rounds of very late night discussions, sometimes followed by an extension of the conference which finally yields a modest progress agreement.

External to the conference, the conference generally attracts well organized protests, rallies and demonstrations by various environmental groups urging the participants to reach agreement on the topic of climate change policy. In recent conferences, some activist groups have given daily informal awards to countries that they see as advancing or detracting from their particular ideological position.

==Conference outcomes==
The Conference produced a package of documents collectively titled ''The Doha Climate Gateway'' over objections from Russia and other countries at the session.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Remarks by H.E. Mr. Abdullah Bin Hamad Al‐Attiyah, COP 18/CMP 8 President|url=http://unfccc.int/files/meetings/doha_nov_2012/statements/application/pdf/pres_statement_informal_stocktaking_121208_730.pdf|publisher=[[United Nations Climate Change Secretariat]] |accessdate=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The documents collectively contained:
# An eight-year extension of the Kyoto Protocol until 2020 limited in scope to only 15% of the global carbon dioxide emissions due to the lack of participation of Canada, Japan, Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, New Zealand and the United States and due to the fact that developing countries like China (the world's largest emitter), India and Brazil are not subject to any emissions reductions under the Kyoto Protocol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UN Climate Conference throws Kyoto a Lifeline|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/un-climate-conference-throws-kyoto-protocol-a-lifeline/article6135661/|work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |accessdate=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Language on loss and damage, formalized for the first time in the conference documents.
# The conference made little progress towards the funding of the [[Green Climate Fund]].&lt;ref name=BBCclimate&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate talks: UN forum extends Kyoto Protocol, settles compensation|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-20653018|publisher=[[BBC]] |accessdate=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russia, Belarus and Ukraine objected at the end of the session, as they have a right to under the session's rules. In closing the conference, the President said that he would note these objections in his final report.&lt;ref name=BBCclimate/&gt;

==Reaction to the conference outcomes==
Reaction to the conference outcomes was characterized as "modest, at best" by [[NPR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=At Doha Climate Talks, Modest Results At Best|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/12/07/166748716/at-doha-climate-talks-modest-results-at-best|publisher=[[NPR]] |accessdate=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kieren Keke]], Foreign Minister of [[Nauru]] and the representative of the [[Alliance of Small Island States]] at the conference,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/planete/article/2012/12/08/climat-le-qatar-propose-un-compromis-au-sommet-de-doha_1801861_3244.html "Climat : le Qatar arrache un accord à Doha, Moscou dénonce la méthode"], ''[[Le Monde]]'', 8 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; was quoted by the BBC as saying,

{{quotation|"We see the package before us as deeply deficient in mitigation (carbon cuts) and finance. It's likely to lock us on the trajectory to a 3, 4, 5°C rise in global temperatures, even though we agreed to keep the global average temperature rise of 1.5°C to ensure survival of all islands,"&lt;ref name=BBCclimate/&gt;}}

Others like Martin Khor of the South Center, an association of developing nations saw a more positive outcome, specifically regarding the '''Loss and Damage Mechanism''':

{{quotation|"It is a breakthrough...The term Loss and Damage is in the text&amp;nbsp;— this is a huge step in principle. Next comes the fight for cash."&lt;ref name=BBCclimate/&gt;}}

Jennifer Morgan of the [[World Resources Institute]] told [[NPR]] about the '''Loss and Damage Mechanism''' that:

{{quotation| "This basically would set up a liability structure about who is liable for climate change...And while I think that's a very important question for people to answer, I don't think the world is ready for that yet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=At Doha Climate Talks, Modest Results At Best|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/12/07/166748716/at-doha-climate-talks-modest-results-at-best|publisher=[[NPR]] |accessdate=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Regarding the path to the $100 billion in [[Green Climate Fund]] financing, Jennifer Morgan told [[NPR]] the following:

{{quotation| "there's no bridge, no pathway between now and the $100 billion number...so one of the real crunch issues here, which I think will determine whether we will get out of the building with an agreement or not, is whether developed countries are ready to at least say that they're going to match what they've been providing thus far."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=At Doha Climate Talks, Modest Results At Best|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/12/07/166748716/at-doha-climate-talks-modest-results-at-best|publisher=[[NPR]] |accessdate=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Criticisms of the conference and UNFCCC Process==
{{details|topic=Criticisms of the UNFCCC Process|United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change}}

The overall umbrella and processes of the UNFCCC and the adopted Kyoto Protocol have been criticized by some as not having achieved its stated goals of reducing the emission of [[carbon dioxide]] (the primary culprit blamed for rising global temperatures of the 21st century).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Kyoto Protocol: Hot air|url=http://www.nature.com/news/the-kyoto-protocol-hot-air-1.11882|work=Nature|accessdate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=February 2013}}  At a speech given at his alma mater, Todd Stern&amp;nbsp;— the US Climate Change envoy&amp;nbsp;— has expressed the challenges with the UNFCCC process as follows, "Climate change is not a conventional environmental issue...It implicates virtually every aspect of a state's economy, so it makes countries nervous about growth and development. This is an economic issue every bit as it is an environmental one."  He went on to explain that, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is a multilateral body concerned with climate change and can be an inefficient system for enacting international policy. Because the framework system includes over 190 countries and because negotiations are governed by consensus, small groups of countries can often block progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Voices" speaker talks climate change |url=http://thedartmouth.com/2012/08/03/news/climate|publisher=The Dartmouth|accessdate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participant statements and conference activity==

===Statement by UN climate chief Christiana Figueres===
Governments will decide how and timetable to reach an effective universal climate agreement adopted in 2015 and to enter into force from 2020. [[Christiana Figueres]], the UNFCCC executive secretary: "The necessary technology and policy tools are available to governments and societies, but time is very short&amp;nbsp;— only 36 months to reach a universal agreement before 2015. What we now need is to urgently implement the decisions that have been taken at the inter-governmental level and to further strengthen actions already under way," she said.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=545924&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=57&amp;parent_id=56 Doha conference seeks faster response to climate change] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121124232018/http://gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=545924&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=57&amp;parent_id=56 |date=24 November 2012 }} ''Gulf Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statement by New Zealand Prime Minister John Key===

The [[New Zealand]] government said it would not be signing up to a second commitment to the [[Kyoto Protocol]], a decision criticised by the [[World Wildlife Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Government-challenged-to-do-more-at-Doha-talks/tabid/1160/articleID/278085/Default.aspx|work=3 News NZ | title= Government challenged to do more at Doha talks | date=26 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prime Minister [[John Key]] said New Zealand would not lead the way on climate change, instead opting to be a "fast follower".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Rebuild-trust-in-Doha-says-WWF/tabid/1160/articleID/278053/Default.aspx|publisher=3 News NZ | title= Rebuild trust in Doha, says WWF| date=26 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statement by Philippine Envoy Naderev Sano===
The [[Philippines|Philippine Government]] called for urgent action to halt climate change, emphasizing their [[Environment of the Philippines|recent experience]] with a [[Typhoon Bopha (2012)|deadly typhoon]] and believing that countries may face more extreme weather disturbances frequently if climate change is left unchecked.
"As we vacillate and procrastinate here, we are suffering. There is massive and widespread devastation back home. Heartbreaking tragedies like this are not unique to the Philippines." said Philippine envoy Naderev Sano, who is a member of the Philippines' Climate Change Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Casey|first=Michael|title=Poor countries demand action at UN climate talks|url=https://news.yahoo.com/poor-countries-demand-action-un-climate-talks-111017014.html|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statement by Japanese Masahiko Horie===
"Only developed countries are legally bound by the Kyoto protocol and their emissions are only 26% [of global emissions]. If we continue the same, only one quarter of the world is legally bound and three quarters of countries are not bound at all."&lt;ref name=20121127guardian&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/27/doha-climate-conference-un-methane "UN: methane released from melting ice could push climate past tipping point"]. ''[[The Guardian]]'' 27 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Nations and UNEP: methane thawing from permafrost===
The [[United Nations]] gave a strong  warning on the threat to the climate from [[methane]] in the thawing [[permafrost]]. This has not yet been included in models of the future climate. Permafrost contain 1,700 gigatonnes of carbon&amp;nbsp;– twice the amount currently in [[Earth's atmosphere|the atmosphere]]. When it thaws, it could push global warming past one of the key "tipping points" that scientists believe could lead to runaway climate change. [[UNEP]] called [[IPCC]] to provide governments with the most up-to-date knowledge in the next IPCC reports next year.&lt;ref name=20121127guardian/&gt;

==Non-participant statements==

===World Bank===
[[World Bank]]  published a report in November 2012 demanding the moral responsibility to take action on behalf of future generations. 4&amp;nbsp;°C warmer world must be avoided&amp;nbsp;– we need to hold warming below 2&amp;nbsp;°C. Even with the current mitigation commitments  there is roughly a 20 percent likelihood of exceeding 4&amp;nbsp;°C by 2100.&lt;ref&gt;[http://climatechange.worldbank.org/sites/default/files/Turn_Down_the_heat_Why_a_4_degree_centrigrade_warmer_world_must_be_avoided.pdf Why a 4 degree centrigrade warmer world must be avoided] November 2012 World Bank&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Bank and the International Energy Agency warned that the world is heading for unprecedented warming&amp;nbsp;– of between 4&amp;nbsp;°C and 6&amp;nbsp;°C&amp;nbsp;– if trends are not reversed. That scale would result in droughts, floods, heatwaves and fiercer storms, decline agricultural productivity, bring plant and animal extinctions, and wide human migration.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/26/doha-2012-us-carbon-emissions Doha 2012: US claims 'enormous' efforts to cut carbon emissions]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Youth===
{{Further| Youth Climate Movement}}
The first time in history an Arab country is hosting the U.N. conference for climate change negotiations. Youth in more than 13 Arab countries, launch the Arab Youth Climate Movement, a group established to lobby the region's governments on an ongoing basis to take action against climate change: "It's basically our role as civil society to make sure that the government is doing its best to provide us with the best quality of life and it's our right as human beings to ensure a healthy future for us and generations to come."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Local-News/2012/Nov-24/196039-doha-climate-change-conference-chance-for-youth.ashx#axzz2D7LUUDEZ Doha climate change conference chance for youth] ''Daily Star'' 24 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Zealand Youth Delegation heavily criticised its own government at the start of the conference, saying New Zealand's withdrawal from a second period of commitment under the Kyoto Protocol&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Key-defends-no-to-Kyoto-Protocol/tabid/1607/articleID/276309/Default.aspx|work=3 News NZ | title= Key defends 'no' to Kyoto Protocol| date=12 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; was "embarrassing, short-sighted and irresponsible". New Zealand received two 'Fossil of the Day' awards for "actively hampering international progress".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/NZ-hampering-climate-change-talks/tabid/1160/articleID/278239/Default.aspx|work=3 News NZ | title= NZ 'hampering' climate change talks| date=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Friends of the Earth International===
"An open letter to governments and their negotiators" posted on Friends of the Earth International's website stated, "To really address climate change UNFCCC-COP18 should decide to leave under the soil more than 2/3 of the fossil reserves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McKibben|first=Bill|title=An open letter to governments and their negotiators|url=http://www.foei.org/en/what-we-do/climate-and-energy/latest-news/an-open-letter-to-governments-and-their-negotiators|publisher=Friends of the Earth International|accessdate=9 December 2012|author2=Bassey, Nnimmo|author3=Solon, Pablo|date=28 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130109090854/http://www.foei.org/en/what-we-do/climate-and-energy/latest-news/an-open-letter-to-governments-and-their-negotiators|archive-date=9 January 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greenpeace===
Lauri Myllyvirta from [[Greenpeace Nordic]] states that the key reason we are heading for 4&amp;nbsp;°C of warming is coal burning. Massive expansion in the use of coal has caused more than two thirds of the increase in global CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions in recent years. Also the World Bank made plea for governments to avoid 4&amp;nbsp;°C Warmer World. No new coal plants were constructed in Europe after 2007, but 1,200 coal plants are now being planned elsewhere: they can be stopped.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/revealed-the-coal-industrys-plan-to-devastate/blog/43107/ Revealed: the coal industry's plan to devastate the climate] Greenpeace, 23 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The EU spent two thirds of its energy research funding on nuclear technologies in 2011. Some countries maintain direct subsidies to oil consumption and coal mining. Others are providing decisive economic benefits to nuclear, oil and gas installations by legislation socialising the costs of accidents and of decommissioning. According to Greenpeace removing these subsidies and imposing environmental taxes would increase the cost and price of old energy supplies, and make energy efficiency more profitable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/sweden/Global/sweden/klimat/dokument/2011/energy-revolution-sweden.pdf Sweden report] Greenpeace 12.11.2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Keepers of prosperity===
Eren Swobodan of the German group "Keepers of prosperity - Bewahrer des Wohlstandes" criticized the inaction of the German government. He called for crime charges against people who express doubts on the scientific consensus. In an open letter to non-attendees of his  group's 2012 meeting he wrote "the world can't afford another event like 2004 and 2007" and "everything has to be done to avoid it", but he also added for consideration that "they won't make it easy for us". According to Swobodan there is time until 2018, anything beyond that would be too late. 
In a national campaign published by several German newspapers the group showed heartbreaking pictures of children getting a sunburn and some more severe injuries from to the climate change-enhanced sunny weather in many parts of Germany. Although the campaign raised awareness of global warning in Germany and some German speaking parts of France and even 4 TV stations reported about it, some observers doubt whether it would convince enough politicians to "do what it takes to make it happen".

'''Actiance Inc''' (formerly known as FaceTime Communications) is an American-based [[multinational corporation]] that develops the platforms required to enable the security, management and compliance of unified communications, Web 2.0 and social media channels. Headquartered in Redwood City, California, Actiance supports all leading [[social networks]], [[unified communications]] providers and [[Instant Messaging]] platforms, including [[Facebook]], [[LinkedIn]], [[Twitter]], [[AOL]], [[Google]], [[Yahoo!]], [[Skype]], [[Microsoft]], [[IBM]] and [[Cisco]].

== History ==

=== 1997–2007 ===
Established in 1997, Actiance provided call center and CRM enablement for instant messaging, web chat and email.  Working closely with AOL, Yahoo!, MSN and Microsoft, Actiance established the industry's first CAP agreements (Certified Access Programs) providing enhanced access to the public IM networks. In 2000, Actiance was awarded "Most Innovative Use of Real-time Collaboration"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slipstick.com/emo/2000/up001027.htm Microsoft Award]&lt;/ref&gt; at the Microsoft Exchange Conference.

In 2001, the company launched its first compliance and security [[solution]] for IM networks, IM Auditor. Aimed specifically at the [[financial services]] sector that needed to comply with government regulations enabled financial services organizations the ability to leverage the power of public instant messaging networks from AOL, Microsoft and Yahoo! for time-sensitive communications, while ensuring administrative controls are in place to comply with government regulations.

By 2003, over 50% of the top 100 financial services firms worldwide that needed to comply with [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] and [[National Association of Securities Dealers|NASD]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finextra.com/news/fullstory.aspx?newsitemid=9910 FaceTime to provide regulatory compliance for Instant Bloomberg]&lt;/ref&gt; record retention and supervisory requirements were using IM Auditor,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finextra.com/news/fullstory.aspx?newsitemid=10016 Finextra]&lt;/ref&gt; whilst others were still questioning whether IM had a place in business networks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.windowsecurity.com/articles/instant-messaging-business-networks.html Windows Security]&lt;/ref&gt;

Actiance introduced the first network appliance to control the use of IM in the enterprise in 2004. Capable of preventing unauthorized IM connections and stopping [[peer-to-peer]] (P2P) filesharing on sites such as [[KaZaA]], [[Grokster]] and [[Morpheus (software)|Morpheus]], Real Time Guardian (RTG) identified and controlled access to the growing number of applications that traversed the network without the IT department’s knowledge. Actiance continued to add features to RTG including support for unified communication platforms such as [[Microsoft Office Communications Server]] and [[IBM Lotus Sametime]] and in 2005 in response to the growing threat from worms and spyware traversing IM networks a zero day defence system was added.

=== 2008 - present ===
In 2008, Actiance added new capabilities to RTG’s successor, Unified Security Gateway (USG), providing IT managers with management, security and control over 140 social networking sites, 20,000 individual Facebook widgets and more than 400 Web and real-time applications. Making USG the first secure Web gateway to combine content monitoring, management and security of Web 2.0 applications, such as social networks, instant messaging and Unified Communications, with URL filtering, malware and Web antivirus protection.

2010 saw another first for Actiance when it launched Vantage, IMAuditor’s successor, which included stringent security and compliance controls for Skype &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ostermanresearch.com/blog/2010/03/imauditor-becomes-vantage.html Osterman Research]&lt;/ref&gt;  in the enterprise. Vantage provides granular security, policy controls and compliance features for real time and unified communications (UC)&amp;nbsp;– providing management for the widest variety of UC and real time communications platforms; including Microsoft Office Communications Server and IBM Lotus Sametime, public instant messaging platforms such as Windows Live and Skype, web conferencing and industry focused networks like Reuters, Bloomberg and YellowJacket. Later that same year it include support for [[Microsoft Lync Server]].

Also in 2010, Actiance launched Socialite Enable, a security, management and compliance solution for enterprises using social networks. Socialite provides granular control of applications such as Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter, and allows organisations to comply with regulatory compliance demanded by organizations such as the [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority]] (FINRA) and the [[Financial Services Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationweek.com/thebrainyard/news/identity_management/230500039 Information Week]&lt;/ref&gt; Available as both a software-as-a-service deployment (SaaS) or as an on-premises installation as a module of USG, Socialite Enable allows for organizations to control social media features and communications for users both on the corporate network and situated remotely.

In January 2011, FaceTime Communications announced that it had changed its name to Actiance following the purchase of the [[FaceTime]] brand by Apple.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scmagazineuk.com/facetime-communications-confirms-its-change-of-name-to-actiance/article/561413/|title=FaceTime Communications confirms its change of name to Actiance|date=2011-01-25|work=SC Media UK|access-date=2018-06-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, Actiance announced Socialite Engage, a new platform that allows distributed teams to share content, engage with clients and prospects, and analyze the impact of the content on social media sites. Designed specifically to enable investment and insurance professionals to distribute pre-approved content, Socialite Engage enables any organization to manage social media in a secure and compliant environment, while allowing users to see at a glance which content had the most impact. It also leverages third party data sources, such as internal systems and data feeds, highlights channels that are the most effective and identifies potential sales leads.

'''Agbogbloshie''' is a nickname of a commercial district on the Korle Lagoon of the Odaw River, near the center of [[Accra]], [[Ghana]]'s capital city.  Near the slum called "Old Fadama", the Agbogbloshie site became known as a destination for locally generated automobile and electronic scrap collected from across the City of Accra.  It was alleged to be at the center of a legal and illegal exportation network for the [[environmental dumping]] of [[electronic waste]] (e-waste) from industrialized nations.  The [[Basel Action Network]], a small NGO based in Seattle, has referred to Agbogbloshie as a "digital dumping ground", where they allege millions of tons of e-waste are processed each year.&lt;ref name="r3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="r4"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/ghana804/video/video_index.html "Africa’s Agbogbloshie Market Is a Computer Graveyard"] NewsBreakingOnline.com. Web. 20 Feb. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  

However, repeated international studies have failed to confirm the allegations, which have been labelled an "e-waste hoax" by international reuse advocate WR3A.  The most exhaustive study of the trade in used electronics in Nigeria, funded by UNEP and Basel Convention, revealed that from 540 000 tonnes of informally processed waste electronics, 52% of the material was recovered.&lt;ref name=assessment&gt;{{cite journal|title=e-Waste Country Assessment Nigeria|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewasteguide.info%2Ffiles%2FOgungbuyi_2012_BCCC-Empa.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to statistics from the World Bank, in large cities like Accra and Lagos the majority of households have owned televisions and computers for decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Development Indicators: The information society|url=http://wdi.worldbank.org/table/5.12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The UN Report "Where are WEEE in Africa" (2012) disclosed that the majority of used electronics found in African dumps had not in fact been recently imported as scrap, but originated from these African cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Basel Convention: Where are WEee in Africa?|url=http://www.basel.int/Portals/4/Basel%20Convention/docs/pub/WhereAreWeeInAfrica_ExecSummary_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Agbogbloshie is situated on the banks of the Korle Lagoon, northwest of Accra's Central Business District.&lt;ref name=r1&gt;{{cite web|last=Safo |first=Amos |title=End of the Road for 'Sodom and Gomorrah' Squatters. |url=http://www.newsfromafrica.org/newsfromafrica/articles/art_827.html |publisher=News From Africa |accessdate=15 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718110241/http://www.newsfromafrica.org/newsfromafrica/articles/art_827.html |archivedate=18 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=r2&gt;{{cite web|last=Afenah|first=Afia|title=(Re)claiming Citizenship Rights in Accra, Ghana.|url=http://base.d-p-h.info/es/fiches/dph/fiche-dph-8430.html|publisher=DPH.

The [[Basel Convention]] prevents the transfrontier shipment of hazardous waste from developed to less developed countries.   However, the Convention specifically allows export for reuse and repair under Annex Ix, B1110.  While numerous international press reports have made reference to allegations that the majority of exports to Ghana are dumped, research by the US International Trade Commission found little evidence of unprocessed e-waste being shipped to Africa from the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Used Electronic Products: An Examination of U.S. Exports|url=http://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/pub4379.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; a finding corroborated by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]], MIT, Memorial University, Arizona State University, and other research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Multiple Studies Show Used Electronics Exports To Third World Mostly Good|url=http://hardware.slashdot.org/story/13/05/27/2245231/multiple-studies-show-used-electronics-exports-to-third-world-mostly-good}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2013, the original source of the allegation blaming foreign dumping for the material found in Agbogbloshie recanted, or rather stated it had never made the claim that 80% of US e-waste is exported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Basel Action Network Explains the 80%, or 90%, 75% or 50% "Data"|url=http://retroworks.blogspot.com/2013/05/basel-action-network-explains-80-or.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether domestically generated by residents of Ghana or imported, concern remains over methods of waste processing - especially burning - which emit toxic chemicals into the air, land and water. Exposure is especially hazardous to children, as these toxins are known to inhibit the development of the reproductive system, the nervous system, and especially the brain. Concerns about human health and the environment of Agbogbloshie continue to be raised as the area remains heavily polluted.&lt;ref name="r1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="r6"&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/poisoning-the-poor-electroni/ "Poisoning the Poor – Electronic Waste in Ghana | Greenpeace International."] Inspiring Action for a Green and Peaceful Future | Greenpeace USA. 5 Aug. 2008.

[https://web.archive.org/web/20100613090853/http://www.ghanabusinessnews.com/2010/06/07/e-waste-in-ghana-%E2%80%93-how-many-children-are-dying-from-lead-poisoning/ "E-waste in Ghana – How Many Children Are Dying from Lead Poisoning?"] Ghana Business News. 7 June 2010. Web. 15 Mar. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2000s, the Ghanaian government, with new funding and loans, implemented the Korle Lagoon Ecological Restoration Project (KLERP), an [[environmental remediation]] and restoration project that will address the pollution problem by dredging the lagoon and Odaw canal to improve drainage and flooding into the ocean.

==Background==
[[File:Korle Lagoon.jpg|thumb|300px|Korle Lagoon, in Ghana's capital city [[Accra]].]]

In the 1960s, the slum area of Agbogbloshie was a wetland. As the city of Accra urbanized, a ghetto grew, referred to as Old Fadama or Ayaalolo.&lt;ref name="r3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="r4"/&gt; During the 1980s, the ghetto was a place of shelter for refugees from the [[Konkomba-Nanumba conflict|Konkomba-Nanumba war]].&lt;ref name="r4"/&gt; In the late 1990s, newly available electricity from the [[Akosombo Dam]] led to increased local demand for electric and electronic appliance consumption.  Critics claim that this caused an imbalanced shift.&lt;ref name="r3"/&gt; 

The electricity from the Akosombo dam increased demand for functional second-hand televisions and computers, these were imported from the West by Africa's Tech Sector to help ‘bridge the digital divide’. Ghanaians welcomed these donations, because these computers cost one-tenth the price of a new one. The Basel Action Network circulated a claim in 2008 that as much as 75 percent of these second-hand electronics sent to Africa could not be reused and ended up in landfills.&lt;ref name="r3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="r5"&gt;Darko, Richmond. [http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/artikel.php?ID=188950 "Electronic Waste Dumping on Ghana Still Continues."] GhanaWeb. 25 Aug. 2010. Web. 15 Mar. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The BAN allegation was slightly different from its 2002 claim of 80% waste (Exporting Harm, 2002) which became one of the most cited references in academic journals, though no documentation or peer reviewed source documentation has been made available.  [http://scalar.usc.edu/works/reassembling-rubbish/mapping-e-waste-as-a-controversy-from-statements-to-debates-1?path=e-waste-mapping-a-controversy "Mapping E-waste as a Controversy: From Statements to Debates II."]  In 2013 BAN denied ever making the claim, or ever stating any statistic for African imports.

==Economy==
The local economy of Agbogbloshie is based on an onion market serving immigrants to Accra from the greater Tamale Region (Dagbani) in the north.  Unemployed immigrants turned to scrap metal collection, including auto scrap, to supplement incomes.   Electronic scrap processing is a fairly small activity at the market. The claim that "hundreds of millions of tons of electronic waste are imported to the area each year",&lt;ref name="r4"/&gt; as reported by several news sources, is considered by most experts to be utterly ridiculous and preposterous.   

The United States is definitely not the leading exporter of e-waste to Ghana, although imports arrive from other countries such as [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Korea]], [[Switzerland]] and the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name="r6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="r5"/&gt; Multinational brands such as [[Philips]], [[Canon (company)|Canon]], [[Dell]], [[Microsoft]], [[Nokia]], [[Siemens]] and [[Sony]] are commonly found throughout the waste.&lt;ref name="r6"/&gt; According to the E-Waste Assessment Studies, "Refurbishing of EEE and the sales of used EEE is an important economic sector (e.g. Alaba market in Lagos). It is a well-organized and  a dynamic  sector that holds the potential for further industrial development. Indirectly, the sector has another important economic role, as it supplies low and middle income households with affordable ICT equipment and other EEE. In the view of the sector’s positive socio-economic performance, all policy measures aiming to improve e-waste management in Nigeria should refrain from undifferentiated banning of  second-hand imports and refurbishing activities and strive for a co-operative approach by including the market and sector associations."&lt;ref name=assessment/&gt;
 
Followers of BAN.org have alleged that Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are adding to the waste when excess electronics are donated with the intention of helping scholarly institutions.&lt;ref name="r9"&gt;"European Electronic Waste in Ghana and Nigeria." Dan Watch. 25 Feb. 2008. Web. 15 Mar. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; They claim, based on the 75%-80% orphaned waste statistic, that exporters must have found numerous loopholes to avoid legislation forbidding e-waste shipping, such as labeling broken electronics as ‘end-of-life’ or ‘second-hand-goods’, falsely identifying them as in working order.&lt;ref name="r6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="r9"/&gt; If it were true that between 50% and 75% of the electronics imported are unable to be salvaged and remain on the land, the import would be illegal.&lt;ref name="r3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="r5"/&gt;  However, the UN Studies have failed to find evidence of the allegation, and the only source of the dumping statistic has denied it.

Young men burning wires from auto harnesses and electronics have been the subject of several photojournal essays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Photos of e-waste found on Flickr {{!}} transmediale|url = http://transmediale.de/content/photos-e-waste-found-flickr|website = transmediale.de|access-date = 2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The workers, mostly young men, disassemble cars, appliances, and scrap electronics gathered in wheeled push carts from Accra neighborhoods. Revenue from the recovery of metals such as copper, aluminum and iron, produce very low wages.  Several British news outlets have made the recycling workers a cause celebre.&lt;ref name="r6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="r5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="r10"&gt;Monbiot, George. [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cif-green/2009/sep/21/global-fly-tipping-toxic-waste "From Toxic Waste to Toxic Assets, the Same People Always Get Dumped on."] Guardian.co.uk. 21 Sept. 2009. Web. 15 Mar. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Photographs of workers burning old wire on top of tires and plastic in order to melt the [[plastic]], or dismantling the waste with their bare hands and stones, have been popularized by the press.&lt;ref name="r5"/&gt; Magnets from electronics are shown used to gather the smallest of ferrous metal scraps.&lt;ref name="r3"/&gt; The remaining materials are further burned or dumped nearby.&lt;ref name="r6"/&gt;

The workers, children and adults alike, sell the [[metal]] scraps to earn a living.&lt;ref name="r5"/&gt; A half a sack of [[copper]] or [[aluminium]] will sell for about 700 [[Cedi|Ghana Cedis]], amounting to about eight to ten Ghana cedis per day (4 to 6 [[USD]]).&lt;ref name="r11"&gt;Nuvor, Francisca.

==Living conditions==
[[File:E-waste workers.jpg|thumb|300px|Agbogbloshie e-waste workers completing a burn for copper recovery.]]

The population of Agbogbloshie consists of economic [[Immigration|migrants]] from northern and rural parts of Ghana, where living standards are growing worse, causing people to move to urban settings, such as Agbogbloshie. Conditions may not be significantly better, but making a living is easier.&lt;ref name="r1"/&gt; Inhabitants of Agbogbloshie live, eat, work and relieve themselves on the land and amongst the waste.&lt;ref name="r4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="r1"/&gt; Children who are able to attend school often spend every evening and weekend processing waste searching for metals.&lt;ref name="r8"&gt;Claiborne, Ron. [http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Weekend/story?id=8215714&amp;page=1 "E-Waste in Africa, U.S. Trash Is Ghana's Problem."] ABC News. 2 Aug. 2009. Web. 20 Feb. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dwellings are wooden shacks that lack water and [[sanitation]].&lt;ref name="r2"/&gt; The area is also home to armed [[robbers]], [[prostitutes]], [[drug]] dealers and others involved in [[Black Market|underground markets]]. [[Crime]] and [[disease]] run rampant throughout Agbogbloshie, creating an almost uninhabitable environment for humans.&lt;ref name="r1"/&gt; Outsiders have nicknamed the area “[[Sodom and Gomorrah]],” after two condemned [[Biblical]] cities, due to the harsh living conditions in Agbogbloshie.&lt;ref name="r4"/&gt;

==Pollution==
[[File:Agbogbloshie q.jpg|thumb|250px|Pollution from the E-waste industry at Agbogbloshie is extensive.&lt;ref name="r6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="r7"/&gt;&lt;ref name="r10"/&gt;]]
The processing and dumping of electronic waste in Agbogbloshie is polluting the area and creating serious environmental concern. E-waste contains toxic chemicals that are emitted into the ground, water and atmosphere when the electronics are broken down, burned and processed.&lt;ref name="r6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="r7"/&gt;&lt;ref name="r10"/&gt; Poisons such as [[lead]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[arsenic]], [[dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]], [[furans]], and [[brominated flame retardants]] seep into the surrounding soil and water, thereby seriously polluting the landscape. [[Greenpeace]] lab tests have shown the water and soil from areas in Agbogbloshie revealed the area contained concentrations of chemicals  at levels a hundred times more than the allowable amount.&lt;ref name="r7"/&gt; 

Several studies have confirmed high levels of lead in soil with particular risks to workers and children. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Assessing Worker and Environmental Chemical Exposure Risks at an e-Waste Recycling and Disposal Site in Accra, Ghana|url = http://www.journalhealthpollution.org/doi/abs/10.5696/jhp.v1i1.22|journal = Journal of Health and Pollution|date = 2011-02-01|issn = 2156-9614|pages = 16–25|volume = 1|issue = 1|doi = 10.5696/jhp.v1i1.22|first = Jack|last = Caravanos|first2 = Edith|last2 = Clark|first3 = Richard|last3 = Fuller|first4 = Calah|last4 = Lambertson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental lead contamination is predominantly due to burning off the plastic covering from copper wires. PVC insulation contains approximately 3000 mg/kg lead as a stiffener, and this lead is released during the burning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Assessing Levels of Lead Contamination in Soil and Predicting Pediatric Blood Lead Levels in Tema, Ghana|url = http://www.journalhealthpollution.org/doi/abs/10.5696/2156-9614-3.5.7|journal = Journal of Health and Pollution|date = 2013-06-01|issn = 2156-9614|pages = 7–12|volume = 3|issue = 5|doi = 10.5696/2156-9614-3.5.7|first = Innocent Joy Kwame|last = Aboh|first2 = Manukure Atiemo|last2 = Sampson|first3 = Leticia Abra-Kom|last3 = Nyaab|first4 = Jack|last4 = Caravanos|first5 = Francis Gorman|last5 = Ofosu|first6 = Harriet|last6 = Kuranchie-Mensah}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lead containing glass used in computer monitors ([[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] tubes) also contributes to elevated soil lead levels. 

The Korle [[Lagoon]], on which Agbogbloshie is situated, has extremely low levels of [[dissolved oxygen]], a result of the large and uncontrolled quantities of domestic and industrial waste being emitted into the water. Studies indicate that the entrance to the lagoon is severely polluted and not suitable for primary or secondary contact, due to the large amounts of [[bacteria]] present.&lt;ref name="r11_2"&gt;Karikari, A. Y., K. A. Asante, and C. A. Biney. [http://www.ajol.info/index.php/wajae/article/viewFile/45700/29177 "Water Quality Characteristics at the Estuary of Korle Lagoon in Ghana."] 2009. Web. 15 Mar. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human health risks==
Processing electronic waste presents a serious health threat to workers at Agbogbloshie. The fumes released from the burning of the plastics and metals used in electronics are composed of highly toxic chemicals and [[carcinogens]].&lt;ref name="r6"/&gt; Workers often inhale lead, [[cadmium]], [[dioxin]]s, [[furan]]s, [[phthalates]] and brominated [[flame retardant]]s.&lt;ref name="r9"/&gt;&lt;ref name="r10"/&gt;

Exposure to these fumes is especially [[hazardous]] to children, as these toxins are known to inhibit the development of the [[reproductive system]], [[nervous system]], and the [[brain]] in particular.&lt;ref name="r6" /&gt; In similar e-waste processing areas, with conditions and demographics like those of Agbogbloshie, 80% of the children have dangerous levels of lead in their [[blood]].&lt;ref name="r10" /&gt;  Inhabitants often suffer from chronic [[nausea]], [[headaches]], [[chest]] and [[respiratory]] problems.&lt;ref name="r9"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Exploratory Health Assessment of Chemical Exposures at E-Waste Recycling and Scrapyard Facility in Ghana|url = http://www.journalhealthpollution.org/doi/abs/10.5696/2156-9614-3.4.11|journal = Journal of Health and Pollution|date = 2013-01-01|issn = 2156-9614|pages = 11–22|volume = 3|issue = 4|doi = 10.5696/2156-9614-3.4.11|first = Jack|last = Caravanos|first2 = Edith E.|last2 = Clarke|first3 = Carl S.|last3 = Osei|first4 = Yaw|last4 = Amoyaw-Osei}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

High levels of toxins have also been discovered in soil and [[food]] samples, as these chemicals stay in the [[food chain]].&lt;ref name="r6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="r9"/&gt;

==Information security==
E-waste presents a potential [[security]] threat to individuals and exporting countries. [[Hard drives]] that are not properly erased before the computer is disposed of can be reopened, exposing sensitive information. [[Credit card]] numbers, private financial data, account information and records of [[online]] transactions can be accessed by most willing individuals. Organized criminals in Ghana commonly search the drives for information to use in local [[scams]].&lt;ref name="r4"/&gt;

Government contracts have been discovered on hard drives found in Agbogbloshie. Multimillion-dollar agreements from United States security institutions such as the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] (DIA), the [[Transportation Security Administration]] and [[Homeland Security]] have all resurfaced in Agbogbloshie.&lt;ref name="r4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="r13"&gt;Doctorow, Cory. [http://boingboing.net/2009/06/25/illegal-e-waste-dump.html "Illegal E-waste Dumped in Ghana Includes Unencrypted Hard Drives Full of US Security Secrets."] Boing Boing. 25 June 2009. Web. 15 Mar. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restoration efforts==
The Ghanaian government has made an effort to restore the area through the “Korle Lagoon Ecological Restoration Project” (KLERP). In 2003, the [[OPEC Fund for International Development]], the [[Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa]], and the [[Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development]] provided a loan for this project with the expectation that the Ghanaian government [[dredge]] the lagoon and restore its surroundings.&lt;ref name="r1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="r2"/&gt; Other goals of the project include a reduction in [[flooding]], an increase in [[marine (ocean)|marine]] life, an improvement of water quality and an improvement in general sanitary conditions.&lt;ref name="r14"&gt;[http://www.adk-consortium.biz/AboutMe.aspx "Korle Lagoon Ecological Restoration Project."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706144259/http://www.adk-consortium.biz/AboutMe.aspx |date=July 6, 2011 }} ADK Consortium. Web. 15 Mar. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the invasive nature of the project, these restoration efforts have been disputed by the inhabitants of Agbogbloshie. The KLERP requires the people to leave the area, which is the only home for a majority of squatters. The Accra Metropolitan Assembly (AMA) has continually tried to evict the people, but have only been met with much resistance. The matter is still in dispute.&lt;ref name="r1"/&gt;

In 2014, the NGO [[Pure Earth]] (formally Blacksmith Institute) funded the creation of a Copper Wire Recycling Center within Agbogbloshie and helped to install several automated machines to simplify the removal of plastic coating and reduce the burning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = E-Waste Recycling - Agbogbloshie, Ghana - Pure Earth|url = http://www.pureearth.org/project/agbobloshie-e-waste/|website = Pure Earth|access-date = 2016-02-17|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts appear to be moderately successful however the burning continues.

In a U.S. [[Public company|publicly traded company]], an '''audit committee''' is an operating committee of the [[board of directors]] charged with oversight of financial reporting and disclosure.  Committee members are drawn from members of the company's board of directors, with a [[Chairman|Chairperson]] selected from among the committee members.  A qualifying (cf. paragraph "Composition" below) audit committee is required for a U.S. publicly traded company to be listed on a [[stock exchange]]. Audit committees are typically empowered to acquire the consulting resources and expertise deemed necessary to perform their responsibilities.

The role of audit committees continues to evolve as a result of the passage of the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] of 2002.  Many audit committees also have oversight of regulatory compliance and [[Enterprise risk management|risk management]] activities.

[[Not for profit]] entities may also have an audit committee.

Internationally, the '''audit committee''' is a committee of the board of directors responsible for oversight of the financial reporting process, selection of the independent auditor, and receipt of audit results both internal and external. The committee assists the board of directors fulfill its corporate governance and overseeing responsibilities in relation to an entity’s financial reporting, internal control system, risk management system and internal and external audit functions. Its role is to provide advice and recommendations to the board within the scope of its terms of reference / charter. Terms of reference and requirements for an audit committee vary by country, but may be influenced by economic and political unions capable of passing legislation. The European Union directives are applied across Europe through legislation at the country level. Although specific legal requirements may vary by country in Europe, the source of legislation on corporate governance issues is often found at the European Union level and within the non-mandatory corporate governance codes that cross national boundaries.

==Definitions==
*[[Institute of Internal Auditors]] definition: ''"The Audit committee refers to the governance body that is charged with oversight of the organization’s audit and control functions. Although these fiduciary duties are often delegated to an audit committee of the board of directors, the (...) Practice Advisory is also intended to apply to other oversight groups with equivalent authority and responsibility, such as trustees, legislative bodies, owners of an owner-managed entity,    internal control committees, or full boards of directors"'' (IIA Practice Advisory 2060-2 of 2004).
*In Nigeria, the Audit Committee is defined as a ''“Committee of Directors and the enterprises shareholders representatives whose specific responsibility is to review the annual financial statements before submission to the Board of Directors”''.
*The above definitions are focused on the private sector. A similar definition has been developed by the [[Supreme Audit Institution|government auditors]] in the [[INTOSAI]]’s Internal Control Standards: ''"A committee of the Board of Directors whose role typically focuses on aspects of financial reporting and on the entity's processes to manage business and financial risk, and for compliance with significant applicable legal, ethical, and regulatory requirements. The Audit Committee typically assists the Board with the oversight of (a) the integrity of the entity's financial statements, (b) the entity's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, (c) the independent auditors' qualifications and independence, (d) the performance of the entity's internal audit function and that of the independent auditors and (e) compensation of company executives (in absence of a remuneration committee)."''(Standard INTOSAI GOV #9100, "Internal Control Standards for the Public Sector”, annex 2){{cite web|title=INTOSAI definition|url=http://www.issai.org/media(891,1033)/Internal_Control_Standards.pdf|work=INTOSAI definition|publisher=INTOSAI|accessdate=1 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725124531/http://www.issai.org/media(891,1033)/Internal_Control_Standards.pdf|archive-date=2011-07-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}

In India, according to Section 177(1) of the [[Companies Act 2013]], the Board of Directors of every listed company and such other class or classes of companies, as may be prescribed, shall constitute an Audit Committee. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Prasad|first=Suresh|title=Audit Committee to be constituted by BOD of specified Company|url=http://www.aubsp.com/section-177-audit-committee|publisher=AUBSP|accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As per Rule 6 (Committees of the Board) of the Companies (Meetings of Board and its Powers) Rules, 2014, the Board of directors of every listed companies and the following classes of companies shall constitute an Audit Committee and a Nomination and Remuneration Committee of the Board:

All public companies having:
* Paid-up Capital ≥ ₹10 Crore;
* Turnover ≥ ₹100 Crore;
* Loans + Borrowings + Debentures + Deposits ≥ ₹50 Crore.


==Composition==
Usually, membership of the Committee is subject to the maximum number of 6 persons. 
* In the USA, a qualifying audit committee is required for listed publicly traded companies. To qualify, the committee must be composed of [[outside director|independent outside directors]] with at least one qualifying as a financial expert.
* [[European Union]], 8th [[European Directive|Directive]]&lt;ref name="2006/43/EC"&gt;{{cite web|title=European Directive  2006/43/EC of 17 May 2006|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:2006L0043:20080321:EN:PDF|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; on company law 2006/43/EC: ''“Each public-interest entity shall have an audit committee. The Member State shall determine whether audit committees are to be composed of non-executive members of the administrative body and/or members of the supervisory body of the audited entity and/or members appointed by the general meeting of shareholders of the audited entity. At least one member of the audit committee shall be independent and shall have competence in accounting and/or auditing.”''
*  [[Institute of Internal Auditors]] best practice:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sample Audit Committee Charter|url=http://www.theiia.org/guidance/standards-and-guidance/audit-committees-board-of-directors/sample-audit-committee-charter-1/?search=Audit|publisher=IIA|accessdate=6 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728101524/http://www.theiia.org/guidance/standards-and-guidance/audit-committees-board-of-directors/sample-audit-committee-charter-1/?search=Audit|archive-date=2011-07-28|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''“The audit committee will consist of at least three and no more than six members of the board of directors... Each committee member will be both independent and financially literate. At least one member shall be designated as the "financial expert," as defined by applicable legislation and regulation”''.

==Responsibilities==
Boards of Directors and their committees rely on management to run the daily operations of the business.  The Board's role is better described as oversight or monitoring, rather than execution.  Responsibilities of the audit committee typically include:&lt;ref&gt;AICPA "The Audit Committee Toolkit" New York; 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nysscpa.org/cpajournal/2004/1104/essentials/p22.htm |title=CPA Journal AC Responsibilities |publisher=Nysscpa.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
::* Overseeing the financial reporting and disclosure process.
::* Monitoring choice of accounting policies and principles.
::* Overseeing hiring, performance and independence of the external auditors.
::* Oversight of regulatory compliance, ethics, and whistleblower hotlines.
::* Monitoring the internal control process.
::* Overseeing the performance of the [[internal audit]] function.
::* Discussing [[risk management]] policies and practices with management.

The duties of an audit committee are typically described in a committee charter, often available on the entity's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dell.com/content/topics/global.aspx/corp/governance/en/audit?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=corp |title=Sample Charter |publisher=Dell.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;×

*[[European Union]]: Directive &lt;ref name="2006/43/EC" /&gt; 2006/43/EC, article 41.2: (...) the audit committee shall, inter alia: (a) Monitor the financial reporting process; (b) Monitor the effectiveness of the company's internal control, internal audit where applicable, and risk management systems; (c) Monitor the statutory audit of the annual and consolidated accounts; (d) Review and monitor the independence of the statutory auditor or audit firm, and in particular the provision of additional services to the audited entity.
*Public sector: Cf. Standard INTOSAI GOV #9100&lt;ref name=INTOSAIdefinition&gt;{{cite web|title=INTOSAI definition|url=http://www.issai.org/media(891,1033)/Internal_Control_Standards.pdf|work=INTOSAI definition|publisher=INTOSAI|accessdate=1 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725124531/http://www.issai.org/media(891,1033)/Internal_Control_Standards.pdf|archive-date=2011-07-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role in oversight of financial reporting and accounting===
Audit committees typically review [[financial statement]]s quarterly and annually in [[Public company|public companies]].  In addition, members will often discuss complex accounting estimates and judgments made by management and the implementation of new [[accountancy|accounting principles]] or regulations.  Audit committees interact regularly with senior financial management such as the [[Chief financial officer|CFO]] and [[Comptroller|Controller]] and are in a position to comment on the capabilities of these managers.  Should significant problems with accounting practices or personnel be identified or alleged, a special investigation may be directed by the audit committee, using outside [[Consultant|consulting]] resources as deemed necessary.

[[External auditor]]s are also required to report to the committee on a variety of matters, such as their views on management's selection of accounting principles, accounting adjustments arising from their [[audit]]s, any disagreement or difficulties encountered in working with management, and any identified [[fraud]] or illegal acts.&lt;ref&gt;"Audit Committee Effectiveness: What Works Best-2nd Edition." [[Institute of Internal Auditors]] and [[Price Waterhouse]]. Altamonte Springs, FLA; 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role in oversight of the external auditor===
Audit committees typically approve selection of the external [[auditor]].  The external auditor (also called a public accounting firm) reviews the entity's financial statements quarterly and issues an opinion on the accuracy of the entity's annual financial statements.  Changing an external auditor typically also requires audit committee approval.  Audit committees also help ensure the external auditor is independent, meaning no conflicts of interest exist that might interfere with the auditor's ability to issue its opinion on the financial statements.
*[[European Union]]: Directive&lt;ref name="2006/43/EC" /&gt; 2006/43/EC, article 41.3 and 41.4: ''"In a public-interest entity, the proposal of the administrative or supervisory body for the appointment of a statutory auditor or audit firm shall be based on a recommendation made by the audit committee. The statutory auditor or audit firm shall report to the audit committee on key matters arising from the statutory audit, and in particular on material weaknesses in internal control in relation to the financial reporting process."''

===Role in oversight of regulatory compliance===
Audit committees discuss litigation or regulatory compliance risks with management, generally via briefings or reports of the General Counsel, the top lawyer in the organisation.  Larger corporations may also have a Chief Compliance Officer or Ethics Officer that report incidents or risks related to the entity's [[code of conduct]].

===Role in monitoring the effectiveness of the internal control process and of the internal audit===
[[Internal control]] includes the policies and practices used to control the operations, accounting, and regulatory compliance of the entity.  Management and both the [[internal audit]]ing function and external auditors provide reporting to the audit committee regarding the effectiveness and efficiency of internal control.
*[[Institute of Internal Auditors|IIA]] Practice Advisory: Cf. PA1110-1 paragraphs 2 and 3 (where the “board” means “an organization's governing body, such as a board of directors, supervisory board, (...) any other designated body of the organization, including the audit committee to whom the chief audit executive may functionally report)
* European best practice  for the role of the Audit Committee in  overseeing internal audit: cf.&lt;ref name=ECIIAguidance /&gt;

===Role in oversight of risk management===
Organizations have a variety of functions that perform activities to understand and address risks that threaten the achievement of the organization's objectives.  The policies and practices used by the entity to identify, prioritize, and respond to the risks (or opportunities) are typically discussed with the audit committee.  Having such a discussion is required for listing on the [[New York Stock Exchange]].  Many organizations are developing their practices towards a goal of a risk-based management approach called [[Enterprise risk management]]. Audit committee involvement in non-financial risk topics varies significantly by entity. Dr. [[Ram Charan]] has argued for risk management early warning systems at the corporate board level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*European best practice  for the role of the Audit Committee in  risk management: cf.&lt;ref name=ECIIAguidance /&gt;

==Impact of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002==
The [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] of 2002 increased audit committees’ responsibilities and authority.  It raised membership requirements and committee composition to include more independent directors.  Companies were required to disclose whether or not a financial expert is on the Committee.  Further, the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] and the [[stock exchange]]s proposed new regulations and rules to strengthen audit committees.

==History==
Below are a few key milestones in the evolution of audit committees:&lt;ref name="kpmg.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kpmg.com/aci/docs/practices/ACI_JourneyGlob_WEB.pdf |title=KPMG AC Journey 2005-2006 |publisher=Kpmg.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-22 }}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*1939: The [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NYSE) first endorsed the audit committee concept.
*1972: The [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) first recommends that publicly held companies establish audit committees composed of outside (non-management) directors.
*1977: NYSE adopts a listing requirement that audit committees be composed entirely of independent directors.
*1988:  AICPA issues SAS 61 "Communication with Audit Committees" addressing communications between the external auditor, audit committee and management of SEC reporting companies.
*1999: NYSE, NASD, AMEX, SEC and AICPA finalize major rule changes based on Blue Ribbon Committee on Improving the Effectiveness of the Corporate Audit Committee.
*2002: [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] is passed in the wake of corporate scandals and includes whistleblower and financial expert disclosure requirements for audit committees.

===Interaction with the Board, and with non-executive Board Members===
*The [[European Confederation of Institutes of Internal Auditing]] (ECIIA)’s best practice:&lt;ref name=ECIIAguidance&gt;{{cite web|title=ECIIA Guidance on the 8th EU Company Law Directive|url=http://www.eciia.eu/system/files/eccia_ferma_web_1.pdf|publisher=www.eciia.eu|accessdate=12 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321211907/http://www.eciia.eu/system/files/eccia_ferma_web_1.pdf|archive-date=2012-03-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''"The work of the audit committee can only be valuable if sufficient time is allotted on the board agenda for the audit committee to present the results of its work. The audit committee should also feel that the board is taking appropriate action on its report."''
*[[European Union]] best practice: Cf. European Parliament resolution of 10 March 2009 on implementation of Directive 2006/43/EC on statutory audits of annual accounts and consolidated accounts (2008/2247(INI)): ‘’”(...)  Stresses that recent experience shows the need for frequent and high-quality interaction within audit committees and between independent directors, supervisory boards and auditors; and that non-executive board members should consider carefully the possibility of having meetings without executive board members being present.”’’

===Frequency of interaction with management===
Many audit committee chairpersons conduct interim calls with key members of management between quarterly meetings.  Key contacts may include the [[Chief executive officer|CEO]], [[Chief financial officer|CFO]], Chief Auditor, and external audit partner.  Many boards also schedule dinners prior to formal meetings that allow informal interaction with management. Some companies also require their boards to spend a certain amount of time learning their operations beyond board meeting attendance.

===Executive sessions===
These are formally scheduled private meetings between the audit committee and key members of management or the external auditor. These meetings typically are unstructured and provide the opportunity for the committee to obtain the feedback of these managers in private.  A key question audit committee members ask in such sessions is: "Is there anything you would like to bring to our attention?"

===Evaluation===
Audit committees should complete a self-evaluation annually to identify improvement opportunities.  This involves comparing the committee's performance versus its charter, any formal guidelines and rules, and against best practices.  Such a review is confidential and may or may not include evaluations of particular members.&lt;ref&gt;"Audit Committee Effectiveness: What Works Best-2nd Edition" Institute of Internal Auditors and Price Waterhouse.

*54% of committee members surveyed felt the audit committee was "very effective," while 38% indicated "somewhat effective."
*Risk management, internal control, and accounting estimates and judgments were the top priority areas for 2007.
*Most audit committees have 3-4 members and are usually chaired by persons with experience as a CFO, external auditor, or CEO.
*Audit committees meet 6-10 times per year, either face-to-face or via teleconference, with the former lasting from 1–4 hours and the latter 1–2 hours.
*Audit committee members devoted 50–150 hours to their responsibilities each year.
*The percentage of audit committees with oversight responsibility for: IT compliance (66%), business continuity (50%), and information security(45%).
*41% were "very satisfied" with the internal audit function, while 52% were "somewhat satisfied."
*Two-thirds felt the Chief Internal Audit position was for a professional internal auditor, rather than as a "stepping stone" to other roles.
*93% indicated the audit committee was "somewhat" or "much more" effective since the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] was implemented in 2002.
*58% of committee members were "somewhat satisfied" that they understood management's processes to identify and assess significant business risks.
*Only 17% of audit committees had primary responsibility for oversight of non-financial risk; the full board had this responsibility in 56% of companies.

In a 2011 study,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Document of 3/12/10 presented to the CoE Committee of Ministers|url=https://wcd.coe.int/wcd/ViewDoc.jsp?id=1684131&amp;Site=CM|publisher=Council of Europe|accessdate=11 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Council of Europe concluded that: ''“The Benchmarking results from a sample of 15 international organisations in Europe show that 11 have an audit committee (of which the name may vary from Audit Committee, Advisory Committee on Audits, Audit Advisory Board, Audit Progress Committee, Finance and Audit Committee, Independent Advisory Oversight Committee, Independent Audit Advisory Committee of Experts) and in seven, the Audit committee plays a role in the selection of the External Auditor"''.

A 2009 study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Benchmarking exercise on Financial Governance|url=http://eca.europa.eu/products/3RDCONTCONF_EUROCONTROL3|publisher=eca.europa.eu|accessdate=11 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 23 international organisations showed that 10 had an Audit Committee and 3 considered having one in future, with 8 reporting to the Governing Body level and 2 reporting to DG/Executive Director level. The sizes of all Audit Committees were between 3 and 9 members, with 5 committees having a mix of external expert members and internal members.

A '''Central Military Commission''' or '''National Defense Commission''' is an organization typical of [[socialist]] [[one-party state]]s espousing [[communism]] responsible for the ruling party's control of the nation's [[armed forces]]. In a way, its functions are similar to [[national security council]]s. 

Examples of existing CMCs can be found for example in [[China]], [[North Korea]] and [[Vietnam]].  In [[China]] and [[North Korea]] both CMCs are actually same and have equal power over the military. But in  [[Vietnam]] only the party CMC controls the armed forces.

[[China|People's Republic of China]]
* [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission of the Communist Party of China]] (party)
* [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission of the People's Republic of China]] (state counterpart)

[[North Korea|Democratic People's Republic of Korea]]
* [[Central Military Commission of the Workers' Party of Korea]] (party)
* [[National Defence Commission|National Defence Commission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea]] (state counterpart)

[[Vietnam|Socialist Republic of Vietnam]]
* [[Central Military Commission of the Communist Party of Vietnam]] (party)
* [[Council for National Defense and Security (Vietnam)]] (state counterpart)

In rare cases, CMCs also for exists for a [[one-party state]] espousing [[anti-communism]], as in the case for pre-1949 [[Republic of China (1912-49)|Republic of China]]--as the [[Kuomintang]]'s party and military organizations are modeled from the [[USSR]] under the Soviet-educated [[Chiang Ching-kuo]]
* [[National Military Council]] defunct Chinese KMT committee (disbanded in 1947 when the army was nationalized and is no longer belonged to the KMT)

'''Conceptual economy''' is a term describing the contribution of [[creativity]], [[innovation]], and [[design]] skills to economic [[competitiveness]], especially in the [[globalization|global context]].

== History and background ==

[[Alan Greenspan]], former chairman of the [[Federal Reserve Board]], recognized the role of conceptual output as early as 1997 in a speech at the [[University of Connecticut]] when he said "The growth of the conceptual component of output has brought with it accelerating demands for workers who are equipped not simply with technical know-how, but with the ability to create, analyze, and transform information and to interact effectively with others."&lt;ref&gt;[http://advance.uconn.edu/1997/971020/grnspch.htm Speech by Alan Greenspan, University of Connecticut, October 14, 1997]&lt;/ref&gt; By 2004, he had developed his views on the topic, referring to reductions in manufacturing in the United States, outsourcing to India and China, excess of supply and the global marketplace, all leading to the increasing conceptualization of economic output.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.federalreserve.gov/boardDocs/Speeches/2004/200402202/default.htm Alan Greespan, The critical role of education in the nation's economy], At the Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce 2004 Annual Meeting
February 20, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Greenspan.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, 1987-2006]]
In his book ''A Whole New Mind'', [[Daniel H. Pink]] explains how the economy is now moving from the [[information age]] to the conceptual age. He describes how [[abundance (economics)|abundance]] (over-supply), Asia ([[outsourcing]]) and [[automation]] contribute to the need for business to concentrate on cognitive or creative assets such as [[design]], [[storytelling]], [[teamwork]], [[empathy]], [[game|play]] and [[ontology|meaning]]. He bases his approach on [[cerebral hemisphere|brain functions]] explaining how qualities dependent on the left hemisphere of the brain (logic, knowledge) now need to be complemented by those associated with right-brained processes (intuition and creative thinking).

Other contributors to our understanding of the conceptual economy include [[Thomas Friedman|Tom Friedman]] who describes the opportunities of [[globalization]] in his book ''[[The World is Flat]]''. He emphasizes the importance of the internet and personal computers for communications and software sharing across the globe. This explains how American companies are able to outsource a substantial portion of their business to [[India]] and [[China]] with no disruptions for the customer.

[[Tom Kelley (author)|Tom Kelley]] is also a key player in the field, both as general manager of [[IDEO]], a highly successful design and innovation company, and the author of two widely acclaimed books: ''[[The Art of Innovation]]'', highlighting the importance of brainstorming and teamwork in product creation; and ''[[The Ten Faces of Innovation]]'', explaining the role of assets such as [[empathy]], [[storytelling]], individual experiences and stimulating work environments in fostering creative ideas.

The key steps behind the conceptual economy fall into the following categories:

== The evolving state of the economy ==
Until quite recently, our understanding of the economy was based on the premise that the way forward would depend on traditional values and qualifications such as those for [[accountants]], [[lawyers]], [[engineers]], [[mathematicians]] or [[computer programmers]]. With the new opportunities resulting from [[globalization]] and the [[internet]], the accepted forms of success are losing ground to scenarios drawing on innovative ideas. Here there is an increasing need for [[artists]], [[designers]] and creative [[authors]] to contribute not only to [[product design]] but also to business [[management]] and [[strategic planning]].

Areas deserving particular attention are related to three key developments:

===Over-supply===
For the past 15 or 20 years, the Western economies (Europe, North America) have experienced a situation of fully dependable supply of basic goods, including round-the-year abundance of agricultural [[produce]], with the result that a significant proportion of households have begun to look for more than just the basic necessities. Families now look for goods which extend beyond the basic norm such as [[organic products|organic foods]] or sophisticated [[digital television|digital television sets]], [[mobile phones]] and cars with [[four-wheel drive]], [[cruise control]] or integrated [[automotive navigation system|navigation systems]].

===Outsourcing===
Given the low costs of [[Manual labour|labour]] in developing countries such as [[China]], [[India]] and [[the Philippines]], American and European companies are now [[outsourcing]] or [[offshoring]] an ever-increasing proportion of their production, manufacturing or service tasks to foreign countries. As a result, job opportunities in the West are slowly moving away from routine tasks such as [[accounting]], [[call centre|telephone support services]], [[computer programming]] and [[electronic component]] manufacturing. The efficiency of outsourcing has also been improving as the internet continues to provide increasingly reliable and ever faster global communications links.

===Automation===
In industry too, the development of [[robotics]] and [[computer-aided manufacturing|automated manufacturing]] facilities means that opportunities for traditional jobs in industries such as [[automaker|automobile manufacturing]] and [[food processing]] are also diminishing. Ever higher levels of qualification are now required to contribute to operations that are largely computerized.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/nov2006/gb20061108_738883.htm?chan=top+news_top+news+index_global+business Outsourcing: Job Killer or Innovation Boost?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071119082031/http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/nov2006/gb20061108_738883.htm?chan=top+news_top+news+index_global+business |date=November 19, 2007 }}, Pete Engardio, ''[[Business Week]]'', 8 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Au W31CA CASIO gif-anime1.gif|right|thumb|150px|Mobile phones now offer a wide range of additional features]]

== New areas of opportunity ==
Partly a result of the above factors, a wide range of new facilities and opportunities has begun to emerge. These include:
* the development of appealing new [[electronic commerce|internet-based facilities]] for sales and services,
* [[intelligent transportation system|transportation logistics]] for better coordination of component supply and product distribution,
* customer-oriented [[travel technology|interactive travel guides]] for more efficient and often cheaper travel abroad,
* [[gadget|value-added products]] combining a number of services, often into one small unit,
* [[electronic learning|computerized courseware]] to enhance on-the-job training, and
* sophisticated [[computer-aided design|design tools]] for greater production efficiency.
Virtually every area of industry can benefit from developments of this kind both to improve the products themselves and to offer better marketing opportunities and after-sales services. As a result, these factors are seen as major contributors to increased [[productivity]] and [[economic growth]].

== Criteria for economic success ==
Drivers behind the conceptual economy, can be categorised into the following areas:&lt;ref&gt;Deborah L. Wince-Smith, The Conceptual Economy, in Competitiveness Index: Where America Stands, Council on Competitiveness, November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scholarship===
Educational institutions need to place more emphasis on creativity and the arts rather than on traditional qualifications in the areas of engineering and management. In particular, more attention needs to be devoted to basic [[literacy]], analytical and [[critical thinking]], synthesis and quantitative skills:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heartland.org/Article.cfm?artId=20156 The Literacy of America's College Students], Team of Research Analysts from the American Institutes for Research, January 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creativity and artistry===
Until now, [[information technology]] has had considerable impact on the [[economy]]. Increasingly, success will depend on how to make use of the knowledge and information that has emerged. Here qualities such as [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]], [[creativity]] and [[game|game-based approaches]] will become ever more important.

===Cultural and technical diversity===
Prosperity and competitiveness in the 21st century will depend on an understanding of diverse national cultures and how to draw on their ideas in order to assist the innovation process. Here too, there will be a need for more extensive teamwork, creativity and leading-edge thinking, all in the context of the global economy.

The '''Cool Chain Quality Indicator''' (abbreviated as "CCQI") – established by the Cool Chain Association (CCA) and [[Germanischer Lloyd]] (GL) – is an industry standard which measures reliability, quality and skills in temperature-critical logistics like food, flowers and plants, some chemicals, pharmaceuticals and human blood. It uses a [[benchmarking]] system to assess transparent and comparable quality measures.

The aim of the CCQI is to improve the consistency of [[cool chain]]s across the globe,&lt;ref name="Cool under pressure"&gt;[http://www.arabianbusiness.com/7544-cool-under-pressure] Arabian Business.com, line 21-22.&lt;/ref&gt; that includes Perishables and Temperature Sensitive Products (PTSP) carriers (airlines, road haulers), handling agents, forwarders, perishable centres, airports, warehouses (long- and short-term cold stores) and [[containerized]] and conventional ocean transport.
The CCQI has very similar requirements close to any other [[quality management system]] of the [[ISO 9000]] type. The organization that attempts the certification must identify each operation in which it handles temperature sensitive products. For each of these operations, their processes are compared against the standard’s Master Tables.
The standard is created in a manner which endorses the qualitative assessment of technical installations, processes and staff qualifications and makes it possible for a company to compare itself with competitors but also to improve its own performance&lt;ref name="Industry Certification for Cold Logistics"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsletter.coldstoredesign.com/NovPictures/CCENovember.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708174628/http://newsletter.coldstoredesign.com/NovPictures/CCENovember.htm |archivedate=2011-07-08 |df= }} Cool Chain Experts.com, line 6-8.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Master Tables for each part of the supply cold chain represent guidelines that shall make sure that the temperature sensitive product will be delivered at the right temperature starting at the field and finishing at consumption.
This standard seeks to allow operators to carry out a check for conformity with state-of-the-art practice and provides a quantitative evaluation for cool chain quality&lt;ref name="Reefer Storage"&gt;[http://www.arabiansupplychain.com/article-1356-reefer_storage/2/] Arabian Supply Chain.com, line 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Democracy Watch''', established in 1993, is a Canadian organization that advocates on [[Democratization|democratic reform]], government [[accountability]] and [[corporate responsibility]] issues. It provides information and support, and works in conjunction with, good government and corporate responsibility organizations from other countries, including especially GlobalIntegrity.org (which assesses the [[state of democracy]] and good government in various countries). Duff Conacher is a founder and was the Coordinator of Democracy Watch from September 1993 to June 2011.

While other organizations have been established in various countries since 1993 called Democracy Watch (for example, in Australia, Bangladesh, [[Liberia]], Nepal, Pakistan, [[Somaliland]], Thailand, Ukraine), these organizations are not affiliated with Democracy Watch in Canada. Democracy Watch in Canada focuses on democratic reform in Canada, while the other organizations focus on democratic reform in their countries.

{{Desalination}}

'''Desalination''' is a process that takes away mineral components from [[saline water]]. More generally, desalination refers to the removal of salts and minerals from a target substance,&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/desalination "Desalination"] (definition), ''The American Heritage Science Dictionary'', Dunder Mifflin Company, via dictionary.com. Retrieved August 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; as in [[Soil salinity control|soil desalination]], which is an issue for agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.nerds.com.cn/english/200108/03/eng20010803_76423.html "Australia Aids China In Water Management Project."] ''People's Daily Online'', 2001-08-03, via english.people.com.cn. Retrieved August 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Saline water|Saltwater]] is desalinated to produce water suitable for [[drinking water|human consumption]] or [[irrigation]]. One [[by-product]] of desalination is [[sodium chloride|salt]]. Desalination is used on many seagoing [[ship]]s and [[submarine]]s. Most of the modern interest in desalination is focused on cost-effective provision of [[fresh water]] for human use. Along with recycled [[wastewater]], it is one of the few rainfall-independent water sources.&lt;ref name=Fischetti2007&gt;{{Cite journal
 |last=Fischetti |first=Mark |date=September 2007 |title=Fresh from the Sea |journal=Scientific American|volume=297 |pmid=17784633 |issue=3 |pages=118–119|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0907-118
|bibcode=2007SciAm.297c.118F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its energy consumption, desalinating sea water is generally more costly than fresh water from rivers or [[groundwater]], [[water recycling]] and [[water conservation]]. However, these alternatives are not always available and depletion of reserves is a critical problem worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.desal.2018.01.002 |title=Performance of microbial desalination cell for salt removal and energy generation using different catholyte solutions |journal=Desalination |volume=432 |page=1 |year=2018 |last1=Ebrahimi |first1=Atieh |last2=Najafpour |first2=Ghasem D |last3=Yousefi Kebria |first3=Daryoush }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, approximately 1% of the world's population is dependent on desalinated water to meet daily needs, but the UN expects that 14% of the world's population will encounter [[water scarcity]] by 2025.&lt;ref name="gwi"/&gt;

Desalination is particularly relevant in dry countries such as [[Seawater desalination in Australia|Australia]], which traditionally have relied on collecting rainfall behind dams for water.

According to the International Desalination Association, in June 2015, 18,426 desalination plants operated worldwide, producing 86.8 million cubic meters per day, providing water for 300 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|

==Methods==
[[File:Reverse osmosis desalination plant.JPG|thumb|Reverse osmosis desalination plant in Barcelona, Spain]]
There are several methods. Each has advantages and disadvantages but all are useful.

===Vacuum distillation===
The traditional process used in these operations is [[vacuum distillation]]—essentially boiling it to leave impurities behind. In desalination, atmospheric pressure is reduced, thus lowering the required temperature needed. Liquids boil when the [[vapor pressure]] equals the ambient pressure and vapor pressure increases with temperature. Effectively, liquids boil at a lower temperature, when the ambient atmospheric pressure is less than usual atmospheric pressure. Thus, because of the reduced pressure, low-temperature "waste" heat from electrical power generation or industrial processes can be employed.

===Multi-stage flash distillation===
Water is evaporated and separated from sea water through [[multi-stage flash distillation]], which is a series of [[flash evaporation]]s.&lt;ref name=Khawaji&gt;{{cite web|last1=Khawaji|first1=Akili D.|last2=Kutubkhanah|first2=Ibrahim K.|last3=Wie|first3=Jong-Mihn|title=Advances in seawater desalination technologies|website=Desalination|pages=47–69|doi=10.1016/j.desal.2007.01.067|date=March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each subsequent flash process utilizes energy released from the condensation of the water vapor from the previous step.&lt;ref name=Khawaji /&gt;

===Multiple-effect distillation===
[[Multiple-effect distillation]] (MED) works through a series of steps called "effects".&lt;ref name=Khawaji /&gt; Incoming water is sprayed onto pipes which are then heated to generate steam. The steam is then used to heat the next batch of incoming sea water.&lt;ref name=Khawaji /&gt;  To increase efficiency, the steam used to heat the sea water can be taken from nearby power plants.&lt;ref name=Khawaji /&gt; Although this method is the most thermodynamically efficient among methods powered by heat,&lt;ref name=WarsingerEntropy&gt;{{cite web|last1=Warsinger|first1=David M.|last2=Mistry|first2= Karan H.|last3=Nayar|first3=Kishor G.|last4=Chung|first4=Hyung Won|last5=Lienhard V|first5=John H.|title=Entropy Generation of Desalination Powered by Variable Temperature Waste Heat|website=Entropy|pages=7530–7566|doi=10.3390/e17117530|date=2015|bibcode=2015Entrp..17.7530W}}&lt;/ref&gt; a few limitations exist such as a max temperature and max number of effects.&lt;ref name="Al-Shammiri"&gt;{{cite web|title=Multi-effect distillation plants: state of the art|last2=Safar|first2=M.|date=November 1999|website=Desalination|pages=45–59|doi=10.1016/S0011-9164(99)00154-X|last1=Al-Shammiri|first1=M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vapor-compression distillation===
[[Vapor-compression evaporation]] involves using either a mechanical compressor or a jet stream to compress the vapor present above the liquid.&lt;ref name=WarsingerEntropy /&gt;  The compressed vapor is then used to provide the heat needed for the evaporation of the rest of the sea water.&lt;ref name=Khawaji /&gt; Since this system only requires power, it is more cost effective if kept at a small scale.&lt;ref name=Khawaji /&gt;

===Reverse osmosis===
The leading process for desalination in terms of installed capacity and yearly growth is [[reverse osmosis|reverse osmosis (RO)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.desal.2006.12.009|title=State-of-the-art of reverse osmosis desalination|year=2007|last1=Fritzmann|first1=C|last2=Lowenberg|first2=J|last3=Wintgens|first3=T|last4=Melin|first4=T|journal=Desalination|volume=216|pages=1–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RO membrane processes use semipermeable membranes and applied  pressure (on the membrane feed side) to preferentially induce water permeation through the membrane while rejecting salts. [[Reverse osmosis plant]] membrane systems typically use less energy than thermal desalination processes.&lt;ref name=WarsingerEntropy /&gt; Desalination processes are driven by either thermal (e.g., distillation) or electrical (e.g., RO) as the primary energy types. Energy cost in desalination processes varies considerably depending on water salinity, plant size and process type. At present the cost of seawater desalination, for example, is higher than traditional water sources, but it is expected that costs will continue to decrease with technology improvements that include, but are not limited to, improved efficiency,&lt;ref name=WarsingerBatch&gt;{{cite web|last1=Warsinger|first1=David M.|last2=Tow|first2= Emily W.|last3=Nayar|first3=Kishor G.|last4=Maswadeh|first4=Laith A.|last5=Lienhard V|first5=John H.|title=Energy efficiency of batch and semi-batch (CCRO) reverse osmosis desalination|website=Water Research|pages=272–282|doi=10.1016/j.watres.2016.09.029|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; reduction in plants footprint, improvements to plant operation and optimization, more effective feed pretreatment, and lower cost energy sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Salty solutions |journal = Physics Today|date = 2015-06-01|issn = 0031-9228|pages = 66–67|volume = 68|issue = 6|doi = 10.1063/PT.3.2828|first = Gregory P.|last = Thiel|bibcode = 2015PhT....68f..66T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reverse osmosis uses a thin-film composite membrane, which comprises an ultra-thin, aromatic polyamide thin-film. This polyamide film gives the membrane its transport properties, whereas the remainder of the thin-film composite membrane provides mechanical support. The polyamide film is a dense, void-free polymer with a high surface area, allowing for its high water permeability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1073/pnas.1804708115|title=Electron tomography reveals details of the internal microstructure of desalination membranes|year=2018|last1=Culp|first1=T.E.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=115|issue=35|pages=8694–8699}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Reverse Osmosis process is not maintenance free. Various factors interfere with efficiency: ionic contamination (calcium, magnesium etc.); [[Dissolved organic carbon|DOC]]; bacteria; viruses; [[colloid]]s &amp; insoluble particulates; [[biofouling]] and [[Fouling|scaling]]. In extreme cases the RO membranes are destroyed. To mitigate damage, various pretreatment stages are introduced.  Anti-scaling inhibitors include acids and other agents like the organic polymers [[Acrylamide|Polyacrylamide]] and Polymaleic Acid, [[Phosphonates]] and [[Polyphosphate]]s. Inhibitors for fouling are [[biocide]]s (as oxidants against bacteria and viruses), like chlorine, ozone, sodium or calcium hypochlorite. At regular intervals, depending on the membrane contamination; fluctuating seawater conditions; or when prompted by monitoring processes, the membranes need to be cleaned, known as emergency or shock-flushing. Flushing is done with inhibitors in a fresh water solution and the system must go offline. This procedure is environmental risky, since contaminated water is diverted into the ocean without treatment. Sensitive [[marine habitats]] can be irreversibly damaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Membranverfahren - Grundlagen der Modul und Anlagenauslegung|last=Rautenbach|first=Melin|publisher=Springer Verlag Berlin|year=2007|isbn=9783540000716|location=Germany|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Seawater Desalination - Impacts of Brine and Chemical Discharge on the Marine Environment|last=|first=|publisher=Sabine Lattemann, Thomas Höppner|year=|isbn=9780866890625|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Freeze-thaw ===
Freeze-thaw desalination uses freezing to remove fresh water from salt water.  Salt water is sprayed during freezing conditions into a pad where an ice-pile builds up. When seasonal conditions warm, naturally desalinated melt water is recovered. This technique relies on extended periods of natural sub-freezing conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usbr.gov/research/dwpr/reportpdfs/report071.pdf |title=DEMONSTRATION OF THE NATURAL FREEZE-THAW PROCESS FOR THE DESALINATION OF WATER FROM THE DEVILS LAKE CHAIN TO PROVIDE WATER FOR THE CITY OF DEVILS LAKE |first=John E. |last=Boysen |date=August 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A different freeze-thaw method, not weather dependent and invented by [[Alexander Zarchin]], freezes seawater in a vacuum.  Under vacuum conditions the ice, desalinated, is melted and diverted for collection and the salt is collected.

===Solar evaporation===
Solar evaporation mimics the natural water cycle, in which the sun heats the sea water enough for evaporation to occur.&lt;ref name=Khawaji /&gt; After evaporation, the water vapor is condensed onto a cool surface.&lt;ref name=Khawaji /&gt;

===Electrodialysis reversal===
[[Electrodialysis]] utilizes electric potential to move the salts through pairs of charged membranes, which trap salt in alternating channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Van der Bruggen|first1=Bart|last2=Vandecasteele|first2=Carlo|title=Distillation vs. membrane filtration: overview of process evolutions in seawater desalination|website=Desalination|pages=207–218|doi=10.1016/S0011-9164(02)00259-X|date=June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Membrane distillation===
[[Membrane distillation]] uses a temperature difference across a membrane to evaporate vapor from a salty brine solution and condense pure condensate on the colder side.&lt;ref name=WarsingerFramework&gt;{{cite web|last1=Warsinger|first1=David M.|last2=Tow|first2= Emily W.|last3=Swaminathan|first3= Jaichander|last4=Lienhard V|first4=John H.|title=Theoretical framework for predicting inorganic fouling in membrane distillation and experimental validation with calcium sulfate|website=Journal of Membrane Science|pages=381–390|doi=10.1016/j.memsci.2017.01.031|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wave-powered desalination===
[[CETO]] is a [[wave power]] technology that desalinates seawater using submerged buoys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Considerations and criticism==

===Energy consumption===
Energy consumption of seawater desalination has reached as low as 3 kWh/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ijesd.org/papers/243-B20001.pdf "Energy Efficient Reverse Osmosis Desalination Process"], p. 343 Table 1, International Journal of Environmental Science and Development, Vol. 3, No. 4, August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; including pre-filtering and ancillaries, similar to the energy consumption of other fresh water supplies transported over large distances,&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, Robert C. (March 2007) [http://www.westbasin.org/files/general-pdfs/Energy--UCSB-energy-study.pdf "Analysis of the Energy Intensity of Water Supplies for West Basin Municipal Water District"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121220210850/http://www.westbasin.org/files/general-pdfs/Energy--UCSB-energy-study.pdf |date=December 20, 2012 }}, Table on p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; but much higher than local fresh water supplies that use 0.2 kWh/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; or less.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.circleofblue.org/waternews/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/EPRI-Volume-4.pdf "U.S. Electricity Consumption for Water Supply &amp; Treatment"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617040130/http://www.circleofblue.org/waternews/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/EPRI-Volume-4.pdf |date=June 17, 2013 }}, pp. 1–4 Table 1-1, Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) Water &amp; Sustainability (Volume 4), 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

A minimum energy consumption for seawater desalination of around 1 kWh/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; has been determined,&lt;ref&gt;Elimelech, Menachem (2012) [http://www.nwri-usa.org/documents/Elimelech_000.pdf "Seawater Desalination"], p. 12 ff&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/es801330u| title = Energy Issues in Desalination Processes| journal = Environmental Science &amp; Technology| volume = 42| issue = 22| page = 8193| year = 2008| last1 = Semiat | first1 = R. |bibcode = 2008EnST...42.8193S }}&lt;/ref&gt; excluding prefiltering and intake/outfall pumping. Under 2 kWh/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usbr.gov/research/AWT/reportpdfs/ADC_SWRO_DA.pdf "Optimizing Lower Energy Seawater Desalination"], p6 figure 1.2, Stephen Dundorf at the IDA World Congress November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; has been achieved with [[reverse osmosis]] membrane technology, leaving limited scope for further energy reductions.

Supplying all US domestic water by desalination would increase domestic [[Energy in the United States|energy consumption]] by around 10%, about the amount of energy used by domestic refrigerators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amtaorg.com/wp-content/uploads/7_MembraneDesalinationPowerUsagePutInPerspective.pdf "Membrane Desalination Power Usage Put In Perspective" ], American Membrane Technology Association(AMTA) April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Domestic consumption is a relatively small fraction of the total water usage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://water.usgs.gov/edu/wateruse-total.html] Total Water Use in the United States&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cogeneration===
[[Cogeneration]] is generating excess heat and electricity generation from a single process. Cogeneration can provide usable heat for desalination in an integrated, or "dual-purpose", facility where a power plant provides the energy for desalination. Alternatively, the facility's energy production may be dedicated to the production of potable water (a stand-alone facility), or excess energy may be produced and incorporated into the energy grid. Cogeneration takes various forms, and theoretically any form of energy production could be used. However, the majority of current and planned cogeneration desalination plants use either [[fossil fuels]] or [[nuclear power]] as their source of energy. Most plants are located in the [[Middle East]] or [[North Africa]], which use their petroleum resources to offset limited water resources. The advantage of dual-purpose facilities is they can be more efficient in energy consumption, thus making desalination more viable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.desal.2005.03.095| title = Overview of hybrid desalination systems — current status and future prospects| journal = Desalination| volume = 186| page = 207| year = 2005| last1 = Hamed | first1 = O.

The current trend in dual-purpose facilities is hybrid configurations, in which the permeate from reverse osmosis desalination is mixed with distillate from thermal desalination. Basically, two or more desalination processes are combined along with power production. Such facilities have been implemented in Saudi Arabia at [[Jeddah]] and [[Yanbu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0011-9164(04)00151-1| title = Hybrid systems in seawater desalination—practical design aspects, present status and development perspectives| journal = Desalination| volume = 164| page = 1| year = 2004| last1 = Ludwig | first1 = H. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economics===

Costs of desalinating sea water (infrastructure, energy, and maintenance) are generally higher than fresh water from rivers or [[groundwater]], [[water recycling]], and [[water conservation]], but alternatives are not always available. Desalination costs in 2013 ranged from US$0.45 to $1.00/cubic metre. More than half of the cost comes directly from energy cost, and since energy prices are very volatile, actual costs can vary substantially.&lt;ref name="Zhang 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vladan_Babovic/publication/269694158_HYDRO-D-09-00078/links/54925b6a0cf2484a3f3e0c41.pdf |last=Zhang|first=S.X.|author2=V.

Factors that determine the costs for desalination include capacity and type of facility, location, feed water, labor, energy, financing and concentrate disposal. Desalination [[still]]s control pressure, temperature and brine concentrations to optimize efficiency. [[nuclear power|Nuclear-powered]] desalination might be economical on a large scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf71.html |title=Nuclear Desalination |publisher=[[World Nuclear Association]] |date=January 2010 |accessdate=February 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Maude Barlow|Barlow, Maude]], and [[Tony Clarke (activist)|Tony Clarke]], [http://www.thenation.com/doc/20020902/barlow "Who Owns Water?"] ''The Nation'', 2002-09-02, via thenation.com.

While noting costs are falling, and generally positive about the technology for affluent areas in proximity to oceans, a 2004 study argued, "Desalinated water may be a solution for some water-stress regions, but not for places that are poor, deep in the interior of a continent, or at high elevation. Unfortunately, that includes some of the places with biggest water problems.", and, "Indeed, one needs to lift the water by 2000 m, or transport it over more than 1600 km to get transport costs equal to the desalination costs. Thus, it may be more economical to transport fresh water from somewhere else than to desalinate it. In places far from the sea, like [[New Delhi]], or in high places, like [[Mexico City]], transport costs  could match desalination costs. Desalinated water is also expensive in places that are both somewhat far from the sea and somewhat high, such as [[Riyadh]] and [[Harare]]. By contrast in other locations transport costs are much less, such as [[Beijing]], [[Bangkok]], [[Zaragoza]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], and, of course, coastal cities like [[Tripoli]]."&lt;ref&gt;Yuan Zhou and Richard S.J.

===Environmental===
Factors that determine the costs for desalination include capacity and type of facility, location, feed water, labor, energy, financing and concentrate disposal.

====Intake====
In the [[United States]], cooling water intake structures are regulated by the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA). These structures can have the same impacts to the environment as desalination facility intakes{{according to whom|date=April 2017}}. According to EPA, water intake structures cause adverse environmental impact by sucking fish and shellfish or their eggs into an industrial system. There, the organisms may be killed or injured by heat, physical stress, or chemicals. Larger organisms may be killed or injured when they become trapped against screens at the front of an intake structure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://water.epa.gov/lawsregs/lawsguidance/cwa/316b/ Water: Cooling Water Intakes (316b)]. water.epa.gov.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternative intake types that mitigate these impacts include beach wells, but they require more energy and higher costs.&lt;ref&gt;Cooley, Heather; [[Peter Gleick|Gleick, Peter H.]] and Wolff, Gary (June 2006) [http://pacinst.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2015/01/desalination-grain-of-salt.pdf DESALINATION, WITH A GRAIN OF SALT.

The [[Kwinana Desalination Plant]] opened in Perth in 2007. Water there and at Queensland's [[Gold Coast Desalination Plant]] and Sydney's [[Kurnell Desalination Plant]] is withdrawn at {{convert|0.1|m/s|abbr=on}}, which is slow enough to let fish escape. The plant provides nearly {{convert|140000|m3|abbr=on}} of clean water per day.&lt;ref name=npr&gt;Sullivan, Michael (June 18, 2007) [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=11134967 Australia Turns to Desalination Amid Water Shortage]. NPR.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Outflow====
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2012}}
Desalination processes produce large quantities of [[brine]], possibly at above ambient temperature, and contain residues of pretreatment and cleaning chemicals, their reaction byproducts and heavy metals due to corrosion.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, Joel (March 20, 2014) [http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2014/03/20/221880/israel-no-longer-worried-about.html Israel no longer worried about its water supply, thanks to desalination plants], ''[[The McClatchy Company|McClatchy DC]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Chemical pretreatment and cleaning are a necessity in most desalination plants, which typically includes prevention of biofouling, scaling, foaming and corrosion in thermal plants, and of biofouling, suspended solids and scale deposits in membrane plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.desal.2007.03.009 |title=Environmental impact and impact assessment of seawater desalination|year=2008|last1=Lattemann|first1=Sabine|last2=Höpner|first2=Thomas|journal=Desalination|volume=220|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To limit the environmental impact of returning the brine to the ocean, it can be diluted with another stream of water entering the ocean, such as the outfall of a [[Sewage treatment|wastewater treatment]] or power plant. With medium to large power plant and desalination plants, the power plant's cooling water flow is likely to be several times larger than that of the desalination plant, reducing the salinity of the combination. Another method to dilute the brine is to mix it via a diffuser in a mixing zone. For example, once a pipeline containing the brine reaches the sea floor, it can split into many branches, each releasing brine gradually through small holes along its length. Mixing can be combined with power plant or wastewater plant dilution.

Brine is denser than seawater and therefore sinks to the ocean bottom and can damage the ecosystem. Careful reintroduction can minimize this problem. Typical ocean conditions allow for rapid dilution, thereby minimizing harm.

====Alternatives without pollution====
Some methods of desalination, particularly in combination with [[evaporation pond]]s, [[solar still]]s, and [[condensation trap]] ([[solar desalination]]), do not discharge brine. They do not use chemicals or burn fossil fuels. They do not work with membranes or other critical parts, such as components that include heavy metals, thus do not produce toxic waste (and high maintenance).

A new approach that works like a solar still, but on the scale of industrial evaporation ponds is the [[integrated biotectural system]].&lt;ref name="PrototypeCreation"&gt;[http://www.prototype-creation.de/Inland_desalination.pdf ''Inland desalination with the Integrated Biotectural System''], by Nicol-André Berdellé, November, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; It can be considered "full desalination" because it converts the entire amount of saltwater intake into distilled water. One of the advantages of this system is the feasibility for inland operation. Standard advantages also include no air pollution and no temperature increase of endangered natural water bodies from power plant cooling-water discharge. Another important advantage is the production of sea salt for industrial and other uses. As of 2015, 50% of the world's sea salt production relies on fossil energy sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reverseosmosisguides.com/|title=Best Reverse Osmosis System |first=Merci|last=Jollibee|publisher=Reviews 2015 Ultimate Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A proposed alternative to desalination in the American Southwest is the commercial importation of bulk water from water-rich areas either by [[oil tanker]]s converted to water carriers, or pipelines.

In the year that the survey was conducted, the amount of water produced from the desalination plants constitutes about 50% of the quantity of fresh water supplied for all needs and about 80% of the water supplied for domestic and industrial needs in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.water.gov.il/Hebrew/WaterResources/Desalination/Pages/default.aspx|title=Israeli Water Authority|website=water.gov.il|accessdate=October 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experimental techniques==
Other desalination techniques include:

===Waste heat===
Thermally-driven desalination technologies are frequently suggested for use with low-temperature [[waste heat]] sources, as the low temperatures are not useful for many industrial processes, but ideal for the lower temperatures found in desalaination.&lt;ref name=WarsingerEntropy /&gt; In fact, such pairing with waste heat can even improve electrical process: 
[[Diesel generators]] commonly provide electricity in remote areas. About 40%–50% of the energy output is low-grade heat that leaves the engine via the exhaust. Connecting a thermal desalination technology such as [[membrane distillation]] system to the diesel engine exhaust repurposes this low-grade heat for desalination. The system actively cools the [[diesel generator]], improving its efficiency and increasing its electricity output. This results in an energy-neutral desalination solution. An example plant was commissioned by Dutch company [[Aquaver]] in March 2014 for [[Gulhi]], [[Maldives]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eip-water.eu/desalination-plant-powered-waste-heat-opens-maldives/ "Desalination plant powered by waste heat opens in Maldives"] ''European Innovation Partnerships (EIP) news.

Retrieved March 18, 2014''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Low-temperature thermal ===
Originally stemming from [[ocean thermal energy conversion]] research, [[low-temperature thermal desalination]] (LTTD) takes advantage of water boiling at low pressure, even at [[ambient temperature]]. The system uses pumps to create a low-pressure, low-temperature environment in which water boils at a temperature gradient of {{convert|8|-|10|C|F}} between two volumes of water. Cool ocean water is supplied from depths of up to {{convert|600|m|abbr=on}}. This water is pumped through coils to condense the water vapor. The resulting condensate is purified water. LTTD may take advantage of the temperature gradient available at power plants, where large quantities of warm wastewater are discharged from the plant, reducing the energy input needed to create a temperature gradient.&lt;ref name="isope1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sistla|first=Phanikumar V.S.|title=Low Temperature Thermal DesalinbationPLants|url=http://www.isope.org/publications/proceedings/ISOPE_OMS/OMS%202009/papers/M09-83Sistla.pdf|work=Proceedings of the Eighth (2009) ISOPE Ocean Mining Symposium, Chennai, India, September 20–24, 2009|publisher=International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineers|accessdate=June 22, 2010|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evaporation and condensation for crops===

===Other approaches===

Adsorption-based desalination (AD) relies on the moisture absorption properties of certain materials such as Silica Gel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Study of Silica Gel Adsorption Desalination System|url=https://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/bitstream/2440/82463/8/02whole.pdf|work=Jun Wei WU|accessdate=November 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hydrogel based desalination ====
[[File:TOC new.png|thumb|Scheme of the desalination machine: the desalination box of volume ''V''_&lt;sub&gt;box&lt;/sub&gt; contains a gel of volume ''V''_&lt;sub&gt;gel&lt;/sub&gt; which is separated by a sieve from the outer solution volume ''V''_&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt; =''V''_&lt;sub&gt;box&lt;/sub&gt;- ''V''_&lt;sub&gt;gel&lt;/sub&gt;. 	The box is connected to two big tanks with high and low salinity by two taps which can be opened and closed as desired. 	The chain of buckets expresses the fresh water consumption followed by refilling the low-salinity reservoir by salt water &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Thermodynamic model for a reversible desalination cycle using weak polyelectrolyte hydrogels|journal=Desalination|volume=442|page=32|doi=10.1016/j.desal.2018.05.002 |ref=Rud2018|year=2018|last1=Rud|first1=Oleg|last2=Borisov|first2=Oleg|last3=Košovan|first3=Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;.]]
The idea of the method is in the fact that when the hydrogel is put into contact with aqueous salt solution, it swells absorbing a solution with the ion composition different from the original one. This solution can be easily squeezed out from the gel by means of sieve or microfiltration membrane. The compression of the gel in closed system lead to change in salt concentration, whereas the compression in open system, while the gel is exchanging ions with bulk, lead to the change in the number of ions. The consequence of the compression and swelling in open and closed system conditions mimics the reverse Carnot Cycle of refrigerator machine. The only difference is that instead of heat this cycle transfers salt ions from the bulk of low salinity to a bulk of high salinity. Similarly to the Carnot cycle this cycle is fully reversible, so can in principle work with an ideal thermodynamic efficiency. Because the method is free from the use of osmotic membranes it can compete with reverse osmosis method. In addition, unlike the reverse osmosis, the approach is not sensitive to the quality of feed water and its seasonal changes, and allows the production of water of any desired concentration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Thermodynamic model for a reversible desalination cycle using weak polyelectrolyte hydrogels|journal=Desalination|volume=442|page=32|doi=10.1016/j.desal.2018.05.002 |ref=Rud2018|year=2018|last1=Rud|first1=Oleg|last2=Borisov|first2=Oleg|last3=Košovan|first3=Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Small-scale solar ====
The United States, France and the United Arab Emirates are working to develop practical [[solar desalination]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cleantechnica.com/2015/01/25/uae-france-announce-partnership-jointly-fund-renewable-energy-projects/ UAE &amp; France Announce Partnership To Jointly Fund Renewable Energy Projects], Clean Technica, January 25, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; AquaDania's WaterStillar has been installed at Dahab, Egypt, and in Playa del Carmen, Mexico. In this approach, a solar thermal collector measuring two square metres can distill from 40 to 60 litres per day from any local water source – five times more than conventional stills. It eliminates the need for plastic [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] bottles or energy-consuming water transport.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barrymansfield.com/pdf/Tapping%20A%20Market%20CNBC%20European%20Business.pdf Tapping the Market], CNBC European Business, October 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In Central California, a startup company WaterFX is developing a solar-powered method of desalination that can enable the use of local water, including runoff water that can be treated and used again. Salty groundwater in the region would be treated to become freshwater, and in areas near the ocean, seawater could be treated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Peters|first1=Adele|title=Can This Solar Desalination Startup Solve California Water Woes?|url=http://www.fastcoexist.com/3026234/can-this-solar-desalination-startup-solve-california-water-woes|work=Fast Company|accessdate=February 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Passarell ====
The Passarell process uses reduced atmospheric pressure rather than heat to drive evaporative desalination. The pure water vapor generated by distillation is then compressed and condensed using an advanced compressor. The compression process improves distillation efficiency by creating the reduced pressure in the evaporation chamber. The compressor [[centrifuge]]s the pure water vapor after it is drawn through a demister (removing residual impurities) causing it to compress against tubes in the collection chamber. The compression of the vapor increases its temperature. The heat is transferred to the input water falling in the tubes, vaporizing the water in the tubes. Water vapor condenses on the outside of the tubes as product water. By combining several physical processes, Passarell enables most of the system's energy to be recycled through its evaporation, demisting, vapor compression, condensation, and water movement processes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waterdesalination.com/theory.htm The "Passarell" Process].

==In nature==
[[File:Saltcrystals on avicennia marina var resinifera leaves.JPG|thumb|upright=0.45|Mangrove leaf with salt crystals]]
Evaporation of water over the oceans in the [[water cycle]] is a natural desalination process.

The formation of [[sea ice]] produces ice with little salt, much lower than in seawater.

Seabirds distill seawater using [[countercurrent exchange]] in a [[Salt gland|gland]] with a [[rete mirabile]]. The gland [[Na+/K+-ATPase|secretes highly concentrated brine]] stored near the nostrils above the beak. The bird then "sneezes" the brine out. As freshwater is not usually available in their environments, some seabirds, such as [[pelican]]s, [[petrel]]s, [[albatross]]es, [[gull]]s and [[tern]]s, possess this gland, which allows them to drink the salty water from their environments while they are far from land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Proctor|first=Noble S.|last2=Lynch|first2=Patrick J.|title=Manual of Ornithology|isbn=0300076193|year=1993|publisher=Yale University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ritchison|first=Gary|title=Avian osmoregulation|url=http://people.eku.edu/ritchisong/bird_excretion.htm|accessdate=April 16, 2011}} including images of the gland and its function&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mangrove]] trees grow in seawater; they secrete salt by trapping it in parts of the root, which are then eaten by animals (usually crabs). Additional salt is removed by storing it in leaves that fall off. Some types of mangroves have glands on their leaves, which work in a similar way to the seabird desalination gland. Salt is extracted to the leaf exterior as small [[crystal]]s, which then fall off the leaf.

[[Willow]] trees and [[Reed (plant)|reed]]s absorb salt and other contaminants, effectively desalinating the water. This is used in artificial [[constructed wetland]]s, for treating [[sewage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www2.humboldt.edu/arcatamarsh/enhancement4.html|title=Enhancement Marshes|last=|first=|date=|website=Arcata's Wastewater Treatment Plant &amp; The Arcata Marsh and Wildlife Sanctuary|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Desalination has been known to history for millennia as both a concept, and later practice, though in a limited form. The ancient Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] observed in his work ''[[Meteorology (Aristotle)|Meteorology]]'' that “salt water, when it turns into vapour, becomes sweet and the vapour does not form salt water again when it condenses,” and also noticed that a fine wax vessel would hold potable water after being submerged long enough in seawater, having acted as a membrane to filter the salt.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle with E.W. Webster, trans., ''Meteorologica'', in:  Ross, W. D., ed., ''The Works of Aristotle'', vol. 3, (Oxford, England:  Clarendon Press, 1931), Book III, [https://archive.org/stream/workstranslatedi03arisuoft#page/n71/mode/2up §358: 16–18 and §359: 1–5.]&lt;/ref&gt; There are numerous other examples of experimentation in desalination throughout Antiquity and the Middle Ages,&lt;ref&gt;See:
*  Joseph Needham, Ho Ping-Yu, Lu Gwei-Djen, Nathan Sivin, ''Science and Civilisation in China: Volume 5, Chemistry and Chemical Technology'' (Cambridge, England:  Cambridge University Press, 1980), [https://books.google.com/books?id=xrNDwP0pS8sC&amp;pg=PA60#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 60.]
*  [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]] (fl. 200 A.D.) wrote, in his commentary on Aristotle's ''Meteorology'', that if a lid is placed on a boiling pot of seawater, fresh water will condense on the lid.
*  In his ''Hexaemeron'', Homily IV, § 7, [[Basil of Caesarea|St. Basil of Caesarea]] (ca. 329–379 A.D.) mentioned that sailors produced fresh water via distillation.  Saint Basil with Sister Agnes Clare Way, trans., ''Saint Basil Exegetic Homilies'' (Washington, D.C.:  The Catholic University of America Press, 1963), p. 65.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=AWxwDmFvDiwC&amp;pg=PA65#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false From p. 65:]  "Moreover, it is possible to see the water of the sea boiled by sailors, who, catching the vapors in sponges, relieve their thirst fairly well in times of need."&lt;/ref&gt; but desalination was never feasible on a large scale until the modern era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.desware.net/Sample-Chapters/D01/01-003.pdf |title=Sample |website=www.desware.net |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the Industrial Revolution, desalination was primarily of concern to oceangoing ships, which otherwise needed to keep on board supplies of fresh water. When [[Protector (1779 frigate)]] was sold to Denmark in the 1780s (as the ship Hussaren) the desalination plant was studied and recorded in great detail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orlogsbasen.dk/Skibdk.htm Danish Naval Museum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231105643/http://www.orlogsbasen.dk/Skibdk.htm |date=December 31, 2012 }} - records for Hussaren&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
In the newly formed United States, Thomas Jefferson catalogued heat-based methods going back to the 1500s, and formulated practical advice that was publicized to all U.S. ships on the backs of sailing clearance permits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report on Desalination of Sea Water |url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/01-22-02-0296 |author=Thomas Jefferson |date=21 November 1791}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.monticello.org/site/research-and-collections/desalination-sea-water|title=Desalination of Sea Water - Thomas Jefferson's Monticello|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant research into improved desalination methods occurred in the United States after World War II. The [[Office of Saline Water]] was created in the [[United States Department of the Interior]] by the [[Saline Water Conversion Act]] of 1952.  It was merged into the [[Office of Water Resources Research]] in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/380.html|title=Records of the office of Saline Water|date=August 15, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research also took place at state universities in California, followed by development at the [[Dow Chemical Company]] and [[DuPont]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ide-tech.com/blog/publication/bankrolling-10-breakthrough-technologies-megascale-desalination/ |title=Bankrolling the 10 Breakthrough Technologies: Megascale Desalination |author=David Talbot |date=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many studies focus on ways to optimize desalination systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Singleton|first1=M.|last2=et.|first2=al.|title=Optimization of ramified absorber networks doing desalination|journal=Phys.

The term '''Finglish''' was introduced by professor [[Martti Nisonen]] in the 1920s in [[Hancock, Michigan|Hancock]], [[Michigan]], to describe a [[linguistics|linguistic]] phenomenon he encountered in America. As the term describes, Finglish is a [[Macaronic language|macaronic]] mixture of the [[English language|English]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]] languages. In Finglish, the English lexical items are nativized and inserted into the framework of Finnish morphology and syntax. Many consider the adoption of English loanwords into Finnish phonology, morphology, and syntax not to be proper Finnish, but rather a language in between. The term "Finglish" can imply that this adoption of loanwords and usage of language is incomplete and somehow less legitimate. However, this use of loanwords and code-switching amongst bilingual speakers is typical in communities experiencing language shift. The Finnish immigrants to the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] are one group that speak Finglish, but Finglish is also found in any place in Finland where international contacts and [[popular culture]] exists, including Finnish language learners. This more recent (post 1980’s) incorporation of English loanwords into modern Finnish as a result of globalization and advances in technology is a separate phenomenon from the North American Finnish, which developed primarily in the late 1800’s- mid 1900’s, though there are some similarities in form and function.

==History==
While almost all Finnish immigrants were able to read and write, it still took some time for many Finns to learn English because Finnish is a [[Finno-Ugric languages|Finno-Ugric]] language, structurally unrelated to English and other Indo-European languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alanen|first1=Arnold|title=Finns in Minnesota|date=2012|publisher=Minnesota Historical Society Press|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another reason for the delay is that many leaving Finland were farmers and laborers, and often migrated to areas of high Finnish settlement. Living and working with other Finnish speakers meant they had less need to learn English to get by in their day to day lives. Many other Finnish immigrants ended up in menial and industrial jobs, where they learned English through practice in order to get by in the workplace. Second and third generation Finnish Americans often learned to speak both Finnish and English, though the Finnish they learned differed from that spoken in Finland. This was due to a variety of reasons, including competing language inputs between Finnish and English and the fact that their Finnish input may have been different from that considered standard in Finland. Finglish originated amongst these first and second generation Finnish immigrants in US and Canada. The English language skills of the first generation American Finns tended to be limited; second and third-generation American Finns usually were more or less bilingual. Finglish emerged as a pidgin with something they already knew (Finnish) and something they were bound to learn (English).

As has been documented for several immigrant languages, one would expect that over time North American Finnish would reduce its [[Inflection|inflectional system]] in favor of prepositions and analytic constructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hirvonen|first1=Pekka|title=Finnish in the Upper Midwest|date=2005|publisher=Caravan Books|pages=217–243}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Benmamoun|first1=Elabbas|last2=Montrul|first2=Silvina|last3=Polinsky|first3=Maria|title=Heritage Languages and their speakers: Opportunities and challenges for linguistics|journal=Theoretical Linguistics|date=2013|volume=39|pages=129–181|doi=10.1515/tl-2013-0009|url=https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/12872219/Rethinking%20the%20native%20speaker%20revised%20MP.pdf?sequence=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nominal morphology is particularly vulnerable in heritage languages with robust morphology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Benmamoun|first1=Elabbas|last2=Montrul|first2=Silvina|last3=Polinsky|first3=Maria|title=Heritage Languages and their speakers: Opportunities and challenges for linguistics|journal=Theoretical Linguistics|date=2013|volume=39|pages=129–181|doi=10.1515/tl-2013-0009|url=https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/12872219/Rethinking%20the%20native%20speaker%20revised%20MP.pdf?sequence=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McCarthy | first1 = Corrine | year = 2008 | title = Morphological variability in the comprehension of agreement: an argument for representation over computation | url = | journal = Second Language Research | volume = 24 | issue = 4| pages = 459–486 | doi=10.1177/0267658308095737}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Heritage language|heritage speakers]] tend to become fluent in the majority language while never achieving native fluency in the heritage language, second and third generation speakers who learn the minority language from the first generation may not acquire the full inflectional system of the language spoken in the country of origin. The majority language may also influence the syntax and other features of the heritage language. Thus, North American Finnish differed not only in the lexical items used, but in aspects of morphology and syntax as well.

The majority of immigrants to America came from [[Ostrobothnia (historical province)|Ostrobothnia]] and the [[Northern Ostrobothnia]] areas in western Finland; over sixty percent of all emigrants who left the country  between 1893 and 1920 came from the provinces of Vaasa and Oulu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hoglund|first1=William A.|title=Finnish Immigrants in America: 1880-1920|date=1979|publisher=Ayer Company Publishers, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other Finnish immigrants were from the provinces of [[Savonia (historical province)|Savonia]] and [[Tavastia (historical province)|Tavastia]], and the Finnish spoken in North America also reflects those dialects.

==History of research==
Much work has been done in the last fifty years to document the speech of Finnish Americans in the United States and Canada, though little new data has been brought forward in the last 25 years. Pertti Virtaranta did extensive research on the Finnish spoken in North America, particularly in the Upper Midwest and Canada, taking three trips from 1965-1980 to interview speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Virtaranta|first1=Pertti|last2=Jönsson-Korhola|first2=Hannele|last3=Martin|first3=Maisa|last4=Kainulainen|first4=Maija|title=Amerikansuomi|date=1993|publisher=Suomalaisen Kirjallisuuden Seura}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interviews had standard questions asked of everyone including: why they (or their families) left Finland, what was the trip like, and how was it finding a job once in America. Otherwise, the interviews consisted of free conversation on whatever subject the participants found most interesting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Virtaranta|first1=Pertti|title=Amerikansuomen Sanakirja: A Dictionary of American Finnish|date=1992|publisher=Siirtolaisussinstituutti; Institute of Migration|pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maisa Martin wrote a dissertation on the phonology and morphology of American Finnish where she discusses the borrowings and changes between Finland Finnish and American Finnish.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Maisa. ''On the Morphology and Phonology of American Finnish.'' University of Jyväskylä, 1989. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Donald Larmouth did extensive research on the Finnish used by four generations in rural Finnish communities in northern Minnesota, interviewing a total of 62 respondents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Larmouth|first1=Donald Eilford|title=Differential interference in American Finnish Cases|journal=Language|date=1974|volume=50|issue=2|pages=356–366|doi=10.2307/412442}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his interviews he elicits personal narratives, has participants complete picture identification tasks with simple cartoons, and give translations of sentences. He documents what changes the language seems to have undergone, notably the levelling of several cases including the accusative and partitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Larmouth|first1=Donald Eilford|title=Differential interference in American Finnish Cases|journal=Language|date=1974|volume=50|issue=2|page=366|doi=10.2307/412442}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
This previous work on American Finnish reveals a lower frequency of accusative case and partitive case in heritage bilingual speakers with more pronounced changes the farther removed the generation was from the immigrant generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Larmouth|first1=Donald Eilford|title=Differential interference in American Finnish Cases|journal=Language|date=1974|volume=50|issue=2|pages=356–366|doi=10.2307/412442}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his interviews he elicits personal narratives, has participants complete picture identification tasks with simple cartoons, and give translations of sentences. He documents what changes the language seems to have undergone, notably the [[Morphological leveling|leveling]] of several cases including the accusative and partitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Larmouth|first1=Donald Eilford|title=Differential interference in American Finnish Cases|journal=Language|date=1974|volume=50|issue=2|page=366|doi=10.2307/412442}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Virtaranta|first1=Pertti|title=Amerikansuomen Sanakirja: A Dictionary of American Finnish|date=1992|publisher=Siirtolaisussinstituutti; Institute of Migration|pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hirvonen|first1=Pekka|title=Finnish in the Upper Midwest|date=2005|publisher=Caravan Books|pages=217–243}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the partitive and accusative were vulnerable, other cases  including the illative and ablative  remained robust in the speech of these speakers, though adjective case endings were especially prone to deletion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Larmouth|first1=Donald Eilford|title=Differential interference in American Finnish Cases|journal=Language|date=1974|volume=50|issue=2|page=366|doi=10.2307/412442}}&lt;/ref&gt; These previous works focus primarily on Finnish speakers in Minnesota and Michigan with Wisconsin underrepresented.

Words used in US Finglish often have completely different meanings in Finnish, especially when the Finglish terms are borrowings from English; they have become [[expressive loan]]s: ''ruuma'' (from and meaning 'room'; in Finnish meaning 'cargo hold'"), ''piiri'' ('beer'; 'district'), ''leijata'' ('to play'; 'to hover'), ''reisi'' ('crazy'; 'thigh'), and ''touvi'' ('stove'; 'halyard'). US Finglish compound words can produce combinations completely incomprehensible to native Finnish speakers, like ''piirikäki'' ('beer keg'; 'district cuckoo') or the somewhat less incomprehensible ''ilmapiika'' ('flight attendant'; 'air maid').

These older Finglish usages may not be bound to survive, and their original users are now in their 80s and 90s. The descendants of most American Finns are today either completely monolingual, or, if they have kept their ties to their grandparents' and great-grandparents' speech, use ordinary Finnish beside English.

Example of old-style Finglish:

{{quote|''Frank ja Wilbert oli Saran kanssa kaaralla käymäs vilitsis. Ne kävi haartveerstooris ostamas loonmouverin ja Sara kävi ottaan heerkatin piutisaluunasa. Kun ne tuli haussiin, niin mamma laitto äpylipaita.''}}

which translates as

{{quote|Frank and Wilbert were with Sara visiting the village by car. They went to hardware store to buy a lawn mower, while Sara had a haircut at beauty salon. When they came back to home, mom served apple pie.}}

For comparison, standard Finnish without anglicisms:

{{quote|''Frank ja Wilbert olivat Saran kanssa käymässä autolla kylässä. He kävivät rautakaupassa ostamassa ruohonleikkurin ja Sara kävi laitattamassa kampauksen kauneushoitolassa. Kun he tulivat kotiin, äiti laittoi omenapiirakkaa.''}}

Relatively few words from Finglish have become standard Finnish, but note ''{{lang|fi|kämppä}}'' 'log cabin' or "(temporary) accommodation', from English ''camp''; and ''{{lang|fi|mainari}}'' 'miner'.  These may, however, be direct borrowings from English in Finland.

==Later Finglish==
A new wave of Finglish has originated in Finland. Its sources are [[technology]], [[popular culture]], various [[sub-culture]]s, and [[fandom]]. It differs from [[slang]] in the sense that it also uses some English linguistic structures. Examples of some popular-culture Finglish expressions include ''vörkkiä'' ('to work'), ''biitsi'' ('beach'), ''spreijata'' ('to spray'), ''hengailla'' ('to hang out'), ''kruisailla'' ('to cruise in an automobile') and ''hevijuuseri'' ('heavy user'). While the earlier, North American Finglish was distinctively a working-class adult immigrants' language, the newer sort of Finglish is used by native Finnish youth in contact with the English language through [[Mass media|mass]] and [[social media]]. Finglish terms of today are a transitional phase of absorption of new terms and ideas from English into mainstream Finnish before the full nativization of the words, especially in situations where English (a very [[Productivity (linguistics)|productive]] yet [[Compound (linguistics)|compounding]] language) expresses a concept with one word, while Finnish would require several of them, or has no native term. This Finglish is not to be confused with [[Helsinki slang]], though the latter has absorbed some English loan words, too, in recent times.

The characteristics of current Finglish, in descending order of frequency, are:{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

|}

An example of today's Finglish might be:

{{quote|''Mä lainasin faijan autoo ja me mentiin Mikan, Jennin ja Hannan kanssa kruisaamaan. Ensin haettiin gasoo, sitten käytiin syömässä Mäkissä bögöt ja lopulta mentiin biitsille.''}}

which translates as

{{quote|I borrowed Dad's car and we went together with Mika, Jenni and Hanna cruising around. We first went to get some gasoline, then went to McDonald's (Mäkki &lt; Mäkdonalds &lt; McDonalds) to have burgers and in the end we went to the beach.}}

For comparison, without anglicisms, but still colloquial:

{{quote|''{{lang|fi|Mä lainasin faijan autoo ja me mentiin Mikan, Jennin ja Hannan kanssa ajelulle. Ensin haettiin löpöö, sitten käytiin syömässä [pikaruokalan] purilaiset ja lopulta mentiin rantsuun.}}''}}

And, in more literary Finnish:

{{quote|''{{lang|fi|Lainasin isäni autoa ja menimme Mikan, Jennin ja Hannan kanssa ajelulle. Ensin haimme polttoainetta, sitten kävimme pikaruokalassa syömässä hampurilaiset ja lopulta menimme rannalle.}}''}}

==Technical speech==
Finglish is today used most commonly in technology-related speech, where the majority of the loanwords originate in English. Since the English and Finnish language morphologies are vastly different and English pronunciation seldom fits in the Finnish speech immediately, the loan's orthography and pronunciation are nativized. Direct Finglish ''teknopuhe'' ('techspeak') expressions include '''printteri''' ('printer' – it is currently being ousted by the native word ''{{lang|fi|tulostin}}''), ''modeemi'' ('modem'), and ''prosessori'' or ''prossu'' ('[[Microprocessor|processor]]' – there is even a puristic word, ''{{lang|fi|suoritin}}'', which is heard often enough, but is still less common than the borrowings). Reified [[initialism]]s in Finglish include ''seepu'' from English ''[[Central processing unit|CPU]]'', and ''dimmi'' from ''[[Dual in-line memory module|DIMM]]''. Finglish is usually considered a transitional phase from literal loans into translationary loans ([[calque]]s). Examples of Finglish [[calque]]s are ''{{lang|fi|emolevy}}'' ('motherboard'), ''{{lang|fi|näyttö}}'' ('display'), ''{{lang|fi|ulkoistaa}}'' ('to outsource'), and ''{{lang|fi|sähköposti}}'' ('electronic mail' - the Finglish words ''eemeli'' [which, capitalized, is also a male name, the Finnish version of [[Emil (given name)|Emil]]&lt;nowiki /&gt;], ''iimeili'' or ''meili'' are still quite common). An example of a word where the transition is partial, is ''webbiselain'' ('Web browser'), where the word ''web'' has not yet been translated into Finnish ''{{lang|fi|verkko}}'' (and may never be).

An example of Finnish techspeak:

{{quote|''Mä tsekkasin sen serverin. Siinä oli täys snafu päällä. Siitä oli poveri kärtsännyt ja se oli sitten krässännyt totaalisesti. Kun sitä ei oltu ajettu hallitusti alas, siitä oli käyttispartitio korruptoitunut eikä se enää buutannut. Mä fiksasin siihen uuden poverin ja buuttasin sen korpulta.''}}

which would translate in English:

{{quote|I checked the server. It was in a complete [[Military slang|SNAFU]]. Its power supply had burnt out and it had then crashed totally. As it was not shut down in an orderly manner, its operating system partition was corrupted and it no longer booted. I fixed it with a new power supply and booted it from a floppy disk.}}

and a less anglicised, but still colloquial Finnish:

{{quote|''{{lang|fi|Mä tarkistin sen palvelimen. Se oli täysin hajalla. Siitä oli virtalähde kärtsännyt ja se oli sitten mennyt aivan jumiin. Kun sitä ei oltu ajettu hallitusti alas, siitä oli käyttisosio pilalla eikä se enää käynnistynyt. Mä hoidin siihen uuden virtalähteen ja käynnistin sen korpulta.}}''}}

An approximation in literary Finnish:

{{quote|''{{lang|fi|Tarkistin sen palvelimen. Se oli täysin hajalla. Siitä oli virtalähde kärähtänyt ja se oli sitten mennyt aivan jumiin. Kun sitä ei ollut ajettu hallitusti alas, siitä oli käyttöjärjestelmäosio pilalla eikä se enää käynnistynyt. Hoidin siihen uuden virtalähteen ja käynnistin sen levykkeeltä.}}''}}

==Neologisms==
Sometimes English words are used as the basis of Finnish conceptual neologisms, like ''nörtti'', 'computer enthusiast', from English ''nerd''; or ''nyypiö'','''nyyppä'', or ''noobi'', 'newbie', i.e. 'beginner' (the first two variants influenced by the native Finnish ''{{lang|fi|hyypiö}}'' meaning a 'freak' or 'eccentric person').

Since most current Finglish user are fluent in Finnish and to some extent English, direct translations are sometimes used in humorous or oxymoronic concepts, such as ''julkinen talo'' (literally 'public house') for ''{{lang|fi|pubi}}'' (borrowed long ago from English), or ''käytännöllinen pila'' (lit. 'practical joke') for native Finnish ''{{lang|fi|kepponen}}'' ('prank', 'shenanigan').

English loanwords that originate in Latin are usually amalgamated in Finnish by using the Latin and not English orthography and grammar.

==History==
The Government of Free Vietnam was an [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] political organization that was established 30 April 1995 by Nguyen Hoang Dan. It was dissolved in 2013.

The Provisional National Government of Vietnam stated that the political goals of its organization were to:
# The stated goal of the Provisional National Government of Vietnam is to achieve FREE AND DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS IN VIETNAM. The government seeks to create an atmosphere of non-violent pressure on the Communist’s regime to allow for an election process whereby the people can choose whether or not to retain communism as the preferred system of governance

=== Economy ===
The GFVN had an approximate budget of [[United States dollar|US$]]1 million a year, donated by  Vietnamese expatriates around the world{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}.

==Base in Cambodia==
KC-702 was a military base that was operated by the Provisional Government of Free Vietnam, probably located in [[Cambodia]], near the Vietnamese border.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=20816 Catholic World News, A Regime Near Collapse, Dec. 20, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that this was once used to help plan the failed Vietnamese Embassy bombing in [[Laos]]. The current status of the camp is not known. However, in 1999 several members of the group were captured in Cambodia with weapons, deported to Vietnam and charged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/425368.stm|title=BBC News {{!}} Asia-Pacific {{!}} Viet anti-communists deny arms smuggling|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925''' is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], that makes the sale of [[peerage]]s or any other [[British honours system|honours]] illegal. It was brought in after the Coalition government of [[David Lloyd George]] was severely embarrassed by the sale of honours, for the personal  financial gain of the Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;T. A. Jenkins, "The funding of the Liberal Unionist party and the honours system." ''English Historical Review'' 105.417 (1990): 920-938.&lt;/ref&gt; The practice was legal and dated back several decades;&lt;ref&gt;Harold J. Hanham, "The sale of honours in late Victorian England." ''Victorian Studies'' 3#3 (1960): 277-289.&lt;/ref&gt; Lloyd George made the practice more systematic and more brazen, charging £10,000 for a knighthood, £30,000 for baronetcy, and £50,000 upwards for a peerage.&lt;ref&gt; Peter Rowland, ''Lloyd George'' (1975) p 448.&lt;/ref&gt; Prime Minister Lloyd George in mid-1922 was fast losing his political support, and his sales were denounced in the House of Lords as an abuse of the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]'s powers of patronage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Travis L. Crosby|title=The Unknown David Lloyd George: A Statesman in Conflict|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MIW9AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA330|year=2014|publisher=I.B.Tauris|page=330}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only one person has ever been convicted under the Act &amp;mdash;[[Maundy Gregory]], Lloyd George's "honours broker", in 1933&amp;mdash; whose same behaviour in 1918 was the main cause of the Act in the first place. Gregory's 1933 conviction was secured over his attempts to broker the selling of Vatican knighthoods in the UK. To this date, the Act has never been successfully used to convict anyone involved in the sale of UK honours.

==2006: Cash for honours==
{{main|Cash for Honours}}
In March 2006, the [[Metropolitan Police]] confirmed that, following complaints by the [[Scottish National Party]] and others, they were investigating possible breaches of the Act.  A total of £14 million in loans was given by wealthy individuals to Labour during the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election campaign]] and four of these men were subsequently nominated for [[Life Peerage]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="63795">In the 1960s a '''human rights movement''' began to emerge in the USSR. Those actively involved did not share a single set of beliefs. Many wanted a variety of [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] — freedom of expression, of religious belief, of national self-determination. To some it was crucial to provide a truthful record of what was happening in the country, not the heavily censored version provided in official media outlets. Others still were "reform Communists"  who thought it possible to change the Soviet system for the better. 

Gradually, under the pressure of official actions and responses these groups and interests coalesced in the [[Soviet dissidents|dissident milieu]].  The fight for civil and human rights focused on issues of [[Censorship in the Soviet Union|freedom of expression]], [[Persecution of Christians in the Soviet Union|freedom of conscience]], [[Refusenik|freedom to emigrate]], [[Political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union|punitive psychiatry]], and the plight of [[Political repression in the Soviet Union|political prisoners]]. It was characterized by a new openness of dissent, a concern for legality, the rejection of any 'underground' and violent struggle.&lt;ref name="daniel-istoki2"&gt;{{cite journal|date=2002|title=Истоки и корни диссидентской активности в СССР|trans-title=Sources and roots of dissident activity in the USSR|url=http://magazines.russ.ru/nz/2002/21/dan.html|journal=Неприкосновенный запас [Emergency Ration]|language=Russian|volume=1|issue=21|author=Daniel, Alexander}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other dissidents in the post-Stalin Soviet Union, human rights activists were subjected to a broad range of repressive measures. They received warnings from the police and the KGB; some lost their jobs, others were imprisoned or incarcerated in [[Psikhushka|psychiatric hospitals]]; dissidents were sent into exile within the country or pressured to emigrate.&lt;ref name="wawra"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Human Rights And History: A Challenge for Education|last=Wawra|first=Ernst|date=2010|isbn=978-3-9810631-9-6|location=Berlin|pages=130–141|chapter=The Helsinki Final Act and the Civil and Human Rights Movement in the Soviet Union}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|145}}

== Methods and activities ==

=== Samizdat documentation ===
{{See also|Censorship in the Soviet Union}}The documentation of political repressions as well as citizens' reactions to them through ''[[samizdat]]'' (unsanctioned self-publishing) methods played a key role in the formation of the human rights movement. Dissidents collected and distributed transcripts, open letters and appeals relating to specific cases of political repressions.&lt;ref group=c&gt;[https://chronicle6883.wordpress.com/2013/09/22/5-1-survey-of-samizdat-in-1968/ ''A Chronicle of Current Events (CCE)'' 5.1 (31 December 1968), "A Survey of samizdat in 1968".]&lt;/ref&gt;

The prototype for this type of writing was journalist [[Frida Vigdorova]]'s record of the trial of poet [[Joseph Brodsky]] (convicted for "[[Parasitism (social offense)|social parasitism]]" in early 1964).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Katz|first2=Michael R.|date=2014|title=The Trial of Joseph Brodsky|url=http://www.nereview.com/files/2014/01/NER-Vigdorova.pdf|journal=New England Review|volume=34|issue=3–4|pages=183–207|doi=10.1353/ner.2014.0022|issn=2161-9131|last1=Vigdorova|first1=Frida|accessdate=2016-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Protest, Reform and Repression in Khrushchev's Soviet Union|last=Hornsby|first=Rob|date=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-03092-3|series=New studies in European history|location=Cambridge, U.K. ; New York|page=279}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar documenting activity was taken up by dissidents in publications such as [[Alexander Ginzburg]]'s ''White Book'' (1967, on the [[Sinyavsky–Daniel trial|Sinyavsky-Daniel]] case)&lt;ref group=c&gt;[https://chronicle6883.wordpress.com/2013/09/21/4-6-an-addition-to-the-white-book-about-sinyavsky-and-daniel/ CCE 4.6 (31 October 1968) "An addition to the White Book about Sinyavsky and Daniel".]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pavel Litvinov]]'s ''The Trial of the Four'' (1968, on the [[Galanskov–Ginzburg trial|Galanskov–Ginzburg]] case).&lt;ref group=c&gt;[https://chronicle6883.wordpress.com/no-1-30-april-1968/ CCE 1 (30 April 1968).]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1968 on, the samizdat periodical ''[[Chronicle of Current Events|A Chronicle of Current Events]]'' played a key role for the human rights movement. Founded in April 1968, the ''Chronicle'' ran until 1983, producing 65 issues in 14 years.&lt;ref group=c&gt;[https://chronicle6883.wordpress.com/ ''A Chronicle of Current Events'' (in English).]&lt;/ref&gt; It documented the extensive human rights violations committed by the Soviet government and the ever-expanding samizdat publications (political tracts, fiction, translations) circulating among the critical and opposition-minded.

=== Protest letters and petitions ===
''Podpisanty'', literally signatories, were individuals who signed a series of petitions to officials and the Soviet press against political trials of the mid- to late-1960s.&lt;ref group=c&gt;[https://chronicle6883.wordpress.com/2013/09/25/1-2-protests-about-the-trial/ CCE 1.2 (30 April 1968), "Protests about the trial".]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''podpisanty'' surge reached its high water mark during the [[Galanskov-Ginzburg trial|trial of writers Aleksandr Ginzburg and Yuri Galanskov]] in January 1968.&lt;ref name="alexeyeva-dissent3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Soviet Dissent: Contemporary Movements for National, Religious, and Human Rights|last=Alexeyeva|first=Lyudmila|date=1987|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|others=Carol Pearce, John Glad (trans.)|isbn=978-0-8195-6176-3|location=Middletown, Conn.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|280}} The authorities responded to this challenge by offering each ''podpisant'' a choice between recantation and some kind of professional punishment.&lt;ref name="horvath-legacy3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Legacy of Soviet Dissent: Dissidents, Democratisation and Radical Nationalism in Russia|last=Horvath|first=Robert|publisher=RoutledgeCurzon|year=2005|isbn=9780203412855|location=London; New York|chapter=The rights-defenders}}{{rp|70–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|151}}&lt;ref name="alexeyeva-thaw2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Thaw Generation: Coming of Age in the Post-Stalin Era|last=Alexeyeva|first=Lyudmila|date=1993|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|isbn=978-0822959113|location=Pittsburgh, PA}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|177ff.;191ff}} Nevertheless, by 1968 more than 1500 people had signed appeals protesting various cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The KGB File of Andrei Sakharov|date=2005|others=Joshua Rubenstein, Alexander Gribanov (eds.), Ella Shmulevich, Efrem Yankelevich, Alla Zeide (trans.)|isbn=978-0-300-12937-3|location=New Haven, CN|pages=4|last1=Rubenstein|first1=Joshua|last2=Gribanov|first2=Alexander}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Soviet dissidents to appeal to the world public were [[Larisa Bogoraz]] and [[Pavel Litvinov]], who wrote an open letter protesting the trial of samizdat authors Alexander Ginsburg and Yuri Galanskov in January 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Obshchestvennost' and Civic Agency in Late Imperial and Soviet Russia: Interface between State and Society|last=Matsui|first=Yasuhiro|date=2015|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|isbn=978-1-137-54723-1|location=London|pages=198–218|chapter=Obshchestvennost’ across Borders: Soviet Dissidents as a Hub of Transnational Agency|editors=Yasuhiro Matsui (ed.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Appeals to the international community and human rights bodies later became a central method of early civic dissident groups such as the [[Initiative Group for the Defense of Human Rights in the USSR|Action Group]]&lt;ref group=c&gt;[https://chronicle6883.wordpress.com/2013/09/28/8-10-appeal-to-the-un-commission-on-human-rights/ CCE 8.10 (30 June 1969) "An appeal to the UN Commission on Human Rights".]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Committee on Human Rights in the USSR|Committee on Human Rights]], as well as the [[Moscow Helsinki Group|Helsinki Watch Groups]].

=== Demonstrations ===
Limited in scope and number, several demonstrations nevertheless became significant landmarks of the human rights movement.

On 5 December 1965 (Soviet Constitution Day) a small rally in Moscow, which became known as the ([[glasnost meeting]]), the first public and overtly political demonstration took place in the post-Stalin USSR. Responding to the criminal charges against the writers Andrei Sinyavsky and Yuli Daniel ([[Sinyavsky–Daniel trial]]), a few dozen people gathered on Pushkin Square, calling for a trial open to the public and the media (glasny sud), as required by the 1961 RSFSR Code of Criminal Procedure. The demonstration was one of the very first organized actions by the civil right movement in the Soviet Union. Silent gatherings on that date became an annual event.

A similar demonstration followed in January 1967, when a group of young demonstrators protested against the recent arrests of samizdat authors, and against the introduction of new articles to the Criminal Code that restricted the right to protest.&lt;ref name="horvath-legacy3" /&gt;{{Rp|74}}

Responding to the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia]], on 25 August 1968 seven dissidents demonstrated on Red Square ([[1968 Red Square demonstration]]).&lt;ref group=c&gt;[https://chronicle6883.wordpress.com/1968-1969-cce-1-11-e/no-3-30-august-1968/ CCE 3 (30 August 1968).]&lt;/ref&gt; The participants were subsequently sentenced to terms of imprisonment in labor camps, banishment to Siberia or incarceration in psychiatric prison-hospitals.&lt;ref group=c&gt;[https://chronicle6883.wordpress.com/2013/09/21/4-1-the-trial-of-the-demonstrators-on-red-square/ CCE 4.1 (30 October 1968), "The trial of the demonstrators on Red Square."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208185512/https://chronicle6883.wordpress.com/2013/09/21/4-1-the-trial-of-the-demonstrators-on-red-square/ |date=8 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 October 1974, dissidents initiated a [[Initiative Group for the Defense of Human Rights in the USSR#Day of the Political Prisoner|Day of the Political Prisoner in the USSR]], intended to raise awareness of the existence and conditions of political prisoners throughout the Soviet Union.&lt;ref group=c&gt;[https://chronicle6883.wordpress.com/no-33-10-december-1974/ CCE 33.1 (10 December 1974), "Political Prisoners' Day in the USSR."]&lt;/ref&gt; It was marked by hunger strikes in prisons and labor camps, and became an annual event marked by political prisoners in labor camps.

=== Civic watch groups ===
Starting with the [[Action Group for the Defense of Human Rights in the USSR|Action (Initiative) Group]] formed in 1969 by 15 dissidents and the [[Committee on Human Rights in the USSR]] founded in 1970 by [[Andrei Sakharov]], early Soviet human rights groups legitimized their work by referring to the principles enshrined in the [[Constitution of the Soviet Union|Soviet constitution]] and to international agreements.

These attempts were later succeeded by the more successful [[Moscow Helsinki Group]] (founded 1977). The group as well as the watch groups modeled after it brought the human rights dissidents to increased international attention.

The dissident civil and human rights groups were faced with harsh repressions, with most members facing imprisonment, punitive psychiatry, or exile.

=== Mutual aid for prisoners of conscience ===
Families of arrested dissidents often suffered repercussions such as the loss of jobs and opportunities to study. Relatives and friends of political prisoners supported each other through informal networks of volunteers. From 1974 on, this support was bolstered by the [[Solzhenitsyn Aid Fund|Solzhenitzyn Aid fund]] set up by the expelled dissident writer [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn|Alexander Solzhenitsyn]]. Despite limited resources and a crackdown by the [[KGB]], it was used to distribute funds and material support to the prisoners' families.

== Background ==
{{Context|section|date=February 2016}}
{{Broader|Soviet dissidents}}{{See also|Khrushchev Thaw|Sixtiers}}
In the wake of  [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s 1956 "[[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|Secret Speech]]" condemning crimes of Stalinism and the following relative political relaxation ([[Khrushchev Thaw]]), several events and factors formed the background for a dissident movement focused on civil and human rights.&lt;!-- Acts of individual protest: In March of 1956, physicist and future founder of the Moscow Helsinki Watch Group Yury Orlov spoke against re-Stalinization at the Academy of Sciences Institute of Physics. He was forced to leave Moscow for a period of fifteen years.&lt;ref name="alexeyeva-dissent2" /&gt;{{Rp|271}} Similar speeches were made by several others, such as philosopher [[Grigory Pomerants|Grigori Pomerants]]; many suffered repercussions for these acts of individual protest. --&gt;

=== Mayakovsky Square poetry readings ===
A major impulse for the current of dissent later known as the civil or human rights movement came from individuals concerned with literary and cultural freedom. During 1960-61 and again in 1965, public poetry readings in Moscow's Mayakovsky Square ([[Mayakovsky Square poetry readings]]) served as a platform for politically charged literary dissent. Provoking measures ranging from expulsions from universities to lengthy labor camp terms for some of the participants, the regular meetings served as an incubator for many protagonists of the human rights movement, including writer [[Alexander Ginzburg]] and student [[Vladimir Bukovsky]].

=== Dissidents in the mid-1960s ===
By the mid-1960s, dissenting voices in the Soviet Union also included movements of nations that had been deported under Stalin, religious movements that opposed the anti-religious state directives, and other groups such as reform communists and independent unions.

Some later human rights activists came from a circle of reform communists around [[Pyotr Grigorenko]], a Ukrainian army general who fell out of favor in the early 1960s. The [[Crimean Tatars]], an ethnic group who had been [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|deported under Stalin]] and who had formed a movement petitioning to return to their homeland, would serve as an inspiration for the human rights activists, and their leader [[Mustafa Dzhemilev]] was later active in the broader human rights movement. Others who made an impact on the future movement were religious activists, such as Russian Orthodox priest [[Gleb Yakunin]], who penned an influential open letter to the [[Patriarch of Moscow]] [[Patriarch Alexy I of Moscow|Alexius I]] in 1965, arguing that the Church must be liberated from the total control of the Soviet state.

The civil and human rights initiatives of the 1960s and 1970s managed to consolidate such different currents within the dissident spectrum by focusing on issues of freedom of expression, freedom of conscience, freedom to emigrate, and political prisoners. The movement became informed by "an idea of civic protest as an existentialist act, one not burdened with any political connotations."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Alexander Daniel, "1968 in Moscow: A Beginning", [[Heinrich Böll Foundation]], accessed on April 22, 2009 from http://www.eurozine.com/articles/2008-09-02-daniel-en.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Emergence of "defenders of rights"===
The circle of human rights activists in the Soviet Union formed as a result of several events in 1966-68. Marking the end of Khrushchev's relative liberalism ([[Khrushchev Thaw]]) and the beginning of the Brezhnev epoch ([[Era of Stagnation|Brezhnev stagnation]]), these years saw an increase in political repression. A succession of writers and dissidents warning against a return to Stalinism were put on trial, and the beginnings of political liberalization reforms in the [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]] ([[Prague Spring]]) were crushed with military force.

Critically minded individuals reacted by petitioning against abuses and documenting them in ''[[samizdat]]'' (underground press) publications, and a small group turned towards protesting openly and eventually began to appeal to the international community. Those who insisted on protesting rights violations became known as "defenders of rights" (''pravozashchitniki'').&lt;ref name="horvath-legacy"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = RoutledgeCurzon| isbn = 9780203412855| last = Horvath| first = Robert| title = The Legacy of Soviet Dissent: Dissidents, Democratisation and Radical Nationalism in Russia| location = London; New York| year = 2005| chapter = The rights-defenders | pages = 70–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avoiding moral and political commentary in favor of close attention to legal and procedural issues, they demanded that the existing laws and rights formally guaranteed by the Soviet state be observed. This approach became a common cause for diverse social groups in the dissident millieu, ranging from academics to activists in the youth subculture.&lt;ref name="horvath-legacy" /&gt;

==== Sinyavsky-Daniel trial (1966) – First rights-defense activity ====

{{Main article|Sinyavsky–Daniel trial|Glasnost meeting}}In the mid-1960s, a number of writers who warned of a return to [[Stalinism]] were put on trial. One such a case was the [[Sinyavsky–Daniel trial|1966 trial of Yuli Daniel and Andrei Sinyavsky]], two writers who had published satirical writings under pseudonyms in the West. They were sentenced to seven years in a labor camp for "[[anti-Soviet agitation]]". The trial was perceived by many in the intelligentsia as a return to previous Soviet [[show trial]]s. It provoked a number of demonstrations and petition campaigns, mostly in [[Moscow]] and [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]], which emphasizes issues of creative freedom and the historical role of the writer in Russian society.{{quotebox|right|width=35%
|quote=
[Volpin] would explain to anyone who cared to listen a simple but unfamiliar idea: all laws ought to be understood in exactly the way they are written and not as they are interpreted by the government and the government ought to fulfil those laws to the letter [...]. What would happen if citizens acted on the assumption that they have rights? If one person did it, he would become a martyr; if two people did it, they would be labelled an enemy organization; if thousands of people did it, the state would have to become less oppressive.
|source=[[Lyudmila Alexeyeva]] on the approach spearheaded by [[Alexander Esenin-Volpin]]&lt;ref name=alexeyeva-dissent/&gt;{{rp|275}}
}}In December 1965, the Sinyavsky-Daniel case motivated a small current of dissidents who decided to focus the legality of the trial. Mathematician [[Alexander Esenin-Volpin]] with the help of writer [[Yuri Galanskov]] and student [[Vladimir Bukovsky]] organized an unsanctioned rally on Pushkin Square ("[[Glasnost Meeting|glasnost meeting]]"). The demonstrators demanded an open trial for the writers as formally guaranteed by the Soviet Constitution. A "Civic Appeal" distributed through samizdat informed potential demonstrators of the rights being violated in the case and informed them of the possibility of formally legal protest.

Such focus on openly invoking rights was seen by many fellow dissidents to be utopian, and the demonstration as ineffective, carrying the risk of arrest, the loss of careers or imprisonment.&lt;ref name="alexeyeva-dissent2"&gt;{{Cite book|publisher = Wesleyan University Press|isbn = 978-0-8195-6176-3|last = Alexeyeva|first = Lyudmila|author2 = John Glad|others = Carol Pearce (trans.)|title = Soviet Dissent: Contemporary Movements for National, Religious, and Human Rights|location = Middletown, Conn.|year = 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|275}} Nevertheless, the approach was taken up by other dissenting individuals such as Bukovsky, who organized a protest against the introduction of new articles to the Criminal Code he considered unconstitutional, and invoked the Criminal Code and the Soviet Constitution at his own trial in September 1967.

Following the trial of Sinyavsky and Daniel, writers [[Alexander Ginzburg]] and [[Yuri Galanskov]], who had previously edited a number of underground poetry anthologies, compiled documents relating to the trial in a samizdat collection called ''The White Book'' (1966). Signaling that he considered this activity to be legal, Ginzburg sent a copy to the KGB, the Communist Party Central Committee as well as to publishers abroad.

==== Trial of the Four (1967) – Increased protests and samizdat ====
{{Main article|Trial of the Four}}

In 1967, [[Alexander Ginzburg]] and [[Yuri Galanskov]] were detained along with two other dissidents and charged with "[[anti-Soviet agitation]]" for their work on ''The White Book''. Ginzburg was sentenced to five years, Galanskov to seven years in labor camps. Their trial became another landmark in the rights-defense movement and motivated renewed protest ([[Trial of the Four]]).

In January 1967, a protest was organized against the arrest of Ginzburg and Galanskov, and against the introduction new laws classifying public gatherings or demonstrations as a crime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bukovsky-archives.net See Bukovsky Archives, Section 3.1 "1960–1969", 4 September 1967, P 1393]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vladimir Bukovsky]], [[Vadim Delaunay]], Victor Khaustov and Evgeny Kushev were arrested for organizing and taking part. At his own closed trial in September 1967, Bukovsky used his final words to attack the regime's failure to respect the law or follow legal procedures in its conduct of the case.&lt;ref name="horvath-legacy2"&gt;{{Cite book|publisher = RoutledgeCurzon|isbn = 978-0-203-41285-5|volume = 17|last = Horvath|first = Robert|title = The Legacy of Soviet Dissent: Dissidents, Democratisation and Radical Nationalism in Russia|location = London; New York|series = BASEES/Routledge Series on Russian and East European Studies|year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|74–75}} His final words in court circulated widely in samizdat and became part of a collection of materials about the case by [[Pavel Litvinov]].&lt;ref name="litvinov-demonstration"&gt;{{cite book|last = Litvinov|first = Pavel|title = The demonstration in Pushkin Square.

In January 1968, linguist [[Larisa Bogoraz]] (wife of imprisoned writer [[Yuli Daniel]]) and physics teacher [[Pavel Litvinov]] wrote an open letter protesting the trial of Ginzburg and Galanskov. The appeal departed from the accepted tradition of addressing appeals to Soviet officials and became the first direct appeal by dissidents to the international public. Reminding readers of the terror of [[Stalinism]], Bogoraz and Litvinov listed in great detail the violations of law and justice committed during the trial, and asked the Soviet and world public to demand that the prisoners be released from custody and that the trial be repeated in the presence of international observers. The document was signed with their full names and addresses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=bogoraz-litvinov-appeal-eng /&gt;

==== 1968 Red Square demonstration (1968) ====

{{Main article|1968 Red Square demonstration}}

In August 1968, the [[Prague Spring]] became the second major development from which the human rights movement emerged. For many members of the intelligentsia, [[Alexander Dubček]]'s political liberalization reforms were connected with the hope for a decline in repressions and a "socialism with a human face". In August 1968, the [[Soviet Union]] and its main allies in the [[Warsaw Pact]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;invaded the [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]] in order to halt the reforms.&lt;ref name="Global"&gt;{{cite web|author = globalsecurity.org|title = Global Security, Soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia|date = 27 April 2005|publisher = GlobalSecurity.org|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/czechoslovakia2.htm|accessdate = 19 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 August 1968, seven dissidents demonstrated on Moscow's [[Red Square]] against the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia]] ([[1968 Red Square demonstration]]). All participants were arrested. None of the participants plead guilty, and they were subsequently sentenced to labor camps or of psychiatric imprisonment. Poet [[Natalya Gorbanevskaya]] collected testimonies on the demonstration as ''Noon'' (1968) before her incarceration in 1970.

=== First organized human rights activism ===

==== ''Chronicle of Current Events (1968–1982)'' ====
{{Main article|Chronicle of Current Events}}[[File:The_Chronicle_of_the_Current_Events.jpg|208x208px|''[[Chronicle of Current Events]]'' No 5, 31 December 1968 (front cover)|thumb]]

As a result of contacts between family members of political prisoners and the increased samizdat activity in the wake of trials, critically minded adults and youngsters in Moscow (later they would be known as [[Soviet dissidents|dissidents]]) were confronted by a growing range of information about ongoing [[political repression in the Soviet Union]].

In April 1968, marking the declared International Human Rights Year by the [[United Nations]], anonymous editors in Moscow released the first issue of the ''Chronicle of Current Events''. The typewritten [[samizdat]] bulletin was written in a documentary style and reported news about dissident activism, repression, and the penitentiary system.&lt;ref name="horvath-legacy" /&gt; Every issue of the ''Chronicle'' reprinted Article 19 of the 1948 UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which stated: "Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers."

The coverage of the ''Chronicle'' attempted to include repressions against all the constituent nations, confessional and ethnic groups of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Andrew, Christopher|title = The Mitrokhin archive|journal = [[RUSI Journal]]|date = 2000|volume = 145|issue = 1|pages = 52–56|doi = 10.1080/03071840008446488}}&lt;/ref&gt; It served as the backbone of the human rights movement in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Despite harsh crackdowns (such as the KGB's [[Chronicle of Current Events#Case24|Case No. 24]]) and the imprisonment of many of its editors, more than sixty issues of the Chronicle would be compiled and circulated published between April 1968 to December 1982.

==== ''Initiative Group'' and ''Committee on Human Rights'' (1969–1979) ====
{{Main article|Initiative Group for the Defense of Human Rights in the USSR|Committee on Human Rights in the USSR}}While the early human rights movement was dominated by individual activists, the end of the 1960s saw the formation of the first civil and human rights organizations in the Soviet Union.

The formation of these groups broke a taboo on organized public activity by non-state structures. The Soviet press had routinely attacked dissidents for tenuous links to exile groups like the Frankfurt-based [[National Alliance of Russian Solidarists]]. Many thus saw it as self-evident that the state would respond to the creation of a real organization by immediately arresting all of its members. The organizations that formed legitimized their work by referring to the principles enshrined in the Soviet constitution and, for the first time, to international agreements. All took particular care to emphasize the legality of their actions.
* The [[Initiative Group for the Defense of Human Rights in the USSR|Initiative (or Action) Group for Human Rights in the USSR]] was founded in May 1969 by [[Soviet dissidents]] to unify existing human rights circles. The group petitioned to the [[UN Commission on Human Rights]] and other international bodies on behalf of the victims of Soviet repression. It included many key figures in the rights defense bulletin ''[[Chronicle of Current Events]]''. By May 1970, six of the fifteen original members were arrested or exiled. While the group never officially disbanded, its last member [[Tatyana Velikanova]] was imprisoned in 1979.
* The [[Committee on Human Rights in the USSR]] was founded in November 1970 by [[Andrei Sakharov]] together with physicists [[Andrei Tverdokhlebov]] and [[Valery Chalidze]]. It was founded with a scholarly approach of exploring the application of human rights in a socialist context and was centered upon Chalidze's samizdat journal ''Social Problems''.&lt;ref name="horvath-legacy" /&gt;{{Rp|77}} The Committee publicized human rights violations, collected signatures for petitions, attended trials and succeeded in affiliating with several international human rights organizations. Its activities waned in 1973-1974 after Chalidze was stripped of his citizenship.
* The USSR's section of [[Amnesty International]] was founded in October 1973 by a group of 11 intellectuals including [[Andrei Tverdokhlebov]], [[Valentin Turchin]], [[Yuri Orlov]], [[Sergei Kovalev]] and others. It was registered in September 1974 by the Amnesty International Secretariat in London.

=== Crisis and international recognition (1972–1975) ===
In 1972, the [[KGB]] initiated [[Chronicle of Current Events#Case24|Case 24]], a wide-ranging crackdown intended to suppress the ''Chronicle of Current Events.'' Accused of "[[anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda]]", two of the arrested editors, Peter Yakir and Victor Krasin, began to collaborate with their interrogators and implicated over 200 dissidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rightsinrussia.info/archive/russian-media/grani-ru/podrabinek/krasin|title=An Unsavoury Story - Human Rights in Russia|website=www.rightsinrussia.info|access-date=2016-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[KGB]] issued a threat that, for every issue published after the broadcast, there would be further arrests.&lt;ref name="gilligan"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Defending Human Rights in Russia: Sergei Kovalyov, Dissident and Human Rights Commissioner, 1969–2003|last=Gilligan|first=Emma|date=2004|isbn=978-0415546119|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|31–32}} Publication of ''Chronicle of Current Events'' was suspended in the fall of 1972 and would not resume until 1974. As many contributors to the ''Chronicle'' were closely linked to or active in the [[Initiative Group for the Defense of Human Rights in the USSR|Initiative Group for Human Rights in the USSR]], the crackdown also lead to sentences for several members of the group.&lt;ref name="horvath-breaking2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Horvath|first=Robert|date=2014|title=Breaking the Totalitarian Ice: The Initiative Group for the Defense of Human Rights in the USSR|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/content/crossref/journals/human_rights_quarterly/v036/36.1.horvath.html|journal=Human Rights Quarterly|volume=36|issue=1|pages=147–175|doi=10.1353/hrq.2014.0013|issn=1085-794X|accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|169}}

=== Helsinki period (1975–1981) ===
In August 1975, during the [[Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (CSCE) in Helsinki, Finland, the eight member countries of the Warsaw Pact became co-signatories of the [[Helsinki Accords|Helsinki Final Act]] (Helsinki Accords). Despite efforts to exclude the clauses, the Soviet government ultimately accepted a text containing unprecedented commitments to human rights as part of diplomatic relations between the signatories.&lt;ref name="thomas-effect"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Princeton University Press| isbn = 9780691048598| last = Thomas| first = Daniel C.| title = The Helsinki Effect: International Norms, Human Rights, and the Demise of Communism| location = Princeton, N.J| year = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|117}}

Word on the contents of the Helsinki Final Acts began to spread through Western broadcasts by the [[BBC]] and [[Radio Liberty]]. Presented as a diplomatic triumph of the Soviet Union, the text of the document was also reprinted in ''[[Pravda]].''&lt;ref&gt;''Pravda'', Aug. 2, 1975, 2-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of particular interest for dissidents across the Soviet bloc was the "Third Basket" of the Final Act. According to it, the signatories had to "respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, including freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief." The signatories also confirmed "the right of the individual to know and act upon his rights and duties in this field."&lt;ref name="thomas-effect"/&gt;{{rp|99–100}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.osce.org/mc/39501?download=true|title = Helsinki Final Act, Section VII|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Founding of Helsinki watch groups ====
In the years 1976-77 members of the dissident movement formed several "Helsinki Watch Groups" in different cities to monitor the Soviet Union's compliance with the Helsinki Final Act:&lt;ref name="thomas-effect" /&gt;{{rp|159–166}}
* The [[Moscow Helsinki Group]] was founded in May 1976 by physicist [[Yuri Orlov]]. Despite severe repressions, it played a great role in East-West relations, revealing Soviet non-compliance with the Helsinki Final Act such as the continued [[Political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union|political abuse of psychiatry]].
* A special [[Working Commission to Investigate the Use of Psychiatry for Political Purposes|Working Commission on the Use of Psychiatry for Political Purposes]] was founded in January 1977 under the aegis of the Moscow Helsinki Group. It was advised by psychiatrists and jurists, and continued its work until its last member was arrested in 1981.
Following the example, other groups were formed:
* The [[Ukrainian Helsinki Group]] was founded in November 1976 to monitor [[human rights]] in the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]]. The group was active until 1981, when all members were jailed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.khpg.org.ua/en/index.php?id=1127288239 Museum of dissident movement in Ukraine]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Lithuanian Helsinki Group]] was founded in November 1976 to monitor human rights in the [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic|Lithuanian SSR]]. It ceased to exist in 1982 as a result of arrests, deaths, and emigration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.khpg.org/index.php?id=1163803346 Museum of dissident movement in Ukraine]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Girnius|first = Saulius|title = The Demise of the Lithuanian Helsinki Group|journal = Lithuanian Quarterly Journal of Arts and Sciences|date = Summer 1984|volume = 30|issue = 2|url = http://www.lituanus.org/1984_2/84_2_05.htm|accessdate = 30 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Georgian Helsinki Group was founded in January 1977 to monitor human rights in the [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic|Georgian SSR]]. It was active until the arrest and trial of several members of the group in 1977-1978. It was restarted in the spring of 1985 and eventually became the political party Georgian Helsinki Union, headed by [[Zviad Gamsakhurdia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.khpg.org/index.php?id=1163196899 Museum of dissident movement in Ukraine]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Armenian Helsinki Group was founded in April 1977. In addition to monitoring the observance of the [[Helsinki Accords]] in the [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Armenian SSR]], it intended to seek the Republic's acceptance as a member of the [[United Nations]] and the unification with Armenia of [[Nagorny Karabakh]] and [[Nakhichevanik]]. In December 1977 two members of the Group were arrested and its activity ceased.&lt;ref&gt;http://museum.khpg.org/eng/index.php?id=1163033553 Museum of dissident movement in Ukraine&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar initiatives began in Soviet [[satellite states]], such as the informal civic initiative [[Charter 77]] in the [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]] and the [[Workers' Defence Committee]], later Committee for Social Defense, in Poland.&lt;ref name="alexeyeva-dissent" /&gt;{{Rp|339}}

==== Impact and persecution of Helsinki watch groups ====
Materials provided by the Helsinki groups were used at the follow-up [[Belgrade]] conference on verification of the Helsinki accords on 4 October 1977. The conference became the first international meeting on a governmental level in which the Soviet Union was accused of human rights violations.&lt;ref name="alexeyeva-dissent"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Wesleyan University Press| isbn = 978-0-8195-6176-3| last = Alexeyeva| first = Lyudmila| others = Carol Pearce, John Glad (trans.)| title = Soviet Dissent: Contemporary Movements for National, Religious, and Human Rights| location = Middletown, Conn.| date = 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|344}} In January 1979, the [[Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe]] nominated the Helsinki Groups of the Soviet Union for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].&lt;ref name="ukr"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://ukrweekly.com/archive/pdf2/1979/The_Ukrainian_Weekly_1979-06.pdf |title=Congressional Group Renominates Helsinki Monitors for Nobel |journal=[[The Ukrainian Weekly]] |date=February 11, 1979 | volume=LXXXVI |issue=33 |issn=0273-9348}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977-1979 and again in 1980-1982, the KGB reacted to the Helsinki Watch Groups by launching large-scale arrests and sentencing its members to in prison, labor camp, internal exile and psychiatric imprisonment.

During the 1970s the Moscow and the Ukrainian Helsinki Groups managed to recruit new members after an initial wave of arrests. The Ukrainian group also had representatives abroad, with [[Leonid Plyushch]] in France and [[Nadiya Svitlychna]], [[Pyotr Grigorenko]] and Nina Strokata in the United States.

In the early 1980s, with the Soviet Union's international reputation damaged by the [[Soviet–Afghan War|invasion of Afghanistan]], persecution of dissidents and human rights activists intensified. This spelled the end of the groups that were still active at the time. By the early 1980s, the Moscow Helsinki Group was scattered in prisons, camps and exile.&lt;ref name="Shanker"&gt;{{cite news|author = Shanker, Thom|title = Bitter Siberian ordeal ends at last for Yuri Orlov|url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2457&amp;dat=19861001&amp;id=O6hJAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=LA4NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4764,4899670&amp;hl=com|work = [[Bangor Daily News]]|date = 1 October 1986|page = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the 74-year-old attorney [[Sofiya Kalistratova|Sofya Kalistratova]] was threatened with arrest in Moscow in 1982, the last remaining members of the Moscow group who had not been arrested announced the dissolution of the group.&lt;ref&gt;See Document 195, "O prekreaš enii raboty Moskovskoj gruppy Chel’sinki," reprinted in Dokumenty Moskovskoj Chel’sinkskoj gruppy, 1976-1982, eds.; G.

In the early 1980s, when 18 members of the Ukrainian group were incarcerated in the forced labor camp near Kuchino in the Urals alone, the Ukrainian group stated that its activities had been "displaced" to the camps.&lt;ref&gt;Vasyl Ovsijenko, "Pravozachysnyj ruch v Ukra ni (Seredyna 1950-ch – 1980-i roky), in Ukra ns‘ka Gromads‘ka Grupa spryjannja Hel‘sinks‘kych uhod, vol. 1, ed.&lt;br&gt;

=== Late Soviet Union (1980-1992) ===
In 1980, [[Andrei Sakharov]] was forcibly exiled from Moscow to the closed city of [[Gorky (city)|Gorky]] to live under [[KGB]] surveillance and to disrupt his contact with activists and foreign journalists. His wife [[Yelena Bonner]] was permitted to travel between Moscow and Gorky. With her help, Sakharov was able to send appeals and essays to the West until 1984 when she was also arrested and confined by court order to Gorky.

The death [[Anatoly Marchenko]], a founding member of the Moscow Helsinki Group, in prison after months on hunger strike in 1986 caused an international outcry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Human rights activism and the end of the Cold War: a transnational history of the Helsinki network|date=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107001053|series=Human Rights in History|location=New York|author=Snyder, Sarah}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|175}} It marked a turning point in the initial insistence of Mikhail Gorbachev that there were no political prisoners in the USSR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Protest, Reform and Repression in Khrushchev's Soviet Union |last=Hornsby |first=Rob |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-107-03092-3 |series=New studies in European history |location=Cambridge, U.K.; New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|75}}

In 1986, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], who had initiated the policies of [[perestroika]] and [[glasnost]], called Sakharov to tell him that he and his wife could return to Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zbA2dK9GQb8C&amp;pg=PA275&amp;dq=andrei+sakharov+december+19#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Perestroïka and Soviet national security|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|year=1991|isbn=978-0-8157-5553-1|page=275|author=[[Michael MccGwire]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s, with [[glasnost]] and [[perestroika]] underway, some of the Helsinki watch groups resumed their work. With the return of the first Ukrainian group members from the camps, they resumed their work for a democratic Ukraine in 1987. Their group later became the nucleus for a number of political parties and democratic initiatives. The Moscow Helsinki Group resumed its activities in 1989 and continues to operate today.

== Legal context ==
{{Broader|Human rights in the Soviet Union}}

=== Civil and human rights frameworks ===
The emerging civil rights movement of the mid-1960s turned its attention to the guarantees enshrined in the Soviet constitution:
*[[1936 Soviet Constitution]], in force until 1977
*[[1977 Soviet Constitution]], in force until the dissolution of the Soviet Union
*1961 RSFSR Code of Criminal Procedure
The human rights movement from the 1970s turned its attention to international agreements:
* 1948 [[United Nations|U.N.]] [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]{{refn|group="nb"|The USSR and other countries of the [[Soviet bloc]] had abstained from voting on the 1948 U.N. [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], citing its "overly juridical" character as well as the infringements on national sovereignty that it might enable.&lt;ref name="thomas-effect" /&gt;{{rp|167f.}} The USSR and some of its allies did, however, sign the 1966 [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] and the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]].}}
* 1975 [[Helsinki Accords|Helsinki Final Act]], and its "Third Basket" containing human rights clauses, signed by the USSR
Existing human rights guarantees were neither well-known to people living under Communist rule nor taken seriously by the Communist authorities. In addition, Western governments did not emphasize human rights ideas in the early [[détente]] period.&lt;ref name="thomas-hrideas"&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 7| issue = 2| pages = 110–141| last = Thomas| first = Daniel C.| title = Human Rights Ideas, the Demise of Communism, and the End of the Cold War| journal = Journal of Cold War Studies| year = 2005| url = http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/cws/summary/v007/7.2thomas.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|117}}

=== Persecution ===
While the authors of the samizdat bulletin ''[[Chronicle of Current Events]]'' and the members of the various human rights groups maintained that their activity was not illegal, several articles of the RSFSR Criminal Code were routinely used against activists in the movement:&lt;ref name="gerlant-language"&gt;{{Cite book|publisher = |isbn = 978-3-9810631-9-6|pages = 142–154|last = Gerlant|first = Uta|title = Human Rights And History: A Challenge for Education|chapter = "The Law is Our Only Language": Soviet Dissidents and Human Rights|location = Berlin|date = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|139}}
* Article 70 – [[anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda]] – punished the creation and circulation of "slanderous fabrications that target the Soviet political and social system". Its penalty was up to 7 years of imprisonment followed by up to 5 years of internal exile.
* Article 72 introduced the capital offense of "organizational activity directed to the commission of especially dangerous crimes against the state and also participation in an anti-Soviet organization" 
* Article 227 punished creation or participation in a religious group that "induces citizens to refuse social activity or performance of civic duties".&lt;ref name=berman-codes&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Harvard U.P.| isbn = 978-0-674-82636-6| last = Berman| first = Harold J| title = Soviet Criminal Law and Procedure: The RSFSR Codes| location = Cambridge, Mass.| date = 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|73}}

Two articles were added to the Criminal Code in September 1966 in the wake of the [[Sinyavsky–Daniel trial|Sinyasky-Daniel trial]]:&lt;ref name="simons-code"&gt;{{cite book|last = Simons|first = William B.|title = The Soviet Codes of Law|year = 1984|publisher = BRILL|location = The Hague|isbn = 978-9028608108}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|126}}
* Article 190-1 punished "systematic dissemination of deliberately false statements derogatory to the Soviet state and social system"
* Article 190-3 punished "group activities involving a grave breach of public order, or disobedience to the legitimate demands of representatives of authority"

Another article was introduced in October 1983:
* Article 188-3 allowed the state to extend the terms of convicts, facilitating the ongoing persecution of political prisoners&lt;ref name="gerlant-language"/&gt;{{rp|139}}
Prior to 1960 and the introduction of the new RSFSR Criminal Article 58 described the capital offense of knowingly or unknowingly participating in an organization deemed "counter-revolutionary". It was not retained after 1960, but it was used to prosecute and imprison several older rights activists (for instance, [[Vladimir Gershuni]]) in the Stalin and Khrushchev years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Седьмая серия.

'''Improvement''' is the process of a thing moving from one state to a state considered to be better, usually through some action intended to bring about that better state. The concept of improvement is important to governments and businesses, as well as to individuals.

==History of the concept==
The term "improvement" in general means "gradual, piecemeal, but cumulative betterment", which can refer to both individuals and societies as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Slack, The Invention of Improvement: Information &amp; Material Progress in Seventeenth-Century England (2015), p.1&lt;/ref&gt; The term "improvement" historically referred to [[land improvement]], the process of making wild land more suitable for human uses, particularly the cultivation of crops.&lt;ref name="Houston"&gt;Alan Craig Houston, ''Benjamin Franklin and the Politics of Improvement'' (2008), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Agricultural writers contrasted "improvement" with the traditional custom that governed farming practices at the time. The belief in agricultural "improvement" was the belief that the earth could be made more fruitful. More specifically, it was the belief that "the knowledge of nature would allow the best possible use of resources".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Drayton, ''Nature’s Government: Science, Imperial Britain and the ‘Improvement' of the World'' (2000), p.xv&lt;/ref&gt; It emerged in late medieval England and later shaped the colonies of the British Empire, through what Richard Drayton describes as "enlightened imperialism". The British believed "that they ultimately knew better than those on the ground".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Drayton, Nature’s Government: Science, Imperial Britain and the ‘Improvement' of the World (2000), p.90&lt;/ref&gt;

This limited agricultural use of the term changed in the 17th century, when "its metaphoric range was extended to include a host of social and political reforms aimed at growth, development, or perfection".&lt;ref name="Houston"/&gt; In short order, the term "improvement" became "nothing less than shorthand for the civilizing process",&lt;ref name="Houston"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Andrew D. Lambert, ''The Gates of Hell: Sir John Franklin's Tragic Quest for the North West Passage'' (2014), p. 136: "The Enlightenment concept of improvement as applied to the land was seen as a civilising mission".&lt;/ref&gt; and thereafter "played an important role in eighteenth- century European debates over the foundations of social order".&lt;ref name="Houston"/&gt; [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] criticized this concept of "improvement" in his notes published in ''[[The Will to Power (manuscript)|The Will to Power]]'', asserting that it created a false and self-serving sense of human superiority over nature, and that the "civilizing" of man was actually a "softening".&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich Nietzsche]], ''[[The Will to Power (manuscript)|The Will to Power]]'' (2011 ed.), p. 91, 212.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, the concept of improvement expanded even further. Businesses developed philosophies of having a [[continual improvement process]], wherein all activities of the business are constantly examined to weed out inefficiencies and better ways of carrying out tasks. At the same time, the concept of individual [[self-improvement]] blossomed, leading to "tremendous growth in self-help publishing [and] self-improvement culture",&lt;ref&gt;Micki McGee. ''Self-Help, Inc.: Makeover culture in American Life'' (Oxford 2005) p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; wherein people assessed their lives in much the same way. [[Home improvement]], the process or result of improving the efficiency, livability, or market value of a personal dwelling, has also become a substantial industry.

Sarah Tarlow, a Professor of Archaeology, has argued that the idea of “improvement” is so familiar to us today that it seems natural. It is therefore difficult to fully understand the history of “improvement” as a concept, and to appreciate that it was a genuinely new way of thinking in the early modern period. Furthermore, in contemporary use the notion of “improvement” is assumed to be positive. This assumption has limited the critical attention given to the history of the idea and the practices associated with it. For example, the [[enclosure]] of common land for private use was understood as an “improvement” in the eighteenth century. But this had both positive and negative effects for the different people involved. The poor family who were denied a crucial means of subsistence did not regard the newly enclosed fields as “better”.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Tarlow, The Archeology of Improvement in Britain, 1750-1850 (2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===In business===
Many theories and practices exist with respect to improvement in business.  For example, business process improvement is a systematic approach to help an organization optimize its underlying processes to achieve more efficient results. One such approach is [[focused improvement]], the ensemble of activities aimed at elevating the performance of any system, especially a business system, by working on eliminating its constraints one by one while ''not'' working on non-constraints. [[Performance improvement]] focuses on measuring the output of a particular [[business process]] or procedure, then modifying the process or procedure to increase the output, increase [[efficiency (economics)|efficiency]], or increase the effectiveness of the process or procedure. Quality improvement is one of the four aspects of the concept of [[quality management]]. A crucial component of professional development is evaluation. Recently, we have seen a push for evaluation systems to be used to sort and fire teachers—a supposed quick fix, but one that ignores the vast majority of dedicated educators. To be effective, an evaluation system must identify strengths and weaknesses, so that all teachers can get the necessary support to improve their practice.

===In government===
Governments often use language proposing improvement of processes or areas. In some places a [[business improvement district]] or [[tourism improvement district]] may be incorporated into [[urban area|urban]] [[zoning]], with the enactment of laws intended to benefit businesses that are established in the area. An [[improvement trust]], a type of [[Trust law|legal trust]] created for the improvement of something, may be settled for the benefit of a municipal area.

The '''International Alliance of Women''' ('''IAW'''; {{lang-fr|Alliance Internationale des Femmes}}, AIF) is an [[International nongovernmental organization|international non-governmental]] organization that works to promote women's [[human rights]] around the world, focusing particularly on [[empowerment]] of women and [[international development|development issues]] and more broadly on [[gender equality]]. The basic principle of the IAW is that the full and equal enjoyment of [[human rights]] is due to all women and girls. It is one of the oldest, largest and most influential organizations in its field. The organization was founded as '''International Woman Suffrage Alliance''' (IWSA) in 1904 in [[Berlin]] by [[Marie Stritt]], [[Millicent Fawcett]], [[Carrie Chapman Catt]], [[Susan B. Anthony]] and other leading feminists from around the world to campaign for [[women's suffrage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Woman Suffrage News  (Centenary edition)|url=http://womenalliance.org/old/pdf/IAWCentenaryEdition19042004webversion.pdf|website=Women Alliance}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IWSA was headquartered in [[London]], and it was the preeminent international women's suffrage organization. Its emphasis has since shifted to a broad human rights focus. Today it represents over 50 organizations world-wide comprising several hundred thousand members, and has its seat in [[Geneva]]. 

From 1926, the organization had strong ties to the [[League of Nations]]. Since 1947, the IAW has had [[general consultative status]] to the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]], the highest UN status possible for a non-governmental organization, the [[List of organizations with consultative status to the United Nations Economic and Social Council|4th organization to be granted this status]]. The IAW also has participatory status with the [[Council of Europe]]. It has representatives at the [[United Nations Headquarters|UN headquarters]] in [[New York City|New York]], the [[United Nations Office at Geneva|UN office]] in [[Geneva]], the [[United Nations Office at Vienna|UN office]] in [[Vienna]], [[UNESCO]] in [[Paris]], the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] in [[Rome]] and the [[Council of Europe]] in [[Strasbourg]]. It also has representatives to the [[Arab League]] in [[Cairo]] and the [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf|Gulf Countries Council]] in [[Riyadh]], and is an influential member of the [[European Women's Lobby]] in [[Brussels]]. Its President and Chief Representative to the United Nations is [[Joanna Manganara]]. Its current main UN representative in New York [[Soon-Young Yoon]] is also chair of the [[NGO Committee on the Status of Women, New York]] and First Vice-President of the [[Conference of NGOs]]. IAW's official working languages are English and French.

==History==
[[File:Marie Stritt.jpg|thumb|Co-founder [[Marie Stritt]], German feminist (1855–1928)]]
[[File:Millicent Fawcett.jpg|thumb|Co-founder and Vice President, Dame [[Millicent Fawcett]]]]
The decision for the establishment of the organization was taken in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] in 1902 by suffragists frustrated at the reluctance of the [[International Council of Women]] to support women's suffrage.{{sfn|Liddington|1989|p=37}} The Alliance was formally constituted during the [[Second Conference of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance|2nd]]in [[Berlin]] in 1904 as the International Woman Suffrage Alliance (IWSA), and was headquartered in [[London]] for much of its history.{{sfn|Liddington|1989|p=56}} Its founders included [[Carrie Chapman Catt]], [[Millicent Fawcett]], [[Helene Lange]], [[Susan B. Anthony]], [[Anita Augspurg]], [[Rachel Foster Avery]], and [[Käthe Schirmacher]].

Amongst subsequent congresses were those held in [[Copenhagen]] (1906), [[Amsterdam]] (1908), [[London]] (1909), [[Stockholm]] (June 1911), and [[Budapest]] (1913).{{sfn|Liddington|1989|p=63}} The [[French Union for Women's Suffrage]] (UFSF), founded in February 1909. was formally recognized by the IWFA congress in London in April 1909 as representing the French suffrage movement.{{sfn|Hause|2002}} The IWSA also started its own monthly journal, the ''Jus Suffragii''. The IWSA, influenced by [[Millicent Fawcett]] against the militancy of suffragettes in the style of [[Emmeline Pankhurst]], initially refused membership to the [[WSPU]] at their 1906 Copenhagen meeting.{{sfn|Liddington|1989|p=63}}

In the late 1920s the organization changed its name to the '''International Alliance of Women for Suffrage and Equal Citizenship''', and in 1946 this was altered to its current name, International Alliance of Women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://asteria.fivecolleges.edu/findaids/sophiasmith/mnsss330.html The International Alliance of Women Records, 1906-2004]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Boles|Hoeveler|2004|p=21}}
The first Executive Board included [[Carrie Chapman Catt]] (President), [[Anita Augspurg]] (1st Vice President), [[Donovan Bolden]] (2nd Vice President) and [[Rachel Foster Avery]] (Secretary).

The organization's first President Carrie Chapman Catt also founded the [[League of Women Voters]] in the United States during her presidency.

The organization's traditional colour, used to symbolize women's rights and women's suffrage, is yellow.{{sfn|Lumsden|1997|p=162}}

[[File:Robert-michels.jpg|thumb|right|[[Robert Michels]], the [[sociology|sociologist]] who devised the Iron Law of Oligarchy]]
The '''iron law of oligarchy''' is a political theory, first developed by the German [[sociology|sociologist]] [[Robert Michels]] in his 1911 book, ''[[Political Parties (book)|Political Parties]]''.&lt;ref name="Hyland"&gt;James L. Hyland. ''Democratic theory: the philosophical foundations''. Manchester, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: [[Manchester University]] Press ND, 1995. p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; It asserts that rule by an elite, or [[oligarchy]], is inevitable as an "iron law" within any democratic organization as part of the "tactical and technical necessities" of organization.&lt;ref name="Hyland" /&gt;

Michels's theory states that all complex organizations, regardless of how democratic they are when started, eventually develop into oligarchies. Michels observed that since no sufficiently large and complex organization can function purely as a direct democracy, power within an organization will always get delegated to individuals within that group, elected or otherwise.

Using anecdotes from political parties and trade unions struggling to operate democratically to build his argument in 1911, Michels addressed the application of this law to representative democracy, and stated: "Who says organization, says oligarchy."&lt;ref name="Hyland" /&gt; He went on to state that "Historical evolution mocks all the prophylactic measures that have been adopted for the prevention of oligarchy."&lt;ref name="Hyland" /&gt;

According to Michels all organizations eventually come to be run by a "leadership class", who often function as paid administrators, executives, spokespersons or political strategists for the organization.  Far from being "servants of the masses", Michels argues this "leadership class," rather than the organization's membership, will inevitably grow to dominate the organization's [[power structure]]s.   By controlling who has access to information, those in power can centralize their power successfully, often with little accountability, due to the apathy, indifference and non-participation most rank-and-file members have in relation to their organization's decision-making processes.   Michels argues that democratic attempts to hold leadership positions [[accountability|accountable]] are prone to fail, since with power comes the ability to reward [[loyalty]], the ability to control information about the organization, and the ability to control what procedures the organization follows when making decisions.   All of these mechanisms can be used to strongly influence the outcome of any decisions made 'democratically' by members.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Michels, Political Parties: A Sociological Study of the Oligarchical Tendencies of Modern Democracy,
1915, trans. Eden and Cedar Paul (Kitchener, Ontario: Batoche Books, 2001), 241, http://socserv2.socsci.mcmaster.ca/~econ/ugcm/3ll3/michels/polipart.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

Michels stated that the official goal of representative democracy of eliminating elite rule was impossible, that representative democracy is a [[façade]] legitimizing the rule of a particular elite, and that elite rule, which he refers to as oligarchy, is inevitable.&lt;ref name="Hyland" /&gt; Later Michels migrated to Italy and joined [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[National Fascist Party|Fascist Party]], as he believed this was the next legitimate step of modern societies. The thesis became popular once more in post-war America with the publication of ''[[Union Democracy: The Internal Politics of the International Typographical Union]]'' (1956) and during the [[red scare]] brought about by [[McCarthyism]].

==History==

In 1911 Robert Michels argued that [[paradox]]ically the socialist parties of Europe, despite their democratic ideology and provisions for mass participation, seemed to be dominated by their leaders just like traditional [[Conservatism|conservative]] parties. Michels' conclusion was that the problem lay in the very nature of organizations. The more [[Liberalism|liberal]] and democratic modern era allowed the formation of organizations with innovative and revolutionary goals, but as such organizations become more complex, they became less and less democratic and revolutionary. Michels formulated the "Iron Law of Oligarchy": "Who says organization, says oligarchy."&lt;ref name="leach"/&gt;

At the time Michels formulated his Law, he was an [[anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalist]].&lt;ref name="leach"/&gt; He later became an important ideologue of [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[fascism|fascist]] regime in [[Italy]], teaching economics at the [[University of Perugia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Organisation and bureaucracy: an analysis of modern theories|author=Nicos P. Mouzelis|publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=1968|isbn=978-0-202-30078-8|page=29|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TC80YVizWWMC&amp;pg=PA29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reigniting the labor movement: restoring means to ends in a democratic labor movement|author=Gerald Friedman|authorlink=Gerald Friedman (economist)|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-415-77071-2|page=53|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gzJFVDIHZksC&amp;pg=PA53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons==
Michels stressed several factors that underlie the Iron Law of Oligarchy. Darcy K. Leach summarized them briefly as: "Bureaucracy happens. If bureaucracy happens, power rises. Power corrupts."&lt;ref name="leach"/&gt; Any large organization, Michels pointed out, has to create a [[bureaucracy]] in order to maintain its efficiency as it becomes larger—many decisions have to be made daily that cannot be made by large numbers of disorganized people. For the organization to function effectively, centralization has to occur and power will end up in the hands of a few. Those few—the oligarchy—will use all means necessary to preserve and further increase their power.&lt;ref name="leach"/&gt;

According to Michels, this process is further compounded as delegation is necessary in any large organization, as thousands—sometimes hundreds of thousands—of members cannot make decisions via [[participatory democracy]]. This has to-date been dictated by the lack of [[technology|technological means]] for large numbers of people to meet and debate, and also by matters related to [[crowd psychology]], as Michels argued that people feel a need to be led. Delegation, however, leads to specialization—to the development of knowledge bases, skills and resources among a leadership—which further alienates the leadership from the rank and file and entrenches the leadership in office.

Bureaucratization and [[Departmentalization|specialization]] are the driving processes behind the Iron Law. They result in the rise of a group of professional administrators in a [[hierarchical organization]], which in turn leads to the [[Rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]] and [[Routinization of charisma|routinization]] of [[authority]] and [[decision-making]], a process described first and perhaps best by [[Max Weber]], later by [[John Kenneth Galbraith]], and to a lesser and more cynical extent by the [[Peter principle|Peter Principle]].

Bureaucracy by design leads to centralization of power by the leaders. Leaders also have control over sanctions and rewards. They tend to promote those who share their opinions, which inevitably leads to self-perpetuating oligarchy. People achieve leadership positions because they have above-average political skill (see ''[[charismatic authority]]''). As they advance in their careers, their power and prestige increases. Leaders control the information that flows down the channels of communication, censoring what they do not want the rank-and-file to know. Leaders will also dedicate significant resources to persuade the rank-and-file of the rightness of their views. This is compatible with most societies: people are taught to obey those in positions of authority. Therefore, the rank and file show little initiative, and wait for the leaders to exercise their judgment and issue directives to follow.

==Implications==
The "iron law of oligarchy" states that all forms of organization, regardless of how democratic they may be at the start, will eventually and inevitably develop [[oligarchy|oligarchic]] tendencies, thus making true democracy practically and theoretically impossible, especially in large groups and complex organizations. The relative structural fluidity in a small-scale democracy succumbs to "social viscosity" in a large-scale organization. According to the "iron law," democracy and large-scale organization are incompatible.

==Examples and exceptions==
An example that Michels used in his book was [[Germany]]'s [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]].&lt;ref name="leach"&gt;Darcy K. Leach, ''The Iron Law of ''What'' Again? Conceptualizing Oligarchy Across Organizational Forms'', Sociological Theory, Volume 23, Number 3, September 2005, pp. 312-337(26). [http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/bpl/soth/2005/00000023/00000003/art00004 IngentaConnect]&lt;/ref&gt;

The size and complexity of a group or organization is important to the Iron Law as well. During the 1970s and early 1980s, the [[Green Party of Germany]] made a conscious effort to break the Iron Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redpepper.org.uk/Aug2003/x-Aug2003-greens.html |title=Whatever happened to the German Greens? |publisher=Red Pepper |date=2014-06-26 |accessdate=2014-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anyone could be or could remove a party official. There were no permanent offices or officers. Even the smallest, most routine decisions could be put up for discussion and to a vote. When the party was small, these anti-oligarchic measures enjoyed some success. But as the organization grew larger and the party became more successful, the need to effectively compete in elections, raise funds, run large rallies and demonstrations and work with other political parties once elected, led the Greens to adopt more conventional structures and practices.

===Labour Unions and Lipset's Union Democracy===
One of the best known exceptions to the iron law of oligarchy was the now defunct [[International Typographical Union]], described by [[Seymour Martin Lipset]] in his 1956 book, ''[[Union Democracy]]''.&lt;ref name="Lipset"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1988/A1988N212600001.pdf |title=Citation Classics Commentary on Union Democracy }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(254&amp;nbsp;KB)}}, Seymour Martin Lipset, 20/1988. Last accessed on 16 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Lipset suggests a number of factors that existed in the ITU that are allegedly responsible for countering this tendency toward bureaucratic oligarchy. The first and perhaps most important has to do with the way the union was founded. Unlike many other unions (e.g., the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations|CIO]]'s [[United Steel Workers of America]] (USWA), and numerous other craft unions) which were organized from the top down, the ITU had a number of large, strong, local unions who valued their [[autonomy]], which existed long before the international was formed. This local autonomy was strengthened by the economy of the printing industry which operated in largely local and regional markets, with little competition from other geographical areas. Large locals continued to jealously guard this autonomy against encroachments by international officers. Second, the existence of factions helped place a check on the oligarchic tendencies that existed at the national headquarters. Leaders that are unchecked tend to develop larger salaries and more sumptuous lifestyles, making them unwilling to go back to their previous jobs. But with a powerful out faction ready to expose profligacy, no leaders dared take overly generous personal remuneration. These two factors were compelling in the ITU case.

Lipset and his collaborators also cite a number of other factors which are specific to craft unions in general and the printing crafts in particular, including the homogeneity of the membership, with respect to their work and lifestyles, their identification with their craft, their more middle class lifestyle and pay. For this latter point he draws upon [[Aristotle]] who argued that a democratic polity was most likely where there was a large, stable middle class, and the extremes of wealth and poverty were not great. Finally, the authors note the irregular work hours which led shopmates to spend more of their leisure time together. These latter factors are less persuasive, since they do not apply to many industrial forms of organization, where the greatest amount of trade union democracy has developed in recent times.

===University Student Unions===

Titus Gregory uses Michels "iron law" to describe how the [[democratic centralist]] structure of the [[Canadian Federation of Students]], consisting of individual student unions, encourages oligarchy.

Titus Gregory argues that University [[Students' union]] today "exhibit both oligarchical and democratic tendencies."  Unlike unions they have an ideologically diverse membership, and frequently have competitive democratic elections covered by independent campus media who guard their independence.  These factors are strongly democratizing influences, creating conditions similar to those described by Lipset about the ITU.  However, Gregory argues student unions can also be highly undemocratic and oligarchical as a result of the transient membership of the students involved.  Every year between one quarter and one half of the membership turns over, and Gregory argues this creates a situation where elected student leaders become dependent on student union staff for institutional memory and guidance.  Since many students' unions extract compulsory fees from their transient membership, and many smaller colleges and/or commuter campus can extract this money with little accountability, oligarchical behaviour becomes encouraged. For example, Gregory points out how often student union election rules "operate under tyrannical rules and regulations" that are used frequently by those in power to disqualify or exclude would-be election challengers.  Gregory concludes that students' unions can "resist the iron law of oligarchy" if they have "an engaged student community", an "independent student media," a "strong tradition of freedom of information," and an "unbiased elections authority" capable of administrating elections fairly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studentunion.ca/solidarity-paper.pdf |title=Solidarity for their Own Good |date=March 2010 |accessdate=2015-08-27 |page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wikipedia ===

Research by Bradi Heaberlin and Simon DeDeo has found that the evolution of [[Wikipedia]]'s network of norms over time is consistent with the iron law of oligarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heaberlin|first=Bradi|last2=DeDeo|first2=Simon|date=2016-04-20|title=The Evolution of Wikipedia's Norm Network|url=http://www.mdpi.com/1999-5903/8/2/14|journal=Future Internet|language=en|volume=8|issue=2|pages=14|doi=10.3390/fi8020014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their quantitative analysis is based on data-mining over a decade of article and user information.  It shows the emergence of an oligarchy derived from competencies in five significant "clusters": administration, article quality, collaboration, formatting, and content policy.  Heaberlin and DeDeo note, "The encyclopedia’s core norms address universal principles, such as neutrality, verifiability, civility, and consensus. The ambiguity and interpretability of these abstract concepts may drive them to decouple from each other over time."

==Other==
The Iron Law of Oligarchy is similar to the concept in ''[[The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism]]'', a [[fictional book]] in the [[dystopia]]n novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' (1949) by [[George Orwell]]. The book begins:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Orwell|first1=George|title=1984|url=https://fadedpage.com/books/20120511/html.php}}, Part Two, Chapter IX&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|Throughout recorded time, and probably since the end of the [[Neolithic Age]], there have been three kinds of people in the world, the High, the Middle, and the Low. They have been subdivided in many ways, they have borne countless different names, and their relative numbers, as well as their attitude towards one another, have varied from age to age: but the essential structure of society has never altered. Even after enormous upheavals and seemingly irrevocable changes, the same pattern has always reasserted itself, just as a gyroscope will always return to equilibrium, however far it is pushed one way or the other.}}

The {{nihongo|'''Japan Labour-Farmer Party'''|日本労農党|Nihonrōnōtō}} was a [[socialism|socialist]] [[political party]] in [[Japan]] between December 1926 and December 1928. During its existence, it occupied a centrist position in the divided socialist movement.

==Foundation==
The Japan Labour-Farmer Party was one of several [[proletariat|proletarian]] parties that existed in Japan in the late 1920s.&lt;ref name="sca"&gt;[[Scalapino, Robert A.]] 
''[https://books.google.com/books?id=WrjFsd9S_qIC The Japanese Communist Movement, 1920–1966]''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1967. pp. 24, 33&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in [[Tokyo]] on December 9, 1926, as a split from the [[Social Democratic Party (Japan, 1926)|Social Democratic Party]] (the founding occurred just four days after the founding of the Social Democratic Party).&lt;ref name="beck"/&gt;&lt;ref name="orga"&gt;Large, Stephen S. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Zog8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA108 Organized Workers and Socialist Politics in Interwar Japan]''. Cambridge [Cambridgeshire]: Cambridge University Press, 1981. p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; The split had both personal and ideological dimensions. Amongst the founders of the Japan Labour-Farmer Party were [[Asanuma Inejirō]] and his followers in the Japan Peasant Union and leftwing socialist intellectuals such as Asō Hisashi, Kono Mitsu, [[Suzuki Mosaburō]], Tanahashi Kotora and Kato Kanju.&lt;ref name="beck"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garon, Sheldon. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=9AzS5nvdvX4C&amp;pg=PA118 The State and Labor in Modern Japan]''. United States: U CALIF BERKELEY PR (CA/NJ), 1987. p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Large, Stephen S. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=JD1iyqWwHQcC&amp;pg=PA123 Shōwa Japan: Political, Economic and Social History, 1926–1989]''. Vol. 2, 1941–1952. Routledge library of modern Japan. London: Routledge, 1998. p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Henry DeWitt. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=9IDU-yYcXboC&amp;pg=PA252 Japan's First Student Radicals]''. Harvard East Asian series, 70. 1972. p. 252&lt;/ref&gt; Asō Hisashi became chairman of the party, whilst Miwa Jusō became its general secretary.&lt;ref name="orga"/&gt;

==Political outlook==
In terms of its programme, the party differed little from the [[Labour-Farmer Party]] (which, although having non-Communists amongst the ranks, was essentially controlled by the [[Japanese Communist Party]]). In fact several members of the Japan Labour-Farmer Party were former communists themselves (such as Kondo Eizo, the founder of the [[Enlightened People's Communist Party]]). However, in practice there was a clear political demarcation between the Japan Labour-Farmer Party and the Labour-Farmer Party.&lt;ref name="sca"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Scalapino, Robert A.]] ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=X9Wi2SI30uQC&amp;pg=PA332 Democracy and the party movement in prewar japan: the failure of the first attempt]''. Berkeley u.a: University of California Press, 1975. p. 332&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beckmann, George M., and Genji Okubo. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8IarAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA372 The Japanese Communist Party 1922–1945]''. Stanford, Calif: Stanford University Press, 1969. pp. 34, 49, 372&lt;/ref&gt; The Japan Labour-Farmer Party occupied a centrist position in the Japanese left at the time, between the Japanese Communist Party and the Labour-Farmer Party on the left and the Social Democratic Party on its right. The party sought to mobilize the [[working class]] masses in legal struggles.&lt;ref name="sca"/&gt;&lt;ref name="beck"&gt;Beckmann, George M., and Genji Okubo. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8IarAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA102 The Japanese Communist Party 1922–1945]''. Stanford, Calif: Stanford University Press, 1969. pp. 102–104&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cons"&gt;Hunter, Janet. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=1MyP6i06z-4C&amp;pg=PA79 Concise Dictionary of Modern Japanese History]''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984. p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; The party opposed Japanese intervention in [[China]].&lt;ref name="cons"/&gt;

==Polemics with other socialist parties==
Whilst the leadership of the Japan Labour-Farmer Party rejected links to the [[Communist International]], they did identify themselves as revolutionary [[Marxists]]. The party stated that it had adopted the "correct line in the proletarian movement". In their discourse, the leftwing of the socialist movement suffered from an "[["Left-Wing" Communism: An Infantile Disorder|infantile disorder]]" whilst the rightwing was "senile". However, the party was also criticized from its two flanks, the left characterizing it as "[[petty bourgeois]]" and the right claiming that the party was used by the communists.&lt;ref name="beck"/&gt; There were also some other, regional, proletarian parties, which also found themselves having centrist positions like the Japan Labour-Farmer Party.&lt;ref name="cole"&gt;Colegrove, Kenneth. ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1945218 Labor Parties in Japan]'', in ''The American Political Science Review'', Vol. 23, No. 2 (May, 1929), pp. 329–363&lt;/ref&gt;

In its 1927 thesis the Communist Party stated that the role of the Japan Labour-Farmer Party was particularly "treacherous", and that the Japan Labour-Farmer Party differentiated itself from the right-wing Social Democrats merely by utilizing a fake leftist discourse.&lt;ref name="beck1927"&gt;Beckmann, George M., and Genji Okubo. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8IarAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA304 The Japanese Communist Party 1922–1945]''. Stanford, Calif: Stanford University Press, 1969. p. 304&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928, however, the Communist Party adopted a position to work for the unification of the Japan Labour-Farmer Party and the Labour-Farmer Party. The Communist Party directed cadres to work within the Japan Labour-Farmer Party. In practice, however, they could not establish any foothold inside the party like they had in the Labour-Farmer Party.&lt;ref&gt;Beckmann, George M., and Genji Okubo. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8IarAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA143 The Japanese Communist Party 1922–1945]''. Stanford, Calif: Stanford University Press, 1969. pp. 143, 150&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mass organizations of the party==
The 1926 split in the Social Democratic Party was followed by a split in the ''[[Sodomei]]'' [[trade union]] centre. The leaders of the Japan Labour-Farmer Party were asked to resign from their leadership positions in ''Sodomei'', as they refused they were expelled from the organization. The Japan Labour-Farmer Party regrouped their followers in the labour movement and formed a new trade union centre of their own, the [[Japan Labour Union League]].&lt;ref name="beck"/&gt; In February 1927, farmers sympathizing with the party broke away from the Social Democratic Party-led [[General Federation of Japanese Peasant Unions]], and formed the All-Japan Peasant Union as the agrarian wing of the Japan Labour-Farmer Party.&lt;ref name="ten"&gt;Wakukawa, Seiyei. ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3022364 Japanese Tenant Movements]'', in ''Far Eastern Survey'', Vol. 15, No. 3 (Feb. 13, 1946), pp. 40–44&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1927, a women's organization connection to the party was formed, the National Women's League.&lt;ref&gt;Mackie, Vera C. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=rQzmUjiWedMC&amp;pg=PA138 Creating Socialist Women in Japan: Gender, Labour and Activism, 1900–1937]''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002. p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

==1927 and 1928 elections==
According to a 1927 Communist Party document, the party was estimated to have around 6,000 members.&lt;ref name="beck1927"/&gt; The party won three seats in the [[Prefectures of Japan|prefectural elections]] in October 1927.&lt;ref name="cole"/&gt;&lt;ref name="orga2"&gt;Large, Stephen S. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Zog8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA124 Organized Workers and Socialist Politics in Interwar Japan]''. Cambridge [Cambridgeshire]: Cambridge University Press, 1981. pp. 124–125&lt;/ref&gt; In total it had presented 32 candidates, whom together got 34,718 votes.&lt;ref&gt;Banno, Junji. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=NTG3Kmy9-KQC&amp;pg=PA238 The Political Economy of Japanese Society]''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997. p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahead of the [[Japanese general election, 1928|1928 national Diet elections]] the Japan Labour-Farmer Party proposed various far-reaching reforms, such as scrapping military education for students and introducing government regulations on food prices. The election was characterized by fierce confrontations not only between the governing side and the opposition, but also between the different proletarian parties.&lt;ref name="cole"/&gt; Moreover, the proletarian parties lacked well-known candidates and the financial resources of the established politicians. Bribery and coercion was common in several constituencies. In [[Ashio, Tochigi|Ashio]], where the Japan Labour-Farmer Party leader Asō Hisashi stood as a candidate, police used to break up electoral meetings of the party and the [[Ashio Copper Mine|local mining company]] contributed financially to the campaigns of Asō Hisashi's opponents.&lt;ref name="orga2"/&gt;

The party supported 14 candidates in the elections, whom together mustered 93,400 votes (0.9% of the nationwide vote). One of its candidates got elected.&lt;ref&gt;Beckmann, George M., and Genji Okubo. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8IarAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA151 The Japanese Communist Party 1922–1945]''. Stanford, Calif: Stanford University Press, 1969. p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Colegrove, Kenneth. ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1945477 The Japanese General Election of 1928]'', in ''The American Political Science Review'', Vol. 22, No. 2 (May, 1928), pp. 401–407&lt;/ref&gt; (Banno, however, states that the party had 13 candidates, with a combined vote of 86,698 votes, out of whom one was elected.)&lt;ref name="banno"&gt;Banno, Junji. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=NTG3Kmy9-KQC&amp;pg=PA240 The Political Economy of Japanese Society]''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997. p. 240&lt;/ref&gt; The sole winner of a [[Diet (Japan)|parliamentary seat]] of the Japan Labour-Farmer Party was Kawakami Jōtarō, a lawyer from [[Kobe]].&lt;ref name="orga2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stockwin, J. A. A. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=OElxkdTcuCAC&amp;pg=PA136 Dictionary of the Modern Politics of Japan]''. Routledge in Asia. London: RoutledgeCurzon, 2003. p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; The overwhelming majority of the votes for the party in these elections had come from urban areas (where most of its candidates had been launched).&lt;ref name="banno"/&gt;

Following the election the three proletarian parties in the assembly (the Japan Labour-Farmer Party, Labour-Farmer Party and the Social Democratic Party) managed to form a joint parliamentary committee, in spite of their political contradictions. The committee did however not last, as the government banned the Labour-Farmer Party. The Japan Labour-Farmer Party wanted the joint committee to protest against the ban, whilst the Social Democratic Party did not want neither to protest against the ban nor retain any contacts with the Labour-Farmer Party after the ban had been issued.&lt;ref name="cole"/&gt;

==Merger into the Japan Masses Party==
In December 1928 the party merged with the [[Proletarian Masses Party]], the [[Japan Farmers Party (1926–28)|Japan Farmers Party]] and four regional political parties, forming the [[Japan Masses Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Beckmann, George M., and Genji Okubo.

'''Jean-Michel Cousteau''' (born 6 May 1938) is a [[France|French]] oceanographic explorer, [[environmentalist]], educator, and film producer. The first son of ocean explorer [[Jacques Cousteau]], he is the father of [[Fabien Cousteau]] and [[Céline Cousteau]].

==Life and career==
Cousteau is the son of [[Jacques-Yves Cousteau]] and [[Simone Melchior]]. Cousteau first dived with an [[aqua-lung]] in 1945 when he was 7 years old. Although he went to school to study [[architecture]],&lt;ref name=journal&gt;{{cite journal | title = Q&amp;A: Jean-Michael Cousteau on Killer Whales | last = Cruz | first = Gilbert | journal = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date = April 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he joined his father's Cousteau Society, serving for twenty years as executive vice president before striking out on his own in 1993 to produce environmental films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-10/28/content_5261069.htm?rss=1 | title = Cousteau family feuds over Hawaii condo project | agency = [[Xinhua News Agency]] | publisher = chinaview.cn | date = October 28, 2006 | accessdate = 2010-01-25 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110609153022/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-10/28/content_5261069.htm?rss=1 | archivedate = June 9, 2011 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chronicle&gt;{{cite news | title = Chronicle | last = Brozan | first = Nadine | date = June 12, 1996 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/12/style/chronicle-718858.html | work = New York Times | page = A21 | accessdate = 2010-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Legacy&gt;{{cite journal | title = Cousteau's Legacy: His Son and Widow Compete to Carry On | journal = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,989254,00.html | date = October 5, 1998 | accessdate = 2010-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cousteau and his father disagreed on the management and policies of the Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Jacques Cousteau, Oceans' Impresario, Dies | last = Jonas | first = Gerald | date = June 26, 1997 | accessdate = 2010-01-25 | work = New York Times | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/26/world/jacques-cousteau-oceans-impresario-dies.html?pagewanted=5 | page = A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Cousteau opened a resort on a [[Fiji]] Island utilizing the family name, Jacques-Yves Cousteau filed a lawsuit against him in 1996.&lt;ref name=Legacy/&gt; In June 1996, a court signed an injunction requiring him to add, with equal prominence in placement, his first name to the hotel.&lt;ref name=Chronicle/&gt; Jean-Michel then founded the Ocean Futures Society in 1999, a [[marine conservation]] and education organization. In 2003, Francesca Sorrenti and Marisha Shibuya of the SKe GROUP project, in partnership with Jean-Michel Cousteau's Ocean Futures Society, collaborated to produce ''Water Culture'', a [[Trolley Books]] publication featuring a wide variety of photographer's water-related imagery and interviews with prominent world personalities on the problems facing our [[Water scarcity|water supply]].&lt;ref&gt;http://trolleybooks.com/bookSingle.php?bookId=22&lt;/ref&gt; Cousteau is also Chairman of [[Green Cross International|Green Cross]] France. Cousteau advocates for a world free of [[nuclear weapons]], and is a member of the Advisory Council of the [[Nuclear Age Peace Foundation]].

Cousteau is working on a [[documentary]] highlighting the epic and disastrous [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill|2010 Gulf Oil Spill]] in which 11 workers were killed during an explosion of deepwater rig {{convert|50|mi}} off the coast of Louisiana.

In 2012, he published the book ''My Father, The Captain: My Life with Jacques Cousteau''.

Jean-Michel Cousteau is the President of Green Cross France &amp; Territoires, a NGO proposing keys for actions towards a better environment for an unburden future.

===Film production and appearances===
He has produced over 70 films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Breakfast With Jean-michel Cousteau |date=April 24, 2006 |work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=yrMNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NXIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6530,3964700&amp;dq=cousteau+jean-michel&amp;hl=en |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120715151812/http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=yrMNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NXIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6530,3964700&amp;dq=cousteau+jean-michel&amp;hl=en |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 15, 2012 |last=Sheridan |first=Patricia |accessdate=2010-01-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He appears in the 2003 [[IMAX]] documentary film ''[[Coral Reef Adventure]]''.

He appeared on a [[Documentary film|documentary-type]] special feature on the DVD version of ''[[The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie]]'' (2004) in which he and [[Stephen Hillenburg]] talk about all of the real-life counterparts to the sea creatures seen in the cartoon series and movie. He did a similar feature for the DVD of the [[Disney]]/[[Pixar]] movie ''[[Finding Nemo]]''. In Disney's DVD release of ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', Cousteau makes an appearance interacting with the characters from the film, [[Marlin]], [[Finding Nemo|Nemo]] and [[Dory]], and touting the need for better pollution control, showing videos of polluted [[coral reefs]].

Jean-Michel Cousteau made a new documentary series ''Ocean Adventures ''released in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/kqed/oceanadventures/episodes/kure/ Ocean Adventures]&lt;/ref&gt; Cousteau's Ocean Futures Society, [[KQED]] and [[PBS]] are continuing production on the ''Ocean Adventures'' series for 2007 and 2008.  In October 2006, Jean-Michel Cousteau, and an expedition team that includes his son Fabien and daughter Céline, began filming along the [[Amazon River]]. Twenty years ago scientists predicted devastation and irreversible environmental damage here, and 25 years ago Jean-Michel Cousteau and his legendary father traveled with their teams the entire length of the Amazon to document, learn, and see for themselves.

In 2006, Cousteau's documentary ''Voyage to Kure'' inspired then [[United States President|U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]] to protect the [[Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument]], making it—with its {{convert|140000|sqmi|km2}} of ocean waters, islands, and [[atolls]]—one of the largest [[Marine Protected Area]]s in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

'''''Karcher v.

== Background ==
The New Jersey Legislature adopted a redistricting plan which resulted in a one percent population difference between the largest and smallest districts.  Several citizens came forward and challenged the legislation, claiming it violated [[Article I, Section 2]] of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]].  The district court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and determined the law to be unconstitutional.  The defendants appealed to the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name=Justia/&gt;&lt;ref name=Oyez/&gt;&lt;ref name=Case/&gt;

The "equal representation" standard of Article I, Section 2 requires districts to be apportioned to population equality to the closest possible degree.  The population differences here could have been avoided with a good faith effort to achieve population equality.  The Court found that the defendants did not meet their burden of proving that the deviations in their plan were necessary to achieve a consistent, nondiscriminatory redistricting.  The State had to prove specifically how and why the specific deviations of its plan were for an objective to benefit the system. The defendant tried to prove that the justification for the high deviations was to preserve voting strength of minority groups.  However, the court believed that the state could not prove that the population disparities preserved the voting strength of these minority groups.&lt;ref name=Justia/&gt;&lt;ref name=Oyez/&gt;&lt;ref name=Case/&gt;

== Opinion of the Court ==
The Supreme Court upheld the district courts decision based on the plaintiffs' evidence of districts not drawn in "good faith," and the state's failure to offer a legitimate reason for the population deviations exceeding minimum possible as required by Article I, section 2 of the Constitution. The dissenters thought that the population deviations—which were less than the margin of error for the census itself—was not the appropriate grounds for the holding and asserted that the districts should be ruled unconstitutional as a blatant political gerrymander. Justice Stevens's concurring 5th vote held both grounds were valid. The State was compelled to enact a new redistricting plan that followed smaller population deviations of district size.&lt;ref name=Justia/&gt;&lt;ref name=Oyez/&gt;&lt;ref name=Case/&gt; Of note, precisely the same Court ruled political gerrymanders were justiciable three years later in Davis v. Bandemer.

== Analysis ==
The case is usually cited for its holding that there is no de minimis deviation for population inequality between districts, and that all deviations must be justified by a legitimate governmental interest (such as geographic features or preserving communities-of-interest). However, the case is the earliest Court rejection of a political gerrymander—though Justice Brennan's approach does not require holding on those grounds. In addition, the case is a prime example of the tie between the McDonnell-Douglas burden-shifting framework and redistricting law.&lt;ref name=Justia/&gt;&lt;ref name=Oyez/&gt;&lt;ref name=Case/&gt;

The '''Mental Disability Advocacy Center''' (MDAC) is an [[international human rights]] organisation founded in [[Hungary]] in 2002. It is headquartered in [[Budapest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://adhat.hu/?q=content/mdac-k%C3%B6zpont-ment%C3%A1lis-s%C3%A9r%C3%BCltek-jogai%C3%A9rt-alap%C3%ADtv%C3%A1ny |title=MDAC - Központ a Mentális Sérültek Jogaiért Alapítvány |language=hu |website=Adhat.hu |date= |accessdate=2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The Mental Disability Advocacy Center (MDAC) is an international human rights organisation which advances the [[children's rights|rights of children]] and adults with learning, intellectual and psycho-social (mental health) disabilities. 

MDAC uses the law to promote [[social equality|equality]] and social [[inclusion (disability rights)|inclusion]] through strategic litigation, advocacy, research and monitoring and capacity-building.
 
MDAC operates at the global level as well as regional and domestic levels in Europe and Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mdac.info/en/about |title=About &amp;#124; MDAC |website=Mdac.info |date= |accessdate=2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
MDAC was founded by The Open Society Foundations (OSF) and was registered as a foundation by the Budapest Capital Court (registration number 8689) in November 2002. MDAC has participatory status with the [[Council of Europe]], and was granted a special consultative status with the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csonet.org/content/documents/E2011INF4.pdf |format=PDF |title=List of non-governmental organizations in consultative status with the Economic and Social Council as of 1 September 2011 |website=Csonet.org |accessdate=2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; MDAC is a member of the Fundamental Rights Platform of the  [[Fundamental Rights Agency|European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights]].

Chairs of the Board: 
April 2015- : Phillippa Kaufmann QC [Vice Chair Peter Chivers].

March 2011-March 2014: Dr Felicity Callard.

Up to March 2011: Prof Peter Bartlett. 

==Beneficiaries==
People with learning, intellectual and psycho-social (mental health) disabilities are excluded from economic, civil, social and political rights, including the right to education, health and to vote. They are also denied their personhood under the law, and can be placed in institutions against their will.

==Objectives==
MDAC's objectives focus on the rights of people with intellectual, learning and psycho-social (mental health) disabilities to be free from abuse, be persons recognised by the law and have access to justice, to live in the community, be educated and to take part in society. 

- freedom from ill-treatment: for people with disabilities to be not secluded from the rest of society nor be subjected to physical and chemical restraints, and to be treated only with their consent.

- legal capacity: for people with disabilities to have their right to make their own choices protected by law.

- community living: for people with disabilities to have a legal right to live in the community, and a legally enforceable choice as to where and with whom to live.

- inclusive education: for children, youth and adults with disabilities to have a legal right to be educated and learn alongside the rest of the community, and not be segregated.

- political participation: for people with disabilities to have the right to vote and stand for election, and be assisted in doing so.

==Activities==
These include creating progressive jurisprudence and law reform, empowering people with disabilities and promoting participatory politics, supported by research. 

- defending disabled people’s rights in courts across [[Europe]] and [[Africa]], setting precedent at [[European Court of Human Rights]] and other courts, training lawyers and providing legal advice and representation.

- advocacy by connecting with governments to reform and implement legal structures, undertaking a watchdog role, reviewing the actions of the [[United Nations|UN]] and the [[European Union|EU]] as well as governments, and monitoring bodies, so that torture and ill-treatment is prevented. 

- working at grassroots level to engage, empower and train people with disabilities to participate in acquiring their own rights.

- research of human rights abuses

==Achievements==
Since 2002, MDAC has achieved the following:

- ending the practice of caged beds: in 2003, MDAC carried out research in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia and Slovenia on those countries’ use of cage beds. Cage beds are a means of confinement and restraint for adults and children used within many mental health and social institutions. As a direct result of MDAC’s work, Hungary has banned their use in all institutions, the Czech Republic and Slovakia has banned their use in social care institutions. Very few, if any, are still used in Slovenia. 

- creating progressive human rights jurisprudence: MDAC has won cases at the European Court of Human Rights which has opened the way to further challenges to political and social attitudes to the care of people with intellectual and psycho-social disabilities. As a result, it has lobbied for reform of laws on guardianship and the right to be legally recognised as a person in Central and Eastern Europe and Russia. Stanev v Bulgaria (2012), concerned the long-term placement, torture and ill-treatment of a man diagnosed with a mental illness in a remote care institution by his guardian. He had no recourse to legally challenge the decision in Bulgarian courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mdac.info/en/stanev |title=Stanev v Bulgaria &amp;#124; MDAC |website=Mdac.info |date= |accessdate=2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interights.org/stanev/index.html |title=Stanev v Bulgaria |publisher=Interights |date= |accessdate=2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first time the Court found a violation of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights (prohibition of torture) in a disability case. It was also the first time the court found that a person in a social care institution was unlawfully detained. Shtukaturov v Russia (2008), concerned the detention of a man diagnosed with schizophrenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-85611 |title=HUDOC - European Court of Human Rights |website=Hudoc.echr.coe.int |date= |accessdate=2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was placed under guardianship without being informed of the decision. His guardian unlawfully allowed for his detention in a psychiatric hospital for seven months without a court review, and he was forcibly injected with psychiatric medication against his will. MDAC took his case to the European Court of Human Rights and he won.

- the right to education: in 2008, MDAC won an international case under the European Social Charter (MDAC v. Bulgaria) on behalf of up to 3,000 Bulgarian children with intellectual disabilities — the first case on a child’s right to education in Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crin.org/docs/ESCR_Bulgaria_MA.pdf |format=PDF |title=Mental Disability Advocacy Center v. Bulgaria : (No 41/2007, European Committee of Social Rights) : Analysis and Recommendations |website=Crin.org |accessdate=2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/socialcharter/complaints/CC41Merits_en.pdf |title=La Charte sociale européenne |website=Coe.int |date= |accessdate=2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- the right to vote: MDAC's ‘Save the Vote’ campaign resulted in the Venice Commission, a constitutional law expert group, supporting universal suffrage for people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://savethevote.info/ |title=そっけなくなった彼女の浮気調査結果 探偵体験秘話 |website=Savethevote.info |date= |accessdate=2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- in 2013, MDAC was long-listed for the Václav Havel Human Rights Prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assembly.coe.int/vaclav-havel-human-rights-prize/ |accessdate=October 3, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506005710/http://www.assembly.coe.int/vaclav-havel-human-rights-prize/ |archivedate=May 6, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

- In 2014, MDAC released a report on cage beds in the Czech Republic, after its ground-breaking first report published in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mdac.org/en/content/cage-beds-and-coercion-czech-psychiatric-institutions |title=Cage beds and coercion in Czech psychiatric institutions |publisher=MDAC |date=2014-06-30 |accessdate=2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was covered by Lancet Psychiatry.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20140816210219/http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(14)70324-4/fulltext/ ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ministry of Defense of Turkmenistan''' ([[Turkmen language|Turkmen]]: Türkmenistanyň Goranmak ministrligi) is a government agency under the [[Armed Forces of Turkmenistan]] which is the executive body in implementing defense policies in [[Turkmenistan]]. The current Minister of Defense is Major General [[Begench Gundogdyev]].

== Military Policy ==
[[Turkmenistan]] is considered to be the most neutral of all former republics of the [[Soviet Union]]. The country's military did not sign the [[Collective Security Treaty Organization|Tashkent Treaty]] in May 1992, and is an observer in the [[Council of Ministers of Defense of the CIS]]. The neutral policy of Turkmenistan was also emphasized in relation to the 1996 Afghan Warcmaintaining an even relationship with both the Taliban and the Afghan government. Following the events of [[9/11]], coalition troops did not appear on Turkmen territory, in particular, when President Niyazov refused to provide the German government with a base to store German aircraft, arguing that the country intends to continue to follow the principles of neutrality.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3858">The '''Ministry of National Defense''' (''MOD'') is the [[government ministry]] responsible for the maintenance of the national defense and the governance of the military of [[Liberia]], the [[Armed Forces of Liberia]].  The current Minister of National Defense is Hon. [[Brownie J. Samukai]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mod.gov.lr/content.php?sub=Minister%27s%20Biography&amp;related=The%20Minister Ministry, Front page]&lt;/ref&gt; Saint Jerome Larbelee   is the current deputy minister for operations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mod.gov.lr/content.php. http://www.marshallcenter.org/mcpublicweb/en/component/content/article/4-cat-mc-news/653-art-mc-new-09-02.html, accessed 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph F. Johnson is the current Deputy Defense Minister for Administration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mod.gov.lr/content.php?/forum/viewtopic/id/375]&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry's three-story building used to be located on Benson Street in downtown [[Monrovia]], but upon the conclusion of the [[DynCorp]] army training effort in Liberia, moved to the Barclay Training Center, also located in central Monrovia, in July 2009. In early August 2009 the Ministry's Comptroller was dismissed, apparently for misappropriating US $50,000 intended for paying soldiers of the rebuilt AFL.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liberianobserver.com/node/453 Corruption at Ministry of Defense? (Comptroller Sacked for 'Eating' US$50,000 Soldiers' Pay )], August 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniel Chea (DOB: 25 MAY 1958) was the Defense Minister under [[Charles Taylor (Liberian politician)|Charles Taylor]]'s [[National Patriotic Party]] administration from 1997 to 2006.  More than 150 Liberian government soldiers staged a protest demonstration against the re-appointment of Daniel Chea as Defense Minister in the NTGL, claiming he owed them more than two years of pay arrears.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tlcafrica.com/ntgl2.htm, and [http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200506/16/eng20050616_190478.html Xinhua], accessed February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  They complained that Chea had failed to pay most government soldiers, giving priority to an elite force, the [[Anti-Terrorist Unit (Liberia)|Anti-Terrorist Unit]] at the expense of the regular army.

Before the [[First Liberian Civil War]], Harry A. Greaves served as Minister from 1976–78, M. B. Holder 1978–79, James Y. Gbabee 1979–80, Grey Allison, up to August 1989,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Ellis, The Mask of Anarchy, Hurst &amp; Co., London, 2001, p.118. Allison was charged and later convicted of ritual killing.

An amendment to the Liberian Constitution allowed the previously-named War Department to be renamed the Department of National Defense on February 25, 1955.&lt;ref&gt;'Looking at the LNG Brigade,' Armed Forces Day Brochure, 1973-74, Ministry of National Defense, via [[University of Liberia]] Library&lt;/ref&gt; Then, during the early years of the [[William R.

==Early life and education==
Learnard was born in [[Fairfax, Vermont]] on November 14, 1832, the son of Stephen Tracy and Polly (Dee) Learnard, and was educated at [[Bakersfield Academy]] before entering [[Norwich University]] in 1852.&lt;ref name="Ellis1911"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Arba Ellis|title=Norwich University, 1819-1911|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=148pAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA559|year=1911|publisher=Capital city Press|page=559}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later studied at [[Albany Law School]], and was admitted to the bar in 1855.&lt;ref name="Ellis1911" /&gt; He moved to Ohio in the summer of 1855. During the winter of 1855–1856, he moved to [[Lawrence, Kansas]] and joined the effort to have Kansas admitted as a free state.&lt;ref name=papers /&gt;&lt;ref name="Armitage2010" /&gt;

==Career and military service==
In 1857, Learnard helped set out the town of [[Burlington, Kansas]] and built the first mill, the first business building, and a structure used as a school and church.&lt;ref name=papers/&gt; He served as a member of the council of the first free state legislature from 1857 to 1859. Learnard was judge of the 5th Judicial Circuit after the state government was established.&lt;ref name=papers /&gt; He supported the [[Free-Stater (Kansas)|Free State Movemeent]], opposing slavery,&lt;ref name="Ellis1911"/&gt; and was a local organizer for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Standard History of Kansas and Kansans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HHJHAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1248|year=1919|publisher=Lewis Publishing Company|page=1248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Learnard resigned his judgeship at the beginning of the Civil War. He enrolled as a lieutenant colonel in the [[1st Regiment Kansas Volunteer Infantry|1st Kansas regiment]] and served until he resigned his commission in 1863. He participated in [[Price's Raid]] of Kansas, the [[Battle of Little Blue River]], and at [[Westport, Missouri]] in 1864.&lt;ref name=papers/&gt;

'''Petitioning''' (also known as '''letters and calls''', '''correspondence and reception''', '''xinfang''' or '''shangfang''') is the administrative system for hearing complaints and grievances from individuals in the [[People's Republic of China]].

==Origins==
In ancient imperial times, petitioners were called "people with grievances" (''yuānmín''). Petitioners who needed justice would come to  the [[yamen]] of the [[County magistrate]] or high official and beat a drum to voice their grievances. As such, every official court was supposed to be equipped with a drum for this sole purpose. Sometimes petitioners would throw their bodies in front of a sedan chair of the high official. When no one else at the local level was able to help, petitioners would travel to the then empire's capital to seek higher official's help.

Petitioners in recent years sometimes search for justice through the legal system or local petitioning bureaus. However, those who feel that justice has eluded them often still travel to Beijing as a last resort to appeal to the rulers in the age-old manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/jamesreynolds/2009/04/petitions_in_china.html|title=Petitions in China|last= James Reynolds |date=9 April 2009  |publisher=BBC|accessdate=2009-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==System==
Under the system, State Bureau for Letters and Calls (''guojia xinfang ju'') and local bureaus of letters and calls ("petitioning bureaus") are commissioned to receive letters, calls, and visits from individuals or groups on suggestions, complaints, and grievances. The officers then channel the issues to respective departments and monitor the progress of settlement, which they feedback to the filing parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gjxfj.gov.cn/|title=Chinese official web site:国家信访局|accessdate=2009-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Petitioning bureaus are ostensibly a communication channel between the government and the citizenry, and have been relied on since the establishment of the PRC in 1949. Petitioners may begin their attempts for redress at the local level with letters and calls to offices, which are located in courthouses or in township-level government offices. If unsatisfied, they can move up the hierarchy to provincial level offices and, at the highest level, the State Bureau for Letters and Visits in Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;HRW's "Alleyway" citing Li Li, "Life in a Struggle," Beijing Review, May 4, 2005, http://www.bjreview.cn/EN/En-2005/05-45-e/china-1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;HRW's "Alleyway" citing Jonathan K. Ocko, "I'll take it all the way to Beijing: Capital appeals in the Qing," Journal of Asian Studies, vol. 47.2 (May 1988), p.294&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of petitioners in Beijing alone has allegedly reached more than 100,000 people, not counting those that remain at provincial capitals.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} The number of people using the petitioning system has increased since 1993, to the extent that the system has been strained for years. Official statistics indicate that petition offices annually handled around 10 million inquiries and complaints from petitioners from 2003 to 2007.&lt;ref&gt;HRW's "Alleyway" citing Li Huizi and Zhou Erjie, "China's public complaint department busiest office in Beijing," Xinhua News Agency, September 2, 2007, http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-09/02/content_6142475.htm (accessed August 11, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite its enduring nature and political support, the system has never been an effective mechanism for dealing with the complaints brought to it.&lt;ref&gt;HRW's "Alleyway" citing Carl F. Minzner, "Xinfang: An Alternative to the Formal Chinese Legal System," Stanford Journal of International Law, vol. 42:1 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response to petitioners==

===Interception===

Provincial capitals have been accused of hiring people in Beijing to abduct petitioners who have travelled from their areas and force them to go back home; this is known as "intercepting." The apparent aim of interceptors is to prevent citizens from appealing in Beijing because local officials face reprisals if citizens from their areas seek redress in the capital.&lt;ref&gt;Tania Branigan, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/12/chinese-black-jails-human-rights "Chinese petitioners held in illicit 'black jails,' report claims"] The Guardian, Nov 12 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imprisonment and abuse===
Human rights organizations have accused Chinese authorities of arbitrarily imprisoning large numbers of petitioners in [[black jails]] or other illicit detention facilities. In 2009, Human Rights Watch produced a report alleging that large numbers of petitioners, including children, are detained in black jails, and documented several allegations of torture and mistreatment in the facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch, [https://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2009/11/12/alleyway-hell-0  "An Alleyway in Hell"], Nov 12 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''police band''' is a [[military band|military-style band]] operated or sponsored by a [[police|police force]]. Police bands provide ceremonial support for civic events, and perform at police observances such as funerals and police academy graduations.&lt;ref name="blooms"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reimer|first1=Mark|title=World Police Bands: Globalization through Music|url=https://organizations.bloomu.edu/gasi/pdf_documents/2008_Proceedings_pdfs/Reimer.pdf|website=[[Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania]]|publisher=Annual Convention of the Global Awareness Society International|accessdate=December 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;Like [[military bands]], their repertoire is mostly composed of ceremonial [[marching]] music and [[honors music]] ([[national anthems]] and [[fanfares]]).

==History==
The earliest instance of a police band was the [[Glasgow Police Pipe Band]], originally called the Burgh of Govan Police Pipe Band, which was formed in [[Glasgow, Scotland]] in 1883, and was soon followed by a similar organization formed in [[Edinburgh]].&lt;ref name="diss"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Makers need $ for pipe band film|url=https://www.pipesdrums.com/article/makers-need-for-pipe-band-film/|accessdate=December 19, 2017|work=Pipes Drums|date=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first-organized police band in [[Australia]] was that of the Grayville Police Band, which was established in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dennis|first1=Simone|title=Police Beat|date=2007|publisher=Cambria Press|isbn=1621968510|page=16|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vFxM9nolKaMC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirteen years later, in 1897, the [[Milwaukee Police]] Band became the first such ensemble to be formed in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McElreath|first1=David|title=Introduction to Law Enforcement|date=2013|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=1466556234|page=266|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DiJ5jkY4tbcC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police bands in much of the English-speaking world have often taken the form of [[pipe band]]s, owing to a history of organizational emulation of the earliest police bands formed in Scotland.&lt;ref name="diss"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walker|first1=Erin|title=The Scottish Pipe Band in North America: Tradition, Transformation, and Transnational Identity|date=2015|publisher=[[University of Kentucky]]|page=2|url=https://uknowledge.uky.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1048&amp;context=music_etds}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, bagpipes have "become the adopted instrument of the law enforcement community".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=VanBrederode|first1=James|title=Police Practice: The Anatomy of a Police Pipe Band|url=https://leb.fbi.gov/articles/additional-articles/police-practice-the-anatomy-of-a-police-pipe-band|accessdate=December 20, 2017|work=Law Enforcement Bulletin|publisher=[[FBI]]|date=January 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were various police bands in the RCMP that flourished during the 1950s, leading the [[Canadian government]] granting approval for a full-time central band to be created in December 1958, with headquarters in the capital of [[Ottawa]]. It was listed repeatedly as one of Canada's finest bands, which earned it the privilege of being able to play for dignitaries such as [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and Queen [[Elizabeth II]] in 1990. Although it was an official regimental band, the members worked in the band as a secondary job apart from their actual jobs in the RCMP. Members of the band wore the RCMP's notable [[Red Serge]] and adopted in the band Canadian military discipline which was in part inspired by the [[British Army]]'s experience with military and police bands. Appearances made by the band also included the [[Expo 86]] and the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings|Commonwealth Conference]] in [[Vancouver]], as well as the [[Calgary Winter Olympics]] in 1988. To this day, many RCMP officers continue the original band's tradition by serving in smaller police bands in areas of RCMP operation.&lt;ref&gt;https://militarymusic.com/blogs/military-music/13516489-the-royal-canadian-mounted-police-band&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britishempire.co.uk/forces/armyunits/canadiancavalry/rcmpbands.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://rcmpband.ca/history/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition of policy networks ==

Although the number of definitions is almost as large as the number of approaches of analysis, [[R. A. W. Rhodes|Rhodes]]&lt;ref name="rhodes2008" /&gt;{{rp|426}} aims to offer a minimally exclusive starting point: "Policy networks are sets of formal institutional and informal linkages between governmental and other actors structured around shared if endlessly negotiated beliefs and interests in public policy making and implementation."

== Possible typologies of policy networks ==

As Thatcher&lt;ref name="thatcher1998" /&gt;{{rp|391}} notes, policy network approaches initially aimed to model specific forms of state-interest group relations, without giving exhaustive typologies.

=== Policy communities vs. Issue networks ===

The most widely used paradigm of the 1970s and 1980s only analyzed two specific types of policy networks: policy communities and issue networks. Justifications of the usage of these concepts were deduced from empirical case studies.&lt;ref name="thatcher1998"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Thatcher | first = Mark | title = The development of policy network analyses: from modest origins to overarching frameworks | journal = [[Journal of Theoretical Politics]] | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | pages = 389–416 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0951692898010004002 | date = October 1998 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0951692898010004002 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Policy Communities in which you refer to relatively slowly changing networks defining the context of policy-making in specific policy segments. The network links are generally perceived as the relational ties between bureaucrats, politicians and interest groups. The main characteristic of policy communities – compared to issue networks – is that the boundaries of the networks are more stable and more clearly defined. This concept was studied in the context of policy-making in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="thatcher1998"/&gt;

In contrast, [[issue networks]] – a concept established in literature about United States government - refer to a looser system, where a relatively large number of stakeholders are involved. Non-government actors in these networks usually include not only interest group representatives but also professional or academic experts.  An important characteristic of issue network is that membership is constantly changing, interdependence is often asymmetric and – compared to policy communities – it is harder to identify dominant actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Heclo | first = Hugh | contribution = Issue networks and the executive establishment | editor-last = King | editor-first = Anthony | title = The new American political system | pages = 87–124 | publisher = American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research | location = Washington | year = 1978 | isbn = 9780844733159 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other possible typologies ===

New typological approaches appeared in the early 1990s and late 1980s with the aim of grouping policy networks into a system of mutually exclusive and commonly exhaustive categories.&lt;ref name="thatcher1998"/&gt; One possible logic of typology is based on the degree of integration, membership size and distribution of resources in the network.  This categorization – perhaps most importantly represented by R. A. W. Rhodes – allows the combination of policy communities and issue networks with categories like professional network, intragovernmental network and producer network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Marsh | first1 = David | last2 = Rhodes | first2 = R.A.W. | author-link2 = R. A. W. Rhodes | title = Policy networks in British government | publisher = Clarendon Press Oxford University Press | location = Oxford Oxford New York | year = 1992 | isbn = 9780198278528 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other approaches identify categories based on distinct patterns of state-interest group relations. Patterns include corporatism and pluralism, [[Iron triangle (US politics)|iron triangles]], subgovernment and [[clientelism]] while the differentiation is based on membership, stability and sectorality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jordan | first1 = Grant | last2 = Schubert | first2 = Klaus | title = A preliminary ordering of policy network labels | journal = [[European Journal of Political Research]] | volume = 21 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 7–27 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1475-6765.1992.tb00286.x | date = February 1992 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1475-6765.1992.tb00286.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Roles of policy network analysis ==

As the field of policy network analysis grew since the late 20th century, scholars developed competing descriptive, theoretical and prescriptive accounts. Each type gives different specific content for the term policy network and uses different research methodologies.&lt;ref name=rhodes2008/&gt;

=== Descriptive usage ===

For several authors, policy networks describe specific forms of government policy-making. The three most important forms are interest intermediation, interorganizational analysis, and governance.&lt;ref name=rhodes2008/&gt;

==== Interest intermediation ====

An approach developed from the literature on US pluralism, policy networks are often analyzed in order to identify the most important actors influencing governmental decision-making. From this perspective, a network-based assessment is useful to describe power positions, the structure of [[oligopoly]] in political markets, and the institutions of interest negotiation.&lt;ref name=rhodes2008/&gt;

==== Interorganizational analysis ====

Another branch of descriptive literature, which emerged from the study of European politics, aims to understand the interdependency in decision-making between formal political institutions and the corresponding organizational structures. This viewpoint emphasizes the importance of overlapping organizational responsibilities and the distribution of power in shaping specific policy outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rhodes | first = R.A.W. | author-link = R. A. W. Rhodes | title = Control and power in central-local government relations | publisher = Ashgate | location = Aldershot, Hants, England Brookfield, Vermont | edition = revised | year = 1999 | isbn = 9781840147780 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Governance ====

A third direction of descriptive scholarship is to describe general patterns of policy-making – the formal institutions of power-sharing between government, independent state bodies and the representatives of employer and labor interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Nielsen | first1 = Klaus | last2 = Pedersen | first2 = Ove K. | title = The negotiated economy: ideal and history | journal = [[Scandinavian Political Studies]] | volume = 11 | issue = 2 | page = 101 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9477.1988.tb00361.x | date = June 1998 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9477.1988.tb00361.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://tidsskrift.dk/index.php/scandinavian_political_studies/article/view/12990/24777 Text.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hall | first1 = Peter A. | last2 = Soskice | first2 = David W. | title = Varieties of capitalism : the institutional foundations of comparative advantage | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford England New York | year = 2001 | isbn = 9780199247752 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theoretical usage ===

The two most important theoretical approaches aiming to understand and explain actor's behavior in policy networks are the following: power dependence and rational choice.&lt;ref name=rhodes2008/&gt;

==== Power dependence ====

In power dependence models, policy networks are understood as mechanism of exchanging resources between organizations in the networks. The dynamic of exchange is determined by the comparative value of resources (f.e. legal, political or financial in nature) and individual capacities to deploy them in order create better bargaining positions and achieve higher degrees of autonomy.&lt;ref name=rhodes2008/&gt;

==== Rational Choice ====

In policy network analysis, theorists complement standard rational choice arguments with the insights of [[new institutionalism]]. This "actor-centered institutionalism" is used to describe policy networks as structural arrangements between relatively stable sets of public and private players. Rational choice theorists identify [[Node (networking)|links]] between network actors as channels to exchange multiple goods (f.e. knowledge, resources and information).&lt;ref name=rhodes2008/&gt;

=== Prescriptive usage ===

The prescriptive literature on policy networks focuses on the phenomenon's role in constraining or enabling certain governmental action. From this viewpoint, networks are seen as central elements of the realm of policy-making at least partially defining the desirability of status quo – thus a possible target of reform initiatives.&lt;ref name=rhodes2008/&gt; The three most common network management approaches are the following: instrumental (a focus on altering dependency relation), institutional (a focus on rules, incentives and culture) and interactive (a focus on communication and negotiation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Kickert | first1 = Walter J.M. | last2 = Klijn | first2 = Erik-Hans | last3 = Koppenjan | first3 = Joop F.M. | author-link1 = Walter Kickert | title = Managing complex networks strategies for the public sector | publisher = Sage | location = London Thousand Oaks, California | year = 1997 | isbn = 9781446217658 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== New directions and debates ==

As Rhodes&lt;ref name=rhodes2008/&gt; points out, there is a long-lasting debate in the field about general theories predicting the emergence of specific networks and corresponding policy outcomes depending on specific conditions. No theories have succeeded in achieving this level of generality yet and some scholars doubt they ever will. Other debates are focusing on describing and theorizing change in policy networks. While some political scientists state that this might not be possible,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Richardson | first = Jeremy | title = Government, interest groups and policy change | journal = [[Political Studies (journal)|Political Studies]] | volume = 48 | issue = 5 | pages = 1006–1025 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/1467-9248.00292 | date = December 2000 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1467-9248.00292 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; other scholars have made efforts towards the understanding of policy network dynamics. One example is the advocacy coalition framework, which aims to analyze the effect of commonly represented beliefs (in coalitions) on policy outcomes.&lt;ref name=rhodes2008/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Nedergaard | first = Peter | author-link = Peter Nedergaard | title = The reform of the 2003 Common Agricultural Policy: an advocacy coalition explanation | journal = Policy Studies | volume = 29 | issue = 2 | pages = 179–195 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/01442870802033464 | date = June 2008 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01442870802033464 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Potentially Hazardous Food''' is a term used by [[food safety]] organizations to classify foods that require time-temperature control to keep them safe for human consumption. A PHF is a food that:
*Contains moisture - usually regarded as a [[water activity]] greater than 0.85
*Contains protein
*Is neutral to slightly acidic - typically having a [[pH]] between 4.6 and 7.5

==US FDA Definition==
Potentially Hazardous Food has been redefined by the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] in the 2013 FDA Food Code to Time/Temperature Control for Safety Food.
&lt;ref name="fda"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/RetailFoodProtection/FoodCode/ucm374275.htm|publisher=fda.gov|title=Food Code 2013|accessdate=2016-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Pages 22 and 23 (pdf pages 54 and 55), state the following:
[[File:US FDA PHF-TCS Foods Chart A.PNG|thumb|PHF table A 2013 FDA Food Code.]]
[[File:US FDA PHF-TCS Foods Chart B.PNG|thumb|PHF table B 2013 FDA Food Code.]]
*"Time/temperature control for safety food" means a FOOD that requires time/temperature control for safety (TCS) to limit pathogenic microorganism growth or toxin formation.
*"Time/temperature control for safety food" includes:
** An animal FOOD that is raw or heat-treated; a plant FOOD that is heat- treated or consists of raw seed sprouts, cut melons, cut leafy greens, cut tomatoes or mixtures of cut tomatoes that are not modified in a way so that they are unable to support pathogenic microorganism growth or toxin formation, or garlic-in-oil mixtures that are not modified in a way so that they are unable to support pathogenic microorganism growth or toxin formation; and
** Except as specified in Subparagraph (3)(d) of this definition, a FOOD that because of the interaction of its [[Water activity|A&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[pH]] values is designated as Product Assessment Required (PA) in Table A or B of this definition:
*"Time/temperature control for safety food" does not include:
**An air-cooled hard-boiled EGG with shell intact, or an EGG with shell intact that is not hard-boiled, but has been pasteurized to destroy all viable salmonellae;
**A FOOD in an unopened HERMETICALLY SEALED CONTAINER that is commercially processed to achieve and maintain commercial sterility under conditions of non-refrigerated storage and distribution;
**A FOOD that because of its pH or A&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt; value, or interaction of A&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt; and pH values, is designated as a non-TCS FOOD in Table A or B of this definition;
**A FOOD that is designated as Product Assessment Required (PA) in Table A or B of this definition and has undergone a Product Assessment showing that the growth or toxin formation of pathogenic microorganisms that are reasonably likely to occur in that FOOD is precluded due to:
***Intrinsic factors including added or natural characteristics of the FOOD such as preservatives, antimicrobials, humectants, acidulants, or nutrients,
***Extrinsic factors including environmental or operational factors that affect the FOOD such as packaging, modified atmosphere such as REDUCED OXYGEN PACKAGING, shelf life and use, or temperature range of storage and use, or
***A combination of intrinsic and extrinsic factors; or
**A FOOD that does not support the growth or toxin formation of pathogenic microorganisms.

==For More Information==
The 2013 FDA Food Code, FDA HACCP Manual, USDA HACCP Manual, FSIF Meat and Poultry Product Hazards and Control Guides, and the Food Safety Modernization Act [[FDA Food Safety Modernization Act]], provide detailed information on Time and Temperature controls for food safety.
&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://texas-food-handler.com/haccp-documents|author=https://plus.google.com/+GeneCoxTexasFoodHandler/about|publisher=texas-food-handler.com|title=HACCP Documents - Texas Best Food Services Training|accessdate=2016-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia PHF Information==
In Australia, [[Food Standards Australia New Zealand]] (FSANZ) defines potentially hazardous food to mean food that has to be kept at certain temperatures to minimize the growth of any pathogenic microorganisms that may be present in the food or to prevent the formation of toxins in the food.
&lt;ref name="foodstandards"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/Pages/default.aspx|publisher=foodstandards.gov.au|title=Food Standards Australia New Zealand|accessdate=2016-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Australian regulations, the following are examples of potentially hazardous foods:
*Raw and cooked meat or foods containing meat, such as casseroles, curries and lasagne;
*Dairy products, for example, milk, custard and dairy based desserts;
*Seafood (excluding live seafood);
*Processed fruits and vegetables, for example, salads;
*Cooked rice and pasta;
*Foods containing eggs, beans, nuts or other protein rich foods, such as quiche and soy products;
*Foods that contain these foods, such as sandwiches and rolls.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15361">[[Image:Defend equality poster.png|thumb|An example protesting [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|California Proposition 8]].]]
'''Protest art''' is a broad term that refers to creative works that concern or are produced by [[activists]] and [[social movements]].  There are also contemporary and historical works and currents of thought that can be characterized in this way.

Social movements produce such works as the signs, banners, posters, and other printed materials used to convey a particular cause or message.  Often, such art is used as part of demonstrations or acts of [[civil disobedience]].  These works tend to be ephemeral, characterized by their portability and disposability, and are frequently not authored or owned by any one person.  The various [[peace symbols]], and the [[raised fist]] are two examples that highlight the democratic ownership of these signs.

Protest art also includes (but is not limited to) performance, site-specific installations, graffiti and street art, and crosses the boundaries of art genres, media, and disciplines.
While some protest art is associated with trained and professional artists, an extensive knowledge of art is not required to take part in protest art.  Protest artists frequently bypass the art-world institutions and commercial gallery system in an attempt to reach a wider audience.  Furthermore, protest art is not limited to one region or country, but is rather a method that is used around the world. 

There are many politically charged pieces of [[fine art]] — such as [[Picasso]]'s ''[[Guernica (Picasso)|Guernica]]'', some of [[Norman Carlberg]]'s [[Vietnam war]]-era work, or [[Susan Crile]]'s images of torture at [[Abu Ghraib]].

==History==
It is difficult to establish a history for protest art because many variations of it can be found throughout history. While many cases of protest art can be found during the early 1900s, like Picasso's Guernica in 1937, the last thirty years{{When|date=February 2011}} has experienced a large increase in the number of artists adopting protest art as a style to relay a message to the public.

[[File:R.I.P. Internet.jpg|thumb|Protest art against [[SOPA]]]]
[[Image:WarProtestSign.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A piece of protest art featuring a [[parody]] of the logo of the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]].]]
As awareness of social justices around the world became more common among the public, an increase in protest art can be seen. Some of the most critically effective artworks of the recent period{{When|date=February 2011}} were staged outside the gallery, away from the museum and in that sense, protest art has found a different relationship to the public.

==Activist art==
Activist art represents and includes aesthetic, sociopolitical, and technological developments that have attempted to challenge and complicate the traditional boundaries and hierarchies of culture as represented by those in power.  Like protest art, activist art practice emerged partly out of a call for art to be connected to a wider audience, and to open up spaces where the marginalized and disenfranchised can be seen and heard.

Activist art incorporates the use of public space to address socio-political issues and to encourage community and public participation as a means of bringing about social change.  It aims to affect social change by engaging in active processes of representation that work to foster participation in dialogue, raise consciousness, and empower individuals and communities.  The need to ensure the continued impact of a work by sustaining the public participation process it initiated is also a challenge for many activist artists.  It often requires the artist to establish relationships within the communities where projects take place.

If social movements are understood as “repeated public displays” of alternative political and cultural values,&lt;ref&gt;Reed, T.V., The art of protest : culture and activism from the civil rights movement to the streets of Seattle.  (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2005) xiv.&lt;/ref&gt; then activist art is significant in articulating such alternative views.  Activist art is also important to the dimension of culture and an understanding of its importance alongside political, economical, and social forces in movements and acts of social change.  One should be wary of conflating activist art with political art, as doing so obscures critical differences in methodology, strategy, and activist goals.

===Historical basis in art and politics===
Activist art cites its origins from a particular artistic and political climate.  In the art world, performance art of the late 1960s to the 70s worked to broaden aesthetic boundaries within [[visual arts]] and traditional [[theatre]], blurring the rigidly construed distinction between the two.  The transient, interdisciplinary, and hybrid nature of performance art allowed for audience engagement.  The openness and immediacy of the medium invited public participation, and the nature of the artistic medium was a hub for media attention.

Emerging forms of [[feminism]] and feminist art of the time was particularly influential to activist art.  The idea that “the personal is the political,” that is, the notion that personal revelation through art can be a political tool,&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne Lacy, ed.  Mapping the Terrain: New Genre Public Art.  (Seattle: Bay Press Inc., 1995) 27&lt;/ref&gt; guided much activist art in its study of the public dimensions to private experience.  The strategies deployed by feminist artists parallel those by artists working in activist art.  Such strategies often involved “collaboration, dialogue, a constant questioning of aesthetic and social assumptions, and a new respect for audience” and are used to articulate and negotiate issues of self-representation, empowerment, and community identity.

[[Conceptual Art]] sought to expand aesthetic boundaries in its critique of notions of the art object and the commodity system within which it is circulated as currency.  Conceptual artists experimented with unconventional materials and processes of art production.  Grounded by strategies rooted in the real world, projects in conceptual art demanded viewer participation and were exhibited outside of the traditional and exclusive space of the art gallery, thus making the work accessible to the public.  Similarly, collaborative methods of execution and expertise drawn from outside the art world are often employed in activist art so as to attain its goals for community and public participation.  Parallel to the emphasis on ideas that conceptual art endorsed, activist art is process-oriented, seeking to expose embedded power relationships through its process of creation.

In the political sphere, the militancy and identity politics of the period fostered the conditions out of which activist art arose.

===Strategy and practice===
In practice, activist art may often take the form of temporal interventions, such as performance, media events, exhibitions, and installations.  It is also common to employ mainstream media techniques (through the use of billboards, posters, advertising, newspaper inserts…etc.).  By making use of these commercial distributive channels of commerce, this technique is particularly effective in conveying messages that reveal and subvert its usual intentions.

The use public participation as a strategy of activating individuals and communities to become a “catalyst for change” is important to activist art.  In this context, participation becomes an act of self-expression or self-representation by the entire community.  Creative expression empowers individuals by creating a space in which their voices can be heard and in which they can engage in a dialogue with one another, and with the issues in which they have a personal stake.

The Artist and Homeless Collaborative is an example of a project that works with strategies of public participation as a means of individual and community empowerment.  It is an affiliation of artists, arts professionals and women, children and teenagers living in NYC shelters, the A &amp; HC believe that their work in a collaborative project of art-making offers the residents a “positive experience of self-motivation and helps them regain what the shelter system and circumstances of lives destroy: a sense of individual identity and confidence in human interaction.”&lt;ref&gt;Wolper,Andrea. ''Making Art, Reclaiming Live: The Artist and Homeless Collaborative''. (Seattle: Bay Press Inc., 1995) 252-253&lt;/ref&gt; The process of engaging the community in a dialogue with dominant and public discourses about the issue of homelessness is described in a statement by its founder, Hope Sandrow: “The relevancy of art to a community is exhibited in artworks where the homeless speak directly to the public and in discussion that consider the relationship art has to their lives.  The practice of creating art stimulates those living in shelters from a state of malaise to active participation in the artistic process”&lt;ref&gt;Wolper,Andrea. ''Making Art, Reclaiming Live: The Artist and Homeless Collaborative''. (Seattle: Bay Press Inc., 1995) 253&lt;/ref&gt;

The A &amp; HC came into being at a time when a critique of the makers, sellers, and consumers of art that addressed social concerns became increasingly pronounced.  Critics argued that the very works of art whose purpose was to provoke political, social and cultural conversation were confined within the exclusive and privileged space of galleries museums, and private collections.  By contrast, the A &amp; HC was an attempt to bridge the gap between art production and social action, thus allowing for  the work subjects that were previously excluded and silenced to be heard.

==Resistance art==
Resistance art is art used as a way of showing their opposition to powerholders.  This includes art that opposed such powers as the German Nazi party, as well as that opposed to [[apartheid in South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/18799/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311083452/http://library.thinkquest.org/18799/ |archivedate=2012-03-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Willie Bester]] is one of South Africa's most well known artists who originally began as a resistance artist.  Using materials assembled from garbage, Bester builds up surfaces into relief and then paints the surface with oil paint.  His works commented on important black South African figures and aspects important to his community.  South African resistance artists do not exclusively deal with race nor do they have to be from the townships.  Another artist, Jane Alexander, has dealt with the atrocities of apartheid from a white perspective.  Her resistance art deals with the unhealthy society that continues in post-apartheid South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Sue Williamson, Resistance Art in South Africa (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="74401">This article covers the '''religious affiliation in the United States Senate'''.

While the religious preference of elected officials is by no means an indication of their allegiance nor necessarily reflective of their voting record, the religious affiliation of prominent members of all three branches of government is a source of commentary and discussion among the media and public. The topic is also of interest to religious groups and the general public who may appeal to Senators of their denomination on religious or moral issues facing the [[United States Senate]].

The '''Republic of Cabinda'''&lt;ref name="cabinda.ORG"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cabinda.ORG/|title=CABINDA :Sítio oficial do Governo da República de Cabinda no exílio e da F.L.E.C|website=www.cabinda.org|access-date=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Ibinda]]: ''Kilansi kia cabinda''; {{lang-pt|República de Cabinda}}) &lt;ref name="cabinda.net"&gt;http://www.cabinda.net/&lt;/ref&gt; was an unrecognized state in southern Africa. The [[Front for the Liberation of the State of Cabinda]]-[[Exercito de Cabinda]] (FLEC)  claims sovereignty from Angola and proclaimed the Republic of Cabinda as an independent country in 1975. The government of this (internationally not recognized) entity operates [[Government in exile|in exile]], with offices located in [[Paris]], France and [[Pointe Noire]], Congo-Brazzaville.

The 1885 [[Treaty of Simulambuco]] designated Cabinda a Portuguese protectorate known as the Portuguese Congo, which was administratively separate from Portuguese West Africa (Angola). In the 20th century, Portugal decided to integrate Cabinda into Angola, giving it the status of a district of that "overseas province". During the [[Portuguese Colonial War]], FLEC fought for the independence of Cabinda from the Portuguese. Independence was proclaimed on 1 August 1975, and FLEC formed a provisional government led by [[Henrique N'zita Tiago]]. [[:fr:Luiz Ranque Franque|Luiz Ranque Franque]] was elected president.&lt;ref&gt;Official site of the Cabindese Government in exile: [http://www.cabinda.org ''History of the CABINDA'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1975, Angola’s three national liberation movements (People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola ([[MPLA]]), [[National Liberation Front of Angola]] (FNLA) and National Union for the Total Independence of Angola ([[UNITA]])) met with the colonial power in [[Alvor (Portimão)|Alvor]], [[Portugal]], to establish the modalities of the transition to independence. FLEC was not invited. The [[Alvor Agreement]] was signed, establishing Angolan independence and confirming Cabinda as [[Cabinda Province|part of Angola]]. After Angolan independence was declared in November 1975, Cabinda was occupied by the forces of the [[Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola]] (MPLA), which had been present in Cabinda since the mid-1960s, sustaining an anti-colonial guerrilla war that was rather more efficient than the one run by FLEC.

For much of the 1970s and 1980s, FLEC fought a low-intensity guerrilla war, attacking the troops of what was by then the People's Republic of Angola, led by the MPLA. FLEC's tactics included attacking economic targets and kidnapping foreign employees working in the province’s oil and construction businesses. In July 2006, after ceasefire negotiations, António Bento Bembe&amp;nbsp;– as president of the Cabindan Forum for Dialogue and Peace, vice-president and executive secretary of FLEC&amp;nbsp;– announced that the Cabindan separatist forces were ready to declare a ceasefire. A peace treaty was signed. FLEC-FAC from Paris contends Bembe had no authority or mandate to negotiate with the Angolans and that the only acceptable solution is total independence.

==Geography==
Cabinda is a territory of 7,284 square kilometres in west central Africa with a population of 264,584 in 2006 (estimate), divided between four municipalities of [[Belize, Angola|Belize]] (population: 17,693), [[Buco Zau]] (40,019), [[Cabinda (city)|Cabinda]] (185,924) and [[Cacongo]] (20,948). Cabinda is an Angolan [[exclave]], which means that it is not connected to the rest of Angola by land. It borders the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the [[Republic of the Congo]] to the north, and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] to the east and south. The DR Congo territory along the north bank of the Congo River separates Cabinda from the Angolan mainland.

More than 3,500 people of Cabinda live in refugee camps in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in the Republic of the Congo.&lt;ref&gt;[[Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization]]: [http://www.unpo.org/article/2098 ''Cabinda: Refugees From Angola's Cabinda Enclave Cautious About Returning''], March 8, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Background===
The Republic of Cabinda traces its claims to self-sovereignty to its initial status as a Portuguese [[protectorate]], known as the Portuguese Congo&lt;ref name="Conciliation Resources"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.c-r.org/our-work/accord/angola/cabinda.php |title=Cabinda between ‘no peace’ and ‘no war’}}&lt;/ref&gt; This protectorate had a separate history and legal status from that of the much larger [[Portuguese West Africa]], dating to its inception on 19 September 1883. Also, in the [[Treaty of Simulambuco]] and the [[Berlin Conference]] in 1885, Cabinda and Angola were treated as distinct entities.

From inception onwards, Cabinda experienced many changes of status within the Portuguese framework, oscillating between positions of relative autonomy and integration within the greater Colony (or Province) of Angola.

The agreement of turn of the century England with Portugal as to jurisdiction boundaries, reached to counter the French and Belgians next door in the Congos, triggered the [[Scramble for Africa]] when the latter, not to mention the Germans, expressed disagreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=boZbDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2 |title=Beneath the Black Sun of Cabinda| publisher=Sun Press |editor1=Vanessa Everson |editor2=Paige Sorkin |editor3=Jennifer van Dorsten}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relations with Angola===
During the movement for Angolan independence in the 1960s, the situation became more complex. In May 1963 the [[Organization of African Unity]] (OAU) ranked Cabinda as the 39th state still to be decolonized and Angola as the 35th.&lt;ref name=lyle&gt;{{Cite web |publisher=Centennial Universal Congress of Lawyers, Conference Lawyers and Jurists in the 21st Century |url=http://www.cabinda.org/english.htm |title=Blood for oil: Secession, self-determination, and superpower Silence in Cabina |first= Brock |last= Lyle, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1960s, several independence movements advocating a separate status for Cabinda came into being. The [[Movement for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda]] (MLEC) was formed in 1960 under the leadership of [[Luis Ranque Franque]]. Resulting from the merger of various émigré associations in [[Brazzaville]], the MLEC rapidly became the most prominent of the separatist movements. A further group was the Alliama ([[Mayombe National Alliance]]), representing the [[Mayombe]], a small minority of the population. These movements united in August 1963 to form a common, united front called the [[Front for the Liberation of the State of Cabinda]] (FLEC). The leadership role was taken by the MLEC’s Ranque Franque. FLEC established a Cabindan government in exile in [[Kinshasa]]. In marked contrast with the FNLA, the FLEC’s efforts to mobilize international support for its government in exile met with little success. In fact, the majority of OAU members, concerned that this could encourage separatism elsewhere on the continent and duly committed to the sanctity of African state borders, firmly rejected recognition of the FLEC’s government in exile. Later, in the course of Angola's turbulent decolonisation process, Ranque Franque proclaimed the independence of the Republic of Cabinda in [[Kampala]] on 1 August 1975 at an OAU summit which was discussing Angola at that precise moment.&lt;ref name=Pitsch/&gt; [[Zaire|Zair]]ian President [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] called for a referendum on the future of the Cabinda. [[List of heads of government of the Republic of the Congo|Congolese Prime Minister]] [[Henri Lopes]] is reported to have said at the time that "Cabinda exists as a reality and is historically and geographically different from Angola."&lt;ref name="Pitsch"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cabinda.org/histoireang.htm|title=CABINDA : Official site of the Cabindese Government in exile of the F.L.E.C|website=www.cabinda.org|access-date=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Alvor Agreement]], signed on January 15, 1975, granted Angola independence from Portugal on November 11. The agreement, signed by the MPLA, FNLA, UNITA, and the [[Portuguese government]], was never signed by the FLEC or any representatives of Cabinda. MPLA (mainly Cuban) troops entered Cabinda via [[Pointe Noire]] on November 11, 1975 and incorporated Cabinda into Angola proper as "Cabinda Province".&lt;ref name=lyle/&gt; The Alvor Agreement states that "Angola constitutes one indivisible unity. In this context, Cabinda is an integral and inalienable part of Angola."&lt;ref name=lyle/&gt; At the time, Cabinda was producing nearly all of Angola's oil, which accounted for close to half of the nation's [[gross national product]].&lt;ref name=lyle/&gt;

During much of the 1970s and 1980s, FLEC operated a [[low intensity conflict|low intensity]], [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla war]],  attacking Angolan government troops and economic targets or creating havoc by kidnapping foreign employees working in the province’s oil and construction businesses. In July 2006 after ceasefire negotiations in Brazzaville, [[António Bento Bembe]]&amp;nbsp;– as a president of [[Cabindan Forum for Dialogue and Peace]], vice-president and executive secretary of FLEC&amp;nbsp;– announced that the Cabindan separatist forces were ready to declare a ceasefire. The peace was recognized by the [[United States]], [[France]], Portugal, [[Russia]], [[Gabon]], [[DR Congo]], [[Republic of the Congo]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], the [[European Union]] and the African Union.&lt;ref&gt;[[Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization]]: [http://www.unpo.org/article/3070 ''Bembe to UNPO: "The Peace Process in Cabinda Must and Will Continue"''], October 11, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; After the peace agreement, Bento Bembe was elected [[Minister without portfolio]] in the [[Government of Angola]].&lt;ref&gt;Agencia AngolaPress: [http://www.portalangop.co.ao/motix/en_us/noticias/politica/Minister-Bento-Bembe-off-Cabinda-province,7de0d289-a0c9-4819-af4d-c5dda2e34861.html ''Minister Bento Bembe off to Cabinda province ''], 4/2/09&lt;/ref&gt; FLEC-FAC from Paris contends Bembe has no authority or mandate to negotiate with the Angolans and that the only acceptable solution is total independence.&lt;ref&gt;[[IRIN]]: [http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=89930 ''Angola: Cabindan separatists in exile deny end to conflict''], August 12, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reuters AllertNet: [http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/IRIN/9087efa84d9b03b3ffabba0498dc9533.htm ''Angola: The death of one man does not end a war''], April 27, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

During a visit to [[Washington, D.C.]] in February 2003, Angolan President [[José Eduardo dos Santos]] said that he supported a [[referendum]] on Cabindan autonomy. However, he stated he intended to consult the Angolan people as well, who likely will be loath to relinquish sixty percent of their nation's oil revenues. FLEC said that it would only consider an [[East Timor Special Autonomy Referendum|East Timor-type referendum]], which would grant Cabinda total independence.&lt;ref name=lyle/&gt;

===Togo football team bus attack===
{{Main article|Togo national football team bus attack}}

On 8 January 2010, while being escorted by Angolan forces in Cabinda, the team bus of the [[Togo national football team]] was attacked by gunmen as it travelled to the [[2010 Africa Cup of Nations]] tournament. The ensuing gunfight resulted in the deaths of the assistant coach, team spokesman and bus driver, as well as injuring several others.

An offshoot of the FLEC claimed responsibility. [[Rodrigues Mingas]], secretary general of the Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda-Military Position (FLEC-PM), said that his fighters had meant to attack security guards as the convoy passed through Cabinda. "This attack was not aimed at the Togolese players but at the Angolan forces at the head of the convoy," Mingas told [[France 24]] television. "So it was pure chance that the gunfire hit the players. We don't have anything to do with the Togolese and we present our condolences to the African families and the Togo government. We are fighting for the total liberation of Cabinda." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/11/two-arrested-togo-football-attack | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Togo footballers were attacked by mistake, Angolan rebels say | first=James | last=Sturcke | date=January 11, 2010 | accessdate=April 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  FLEC released its version of the events of January 8 which suggests that elements of the Angolan secret police and their Cabindan agents were responsible for the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/79054182/January-8-Executive-Report-on-Angolan-State-Terrorism| title=Republic of Kabinda Report on January 8, 2010 Incident}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13420">The "'''Schlesinger Doctrine'''" is the name, given by the press, to a major re-alignment of [[United States]] [[Nuclear strategy|nuclear strike policy]] that was announced in January 1974 by the [[US Secretary of Defense]], [[James Schlesinger]]. It outlined a broad selection of [[counterforce]] options against a wide variety of potential enemy actions, a major change from earlier [[Single Integrated Operational Plan|SIOP]] policies of the Kennedy and Johnson eras that focused on [[Mutually Assured Destruction]] and typically included only one or two "all out" plans of action that used the entire U.S. nuclear arsenal in a single strike. A key element of the new plans were a variety of limited strikes solely against enemy military targets while ensuring the survivability of the U.S. second-strike capability, which was intended to leave an opening for a negotiated settlement.

==Background==
===Wargasm===
The first coordinated nuclear attack policy in the United States was codified as SIOP-62 at the prompting of the [[President's Science Advisory Committee|Science Advisor]] in the [[Eisenhower Administration]], [[George Kistiakowsky]]. Prior to SIOP-62, each of the U.S.'s military branches had drawn up their own target lists and action plans, which led to a wide variety of [[Overkill (term)|overkill]] situations and the possibility of [[blue-on-blue fire]]. After Kistiakowsky reported on the problems this caused, Eisenhower took nuclear planning away from the individual branches, centralized it, and gave it to [[RAND]] for extensive oversight.

However, the plan that developed was still based on the same basic concept of an all-out war, or what [[Herman Kahn]] referred to as a "wargasm".&lt;ref&gt;Henry Sokolski (ed), "Getting Mad: Nuclear Mutual Assured Destruction, Its Origins and Practice", Introduction by Henry S. Rowen, Strategic Studies Institute, November 2004&lt;/ref&gt; SIOP-62 called for a single coordinated attack that used up all of the U.S.'s arsenal on a wide variety of targets in the [[Soviet Union]] and [[China]]. Concerns about the inflexibility of the plan were expressed early and often; [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine]] Commandant [[David Shoup]] noted that an attack by the Soviets would result in a retaliation that included China whether or not they were involved, and observed that "any plan that kills millions of Chinese when it isn't even their war is not a good plan. This is not the American way."&lt;ref name=NSAEBB130-25&gt;{{citation

===Flexible response===
In the late 1950s a number of parties pointed out another serious problem with the all-or-nothing approach. If the Soviets launched a limited attack against isolated U.S. military targets, they could cause significant damage to the U.S.'s own nuclear forces without causing serious civilian casualties. If such an attack was successful, the Soviets would still have the capability of launching a second strike against U.S. cities, while the U.S. would be so reduced in power that their only militarily effective response would be an attack on Soviet cities, knowing the Soviets would respond. This would leave the Soviets in an extremely advantageous position for a negotiated peace.&lt;ref name=moral&gt;Lackey, Douglas, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Zr2AhJTZzgIC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;lpg=PA68&amp;dq=Schlesinger+Doctrine&amp;source=web&amp;ots=yuTNoAS8aZ&amp;sig=GPaK-0APB4TmvBRbF8kdD14wsfY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ct=result#PPA67,M1 "Nuclear Weapons, Politics and Strategy, A Short History"], ''Moral Principles of Nuclear Weapons'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1986, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; SIOP-62 simply had no response to this threat.

The "solution" to this problem was developed under the Kennedy Administration, and consisted of responding to limited attacks in kind. In this case, if the same scenario were to develop, the Soviets would be placed in the extremely uncomfortable position of having to allow the U.S. counterattack to land and damage their own forces, or immediately launching as soon as the attack was discovered. Neither course of action would preserve any advantage, and so it was believed this policy would render the limited attack untenable. As early as 1962 [[Robert McNamara]] had proposed a flexible strategy starting with a number of limited counterforce strikes before proceeding to full-out exchanges.&lt;ref name=moral/&gt; These plans, codified in SIOP-62, remained virtually unchanged for over a decade.

===MAD===
However, as nuclear forces moved from bombers to [[ICBM]]s with limited accuracy but high survivability, the ability to carry out a counterforce strike while the enemy forces were still on the ground became increasingly difficult. This difficulty further increased with every new iteration of missile, which continued to reduce reaction time to the point where catching them still in their silos would be extremely difficult. As these weapons were, at the time at least, relatively inaccurate, they were limited primarily to [[countervalue]] attacks on the enemy's cities, further eroding the idea of a limited attack against them being responded to in-kind.

As a result of these technical changes, the idea of flexible response ossified, while [[mutually assured destruction]] (MAD) became the primary strategic concept of the era.&lt;ref name=moral/&gt; McNamara became a major proponent of MAD, and used it as a reason to cancel other nuclear delivery systems, like the [[B-1 Lancer]] bomber. In testimony before Congress he stated that "''The strategic missile forces for 1967-71 will provide more force than is required for 'Assured Destruction' ... a new advanced strategic aircraft does not at this time appear justified.''"&lt;ref name=fas&gt;[http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/usa/bomber/b-1a.htm B-1A page], fas.org. Retrieved: 20 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the rise of MAD, all of the earlier problems with the "wargasm" approach returned. Adding to the problems, the U.S. now had obligations under various treaties to protect allies using their nuclear arms, the so-called "nuclear umbrella". This meant that the Soviets could launch a limited attack against an ally, leaving the U.S. with the choice of backing down, or accepting a full-scale exchange.

In June 1969 Kissinger briefed Nixon on the problem of MAD, and Nixon later addressed the issue in Congress in February 1970, stating "Should a President, in the event of a nuclear attack, be left with the single option of ordering the mass destruction of enemy civilians, in the face of the certainty that it would be followed by the mass slaughter of Americans?"&lt;ref&gt;James Schlesinger, [http://www.airforce-magazine.com/MagazineArchive/Documents/2006/February%202006/0206keeper.pdf "Strategic Forces"], Annual Defense Department Report, 4 March 1974&lt;/ref&gt; Kissinger and Nixon developed plans for a return to a flexible response strategy, but had to put these plans on hold until the [[Vietnam War]] ended.

==Schlesinger's reforms==
Nominated by [[Richard Nixon]] on May 10, 1973, Schlesinger became Secretary of Defense on July 2. As a university professor, researcher at Rand, and government official in three agencies, he had acquired an impressive background in national security affairs.

Analyzing U.S. nuclear strategy, Schlesinger noted that the policies developed in the 1950s and 1960s were based on an overwhelming U.S. lead in nuclear forces. The plans focussed on doing as much damage to the USSR and its allies as possible, regardless of the actions the Soviets might take in response. Schlesinger stated that "deterrence is not a substitute for defense; defense capabilities, representing the potential for effective counteraction, are the essential condition of deterrence.&lt;ref  name=bio&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/specials/secdef_histories/bios/schlesinger.htm "James R. Schlesinger, 12th Secretary of Defense"]&lt;/ref&gt; He expressed grave doubts about the entire concept of [[mutually assured destruction]] (MAD).

Schlesinger felt that a credible deterrence would need to be based on several conditions; the U.S. would need to maintain some level of force parity with the USSR, the force would have to be highly survivable, and based on its survivability, there should be a wide range of plans that would not boil down to one of a number of different massive attacks. His new strategy was based on a number of limited counterforce attacks that would "limit the chances of uncontrolled escalation" and "hit meaningful targets" without causing widespread collateral damage.&lt;ref  name=bio/&gt; In most of these plans, majority of the U.S.'s nuclear force would be withheld in the hope that the enemy would not attack U.S. cities, while still inflicting serious military damage that might end any ongoing actions. He explicitly disavowed any intention to acquire a first-strike capability against the USSR.

Schlesinger described the new doctrine as having three main aspects:
:#The National Command Authority or its successors should have many choices about the use of weapons, always having an option to escalate.
:#Targeting should make it very explicit that the first requisite is selective retaliation against the enemy's military (i.e., tailored counterforce).
:#Some targets and target classes should not be struck, at least at first, to give the opponent a rational reason to terminate the conflict. Reduced collateral damage was another benefit of this "withhold" method. Nixon codified the basic concept as part of NSDM-242, which came into force as SIOP-5 in 1976.&lt;ref name=Cimbala1984&gt;{{citation

 | first = Stephen J. | last = Cimbala
 | url = http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/aureview/1984/sep-oct/cimbala.html
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to meet the needs of SIOP-5, a number of changes were made to the U.S. force structure. The [[B-1 Lancer|B-1 bomber]], recently cancelled, was brought back in order to provide a survivable strike option that could be launched as a show of U.S. intent. Additionally, Schlesinger put an emphasis on short range weapons that had clear counterforce capability, whose use would not signify an all-out countervalue attack. This led to further work on systems like the [[Pershing II]] and various basing arrangements in Europe that would not reach fruition until the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Siracusa, David Coleman, [https://books.google.com/books?id=gZvuTlm-IK0C&amp;pg=PA210&amp;lpg=PA210&amp;dq=Schlesinger+Doctrine&amp;source=web&amp;ots=JumMSfCffT&amp;sig=1mUlidlga_jKxUsfI5QMN1-tYR8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result "Chapter 10: White House Under Siege"], ''Depression to Cold War'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
The basic outline of the Schlesinger Doctrine remained in effect until the period of rapid disarmament in the 1980s, although it saw numerous modifications. Throughout this period it remained highly controversial for a variety of reasons.

The announcement of the Doctrine immediately caused problems during the [[SALT I]] negotiations. At the start of negotiations, the U.S. delegation had assured their Soviet counterparts that the U.S. was not seeking a counterforce ability, but the Schlesinger Doctrine clearly stated that they were. During the June 1974 summit, [[Leonid Brezhnev]] vehemently criticized the Doctrine as a threat to the Soviet's forces, whose parity was a key concept of the SALT negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;April Carter, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z3vLPuAV4lcC&amp;pg=PA141&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;dq=Schlesinger+Doctrine&amp;source=web&amp;ots=Ya5N0pg9oB&amp;sig=yWhHPsb72U3RsjapR_spwBBbjaI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ct=result#PPA141,M1 "SALT II: The obstacles Multiply"], ''Success and Failure in Arms Control Negotiations'', Oxford University Press, 1989, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; Schlesinger's concerns about the SALT process would eventually lead to his resignation in 1975.&lt;ref  name=bio/&gt;

Another concern was that while Schlesinger stated the U.S. would not invest in first strike weapons, through the 1970s and 1980s a number of weapon systems were developed that would be only be useful in a first strike scenario. The most obvious example was the [[AGM-86 ALCM]] [[cruise missile]], a highly accurate weapon designed primarily to attack hardened military targets. Observers both in the USSR and elsewhere, noted that such a weapon was only really useful in a "sneak attack" scenario, which would allow it to attack [[ICBM]] sites and thereby so reduce the Soviet's own counterforce abilities to render them impotent. In a mutually assured destruction scenario, those targets would have already been hit by ICBMs or SLBMs.

In [[agriculture]] and [[gardening]], '''seed saving''' (sometimes known as '''brown bagging'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.americanfarm.com/publications/the-delmarva-farmer/special-sections/1821-monsanto-farmers-permitted-to-brown-bag-seeds|author=Bruce Hotchkiss|title=Monsanto: Farmers permitted to ‘brown bag’ seeds|publisher=American Farm Publications, Inc.|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the practice of saving seeds or other reproductive material (e.g. [[tuber]]s) from [[vegetable]]s, [[grain]], [[herb]]s, and [[flower]]s for use from year to year for annuals and [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]], [[Fruit|tree fruits]], and [[Berry|berries]] for perennials and trees.&lt;ref name="Mechlem"&gt;{{cite book

In recent decades, beginning in the latter part of the 20th century, there has been a major shift to purchasing seed annually from commercial seed suppliers.  Much of the [[grassroots]] seed-saving activity today is the work of home gardeners.

==Method==
To be successful at seed saving, new skills need to be developed to ensure that desired characteristics are retained in the [[landrace]]s of the plant variety. Important considerations are the separation distance needed from plants of the same species to ensure that cross-pollination with another variety does not occur, and the [[Genetic drift|minimum number]] of plants to be grown which will preserve inherent genetic diversity. It is also necessary to recognize the preferred characteristics of the cultivar being grown so that plants that are [[Volunteer (botany)|not breeding true]] are selected against, and to understand the [[Selective breeding|breeding of improvements]] to the cultivar. [[Plant pathology|Diseases]] that are seed-borne must be recognized so that they can be eliminated. [[Seedbank|Seed storage]] methods must be good enough to maintain viability of the seed. [[Germination]] requirements must be known so that periodic tests can be made.

Care must be taken, as training materials regarding seed production, cleaning, storage, and maintenance often focus on making landraces more uniform, distinct and stable (usually for commercial application) which can result in the loss of valuable adaptive traits unique to local varieties.&lt;ref&gt;Jarvis, D., B. Sthapit, and L. Sears (eds.). 2000. Conserving agricultural biodiversity in situ: a scientific basis for sustainable agriculture. Proceedings of a workshop. Rome, Italy: IPGRI&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, there is a matter of localized nature to be considered.
In the upper northern hemisphere, and lower southern, one sees a seasonal change in terms of a cooler winter. Many plants go-to-seed and then go dormant. These seeds must hibernate until their respective spring season.

==Open pollination==
[[Open pollination]] is an important aspect of seed saving. Plants that reproduce through natural means tend to adapt to local conditions over time, and evolve as reliable performers, particularly in their localities, known as [[landrace]]s or "folk varieties."

==Legality==

While saving seed and even exchanging seed with other farmers for [[biodiversity]] purposes has been a traditional practice, these practices have become illegal for the plant varieties that are patented or otherwise owned by some entity (often a corporation).&lt;ref name="Mechlem"/&gt; Under Article 28 of the World Trade Organization (WTO) [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] (the TRIPS Agreement), "planting, harvesting, saving, re-planting, and exchanging seeds of patented plants, or of plants containing patented cells and genes, constitutes use" and can in some cases be prohibited by the [[intellectual property law]]s of WTO Members.&lt;ref name="Mechlem"/&gt;

Significantly, farmers in [[developing countries]] are particularly affected by prohibitions on seed saving. There are some protections for re-use, called "farmer's privilege", in the 1991 [[International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants]] (UPOV Convention), but seed exchange remains prohibited.&lt;ref name="Mechlem"/&gt;

In the [[United States]], the farmer's privilege to save seeds to grow subsequent crops was considered protected by the [[Plant Variety Protection Act of 1970]]. American farmers, it was thought, could sell seed up to the amount saved for replanting their own acreage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|isbn=92-9043-499-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The PVPA permits farmers to save seeds and grow crops from them without liability under the PVPA. But if the seeds are also protected by a utility patent, that conduct is now patent infringement. See ''[[Bowman v. Monsanto Co.]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

That view came to an end in the latter part of the 20th century and early part of the 21st century, with changes in technology and law. First, in 1981 ''[[Diamond v. Chakrabarty]]'' established that companies may obtain patents for life-forms—originally genetically engineered unicellular bacteria.&lt;ref&gt; The genetically engineered bacteria ate oil, as in oil spills.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 ''[[J.E.M. Ag Supply v. Pioneer]]'' established that valid utility patents could be issued on sexually reproduced plants, such as seed crops (e.g., corn).&lt;ref&gt;http://neuro.law.cornell.edu/supct/search/display.html?terms=patent&amp;url=/supct/html/99-1996.ZS.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In that case J.E.M. was held liable because it resold purchased corn in violation of a "label license" forbidding resale or any use except planting a corn crop.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 ''[[Bowman v. Monsanto Co.]]'' established that it was patent infringement for farmers to save crop seeds (soybeans in that case) and grow subsequent crops from them, if the seeds or plants were patented. Seed corporations are able to earn massive profits from this control over commercial seed supplies, and consequently further loss of control has been taken from US farmers over their farm production process. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mascarenhas|first=Michael|last2=Busch|first2=Lawrence|date=2006-04-01|title=Seeds of Change: Intellectual Property Rights, Genetically Modified Soybeans and Seed Saving in the United States|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9523.2006.00406.x/abstract|journal=Sociologia Ruralis|language=en|volume=46|issue=2|pages=122–138|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9523.2006.00406.x|issn=1467-9523}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Shan State National Army''' ({{lang-my|ရှမ်းပြည် အမျိုးသား တပ်မတော်}}; [[Abbreviation|abbreviated]] '''SSNA''') was a [[Shan nationalist]] [[Insurgency|insurgent group]] that fought against the then ruling [[State Peace and Development Council]] [[military regime]] of [[Myanmar]] (Burma). The commander of the SSNA was Colonel Kan Yod.

==History==
The Shan State National Army was formed on 7 July 1995 by disgruntled members of [[Khun Sa]]'s [[Mong Tai Army]] (MTA). The group claimed the MTA was too focused on [[narcotics trafficking|trafficking narcotics]] from China into Myanmar, rather than focusing on the self-determination of the [[Shan people]]. The two leaders and 500 other insurgents decided split from the MTA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/mar/chronology.asp?groupId=77507 Chronology for Shans in Burma] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601200223/http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/mar/chronology.asp?groupId=77507 |date=1 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By September 1995, around 2,000 more insurgents had joined the SSNA, leaving the MTA headquarters at Ha Mong and establishing a base in the town of [[Hsipaw]]. The Mong Tai Army eventually surrendered to government forces and disbanded after the mass desertion. The SSNA signed a [[ceasefire]] with the government at the end of 1995.

===2005 government operation===
In April 2005, soldiers of the [[Tatmadaw]] and the [[United Wa State Army]] conducted a joint operation against the headquarters of the SSNA, resulting in the arrest most of their leaders. On the 11 April 2005 and 19 May 2005, two brigades of the SSNA surrendered and disarmed after being instructed by the Tatmadaw to leave the area to government forces. Following the operation, SSNA commander Sai Yi and about 5,000 to 6,000 soldiers left the SSNA and joined the [[Shan State Army - South]] (SSA-S), led by Colonel [[Yawd Serk]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shanland.org/politics/2005/document.2005-06-17.5636742122 Thousands of troops from the former Shan State National Army have recently arrived in the south to resume the armed struggle] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211134700/http://www.shanland.org/politics/2005/document.2005-06-17.5636742122 |date=11 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shanland.org/war/2005/statement_on_shan_state_national.htm/?searchterm=ssna|title=Statement on Shan State National Army and Shan State Army|publisher=|accessdate=29 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141204151709/http://www.shanland.org/war/2005/statement_on_shan_state_national.htm/?searchterm=ssna|archivedate=4 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shan rebels unite against Rangoon|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/burmese/highlights/story/2005/05/050524_ssa_ssna_unite.shtml|work=[[BBC]] Burmese|date=24 May 2005|accessdate=7 February 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120723084718/www.bbc.co.uk/burmese/highlights/story/2005/05/050524_ssa_ssna_unite.shtml|archivedate=23 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of Namibia}}

The '''South African Border War''', also known as the '''Namibian War of Independence''', and sometimes denoted in South Africa as the '''Angolan Bush War''', was a largely [[Asymmetric warfare|asymmetric conflict]] that occurred in [[Namibia]] (then [[South West Africa]]), [[Zambia]], and [[Angola]] from 26 August 1966 to 21 March 1990. It was fought between the [[South African Defence Force]] (SADF) and the [[People's Liberation Army of Namibia]] (PLAN), an armed wing of the [[South West African People's Organisation]] (SWAPO). The South African Border War resulted in some of the largest battles on the African continent since [[World War II]] and was closely intertwined with the [[Angolan Civil War]].

Following several decades of unsuccessful petitioning through the [[United Nations]] and the [[International Court of Justice]] for Namibian independence, SWAPO formed the PLAN in 1962 with material assistance from the [[Soviet Union]], the [[People's Republic of China]], and sympathetic African states such as [[Tanzania]], [[Ghana]], and [[Algeria]].&lt;ref name="Koevoet1"&gt;{{cite book|title=Koevoet!

{{Military history of South Africa}}

==Nomenclature==
Various names have been applied to the undeclared conflict waged by South Africa in [[Angola]] and [[Namibia]] (then [[South West Africa]]) from the mid 1960s to the late 1980s. The term "South African Border War" has typically denoted the military campaign launched by the [[People's Liberation Army of Namibia]] (PLAN), which took the form of sabotage and rural insurgency, as well as the external raids launched by South African troops on suspected PLAN bases inside Angola or Zambia, sometimes involving major conventional warfare against the [[People's Armed Forces of Liberation of Angola]] (FAPLA) and its [[Cuba]]n allies.&lt;ref name=Narrative/&gt; The strategic situation was further complicated by the fact that South Africa occupied large swathes of Angola for extended periods in support of the [[National Union for the Total Independence of Angola]] (UNITA), making the "Border War" an increasingly inseparable conflict from the parallel [[Angolan Civil War]].&lt;ref name=Narrative/&gt;

"Border War" entered public discourse in South Africa during the late 1970s, and was adopted thereafter by the country's ruling [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]].&lt;ref name=Narrative/&gt; Due to the covert nature of most [[South African Defence Force]] (SADF) operations inside Angola, the term was favoured as a means of omitting any reference to clashes on foreign soil. Where tactical aspects of various engagements were discussed, military historians simply identified the conflict as the "bush war".&lt;ref name=Narrative/&gt;&lt;ref name="Escandon"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Bush War: The Use of Surrogates in Southern Africa (1975–1989)  |last=Escandon|first=Joseph|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a505143.pdf|location=Fort Leavenworth, Kansas|publisher=United States Army Command and General Staff College|year=2009|accessdate=4 January 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110224326/http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a505143.pdf|archivedate=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[South West African People's Organisation]] (SWAPO) has described the South African Border War as the Namibian War of National Liberation&lt;ref name=Narrative/&gt; and the Namibian Liberation Struggle.&lt;ref name=Dobell&gt;{{cite book|last=Dobell|first=Lauren|title=Swapo's Struggle for Namibia, 1960–1991: War by Other Means|year=1998|pages=27–39|publisher=P. Schlettwein Publishing Switzerland|location=Basel|isbn=978-3908193029}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Namibian context it is also commonly referred to as the Namibian War of Independence. However, these terms have been criticised for ignoring the wider regional implications of the war and the fact that PLAN was based in, and did most of its fighting from, countries other than Namibia.&lt;ref name=Narrative/&gt;

==Background==
Namibia was governed as [[German South West Africa]], a colony of the [[German Empire]], until [[World War I]], when it was invaded and occupied by [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] forces under General [[Louis Botha]]. Following the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918]], a [[League of Nations mandate|mandate system]] was imposed by the [[League of Nations]] to govern African and Asian territories held by Germany and the [[Ottoman Empire]] prior to the war.&lt;ref name=Rajagopal&gt;{{cite book|last=Rajagopal|first=Balakrishnan|title=International Law from Below: Development, Social Movements and Third World Resistance|year=2003|pages=50–68|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0521016711}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mandate system was formed as a compromise between those who advocated an Allied annexation of former German and Turkish territories, and another proposition put forward by those who wished to grant them to an international trusteeship until they could govern themselves.&lt;ref name=Rajagopal/&gt;

All former German and Turkish territories were classified into three types of mandates – Class "A" mandates, predominantly in the Middle East, Class "B" mandates, which encompassed central Africa, and Class "C" mandates, which were reserved for the most sparsely populated or least developed German colonies: South West Africa, [[German New Guinea]], and the Pacific islands.&lt;ref name=Rajagopal/&gt;

Owing to their small size, geographic remoteness, low population densities, or physical contiguity to the mandatory itself, Class "C" mandates could be administered as integral provinces of the countries to which they were entrusted. Nevertheless, the bestowal of a mandate by the League of Nations did not confer full sovereignty, only the responsibility of administering it.&lt;ref name=Rajagopal/&gt; In principle mandating countries were only supposed to hold these former colonies "in trust" for their inhabitants, until they were sufficiently prepared for their own self-determination. Under these terms, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand were granted the German Pacific islands, and the [[Union of South Africa]] received South West Africa.&lt;ref name=Louis&gt;{{cite book|last=Louis|first=William Roger|title=Ends of British Imperialism: The Scramble for Empire, Suez, and Decolonization|year=2006|pages=251–261|publisher=I.B. Tauris &amp; Company, Ltd|location=London|isbn=978-1845113476}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It soon became apparent the South African government had interpreted the mandate as a veiled annexation.&lt;ref name=Louis/&gt; In September 1922, South African prime minister [[Jan Smuts]] testified before the League of Nations Mandate Commission that South West Africa was being fully incorporated into the Union and should be regarded, for all practical purposes, as a fifth province of South Africa.&lt;ref name=Louis/&gt; According to Smuts, this constituted "annexation in all but in name".&lt;ref name=Louis/&gt;

Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, the League of Nations complained that of all the mandatory powers South Africa was the most delinquent with regards to observing the terms of its mandate.&lt;ref name=First&gt;{{cite book|last=First|first=Ruth|editor1-last=Segal|editor1-first=Ronald|title=South West Africa|year=1963|pages=169–193|publisher=Penguin Books, Incorporated|location=Baltimore|isbn=978-0844620619}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mandate Commission vetoed a number of ambitious South African policy decisions, such as proposals to nationalise South West African railways or alter the preexisting borders.&lt;ref name=First/&gt; Sharp criticism was also leveled at South Africa's disproportionate spending on the local [[White Namibians|white population]], which the former defended as obligatory since white South West Africans were taxed the heaviest.&lt;ref name=First/&gt; The League adopted the argument that no one segment of any mandate's population was entitled to favourable treatment over another, and the terms under which the mandate had been granted made no provision for special obligation towards whites.&lt;ref name=First/&gt; It pointed out that there was little evidence of progress being made towards political self-determination; just prior to [[World War II]] South Africa and the League remained at an impasse over this dispute.&lt;ref name=First/&gt;

===Legality of South West Africa, 1946–1960===

After World War II, Jan Smuts headed the South African delegation to the [[United Nations Conference on International Organization]]. As a result of this conference, the League of Nations was formally superseded by the [[United Nations]] (UN) and former League mandates by a trusteeship system. Article 77 of the [[United Nations Charter]] stated that UN trusteeship "shall apply...to territories now held under mandate"; furthermore, it would "be a matter of subsequent agreement as to which territories in the foregoing territories will be brought under the trusteeship system and under what terms".&lt;ref name=Vandenbosch&gt;{{cite book|last=Vandenbosch|first=Amry|title=South Africa and the World: The Foreign Policy of Apartheid|year=1970|pages=207–224|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|location=Lexington|isbn=978-0813164946}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smuts was suspicious of the proposed trusteeship, largely because of the vague terminology in Article 77.&lt;ref name=First/&gt; Heaton Nicholls, the South African high commissioner in the [[United Kingdom]] and a member of the Smuts delegation to the UN, addressed the newly formed UN [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] on 17 January 1946.&lt;ref name=Vandenbosch/&gt;

Nicholls stated that the legal uncertainty of South West Africa's situation was retarding development and discouraging foreign investment; however, self-determination for the time being was impossible since the territory was too undeveloped and underpopulated to function as a strong independent state.&lt;ref name=Vandenbosch/&gt; In the second part of the first session of the General Assembly, the floor was handed to Smuts, who declared that the mandate was essentially a part of the South African territory and people.&lt;ref name=Vandenbosch/&gt; Smuts informed the General Assembly that it had already been so thoroughly incorporated with South Africa a UN-sanctioned annexation was no more than a necessary formality.&lt;ref name=Vandenbosch/&gt;

The Smuts delegation's request for the termination of the mandate and permission to annex South West Africa was not well received by the General Assembly.&lt;ref name=Vandenbosch/&gt; Five other countries, including three major colonial powers, had agreed to place their mandates under the trusteeship of the UN, at least in principle; South Africa alone refused. Most delegates insisted it was undesirable to endorse the annexation of a mandated territory, especially when all of the others had entered trusteeship.&lt;ref name=First/&gt; Thirty-seven member states voted to block a South African annexation of South West Africa; nine abstained.&lt;ref name=First/&gt;

In Pretoria, right-wing politicians reacted with outrage at what they perceived as unwarranted UN interference in the South West Africa affair. The National Party dismissed the UN as unfit to meddle with South Africa's policies or discuss its administration of the mandate.&lt;ref name=First/&gt; One National Party speaker, [[Eric Louw]], demanded that South West Africa be annexed unilaterally.&lt;ref name=First/&gt; During the [[South African general election, 1948]], the National Party was swept into power, newly appointed Prime Minister [[Daniel Malan]] prepared to adopt a more aggressive stance concerning annexation, and Louw was named ambassador to the UN. During an address in [[Windhoek]], Malan reiterated his party's position that South Africa would annex the mandate before surrendering it to an international trusteeship.&lt;ref name=First/&gt; The following year a formal statement was issued to the General Assembly which proclaimed that South Africa had no intention of complying with trusteeship, nor was it obligated to release new information or reports pertaining to its administration.&lt;ref name=Crawford1&gt;{{cite book|last=Crawford|first=Neta|title=Argument and Change in World Politics: Ethics, Decolonization, and Humanitarian Intervention|year=2002|pages=333–336|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0521002790}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, the South West Africa Affairs Administration Act, 1949, was passed by South African parliament. The new legislation gave white South West Africans parliamentary representation and the same political rights as white South Africans.&lt;ref name=Crawford1/&gt;

The UN General Assembly responded by deferring to the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ), which was to issue an advisory opinion on the international status of South West Africa.&lt;ref name=First/&gt; The ICJ ruled that South West Africa was still being governed as a mandate; hence, South Africa was not legally obligated to surrender it to the UN trusteeship system if it did not recognise the mandate system had lapsed, conversely, however, it was still bound by the provisions of the original mandate. Adherence to these provisions meant South Africa was not empowered to unilaterally modify the international status of South West Africa.&lt;ref name=Crawford1/&gt; Malan and his government rejected the court's opinion as irrelevant.&lt;ref name=First/&gt; The UN formed a Committee on South West Africa, which issued its own independent reports regarding the administration and development of that territory. The Committee's reports became increasingly scathing of South African officials when the National Party imposed its harsh system of racial segregation and stratification—''[[apartheid]]''—on South West Africa.&lt;ref name=Crawford1/&gt;

In 1958, the UN established a Good Offices Committee which continued to invite South Africa to bring South West Africa under trusteeship.&lt;ref name=Crawford1/&gt; The Good Offices Committee proposed a partition of the mandate, allowing South Africa to annex the southern portion while either granting independence to the north, including the densely populated [[Ovamboland]] region, or administering it as an international trust territory.&lt;ref name=First/&gt; The proposal met with overwhelming opposition in the General Assembly; fifty-six nations voted against it. Any further partition of South West Africa was rejected out of hand.&lt;ref name=First/&gt;

===Internal opposition to South African rule===
Mounting internal opposition to apartheid played an instrumental role in the development and militancy of a South West African nationalist movement throughout the mid to late 1950s.&lt;ref name="Müller"&gt;{{cite book|last=Müller|first=Johann Alexander|title=The Inevitable Pipeline Into Exile. Botswana's Role in the Namibian Liberation Struggle|year=2012|pages=36–41|publisher=Basler Afrika Bibliographien Namibia Resource Center and Southern Africa Library|location=Basel, Switzerland|isbn=978-3905758290}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1952 [[Defiance Campaign]], a series of nonviolent protests launched by the [[African National Congress]] against [[pass laws]], inspired the formation of South West African student unions opposed to apartheid.&lt;ref name=Dobell/&gt; In 1955, their members organised the South West African Progressive Association (SWAPA), chaired by Uatja Kaukuetu, to campaign for South West African independence. Although SWAPA did not garner widespread support beyond intellectual circles, it was the first nationalist body claiming to support the interests of all black South West Africans, irrespective of tribe or language.&lt;ref name="Müller"/&gt; SWAPA's activists were predominantly [[Herero people|Herero]] students, schoolteachers, and other members of the emerging black [[intelligentsia]] in Windhoek.&lt;ref name=Dobell/&gt; Meanwhile, the [[Ovamboland People's Organization|Ovamboland People's Congress]] (later the ''Ovamboland People's Organisation'', or OPO) was formed by nationalists among partly urbanised migrant [[Ovambo people|Ovambo]] labourers in [[Cape Town]]. The OPO's constitution cited the achievement of a UN trusteeship and ultimate South West African independence as its primary goals.&lt;ref name=Dobell/&gt; A unified movement was proposed that would include the politicisation of Ovambo contract workers from northern South West Africa as well as the Herero students, which resulted in the unification of SWAPA and the OPO as the [[South West African National Union]] (SWANU) on 27 September 1959.&lt;ref name="Müller"/&gt;

In December 1959, the South African government announced that it would forcibly relocate all residents of [[Old Location]], a black neighbourhood located near Windhoek's city center, in accordance with apartheid legislation. SWANU responded by organising mass demonstrations and a bus boycott on 10 December, and in the ensuing confrontation South African police opened fire, killing eleven protestors.&lt;ref name="Müller"/&gt; In the wake of the Old Location incident, the OPO split from SWANU, citing differences with the organisation's Herero leadership, then petitioning UN delegates in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="Müller"/&gt; As the UN and potential foreign supporters reacted sensitively to any implications of tribalism and had favoured SWANU for its claim to represent the South West African people as a whole, the OPO was likewise rebranded the [[South West African People's Organization|South West African People's Organisation]].&lt;ref name="Müller"/&gt; It later opened its ranks to all South West Africans sympathetic to its aims.&lt;ref name=Dobell/&gt;

[[File:Sam Nujoma Romcrop2.jpg|thumb|upright=1|[[Sam Nujoma]], founder and leader of SWAPO and its OPO predecessor.]]
SWAPO leaders soon went abroad to mobilise support for their goals within the international community and newly independent African states in particular. The movement scored a major diplomatic success when it was recognised by [[Tanzania]] and allowed to open an office in [[Dar es Salaam]].&lt;ref name="Müller"/&gt; SWAPO's first manifesto, released in July 1960, was remarkably similar to SWANU's. Both advocated the abolition of colonialism and all forms of racialism, the promotion of [[Pan-Africanism]], and called for the "economic, social, and cultural advancement" of South West Africans. However, SWAPO went a step further by demanding immediate independence under black majority rule, to be granted at a date no later than 1963.&lt;ref name=Dobell/&gt; The SWAPO manifesto also promised [[universal suffrage]], sweeping welfare programmes, free healthcare, free public education, the nationalisation of all major industry, and the forcible redistribution of foreign-owned land "in accordance with African communal ownership principles".&lt;ref name=Dobell/&gt;

Compared to SWANU, SWAPO's potential for wielding political influence within South West Africa was limited, and it was likelier to accept armed insurrection as the primary means of achieving its goals accordingly.&lt;ref name="Müller"/&gt; SWAPO leaders also argued that a decision to take up arms against the South Africans would demonstrate their superior commitment to the nationalist cause. This would also distinguish SWAPO from SWANU in the eyes of international supporters as the genuine vanguard of the Namibian independence struggle, and the legitimate recipient of any material assistance that was forthcoming.&lt;ref name=Dobell/&gt; Modelled after [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]], the armed wing of the African National Congress,&lt;ref name="Müller"/&gt; the South West African Liberation Army (SWALA) was formed by SWAPO in 1962. The first seven SWALA recruits were sent from Dar Es Salaam to [[Egypt]] and the [[Soviet Union]], where they received military instruction.&lt;ref name=Camp/&gt; Upon their return they began training guerrillas at a makeshift camp established for housing South West African refugees in [[Kongwa District|Kongwa]], Tanzania.&lt;ref name=Camp/&gt;

===Cold War tensions and the border militarisation===

The increasing likelihood of armed conflict in South West Africa had strong international foreign policy implications, for both Western Europe and the Soviet bloc.&lt;ref name=Caprivi&gt;{{cite book|last=Kangumu|first=Bennett|title=Contesting Caprivi: A History of Colonial Isolation and Regional Nationalism in Namibia|year=2011|pages=143–153|publisher=Basler Afrika Bibliographien Namibia Resource Center and Southern Africa Library|location=Basel|isbn=978-3905758221}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the late 1950s, South Africa's defence policy had been influenced by international [[Cold War]] politics, including the [[domino theory]] and fears of a conventional Soviet military threat to the strategic Cape trade route between the south Atlantic and Indian oceans.&lt;ref name=Berridge&gt;{{cite book|last=Berridge|first=G.R.|title=South Africa, the Colonial Powers and African Defence: The Rise and Fall of the White Entente, 1948–60|year=1992|pages=1–16, 163–164|publisher=Palgrave Books|location=Basingstoke|isbn=978-0333563519}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noting that the country had become the world's principal source of [[uranium]], the South African Department of External Affairs reasoned that "on this account alone, therefore, South Africa is bound to be implicated in any war between East and West".&lt;ref name=Berridge/&gt; Prime Minister Malan took the position that colonial Africa was being directly threatened by the Soviets, or at least by Soviet-backed communist agitation, and this was only likely to increase whatever the result of another European war.&lt;ref name=Berridge/&gt; Malan promoted an African Pact, similar to NATO, headed by South Africa and the Western colonial powers accordingly. The concept failed due to international opposition to apartheid and suspicion of South African military overtures in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]].&lt;ref name=Berridge/&gt;

South Africa's involvement in the [[Korean War]] produced a significant warming of relations between Malan and the United States, despite American criticism of apartheid.&lt;ref name=Lulat/&gt; Until the early 1960s, South African strategic and military support was considered an integral component of U.S. foreign policy in Africa's southern subcontinent, and there was a steady flow of defence technology from Washington to Pretoria.&lt;ref name=Lulat/&gt; American and Western European interest in the defence of Africa from a hypothetical, external communist invasion dissipated after it became clear that the nuclear arms race was making global conventional war increasingly less likely. Emphasis shifted towards preventing communist subversion and infiltration via [[proxy war|proxy]] rather than overt Soviet aggression.&lt;ref name=Berridge/&gt;

The advent of global [[decolonisation]] and the subsequent rise in prominence of the Soviet Union among several newly independent African states, was viewed with wariness by the South African government.&lt;ref name=Campbell&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Kurt|title=Soviet Policy Towards South Africa|year=1986|pages=129–131|publisher=Palgrave-Macmillan|location=Basingstoke|isbn=978-1349081677}}&lt;/ref&gt; National Party politicians began warning it would only be a matter of time before they were faced with a Soviet-directed insurgency on their borders.&lt;ref name=Campbell/&gt; Outlying regions in South West Africa, namely the [[Caprivi Strip]], became the focus of massive SADF air and ground training manoeuvres, as well as heightened border patrols.&lt;ref name=Caprivi/&gt; A year before SWAPO made the decision to send its first SWALA recruits abroad for guerrilla training, South Africa established fortified police outposts along the Caprivi Strip for the express purpose of deterring insurgents.&lt;ref name=Caprivi/&gt; When SWALA cadres armed with Soviet weapons and training began to make their appearance in South West Africa, the National Party believed its fears of a local Soviet proxy force had finally been realised.&lt;ref name=Caprivi/&gt;

Despite its burgeoning relationship with SWAPO, the Soviet Union did not regard Southern Africa as a major strategic priority in the mid 1960s, due to its preoccupation elsewhere on the continent and in the Middle East.&lt;ref name=Shultz/&gt; Nevertheless, the perception of South Africa as a regional Western ally and a bastion of [[neocolonialism]] helped fuel Soviet backing for the nationalist movement.&lt;ref name=Shultz/&gt; Moscow also approved of SWAPO's decision to adopt guerrilla warfare because it was not optimistic about any solution to the South West Africa problem short of revolutionary struggle.&lt;ref name=Shultz/&gt; This was in marked contrast to the Western governments, which opposed the formation of SWALA and turned down the latter's requests for military aid.&lt;ref name="Devils"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Herbstein|first1=Denis|last2=Evenson|first2=John|title=The Devils Are Among Us: The War for Namibia|year=1989|pages=14–23|publisher=Zed Books Ltd|location=London|isbn=978-0862328962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1960, [[Ethiopia]] and [[Liberia]] had formally petitioned the ICJ for a binding judgement, rather than an advisory opinion, on whether South Africa remained fit to govern South West Africa. Both nations made it clear that they considered the implementation of ''apartheid'' to be a violation of Pretoria's obligations as a mandatory power.&lt;ref name=Crawford1/&gt; The National Party government rejected the claim on the grounds that Ethiopia and Liberia lacked sufficient legal interest to present a case concerning South West Africa.&lt;ref name=Crawford1/&gt; This argument suffered a major setback on 21 December 1962 when the ICJ ruled that as former League of Nations member states, both parties had a right to institute the proceedings.&lt;ref name=Adede&gt;{{cite book|last=Adede|first=A.O. |editor1-last=Muller|editor1-first=A.

Around March 1962 SWAPO president [[Sam Nujoma]] visited the party's refugee camps across Tanzania, describing his recent petitions for South West African independence at the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] and the UN. He pointed out that independence was unlikely in the foreseeable future, predicting a "long and bitter struggle".&lt;ref name="Devils"/&gt; Nujoma personally directed two exiles in Dar es Salaam, Lucas Pohamba and Elia Muatale, to return to South West Africa, infiltrate Ovamboland and send back more potential recruits for SWALA.&lt;ref name="Devils"/&gt; Over the next few years Pohamba and Muatale successfully recruited hundreds of volunteers from the Ovamboland countryside, most of whom were shipped to Eastern Europe for guerrilla training.&lt;ref name="Devils"/&gt; Between July 1962 and October 1963 SWAPO negotiated military alliances with other anti-colonial movements, namely in Angola.&lt;ref name=Dale/&gt; It also absorbed the separatist ''Caprivi African National Union'' (CANU), which was formed to combat South African rule in the Caprivi Strip.&lt;ref name=Camp/&gt; Outside the Soviet bloc, Egypt continued training SWALA personnel. By 1964 others were also being sent to [[Ghana]], [[Algeria]], the [[People's Republic of China]], and [[North Korea]] for military instruction.&lt;ref name="Devils"/&gt; In June of that year, SWAPO confirmed that it was irrevocably committed to the course of armed revolution.&lt;ref name=Dale/&gt;

The formation of the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU)'s Liberation Committee further strengthened SWAPO's international standing and ushered in an era of unprecedented political decline for SWANU.&lt;ref name="Devils"/&gt; The Liberation Committee had obtained approximately £20,000 in obligatory contributions from OAU member states; these funds were offered to both South West African nationalist movements. However, as SWANU was unwilling to guarantee its share of the £20,000 would be used for armed struggle, this grant was awarded to SWAPO instead.&lt;ref name="Devils"/&gt; The OAU then withdrew recognition from SWANU, leaving SWAPO as the sole beneficiary of pan-African legitimacy.&lt;ref name=Dale/&gt; With OAU assistance, SWAPO opened diplomatic offices in [[Lusaka]], [[Cairo]], and [[London]].&lt;ref name="Devils"/&gt; SWANU belatedly embarked on a ten year programme to raise its own guerrilla army.&lt;ref name=Dale/&gt;

In September 1965, the first cadre of six SWALA guerrillas, identified simply as ''"Group 1"'', departed the Kongwa refugee camp to infiltrate South West Africa.&lt;ref name=Camp/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cann/&gt; Group 1 trekked first into Angola, before crossing the border into the Caprivi Strip.&lt;ref name=Cann/&gt; Encouraged by South Africa's apparent failure to detect the initial incursion, larger cadres made their own infiltration attempts in February and March 1966.&lt;ref name=Dale/&gt; The second cadre, ''"Group 2"'', was led by Leonard Philemon Shuuya,&lt;ref name=Dale/&gt; also known by the ''nom de guerre'' "Castro" or "Leonard Nangolo".&lt;ref name=Camp/&gt; Group 2 apparently become lost in Angola before it was able to cross the border, and the cadre dispersed after an incident in which the guerrillas killed two shopkeepers and a vagrant.&lt;ref name=Cann/&gt; Three were arrested by the Portuguese colonial authorities in Angola, working off tips received from local civilians.&lt;ref name=Cann/&gt; Another eight, including Shuuya,&lt;ref name=Dale/&gt; had been captured between March and May by the South African police, apparently in [[Kavangoland]].&lt;ref name=Camp/&gt; Shuuya later resurfaced at Kongwa, claiming to have escaped his captors after his arrest. He helped plan two further incursions: a third SWALA group entered Ovamboland that July, while a fourth was scheduled to follow in September.&lt;ref name=Dale/&gt;

On 18 July 1966, the ICJ ruled that it had no authority to decide on the South West African affair. Furthermore, the court found that while Ethiopia and Liberia had ''locus standi'' to institute proceedings on the matter, neither had enough vested legal interest in South West Africa to entitle them to a judgement of merits.&lt;ref name=Adede/&gt; This ruling was met with great indignation by SWAPO and the OAU.&lt;ref name=Caprivi/&gt; SWAPO officials immediately issued a statement from Dar es Salaam declaring that they now had "no alternative but to rise in arms" and "cross rivers of blood" in their march towards freedom.&lt;ref name="Devils"/&gt; Upon receiving the news SWALA escalated its insurgency.&lt;ref name=Caprivi/&gt; Its third cadre, which had infiltrated Ovamboland in July, attacked white-owned farms, traditional Ovambo leaders perceived as South African agents, and a border post.&lt;ref name=Dale/&gt; The guerrillas set up camp at [[Omugulugwombashe]], one of five potential bases identified by SWALA's initial reconnaissance team as appropriate sites to train future recruits.&lt;ref name=Dale/&gt; Here, they drilled up to thirty local volunteers between September 1965 and August 1966.&lt;ref name=Dale/&gt; South African intelligence became aware of the camp by mid 1966 and identified its general location.&lt;ref name="Devils"/&gt; On 26 August 1966, the first major clash of the conflict took place when South African paratroops and paramilitary police units executed Operation Blouwildebees to capture or kill the insurgents.&lt;ref name="Lord"/&gt; SWALA had dug trenches around Omugulugwombashe for defensive purposes, but was taken by surprise and most of the cadre was quickly overpowered.&lt;ref name="Lord"/&gt; The South Africans killed two guerrillas, wounded one, and captured eight more.&lt;ref name="Lord"/&gt; This engagement is widely regarded as the start of what became known in South Africa as the Border War, and according to SWAPO, officially marked the beginning of its revolutionary armed struggle.&lt;ref name="Devils"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stapleton2&gt;{{cite book|last=Stapleton|first=Timothy|title=A Military History of South Africa: From the Dutch-Khoi Wars to the End of Apartheid|year=2010|pages=169–185|publisher=Praeger Security International|location=Santa Barbara|isbn=978-0313365898}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Operation Blouwildebees triggered accusations of treachery within SWALA's senior ranks. According to SADF accounts, an unidentified informant had accompanied the security forces during the attack.&lt;ref name="Lord"/&gt; Sam Nujoma asserted that one of the eight guerrillas from the second cadre who were captured in Kavangoland was a South African mole.&lt;ref name=Dale/&gt; Suspicion immediately fell on Leonard "Castro" Shuuya.&lt;ref name=Camp/&gt; SWALA suffered a second major reversal on 18 May 1967, when Tobias Hainyeko, its commander, was killed by the South African police.&lt;ref name=Caprivi/&gt; Heinyeko and his cadre had been attempting to cross the [[Zambezi River]], as part of a general survey aimed at opening new lines of communication between the front lines in South West Africa and SWAPO's political leadership in Tanzania.&lt;ref name=Caprivi/&gt; They were intercepted by a South African patrol, and the ensuing firefight left Heinyeko dead and two policemen seriously wounded.&lt;ref name=Caprivi/&gt; Rumours again abounded that Shuuya was responsible, resulting in his dismissal and subsequent imprisonment.&lt;ref name=Camp/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dale/&gt;

In the weeks following the raid on Omugulugwombashe, South Africa had detained thirty-seven SWAPO politicians, namely [[Andimba Toivo ya Toivo]], Johnny Otto, Nathaniel Maxuilili, and Jason Mutumbulua.&lt;ref name=Dobell/&gt;&lt;ref name="Devils"/&gt; Together with the captured SWALA guerrillas they were jailed in Pretoria and held there until July 1967, when all were charged retroactively under the [[Terrorism Act, 1967|Terrorism Act]].&lt;ref name=Dobell/&gt; The state prosecuted the accused as Marxist revolutionaries seeking to establish a Soviet-backed regime in South West Africa.&lt;ref name="Devils"/&gt; In what became known as the "1967 Terrorist Trial", six of the accused were found guilty of committing violence in the act of insurrection, with the remainder being convicted for armed intimidation, or receiving military training for the purpose of insurrection.&lt;ref name="Devils"/&gt; During the trial, the defendants unsuccessfully argued against allegations that they were privy to an external communist plot.&lt;ref name=Dobell/&gt; All but three received sentences ranging from five years to life imprisonment on [[Robben Island]].&lt;ref name=Dobell/&gt;

===Expansion of the war effort and mine warfare===

The defeat at Omugulugwombashe and subsequent loss of Tobias Hainyeko forced SWALA to reevaluate its tactics. Guerrillas began operating in larger groups to increase their chances of surviving encounters with the security forces, and refocused their efforts on infiltrating the civilian population.&lt;ref name=Caprivi/&gt; Disguised as peasants, SWALA cadres could acquaint themselves with the terrain and observe South African patrols without arousing suspicion.&lt;ref name=Caprivi/&gt; This was also a logistical advantage because they could only take what supplies they could carry while in the field; otherwise, the guerrillas remained dependent on sympathetic civilians for food, water, and other necessities.&lt;ref name=Caprivi/&gt; On 29 July 1967, the SADF received intelligence that a large number of SWALA forces were congregated at Sacatxai, a settlement almost a hundred and thirty kilometres north of the border inside Angola.&lt;ref name="Lord"/&gt; South African [[North American T-6 Texan|T-6 Harvard]] warplanes bombed Sacatxai on 1 August.&lt;ref name="Lord"/&gt; Most of their intended targets were able to escape, and in October 1968 two SWALA units crossed the border into Ovamboland.&lt;ref name=Stapleton2/&gt; This incursion was no more productive than the others and by the end of the year 178 insurgents had been either killed or apprehended by the police.&lt;ref name=Stapleton2/&gt;

Throughout the 1950s and much of the 1960s, a limited military service system by lottery was implemented in South Africa to comply with the needs of national defence.&lt;ref name=Reflections&gt;{{cite book|last1=Potgieter|first1=Thean|last2=Liebenberg|first2=Ian|title=Reflections on War: Preparedness and Consequences|year=2012|pages=70–81|publisher=Sun Media Press|location=Stellenbosch|isbn=978-1920338855}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around mid 1967 the National Party government established universal [[conscription]] for all white South African men as the SADF expanded to meet the growing insurgent threat.&lt;ref name=Reflections/&gt; From January 1968 onwards there would be two yearly intakes of national servicemen undergoing nine months of military training.&lt;ref name=Reflections/&gt; The air strike on Sacatxai also marked a fundamental shift in South African tactics, as the SADF had for the first time indicated a willingness to strike at SWALA on foreign soil.&lt;ref name="Lord"/&gt; Although Angola was then an [[overseas province]] of Portugal, Lisbon granted the SADF's request to mount punitive campaigns across the border.&lt;ref name="Weigert"/&gt; In May 1967 South Africa established a new facility at [[Rundu]] to coordinate joint air operations between the SADF and the [[Portuguese Armed Forces]], and posted two permanent liaison officers at [[Menongue]] and [[Cuito Cuanavale]].&lt;ref name="Weigert"/&gt;

As the war intensified, South Africa's case for annexation in the international community continued to decline, coinciding with an unparalleled wave of sympathy for SWAPO.&lt;ref name=Dobell/&gt; Despite the ICJ's advisory opinions to the contrary, as well as the dismissal of the case presented by Ethiopia and Liberia, the UN declared that South Africa had failed in its obligations to ensure the moral and material well-being of the indigenous inhabitants of South West Africa, and had thus disavowed its own mandate.&lt;ref name=Yusuf&gt;{{cite book|last=Yusuf|first=Abdulqawi|title=African Yearbook of International Law, Volume I|year=1994|pages=16–34|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|location=The Hague|isbn=0-7923-2718-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN thereby assumed that the mandate was terminated, which meant South Africa had no further right to administer the territory, and that henceforth South West Africa would come under the direct responsibility of the General Assembly.&lt;ref name=Yusuf/&gt; The post of [[United Nations Commissioner for Namibia|United Nations Commissioner for South West Africa]] was created, as well as an ad hoc council, to recommend practical means for local administration.&lt;ref name=Yusuf/&gt; South Africa maintained it did not recognise the jurisdiction of the UN with regards to the mandate and refused visas to the commissioner or the council.&lt;ref name=Yusuf/&gt; On 12 June 1968, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution which proclaimed that, in accordance with the desires of its people, South West Africa be renamed ''Namibia''.&lt;ref name=Yusuf/&gt; [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 269]], adopted in August 1969, declared South Africa's continued occupation of "Namibia" illegal.&lt;ref name=Yusuf/&gt;&lt;ref name="MAA"&gt;{{cite book|last=Peter|first=Abbott |author2=Helmoed-Romer Heitman |author3=Paul Hannon|title=Modern African Wars (3): South-West Africa|pages=5–13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t9Aj997IO9gC | isbn=978-1-85532-122-9 | year=1991 | publisher=Osprey Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recognition of the UN's decision, SWALA was renamed the People's Liberation Army of Namibia.&lt;ref name=Camp/&gt;

To regain the military initiative, the adoption of [[Land mine|mine warfare]] as an integral strategy of PLAN was discussed at a 1969–70 SWAPO consultative congress held in Tanzania.&lt;ref name="MAA"/&gt; PLAN's leadership backed the initiative to deploy land mines as a means of compensating for its inferiority in most conventional aspects to the South African security forces.&lt;ref name="Mines1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Namibia Mine Ban Policy|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|url=http://archives.the-monitor.org/index.php/publications/display?url=lm/1999/namibia.html|location=Geneva|publisher=International Campaign to Ban Landmines and the Cluster Munition Coalition (ICBL-CMC)|year=1999|accessdate=15 July 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170716001119/http://archives.the-monitor.org/index.php/publications/display?url=lm%2F1999%2Fnamibia.html|archivedate=16 July 2017|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, PLAN began acquiring [[TM-46 mine]]s from the Soviet Union, which were designed for anti-tank purposes, and produced some homemade "box mines" with [[TNT]] for anti-personnel use.&lt;ref name="MAA"/&gt; The mines were strategically placed along roads to hamper police convoys or throw them into disarray prior to an ambush; guerrillas also laid others along their infiltration routes on the long border with Angola.&lt;ref name=SurviveRide&gt;{{cite book | last1=Camp | first1=Steve | last2=Helmoed-Römer | first2=Heitman | title=Surviving the Ride: A pictorial history of South African Manufactured Mine-Protected vehicles | date=November 2014 | pages=19–22 | publisher=30 Degrees South | location=Pinetown | isbn=978-1928211-17-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proliferation of mines in South West Africa initially resulted in heavy police casualties and would become one of the most defining features of PLAN's war effort for the next two decades.&lt;ref name=SurviveRide/&gt;

On 2 May 1971 a police van struck a mine, most likely a TM-46, in the Caprivi Strip.&lt;ref name="MAA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LM"&gt;{{Cite book| title = Still Killing: Landmines in Southern Africa | last = Vines | first = Alex | publisher = Human Rights Watch | location = New York

The proliferation of mines in the Caprivi and other rural areas posed a serious concern to the South African government, as they were relatively easy for a PLAN cadre to conceal and plant with minimal chance of detection.&lt;ref name=SurviveRide/&gt; Sweeping the roads for mines with hand held mine detectors was possible, but too slow and tedious to be a practical means of ensuring swift police movement or keeping routes open for civilian use.&lt;ref name=SurviveRide/&gt; The SADF possessed some mine clearance equipment, including flails and ploughs mounted on tanks, but these were not considered practical either.&lt;ref name=SurviveRide/&gt; The sheer distances of road vulnerable to PLAN sappers every day was simply too vast for daily detection and clearance efforts.&lt;ref name=SurviveRide/&gt; For the SADF and the police, the only other viable option was the adoption of armoured personnel carriers with mine-proof hulls that could move quickly on roads with little risk to their passengers even if a mine was encountered.&lt;ref name=SurviveRide/&gt; This would evolve into a new class of military vehicle, the [[MRAP|mine resistant and ambush protected vehicle]] (MRAP).&lt;ref name=SurviveRide/&gt; By the end of 1972, the South African police were carrying out most of their patrols in the Caprivi Strip with mineproofed vehicles.&lt;ref name=SurviveRide/&gt;

===Political unrest in Ovamboland===

[[United Nations Security Council Resolution 283]] was passed in June 1970 calling for all UN member states to close, or refrain from establishing, diplomatic or consular offices in South West Africa.&lt;ref name=Question&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaela|first=Laurent|title=The Question of Namibia|year=1996|pages=73–76|publisher=Palgrave-Macmillan|location=Basingstoke|isbn=978-0312159917}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution also recommended disinvestment, boycotts, and voluntary sanctions of that territory as long as it remained under South African rule.&lt;ref name=Question/&gt; In light of these developments, the Security Council sought the advisory opinion of the ICJ on the "legal consequences for states of the continued presence of South Africa in Namibia".&lt;ref name=Question/&gt; There was initial opposition to this course of action from SWAPO and the OAU, because their delegates feared another inconclusive ruling like the one in 1966 would strengthen South Africa's case for annexation.&lt;ref name=Katjavivi&gt;{{cite book|last=Katjavivi|first=Peter|title=A History of Resistance in Namibia|year=1990|pages=65–70|publisher=Africa World Press|location=Trenton, New Jersey|isbn=978-0865431447}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the prevailing opinion at the Security Council was that since the composition of judges had been changed since 1966, a ruling in favour of the nationalist movement was more likely.&lt;ref name=Katjavivi/&gt; At the UN's request, SWAPO was permitted to lobby informally at the court and was even offered an observer presence in the courtroom itself.&lt;ref name=Katjavivi/&gt;

On 21 June 1971, the ICJ reversed its earlier decision not to rule on the legality of South Africa's mandate, and expressed the opinion that any continued perpetuation of said mandate was illegal.&lt;ref name=Question/&gt; Furthermore, the court found that Pretoria was under obligation to withdraw its administration immediately and that if it failed to do so, UN member states would be compelled to refrain from any political or business dealings which might imply recognition of the South African government's presence there.&lt;ref name=Katjavivi/&gt; On the same day the ICJ's ruling was made public, South African prime minister [[B. J. Vorster]] rejected it as "politically motivated", with no foundation in fact.&lt;ref name=Question/&gt; However, the decision inspired the bishops of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Namibia|Evangelical Lutheran Ovambo-Kavango Church]] to draw up an open letter to Vorster denouncing apartheid and South Africa's continued rule.&lt;ref name="Devils"/&gt; This letter was read in every black Lutheran congregation in the territory, and in a number of Catholic and Anglican parishes elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Devils"/&gt; The consequence of the letter's contents was increased militancy on the part of the black population, especially among the Ovambo people, who made up the bulk of SWAPO's supporters.&lt;ref name="Devils"/&gt; Throughout the year there were mass demonstrations against the South African government held in many Ovamboland schools.&lt;ref name="Devils"/&gt;

In December 1971, Jannie de Wet, Commissioner for the Indigenous Peoples of South West Africa, sparked off a general strike by 15,000 Ovambo workers in [[Walvis Bay]] when he made a public statement defending the territory's controversial contract labour regulations.&lt;ref name="Dreyer"&gt;{{cite book|title=Namibia and Southern Africa: Regional Dynamics of Decolonization, 1945-90|last=Dreyer|first=Ronald|location=London|publisher=Kegan Paul International|year=1994|isbn=978-0710304711|pages=73–87, 100–116}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strike quickly spread to municipal workers in Windhoek, and from there to the diamond, copper and tin mines, especially those at [[Tsumeb]], [[Grootfontein]], and [[Oranjemund]].&lt;ref name="Dreyer"/&gt; Later in the month, 25,000 Ovambo farm labourers joined what had become a nationwide strike affecting half the total workforce.&lt;ref name="Dreyer"/&gt; The South African police responded by arresting some of the striking workers and forcibly deporting the others to Ovamboland.&lt;ref name="Devils"/&gt; On 10 January 1972, an ''ad hoc'' strike committee led by Johannes Nangutuuala, was formed to negotiate with the South African government; the strikers demanded an end to contract labour, freedom to apply for jobs according to skill and interest and to quit a job if so desired, freedom to have a worker bring his family with him from Ovamboland while taking a job elsewhere, and for equal pay with white workers.&lt;ref name=Katjavivi/&gt;

The strike was later brought to an end after the South African government agreed to several concessions which were endorsed by Nangutuuala, including the implementation of uniform working hours and allowing workers to change jobs.&lt;ref name="Devils"/&gt; Responsibility for labour recruitment was also transferred to the tribal authorities in Ovamboland.&lt;ref name="Devils"/&gt; Thousands of the sacked Ovambo workers remained dissatisfied with these terms and refused to return to work.&lt;ref name="Devils"/&gt; They attacked tribal headmen, vandalised stock control posts and government offices, and tore down about a hundred kilometres of fencing along the border, which they claimed obstructed itinerant Ovambos from grazing their cattle freely.&lt;ref name="Dreyer"/&gt; The unrest also fueled discontent among [[Kwanyama dialect|Kwanyama]]-speaking Ovambos in Angola, who destroyed cattle vaccination stations and schools and attacked four border posts, killing and injuring some SADF personnel as well as members of a Portuguese militia unit.&lt;ref name="Dreyer"/&gt; South Africa responded by declaring a [[state of emergency]] in Ovamboland on 4 February.&lt;ref name=Katjavivi/&gt; A [[media blackout]] was imposed, white civilians evacuated further south, public assembly rights revoked, and the security forces empowered to detain suspicious persons indefinitely.&lt;ref name=Katjavivi/&gt; Police reinforcements were sent to the border, and in the ensuing crackdown they arrested 213 Ovambos.&lt;ref name="Dreyer"/&gt; South Africa was sufficiently alarmed at the violence to deploy a large SADF contingent as well.&lt;ref name="Dreyer"/&gt; They were joined by Portuguese troops who moved south from across the border to assist them.&lt;ref name=Katjavivi/&gt; By the end of March order had been largely restored and most of the remaining strikers returned to work.&lt;ref name=Katjavivi/&gt;
[[File:Ovamboland flag.svg|thumb|Flag of Ovamboland, which was granted self-governing status as an autonomous [[bantustan]] in 1973.]]
South Africa blamed SWAPO for instigating the strike and subsequent unrest.&lt;ref name=Katjavivi/&gt; While acknowledging that a significant percentage of the strikers were SWAPO members and supporters, the party's acting president [[Nathaniel Maxuilili]] noted that reform of South West African labour laws had been a longstanding aspiration of the Ovambo workforce, and suggested the strike had been organised shortly after the crucial ICJ ruling because they hoped to take advantage of its publicity to draw greater attention to their grievances.&lt;ref name=Katjavivi/&gt; The strike also had a politicising effect on much of the Ovambo population, as the workers involved later turned to wider political activity and joined SWAPO.&lt;ref name=Katjavivi/&gt; Around 20,000 strikers did not return to work but fled to other countries, mostly Zambia, where some were recruited as guerrillas by PLAN.&lt;ref name="Devils"/&gt; Support for PLAN also increased among the rural Ovamboland peasantry, who were for the most part sympathetic with the strikers and resentful of their traditional chiefs' active collaboration with the police.&lt;ref name="Dreyer"/&gt;

The following year, South Africa transferred self-governing authority to Chief [[Fillemon Elifas Shuumbwa]] and the Ovambo legislature, effectively granting Ovamboland a limited form of [[home rule]].&lt;ref name="Devils"/&gt; Voter turnout at the legislative elections was exceedingly poor, due in part to antipathy towards the local Ovamboland government and a SWAPO boycott of the polls.&lt;ref name="Devils"/&gt;

===The police withdrawal===

====Cuba responds with Operation Carlota====
{{main article|Cuban intervention in Angola}}

On 3 November, a South African unit advancing towards [[Benguela]], Angola paused to attack a FAPLA base which housed a substantial training contingent of Cuban advisers.&lt;ref name=Ford/&gt; When reports reached Cuban president [[Fidel Castro]] that the advisers had been engaged by what appeared to be SADF regulars, he decided to approve a request from the MPLA leadership for direct military assistance.&lt;ref name=Ford/&gt; Castro declared that he would send all "the men and weapons necessary to win that struggle",&lt;ref name=Ford/&gt; in the spirit of [[proletarian internationalism]] and solidarity with the MPLA.&lt;ref name=Cuba/&gt; Castro named this mission Operation Carlota after [[Carlota (rebel leader)|an African woman]] who had organised a slave revolt on Cuba.&lt;ref name=Ford/&gt;

The first Cuban combat troops began departing for Angola on 7 November, and were drawn from a special paramilitary battalion of the Cuban Ministry of Interior.&lt;ref name="Cuba"/&gt; These were followed closely by one mechanised and one artillery battalion of the [[Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces]], which set off by ship and would not reach Luanda until 27 November.&lt;ref name=Vanneman/&gt; They were kept supplied by a [[Cuba–Angola airbridge|massive airlift]] carried out with Soviet aircraft.&lt;ref name=Vanneman/&gt; The Soviet Union also deployed a small naval contingent and about 400 military advisers to Luanda.&lt;ref name=Vanneman/&gt; Heavy weapons were flown and transported by sea directly from various Warsaw Pact member states to Angola for the arriving Cubans, including tanks, helicopters, armoured cars, and even 10 [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21]] fighter aircraft, which were assembled by Cuban and Soviet technicians in Luanda.&lt;ref name="Cuba"/&gt; By the end of the year there were 12,000 Cuban soldiers inside Angola, nearly the size of the entire SADF presence in South West Africa.&lt;ref name="Frontiersmen"/&gt; The FNLA suffered a crushing defeat at the [[Battle of Quifangondo]] when it attempted to take Luanda on 10 November, and the capital remained in FAPLA hands by independence.&lt;ref name="Cuba"/&gt;

[[File:Cuban PT-76 Angola.JPG|thumb|Cuban [[PT-76]] tank in the streets of Luanda, 1976.]]
Throughout late November and early December the Cubans focused on fighting the FNLA in the north, and stopping an abortive incursion by [[Zaire]] on behalf of that movement.&lt;ref name="Cuba"/&gt; Thereafter they refocused on putting an end to the SADF advances in the south.&lt;ref name="Cuba"/&gt; The South African and Cuban forces engaged in a series of bloody, but inconclusive skirmishes and battles throughout late December.&lt;ref name="Frontiersmen"/&gt; However, by this point word of the SADF's involvement had been leaked to the international press, and photographs of SADF armour behind UNITA lines were appearing in several European newspapers.&lt;ref name="Cuba"/&gt; This proved to be a major political setback for the South African government, which was almost universally condemned for its interference in a black African country.&lt;ref name="Stockwell"/&gt; Moreover, it spurred influential African states such as [[Nigeria]] and Tanzania to recognise the MPLA as the sole legitimate government of Angola, as that movement's struggle against an apparent act of South African aggression gave it legitimacy at the OAU.&lt;ref name=Schraeder/&gt;

South Africa appealed to the United States for more direct support, but when the CIA's role in arming the FNLA also became public the US Congress terminated and disavowed the programme.&lt;ref name="Beggar"/&gt; In the face of regional and international condemnation, the SADF made the decision around Christmas of 1975 to begin withdrawing from Angola.&lt;ref name=Ford/&gt; The withdrawal commenced in February 1976 and formally ended a month later.&lt;ref name="Cuba"/&gt; As the FNLA and UNITA lost their logistical backing from the CIA and the direct military support of the SADF, they were forced to abandon much of their territory to a renewed FAPLA offensive.&lt;ref name="Cuba"/&gt; The FNLA was almost completely wiped out, but UNITA succeeded in retreating deep into the country's wooded highlands, where it continued to mount a determined insurgency.&lt;ref name=Vanneman/&gt; Operation Savannah was widely regarded as a strategic failure.&lt;ref name="Days"/&gt; South Africa and the US had committed resources and manpower to the initial objective of preventing a FAPLA victory prior to Angolan independence, which was achieved.&lt;ref name=Ford/&gt; But the early successes of Savannah provided the MPLA politburo with a reason to increase the deployment of Cuban troops and Soviet advisers exponentially.&lt;ref name="POW"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Saga of South African POWs in Angola, 1975-82|last=Baines|first=Gary|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gary_Baines/publication/307748686_THE_SAGA_OF_SOUTH_AFRICAN_POWS_IN_ANGOLA_1975-82/links/58773b1908ae329d622799af/THE-SAGA-OF-SOUTH-AFRICAN-POWS-IN-ANGOLA-1975-82.pdf|journal=Scientia Militaria, South African Journal of Military Studies|volume=40|location=[[Stellenbosch]]|publisher=Stellenbosch University|year=2012|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Operation Savannah accelerated the shift of SWAPO's alliances among the Angolan nationalist movements.&lt;ref name=Volk/&gt; Until August 1975, SWAPO was theoretically aligned with the MPLA, but in reality PLAN had enjoyed a close working relationship with UNITA during the Angolan War of Independence.&lt;ref name=Volk/&gt; In September 1975, SWAPO issued a public statement declaring its intention to remain neutral in the Angolan Civil War and refrain from supporting any single political faction or party.&lt;ref name="Dreyer"/&gt; With the South African withdrawal in March, Sam Nujoma retracted his movement's earlier position and endorsed the MPLA as the "authentic representative of the Angolan people".&lt;ref name="Dreyer"/&gt; During the same month, Cuba began flying in small numbers of PLAN recruits from Zambia to Angola to commence guerrilla training.&lt;ref name="Freedom"/&gt; PLAN shared intelligence with the Cubans and FAPLA, and from April 1976 even fought alongside them against UNITA.&lt;ref name="Dreyer"/&gt; FAPLA often used PLAN cadres to garrison strategic sites while freeing up more of its own personnel for deployments elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Dreyer"/&gt;

The emerging MPLA-SWAPO alliance took on special significance after the latter movement was wracked by factionalism and a series of PLAN mutinies in [[Western Province, Zambia|Western Province]], Zambia between March and April 1976, known as the Shipanga Affair.&lt;ref name="Sellström"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sellström|first=Tor|title=Sweden and National Liberation in Southern Africa: Solidarity and assistance, 1970–1994|year=2002|pages=308–310|publisher=Nordic Africa Institute|location=Uppsala|isbn=978-91-7106-448-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relations between SWAPO and the Zambian government were already troubled due to the fact that the growing intensity of PLAN attacks on the Caprivi often provoked South African retaliation against Zambia.&lt;ref name="SAIRR1971"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Survey of Race Relations in South Africa|last1=Horrell|first1=Muriel|last2=Horner|first2=Dudley|last3=Kane-Berman|first3=John|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/sites/default/files/SAIRR%20Survey%201971.pdf|location=Johannesburg|publisher=South African Institute of Race Relations|year=1971|accessdate=18 July 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170718231136/http://www.sahistory.org.za/sites/default/files/SAIRR%20Survey%201971.pdf|archivedate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Detente"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Kissinger/Vorster/Kaunda Detente: Genesis of the SWAPO Spy Drama|last=Trewhela|first=Paul|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/sites/default/files/DC/sljul90.6/sljul90.6.pdf|location=Johannesburg|publisher=Searchlight South Africa|year=1990|accessdate=19 July 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170720002630/http://www.sahistory.org.za/sites/default/files/DC/sljul90.6/sljul90.6.pdf|archivedate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When SWAPO's executive committee proved unable to suppress the PLAN revolt, the [[Zambian Defence Force|Zambian National Defence Force]] (ZNDF) mobilised several army battalions&lt;ref name=Chesterman&gt;{{cite book|last=Lamb|first=Guy|editor-last=Chesterman|editor-first=Simon|title=Civilians in War|year=2001|pages=322–342|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers, Incorporated|location=Boulder, Colorado|isbn=978-1555879884}}&lt;/ref&gt; and drove the dissidents out of their bases in South West African refugee camps, capturing an estimated 1,800.&lt;ref name="Frontiersmen"/&gt; SWAPO's Secretary for Information, [[Andreas Shipanga]], was later held responsible for the revolt.&lt;ref name="Sellström"/&gt; Zambian president [[Kenneth Kaunda]] deported Shipanga and several other high-ranking dissidents to Tanzania, while incarcerating the others at remote army facilities.&lt;ref name=Chesterman/&gt; Sam Nujoma accused them of being South African agents and carried out a purge of the surviving political leadership and PLAN ranks.&lt;ref name="Detente"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nujoma&gt;{{cite book|last=Nujoma|first=Samuel|title=Where others wavered|year=2001|pages=228–242|publisher=Panaf Books|location=London|isbn=978-0901787583}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forty mutineers were sentenced to death by a PLAN tribunal in Lusaka, while hundreds of others disappeared.&lt;ref name=Mboromba&gt;{{cite book|last1=Basson|first1=Nico|last2=Motinga|first2=Ben|title=Call Them Spies: A documentary account of the Namibian spy drama|year=1989|pages=8–28|publisher=African Communications Project|location=Johannesburg|isbn=978-0812216202}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heightened tension between Kaunda's government and PLAN began to have repercussions in the ZNDF.&lt;ref name="Dreyer"/&gt; Zambian officers and enlisted men confiscated PLAN arms and harassed loyal insurgents, straining relations and eroding morale.&lt;ref name="Dreyer"/&gt;

The crisis in Zambia prompted PLAN to relocate its headquarters from Lusaka to [[Lubango]], Angola, at the invitation of the MPLA.&lt;ref name=Dale/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nujoma/&gt; It was joined shortly afterwards by SWAPO's political wing, which relocated to Luanda.&lt;ref name="Freedom"/&gt; SWAPO's closer affiliation and proximity to the MPLA may have influenced its concurrent slide to the left;&lt;ref name=Reappraisal/&gt; the party adopted a more overtly Marxist discourse, such as a commitment to a classless society based on the ideals and principles of [[scientific socialism]].&lt;ref name="Dreyer"/&gt; From 1976 onward SWAPO considered itself the ideological as well as the military ally of the MPLA.&lt;ref name="Dreyer"/&gt;

In 1977 Cuba and the Soviet Union established dozens of new training camps in Angola to accommodate PLAN and two other guerrilla movements in the region, the [[Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army]] (ZIPRA) and Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK).&lt;ref name="George"/&gt; The Cubans provided instructors and specialist officers, while the Soviets provided more hardware for the guerrillas.&lt;ref name="George"/&gt; This convergence of interests between the Cuban and Soviet military missions in Angola proved successful as it drew on each partner's comparative strengths.&lt;ref name="George"/&gt; The Soviet Union's strength lay in its vast military industrial complex, which furbished the raw material for bolstering FAPLA and its allies.&lt;ref name="George"/&gt; Cuba's strength lay in its manpower and troop commitment to Angola, which included technical advisers who were familiar with the sophisticated weaponry supplied by the Soviets and possessed combat experience.&lt;ref name="George"/&gt; In order to reduce the likelihood of a South African attack, the training camps were sited near Cuban or FAPLA military installations, with the added advantage of being able to rely on the logistical and communications infrastructure of PLAN's allies.&lt;ref name=Dale/&gt;

In the territories of Ovamboland, Kaokoland, Kavangoland and [[East Caprivi]] after 1976, the SADF installed fixed defences against infiltration, employing two parallel electrified fences and motion sensors.&lt;ref name=COIN/&gt; The system was backed by roving patrols drawn from Eland armoured car squadrons, motorised infantry, canine units, horsemen and scrambler motorcycles for mobility and speed over rough terrain; local [[San people|San]] trackers, Ovambo paramilitaries, and [[South African special forces]].&lt;ref name=COIN/&gt;&lt;ref name="Uys"&gt;{{cite book|last=Uys|first=Ian|title=Bushmen Soldiers: The History of 31, 201 &amp; 203 Battalions During the Border War|year=2014|pages=73–75|publisher=Helion &amp; Company|location=Solihull|isbn=978-1909384583}}&lt;/ref&gt; PLAN attempted hit and run raids across the border but, in what was characterised as the "corporal's war", SADF [[Section (military unit)|sections]] largely intercepted them in the Cutline before they could get any further into South West Africa itself.&lt;ref name="Borderstrike2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Borderstrike!

Another significant factor of the physical environment was South West Africa's limited road network. The main arteries for SADF bases on the border were two highways leading west to [[Ruacana]] and north to Oshikango, and a third which stretched from Grootfontein through Kavangoland to Rundu.&lt;ref name="War"/&gt; Much of this vital road infrastructure was vulnerable to guerrilla sabotage: innumerable road culverts and bridges were blown up and rebuilt multiple times over the course of the war.&lt;ref name="Lord"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sacred&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Linn|first=Bryan|title=Namibia: The sacred trust of civilization, ideal and reality|year=2003|page=210|publisher=Gamsberg-Macmillan|location=Windhoek|isbn=978-9991604077}}&lt;/ref&gt; After their destruction PLAN saboteurs sowed the surrounding area with land mines to catch the South African engineers sent to repair them.&lt;ref name="Koevoet1"/&gt; One of the most routine tasks for local sector troops was a morning patrol along their assigned stretch of highway to check for mines or overnight sabotage.&lt;ref name="Koevoet1"/&gt;  Despite their efforts it was nearly impossible to guard or patrol the almost limitless number of vulnerable points on the road network, and losses from mines mounted steadily; for instance in 1977 the SADF suffered 16 deaths due to mined roads.&lt;ref name="LM"/&gt; Aside from road sabotage, the SADF was also forced to contend with regular ambushes of both military and civilian traffic throughout Ovamboland.&lt;ref name="Koevoet1"/&gt; Movement between towns was by escorted convoy, and the roads in the north were closed to civilian traffic between six in the evening and half past seven in the morning.&lt;ref name="Koevoet1"/&gt; White civilians and administrators from [[Oshakati]], [[Ondangwa]], and Rundu began routinely carrying arms, and never ventured far from their fortified neighbourhoods.&lt;ref name="War"/&gt;

[[File:SADF-Operations 4.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|South African troops on patrol near the border, early 1980s.]]
Unharried by major South African offensives, PLAN was free to consolidate its military organisation in Angola. PLAN's leadership under [[Dimo Hamaambo]] concentrated on improving its communications and control throughout that country, demarcating the Angolan front into three military zones, in which guerrilla activities were coordinated by a single operational headquarters.&lt;ref name="CIA1"/&gt; The Western Command was headquartered in western [[Huíla Province]] and responsible for PLAN operations in Kaokoland and western Ovamboland.&lt;ref name="CIA1"/&gt; The Central Command was headquartered in central Huíla Province and responsible for PLAN operations in central Ovamboland.&lt;ref name="CIA1"/&gt; The Eastern Command was headquartered in northern Huíla Province and responsible for PLAN operations in eastern Ovamboland and Kavangoland.&lt;ref name="CIA1"/&gt;

The three PLAN regional headquarters each developed their own forces which resembled standing armies with regard to the division of military labour, incorporating various specialties such as counter-intelligence, air defence, reconnaissance, combat engineering, sabotage, and artillery.&lt;ref name=Dale/&gt; The Eastern Command also created an elite force in 1978,&lt;ref name=Namakalu&gt;{{cite book|last=Namakalu|first=Oswin Onesmus|title=Armed Liberation Struggle: Some Accounts of PLAN's Combat Operations|year=2004|pages=75-111|publisher=Gamsberg Macmillan|location=Windhoek|isbn=978-9991605050}}&lt;/ref&gt; known as "''Volcano''" and subsequently, "''Typhoon''", which carried out unconventional operations south of Ovamboland.&lt;ref name=Dale/&gt;

South Africa's defence chiefs requested an end to restrictions on air and ground operations north of the Cutline.&lt;ref name="Borderstrike2"/&gt; Citing the accelerated pace of PLAN infiltration, P.W.

===Operation Reindeer===
{{main article|Operation Reindeer|Battle of Cassinga}}

On 27 October 1977 a group of insurgents attacked an SADF patrol in the Cutline, killing 5 South African soldiers and mortally wounding a sixth.&lt;ref name=Raditsa&gt;{{cite book|last=Raditsa|first=Leo|title=Prisoners of a Dream: The South African Mirage|year=1989|pages=289–291|publisher=Prince George Street Press|location=Annapolis, Maryland|isbn=978-0927104005}}&lt;/ref&gt; As military historian [[Willem Steenkamp]] records, "while not a large clash by World War II or Vietnam standards, it was a milestone in what was then...a [[low intensity conflict]]".&lt;ref name="Borderstrike2"/&gt; Three months later, insurgents fired on patrols in the Cutline again, killing 6 more soldiers.&lt;ref name="Borderstrike2"/&gt; The growing number of ambushes and infiltrations were timed to coincide with assassination attempts on prominent South West African tribal officials.&lt;ref name="Borderstrike2"/&gt; Perhaps the most high profile assassination of a tribal leader during this time was that of Herero chief [[Clemens Kapuuo]], which South Africa blamed on PLAN.&lt;ref name=Dale/&gt; Vorster finally acquiesced to Botha's requests for retaliatory strikes against PLAN in Angola, and the SADF launched [[Operation Reindeer]] in May 1978.&lt;ref name=Raditsa/&gt;&lt;ref name="Borderstrike2"/&gt;

One controversial development of Operation Reindeer helped sour the international community on the South African Border War.&lt;ref name=Camp/&gt; On 4 May 1978, a battalion-sized task force of the [[44 Parachute Brigade (South Africa)|44 Parachute Brigade]] conducted a sweep through the Angolan mining town of [[Cassinga]], searching for what it believed was a PLAN administrative centre.&lt;ref name="Borderstrike2"/&gt; Lieutenant General [[Constand Viljoen]], the chief of the South African Army, had told the task force commanders and his immediate superior General [[Johannes Geldenhuys]] that Cassinga was a PLAN "planning headquarters" which also functioned as the "principal medical centre for the treatment of seriously injured guerrillas, as well as the concentration point for guerrilla recruits being dispatched to training centres in Lubango and Luanda and to operational bases in east and west [[Cunene Province|Cunene]]."&lt;ref name=McWilliams/&gt; The task force was made up of older [[Citizen Force (South Africa)|Citizen Force]] reservists, many of whom had already served tours on the border, led by experienced professional officers.&lt;ref name=McWilliams&gt;{{cite book|last=McWilliams|first=Mike|title=Battle for Cassinga: South Africa's Controversial Cross-Border Raid, Angola 1978|year=2011|pages=7, 34-35|publisher=Helion &amp; Company|location=Solihull|isbn=978-1907677397}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The task force of about 370 paratroops entered Cassinga, which was known as Objective Moscow to the SADF, in the wake of an intense aerial bombardment.&lt;ref name=Atrocity&gt;{{cite book|last=Baines|first=Gary|editor1-last=Dwyer|editor1-first=Philip|editor2-last=Ryan|editor2-first=Lyndall|title=Theatres Of Violence: Massacre, Mass Killing and Atrocity throughout History|year=2012|pages=226–238|publisher=Berghahn Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0857452993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Onslow&gt;{{cite book|last=Onslow|first=Sue|title=Cold War in Southern Africa: White Power, Black Liberation|year=2009|pages=201–217|publisher=Routledge Books|location=Abingdon-on-Thames|isbn=978-0415474207}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this point onward, there are two differing accounts of the Cassinga incident.&lt;ref name=Chesterman/&gt; While both concur that an airborne South African unit entered Cassinga on 4 May and that the paratroopers destroyed a large camp complex, they diverge on the characteristics of the site and the casualties inflicted.&lt;ref name=Atrocity/&gt; The SWAPO and Cuban narrative presented Cassinga as a refugee camp, and the South African government's narrative presented Cassinga as a guerrilla base.&lt;ref name=Camp/&gt; The first account claimed that Cassinga was housing a large population of civilians who had fled the escalating violence in northern South West Africa and were merely dependent on PLAN for their sustenance and protection.&lt;ref name=Atrocity/&gt; According to this narrative, South African paratroopers opened fire on the refugees, mostly women and children; those not immediately killed were systematically rounded up into groups and bayoneted or shot.&lt;ref name=Atrocity/&gt; The alleged result was the massacre of at least 612 South West African civilians, almost all elderly men, women, and children.&lt;ref name=Atrocity/&gt; The SADF narrative concurred with a death toll of approximately 600 but claimed that most of the dead were insurgents killed defending a series of trenches around the camp.&lt;ref name=Atrocity/&gt; South African sources identified Cassinga as a PLAN installation on the basis of aerial reconnaissance photographs, which depicted a network of trenches as well as a military parade ground.&lt;ref name=McWilliams/&gt; Additionally, photographs of the parade ground taken by a Swedish reporter just prior to the raid depicted children and women in civilian clothing, but also uniformed PLAN guerrillas and large numbers of young men of military age.&lt;ref name=Camp/&gt; SWAPO maintained that it ordered the trenches around Cassinga dug to shelter the otherwise defenceless refugees in the event of an SADF raid, and only after camp staff had noted spotter planes overhead several weeks prior.&lt;ref name=Camp/&gt; It justified the construction of a parade ground as part of a programme to instill a sense of discipline and unity.&lt;ref name=Camp/&gt; 

Western journalists and Angolan officials counted 582 corpses on site a few hours after the SADF's departure.&lt;ref name=Onslow/&gt;&lt;ref name="War"/&gt; The SADF suffered 3 dead and 1 missing in action.&lt;ref name=McWilliams/&gt;

[[File:Para Course Image 4.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Members of 44 Parachute Brigade in training.]]
An adjacent Cuban mechanised infantry battalion stationed sixteen kilometres to the south advanced to confront the paratroops during the attack, but suffered several delays due to strafing runs by South African [[Dassault Mirage III]] and [[Blackburn Buccaneer]] strike aircraft.&lt;ref name=Onslow/&gt; In the first known engagement between South African and Cuban forces since the termination of Operation Savannah, five Cuban tanks and some infantry in [[BTR-152]] armoured personnel carriers reached Cassinga while the paratroopers were being airlifted out by helicopter.&lt;ref name=McWilliams/&gt; This led to a protracted firefight in which Cuba acknowledged 16 dead and over 80 wounded.&lt;ref name=Onslow/&gt; The Cassinga event was given special significance by Cuban historians such as Jorge Risquet, who noted that it marked the first time that "Cubans and Namibians shed their blood together fighting the South African [military]."&lt;ref name=Onslow/&gt;

While Cassinga was in the process of being destroyed, a South African armoured column attacked a network of guerrilla transit camps at Chetequera, code named "Objective Vietnam", which was only about thirty kilometres from the Cutline.&lt;ref name=McWilliams/&gt; Chetequera was much more heavily fortified than Cassinga and the SADF encountered fierce resistance.&lt;ref name=Camp/&gt; Unlike the latter, it had also been scouted thoroughly by South African reconnaissance assets on the ground,&lt;ref name=McWilliams/&gt; and they were able to verify the absence of civilians with ample photographic and documentary evidence.&lt;ref name=Camp/&gt; The SADF suffered another 3 dead at Chetequera, in addition to 30 wounded.&lt;ref name="Borderstrike2"/&gt; PLAN lost 248 dead and 200 taken prisoner.&lt;ref name=Camp/&gt;&lt;ref name="Borderstrike2"/&gt;

On 6 May 1978, Operation Reindeer was condemned by [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 428]], which described it as a violation of Angola's territorial integrity and threatened punitive measures should the SADF attempt another incursion on Angolan soil.&lt;ref name=Camp/&gt; The resolution attracted almost unanimous support worldwide, and was endorsed not only by the Soviet Union, but by major Western powers such as the US, the UK, France, Canada, and West Germany.&lt;ref name=Camp/&gt; As the Cassinga incident received publicity, American and European attitudes became one of intense criticism of South African purpose as well as the process by which it carried out the war.&lt;ref name=Camp/&gt; Notably, Western pressure at the UN to recognise South Africa as an equal partner in any future Namibian peace settlement evaporated.&lt;ref name=Volk/&gt;

Cassinga was a major political breakthrough for SWAPO, which had portrayed the casualties there as martyrs of a Namibian nation in the making.&lt;ref name=Camp/&gt; The movement received unprecedented support in the form of humanitarian aid sent to its remaining refugee camps and offers from foreign governments to educate refugees in their countries.&lt;ref name=Camp/&gt;

===Botha's escalation===
Vorster's failing health and his preoccupation with domestic issues such as the looming [[Muldergate Scandal]] diverted his attention from South West Africa from May to September 1978, and no more major operations were undertaken by the SADF during that period.&lt;ref name=Jaster&gt;{{cite book|last=Jaster|first=Robert Scott|title=The Defence of White Power: South African Foreign Policy under Pressure|year=1997|pages=66-68, 93-103|publisher=Palgrave-Macmillan|location=Basingstoke|isbn=978-0333454558}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his absence from military affairs meant he was no longer in a position to counter the hawkish position of P.W.

During his final years in office, Vorster had recognised that growing international pressure would eventually force South Africa to grant some form of autonomy or independence to South West Africa.&lt;ref name=Jaster/&gt; He made token acknowledgements of the UN's role in deciding the territory's future and his administration had publicly renounced the notion of annexation.&lt;ref name=Jaster/&gt; As Vorster's successor, Botha felt bound by this commitment—at least in principle—to an autonomous South West Africa.&lt;ref name=Jaster/&gt; His strategy was to cultivate a viable political alternative to SWAPO, preferably moderate and anti-communist in nature, which was committed to close military and security links with South Africa.&lt;ref name=Jaster/&gt; In the meantime Botha forestalled further discussions on an internal settlement by demanding the withdrawal of the Cuban armed forces from Angola as a precondition of Namibian independence.&lt;ref name=Barber/&gt; Botha argued that the Cuban presence in Angola constituted a legitimate security concern for South West Africa, so it was not unreasonable that independence be contingent on a prior Cuban withdrawal.&lt;ref name=Barber/&gt; This initiative was supported by the US, which wanted a Namibian settlement consistent with Western interests, namely a region free of what Chester Crocker termed "Soviet-Cuban military adventurism".&lt;ref name=Crocker&gt;{{cite book|last=Crocker|first=Chester|title=Herding Cats: Multiparty Mediation in a Complex World|year=1999|pages=214-242|publisher=United States Institute of Peace|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-1878379924}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crocker endorsed the linkage since it was related to South West Africa's security situation, which needed to be stabilised prior to independence.&lt;ref name=Crocker/&gt; Botha's precondition was denounced by SWAPO for arbitrarily tying South West Africa's fate to the resolution of another regional conflict.&lt;ref name=Foreign/&gt; Some Western powers also disapproved of Cuban linkage; for example, the French government issued the statement that it was inappropriate "the Namibian people should serve as hostages" to broader US foreign policy goals.&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Alex|title=U.S. Foreign Policy Towards Apartheid South Africa, 1948–1994: Conflict of Interests|year=2008|page=119|publisher=Palgrave-Macmillan|location=Basingstoke|isbn=978-1349533541}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cuban government interpreted linkage as further proof that South Africa was a foreign policy pawn of the US, and believed it to be part of a wider diplomatic and military offensive by the Reagan administration against Cuban interests worldwide.&lt;ref name=Hatzky&gt;{{cite book|last=Hatzky|first=Christine|title=Cubans in Angola: South-South Cooperation and Transfer of Knowledge, 1976–1991|year=2015|pages=166-168|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|location=Madison|isbn=978-0299301040}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SADF had started recruiting black South West Africans in 1974 and established segregated military and paramilitary units for semi-autonomous tribal entities such as Ovamboland two years later.&lt;ref name=Kenya/&gt; PLAN had previously benefited from the deployment of white South African conscripts, reservists, and policemen unfamiliar with the terrain or environment; indigenous recruits were perceived as a means of mitigating this disadvantage.&lt;ref name=Tracking/&gt; In April 1980, Administrator-General [[Gerrit Viljoen]] announced that transfer of some control over military and police forces to South West Africans would occur once the necessary structures were implemented.&lt;ref name=Kenya/&gt; Through its defence headquarters in Windhoek, the SADF had exercised final authority on all military resources and counter-insurgency efforts.&lt;ref name=COIN/&gt; In theory, these arrangements were modified by the establishment of the [[South West African Territorial Force]] (SWATF) and the [[South West African Police]] (SWAPOL), since both of these forces were placed under the control of the interim government; the latter was also empowered to implement and oversee conscription as it saw fit.&lt;ref name=COIN/&gt; However, the SADF retained functional command of all military units; the senior general officer of the SADF in South West Africa also doubled as commander of the SWATF.&lt;ref name=COIN/&gt; By the mid 1980s the SWATF numbered about 21,000 personnel and accounted for 61% of all combat troops deployed along the Cutline.&lt;ref name=Kenya/&gt; Both the SWATF and the Government of National Unity remained dependent on massive SADF military support.&lt;ref name=Foreign/&gt;

===Operation Askari===
{{main article|Operation Askari}}

Operation Protea had exposed a glaring lack of professionalism on the part of FAPLA units, which had relied too heavily on their Soviet advisers and were almost immediately routed once they had to leave their fortified bases.&lt;ref name=Insurgencies/&gt; In terms of training, morale, organisation, and professional competence—including the ability to operate its own equipment with effectiveness—the Angolan army had proved decidedly vulnerable.&lt;ref name=Insurgencies/&gt; Protea indicated that it was in no condition to repel or even inflict serious losses on the South African expeditionary troops, resulting in a ratio of casualties almost overwhelmingly in the SADF's favour.&lt;ref name=Insurgencies/&gt; That debacle led to a greater FAPLA dependency on augmented Cuban forces and another large arms deal, valued in excess of one billion dollars, being signed with the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="MacFarlane"/&gt; Defence expenditures increased to consume 50% of Angola's state budget by the end of 1982.&lt;ref name=Hatzky/&gt; FAPLA embarked on a massive recruiting drive, purchased new [[T-54/55]] and [[T-62]] tanks from the Soviet Union, and took delivery of about thirty new combat aircraft, including twelve [[Sukhoi Su-17|Sukhoi Su-20]] strike fighters.&lt;ref name=trade&gt;{{cite web|url=http://armstrade.sipri.org/armstrade/page/trade_register.php |title=Trade Registers |publisher=Armstrade.sipri.org |date= |accessdate=2014-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MacFarlane"/&gt; It also ordered more air search radars and surface-to-air missiles to replace those destroyed in Protea.&lt;ref name=trade/&gt;

While Namibianisation altered the tactical realities of the war on the Cutline, the SADF was planning a fourth operation modelled after Sceptic, Protea, and Daisy.&lt;ref name=Brothers/&gt; In April 1982, PLAN insurgents killed 9 South African soldiers near Tsumeb, over 200 kilometres south of the border.&lt;ref name=Kenya/&gt;&lt;ref name="LM"/&gt; South Africa claimed 152 security-related incidents involving PLAN occurred in South West Africa that year, and acknowledged the combat deaths of 77 SADF and SWATF personnel.&lt;ref name="LM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MAA"/&gt; In July 1983 PLAN carried out its first major act of urban sabotage, detonating a bomb in the centre of Windhoek, which caused extensive property damage but no civilian injuries.&lt;ref name=Kenya/&gt; Infiltration of Ovamboland and Kavangoland increased dramatically at around the same time, with 700 insurgents entering both regions.&lt;ref name=Scheepers&gt;{{cite book|last=Scheepers|first=Marius|title=Striking Inside Angola with 32 Battalion|year=2012|pages=9–10, 73|publisher=Helion &amp; Company|location=Solihull|isbn=978-1907677779}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SADF claimed to have killed or captured just under half the insurgents by May, but was unable to prevent the others from making their way further south.&lt;ref name=Scheepers/&gt; These developments indicated that PLAN had not lost its will to persevere despite the enormous materiel losses sustained during Protea, and the infiltration of men and supplies into South West Africa continued apace.&lt;ref name=Scheepers/&gt;

Their confidence buoyed by the previous successful incursions into FAPLA-held territory, which had achieved marked success at only minimal cost in lives and materiel, Botha and his defence chiefs scheduled Operation Askari for December 1983.&lt;ref name=Brothers/&gt; Like Protea, Askari was a major combined arms assault on PLAN base areas and supply lines in Angola; it also targeted nearby FAPLA air defence installations and brigade headquarters.&lt;ref name=Scheepers/&gt; According to General [[Georg Meiring]], commander of the SADF in South West Africa, Askari would serve the purpose of a preemptive strike aimed at eliminating the large numbers of PLAN insurgents and stockpiles of weapons being amassed for the annual rainy season infiltration.&lt;ref name=Brothers/&gt;

The buildup of South African armour and artillery on the border did not go unnoticed; by late November the Soviet Union had enough satellite reconnaissance photographs and other intelligence to deduce that the SADF was preparing for another major incursion into Angola.&lt;ref name=Vanneman/&gt; During a private meeting arranged at the [[Algonquin Hotel]] by UN Secretary-General [[Javier Pérez de Cuéllar]] at Moscow's request, Soviet diplomats informed their South African counterparts that further aggression towards FAPLA would not be tolerated.&lt;ref name=Vanneman/&gt; The Soviets threatened unspecified retaliation if FAPLA's grip on Angola disintegrated further as a result of Askari.&lt;ref name=Vanneman/&gt; Simultaneously, in a direct show of force, a Soviet aircraft carrier and three surface ships called at Luanda before rounding the Cape of Good Hope.&lt;ref name=SFP&gt;{{cite book|last=Albright|first=David|editor1-last=Laird|editor1-first=Robbin|editor2-last=Hoffmann|editor2-first=Erik|title=Soviet Foreign Policy in a Changing World|year=1986|pages=821-822|publisher=Aldine Publihsing Company|location=New York|isbn=978-0202241661}}&lt;/ref&gt; This constituted the most powerful Soviet naval detachment which had ever approached within striking distance of South African waters.&lt;ref name=SFP/&gt; Botha was unmoved, and Askari proceeded as scheduled on 9 December.&lt;ref name="Freedom"/&gt; Its targets were several large PLAN training camps, all of which were located no more than five kilometres from an adjacent FAPLA brigade headquarters.&lt;ref name=Scheepers/&gt; The four local FAPLA brigades represented one-seventh of the entire Angolan army, and three had substantial Soviet advisory contingents.&lt;ref name="Freedom"/&gt; Soviet General [[Valentin Varennikov]], who was instrumental in directing the Angolan defence, was confident that "given their numerical strength and armament, the brigades...[would] be able to repel any South African attack".&lt;ref name="Freedom"/&gt; FAPLA's Cuban allies were less optimistic: they noted that the brigades were isolated, incapable of reinforcing each other quickly, and possessed insufficient mobile anti-aircraft weapons to protect them outside their bases.&lt;ref name="Freedom"/&gt; The Soviets recommended a static defence, appealing directly to Angolan president [[José Eduardo dos Santos]], while the Cubans urged a withdrawal.&lt;ref name="Freedom"/&gt; Caught between two conflicting recommendations, dos Santos hesitated, and the brigades were ultimately annihilated piecemeal by the advancing South African armoured columns.&lt;ref name="Freedom"/&gt; Amid the confusion, a number of Angolan troops managed to break out of the South African encirclement and move north to link up with Cuban units,&lt;ref name="Freedom"/&gt; but a total of 471 FAPLA/PLAN personnel were killed or captured.&lt;ref name=Harmse&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harmse|first1=Kyle|last2=Dunstan|first2=Simon|title=South African Armour of the Border War 1975–89|date=23 February 2017|pages=31-38|publisher=Osprey Publishing|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1472817433}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite achieving their objectives during Operation Askari, the South African forces had encountered unexpectedly determined resistance from PLAN and FAPLA.&lt;ref name=Jaster/&gt; The SADF acknowledged 25 killed in action and 94 wounded, the highest number of casualties suffered in any single operation since Operation Savannah.&lt;ref name=Harmse/&gt; FAPLA also claimed to have shot down 4 South African aircraft.&lt;ref name=Arguments&gt;{{cite book|last=Crawford|first=Neta|title=Argument and Change in World Politics: Ethics, Decolonization, and Humanitarian Intervention|year=2002|pages=374-378|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0521002790}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lusaka Accords===
{{main article|Lusaka Accords}}

On 6 January 1984, [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 546]] was adopted with thirteen votes in favour and two abstentions, by the US and UK.&lt;ref name="Freedom"/&gt; The resolution condemned Operation Askari and demanded South Africa's immediate and unconditional withdrawal from Angola.&lt;ref name="Freedom"/&gt; An earlier draft of the same text imposing mandatory trade sanctions on South Africa until it ceased cross-border raids was abandoned under American pressure.&lt;ref name="Freedom"/&gt; The Soviet Union announced that it had reached yet another, more comprehensive agreement with Angola to bolster FAPLA's defence capabilities, and delivered the public warning to South Africa that "further aggression cannot be left unpunished".&lt;ref name=SFP/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jaster/&gt;

[[File:SADF-Captured-9K31 Strela-1-001.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|FAPLA [[9K31 Strela-1]] air defence system captured by the SADF during Operation Askari.]]
Askari had shaken the South African government's confidence in its ability to retain the military advantage indefinitely in Angola.&lt;ref name=Jaster/&gt; Heavier and more sophisticated weapons were being used, the rate of casualties had increased, and the air superiority that had accounted for many of the SADF's previous successes was diminishing.&lt;ref name=Jaster/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brothers/&gt; Nor was Botha and his cabinet certain of continued political and diplomatic support from the US, which had chosen to abstain rather than exercise its veto with regard to UN Security Council Resolution 546.&lt;ref name=Jaster/&gt; The Reagan administration perceived that both Angola and South Africa had grown weary of the war and were more susceptible to pressure for a ceasefire and mutual disengagement.&lt;ref name=Jaster/&gt; American diplomats offered to mediate peace talks accordingly, and on 13 February South African and Angolan officials met for the first time in Lusaka.&lt;ref name="Freedom"/&gt; Three days later, South Africa announced that it would withdraw its expeditionary forces from Cunene Province by the end of March,&lt;ref name=Arguments/&gt; provided the Angolans agreed to prevent PLAN from taking advantage of the situation to infiltrate South West Africa.&lt;ref name=Jaster/&gt; The Angolan government pledged to restrain PLAN and MK, and to prohibit any movement of Cuban troops southward towards the border.&lt;ref name=Hughes/&gt; These respective commitments were formalised as the [[Lusaka Accords]].&lt;ref name=Hughes/&gt; FAPLA and the SADF agreed to set up a Joint Monitoring Commission (JMC) to police the disengagement.&lt;ref name="Freedom"/&gt; Under the JMC, joint South African and Angolan patrols were carried out along six hundred kilometres of the border.&lt;ref name=Brothers/&gt;

Cuba and the Soviet Union were not consulted on the Lusaka Accords until after they had been signed.&lt;ref name="Freedom"/&gt; In a heated exchange with President dos Santos, Fidel Castro complained, "the final decision was yours, not ours, but at least we could have talked beforehand, and we, as well as the Soviets, could have expressed our disagreement beforehand...both the Soviets and us, your two main allies, the two who support Angola, who have been making immense efforts on your behalf, we were faced with a ''fait accompli''".&lt;ref name="Freedom"/&gt;

UNITA denounced the Lusaka Accords, insisting that any peace effort which excluded it would fail.&lt;ref name=Brothers/&gt; PLAN also routinely violated the disengagement area, prompting the SADF to delay and later cancel its withdrawal.&lt;ref name=Arguments/&gt; In July 1984 South Africa formally announced that it would not withdraw from Angola, citing widespread PLAN activity in the border region.&lt;ref name=Arguments/&gt;

===Operation Argon===
{{main article|Operation Argon}}

The truce between South Africa and Angola survived only about fifteen months.&lt;ref name="Freedom"/&gt; Negotiations for completing the SADF withdrawal were stalled due to intransigence on both sides concerning the linkage policy, with the two governments clashing over timetables for the withdrawal of Cuban troops and Namibian independence, respectively.&lt;ref name="Freedom"/&gt; While the Soviet Union and Cuba did nothing to impede the dialogue, they feared that Luanda might sacrifice PLAN and MK by agreeing to expel them from the country.&lt;ref name="Freedom"/&gt; Castro confided to Soviet officials that he had no intention of authorising a withdrawal of Cuban forces if the Angolan government signed a non-aggression pact with South Africa similar to the [[Nkomati Accord]].&lt;ref name="Freedom"/&gt; As a last resort, the Cuban presence in Angola would be maintained unilaterally for the purpose of aiding PLAN, with or without Luanda's approval.&lt;ref name="Freedom"/&gt;

In October 1984, dos Santos blamed South Africa for stalling the implementation of the Lusaka Accords and called for the US to resolve the impasse by exerting pressure on Botha.&lt;ref name=Destruction/&gt; On 17 November, dos Santos proposed a five-point peace plan on the following terms: a complete SADF withdrawal from Angola, a renewed ceasefire agreement, a formal pledge by the South African government to begin implementing Namibian independence under the terms of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 435]], a formal pledge by the Angolan government to begin implementing a three year phased withdrawal of all but 5,000 Cuban troops, and recognition of SWAPO and Cuba as an equal party in negotiations.&lt;ref name=Destruction/&gt; Botha wanted all the Cuban military personnel to be withdrawn, and over a period of twelve months rather than three years.&lt;ref name=Destruction/&gt; He also countered that the Namibian independence process could only take place once the Cuban withdrawal was initiated.&lt;ref name=Destruction/&gt;

The Lusaka Accords were abandoned in the wake of [[Operation Argon]], a failed sabotage mission carried out by South African special forces in Angola's oil-rich [[Cabinda Province|Cabinda exclave]].&lt;ref name=Hughes/&gt; Four years of military escalation and massive defence expenditures had a drastic impact on Angola's state finances, which were only being balanced by petroleum revenue.&lt;ref name=Hatzky/&gt; The largest oil refinery in the country was located on the Cabindan coast and operated by a US firm, [[Gulf Oil]], under the auspices of the Cabina-Gulf Oil National Petroleum Company of Angola (SONAGOL).&lt;ref name=Destruction/&gt; By 1984 Gulf had invested over 1.3 billion dollars in its Cabinda operation, which was exporting 165,495 barrels of oil per day.&lt;ref name=Destruction/&gt; At the time, the revenue from the Gulf refinery generated 90% of Angola's foreign exchange.&lt;ref name=Destruction/&gt; The Reagan administration separated its political positions on Angola from its position on SONAGOL, with Crocker hoping that American multinational companies in general, and Gulf in particular, would be a moderating force on the Marxist government.&lt;ref name=Destruction/&gt; South Africa had noted the critical importance of the refinery's contribution to the FAPLA war effort and had begun investigating ways to disrupt it without incurring the ire of the US, which would have to react if American commercial interests were threatened.&lt;ref name=Fist/&gt; The SADF believed that a covert sabotage operation was possible, as long as the destruction was not attributable to South Africa and a credible cover story could be used to link the attack to a domestic Angolan movement such as UNITA or the [[Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda]] (FLEC).&lt;ref name=Fist/&gt; An attack on the oil platforms was ruled out, as this was beyond the capabilities of either UNITA or FLEC, so the SADF opted to infiltrate the refinery's oil storage facilities and mine the fuel tanks.&lt;ref name=Fist/&gt; The damage incurred would cripple Angola's ability to finance its military operations and give it greater economic incentive to accede to South African demands in the ongoing negotiations rather than risk returning to war.&lt;ref name="NYT4"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/01/world/pretoria-cools-to-us-backed-talks.html|title=Pretoria cools to US-backed talks|work=The New York Times|date=1 June 1985|accessdate=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sabotage mission received the codename Operation Argon, and 15 South African special forces operators deployed to Cabinda by sea in May 1985.&lt;ref name=Brothers/&gt; They were discovered by a FAPLA patrol during the infiltration attempt, and two of the raiders were shot dead with a third, Captain Wynand Petrus du Toit, being captured.&lt;ref name=Brothers/&gt; Under interrogation, du Toit confessed that the objective of Argon was to sabotage the storage tanks at Cabinda Gulf.&lt;ref name=Brothers/&gt; The South African government disavowed du Toit and denied responsibility, but General Viljoen later confirmed the SADF's role in the operation.&lt;ref name=Brothers/&gt; Consequently, the ceasefire imposed as a result of the Lusaka Accords collapsed, and further peace talks were abandoned.&lt;ref name=Brothers/&gt;

The diplomatic repercussions of Operation Argon's failure were immense. Castro believed the failed raid indicated that the US and South Africa were not truly committed to peace, and had been dishonest during the ceasefire negotiations.&lt;ref name="James"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Political History of the Civil War in Angola: 1974-1990|last=James III|first=W.

[[File:Jonas Savimbi.jpg|thumb|UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi.]]
In early 1984, just after South Africa and Angola had agreed to the principles of a peace settlement, UNITA had seized the opportunity to issue its own demanding conditions under which it would also accept the terms of a ceasefire.&lt;ref name=Arnold&gt;{{cite book|last=Arnold|first=Guy|title=Wars in the Third World Since 1945|year=2016|pages=340-349|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing Plc|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-14742-9102-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Savimbi requested a government of national unity with the MPLA in which he was granted a part, and threatened to begin attacking major cities if he was ignored.&lt;ref name=Arnold/&gt; In this manner Savimbi sought to interlace conditionality over an SADF and FAPLA disengagement with his own conflict of interests with the Angolan regime.&lt;ref name=Arnold/&gt; Although Botha approved of UNITA as an ostensibly anti-communist movement, he did nothing to impress Savimbi's demands on dos Santos.&lt;ref name=Brothers/&gt; UNITA responded by raiding [[Sumbe]], a settlement two hundred and sixty kilometres to the south of Luanda.&lt;ref name=Arnold/&gt; That June, UNITA sabotaged the oil pipeline in Cabinda, kidnapping 16 British expatriate workers and a Portuguese technician.&lt;ref name=Arnold/&gt; Six months later the insurgents raided [[Cafunfo]], killing 100 FAPLA personnel.&lt;ref name=Arnold/&gt; Most of these attacks were planned and executed from [[Jamba, Cuando Cubango|Jamba]], a town in [[Cuando Cubango Province]], which Savimbi had proclaimed UNITA's new national headquarters.&lt;ref name="Brittain"&gt;{{cite book |last=Brittain |first=Victoria |year=1998 |title=Death of Dignity: Angola's Civil War |publisher=Pluto Press |location=London |isbn=978-0-7453-1247-7 |pages=11–12, 27-36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jamba had no prior strategic significance, possessed no agricultural base, and had limited access to fresh water, but it was located as far away from FAPLA bases as possible and within easy reach of SADF bases in Ovamboland and the Caprivi Strip.&lt;ref name="Brittain"/&gt; FAPLA had deserted the region for precisely this reason, withdrawing north after Operation Protea,&lt;ref name="MAA"/&gt; but in the process left behind a power vacuum which Savimbi was quick to exploit.&lt;ref name=Hughes/&gt; Savimbi used Jamba to augment UNITA's public image, investing heavily in local infrastructure.&lt;ref name="Brittain"/&gt; He opened the settlement to American and South African journalists, honed his public relations skills in frequent press conferences denouncing the MPLA, and lobbied for Western aid.&lt;ref name="Brittain"/&gt; Under the [[Reagan Doctrine]], the US government opened covert channels to provide military assistance to UNITA.&lt;ref name=Destruction/&gt; It repealed the [[Clark Amendment]], which explicitly barred further CIA support for the UNITA and the FNLA, allowing the agency to resume Angolan operations.&lt;ref name=Reagan&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott|first=James|title=Deciding to Intervene: The Reagan Doctrine and American Foreign Policy|year=1997|pages=136-143|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham, North Carolina|isbn=978-0822317890}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Angolan government asserted this was "proof of the complicity there has always been between the US executive and the retrograde racist Pretoria regime" and it had "no alternative but to suspend the contacts it has had with US government envoys".&lt;ref name=Dimensions/&gt;

In 1986, Savimbi visited Washington, where he met with American officials and was promised military hardware valued at about ten million dollars, including [[FIM-92 Stinger]] surface-to-air missiles and [[BGM-71 TOW]] anti-tank missiles.&lt;ref name=Brothers/&gt; The US also pledged to continue its support for UNITA even if it lost the umbrella of protection conferred by the SADF presence in southern Angola.&lt;ref name=Reagan/&gt;

At the US government's request, South Africa began lending UNITA a greater degree of material assistance, and aided the CIA in the acquisition of untraceable arms for the Angolan insurgents.&lt;ref name=Destruction/&gt; The CIA was interested in acquiring Soviet and Eastern European arms for UNITA, as they could be easily passed off as weapons individual partisans had captured from FAPLA.&lt;ref name=Destruction/&gt; South Africa possessed a vast stockpile of Soviet arms seized during Operations Sceptic, Protea, and Askari, and was persuaded to transfer some of it to UNITA.&lt;ref name="Weigert"/&gt;

===The regional arms race===
After Operation Savannah had failed to prevent the ascension of the MPLA in Angola, the South African political leadership generally accepted that reversing that verdict by force was unrealistic.&lt;ref name=Minter&gt;{{cite book|last=Minter|first=William|title=Apartheid's Contras: An Inquiry into the Roots of War in Angola and Mozambique|year=1994|pages=127–139|publisher=Witwatersrand University Press|location=Johannesburg|isbn=978-1439216187}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Vorster and Botha had recognised that a total military defeat of PLAN was elusive without the impossible corollary of a victory over the combined FAPLA-PLAN alliance in Angola.&lt;ref name=Minter/&gt; Some hardliners in their respective administrations wanted South Africa's full military weight behind Savimbi to help him extinguish the MPLA government, while others favoured simply using it to wage a limited containment exercise against PLAN.&lt;ref name=Minter/&gt; An offensive strategy which offered the chance to aggressively attack Angola by land, sea, and air and focus directly on the MPLA's centres of power was never discussed and became more remote as time went on.&lt;ref name=Minter/&gt; In its place, therefore, the other popular option was promulgated, which was to focus chiefly on fighting PLAN, the primary threat within the geographical limits of South West Africa proper, and attempting to intimidate Angola in the form of punitive cross-border raids, thus assuming an essentially defensive posture.&lt;ref name=Minter/&gt;

While Botha never seriously considered the overthrow of the MPLA as a viable objective, he endorsed increasing aid to UNITA for several reasons: it would mend diplomatic relations with the US, especially after the debacle of Operation Argon, UNITA could be molded into a proxy to harass PLAN, and donating captured weapons to Savimbi was cost-effective and deniable.&lt;ref name=Minter/&gt;

US and South African justification for arming UNITA lay partly in the increased supply by the Soviet Union of more sophisticated weapons to FAPLA, as well as the increased number of Cuban troops in Angola, which had rapidly swelled from 25,000 to 31,000 by the end of 1985.&lt;ref name=Barber/&gt; While the Lusaka Accords were still in force, the Cuban and Soviet military delegations had urged dos Santos to take advantage of the ceasefire with the SADF to eliminate UNITA.&lt;ref name="MacFarlane"/&gt; There was a considerable increase in Soviet military assistance to Angola during this period, with the transfer of another billion dollars' worth of arms to FAPLA, including about 200 new T-55 and T-62 tanks.&lt;ref name="MacFarlane"/&gt; Moscow trained more Angolan pilots and delivered more advanced fighter aircraft to Luanda, particularly [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23]]s.&lt;ref name=Vanneman/&gt; Over a three year period Angola had become the second largest importer of arms on the African continent.&lt;ref name=Fist/&gt; FAPLA's arsenal expanded so exponentially that the SADF became convinced that the Soviet-sponsored arms buildup was intended for deployment elsewhere.&lt;ref name=Barber/&gt; General Malan gave a speech in which he expressed alarm at the "flood" of Soviet military equipment and its sophisticated nature, claiming that it was much more than needed to cope with the SADF's limited expeditionary forces and UNITA.&lt;ref name=Barber/&gt; Malan theorised that "the Russians want to develop a strong, stabilised base in Angola and then use the equipment and personnel positioned there wherever necessary in the subcontinent".&lt;ref name=Barber/&gt; South Africa gradually became locked in a conventional arms race with Angola; each side argued that it had to match the increased force available to the other.&lt;ref name=Faraway&gt;{{cite book|last1=Liebenberg|first1=Ian|last2=Risquet|first2=Jorge|last3=Shubin|first3=Vladimir|title=A Far-Away War: Angola, 1975-1989|year=1997|page=44, 64-68|publisher=Sun Media Press|location=Stellenbosch|isbn=978-1-920689-72-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; To counter the appearance of advanced MiG-23 and Sukhoi fighters in Angola, for instance, South Africa began development on two sophisticated fighter aircraft of its own, the [[Atlas Cheetah]] and the [[Atlas Carver]].&lt;ref name="Isolated"&gt;{{cite book|last=Geldenhuys|first=Deon|title=Isolated States: A Comparative Analysis|year=1990|page=510|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0521283267}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both programmes would consume in excess of 2 billion dollars.&lt;ref name="Olivier"/&gt;

Intending to wrest back the initiative, sever UNITA's logistics lifelines to South West Africa and Zaire, and forestall any future insurgent offensives, FAPLA launched Operation Saluting October in mid-1987.&lt;ref name=Hot/&gt; The impetus for Saluting October likely originated with the Soviet military mission, which pressed the idea of a major conventional thrust to destroy UNITA's southeastern front as early as 1983.&lt;ref name=Hot/&gt; It had received a new commander that year, Lieutenant General Petr Gusev, former deputy commander of the [[Carpathian Military District]].&lt;ref name=Hot/&gt; In light of the war's length, its cost, the rising death toll, and looming cuts in the Soviet military expenditure which would limit future efforts to support FAPLA's war effort, Gusev wanted a decisive multi-divisional offensive to crush UNITA once and for all.&lt;ref name=Chan&gt;{{cite book|last=Chan|first=Stephen|title=Southern Africa: Old Treacheries and New Deceits|year=2012|pages=42-46|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, Connecticut|isbn=978-0300184280}}&lt;/ref&gt; Operation Saluting October was a two-pronged offensive aimed at retaking three major settlements from UNITA,  Cangamba, Cassamba, and [[Mavinga]].&lt;ref name=Stapleton2/&gt;&lt;ref name="MAA"/&gt; The FAPLA command staff intended the attack on Cangamba and Cassamba as a feint, hoping to draw UNITA forces there and away from Mavinga.&lt;ref name=Stapleton2/&gt;&lt;ref name="MAA"/&gt; Once Mavinga was in government hands, FAPLA could expel the remaining insurgents from [[Moxico Province]] and pave the way for a final assault on Savimbi's headquarters at Jamba.&lt;ref name=Stapleton2/&gt; Between 9 and 4 Soviet advisers were to be attached on the battalion level, albeit with strict orders not to participate in the fighting and withdraw from the front as necessary to avoid contact with UNITA.&lt;ref name=Vanneman/&gt; They were accompanied by a small number of Cuban advisers and East German technical personnel serving in a variety of support roles.&lt;ref name=Stapleton2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vanneman/&gt;

Gusev and his staff appealed to Moscow for more aid to FAPLA, particularly strike aircraft, for another offensive; this request was granted.&lt;ref name=Chan/&gt; In what had become an annual practice, an estimated billion dollars' worth of arms was flown into Luanda by Soviet [[Antonov An-24]] flights, as many as 12 per day for a six month period.&lt;ref name=Vanneman/&gt; The equipment was offloaded in the capital and transferred to Angolan [[Ilyushin Il-76]]s, which in turn flew them directly to the front.&lt;ref name=Vanneman/&gt;

To FAPLA, the experience of planning and executing an operation of such massive proportions was relatively new, but the Soviet military mission was convinced that a decade of exhaustive training on its part had created an army capable of undertaking a complex multi-divisional offensive.&lt;ref name=Stapleton2/&gt; The Angolan brigade commanders had repeatedly expressed reservations about splitting the force and fighting on two fronts, arguing that a single assault on Mavinga would be more linear and sufficient.&lt;ref name=Stapleton2/&gt; FAPLA's Cuban advisers objected on the grounds that South Africa might intervene on behalf of its erstwhile ally.&lt;ref name=Stapleton2/&gt; "Don't get into such wasting, costly, and finally pointless offensives," Castro had vented to Gusev's staff.

The preliminary phase of the new offensive began in August 1987.&lt;ref name="MAA"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Faraway/&gt; Eight FAPLA brigades deployed to Tumpo, a region to the east of Cuito Cuanavale in early August, where on Soviet advice they temporarily paused for more supplies and reinforcements.&lt;ref name=Stapleton2/&gt; This would prove to be a fatal error.&lt;ref name=Stapleton2/&gt; On 14 August, having lost days of precious time, FAPLA resumed its efforts to advance; by then South Africa had launched [[Operation Moduler]] to halt the offensive.&lt;ref name="MAA"/&gt; The bloody campaign that followed entailed a series of engagements known collectively as the [[Battle of Cuito Cuanavale]].&lt;ref name=Hot/&gt;

[[File:The Hind Memorial.jpg|thumb|upright=1|left|Signal bell used by FAPLA's 47 Infantry Brigade at the Lomba River.]]
Because of FAPLA's delays, the SADF was able to assemble a blocking force strong enough to stop the FAPLA drive on Mavinga.&lt;ref name="Polack"/&gt; By the end of August, South African expeditionary forces had built up to include 32 Battalion, elements of the [[61 Mechanised Battalion Group]], and the SWATF's [[101 Battalion (South Africa)|101 Battalion]].&lt;ref name=Brothers/&gt; There were three major rivers and nine tributaries between Cuito Cuanavale and Mavinga.&lt;ref name="Polack"/&gt; Although none of the rivers were especially large, all the prospective crossing points were adjacent to vast expanses of swamps and waterlogged flood plains.&lt;ref name="Polack"/&gt; They stalled the FAPLA advance and permitted the SADF to create effective choke points which further hampered FAPLA's progress.&lt;ref name="Polack"/&gt; The South African general staff judged correctly that if these narrow entry points were seriously contested they had the potential to bottleneck entire brigades.&lt;ref name="Polack"/&gt; They opted to launch a counteroffensive at the Lomba River, which was the last of the three rivers FAPLA had to cross before reaching Mavinga.&lt;ref name="Polack"/&gt; The success of the South African counteroffensive was ensured by the rapid collapse of FAPLA's 47 Infantry Brigade, which was tasked with establishing a bridgehead on the Lomba's southern bank.&lt;ref name="Mannall"&gt;{{cite book | first = David | last = Mannall| title = Battle on the Lomba 1987: The Day a South African Armoured Battalion shattered Angola's Last Mechanized Offensive|edition= 2014|pages=140—157 | publisher = Helion and Company| isbn= 978-1-909982-02-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Operation Moduler, Cuban combat troops had remained well north of the Lomba River and declined to participate in the fighting, per Castro's instructions.&lt;ref name="Freedom"/&gt; In Luanda, President dos Santos summoned General Gusev and the senior Cuban general officer, Gustavo Fleitas Ramirez, for an urgent conference to discuss the worsening military situation and the failure of Operation Saluting October.&lt;ref name="Freedom"/&gt; Ramirez reminded dos Santos that Cuba had been opposed to the offensive from the beginning.&lt;ref name="Freedom"/&gt; Gusev lamented in his memoirs that "I informed [chief of the Soviet general staff] [[Sergey Akhromeyev|Akhromeyev]] about the result of the operation, but the most difficult task, in moral terms, was to inform the president of Angola, whom I had assured that the operation would succeed and that Savimbi would be crushed".&lt;ref name="Freedom"/&gt;

The Cubans and Soviets concurred with FAPLA's decision to withdraw to Cuito Cuanavale, with Castro pointing out that a strong defensive stand could plausibly be made there if the brigades managed to reach it.&lt;ref name="Freedom"/&gt; He also suggested that the only way to defeat the South African expeditionary forces in the long term was to outflank them and apply pressure to the South West African border.&lt;ref name="George"/&gt; This would entail opening up yet another military front, in southwestern Angola, well south of Cuito Cuanavale.&lt;ref name="George"/&gt; On 15 November, dos Santos had written a letter to Castro requesting direct Cuban military assistance against the SADF.&lt;ref name="George"/&gt; Castro agreed on the condition that he and General Arnaldo Ochoa receive command of all FAPLA forces on the front.&lt;ref name=Fidel/&gt; The Soviet military mission was notably excluded from all future operational planning.&lt;ref name="Freedom"/&gt; Shortly afterwards, the Cuban government authorised the deployment of an armoured brigade and several air defence units—about 3,000 personnel—to Cuito Cuanavale.&lt;ref name=Stapleton2/&gt; Castro suspected that the South Africans would not be content with eliminating FAPLA east of the town and that they intended to take control of Cuito Cuanavale's strategic airfield as well.&lt;ref name=Fidel/&gt; His strategy was to strengthen the defence of that settlement while dispatching a few more brigades to Lobito, near the South West African border.&lt;ref name="Freedom"/&gt;

The FAPLA and Cuban defenders now ringed their defensive positions with minefields and interlocking fields of fire from dug-in tanks and field guns, into which they channelled SADF assaults.&lt;ref name="Bridgland"&gt;{{cite book |first=Fred |last=Bridgland |title=The War for Africa: Twelve months that transformed a continent |year=1990 |publisher=Ashanti Publishing |location=Gibraltar |pages=196-197, 300-327 |isbn=978-1-874800-12-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; On multiple occasions the combined UNITA and SADF forces launched unsuccessful offensives which became bogged down in minefields along narrow avenues of approach and were abandoned when the attackers came under heavy fire from the Cuban and FAPLA artillerymen west of the Cuito River.&lt;ref name="MAA"/&gt; The defenders' artillery was sited just beyond the maximum range of the South African artillery and on high ground which gave them a commanding view of the battlefield.&lt;ref name="George"/&gt; This advantage, coupled with the proliferation of minefields, and heavily reinforced FAPLA-Cuban defensive positions rendered further attacks by the South African troops futile.&lt;ref name="George"/&gt;

Operations Hooper and Packer were terminated after the SADF had killed almost 700 FAPLA troops and destroyed about half of the Angolan brigades' remaining tanks and armoured vehicles.&lt;ref name=Stapleton2/&gt; Cuba had suffered 42 dead and the loss of 6 tanks.&lt;ref name=Stapleton2/&gt; South African casualties were relatively light: 13 dead and several dozen severely wounded.&lt;ref name=Stapleton2/&gt; Three SADF tanks were also abandoned in a minefield, while most of the others were damaged beyond immediate repair or rendered unserviceable due to mechanical problems.&lt;ref name=Stapleton2/&gt; UNITA suffered thousands of casualties, prompting accusations that its troops had been used as "cannon fodder" by the SADF.&lt;ref name="George"/&gt; Cuban post-action reports claimed that UNITA insurgents had been sent through the minefields at gunpoint to clear the way for the South African armour.&lt;ref name="George"/&gt;

The Tumpo Triangle campaign exposed several flaws in the planning of the South African defence chiefs and general staff.&lt;ref name="Saney"/&gt; They had estimated quite accurately that their forces would be able to inflict a crushing defeat on FAPLA in the flood plains and open terrain south of Cuito Cuanavale.&lt;ref name="Saney"/&gt; But they had not anticipated so many Angolan units would survive and establish strong defensive lines in the Tumpo Triangle, or that the addition of Cuban troops there would stiffen the resistance considerably.&lt;ref name="Saney"/&gt; Further South African miscalculations appeared in the latter phases of the campaign.&lt;ref name="StrategicOps"/&gt; One was the assumption that the small and highly mobile but lightly armed SADF expeditionary force was suited to mounting frontal attacks on well-prepared defenders supported by dug in artillery west of Cuito.&lt;ref name="StrategicOps"/&gt; The use of battalions trained and organised for mobile warfare in this manner was in violation of the SADF's own mechanised doctrine.&lt;ref name="StrategicOps"/&gt; The defending Angolans had ample armour, anti-tank weapons, and the benefit of air cover: the Soviet Union's increased willingness to supply FAPLA with advanced fighter aircraft and even Soviet pilots on loan posed a serious threat to South African air operations over Cuito Cuanavale.&lt;ref name=Chan/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nugent&gt;{{cite book|last=Nugent|first=Paul|title=Africa Since Independence|year=1997|page=294|publisher=Palgrave-Macmillan|location=Basingstoke|isbn=978-0230272880}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Soviet involvement grew, and the number of air battles increased, South Africa's air force began encountering MiG-21 and MiG-23 fighters flown by well-trained Soviet pilots.&lt;ref name=Chan/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vanneman/&gt; Furthermore, Angolan pilots newly trained under Soviet supervision at Lubango were proving more capable of challenging South African fighters.&lt;ref name=Vanneman/&gt; For the first time the SADF began losing aircraft in numbers, indicating the contested extent of the Angolan skies.&lt;ref name=SACP/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vanneman/&gt;

===Final Cuban offensive===

Although the SADF and UNITA counteroffensive had been checked, FAPLA remained heavily strained and more dependent than before on its Cuban allies and Soviet materiel.&lt;ref name=Dimensions/&gt; This gave dos Santos an incentive to ease the military dilemma with negotiations and he reopened the possibility of reaching a new ceasefire and disengagement agreement with South Africa.&lt;ref name=Dimensions/&gt; As early as January 1987, Chester Crocker had responded to positive signals from Luanda, especially when President [[Denis Sassou Nguesso]] of the [[People's Republic of the Congo]] offered to mediate peace talks between the rival states.&lt;ref name=Dimensions/&gt; Yet preliminary discussions in [[Brazzaville]] throughout late 1987 and early 1988 remained stymied by the Angolan government's refusal to compromise on the timetable for a proposed Cuban withdrawal.&lt;ref name=Dimensions/&gt; The Cuban government had not been consulted on the Brazzaville talks in advance and resented what it perceived as a discourtesy on the part of dos Santos.&lt;ref name=Dimensions/&gt; This factor had the effect of persuading Castro to make an authoritative bid to join the Angolan-US peace talks.&lt;ref name=Crocker/&gt; He was determined that Cuba no longer be excluded from negotiations concerning its own military, and the results of any future settlement on the withdrawal process leave Cuba's image untarnished.&lt;ref name=Dimensions/&gt; 

[[File:SA-3 Goa Cuba.JPG|thumb|upright=1.1|Cuban S-125 "SA-3 Goa" missile systems on parade. Many were shipped to Angola in 1988 to provide air cover for Castro's offensive.&lt;ref name="Blank"/&gt;]]
While Operation Hooper was underway in late January 1988, Crocker relented to pressure and accepted Cuba as an equal partner in further peace talks.&lt;ref name="George"/&gt; Castro agreed that he would not introduce extraneous issues to the agenda, such as [[Cuba–United States relations|Cuba–US relations]], and that discussion of a phased troop withdrawal would extend to all Cuban military personnel stationed in Angola, including combat troops, logistical staff, and advisers.&lt;ref name="George"/&gt; With Cuba's entry into the Brazzaville talks, its desire to shift its military involvement in Angola from a passive, defensive role to an offensive one intensified.&lt;ref name=Vanneman/&gt; Castro opted to escalate ground operations against the SADF, since he considered diplomatic progress impossible as long as South Africa still clung to the likelihood of a tactical victory.&lt;ref name=Vanneman/&gt; He retained a solely defensive posture at Cuito Cuanavale, keeping the SADF fixed in place, while carrying out his longstanding proposal to launch a flanking manoeuvre towards the South West African border.&lt;ref name="Saney"/&gt;

It was a risky operation, beginning with a movement of Cuban troops in divisional strength west of the Cunene River, which had the potential to expand into an invasion of South West Africa.&lt;ref name="StrategicOps"/&gt; On 9 March, Castro sent the Cuban forces massed at Lobito, which had grown to about 40,000 men, southwards.&lt;ref name="Leavenworth"&gt;{{cite paper|title=Contested Narratives: South African and Cuban Military Action in Angola (1987–1988)|last=Williams|first=Jayson|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/1022293.pdf|location=[[Fort Leavenworth, Kansas]]|publisher=[[United States Army Command and General Staff College]]|year=2016|accessdate=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He likened their movement to "a boxer who with his left hand blocks the blow [at Cuito Cuanavale] and with his right – strikes [in the west]".&lt;ref name="StrategicOps"/&gt; "That way," Castro recounted on another occasion, "while the South African troops were being bled slowly dry in Cuito Cuanavale, down in the southwest...40,000 Cuban soldiers...backed by about 600 tanks, hundreds of artillery pieces, 1,000 anti-aircraft weapons, and the daring MiG-23 units that took over the skies, advanced towards the Namibian border, ready to sweep away the South African forces".&lt;ref name=Fidel/&gt;

As the Cuban brigades advanced, they accumulated thousands of PLAN insurgents, who departed their bases to join the offensive.&lt;ref name=Vanneman/&gt; The presence of so many Cuban troops effectively resuscitated PLAN's sagging fortunes, as it curtailed new South African military initiatives against the insurgents not only in Angola but South West Africa as well.&lt;ref name=Vanneman/&gt; Firstly, the region being occupied by the Cubans just north of the border was the same territory the SADF had monitored and patrolled for almost a decade in order to prevent PLAN infiltration into Ovamboland.&lt;ref name=Vanneman/&gt; Secondly, all South African units near the border had ceased routine counter-insurgency operations while they were being mobilised to resist a potential Cuban invasion.&lt;ref name=Vanneman/&gt; Matters were complicated further when the Cubans formed three joint battalions with PLAN fighters, each with its own artillery and armoured contingents.&lt;ref name=Vanneman/&gt; Due to the integration of the insurgents with Cuban personnel at the battalion level, South African patrols found it impossible to engage PLAN in Angola without risking a much larger confrontation involving aggressive and well-armed Cuban troops.&lt;ref name="StrategicOps"/&gt;

The limited SADF troops available near the border could not halt the continued progress of the Cuban army or reduce the threat to South West Africa.&lt;ref name="StrategicOps"/&gt; There were simply too few men to hold the broad defensive positions along the Cutline against a conventional force in divisional strength.&lt;ref name="StrategicOps"/&gt; When South African officials warned against an invasion of South West Africa, Castro retorted that they were "in no position to demand anything".&lt;ref name=Vanneman/&gt; Havana also issued an ambiguous statement which read, "we are not saying we will not go into Namibia".&lt;ref name=Vanneman/&gt; The South African government responded by mobilising 140,000 reservists—a figure almost unprecedented in SADF history—and threatening severe repercussions on any Cuban unit which crossed the border.&lt;ref name=Cochran/&gt;

===1988 Tripartite Accord===

Despite taking the necessary countermeasures on the battlefield, the South African government discerned it had reached the political limits of further escalation in Angola.&lt;ref name=SACP/&gt; The casualties sustained during the Cuito Cuanavale campaign had been sufficient to cause public alarm and provoke difficult questions about the tactical situation on the border and why South African soldiers were dying there.&lt;ref name=SACP/&gt; There was little reason to believe yet another bloody campaign would be successful in expelling the Soviets and Cuba from the region; on the contrary, as in the past, it could lead to an increase in the amount of Soviet weapons and Cuban troops.&lt;ref name=Crocker/&gt; The conflict had also evolved from a low-intensity struggle against lightly armed insurgents into protracted battles between armies backed by all the paraphernalia of modern conventional warfare, with the accompanying rise in human and material costs.&lt;ref name=SACP/&gt; This contributed to a sense of war weariness and increased the growing skepticism and sensitivity in civilian circles toward the SADF's Angolan operations.&lt;ref name=Rothschild1/&gt;

The failure of the Soviet-supervised Operation Saluting October, along with the consequent destruction of hundreds of millions of dollars' of FAPLA's Soviet-supplied arms, had the effect of moderating Moscow's stance on Angola.&lt;ref name=Crocker/&gt; In a notable departure from its previous foreign policy stance, the Soviet Union disclosed it too was weary of the Angolan and South West African conflicts and was prepared to assist in a peace process—even one conducted on the basis of Cuban linkage.&lt;ref name=Zartman&gt;{{cite book|last=Zartman|first=I. William|editor-last=Faure|editor-first=Guy Olivier|title=Escalation and Negotiation in International Conflicts|year=2005|pages=173-174|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0521672610}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reformist premier [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] also wished to reduce defence expenditures, including the enormous open-ended commitment of military aid to FAPLA, and was more open to a political settlement accordingly.&lt;ref name=Dimensions/&gt;

[[File:Chester Crocker 2006.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.8|Chester Crocker, US diplomat. Crocker's influence and mediation was instrumental in talks which established the [[Tripartite Accord (Angola)|Tripartite Accord]].&lt;ref name="LeoGrande"/&gt;]]
For South Africa and the Soviet Union—the two parties which had previously refrained from joining the US-mediated talks—the point had now been reached where the costs of continuing the war exceeded its anticipated benefits.&lt;ref name=Crocker/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dimensions/&gt; This necessitated a change in perceptions in both nations, which began warming to the possibility of a negotiated peace.&lt;ref name=Crocker/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dimensions/&gt; The Soviet government agreed to jointly sponsor with the US a series of renewed peace talks on 3 and 4 May 1988.&lt;ref name=SACP/&gt; For its part, South Africa made its first bid to join the tripartite negotiations and agreed to send a delegation of diplomats, intelligence chiefs, and senior SADF officers.&lt;ref name=SACP/&gt; The Soviet and US diplomats in attendance, including Crocker, made it clear to the South Africans that they wanted peace in Angola and a political settlement in South West Africa.&lt;ref name=SACP/&gt; They were also agreed on the need to bring pressure on their respective allies to bring about a solution.&lt;ref name=SACP/&gt; South Africa would be expected to comply with United Nations Security Council Resolution 435, in exchange for the complete withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola.&lt;ref name="LeoGrande"&gt;{{cite book|last1=LeoGrande|first1=William M.|last2=Kornbluh|first2=Peter|title=Back Channel to Cuba: The Hidden History of Negotiations Between Washington and Havana|year=2014|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill|isbn=978-1469617633}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cuban and Angolan delegations had already assented to a complete Cuban withdrawal, and under US pressure produced an extremely precise timetable which extended this process over three to four years.&lt;ref name="LeoGrande"/&gt; South Africa found this unacceptable but conceded that the withdrawal could be timed to certain benchmarks in the Namibian independence process.&lt;ref name="LeoGrande"/&gt;

According to Crocker, the US decision to use Security Council Resolution 435 as the basis and pivot for a regional settlement provided leverage over the discussions.&lt;ref name=Crocker/&gt; The proposed formation of a UN "verification mission" to monitor Cuba's adherence to a withdrawal settlement proved instrumental in persuading the South African government that it would receive a balanced agreement.&lt;ref name=Crocker/&gt; The talks began progressing more smoothly after July 1988, when Carlos Aldana Escalante was appointed head of the Cuban delegation.&lt;ref name="LeoGrande"/&gt; Aldana was chief of ideological affairs and international relations for the [[Communist Party of Cuba]]; he was far better informed of foreign developments, particularly in the Soviet bloc, than many of his contemporaries.&lt;ref name="LeoGrande"/&gt; In light of Gorbachev's reforms, political developments in Eastern Europe, and the reduction of tensions between the superpowers, Aldana believed that Cuba needed to work swiftly towards normalising relations with the US.&lt;ref name="LeoGrande"/&gt; Cooperation vis-à-vis Southern Africa was seen as a natural prerequisite to better relations with Washington and possibly, a permanent bilateral dialogue.&lt;ref name="LeoGrande"/&gt;

Between May and September 1988 the parties met for several rounds of talks in Cairo, New York, Geneva, and Brazzaville, but remained deadlocked on the nuances of the withdrawal timetable.&lt;ref name=Hampson/&gt; The fact that there were two objectives—Namibian independence and a Cuban withdrawal—doubly aggravated the issue of timing and deadlines.&lt;ref name=Crocker/&gt; In August, the Angolan, Cuban, and South African delegations signed the Geneva Protocol, which established the principles for a peace settlement in South West Africa and committed the SADF to a withdrawal from that territory.&lt;ref name="Sitkowski"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sitkowski|first=Andrzej|title=UN peacekeeping: myth and reality|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|location=Westport, Connecticut|year=2006|pages=80-86|isbn=978-0-275-99214-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a direct result of the Geneva Protocol, PLAN declared a ceasefire effective from 10 August.&lt;ref name="Sitkowski"/&gt; The [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988 US presidential elections]] lent new urgency to the negotiations, which had recently stalled after six consecutive rounds of talks in Brazzaville.&lt;ref name=Hampson/&gt; Angola and Cuba had gambled heavily on a victory for [[Michael Dukakis]] and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] during the US elections, hoping that this would spell the end of US aid to UNITA and a harder line on South Africa.&lt;ref name="James"/&gt; At the time of the Geneva Protocol, dos Santos had commented that "if the Democrats had won the elections, there would be a readjustment in US policy, particularly on Southern Africa".&lt;ref name="James"/&gt; The ascension of [[George H. W. Bush]] had the effect of persuading the Angolan and Cuban delegations to be more flexible.&lt;ref name="James"/&gt; Crocker reiterated on several occasions that a new US administration meant changes in personnel and basic policy review, and pressed them not to waste months of effort.&lt;ref name=Crocker/&gt;

Three days after the US election results were released, the parties reconvened in Geneva and within the week had agreed to a phased Cuban withdrawal over the course of twenty seven months.&lt;ref name=Crocker/&gt;&lt;ref name="James"/&gt; In exchange, South Africa pledged to begin bestowing independence on South West Africa by 1 November 1989.&lt;ref name="James"/&gt; On 13 December, South Africa, Angola, and Cuba signed the [[Brazzaville Protocol]], which affirmed their commitment to these conditions and set up a Joint Military Monitoring Commission (JMMC) to supervise the disengagement in Angola.&lt;ref name="James"/&gt; The JMMC was to include Soviet and US observers.&lt;ref name="Sitkowski"/&gt; All hostilities between the belligerents, including PLAN, were to formally cease by 1 April 1989.&lt;ref name="Sitkowski"/&gt; On 22 December, the Brazzaville Protocol was enshrined in the [[Tripartite Accord (Angola)|Tripartite Accord]], which required the SADF to withdraw from Angola and reduce its troop levels in South West Africa to a token force of 1,500 within twelve weeks.&lt;ref name=Hampson/&gt; Simultaneously, all Cuban brigades would be withdrawn from the border to an area north of the [[15th parallel south|15th parallel]].&lt;ref name=Hampson/&gt; At least 3,000 Cuban military personnel would depart Angola by April 1989, with another 25,000 leaving within the next six months.&lt;ref name=Hampson/&gt; The remaining troops would depart at a date not later than 1 July 1991.&lt;ref name=Hampson/&gt; An additional condition was that South Africa would cease all support for UNITA, and Angola likewise for PLAN and MK.&lt;ref name="James"/&gt;

On 20 December, [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 626]] was passed, creating the [[United Nations Angola Verification Mission I|United Nations Angola Verification Mission]] (UNAVEM) to verify the redeployment northwards and subsequent withdrawal of the Cuban forces from Angola.&lt;ref name=Hampson/&gt; UNAVEM included observers from Western as well as non-aligned and communist nations.&lt;ref name=Hampson/&gt; In February 1989 the [[United Nations Transition Assistance Group]] (UNTAG) was formed to monitor the South West African peace process.&lt;ref name=Hampson/&gt;

==Namibian independence==

The initial terms of the Geneva Protocol and Security Council Resolution 435 provided the foundation from which a political settlement in South West Africa could proceed: holding of elections for a constitutional assembly, confinement of both PLAN and the SADF to their respective bases, the subsequent phased withdrawal of all but 1,500 SADF troops, demobilisation of all paramilitary forces that belonged to neither the SADF nor to the police, and the return of refugees via designated entry points to participate in elections.&lt;ref name=Hampson/&gt; Responsibility for implementing these terms rested with UNTAG, which would assist in the SADF withdrawal, monitor the borders, and supervise the demobilisation of paramilitary units.&lt;ref name=Hampson/&gt;

[[File:1989 Entrance to the Australian base at Ondangwa.jpg|thumb|upright=1|UNTAG checkpoint at Ondangwa, June 1989.]]
Controversy soon arose over the size of UNTAG's military component, as the member states of the Security Council expected to cover the majority of the costs were irritated by its relatively large size.&lt;ref name=Hampson/&gt; However, Angola, Zambia, and other states sympathetic to PLAN insisted that a larger force was necessary to ensure that South Africa did not interfere with independence proceedings.&lt;ref name="Sitkowski"/&gt; Against their objections UNTAG's force levels were reduced from the proposed 7,500 to three battalions of 4,650 troops.&lt;ref name="Sitkowski"/&gt; This slashed projected expenses by nearly three hundred million dollars, but the Security Council did not approve the revised budget until 1 March 1989.&lt;ref name="Sitkowski"/&gt; The inevitable delay in UNTAG's full deployment ensured there were insufficient personnel prepared to monitor the movement of PLAN and the SADF or their confinement to bases on 1 April, when the permanent cessation in hostilities was to take effect.&lt;ref name=Peacebuilding&gt;{{cite book|last=Dzinesa|first=Gwinyayi|editor-last=Curtis|editor-first=Devon|title=Peacebuilding, Power, and Politics in Africa|year=2012|pages=277-279|publisher=Ohio University Press|location=Athens, Ohio|isbn=978-0821420133}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Secretary-General de Cuéllar urged restraint in the interim on both sides to avoid jeopardising the ''de facto'' ceasefire maintained since August 1988 or the 1 April implementation schedule.&lt;ref name=Hampson/&gt; Nevertheless, PLAN took advantage of the political uncertainty in the weeks following the UNTAG budget debate to begin moving its forces in Angola closer to the border.&lt;ref name="Stiff"&gt;{{cite book|title=Nine Days of War|last=Stiff|first=Peter|year=1989|publisher=Lemur Books (Pty) Ltd|isbn=978-0620142601|location=Alberton|pages=20, 89, 260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the early 1980s PLAN had consistently stated its intention to establish camps inside South West Africa during any future political transition, a notion rejected with equal consistency by the South African government.&lt;ref name="Refugeecrisis"&gt;{{cite book|last=Zolberg |first=Aristide|last2=Suhrke|first2=Astri|last3=Aguayo|first3=Sergio|title=Escape from Violence : Conflict and the Refugee Crisis in the Developing World|year=1989|pages=100–102|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0195363623}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compounding this fact was that PLAN insurgents also identified themselves as refugees without making any distinction between their civilian or military background, and the UN had explicitly invited refugees to return home.&lt;ref name=Sparks&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sparks|first1=Donald|last2=Green|first2=December|title=Namibia: The Nation After Independence|year=1992|pages=50, 129|publisher=[[Westview Press]]|location=Boulder, Colorado|isbn=978-0813310237}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, PLAN did not possess many regular standing units and by the late 1980s many of its personnel followed cyclical patterns of fighting as insurgents before returning to refugee camps as civilians.&lt;ref name=Demob&gt;{{cite book|last1=Colletta|first1=Nat|last2=Kostner|first2=Markus|last3=Wiederhofer|first3=Indo|title=Case Studies of War-To-Peace Transition: The Demobilization and Reintegration of Ex-Combatants in Ethiopia, Namibia, and Uganda|year=1996|pages=127–142|publisher=[[World Bank]]|location=Washington DC|isbn=978-0821336748}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 March, Pik Botha complained to the JMMC that PLAN troops had advanced south of the [[16th parallel south|16th parallel]] and were massing less than eight kilometres from the border.&lt;ref name="Sitkowski"/&gt; He promptly intercepted UN Special Representative [[Martti Ahtisaari]] and UNTAG commander [[Dewan Prem Chand]] that evening and gave them the same information.&lt;ref name="Sitkowski"/&gt; On the morning of 1 April, the first PLAN cadres crossed into Ovamboland, unhindered by UNTAG, which had failed to monitor their activity in Angola due to the delays in its deployment.&lt;ref name="Sitkowski"/&gt; Ahtisaari immediately contacted SWAPO, ordering it to rein in PLAN, to little avail.&lt;ref name="Sitkowski"/&gt; The South African foreign ministry also contacted the Secretary-General, who in turn relayed the same message to SWAPO officials in New York.&lt;ref name="Sitkowski"/&gt;

At the end of the day, with no signs of the PLAN advance abating, Ahtisaari lifted all restrictions confining the SADF to its bases.&lt;ref name="Sitkowski"/&gt; Local police mobilised and fought off the invaders in a delaying action until regular SADF forces were able to deploy with six battalions.&lt;ref name="Sitkowski"/&gt; After the first two days the insurgents lost their offensive initiative, and the combined South African forces drove PLAN back across the border in a counteroffensive codenamed [[Operation Merlyn]].&lt;ref name="Sitkowski"/&gt; Between 1 April – 9 April 273 PLAN insurgents were killed in the fighting.&lt;ref name=Sparks/&gt; The SADF and police suffered 23 dead.&lt;ref name=Sparks/&gt; On 8 April, the JMMC had issued the Mount Etjo Declaration, which reiterated that the Tripartite Accord was still in effect and that South Africa, Angola, and Cuba remained committed to peace.&lt;ref name=Hampson/&gt; It also ordered all PLAN insurgents remaining in Ovamboland to surrender at UNTAG-supervised assembly points.&lt;ref name=Hampson/&gt;

Sam Nujoma denied any incursion had taken place on 1 April, claiming that he had only ordered PLAN insurgents already inside South West Africa to begin establishing base camps.&lt;ref name="Clairborne"&gt;{{cite news|title=SWAPO Incursion into Namibia Seen as Major Blunder by Nujoma|last=Clairborne

[[Namibian parliamentary election, 1989|General elections]] under a [[universal franchise]] were held in South West Africa between 7 and 11 November 1989, returning 57% of the popular vote for SWAPO.&lt;ref name="NYT1989"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/15/world/namibia-rebel-group-wins-vote-but-it-falls-short-of-full-control.html|title=Namibia Rebel Group Wins Vote, But It Falls Short of Full Control|work=The New York Times|date=15 November 1989|accessdate=2014-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gave the party 41 seats in the territory's [[Members of the Constituent Assembly of Namibia|Constituent Assembly]], but not a two-thirds majority which would have enabled it to impose a unilateral constitution on the other parties represented.&lt;ref name="NYT1989"/&gt; South West Africa formally obtained independence as the [[Republic of Namibia]] on 21 March 1990.&lt;ref name=Sparks/&gt;

St. Joan's is a [[feminist]] [[Catholic]] organization, with a focus on [[women's equality]]. It is named after [[St. Joan of Arc]].&lt;ref name="Cook2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Chris Cook|title=The Routledge Guide to British Political Archives: Sources since 1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k89anpKEY6YC&amp;pg=PA378|date=2 October 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-50961-2|page=378}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization has played a major role in influencing the [[ordination of women]] and general [[human rights]].&lt;ref name=Pelzer/&gt; Their mission is "to secure the political, social and economic equality between men and women and to further the work and usefulness of Catholic women as citizens".&lt;ref name=Francis&gt;{{cite web|last=Francis|first=Rosemary|title=St Joan's International Alliance|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/people/750053?c=people|work=Biographies|publisher=National Library of Australia|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The organization was founded in [[London, England]] in 1911 as the "Catholic Women's [[Suffrage]] Society," with a focus on [[women's suffrage]]. St. Joan's was the first group in Catholicism to work for women priests.&lt;ref&gt;http://bridgetmarys.blogspot.com/2011/10/100th-anniversary-celebration-of-st.html&lt;/ref&gt; They started publishing a [[Magazine|journal]], ''The Catholic Citizen'', in 1915. As of 1923, the organization had members in 5 continents in 24 countries. That year it changed its name to "St. Joan's Social and Political Alliance." The organization presented a paper about "the Condition of Women," to the [[League of Nations]] in 1937. That paper is considered an influence on [[International matrimonial law]].&lt;ref name=Pelzer&gt;{{cite web|last=Pelzer|first=Anne Marie|title=St. Joan’s International Alliance: A Short History (1911-1977)|url=http://www.womenpriests.org/interact/pelzer.asp|publisher=The Journal of St. Joan’s International Alliance|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first chapter in [[Australia]] was founded in 1946, in [[New South Wales]]. Additional Australia chapters started in 1950 and the first Australian conference was held in 1951 in [[Sydney, Australia|Sydney]]. [[Enid Lyons]] was the [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria, Australia]] founding president.&lt;ref name=Francis/&gt; The first [[Germany|German]] chapter was founded in 1950, starting in [[West Germany]] with approximately 50 members.&lt;ref name=TWL1&gt;{{cite web|title=Records of the St Joan's International Alliance (German Section)|url=http://archiveshub.ac.uk/data/gb106-5sjg|publisher=The Women's Library|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, the organization was placed on [[consultative status]] with the [[United Nations]], triggered by the organizations involvement in a discussion with the United Nations about [[female castration]]. The organization also became involved in anti-[[slavery]] and anti-[[human trafficking]] causes.&lt;ref name=Pelzer/&gt; At that time, the [[United Kingdom]] founding chapter was known as the Great Britain and Northern Ireland Section of the St Joan's International Alliance.&lt;ref name=Francis/&gt;

In 1977, ''The Catholic Citizen'' was published in [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]]. They also publish materials in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. Since 1967, the organization has issued resolutions following women and human rights focused declarations by the [[Holy See|Vatican]]. St. Joan's also influenced the [[Roman Catholicism in Canada|Catholic community in Canada]] to approve of the [[ordination of women]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=Pelzer/&gt; Collections and archives related to the organization are held in the [[Women's Library]].&lt;ref name="Cook2012"/&gt;

==Notable members==

Notable members included Alaskan lawyer and politician [[Dorothy Awes Haaland]], who served as president of the Alaskan chapter.&lt;ref name=DSS1&gt;{{cite web|title=Delegate Dorothy Haaland Dies|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/17243788/|publisher=Daily Sitka Sentinel|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anna Maria Dengel]], [[Mary Daly]], and [[Ida Raming]] were also a members.&lt;ref name=Pelzer/&gt;

It is an example of [[Reactance (psychology)|psychological reactance]], wherein once people are aware that some information is being kept from them, their motivation to access and spread it is increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Burnett |first1 = Dean |title = Why government censorship [in no way at all] carries greater risks than benefits |url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2015/may/22/government-censorship-psychology-theresa-may |accessdate = April 16, 2016 |work = The Guardian |location = London |date = May 22, 2015 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160424061616/https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2015/may/22/government-censorship-psychology-theresa-may |archivedate = April 24, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is named after American entertainer [[Barbra Streisand]], whose 2003 attempt to suppress photographs of her residence in [[Malibu, California]] inadvertently drew further public attention to it. Similar attempts have been made, for example, in [[cease and desist|cease-and-desist letters]] to suppress files, websites, and even [[illegal number|numbers]]. Instead of being suppressed, the information receives extensive publicity and media extensions such as videos and spoof songs, often being widely [[Mirror website|mirrored]] on the Internet or distributed on [[File sharing|file-sharing networks]].&lt;ref name=London&gt;{{Cite journal |last = Canton |first = David |url = http://www.lfpress.ca/cgi-bin/publish.cgi?p=111404&amp;x=articles&amp;s=shopping |archive-url = https://archive.is/20070927014240/http://www.lfpress.ca/cgi-bin/publish.cgi?p=111404&amp;x=articles&amp;s=shopping |dead-url = yes |archive-date = September 27, 2007 |title = Today's Business Law: Attempt to suppress can backfire |journal = [[London Free Press]] |date = November 5, 2005 |accessdate = July 21, 2007 |quote = The 'Streisand effect' is what happens when someone tries to suppress something and the opposite occurs.

On December 5, 2008, the [[Internet Watch Foundation]] (IWF) [[Internet Watch Foundation and Wikipedia|added]] the [[English Wikipedia]] article about the 1976 [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]] album ''[[Virgin Killer]]'' to a child pornography blacklist, considering the album's cover art "a potentially illegal indecent image of a child under the age of 18".&lt;ref name="guardian_streisand"&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/mar/20/streisand-effect-internet-law |work = The Guardian |location = London |title = The Streisand effect: Secrecy in the digital age |first = Charles |last = Arthur |date = March 20, 2009 |accessdate = March 31, 2010 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130906071208/http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/mar/20/streisand-effect-internet-law |archivedate = September 6, 2013 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The article quickly became one of the most popular pages on the site,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/12/07/brit_isps_censor_wikipedia/ |title = Brit ISPs censor Wikipedia over 'child porn' album cover |date = December 7, 2008 |accessdate = December 9, 2008 |first = Cade |last = Metz |work = The Register |deadurl = no |archiveurl = http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110608133030/https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/12/07/brit_isps_censor_wikipedia/ |archivedate = June 8, 2011 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the publicity surrounding the IWF action resulted in the image being spread across other sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/technology/web/wikipedia-added-to-child-pornography-blacklist/2008/12/08/1228584723764.html |title = Wikipedia added to child pornography blacklist |last = Moses |first = Asher |date = December 8, 2008 |work = Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate = December 9, 2008 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/6AkVTPrae?url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/technology/web/wikipedia-added-to-child-pornography-blacklist/2008/12/08/1228584723764.html |archivedate = September 17, 2012 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The IWF was later reported on the [[BBC News]] website to have said "IWF's overriding objective is to minimise the availability of indecent images of children on the internet, however, on this occasion our efforts have had the opposite effect".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7774102.stm |title = IWF backs down on Wiki censorship |date = December 9, 2008 |accessdate = December 9, 2008 |publisher = BBC News Online |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081211033923/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7774102.stm |archivedate = December 11, 2008 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect was also noted by the IWF in its statement about the removal of the URL from the blacklist.&lt;ref name=living&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/12/26/opinion/edmorozov.php |title = Living with the Streisand Effect |accessdate = December 29, 2008 |date = December 26, 2008 |work = International Herald Tribune |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090114100047/http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/12/26/opinion/edmorozov.php |archivedate = January 14, 2009 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url = http://www.iwf.org.uk/about-iwf/news/post/251-iwf-statement-regarding-wikipedia-webpage |title = IWF statement regarding Wikipedia webpage |date = December 9, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110101075354/http://www.iwf.org.uk/about-iwf/news/post/251-iwf-statement-regarding-wikipedia-webpage |archivedate = January 1, 2011 |accessdate = September 24, 2013 |publisher = Internet Watch Foundation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, [[Argyll and Bute Council]] banned a nine-year-old primary school pupil from updating her blog, [[NeverSeconds]], with photos of lunchtime meals served in the school's canteen. The blog, which was already popular, started receiving a large number of views due to the international media furor that followed the ban. Within days, the council reversed its decision under immense public pressure and scrutiny. After the reversal of the ban, the blog became more popular than it was before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18458567 |title = The Streisand Effect: When censorship backfires |publisher = BBC News |first = Mario |last = Cacciottolo |date = June 15, 2012 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160311190819/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18458567 |archivedate = March 11, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, it was revealed that officials at the [[University of California, Davis]], including Chancellor [[Linda P.B. Katehi]], paid consultants at least $175,000 to scrub the internet of stories about Katehi and the administration's involvement in the 2011 [[UC Davis pepper-spray incident]]. News of the payments brought the event back into the news, adding to negative press in the wake of revelation about Katehi's involvement on outside boards. On April 27, 2016, [[University of California]] President [[Janet Napolitano]] removed Katehi from her post and placed her on paid [[administrative leave]] pending an investigation into possible violations of university policies.&lt;ref name="NYT 28 April 2016"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/29/us/uc-davis-chancellor-accused-of-violations-is-removed-from-post.html |title = U.C.

{{further|Super-injunctions in English law}}
In May 2011, [[Premier League]] footballer [[Ryan Giggs]] sued [[Twitter]] after a user revealed that Giggs was the subject of an anonymous [[Gag order|privacy injunction]] (informally referred to as a "super-injunction"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.theguardian.com/law/2011/may/20/lord-neuberger-report-superinjunction-hysteria |title = Lord Neuberger's report cuts through the superinjunction hysteria |last = Townend |first = Judith |newspaper = The Guardian |location = London |date = May 20, 2011 |accessdate = May 21, 2011 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131222093235/http://www.theguardian.com/law/2011/may/20/lord-neuberger-report-superinjunction-hysteria |archivedate = December 22, 2013 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;) that prevented the publication of details regarding an alleged affair with model and former ''[[Big Brother (UK)|Big Brother]]'' contestant [[Imogen Thomas]].

A '''referendum''' was held in [[Switzerland]] on 13 February 2011 on the [[federal popular initiative]] "For the protection against gun violence". It was rejected by 56% of voters and a majority of cantons.

==Initiative==
The initiative foresees that guns can no longer be kept at home, but must be stored at the arsenal (''Zeughaus'') instead, that possession of a gun should be linked to a screening of the ability and necessity of the gunholder, and that all guns should be registered. Left-wing parties (SP, Greens, CSP) and the GLP are mostly in favour of the proposal, with right-wing parties (SVP, FDP, CVP, BDP) opposed.

==Opinion polls==
According to polls from January 2011, the initiative was favoured by 45% of respondents, with 34% opposed and a relatively high amount of undecideds at 21%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzz.ch/nachrichten/politik/schweiz/befuerworter_der_waffeninitiative_liegen_klar_vorn_1.9033380.html Befürworter der Waffeninitiative liegen klar vorn] Neue Zürcher Zeitung, 9 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; A second poll from two weeks before the referendum saw a closening of the polls, with 47% to 45% in favour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzz.ch/nachrichten/politik/international/gegner_der_waffenschutzinitiative_holen_auf_1.9327132.html Gegner der Waffenschutzinitiative holen auf] Neue Zürcher Zeitung, 2 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
More than half, 56.3%, of all voters were against the initiative, with only the cantons of [[Basel-Stadt]], [[Canton of Zurich|Zurich]], [[Canton of Geneva|Geneva]], [[Canton of Jura|Jura]], [[Vaud]] and [[Canton of Neuchâtel|Neuchâtel]] in support; this meant the initiative would have narrowly passed in western Switzerland, but clearly failed in the German-speaking parts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzz.ch/nachrichten/politik/international/volk_und_staende_entscheiden_ueber_die_waffenschutzinitiative_1.9499914.html Waffenschutzinitiative klar gescheitert] Neue Zürcher Zeitung, 13 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In Switzerland, the passing of a constitutional amendment by initiative requires a double majority; not only must a majority of people vote for the amendment but also a majority of cantons give their consent.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4446">'''''The Third Choice: Islam, Dhimmitude and Freedom''''' is written by [[Mark Durie]], with a Foreword by [[Bat Ye'or]]. It deals with the status of non-[[Muslim]] populations (the [[dhimmis]]) after the conquest of their lands by Muslims.

''The Third Choice'' was short-listed for Australian Christian Book of the Year, 2010.

Mervyn Bendle, writing in the ''News Weekly'', reports that ''The Third Choice'' 'provides essential information about the basic beliefs and practices of Islam, the life and role of Muhammad, the relevant history of Islam, the origins and history of the doctrine of the [[dhimma]], how [[dhimmitude]]  operates in the
everyday life of non-Muslims in Muslim societies, its resurgence in contemporary times, and possible ways through which Christians and other non-Muslims may seek to overcome it and heal the damage that it has done...'

==Quote from the author==
The author claims that: "One of the most profound and least-understood manifestations of
rejection in human history is the Islamic institution of the dhimma,
the theologically-driven political, social, and legal system, imposed by
Islamic law upon non-Muslims as an alternative to Islam (i.e. conversion)
or the sword (i.e. death or captivity). The ''dhimma'' is the ‘third choice’
offered to non-Muslims under jihad conditions, and those who have
accepted it are known as ''dhimmis''. Their condition, ''dhimmitude'', forms
the subject of this book, which describes the challenge posed by Islam’s
treatment of non-Muslims, exposes the spiritual roots of this challenge,
and offers a solution..."&lt;ref&gt;p.ix&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commentary and criticism==
According to the book review by Mervyn Bendle(PHD) from  James Cook University, Queensland, Durie contends that instead of a "hardening of resolve", Western attitudes in the aftermath of the [[9/11 attacks]] consisted of "widespread capitulation to Muslim demands" to the detriment of public policy, human rights, and free speech. Among other things, Durie cites various statements praising Islam by politicians such as [[Barack Obama]], [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] and [[Mary Robinson]]; statements by Western politicians in support of [[Sharia]] law; and other statements of "humility" by Christian leaders as evidence of "dhimmitude".&lt;ref name="Bendle"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Book Review: The Third Choice: Islam, Dhimmitude and Freedom, by Mark Durie|first=Mervyn|last=Bendle|date=2012-02-20|publisher=[[News Weekly]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adam A.J. DeVille from University of St. Francis describes the book as mix of scholarly and high journalism work.  He says that although the book contains some flaws it would be unjust to dismiss it as most of it will be accepted in the court of law as proof of Islam intolerance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Third Choice: Islam, Dhimmitude and Freedom – Mark Durie | author=Adam A.J.

'''Utopia''' is an [[Unincorporated area|unincorporated community]] in far southern [[Franklin Township, Clermont County, Ohio|Franklin Township]], [[Clermont County, Ohio|Clermont County]], [[Ohio]], [[United States]], along the banks of the [[Ohio River]].  Utopia has been referred to as a "[[ghost town]]" although there are still people who live there.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Geography ==
Utopia is located on the northern bank of the Ohio River in the southeast corner of Clermont County, in southwest Ohio.{{coord|38|46|34|N|84|03|26|W|type:city_region:US-OH|display=title}}  It lies along [[U.S. Route 52]].

== First settlement ==
Utopia was founded in 1844 by the followers of [[Charles Fourier]], after the failure of an earlier Fourierist [[phalanstère]] called the [[Clermont Phalanx]].  Fourier's writings inspired his readers to create their own [[Utopianism|utopian society]] — hence the name "[[Utopia]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Everts|first=Louis H.|title=History of Clermont County, Ohio, with Illustrations and Biographical Sketches of Its Prominent Men and Pioneers|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=yale.39002054234126;view=1up;seq=402|year=1880|publisher=J.B. Lippincott &amp; Co.|location=Philadelphia|page=344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within three years, the community broke up.  It was soon reorganized by [[Josiah Warren]], who founded the town as a means of a small cooperative community that could still carry out functions like the outside world. For instance, the town existed with a [[market economy]] and the belief in owning [[private property]].&lt;ref&gt;Bailie, William. ''[http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/bright/warren/bailie.html Josiah Warren]'', 1906.  Accessed 2007-10-12 from the [[Pitzer College]] website's [[Anarchy Archives]], created 2000-02-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First settlers ===
The sect believed that the world would enter a 35,000-year-long period of peace, and that in order to achieve [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]], they must live in [[Commune (intentional community)|communes]] with one another. Fourier's followers had attracted several families to live in Utopia for the fee of $25 a year, and in turn each family would receive a wooden house on a small parcel of land.&lt;ref name="forgottenoh"&gt;[http://www.forgottenoh.com/Utopia/utopia.html Utopia, Ohio] Forgotten Ohio&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second settlers ===
The land that was owned by the sect was then sold to [[John O. Wattles]], the leader of another group of [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|Spiritualists]].  Despite the warnings of the locals, Wattles and the Spiritualists moved the dining hall/town hall brick by brick to the river's edge.  The move was completed in December 1847 mere days before one of the biggest floods of the 19th century.

=== Flood of 1847 ===
On the night of December 13, the [[Ohio River]] had flooded its banks dramatically and was getting dangerously close to the town hall.  However, people were still seeking shelter in the hall because their houses were becoming flooded.  During a party that was being held at the hall that evening, the river, many feet above flood stage, washed out the south wall of the building, sweeping out a large number of Spiritualists.  Some who were swept away did survive, but most drowned or were overcome by hypothermia in the icy river.

== Second settlement ==
The settlement was reorganized in 1847 as an [[Individualist anarchism|individualist anarchist]] colony by [[Josiah Warren]] and associates. Personal invitation from the first settlers was required for admission to the community, with Warren reasoning that the most valuable individual [[liberty]] was “the liberty to choose our associates at all times.” Land was not owned communally, but individually, with lots being bought and sold at cost, as required by contractual arrangement. The economy of the community was a system based upon [[private property]] and a [[market economy]] where labor was the basis of exchange value (see ''[[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]]''). Goods and services were traded by the medium of [[labor notes (currency)|labor notes]]. By the mid-1850s, the community eventually came to contain approximately forty buildings&amp;nbsp;— about half of which were of an industrial nature. Also present were two [[Cincinnati Time Store|time stores]].

The impact of the Civil War, the rising prices of surrounding land that made expansion difficult, and the requirement of being invited by the original settlers are said to have led to the eventual dissolution of the project. However, as late as 1875, several of the original occupants remained, and some business in the area was still being conducted by labor notes. By that time, the area had come to be known as Smith’s Landing.

Warren left Utopia a year after its inception to lecture and assist in setting up other colonies. The most significant of these was [[Socialist Community of Modern Times|Modern Times]]. However, he did return to visit occasionally. After his last visit in the winter of 1855-1856, he remarked:
&lt;blockquote&gt;My visit to that little germ of Equitable society, now eight and a half years old, has given me higher hopes and expectations than I had before dared to entertain. It is not the display that the little group of buildings makes to the eye… but knowing the means by which these… have been acquired, and seeing that there the subject of Equity has had eight years and six months deep study and practical trial, and that from the beginning… the subject had lost nothing with those who first took hold of it… but had gained… from year to year in their highest judgement and affectionate regard.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Victims of Communism Memorial''' is a [[memorial]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] located at the intersection of [[Massachusetts Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Massachusetts]] and New Jersey Avenues and G Street, [[Northwest, Washington, D.C.|NW]], two blocks from [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)|Union Station]] and within view of the [[United States Capitol|U.S. Capitol]].&lt;ref name="Memorials"&gt;{{cite web| title=Victims of Communism Memorial in Washington, D.C.| date=24 July 2011| publisher=dcMemorials.com| url=http://dcmemorials.com/index_indiv0000002.htm| accessdate=2011-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The memorial is dedicated "to the more than one hundred million victims of communism".

==Background==
A bill, H.R. 3000, sponsored by [[United States House of Representatives|Representatives]] [[Dana Rohrabacher]] and [[Tom Lantos]] and [[United States Senate|Senators]] [[Claiborne Pell]] and [[Jesse Helms]], to authorize the memorial passed unanimously on December 17, 1993 and was signed into law by President [[Bill Clinton]], becoming Public Law 103-199 Section 905. Because of delays in establishing the memorial, the authorization was subsequently extended through Section 326 of Public Law 105-277, approved October 21, 1998, until December 17, 2007. The Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation has the duty of funding and directing the first stages of planning the memorial.

In November 2005, the [[National Capital Planning Commission]] gave approval to the monument's design. After raising over [[United States dollar|US$]]825,000 for construction and maintenance costs, the groundbreaking ceremony was held September 27, 2006.&lt;ref name="memorial"&gt;{{cite web| title=Victims of Communism Memorial| url=http://www.globalmuseumoncommunism.org/content/victims-communism-memorial| date=| publisher=Global Museum on Communism| accessdate=2011-07-26| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009011200/http://www.globalmuseumoncommunism.org/content/victims-communism-memorial| archive-date=2011-10-09| dead-url=yes| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dedication ceremony==
[[File:President Bush dedicates the Victims of Communism Memorial.jpg|upright=1.3|thumb|U.S. President Bush dedicates the Victims of Communism Memorial]]
On June 12, 2007, the memorial was officially dedicated. Among the hundreds of invited guests were people from many countries who suffered hardships under [[Communist state|Communist regimes]], such as [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] poet [[Nguyen Chi Thien]], [[Chinese people|Chinese]] [[political prisoner]] [[Harry Wu]], [[Lithuania]]n [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] journalist [[Nijolė Sadūnaitė]] and others.&lt;ref name="Monika"&gt;{{cite web| author=Monika Bončkutė| url=http://www.lrytas.lt/?data=20070614&amp;id=11817208641180235078&amp;view=4| title=Monumento komunizmo aukoms atidarymo iškilmėse-ir kovotojai už Lietuvos laisvę| date=14 June 2007| publisher=Lyrtas.com News| accessdate=2011-07-26}}(In Lithuanian)&lt;/ref&gt; During the opening ceremony, President George W. Bush named some of those who suffered from Communism in anonymity:

&lt;blockquote&gt;They include innocent Ukrainians starved to death in Stalin's Great Famine; or Russians killed in Stalin's purges; Lithuanians and Latvians and Estonians loaded onto cattle cars and deported to Arctic death camps of Soviet Communism. They include Chinese killed in the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution; Cambodians slain in Pol Pot's Killing Fields; East Germans shot attempting to scale the Berlin Wall in order to make it to freedom; Poles massacred in the Katyn Forest; and Ethiopians slaughtered in the "Red Terror"; Miskito Indians murdered by Nicaragua's Sandinista dictatorship; and Cuban balseros who drowned escaping tyranny.&lt;ref name=Bush/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

President Bush also said, "We'll never know the names of all who perished, but at this sacred place, communism's unknown victims will be consecrated to history and remembered forever. We dedicate this memorial because we have an obligation to those who died, to acknowledge their lives and honor their memory."&lt;ref name="RFE"&gt;{{cite news| title=U.S.: Bush Dedicates Memorial To Victims Of Communism| url=http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2007/06/89ea315d-2c46-4c40-a890-ae59f312b6d1.html| author=Heather Maher| publisher=Radio Free Europe| date=13 June 2007| accessdate=2011-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bush equated communism to the threat of [[terrorism]] then facing the U.S.: "Like the Communists, the terrorists and radicals who have attacked our nation are followers of a murderous ideology that despises freedom, crushes all dissent, has [[expansionist]] ambitions and pursues [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] aims."&lt;ref name="Post"&gt;{{cite news |work=The Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/12/AR2007061201125.html |title=The Toll of Communism |first=Omar |last=Fekeiki |page=C01 | date=June 13, 2007 | accessdate=May 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' reported the statue drew criticism from the [[China|Chinese]] embassy because the memorial evokes the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square protests]]. The embassy called its construction an "attempt to defame China."  The chairman of the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, Lee Edwards, said he was not aware of any official complaint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New DC memorial dedicated to communism's victims|work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |first=Leora |last=Falk |date=June 12, 2007|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-070612monuments,1,2433167.story?coll=chi-newsnationworld-hed}}{{Dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to criticism of China at the dedication ceremony, a [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China|Chinese foreign ministry]] speaker accused the US of pushing a "Cold War" thought and meddling in China's internal affairs, and issued a formal protest.&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{cite news| title=China blasts Bush tribute to victims of communism| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2007/06/14/us-china-usa-communism-idUSPEK20924820070614| date=13 June 2007| publisher=Reuters| accessdate=2011-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Professor Andrei P. Tsygankov of [[San Francisco State University]] identifies the building of the statue as an expression of the anti-Russia lobby in Washington. He identifies it as a revival of Cold War symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;Andrei P. Tsygankov. Russophobia: anti-Russian lobby and American foreign policy. Macmillan, 2009. p.55&lt;/ref&gt;
  	
According to Professor Shi Yinhong of the Center of American Studies at the [[People's University of China]], the monument was inappropriate: "In the history of socialist countries such as China and the Soviet Union, there were many dramatic events. In the capitalist countries, many bad things have also happened, but we do not erect monuments to the victims of capitalism." &lt;ref name="vesti7.ru"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vesti7.ru/news?id=10827|title=Вести Недели : США диктуют условия|work=vesti7.ru|accessdate=17 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150417194613/http://vesti7.ru/news?id=10827|archive-date=17 April 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  	
A week after the unveiling of the monument and the speeches during the event, [[President of Russia|Russian President]] [[Vladimir Putin]] responded "We have not used nuclear weapons against a civilian population. We have not sprayed thousands of kilometers with chemicals, or dropped on a small country seven times more bombs than in all the Great Patriotic War."&lt;ref name="vesti7.ru"/&gt;
  	
In China, the PRC Foreign Ministry lodged stern representations at the United States in response to the inauguration of the statue. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said that "there are political forces in the United States that still think in 'cold war' terms and seek to provoke conflicts between different ideologies and social systems." He added that there should be an end by the U.S. of "interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, do more to promote dialogue and cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-06/13/content_6238612.htm|title=Xinhua - English|work=xinhuanet.com|accessdate=17 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419163414/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-06/13/content_6238612.htm|archive-date=19 April 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Russian politician and legislator [[Gennady Zyuganov]], leader of the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]] said that U.S. President Bush's appearance before the unveiling of the monument was a "clumsy propaganda attempt to divert the world public opinion's attention from the true, bloody crimes of U.S. imperialism in general and the current administration in the White House in particular." Zyuganov also added that the monument was inappropriate: "How can an American president open it given the blood of civilians in Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia, Serbs in Kosovo, Guantanamo Bay, as well as CIA prisons in Eastern Europe are part of the black list of crimes of the globalists." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsru.com/russia/13jun2007/zyuganov.html|title=Новости NEWSru.com :: Зюганов назвал Буша символом государственного терроризма|work=newsru.com|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ukraine, there was a response to open a museum for U.S. [[imperialism]] in [[Simferopol]]. [[Communist Party of Ukraine|Communist Party]] leader Leonid Grach stated, "[It] Is our response to George Bush, who opened the Victims of Communism Memorial in Washington, and to [pro-Western Ukrainian President] Viktor Yushchenko, who initiated the construction of the Museum of Soviet occupation in Kiev." The museum focused on the repression of Native Americans, slavery, and racism. The museum also highlights interventions in foreign countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/world/20070821/73004087.html|title=Ukraine's Communists open museum for U.S. imperialism victims|author=Sputnik|date=21 August 2007|work=rian.ru|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
