'''Akan art''' is an [[art]] form that originated among the [[Akan people]] of [[West Africa]]. Akan art is known for vibrant artistic traditions, including textiles, sculpture, [[Akan goldweights]], as well as gold and silver [[jewelry]]. The Akan people are known for their strong connection between visual and verbal expressions and a distinctive blending of art and philosophy. Akan culture values [[gold]] above all other metals, so the artwork and jewelry made of gold reflects a great deal of value, whether it be made for appearance, artistic expression, or more practical trading purposes.

==Goldweights==
{{main|Akan goldweights}}
One of the most popular pieces of Akan art are the [[Akan goldweights]]. The gold weights were made of [[copper]], [[bronze]], and [[brass]]. They were cast using a method of casting known as lost-wax technique or "cire perdue". Goldweights were created  for economic transactions involving gold. Although it is not clear when the convention of weights were first introduced, scholars suggest that the Akan first traded gold with Muslim merchants from the West African interior, long before European contact. Their weight system correspond to the Islamic weight system of North Africa, and appear to be part of early sub-Saharan trade. 

The gold weights served a vast amount of roles in their culture and everyday life. Akan goldweights are used as [[counterbalance]]s on the scales used in gold trade, visual representations of oral tradition, representations of proverbs, as pictographic script in social and political system, and in the knowledge system of the Akan people. Goldweights were used in everyday trade and commerce, as well as in accounting, as a type of fraction or counter. According to the Akan scholar Nitecki, Akan gold weights were "created and used like spoken language to commemorate social or historical events or entities, to express philosophical or religious views, aspirations, and dreams, or simply to ask questions, or to express displeasure". The Akan pyramids were concrete testimonials to how the artist felt about themselves and major life events and dilemmas such as marriage, children, injustice, and personal and statewide conflicts.

There are four major categories of gold weights, based on what was depicted. The first kind of gold weights depict people. The second consist of the local flora and fauna. The third category are likened to man-made objects. The final category are abstract and open for interpretation by individual. 

==Jewelry==
Akan cultural jewelry has a variety of forms. The Akan people make neck-wear, wrist bands, elbow-wear, knee-wear, and ankle-wear. Gender-specific jewelry includes hat pins and headbands for men and earrings and hairpins for the women.

[[File:Statues of Hindu Deities at Lord Shiva Temple in Kanipakam 07.jpg|thumb|A statue of a cow at the Lord Shiva Temple in Kanipakam]]
'''Animal worship''' (or '''zoolatry''') refers to rituals involving animals, such as the glorification of '''animal deities''' or [[animal sacrifice]]. When a god is respected or worshipped by means of a representative animal, an animal cult is formed ([[#Reference-idTeeter2002|Teeter et al., 2002]], p.&amp;nbsp;355). Animal cults may be classified according to their outward form or according to their inward meaning, which may of course undergo transformations ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;51).

The classical author Diodorus explained the origin of animal worship by recalling the myth in which the gods, supposedly threatened by giants, hid under the guise of animals. The people then naturally began to worship the animals that their gods had disguised themselves as and continued this act even after the gods returned to their normal state ([[#Reference-idLubbock2005|Lubbock, 2005]], p.&amp;nbsp;252). In 1906, Weissenborn suggested that animal worship resulted from man's natural curiosity. Primitive man would observe an animal that had a unique trait and the inexplicability of this trait would appeal to man's curiosity ([[#Reference-idWeissenborn1906b|Weissenborn, 1906b]], p.&amp;nbsp;282). Wonder resulted from primitive man's observations of this distinctive trait and this wonder eventually induced adoration. Thus, primitive man worshipped animals that had inimitable traits ([[#Reference-idWeissenborn1906b|Weissenborn, 1906b]], p.&amp;nbsp;282). Lubbock put forward a more recent view. Lubbock proposed that animal-worship originated from family names. In societies, families would name themselves and their children after certain animals and eventually came to hold that animal above other animals. Eventually, these opinions turned into deep respect and evolved into fully developed worship of the family animal ([[#Reference-idLubbock2005|Lubbock, 2005]], p.&amp;nbsp;253). The belief that an animal is sacred frequently results in [[Taboo food and drink|dietary laws]] prohibiting their consumption. As well as holding certain animals to be sacred, religions have also adopted the opposite attitude, that certain animals are [[unclean animals|unclean]].

The idea that divinity embodies itself in animals, such as a deity incarnate, and then lives on earth among human beings is disregarded by [[Abrahamic]] religions ([[#Reference-idMorris2000|Morris, 2000]], p.&amp;nbsp;26). In [[Independent Assemblies of God]] and [[Pentecostal]] churches, animals have very little religious significance ([[#Reference-idMorris2000|Schoffeleers, 1985; Peltzer, 1987; Qtd. in Morris, 2000]], p.&amp;nbsp;25). Animals have become less and less important and symbolic in cult rituals and religion, especially among African cultures, as Christianity and Islamic religions have spread. ([[#Reference-idMorris2000|Morris, 2000]], p.&amp;nbsp;24).

The [[Egyptian pantheon]] was especially fond of [[zoomorphism]], with many animals sacred to particular deities—[[cat]]s to [[Bastet (mythology)|Bastet]], [[ibis]]es and [[baboon]]s to [[Thoth]], [[crocodile]]s to [[Sobek]] and [[Ra]], fish to [[Set (mythology)|Set]], [[mongoose]], [[shrew]] and [[bird]]s to [[Horus]], dogs and [[jackal]]s to [[Anubis]], serpents and [[eel]]s to [[Atum]], [[beetle]]s to [[Khepera]], bulls to [[Apis (Egyptian mythology)|Apis]]. Animals were often [[Animal Mummies|mummified]] as a result of these beliefs.

==Hunting cults==

===Bear===
{{Main|Bear worship}}
There is evidence that connects the Greek goddess [[Artemis]] with a cult of the bear. Girls danced as "bears" in her honour, and might not marry before undergoing this ceremony ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;51). According to mythology, the goddess once transformed a [[nymph]] into a bear and then into the constellation [[Ursa Major]].

The existence of an ancient bear cult among Neanderthals in the Middle Paleolithic period has been a topic of discussion spurred by archaeological findings ([[#Reference-idWunn2000|Wunn, 2000]], p.&amp;nbsp;434-435). Ancient bear bones have been discovered in several different caves and their peculiar arrangement are believed by some archaeologists to be evidence of a bear cult during the Paleolithic era. ([[#Reference-idWunn2000|Wunn, 2000]], p.&amp;nbsp;435). However, others argue that the placement of these remains, whether it appears to be an identified pattern or not, is due to natural causes such as wind, sediment, or water ([[#Reference-idWunn2000|Wunn, 2000]], p.&amp;nbsp;437-438).

[[Image:AinuBearSacrificeCirca1870.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Ainu people|Ainu]] ''[[Iomante]]'' ceremony (bear sending). Japanese scroll painting, circa 1870.]]
The [[Ainu people]], who live on select islands in the Japanese archipelago, call the bear "[[kamui]]" in [[Ainu language|their language]], which translates to mean god. While many other animals are considered to be gods in the Ainu culture, the bear is the head of the gods ([[#Reference-idKindaichi1949|Kindaichi, 1949]], p.&amp;nbsp;345). For the Ainu, when the gods visit the world of man, they don fur and claws and take on the physical appearance of an animal. Usually, however, when the term "kamui" is used, it essentially means a bear ([[#Reference-idKindaichi1949|Kindaichi, 1949]], p.&amp;nbsp;345). The Ainu people willingly and thankfully ate the bear as they believed that the disguise (the flesh and fur) of any god was a gift to the home that the god chose to visit ([[#Reference-idKindaichi1949|Kindaichi, 1949]], p.&amp;nbsp;348).

===Whale===
[[Image:Bộ cốt cá voi.jpg|right|thumb|The largest whale skeleton in Vietnam at [[:vi:Vạn Thủy Tú|Vạn Thủy Tú temple]], one of [[:vi:Tục thờ cá Ông|Vietnamese Whale worship]] in [[Vietnamese folk religion]]s]]

Whales were little understood for most of human history as they spend up to 90% of their lives underwater, only surfacing briefly to breathe ([[#Reference-idBird2007|Bird 2007]]). Many cultures, even those that have hunted them, hold whales in awe and feature them in their mythologies.

A prevalent [[whale]] cult in Japan occurs around the coastal area. There are cemeteries with memorial stones dedicated to the whales which were hunted and killed to feed the people ([[#Reference-idNaumann1974|Naumann, 1974]], p.&amp;nbsp;4).
Buddhist epitaphs mark these stones which implore that Buddha be reborn as a whale ([[#Reference-idNaumann1974|Naumann, 1974]], p.&amp;nbsp;4). Along with these memorials, there is evidence that whale embryos, found in a deceased mother's womb, were extracted and buried with the same respect as a human being ([[#Reference-idNaumann1974|Naumann, 1974]], p.&amp;nbsp;5). For certain shrines, the bones of a perished whale were also deposited in the area ([[#Reference-idNaumann1974|Naumann, 1974]], p.&amp;nbsp;5).

In Alaska, there are cultures that have ceremonial tributes whales after they are captured in a hunt ([[#Reference-idLantis1938|Lantis 1938]], p.&amp;nbsp;445). Some tribes bring the hump, the fins, or the nose of the whale into their camps or the whaler's house. These parts are meant to represent the entirety of the whale and are honored as such during the festival ([[#Reference-idLantis1938|Lantis 1938]], p.&amp;nbsp;445). The bones of a whale are also given ritual treatment. The Alaskan tribes that participate in such acts believe that their ceremonies protect the whale's soul from injury and the soul can then be free to return to the sea ([[#Reference-idLantis1938|Lantis 1938]], p.&amp;nbsp;445).

In China, ''Yu-kiang'', a whale with the hands and feet of a man was said to rule the ocean ([[#Reference-idSiebert2011|Siebert 2011]], pp.&amp;nbsp;15–16).

In the [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] region of Austria, it was said that if a sunbeam were to fall on a maiden entering womanhood, she would be carried away in the belly of a whale ([[#Reference-idFrazer1913|Frazer 1913]], p.&amp;nbsp;72).

[[Paikea]] (also maori name for [[humpback whale]]s&lt;ref name=Teara&gt;http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/te-whanau-puha-whales&lt;/ref&gt;), the youngest and favourite son of the chief Uenuku from the island of [[Mangaia]], in the present day [[Cook Islands]], was said by the Kati Kuri people of [[Kaikoura]] to have come from the Pacific Islands on the back of ''Tohora'' (maori name for [[southern right whale]]s&lt;ref name=Teara /&gt;) a whale many centuries before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/exhibitions/whales/EducationResource.aspx?irn=198|title=Whales|last=Anon|work=Tinirau education resource|accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The whale features in [[Inuit]] [[creation myth]]s. When 'Big Raven', a deity in human form, found a stranded whale, he was told by the [[Great Spirit]] where to find special mushrooms that would give him the strength to drag the whale back to the sea and thus return order to the world ([[#Reference-idSiebert2011|Siebert 2011]], pp.&amp;nbsp;15–16).

The [[Tlingit]] people of northern Canada say that the orcas were created when the hunter Natsihlane carved eight fish from yellow cedar, sang his most powerful spirit song and commanded the fish to leap into the water ([[#Reference-idHeimlichBoran2001|Heimlich &amp; Boran 2001]], p.&amp;nbsp;7).

In Icelandic legend a man threw a stone at a [[fin whale]] and hit the blowhole, causing the whale to burst. The man was told not to go to sea for twenty years, but in the nineteenth year he went fishing and a whale came and killed him.&lt;ref name="worldtrans"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldtrans.org/creators/whale/myths0.html|title=Whale Mythology from around the World|last=Anon|work=The Creative Continuum|publisher=worldtrans.org|accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In East African legend, King Sulemani asked God that he might permit him to feed all the beings on earth. A whale came and ate until there was no corn left and then told Sulemani that he was still hungry and that there were 70,000 more in his tribe. Sulemani then prayed to God for forgiveness and thanked the creature for teaching him a lesson in humility ([[#Reference-idSiebert2011|Siebert 2011]], pp.&amp;nbsp;15–16).

Some cultures that associate [[divinity]] with whales, such as some Ghanaians and Vietnamese, coastal Chinese except for southernmost region,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=謝婧, 下園知弥, 宮崎克則|year=2015|title=明清時代の中国における鯨資源の利用|url=http://www.seinan-gu.ac.jp/museum/wp-content/uploads/2015/publish/kiyou3.pdf|journal=西南学院大学博物館研究紀要 第3号|pages=9–14|publisher=[[Seinan Gakuin University]]|format=pdf|accessdate=2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese (also known as [[Ebisu (mythology)|Ebisu]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[村上健司]]編著|title=日本妖怪大事典|year=2005|publisher=[[角川書店]]|series=Kwai books|isbn=978-4-04-883926-6|pages=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="大藤1955"&gt;{{Cite book|author=大藤時彦他|editor=民俗学研究所編|others=[[柳田國男]]監修|title=綜合日本民俗語彙|year=1955|publisher=[[平凡社]]|volume=第2巻|pages=763}}&lt;/ref&gt; occasionally hold funerals for beached whales; a throwback to Vietnam's ancient sea-based Austro-Asiatic culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Whale funeral draws 1000 mourners in Vietnam|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/04/13/1050172476288.html|agency=AFP|work=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=15 April 2011|date=14 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thousand gather for whale's funeral in Vietnam|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/thousand-gather-for-whales-funeral-in-vietnam-1907716.html|agency=Associated Press|work=The Independent|accessdate=15 April 2011|location=London|date=23 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;([[#Reference-idViegas2010|Viegas 2010]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Funeral for a Whale held at Apam|url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/artikel.php?ID=87737|work=Ghana News Agency|publisher=GhanaWeb|accessdate=15 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also the below-mentioned '''Ebisu''' in fish part for more details. In some lore, whales have been told to work for [[Ryūgū-jō]] as well.

Indigenous [[Ainu people|Ainu]] tribes on Hokkaido refereed [[killer whale]]s as ''[[Repun Kamuy]]'', "God of Sea/Offshore" in their folklore and myths that the deities will bring fortunes (whales) to coastal people.

{{Anchor|Whales in the Bible}}
The Bible mentions whales in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 1:21, [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]] 7:12, [[Ezekiel]] 32:2. The "sea monsters" in Lamentations 4:3 have been taken by some commentators to refer to marine mammals, in particular whales, although most modern versions use the word "jackals" instead ([http://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-3.htm Lamentations 4:3]).&lt;!-- "sea monsters" (marine mammals) in the Douay-Rheims, KJV, Webster, AKJV, and English Jubilee 2000 version - KJV margin "sea calves" (seals) --&gt; The story of [[Jonah#Jonah in Islam|Jonah]] being swallowed by a "big Fish" is told both in the Qur'an ({{Cite quran|37|139|e=148|s=ns}}) and in the Bible. The Old Testament contains the [[Book of Jonah]] and in the New Testament, Jesus mentions this story in [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 12:40 ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=jonah+1-4 Jonah 1-4]).

==Domesticated mammals==

===Cattle and buffalo===

{{Main|bull worship|Cattle in religion}}

Many religions have considered [[cattle in religion|cattle]] to be sacred, most famously [[Hinduism]] from India and Nepal, but also [[Zoroastrianism]], and ancient [[ancient Greek religion|Greek]] and [[ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian]] religion. Cattle and buffalo are respected by many pastoral peoples that rely on the animals for sustenance and the killing of an ox is a sacrificial function ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;51).

The [[Toda (tribe)|Toda]] of southern [[India]] abstain from the flesh of their domestic animal, the buffalo. However, once a year they sacrifice a bull calf, which is eaten in the forest by the adult males ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;51). The buffalo plays an important part in many Toda rituals. These buffalo are currently endangered.

Conspicuous among Egyptian animal cults was that of the bull, [[Apis (god)|Apis]]. It was distinguished by certain marks, and when the old Apis died a new one was sought. The finder was rewarded, and the bull underwent four months' education at [[Nilopolis]]. Its birthday was celebrated once a year when oxen, which had to be pure white, were sacrificed to it. Women were forbidden to approach it when once its education was finished. Oracles were obtained from it in various ways. After death it was mummified and buried in a rock-tomb. Less widespread was the cult of the [[Mnevis]], also consecrated to [[Osiris]] ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;51).

Similar observances are found in our own day on the Upper [[Nile]]. The [[Nuba]] and [[Nuer people|Nuer]] revere cattle. The [[Angoni]] of Central Africa and the [[Sakalava]] of Madagascar keep sacred bulls. In [[India]] respect for the cow is widespread, but is of post-Vedic origin; there is little actual worship, but the products of the cow are important in magic ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;51).

While there are several animals that are worshipped in India, the supreme position is held by the cow ([[#Reference-idMargul1968|Margul, 1968]], p.&amp;nbsp;63). The [[humped zebu]], a breed of cow, is central to the religion of Hinduism ([[#Reference-idMargul1968|Margul, 1968]], p.&amp;nbsp;63). Mythological legends have supported the sanctity of the zebu throughout India ([[#Reference-idMargul1968|Margul, 1968]], p.&amp;nbsp;64). Such myths have included the creation of a divine cow mother and a cow heaven by the God, [[Brahma]] and [[Prithu]], the sovereign of the universe, created the earth's vegetation, edible fruits and vegetables, disguised as a cow ([[#Reference-idMargul1968|Margul, 1968]], p.&amp;nbsp;64).

According to Tadeusz Margul, observations of the Hindu religion and the cow has led to a misunderstanding that Hindi have a servile relationship with the zebu, giving prayers and offerings to it daily. Typically, however, only during the Cow Holiday, an annual event, is the cow the recipient of such practices ([[#Reference-idMargul1968|Margul, 1968]], p.&amp;nbsp;65). Margul suggests that sanctity of the cow is based on four foundations: abstaining from cow slaughter, abstaining from beef consumption, control of breeding and ownership, and belief in purification qualities of cow products (milk, curd, ghee, dung, and urine) ([[#Reference-idMargul1968|Margul, 1968]], p.&amp;nbsp;65-66).

===Sheep===
{{Main|Sheep#In religion and folklore}}

[[Amun]], the god of [[Thebes, Egypt]], was represented as ram-headed. His worshippers held the ram to be sacred, however, it was sacrificed once a year. Its fleece formed the clothing of the idol ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;52). Another Egyptian ram-headed god was ''Banebdjed'', a form of [[Osiris]].

===Goat===
{{Main|Goat#Religion, mythology, and folklore}}
[[File:Mosaic Pan Genazzano Massimo.jpg|thumb|left|Pavement mosaic with the head of Pan. Roman artwork, Antonine period, 138–192 CE.]]
[[Silenus]], the [[Satyr]]s and the [[Faun]]s were either capriform or had some part of their bodies shaped like that of a goat. In northern Europe the wood spirit, [[Leszi]], is believed to have a goat's horns, ears and legs ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;51). A deity known as the Goat of [[Mendes]] is associated with the [[pentagram]].

In Greece, Italy, and Egypt, the goat was worshipped in both goat form and phallic form ([[#Reference-idNeave1988|Neave 1988]], p.&amp;nbsp;8). This type of worship has sometimes been said to have originated from the goat's increased sex drive. One male goat was capable of fertilizing 150 females ([[#Reference-idNeave1988|Neave 1988]], p.&amp;nbsp;8). The Greek god [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] was depicted as having goat characteristics, such as hooves, horns, and a beard. Along with Pan, the goat was closely related to Dionysus during the Roman era ([[#Reference-idNeave1988|Neave 1988]], p.&amp;nbsp;8). To honor Dionysus, Romans would tear apart a goat and eat it alive. The goat was commonly associated with dark arts and the devil. This association was amplified in Egypt during the Middle Ages ([[#Reference-idNeave1988|Neave 1988]], p.&amp;nbsp;8).

Excavations in Central Asia have revealed ancient ritual goat-burial that show a religious significance of the goat predominantly in the area ([[#Reference-idSidky1990|Sidky 1990]], p.&amp;nbsp;286). These findings have been used as evidence for a goat-cult of Asia originating either in the Neolithic or Bronze Ages ([[#Reference-idSidky1990|Sidky 1990]], p.&amp;nbsp;286).

===Dog===
[[Image:Dog worship in Hinduism.jpg|thumb|A dog after being decorated in the [[Kukur tihar]] festival in Nepal.]]
{{Main|Dogs in religion}}

Dogs have a major religious significance among the [[Hindu]]s in [[Nepal]] and some parts of [[India]]. The dogs are worshipped as a part of a five-day [[Tihar (festival)|Tihar]] festival that falls roughly in November every year. In [[Hinduism]], it is believed that the dog is a messenger of ''[[Yama]]'', the god of death, and dogs guard the doors of [[Heaven]]. Socially, they are believed to be the protectors of our homes and lives. So, in order to please the dogs they are going to meet at Heaven's doors after death, so they would be allowed in Heaven, people mark the 14th day of the [[lunar cycle]] in November as '''Kukur-tihar''', as known in Nepali language for the dog's day. This is a day when the dog is worshipped by applying ''[[Tilaka|tika]]'' (the holy vermilion dot), incense sticks and garlanded generally with [[Tagetes|marigold]] flower.

Actual dog worship is uncommon. The [[Nosarii]] of western Asia are said to worship a dog. The [[Karang Jiwo|Karang]] of Java had a cult of the red dog, each family keeping one in the house. According to one authority the dogs are images of wood which are worshipped after the death of a member of the family and burnt after a thousand days. In [[Nepal]] it is said that dogs are worshipped at the festival called Khicha Puja. Among the [[Harranian]]s dogs were sacred, but this was rather as brothers of the mystae ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;51).

===Horse===
[[File:Uffington-White-Horse-sat.jpg|thumb|The Uffington White Horse]]
{{Main|Horse worship}}

[[Horse worship]] has been practiced by a number of [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] and [[Turkic peoples]]. There is some reason to believe that [[Poseidon]], like other water gods, was originally conceived under the form of a [[horse]]. In the cave of [[Phigalia]] [[Demeter]] was, according to popular tradition, represented with the head and mane of a horse, possibly a relic of the time when a non-specialized [[Vegetation deity|corn-spirit]] bore this form. Her priests were called [[Poloi]] ([[Greek language|Greek]] for "colts") in [[Laconia]]. The mule and the horse are sacred to the Roman god [[Consus]]. In [[Gaul]] we find a horse-goddess, [[Epona]]. There are also traces of a horse-god, [[Rudiobus]]. [[Hayagriva]] is a horse-headed deity that appears in both [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]]. The [[Gonds]] in India worship a horse-god, [[Koda Pen]], in the form of a shapeless stone, but it is not clear that the horse is regarded as divine. The horse or mare is a common form of the corn-spirit in Europe ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;52).

Among the Balkan culture, swaddling an unmarried person in a horse-girth is a typical ritual. It is thought that the sexual potency of the horse is passed to the individual wrapped in its girth ([[#Reference-idVukanović1980|Vukanović 1980]], p.&amp;nbsp;112). Along with the Balkan swaddling, Virgil's Aeneid bases the founding of the great city of Carthage upon a horse ([[#Reference-idBrown1950|Qtd. in Brown 1950]], p.&amp;nbsp;32). When the Phoenicians dug up a horse head from the ground they decided to build their city (Carthage) upon that spot because the horse was a sign of success ([[#Reference-idBrown1950|Qtd. in Brown 1950]], p.&amp;nbsp;32). Thus, Brown argued that the horse was sacred to the Phoenician people ([[#Reference-idBrown1950|Brown 1950]], p.&amp;nbsp;32).

===Elephant===
{{main|Cultural depictions of elephants}}

[[Image:13th century Ganesha statue.jpg|right|upright|thumb|A statue of [[Ganesha]] - the elephant-headed Hindu god of wisdom and obstacle removal]]
In [[Thailand]] it is believed that a white [[elephant]] may contain the soul of a dead person, perhaps a Buddha. When one is taken the capturer is rewarded and the animal brought to the king to be kept ever afterwards. It cannot be bought or sold. It is baptized and fêted and mourned for like a human being at its death. In some parts of Indo-China the belief is that the soul of the elephant may injure people after death; it is therefore fêted by a whole village. In [[Cambodia]] it is held to bring luck to the kingdom. The cult of the white elephant is also found at [[Ennarea]] in southern [[Ethiopia]] ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;51). In India, the popular Hindu god [[Ganesha]] has the head of an elephant and a torso of a human.

In [[Surat]], unmarried Anāvil girls participate in a holiday referred to as Alunām ([[#Reference-idNaik1958|Naik, 1958]], p.&amp;nbsp;393). This holiday is to honor the goddess [[Pārvatī]]. During this celebration, a clay elephant is prepared (most likely to celebrate [[Pārvatī]]'s creation of [[Ganesha]] from a paste of either [[turmeric]] or [[sandalwood]]). Every day, the unmarried women worship this elephant by dancing, singing songs, and abstaining from eating salt. On the final day of Alunām, the clay elephant is immersed in some body of water ([[#Reference-idNaik1958|Naik, 1958]], p.&amp;nbsp;393).

Certain cultures also used elephant figurines to display the animal's importance. There was evidence of an ancient elephant cult in [[Sumatra]] ([[#Reference-idSchnitger1938|Schnitger, 1938]], p.&amp;nbsp;41). Stone elephant figurines were built as "seats of the souls" in the Sumatran culture ([[#Reference-idSchnitger1938|Schnitger, 1938]], p.&amp;nbsp;41). In [[North Borneo]], however, wooden elephant figurines were placed on the top of a bamboo pole. This bamboo pole was only erected after the tribe chief had collected a certain number of human heads ([[#Reference-idSchnitger1938|Schnitger, 1938]], p.&amp;nbsp;41).

==Wild mammals==
[[Image:Diane de Versailles Leochares 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Artemis]] with a deer, the ''[[Diana of Versailles]]'' in the Louvre ''Galerie des Caryatides'' that was designed for it]]

In North America the [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] tribes had as their chief deity a "mighty great [[hare]]" to whom they went at death. According to one account he lived in the east, according to another in the north. In his anthropomorphized form he was known as [[Nanabozho|Menabosho]] or [[Michabo]] ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;51).

The [[Deer in mythology|deer]] is important in the mythology of many peoples. To the Greeks it was sacred to the goddess [[Artemis]], while in [[Hinduism]] it is linked to the goddess [[Saraswati]]. The deer also held spiritual significance to the pastoralist cultures of the [[Eurasian Steppe]]. The golden stag figurine found in the [[Pazyryk burials]] is one of the most famous pieces of Scythian art.

===Wolf===

{{See also|Cultural depictions of lions|Cats in ancient Egypt}}
The cult of the [[leopard]] is widely found in West Africa. Among the [[Ashanti people]] a man who kills one is liable to be put to death; no leopard skin may be exposed to view, but a stuffed leopard is worshipped. On the Gold Coast a leopard hunter who has killed his victim is carried round the town behind the body of the leopard; he may not speak, must besmear himself so as to look like a leopard and imitate its movements. In [[Kingdom of Loango|Loango]] a prince's cap is put upon the head of a dead leopard, and dances are held in its honour ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;52).

In [[Ancient Egypt]], the first known cat-headed deity was [[Mafdet]]. During the [[First Dynasty of Egypt|First Dynasty]] 2920–2770 BC, she was regarded as protector of the [[Pharaoh]]'s chambers against [[snake]]s, [[scorpion]]s and evil. She was often depicted with a head of a leopard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Divine Cat and the Snake in Egypt |author=Hornblower, G.D. |journal=Man |year=1943 |issue=43 |pages=85−87}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[lion]]-headed deity [[Sekhmet]] was considered a daughter of [[Ra]] and was worshipped as protector of Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Engels, D.W. |year=2001 |title=Classical Cats.

There was a lion-god at [[Baalbek]]. The [[Arabic mythology|pre-Islamic Arabs]] worshipped the lion-god [[Yaghuth]]. In modern Africa we find a lion-idol among the [[Balonda]] ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;52). The lion was also sacred to [[Hebat]], the [[mother goddess]] of the [[Hurrians]].{{cn|date=October 2018}}

In [[Judaism]] the patriarch Jacob refers to his son Judah as a Gur Aryeh גּוּר אַרְיֵה יְהוּדָה, a "Young Lion" (Genesis 49:9) when blessing him. Thus the [[Lion of Judah]] started to be reverenced in some others abrahamic cults, symbolising their prophets, as such as [[Jesus]] and [[Haile Selassie I]], the ''ras'' Tafari.

In Mesoamerica [[Jaguars in Mesoamerican culture|the jaguar was revered]] as a symbol of fertility and warriorship among the [[Aztec]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]] and [[Olmec]], and had an important role in shamanism.

===Tiger===
[[File:Durga Mahisasuramardini.JPG|thumb|upright|The Indian goddess [[Durga]] riding a tiger. Guler school, early 18th century.]]
{{See also|Tiger#Cultural depictions}}
Of great importance in Chinese myth and culture, the [[Tiger (zodiac)|Tiger]] is one of the 12 [[Chinese astrology|Chinese zodiac]] animals. Also in various [[Chinese art]] and martial art, the tiger is depicted as an earth symbol and equal rival of the [[Chinese dragon]]- the two representing matter and spirit respectively. The [[White Tiger (Chinese constellation)|White Tiger]] ({{zh|c=白虎|p=Bái Hǔ}}) is one of the [[Four Symbols (Chinese constellation)|Four Symbols]] of the [[Chinese constellation]]s. It is sometimes called the White Tiger of the West (西方白虎), and it represents the [[west]] and the autumn season ([[#Reference-idCooper1992|Cooper 1992]], pp.&amp;nbsp;226–27).

The tiger replaces the lion as king of the beasts in cultures of eastern Asia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.savechinastigers.org/node/316 |title=Tiger Culture &amp;#124; Save China's Tigers |publisher=English.savechinastigers.org |date= |accessdate=2009-03-07| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090212165117/http://english.savechinastigers.org/node/316| archivedate= 12 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; representing royalty, fearlessness and wrath.  In Chinese children stories, it is often depicted that the stripes on a tiger's forehead represent the character 王 ("king") ([[#Reference-idCooper1992|Cooper 1992]], pp.&amp;nbsp;226–27).

Some cultures that celebrated tiger worship are still represented contemporarily. In the suburbs of [[Kunming]], China, there is a tourist attraction where the tiger worship of the Yi is displayed for visitors. This attraction called the Solar Calendar Square is complete with a growling tiger statue, measuring to be five meters high ([[#Reference-idHarrell&amp;Yongxiang2003|Harrell &amp; Yongxiang 2003]], p.&amp;nbsp;380). In Chuxiong of China, a similar attraction exists. A tiger totem is presented for tourists; the totem portrays the Yi belief of the tiger setting the entire world in motion. A tiger dance of the Shuangbai County is also performed at such places explaining the history of the Yi and their worship of tigers ([[#Reference-idHarrell&amp;Yongxiang2003|Harrell &amp; Yongxiang 2003]], p.&amp;nbsp;380).

Along with these tourist attractions that display historical practices of the Yi, there is also additional evidence for tiger worship. Tigers were found depicted on small stones. These stones were pierced and worn as amulets, suggesting that the tiger had a certain power of protection for its wearer ([[#Reference-idWaterbury1952|Waterbury 1952]], p.&amp;nbsp;76). The Queen Mother deity of the west, [[Queen Mother of the West|Hsi Wang Mu]], sometimes possessed a tail of a tiger in her depictions and, like the tiger, was associated with the mountains ([[#Reference-idWaterbury1952|Waterbury 1952]], p.&amp;nbsp;76). The tiger was also a deity for both the Tungus and the Black Pottery people ([[#Reference-idWaterbury1952|Waterbury 1952]], p.&amp;nbsp;80).

In many parts of Vietnam, the [[tiger]] is a revered creature. In each village, there might be a tiger temple. This worshiping practice might have stem from the fear of tigers used to raid human settlements in the ancient time. Tigers are admired for their great strength, ferocity and grace. Tiger is also considered a guardian deity. Tiger statutes are usually seen at the entrance of temples and palaces, keeping evil spirits from entering those places.

The tiger is associated with the [[Hindu]] deities [[Shiva]] and [[Durga]]. In [[Pokhara]], Nepal the tiger festival is known as [[Bagh Jatra]]. Celebrants dance disguised as tigers and "hunted". The [[Warli]] tribe of [[Maharashtra]], [[India]] worship Waghia the lord of tigers in the form of a shapeless stone ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;52). In [[Vietnamese folk religion]] and [[Dongbei folk religion]] tiger-gods are also found.

===Monkey===
[[File:Hear speak see no evil Toshogu.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[three wise monkeys]] over the [[Nikkō Tōshō-gū|Tōshō-gū]] shrine in [[Nikkō]], [[Japan]]]]
{{Main|Monkey}}
In Hinduism the monkey deity, [[Hanuman]], is a prominent figure. He is a reincarnation of Shiva, the god of destruction. In orthodox villages monkeys are safe from harm ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;52).

[[Chinese religions]] and [[Chinese mythology|mythologies]] give monkeys and apes [[Monkeys in Chinese culture#Religious significance|cultural significance]] as metaphors for people. Chinese deities sometimes appear in the guise of monkeys, for example, [[Sun Wukong]] or "Monkey King" is the main protagonist in [[Wu Cheng'en]]'s picaresque novel ''[[Journey to the West]]''. In traditional [[Chinese folk religion]], monkeys are supernatural beings that could [[shape shift]] into either monkey-demons or were-monkeys, and legends about monkey-human interbreeding are common. In [[Daoism]], monkeys, particularly gibbons, were believed to have longevity like a ''[[xian (Daoism)|xian]]'' "transcendent; immortal", and to be innately adept at circulating and absorbing ''[[qi]]'' "breath; life force" through the Daoist discipline of ''[[daoyin]]'' "guiding and pulling". Similar to Daoism, [[Chinese Buddhism]] paradoxically treats monkeys as both wise and foolish animals. On the one hand, the ''[[Jataka tales]]'' say that [[Gautama Buddha]] was a benevolent monkey king in an earlier incarnation; and on the other hand, monkeys symbolized trickery and ignorance, represented by the [[Chan Buddhist]] "[[mind monkey]]" metaphor for the unsettled, restless nature of human mentality.

Monkeys are said to be worshipped in [[Togo]]. At [[Porto Novo]], in French West Africa, twins have tutelary spirits in the shape of small monkeys ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;52).

===Rodent===
In some countries, e.g. India, a small number of temples are dedicated to the worship of wild mice. Whilst widely regarded as a creature to be avoided, for pestilential reasons in such temples the animals are actively encouraged. It is frequently associated with Ganesh. As a creature capable of survival, it is to be revered and respected.

==Birds==

===Crow/raven===
{{Main|Raven in mythology}}

The [[Raven]] is the chief deity of the [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]] people of [[Alaska]]. All over that region it is the chief figure in a group of myths, fulfilling the office of a culture hero who brings the light, gives fire to mankind, and so on ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;51). A raven story from the [[Puget Sound]] region describes the "Raven" as having originally lived in the land of spirits (literally ''bird land'') that existed before the world of humans. One day the Raven became so bored with ''bird land'' that he flew away, carrying a stone in his beak. When the Raven became tired of carrying the stone and dropped it, the stone fell into the ocean and expanded until it formed the firmament on which humans now live.

In the creator role, and in the Raven's role as the [[totem]] and [[Apical ancestor|ancestor]] of one of the four northwest clan houses, the Raven is often addressed as ''Grandfather Raven''. It is not clear whether this form of address is intended to refer to a [[Creator deity|creator]] Raven who is different from the [[trickster]] Raven, or if it is just a vain attempt to encourage the trickster spirit to act respectably.

Together with the eagle-hawk the crow plays a great part in the mythology of southeastern [[Australia]] ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;51). Ravens also play a part in some European mythologies, such as in the [[Celtic mythology|Celtic]] and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Religions]], where they were connected to [[Bran the Blessed|Bran]] and the [[Morrigan]] in the former and [[Woden]] in the latter.

===Hawk===
North Borneo treated the [[hawk]] as a god, but it was technically the messenger of the people's Supreme God ([[#Reference-idWaterbury1952|Waterbury 1952]], p.&amp;nbsp;62). There were rituals that involved the hawk when the natives wished to make decisions about certain events, such as journeys from home, major agricultural work, and war ([[#Reference-idWaterbury1952|Waterbury 1952]], p.&amp;nbsp;62). In North [[Borneo]] we seem to see the evolution of a god in the three stages of the cult of the hawk among the [[Kenyahs]], the [[Kayans]] and the sea [[Dyaks]]. The Kenyahs will not kill it, address to it thanks for assistance, and formally consult it before leaving home on an expedition. It seems, however, to be regarded as the messenger of the supreme god Balli Penyalong. The Kayans have a hawk-god, [[Laki Neho]], but seem to regard the hawk as the servant of the chief god, [[Laki Tenangan]]. [[Singalang Burong]], the hawk-god of the Dyaks, is completely anthropomorphized. He is god of omens and ruler of the omen birds, but the hawk is not his messenger. For he never leaves his house. Stories are, however, told of his attending feasts in human form and flying away in hawk form when all was over ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;52).

According to Florance Waterbury, hawk worship was universal ([[#Reference-idWaterbury1952|Waterbury 1952]], p.&amp;nbsp;26). This particular bird was "a heavenly deity; its wings were the sky, the sun and moon were its eyes" ([[#Reference-idWaterbury1952|Waterbury 1952]], p.&amp;nbsp;26). The hawk is commonly associated with the Egyptian god [[Horus]]. The souls of former pharaohs were the followers of Horus and therefore, the hawk ([[#Reference-idWaterbury1952|Waterbury 1952]], p.&amp;nbsp;26). Horus was depicted by the Egyptians as a human body with a hawk head after the Fourth and Fifth Dynasty, but before that he was represented as a hawk ([[#Reference-idWaterbury1952|Waterbury 1952]], p.&amp;nbsp;27).

Egypt was not the only location of hawk worshippers. There were several other cultures which held the hawk in high regard. The hawk was a deity on the island of Hawaii and symbolized swift justice ([[#Reference-idWaterbury1952|Waterbury 1952]], p.&amp;nbsp;62). Along with the lone island from the Hawaiian archipelago, the Fiji islands also had some tribes who worshipped a hawk god ([[#Reference-idWaterbury1952|Waterbury 1952]], p.&amp;nbsp;62). Furthermore, although animal worshipping is not a part of Sikh culture, a white falcon bird is mostly regarded in Sikhism as it was associated with the sixth guru and especially the tenth guru. The tenth guru would always carry a white falcon perched on his hand when going out to hunt. The tenth guru was known as the Master of White Hawk. Many people believe that the bird carried by Guru Gobind Singh was a hawk, however historians believe that the bird was a gyrfalcon or a saker falcon.

===Frigatebird===
On [[Easter Island]] until the 1860s there was a [[Tangata manu]] (Bird man) cult which has left us Paintings and [[Petroglyphs]] of Birdmen (half men half [[frigatebird]]s). The cult involved an annual race to collect the first [[sooty tern]] egg of the season from the islet of [[Motu Iti (Rapa Nui)|Moto Iti]] and take it to [[Orongo]].

The Frigate Bird Cult is thought to have originated in the Solomon Islands before immigrating to Easter Island where it became obsolete ([[#Reference-idBalfour1917|Balfour 1917]], p.&amp;nbsp;374). The Frigate-Bird was a representation of the god [[Makemake (mythology)|Make-make]], the god of the seabird's egg on Easter Island ([[#Reference-idBalfour1917|Balfour 1917]], p.&amp;nbsp;374).

==Other non-mammals==

===Serpent===
{{Main|Snake worship }}
[[Image:Naga3.jpg|thumb| right|The altar where serpent deities are worshipped in a temple in [[Belur, Karnataka|Belur]], [[Karnataka]], India]]
[[Image:Quetzalcoatl telleriano.jpg|thumb|right|Quetzalcoatl depicted as a snake devouring a man, from the [[Codex Telleriano-Remensis]].]]
The worship of the serpent is found in many parts of the [[Old World]], and in the Americas ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;52).

In India [[snake worship]] refers to the high status of [[snake]]s in [[Hindu mythology]]. Over a large part of India there are carved representations of cobras ([[Naga (mythology)|nagas]]) or stones as substitutes. To these human food and flowers are offered and lights are burned before the shrines. Among the Dravidians a cobra which is accidentally killed is burned like a human being; no one would kill one intentionally. The serpent-god's image is carried in an annual procession by a celibate priestess ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;52).

At one time there were many prevalent different renditions of the serpent cult located in India. In Northern India, a masculine version of the serpent named Nagaraja and known as the "king of the serpents" was worshipped. Instead of the "king of the serpents," actual live snakes were worshipped in South India ([[#Reference-idBhattacharyya1965|Bhattacharyya 1965]], p.&amp;nbsp;1). The Manasa-cult in Bengal, India, however, was dedicated to the anthropomorphic serpent goddess, [[Manasa]] ([[#Reference-idBhattacharyya1965|Bhattacharyya 1965]], p.&amp;nbsp;1).

In Africa the chief centre of [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]] worship was [[Dahomey]]. but the cult of the python seems to have been of exotic origin, dating back to the first quarter of the 17th century. By the conquest of Whydah the Dahomeyans were brought in contact with a people of serpent worshippers, and ended by adopting from them the beliefs which they at first despised. At Whydah, the chief centre, there is a serpent temple, tenanted by some fifty snakes. Every python of the ''danh-gbi'' kind must be treated with respect, and death is the penalty for killing one, even by accident. ''Danh-gbi'' has numerous wives, who until 1857 took part in a public procession from which the profane crowd was excluded; a python was carried round the town in a hammock, perhaps as a ceremony for the expulsion of evils. The rainbow-god of the Ashanti was also conceived to have the form of a snake. His messenger was said to be a small variety of boa. but only certain individuals, not the whole species, were sacred. In many parts of Africa the serpent is looked upon as the incarnation of deceased relatives. Among the Amazulu, as among the [[Betsileo]] of Madagascar, certain species are assigned as the abode of certain classes. The [[Maasai people|Maasai]], on the other hand, regard each species as the habitat of a particular family of the tribe ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;52).

The Ancient Egyptians worshiped a number of snake gods, including [[Apep|Apophis]] and [[Set (mythology)|Set]], and the Sumerians before them had a serpent god [[Ningizzida]].

===Fish===
{{Main|Fish in culture}}

[[Image:Dagon1.jpg|thumb|A modern interpretation of Dagon as a "fish-god"]]
According to the [[Jewish]] scholar [[Rashi]], the [[Canaan]]ite god [[Dagon]] was a fish god. This tradition may have originated here, with a misinterpretation, but recently uncovered [[relief]]s suggest a fish-god with human head and hands was worshipped by people who wore fish-skins ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;51).

In Japan, there was a deity called Ebisu-gami who, according to Sakurada Katsunori, was widely revered by fishing communities and industries ([[#Reference-idNaumann1974|Qtd. in Naumann, 1974]], p.&amp;nbsp;1). Ebisu, in later traditions, normally appeared in the form of a fisherman holding a fishing pole and carrying a red tai (a perch), but would sometimes take the form of a whale, shark, human corpse, or rock ([[#Reference-idNaumann1974|Naumann, 1974]], p.&amp;nbsp;1). The general image of Ebisu, however, appears to be the whale or the shark, according to Sakurada ([[#Reference-idNaumann1974|Qtd. in Naumann, 1974]], p.&amp;nbsp;2).

During Ebisu-gami festivals, there have been legends told of strange fish creatures which have arrived and been considered sacred. Examples of such fish creatures include familiar species of fish with multiple tails ([[#Reference-idNaumann1974|Naumann, 1974]], p.&amp;nbsp;2). Sometimes these fish were considered to be simply an offering to the deity. Other times, however, they were considered to be Ebisu himself, visiting on the festival day ([[#Reference-idNaumann1974|Naumann, 1974]], p.&amp;nbsp;2). Large marine [[megafauna]]s such as whales and [[whale shark]]s (also called as "Ebisu-shark") were often referred as Ebisu himself to bring mass of fish among them, and as guardians of fishermen.&lt;ref name="大藤1955" /&gt;

==Oracular animals==
Animals are frequently used for the purposes of [[divination]].
[[Bird]]s are especially common in this role, as by their faculty of flight they offer themselves to the interpretation as messengers between the celestial and human spheres. [[Augury]] was a highly developed practice of telling the future from the flight of birds in [[Classical Antiquity]]. The [[dove]] appears as an oracular animal in the story of [[Noah]], and also in [[Thisbe]] in [[Boeotia]] there was a dove-oracle of [[Zeus]]. Animal imagery was also often employed in the [[oracle|oracular utterances]] in Ancient Greece ([[#Reference-idLightfoot2008|Lightfoot 2008]], p.&amp;nbsp;237,&amp;nbsp;fn.&amp;nbsp;105). [[Parrot astrology]] is a form of divination using [[green parakeet]]s which originated in South India and is still practised in modern times.&lt;ref name=sing&gt;{{cite web|last=Naidu Ratnala|first=Thulaja|title=Parrot astrologers|url=http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_602_2005-01-04.html|work=National Library Board Singapore|accessdate=23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Chinese traditional religion]], the [[tortoise]] is an oracular animal.

Notable oracular animals of the modern period include [[Lady Wonder]], [[Punxsutawney Phil]], [[Maggie the Monkey]], [[Lazdeika the Crab]], [[Paul the Octopus]], and [[Sonny Wool]].

==Shamanism and animals==
{{Main|Shamanism}}
Animals were an important aspect of the Shaman religion in Central Asia. Also known as "assistant spirits," "guardian spirits," and "helping spirits," animal spirits are an integral part of a shaman's work. The more animal spirits a shaman had under his control, the more powerful the shaman ([[#Reference-idWaida1983|Waida, 1983]], p.&amp;nbsp;228-229). When a shaman set out to journey spiritually to the outer world, animals were a key component, assisting him in his work. There were three primary reasons for a shaman to take such a journey: to find a lost soul, to bring an animal spirit to the high gods, or to lead a soul to its new resting place in the underworld. All of these were extremely important to followers of shamanism and animals were extremely important in facilitating the shaman's efforts ([[#Reference-idWaida1983|Waida, 1983]], p.&amp;nbsp;231).

An example of animal spirits in Shamanism comes from the Yenisei Ostiaks culture. During a healing procedure, a shaman invokes a number of animal spirits to help him. The spirits arrive and enter his body. The shaman is not possessed by these spirits; he is free to expel them at any time ([[#Reference-idWaida1983|Waida, 1983]], p.&amp;nbsp;223). His body begins to leap all over the place, symbolizing that his soul is rising, leaving the earth and going up to the sky. It is a bird spirit that is lifting him through the atmosphere and he cries for it to take him higher so he can see further. According to Adolf Friedrich, at this point the shaman's essence has, in fact, transformed into the bird spirit that crossed the threshold into his body ([[#Reference-idWaida1983|Waida, 1983]], p.&amp;nbsp;223). He finally spots what he is looking for, the soul of his ill patient. Still assisting him, the animal spirits carry the shaman to the patient's soul. The shaman retrieves it and returns the soul to its rightful place, healing the patient. Without the presence of animal spirits, the shaman could not have accomplished such a feat ([[#Reference-idWaida1983|Waida, 1983]], p.&amp;nbsp;231).

In the Inner Eurasian religion, the transformation of a shaman's essence into an animal spirit is referred to as "becoming animal" ([[#Reference-idBaldick2000|Baldick 2000]], p.&amp;nbsp;167). The importance of animals in this shamanic religion is shown by the capabilities that animals grant to human beings. Without the assistance of animals, humans from Inner Eurasia were not capable of reaching the sky, traveling rapidly throughout the earth, or going beneath the earth's outer crust, all of which were important activities to the culture ([[#Reference-idBaldick2000|Baldick 2000]], p.&amp;nbsp;167). Heaven was not attainable for a person without the assistance of an eagle. Because of the eagle, an animal, the Inner Eurasians believed that they were capable of achieving their after-life and living in the home of their ancestors and Supreme God after their departure from the earth ([[#Reference-idBaldick2000|Baldick 2000]], p.&amp;nbsp;167). Heaven was represented by the people in assemblies of animals, usually grouped in sevens or nines ([[#Reference-idBaldick2000|Baldick 2000]], p.&amp;nbsp;167). When participating in hunting or warfare, Inner Eurasians also took on animal qualities because they believed it would increase their success ([[#Reference-idBaldick2000|Baldick 2000]], p.&amp;nbsp;167). Animals were a central part of this religion ([[#Reference-idBaldick2000|Baldick 2000]], p.&amp;nbsp;167).

==Religion and animals==

===Buddhism===
{{Main|Animals in Buddhism}}
{{see also|Life release|Buddhist vegetarianism}}

One of the most important sanctions of the [[Buddhist]] faith is the concept of [[ahimsa]], or refraining from the destruction of life ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&amp;nbsp;234). According to Buddhist belief, humans do not deserve preferential treatment over other living beings. Thus, the world is not specifically meant for human use and should be shared equally amongst all creatures ([[#Reference-idEpstein1990|Epstein 1990]]). Buddhists recognize that all animals are sentient and are capable of feeling pain, grief, fear, happiness, and hunger ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], pp.&amp;nbsp;234–235). The [[Dalai Lama]] once said "Even ants and other insects will run away from danger... They have intelligence and want to live too. Why should we harm them?" ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Qtd. in Regenstein 1991]], p.&amp;nbsp;235). Not believing in inflicting harm on any living, sentient being, some Buddhists also follow a [[vegetarian]] diet to avoid causing pain to animals ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&amp;nbsp;238).

Avoiding the destruction of life can affect aspects beyond a Buddhist's diet, such as travel plans. In order to avoid crushing any living thing, be it plant, insect, or animal, some Buddhist [[monk]]s do not travel during rainy seasons ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&amp;nbsp;236). Originally, shortly after Buddhism was first founded, monks traveled during all seasons, but public opinion changed this. The people protested that so much life was crushed and destroyed when monks traveled during the wet season. As a result, monks were required to seek shelter during this season and abstain from journeys ([[#Reference-idChapple1993|Chapple 1993]], p.&amp;nbsp;22).

Living creatures, including humans, culminate to form one large, united life-force in the Buddhist religion. Buddhists, therefore, believe that to harm another living creature is to, in fact, harm yourself as all life-forms are interrelated ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&amp;nbsp;237). There are many tales that depict humans sacrificing their lives so that an animal may live. A [[jataka]], or previous incarnation story, tells how the Buddha, (upon hearing the distraught cries of a lioness struggling to feed her hungry cubs), leapt from a cliff and smashed his body to death as an offering, so that she could feed his flesh to them ([[#Reference-idChapple1993|Chapple 1993]]).

===Hinduism===
{{main|Cow protection movement|Cattle slaughter in India|Elephants in Kerala culture|Lion Capital of Ashoka}}
{{see also|Animal sacrifice in Hinduism|Ashvamedha}}

[[Hinduism]] is one of the six primary [[Religions in India|religions]] of [[India]] ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&amp;nbsp;221). Hinduism has evolved over several centuries from [[Vedas|Vedic]] times when there was no restriction on animal worship and also animal consumption for food, to later [[Buddhist]] and [[Jainism|Jain]]-influenced [[eras]] that led to a wider concept adoption of [[non-violence]] or [[ahimsa]] and respect for animals,  as a major constituent in [[Dharmic]] belief systems ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&amp;nbsp;223). Humans and animals are believed to be one family and therefore, humans should treat all living creatures with respect and kindness. It is also believed that human beings themselves [[Re-incarnation|re-incarnate]] as animals based on their deeds or [[karma]]. Pets are often treated as if they are truly members of the family ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&amp;nbsp;223-224).

There are some exceptions to ahimsa in Hinduism - mainly dealing with religious rituals to please gods on [[Animal sacrifice in Hinduism#Animal sacrifice in contemporary Hindu society|special occasions]] and for daily sustenance. While Hindu belief proscribes the slaughter for human pleasure or lavishness {{citation needed|date=June 2017}}, animal sacrifice has been an accepted ritual in ''some'' parts of India ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&amp;nbsp;225).An example of such lavishness would be hunting for pleasure, a fur coat made from animal skin, etc. An explanation for this supposed paradox is that a sacrificial animal is not really considered to be an animal, but a symbol. Thus, when the animal is sacrificed, they are sacrificing the symbol and not the animal ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&amp;nbsp;226).

===Jainism===
{{main|Ahimsa in Jainism}}
{{see also|Jain vegetarianism}}

[[Mahavira]], the founder of [[Jainism]], believed that the only way to be released from the cycle of life (birth, death, and then rebirth), one must follow, like Buddhists, ahimsa and not harm any living creature ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&amp;nbsp;229). Some Jains will carry a broom with them and sweep their path as they walk to avoid stepping on any living creature. Jains will also wear masks over their mouths to prevent swallowing insects and inspect their fruit for worms. The fruit inspection is not, however, because of their aversion of worms, but for the protection of the worms themselves ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&amp;nbsp;229-230). Jains are also only allowed to eat during daylight hours, when their vision is not restricted, so that they avoid eating insects or other small creatures that could possibly be in their food ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&amp;nbsp;230).

Jainism includes a lay form which is somewhat less restrictive ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&amp;nbsp;231). Basically lay Jains must distinguish between what forms of violence are necessary and unnecessary, but do not have to abstain entirely ([[#Reference-idVallely2002|Vallely 2002]], p.&amp;nbsp;5). This results in avoiding all forms of hunting, tilling the soil (tilling involved disturbing creatures embedded in the earth), and brewing (brewing involved using living organisms such as yeasts) ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&amp;nbsp;231).

Food will never be prepared especially for them. They beg for food from others believing that because the food was prepared for someone else, they are not the cause of violence towards living creatures ([[#Reference-idVallely2002|Vallely 2002]], p.&amp;nbsp;5).

Lay Jains, who have the financial capacity, will visit animal markets and buy/rescue animals destined for slaughter for the good that it does. ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&amp;nbsp;232).

'''''{{lang|es|Asado}}''''' ({{IPA-es|aˈsaðo|lang}}) are the techniques and the social event of having or attending a barbecue&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.woz.ch/artikel/2007/nr26/leben/15131.html |title=Jedes Biest auf den Grill |first=Christoph |last=Kuhn |date=28 June 2007 |publisher=WOZ Die Wochenzeitung |location=Zurich |language=German |accessdate=29 December 2012 |quote=Asado heisst eigentlich gegrilltes Fleisch, Braten; das Wort wird heute für das Grillereignis allgemein gebraucht.}}&lt;/ref&gt; in various South American countries, where it is also a traditional event. An ''asado'' usually consists of beef, pork, chicken, {{lang|es|[[chorizo]]}}, and {{lang|es|[[morcilla]]}} which are cooked on a [[grilling|grill]], called a ''parrilla'', or an open fire.  Generally the meats are accompanied by red wine and salads. This meat is prepared by a person who is the assigned ''asador''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?filename=0&amp;article=2461&amp;context=etd&amp;type=additional |format=PDF |title=Crossing Borders: From Iowa to Argentina |work=Iowa Research Online |publisher=University of Iowa |accessdate=29 December 2012 |quote=The person who cooks the asado is called an "asador".}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''parrillero''.  

==History==
Huge herds of wild cattle roamed much of the pampa region of Argentina until the mid-nineteenth century. Inhabitants of the Río de la Plata, especially the equestrian [[gaucho]], developed a fondness for beef, especially asado, which is roasted beef (or lamb or goat). The meat, often a side of ribs, is skewered on a metal frame called an asador and is roasted by placing it next to a slow-burning fire. Gauchos favored cooking asado with the wood of the quebracho tree because it smokes very little. Asado, accompanied by maté tea, formed the basis of the gaucho diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/asado|title=Asado - Dictionary definition of Asado - Encyclopedia.com: FREE online dictionary|author=|date=|website=www.encyclopedia.com|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coal and fire==
[[File:Preparing the Asado.jpg|thumb|left|''asado'' on an open pit]]
Usually the ''asador'' begins by igniting the charcoal, which is often made of native trees, avoiding pines and eucalyptus as they have strong-smelling resins. In more sophisticated ''asados'' the charcoal is of a specific tree or made on the coal of recently burned wood, which is also commonplace when having an ''asado'' in a campfire. In Uruguay, charcoal is not used, but instead direct embers or hot coals.

Cooking can be done ''al asador'' or ''a la parrilla''. In the first case a fire is made on the ground or in a fire pit and surrounded by metal crosses (''asadores'') that hold the entire carcass of an animal splayed open to receive the heat from the fire. In the second case a fire is made and after the charcoal has formed, a grill with the meat is placed over it.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

===Embutidos and Achuras===
In many ''asados'', ''[[Chorizo#South America|chorizos]]'', ''morcillas'' ([[black pudding]]), ''chinchulines'' (cow [[chitterlings]]), ''mollejas'' ([[sweetbread]]s), and other [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s, often accompanied by ''[[provoleta]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-an-asado.htm |title=What is an Asado? |first=Devon |last=Pryor |work=wiseGEEK |accessdate=29 December 2012 |quote=Chicken is also common, as is a slab of queso provoleta, or provolone cheese.}}&lt;/ref&gt; would be served first while the cuts that require longer preparations are still on the grill. Sometimes these are served on a charcoal ''[[brasero (heater)|brasero]]''. ''Chorizos'' may be served with ''[[pan felipe]]'' or baguette bread, often called ''[[choripán]]''.

===Meats===
[[File:Shortribsphoto.jpg|thumb|230px|''Asado de tira'', flanken-cut [[short ribs]].]]
After appetizers, ''costillas'' or ''asado de tira'' ([[rib]]s) can be served. Next comes ''vacío'' ([[flank steak]]), ''[[matambre]]'' and possibly chicken and ''{{lang|es|[[chivito]]}}'' (goatling). Dishes such as ''[[pamplona (meat)|pamplona]]'', pork, and Patagonian lamb are becoming more frequent, particularly in restaurants. An ''asado'' also includes bread, a simple mixed salad of, for instance, lettuce, tomato, and onions, or it could be accompanied with ''verdurajo'' (grilled vegetables), a mixture made of potatoes, corn, onion, and eggplant cooked on the grill and seasoned with olive oil and salt. Beer, wine, soft drink, and other beverages are common. Dessert is usually fresh fruit.

[[File:Plato de lechazo, Valladolid.jpg|thumb|left|''Lechazo asado'' (roast [[lechazo]]), shown above, is a typical dish from [[Spanish cuisine]], as is the similar  ''Cochinillo asado'' ([[Pig roast|roast suckling pig]]).]]
Another traditional form to mainly roast the meat, used in Patagonia, is with the whole animal (especially lamb and pork) in a wood stick nailed in the ground and exposed to the heat of live coals, called ''asado al palo''.

The meat for an ''asado'' is not [[marination|marinate]]d, the only preparation being the application of salt before or during the cooking period.&lt;ref name=rockridge&gt;{{cite web|title=Rockridge Cornucopia: Politics and Food|url=http://www.rockridge.org/news/rockridge-cornucopia-politics-and-food|accessdate=12 June 2015|date=9 June 2013|last1=Kaufman|first1=Barry}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the heat and distance from the coals are controlled to provide a slow cooking; it usually takes around two hours to cook ''asado''. Further, grease from the meat is not encouraged to fall on the coals and create smoke which would adversely flavour the meat. In some ''asados'' the area directly under the meat is kept clear of coals.

The ''asado'' is usually placed in a tray to be immediately served, but it can also be placed on a brasero right on the table to keep the meat warm. ''[[Chimichurri]]'', a sauce of chopped parsley, dried oregano, garlic, salt, black pepper, onion, and paprika with olive oil, or ''salsa criolla'', a sauce of tomato and onion in vinegar, are common accompaniments to an ''asado'', where they are traditionally used on the offal, but not the steaks.

===Salad===
Food is often accompanied by salads, which in ''asado'' gatherings are traditionally made by women on site or brought to the ''asado'' from their homes while the men focus on the meats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vagabundomagazine.com/understanding-the-asado-barbecue-the-argentinian-way/ |title=Understanding the Asado: Barbecue The Argentinian Way |first=Guillermo |last=Astigarraga |date=19 October 2011 |work=Vagabundo Magazine |accessdate=29 December 2012 |quote=Men grill the meat, women make the salad -which is just tomato and lettuce dressed with oil and salt, and maybe a squirt of vinegar; after all, the salad is not the point, it’s all about the meat (look closely at how the different groups function, men in the backyard grilling, women in the kitchen chopping vegetables, all roles predetermined, neither side interested in introducing any variations).}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Salad Olivier]] (''ensalada rusa'') is one of the most common salads served at ''asados''.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-an-asado.htm |title=What is an Asado? |first=Devon |last=Pryor |work=wiseGEEK |accessdate=29 December 2012 |quote=One is more likely to see an ensalada rusa, made from potato, carrot, green peas, hardboiled eggs, and mayonnaise.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Paraguay [[Chipa Guasu]], [[sopa paraguaya]] and boiled [[cassava|manioc]] as a side dish is also served.

==Variations==
[[File:Argentinean asado.jpg|thumb|left|A typical Argentinean ''asado'' assortment consisting of beef, pork, ribs, pork ribs, chitterlings, sweetbread, sausages, blood sausages, and chicken.]]

In Chile, the normal version ''=cordero al palo'' (whole roast lamb) is usually accompanied with ''[[pebre]]'', a local condiment made from [[purée|pureed]] herbs, garlic, and hot peppers; in many ways similar to ''[[chimichurri]]''. The dish is typical of southern Chile and is served hot accompanied by salads. A whole lamb is tied to a spit and is then roasted perpendicular on a wood fire. The preparation lasts around 5 hours since cooking must be constant and on a low heat.

[[File:Asadojf1941.JPG|thumb|A Philippine ''asado'' roll.]]
This is not to be confused with ''asado'' in the Philippines, which is a dish cooked in a sweet, tomato-based [[stew]] usually accompanied by [[potato]]es, [[carrot]]s, and other vegetables. True to the "East-meets-West" nature of [[Filipino cuisine]] and [[Culture of the Philippines|culture]] in general, ''asado'' is also used as a filling in ''{{lang|zh|[[siopao]]}}'' ({{zh|t=[[wikt:燒|燒]][[wikt:包|包]]|poj=sio-pau}}), the local variant of ''{{lang|zh|[[baozi|bāozi]]}}'' ([[wikt:包|包]][[wikt:子|子]]). There is also a version of ''asado'' that is of [[Filipino-Chinese]] origin: the term is used for dried, red-coloured [[Confectionery|sweetmeats]] that are otherwise known by its Cantonese name, ''{{lang|zh|[[char siu]]}}''.

In Brazil, ''asado'' is called ''{{lang|pt|[[churrasco]]}}'', although the cooking is usually faster. Grilled and salted meat in Brazil is generally called "carne assada" and is often cut into small strips and served on a plate or cutting board in the middle of the table for all to partake. Various grilled meats, pork, sausages and occasionally chicken are also passed around from table to table on a spit and a slice is offered to each person. This is called "rodizio" because each person partakes in turn. Charcoal is predominantly used instead of [[ember]]s of [[wood]], and Brazilians tend to cook the meat on [[skewer]]s or grills. In some places, the meat is seasoned with salt and a little sugar.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

In Mexico, there is similar tradition of as ''parrilladas'' or ''[[carne asada]]s'', which incorporates various marinated cuts of meat, including steaks, chicken, and sausages (''chorizo'', ''[[longaniza]]'', and ''[[moronga]]'' being especially popular). These are all grilled over wood charcoal. Vegetables are also placed over the grill, especially green onions (''cebollitas''), ''[[nopal]]es'', and corn ([[elote]]'').

[[File:Chulengo.jpg|thumb|A "chulengo" is usually an oil barrel cut in half, used to protect the fire and meat from winds]]
[[File:Grilling sauages in Montevideo.jpg|thumb|left|Line cooks grilling sausages, asado, and [[offal]] in a market near the port of Montevideo, Uruguay.]]
Again, in Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay, some alternatives are the ''asado al disco'' and ''asado al horno de barro'', especially in the countryside. The recipe doesn't change, only the way of cooking. In the ''asado al disco'' the worn-out disc of a [[plough]] is used. Being metallic and concave, three or four metallic legs are welded and with hot coal or lumber below it is easily transformed into an effective grill. Food is put in a spiral, in such a way that the fat naturally slips to the center, preserving the meat for being fried. [[Bell pepper]]s and onions are usually put next to the edge, so that they gradually release their juices on the meat. The ''asado al horno de barro'' differs from tradition, as an adobe''[[horno]]'' (oven, called tatakua in Paraguay) is used. These ovens are a common view in Argentine and Paraguayan ''[[estancia]]s''; their primary function is to bake bread, [[Chipa Guasu]] and [[Sopa paraguaya]], but they are well suited for roasting meat. [[Pork]] suckling and, less commonly, [[lamb and mutton|lamb]] are served, as they are more unlikely to become dry.
Another way of cooking the asado is inside a ''chulengo'', an oil barrel (or similar) cut in half, inside which the grill is placed to protect both the meat and fire from heavy winds. This makes the ''chulengo'' specially used in the [[Patagonia]], although it's also used in other areas for practicality and the ability to move it around.

Inattention, hyperactivity (restlessness in adults), disruptive behavior, and impulsivity are common in ADHD.&lt;ref name=ICSI2012&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Dobie C | title=Diagnosis and management of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in primary care for school-age children and adolescents | year=2012 | pages=79 | url=http://guidelines.gov/content.aspx?f=rss&amp;id=36812 | deadurl=yes | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130301124247/http://guidelines.gov/content.aspx?f=rss&amp;id=36812 | archive-date=1 March 2013 | df=dmy-all | journal=&amp;mdash; | access-date=10 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cdc2016facts/&gt; Academic difficulties are frequent as are problems with relationships.&lt;ref name=ICSI2012/&gt; The symptoms can be difficult to define, as it is hard to draw a line at where normal levels of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity end and significant levels requiring interventions begin.&lt;ref name =Ramsay25&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Ramsay JR | title=Cognitive behavioral therapy for adult ADHD | publisher=Routledge | year=2007 | isbn=978-0-415-95501-0 | pages=4, 25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the fifth version of the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'' ([[DSM-5]]), symptoms must be present for six months or more to a degree that is much greater than others of the [[age appropriate|same age]]&lt;ref name=DSM5/&gt; and they must cause significant problems functioning in at least two settings (e.g., social, school/work, or home).&lt;ref name=DSM5/&gt; The full criteria must have been met prior to age twelve in order to receive a diagnosis of ADHD.&lt;ref name=DSM5/&gt;

=== Subtypes ===
ADHD is divided into three subtypes: [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder predominantly inattentive|predominantly inattentive]] (ADHD-PI or ADHD-I), predominantly hyperactive-impulsive (ADHD-PH or ADHD-HI), and combined type (ADHD-C).&lt;ref name=DSM5/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ramsay25"/&gt;

A child with ADHD inattentive type has most or all of following symptoms, excluding situations where these symptoms are better explained by another psychiatric or medical condition:&lt;ref name=DSM5/&gt;&lt;ref name="NIMH1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder/complete-index.shtml |title=Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) |author=National Institute of Mental Health |year=2008 |publisher=National Institutes of Health |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130119030917/http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder/complete-index.shtml |archive-date=19 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Be easily distracted, miss details, forget things, and frequently switch from one activity to another
* Have difficulty maintaining focus on one task
* Become bored with a task after only a few minutes, unless doing something they find enjoyable
* Have difficulty focusing attention on organizing or completing a task 
* Have trouble completing or turning in homework assignments, often losing things (e.g., pencils, toys, assignments) needed to complete tasks or activities
* Appear not to be listening when spoken to
* Daydream, become easily confused, and move slowly
* Have difficulty processing information as quickly and accurately as others
* Struggle to follow instructions
* Have trouble understanding details; overlooks details

A child with ADHD hyperactive-impulsive type has most or all of the following symptoms, excluding situations where these symptoms are better explained by another psychiatric or medical condition:&lt;ref name=DSM5/&gt;&lt;ref name="NIMH1"/&gt;
* Fidget or squirm a great deal
* Talk nonstop
* Dash around, touching or playing with anything and everything in sight
* Have trouble sitting still during dinner, school, and while doing homework
* Be constantly in motion
* Have difficulty performing quiet tasks or activities
* Be impatient
* Blurt out inappropriate comments, show their emotions without restraint, and act without regard for consequences
* Have difficulty waiting for things they want or waiting their turn in games
* Often interrupt conversations or others' activities

Girls with ADHD tend to display fewer hyperactivity and impulsivity symptoms but more symptoms pertaining to inattention and distractability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gershon J | title = A meta-analytic review of gender differences in ADHD | journal = Journal of Attention Disorders | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 143–54 | date = January 2002 | pmid = 11911007 | doi = 10.1177/108705470200500302 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms of hyperactivity tend to go away with age and turn into "inner restlessness" in teens and adults with ADHD.&lt;ref name="Kooij-2010"/&gt;

People with ADHD of all ages are more likely to have problems with [[social skills]], such as social interaction and forming and maintaining friendships. This is true for all subtypes. About half of children and adolescents with ADHD experience social rejection by their peers compared to 10–15% of non-ADHD children and adolescents. People with attention deficits are prone to having difficulty processing verbal and nonverbal language which can negatively affect social interaction. They also may drift off during conversations, miss social cues, and have trouble learning social skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Coleman WL | title = Social competence and friendship formation in adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder | journal = Adolescent Medicine | volume = 19 | issue = 2 | pages = 278–99, x | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18822833 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
ADHD is diagnosed by an assessment of a child's behavioral and mental development, including ruling out the effects of drugs, medications and other medical or psychiatric problems as explanations for the symptoms.&lt;ref name=NICE2009-part2/&gt; It often takes into account feedback from parents and teachers&lt;ref name=Lake2011/&gt; with most diagnoses begun after a teacher raises concerns.&lt;ref name=Erk2009&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Mayes R, Bagwell C, Erkulwater JL | title=Medicating Children: ADHD and Pediatric Mental Health | publisher=Harvard University Press | date=2009 | pages=4–24 | isbn=978-0-674-03163-0 | edition=illustrated }}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be viewed as the extreme end of one or more continuous [[human trait]]s found in all people.&lt;ref name=NICE2009-Diagnosis/&gt; Whether someone responds to medications does not confirm or rule out the diagnosis.

In North America, DSM-5 criteria are used for diagnosis, while European countries usually use the ICD-10. With the DSM-IV criteria a diagnosis of ADHD is {{nowrap|3–4 times}} more likely than with the ICD-10 criteria.&lt;ref name="Singh" /&gt; It is classified as [[neurodevelopmental disorder|neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorder]].&lt;ref name=Caroline2010/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kooij-2010"/&gt; Additionally, it is classified as a [[disruptive behavior disorder]] along with [[oppositional defiant disorder]], [[conduct disorder]], and [[antisocial personality disorder]].&lt;ref name="google-book-ref"&gt;{{Cite book | vauthors=Wiener JM, Dulcan MK | title=Textbook Of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry | publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing | edition=illustrated | year=2004 | isbn=978-1-58562-057-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EIgGKcp0SpkC | access-date=2 November 2014 | deadurl=no | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506182138/https://books.google.com/books?id=EIgGKcp0SpkC | archive-date=6 May 2016 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A diagnosis does not imply a [[neurological disorder]].&lt;ref name="NICE 2009"/&gt;

===Diagnostic and Statistical Manual===
As with many other psychiatric disorders, formal diagnosis should be made by a qualified professional based on a set number of criteria. In the United States, these criteria are defined by the [[American Psychiatric Association]] in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]]. Based on the DSM criteria, there are three sub-types of ADHD:&lt;ref name=DSM5/&gt;&lt;ref name="CDC2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/diagnosis.html|title=ADHD: Symptoms and Diagnosis|last=|first=|date=2017-08-31|website=|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2017)|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# [[ADHD predominantly inattentive]] type (ADHD-PI) presents with symptoms including being easily distracted, forgetful, daydreaming, disorganization, poor concentration, and difficulty completing tasks.&lt;ref name=CDC/&gt;&lt;ref name=DSM5/&gt;
# ADHD, predominantly hyperactive-impulsive type presents with excessive fidgetiness and restlessness, hyperactivity, difficulty waiting and remaining seated, immature behavior; destructive behaviors may also be present.&lt;ref name="CDC" /&gt;&lt;ref name=DSM5/&gt;
# ADHD, combined type is a combination of the first two subtypes.&lt;ref name=CDC/&gt;&lt;ref name=DSM5/&gt;

This subdivision is based on presence of at least six out of nine long-term (lasting at least six months) symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity–impulsivity, or both.&lt;ref name="pmid23755024"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Steinau S | title = Diagnostic Criteria in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder - Changes in DSM 5 | journal = Frontiers in Psychiatry | volume = 4 | pages = 49 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23755024 | pmc = 3667245 | doi = 10.3389/fpsyt.2013.00049 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To be considered, the symptoms must have appeared by the age of six to twelve and occur in more than one environment (e.g. at home and at school or work).&lt;ref name=CDC/&gt; The symptoms must be [[Age-inappropriate|inappropriate]] for a child of that age&lt;ref name=CDC/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21991721"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Berger I | title = Diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: much ado about something | journal = The Israel Medical Association Journal | volume = 13 | issue = 9 | pages = 571–4 | date = September 2011 | pmid = 21991721 | doi =  | url = http://www.ima.org.il/FilesUpload/IMAJ/0/40/20032.pdf | format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; and there must be clear evidence that they are causing social, school or work related problems.&lt;ref name="pmid23755024"/&gt;

===International Classification of Diseases===
In the tenth revision of the [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]] ([[ICD-10]]) by the [[World Health Organization]], the symptoms of "[[hyperkinetic disorder]]" are analogous to ADHD in the DSM-5. When a [[conduct disorder]] (as defined by ICD-10)&lt;ref name=ICD10&gt;{{citation | title=International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision | year=2010 | publisher=World Health Organisation | access-date=2 November 2014 | chapter-url=http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2010/en#/F90 | chapter=F90 Hyperkinetic disorders | deadurl=no | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102133725/http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2010/en#/F90 | archive-date=2 November 2014 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; is present, the condition is referred to as ''hyperkinetic conduct disorder''. Otherwise, the disorder is classified as ''disturbance of activity and attention'', ''other hyperkinetic disorders'' or ''hyperkinetic disorders, unspecified''.  The latter is sometimes referred to as ''hyperkinetic syndrome''.&lt;ref name=ICD10/&gt;

In the implementation version of [[ICD-11]], the disorder is classified under 6A05 ''(Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder)'' and hyperkinetic disorder no longer exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ICD-11 - Mortality and Morbidity Statistics |url=https://icd.who.int/browse11/l-m/en#/http%3a%2f%2fid.who.int%2ficd%2fentity%2f821852937 |website=icd.who.int |access-date=23 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adults===

{{Main|Adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}}

Adults with ADHD are diagnosed under the same criteria, including that their signs must have been present by the age of six to twelve. Questioning parents or guardians as to how the person behaved and developed as a child may form part of the assessment; a family history of ADHD also adds weight to a diagnosis.&lt;ref name="Kooij-2010"/&gt; While the core symptoms of ADHD are similar in children and adults they often present differently in adults than in children, for example excessive physical activity seen in children may present as feelings of restlessness and constant mental activity in adults.&lt;ref name="Kooij-2010"/&gt;

It is estimated that between&amp;nbsp;2–5% of adults have ADHD.&lt;ref name="Kooij-2010"/&gt; Around 25–50% of children with ADHD continue to experience ADHD symptoms into adulthood, while the rest experiences fewer or no symptoms.&lt;ref name=DSM5/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kooij-2010"/&gt; Currently, most adults remain untreated.&lt;ref name="pmid21494335"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Culpepper L, Mattingly G | title = Challenges in identifying and managing attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in adults in the primary care setting: a review of the literature | journal = Primary Care Companion to the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 12 | issue = 6 | pages = PCC.10r00951 | year = 2010 | pmid = 21494335 | pmc = 3067998 | doi = 10.4088/PCC.10r00951pur }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many adults with ADHD without diagnosis and treatment have a disorganized life and some use non-prescribed drugs or alcohol as a coping mechanism.&lt;ref name="Art.218" /&gt; Other problems may include relationship and job difficulties, and an increased risk of criminal activities.&lt;ref name="Kooij-2010"/&gt; Associated mental health problems include: depression, [[anxiety disorder]], and [[learning disability|learning disabilities]].&lt;ref name="Art.218"/&gt;

Some ADHD symptoms in adults differ from those seen in children. While children with ADHD may climb and run about excessively, adults may experience an inability to relax, or they talk excessively in social situations. Adults with ADHD may start relationships impulsively, display sensation-seeking behavior, and be short-tempered. Addictive behavior such as [[substance abuse]] and gambling are common. The DSM-V criteria do specifically deal with adults, unlike those in DSM-IV, which were criticized for not being appropriate for adults; those who presented differently may lead to the claim that they outgrew the diagnosis.&lt;ref name="Kooij-2010"/&gt;

With widely differing rates of diagnosis across countries, states within countries, races, and ethnicities, some suspect factors other than the presence of the symptoms of ADHD are playing a role in diagnosis.&lt;ref name="Elder-2010"/&gt; Some sociologists consider ADHD to be an example of the [[medicalization]] of deviant behavior, that is, the turning of the previously {{nowrap|non-medical}} issue of school performance into a medical one.&lt;ref name="Parrillo 2008 63"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Erk2009/&gt; Most healthcare providers accept ADHD as a genuine disorder, at least in the small number of people with severe symptoms.&lt;ref name=Erk2009/&gt; Among healthcare providers the debate mainly centers on diagnosis and treatment in the much greater number of people with mild symptoms.&lt;ref name="Online"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schonwald" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Erk2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT2013/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Merten EC, Cwik JC, Margraf J, Schneider S | title = Overdiagnosis of mental disorders in children and adolescents (in developed countries) | journal = Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Mental Health | volume = 11 | pages = 5 | date = 2017 | pmid = 28105068 | pmc = 5240230 | doi = 10.1186/s13034-016-0140-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Taylor E | title = Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: overdiagnosed or diagnoses missed? | journal = Archives of Disease in Childhood | volume = 102 | issue = 4 | pages = 376–379 | date = April 2017 | pmid = 27821518 | doi = 10.1136/archdischild-2016-310487 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Beethoven's Christmas Adventure'' (2011)===
This story is narrated by John Cleese, who tells of the story of Beethoven's Christmas adventure. At the North Pole, Santa is giving out jobs to over 200 new elves. One of the elves, Henry, is assigned the job as a stable elf by taking care of the reindeer. Henry objects, claiming that the job as a stable elf is unclean, but Santa didn't change his mind. Henry tried making a toy one night in order to prove Santa Wrong but Henry got zapped by his own creation and inadvertently fed the magic berries to the reindeer which in turn began to fly away with the sleigh, with Henry inside it. During the flight, Henry loses Santa's toy bag.

In Wood haven Minnesota, Mason Cooper is unsuccessfully trying to sell hot chocolate his mother Christine stops by and asks her son to watch Beethoven. Beethoven was going to star in the Christmas parade and Christine was assigned by her boss Mr. Rexford to create a Hollywood themed float for the parade. While Mason was babysitting him Beethoven sees Santa's sleigh with Henry in it flying over the town and he follows the sleigh. He and Mason find Henry who evicted himself from the sleigh. Henry asks Mason for help in finding Santa's toy bag. At first Mason doesn't believe Henry is a real Christmas elf and that Santa wasn't real until he witnessed Henry communicating with Beethoven with a magic candy that when licked can give the human the ability to communicate with dogs.

Elsewhere, grumpy Sylvester Smirch is the owner of a toy store called Most Wanted Toys he and his assistant Kenny had been secretly stealing toys from other stores then overpricing the stolen toys. While driving on the highway. Smirch comes across Santa's Toy Bag and only realizes what it is after pulling out several toys from it to see them increase to full size. Before leaving with the toy bag Smirch is witnessed by a stray whose foot was stuck to an old mattress.

Back at The Cooper household Henry lies to Mason saying that he is a Christmas elf, one that makes toys. Christine returns home and evicts Henry because she didn't believe that he was a real Christmas elf. Mason secretly lets Henry spend the night in the Garage.

The next morning Henry and Beethoven leave to find the magic toy sack. Henry had a piece of fabric that ripped off of the bag which Beethoven used its scent to try to sniff out the bag's location. Mason leaves shortly after to find Henry and Beethoven after discovering that they were gone.

Mr. Smirch and Kenny decide to advertise with the toy bag but during the commercial they are interrupted by the presence of Henry and Beethoven Smirch flees with the toy bag and is picked up by Kenny shortly after thus, Henry fails to get a visual on Smirch.

Mason comes across the stray and frees his foot from the mattress the stray follows Mason and they meet up with Henry and Beethoven. The stray then reveals to Henry that he got a good visual of Smirch. They return to the garage in the Cooper's house. And while sketching out a drawing of Smirch from the stray's description Henry accidentally sets a model of Beethoven's parade float on fire. Mason is blamed for it by Christine who refuses to believe her son that Henry did it. she then grounds Mason forbidding him to leave the house until New Year's.

Mason fails to recognize the sketch drawing of Mr. Smirch and Henry reveals to Mason about being a Stable Elf, and explains to Mason about wanting to make toys like his fellow elves but Mason reassures Henry thinking that being a stable elf is better than making toys. That night Mason, Henry, Beethoven and the stray are awoken to see Smirch's TV Ad. They are overjoyed that they know who was in possession of the toy bag.

Because Mason was forbidden to leave the house Henry, Beethoven and the stray entered the Toy store alone during business hours and Henry tries to convince the patrons that the toys were from Santa's toy bag and that Smirch had stolen them. Smirch kicks Henry out of the store. Henry then distracts smirch and Kenny by singing with a group of Christmas carolers. While Beethoven and the stray steal the bag. This fails as Henry is exposed for singing off-key and he is arrested for trying to steal Santa's toy bag. The stray is taken back to the shelter for biting Smirch forcing Beethoven to return to Mason.

Beethoven then persuades Christine to lick the Dog Candy Cane and insists to her that Mason was telling the truth the whole time. Believing that this was happening, Christine apologizes to Mason explaining that she felt scared about taking care of him by herself after her husband passed away the previous year. They go the police station but learn from the chief that Smirch decided not to press charges on Henry.

Mason Beethoven and Christine arrive at the store and learn that Smirch is kidnapping Henry after Henry had revealed to Smirch that the elves made enough toys in the bag for one year. Smirch believes that Henry is a toy-making elf and kidnaps him to receive more income. Smirch stuffs Henry in the toy bag and he and Kenny flee on Motorcycles to the park where the parade's floats are being worked on. Smirch crashes onto the Beethoven float and is trapped in a large plastic Christmas ornament. Smirch is then arrested for toy theft.

Mason then helps his mother get the promotion that she was working to achieve by adding a partnership with the ASPCA and invites the dogs from the shelter to ride with Beethoven in the parade. Late that evening Henry thanks Mason for showing him that being a stable elf is something very special. Mason thanks Henry for helping him realize that believing in Santa "is not a kid thing." using the power of the magic berries Beethoven flies Henry back to the north pole with the toy bag in a sleigh. And Mason decides to keep the stray and names him Henry. In the end, Santa makes his deliveries and gives Beethoven a ride home.

[[File:Bharat Mata.jpg|right|thumb|''Bharat Mata'' by [[Abanindranath Tagore]] (1871-1951), a nephew of the poet [[Rabindranath Tagore]], and a pioneer of the movement]]
The '''Bengal School of Art''' commonly referred as '''Bengal School''',&lt;ref name=ngma/&gt; was an [[art movement]] and a style of [[Indian painting]] that originated in [[Bengal]], primarily [[Kolkata]] and [[Shantiniketan]], and flourished throughout [[India]] during the [[British Raj]] in the early 20th century. Also known as 'Indian style of painting' in its early days, it was associated with [[Indian nationalism]] ([[swadeshi]]) and led by [[Abanindranath Tagore]] (1871-1951), but was also promoted and supported by British arts administrators like [[Ernest Binfield Havell|E. B. Havell]], the principal of the [[Government College of Art, Kolkata]] from 1896; eventually it led to the development of the [[modern Indian painting]].&lt;ref name=ngma/&gt;&lt;ref name=benartmitter&gt;{{cite book |title=Art and nationalism in colonial India, 1850-1922: occidental orientations |last=Mitter |first=Partha |authorlink= |author2= |year= 1994|publisher= Cambridge University Press|location= Cambridge, UK|isbn=978-0-521-44354-8 |chapter=How the past was salvaged by Swadeshi artists |pages=267–306 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9mRTtkri8E0C |accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=benartatlas&gt;{{cite book |title=Atlas of world art |last=Onians |first=John |authorlink= |author2= |year= 2004|publisher=Laurence King Publishing |location=London |isbn=978-1-85669-377-6 |page= 304|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O3h2KfXoOPYC |accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Culture of Bengal}}
The Bengal school arose as an [[avant garde]] and nationalist movement reacting against the [[academic art]] styles previously promoted in India, both by Indian artists such as [[Raja Ravi Varma]] and in British art schools. Following the influence of Indian spiritual ideas in the [[Western world|West]], the British art teacher [[Ernest Binfield Havell]] attempted to reform the teaching methods at the [[Calcutta School of Art]] by encouraging students to imitate [[Mughal painting|Mughal]] miniatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitter|first=Partha |title=Indian art |url=https://books.google.com/?id=FHxsDV1GDOIC&amp;pg=PA177&amp;lpg=PA177&amp;dq=Ernest+Binfield+Havell+education#v=onepage&amp;q=Ernest%20Binfield%20Havell%20education&amp;f=false|year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-284221-8|page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ny"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/20/arts/design/20bose.html|title=Art Review: Indian Modernism via an Eclectic and Elusive Artist|last=Cotter|first=Holland|date=August 19, 2008|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused controversy, leading to a strike by students and complaints from the local press, including from nationalists who considered it to be a retrogressive move. Havell was supported by the artist [[Abanindranath Tagore]], a nephew of the poet [[Rabindranath Tagore]]. Tagore painted a number of works influenced by [[Mughal painting|Mughal art]], a style that he and Havell believed to be expressive of India's distinct spiritual qualities, as opposed to the "materialism" of the West. Tagore's best-known painting, ''Bharat Mata'' (Mother India), depicted a young woman, portrayed with four arms in the manner of Hindu deities, holding objects symbolic of India's national aspirations. Tagore later attempted to develop links with Japanese artists as part of an aspiration to construct a [[pan-Asianism|pan-Asianist]] model of art. Through the paintings of 'Bharat Mata', Abanindranath established the pattern of patriotism. Painters and artists of Bengal school were [[Nandalal Bose]], M.A.R Chughtai, [[Sunayani Devi]] (sister of Abanindranath Tagore), [[Manishi Dey]], [[Mukul Dey]], [[Kalipada Ghoshal]], [[Asit Kumar Haldar]], [[Sudhir Khastgir]], Kshitindranath Majumdar, [[Sughra Rababi]], [[D. P. Roy Choudhury|Debi Prasad Roychoudhury]], Bireswar Sen, [[Beohar Rammanohar Sinha]], Kiron Sinha,TP [[Gaganendranath Tagore]] (Tagore's brother)

The Bengal school's influence in India declined with the spread of [[modernist]] ideas in the 1920s. {{As of|2012}}, there has been a surge in interest in the Bengal school of art among scholars and connoisseurs.&lt;ref name=benarttoi&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-02-12/special-report/31051756_1_bengal-school-bengal-art-bengal-masters| title=For many art lovers, it's back to the old school| last=Ghose | first=Archana Khare |newspaper=Times of India| location=New Delhi|date=12 February 2012|accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
However, Bengal continues to produce some of the best artists of modern India. There is a department in the Government College Of Art &amp; Craft that has been training students the traditional style of tempera and wash painting for almost a century now. These students are carrying the legacy of the Bengal School artists, who, initially, were a group of artists, following Abanindranath's style and sharing his aesthetic vision. Among them, Dhirendranath Brahma is the living legend of the Bengal School of Art. He is a master of calligraphy and has innumerable students who are carrying on the tradition of Bengal School of painting. Among the other renowned artists of this style of painting are Ajoy Ghosh, Sankarlal Aich, Amal Chaklader, Narendranath De Sarkar, Sukti Subhra Pradhan &amp; Ratan Acharya. 
Some of the best known artists of present-day Bengal are [[Jogen Chowdhury]], [[Mrinal Kanti Das]], [[Gopal Sanyal]], [[Ganesh Pyne]], [[Manishi Dey]], [[Shanu Lahiri]], Ganesh Haloi &lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite news|title=Shanu Lahiri dead|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1130202/jsp/calcutta/story_16510654.jsp#.UUISlTeEnuo|newspaper=The Telegraph (Calcutta)|accessdate=March 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jahar Dasgupta]], Samir Aich, [[Bikash Bhattacharjee]], Sudip Roy, Ramananda Bandopadhyay and  [[Devajyoti Ray]].
Sanat Chatterjee is one of the last living pioneers of Bengal School of art. He studied under Asit Kumar Haldar for around fifteen years.

==R. Siva Kumar's disagreement ==
{{main article|Santiniketan: The Making of a Contextual Modernism}}
[[R. Siva Kumar]], who has been studying the work of the Santiniketan masters and their approach to art since the early 80s, refutes the practice of subsuming [[Nandalal Bose]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Ram Kinker Baij]] and [[Benode Behari Mukherjee]] under the '''Bengal School of Art'''. According to Siva Kumar, 'This happened because early writers were guided by genealogies of apprenticeship rather than their styles, worldviews, and perspectives on art practice'.&lt;ref&gt;http://humanitiesunderground.org/all-the-shared-experiences-of-the-lived-world-ii/&lt;/ref&gt;

His ideas on this issue are formulated in the catalogue essay of the exhibition [[Santiniketan: The Making of a Contextual Modernism]].

The virtual mobility part of blended mobility is mostly supported through the use of information and communication technologies (e.g. [[Skype]], [[Adobe Connect]], [[Slack (software)|Slack]], [[Google Hangout]], [[Trello]]) to stay connected with the teachers and/or students who may be situated at many distant locations. The physical mobility part is typically of short-term duration, ranging from 2 to 14 days. There may exist multiple periods of short-term mobility. Short periods of physical mobility enable participants to focus for a couple of days only on the actual project, which is difficult in daily life in a local environment.&lt;ref name="impact"&gt;P. Purg; K. Sirok; D. Brasil (2016)[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/jade.12101 
 The Transformative Impact of Blended Mobility Courses]&lt;/ref&gt;

Early applications of a blended mobility format can be found back in 2009.&lt;ref name="mutw"&gt;
N.F. Escudeiro; P.M. Escudeiro, [https://www.iospress.nl/book/multinational-undergraduate-team-work Multinational Undergraduate Team Work, Excellence in International Capstone Projects]&lt;/ref&gt; Through this project an environment was created which encourages the development of students’ soft skills, such as teamwork and communication, in an international setting by means of an innovative instruction paradigm to improve such skills without expensive and extensive curricular changes.

The blended mobility paradigm may be executed through various formats.&lt;ref name="baim" /&gt;&lt;ref name="adriart" /&gt;

Blended mobility is also seen and recognised by the [https://eacea.ec.europa.eu/[[European Commission]]] as a preparation for the long-term physical mobility or as complementing regular study programmes.&lt;ref&gt; F. Maltauro; J. Anderson, [https://eacea.ec.europa.eu/sites/eacea-site/files/6_higher_eudcqtion.pdf Presentation: Digital within the Renewed EU Agenda for Higher Education] (visited June 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Digital Education Action Plan of the [[European Commission]] (January 2018) it is stated that blended mobility will be further promoted with new opportunities in [[Erasmus+]] to support both online and face-to-face learning and student exchange in different countries.&lt;ref&gt;
European Commission, [https://ec.europa.eu/education/sites/education/files/digital-education-action-plan.pdf Communication from the commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the regions on the Digital Education Action Plan] (visited July 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Blended mobility is an educational concept that combines virtual mobility through the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) and short-term physical mobility. 

The goal of this methodology is to obtain similar benefits as those gained with physical mobility but with less barriers.

'''Bolak''' is a constructed language that was invented by [[Léon Bollack]]. The name of the language means both "blue language" and "ingenious creation" in the language itself.

==History==
Bollack wrote three books on this language: ''La Langue Bleue Bolak: langue internationale pratique'' (1899), ''Abridged Grammar of the Blue Language'' (1900) and ''Premier vocabulaire de la langue bleue Bolak'' (1902).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Bolak History| url=http://www.langmaker.com/bolakhistory.htm| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626105047/http://www.langmaker.com/bolakhistory.htm| archivedate=2008-06-26| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bollack caught the attention of [[H.G. Wells]], who wrote in ''[[A Modern Utopia]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The language of Utopia will no doubt be one and indivisible; all mankind will, in the measure of their individual differences in quality, be brought into the same phase, into a common resonance of thought, but the language they will speak will still be a living tongue, an animated system of imperfections, which every individual man will infinitesimally modify. Through the universal freedom of exchange and movement, the developing change in its general spirit will be a world-wide change; that is the quality of its universality. I fancy it will be a coalesced language, a synthesis of many. Such a language as English is a coalesced language; it is a coalescence of Anglo-Saxon and Norman French and Scholar's Latin, welded into one speech more ample and more powerful and beautiful than either. The Utopian tongue might well present a more spacious coalescence, and hold in the frame of such an uninflected or slightly inflected idiom as English already presents, a profuse vocabulary into which have been cast a dozen once separate tongues, superposed and then welded together through bilingual and trilingual compromises. [Footnote: Vide an excellent article, La Langue Française en l'an 2003, par Leon Bollack, in La Revue, 15 Juillet, 1903.] In the past ingenious men have speculated on the inquiry, “Which language will survive?” The question was badly put. I think now that this wedding and survival of several in a common offspring is a far more probable thing.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite the attention of Wells and money invested by Bollack, the language gained no adherents, and Bollack went on to support [[Ido (language)|Ido]], according to [[Otto Jespersen]], writing in 1912 in ''The History of our Language'' about a conference that had taken place in 1907:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The inventors of language systems had been invited to attend either in person or by representative to defend their systems. This offer was availed of by Dr. Nicolas ([[Spokil]]), Mr. Spitzer (Parla) and Mr. Bollack (La langue bleue); moreover [[L. L. Zamenhof|Dr. Zamenhof]] got himself represented by [[Louis de Beaufront|Mr. de Beaufront]], who had been propagating Esperanto for many years; and almost as representative of Neutral came Mr. Monseur, professor of comparative philology in Brussels: yet his plea had the character less of a positive defence of Neutral than of a zealous and expert insistence on the weaknesses of [[Esperanto]]. Of the discussions with those outside the committee two episodes deserve special mention: Dr. Nicolas emphasised as an advantage of his system founded on "a priori" principles, that it was constructed in accordance with a firm grasp of the laws of mnemonics and therefore was especially easy to remember. Yet he was almost offended when I wished to begin examining him about his own dictionary, and so it appeared that he could not remember the words which he himself had made. Mr. Bollack in a very elegant discourse presented his Langue bleue for the diffusion of which he had devoted a great deal of money; he ended by declaring that although he wished naturally that his language should be adopted, he would nevertheless accept the verdict of the committee of experts if it went otherwise; this promise he has kept loyally by being now an eminent member of the [[Ido (language)|Ido]] organization in Paris.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Alphabet and pronunciation==

Bolak uses a modified [[Latin alphabet]] with 19 letters:

A, B, Ч, D, E, F, G, I, K, L, M, N, O, P, R, S, T, U, V.

Ч is taken from [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] and has the sound of English ch. Other letters are pronounced as in French.

==Grammar==

Bolak is a mixed language, whose grammar is mostly [[A priori (languages)|''a priori'']] while the vocabulary  is [[A posteriori (languages)|''a posteriori'']]. It is also an [[agglutinative language]], much like [[Esperanto]] but while Esperanto uses agglutination mainly logically, Bolak uses it mainly emotionally.

The [[Lord's Prayer]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Nea per ev seri in sil!&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The numbers 1–10:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
ven, dov, ter, far, kel, gab, чep, lok, nif, dis.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

What an immense advantage for mankind, if from people to people we could communicate through the same language.

[[File:Jan Vermeer - The Art of Painting - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[The Art of Painting (Vermeer)|The Art of Painting]]'' by [[Jan Vermeer]]]]
In the [[visual arts]], '''composition''' is the placement or arrangement of visual elements or 'ingredients' in a work of art, as distinct from the subject. It can also be thought of as the organization of the [[elements of art]] according to the [[principles of art]].

The composition of a picture is different from its subject, what is depicted, whether a moment from a story, a person or a place.  Many subjects, for example [[Saint George and the Dragon]], are often portrayed in art, but using a great range of compositions even though the two figures are typically the only ones shown.   

The term composition means 'putting together' and can apply to any work of art, from music to writing to photography, that is arranged using conscious thought. In the visual arts, composition is often used interchangeably with various terms such as ''design, form, visual ordering,'' or ''formal structure,'' depending on the context. In [[graphic design]] for press and [[desktop publishing]], composition is commonly referred to as [[page layout]].

==Elements of design==
{{Main|Elements of art}}

The various visual elements, known as ''elements of design'', ''formal elements'', or ''elements of art,'' constitute the vocabulary with which the visual artist composes. These elements in the overall design usually relate to each other and to the whole art work.

The elements of design are:
*Line — the visual path that enables the eye to move within the piece
*[[Shape]] — areas defined by edges within the piece, whether geometric or organic
*[[Color]] — hues with their various values and intensities
*[[Texture (visual arts)|Texture]] — surface qualities which translate into tactile illusions
*[[Lightness (color)|Value]] — Shading used to emphasize form 
*Form — 3-D length, width, or depth 
*[[Space]] — the space taken up by (positive) or in between (negative) objects


===Line and shape===
Lines are optical phenomena that allow the artist to direct the eye of the viewer. The optical illusion of lines do exist in nature and visual arts elements can be arranged to create this illusion. The viewer unconsciously reads near continuous arrangement of different elements and subjects at varying distances. Such elements can be of dramatic use in the composition of the image. These could be literal lines such as telephone and power cables or rigging on boats. Lines can derive also from the borders of areas of differing color or contrast, or sequences of discrete elements. Movement is also a source of line, and blur can also create a reaction.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Subject lines contribute to both mood and [[linear perspective]], giving the viewer the illusion of depth. Oblique lines convey a sense of movement and angular lines generally convey a sense of dynamism and possibly tension. Lines can also direct attention towards the main subject of picture, or contribute to organization by dividing it into compartments. The artist may exaggerate or create lines perhaps as part of their message to the viewer. Many lines without a clear subject point suggest chaos in the image and may conflict with the mood the artist is trying to evoke.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Straight left lines create different moods and add affection to visual arts. A line's angle and its relationship to the size of the frame influence the mood of the image.  Horizontal lines, commonly found in [[landscape photography]], can give the impression of calm, tranquility, and space. An image filled with strong vertical lines tends to have the impression of height and grandeur. Tightly angled convergent lines give a dynamic, lively, and active effect to the image. Strongly angled, almost [[diagonal]] lines produce tension in the image. The viewpoint of visual art is very important because every different perspective views different angled lines. This change of perspective elicits a different response to the image. By changing the perspective only by some degrees or some centimetres lines in images can change tremendously and a totally different feeling can be transported. Straight lines are also strongly influenced by tone, color, and repetition in relation to the rest of the image.

Compared to straight lines, curves provide a greater dynamic influence in a picture. They are also generally more aesthetically pleasing, as the viewer associates them with softness. In photography, curved lines can give graduated shadows when paired with soft-directional lighting, which usually results in a very harmonious line structure within the image.

===Color===
There are three properties of color. Hue, brightness, and value. Hue is simply the name of a color, (red, yellow, and blue, etc.) Brightness refers to the intensity and strength of the color. The lightness and darkness to a color is the value. Color also has the ability to work within our emotions. Given that, we can use color to create mood. It can also be used as tone, pattern, light, movement, symbol, form, harmony, and contrast. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Esaak|first1=Shelley|title=What is the Definition of Color in Art?|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/definition-of-color-in-art-182429|website=ThoughtCo.|accessdate=March 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Element of Design: Color|url=http://www.wcs.k12.mi.us/cousino/wcsart/art%20foundatons%20site/color.html|website=Art Foundations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Texture===
Texture refers to how an object feels or how it looks like it may feel if it were touched. There are two ways we experience texture, physically and optically. Different techniques can be used to create physical texture, which allows qualities of visual art to be seen and felt. This can include surfaces such as metal, sand, and wood. Optical texture is when the illusion of physical texture is created. Photography, paintings, and drawings use visual texture to create a more realistic appearance. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Visual Elements|url=http://www.artyfactory.com/art_appreciation/visual-elements/texture.html|website=Artyfactory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Value===
Lightness and darkness is what creates value in visual art. Value deals with how light reflects off of objects and how we see it. The more light, the higher the value. White is the highest or lightest value while black is the lowest or darkest value. Colors also have value, for example, yellow has a high value while blue has a low value. This is a very important element of design, especially in painting and drawing, to be able to create the illusion of light with contrast. Contrast is needed to understand two-dimensional artwork. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fussell|first1=Matt|title=The Elements of Art-"Value"|url=http://thevirtualinstructor.com/Value.html|website=The Virtual Instructor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Form===
The term form can mean different things in visual art. Form suggests a three-dimensional object in space. It is also described as the physical nature of the artwork, such as sculptures. It can also be looked at as art form, which can be expressed through fine art. A form encloses volume, has length, width, and height, unlike a shape, which is only two-dimensional. Forms that are mathematical, a sphere, pyramid, cube, cylinder, and cone, are known as geometric forms. Organic forms are typically irregular and asymmetrical. This form can be found in nature, such as flowers, rocks, trees, etc., but can also be seen in architecture. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marder|first1=Lisa|title=What Does the Term 'Form' Mean in Regards to Art?|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/definition-of-form-in-art-182437|website=ThoughtCo.|accessdate=January 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forms in drawing and painting convey the illusion of three-dimensional form through lighting, shadows, value, and tone.  The more contrast in value, the more pronounced the three-dimensional form is. Forms with little value appear flatter than those with greater variation and contrast.

===Space===
Space is the area around, above, and within an object. Photographers can capture space, architects build space, and painters create space. This element is found in each of the visual arts. It can be positive or negative, open or closed, shallow or deep, and two-dimensional or three-dimensional. In drawing or painting, space is not actually there, but the illusion of it is. Positive space is the subject of the piece. The empty spaces around, above, and within, is negative space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Esaak|first1=Shelley|title=Exploring the Spaces Between and Within Us|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/definition-of-space-in-art-182464|website=ThoughtCo.|accessdate=February 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Space?|url=https://www.sophia.org/tutorials/elements-of-art-space|website=Sophia|publisher=Sophia Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles of organization==
{{Main|Principles of art}}

The artist determines what the center of interest (focus in [[photography]]) of the art work will be, and composes the elements accordingly. The gaze of the viewer will then tend to linger over these points of interest, elements are arranged with consideration of several factors (known variously as the ''principles of organization, principles of art,'' or ''principles of design'') into a harmonious whole which works together to produce the desired statement – a phenomenon commonly referred to as '''unity.''' Such factors in composition should not be confused with the elements of art (or elements of [[design]]) themselves. For example, shape is an ''element''; the usage of shape is characterized by various ''principles.''

Some principles of organization affecting the composition of a picture are:
* Shape and proportion
* Positioning/orientation/balance/[[harmony]] among the elements
* The area within the [[field of view]] used for the picture ("[[cropping]]")
* The path or direction followed by the viewer's eye when they observe the image.
* Negative space
* Color
* Contrast: the value, or degree of lightness and darkness, used within the picture.
* Arrangement: for example, use of the [[golden section|golden mean]] or the [[rule of thirds]]
* [[Composition (visual arts)#Line and shape|Lines]]
* Rhythm
* Illumination or [[lighting]]
* Repetition (sometimes building into pattern; rhythm also comes into play, as does geometry)
* [[Perspective (graphical)|Perspective]]
* Breaking the rules can create tension or unease, yet it can add interest to the picture if used carefully

===Viewpoint (leading with the eye)===
The position of the viewer can strongly influence the aesthetics of an image, even if the subject is entirely imaginary and viewed "within the mind's eye". Not only does it influence the elements within the picture, but it also influences the viewer's interpretation of the subject.

For example, if a boy is photographed from above, perhaps from the eye level of an adult, he is diminished in stature.  A photograph taken at the child's level would treat him as an equal, and one taken from below could result in an impression of dominance. Therefore, the photographer is choosing the viewer's positioning.

A subject can be rendered more dramatic when it fills the frame. There exists a tendency to perceive things as larger than they actually are, and filling the frame full fills this psychological mechanism. This can be used to eliminate distractions from the background.

In photography, altering the position of the camera can change the image so that the subject has fewer or more distractions with which to compete. This may be achieved by getting closer, moving laterally, tilting, panning, or moving the camera vertically.

==Compositional techniques==
There are numerous approaches or "compositional techniques" to achieve a sense of unity within an artwork, depending on the goals of the artist. For example, a work of art is said to be aesthetically pleasing to the eye if the elements within the work are arranged in a balanced compositional way.&lt;ref name="Dunstan"&gt;Dunstan, Bernard. (1979). ''Composing Your Paintings''. London, Studio Vista.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are artists such as [[Salvador Dalí]] who aim to disrupt traditional composition and challenge the viewer to rethink balance and design elements within art works.

Conventional composition can be achieved with a number of techniques:

===Rule of thirds===
{{Main|Rule of thirds}}
The rule of thirds is a composition guide that states that arranging the important features of an image on or near the horizontal and vertical lines that would divide the image into thirds horizontally and vertically is visually pleasing. The objective is to stop the subject(s) and areas of interest (such as the horizon) from bisecting the image, by placing them near one of the lines that would divide the image into three equal columns and rows, ideally near the intersection of those lines.

[[Image:Rule of thirds photo.jpg|thumb|400px|center|Rule of thirds: Note how the horizon falls close to the bottom grid line, and how the dark areas are in the left third, the overexposed in the right third.]]

The rule of thirds is thought to be a simplification of the [[golden ratio]]. The golden ratio is thought to have been used by artists throughout history as a composition guide, but [[Mathematics and art#Golden ratio|there is little evidence to support this claim]].

===Rule of odds===

The "rule of odds" suggests that an odd number of subjects in an image is more interesting than an even number. Thus if you have more than one subject in your picture, the suggestion is to choose an arrangement with at least three subjects. An even number of subjects produces symmetries in the image, which can appear less natural for a naturalistic, informal composition.

An image of a person surrounded/framed by two other persons, for instance, where the person in the center is the object of interest in that image/artwork, is more likely to be perceived as friendly and comforting by the viewer, than an image of a single person with no significant surroundings.

===Rule of space===
{{Main|Lead room}}
The rule of space applies to artwork (photography, advertising, illustration) picturing object(s) to which the artist wants to apply the illusion of movement, or which is supposed to create a contextual bubble in the viewer's mind.

This can be achieved, for instance, by leaving [[White space (visual arts)|white space]] in the direction the eyes of a portrayed person are looking, or, when picturing a runner, adding white space in front of him rather than behind him to indicate movement.

===Simplification===
Images with clutter can distract from the main elements within the picture and make it difficult to identify the subject.  By decreasing the extraneous content, the viewer is more likely to focus on the primary objects. Clutter can also be reduced through the use of lighting, as the brighter areas of the image tend to draw the eye, as do lines, squares and colour. In painting, the artist may use less detailed and defined brushwork towards the edges of the picture.Removing the elements to the focus of the object, taking only the needed components.

====Shallow depth of field====
In photography, and also (via software simulation of real lens limitations) in [[3D graphics]], one approach to achieving simplification is to use a wide aperture when shooting to limit the [[depth of field]].  When used properly in the right setting, this technique can place everything that is not the subject of the photograph out of focus.

{| align="center"
|valign="top"|[[Image:Jonquil flowers at f5.jpg|center|250px|thumb|The blurred background focuses the eye on the flowers.]]
|valign="top"|[[Image:Jonquil flowers at f32.jpg|center|250px|thumb|At a smaller aperture, the background competes for the viewer’s attention.]]
|}

A similar approach, given the right equipment, is to take advantage of the [[Scheimpflug principle]] to change the plane of focus.

===Geometry and symmetry===
[[Image:Composition with cloud.JPG|thumb|150px|right|A simple composition with cloud and rooftop that creates asymmetry.]]
Related to the rule of odds is the observation that triangles are an aesthetically pleasing implied shape within an image. In a [[Aesthetic canon|canonically]] attractive face, the mouth and eyes fall within the corners of the area of an equilateral triangle. [[Paul Cézanne]] successfully used triangles in his compositions of [[still life]]s. A triangular format creates a sense of stability and strength.

===Creating movement===
It is generally thought to be more pleasing to the viewer if the image encourages the eye to move around the image, rather than immediately fixating on a single place or no place in particular. Artists will often strive to avoid creating compositions that feel "static" or "flat" by incorporating movement into the image. In image A the 2 mountains are equally sized and positioned beside each other creating a very static and uninteresting image. In image B the mountains are differently sized and one is placed closer to the horizon, guiding the eye to move from one mountain to the other creating a more interesting and pleasing image. This also feels more natural because in nature objects are rarely the same size and evenly spaced. 
[[File:ImageA.jpg|thumb|alt=Two identical green triangles with the text "Image A" under them, all on a white background|Image A]]
[[File:ImageB.jpg|thumb|Image B]]

===Other techniques===
* There should be a center of interest or focus in the work, to prevent it becoming a pattern in itself
* The direction followed by the viewer's eye should lead the viewer's gaze around all elements in the work before leading out of the picture
* The subject should not be facing out of the image
* Exact bisections of the picture space should be avoided
* Small, high contrast, elements have as much impact as larger, duller elements
* The prominent subject should be off-centre, unless a symmetrical or formal composition is desired, and can be balanced by smaller satellite elements
* The horizon line should not divide the art work in two equal parts but be positioned to emphasize either the sky or ground; showing more sky if painting is of clouds, sun rise/set, and more ground if a landscape
*Use of detailed areas and 'rest' areas can help to aid the eye in where to look. Creating a contrast between detail and lack of detail is important
These principles ''can'' be means of a good composition yet they ''cannot'' be applied separately but should act together to form a good composition.
*Also in an artwork, it is suggested that no spaces between the objects should be the same to create a more interesting image.

==Example==
These paintings all show the same subject, the [[Raising of Lazarus]], and essentially the same figures, but have very different compositions:

&lt;gallery widths="200px" heights="200px" perrow="4"&gt;

'''''De Verborum Significatione''''', fully '''''Twenty Books on the Meaning of Words''''' ({{lang-la|De Verborum Significatione Libri XX}}) and also known as '''''De Verborum Signficatu'''''&lt;ref name=glinisternorthwoods/&gt;&lt;ref name=lesenluminures/&gt; and '''''The Lexicon of Festus''''',&lt;ref name=project/&gt; is an [[epitome]] compiled, edited, and annotated by [[Sextus Pompeius Festus]] from the [[encyclopedia|encyclopedic]] works of [[Verrius Flaccus]]. Festus's epitome is typically dated to the 2nd century,&lt;ref name=kaster/&gt; but the work only survives in a partial 11th-century manuscript and copies of its own separate epitome.

==Background==
Verrius Flaccus {{nowrap|(c. 55 BCE –}} {{nowrap|c. 20 CE)}} was a prominent [[Ancient Romans|Roman]] [[Grammarian (Greco-Roman world)|grammarian]] known for his writings on the [[Latin language]] and for tutoring the grandsons of [[Caesar Augustus]] during his reign.&lt;ref name=lesenluminures/&gt;&lt;ref name=glinisterreview/&gt; He is best known for ''De verborum significatu'', the name which Festus later adopted for his epitome, the first major alphabetical Latin [[dictionary]].&lt;ref name=lesenluminures/&gt;&lt;ref name=glinisterreview/&gt; The 40-volume [[lexicon]] is regarded as among the most important such works of [[Classical Antiquity]], though all but a few fragments of the original have been lost, perhaps in part due to its impractical size.&lt;ref name=lesenluminures/&gt;&lt;ref name=project/&gt;&lt;ref name=kaster/&gt;&lt;ref name=glinisterreview/&gt;

Sextus Pompeius Festus, also a grammarian, likely flourished in the later 2nd century and is thought to have come from [[Narbo]] in [[Gaul]], though few details are known about his life.&lt;ref name=glinisternorthwoods/&gt;&lt;ref name=glinisterreview/&gt; Festus wrote his epitome of Flaccus's works during a time in the [[history of the Roman Empire]] when greater priority was placed on defense after a long period of expansion. There was an anxious effort by many scholars to record their history and culture as means of preservation.&lt;ref name=project/&gt;&lt;ref name=brown/&gt; Though another of Festus's books is mentioned in ''De Verborum Significatione'', none of his other works have survived.&lt;ref name=glinisternorthwoods/&gt;

Festus's work originally contained 20 volumes.&lt;ref name=kaster/&gt; The only surviving copy is the ''Codex Farnesianus'', an 11th-century copy in poor condition, missing the first half of its alphabetized entries and suffering fire damage.&lt;ref name=project/&gt;&lt;ref name=glinisterreview/&gt; Much of what we know about it comes a summary of the full original, abridged in the 8th century by [[Paul the Deacon]] (Paulus Diaconus) as a contribution to the library of [[Charlemagne]].&lt;ref name=glinisterreview/&gt; As Festus reduced Flaccus from 40 to 20 volumes, so did Paul condense Festus by roughly half, excising entries he considered unnecessary or redundant, modifying parts of the text he thought unclear or obscure, and stripping away details like citations.&lt;ref name=project/&gt;&lt;ref name=kaster/&gt;
[[File:Paulus Diaconus Plutei 65.35 croppedmid.jpg|thumb|150px|Paul the Deacon abridged and revised the work in the 8th century]]

==Content==
The entries in Festus's epitome are organized semi-alphabetically, grouped according to first but not following letters, and with some exceptions according to particular themes, arguments, or sources.&lt;ref name=project/&gt; Festus altered some of Flaccus's text and inserted some critical remarks of his own. He updated the language, omitting Latin words that had fallen out of use, and documented his modifications in the now lost separate work, '''''Priscorum verborum cum exemplis'''''.

Though it is a summary, Festus preserves a great deal of Flaccus's original work, including etymologies and definitions and the rich historical, religious, political, and cultural information the original ''De Verborum Significatione'' is known for.&lt;ref name=lesenluminures/&gt;

In an 1880 essay about Flaccus, classical scholar [[Henry Nettleship]] criticized Festus's work as "an affair of scissors and paste, in which conceit and incompetence are perhaps equally blended".&lt;ref name=nettleship/&gt; Other scholars, like Alessandro Moscadi, suggest understanding it as instead a work of independent scholarship.&lt;ref name=moscadi/&gt;

==Scholarship==
When a copy of Paul's version was discovered by scholars at the [[Abbey of St. Gall]] in 1416, during the [[Italian Renaissance]], it attracted a surge of renewed interest and study. The [[Italian humanists]], who were enthusiastically seeking out and studying ancient Latin texts, made a number of significant contributions to the work, and several copies from the time still exist today.&lt;ref name=lesenluminures/&gt;

''De Verborum Significatione'' is a valuable resource for scholars studying language use, culture, religion, social life, and the broader history of Ancient Rome.&lt;ref name=project/&gt; It also provides insight into other Romans and their works which used, were used by, influenced, or were influenced by Flaccus's work. For example, Flaccus utilized [[Marcus Terentius Varro]]'s lost ''Antiquitates rerum humanarum et divinarum'' (47 BCE) while [[Pliny the Elder]] drew a great deal from Flaccus for his highly influential ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]]'' (c. 77 CE).&lt;ref name=project/&gt; Among the other authors Festus cites are [[Lucius Accius]], [[Cornificius]], [[Sulpicius Rufus]], [[Gaius Ateius Capito (jurist)|Gaius Ateius Capito]], and [[Ennius]].&lt;ref name=project/&gt;

Festus included many quotations and citations from authors for whom it serves as the only record of their work. For others, such as [[Plautus]], whose work would otherwise be known only through copies and quotations made much later, Festus provides verification or highlights the ways in which it had been altered.&lt;ref name=project/&gt;

The Festus Lexicon project at [[University College London]] is collating the fragments that remain of Festus's work and republishing them with translations. The project's aims are to provide public access to the work and to encourage study of both the work itself and the subjects it covers.&lt;ref name=project/&gt;

The '''''Dead Christ Held by Two Angels''''' is a painting by the Italian Renaissance artist [[Marco Palmezzano]], finished in 1510. It is housed in the [[Musée du Louvre]] of Paris, France.

The centre of the scene is occupied by the dead figure of Christ, portrayed with great attention to anatomical details, but also with evident religious piety; the brightness of his body is further enhanced by the dark stone, resembling a black cave, depicted in the background. This contrast can also have the allegorical meaning of Jesus leaving sin and death behind his shoulders. Jesus assumes in this way the evangelic role of proclamation of the end of the dark era of humanity, as also remembered by the presence of the two angels.

The work is influenced by those of [[Giovanni Bellini]], which Palmezzano saw in his sojourn in [[Venice]] in 1489–1495.

[[File: Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen in 1789.jpg|thumb|''Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen'', painted by [[Jean-Jacques-François Le Barbier]]]]
The '''Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen''' ({{lang-fr|Déclaration des droits de l'homme et du citoyen de 1789|links=no}}), set by France's [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]] in 1789, is a [[human rights|human]] [[civil rights]] document from the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;The French title can be also translated in the modern era as "Declaration of Human and Civic Rights".&lt;/ref&gt;

The Declaration was drafted by the [[Abbé Sieyès]] and the [[Marquis de Lafayette]], in consultation with [[Thomas Jefferson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Gregory | last=Fremont-Barnes|title=Encyclopedia of the Age of Political Revolutions and New Ideologies, 1760-1815|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6_2wkP4j-EsC&amp;pg=PA190|year=2007|publisher=Greenwood |page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by the doctrine of "[[Natural and legal rights|natural right]]", the rights of man are held to be [[Moral universalism|universal]]: valid at all times and in every place, pertaining to human nature itself. It became the basis for a nation of free individuals protected equally by the law. It is included in the beginning of the constitutions of both the Fourth French Republic (1946) and Fifth Republic (1958) and is still current. Inspired by the Enlightenment philosophers, the Declaration was a core statement of the values of the French Revolution and had a major impact on the development of [[freedom]] and [[democracy]] in Europe and worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kopstein Kopstein|title=Comparative Politics: Interests, Identities, and Institutions in a Changing Global Order|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gh3PVi6II54C&amp;pg=PA72|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge UP|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Declaration, together with [[Magna Carta]], the [[English Bill of Rights]], the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] and the [[United States Bill of Rights]], inspired in large part the 1948 [[United Nations]] [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;Douglas K. Stevenson (1987), ''American Life and Institutions'', Stuttgart (Germany), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The content of the document emerged largely from the ideals of the Enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Georges | last=Lefebvre|title=The Coming of the French Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P4EYuia7buUC&amp;pg=PA212|year=2005|publisher=Princeton UP|page=212}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The key drafts were prepared by Lafayette, working at times with his close friend Thomas Jefferson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=George Athan Billias, ed.|title=American Constitutionalism Heard Round the World, 1776-1989: A Global Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7WV0nP5n_AoC&amp;pg=PA92|year=2009|publisher=NYU Press|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Susan Dunn, ''Sister Revolutions: French Lightning, American Light'' (1999) pp 143-45&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1789, [[Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, Comte de Mirabeau|Honoré Mirabeau]] played a central role in conceptualizing and drafting the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Baker, "The Idea of a Declaration of Rights" in Dale Van Kley, ed. ''The French Idea of Freedom: The Old Regime and the Declaration of Rights of 1789'' (1997) pp 154-96.&lt;/ref&gt;

The last article of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen was adopted on the 26 of August 1789 by the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]], during the period of the French Revolution, as the first step toward writing a constitution for France. Inspired by the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], the original version of the Declaration was discussed by the representatives on the basis of a 24 article draft proposed by {{cl-span|the sixth bureau|date=November 2014}},&lt;ref&gt;The original draft is an annex to the 12 August report (Archives parlementaires, 1,&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; série, tome VIII, [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k495230.image.f499.langFR débats du 12 août 1789], p. 431).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Archives parlementaires, 1&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; série, tome VIII, [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k495230.image.f527.langFR débats du 19 août 1789], p. 459.&lt;/ref&gt; led by [[:fr:Jérôme Champion de Cicé|Jérôme Champion de Cicé]]. The draft was later modified during the debates. A second and lengthier declaration, known as the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen of 1793]], was written in 1793 but never formally adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gregory Fremont-Barnes, ed.|title=Encyclopedia of the Age of Political Revolutions and New Ideologies, 1760-1815|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=30EEq8R2feIC&amp;pg=PA159|year=2007|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|pages=159 vol 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical and theoretical context==

The concepts in the Declaration come from the philosophical and political duties of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], such as [[individualism]], the [[social contract]] as theorized by the Genevan philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], and the [[separation of powers]] espoused by the [[Montesquieu|Baron de Montesquieu]]. As can be seen in the texts, the French declaration was heavily influenced by the political philosophy of the Enlightenment and principles of human rights as was the [[U.S. Declaration of Independence]] which preceded it (4 July 1776).

According to a legal textbook published in 2007, the declaration is in the spirit of "secular natural law", which does not base itself on religious doctrine or authority, in contrast with traditional [[natural law]] theory, which does.&lt;ref name="Merryman 2007 16"&gt;{{cite book| last = Merryman| first = John Henry|author2=Rogelierdomo| title = The civil law tradition: an introduction to the legal system of Europe and Latin America| publisher=Stanford University Press | year = 2007| location =| page = 16| url = https://books.google.com/?id=6OJf9CbgKTkC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=Declaration+of+the+Rights+of+Man+and+of+the+Citizen#v=onepage&amp;q=Declaration%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Man%20and%20of%20the%20Citizen&amp;f=false| doi =| id =| isbn =9780804755696 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The declaration defines a single set of individual and collective rights for all men. Influenced by the doctrine of natural rights, these rights are held to be [[universality (philosophy)|universal]] and valid in all times and places. For example, "Men are born and remain free and equal in rights. Social distinctions may be founded only upon the general good."&lt;ref&gt;First Article, Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.&lt;/ref&gt; They have certain natural rights to [[property]], to liberty, and to life. According to this theory, the role of government is to recognize and secure these rights. Furthermore, government should be carried on by elected representatives.&lt;ref name="Merryman 2007 16"/&gt;

At the time of writing, the rights contained in the declaration were only awarded to men. Furthermore, the declaration was a statement of vision rather than reality. The declaration was not deeply rooted in either the practice of the West or even France at the time. The declaration emerged in the late 18th century out of war and revolution. It encountered opposition as democracy and [[individual rights]] were frequently regarded as synonymous with [[anarchy]] and [[subversion]]. The declaration embodies ideals and aspirations towards which France pledged to struggle in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Lauren| first = Paul Gordon| authorlink = | title = The evolution of international human rights: visions seen| publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press| year = 2003| location =| page = 32| url = https://books.google.com/?id=gHRhWgbWyzMC&amp;dq=Declaration+of+the+Rights+of+Man+and+of+the+Citizen| doi =| id = | isbn =9780812218541 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Substance==

The Declaration is introduced by a preamble describing the fundamental characteristics of the rights which are qualified as being "natural, unalienable and sacred" and consisting of "simple and incontestable principles" on which citizens could base their demands. In the second article, "the natural and imprescriptible rights of man" are defined as "liberty, property, security and [[right of revolution|resistance to oppression]]". It called for the destruction of aristocratic privileges by proclaiming an end to [[feudalism]] and to exemptions from taxation, freedom and equal rights for all "Men", and access to public office based on talent. The monarchy was restricted, and all citizens were to have the right to take part in the legislative process. [[Freedom of speech]] and press were declared, and arbitrary arrests outlawed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Spielvogel| first = Jackson J.| title = Western Civilization: 1300 to 1815| publisher=Wadsworth Publishing | year = 2008| location = | page = 580| url = https://books.google.com/?id=0QKxEJF-zQQC&amp;dq=Declaration+of+the+Rights+of+Man+and+of+the+Citizen | isbn = 978-0-495-50289-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Declaration also asserted the principles of [[popular sovereignty]], in contrast to the [[divine right of kings]] that characterized the French monarchy, and social equality among citizens, "All the citizens, being equal in the eyes of the law, are equally admissible to all public dignities, places, and employments, according to their capacity and without distinction other than that of their virtues and of their talents," eliminating the special rights of the nobility and clergy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=von Guttner|first=Darius|title=The French Revolution|url=https://www.academia.edu/9869783/The_French_Revolution|year=2015|publisher=Nelson Cengage|pages=85–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Articles===
{{Copy section to Wikisource}}

'''Article I''' – Men are born and remain free and equal in rights.  Social distinctions can be founded only on the common good.

'''Article II''' – The goal of any political association is the conservation of the natural and imprescriptible rights of man.  These rights are liberty, property, safety and resistance against oppression.

'''Article III''' – The principle of any sovereignty resides essentially in the Nation.  No body, no individual can exert authority which does not emanate expressly from it.

'''Article IV''' – Liberty consists of doing anything which does not harm others: thus, the exercise of the natural rights of each man has only those borders which assure other members of the society the fruition of these same rights.  These borders can be determined only by the law.

'''Article V''' – The law has the right to forbid only actions harmful to society.  Anything which is not forbidden by the law cannot be impeded, and no one can be constrained to do what it does not order.

'''Article VI''' – The law is the expression of the general will.  All the citizens have the right of contributing personally or through their representatives to its formation.  It must be the same for all, either that it protects, or that it punishes.  All the citizens, being equal in its eyes, are equally admissible to all public dignities, places, and employments, according to their capacity and without distinction other than that of their virtues and of their talents.

'''Article VII''' – No man can be accused, arrested nor detained but in the cases determined by the law, and according to the forms which it has prescribed.  Those who solicit, dispatch, carry out or cause to be carried out arbitrary orders, must be punished; but any citizen called or seized under the terms of the law must obey at once; he renders himself culpable by resistance.

'''Article VIII''' – The law should establish only penalties that are strictly and evidently necessary, and no one can be punished but under a law established and promulgated before the offense and legally applied.

'''Article IX''' – Any man being presumed innocent until he is declared culpable if it is judged indispensable to arrest him, any rigor which would not be necessary for the securing of his person must be severely reprimanded by the law.

'''Article X''' – No one may be disturbed for his opinions, even religious ones, provided that their manifestation does not trouble the public order established by the law.

'''Article XI''' – The free communication of thoughts and of opinions is one of the most precious rights of man: any citizen thus may speak, write, print freely, except to respond to the abuse of this liberty, in the cases determined by the law.

'''Article XII''' – The guarantee of the rights of man and of the citizen necessitates a public force: this force is thus instituted for the advantage of all and not for the particular utility of those in whom it is trusted.

'''Article XIII''' – For the maintenance of the public force and for the expenditures of administration, a common contribution is indispensable; it must be equally distributed to all the citizens, according to their ability to pay.

'''Article XIV''' – Each citizen has the right to ascertain, by himself or through his representatives, the need for a public tax, to consent to it freely, to know the uses to which it is put, and of determining the proportion, basis, collection, and duration.

'''Article XV''' – The society has the right of requesting an account from any public agent of its administration.

'''Article XVI''' – Any society in which the guarantee of rights is not assured, nor the separation of powers determined, has no Constitution.

'''Article XVII''' – Property being an inviolable and sacred right, no one can be deprived of private usage, if it is not when the public necessity, legally noted, evidently requires it, and under the condition of a just and prior indemnity.

===Active and passive citizenship===
While the [[French Revolution]] provided rights to a larger portion of the population, there remained a distinction between those who obtained the political rights in the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen and those who did not. Those who were deemed to hold these political rights were called active citizens. [[Active citizenship]] was granted to men who were French, at least 25 years old, paid taxes equal to three days work, and could not be defined as servants [http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/d/282/ (Thouret)].&lt;ref&gt;Thouret 1789, http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/d/282/&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that at the time of the Declaration only male property owners held these rights.&lt;ref&gt;Censer and Hunt 2001, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;  The deputies in the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] believed that only those who held tangible interests in the nation could make informed political decisions.&lt;ref name="Popkin 2006, p. 46"&gt;Popkin 2006, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction directly affects articles 6, 12, 14, and 15 of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen as each of these rights is related to the right to vote and to participate actively in the government. With the decree of 29 October 1789, the term active citizen became embedded in French politics.&lt;ref name="Doyle 1989, p. 124"&gt;Doyle 1989, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of [[passive citizens]] was created to encompass those populations that had been excluded from political rights in the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen. Because of the requirements set down for active citizens, the vote was granted to approximately 4.3 million Frenchmen&lt;ref name="Doyle 1989, p. 124"/&gt; out of a population of around 29 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/chap1a.html "Social Causes of the Revolution"]&lt;/ref&gt;  These omitted groups included women, slaves, children, and foreigners. As these measures were voted upon by the General Assembly, they limited the rights of certain groups of citizens while implementing the democratic process of the new [[French First Republic|French Republic (1792–1804)]].&lt;ref name="Popkin 2006, p. 46"/&gt; This legislation, passed in 1789, was amended by the creators of the [[Constitution of the Year III]] in order to eliminate the label of active citizen.&lt;ref name="Doyle 1989, p. 420"&gt;Doyle 1989, p. 420.&lt;/ref&gt; The power to vote was then, however, to be granted solely to substantial property owners.&lt;ref name="Doyle 1989, p. 420"/&gt;

Tensions arose between active and passive citizens throughout the Revolution. This happened when passive citizens started to call for more rights, or when they openly refused to listen to the ideals set forth by active citizens. This [http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/d/75/ cartoon] clearly demonstrates the difference that existed between the active and passive citizens along with the tensions associated with such differences.&lt;ref&gt;"Active/Passive Citizen", http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/d/75/.&lt;/ref&gt; In the cartoon, a passive citizen is holding a spade and a wealthy landowning active citizen is ordering the passive citizens to go to work. The act appears condescending to the passive citizen and it revisits the reasons why the French Revolution began in the first place.

Women, in particular, were strong passive citizens who played a significant role in the Revolution. [[Olympe de Gouges]] penned her [[Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen]] in 1791 and drew attention to the need for gender equality.&lt;ref&gt;De Gouges, "Declaration of the Rights of Women", 1791.&lt;/ref&gt; By supporting the ideals of the French Revolution and wishing to expand them to women, she represented herself as a revolutionary citizen. Madame Roland also established herself as an influential figure throughout the Revolution. She saw women of the French Revolution as holding three roles; "inciting revolutionary action, formulating policy, and informing others of revolutionary events."&lt;ref&gt;Dalton 2001, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; By working with men, as opposed to working separate from men, she may have been able to further the fight of revolutionary women. As players in the French Revolution, women occupied a significant role in the civic sphere by forming social movements and participating in popular clubs, allowing them societal influence, despite their lack of direct political influence.&lt;ref&gt;Levy and Applewhite 2002, pp. 319–20, 324.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women's rights===
The Declaration recognized many rights as belonging to citizens (who could only be male). This was despite the fact that after [[The March on Versailles]] on 5 October 1789, women presented the [[Women's Petition to the National Assembly]] in which they proposed a decree giving women equal rights.&lt;ref&gt;[https://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/d/629/ Women's Petition to the National Assembly&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1790, [[Nicolas de Condorcet]] and [[Etta Palm d'Aelders]] unsuccessfully called on the National Assembly to extend civil and political rights to women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Letters written in France |last=Williams |first= Helen Maria |authorlink= |author2=Neil Fraistat |author3=Susan Sniader Lanser |author4=David Brookshire  |year=2001 |publisher=Broadview Press Ltd |location= |isbn=978-1-55111-255-8 |page=246  |url=https://books.google.com/?id=5Ruwz82RicgC&amp;dq=Declaration+of+the+Rights+of+Woman+and+the+Female+Citizen |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Condorcet declared that "he who votes against the right of another, whatever the religion, color, or sex of that other, has henceforth abjured his own".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The evolution of international human rights |last=Lauren |first=Paul Gordon |authorlink= |year=2003 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |location= |isbn= 978-0-8122-1854-1 |pages=18–20 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=gHRhWgbWyzMC&amp;dq=Declaration+of+the+Rights+of+Man+and+of+the+Citizen |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French Revolution did not lead to a recognition of [[women's rights]] and this prompted [[Olympe de Gouges]] to publish the [[Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen]] in September 1791.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Death comes to the maiden: Sex and Execution, 1431–1933 |last=Naish |first=Camille |authorlink= |year=1991 |publisher=Routledge |location= |isbn= 978-0-415-05585-7 |page=136 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=OHYOAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=Declaration+of+the+Rights+of+Woman+and+the+Female+Citizen |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen is modeled on the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen and is ironic in formulation and exposes the failure of the [[French Revolution]], which had been devoted to [[Egalitarianism|equality]]. It states that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This revolution will only take effect when all women become fully aware of their deplorable condition, and of the rights, they have lost in society.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen follows the seventeen articles of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen point for point and has been described by Camille Naish as "almost a parody... of the original document". The first article of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen proclaims that "Men are born and remain free and equal in rights. Social distinctions may be based only on common utility." The first article of Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen replied: "Woman is born free and remains equal to man in rights. Social distinctions may only be based on common utility".

De Gouges also draws attention to the fact that under French law women were fully punishable, yet denied equal rights, declaring "Women have the right to mount the scaffold, they must also have the right to mount the speaker's rostrum".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Death comes to the maiden: Sex and Execution, 1431–1933 |last=Naish |first=Camille |authorlink= |year=1991 |publisher=Routledge |location= |isbn= 978-0-415-05585-7 |page=137  |url= https://books.google.com/?id=OHYOAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=Declaration+of+the+Rights+of+Woman+and+the+Female+Citizen |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slavery===
The declaration did not revoke the institution of slavery, as lobbied for by Jacques-Pierre Brissot's ''[[Slavery abolition efforts by Les Amis des Noirs|Les Amis des Noirs]]'' and defended by the group of colonial planters called the [[Club Massiac]] because they met at the Hôtel Massiac.&lt;ref&gt;The club of reactionary colonial proprietors meeting since July 1789 were opposed to representation in the Assemblée of France's overseas dominions, for fear "that this would expose delicate colonial issues to the hazards of debate in the Assembly", as Robin Blackburn expressed it (Blackburn, The Overthrow of Colonial Slavery, 1776–1848 [1988:174f]); see also the speech of [[Jean-Baptiste Belley]]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the lack of explicit mention of slavery in the Declaration, slave uprisings in [[Saint-Domingue]] in the [[Haitian Revolution]] were inspired by it, as discussed in [[C. L. R. James]]' history of the Haitian Revolution, ''[[The Black Jacobins]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Heinrich August Winkler (2012), ''Geschichte des Westens. Von den Anfängen in der Antike bis zum 20. Jahrhundert'', Third Edition, Munich (Germany), p. 386&lt;/ref&gt;

Deplorable conditions for the thousands of slaves in Saint-Domingue, the most profitable slave colony in the world, led to the uprisings which would be known as the first successful slave revolt in the New World. [[Free persons of color]] were part of the first wave of revolt, but later former slaves took control. In 1794 the Convention dominated by the Jacobins [[Abolitionism#First general abolition of slavery|abolished]] slavery, including in the colonies of Saint-Domingue and Guadeloupe. However, Napoleon reinstated it in 1802 and attempted to regain control of Saint-Domingue by sending in thousands of troops. After suffering the losses of two-thirds of the men, many to yellow fever, the French withdrew from Saint-Domingue in 1803. Napoleon gave up on North America and agreed to the [[Louisiana Purchase]] by the United States. In 1804, the leaders of Saint-Domingue declared it as an independent state, the [[Republic of Haiti]], the second republic of the New World.

==Legacy==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}
The Declaration has also influenced and inspired rights-based [[liberal democracy]] throughout the world. It was translated as soon as 1793–1794 by Colombian [[Antonio Nariño]], who published it despite the [[Inquisition]]. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison for doing so. In 2003, the document was listed on UNESCO's [[Memory of the World Programme|Memory of the World register]].

===Constitution of the French Fifth Republic===
{{main|Constitution of the French Fifth Republic}}
According to the [[preamble]] of the [[Constitution of the French Fifth Republic]] (adopted on 4 October 1958, and the current constitution), the principles set forth in the Declaration have constitutional value. Many laws and regulations have been canceled because they did not comply with those principles as interpreted by the [[Conseil Constitutionnel]] ("Constitutional Council of France") or by the ''[[Council of State (France)|Conseil d'État]]'' ("Council of State").
* Taxation legislation or practices that seem to make some unwarranted difference between citizens are struck down as unconstitutional.
* Suggestions of [[positive discrimination]] on ethnic grounds are rejected because they infringe on the principle of equality, since they would establish categories of people that would, by birth, enjoy greater rights.

'''''Environments''''' is a series of [[LP album|LPs]], [[Compact Cassette|cassettes]], [[Stereo 8|8-Track cartridges]] and [[Compact Disc|CDs]] created by producer and sound recordist [[Irv Teibel]] (1938&amp;ndash;2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Irv Teibel October 9, 1938 - October 28, 2010 Austin, Texas |url=http://hosting-tributes-22183.tributes.com/show/Irv-Teibel-89693321 |title=Irv Teibel Obituary - Weed-Corley-Fish Funeral Home North |publisher=Hosting-tributes-22183.tributes.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;) for Syntonic Research Inc. between 1969 and 1979.  The series consists of recordings of [[natural sounds]] such as a seashore with crashing waves or a thunderstorm with falling rain, without musical accompaniment. The series helped ignite a worldwide interest in [[field recordings]] which resulted in many imitations being released throughout the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s both with, and without, music (i.e.: Moods, [[Solitudes]], Echoes of Nature, Nature Recordings, Gentle Persuasion: The Sounds of Nature, The Sounds of Nature (by Joe Baker), Magic Moods, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cummings|first1=Jim|title=Irv Teibel died this week: Creator of 1970s "Environments" LPs|url=http://earthear.com/blog/archives/198|website=Earth Ear|accessdate=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Environments'' LPs==
The original series, distributed by [[Atlantic Records]], comprised 11 long-playing records with a different environment on each side, for 22 total ''Environments''.

=== {{anchor|Environments 1}} ''Environments 1'' (1969)===
* ''Side 1: The Psychologically Ultimate Seashore'' (30:00)
The initial recording in the series goes back to 1968. Working under the direction of [[Tony Conrad]] and Beverly Grant Conrad, Teibel recorded ocean waves at Coney Island  for use in their feature film ''Coming Attractions'' (1970). Teibel immediately sensed the marketability of this material, noting its effect on improving concentration, enhancing sleep and sex, and imparting a sense of calm to the listener. Conrad, who wished to credit [[Walter De Maria]] for his prior usage of ocean recordings, was not willing to become a partner in the Syntonic Research enterprise as envisioned by Teibel, so Teibel parted ways with the "Coming Attractions" project. Subsequently, Teibel himself felt unsatisfied with his results — though his [[Uher (brand)|Uher]] stereo reel-to-reel tape recorder had faithfully captured the sounds of the surf, he felt that they were less convincing on playback. A friend of Teibel's, Louis Gerstman, had access to an [[IBM 360]] computer, and he and Teibel played around with processing the recordings until eventually the two of them hit upon a series of manipulations (basically some rolling filtering and overdubbing) which sounded 'more real than real.'
* ''Side 2: Optimum Aviary'' (30:00)
For the second side of the LP, Teibel recorded an enclosure of birds at the [[Bronx Zoo]] [[aviary]].  Later soundscapes were much more naturalistic.

=== {{anchor|Environments 2}} ''Environments 2'' (1970)===
* ''Side One: Tintinnabulation'' (30:00)
Alone among the ''Environments'' series, ''[[wikt:tintinnabulation|Tintinnabulation]]'' is not natural sounds at all but a series of computer-generated bell sounds playable at any speed from 16{{2/3}} to 78&amp;nbsp; rpm.  The CD reissue opted for the 16{{2/3}}&amp;nbsp;rpm speed.
* ''Side Two: Dawn at [[New Hope, Pennsylvania|New Hope, PA]]'' (30:00)
The quintessential "field recording" with owls, crows, doves, insects, dogs and geese recorded early one morning in June 1969.

=== {{anchor|Environments 3}} ''Environments 3'' (1971)===
* ''Side One: Be-In'' (34:00)
The sounds of a spontaneous gathering in [[Central Park]], April 6, 1969 with strolling musicians, dancers, [[Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War#1969|anti-war protesters]], and fragments of conversations.  This recording presents the unmistakable ambiance of a place and time in culture now gone. Though many of the ''Environments'' recordings have been imitated, this one stands alone as a totally unique recording.
* ''Side Two: Dusk at New Hope, PA'' (37:00)
A warm summer night (recorded August 1970) deep in the backwoods of Eastern Pennsylvania, surrounded by insects and the occasional distant hound.

=== {{anchor|Environments 4}} ''Environments 4'' (1974)===
* ''Side One: Ultimate Thunderstorm'' (32:00)
One of the most-imitated nature recordings, with thunder, lightning and a torrential downpour.  This one was recorded from a balcony in the city, unlike ''[[#Environments 11|Environments 11]]'' which was recorded outdoors in the country.
* ''Side Two: Gentle Rain in a Pine Forest'' (34:00)
This recording revealed a paradoxical effect, where low-level high-frequency sounds could make a room seem quieter than when the recording was not playing.

'''Note:''' Announced inside ''Environments 4'' but never released:
''Children at Play/Cocktail Party'' (was to be ''Environments 9'') and
''Spanish Train/[[San Francisco cable car system|Cable Car (S.F.)]]'' (was to be ''Environments 10'').

=== {{anchor|Environments 5}} ''Environments 5'' (1974)===
* ''Side One: Ultimate Heartbeat'' (20:00)
A [[stethoscope]] heartbeat recording which can be used to calm infants, aid meditation or enhance lovemaking.
* ''Side Two: Wind in the Trees'' (34:00)
The soft rush of wind rustling the leaves of a grove in late autumn.

=== {{anchor|Environments 6}} ''Environments 6'' (1974)===
* ''Side One: Dawn in the [[Okefenokee Swamp]]'' (34:00)
* ''Side Two: Dusk in the Okefenokee Swamp'' (34:00)
Accessible only by airboat, Georgia's verdant wetlands are home to thousands of species both large and small, including growling alligators.  Both recordings were taken at the same location, but ten hours apart.

=== {{anchor|Environments 7}} ''Environments 7'' (1976)===
* ''Side One: Intonation'' (30:00)
A blended chorus of male and female singers intoning an "[[Om]]" chant.
* ''Side Two: Summer Cornfield'' (35:00)
The cicadas, grasshoppers and katydids of a Vermont field provide a blanket of pulsating sound, subtly enhanced by further bug sounds from an [[Electronic Music Laboratories|EML]] synthesizer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.headheritage.co.uk/unsung/review/527 |title=Julian Cope Presents Head Heritage &amp;#124; Unsung &amp;#124; Reviews &amp;#124; Environments - Induced Meditation |publisher=Headheritage.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2008-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Better source|date=March 2012}}

=== {{anchor|Environments 8}} ''Environments 8'' (1974)===
* ''Side One: Wood-Masted Sailboat'' (34:00)
Creaking boards, straining lines, and a taut canvas recorded aboard a 42-foot [[sloop]] under full sail.
* ''Side Two: A Country Stream'' (34:00)
A small meandering stream near [[Stockbridge, Massachusetts]], with insects, birds and the sound of water flowing over rocks.  Another oft-imitated soundscape in the series.

=== {{anchor|Environments 9}} ''Environments 9'' (1979)===
* ''Side One: Pacific Ocean'' (30:00)
Slower and calmer than the Atlantic recordings on ''[[#Environments 1|Environments 1]]'', with seagulls.
* ''Side Two: Caribbean Lagoon'' (30:00)
Gently lapping waves on a white sand beach.

=== {{anchor|Environments 10}} ''Environments 10'' (1979)===
* ''Side One: English Meadow'' (30:00)
Songbirds recorded in the [[Sussex]] countryside, near the [[Long Man of Wilmington]] chalk drawing.
* ''Side Two: Night in the Country'' (30:00)
The sound of a vast sea of insects, primarily [[cicada]]s.

=== {{anchor|Environments 11}} ''Environments 11'' (1979)===
* ''Side One: Alpine Blizzard'' (30:00)
Howling wind and banging shutters in a ski chateau—a recording which seemingly lowers the temperature of any room.
* ''Side Two: Country Thunderstorm'' (30:00)
A quiet afternoon of insects and birds gradually gives way to distant thunder, approaching rain squalls, and then a full-on rainstorm.

Historically considered a [[Masculinity|masculine]] habit, the [[Feminization (activity)|feminization]] of [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]] occurred in tandem with the advent of '''fashion brands''' or premium brands of '''[[cigarettes]]''' specifically marketed toward women. Most often this is focused on young fashion-conscious professional ladies who are the [[Target market|target demographic]] for these brands, which are differentiated by slimness and added length over traditional brands of cigarettes.

These brands include decorative ones like [[Eve (cigarette)|Eve]], marketed strictly toward women like [[Virginia Slims]], or as evening-out styles like [[Sobranie (cigarette)|Sobranie]] Cocktail or Sobranie Black Russian. Many fashion houses have lent their name (through a licensing agreement) to cigarettes; [[Yves Saint-Laurent (brand)|Yves Saint Laurent]] is probably the most successful of these (even though he admitted in a 1968 interview he smokes, but not his namesake brand, as he does "not like the flavour"), though many other brands have been marketed, from time to time, in select international markets: [[Givenchy]], [[Gianni Versace S.p.A.|Versace]], [[Pierre Cardin]], [[Christian Lacroix]] and [[Cartier SA|Cartier]] (a jewelry house).

In the 1980s and early 1990s, manufacturers created longer, 164 millimeter versions of several ladies' cigarettes. However, finding only a small [[niche market]], the machines that produced them have since been dismantled. 

With the [[Smoking ban|anti-smoking]] movement in the United States, [[Cigarette#Manufacturing|cigarette manufacturers]] have turned to Asia, where there is a distinct market for female oriented brands, and to the ''[[nouveau riche]]'' in Russia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4591">The '''Fundred Dollar Bill Project''' is an art project implemented by [[Mel Chin]], and is aimed to connect and represent the voices of children across the United States, with the end goal to propose a funding solution for the [[lead poisoning|lead contamination]] in the soil of [[New Orleans, Louisiana]].  People in the United States and around the globe are invited to draw their own 100 dollar bills and send to collection centers, or schools, for safekeeping. During a nationwide road-trip in an armored truck, the Fundred Dollar Bills will be collected.

The completed Fundred Dollar Bills will be presented to Congress for an even exchange of U.S. dollars to help the remediation of lead in the soil of New Orleans. This funding supports [[Operation Paydirt]], which is the program that, once implemented, will make the lead content in the soil safe for inhabitants of New Orleans and cities affected by lead poisoning-across the United States.

So far nearly half a million people have created and sent in their unique Fundreds. 

'''Armored Truck Tour'''

Throughout 2010, students at hundreds of schools across the country created Fundred Dollar Bills that were picked up in a specially designed armored truck. 
As students and educators handed their Fundreds over to truck guards for safekeeping, schools held events that raised awareness of the gravity and persistence of the lead in our environment. 

These events gave local elected officials and community organizations a chance to show their support for lead cleanup while giving local press brought the issue to larger audiences.

At every stop the armored truck tour connected the national campaign for lead awareness. Each event around the country not only provided public and impassioned demonstrations against lead poisoning, but brought people together to make connections around this public health health issue.

Grand Rapids

In the fall of 2014, the ArtPrize competition in Grand Rapids, Michigan featuring the Fundred Dollar Bill Project, offered an opportunity to raise visibility of local lead issues and invite participation from the tends of thousands of expected visitors. 

Visitors to the exhibit sat at bank teller tables and drew their unique Fundreds. Once drawn, their Fundreds were added to hundreds of others on a wall in the exhibit, making their artful demonstrations part of the exhibit for its duration. In addition to creating a public display of action-oriented art, the Grand Rapids initiative brought together local public health specialists, educators, and scientists to talk about the challenges and solutions to lead poisoning in Grand Rapids.

Art Academy in Cincinnati

In 2015, the Art Academy of Cincinnati partnered with the Fundred Dollar Bill Project and the Cincinnati Health Department Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program to create a course that used art and design to address and impact issues of lead contamination in Cincinnati. 

With the Fundred Dollar Bill Project as a common starting point and inspiration, students launched group projects to increase awareness of childhood lead poisoning and our ability to put an end to it. Students exhibited their projects at a publicly accessible end of semester block party. Students explored lead poisoning through dance performance and graphic design and created a learning-through-play area. The Health Department shared information about lead, and a public Fundred drawing table provided opportunity for attendees to sit together for conversation and to creatively put their values in action.

'''Initiatives'''

Fundred Reserve Open Lab at H-Space, located in DC, is a space to expand the Fundred program by continuing to amplify personal stories, having fact based dialogue about problems in DC, and engaging more people to take purposeful action. 

Open Lab continues the presence after the 2017 Fundred Reserve exhibition at The Corcoran.  Open Lab programming runs from October through April 2018, with space provided by Hamiltonian Artists, and support from The Kresge Foundation through our partnership with MIT CoLab. 

As an extension of Mel Chin’s multi-venue exhibition, All Over the Place (April 8 - September 5, 2018), the Fundred Project is on view at the Queens Museum as part of the exhibition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9280">{{History of Western art music}}
In music, '''galant''' refers to the [[composition school|style]] which was fashionable from the 1720s to the 1770s. This movement featured a return to simplicity and immediacy of appeal after the complexity of the late [[Baroque music|Baroque]] era.  This meant simpler, more song-like melodies, decreased use of [[polyphony]], short, periodic phrases, a reduced harmonic vocabulary emphasizing tonic and dominant, and a clear distinction between soloist and accompaniment. [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach|C. P. E. Bach]] and [[Daniel Gottlob Türk]], who were among the most significant theorists of the late 18th century, contrasted the galant with the "learned" or "strict" styles ({{harvnb|Bach|1753|loc=passim}}; {{harvnb|Türk|1789|p=405}}).  The German ''[[empfindsamer Stil]]'',  which seeks to express personal emotions and sensitivity, can be seen either as a closely related North-German dialect of the international galant style ({{harvnb|Heartz and Brown|2001a}}; {{harvnb|Heartz and Brown|2001b}}; {{harvnb|Palmer|2001|loc=xvii}}; {{harvnb|Wolf|2003}}), or as 
contrasted with it, as between the music of [[Carl Philipp Emmanuel Bach]], a founder of both styles, and that of [[Johann Christian Bach]], who carried the galant style further and was closer to classical.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

This musical style was part of the wider [[galant]] movement in art at the time.

[[File:1698 Campra L'Europe Galante.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|left|[[André Campra]], ''L'Europe galante'' 2nd edition (1698) {{audio|1698 Campra L'Europe Galante Prologue Ouverture.mid|Play ouverture}}]]

The word "galant" derives from French, where it was in use from at least the 16th century. In the early 18th century, a ''Galant Homme'' described a person of fashion; elegant, cultured and virtuous. The German theorist [[Johann Mattheson]] appears to have been fond of the term. It features in the title of his first publication of 1713, ''Das neu-eröffnete ''Orchestre'', oder ''Universelle'' und gründliche Anleitung wie ein ''Galant Homme'' einen vollkommenen Begriff von der Hoheit und Würde der edlen ''Music'' erlangen''. (Instead of the [[Gothic type]] rendered here in italics, Mattheson used [[Roman type|Roman]] to emphasize the many non-German expressions ({{harvnb|Mattheson|1713|loc=title page}}; {{harvnb|Heartz and Brown|2001}})). Mattheson was apparently the first to refer to a "galant style" in music, in his ''Das forschende Orchestre'' of 1721. He recognized a lighter, modern  style, ''einem galanten Stylo'' and named among its leading practitioners [[Giovanni Bononcini]], [[Antonio Caldara]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann]], [[Alessandro Scarlatti]], [[Antonio Vivaldi]] and [[George Frideric Handel]] {{harv|Heartz|2003|p=18}}. All were composing Italian ''[[opera seria]]'', a voice-driven musical style, and opera remained the central form of galant music. The new music was not as essentially a court music as it was a city music: the cities emphasized by Daniel Heartz, a recent historian of the style, were first of all [[Naples]], then  [[Venice]], [[Dresden]], [[Berlin]], [[Stuttgart]] and [[Mannheim]], and [[Paris]]. Many galant composers spent their careers in less central cities, ones that may be considered consumers rather than producers of the ''style galant'': [[Johann Christian Bach]] and [[Carl Friedrich Abel]] in London, [[Giovanni Paisiello]] in [[St Petersburg]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann]] in Hamburg, and [[Luigi Boccherini]] in [[Madrid]].

The rejection of so much accumulated learning and formula in music is paralleled only by the rejection in the early 20th century of the entire structure of [[key relationship]]s.  Not every contemporary was delighted with this revolutionary simplification: Johann Samuel Petri, in his ''Anleitung zur praktischen Musik'' (1782) spoke of the "great catastrophe in music" {{harv|Blume|1970|p=20}}.

The change was as much at the birth of Romanticism as it was of Classicism. The folk-song element in poetry, like the singable ''cantabile'' melody in galant music, was brought to public notice in [[Thomas Percy (Bishop of Dromore)|Thomas Percy]]'s ''[[Reliques of Ancient Poetry]]'' (1765) and [[James Macpherson]]'s "[[Ossian]]" inventions during the 1760s.

[[File:1736 Les Indes Galantes.png|thumb|[[Louis Fuzelier]] and [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]], ''Les indes galantes'' (1735–36)]]
Some of Telemann's later music and of Bach's sons, [[Johann Quantz]], [[Johann Adolph Hasse|Hasse]], [[Giovanni Battista Sammartini]], [[Giuseppe Tartini]], [[Baldassare Galuppi]], [[Johann Stamitz]], [[Domenico Alberti]], and early [[Mozart]] are exemplars of galant style. &lt;!-- some of. Especially as regards Telemann, Bach's sons... --&gt; Some of the works of the Portuguese composer [[Carlos Seixas]] are firmly in the galant style.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

This simplified style was melody-driven, not constructed, as so much classical music was to be, on rhythmic or melodic [[Motif (music)|motifs]]: "It is indicative that [[Haydn]], even in his old age, is reported to have said, 'If you want to know whether a melody is really beautiful, sing it without accompaniment'" {{harv|Blume|1970|p=19}}. This simplification also extended to [[harmonic rhythm]], which is generally slower in galant music than is the case in the earlier baroque style, thus making lavish melodic ornamentation and nuances of secondary harmonic colorings more important {{harv|Palmer|2001|loc=xvii}}.

The affinities of galant style with [[Rococo]] in the visual arts are easily overplayed, but characteristics that were valued in both genres were freshness, accessibility and charm. [[Watteau]]'s ''fêtes galantes'' were rococo not merely in subject matter, but also in the lighter, cleaner tonality of his palette, and the glazes that supplied a galant translucency to his finished pictures often compared to the orchestrations of galant music ({{harvnb|Heartz|2003}}, {{Page needed|date=April 2013}}).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9320">'''Hebrew spelling''' ({{lang-he|כתיב עברי}} {{IPA|/ktiv ʕivˈri/}}, "Hebrew spelling") refers to the way words are spelled in the [[Hebrew language]]. The [[Hebrew alphabet]] contains 22 letters, all of which are primarily consonants.  This is because the Hebrew script is an [[abjad]], that is, its letters indicate consonants, not vowels or syllables. An early system to overcome this, still used today, is [[mater lectionis|''matres lectionis'']], where four of these letters, [[Aleph|alef]], [[He (letter)|he]], [[Waw (letter)|waw]] and [[yodh]] also serve as vowel letters. Later, a system of vowel points to indicate vowels (diacritics), called [[niqqud]], was developed.

==History==
{{Further information|Biblical Hebrew orthography}}
Throughout history, there have been two main systems of Hebrew spelling. One is vocalized spelling, the other is unvocalized spelling.

In vocalized spelling (''[[ktiv menuqad]]''), all of the vowels are indicated by vowel points (called [[niqqud]]). In unvocalized spelling (''[[ktiv hasar niqqud]]''), the vowel points are omitted, but some of them are substituted by additional vowel letters - [[Waw (letter)|waw]] and [[yodh]] (''Ktiv malē''). This system is the spelling system commonly used in Israel today.

Vowel points are always optional in Hebrew. They can be used fully, partially or not used at all. The recommended approach endorsed today by the [[Academy of the Hebrew Language]] and other Israeli educational institutions is to use ''plēnē'' spelling (''matres lectionis'') when not adding vowel dots (which is the usual case), and place a vocalization sign on a letter only when ambiguity cannot be resolved otherwise. The [[defective script|"defective" spelling]] is recommended for a fully vocalized text, hence its use is becoming rare. Texts older than 50–60 years may be written in an unvocalized ''defective'' spelling (for example, the word ''ħamiším'' "fifty", was written חמשים on banknotes issued in [[Mandatory Palestine]] or the [[Bank of Israel]] in its early days. Today, the common spelling is חמישים). A vocalized ''plene'' spelling system is common in children books, when it is better to accustom the children to the more popular ''plene'' spelling, while still letting them benefit from the vowel dots as a reading aid in early learning stages.

A third system that was endorsed in the past by the Academy of the Hebrew Language as an optimal system, but abandoned due to low popularity, calls for the use of ''ħolám'' (וֹ), ''šurúq'' (וּ), ''dagéš'' in ''Bet'', ''Kaf'' and ''Pe'' (בּ, כּ, פּ vs. ב, כ, פ), ''Šin Smalít'' (שׂ) and ''mappíq'' (הּ), while abandoning all other vowel dots (in everyday writing). According to this system, ''matres lectionis'' are still introduced to mark vowels, but the letter ''Vav'' is used only as a consonant, while its variants ''ħolám'' and ''šurúq'' serve as vowel letters. This system also makes clear distinction between final ''He'' used as a vowel marker (e.g. ילדה {{IPA|/jalˈda/}} "a girl" ) and as a consonant (e.g. ילדהּ {{IPA|/jalˈdah/}} "her child"). This system was never extensively used, and the Academy of the Hebrew Language finally abandoned it in 1992, when new rules were published not assuming any use of vowel dots.

Rules for unvocalized spelling were first issued by the Hebrew Language Committee in 1890 (which became the [[Academy of the Hebrew Language]] in 1953) and formally standardised in 1996. Even though the rules are established, some of the rules and specific spellings are disputed by writers and publishers, who often create their own in-house spelling system. Also, because having two spelling systems within the same language is confusing, some would like to reform it. In 2004, [[Mordechai Mishor]], one of the academy's linguists, proposed in a session of the Academy of the Hebrew Language a modest reform.&lt;ref name="KD"&gt;[http://kdictionaries.com/kdn/kdn12-3spell.html Kernerman Dictionary News • Number 12 • July 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage today==
There are three systems of spelling used for [[Modern Hebrew]].
#'''Ktiv hasar''' ("missing spelling"): This [[defective script]] may be found in the [[Sefer Torah]] read in [[synagogue]]. It is sometimes considered to be [[anachronism|anachronistic]] in everyday life, although it is still sometimes found in newspapers and published books.&lt;ref name="maamarim"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.articles.co.il/print.php?id=46399 |first = Einat |last = Kedem|publisher = articles.co.il |title=כתיב מלא (בעיות), כתיב חסר (היגיון)}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the original Hebrew spelling. It is called the "missing spelling" because it does not use [[niqqud]].
#'''[[Ktiv menuqad]]''' ("dotted spelling" or "vowelized spelling"): This system of spelling is called "vowelized spelling" and "dotted spelling" because unlike "missing spelling," this system shows exactly how the vowels are in addition to using the dots system ("[[niqqud|nekudot]]"). It is rarely used in everyday life. However, it is used wherever someone wants their writings to be clear and unambiguous, such as children books, poetry, language instruction for newcomers, or ambiguous or foreign terms. However, it is very cumbersome and inconvenient in everyday life.
#'''Ktiv male''' or '''[[Ktiv hasar niqqud]]''' ("full spelling" or "spelling lacking niqqud"): This is the dominant system of spelling in Israel, personal correspondence, movie subtitles, etc.&lt;ref name="maamarim" /&gt;  Ktiv Male is created to be a niqqud-less spelling that uses ''matres lectionis'' (consonant that are also used as vowels: [[aleph]], [[He (letter)|he]], waw, yodh) instead of the vowel pointers.

| {{Hebrew|שְׁנַיִם}}
| {{Hebrew|שניים}}
|}

To illustrate the problem with Ktiv haser:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; spelled the same as {{Hebrew|אויר}} -  {{IPA|/U'jar/}} = "was drawn" - in Ktiv menuqad {{Hebrew|אוּיָר}}&lt;br&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; spelled the same as {{Hebrew|חלקה}} -  {{IPA|/ħelˈqa/}} = "land plot" - in Ktiv menuqad {{Hebrew|חֶלְקַה}} &lt;br&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; spelled the same as {{Hebrew|שנים}} -  {{IPA|/ˈʃanim/}} = "years" - in Ktiv menuqad {{Hebrew|שָׁנִים}}

==Usage of multiple systems==
{{multiple image
 | align     = right
 | direction = horizontal
 | header    = Examples
 | header_align = left/right/center
 | header_background = 
 | footer    = 
 | footer_align = left/right/center
 | footer_background = 
 | width     = 
 | image1    = Kosher McDonalds.JPG
 | width1    = 235
 | caption1  = A kosher (הכשר "the Kosher") [[McDonald's]], with the word kosher spelled without niqqud.
 | image2    = Kosher McDonald's restaurant in Ramat-Gan.jpg
 | width2    = 205
 | caption2  = Another kosher (הכּשר "the Kosher") McDonald's, with the word kosher spelled with partial niqqud to reduce ambiguity.
}}
In practice, many times two or more spelling systems are used in one text. The most common example of this is a word may be vowelized (using [[niqqud]], the "dots") partially, for instance with {{Hebrew|אוֹמץ}}, where only the vav ({{Hebrew|ו}}) is vowelized. This clarifies that the vowel is an "o" ({{Hebrew|וֹ}}) and not "u" ({{Hebrew|וּ}}). In addition, 3 letters (historically 6), can take a different sound depending on if there is a dot (called a [[dagesh]]) in the middle of the letter (a [[bet (letter)|bet]], [[Kaph|kaf]], and [[Pe (letter)|pe]]). In full spelling, the dot is not included, regardless if it is making one sound or the other. An example when a mixture of systems would be used is to clarify when the letter is taking a dagesh. An example of this is shown in the adjacent picture, where for the word kosher ({{Hebrew|כָּשֵׁר}} &lt;small&gt;(with niqqud)&lt;/small&gt;, {{hebrew|כשר}} &lt;small&gt;(full spelling)&lt;/small&gt;, {{IPA|/kaˈʃer/}}) may be written as כּשר (a mixture of the two systems) to be unambiguous that it is the letter כּ {{IPA-he|k|}} and not כ {{IPA-he|χ|}}. Words may be written in ''ktiv haser'' ("missing spelling") if it is unambiguous and clear enough (ex. חנכה {{IPA|/[[Hanukkah|ħanuˈka]]/}} instead of the "full" form חנוכה). In this case, the reader deciphers the word mostly by its context.

Also, some words are almost always written in the "missing" form (''ktiv haser'') in everyday life: לא ({{IPA|/lo/}}, no), אמא ({{IPA|/ima/}}, mother), אם ({{IPA|/im/}}, if), and כנרת ({{IPA|/kiˈneret/}}, [[Kinneret (archaeological site)|Kinneret]]).

'''Indian philosophy''' refers to [[Ancient India|ancient]] philosophical traditions of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The principal schools are classified as either [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] or [[Heterodoxy|heterodox]] – [[Āstika and nāstika|āstika or nāstika]] – depending on one of three alternate criteria: whether it believes the [[Vedas]] as a valid source of knowledge; whether the school believes in the premises of [[Brahman]] and [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]; and whether the school believes in afterlife and [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]].&lt;ref&gt;John Bowker, ''Oxford Dictionary of World Religions'', p. 259&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger |title=On Hinduism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c8vRAgAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-936008-6|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="andrew"/&gt;

There are six major schools of orthodox Indian [[Hindu philosophy]]—[[Nyaya]], [[Vaisheshika]], [[Samkhya]], [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]], [[Mīmāṃsā]] and [[Vedanta]], and five major heterodox schools—[[Jainism|Jain]], [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], [[Ajivika]], [[Ajñana]], and [[Cārvāka]]. However, there are other methods of classification; [[Vidyaranya]] for instance identifies sixteen schools of Indian philosophy by including those that belong to the [[Shaivism|Śaiva]] and [[Raseśvara]] traditions.&lt;ref name="cowell"&gt;Cowell and Gough, p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nicholson"&gt;Nicholson, pp. 158-162.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main schools of Indian philosophy were formalised chiefly between 1000 BCE to the early centuries of the [[Common Era]]. Competition and integration between the various schools was intense during their formative years, especially between 800 BCE and 200 CE. Some schools like [[Jainism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Yoga]], Śaiva and [[Vedanta]] survived, but others, like [[Ajñana]], [[Charvaka]] and [[Ājīvika]] did not.

Ancient and medieval era texts of Indian philosophies include extensive discussions on [[Ontology]] ([[metaphysics]], [[Brahman]]-[[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]], [[Sunyata]]-[[Anatta]]), reliable means of knowledge ([[epistemology]], [[Pramana]]s), value system ([[axiology]]) and other topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Roy W.

Indian philosophies share many concepts such as [[dharma]], [[karma]], [[samsara]], [[reincarnation]], [[dukkha]], [[renunciation]], [[meditation]], with almost all of them focussing on the ultimate goal of liberation of the individual through diverse range of spiritual practices ([[moksha]], [[nirvana]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kathleen Kuiper |title=The Culture of India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c8PJFLeURhsC |year=2010|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group |isbn=978-1-61530-149-2 |pages=174–178 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They differ in their assumptions about the nature of existence as well as the specifics of the path to the ultimate liberation, resulting in numerous schools that disagreed with each other. Their ancient doctrines span the diverse range of philosophies found in other ancient cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sue Hamilton |title=Indian Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YWu4ygkh_O8C |year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-157942-4 |pages=1–17, 136–140 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orthodox schools==
{{Main|Hindu philosophy|Hinduism|Vedas|Upanishads}}
[[File:Raja Ravi Varma - Sankaracharya.jpg|thumb|left|Hindu philosophy has a diversity of traditions and numerous saints and scholars, such as Adi Shankara of Advaita Vedanta school.]]
Many [[Hinduism|Hindu]] intellectual traditions were classified during the medieval period of Brahmanic-Sanskritic scholasticism into a standard list of six orthodox ([[Astika]]) schools ([[Hindu philosophy|darshana]]s), the "Six Philosophies" (''{{IAST|ṣaḍ-darśana}}''), all of which accept the testimony of the [[Vedas]].&lt;ref&gt;Flood, op. cit., p. 231–232.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michaels, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Nicholson|2010}}
* [[Samkhya]], the rationalism school with dualism and atheistic themes&lt;ref&gt;Mike Burley (2012), Classical Samkhya and Yoga - An Indian Metaphysics of Experience, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415648875}}, pages 43-46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tom Flynn and Richard Dawkins (2007), The New Encyclopedia of Unbelief, Prometheus, {{ISBN|978-1591023913}}, pages 420-421&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]], a school similar to Samkhya but accepts personally defined theistic themes&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Bryant (2011, Rutgers University), [http://www.iep.utm.edu/yoga/ ''The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali''] IEP&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Nyaya]], the realism school emphasizing analytics and logic&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/perception-india/ Nyaya Realism], in Perceptual Experience and Concepts in Classical Indian Philosophy, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/423058/Nyaya Nyaya: Indian Philosophy] Encyclopædia Britannica (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Vaisheshika]], the naturalism school with atomistic themes and related to the Nyaya school&lt;ref&gt;Dale Riepe (1996), Naturalistic Tradition in Indian Thought, {{ISBN|978-8120812932}}, pages 227-246&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/early-modern-india/#VaiAto Analytical philosophy in early modern India] J Ganeri, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Purva Mimamsa]] (or simply Mimamsa), the ritualism school with Vedic exegesis and philology emphasis,&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Leaman (2006), Shruti, in ''Encyclopaedia of Asian Philosophy'', Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415862530}}, page 503&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/383181/Mimamsa Mimamsa] Encyclopædia Britannica (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; and
* [[Vedanta]] (also called Uttara Mimamsa), the [[Upanishad]]ic tradition, with many sub-schools ranging from dualism to nondualism.&lt;ref&gt;JN Mohanty (2001), Explorations in Philosophy, Vol 1 (Editor: Bina Gupta), Oxford University Press, page 107-108&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Leaman (2000), Eastern Philosophy: Key Readings, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415173582}}, page 251;&lt;br /&gt;R Prasad (2009), A Historical-developmental Study of Classical Indian Philosophy of Morals, Concept Publishing, {{ISBN|978-8180695957}}, pages 345-347&lt;/ref&gt;

These are often coupled into three groups for both historical and conceptual reasons: Nyaya-Vaishesika, Samkhya-Yoga, and Mimamsa-Vedanta. The Vedanta school is further divided into six sub-schools: [[Advaita Vedanta|Advaita]] ([[monism]]/[[nondualism]]), also includes the concept of [[Ajativada]], [[Visishtadvaita]] (monism of the qualified whole), [[Dvaita]] ([[Dualistic cosmology#In Hinduism|dualism]]), [[Dvaitadvaita]] (dualism-nondualism), [[Suddhadvaita]], and [[Achintya Bheda Abheda]] schools.

Besides these schools Mādhava Vidyāraṇya also includes the following of the aforementioned theistic philosophies based on the Agamas and Tantras:&lt;ref name="cowell"/&gt;

* [[Pasupata]], school of Shaivism by Nakulisa
* [[Shaiva Siddhanta|Saiva]], the theistic Sankhya school
* [[Pratyabhijna|Pratyabhijña]], the recognitive school
* [[Raseśvara]], the mercurial school
* [[Pāṇini]] Darśana, the grammarian school (which clarifies the theory of [[Sphoṭa]])

The systems mentioned here are not the only orthodox systems, they are the chief ones, and there are other orthodox schools. These systems, accept the authority of [[Vedas]] and are regarded as orthodox ([[astika]]) schools of Hindu philosophy; besides these, schools that do not accept the authority of the Vedas are heterodox (nastika) systems such as Buddhism, Jainism, Ajivika and Cārvāka.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Perrett (2000), Indian Philosophy, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0815336112}}, page 88&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sushil Mittal &amp; Gene Thursby (2004), The Hindu World, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415772273}}, pages 729-730&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Flood|1996|pp=82, 224–49}} This orthodox-heterodox terminology is a construct of Western languages, and lacks scholarly roots in Sanskrit. According to Andrew Nicholson, there have been various [[Heresiology|heresiological]] translations of Āstika and Nāstika in 20th century literature on Indian philosophies, but quite many are unsophisticated and flawed.&lt;ref name="andrew"&gt;Andrew J. Nicholson (2013), [[Unifying Hinduism|Unifying Hinduism: Philosophy and Identity in Indian Intellectual History]], Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|978-0231149877}}, Chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Cārvāka]] / Charvaka is a [[materialism|materialistic]] and [[atheistic]] school of thought and, is noteworthy as evidence of a [[atheism in Hinduism|materialistic movement]] within [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref&gt;Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and Charles A. Moore. ''A Sourcebook in Indian Philosophy'249. {{ISBN|0-691-01958-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heterodox (Śramaṇic schools)==
{{Main|Śramaṇa}}
Several [[Śramaṇa|Śramaṇic movements]] have existed before the 6th century BCE, and these influenced both the [[āstika and nāstika]] traditions of Indian philosophy.&lt;ref name=reginaldray247&gt;Reginald Ray (1999), Buddhist Saints in India, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195134834}}, pages 237-240, 247-249&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Śramaṇa|Śramaṇa movement]] gave rise to diverse range of heterodox beliefs, ranging from accepting or denying the concept of soul, atomism, antinomian ethics, materialism, atheism, agnosticism, fatalism to free will, idealization of extreme asceticism to that of family life, strict [[ahimsa]] (non-violence) and vegetarianism to permissibility of violence and meat-eating.&lt;ref&gt;Padmanabh S Jaini (2001), Collected papers on Buddhist Studies, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120817760}}, pages 57-77&lt;/ref&gt; Notable philosophies that arose from [[Śramaṇa|Śramaṇic]] movement were [[Jainism]], [[Pre-sectarian Buddhism|early Buddhism]], [[Cārvāka]], [[Ajñana]] and [[Ājīvika]].&lt;ref&gt;AL Basham (1951), History and Doctrines of the Ajivikas - a Vanished Indian Religion, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120812048}}, pages 94-103&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ajñana philosophy===
{{Main|Ajñana}}
Ajñana was one of the nāstika or "heterodox" schools of ancient Indian philosophy, and the ancient school of radical Indian skepticism. It was a Śramaṇa movement and a major rival of early Buddhism and Jainism. They have been recorded in Buddhist and Jain texts. They held that it was impossible to obtain knowledge of metaphysical nature or ascertain the truth value of philosophical propositions; and even if knowledge was possible, it was useless and disadvantageous for final salvation. They were sophists who specialised in refutation without propagating any positive doctrine of their own.

===Jain philosophy===
{{Main|Jain philosophy|Jainism}}
[[File:Photo of lord adinath bhagwan at kundalpur.JPG|thumb|left|[[Rishabhanatha]], believed to have lived over a million years ago, is considered the founder of Jain philosophy.]]

[[Jain]] philosophy is the oldest Indian philosophy that separates body ([[matter]]) from the [[soul]] (consciousness) completely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/dravya|title=dravya – Jainism|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jainism]] was revived and re-established after [[Mahavira]], the last and the 24th ''[[Tirthankara]]'', synthesised and revived the philosophies and promulgations of the ancient Śramaṇic traditions laid down by the first Jain tirthankara [[Rishabhanatha]] millions of years ago.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.in/books?id=SXgEfiNY46sC&amp;pg=PA271&amp;dq=Rushabhdev+millions&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi4_Z-g387ZAhXGgrwKHW6yDJUQ6AEIKTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Rushabhdev%20millions&amp;f=fals&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dundas, outside of the Jain tradition, historians date the Mahavira as about contemporaneous with the [[Buddha]] in the 5th-century BC, and accordingly the historical [[Parshvanatha]], based on the c. 250-year gap, is placed in 8th or 7th century BC.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=30–31}}

Jainism is a Śramaṇic religion and rejected the authority of the Vedas. However, like all [[Indian religions]], it shares the core concepts such as karma, ethical living, rebirth, samsara and moksha. Jainism places strong emphasis on [[asceticism]], [[ahimsa]] (non-violence) and [[anekantavada]] (relativity of viewpoints) as a means of spiritual liberation, ideas that influenced other Indian traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jay L. Garfield |author2=William Edelglass |title=The Oxford Handbook of World Philosophy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I0iMBtaSlHYC |year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-532899-8 |pages=168 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Jainism strongly upholds the individualistic nature of soul and personal responsibility for one's decisions; and that self-reliance and individual efforts alone are responsible for one's liberation. According to the Jain philosophy, the world (''[[Saṃsāra (Jainism)|Saṃsāra]]'') is full of ''hiṃsā'' (violence). Therefore, one should direct all his efforts in attainment of [[Ratnatraya]], that are Samyak Darshan, Samyak Gnana, and Samyak Chàritra which are the key requisites to attain liberation.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.in/books?id=4K9GDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=Samyak+darshan+Samyak+gnana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjtx9eU3s7ZAhVTObwKHc6sDnQQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Samyak%20darshan%20Samyak%20gnana&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhist philosophy===
{{Main|Buddhist philosophy|Early Buddhism}}
[[File:Gandhara Buddha (tnm).jpeg|thumb|upright=0.85|The Buddhist philosophy is based on the teachings of the [[Buddha]].]]
Buddhist philosophy is a system of thought which started with the teachings of [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhartha Gautama]], [[Buddhahood|the Buddha]], or "awakened one". Buddhism is founded on elements of the [[Śramaṇa|Śramaṇa movement]], which flowered in the first half of the 1st millennium BCE, but its foundations contain novel ideas not found or accepted by other Sramana movements.

Buddhism shares many philosophical views with other Indian systems, such as belief in ''[[Karma in Buddhism|karma]]'' – a cause-and-effect relationship, [[samsara]] – ideas about cyclic afterlife and rebirth, [[dharma]] – ideas about ethics, duties and values, [[impermanence]] of all material things and of body, and possibility of spiritual liberation ([[nirvana]] or [[moksha]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian K.

===Ājīvika philosophy===
{{Main|Ājīvika}}
The philosophy of Ājīvika was founded by [[Makkhali Gosala]], it was a [[Śramaṇa|Śramaṇa movement]] and a major rival of [[early Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey D Long (2009), Jainism: An Introduction, Macmillan, {{ISBN|978-1845116255}}, page 199&lt;/ref&gt; Ājīvikas were organised renunciates who formed discrete monastic communities prone to an ascetic and simple lifestyle.{{sfn|Basham|1951|pp=145-146}}

Original scriptures of the Ājīvika school of philosophy may once have existed, but these are currently unavailable and probably lost. Their theories are extracted from mentions of Ajivikas in the secondary sources of ancient Indian literature, particularly those of Jainism and Buddhism which polemically criticized the Ajivikas.{{sfn|Basham|1951|loc=Chapter 1}} The Ājīvika school is known for its ''Niyati'' doctrine of absolute determinism (fate), the premise that there is no free will, that everything that has happened, is happening and will happen is entirely preordained and a function of cosmic principles.{{sfn|Basham|1951|loc=Chapter 1}}&lt;ref name="james22"/&gt; Ājīvika considered the [[karma]] doctrine as a fallacy.&lt;ref name="philtarajiv"/&gt; Ājīvikas were atheists&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Quack (2014), The Oxford Handbook of Atheism (Editors: Stephen Bullivant, Michael Ruse), Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199644650}}, page 654&lt;/ref&gt; and rejected the authority of the [[Vedas]], but they believed that in every living being is an ''[[Ātman (Hinduism)|ātman]]'' – a central premise of Hinduism and Jainism.&lt;ref&gt;Analayo (2004), Satipaṭṭhāna: The Direct Path to Realization, {{ISBN|978-1899579549}}, pages 207-208&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Basham|1951|pp=240-261, 270-273}}

===Cārvāka philosophy===
{{Main|Cārvāka}}
Cārvāka or Lokāyata was a philosophy of [[Philosophical skepticism|scepticism]] and [[materialism]], founded in the [[Mauryan]] period. They were extremely critical of other schools of philosophy of the time. Cārvāka deemed Vedas to be tainted by the three faults of untruth, self-contradiction, and tautology.&lt;ref name="page4"&gt;Cowell and Gough, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise they faulted Buddhists and Jains, mocking the concept of [[Nirvana|liberation]], [[reincarnation]] and accumulation of [[Merit (Buddhism)|merit]] or demerit through karma.&lt;ref&gt;Bhattacharya, Ramkrishna. [http://www.carvaka4india.com/2011/08/materialism-in-india-synoptic-view.html Materialism in India: A Synoptic View]. Retrieved 27 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; They believed that, the viewpoint of relinquishing pleasure to avoid pain was the "reasoning of fools".&lt;ref name="page4"/&gt;

==Comparison of Indian philosophies==
The Indian traditions subscribed to diverse philosophies, significantly disagreeing with each other as well as orthodox Hinduism and its six schools of [[Hindu philosophy]]. The differences ranged from a belief that every individual has a soul (self, atman) to asserting that there is no soul,&lt;ref name=5sources/&gt; from axiological merit in a frugal ascetic life to that of a hedonistic life, from a belief in rebirth to asserting that there is no rebirth.&lt;ref name=collins&gt;{{cite book|author1=Randall Collins|title=The sociology of philosophies: a global theory of intellectual change|year=2000|publisher=Harvard University Press|pages=199–200|isbn=9780674001879|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2HS1DOZ35EgC&amp;pg=PA199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political philosophy==
The [[Arthashastra]], attributed to the [[Mauryan]] minister [[Chanakya]], is one of the early Indian texts devoted to [[political philosophy]]. It is dated to 4th century BCE and discusses ideas of statecraft and economic policy.

The political philosophy most closely associated with modern India is the one of [[ahimsa]] (non-violence) and [[Satyagraha]], popularised by [[Mahatma Gandhi]] during the [[Indian independence movement|Indian struggle for independence]]. In turn it influenced the later movements for independence and civil rights, especially those led by [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and [[Nelson Mandela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weber|first=Thomas|title=Gandhi as Disciple and Mentor|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P8nC80pG4GIC&amp;pg=PA136|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-45657-9|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
In appreciation of complexity of the Indian philosophy, [[T. S. Eliot|T S Eliot]] wrote that the great philosophers of India "make most of the great European philosophers look like schoolboys".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/ew33375.htm |title= The Hidden Advantage of Tradition: On the Significance of T.

'''Infant Potty Training''' is both the name of a means of [[toilet training]] and the title of a book by author Laurie Boucke. The complete book title is ''Infant Potty Training: A Gentle and Primeval Method Adapted to Modern Living''. It is an expansion of ideas that were originally presented in a small self-published volume called ''Trickle Treat'' in 1991. ''Infant Potty Training'' was first published in 2000, is now in its third edition (2008), and has editions in [[German language|German]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. Infant potty training is traditionally used in at least 80 countries.

Boucke's method of infant potty training is based on an ancient&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/hraf/|title=Yale University Human Relations Area Files}}&lt;/ref&gt; means of toilet training stemming from cultures that don't use [[diapers]] and washing machines, and that has been adapted to a modern [[urban area|urban]] lifestyle in various ways, including the use of a potty or [[toilet]], part-time pottying and part-time diapering. Instead of always letting a baby eliminate in a diaper, parents start to offer some potty or toilet visits, usually at a much earlier age than with contemporary toilet training.

== Overview of the book ==

The book consists of four parts:

* Part I is a how-to guide that also includes chapters on current [[medical]] research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=DetailsSearch&amp;term=boucke+rugolotto&amp;log$=activity|title=Recent medical journal articles}}&lt;/ref&gt;  on infant potty training, [[historical]] writings, [[Natural environment|environmental]] considerations, and diapers.
* Part II gives detailed [[testimonials]] by experienced parents in the United States.
* Part III consists of testimonials from 13 other countries.
* Part IV covers [[cross-cultural studies]] in the form of [[anthropological]] reports from many different societies and cultures in [[Asia]], [[Africa]], the [[Arctic]] Regions and the [[Americas]].

== Synopsis of the practice ==

The key is to create cue [[association (psychology)|associations]] that can be used as a means of [[communication]]. This is done by learning and responding to [[body language]] and vocalizations, as well as to elimination timing and patterns. As a child matures, he starts to intentionally signal about his toilet needs. As with other means of toilet training, there is no fixed length or guaranteed outcome. 
The four main steps for beginners are:
* Observation/Familiarization
Parents watch and take note of the child's:

:*Timing (Elimination frequency in relation to waking and feeding)
:*Body language (Example: grimacing)
:*Sounds (Example: grunting)

* Anticipation/[[intuition (knowledge)|Intuition]]
Parents anticipate when the child needs to go, then at that moment, give a cue signal (a sound, hand signal, word or phrase). The child will associate these with potty time.
* Position/Location
After establishing a comfortable position—whether it be in-arms for an infant or on a potty or toilet for a toddler — the same position and location are used for a while, and the child associates these with potty time.
* Reciprocal Communication
As the child matures, natural bodily and vocal communication expands to include intentional communication in various forms such as the use of sign language or other hand signals, vocalizations, words, and phrases. Parents continue to communicate through manual and audible signals.

== History ==

Variations of infant potty training have been used in non-[[Western culture|Western]] societies for centuries, and this information has been passed down both orally&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin, Grenville (1942). The Social Organization of the Western Apache. Univ of Chicago Press. pp xv, 446. {{ISBN|978-0-8165-0194-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later in writing.&lt;ref&gt;Fontanel, Beatrice (1997).  Babies: History, Art, and Folklore. Harry N Abrams. pp 156, 163-165. {{ISBN|978-0-8109-1244-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A hindrance to the acceptance of the practice in modern Western societies for some years was the misconception that infant potty training is the same as a somewhat harsh and coercive method used in the early 1900s in [[Europe]] and [[North America]] that used suppositories to put the baby on a strict schedule of bowel movements. This harsh toilet training method is described in the 1929 and 1935 editions of ''Infant Care'', a [[US Department of Labor]], [[United States Children's Bureau|Children's Bureau]] publication. However, gentler methods that did not rely on suppositories were recommended in the 1914 and 1938 and later editions of ''Infant Care''. Though a regulated schedule was valued in many parts of infant care including toilet training, at no time was punishment considered appropriate for an infant under one year of age.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mchlibrary.info/history/chbu/parents.html Children's Bureau Historical Publications], United States Department of Labor (1914-1938). Infant Care. Children's Bureau Publication.&lt;/ref&gt; Boucke's method of infant potty training focuses on learning and responding to the child’s natural elimination timing and signals rather than trying to institute a strict schedule.

The '''International Association of Women’s Museums''' (IAWM) is an organisation with its foundation office in [[Bonn]] ([[Germany]]) and its administrative office in [[Merano]] ([[Italy]]). The network was founded in 2008 in [[Merano]] and transformed into an association in [[Alice Springs]] ([[Australia]]) in 2012. It has the goal to connect women’s museums worldwide and to advocate for their interests.

IAWM is led by six board members from different continents. The chairwoman is currently Mona Holm from Norway and the coordinator of the network is Astrid Schönweger from Italy.&lt;ref name=reference/&gt;

== Goals ==
IAWM’s goal is to promote culture, arts, education and training from a gender perspective. Furthermore, the association wants to foster exchange, networking, mutual support and global cooperation among Women's Museums. Conducting research and the development of projects, exhibitions, new initiatives, community activities, seminars and conferences is another goal. IAWM is also working to promote and strengthen the acceptance of women’s museums, to promote their global cooperation and mutual support, and to achieve international recognition in the world of museums. The membership of women’s and gender museums worldwide and is advocating for women’s rights and a gender-democratic society.&lt;ref name=reference/&gt;

The association works as juncture network and as a central contact point for mediation for women’s museums and initiatives. It monitors women’s museums and initiatives worldwide.&lt;ref name="reference"&gt;[http://iawm.international/about-us-2/whoweare/] Website of International Association of Women's Museums (IAWM)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities of IAWM ==
* Monitoring
** The association provides a database of women's museums worldwide and
** promotes and disseminates activities and exhibitions of women's museums.
* Networking
** IAWM regularly organizes international congresses and
** reaches out to other networks for collaboration
* Cooperating
** The network brings together women’s museums for cooperation and collective projects, such as the [http://www.she-culture.com/en/ EU-project She Culture];
** It promotes exchange and cooperation with other women's or gender and museum networks.

== History of women’s museums ==
Today women’s museums exist on every continent. They have originated mostly independently from each other. Women’s museums of the USA and Europe have their origin in the period of the [[second-wave feminism]] and its new understanding of history as [[Women's history|gender history]]. Likewise, the museums of other continents have their roots in modern feminism. They want to provide insight into female history, culture or art to an interested public.&lt;ref&gt;Petra Kanzleiter, „Frauenmuseen in aller Welt,“ in: Astrid Schönweger (Ed.), ''Von Schönheit, Alltag und Arbeit. Das Frauenmuseum Meran erzählt,'' Innsbruck: Studienverlag, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Women’s museums are important for women’s education, empowerment, and self-confidence. They provide awareness training, possibilities for independent actions, and tools to overcome discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;Schönweger, Astrid, "The Women’s Museum’s Network. The Challenges and Future of Women’s Museums, Using the Example of the Meran Women’s Museum", in: Elke Krasny, ''Women's Museum'', Frauenmuseum Meran 2013, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of IAWM ==
The association IAWM emerged from the Network of Women’s Museums, which was founded in [[Merano]], [[Italy]] in 2008. The [[Women's Museum Meran|Women’s Museum in Merano]] and [[Henriette-Bathily Women's Museum|Senegal]] organised the first congress, where 25 women’s museums from all five continents joined for a meeting. The Iranian Nobel Peace Prize Winner (2003) [[Shirin Ebadi]] was invited to take over the role of the godmother of the congress and thereafter, she became the permanent godmother of the network. She said, "The women are the ones who write the history of the world! There has to be a women’s museum in every country of the world!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.frauenmuseum.de/upload/dateien/weltweit/de_Resolution_2012deutsch.pdf|title=Resolution IAWM|last=Ebadi|first=Shirin|date=2008|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This quote became the motto of the network.

Finally, the association was founded at the 4th International Congress Of Women’s Museums in [[Alice Springs]], [[Australia]] in 2012.

Since then, international congresses take place every four years and, if desired, continental congresses are organised in between.

'''Jacques Heim''' (8 May 1899 – 8 January 1967) was a [[France|French]] fashion designer and costume designer for theater and film, and was a manufacturer of women's [[fur clothing|furs]]. From 1930 to his death in 1967, he ran the fashion house (''maison de [[Haute couture|couture]]'') ''Jacques Heim'', which closed in 1969. He was president of the [[Paris]] ''[[haute couture|Chambre Syndicale de la haute couture]]'' from 1958 to 1962,&lt;ref name=FE /&gt; a period of transition from ''[[haute couture]]'' to [[ready-to-wear]] clothing.

==Early life==
Jacques Heim was born in Paris. His parents were Isadore and Jeanne Heim, Jews of Polish origin. 

==Career==
In the early 1920s, Heim started working in his parents' fur business, which they had founded in 1898.&lt;ref name=FE&gt;[http://www.fashionencyclopedia.com/Ha-Ja/Heim-Jacques.html Jacques Heim] at FashionEncyclopedia.com&lt;/ref&gt; He took over the business in 1923, and within a few years had added a couture department,&lt;ref name=VFG&gt;[http://vintagefashionguild.org/label-resource/heim-jacques/ Jacques Heim] at Vintage Fashion Guild&lt;/ref&gt; designing dresses and coats, made with original fabrics, working in collaboration with [[Sonia Delaunay]]. In 1930, the workshop became the fashion house ''Jacques Heim''. He also made ready-to-wear and in 1936 started a line for younger women, ''Heim Jeunes Filles''.&lt;ref name=VFG /&gt; In 1932, Heim created a two-piece swimsuit consisting of a bra with ruffles and pretty bloomers, which he called the ''Atome''. However, women were not yet ready to reveal their midriff, with only a few daring to wear his swimsuit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toutenparfum.com/historique/heim/jacques_heim.en.php Jacques Heim] at Toutenparfum.com&lt;/ref&gt;

He was harassed during the [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|Nazi occupation of France]], but managed to stay in business by putting a non-Jewish "front man" in charge of his fashion house.&lt;ref name=Jweekly&gt;{{cite web| website= The Jewish News Weekly of Northern California| publisher= San Francisco Jewish Community Publications Inc.|date= 21 July 2006 |last=Bloom|first=Nate| title= Celebrity Jews|url= http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/29849/celebrity-jews/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an active member of the [[French resistance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1961&amp;dat=19670110&amp;id=SKskAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=PaEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4302,4934249 |title= French Coutourier Jacques Heim Dies |work= Palm Beach Daily News| agency= UPI | page=3 | date= 10 January 1967 | accessdate= 31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946 Heim started a chain of sportswear boutiques. In June 1946, he relaunched his two-piece swimsuit, the ''Atome'', which he advertised as "the world's smallest bathing suit." However, on 5 July 1946, [[Louis Réard]], a French engineer, had a Paris stripper pose before reporters in an even briefer two-piece swimsuit, which Réard called the [[Bikini]], and which he promoted as "smaller than the smallest bathing suit". Réard's design, unlike Heim's, for the first time presented a female swimsuit with the [[navel exposure|navel exposed]]. Though financially successful, the bikini was very controversial.

The modern study of '''Japanese [[aesthetics]]''' only started a little over two hundred years ago in the West. The Japanese aesthetic is a set of ancient ideals that include ''[[Wabi-sabi|wabi]]'' (transient and stark beauty), ''[[Wabi-sabi|sabi]]'' (the beauty of natural patina and aging), and ''[[yūgen]]'' (profound grace and subtlety).&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/japanese-aesthetics | title=Japanese Aesthetics (Stanford Encyclopedia of philosophy) | accessdate=2009-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ideals, and others, underpin much of Japanese cultural and aesthetic norms on what is considered [[Taste (sociology)|tasteful]] or [[beauty|beautiful]]. Thus, while seen as a [[philosophy]] in Western societies, the concept of aesthetics in Japan is seen as an integral part of daily life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aesthetics-online.org/articles/index.php?articles_id=3 |title=Teaching Japanese Aesthetics |accessdate=2008-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202060957/http://www.aesthetics-online.org/articles/index.php?articles_id=3 |archivedate=2008-12-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese aesthetics now encompass a variety of ideals; some of these are traditional while others are modern and sometimes influenced by other cultures.&lt;ref name="stanford"/&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With its emphasis on the wholeness of nature and character in ethics, and its celebration of the landscape, it sets the tone for Japanese aesthetics. Nevertheless, Japanese aesthetic ideals are most heavily influenced by [[Japanese Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.art.unt.edu/ntieva/download/teaching/Curr_resources/mutli_culture/Japan/Aesthetics/Japanese%20Aesthetics_Wabi-Sabi_Tea%20Ceremony.pdf | title=Japanese Aesthetics, Wabi-Sabi, and the Tea Ceremony | accessdate=2008-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Buddhist tradition, all things are considered as either evolving from or dissolving into nothingness.  This "nothingness" is not empty space. It is rather a space of potentiality.&lt;ref name="Koren"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the seas represent potential then each thing is like a wave arising from it and returning to it. There are no permanent waves. At no point is a wave complete, even at its peak. Nature is seen as a dynamic whole that is to be admired and appreciated. This appreciation of nature has been fundamental to many Japanese aesthetic ideals, "arts," and other cultural elements. In this respect, the notion of "[[art]]" (or its conceptual equivalent) is also quite different from Western traditions (see [[Japanese art]]).

==Wabi-sabi==
{{main|Wabi-sabi}}
[[File:Castle Himeji sakura02.jpg|thumb|210px|[[Hanami]] ("blossom viewing") parties at [[Himeji Castle]]]]

Wabi and sabi refers to a mindful approach to everyday life. Over time their meanings overlapped and converged until they are unified into ''Wabi-sabi'', the aesthetic defined as the beauty of things "imperfect, impermanent, and incomplete".&lt;ref name="Koren"/&gt; Things in bud, or things in decay, as it were, are more evocative of wabi-sabi than things in full bloom because they suggest the transience of things. As things come and go, they show signs of their coming or going, and these signs are considered to be beautiful. In this, beauty is an altered state of consciousness and can be seen in the mundane and simple. The signatures of nature can be so subtle that it takes a quiet mind and a cultivated eye to discern them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nobleharbor.com/tea/chado/WhatIsWabi-Sabi.htm | title = What Is Wabi-Sabi? | accessdate=2007-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Zen]] philosophy there are seven aesthetic principles for achieving Wabi-Sabi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://bonsaibeautiful.com/nature_of_garden_art/japanese/index.html | title = The nature of garden art | accessdate=2008-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Fukinsei''' (不均斉): asymmetry, irregularity;

'''Kanso''' (簡素): simplicity;

'''Koko''' (考古): basic, weathered;

'''Shizen''' (自然): without pretense, natural;

'''Yugen''' (幽玄): subtly profound grace, not obvious;

'''Datsuzoku''' (脱俗): unbounded by convention, free;

'''Seijaku''' (静寂): tranquility, silence.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Each of these things are found in nature but can suggest virtues of human character and appropriateness of behaviour. This, in turn suggests that virtue and civility can be instilled through an appreciation of, and practice in, the arts. Hence, aesthetic ideals have an ethical connotation and pervades much of the Japanese culture.&lt;ref name="Carter"&gt;{{cite book|title=Japanese arts and self-cultivation|last=Carter|first=Robert E.|publisher=SUNY Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-7914-7254-5|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Miyabi ==
{{main|Miyabi}}
[[File:Kinkaku Snow E4.jpg|thumb|160px|The Temple of the Golden Pavilion (''[[Kinkaku-ji]]'')]]
Miyabi (雅) is one of the oldest of the traditional Japanese aesthetic ideals, though perhaps not as prevalent as Iki or Wabi-sabi. In modern Japanese, the word is usually translated as "elegance," "refinement," or "courtliness" and sometimes referred to as "heart-breaker".

The aristocratic ideal of Miyabi demanded the elimination of anything that was absurd or vulgar and the "polishing of manners, diction, and feelings to eliminate all roughness and crudity so as to achieve the highest grace." It expressed that sensitivity to beauty which was the hallmark of the [[Heian era]]. Miyabi is often closely connected to the notion of [[Mono no aware]], a bittersweet awareness of the transience of things, and thus it was thought that things in decline showed a great sense of miyabi.

==Shibui==
[[File:Hagi ware Japanese tea bowl, 18th-19th century, Freer Gallery of Art.jpg|left|150px|thumb|An 18th century [[Chawan|tea bowl]], exhibiting the aesthetics of Shibui]]
{{main|Shibui}}
Shibui (渋い) (adjective), shibumi (渋み) (noun), or shibusa (渋さ) (noun) are Japanese words which refer to a particular aesthetic or beauty of simple, subtle, and unobtrusive beauty. Originating in the Muromachi period (1336–1392) as shibushi, the term originally referred to a sour or astringent taste, such as that of an unripe persimmon. Shibui maintains that literal meaning still, and remains the antonym of amai (甘い), meaning 'sweet'. Like other Japanese aesthetic terms, such as iki and wabi-sabi, shibui can apply to a wide variety of subjects, not just art or fashion. Shibusa includes the following essential qualities. (1) Shibui objects appear to be simple overall but they include subtle details, such as textures, that balance simplicity with complexity. (2) This balance of simplicity and complexity ensures that one does not tire of a shibui object but constantly finds new meanings and enriched beauty that cause its aesthetic value to grow over the years. (3) Shibusa is not to be confused with wabi or sabi. Though many wabi or sabi objects are shibui, not all shibui objects are wabi or sabi. Wabi or sabi objects can be more severe and sometimes exaggerate intentional imperfections to such an extent that they can appear to be artificial. Shibui objects are not necessarily imperfect or asymmetrical, though they can include these qualities. (4) Shibusa walks a fine line between contrasting aesthetic concepts such as elegant and rough or spontaneous and restrained.

==Iki==
{{main|Iki (aesthetics)}}
Iki (いき, often written 粋) is a traditional aesthetic ideal in Japan. The basis of iki is thought to have formed among urbane mercantile class (Chōnin) in Edo in the Tokugawa period (1603–1868). Iki is an expression of simplicity, sophistication, spontaneity, and originality. It is ephemeral, straightforward, measured, and unselfconscious. Iki is not overly refined, pretentious, complicated. Iki may signify a personal trait, or artificial phenomena exhibiting human will or consciousness. Iki is not used to describe natural phenomena, but may be expressed in human appreciation of natural beauty, or in the nature of human beings.  The phrase ''iki'' is generally used in Japanese culture to describe qualities that are aesthetically appealing and when applied to a person, what they do, or have, constitutes a high compliment. ''Iki'' is not found in nature. While similar to ''wabi-sabi'' in that it disregards perfection, ''iki'' is a broad term that encompasses various characteristics related to refinement with flair. The tasteful manifestation of sensuality can be ''iki''. Etymologically, iki has a root that means pure and unadulterated. However, it also carries a connotation of having an appetite for life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://global.mitsubishielectric.com/tasteofjapan/imprints/iki/index01_b.html |title=Taste of Japan |accessdate=2007-04-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070430105206/http://global.mitsubishielectric.com/tasteofjapan/imprints/iki/index01_b.html |archivedate=2007-04-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Jo-ha-kyū ==
{{main|Jo-ha-kyū}}
Jo-ha-kyū (序破急) is a concept of modulation and movement applied in a wide variety of traditional Japanese arts. Roughly translated to "beginning, break, rapid", it implies a tempo that begins slowly, accelerates, and then ends swiftly. This concept is applied to elements of the Japanese tea ceremony, to kendō, to the traditional theatre, to [[Gagaku]], and to the traditional collaborative linked verse forms renga and renku (haikai no renga).&lt;ref&gt;Zeami. "Teachings on Style and the Flower (''[[Fūshikaden]]'')." from [[J. Thomas Rimer|Rimer]] &amp; Yamazaki. ''On the Art of the Nō Drama''. p20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yūgen==
[[File:hokusai-fuji-koryuu.png|thumb|upright|130px|''The Dragon of Smoke Escaping from Mt Fuji'', [[Hokusai]]]]
{{nihongo|Yūgen|幽玄|}} is an important concept in traditional Japanese aesthetics. The exact translation of the word depends on the context. In the Chinese philosophical texts the term was taken from, yūgen meant "dim", "deep" or "mysterious". In the criticism of Japanese [[Waka (poetry)|waka]] poetry, it was used to describe the subtle profundity of things that are only vaguely suggested by the poems, and was also the name of a style of poetry (one of the ten orthodox styles delineated by [[Fujiwara no Teika]] in his treatises).

Yūgen suggests that which is beyond what can be said, but it is not an allusion to another world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/dspace/bitstream/1808/1139/1/CEAS.1971.n10.pdf | title = Zeami and the Transition of the Concept of Yūgen | accessdate=2008-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is about this world, this experience. All of these are portals to yūgen:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"To watch the sun sink behind a flower clad hill.
To wander on in a huge forest without thought of return.
To stand upon the shore and gaze after a boat that disappears behind distant islands.
To contemplate the flight of wild geese seen and lost among the clouds.
And, subtle shadows of bamboo on bamboo." [[Zeami Motokiyo]]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Zeami was the originator of the dramatic art form [[Noh theatre]] and wrote the classic book on dramatic theory (Kadensho). He uses images of nature as a constant metaphor. For example, "snow in a silver bowl" represents "the Flower of Tranquility". Yūgen is said to mean "a profound, mysterious sense of the beauty of the universe&amp;nbsp;... and the sad beauty of human suffering".&lt;ref&gt;(Ortolani, 325). Ortolani, Benito. The Japanese Theatre. Princeton University Press: Princeton, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to refer to Zeami's interpretation of "refined elegance" in the performance of Noh.&lt;ref name="Yamazaki"&gt;{{cite book

==Geidō==
[[File:Hasegawa Tohaku - Pine Trees (Shōrin-zu byōbu) - right hand screen.jpg|left|thumb|240px|Right panel of the {{nihongo|''Pine Trees screen''|[[Shōrin-zu byōbu]]|松林図 屏風}} by [[Hasegawa Tōhaku]], c.1595]]

{{nihongo|Geidō|芸道|}} refers to the various traditional Japanese arts disciplines: {{nihongo|[[Noh]]|能|}} (theater), {{nihongo|''kadō''|華道|}} ([[Japanese flower arrangement]]), {{nihongo|''shodō''|書道|}} ([[Japanese calligraphy]]), {{nihongo|''Sadō''|茶道|}} ([[Japanese tea ceremony]]), and {{nihongo|''yakimono''|焼物|}} ([[Japanese pottery]]). All of these disciplines carry an ethical and aesthetic connotation and teach an appreciation of the process of creation.&lt;ref name="Carter"/&gt; To introduce discipline into their training, Japanese warriors followed the example of the arts that systematized practice through prescribed forms called [[kata]] - think of the tea ceremony. Training in combat techniques incorporated the way of the arts (Geidō), practice in the arts themselves, and instilling aesthetic concepts (for example, yugen) and the philosophy of arts (geido ron). This led to combat techniques  becoming known as the martial arts (even today, David Lowry shows, in the 'Sword and Brush: the spirit of the martial arts', the affinity of the martial arts with the other arts). All of these arts are a form of tacit communication and we can, and do, respond to them by appreciation of this [[tacit]] dimension.

== Ensō ==
{{main|Ensō}} 
[[File:enso.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Ensō by [[Kanjuro Shibata XX]]&lt;br /&gt;''Enso ca. 2000'']]
Ensō (円相) is a Japanese word meaning "circle". It symbolizes the Absolute, enlightenment, strength, elegance, the Universe, and the void; it also may be taken to symbolize the Japanese aesthetic itself.  Zen Buddhist calligraphists may "believe that the character of the artist is fully exposed in how she or he draws an ensō. Only a person who is mentally and spiritually complete can draw a true ensō. Some artists will practice drawing an ensō daily, as a kind of spiritual exercise."{{attribution needed|date=March 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;Seo, Audrey Yoshiko; Addiss (1998). The Art of Twentieth-Century Zen. Stepen. Boston: Shambhala Publications. {{ISBN|978-1-57062-358-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aesthetics and Japan's cultural identities==
Because of its nature, Japanese aesthetics has a wider relevance than is usually accorded to aesthetics in the West. In her pathmaking book,&lt;ref name="Ikegami"&gt;{{cite book

 | first = Eiko
 | year = 2005
 | title = Bonds of Civility: aesthetic networks and the political origins of Japanese culture
 | publisher = Cambridge University Press

 | isbn = 0-521-60115-0 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eiko Ikegami reveals a complex history of social life in which aesthetic ideals become central to Japan's cultural identities. She shows how networks in the performing arts, the tea ceremony, and poetry shaped tacit cultural practices and how politeness and politics are inseparable. She contends that what in Western cultures are normally scattered, like art and politics, have been, and are, distinctly integrated in Japan.

After the introduction of Western notions in Japan, Wabi Sabi aesthetics ideals have been re-examined with Western values, by both Japanese and non-Japanese. Therefore, recent interpretations of the aesthetics ideals inevitably reflect [[Judeo-Christian]] perspectives and Western philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mongabay.com/reference/country_studies/japan/SOCIETY.html | title=Japan - the society| accessdate=2008-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rath, Stephanie Assmann&lt;/ref&gt; see [[kaiseki]] for a refined expression.

==Kawaii==
{{main|Kawaii}}

A modern phenomenon, since the 1970s [[cuteness]] or {{nihongo||可愛い|'''kawaii'''|"cute", "adorable", "loveable"}} in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] has become a prominent aesthetic of [[Japanese popular culture]], [[entertainment]], [[Japanese street fashion|clothing]], [[Japanese cuisine|food]], [[designer toys|toys]], personal [[Human physical appearance|appearance]], [[behavior]], and mannerisms.&lt;ref&gt;Diana Lee, "[http://uniorb.com/ATREND/Japanwatch/cute.htm Inside Look at Japanese Cute Culture]" (September 1, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

As a cultural phenomenon, [[cuteness]] is increasingly accepted in [[Japan]] as a part of [[Japanese culture]] and national identity. Tomoyuki Sugiyama, author of "[[Cool (aesthetic)|Cool]] Japan", believes that "cuteness" is rooted in Japan's harmony-loving culture, and Nobuyoshi Kurita, a sociology professor at [[Musashi University]] in [[Tokyo]], has stated that "cute" is a "magic term" that encompasses everything that's acceptable and desirable in Japan.&lt;ref name=ap2006&gt;Quotes and paraphrases from: {{cite news|title=Cuteness a hot-selling commodity in Japan|author=Yuri Kageyama|date=June 14, 2006|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/14/AR2006061401122.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kagami mochi by Chuuken Hachigou in GIF.gif|thumb|[[Kagami mochi]]]]
[[File:Chiyoda no on omote Kagamibiraki.jpg|thumb|Kagamibiraki Ceremony in the [[Edo Castle]]]]
'''''Kagami Biraki''''' (鏡開き) is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] traditional ceremony which literally translates to "Opening the Mirror" (from an abstinence) or, also, "Breaking of the [[Mochi]]."  It traditionally falls on January 11 ([[odd numbers]] are associated with being [[luck|good luck]] in [[Japanese culture|Japan]]) It refers to the opening of a [[Kagami mochi]], or to the opening of a cask of [[sake]] at a party or ceremony.
 
==History==
The fourth [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa ''shōgun'']] was the first to hold this ceremony 300 years ago. On the eve of war, he gathered his ''[[daimyō]]'' in his castle to break open a sake cask. Upon achieving victory, a new tradition was born.

==Ceremony==
The ceremony nowadays is also performed at weddings, sporting events, opening days at new companies, and other significant events worthy of being celebrated.

In Japan, mochi was traditionally made at home, but most families today buy it ready-made. Over the holidays, a pair of round mochi ([[kagami mochi]]) the size of small plates – one a little larger than the other – is stacked on a stand and placed in a household [[Shinto]] or [[Buddhist]] [[altar]] or [[tokonoma]] as an offering to the [[deities]] that visit on New Year's. The ornamental mochi is removed on January 11 and broken into smaller pieces before being eaten.

By this time, the kagami mochi is usually quite brittle, and cracks appear on the surface. The mochi is not cut with a knife, since cutting has negative connotations (cutting off ties) and is instead broken with one's hands or a hammer.

Many Japanese [[martial arts]] [[dojo]] use the Kagami Biraki [[ceremony]] to signify their first practice of the [[New Year]].

{{nihongo|'''''Latitude Zero'''''|緯度0大作戦|Ido zero daisakusen}}, is a 1969 [[science fiction film]]. It was directed by [[Ishirō Honda]] and written by Ted Sherdeman, based on his radio serial of the same name.The film stars both American and Japanese actors including [[Joseph Cotten]], [[Cesar Romero]], [[Akira Takarada]], [[Masumi Okada]], [[Richard Jaeckel]], [[Patricia Medina]], and [[Akihiko Hirata]].

==Plot==
Three men (Dr. Ken Tashiro, Dr. Jules Masson, and Perry Lawton) are trapped in a bathysphere due to seismic activity.  They are rescued by the crew of the supersubmarine ''Alpha'', captained by Craig Mackenzie (Cotten), who they learn is over 200 years old (and that the ''Alpha'' was launched in the early 19th century).  Mackenzie takes them to Latitude Zero to deal with the serious injuries of Dr Masson.  While returning to Latitude Zero, they are attacked by a rival supersubmarine, the ''Black Shark'', captained by Kuroi ([[Hikaru Kuroki]]), who works for a rival of Mackenzie, Dr. Malic (Romero), who is also over 200 years old and has a base at Blood Rock.

Latitude Zero is a paradise hidden fifteen miles below the surface at the intersection of the [[Equator]] and the [[International Date Line]]. [[Gold]] is plentiful there and is used for protective clothing by the island's newcomers, while those who arrived in the 19th century prefer to dress as they are accustomed, as no one ages or dies. [[Diamond]]s are very common and used only in industrial use.

Dr. Malic, however, wishes to destroy the paradise of Latitude Zero, and uses giant rats and [[anthropomorphic]] bats in addition to [[James Bond]]-style devices against the undersea kingdom. Worst of all, after a cruel experiment grafting the wings of an [[eagle]] to a [[lion]], he removes the brain of the unsuccessful Kuroi and places her brain in the creature. This proves to be his undoing when, at a critical moment, Kuroi turns against Malic as he prepares to fire an energy cannon at the escaping visitors, causing their destruction.

Of all the visitors to Latitude Zero, only Perry Lawton (Jaeckel), a [[journalist]], wishes to return home.  He is picked up by a US Navy vessel and meets a Commander Glenn Mackenzie (Cotten again), and is put in the care of Lt. Hastings (Romero again).  Horrified at whom he sees, Lawton discovers his film is ruined and when he opens the pouch where he placed his complimentary diamonds, he finds tobacco.  Just as he is about to resign himself to the fact that his adventure never occurred, the ship is wired a message stating that a cache of diamonds has been deposited in his name in a [[safe deposit box]] in [[New York City]].

==Production==
In his autobiography ''Vanity Will Get You Somewhere'', actor [[Joseph Cotten]] stated that the American producer Don Sharp sent the American cast to Japan just as his company was about to go bankrupt.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|1994|p=188}} Cotten noted that [[Toho]] picked up most, if not all the film's production budget.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|1994|p=188}}  

''Latitude Zero'''s screenplay is credited to Ted Sherdeman and is based on his ''Latitude Zero'' stories, which were a popular American radio serial.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|1996|p=261}}{{sfn|Galbraith IV|1994|p=186}} The Japanese version credits [[Shinichi Sekizawa]] as the screenplay adviser, a role described by [[Stuart Galbraith IV]] as writing the Japanese version.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|1996|p=261}}

==Release==
''Latitude Zero'' was released in Japan on July 29, 1969 with a print that was dubbed into Japanese.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|1996|p=261}} It received a release in the United States by [[National General Pictures]].{{sfn|Galbraith IV|1996|p=261}} [[Akira Takarada]] and [[Akihiko Hirata]] speak English in the English-language version and are not dubbed.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|1996|p=261}} The film received a test screening in Dallas in July of 1969 and received a general theatrical release on December 1970.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|1996|p=261}} The film was re-issued theatrically in Japan in 1974 on a double bill with ''[[Mothra (film)|Mothra]]''.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|1994|p=363}} 

==Reception==
In contemporary reviews, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reviewed the film at the [[Venice Film Festival]]'s  buyer's market, referring to it as a "campy fun helped by sober playing and some deft underwater work, gadgets and movement."{{sfn|Willis|1985|p=248–249|ps=: "Review is of 84 minute version viewed in Venice on August 31, 1969"}} The story, however, is the weakest element in "Latitude Zero." [[Roger Greenspun]] (''[[New York Times]]'') found ''Latitude Zero'''s plot to be "the weakest element", while noting that "The real virtue of the film lies in its charming and careful models, its ingenious special effects, its fruity interior décor, its elaborate network of television screens"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E0CEFD61038E336A05756C0A9649D946190D6CF|work=[[New York Times]]|title=Screen::City Under Sea|date=December 5, 1970|first=Roger|last=Greenspun|authorlink=Roger Greenspun|accessdate=September 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Monthly Film Bulletin]]'' stated that "it is a sad fact that the special effects are notably variable, and the model work in particular looks extremely shoddy" and the review concluded that "Toho studios seem to have employed their specialized talents and resources to produce an outlandish and expensive leg-pull."&lt;ref name="mfb"&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Monthly Film Bulletin]]|title=Latitude Zero ("Ido Zero Daisakusen)"|pages=178-179|volume=41|issue=480|year=1974|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|last=McGillivray|first=David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations Optional Protocol on the Rights of the Child requires states to outlaw the "producing, distributing, disseminating, importing, exporting, offering, selling or possessing for the above purposes" of child pornography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undemocracy.com/A-RES-54-263 |title=Article 3, (1)(c) |publisher=Undemocracy.com |date=25 May 2000 |accessdate=16 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120154810/http://www.undemocracy.com/A-RES-54-263 |archivedate=20 November 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council of Europe's Cybercrime Convention, the [[Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse]], and the EU Framework Decision that became active in 2006 require signatory or member states to criminalize all aspects of child pornography.&lt;ref name= Akdeniz11/&gt; Article 34 of the [[United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child]] (UNCRC) stated that all signatories shall take appropriate measures to prevent the exploitative use of children in pornographic performances and materials.

== International treaties ==

International obligations to pass specific laws against child pornography "punishable by appropriate penalties that take into account their grave nature" as well as enable extradition, mutual assistance in investigation, and seizure of property were mandated by the [[Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography]].

Some of the negotiations and reviews of the process took place at the [[World Congress against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children]] held in 1996 and 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csecworldcongress.org/en/index.htm |title=World Congress against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children |publisher=Csecworldcongress.org |date=27 July 2002 |accessdate=16 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316121435/http://www.csecworldcongress.org/en/index.htm |archivedate=16 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, in the case of ''[[R. v. Sharpe]]'', British Columbia's highest court struck down a law against possessing child pornography as unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-23215648.html "Canada Court Quashes Child-Porn Law"], ''AP Online'', 1999-06-30&lt;/ref&gt; That opinion, written by Justice Duncan Shaw, held, "There is no evidence that demonstrates a significant increase in the danger to children caused by pornography", and "A person who is prone to act on his fantasies will likely do so irrespective of the availability of pornography."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efc.ca/pages/media/national-post.16jan99.html Top B.C. court strikes down child-porn law], The National Post, January 16, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The Opposition in the Canadian Parliament considered invoking the [[notwithstanding clause]] to override the court's ruling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/appeal6&amp;div=7&amp;id=&amp;page= "Judicial Activism in R. v. Sharpe: An Administration or Perversion of Justice?"], ''Rev. Current L. &amp; L. Reform'', 2000, pp. 14&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was not necessary because the Canadian Supreme Court overturned the decision with several findings including that viewing such material makes it more likely that the viewer will abuse, that the existence of such materials further hurts the victims as they know of its existence, and that the demand for such images encourages the abuse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/2001/2001scc2/2001scc2.html ''R. v.

Retrieved February 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, some federal judges have argued that the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines' recommended penalties for possessors of child pornography are too harsh.&lt;ref name=denverpost&gt;[http://www.denverpost.com/ci_13887009 "Federal judges argue for reduced sentences for child-porn convicts"], ''The Denver Post'', November 29, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Judge [[Jack B. Weinstein]] of New York criticizes the mandatory sentence for possession of child pornography as often ''higher'' than the penalty for actually committing the act of child abuse it depicts. Furthermore, child pornography prosecutions have led to dozens of suicides, some of them among the innocently accused.&lt;ref name="weinstein"&gt;[http://human-stupidity.com/stupid-dogma/teenage-sexuality/child-porn-laws-kill-destroy-lives-judge-jack-b-weinstein "Cruel child porn laws kill, 'destroying lives unnecessarily' (Judge Jack B. Weinstein)"]&lt;/ref&gt;  The requirement that people convicted of possessing child pornography pay restitution has been criticized by some judges and law professors. This has been particularly controversial in cases involving millions of dollars of restitution, as in those pertaining to the Misty Series.&lt;ref&gt;John Schwartz (February 2, 2010), [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/03/us/03offender.html "Child Pornography, and an Issue of Restitution"], ''New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; But in 2010, the US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that restitution directly to depicted minors was an appropriate penalty for possession of child pornography.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leagle.com/unsecure/page.htm?shortname=infco20100901158 ''U.S. v. Baxter'']&lt;/ref&gt;

During the nomination process at the 2008 Libertarian National Convention, [[anarcho-capitalist]] and U.S. Presidential candidate [[Mary Ruwart]] came under fire for her comment in her 1998 book, ''Short answers to the tough questions'', in which she stated her opposition not only to laws against possession of child pornography but even against its ''production'', based on her belief that such laws actually encourage such behavior by increasing prices.&lt;ref&gt;Nathan Thornburgh (May 21, 2008), [http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1808384,00.html "Can the Libertarians Go Mainstream?"], ''Time''&lt;/ref&gt; Shane Cory, on behalf of the [[minarchism|minarchist]] United States Libertarian Party in his role as executive director, issued a response saying, "We have an obligation to protect children from sexual exploitation and abuse, and we can do this by increasing communication between state and federal agencies to help combat this repulsive industry. While privacy rights should always be respected in the pursuit of child pornographers, more needs to be done to track down and prosecute the twisted individuals who exploit innocent children."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.lp.org/media/article_578.shtml "Libertarians call for increased communication to combat child pornography"]&lt;/ref&gt; Cory resigned after the party refused to vote on a resolution asking states to strongly enforce existing child porn laws.&lt;ref&gt;McCain, Robert Stacy (May 23, 2008), [http://spectator.org/archives/2008/05/23/fear-and-loathing-in-denver 0Fear and Loathing in Denver"], ''The American Spectator''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Belize ===
The law in [[Belize]] does not prohibit the simple possession of child pornography.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; It is unclear if distribution of child pornography is illegal.

=== Brazil ===
Production, distribution and possession of child pornography are clearly illegal and widely prosecuted in [[Brazil]] in accordance with its Code of Minors. Also possibly illegal would be simple visualization and lack of denunciation, though it is not directly mentioned in the Code of Minors. Level of enforcement has historically varied by courts. Brazil also [[Ages of consent in South America#Brazil|criminalizes every kind of prostitution]] of those under 18 years of age more severely.

While the simple visualization of [[Legal status of cartoon pornography depicting minors|cartoons depicting sexual acts involving apparently human minors]] may not be illegal in itself, possession and especially production and/or distribution can be interpreted in courts to be of the same level of actual child pornography, since legislation is vague on the subject (see Articles 241-C and 241-E of the Code of Minors). Such a scenario is very remote though, as Brazilian courts do not often charge people for [[victimless crime]]s, especially those related to sexual misconduct (for example, while the age of consent is 14, the 18-year-old sexual partner of a consenting 13-year-old was once freed after less than two days by a judge&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://estadao.br.msn.com/ultimas-noticias/artigo.aspx?cp-documentid=26333837 Brazilian justice system frees man, 18, arrested for publicly kissing young teenager, 13 — Last News – MSN Estadão].

Although child pornography may also be obscene, a legal term that refers to offensive or violent forms of pornography that have been declared by decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court to be outside the protection of the [[First Amendment of the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] regarding free speech,&lt;ref name=NCJRS&gt;{{cite web|title=Remarks of Arnold I Burns Before the Florida Law Enforcement Committee on Obscenity, Organized Crime and Child Pornography |url=http://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=109133 |publisher=National Institute of Justice |work=NCJ 109133 |date=3 December 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is defined differently from obscenity. [[Federal Sentencing Guidelines]] regarding child pornography differentiate between production, distribution and purchasing/receiving, and also include variations in severity based on the age of the child involved in the materials, with significant increases in penalties when the offense involves a prepubescent child or a child under the age of 12. The punishments are usually very severe normally ranging from 5 years' to 40 years' imprisonment. The U.S. laws against [[child pornography]] are always enforced and among the harshest in the world.&lt;ref name=Sentencing9&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ussc.gov/r_congress/SCAC.HTM |title=Sex Offenses Against Children: Findings and Recommendations Regarding Federal Penalties (as directed in the Sex Crimes Against Children Prevention Act of 1995, Section 6, Public Law 104-71) |publisher=United States Sentencing Commission |page=9 |date=June 1996 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090526083325/http://www.ussc.gov/r_congress/SCAC.HTM |archivedate=26 May 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the very harsh laws, the U.S. is one of the largest producers of child pornography in the world, behind Japan and Russia.{{cn|date=November 2018}} The PROTECT Act of 2003 codifies much of the U.S. child pornography laws, including simulated child pornography, such as cartoons, and has been used to successfully prosecute individuals for possession of cartoon child pornography.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Manga Collection Ruled "Child Pornography" By US Court|url = http://io9.com/5272107/manga-collection-ruled-child-pornography-by-us-court|accessdate = 2015-07-03|first = Annalee|last = Newitz|date=May 28, 2009|newspaper=[[Gizmodo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fictional (simulated) child pornography, however, is legalized if and only if it passes the [[Miller test]].

=== Philippines ===
{{Main article|Child pornography in the Philippines}}

The Philippines passed Republic Act No. 9775 "Anti Child Pornography Act" in November 2009. The Act outlaws the production, creation, distribution and possession of child pornography. It also places obligations on mall operators and owners of commercial property to ensure that violations of child pornography are not being committed on their premises.

Controversially, the Act also creates obligations on internet-related service providers to ensure child pornography is not being stored or transmitted through their services. The Act requires internet service providers and internet hosting services to employ filtering software and to report child pornography violations within 7 days of discovery. How this obligation is to be implemented is yet to be seen. {{as of|February 2010}} the implementing rules and regulations were yet to be released by the National Telecommunications Commission and the Inter-Agency Council Against Child Pornography.

The law also expressly places obligations upon photo developers, information technology professionals, credit card companies, banks and anyone with direct knowledge of child pornography activities to report suspected child pornography materials and transaction within 7 days of discovery.

Prior to the Anti-Child Pornography Act, it was already illegal to use children for pornography and to sell and distribute that material. Under section 9 of Republic Act No. 7610 "Special Protection of Children Against Child Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act", its prohibited to hire, employ, use, persuade, induce or coerce a child into performing for obscene publications or pornographic materials.

In addition, the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act (Republic Act no. 9208) also outlaws the [[trafficking of children]] for the use in pornographic material.

The Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 prohibits the production, distribution, sale, publication and possession of child pornography. Penalties include prison sentences and fines. The most common way individuals in Ireland distribute or acquire child pornography is via the internet. Some ISPs have implemented filters that block sites containing child pornography. In early 2015, UPC set up an internet filtering system with the help of An Garda Síochána (The Irish Police Service) to block child pornography which applies to all of its customers. If an internet user tries to access a blocked site, a message will be displayed stating that the material is illegal and that is why the site has been blocked. However, UPC does not pass on the details of customers who try to access blocked sites to An Garda Síochána. However, not all ISPs have filters in place and filters can easily be bypassed using proxy servers.

=== Italy ===
Production, possession, distribution of child pornography in all its forms is illegal in Italy. Italian law clearly designates child pornography as "portraying or visually depicting any minor engaged or involved in sexually explicit activities, as well as the simple lascivous exhibition or genitals or of the pubic region".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.altalex.com/index.php?idnot=49754|title=Pedopornografia solo in presenza di atteggiamenti esplicitamente sessuali|work=Altalex}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2 March 2006, prohibition also extends to [[simulated child pornography]] in a specific legal designation that defines virtual imagery as "images realized through the modification of real photographs or images of minors, or parts thereof, with graphic elaboration techniques ... whose quality makes non-real situations appear as real". This excludes drawings, cartoons, and other non-realistic simulated child pornography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.altalex.com/index.php?idnot=78|title=Norme contro la pedofilia e la pedopornografia anche a mezzo internet|work=Altalex}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Producers and distributors of child pornography are punished with imprisonment from 6 to 12 years, and with a fine ranging from 25.822 to 258.228 [[Euros]]. Possession of child pornography is punished with imprisonment up to 3 years, and with a minimum fine of €1500 (Codice penale, Article 600 ter, paragraph 5); sentences can be doubled or tripled if the quantity of child pornography found in possession of the culprit is "vast".

Secondary punishment includes a lifetime ban from employment in schools and in public or private services, organizations, structures, institutions or business establishments mainly frequented by minors.

=== Monaco ===
Production and possession of child pornography is illegal in [[Monaco]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Since April 2009, the government of Monaco uses a list established by the [[Internet Watch Foundation]] to block access to websites containing child pornography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presse.gouv.mc/304/wwwnew.nsf/1909$/c10358afabbd2598c12575ae002896cfgb?OpenDocument&amp;2Gb|title=Home &gt; Press releases &gt; Archives Humanitarian and Caritative &gt; Fight against child pornography(Gb)|first=Robert|last=BOUHNIK|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Child pornography laws in Portugal}}

Child pornography is statutorily criminalised in the Portuguese Criminal Code (Código Penal Português). The age of sexual consent in Portugal is, in principle, 14 years of age. The participation of underage persons in pornographic scenes is subject to stricter standards however because they are subject to the general regime of adulthood, which was set by the Civil Code at the age of 18.

=== Romania ===
The display, selling, dissemination, renting, distribution, and production of child pornography, defined as any pornographic material involving minors, is punishable by 1 to 5 years in prison. If these acts are done with the use of information technology, the punishment is 2 to 7 years. Unlawful accessing of child pornography through information technology is punished by 3 months to 3 years in prison or by a criminal fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.just.ro/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=Wpo7d56II/Q= | title=Penal Code of Romania, art. 376 | accessdate=5 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spain ===
The law in Spain prohibits child pornography. The penal code criminalizes both using a minor "to prepare any type of pornographic material" and producing, selling, distributing, displaying, or facilitating the production, sale, dissemination, or exhibition, of "any type" of child pornography by "any means". Knowingly possessing child pornography is also penalized, carrying a potential prison sentence of up to 1 year. The penalty for the production, sale, or distribution of pornography in which a child under 18 years of age has been involved is imprisonment from 1 to 4 years or up to 8 years if the child is under 13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2011/eur/186408.htm|title=Country Reports on Human Rights Practices|publisher=U.S. Department of State}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sweden ===
Child pornography is presumed to have been illegal prior to 1971. It was legal from 1971 to 1980, but now is illegal. The [[National Library of Sweden]] experienced a dispute regarding the alleged collection due to their legal obligation to archive all material printed on Swedish soil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelocal.se/17058/20090121 David Landes of Swedish "The Local": Swedish national library in child porn scandal] 21 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kb.se/aktuellt/nyheter/2010/KBs-innehav-av-barnporr-kartlagt/ KB:s innehav av barnporr kartlagt] (Swedish)&lt;/ref&gt; This became publicized as activist groups Hand in Hand and Anhöriga till sexuellt utnyttjade barn became involved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelocal.se/18704/20090406 Peter Vinthagen Simpson of Swedish "The Local": Swedish national library reported for child porn] 6 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
"The criminalization of possession of the drawings would otherwise exceed what is necessary with regard to the purpose which has led to the restriction on freedom of expression and freedom of information."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thelocal.se/20120615/41460&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===
Production of child pornography is illegal in Switzerland. In July 2014, the legal age for actors participating in pornography in Switzerland was raised from 16 to 18.

===Turkey===
The production, import, duplication, transportation, storage, export, presenting the same to other’s use, or possession of child pornography is illegal in [[Turkey]].

Article 226 of Turkish Penal Code (Law Nr. 5237) states that "Any person who uses children in production of indecent scenes, words or articles shall be punished with imprisonment from 5 to 10 years and a fine up to 5,000 days.{{explain|reason=normally fines are stated in amounts of money.

=== Ukraine ===
The law in [[Ukraine]] does not prohibit simple possession of child pornography,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; but courts have the authority to limit access to websites which distribute child pornography and to impose financial penalties and prison sentences for those running the websites.

[[Nina Karpachova]], the Ukrainian Parliament Commissioner for Human Rights, said in June 2011 that a significant amount of child pornography available on the Internet originates in Ukraine. It is believed the child pornography market in Ukraine is worth about $100 million per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2011/eur/186415.htm|title=Country Reports on Human Rights Practices|work=U.S. Department of State}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
{{Main article|Child pornography laws in the United Kingdom}}

In the United Kingdom, it is illegal to take, make, distribute, show or possess an indecent image of a child under 18. Before 2003 it was illegal to take, make, distribute, show or possess an indecent image of a child under 16.

In December 2008, a Sydney man was convicted with possessing child pornography after sexually explicit pictures of children characters from [[The Simpsons]] were found on his computer. The NSW Supreme Court upheld a Local Court decision that the animated Simpsons characters "depicted", and thus "could be considered", real people.&lt;ref name="TheAge Dec2008"&gt;{{cite news |title=Simpsons cartoon rip-off is child porn: judge |newspaper=The Age |date=8 December 2008 |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/simpsons-cartoon-ripoff-is-child-porn-judge-20081208-6tmk.html| accessdate=18 November 2009 |quote=A NSW Supreme Court judge has ruled an internet cartoon in which lookalike child characters from The Simpsons engage in sexual acts is child pornography.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in March 2011, a Tasmanian man was convicted with possessing child pornography after police investigators discovered an electronic copy of [[The Pearl (magazine)|''The Pearl'']] by Anonymous on his computer. The Pearl is available for purchase within Australia and published by Harper Collins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/child-porn-book-the-pearl-still-being-sold-in-australia-after-tasmanian-man-convicted-for-downloading-it/story-e6frg6ox-1226015197430 "Tasmanian alderman David Traynor gets child porn conviction for book still sold in Australia"].

'''''Lessons of the Masters''''' is a 2004 book by [[George Steiner]]. It is part history, part analysis of the [[mentor]]-[[protégé]] relationship. From [[Socrates]] and [[Jesus]] to [[Husserl]], [[Heidegger]] and [[Arendt]], not leaving out [[Plotinus]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], [[Shakespeare]], [[Dante]], [[Christopher Marlowe|Marlowe]], [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]], [[Wittgenstein]], [[Nadia Boulanger]] and [[Simone Weil]], Steiner shows how much is at stake in the passing on of wisdom and the risks involved.

The book is based on Steiner's [[Charles_Eliot_Norton_Lectures|Norton]] lectures.

]]
{{RomanMilitary}}

A '''manica''' ({{lang-la|manica}}, "sleeve"&lt;ref&gt;Article by [[James Yates (minister)|James Yates]], M.A., F.R.S., on p. 729 of William Smith, D.C.L., LL.D.:A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities, John Murray, London, 1875. [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Manica.html]&lt;/ref&gt;) was a type of iron or bronze arm guard, with curved and overlapping metal segments or plates, fastened to leather straps, worn by [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[gladiator]]s called crupellarii, and later by soldiers.

==Origins and early use==
[[File:AdamclisiMetope37.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Tropeum Traiani Metope XX Legionary with manica laminata and sword, facing a Dacian falxman]]

As early as [[Achaemenid_Empire|Achaemenid]] times, there were references to "cheires" which consisted of hoops of metal that would be worn on the rein arm of a cavalryman. Hooped armour became extremely popular in the Saka, Parthian, and Kushan kingdoms and was used on both arms and legs. They can be seen at Khalchayan and on many pieces of Parthian artwork. In addition, two pieces were excavated at Taxila, dating to the 1st Century.

Roman troops fought crupellarii in the revolt of Florus and Sacrovir of AD 21 .&lt;ref&gt;The Manica. Roman Military Research Society. http://www.romanarmy.net/manica.htm accessed 18 August 2009, quoting Tacitus, Annales, III 43&lt;/ref&gt; From [[Trajan's Dacian Wars]] come the only representational evidence for the use of the manica, and we do not know if its use in that campaign was widespread or rare.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.larp.com/legioxx/manica.html Details of a manica built by a member of the modern Legion XX]&lt;/ref&gt; Manicae (along with metal [[greave]]s) are attested as a supplement to metal body armour on several reliefs depicting that campaign, including the [[Tropaeum Traiani]] at [[Adamclisi]] and [[Trajan's Column]]. 

These extra pieces of armour may have been used as a protection against the Dacian [[falx|falcēs]], which were two-handed weapons which could hit with great force. Trajan's column in Rome seems to suggest that the lorica segmentata and the manica were only issued to [[Roman legion|Roman-born legionaries]] and not to [[auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliaries]]. However, the Tropaeum Traiani, which is considered a better guide to the reality of field equipment, portrays Roman legionaries and heavy infantry auxiliaries equipped in the same fashion—both wearing [[lorica squamata|scale body armour]] with manica arm guards.

==Distribution and later use==
Finds identified as manicae have come from [[Newstead, Aberdeenshire|Newstead]], [[Carnuntum]], [[Richborough]], [[Corbridge]], Eining (Abusina) on the [[Limes Germanicus|Danube frontier]], [[León, Spain|Leon]], [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], and [[Ulpia Traiana Sarmizegeusa]].&lt;ref name="romanarmy.net"&gt;The Manica. Roman Military Research Society. http://www.romanarmy.net/manica.htm accessed 18 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legionxxiv.org/newsteadenlrg/ Legion XXIV's study of the hoard]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nms.scran.ac.uk/000-100-036-811-C National Museums Scotland catalogue entry]&lt;/ref&gt; A very well preserved manica was found in 2010/2011 in a soldiers barrack at the Roman castle of Steincheshof on the Rhine frontier. This manica dated from the last third of the first century to the first third of the second century.&lt;ref&gt;Marion Brüggler und Michael Drechsler: ''Das neue Auxiliarlager Till-Steincheshof, Bedburg-Hau, Kreis Kleve''. In: [[Peter Henrich]] (Hrsg.): ''Der Limes vom Niederrhein bis an die Donau. 6.&amp;nbsp;Kolloquium der Deutschen Limeskommission''. Theiss, Stuttgart 2012, {{ISBN|978-3-8062-2466-5}}, S.&amp;nbsp;28–37; hier: S.&amp;nbsp;35.&lt;/ref&gt; These suggest that the manica was in use by the Roman military during the 1st century AD, independent from the [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|Dacian wars]]. The sculpture at Alba Julia provides evidence of the manica in use in the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD by the military.&lt;ref name="romanarmy.net"/&gt; [[Ammianus]] describes Roman cavalry (probably [[cataphract]]s) on parade in AD 350  as "''Laminarum circuli tenues apti corporis flexibus ambiebant per omnia membra diducti.''" (Thin circles of iron plates, fitted to the curves of their bodies, completely covered their limbs).&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus. Res Gestae. XVI:VIII. Constantius et Julianus. http://www.loebclassics.com/view/amminanus_marcellinus-history/1939/pb_LCL300.247.xml accessed 30 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 400 AD, manicae are represented on the [[Column of Arcadius]] and in the [[Notitia Dignitatum]].&lt;ref name="romanarmy.net"/&gt;

==Construction and use==

M.C. Bishop lists likely components as one shoulder plate, about 35 metal (ferrous or copper alloy) strips, 90-120 leathering rivets, 3 or 4 internal leathers, and one padded lining. The lining may have been a separate component, in order to avoid it being torn by the articulated metal plates. The metal strips were about 25 to 30&amp;nbsp;mm wide and 0.35 to 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm in thickness; they were longer at the top of the arm. Each strip had holes at its lower edge, through which flat-headed copper alloy rivets passed from the inside to hold the leather straps in place. It also had a hole punched at each end, which did not have a rivet and presumably served as an attachment point for an organic fastening. The lower few plates were in some cases riveted together, rather than articulated on leather. One depiction appears to show a manica terminating in a hand shape.&lt;ref name="scribd.com"&gt;Lorica Segmentata - (Vol. I.) - A Handbook of Articulated Roman Plate Armour. Journal of Roman Military Equipment Studies, Monograph 1, 2002. {{ISBN|0-9539848-4-2}}, ISSN 1477-8645. M. C. Bishop. Chapter 8. Other segmental armour. pages 68–72. https://www.scribd.com/doc/17405191/Lorica-Segmentata-Vol-I-Handbook-of-Articulated-Roman-Plate-Armour&lt;/ref&gt; 

The usual arm position depicted for Roman swordsmen is with the upper arm vertical and close to the torso, the forearm extended horizontally with the thumb uppermost. The plates were probably not long enough to cover the whole circumference of the arm, but would have extended from the upper arm down to the thumb, leaving an unprotected area at the back. The plates overlapped upwards, directing any blow to the inside of the elbow which had a particularly dense coverage of multiple plates.&lt;ref name="scribd.com"/&gt;

'''''Munchkin''''' is a [[dedicated deck card game]] by [[Steve Jackson Games]], written by [[Steve Jackson (US game designer)|Steve Jackson]] and illustrated by [[John Kovalic]]. It is a humorous take on [[role-playing games]], based on the concept of [[munchkin (role-playing games)|munchkin]]s (immature role-players, playing only to "win" by having the most powerful character possible).

''Munchkin'' won the 2001 [[Origins Award]] for ''Best Traditional Card Game'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/2001/list-of-winners|title=Origins Award Winners (2001)| publisher=Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts &amp; Design| accessdate=2007-10-15 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080202042430/http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/2001/list-of-winners &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is itself a spin-off of ''The Munchkin's Guide to Powergaming'', a gaming humor book which also won an Origins Award in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/2000/list-of-winners|title=Origins Award Winners (2000)| publisher=Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts &amp; Design| accessdate=2007-10-15 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080415213159/http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/2000/list-of-winners &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the success of the original ''Munchkin'' game several expansion packs and sequels were published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.worldofmunchkin.com/|title=Munchkin home page| publisher=Steve Jackson Games| accessdate=2007-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now available in 15 different languages, ''Munchkin'' accounted for more than 70% of the 2007 sales for Steve Jackson Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sjgames.com/general/stakeholders/report08.html|title=2008 Report to the Stakeholders|publisher=Steve Jackson Games|accessdate=2008-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==
In ''Munchkin'', all players start at level 1, with the goal of reaching level 10 (or level 20 in Epic Level games). Players primarily progress by killing monsters, and level up every time they kill a monster. However, players can freely use cards against monsters and other players during play, allowing them to either assist or to sabotage others during their turn. Each person's turn begins when they "kick down the door" by drawing a Door Card face-up. A Door Card can be one of the following types: a Monster Card, which the player must engage by fighting or fleeing; a Curse Card, which applies an effect; or an Item Card, Race Card, or Class Card, which the player adds to their hand. If the card drawn is not a Monster Card, the player can either "loot the room" by drawing a face-down door card and adding it to their hand, or "look for trouble" by playing a Monster Card from their hand to fight it.

When fighting a monster, the total level of the player (and any supporting players) is weighed against the total level of the monster(s) to determine the victor. A successful player draws the listed amount of treasure cards and levels up either 1 or 2 levels, but an unsuccessful character must roll the dice to try and flee; players who fail to roll a five or six suffer the monster's negative effects ("Bad Stuff") or die. Should a player die, their turn immediately ends and they discard their hand, retaining their player level but drawing a new hand for equipment.

Due to the highly competitive nature of the game and the presence of rule-breaking cards, players are encouraged to use unfair tactics against others, to act [[mercenary]] to further themselves at the expense of others, or to use cheat cards to affect outcomes (such as fixing the roll of the die). Throughout a player's turn, others are free to intervene: they can passively [[status effect|buff or debuff]] the player or monsters to alter the outcome; play monster cards of matching types to make the battle more difficult; or offer to assist the player, typically in exchange for treasure cards.

[[File:Munchkin card game being played , March 2014.jpeg|thumb|A game of Munchkin being played, with coins being used to denote levels.]]

Other cards that can enter play include Items, which can be used in combat, Treasure Cards, which act as sellable loot and equipment, and Curse Cards, which apply effects. Additionally, players can equip certain cards (such as armor and weapons) to raise their total level and kill stronger monsters, and can use Class Cards and Race Cards to grant extra abilities or advantages at the cost of a balanced weakness; for example, the elf race can level when helping others kill monsters, but will take additional damage from disgusting enemies.

Standard games typically last around an hour, with the game ending once a player reaches the target level and wins the match. Aside from defeating monsters, players can progress though indirect means such as selling cards (with every 1000 Gold on the sum total granting a level) or by playing special leveling cards. Most games disallow victory through indirect methods, meaning only fighting a monster can win the game. There are a few exceptions, however, such as when a player uses cards which specifically state they override rules.

==Variants, Expansions &amp; Accessories==
===Variants===
These are themed "box set" editions of MUNCHKIN that have been released. (The overall theme parodied by each set is after the title.) Each is a stand-alone version that can be played separately or combined with any other version for a more expansive game. Some of these have been released in Deluxe versions (which include a gameboard and movers to keep track of levels) and/or Guest Artist Editions (drawn with new art by artists other than those who originally drew them). Certain versions have been co-produced with USAopoly and feature "character cards" that grant starting powers and keep track of levels. These games are denoted by a "'''(U)'''" after the description.

== Reception ==
An early review on RPGnet regards ''Munchkin'' as not a very serious game;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rpg.net/news+reviews/reviews/rev_5700.html| title=Munchkin (Capsule Review)| publisher=[[RPGnet]]| last=Appelcline| first=Shannon|date=January 2002| accessdate=2007-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; the rules make this clear with phrases like "Decide who goes first by rolling the dice and arguing about the results and the meaning of this sentence and whether the fact that a word seems to be missing any effect," and "Any disputes in the rules should be settled by loud arguments with the owner of the game having the last word." There are many cards which interact with or are affected by a single other card, despite the rarity of the two cards entering play together (such as the interaction between ''Fowl Fiend'' and ''Chicken on Your Head'' or ''Sword of Slaying Everything Except Squid'' and ''Squidzilla'').

On ''[[BoardGameGeek]]'' the average user rating is 6/10.&lt;ref name="bgg"&gt;{{cite web |title=Munchkin |url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1927/munchkin/ratings?rated=1&amp;comment=1 |website=BoardGameGeek |accessdate=27 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Tom Vasel of [[The Dice Tower]] was critical of the game Munchkin feeling it was overpriced, had limited re-playability, and a poor and occasionally tedious gaming experience.{{Citation needed|reason=Do you have a record of the review?|date=July 2018}}

'''North by Northeast''' (or NXNE) is an annual music and arts festival held each June in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]. The festival's main is live music, but it also includes a film festival, a comedy festival, art components, video game activities, and a digital interactive media conference.  The festival events happen in a variety venues. NXNE is largely a [[Volunteering|volunteer]]-staffed music festival, with about 1,000 volunteers in festival operations. The alternative weekly newspaper ''[[Now (newspaper)|Now]]'' is a major sponsor, and its owners hold an ownership interest in the festival.

Beginning in 2016, a large venue in Toronto's Port Lands area for major events was added for two days of the festival.&lt;ref name=rayner&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/music/2016/03/19/youve-got-to-embrace-the-change-says-nxne-founder-michael-hollett.html "‘You’ve got to embrace the change,’ says NXNE founder Michael Hollett"]. ''Toronto Star'', Ben Rayner, March 19, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

NXNE began in 1995, patterned on the [[South by Southwest]] festival in [[Austin, Texas]].   It was co-founded by Michael Hollett.&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.financialpost.com/news/union-says-now-magazine-in-position-for-work-stoppage-management-threatened-to-close-publication "Union says Now Magazine in position for work stoppage, management threatened to close publication"].

''The Huffington Post Canada''  |  By Aaron Brophy  06/18/2014&lt;/ref&gt; The SXSW organization is a minority ownership partner in NXNE.&lt;ref&gt;Lackner, Chris (June 10, 2004). "Toronto's North by Northeast festival in its 10th year of keeping dreams alive", [[Canadian Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; At that time it was a three-day festival with about 300 bands,&lt;ref&gt;[http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/doc/437266889.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jun+8%2C+1995&amp;author=&amp;pub=Toronto+Star&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=G.1&amp;desc=NXNE+With+300+bands+on+the+playbill%2C+will+North+By+Northeast+he+the+festival+that+finally+puts+Canadian+music+on+the+map%3FNXNE With 300 bands on the playbill, will North By Northeast he the festival that finally puts Canadian music on the map?"]. ''Toronto Star ''- Toronto, Ont. Jun 8, 1995 G.1&lt;/ref&gt; mainly local, unsigned, independent artists.  Over the years the festival expanded its attendance and began to feature well-known performers.  The festival events took place in a number of venues, and participants purchased wristbands for entry into the events.

A [[film]] [[festival]] was added in 2001, screening primarily music-related features, documentaries and shorts. NXNE Film has screened films by directors such as [[Stewart Copeland]] (of rock band [[The Police]]), [[Don Letts]], [[Guy Maddin]], and [[Rob Heydon]], and has hosted many world premieres, including [[Bruce McDonald (director)|Bruce McDonald]]'s [[Broken Social Scene]] concert film, [[This Movie Is Broken]], in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://torontoist.com/2010/06/this_interview_about_this_movie_is_broken_is_also_broken.php "This Interview About ''This Movie Is Broken'' Is Also Broken"]. Torontoist, June 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Tanner was the director of the festival. from 2007 to 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/music/2016/03/14/top-tracks-from-torontos-bright-young-music-makers.html "Top tracks from Toronto's bright young music makers"]. ''Toronto Star'', Ian Gormely, March 14, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, NXNE added [[comedy]] as a fourth stream, formally recognizing the growing number of standup, sketch, and improvisatory comics taking part in the festival since 2010. NXNE also added [[art]] as its fifth stream that year. including exhibits, projections, installations, performances and an art fair.

In 2014, NXNE marked its 20th consecutive year with over 1,000 music performers and an overall attendance of 350,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fyimusicnews.ca/articles/2016/06/21/report-2016s-new-style-nxne "A Report On 2016's New Style NXNE"]. ''FYI Music News'',  Kerry Doole Tue, 06/21/2016&lt;/ref&gt; The 2015 edition of NXNE ran for five days, June 17–21.

In 2016, under the direction of Michael Hollett, the festival organizers changed the format, concentrating more highly attended performances in a large venue in the Port Lands area, at 51 Commissioners St.&lt;ref name=rayner /&gt; The festival also added a video gaming component, and gaming was among the topics discussed at the one day Interactive conference at Ryerson University. As well as live music. Yonge Dundas Square provided festival-goers the chance to play on a giant screen and to  compete against each other with live play-by-play commentary.

== Music ==
[[File:Purity Ring - NXNE 2012.jpg|thumb|Purity Ring performs during NXNE 2012.|alt=]]
Each year, NXNE Music presents hundreds of bands from Canada, the [[United States]] and around the world at about 50 Toronto music venues. Most venues host six bands each night (from 9 p.m. onward). The festival has many venues in Toronto's downtown core, along [[Queen Street West]], [[College Street (Toronto)|College Street]], and the Bloor Street [[The Annex|Annex]]. NXNE Music provides a platform for emerging artists, and allows fans to see "buzz bands" at small club venues. There are free outdoor concerts at [[Yonge-Dundas Square]] in downtown Toronto, and in recent years there are also international headline acts, including [[The Flaming Lips]], [[Ludacris]], [[Devo]], [[Iggy and the Stooges]], [[Billy Talent]], [[Social Distortion]], [[Raekwon]] &amp; [[Ghostface Killah]], [[De La Soul]], [[Bad Religion]], [[Stars]], [[The Pharcyde]], [[The Raveonettes]], [[GZA]], [[Descendents]], [[Digable Planets]], and [[K-os]].&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.ca"/&gt;

== Interactive conference ==

The NXNE Interactive [[Meeting|Conference]] (also known as NXNEi) takes place at the Hyatt Regency Hotel, which also serves as NXNE headquarters during the festival. Originally a music-industry event (past guests include [[Stewart Copeland]], [[The Sex Pistols]]' [[Johnny Rotten]], [[Steve Earle]], [[Bruce Cockburn]], [[Peaches (musician)|Peaches]], [[Patti Smith]], [[Thomas Dolby]], [[The Rolling Stones]]' [[Andrew Loog Oldham]], and [[Bullmoose]]), the conference in recent years has become Interactive (NXNEi), and its presentations and panels have focused on the integration of technology with creativity in music, film, and other art forms. It is also a place where musicians, filmmakers, and industry reps can connect with digital innovators and tech leaders. In 2016 the conference was a one-day event at Ryerson University's Ted Rogers School of Business. Atari founder Nolan Bushnell, was the conference's keynote speaker.

The '''Pama–Nyungan languages''' are the most widespread [[language family|family]] of [[indigenous Australian languages]],&lt;ref&gt;International Encyclopedia of Linguistics, William J. Frawley, p 232,&lt;/ref&gt; containing perhaps 300 languages.  The name "Pama–Nyungan" is derived from the names of the two most widely separated groups, the [[Pama languages]] of the northeast and the [[Nyungan languages]] of the southwest.  The words ''pama'' and ''nyunga'' mean "man" in their respective languages.

The other language families indigenous to the continent of Australia are occasionally referred to, by exclusion, as non-Pama–Nyungan languages, though this is not a taxonomic term. The Pama–Nyungan family accounts for most of the geographic spread, most of the Aboriginal population, and the greatest number of languages. Most of the Pama–Nyungan languages are spoken by small ethnic groups of hundreds of speakers or fewer. The vast majority of languages, either due to disease or elimination of their speakers, have become extinct, and almost all remaining ones are endangered in some way. Only in the central inland portions of the continent do Pama-Nyungan languages remain spoken vigorously by the entire community.

The Pama–Nyungan family was identified and named by [[Kenneth L. Hale]], in his work on the classification of Native Australian languages.  Hale's research led him to the conclusion that of the Aboriginal Australian languages, one relatively closely interrelated family had spread and proliferated over most of the continent, while approximately a dozen other families were concentrated along the North coast.

==Typology==
Evans and McConvell describe typical Pama–Nyungan languages such as Warlpiri as [[Dependent-marking language|dependent-marking]] and exclusively suffixing languages which lack gender, while noting that some non-Pama–Nyungan languages such as [[Tangkic languages|Tangkic]] share this typology and some Pama–Nyungan languages like [[Yanyuwa language|Yanyuwa]], a head-marking and prefixing language with a complicated gender system, diverge from it.&lt;ref name="enigma"&gt;Nick Evans and Patrick McConvell, "The Enigma of Pama–Nyungan Expansion in Australia" ''Archaeology and language'', Volume 29, Roger Blench, Matthew Spriggs, eds., Routledge, 1999, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DWMHhfXxLaIC&amp;pg=PA176&amp;dq=O'Grady+Tryon+propose&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=C5BKTNzQJYH48AbXmK00&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDMQ6wEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=O'Grady%20Tryon%20propose&amp;f=false p176]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reconstruction==
Proto-Pama–Nyungan may have been spoken as recently as about 5,000 years ago, much more recently than the 40,000 to 60,000 years [[indigenous Australians]] are believed to have been inhabiting [[Australia]]. How the Pama–Nyungan languages spread over most of the continent and displaced any pre-Pama–Nyungan languages is uncertain; one possibility is that language could have been transferred from one group to another alongside [[culture]] and [[ritual]].&lt;ref&gt;Hale &amp; O'Grady, pp. 91–92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evans &amp; Rhys&lt;/ref&gt; Given the relationship of cognates between groups, it seems that Pama-Nyungan has many of the characteristics of a [[sprachbund]], indicating the antiquity of multiple waves of culture contact between groups.&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, Johanna (1997), "Modeling Ancient Population Structures and Movement in Linguistics" (Annual Review of Anthropology, Vol. 26, (1997)), pp. 359-384.&lt;/ref&gt; Dixon in particular has argued that the genealogical trees found with many language families do not fit in the Pama-Nyungan family.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon, R. M. W. 1997. "The rise and fall of languages". (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

Using [[computational phylogenetics]], Bouckaert, et al. (2018)&lt;ref&gt;Bouckaert, Remco R., Claire Bowern &amp; Quentin D. Atkinson (2018). [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-018-0489-3 The origin and expansion of Pama–Nyungan languages across Australia]. ''Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution'' volume 2, pages 741–749 (2018).&lt;/ref&gt; posit a mid-[[Holocene]] expansion of Pama-Nyungan from the [[Gulf Plains]] of northeastern Australia.

===Vocabulary===
In addition to Hale's 1982 list of words unique to Pama–Nyungan, and in addition to pronouns and case endings they reconstruct for the proto-language, Evans and McConvell report that while some of their roots are implausible, O'Grady and Tryon, nevertheless provide "hundreds of clear cognate sets with attestations throughout the Pama–Nyungan area and absent outside."&lt;ref name="enigma"/&gt;

===Phonology===
Proto-Pama–Nyungan's [[phonology|phonological]] inventory, as reconstructed by [[Barry Alpher]] (2004), is quite similar to those of most present-day Australian languages.

Proto-Pama–Nyungan seems to have had only one set of [[laminal consonant]]s; the two contrasting sets (lamino-[[dental consonant|dental]] and lamino-[[alveopalatal consonant|alveopalatal]] or "[[palatal consonant|palatal]]") found in some present-day languages can largely be explained as innovations resulting from conditioned [[sound change]]s.

Nevertheless, there are a small number of words where an alveopalatal [[stop consonant|stop]] is found where a dental would be expected, and these are written *cʲ. There is no convincing evidence, however, of an equivalent [[nasal stop|nasal]] *ɲʲ or [[lateral consonant|lateral]] *λʲ

==Phonotactics==
Pama–Nyungan languages generally share several broad phonotactic constraints: Single-consonant onsets, a lack of fricatives, and a prohibition against [[liquid consonant|liquids]] (laterals and rhotics) beginning words. Voiced fricatives have developed in several scattered languages, such as [[Anguthimri language|Anguthimri]], though often the sole alleged fricative is {{IPA|/ɣ/}} and is analyzed as an approximant {{IPA|/ɰ/}} by other linguists. The prime example is [[Kala Lagaw Ya]], which acquired both fricatives and a voicing contrast in them and in its plosives from contact with [[Papuan languages]]. Several of the languages of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] allowed initial {{IPA|/l/}}, and one—[[Gunai language|Gunai]]—also allowed initial {{IPA|/r/}} and consonant clusters {{IPA|/kr/}} and {{IPA|/pr/}}, a trait shared with the [[Tasmanian languages]] across the Bass Strait.

== Classification{{anchor|branches}} ==
At the time of the European arrival in Australia, there were some 300 Pama–Nyungan languages divided across three dozen branches. What follows are the languages listed in Bowern (2011); numbers in parentheses are the numbers of languages in each branch. These vary from languages so distinct they are difficult to demonstrate as being in the same branch, to near dialects on par with the differences between the [[Scandinavian languages]].&lt;ref&gt;Bowern, Claire. 2011. "[http://anggarrgoon.wordpress.com/2011/12/23/how-many-languages-were-spoken-in-australia/ How Many Languages Were Spoken in Australia?]", ''Anggarrgoon: Australian languages on the web'', December 23, 2011 ([http://pamanyungan.sites.yale.edu/master-list-australian-languages-v12 corrected] February 6, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traditional conservative classification===
Down the east coast, from [[Cape York Peninsula|Cape York]] to the [[Bass Strait]], there are:
*''[[Kala Lagaw Ya language|Kala Lagaw Ya]]'' (1)
*[[Paman languages|Paman]] (41)
*''[[Yidiny language|Yidiny]]'' (1)
*[[Dyirbalic languages|Dyirbalic]] (5)
*[[Maric languages|Maric]] (26)
*[[Waka–Kabic languages|Waka–Kabic]] (5)
*[[Durubulic languages|Durubulic]] (5)
*[[Bandjalangic languages|Bandjalangic]] (4)
*[[Gumbaynggiric languages|Gumbaynggiric]] (2)
*''[[Anewan language|Anewan]]'' (Nganyaywana) (1)
*[[Wiradhuric languages|Wiradhuric]] (Central NSW; inland of Yuin–Kuric) (5)
*[[Yuin–Kuric languages|Yuin–Kuric]] (14)
*[[Gippsland languages|Gippsland]] (5)

Continuing along the south coast, from Melbourne to Perth:
*[[Yotayotic languages|Yotayotic]] (somewhat inland) (2)
*[[Kulinic languages|Kulinic]] (13)
*[[Lower Murray languages|Lower Murray]] (9)
*[[Thura-Yura languages|Thura-Yura]] (8)
*[[Mirniny languages|Mirniny]] (2)
*[[Nyungic languages|Nyungic]] (SW) (11)

Up the west coast:
*[[Kartu languages|Kartu]] (5)
*[[Kanyara–Mantharta languages|Kanyara–Mantharta]] (8)
*[[Ngayarta languages|Ngayarta]] (12)
*[[Marrngu languages|Marrngu]] (3)

Cutting inland back to Paman, south of the northern non-Pama–Nyungan languages, are
*[[Ngumpin–Yapa languages|Ngumpin–Yapa]] (10)
*''[[Warumungu language|Warumungu]]'' (1)
*[[Warluwaric languages|Warluwaric]] (5)
*[[Kalkatungic languages|Kalkatungic]] (2)
*[[Mayi languages|Mayi]] (Mayabic) (7)

Encircled by these branches are:
*[[Wati languages|Wati]] (15), the large inland expanse in the west
*[[Arandic languages|Arandic]] (9), in the north centre
*[[Karnic languages|Karnic]] (18), in the west
*[[Yardli languages|Yardli]] (Yarli) (3), in the west
*''[[Muruwari language|Muruwari]]'' (1)
*''[[Baagandji language|Baagandji]]'' (Darling; inland of Lower Murray) (2)

Separated to the north of the rest of Pama–Nyungan is
*[[Yolŋu languages|Yolŋu]] (10)

Some of inclusions in each branch are only provisional, as many languages became extinct before they could be adequately documented. Not included are dozens of poorly attested and extinct languages such as ''[[Barranbinja language|Barranbinja]]'' and the ''[[Lower Burdekin languages]]''.

A few more inclusive groups that have been proposed, such as ''[[Northeast Pama–Nyungan languages|Northeast Pama–Nyungan]]'' (Pama–Maric), ''[[Central New South Wales languages|Central New South Wales]]'', and ''[[Southwest Pama–Nyungan languages|Southwest Pama–Nyungan]]'', appear to be geographical rather than genealogical groups.

===Bowern &amp; Atkinson===
Bowern &amp; Atkinson (2012) use [[computational phylogenetics]] to calculate the following classification:&lt;ref&gt;Claire Bowern and Quentin Atkinson (2012) "[http://elischolar.library.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=ling_faculty Computational phylogenetics and the internal structure of Pama-Nyungan]", ''Language'' 88: 817–845.&lt;/ref&gt;

===External relations===
According to [[Nicholas Evans (linguist)|Nicholas Evans]], the closest relative of Pama–Nyungan are the [[Garawan languages]], followed by the small [[Tangkic languages|Tangkic]] family. He then proposes a more distant relationship with the [[Gunwinyguan languages]] in a macro-family he calls [[Macro-Pama–Nyungan languages|Macro-Pama–Nyungan]].&lt;ref&gt;McConvell, Patrick and Nicholas Evans. (eds.) 1997. ''Archaeology and Linguistics: Global Perspectives on Ancient Australia.'' Melbourne: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; However, this has yet to be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the linguistic community.

==Validity==

===Dixon's skepticism===
In his 1980 attempt to reconstruct Proto-Australian, [[R. M. W. Dixon]] reported that he was unable to find anything that reliably set Pama–Nyungan apart as a valid genetic group. Fifteen years later, he had abandoned the idea that Australian or Pama–Nyungan were families. He now sees Australian as a [[Sprachbund]] (Dixon 2002). Some of the small traditionally Pama–Nyungan families which have been demonstrated through the [[comparative method]], or which in Dixon's opinion are likely to be demonstrable, include the following:

*North Cape York (Northern Paman, Umpila, Wik/Middle Paman: part of [[Paman languages|Paman]])
*[[Yidinic languages|Yidinic]] (Dyaabugai and Yidiny: rejected by Bowern)
*[[Maric languages|Maric]] (extinct languages uncertain)
*[[Wiradhuric languages|Wiradhuric]]
*[[Yolŋu Matha languages|Yolngu]]
*[[Ngarna languages|Ngarna]], a clear connection between [[Yanyuwa language|Yanyuwa]] and [[Warluwara language|Warluwara]], [[Wagaya language|Wagaya]], [[Yindjilandji language|Yindjilandji]], [[Bularnu language|Bularnu]].
*Part of [[Yura languages|Yura]]

He believes that Lower Murray (5 families and isolates), Arandic (2 families, Kaytetye and Arrernte), and Kalkatungic (2 isolates) are small ''[[Sprachbund]]''s.

===Mainstream rejoinders===
However, the papers in Bowern &amp; Koch (2004) demonstrate about ten traditional groups, including Pama–Nyungan, and its sub-branches such as Arandic, using the [[comparative method]].

In his last published paper from the same collection, [[Kenneth L. Hale|Ken Hale]] describes Dixon's skepticism as an erroneous phylogenetic assessment which is "so bizarrely faulted, and such an insult to the eminently successful practitioners of Comparative Method Linguistics in Australia, that it positively demands a decisive riposte."&lt;ref&gt;"the Coherence and Distinctiveness of the Pama–Nyungan Language Family within the Australian Linguistic Phylum" Geoff O'Grady and Ken Hale, p 69, ''Australian Languages: Classification and the Comparative Method'',  Claire Bowern and Harold Koch, eds., John Benjamins Pub. Co., Amsterdam and Philadelphia,  2004&lt;/ref&gt;  In the same work Hale provides unique pronominal and grammatical evidence (with suppletion) as well as more than fifty basic-vocabulary cognates (showing regular sound correspondences)  between the proto-Northern-and-Middle Pamic (pNMP) family of the [[Cape York Peninsula]] on the Australian northeast coast and proto-Ngayarta of the Australian west coast, some 3,000&amp;nbsp;km apart, (as well as from many other languages) to support the Pama–Nyungan grouping, whose age he compares to that of [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1612">In [[analytic philosophy]], the '''paradigm case argument''' is an argument which is applied as a rebuttal to the claim that certain concepts, such as [[free will]] or [[knowledge]], are meaningless. The paradigm case argument is that if a term, such as "knowledge", is regularly applied to some cases and not to others, then that term (and the concept it refers to) cannot truly be undefined, as it clearly has some kind of definition in practice.&lt;ref name=oxford&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Lacey |first=Alan |editor-first=Ted |editor-last=Honderich |encyclopedia=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |title=paradigm case argument |year=1995 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780198661320 |pages=642}}&lt;/ref&gt; The argument is so named because it often takes the form of pointing out a ''paradigm case''—a case which unambiguously falls under the common definition of the term, and so can be taken as a definite instance of the supposedly non-existent concept.&lt;ref name=Borchert&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Donnellan |first=Keith |editor-first=Donald |editor-last=Borchert |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Philosophy |title=Paradigm-Case Argument |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3446801492.html |accessdate=10 November 2014 |year=2006 |publisher=Thomson Gale |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This argument was commonly applied during the flourishing of [[linguistic philosophy]].&lt;ref name=oxford /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4856">'''Redi Award''' is an international science award given to scientists who have made significant contributions in [[toxinology]], the scientific study of [[venoms]], [[poisons]] and [[toxins]]. The award is sponsored by the [[International Society on Toxinology]] (ISI).&lt;ref name=meb&gt;{{cite journal |author= Mebs D|title= History of the International Society on Toxinology - A personal view| journal= Toxicon|year=2012| volume=69|issue= |pages= 21–8|pmid= 23237723|doi=10.1016/j.toxicon.2012.11.021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==

''Osservazioni intorno alle vipere'' (''Observations about the Viper'') written by an Italian polymath [[Francesco Redi]] in 1664 is regarded as the milestone in the beginning of toxinology research. Redi was the first scientist to elucidate the scientific basis of [[snakebite]] and venom of the [[viper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Francesco Redi |editor=Knoefel PK  |title= Francesco Redi on Vipers |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5w8VAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg|accessdate= 2013-04-18 |origyear=   |year= 1988  |publisher=E.J. Brill |location= Leiden, the Netherlands  |pages=11–17 |isbn= 9004089489}}&lt;/ref&gt; He showed for the first time that the viper venom comes from the [[fang]], not the [[gallbladder]] as it was believed; that it is not poisonous when swallowed, and effective only when it enters the  [[blood circulation|bloodstream]].&lt;ref name=hab&gt;{{cite journal |author= Habermehl GG|title= Francesco Redi—life and work|url= |year= 1994 |volume=32  |issue=4  |pages=411–417|pmid=8052995 |doi=10.1016/0041-0101(94)90292-5 |journal=Toxicon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He even demonstrated the possibility of slowing down the venom action in the blood by tight [[ligature (medicine)|ligature]] before the wound. This work is heralded as the foundation of [[toxinology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hayes AN, Gilbert SG |title= Historical milestones and discoveries that shaped the toxicology sciences| journal= EXS|year=2009| volume=99 |issue=1 |pages= 1–35|pmid= 19157056 |doi=10.1007/978-3-7643-8336-7_1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In honour of the pioneer, the International Society on Toxinology (ISI) instituted the ''Redi Award'' in 1967 in recognition of scientists for their significant contributions in toxinology research.&lt;ref name=meb/&gt;

==Nature of the award==

The IST awards scientists or clinicians who have made outstanding contributions to the field of toxinology. The award is given at each World Congress of the Society, which is generally held every three years. It is the highest award bestowed by the society and the most prestigious in the world for toxinologists. Selection for the award is made by the Redi Award Committee chaired by the editor of ''[[Toxicon]]'' (the official journal of IST) and accompanied by past and present Executive Officers of the society and former Redi awardees. The result is only announced at the World Congress. The recipient is then invited to present a lecture of his/her own choosing, officially called the Redi Lecture, to the congress.&lt;ref name=hab /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= International Society on Toxinology |title=IST Redi Awards |url= http://www.toxinology.org/IST_RediAward.htm |date=  | accessdate=2013-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Award consists of a framed citation describing the merits of the awardee and a financial assistance to help cover expenses associated with attendance at the meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= International Society on Toxinology |title= International Society on Toxinology By-Laws Article X|url= http://www.toxinology.org/resources/IST%20Constitution-Revised120713.pdf |date=  | accessdate=2013-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Saramaccan''' ([[endonym|autonym]]: ''Saamáka'') is a [[creole language]] spoken by about 58,000 ethnic African people near the [[Saramacca River|Saramacca]] and upper [[Suriname River]], as well as in the capital [[Paramaribo]], in [[Suriname]] (formerly also known as [[Surinam (Dutch colony)|Dutch Guiana]]), 25,000 in [[French Guiana]], and 8,000 in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name=Price2013&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Price|first=Richard|date=2013|title=The Maroon Population Explosion: Suriname and Guyane|url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/22134360|journal=New West Indian Guide|volume=87|issue=3/4|doi=|pmid=|access-date=4 September 2016|via=open source}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has three main dialects. The speakers are mostly descendants of fugitive [[Atlantic slave trade|slaves]] who were native to [[West Africa|West]] and [[Central Africa]]; they form a group called Saamacca, also spelled [[Saramaka]].

Linguists consider Saramaccan notable because its vocabulary is based on two European source languages, [[English language|English]] (30%) and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (20%), and various West and Central African languages (50%), but it diverges considerably from all of them. The African component accounts for about 50% once ritual use is taken into account, the highest percentage in the Americas, and is derived from [[Niger–Congo languages]] of West Africa, especially [[Fon language|Fon]] and other [[Gbe languages]], [[Akan language|Akan]] and Central African languages such as [[Kikongo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Travels with Tooy: History, Memory, and the African American Imagination|last=Price|first=Richard|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0226680590|location=Chicago|pages=309-389|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The Saramaccan lexicon is largely drawn from English, Portuguese, and, to a lesser extent, [[Dutch language|Dutch]], among European languages, and [[Niger-Congo languages]] of West Africa, especially [[Fon language|Fon]] and other [[Gbe languages]], [[Akan language|Akan]], and Central African languages, such as [[KiKongo]]. The African component accounts for about 50% of the total.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Travels with Tooy: History, Memory, and the African American Imagination|last=Price|first=Richard|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2007|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=309-389|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saramaccan [[phonology]] has traits similar to languages of West Africa. It has developed the use of [[tone (linguistics)|tones]], which are common in Africa, rather than [[stress (linguistics)|stress]], which is typical of European languages.

Over a fourth of words are from English. It is generally agreed that the Portuguese influence originated from enslaved peoples who lived on plantations with Portuguese masters and possibly with other slaves who spoke a Portuguese creole. The masters might have brought the latter in migrating to Suriname from [[Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Surviving the Middle Passage: The West Africa-Surinam Sprachbund|last=Pieter Muysken and Norval Smith (editors)|first=|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=2015|isbn=978-3-11-039499-3|location=Berlin, Germany|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saramaccan originators began with an early form of [[Sranan Tongo]], an English-based creole, and transformed it into a new creole via the Portuguese influx, combined with influence from the grammars of [[Fongbe language|Fongbe]] and other [[Gbe languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Surviving the Middle Passage The West Africa-Surinam Sprachbund|last=Pieter Musyken and Norval Smith|first=|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=2015|isbn=|location=Berlin, Germany|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An earlier idea that Saramaccan was an offshoot of a Portuguese [[pidgin]] that had been spoken by slaves who had learned it on the West African coast is no longer{{Dubious|date=January 2013}}{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} subscribed to by working creolists.{{Contradict-inline|article=Monogenetic theory of pidgins#Evidence|date=January 2013}} See [[monogenetic theory of pidgins]] for more information.
 
Certain common words in Sranan Tongo, the most common creole spoken in Suriname, also derive from Portuguese words, but it remains a largely English-based creole.

==Dialects==
Saramaccan is divided into three main dialects. The Upper Suriname River dialect and the Lower Suriname River dialect are both spoken by members of the [[Saramaka|Saramaccan tribe]]. The Matawari tribe has its own dialect.&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, Smith and Veenstra (1994): p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tone===
The language has two surface [[tone (linguistics)|tones]]: high and low. [[Stress (linguistics)|Stress]] in European words is replaced by high tone in Saramaccan.&lt;ref name="bsv170"/&gt;

==Lexicon==
Saramaccan's vocabulary is 30% derived from [[English language|English]], 20% from [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. It is one of the few known creoles to derive a large percentage of its lexicon from more than one source (most creoles have one main [[lexifier]] language). Also, it is said to be both an [[English-based creole languages|English-based creole]] and a [[Portuguese Creole|Portuguese-based creole]].&lt;ref name="bsv168-189"&gt;Bakker, Smith and Veenstra (1994): pp. 168–169.&lt;/ref&gt;

About 50% of the vocabulary of Saramaccan is of [[African languages|African]] origin,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Travels with Tooy|last=Price|first=Richard|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2007|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=309-389|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the largest percentage of any creole in the [[Americas]]. Source languages for these words include [[Kikongo language|Kikongo]], [[Gbe languages]], and [[Twi]].&lt;ref name="bsv168-189"/&gt;

==Examples==
To English-speakers not familiar with it, the English basis of this language is almost unrecognizable. Here are some examples of Saramaccan sentences, taken from the SIL dictionary:

''De waka te de aan sinkii möön.''&lt;br&gt;"They walked until they were worn out."

''U ta mindi kanda fu dee soni dee ta pasa ku u.''&lt;br&gt;"We make up songs about things that happen to us."

''A suku di soni te wojo fëën ko bëë.''&lt;br&gt;"He searched for it in vain."

''Mi puu tu dusu kölu bai ën.''&lt;br&gt;"I paid two thousand guilders to buy it."

Examples of words originally from Portuguese or a Portuguese creole are ''mujee'' (mulher) "woman," womi (o homem) "man," ''da'' (dar) "to give," ''bunu'' (bom) "good," ''kaba'' (acabar) "to end"; ''ku'' (com) "with," ''kuma'' (como) "as," ''faka'' (faca) "knife," ''aki'' (aqui) "here," ''ma'' (mas) "but," ''kendi'' (quente) "hot," ''liba'' (riba) "above," and ''lio'' (rio) "river."

==Literature==
Two books have now been published in Saamaka, at the request of the Saamaka people, who have distributed them in their schools:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=''Fesiten''|last=Price|first=Richard|publisher=Vents d'ailleurs|year=2013|isbn=978-2364130388|location=La Roque d'Anthéron (France)|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Fesiten'' and ''Boo go a Kontukonde''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Boo go a Kontukonde|last=Price, Richard and Sally Price|first=|publisher=Vents d'ailleurs|year=2016|isbn=9782364131842|location=La Roque d'Anthéron (France)|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both have used the orthography that is now accepted by the Saamaka people, which was developed by Saamaka linguist Vinije Haabo.

They share territory along the [[Shushufindi River|Shushufindi]], [[Aguarico River|Aguarico]], and [[Cuyabeno river]] with the [[Secoya people]], with whom they are sometimes considered a single population.

The [[Siona language]] is a [[Tucanoan language]].

The Siona people are organized politically through the National Organization of Seona Indigenous People of Ecuador (ONISE), whose president as of July 1996 was William Criollo.[http://abyayala.nativeweb.org/ecuador/amazon/oil/oxy1.html]

According to Richard Evan Schultes, Where The Gods Reign, p.&amp;nbsp;27, the "Siona are one of the western Tukanoan groups and live in the [[Department of Putumayo|Comissaria del Putamayo]] in the region of Mocoa."  I lived in this area in the summer of 1961 with members of the Summer Institute of Linguistics.  Our home was on the Ecuador side of the Putamayo River and the Siona lived on both sides of the river.

The Siona live in [[Sucumbíos Province|Sucumbios Province]] in Ecuador, mainly in the [[Cuyabeno Wildlife Reserve]] and in the [[Department of Putumayo]] along the [[Putumayo River]]. Besides some traditional activities for subsistence, they have been participating in the tourism activities since the 1990s. Nevertheless, their participation in the tourism sector has generated various sociocultural and economic changes such as immigration to neighboring cities, gender issues, economic dependency on tourism revenues.&lt;ref&gt;

'''"The Hungry Hercynian"''' is a [[fantasy]] short story by American writer [[L. Sprague de Camp]], part of his [[Pusadian series]]. It was first published in the magazine ''[[Universe Science Fiction]]'' for December, 1953, and first appeared in book form in the anthology ''[[The Spell of Seven]]'', edited by de Camp ([[Pyramid Books]], 1965). It has also been translated into [[German language|German]], and was first brought together with other works of de Camp in the German collection ''[[Die Chronik von Poseidonis]]'' ([[Pabel]], 1978).&lt;ref name="Laughlin"&gt;{{cite book | last=Laughlin | first=Charlotte |author2=Daniel J. H. Levack | title=De Camp: An L. Sprague de Camp Bibliography | location=San Francisco | publisher=Underwood/Miller | pages=182–183 | date=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
The fugitive Gezun of Lorsk, seeking his fortune in the great city of Torrutseish, becomes enamoured of the slave girl Yorida. At his urging she flees with him from the house of her master, the wizard Derezong Taash, only to be kidnapped by the conspirator Lord Noish as a pawn in the latter's plot to attain the position of chief minister to the king. Noish intends to use the girl as a bribe to secure the aid of the cannibalistic Hercynian shaman Zyc. Gezun must somehow spirit her out of the clutches of the nefarious duo while there is still time. 

Noish successfully deposes Lord Haldu, the chief minister, using Zyc's magical truth drug, but then refuses payment to the wizard Bokari, who recommended Zyc, thus offending him. When Noish finally captures Yorida and delivers her to Zyc and his servant Kumo, the so-called Yorida is revealed to be a magical simulcrum. Enraged, Zyc and Kumo kill and eat Noish whilst Yorida remains more-or-less contentedly with Derezong and Gezun leaves for more profitable pastures.   

Chronologically, "The Hungry Hercynian" is the fourth of de Camp's Pusadian tales, and the second to feature his protagonists Gezun of Lorsk, Derezong Taash, and Zhamel Seh.&lt;ref name="Laughlin"/&gt;

==Setting==
In common with the other Pusadian tales, "The Hungry Hercynian" takes place in a prehistoric era during which a magic-based [[Atlantis|Atlantian]] civilization supposedly throve in what was then a single continent consisting of [[Eurasia]] joined with [[Africa]], and in the islands to the west. It is similar in conception to [[Robert E. Howard]]'s [[Hyborian Age]], by which it was inspired, but more astutely constructed, utilizing actual [[Ice Age]] geography in preference to a wholly invented one. In de Camp's scheme, the legend of this culture that came down to classic [[Greece]] as "Atlantis" was a garbled memory that conflated the mighty Tartessian Empire with the island continent of Pusad and the actual Atlantis, a barbaric mountainous region that is today the [[Atlas Mountains|Atlas mountain range]].

The principle of '''truth-value links''' is a concept in [[metaphysics]] discussed in debates between [[philosophical realism]] and [[anti-realism]]. Philosophers who appeal to truth-value links in order to explain how individuals can come to understand parts of the world that are apparently cognitively inaccessible (the past, the feelings of others, etc.) are called truth-value link realists.

== Truth-value link realism&lt;!--'Truth-value link realism' and 'Evidence-transcendent' redirects here--&gt; ==

[[Image:TVL.jpg|thumbnail|right|400px|The principle of ''truth-value links'' depicted graphically.]]

Proponents of '''truth-value link realism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; argue that our understanding of past-tense statements allows us to grasp the truth-conditions of the statements, even if they are '''evidence-transcendent'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;. They explain this by noting that it is unproblematic for us to conceptualize a present-tense true statement being true in the future. In other words, if "It is raining today" is true today, then "It was raining yesterday" will be true tomorrow. Truth-value link realists argue that this same construction can be applied to past-tense statements. For example, "It was raining yesterday" is true today if and only if "It is raining today" ''was'' true yesterday.

The truth-value link allows us to understand the following. First, suppose that we can understand, in an unproblematic way, truth about a present-tense statement. Assume that it is true, now, when one claims "On 22 May 2006, Student X is writing a paper for her philosophy seminar," and call it statement A. Suppose that, a year later, someone claims, "On 22 May 2006, Student X was writing a paper for her philosophy seminar," and call it statement B. According to [[Michael Dummett]]’s explication of the truth-value link, "since the statement A is now true, the statement B, made in one year’s time, is likewise true."&lt;ref&gt;Dummett, Michael, "The Reality of the Past," in ''Truth and Other Enigmas'' (Harvard University Press, 1978), 363.&lt;/ref&gt; It is in understanding the truth-value link that one is able to understand what it is for a statement in the past-tense to be true. The truth-value persists in the tense shift – hence the "link."

=== Criticisms ===

Some philosophers, including [[Michael Dummett]] and [[John McDowell]], have criticized truth-value link realism. They argue that it is unintelligible to suppose that training in a language can give someone ''more'' than what is involved in the training, i.e. access to inaccessible realms like the past and the minds of others. More important, they suggest that the realist appeal to the principle of truth-value links does not actually explain how the inaccessible can be cognized. When the truth-value link realist claims that, if "It is raining today" ''was'' true yesterday, then "It was raining yesterday" ''is'' true today, he or she is still appealing to an inaccessible realm of the past. In brief, one is attempting to access that which one has already conceded as being inaccessible.

'''UNIMA''' (''Union Internationale de la Marionnette'' - ''International Puppetry Association'') was founded in [[Prague]] in 1929 (the then Czechoslovak magazine [[Loutkář]] was UNIMA's first official journal in years 1929-1930). In 1981, the French puppeteer Jacques Félix moved UNIMA's headquarters to [[Charleville-Mézières]], [[France]], location of the ''Festival Mondial des Théâtres de Marionnettes'' since 1972. UNIMA is affiliated to [[UNESCO]] and it is a member of the [[International Theatre Institute]].

'''''Volume''''' is an [[Indie game|indie]] [[Stealth game|stealth-based video game]] developed by [[Mike Bithell|Mike Bithell Games]]. It was released for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[OS X]], and [[PlayStation 4]] in August 2015, and the [[PlayStation Vita]] version in January 2016. The game uses stealth mechanics inspired by ''[[Metal Gear Solid]]'', allowing the player to plan courses of action to work through levels without being detected by guards, dogs, and automated security turrets to reach specific objectives. In addition to the game's levels, ''Volume'' supports user-made levels that can be shared with others. The game presents a modern take on the [[Robin Hood]] legend, where a young thief discovers a plot for a military coup involving various heists, and uses a device called "Volume" with the assistance of its [[artificial intelligence]] to perform these heists in a virtual manner and broadcasting them to the world at large to make the coup known. The story is presented with help of voice actors [[Charlie McDonnell]], [[Danny Wallace (humourist)|Danny Wallace]], [[Dan Bull]], [[Jim Sterling]], and [[Andy Serkis]].

==Plot==
''Volume''{{'}}s story is based on a modern take of the [[Robin Hood]] legend. Robert Locksley (voiced by [[Charlie McDonnell]]) is a [[petty thief]] that finds a device called "Volume", which allows the user to simulate [[Robbery|heist]]s that is part of a secret military ''[[Coup d'état|coup]]'' attempt. The device has an [[artificial intelligence]] built into it named Alan (played by [[Danny Wallace (humourist)|Danny Wallace]]) that acts as "[[Office Assistant|the Microsoft Office paperclip]] as a military training program", according to Bithell,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.joystiq.com/2013/10/25/thomas-was-alone-narrator-stars-in-volume-as-military-version-of | title = Thomas Was Alone narrator stars in Volume as military version of Clippy | first =  Sinan | last = Kubba | date = 2013-10-25 | accessdate = 2013-10-25 | publisher =  [[Joystiq]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and guides Robert on how to use the device. Robert decides to use the device to broadcast the simulations of high-profile crimes across the Internet in the same manner as [[Let's Play (video gaming)|Let's Play]] videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-10-25-mike-bithells-volume-stars-danny-wallace-and-youtuber-charlie-mcdonnell | title = Mike Bithell's Volume stars Danny Wallace and Youtuber Charlie McDonnell | first = Wesley | last = Yin-Poole | date = 2013-10-25 | accessdate = 2013-10-25 | publisher = [[Eurogamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Locksley will face off against [[Guy Gisborne]], played by [[Andy Serkis]], re-envisioned for the game as the CEO of a company that has taken over the country of England and runs the nation as a [[corporatocracy]].&lt;ref name="serkis"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-10/31/andy-serkis-volume | title = Andy Serkis joins cast of indie game 'Volume' | date = 2014-10-31 | accessdate = 2014-10-31 | first = Matt | last = Kamen | work = [[Wired UK]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="polygon serkis"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.polygon.com/2015/3/13/8193529/volume-andy-serkis-villain | title = Andy Serkis brings out the thug in Volume's villain | first = Megan | last = Farokhmanesh  | date = 2013-03-13 | accessdate = 2015-03-13 | publisher = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is hinted in-game that ''Volume'' is set in the same timeline as that of ''[[Thomas Was Alone]]'', also developed by [[Mike Bithell]], but [[Sequel|set after]] the events of that game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://arstechnica.co.uk/gaming/2015/08/volume-review-stealing-back-the-middle-class/ |  title = Volume review: Cyberpunk Robin Hood meets Metal Gear Solid | first = Steven | last= Strom  |date = 19 August 2015 | accessdate = 21 August 2015 | publisher = [[Ars Technica]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
[[File:Volume gameplay.jpg|thumb|right|''Volume''{{'}}s approach is similar to the ''Metal Gear'' series, in this case, showing the player as Robert (bottom center) in virtual heist against guards (knight-like figures) and their current cones of vision.]]
''Volume''{{'}}s gameplay has been designed by Bithell similar to the stealth elements of the ''[[Metal Gear|Metal Gear Solid]]'' series.&lt;ref name="eg interview"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-08-13-turn-up-the-volume-mike-bithell-switches-gears-for-difficult-second-album | title = Turn up the Volume: Mike Bithell switches gears for difficult second album | publisher = [[Eurogamer]] | date = 2013-08-13 | accessdate = 2013-10-25 | first = Wesley | last =Yin-Poole }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game is presented in a top-down third-person view of the Volume simulation, showing a floor layout, Robert's avatar, and several guards and other antagonists that patrol the area. Several different variety of guards exist, each which have different patterns of movement and how they respond to seeing the player-character; such guards include archers that have a long range of vision, rogues that can see in a full circle around them, dogs that work by sense of smell and track the player by proximity, and automated turrets that react much faster than other guards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-01-12-listen-to-andy-serkis-play-the-bad-guy-in-mike-bithells-volume | title = Listen to Andy Serkis play the bad guy in Mike Bithell's Volume | first = Wesley | last = Yin-Poole | date = 2015-01-12 | accessdate = 2015-01-12 | publisher = [[Eurogamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; When spotted, the player has a short amount of time to attempt to break the light of sight and take cover, otherwise the simulation will restart, either fully or at the most recent checkpoint that the player has crossed. Guards will behave in established patterns, and the player can disrupt these by making noise, such as flushing a toilet, or purposely cross their line of sight to draw them away from a patrol route. The player is unable to kill these foes, but over the course of the story, gain an arsenal of tools to distract them and avoid detection; once the player has one or more such tools, they can create a loadout for their character to select which gadgets they wish to take into a level.

The goal is to sneak through the level without being spotted to complete various heists. En route, the player needs to collect gems that are scattered through the level before the exit point will become available. Players are tracking on global leaderboards based on how fast they completed a level, with the game allowing players to revisit earlier levels to improve their times.

The game contains 100 story-based levels. Additionally, the game includes a level editor, allowing users to create their own simulated missions. Players are required to complete their own levels before uploading them to be shared with others.

==Development==
Bithell's inspiration for ''Volume'' was directly from his earlier enjoyment of playing the ''Metal Gear'' games since a teenager. Though several other stealth games have come out since then, Bithell felt the newer games lost the "purity" of the stealth experience that ''Metal Gear'' provided.&lt;ref name="eg interview"/&gt;

The user-generation aspects for ''Volume'' were inspired by ''The Document of Metal Gear Solid 2'' that was on the ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance]]'' disc, during which ''Metal Gear''{{'}} game designer, [[Hideo Kojima]], designed prototypes of levels in real-life using [[Lego]] bricks. Bithell designed the in-game level editor to work similar to Lego, allowing the player to snap-in predesigned elements onto new or existing levels, including the game's core levels. Bithell hopes that ''Volume'' will have an active user-community that will continue to evolve the game over many years, similar to that of ''[[Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines]]'' where the player community has continued to work on improving the game five years after release.&lt;ref name="eg interview"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-07-10-reanimated-the-story-of-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines | title =  Reanimated: The story of Vampire: The Masquerade Bloodlines | first = Rick | last = Lane | date = 2013-07-10 | accessdate = 2013-10-25 | publisher = [[Eurogamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bithell expected that ''Volume'' will still have a limited budget, {{GBP|30,000}} compared to the {{GBP|5,000}} he needed for ''Thomas Was Alone'', but the extra funding has been used to hire additional programming help and 3D modelers.&lt;ref name="eg interview"/&gt; On the New Years of 2014, Bithell had to be taken to a hospital due to overworking himself on ''Volume''. Following his treatment, he opted to bring on more staff to help complete the more-ambitious title, with a 15-man team by the game's completion.&lt;ref name="develop"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.develop-online.net/interview/how-mike-bithell-s-never-ending-crunch-on-volume-sent-him-to-hospital/0210243 | title = How Mike Bithell's never-ending crunch on Volume sent him to hospital | first = Lee | last = Bradley | date = 2015-08-19 | accessdate = 2015-08-19 | work = [[Develop (magazine)|Develop]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some included his former colleagues at [[Blitz Games]], where he had worked during the development of ''Thomas Was Alone'', and additional help came from members of [[Curve Digital]] who had previously ported ''Thomas'' to the PlayStation platforms.&lt;ref name="develop"/&gt; David Housden, who composed the ''Thomas'' soundtrack, will also create the music for ''Volume''.&lt;ref name="eg interview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="develop"/&gt;

Bithell announced the game in August 2013, using a carefully managed approach to assure the news was widely disseminated on a specific day, promising further announcements on its voice cast and story at future gaming conventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.penny-arcade.com/report/article/making-noise-how-thomas-was-alone-creator-mike-bithell-put-volume-on-so-man | title =  Making noise: How Thomas Was Alone creator Mike Bithell put Volume on so many gaming sites | publisher = [[Penny Arcade Reports]] | date =2013-08-21 | accessdate = 2013-10-25 | first = Mike | last=  Bithell }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Volume'' was originally planned to be a timed exclusive for the PlayStation 4 and Vita platform sometime in 2015, with the Windows and OSX releases set a month later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-08-20-thomas-was-alone-devs-volume-a-timed-ps4-exclusive | title =  Thomas Was Alone dev's Volume a timed PS4 and Vita exclusive | first = Wesley | last= Yin-Poole | date = 2013-08-20  | accessdate = 2013-10-25 | publisher = [[Eurogamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.computerandvideogames.com/473966/volume-due-for-release-on-ps4-and-vita-next-year/ | title = Volume due for release on PS4 and Vita 'next year' | first = Rob | last = Crossly | date=  2014-08-12 | accessdate=  2014-08-12 | publisher = [[Computer and Video Games]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the release was set to be simultaneous across all platforms on 18 August 2015; while the PlayStation 4, Windows, and OS X versions were released on this day, Bithell stated that the Vita version was delayed by a few weeks to better refine the title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2015/6/10/8755353/volume-release-date-ps4-mac-pc-steam |  title = Volume brings a modern-day Robin Hood to PlayStation, Mac and PC Aug. 18 | first = Dave | last= Tach  |date = 10 June 2015 | accessdate = 10 June 2015 | publisher = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/articles/volumes-vita-release-delayed-a-couple-of-weeks/1100-6429834/ | title = Volume's Vita Release Delayed "a Couple of Weeks" | first = Tamoor | last = Hussain | date = 2015-08-18 | accessdate = 2015-08-18 | publisher = [[GameSpot]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bithell later confirmed that the game would be released as a CrossBuy title for the Vita in January 2016, the additional time used to polish the game based on player feedback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-12-23-volume-finally-has-playstation-vita-release-date | title = Volume finally has PlayStation Vita release date | work = [[Eurogamer]] | date = 23 December 2015 | accessdate = 23 December 2015 | first  = Tom | last = Phillips }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vita version was released on 6 January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://blog.us.playstation.com/2016/01/06/volume-brings-stylish-stealth-to-ps-vita-today/ | title = Volume Brings Stylish Stealth to PS Vita Today | first = Mike | last=  Bithell | date = 6 January 2016 | accessdate = 6 January 2016 | work = [[PlayStation Blog]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; A physical edition of the Vita version will be published by Limited Run, sometime in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.polygon.com/2016/3/30/11333262/volume-oddworld-new-n-tasty-physical-release-vita-ps4 | title = Volume, Oddworld: New 'n Tasty getting extremely limited physical prints | first = Allegra | last = Frank | date = 30 March 2016 | accessdate = 30 March 2016 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bithell had already worked with Danny Wallace from ''Thomas Was Alone''.&lt;ref name="serkis"/&gt; For the role of Gisborne, Bithell had listed Andy Serkis high on his list of desired actors. Serkis has responded positively to Bithell's script, and they were able to arrange for his voice acting between Serkis' busy schedule.&lt;ref name="serkis"/&gt; Bithell contends that Serkis brought "a great amount of gravitas" to the character to help flesh out the game.&lt;ref name="serkis"/&gt; With Serkis' involvement, Bithell changed the character of Gisborne to better suit Serkis' acting style, making the character more fiendish than an evil genius.&lt;ref name="polygon serkis"/&gt;

An expansion, ''Volume: Coda'', has been announced to be released in 2016 alongside [[Sony]]'s [[PlayStation VR]] (Virtual Reality) unit. The expansion will include 30 additional levels, and will enable the game to be played on the VR unit, though the VR unit will not be required. The new levels extend the game's story, following the trials of "The Troubleshooter", a person that was captured by the government forces after the actions of Locksley in the main story, and will include new voice actors for additional characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-10-22-volume-coda-expansion-headed-first-to-playstation-vr | title = Volume: Coda expansion headed first to PlayStation VR | publisher = [[Eurogamer]] | date = 22 October 2015 | accessdate = 22 October 2015 | first = Tom | last= Phillips }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.vg247.com/2015/10/22/volume-coda-is-a-free-playstation-vr-expansion-coming-in-2016/ | title = Volume: Coda is a free PlayStation VR expansion coming in 2016 | first = Stephany | last = Nunneley | date = 22 October 2015 | accessdate = 22 October 2015 | publisher = [[VG247]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-06-08-volume-is-getting-a-free-playstation-vr-expansion | title = Volume is getting a free PlayStation VR expansion | first = Jeffrey | last = Matulef | date = 8 June 2016 | accessdate = 8 June 2016 | work = [[Eurogamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zangle''' is a student information system for [[School|schools]] and [[School district|school districts]] to allow teachers to record students' academic progress in classes and for parents and students to check their grades, find assignments that will be due in the future,  find past-due assignments, pay fees, as well as other information. The system features many modules that record various student data such as attendance, academic history, behavior and so on. It is popular among schools across the [[United States]], and a bit in other locations. The system uses the [[Microsoft SQL Server|Microsoft SQL]] [[database]] engine for data storage.
